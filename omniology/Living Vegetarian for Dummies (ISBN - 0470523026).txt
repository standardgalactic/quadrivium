Author’s Acknowledgments
Heartfelt thanks to the kind, competent, and hardworking team at Wiley 
Publishing who made this book possible: to Acquisitions Editor Michael 
Lewis, Project Editor Sarah Faulkner, Copy Editor Todd Lothery, and intern 
Beth Staton, who expertly guided this book from concept to completion, and 
to their very talented colleagues, who worked their magic in the design and 
production departments. I’m grateful to Patricia Santelli for her assistance 
with the nutritional analyses of the recipes, and to expert recipe tester Emily 
Nolan for her good work. I’m especially indebted to my longtime friend and 
colleague, Ginny Messina, for her help with the technical review. Many 
thanks as well go to my agent, Mary Ann Naples, and her colleagues at The 
Creative Culture, as well as to my former agent and good friend, Patti 
Breitman, with whom I worked on the predecessor to this book, Being 
Vegetarian For Dummies (Wiley). It is such a privilege and joy to be part of a 
team of so many outstanding professionals.
Many of my colleagues in the U.S., in Canada, and around the world have 
dedicated their lives and careers to advancing knowledge in nutrition 
science, the links between diet and health, and the practice of diet and 
health policymaking. My work builds on theirs, and I salute the collective 
efforts of this community of scholars and practitioners. 
I am grateful for my family and friends and their continued support and good 
humor. Special thanks to my sisters-in-law, Laura Bridges and Karen Bush, 
for lending me a beautiful beachfront getaway on the North Carolina coast, 
where I wrote several chapters in record time under the spell of ocean 
breezes, sea oats, and swooping pelicans. My husband, Mike, helped me 
day-to-day with his encouraging words, brilliant ideas, and the occasional 
caipirinha on the back deck.
I am indebted, too, to readers of my newspaper column, On the Table. Their 
feedback and encouragement help me stay in touch with issues of primary 
concern to people trying to do their best to make wise food choices.

Living Vegetarian For Dummies

Foreword
S
imply put, this book may be the most important book you read this 
year . . . or this decade.
When I was in college, I certainly could have used a book like Living 
Vegetarian For Dummies. Somehow, I had heard that a vegetarian diet was 
healthful, or perhaps just cool, so I tried it. The first evening I ate a pound of 
broccoli. The next night I ate a pound of cauliflower. And so on. Actually, my 
first bout with vegetarianism may not have lasted more than those first two 
days.
I thought that “vegetarian” meant eating only vegetables. I only wish that 
Suzanne Havala Hobbs had been around to hold me by the hand (as this book 
will do for you) and show me that vegetarian diets are typically more varied, 
more healthful, and more delicious than the typical steak-and-potatoes (or 
burger-and-fries in my case) American diet.
Truth be told, I never became a full-fledged vegetarian, let alone a vegan, and 
most casual claimants to vegetarianism probably also cheat a bit. Flexitarian 
is what we say we are, which often means eating mostly vegetarian, but 
dining on fish, chicken, or even beef or pork occasionally. Such folks gain 
most of the health benefits of well-constructed vegetarian diets, but can’t 
claim to be free of any responsibility for the maltreatment of farm animals 
(especially layer hens, dairy cows, and veal calves). At the other end of 
vegetarianism are vegans, who, notwithstanding all the temptations of 
daily life in North America, eschew even the lacto ovo foods that regular 
vegetarians eat plenty of. Fortunately, Sue Hobbs provides sensible guidance 
for people at every point on the vegetarian spectrum.
Some people (including me) have moved toward vegetarian diets mostly for 
health reasons, and those reasons are ample. Vegetarians (and I don’t mean 
people whose notion of vegetarianism is chowing down on soft drinks, cookies, 
quiches, and chocolate bars) have lower risks of obesity, diabetes, heart 
disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. (Because most studies include few 
vegans, it’s unclear whether vegans fare even better than run-of-the-mill lacto 
ovo vegetarian.)

Living Vegetarian For Dummies 
xxvi
Probably more people are attracted to vegetarianism for moral reasons. 
Eating animal products inevitably means that one is contributing to the 
miserable circumstances in which most farm animals spend their lives. 
Raising cattle, pigs, and chickens on grass and grubs certainly reduces the 
misery, but most vegans end up vegans because they don’t want to feel 
culpable for any part of the raising and killing of animals.
If better health for yourself and avoidance of cruelty to animals aren’t 
reason enough to eat a more plant-based diet, consider the benefits to the 
environment. Raising animals means using more energy-intensive fertilizer, 
much of which ends up polluting waterways. It means using huge quantities 
of water to irrigate fields of feed grains. Questionably safe pesticides 
endanger farm workers and wildlife. And the animals themselves emit 
greenhouse gases in the form of manure (which may also pollute rivers and 
streams) and cows’ belching of methane gas. Eating fewer animal products 
and more fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, and nuts will help protect 
our increasingly crowded and polluted planet.
But back to basics: your taste buds will thank you, day after day, for moving 
in a vegetarian direction. Enjoy!

Introduction
V
egetarianism has come a long, long way.
As a child, I wore a button that said, “Real People Wear Fake Furs.” I’d 
picked it up at the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair when my older sister was in col-
lege at the University of Michigan. It was the late ’60s, and it wasn’t much 
longer before my mother announced to our family that from then on, she 
would be a vegetarian. She never said why, but for the next several years, the 
former Wisconsinite ate cheese omelets or cheddar-cheese-and-pickle sand-
wiches on whole-wheat toast for dinner while the rest of us ate the meat she 
prepared for us. That is, of course, until we kids followed her lead and, one 
by one and without fanfare, became vegetarians ourselves.
My dad worried we’d miss vital nutrients. He chided my mother for planting 
the idea. Mom, a registered nurse, was considered a bit odd by her hospital 
colleagues. By now, it was the early ’70s, and vegetarians lived on communes 
or wore Birkenstocks and long hair on college campuses. They weren’t kids 
and working, middle-aged moms.
A competitive swimmer in high school, I hoped that a vegetarian diet would 
boost my endurance and athletic performance, as Olympic gold medalist 
Murray Rose claimed it had for him. It didn’t help enough, but it did pique my 
interest in nutrition and set me on the path to a career in dietetics. It would 
be many years, however, before the scientific community came around to the 
idea that a diet of grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and nuts can be 
adequate — never mind superior — to a diet centered on animal products.
In college, I learned about vegetarianism in a lesson on fad diets. At that time, 
in the early 1980s, a blood cholesterol level of 300 mg/dl was considered 
normal, and patients in the coronary care unit in the hospital got bacon and 
eggs and white toast for breakfast.
My grandmother worried that I wouldn’t get enough iron if I didn’t eat red 
meat. She thought that my slender body wasn’t “healthy” enough in size as 
compared to her old-world, European standards. For baby boomers like me, 
this was the environment for vegetarians in North America 30 years ago.
Everything is different now.

2
Living Vegetarian For Dummies 
In the last 20 years, the American Dietetic Association — long the conserva-
tive holdout on such matters — went from  cautious at first, to later tentative 
at best, to now clearly stating in its position papers that vegetarian diets 
confer health advantages. U.S. government dietary recommendations now 
explicitly acknowledge the vegetarian alternative and  advise all Americans to 
make fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes the foundation of a healthy diet. 
It’s as close as the government can come to a stamp of approval for a plant-
based diet as it balances science with the economic interests of the powerful 
meat and dairy industries.
As a practicing nutritionist and vegetarian, I’ve observed these changes 
taking place over decades. The scientific rationale for eating a plant-based 
diet is well-documented. The advantages for everyone and everything on our 
planet are compelling. The next task is helping people everywhere make the 
transition to an eating style that, at this time, is still outside the cultural norm 
in many countries. Accomplishing this requires education and the political 
will to initiate and enforce policies to create an environment that makes it 
easier for you and me to sustain lifestyles that support health.
Living vegetarian is an excellent way to meet today’s dietary recommenda-
tions for good health. This book is for everyone who wants to understand the 
future of preventive nutrition and get a head start on making the switch.
About This Book
This book is for vegetarians and prospective vegetarians, too — for anyone 
curious about what a vegan is, for those who still have questions about 
where vegetarians get their protein, for parents who are wringing their hands 
because Junior has “gone vegetarian,” and for Junior to give to Mom and Dad 
so that they won’t worry.
This book is for vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike. Whether you want to 
control or prevent diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery disease, 
manage your weight, save money, or help keep the planet healthy and the 
animals happy, this book has what you need. That’s because the secret to 
living well is eating well, and to eat well, you need to make plant foods the 
foundation of your diet.
It’s the simple truth.
Don’t feel you need to read the chapters in this book in order or read the 
book from cover to cover. It’s designed to make sense and be helpful whether 
you surf it or read it in its entirety. Throughout the text, you’ll find cross-
references to guide you to other parts of the book where you can find related 
information.

 Introduction
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read, I adhere to the following conventions or 
rules throughout:
 
✓ When I use the term vegetarian, I’m using it generically. In other words, 
it includes all the various subtypes — vegans, lacto, lacto ovo, and other 
variations of a vegetarian diet. When I want you to know something 
unique to a particular form of vegetarianism, I refer to the specific diet 
subtype. (Chapter 1 gives you definitions and explanations of each of 
these types of vegetarianism.)
 
✓ I use italics to introduce new terms, and I give you definitions of the new 
terms shortly thereafter.
 
✓ Bold text makes it easy to spot keywords in bulleted lists.
 
✓ Web addresses are printed in monofont, like this.
 
✓ When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed 
to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I 
haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the 
break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly 
what you see in this book, pretending the line break doesn’t exist.
 
✓ I don’t specify most recipe ingredients as being organic, conventional, 
low-sodium, or other possible variations. When you shop for ingredients, 
feel free to make these choices as you see fit.
 
✓ Some recipes note the substitutions to make the dish suitable for vegans. 
In cases where I don’t provide that information, feel free to experiment 
and make the substitutions yourself. I provide lots of information about 
recipe substitutions in Chapter 8.
 
✓ All margarine in the recipes is trans fat-free.
 
✓ All temperatures in the recipes are in Fahrenheit.
What You’re Not to Read
It’s great if you read the entire book. You won’t miss any helpful hints and 
information that way. On the other hand, some information I include isn’t as 
critical for you to know as the rest. If you need to pare down your reading, 
here’s what you can save for later:

4
Living Vegetarian For Dummies 
 
✓ Material flagged with the Technical Stuff icon: These paragraphs con-
tain information that, while interesting, isn’t vital to your understanding 
of the topic.
 
✓ Sidebars: This information is scattered throughout the book in shaded 
boxes. It’s similar to the Technical Stuff: great if you have the time, but 
not critical for you to read.
 
✓ Recipes: I include a collection of good starter recipes for anyone who 
wants to give them a try. No need to read these unless you’re ready to 
get started in the kitchen.
Foolish Assumptions
If you’re holding this book, you or someone who loves you bought or bor-
rowed this book to gain a better understanding of how to live a vegetarian 
lifestyle. I’m assuming that this book is appropriate for a variety of purposes, 
including:
 
✓ Dipping your toe into the topic. If you just want a little more information 
to help you decide whether living vegetarian may be something you’d 
like to consider doing, this book is appropriate for you.
 
✓ Digging in deeper. You may already have a general sense of what’s 
involved in living vegetarian, but you want more in-depth advice and 
understanding of how to go about it. This book is for you.
 
✓ Sharing the knowledge. If you know someone with an interest in going 
vegetarian — or someone who may simply be curious and interested in 
finding out more — this book is a reliable resource.
 
✓ Refreshing your own knowledge. Longtime vegetarians may benefit from 
the up-to-date information in this book.
 
✓ Having a reference on hand. Health professionals often encounter veg-
etarians in their work and have to give them medical or dietary advice. If 
you’re a health professional and you have no personal experience with 
a vegetarian lifestyle, this book may be helpful as an accurate and quick 
reference.
You can make some assumptions about me, too:
 
✓ I know what I’m talking about. I’m a licensed, registered dietitian with a 
master’s degree in human nutrition and a doctorate in public health. I’m 
a leading expert on vegetarian nutrition and have lived a vegetarian life-
style myself for 35 years.

5
 Introduction
 
✓ My advice is practical. It’s informed by my own experience of living 
vegetarian for more than three decades, as well as many years of experi-
ence counseling individuals on special diets, including both vegetarians 
and nonvegetarians.
 
✓ I’m not giving individualized advice. As much as I wish it were possible, 
books aren’t an appropriate means of dispensing medical or dietary 
advice tailored to individual needs. I can give you general information 
that provides you with a good foundation of knowledge about the topic. 
However, if you have specific issues you need help with — particularly 
medical conditions that require you to follow a special diet — you 
should get additional, individualized guidance from a registered dieti-
tian. I include information in Chapter 1 about how to locate a dietitian 
with expertise in vegetarian diets.
How This Book Is Organized
Living Vegetarian For Dummies is divided into six parts. The book is orga-
nized to take you through a logical progression of information, moving from 
basic to more in-depth, depending on your level of interest and experience.
Parts I and II provide fundamental information that you should know if you’re 
contemplating going vegetarian full time or part time. Part III includes recipes 
to get you started. Parts IV, V, and VI are important for anyone ready to dig a 
little deeper who wants more advanced-level skills.
Each part focuses on a different aspect of vegetarianism, from the basic who, 
what, and why to the nutritional underpinnings of a diet without meat, strate-
gies to help you make the transition, and tips on how to maintain the lifestyle 
over time. Together, the six parts of this book lay the foundation for under-
standing the vegetarian lifestyle and building the skills necessary to success-
fully adapt.
Part I: Being Vegetarian: 
What It’s All About
This part peels away the first layer of mystery around issues of vegetarian-
ism. It gets to the bottom of the various definitions of vegetarian diets, reveal-
ing once and for all what the word vegan means and how to pronounce it. It 
looks at what vegetarians do eat, including vegetarian traditions around the 
world, rather than stopping at what they don’t eat. This part also discusses 

6
Living Vegetarian For Dummies 
the reasons people adopt a vegetarian diet and the nutritional aspects of 
vegetarian diets. It also guides you with good-sense advice and strategies for 
making the transition.
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your 
Vegetarian Kitchen
This part explains how to set up a vegetarian-friendly kitchen so that you can 
make more meals at home. It covers what you need to know about common 
and versatile ingredients, where to shop for them, and strategies for getting 
the best values. This part also focuses on practical equipment and basic 
cooking techniques you should know to help you get started.
Part III: Meals Made Easy: Recipes for 
Everyone
I provide a good set of starter recipes in this part, covering the major food 
categories and including recipes that are versatile and practical. Ingredient 
lists are short, and basic cooking skills are all that’s necessary to follow the 
simple instructions. You can modify most of the recipes to add or subtract 
animal ingredients, depending on the extent to which you want to include or 
exclude them.
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the 
Vegetarian Lifestyle
This part provides advanced advice for anyone who’s ready for intermediate- 
to advanced-level skills in living vegetarian. It includes strategies for families 
that have only one vegetarian in the household and tips for getting along 
in social situations outside your home. This part also includes information 
about how to maintain a vegetarian lifestyle when eating out at restaurants 
and traveling away from home.
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime
Part V takes a life-course view of living vegetarian, with advice that’s special-
ized for whatever stage you’re in. I include information about living vegetar-
ian during pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and the teen years, as well as into 
adulthood and older adulthood.

7
 Introduction
Part VI: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books end with The Part of Tens, a collection of handy tips, 
lists, and fun facts that are easy to read at a glance. The chapters in this part 
provide you with a quick list of reasons why it makes sense to go vegetarian, 
as well as practical advice about how to make it happen, including simple 
ingredient substitutions and easy lunchbox ideas.
Icons Used in This Book
Another fun feature of For Dummies books is the clever icons that flag helpful 
nuggets of information. Each icon denotes a particular type of information. 
Here’s what each icon means:
 
Tips are insights or other helpful clues that may make it more convenient or 
hassle-free for you to follow a vegetarian diet.
 
When you see this icon, the information that follows is a rule-of-thumb or 
another truism you should keep in mind.
 
If you see this icon, the information is meant to help you avoid a common pit-
fall or to keep you from getting into trouble.
 
This is information that, while interesting, isn’t vital to your understanding of 
the topic. In other words, some of you may skip it, but it’s there if you care to 
find out more.
Where to Go from Here
The science of nutrition is complicated, but being well-nourished is a rela-
tively simple matter. It’s even easier to do if you eat a wholesome, plant-
based diet. That’s where this book comes in.

8
Living Vegetarian For Dummies 
If you want a clearer understanding of what vegetarianism is, start with the 
foundational information in Chapter 1. If you have a child or teenager who’s 
interested in becoming vegetarian, check out Chapter 21. If you’re ready to 
whip up some tasty vegetarian meals, head straight to Part III — you can start 
with the breakfast recipes in Chapter 9 or skip straight to the dessert recipes 
in Chapter 14 (I won’t tell!).
Whether you go vegetarian all the way or part of the way, moving to a more 
plant-based diet is one of the smartest moves you can make. I hope this book 
helps. Best wishes to you as you take the first step!

Part I
Being Vegetarian: 
What It’s All About

In this part . . .
T
o change the way you eat, you not only have to gain 
knowledge and develop and practice new skills, but 
you also have to change your mind-set. That includes 
replacing old traditions with new ones. That’s the fun of it, 
and that’s the challenge, too.
In this part of the book, I cover basic information you 
need to help you get started. I define the various types of 
vegetarian diets and explain the reasons many people 
make the switch. I give you the background you need to 
understand nutrition issues pertaining to meatless diets, 
including how to ensure you get what you need from 
whole foods. I also discuss the pros and cons of taking 
vitamin and mineral supplements.
I also share some good-sense advice about living the vege-
tarian lifestyle. I explain how to plan for meatless meals, 
and I coach you on practical ways to master the behav-
ioral changes that are a part of the transition to a new eat-
ing style.
It’s exciting! Let’s get started. . . .

Chapter 1
Vegetarianism 101: 
Starting with the Basics
In This Chapter
▶ Defining different types of vegetarianism
▶ Explaining why meat-free makes sense
▶ Fixing meatless meals
▶ Adopting a new mind-set about food
M
ention a vegetarian diet, and many people visualize a big hole in the 
center of your dinner plate. They think that to be a vegetarian, you 
have to like lettuce and carrot sticks — a lot. Just contemplating it leaves 
them gnawing on their knuckles.
Nothing could be further from the truth, however.
Vegetarian diets are diverse, with an abundance of fresh, colorful, and fla-
vorful foods. For anyone who loves good food, vegetarian meals are a feast. 
That may be difficult for nonvegetarians to understand. Vegetarian diets are 
common in some parts of the world, but they’re outside the culture and per-
sonal experience of many people.
That’s why I start with the basics in this chapter. I tell you about the many 
forms a vegetarian diet can take and the reasons people choose to go meat-
free. I give you a quick overview of what’s involved in planning and fixing veg-
etarian meals, and I introduce some important considerations for making the 
transition to meat-free a little easier.

Vegetarian Label Lingo: Who’s Who 
and What They Will and Won’t Eat
Most of us are pretty good at describing a person in just a few words:
“He’s a liberal Democrat.”
“She’s a Gen-Xer.”
It’s like the saying goes: “A picture (or label) paints (or says) a thousand 
words.”
People use labels to describe vegetarians, with different terms corresponding 
to different sets of eating habits. A lacto ovo vegetarian eats differently than 
a vegan eats. In some cases, the term used to describe a type of vegetarian 
refers to a whole range of lifestyle preferences, rather than to just the diet 
alone. In general, though, the specific term used to describe a vegetarian 
has to do with the extent to which that person avoids foods of animal origin. 
Read on for a primer on vegetarian label lingo, an explanation of what I call 
the vegetarian continuum, and an introduction to vegetarian foods.
From vegan to flexitarian: Sorting out 
the types of vegetarianism
In 1992, Vegetarian Times magazine sponsored a  survey of vegetarianism in 
the United States. The results showed that almost 7 percent of Americans 
considered themselves vegetarians.
However, a closer look at the eating habits of those “vegetarians” found that 
most of them were eating chicken and fish occasionally, and many were 
eating red meat at least a few times each month. Most vegetarian organiza-
tions don’t consider occasional flesh-eaters to be vegetarians.
As a result, the nonprofit Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) in 1994 began 
sponsoring national polls on the prevalence of vegetarianism, wording the 
interview questions in such a way as to determine the number of people who 
never eat meat, fish, poultry, or byproducts of these foods. (The organization 
continues to conduct periodic polls, and you can find the results online at 
www.vrg.org.) Over the years, the number of people who fit the VRG defini-
tion of vegetarian has remained relatively stable at between 2 and 3 percent 
of the adult population in the U.S.
The fact is, people interpret the term vegetarian in many different ways.

13
 Chapter 1: Vegetarianism 101: Starting with the Basics
Many people use the term loosely to mean that they’re consciously reducing 
their intake of meat. The word vegetarian has positive connotations, especially 
among those who know that vegetarian diets confer health benefits. But what 
about the true vegetarians? Who are they and what do they eat (or not eat)?
 
The definition of a vegetarian most widely accepted by vegetarian organiza-
tions is this: A vegetarian is a person who eats no meat, fish, or poultry.
Not “I eat turkey for Thanksgiving” or “I eat fish once in a while.” A vegetarian 
consistently avoids all flesh foods, as well as byproducts of meat, fish, and 
poultry. A vegetarian avoids refried beans made with lard, soups made with 
meat stock, and foods made with gelatin, such as some kinds of candy and 
most marshmallows.
The big three: Lacto ovo vegetarian, lacto vegetarian, and vegan
Vegetarian diets vary in the extent to which they exclude animal products. 
Historically, the three major types of vegetarianism have been:
 
✓ Lacto ovo vegetarian: A lacto ovo vegetarian diet excludes meat, fish, 
and poultry but  includes dairy products and eggs. Most vegetarians in 
the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe fall into this category. Lacto ovo 
vegetarians eat such foods as cheese, ice cream, yogurt, milk, and eggs, 
as well as foods made with these ingredients.
 
✓ Lacto vegetarian: A lacto vegetarian diet excludes  meat, fish, and poul-
try, as well as eggs and any foods containing eggs. So a lacto vegetarian, 
for instance, wouldn’t eat the pancakes at most restaurants because 
they contain eggs. Some veggie burger patties are made with egg whites, 
and many brands of ice cream contain egg. A lacto vegetarian wouldn’t 
eat these foods, either. A lacto vegetarian would, however, eat dairy 
products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese.
 
✓ Vegan: Technically, the term vegan (pronounced vee-gun) refers to more 
than just the  diet alone. A vegan is a vegetarian who avoids eating or 
using all animal products, including meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy prod-
ucts, and any foods containing byproducts of these ingredients. Vegans 
also use no wool, silk, leather, and any nonfood items made with animal 
byproducts. Some vegans  avoid honey, and some don’t use refined white 
sugar, or wine that has been processed using bone char or other animal 
ingredients. Needless to say, vegans also don’t eat their dinner on bone 
china. (For more details on veganism, see the nearby sidebar.)
 
In academic nutrition circles, strict vegetarian is the correct term to use to 
describe people who avoid all animal products but who don’t necessarily 
carry animal product avoidance into other areas of their lives. In practice, 
however, the term vegan is usually used by both strict vegetarians and 
vegans, even among those in the know. In other words, technically, the term 
strict vegetarian refers to diet only. The term vegan encompasses both food 
and other products, including clothing, toiletries, and other supplies.

14
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
The list goes on: Semi-vegetarian, flexitarian, and others
Lacto ovo vegetarian, lacto vegetarian, and vegan are the three primary types 
of vegetarian diets, but there are more labels for vegetarians, including the 
following:
 
✓ A semi-vegetarian is someone who’s cutting  back on his intake of meat in 
general.
 
✓ A pesco pollo vegetarian avoids red meat but eats chicken and fish.
 
✓ A pollo vegetarian avoids red meat and fish but eats chicken.
These terms stretch the true definition of a vegetarian, and in practice, only 
the term semi-vegetarian is actually used with much frequency.
In recent years, another term has been introduced as well. A flexitarian is 
basically the same thing as a semi-vegetarian. It refers to someone who’s gen-
erally cutting back on meat but who may eat meat from time to time, when 
it’s more convenient or on a special occasion.
Don’t leave out: Raw foods, fruitarian, and macrobiotic diets
The list actually goes even further. One adaptation  of a vegetarian diet is 
a raw foods diet, which consists primarily of uncooked foods — fruits, veg-
etables, sprouted grains and beans, and vegetable oils. Though raw foodists 
never cook foods in an oven or on a stovetop, some of them eat ingredients 
that have been dehydrated in the sun.
More than a diet: Veganism
Maintaining a vegan lifestyle in our culture can 
be difficult. Most vegans are strongly   motivated 
by ethics, however, and rise to the challenge. A 
large part of maintaining a vegan lifestyle has 
to do with being aware of where animal prod-
ucts are used and knowing about alternatives. 
Vegetarian and animal rights organizations 
offer information and materials to help.
Sometimes vegans unwittingly use a product or 
eat a food that contains an animal byproduct. 
Knowing whether a product is free of all animal 
ingredients can be difficult at times. However, 
the intention is to strive for the vegan ideal.
So a vegan, for instance, wouldn’t     use hand 
lotion that contains lanolin, a byproduct of wool. 
A vegan wouldn’t use margarine that contains 
casein, a milk protein. And a vegan wouldn’t 
carry luggage trimmed in leather. Vegans (as 
well as many other vegetarians) also avoid 
products that have been tested on animals, 
such as many cosmetics and personal care 
products.

15
 Chapter 1: Vegetarianism 101: Starting with the Basics
 
In practice, most raw foodists in North America actually eat a raw vegan diet. 
The proportion of the diet that comes from raw foods is typically anywhere 
from 50 to 80 percent. Most raw foodists aim for a diet that’s 100 percent raw, 
but what they can realistically adhere to still includes some amount of cooked 
food.
Another adaptation, the fruitarian diet, consists only  of fruits, vegetables that 
are botanically classified as fruits (such as tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, and 
avocados), and seeds and nuts. Planning a nutritionally adequate fruitarian 
diet is difficult, and I don’t recommend the diet for children.
Macrobiotic diets are often lumped  into the general category of vegetarian 
diets, even though they may include seafood. This diet excludes all other 
animal products, however, as well as refined sugars, tropical fruits, and 
“nightshade vegetables” (for example, potatoes, eggplant, and peppers). The 
diet is related to principles of Buddhism and is based on the Chinese prin-
ciples of yin and yang. Therefore, macrobiotic diets include foods common to 
Asian culture, such as sea vegetables (including kelp, nori, and arame), root 
vegetables (such as daikon), and miso. Many people follow a macrobiotic diet 
as part of a life philosophy. Others follow the diet because they believe it to 
be effective in curing cancer and other illnesses, an idea that has little scien-
tific support.
The vegetarian continuum: Going 
vegetarian a little or a lot
Pop quiz: What would you call a person who avoids all flesh foods and only 
occasionally eats eggs and dairy products, usually as a minor ingredient in a 
baked good or dish, such as a muffin, cookie, or veggie burger?
Technically, the person is a lacto ovo vegetarian, right? But this diet seems 
as though it’s leaning toward the vegan end of the spectrum.
As a nutritionist, I see this kind of variation — even within the same category 
of vegetarian diet — all the time. One lacto ovo vegetarian may eat heaping 
helpings of cheese and eggs and have a high intake of saturated fat and cho-
lesterol as a result. In fact, this type of vegetarian may have a nutrient intake 
similar to the typical American’s — not so good. Another lacto ovo vegetar-
ian may use eggs and dairy products, but only in a very limited fashion — as 
condiments or minor ingredients in foods. This person’s nutrient intake more 
closely resembles that of a vegan.

16
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
What am I getting at? That labels are only a starting point, and they have limi-
tations. Even if you know generally what type of vegetarian a person is, you 
may see a lot of variation in the degree to which the person uses or avoids 
animal products.
Many new vegetarians find that their diets evolve over time. At the start, for 
example, many rely heavily on cheese and eggs to replace meat. Over time, 
they learn to cook with grains, beans, and vegetables, and they experiment 
with cuisines of other cultures. They decrease their reliance on foods of 
animal origin, and gradually, they consume fewer eggs and dairy products. 
Some eventually move to  a mostly vegan (or strict vegetarian) diet.
You might say that vegetarian diets are on a continuum, stretching from the 
typical American, meat-centered diet on one end to veganism on the other 
(see Figure 1-1). Most vegetarians fall somewhere in between. Some may be 
content staying wherever they begin on the continuum, while others may 
progress along the spectrum as they hone their skills and develop new tradi-
tions, moving from semi-vegetarian, or lacto ovo vegetarian, closer to the 
vegan   end of the spectrum.

continuum.
 
Common foods that happen to be 
vegetarian: Beyond mac and cheese
Your eating style is a mind-set. For proof, ask someone what she’s having for 
dinner tonight. Chances are good she’ll say, “We’re grilling steaks tonight,” 
or, “I’m having fish.” Ever notice how no one mentions the rice, potato, salad, 
vegetables, bread — or anything other than the meat?
Many vegetarians eat these common foods — side dishes to nonvegetarians — 
in larger quantities and call them a meal. Others combine them in new and deli-
cious ways to create main courses that replace a burger or filet. Your skills at 
assembling appealing vegetarian meals will improve over time.

17
 Chapter 1: Vegetarianism 101: Starting with the Basics
Until they do, going vegetarian doesn’t have to mean a whole new menu. 
Many vegetarian foods are actually very familiar to nonvegetarians as well. 
Some examples include:
 
✓ Falafel
 
✓ Pasta primavera
 
✓ Salad
 
✓ Tofu
 
✓ Vegetable lasagna
 
✓ Vegetarian chili
 
✓ Vegetarian pizza
 
✓ Veggie burger
When meat-free isn’t vegetarian: 
Bypassing meat byproducts
Living vegetarian means avoiding meat, fish, and poultry, and it includes 
eliminating ingredients made from those foods, too. Vegetarians don’t eat 
soups that contain beef broth or chicken stock. They avoid meat flavoring in 
pasta sauces, Worcestershire  sauce (which contains anchovies), and many 
stir-fry sauces, which contain oyster sauce. They don’t eat marshmallows 
and some candies, which contain gelatin made from the cartilage and skins 
of animals. In Chapter 5, I cover all this in more detail, listing foods that may 
contain hidden animal products.
Going Vegetarian Is Good for Everyone
Some people go vegetarian for the simple reason that they don’t like meat. 
They chew and chew, and they still have a glob of aesthetically unpleasant 
flesh in their mouth. Some people just like vegetables better.
Others go vegetarian because they recognize the link between diet and 
health, the health of ecosystems on our planet, the welfare of animals, or the 
ability of nations to feed hungry people. Whichever issue first grabs your 
attention, the other advantages may reinforce your resolve.

18
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Eating for health
Many people view their health (or lack thereof) as something that just sort 
of happens to them. Their  bad habits catch up with them, or they have bad 
genes. Their doctor just gave them a clean bill of health, and then they had 
a heart attack out of the blue. (Well, we all have to die of something.) Who 
could have foreseen it? They lived reasonably — everything in moderation, 
right? What more could they have done?
A lot, most likely. You may be surprised to discover how much power you 
wield with your knife and fork. The fact is that vegetarians generally enjoy 
better health and longer lives than nonvegetarians.
In comparison with nonvegetarians, vegetarians are at lower risk for many 
chronic, degenerative diseases and conditions. That’s because a diet com-
posed primarily of plant matter has protective qualities. I cover the diet and 
health connection in more detail in Chapter 2.
Protecting our planet
A disproportionate  amount of the earth’s natural resources is used to pro-
duce meat and other animal products. For example:
 
✓ It takes about 25 gallons of water to grow 1 pound of wheat, but it takes 
about 390 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef.
 
✓ A steer has to eat 7 pounds of grain or soybeans to produce 1 pound of 
beef.
Animal agriculture — the production of meat, eggs, and dairy products — 
places heavy demands on our land, water, and fuel supplies, and in some 
cases, it contributes substantially to problems with pollution. You should 
understand how your food choices affect the well-being of our planet. I dis-
cuss the issues further in Chapter 2.
Compassionate food choices
Many people consider a vegetarian diet the right thing to do. Their sense of 
ethics drives them to make very conscious decisions based on the effects of 
their food choices on others. You may feel the same way.

19
 Chapter 1: Vegetarianism 101: Starting with the Basics
In Chapter 2, I describe more fully the rationale for considering the feelings 
and welfare of animals used for their flesh, eggs, or milk. I also discuss the 
implications of food choices for world hunger. A strong argument can be 
made for living vegetarian as the humane choice — not just in terms of the 
effect on animals, but also because of what it means for people, too.
Meatless Meals Made Easy
Making vegetarian meals doesn’t have to be time-consuming or difficult. 
Despite all the gourmet cooking magazines and high-end kitchen supply 
stores around, you and most other people probably don’t anticipate spend-
ing much of your free time fixing meals.
Not to worry. You can make the best vegetarian meals quickly, using basic 
ingredients with simple techniques and recipes.
Mastering meal planning and prep
After nearly 30 years of counseling individuals on many types of diets, I’ve 
found one thing to be universally true: Nobody follows a structured meal plan 
for very long. Though it may be helpful for some to see a sample meal plan, 
following rigid diet plans doesn’t work well for most people. That’s because 
you, like me, probably juggle a busy schedule that requires a fair amount of 
flexibility in meal planning.
You find a good deal of advice in this book that pertains to planning and pre-
paring meatless meals in the most efficient way possible. In general, though, 
your meals should follow the guidelines I present in Chapter 7.
 
The best way to prepare meals with a minimum of fuss is to remember the key 
word — simple.
You need very little equipment and only basic cooking skills — boiling, baking, 
chopping, and peeling — to prepare most vegetarian foods. The best recipes 
include familiar, easy-to-find ingredients and have short ingredient lists.
The recipes I include in this book in Part III are a great place to start. You 
may also find, as you dig a little further into living vegetarian, that you don’t 
have to rely on recipes at all to fix great meals. My hope for you is that you 
gain confidence in your ability to put ingredients together in simple and 
pleasing ways so that you can quickly and easily assemble delicious, nutri-
tious vegetarian meals.

20
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Shopping strategies
Grocery shopping doesn’t take exceptional skills, but smart shopping habits 
can help ensure that you have the ingredients you need on hand when you 
need them. Because you probably don’t have lots of free time to spend roam-
ing the supermarket, you want to shop efficiently, too.
 
A few tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Keep a list. Post on your refrigerator a running list of ingredients you 
need to pick up the next time you’re at the store. You’ll be less likely to 
forget a key item, and you’ll be less likely to spend impulsively, too.
 
✓ Shop for locally grown, seasonal foods. Stop at your local farmer’s 
market or roadside vegetable stand. Fruits and vegetables grown near 
your home taste better and retain more nutrients than foods that spend 
days on a truck being shipped across the country after being picked.
 
✓ Mix it up. Visit different grocery stores from time to time to take advan-
tage of new food items and varied selections across stores. Ethnic 
markets and specialty shops can give you good ideas and offer some 
interesting new products to try.
In Chapters 6 and 7, I describe various commonly used vegetarian ingredi-
ents, and I give advice about shopping and stocking your vegetarian kitchen.
Mixing in some kitchen wisdom
If the idea of fixing meatless meals is new to you, harboring some concerns 
about your ability to plan and prepare good-tasting meals is understandable. 
Until you’ve had some experience, you may mistakenly believe that living 
vegetarian means buying lots of specialty products or spending hours slaving 
over the stove.
Not true. Going vegetarian — done well — will simplify your life in many 
ways. You’ll have fewer greasy pans to wash, and your stove and oven should 
stay cleaner longer. Foods that contain fewer animal ingredients are likely to 
be less of a food safety concern than those that contain meat, eggs, and dairy 
products.
And living vegetarian costs less.
 
Of course, you can spend as much time and money as you want to on your 
meals. Living vegetarian, though, is all about basic foods prepared simply. The 
staples — fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans — are generally inexpensive 
and easy to use.

21
 Chapter 1: Vegetarianism 101: Starting with the Basics
Cooking creatively
Vegetarian meals invite creativity.
After you’re free of the idea that a meal has to be built around a slab of meat, 
the variety really begins. After all, you can put together plant ingredients to 
make a meal in an almost endless number of ways. Plant ingredients come in 
varied colors, textures, and flavors. The sampling of recipes I include in this 
book (see Part III for these recipes) are an introduction to what’s possible. 
Don’t hesitate to experiment with these — add a favorite herb or substitute 
Swiss chard for kale.
You’ll soon be spoiled by the variety and quality of vegetarian meals. After 
you’ve practiced living vegetarian for a while, you’ll find that you don’t have 
space on your plate for meat anymore, even if you still eat it! The vegetarian 
foods are so much more interesting and appealing.
Embracing a Meat-Free Lifestyle
At this point, you may be distracted by such thoughts as, “I need a degree in 
nutrition to get this right,” or, “I wonder whether I’ll be vegetarian enough.” 
Your mind may be leaping ahead to such concerns as, “Will my family go along 
with this?” In this section, I help you put issues like these into perspective.
Taking charge of your plate
You have no reason to be afraid to stop eating meat. I haven’t touched a ham-
burger in more than 35 years, and I’m alive and well.
In the opening of his book Baby and Child Care, Dr. Benjamin Spock  wrote 
these famous words: “Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.” 
You may not have studied the Krebs cycle or be able to calculate your caloric 
needs, but if you’re reading this book, you probably have enough gumption 
to get your diet mostly right.
Mostly right is usually good enough.
 
The science of nutrition is complicated, but being well nourished is a fairly 
simple matter. It may sound strange coming from a nutritionist, but you really 
have no need to worry about nutrition on a vegetarian diet. Vegetarian diets 
aren’t lacking in necessary nutrients.

22
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Poor nutrition is a function of lifestyle — vegetarian or not. The greatest 
threats? Junk foods and a lack of time to fix the foods you need most to sup-
port health — particularly fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
Your public persona: Affirming your choice
Vegetarianism has become mainstream in many places in recent years. If 
you live in an urban setting or near a college town, chances are good that a 
number of your friends or coworkers are vegetarians of one sort or another.
Other people aren’t so lucky. If you find yourself feeling isolated because 
you’re the only vegetarian you know, keep a few points in mind:
 
✓ You’re 1 in 40, more or less — only about 2 to 3 percent of the popula-
tion is truly vegetarian. If you feel a little different, it’s because you are. 
You’d fit right in if you lived in India or any other culture in which veg-
etarianism has been a tradition for thousands  of years.
 
✓ You alone decide what to eat. You may be different from most people, 
but you should feel confident in your decision to live a vegetarian life-
style. It’s better for your health and the environment, and it’s a nonvio-
lent choice. A vegetarian diet is the thinking person’s diet.
 
✓ You owe no one an explanation. Stand tall and take comfort in knowing 
that you’re on the cutting edge of the nutritional curve.
Cohabitating harmoniously
 
The most important things to do if you want your partner, children, parents — 
or anybody else you live with — to be happy in a vegetarian household are:
 
✓ Take a low-key approach. Arguing, chastising, and cajoling are seldom 
effective in gaining buy-in from other people. In fact, being pushy is 
likely to give you the opposite result. Explain your rationale to adults 
and older children, and then let them decide for themselves what they 
will or won’t eat.
 
✓ Model the preferred behavior. The choices you make and the way in 
which you live send the most compelling — and noticeable — message.
Vegetarian diets are a great idea for kids. Establishing health-supporting 
eating habits early in life can help your children maintain good eating habits 
into adulthood. I include detailed information about managing the nutritional 
aspects of vegetarian diets for kids of all ages in Part V.

23
 Chapter 1: Vegetarianism 101: Starting with the Basics
Setting realistic expectations
Making any lifestyle change requires you to master new skills and change 
longstanding habits, and that takes time. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you 
experience a few occasional setbacks.
 
Experiment with new recipes, try vegetarian foods in restaurants, and invite 
friends to your house for meals. Read all you can about meal planning and 
vegetarian nutrition. With practice and time, you’ll gain confidence and get 
comfortable with your new lifestyle. Think of this as a long-term goal — it took 
me several years before I felt like an expert at it.
Educating yourself with 
reliable information
This book gives you a solid introduction to all things vegetarian, but don’t 
stop here. It’s helpful to hear (or read, or view) the same subject matter pre-
sented differently by different sources. It takes most people several rounds 
before they absorb and understand a new subject well.
I mention good resources throughout this book, but I also list several of the 
best all-around resources for vegetarians of any skill level in the upcoming 
sections.
The Vegetarian Resource Group
The Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) is a U.S. nonprofit  organization that 
educates the public about the interrelated issues of health, nutrition, ecol-
ogy, ethics, and world hunger. The group publishes the bimonthly Vegetarian 
Journal and provides numerous other printed materials for consumers and 
health professionals. The organization provides the materials free of charge 
or at a modest cost in bulk, and many are available in Spanish. VRG’s health 
and nutrition materials are peer-reviewed by registered dietitians and physi-
cians. VRG also advocates for progressive changes in U.S. food and nutrition 
policy. (Full disclosure: I’ve served as a nutrition adviser to VRG for about 25 
years.)
You can reach VRG at P.O. Box 1463, Baltimore, MD 21203; phone 410-366-

The North American Vegetarian Society (NAVS) is best known for its annual 
vegetarian conference, Summerfest, which is often held in Johnstown, 
Pennsylvania in July. This casual, family-oriented conference draws an inter-
national crowd of 400 to 600 people with diverse interests. Nonvegetarians 
are welcome. Summerfest is an excellent opportunity to sample fabulous 
vegetarian foods, meet other vegetarians, attend lectures, and pick up materi-
als from a variety of vegetarian organizations. The group also publishes The 
Vegetarian Voice, a newsletter for members.
You can contact NAVS at P.O. Box 72, Dolgeville, NY 13329; phone 518-568-

Chapter 2
Vegetarians Are Sprouting Up All 
Over: Why Meatless Makes Sense
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing a vegetarian diet for your good health
▶ Rejecting meat to help save the planet
▶ Becoming a vegetarian for ethical reasons
S
ometimes, what you don’t know won’t hurt you. Other times, what you 
do know can help you and others . . . a lot.
Vegetarian diets are like that. You can find many compelling reasons why 
living vegetarian is a good thing to do. One of those reasons may pique your 
interest, and after you discover more, other reasons may reinforce your 
resolve. When you think about it from all angles, a vegetarian diet makes a lot 
of sense.
 
What you eat is a highly personal decision. Many factors, including a variety of 
psychological and social issues, affect your capacity to make changes in your 
lifestyle. That’s why many people who adopt a vegetarian lifestyle see their 
diet evolve over time. Consider the rationale for adopting a vegetarian diet, 
and do what you can to move in that direction at a pace that’s right for you.
In this chapter, I share some details about the prevalence of vegetarianism. I 
describe how eating a vegetarian diet promotes your overall health and the 
health of the planet. I also explain why ethics and compassion for animals 
compel many people to make the switch. In Chapter 5, I share some addi-
tional advice on how to help you along in the transition to being meat-free.

You’re in Good Company
Contemplating a move to a more plant-based diet? You’re not alone. In fact, 
you may be among an elite group of deep thinkers with the determination it 
takes to live a lifestyle outside cultural norms. That takes courage and tenac-
ity, but it’s a decision more people are making.
The percentage of people in the U.S. who are consistently vegetarian has 
remained relatively constant for decades. That figure stands at about 2 to 3 
percent of the adult population, according to polls conducted for the non-
profit Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG).
Within those figures, though, the number of people eating a vegan diet con-
tinues to rise, especially among younger vegetarians, according to survey 
data collected for more than ten years for the VRG. The VRG estimates that 
one third to one half of all vegetarians in the U.S. eat a vegan diet free of all 
animal products, including meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, and 
byproducts of these foods. For information about these surveys, check out 
www.vrg.org/nutshell/faq.htm#poll.
Among nonvegetarians, the number of people actively cutting back on 
their meat intake is also increasing, fueling the explosion of meatless food 
products in supermarkets and the regular sight of vegetarian options on 
mainstream restaurant menus. A 2006 poll conducted for the VRG found that 
nearly 7 percent of people in the U.S. say they never eat red meat.
Famous vegetarians yesterday and today
If you’re thinking about going vegetarian, you 
may be interested to know that you’re joining 
an illustrious group of like-minded individuals.
Considering the small number of people who 
are consistently vegetarian, it’s remarkable 
how many well-known personalities through-
out history have chosen the vegetarian lifestyle. 
The list includes philosophers, artists, intellec-
tuals, entertainers, political leaders, sports fig-
ures, and many more. (I cover vegetarian diets 
for athletes in Chapter 22.)
The following list includes some of the better-
known people throughout the centuries who 
have advocated a vegetarian lifestyle:
 ✓ Hank Aaron: Professional baseball player
 ✓ Louisa May Alcott: Author
 ✓ Susan B. Anthony: Suffragist
 ✓ David Bowie: Rock musician
 ✓ Berke Breathed: Cartoonist
 ✓ Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, scientist, inventor
 ✓ Isadora Duncan: Dancer
 ✓ Thomas Edison: Inventor
 ✓ Albert Einstein: Physicist

Supporting Your Health 
with a Plant-Based Diet
Scientific consensus today — supported by a large body of research — 
indicates that vegetarian diets generally support health and confer health 
benefits. That doesn’t mean vegetarian diets are foolproof or the Fountain of 
Youth; if your vegetarian diet largely consists of soda and French fries, you 
likely won’t see any health benefits. But if you follow my basic guidelines for 
a healthful, meat-free diet, you’ll decrease your risk for disease and promote 
your overall health.
 
People often worried in the past about whether vegetarians could get the 
nutrients they need from a diet without meat, but the tables are turned today. 
The riskier diet is the one that isn’t vegetarian.
Protecting yourself from disease
In recent years, the U.S. government, in its “Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans,” as well as Health Canada and leading health organizations, have 
issued statements acknowledging that well-planned vegetarian diets meet 
nutritional needs and support health. In fact, vegetarian diets are associated

with lower risk for many chronic diseases and conditions, including coronary 
artery disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, some forms of cancer, obesity, 
and others.
It’s not hard to understand why.
Vegetarian diets tend  to be lower in saturated fat than nonvegetarian diets. 
Although you can find saturated fat in some plants, saturated fats come pri-
marily from animal products, particularly high-fat dairy foods and meats. In 
fact, two-thirds of the fat in dairy products is saturated fat. Even so-called 
low-fat dairy products contain a substantial amount of saturated fat.
 
Saturated fats are usually firm at room temperature, like a stick of butter. That 
fact can help you identify foods that may be high in the artery-clogging fats. 
Foods that   are high in saturated fat include red meats, the skin on poultry, 
butter, sour cream, ice cream, cheese, yogurt made with whole milk, 2 percent 
milk, and 3.3 percent whole milk.
Saturated fats stimulate  the body to produce more cholesterol. Cholesterol is 
a waxy substance found in plaque in diseased arteries. Everyone needs some 
cholesterol, but the human body manufactures a sufficient amount. You 
don’t need more from outside sources, and for people with a predisposition 
 for coronary artery disease, high blood cholesterol levels may contribute   to 
hardening of the arteries.
 
Cholesterol is produced in the liver, so it’s found only in animal products. 
Foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. (Have you ever seen a lima bean 
 with a liver?)
 
Lacto ovo vegetarian diets have   the potential to be high in saturated fat and 
cholesterol if you don’t limit the eggs and high-fat dairy products you eat. If 
you switch to a lacto ovo vegetarian diet, try not to rely too heavily on these 
foods to replace the meat you   once ate. (Chapter 1 has definitions of lacto ovo 
and other kinds of vegetarianism.)
Getting more of what you need — 
and less of what you don’t
Vegetarian diets are slimming. In general, vegetarians  eat more filling, low-
calorie foods, such as fruits and vegetables, than nonvegetarians do. Dietary 
fiber makes vegetarian foods bulky. Dietary fiber is the part of a  plant that’s 
only partially digested by your body, or not digested at all. When you eat 
fiber-rich foods, you tend to get full before you take in too many calories. In 
that way, foods that are rich in fiber help to control your weight. Read on for 
more details about the benefits of dietary fiber as well as protein and phyto-
chemicals! All these nutrients play important roles in supporting your health.

29
 Chapter 2: Vegetarians Are Sprouting Up All Over: Why Meatless Makes Sense
Fiber
Dietary fiber does more than help control your weight. It brings several other 
health benefits, too. For example, fiber can bind with environmental contami-
nants and help them pass out of the body. Fiber also decreases the amount of 
time it takes for waste material to pass out of the body, so potentially harmful 
substances have less time to be in contact with the lining of your   intestines.
If you get plenty of fiber in your diet, you’re less likely to have constipation, 
hemorrhoids, and varicose veins. Getting plenty of fiber (and water) in your 
diet also keeps your stools large and soft and easy to pass. You don’t have to 
strain and exert a lot of pressure to have a bowel movement.
 
Eating a high-fiber vegetarian diet may prevent you from developing diverticu-
losis, a condition marked by  herniations or small outpocketings in the large 
intestine. These pouches can fill with debris and become inflamed, a serious 
and painful disease called diverticulitis.
Diets high in fiber are associated  with lower rates of colon cancer and coro-
nary artery disease than diets low in fiber. If you have diabetes, you can 
better control  your blood sugar by eating a diet that’s high in fiber, too.
 
On average, Americans get about 16 grams of fiber in their diets each day — 
that’s about half the recommended amount. Vegetarians typically get much 
more — up to double the amount. Vegans get more fiber than most lacto ovo 
vegetarians. One cup of oatmeal contains 8 grams of fiber, a medium pear 
with skin has 4 grams of fiber, a cup of vegetarian chili has 14 grams of fiber, 
a slice of whole wheat bread contains 2 grams of fiber, and a cup of chopped, 
steamed broccoli has 6 grams of fiber.
Current dietary recommendations  call for fiber intakes of at least 14 grams 
for every 1,000 calories you eat each day. That means most people need at 
least 25 to 35 grams of fiber daily. It’s also important to drink plenty of fluids, 
particularly water, when your fiber intake is high.
Protein
Most vegetarians get enough protein, but they don’t overdo  it, and this mod-
eration has its benefits. When you moderate your protein intake, you help 
to conserve your body’s stores of calcium (I tell you more about the rela-
tionship between protein and calcium in Chapter 3). Diets that are too high 
in protein, especially protein from animal sources, cause the kidneys to let 
 more calcium pass into the urine. Meat protein is high in sulfur-containing 
amino acids that, when metabolized, result in higher acid levels in the body. 
To neutralize or buffer some of the excessive acid, calcium is leached from 
the bones and excreted in the urine.

30
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Speaking of your kidneys, when you moderate  your protein intake by 
eating a vegetarian diet, you also cause less wear and tear on your kidneys. 
Vegetarians have fewer kidney stones and less kidney disease than nonvege-
tarians. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a little less than a half gram of pro-
tein for every pound you weigh. A 120-pound person, for example, should get 
about 44 grams of protein per day. High intakes of animal protein are linked 
with higher blood cholesterol levels and more coronary artery disease, as 
well as a greater incidence  of some  types of cancer.
Phytochemicals
Vegetarian diets are rich in the plant components called phytochemicals that 
promote and protect human health. Conversely, meat is low in beneficial phy-
tochemicals such as antioxidants and high in the oxidants that cause your 
body to produce detrimental free radicals.
The more animal products you include in your diet, the less room you have 
for plant matter. Whether or not you make the transition to a fully vegetarian 
diet, you can benefit   greatly from dramatically increasing the ratio of plant 
to animal products in your diet (Figure 2-1 shows a typical American diet and 
the vegetarian goal).

In case you’re wondering, free radicals aren’t renegades from the ’60s; they’re 
molecules produced as a byproduct  of your body’s normal metabolism. 
They’re also produced when you’re exposed to environmental contaminants 
such as air pollution and ozone, sunlight and X-rays, and certain dietary com-
ponents such as fat and the form of iron found in meat. Free radicals speed 
up the aging process by damaging your cells. They can impair your immune 
system   and cause numerous diseases and illnesses.

 Chapter 2: Vegetarians Are Sprouting Up All Over: Why Meatless Makes Sense
Saving the Planet One Forkful at a Time
Choosing to live vegetarian doesn’t just benefit your body. When you choose 
a vegetarian lifestyle, you contribute to the health of the whole planet.
 
All things considered, vegetarian diets make more efficient use of land, water, 
and fossil fuel resources than diets that give prominence to meat, eggs, and 
dairy   products.
Soil sense
You and I have to take care of the land, or our land won’t be able to take care 
of us. Animal agriculture — raising animals for human use — places a heavy 
burden on the land.
Unfortunately, the amount of land resources needed to raise animals for their 
meat is far greater than the amount needed to grow enough plant matter to 
feed the same number of people directly.
Livestock grazing causes desertification by eroding the topsoil and drying out 
the land, preventing it from supporting plant life. Topsoil is being depleted 
faster than it can be created. Healthy, abundant supplies of topsoil help 
ensure we have enough arable land to grow the food  we need to survive.
The appetite for meat and other animal products also consumes trees and for-
ests, although these trees may not be the ones in your own backyard or your 
neighbor’s. Much of the deforestation happens in Central America and South 
America, where the number of acres of tropical rain forest cleared to make way 
for grazing cattle is so big that it’s hard to comprehend its enormity.
Worrying less about food safety
Vegetarians are less likely than nonvegetarians 
to be affected by food-borne illnesses carried 
by animal products. Listeria and salmonella 
are types of bacteria found in meats and other 
animal   products. A good dose of either can 
cause severe illness at best and death at worst. 
Many cases thought to be the “24-hour flu” are 
 actually caused by a food-borne pathogen from 
an animal product. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 
also known as CJD or mad cow disease, is a 
progressive and fatal disease that causes brain 
tissue in humans and animals to become spongy 
and porous; the animal or person literally loses 
its mind. Mad cow disease has been found in 
U.S. and Canadian cattle. Safety measures to 
protect other cattle from becoming infected 
are routinely disregarded and aren’t effectively 
monitored or enforced by governments.

32
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
Think of tropical rain forests as  the planet’s lungs. One of the many ways that 
trees help keep the world healthy is by exchanging the carbon dioxide emitted 
by humans for the fresh oxygen  we need to survive. If you didn’t have trees, 
you’d be huffing and puffing as though you had reached the summit of Mount 
Everest; “breathing through a straw” is how mountain climbers describe the 
feeling of thinning oxygen. Losing a large percentage of the earth’s rain forests 
has repercussions for every corner of  the planet.
 
In deforestation, many  species of plants and animals are wiped out. These 
plants and animals hold the keys to scientific discoveries that may benefit 
humankind. Plants and animals of the rain forests are on the front line, but 
eventually, the assault on them will reach all of us.
Wasting water
When you look at a map of the earth, you see a lot of blue. It’s hard  to imag-
ine that the earth could be short of water anytime soon. The planet does 
have a lot of saltwater in the oceans, but one of the greatest threats of animal 
agriculture is to supplies of fresh water.
You can’t drink saltwater. The aquifers that lie deep below the earth’s sur-
face hold the fresh water needed to irrigate farmland and for drinking. Those 
giant pools of fresh water are dwindling rapidly because people are sucking 
up great quantities of the stuff to irrigate huge tracts of land to graze animals 
that provide a relatively small amount of food. What an inefficient use of a 
resource as precious as our fresh water!
Furthermore, animal agriculture is polluting both fresh water and saltwater. 
Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used to grow feed for animals are con-
taminating water supplies, and nitrogenous fecal waste produced by animals 
Meat costs even more than you think!
If the true cost   to society of producing animal 
products for human consumption were passed 
on to consumers, fewer people could afford to 
put these foods on the dinner table as often as 
they do today. Fortunately, though, for people 
with a hankering for ham and eggs, government 
agricultural policies subsidize and protect the 
production of many of these foods to keep busi-
nesses and consumers satisfied with low prices. 
Of course, the costs don’t go away — they’re 
only deferred or shifted. As I point out in this 
chapter, the production and distribution of animal 
products makes intensive use of our nonrenew-
able natural resources and creates byproducts 
that contaminate our water, air, and soil and 
harm our health. The cost of meat is sort of like 
the cost of tobacco to society, which everyone 
shares in the dollars we spend on healthcare. As 
someone once said, “You can pay me now, or 
you can pay me later.”

33
 Chapter 2: Vegetarians Are Sprouting Up All Over: Why Meatless Makes Sense
washes into streams, rivers, lakes, and bays. The planet has less clean water 
than it used to, and the creatures  that live in that water are becoming con-
taminated or are being killed off by the pollution.
Filching fossil fuels
Animal agriculture is ransacking our planet of fossil fuels. The production of 
meat, eggs, and dairy products requires intensive use of fossil fuels — includ-
ing oil, coal, and natural gas — for everything from transporting animal feed 
and the animals themselves to running farm machinery and operating the 
factory-homes where animals are raised. Fossil fuels are also used to make 
synthetic fertilizers used on factory farms.
Unlike wind, solar, and geothermal sources of energy, fossil fuels aren’t read-
ily renewable. After we use our supplies, they’re gone. Byproducts such as 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide created by burning fossil fuels for energy 
also contribute to global warming. Other pollutants, such as methyl mercury 
from coal-burning power plants, find their way into our water supply, air, and 
soil and harm the health of humans and other living things.
Considering the Ethics
Of course, choosing a vegetarian diet isn’t just about improving your  own 
health and well-being. When you adopt a vegetarian diet, you also help to 
diminish the pain and suffering of those without a voice.
Philosophically speaking
Some of the world’s greatest thinkers  and philosophers chose or advocated 
a vegetarian lifestyle, including Pythagoras, Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, and 
Benjamin Franklin.
For some people, a vegetarian lifestyle stems from religious or spiritual 
teachings. Some Christians, for example, interpret the passage Genesis 1:29 
from the Old Testament to mean that humans should eat a vegetarian diet: 
“And God said, behold, I have given you every herb-bearing seed, which is 
upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree 
yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.”

34
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Members of   the Seventh-day Adventist Church are encouraged to follow a veg-
etarian diet, and about half of them do. The Trappist monks, who are Catholic, 
are also vegetarians, and numerous Eastern religions or philosophies, includ-
ing Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism, also advocate vegetarianism.
Vegetarianism is also an ethical choice. Hunger is a good example. For most 
people in the U.S., being hungry is a temporary state of being — the result of 
skipping  a meal because you were in a rush to get out the door in the morn-
ing, for example. For less fortunate people in the world, however, hunger is a 
state of slow starvation with no next meal or snack in sight.
World hunger is complicated in terms of ethics, politics, and economics. 
Many people choose a vegetarian lifestyle as a way of contributing to the 
fight against world hunger. In the same sense of knowing that one’s lone vote 
really does count, many people choose to cast their vote in favor of a diet 
and lifestyle that can sustain the most people.
 
In the simplest sense, eating foods directly from the soil — fruits, vegetables, 
grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds — can nourish many more people than can be 
fed if the plant matter is fed first to animals and then people eat the animals.
But the appetite of affluent nations for meat and other animal products also 
creates a market in poor countries for the resources  needed to produce 
those foods. The result is that in developing nations, those with power often 
grow cash crops or livestock feed for export, instead of growing less profit-
able crops that might feed the local people.
Understanding animal rights 
and animal welfare
Inhumane treatment of animals compels many people to adopt a vegetarian 
lifestyle. They consider a meatless diet to be the compassionate choice.
If you share your life with dogs or cats, you know that animals have  feelings. 
You probably also know that cattle, chickens, and pigs don’t live in idyllic 
pastures and barnyards anymore. They live and die in factory farms and 
slaughterhouses, the likes of which would rival any horror movie.
Male calves born to dairy cows, for  instance, are taken from their mothers and 
raised in confinement for veal. Chickens raised for their eggs live in factory-
farm conditions in which they are routinely subjected to debeaking — the 
practice of using a machine to cut off the end of a chicken’s beak to reduce the 
pecking damage caused when crowded chickens lash out at one another.

 Chapter 2: Vegetarians Are Sprouting Up All Over: Why Meatless Makes Sense
The part we see is the neat and tidy packages of legs and shoulders on 
Styrofoam plates wrapped in plastic. As morbid as it sounds, the meat coun-
ter is the grocery store morgue.
Suffice it to say, some people do allow themselves to think about how ani-
mals are treated. They put themselves in the hooves and claws of other crea-
tures, and they take a stand for nonviolence.
In addition to avoiding meat, fish, and poultry, many vegetarians avoid the 
use of all other animal products. In part, that’s  because many animal byprod-
ucts, such as leather and wool, subsidize the meat industry. The production 
of other animal products, such as eggs, milk, and other dairy products, is 
also seen as exploiting those animals, subjecting them to inhumane condi-
tions and treatment, and supporting the meat industry.

o you have the old Basic Four Food Groups branded on your frontal

cium, and iron, does your mind reflexively retrieve images of rib-eye steaks, 
cheese wheels, and tall glasses of frothy white cow’s milk?
I understand.
You may be savvy enough to know that you can find other food sources of 
key nutrients, but it’s hard to change your mind-set in a culture in which 
animal products have held center stage for generations.
That’s why I devote this chapter to some basic nutrition issues. The infor-
mation that follows helps to clear up questions and concerns you may have 
about the nutritional adequacy of a diet that limits or excludes foods of 
animal origin.

38
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Consuming Enough Protein 
on a Vegetarian Diet
In all my years of practice as a nutritionist, the number one question people 
ask about vegetarian diets hasn’t changed. They want to know, “Where do 
you get your protein?”
And you know what? Protein is the nutrient about which vegetarians have the 
least reason to worry.
Even so, it’s not hard to understand why people do worry about protein. In 
the first grade, your teacher probably made you cut out pictures of protein-
containing foods from magazines and paste them onto poster board. You 
and your classmates collected pictures of hamburgers, hot dogs, pot roasts, 
and pizza. Likely absent from that poster were pictures of baked beans and 
brown rice.
 
In North America and much of the developed world, a cultural bias exists that 
places the highest value on protein from animal sources. The food industry — 
in close collaboration with the government — perpetuates policies and prac-
tices that maintain the status quo for complex political and economic reasons.
However, getting most or all of your protein from plant sources instead of 
from animals is easy and desirable.
In this section, I help you loosen your grip on some misconceptions about 
the role of protein in human health and tell you all you need to know about 
protein in meatless diets.
Examining protein facts
To understand how vegetarian diets deliver the protein you need, you first 
need a solid grasp on what protein is and how your body uses it. That will 
help illuminate the misunderstandings that persist concerning vegetarian 
diets and protein.
 
The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of first importance.” 
Protein was the first material identified as  being a vital part of all living organ-
isms. Proteins make up the basic structure of all living cells, and they’re a 
component of hormones, enzymes, and antibodies.

39
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
Most of the protein in your body is  in your muscles, but you also have pro-
tein in your bones, teeth, blood, and other body fluids. The collagen in con-
nective tissue is a protein, and so is the keratin in hair. The casein in milk, 
albumin in eggs, blood albumin, and hemoglobin are all examples of proteins.
 
Protein is a vital part of all living tissues. Proteins are nitrogen-containing 
compounds that break down into amino acids during digestion. Amino acids 
are the building blocks of   proteins and have other functions in the body as 
well. Essential amino acids are amino acids that the body can’t manufacture. 
There are nine of them, and you have to get them from your food.
Most plants contain protein, and some are rich sources. Vegetables, grains, 
legumes, seeds, and nuts all contain protein. Examples of vegetarian foods 
that are good sources of protein include
 
✓ Barbecued tempeh
 
✓ Bean burritos
 
✓ Bean soup
 
✓ Cereal and soymilk
 
✓ Falafel (garbanzo bean balls)
 
✓ Lentil soup
 
✓ Oatmeal
 
✓ Pasta primavera
 
✓ Red beans and rice
 
✓ Tofu lasagna
 
✓ Vegetable stir-fry
 
✓ Vegetarian chili
 
✓ Vegetarian pizza
 
✓ Veggie burgers
Plants contain all the essential amino acids in varying amounts. Some plants 
are high in some essential amino acids and  low in others. Getting enough of 
what you need is easy to do, even if you eat nothing but plant-based foods 
and your diet contains no meat, eggs, or dairy products at all.
In fact, as long as you get enough calories to meet your energy needs, it’s 
nearly impossible to be deficient in protein. If you ate nothing but potatoes 
but ate enough potatoes to meet your energy needs, you’d still get all the 
essential amino acids you need. Now, I don’t recommend a potato-only diet. 

40
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
You need other nutrients from food besides protein, and no one food has 
them all. That’s why it’s important to include a reasonable variety of foods in 
your diet.
 
However, the practical fact about protein and essential amino acids is that if 
you eat enough vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds (or a reasonable 
variety of most of those foods), you’ll meet or exceed your need for all the 
essential amino acids.
Debunking old rules about 
complementary proteins
Despite what you may have  heard or read, you don’t have to consciously 
combine foods or complement proteins to make sure you get enough protein 
on a vegetarian diet. The old practice of complementing proteins was based 
on solid science, but the conclusions that nutritionists drew — and the rec-
ommendations they gave — were faulty.
Here’s how the idea of complementary proteins works:
Because plant foods are limited in one or more of the essential amino acids, 
vegetarians have to combine a food that’s limited in an amino acid with 
a food that has an abundance of that same amino acid. The concept is to 
complement one plant food’s amino acid profile with another’s, fitting the 
foods together like puzzle pieces. That way, you have a complete protein, with 
adequate amounts of all the essential amino acids available to the body at 
the same time.
Nutritionists created complex protein complementary charts that detailed 
the way foods should be combined, and vegetarians had to be careful to eat 
their beans with rice or corn and to add milk or cheese to their grains (maca-
roni and cheese was a big favorite). It was complicated, and the practice 
made it seem as though vegetarians lived on the brink of nutritional peril if 
they didn’t get the balance right.
Welcome to the new millennium.
 
Combining the amino acids in foods is no longer recognized as something 
vegetarians have to do consciously. Your body can do that for you, just like 
numerous other nutrient interactions that occur without your active interven-
tion. Your job is to do two  things:

41
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
 
✓ Make sure you get enough calories to meet your energy needs.
 
✓ Eat a reasonable variety of foods over the course of the day.
That’s really all there is to it.
 
Even though it’s not necessary to get all essential amino acids in one food, it’s 
interesting to note that soybeans do contain all the essential amino acids. Soy 
can actually serve as the sole source of protein in a person’s diet if that were 
necessary for some   reason.
Getting the protein you need: 
It’s easy to do
Really, you don’t have to worry about  your protein intake.
Okay, if you live on snack cakes and soda, maybe you can end up protein-
deficient. But you’d be lacking many vitamins and minerals and other phyto-
chemicals, too. Nevertheless, I know that some of you want to know precisely 
how much protein you need, so here’s a simple way to figure it out:
 
The rule of thumb for determining recommended protein intake is to aim for 
0.8 gram of   protein for every kilogram of your body weight. One kilogram is 
equal to 2.2 pounds. That’s body weight (in kilograms) times 0.8 = grams of 
protein needed. This formula has a generous margin of error worked into it. In 
reality, your body actually requires less than this amount. (An exception may 
be protein requirements for vegans. Although there is no consensus on this 
point, many vegan nutritionists think vegans should use a factor of 0.9 or even 
1.0 to compensate for the lower digestibility of plant proteins.)
So, for example, if you weigh 120 pounds, that equals about 54.5 kilograms 
(120 pounds divided by 2.2 kilograms). Multiply 54.5 kilograms by 0.8 grams 
of protein, and you get 43.6 grams of protein, or approximately 44 grams of 
protein. That’s how much protein you r body would need each day, and it 
isn’t hard to get.
To see how easy it is to get the protein you need, take a look at the list of 
foods and their  protein contents in Table 3-1. Think about what you eat each 
day and the portion sizes. Calculate your own protein requirement using this 
formula and compare it to the amount of protein you eat in a typical day:
Your weight in pounds _____ ÷ 2.2 kilograms = _____ your weight in kilo-
grams × 0.8 grams protein = _____ your daily protein requirement

Avoiding protein pitfalls
 Given the attention protein gets, you’d think that there’s a looming threat of 
deficiency. In truth, many people are at risk from getting too much protein.
An excessively high intake of sulfur-containing amino acids may cause you to 
lose calcium from your bones. Foods high in sulfur-containing amino acids 
include eggs, meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, nuts, and grains.
 
Eating red meat and processed meat is associated with a greater risk of 
colorectal cancer, and meat consumption has been found in some studies to 
increase the risk of breast cancer, too. Too much protein in your diet may also 
put undue stress on your kidneys.
Vegetarian diets typically contain enough protein, without providing too 
much. Avoiding excessive amounts of protein — and animal products rich in 
protein — has definite health  advantages.
Moooove Over Milk
Dogs do it. Deer do it. Cows do it. Even chipmunks and raccoons do it. They 
all produce milk for their babies. So do humans.
But dogs don’t drink chipmunk milk. And deer don’t drink raccoon milk. 
That’s because milk is species-specific. The  milk of each species is tailor-
made for its own kind.
So how did people start drinking milk from cows? Even adult cows don’t 
drink cow’s milk.
It’s an odd state of affairs when you think about it.
Milk is a concentrated source of calcium, and calcium is an essential nutrient 
for human health. That part is true.
But humans, like all mammals, have no need for milk after infancy. Your body 
is designed after infancy to get your calcium from other sources in your diet, 
like plants. Young children gradually stop producing lactase, an enzyme pres-
ent in infancy that permits babies to digest the milk sugar lactose.
 
By adulthood, most people — with the exception of Caucasians — no longer 
produce lactase and have a limited ability to digest milk. This natural condi-
tion is called lactose intolerance. Most of the world’s adults are lactose intoler-
ant to some extent, including the majority of blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Native 
Americans, and people of Mediterranean descent.

45
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
When people who are lactose intolerant drink milk or eat other dairy prod-
ucts, they often experience symptoms such as gas, bloating, nausea, and diar-
rhea. An exception is people of North European ancestry who are thought 
to have inherited a genetic mutation that allows them to digest milk even as 
adults.
In our culture — and throughout much of the developed world — powerful 
dairy industry interests, in collaboration with local, state or provincial, and 
federal governments, strongly advocate milk consumption for complex politi-
cal and economic reasons.
They do it despite the fact that most of the world’s adults don’t digest milk 
very well. They also push milk despite other health consequences — milk is 
high in sodium and artery-clogging saturated fat, and it’s devoid of beneficial 
phytochemicals and the dietary fiber largely absent in most people’s diets.
In this section, I explain what you need to know about getting calcium the 
way nature intended — on a vegetarian diet.
Determining who needs milk: The bones of 
current dietary recommendations
Cow’s milk is rich in several nutrients, including protein, calcium, potassium, 
vitamin B12, riboflavin, and others. With the exception of B12, these are all 
also found in ample amounts in plant foods.
 
But the push to drink cow’s milk is most closely tied to recommendations for 
calcium intake. Government recommendations for calcium intake are rela-
tively high to compensate for calcium you lose because of other dietary fac-
tors. In most affluent countries, for example, high protein intakes from animal 
products and high sodium intakes from junk foods and processed foods cause 
calcium to leach out of the body. That, in turn, causes scientists to ratchet 
up recommended calcium intakes, which reinforces the idea that you need 
calcium supplements or super-concentrated food sources of calcium, such as 
dairy products.
It’s a Catch-22.
 
When you eat a healthful vegetarian diet (as opposed to a junk-food vegetarian 
diet!), you may protect yourself against the dietary factors that cause less 
thoughtful eaters to risk their calcium stores.

46
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Understanding the calcium connection
Calcium is vital to a healthy body. Too little calcium in your diet can make 
you a prime candidate  for health problems like osteoporosis, the condition 
that results when the bones begin to waste away and become porous and 
brittle. Bones in this condition are susceptible to fractures. In the most 
severe cases, the bones can break with the slightest stress, such as a 
sneeze or a cough. Osteoporosis is a major health problem that can have 
life-threatening consequences.
Vegetarians around the world appear to have rates of osteoporosis that are 
the same as, or lower than, those of nonvegetarians. Still, osteoporosis is a 
very complex disease influenced by many factors, including lifestyle, diet, 
and genetics. (Your specific risk for osteoporosis needs to be assessed on an 
individual basis.)
Factors associated with vegetarian diets — low intake of animal protein, mod-
eration of protein intake in general, and higher intake of soy protein, potas-
sium, and vitamin K, for example — may protect against osteoporosis among 
vegetarians. On the other hand, too-low intakes of protein, vitamin D, and 
calcium, and lower estrogen levels in vegetarian women, may be risk factors 
for osteoporosis for some vegetarians.
Making sure you get enough calcium
All vegetarians should err on the side of caution and aim for meeting the 
levels of calcium intake recommended by the Institute of Medicine, a unit of 
the National Academy of Sciences. Most adults can meet these recommenda-
tions by following the meal-planning guidelines I include in Chapter 7.
 
Those recommendations call for at least 8 servings of calcium-rich foods each 
day. That’s not as much food as it may seem. Mountains of broccoli aren’t 
mandatory, but heaping helpings of green leafy vegetables, beans, and other 
good sources of calcium should be your habit.
Good plant sources of  calcium include broccoli, Chinese cabbage, legumes, 
almonds, sesame seeds, dried figs, and dark green, leafy vegetables such as 
kale, Swiss chard, collards, and mustard and turnip greens. Other sources are 
tofu processed with calcium and fortified soymilk or orange juice.
You have lots of delicious ways to work high-calcium foods into your meals. 
Here are some examples:
 
✓ Bean chili over rice with steamed broccoli and a chunk of cornbread
 
✓ Black bean dip with broccoli and cauliflower florets  and carrot sticks
 
✓ Falafel (garbanzo bean balls) in pita pockets and a glass of orange juice

✓ Fig cookies with a glass of fortified soymilk
 
✓ Green beans with slivered almonds
 
✓ Steamed kale with garlic and sesame seeds 
 
✓ Stir-fried Chinese vegetables with bean curd (tofu) over rice
Hanging on to the calcium you have
When it comes to your body’s calcium stores, what’s important is not only 
getting enough, but also hanging onto what you have.
Too much protein — especially from foods high in sulfur-containing amino 
acids — can make you lose calcium. Other aspects of your diet and lifestyle 
also make a difference, including
 
✓ Sodium: High intakes of sodium  make your body lose calcium. Table salt 
and processed foods contain lots of sodium, as do canned foods such as 
soups and condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce.
 
 You need some sodium, but you can get all you need from the sodium 
that naturally exists in the food supply. You don’t have to add sodium to 
foods. Read the labels on packaged foods and try to limit your sodium 
intake to no more than about 2,000 milligrams each day (1,500 milligrams 
is even better) — good advice for vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike.
 
✓ Phosphorus and caffeine: Too much phosphorus (found in red meats 
and soft drinks) causes the body  to lose calcium, as does the caffeine 
found in soft drinks, coffee, and tea. These factors have a lesser effect on 
calcium balance than do protein and  sodium, though.
 
✓ Phytates and oxalates: Substances such as phytates and oxalates, found 
in plant foods, inhibit  your body’s ability to absorb the calcium in the 
foods that contain them. Whole grains are high in phytates, and raw 
spinach is high in oxalates, making most of the calcium in these foods 
unavailable to your body. (Boiling spinach causes some of the oxalates 
to leach out into the cooking water, which can make the calcium more 
available to your body.)
 
 Overall, though, plant foods contain plenty of calcium that your body 
can absorb. In fact, some research shows that the body better absorbs 
the calcium in such plant foods as kale, Chinese cabbage, and broccoli 
than the calcium in cow’s milk.
 
✓ Physical activity: The more weight-bearing  exercise you include in your 
daily routine, the more calcium you’ll keep. People who walk regularly 
or engage in strength training by using a weight set have denser bones 
than people who are couch potatoes.
 
✓ Sunshine: Your body manufactures vitamin D when you’re exposed to 
sunlight, and vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium.

48
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
I should mention one   more factor that people often forget. Your body adjusts 
the absorption of many nutrients, including calcium, according to its needs. In 
other words, when you need more calcium, your body becomes more efficient 
at absorbing the calcium that’s present in your food. When you  need less cal-
cium, your body absorbs less, even if you flood yourself with calcium from 
dairy products or supplements.
Iron Issues
“Can you list three good food sources of iron?”
When I ask most people that question, they say, “Red meat,” and draw a 
blank after that. Like protein and calcium, most people associate  iron with an 
animal product. But also like protein and calcium, iron is widely available in 
foods of plant origin.
In this section, I explain what you need to know about getting the iron you 
need from a vegetarian diet.
Ironing out the basics
 
Iron is a mineral   that forms part of the hemoglobin of red blood cells and helps 
carry oxygen to the body’s cells. Iron is also part of the myoglobin that pro-
vides oxygen to the muscles in your body. When your iron stores are low or 
depleted, you can’t get enough oxygen  to your body’s cells. A form of anemia 
results, and you may feel very tired.
Before you begin yawning, you might like to know that vegetarians   aren’t 
more prone than nonvegetarians to iron deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia 
happens to be one of the most common nutritional deficiencies around the 
world, but most of it occurs in developing countries, not in affluent countries, 
and the cause is usually parasites, not diet. In affluent countries, iron defi-
ciency is most likely to affect children and young people, as well as pregnant 
and premenopausal women.
 
Vegetarians need more iron in their diets than nonvegetarians, because the 
iron from plants isn’t absorbed as efficiently as the iron from meat. That’s not 
a problem for vegetarians, though. Most get plenty of iron in their diets — in 
fact, they get more than nonvegetarians.

49
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
The recommended dietary allowances for iron vary by age   and sex. 
Generally, the recommendations   are higher for premenopausal women than 
for men and postmenopausal women, because women who menstruate lose 
more iron than women who don’t. The recommendations for adult men and 
postmenopausal women are only 8 milligrams per day, compared to 18 mil-
ligrams per day for premenopausal adult women.
It’s not practical, though, for most people to count the milligrams of iron in 
their diets. Rather than live life with a calculator in the palm of your hand, 
pay attention to including iron-rich foods in your diet regularly and do what 
you can to make sure the iron you do eat is well-absorbed. Keep reading as I 
explain how to do that.
Finding iron in plant foods
Iron is available everywhere you look in   the plant world. Rich sources include 
whole or enriched breads and cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds, some dried 
fruits, and dark green, leafy vegetables.
Introducing heme and nonheme iron
Iron comes in foods in two forms: heme and 
nonheme iron. The iron in meat, poultry, and 
fish is the heme form. The human body easily 
absorbs heme iron. In fact, when meat is pres-
ent in the diet, it increases the amount of iron 
that you absorb from plant foods as well. This 
characteristic doesn’t necessarily make heme 
iron a better source of iron, and it may even 
have drawbacks.
Iron is a potent oxidant that changes choles-
terol into a form that’s more readily absorbed by 
the arteries, leading to hardening of the arter-
ies, or coronary artery disease. For this reason, 
men — most of whom are at a higher risk of 
developing coronary artery disease than most 
women — are now advised not to take daily 
multivitamin and mineral supplements contain-
ing iron.
The form of iron found in plant foods is called 
nonheme iron. Nonheme iron is absorbed less 
efficiently than heme iron. However, certain 
other food components — which I discuss in 
the “Enhancers of iron absorption” section 
later in this chapter — can radically improve 
the body’s absorption of nonheme iron. These 
enhancers of iron absorption  in plant foods help 
vegetarians absorb the iron they need.

50
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
Many of the plant foods that are rich in calcium are also high in iron. The meal 
ideas that I list in the earlier section “Making sure you get enough calcium” 
also work if you’re trying to ensure that you get enough iron in your diet.
If you’re looking for additional iron-rich foods, consider the following:
 
✓ Broccoli
 
✓ Brussels sprouts
 
✓ Cabbage
 
✓ Cantaloupe
 
✓ Cauliflower
 
✓ Green peppers
 
✓ Onions
 
✓ Oranges
 
✓ Tomatoes
 
✓ Strawberries
Balancing inhibitors and enhancers of iron 
absorption
You may not realize it, but a game of tug of war over iron is going on in your 
body. That’s because certain substances in the foods you eat enhance iron 
absorption in your body, and other substances inhibit it. Most of the time, 
the two even out and everything turns out just fine. It pays to understand 
how the game works, though, so that you can ensure the amount of iron your 
body is absorbing is just right.
Inhibitors of iron absorption
One of the substances that inhibits your  body’s ability to absorb iron is the 
tannic acid in tea. In poor countries where diets are low in vitamin C-rich 
fruits and vegetables (which enhance iron absorption) and low in iron, a 
tradition of tea drinking can tip the scales and cause iron deficiency. That 
doesn’t commonly happen in Western countries, where people generally eat 
a wider variety of foods and have access to plenty of fruits and vegetables.
Other substances that decrease the availability of dietary iron include certain 
spices, coffee, cocoa, the phytates in whole grains, and the calcium in dairy 
products. The reality is, however, that if you eat a reasonable mix of foods, 
inhibitors and enhancers of iron absorption offset each other and no harm is 
done.

51
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
 
If you’re an avid  tea drinker, be careful. More than coffee, tea impairs your 
body’s ability to absorb dietary iron. In the American South, it’s common for 
people to drink half a gallon or more of iced tea each day, and quantities of 
tannins that large may be problematic for some people. Many kinds of herbal 
tea also contain   tannins, though others, including chamomile and citrus fruit 
teas, do not. If you drink tea, consider drinking it between meals, rather than 
with meals, to lessen the inhibitory effect of the tannins.
Enhancers of iron absorption
One of the most potent enhancers of iron absorption from a plant source is 
vitamin C. Healthful vegetarian diets are full of vitamin C. As a vegetarian, 
if you eat a rich food source of vitamin C with a meal, you can enhance the 
absorption of the iron in that meal by as much as 20 times.
You probably eat vitamin C-rich foods with  many of your favorite meals and 
don’t even realize it. In each of the following vegetarian meals, a vitamin 
C-rich food helps the body absorb the iron in that  meal:
 
✓ Bowl of black bean soup with sourdough roll; a mixed green salad with 
tomatoes, green peppers, and onions; and a slice of cantaloupe
 
✓ Bowl of cooked oatmeal with fresh strawberry slices and soymilk
 
✓ Pasta tossed with steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green peppers, 
and onions, with marinara (tomato) sauce or garlic and olive oil
 
✓ Peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole-wheat bread, with orange 
quarters 
 
✓ Tempeh sloppy Joe, with a side of coleslaw 
 
✓ Vegetarian chili over brown rice with steamed broccoli or Brussels 
sprouts
 
✓ Veggie burger with tomato and lettuce and a side of home fries 
 
Other plant  components also improve iron absorption, but vitamin C is the 
most powerful. Using cast-iron skillets, pots, and pans can also increase the 
amount of iron you absorb, especially when you use them to cook acidic 
foods, such as tomatoes or   tomato sauce.
Building B12 Stores
Your body needs vitamin B12 for the proper functioning of enzymes that 
play a role in the metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids. A vitamin B12 
deficiency can cause a form of anemia and a breakdown of the nerves in your 
hands, legs, feet, spinal cord, and brain.

52
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
That’s serious stuff for a vitamin that we need in only miniscule amounts. 
The recommended intake of vitamin B12 is a teeny-weeny 2.4 micrograms per 
day. Just a fraction of a pinch would be enough to last your entire life.
So what’s the big deal about B12?
Getting educated about vitamin B12
For vegetarians, the issue is this: Vitamin B12 is found only in animal prod-
ucts. As far as anyone knows, plants contain none. So vegans could theoreti-
cally risk a vitamin B12 deficiency if their diets didn’t contain a source of it.
Vegetarians who eat eggs or dairy products don’t have as much to worry 
about. They can get plenty of B12 from those foods if they eat them regularly.
 
Vitamin B12 is an issue that vegetarians — particularly vegans — should 
take seriously, because deficiency can lead to severe and irreversible  nerve 
damage. Despite the need for such a miniscule amount of the vitamin, the 
stakes are high if you don’t get what you need.
 
On the other hand, it would probably take you a long time to develop a vita-
min B12 deficiency. Your body hoards and recycles much of the B12 it gets, 
which means that your body conserves B12 and excretes  very little of it. Most 
people have at least a 3-year supply of vitamin B12 stored in their liver and 
other tissues, and some can go without B12 in their diet for as long as 20 years 
before depleting their stores and developing deficiency symptoms.
In fact, the most common cause of  vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t a lack of the 
vitamin in the diet — it’s the diminished ability of the body to absorb the 
vitamin. This problem happens to everyone and isn’t strictly a vegetarian 
issue. Older adults are thought to be at greatest risk, because the body’s abil-
ity to produce intrinsic factor, the substance needed to absorb vitamin B12, 
diminishes with age. For that reason, recommended intakes of B12 are higher 
for people over age 50 than for younger adults.
Despite the theoretical risk, few cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in vegans 
have been reported. That may be due to several reasons, including the  fact 
that folic acid can mask the anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. Folic 
acid is found in plant foods, especially green, leafy vegetables. Vegetarians, 
especially vegans, tend to get a lot of folic acid in their diets, so it’s possible 
that a vitamin B12 deficiency could go undetected.

53
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
Finding reliable sources of B12
Vitamin B12 is being manufactured all around you — and inside you, too. 
The vitamin is  produced by microorganisms — bacteria in the soil, ponds, 
streams, rivers, and in the guts of animals, including humans. So if you were 
living in the wild and drinking from a mountain stream or eating vegetables 
pulled directly out of the ground, you’d have natural sources of B12 in the 
 water and soil clinging to your food. Today, you buy your vegetables washed 
clean and you drink sanitized water. That’s best for public health, but it does 
eliminate a source of B12.
If you eat any animal products — eggs, cheese, yogurt, cow’s milk, or other 
dairy products — you’re getting vitamin B12. Nonvegetarians get even more 
vitamin B12 from meat, poultry, and seafood.
Your intestines also produce vitamin B12, but it’s produced past the site 
of absorption. In other words, you make vitamin B12, but it’s not a reliable 
source.
 
Take heed: If you eat few or no animal products, make sure you have a reliable 
source of B12 in your diet. It’s easy to find reliable sources of vitamin B12, such 
as B12-fortified soymilk and rice milk, fortified breakfast cereals, or even a B12 
supplement. Include them in your diet regularly, just to be on the safe side.
 
If you take a vitamin B12 supplement, choose one that can be chewed or left 
to dissolve beneath the tongue. Vitamin B12 isn’t absorbed very well from 
supplements that are swallowed whole.
Distinguishing between the different B12s
Just when you thought you understood — here’s a twist on the B12 story.
Vitamin B12 comes in many forms. The form that you need is called cyanoco-
balamin. Other forms of vitamin B12 are known as analogs. The analogs are 
inactive in  the human body.
 
Why would I burden you with this information? Because a considerable 
amount of confusion exists over which foods are reliable sources of vitamin 
B12, especially for vegans. In the past, sea vegetables, tempeh, miso, and 
nutritional yeast were touted as being good sources of vitamin B12. When 
those foods were tested for vitamin B12 content for purposes of labeling the 
food packages, the labs used a microbial assay that measured for all forms of 
vitamin B12 — not just specifically for cyanocobalamin. So people bought the 
foods thinking they were getting the amount   of B12 that the label listed, when, 
in fact, much of what was listed may have been analogs.

54
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Now, scientists say that up to 94 percent of the vitamin B12 in these foods is 
actually in analog form, rather than cyanocobalamin. Some are concerned that 
analogs may compete for absorption with cyanocobalamin and promote a vita-
min B12 deficiency. Of course, other people think that this idea is hooey.
 
When you read food packages, look for the word cyanocobalamin to be sure 
that the food contains the right form of vitamin B12. You shouldn’t have any 
trouble finding products that have been fortified with cyanocobalamin. Many 
of these food products, such as breakfast cereals and meat substitutes, are 
mainstream brands that you can find in any supermarket. Make it a habit to 
check the food labels regularly, though, because food manufacturers have 
been known to change the formulation of products from time to time. Other 
fortified products that are easy to find are soymilk and other milk substitutes. 
If you can’t find them in your neighborhood supermarket, you’ll find lots of 
 choices at a natural foods store.
A product that many vegetarians — especially vegans — enjoy   using is nutri-
tional yeast. It has a savory flavor similar to that of Parmesan cheese, and 
many people use it the same way. You can sprinkle it over salads, baked 
potatoes, pasta, casseroles, cooked vegetables, and popcorn.
 
If you use nutritional yeast as a source of vitamin B12, be sure to buy the right 
kind. The regular yeast used for baking that you commonly find in the super-
market isn’t what you want. Many brands of nutritional yeast in natural foods 
stores contain vitamin B12 analog. You don’t want  those, either. Look for Red 
Star Vegetarian Support Formula (T-6635+) at your natural foods store. If the 
store doesn’t have it, ask the manager to order some for you.
 
Many vegetarians think that tempeh, miso (a fermented soy product used as 
a soup base or condiment), tamari (a fermented soy sauce product), bean 
sprouts, and sea vegetables such as kombu, kelp, nori, spirulina, and other 
forms of algae, as well as products labeled as nutritional yeast in natural foods 
stores, are reliable sources of B12. They aren’t, so be careful. These foods con-
tain mostly inactive analogs of vitamin B12, rather than the cyanocobalamin 
that the human body needs. Red Star Vegetarian Support Formula is the form of 
nutritional yeast that contains the form of vitamin B12 that your body can use.
Considering vitamin supplements
For vegetarians who need a reliable source of vitamin B12, using a  supple-
ment is a foolproof way to go. You can use a supplement instead of or in addi-
tion to eating fortified foods.
 
Buy the lowest dose of vitamin B12 supplement that you can find. You need 
only 2.4 micrograms per day, but you’ll probably find that most of the supple-
ments supply much more. Your body adapts its level of absorption according 
to its needs and the amount in your diet. If you flood yourself with vitamin 
B12, your body is going to absorb only what it needs and you’ll waste the rest. 
So there’s no point in taking mega-doses of the vitamin.

55
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
Omega-3s and Your Health
The idea that vegetarians need to pay attention to their intake of omega-3 
fatty acids or n-3 fatty acids is relatively new. Research suggests that vegetar-
ians get lots of n-6 fatty acids in their diets, such as linoleic acid from corn, 
cottonseed, sunflower, and soybean oils. Linoleic acid is an essential fatty 
acid, a substance essential for health that your body can’t produce and that 
you have to get from food.
Vegetarians get fewer n-3s, including α-linolenic acid, another essential fatty 
acid that’s found in flaxseeds, canola oil, cooked soybeans, tofu, and other 
foods. For some vegetarians, lower intakes of n-3s may create an imbalance 
that causes them to have insufficient amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), n-3 fatty acids that are physiologi-
cally active and essential for humans. N-3s such as α-linolenic acids get con-
verted into EPA and DHA in your body.
 
If you eat fish or eggs, you have a direct source of EPA and DHA in your diet, 
so no conversion is necessary. If you don’t, you have to eat enough n-3 fatty 
acids to enable your body to convert them to EPA and DHA.
Spotting the best vegetarian sources 
of omega-3s
Sea vegetables such as nori, kelp, kombu, dulse, and others are direct 
sources of EPA and DHA. You can find these vegetables at Asian markets and 
natural foods stores. Many vegetarians enjoy cooking with these foods.
 
Supplements made from microalgae rich in DHA are also available now in nat-
ural foods stores. They’re made with non-gelatin capsules, so they’re suitable 
for vegans to use.
Other good sources of n-3 fatty acids for vegetarians include ground flax-
seeds, flaxseed oil, canola and walnut oils, and whole or chopped walnuts.
Getting the omega-3s you need
Don’t worry about micromanaging your n-3 fatty acid intake. You don’t have 
to count the grams of fat. Just stay aware of the need, follow the eating guide 
in Chapter 7, and think about using some of the good food sources of n-3 fatty 
acids more often in your diet.

56
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
If you aren’t confident that you’re getting enough n-3s, consider taking a DHA 
supplement of 200–300 micrograms per day. Consult your healthcare provider 
for individualized advice. DHA supplements made from microalgae (microscopic 
forms of algae) are well-absorbed and can boost blood levels of DHA and EPA. 
Some brands of soymilk, such as Silk, are also available fortified with DHA.
Other Vitamins and Minerals
A long list of vitamins, minerals, and other substances are necessary for your 
health. Those I mention in this section — vitamin D, zinc, and vitamin B2 
(also known as riboflavin) — merit discussion because,  like other nutrients I 
cover in this chapter, they’re generally associated with animal products. You 
may wonder if it’s difficult for vegetarians to get enough of these.
Don’t worry — just read on.
The sunshine vitamin: Vitamin D
Vitamin D is actually a hormone that regulates your body’s calcium balance for 
proper bone mineralization. Your body is designed to make vitamin D   when your 
skin is exposed to sunlight. Theoretically, you don’t have to get any from foods.
If your skin is light, you need from 5 to 15 minutes of summer sun on your 
hands and face each day to make enough vitamin D for your body to store 
over the winter months, when you’re exposed to less sunlight. People with 
darker skin need more sun exposure.
Of course, that’s how it works in the ideal world.
In reality, many people are at risk of  vitamin D deficiency because they live in 
large, smog-filled northern cities where they don’t have as much exposure to 
sunlight as they may need. Others at risk include people with very dark skin 
(especially those living at northern latitudes), people who are housebound 
and rarely see the light of day, and people who don’t get regular exposure to 
sunlight because they cover their entire bodies with clothing or sunscreen 
every time they go outdoors. As you age, your ability to produce vitamin D 
also diminishes, so older people may also be at greater risk of deficiency.
Food sources of vitamin D
Few foods are naturally  good sources of vitamin D, and most vegetarians 
don’t eat the ones that are. Eggs are a source, and so is liver, but liver 
isn’t recommended for anybody because of its high cholesterol content 
and because an animal’s liver is a primary depository for environmental 
contaminants.

57
 Chapter 3: Nutrition Know-How for Living Vegetarian
In the United States, milk and other dairy products have been fortified with 
vitamin D for many years as a public health measure to protect people who 
may have inadequate sunlight exposure. If you drink milk, you get a vitamin D 
supplement in effect.
 
Vitamin D is added to fluid milk,   but the amount present has been determined 
to be unreliable. Some samples of milk contain very little vitamin D, and other 
samples contain many times the amount permitted by the government. The 
problem has to do with difficulties the milk industry has in dispersing the vita-
min D evenly throughout large vats or tanks of milk.
Vegetarians and vegans have several potential sources of vitamin D in addition 
to sunshine. Some nondairy milks — soymilk and rice milk, for example — are 
fortified with vitamin D, as are some brands of margarine and breakfast cere-
als. Read the food labels to be sure. (Whether vitamin D is dispersed more 
evenly in nondairy milk than it is in cow’s milk is unknown.)
 
Foods can be fortified with   different forms of vitamin D, including vitamin D2 
or vitamin D3. Vitamin D2, called ergocalciferol, is made by irradiating provita-
min D (from plants or yeast) with ultraviolet light. Vitamin D3, called cholecal-
ciferol, may not be vegetarian and is definitely not vegan. It’s made from fish 
liver oils or lanolin, which is sheep wool fat. Usually, the food label states the 
form of vitamin D used. If it doesn’t, you may have to check with the manufac-
turer  to determine the source.
Vitamin D supplements
If you get little exposure to sunlight and you aren’t sure whether you’re get-
ting enough vitamin D from fortified foods, check in with your healthcare 
provider or a registered dietitian for advice. It may be necessary to take a 
vitamin D supplement to ensure that you’re getting enough. I include more 
advice about the pros and cons of taking supplements in Chapter 4.
For your health: Zinc
Your body needs zinc  for proper growth and development. Zinc plays a role 
in various chemical reactions that take place in your body, as well as in the 
manufacturing of new proteins and blood, and it helps to protect your body’s 
immune system.
Some vegetarians have trouble meeting recommendations for zinc intake, and 
the phytates in some plant foods may bind with zinc and prevent your body 
from absorbing it. Even so, vegetarians in North America and other Western 
lands haven’t been found to have zinc deficiencies.

58
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
Meat is high in zinc, but vegetarians can find plant sources, including dried 
beans and peas, mushrooms, nuts, seeds, wheat germ, whole-wheat bread, 
and fortified cereals. Dairy products and eggs are also good sources of zinc for 
vegetarians who eat those foods.
 
Some methods of cooking and preparing foods may increase the  availability of 
zinc. For example, sprouting seeds, cooking or serving foods in combination 
with acidic ingredients such as tomato sauce or lemon juice, and soaking and 
cooking legumes may make zinc more available to the body.
The other B: Riboflavin
Another name for vitamin B2 is riboflavin. Riboflavin has multiple functions in 
the  body, primarily related to its role in enabling enzymes to trigger various 
chemical reactions.
Riboflavin is present in small amounts in many foods, and many of the foods 
that are the most concentrated in riboflavin come from animals. Among the 
richest sources are milk, cheddar cheese, and cottage cheese. Other animal 
sources include organ meats, other meats, and eggs.
So vegetarians who eat dairy products have options, but what about those 
poor vegans? Isn’t it a challenge for vegans to get enough riboflavin?
 
Nope. You’ll find lots of good plant sources of riboflavin, including almonds, 
asparagus, bananas, beans, broccoli, figs, fortified soymilk and breakfast 
cereals, kale, lentils, mushrooms, peas, seeds, sesame tahini, sweet potatoes, 
tempeh, tofu, and wheat germ.
Vegans haven’t been found to have symptoms of riboflavin deficiency, even 
though some studies have shown that they have lower intakes of riboflavin 
than nonvegetarians.
 
You don’t have to eat mountains of broccoli to get enough riboflavin. 
Riboflavin is spread widely throughout the plant world, and you have many 
choices. As always, one of the chief strategies for ensuring that your diet is 
adequate is to limit the junk foods and   to pack your meals with as many nutri-
ent-dense foods as you can.

f your household is like most, you have a stash of vitamin and mineral 
supplements in your pantry or medicine cabinet. In fact, the supplement 
industry estimates that American consumers spend several billion dollars 
every year on nutrient-packed pills, gel tabs, and capsules. Considering the 
popularity of these products, what I tell you in this chapter may come as a 
surprise.
If you take vitamin and mineral supplements — concentrated doses of indi-
vidual nutrients — you may think of them as little daily doses of nutritional 
insurance. In one sense, that idea may contain a tidbit of truth. If your diet is 
heavy on French fries and soft drinks, and your idea of a vegetable is a dollop 
of ketchup, you’re probably missing out on a wide range of essential nutrients. 
In that case, it may not hurt — and it may even help, at least a little — to fill in 
some of the gaps with a tablet. Something is better than nothing, right?
Perhaps, but it’s not ideal.
 
The truth is, the only foolproof way to get the complete array of vitamins, min-
erals, and other essential substances you need is to get them the way they’re 
packaged naturally — in whole foods. No single food has it all — not bananas, 
milk, a sandwich, an energy bar, or a smoothie. Different foods provide dif-
ferent constellations of the nutrients found in nature. Take them together, 
though, in a diet that has enough calories to meet your energy needs and a 
reasonable variety of wholesome foods, and the nutritional puzzle pieces typi-
cally fall into place to give you the complete complement of what you need.

Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Unfortunately, your diet may not be picture-perfect all the time. That’s why 
it’s important to understand how best to focus your efforts on improving it 
and what role, if any, supplements should play.
 
Some people have the mistaken notion that vegetarians are more prone to 
nutritional deficiencies and, therefore, that they have a greater-than-average 
need for supplements. Not so, and if you’re considering becoming a vegetar-
ian, this chapter will help disabuse you of that worry. If you’re already fol-
lowing a vegetarian eating style and relying on outdated information about 
vitamin and mineral supplements, this chapter may help you save some 
money and improve your overall health.
In this chapter, I help you simplify your vitamin and mineral regime. I give 
you the latest on which supplements science says are useful and not useful, 
and I help you understand when and if a particular supplement makes sense 
for you. Most important, I help you stay safe if you do decide to use supple-
ments. I also talk about dietary supplements that are relatively new to store 
shelves — including herbs and probiotics — and explain what they are, how 
to use them, and where to find reputable sources of ongoing information 
about all these products.
Examining What the Science Says
It may seem like a no-brainer: “If a little bit of [fill in the name of your favorite 
vitamin or mineral] is good for me, more must be even better.” If only it were 
that simple.
 
As it turns out, some of the vitamins and minerals you may have been taking 
for years may not be doing you any good, and some may even be causing you 
harm. A substantial body of research conducted in recent years has called 
into question the use of some of the most common supplements, including 
vitamins C and E and even beta carotene. On the other hand, science has also 
shed light on the real benefits of a few select supplements — like folic acid — 
for some people under certain circumstances.
Sound complicated? It is and it isn’t.
The science of nutrition is complex, and as the years go by, scientists learn 
more and more about how our amazing bodies use the nutrients we need for 
health. Thirty years ago, that nutrient list included a few dozen vitamins and 
minerals. Today, scientists know that foods contain hundreds of substances — 
and maybe more — that support your health. Many of these substances work 
in synergy with one another when they’re all present together in whole foods, 
but they act differently in your body when you take them separately in concen-
trated doses.

61
 Chapter 4: Supplement Savvy
It can be frustrating sometimes when recommendations change, but that’s 
the nature of science. Dietary recommendations are based on the best evi-
dence available at the time, and they get better — and more accurate — as 
more research findings become available.
The good news is that I translate all this information into straightforward, 
practical advice that can help you make the most of your diet — whether 
you’re a part-time or full-time vegetarian — taking only the supplements you 
actually need to support your health. Your wallet may benefit, too!
In this section, I answer a few common questions you may have about the sci-
ence of supplements.
Do supplements work?
If you’re wondering whether supplements work, the answer, for the most 
part, is no.
That’s the short answer. In general, vitamin and mineral supplements give 
most people a false sense of security. People greatly overestimate the likely 
benefits of supplements, and they don’t recognize the potential pitfalls.
 
Although supplements are a huge business — packing the shelves at supermar-
kets, drugstores, natural foods markets, and specialty shops at the mall — little, 
if any, evidence has shown that they’re effective in lowering the risks for chronic 
disease for healthy adults. Despite a couple of exceptions — folic acid for some 
women of childbearing age, and vitamin B12 for older adults, for example — the 
bulk of the research on vitamin and mineral supplements generally doesn’t sup-
port the exaggerated benefits claimed by the supplement industry.
 
A paper published in February 2009 in the Archives of Internal Medicine, for 
example, found that in a study of 160,000 older adult women, those who took 
vitamin and mineral supplements had no significant differences in the risk of 
death, heart disease, and certain forms of cancer than those who didn’t take 
supplements. And the Institute of Medicine, part of the prestigious National 
Academy of Sciences, has concluded that the available evidence doesn’t sup-
port the health claims for some of the most popular supplements in recent 
years, including vitamins C and E, selenium, and beta carotene.
This news can be hard to accept. After all, you, like me, may have grown up 
taking children’s chewable vitamins in the morning and feeling virtuous as 
an adult for dutifully downing your once-a-day nutritional insurance pill. Old 
ideas about health can be hard to shake, especially those that have been as 
entrenched as the supplement routine. Even if you can understand the issue 
intellectually, it can be difficult to let go emotionally. You may be familiar 
with the concept of insurance, but when you apply that concept to nutri-
tional supplements, it falls short.

62
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Can they hurt me?
It may seem hard to believe that something you need for good health can 
have a downside. After all, the vitamin C in a fresh orange or a plate of lightly 
steamed broccoli florets is an important ingredient in many of your body’s 
physiological processes. If you don’t get enough of this vital nutrient, you’ll 
develop the deficiency disease scurvy.
The same is true of other vitamins, minerals, and nutrients you get from 
foods. If you don’t get enough of these important substances, your health can 
suffer. That’s why over the years, nutritionists have chiefly focused on prob-
lems associated with the lack of — and not the abundance of — these nutri-
ents. After deficiency diseases were identified, nutrition scientists pushed for 
everyone to get enough calcium, iron, vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, and more.
And supplements came to be. Extracted from foods or produced in labora-
tories, supplements became the easy way to replace nutrients that were in 
short supply in people’s diets. This seemed to make sense — most people 
figured that supplements couldn’t hurt, and maybe they could help.
More recently, though, that way of thinking has been called into question. 
Science suggests that nutrients behave differently when they’re not a part of 
the total package of a whole food. In other words, vitamin E from a gel cap 
may not have the same benefits as the vitamin E found in whole seeds, nuts, 
or leafy greens.
 
Supplements may, in fact, cause problems under certain circumstances. 
Taking high doses of individual nutrients, for example, can cause nutrient 
imbalances that didn’t exist before. If you take large amounts of supplemental 
zinc, for instance, you can deplete your body’s copper stores. That’s because 
the zinc and copper interact with each other. If they were present together in 
a whole food instead, the effects of the other nutrients in that food may pro-
vide some balance and counteract the effects of the individual minerals. So 
supplements lack the natural checks and balances found in foods that contain 
the entire spectrum of nutrients. Even multivitamin and mineral tablets aren’t 
complete. They contain a long list of vitamins and minerals, but they don’t 
include phytochemicals and other substances important to health, some of 
which probably haven’t been identified yet.
Worse, some supplements once thought to provide special protection against 
heart disease and some forms of cancer have more recently been linked with 
increased health risks instead. For example, research has found that people 
at high risk for lung cancer — especially smokers — can actually increase 
their risk for lung cancer by taking beta carotene, a supplement that was pre-
viously thought to prevent cancer. Even vitamin E, taken in high doses, has 
been found in some studies to increase the risk of death.

 Chapter 4: Supplement Savvy
Recognizing When a Supplement 
Makes Sense
Supplements may not be the best route to good nutrition for vegetarians, but 
they can be a reasonable crutch to support you in times when you don’t have 
a better option. Many vegans, in fact, need to take vitamin B12 supplements, 
and others may benefit from supplements of vitamin D, calcium, and possibly 
What can I do instead?
Looking for a great way to save money? Skip 
the supplements. Switch to nutrient-dense, 
whole foods instead.
Just a single serving of many of these nutritional 
powerhouses can provide you with a hefty dose 
of the vitamins, minerals, and other substances 
you need in greater quantities to support health. 
Good choices include:
 ✓ Dark green, leafy vegetables: A healthy 
serving provides you with a big dose of 
dietary fiber, folic acid, iron, vitamins A and 
C, potassium, and sometimes calcium. Add 
a fistful of baby spinach leaves to a pita 
pocket sandwich, or roll the fresh greens 
into a bean burrito. Ribbons of cooked kale 
add a nutritious punch to a plate of black 
beans and rice, and you can stir cooked, 
chopped collard greens or spinach into a 
pot of lentil soup.
 ✓ Deep orange fruits and vegetables: Think 
peaches, apricots, sweet potatoes, and 
orange, yellow, or red bell peppers. These 
foods are rich in vitamins A and C, as well 
as dietary fiber. Add a thick slice of a juicy, 
red tomato to a sandwich, or add a gener-
ous handful of grated carrots to a hummus 
wrap sandwich. Stir some chopped, dried 
apricots into a bowl of hot oatmeal.
 ✓ Whole, unprocessed grains: In addition to 
being the B vitamin storehouses, grains 
are a rich source of dietary fiber and trace 
minerals. You get a nice dose of all these 
when you reach for a bowl of shredded 
wheat or bran flakes cereal, a sandwich on 
whole-wheat bread, or a steaming bowl of 
seven-grain cereal.
 ✓ Dried beans and other legumes: Think 
of these as the multivitamin and mineral 
supplements that they are, jam-packed full 
of dietary fiber, protein, folic acid, manga-
nese, iron, and a wide range of other miner-
als. They’re versatile, too — enjoy bean or 
lentil soup, bean burritos and nachos, black 
bean dip, or a bowl of chili.
 ✓ Seeds and nuts: Sprinkle them here, 
there, and everywhere. Examples include 
almonds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, 
pecans, and pumpkin seeds. Add them to 
salads, hot cereal, and casseroles. I like a 
handful of chopped walnuts on a bowl of 
rice pudding. You can’t beat seeds and nuts 
as a source of health-supporting essential 
fatty acids, and they’re a good source of 
protein, dietary fiber, and many vitamins 
and minerals, too.
Start thinking differently about what it means to 
supplement your diet. Fresh, wholesome foods 
like these are an enjoyable — and low-cost — 
way to ensure that you get the nutrients you 
need to be well.

64
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
DHA unless they eat foods fortified with these nutrients. In this section, I help 
you understand how to identify the times when you may need a supplement, 
and I explain how to be selective in using vitamin and mineral supplements. 
In most cases, that means your supplement routine will be inexpensive and 
include just a short list of products.
 
Keep in mind that supplements are only meant to fill in the nutritional gaps in 
your diet. If somebody tells you that you need a long list of high-cost supple-
ments, a warning bell should go off in your head, triggering a critical exami-
nation of the recommendation and, perhaps, a second opinion from your 
healthcare provider.
Special situations that call 
for a supplement
Supplements aren’t ideal, but they may be worth considering if your circum-
stances are such that the benefits of taking a supplement outweigh the risks.
I cover those cases in Chapter 3, where I discuss the nutritional nuts and 
bolts of living vegetarian. Though you can easily get enough iron, calcium, 
omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, vitamin D, and zinc from plant foods, in some 
instances, a supplemental boost of one or more of these may be merited if 
you aren’t getting enough from the foods you choose.
 
If you’re healthy, your body should generally be able to adapt to varying 
dietary conditions, absorbing more of a particular nutrient when you need 
more and absorbing less when you need less. If you get enough calories to 
meet your energy needs and you eat a reasonable variety of wholesome foods 
but your diet alone isn’t enough to keep nutrients at normal levels in your 
body, a more complicated problem is likely the culprit.
Another time when a nutritional supplement may be recommended is 
during pregnancy. I discuss the use of prenatal supplements in Chapter 19. 
Vegetarians aren’t more likely than nonvegetarians to need prenatal supple-
ments, but some people mistakenly think that women who don’t eat meat 
when they’re pregnant miss out on vital nutrients. This isn’t so, but if you’re 
pregnant or planning to get pregnant, your healthcare provider may still rec-
ommend a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement.
The bottom line is that, with the exception of vitamin B12 for vegans, vegetar-
ians aren’t more prone than meat eaters to develop nutritional deficiencies. 
 Vegetarians can generally get the nutrition they need from foods. They don’t 
need supplements unless they have reason to believe that their intake 
isn’t sufficient or that an underlying health problem is causing a nutrient 
imbalance.

65
 Chapter 4: Supplement Savvy
 
Not all health professionals are equally familiar with vegetarianism and quali-
fied to counsel vegetarians about their diets. If you do need help sorting out 
the pros and cons of vitamin and mineral supplementation, seek out a regis-
tered dietitian who’s knowledgeable about vegetarian diets. A registered dieti-
tian is a food and nutrition expert who has met specific criteria for education 
and experience as set forth by the Commission on Dietetic Registration, has 
passed a national registration exam, and has completed continuing education 
requirements. Search online for a registered dietitian who practices in your 
geographic area and has expertise in vegetarian nutrition by going to the 
American Dietetic Association Web site: www.eatright.org/cps/rde/
xchg/ada/hs.xsl/home_fanp_consumer_ENU_HTML.htm.
 
In addition, the National Academy of Sciences recommends that certain 
groups take supplements, whether they’re vegetarian or not. Specifically, the 
academy recommends that all adults over the age of 50 take a vitamin B12 
supplement to ensure that they’re getting enough. The academy also recom-
mends that women in their childbearing years take a folic acid supplement. 
Research suggests that folic acid supplementation may help prevent neural 
tube defects, and many women have difficulty reaching the recommended 
level of 400 micrograms of folic acid per day. Vegetarian women can take a 
bow, though: Their folic acid intakes are typically much higher than those of 
nonvegetarians.
Nutritional insurance
Do you need to take out a nutritional insurance policy by popping a daily 
multivitamin and mineral supplement? The consensus among nutritionists is 
that filling dietary gaps with supplements isn’t ideal and that whole foods are 
best.
Still, nutritionists aren’t in complete agreement about what role, if any, once-
a-day supplements should play in your diet, whether you’re a vegetarian or 
not. Some suggest taking them every so often — once or twice a week, for 
example — just for good measure.
No evidence exists to suggest that taking low, periodic doses of multivitamin 
and mineral supplements is helpful, but no evidence exists to indicate that 
it’s a problem, either. The choice is really a personal judgment call. Some 
nutritionists do advocate taking a supplement during times when you feel 
you aren’t eating particularly well.
 
Vitamins and minerals are necessary ingredients in your diet to help ensure that 
various processes in your body function normally. They don’t give you energy 
by themselves, as some people mistakenly think. Only macronutrients can do 
that. Macronutrients are components of your diet that your body needs in rela-
tively large quantities, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

66
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
As for me, I don’t go out of my way to take any supplements at all. Of course, 
you and I do get some unintentional supplements in some of the foods we 
eat. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, including the ones I buy, are fortified 
with a smattering of vitamins and minerals, and the soymilk I drink is fortified 
with vitamin B12.
 
Fortification is the practice of boosting the nutritional value of a product by 
adding vitamins and minerals not already present in that food.
So nutritionists don’t exactly know what the value of a supplement is if you 
take it in small doses or infrequently. If it makes you feel better because 
you’re taking it, then go for it — the risk of harm is small.
Using Supplements Safely
The benefits of nutritional supplements are largely unproven, and the side 
effects can be undesirable. If you’re considering using supplements, think 
carefully about what you plan to take, how much the tablet or capsule con-
tains, and how often you plan to take it.
 
When it comes to supplements, it’s important to get individualized advice. The 
recommendations in this book are meant to apply to a general adult audience. 
Your individual needs may be somewhat different, especially if you’re being 
treated for a disease or condition. In that case, be sure to follow the advice of 
your doctor or other healthcare provider.
Daily supplements versus 
high-potency formulas
Most common, once-a-day multivitamin and mineral supplements supply 
about 100 percent of the amounts recommended on a daily basis. Some even 
provide less than 100 percent of some nutrients. That’s okay — these are 
supplements, not replacements for the nutrients in foods.
 
Many people believe that it’s a good thing when a supplement contains five 
or ten times the daily recommended dosage. (After all, more is better, right? 
Wrong!) If you want to take a multivitamin and mineral supplement, choose 
one that supplies no more than 100 percent of the amounts recommended on 
a daily basis. Check the bottle’s label to see what the supplement includes and 
how much.

67
 Chapter 4: Supplement Savvy
 
High-potency formulas that contain multiple times the recommended daily 
amounts of nutrients are sometimes marketed as special formulations for 
people under stress (who isn’t?) or for people with other needs requiring 
super-high dosages. Don’t fall for these marketing ploys. They play on those 
hard-to-shake beliefs that more must be better. If you have a problem requir-
ing unusually high doses of certain nutrients, leave it to your healthcare pro-
vider to prescribe the supplement.
Multivitamins versus individual 
vitamins and minerals
Ordinary, once-a-day multivitamin and mineral supplements are probably 
benign when they provide up to 100 percent of the recommended daily 
amounts of nutrients. Taken now and then — or even daily — they probably 
won’t harm you. If you buy generic or store brand varieties, they may not 
cause much damage to your pocketbook, either.
Similarly, taking low doses of individual vitamins and minerals — those 
sold as isolated, separate nutrients — once in a while is probably harmless. 
However, many individual nutrients come in capsules or tablets that contain 
multiple times the recommended daily amount.
 
You increase the chances of creating problems for yourself when you take indi-
vidual vitamins and minerals instead of taking them as part of a larger grouping 
of the nutrients that occur in foods naturally. That’s especially true when you 
take dosages that are many times more than what you need in a day.
 
Remember that the best sources of nutrients are the whole foods that contain 
the array of nutrients in amounts and combinations found in nature. The next 
best option, though not ideal, is the multivitamin and mineral solution. Your 
last choice should be individual nutrients, unless your doctor or other health-
care provider specifically recommends them.
When supplements act like drugs: 
Being aware of interactions
Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients can have drug-like effects in your 
body when you take them in high doses. A good example is niacin, one of the 
B vitamins. High doses of niacin change the production of blood fats in your 
liver. People at risk for coronary artery disease can use a special prescription 
form of niacin to lower their triglyceride and LDL (“bad cholesterol”) levels 
and raise their HDL (“good cholesterol”) levels. That’s a pretty powerful use 
of a vitamin.

68
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
Other nutrients can have similarly potent effects when you take them in large 
doses. Like niacin, they can cause physiological changes in your body. High 
doses of vitamin C, for example, can cause your body to absorb less copper. 
Nutrients can also interact with one another, changing the natural balance of 
nutrients. High doses of zinc, for example, can deplete your copper stores. 
Certain vitamins and minerals in high doses can also interfere with the action 
of prescription drugs you may be taking and can either enhance or diminish 
the effects of those medications. For example, folic acid supplements may 
lessen the effects of phenytoin (Dilantin). (Herbs may have an effect as well. I 
cover those in the next section.)
 
If you already take supplements, including herbs or other alternatives, tell 
your healthcare provider what you’re taking. Better yet, provide a written list. 
It will help ensure that you don’t forget any individual item, and it will give 
your healthcare provider an accurate and up-to-date picture of everything 
you’re taking. The more information your healthcare provider has about you, 
the more likely he or she will be able to warn you of potential side effects.
Considering Herbs and Probiotics
People who follow vegetarian diets tend to be more aware than the average 
eater of food and nutrition matters. As a vegetarian, you’re more likely to 
hear messages — accurate or not — about your vitamin and mineral needs 
and about alternative dietary supplements.
Of course, you can supplement your diet with all sorts of things. In discus-
sions about vegetarian diets, most people focus on vitamin and mineral 
supplements. But some people — vegetarian or not — add bran to their diets 
for a natural laxative, and others add flaxseed oil for the essential fatty acids. 
In the broadest sense, anything you add to your diet can be considered a 
supplement, including a peanut butter cracker.
 
In 1994, the U.S. Congress passed into law a similar but slightly narrower 
description of dietary supplements in the Dietary Supplement Health and 
Education Act (DSHEA). That law defines a dietary supplement as any product 
meant to supplement the diet with one or more dietary ingredients, taken by 
mouth in tablets, capsules, powders, liquids, and in other forms, and labeled 
as a dietary supplement.
In this section, I zero in on two specific kinds of supplements — herbs and 
probiotics — that have been the subject of increasing interest among veg-
etarians and others interested in diet and health. In both cases, the science is 
evolving, and the federal government is putting research dollars into study-
ing the benefits and possible risks of each.

 Chapter 4: Supplement Savvy
Understanding what they are
Herbs and probiotics are completely different things, but both are forms 
of dietary supplements used by many vegetarians and others interested in 
their potential health benefits. If you want to be a well-informed vegetarian, 
you should have at least a rudimentary knowledge of these two dietary 
embellishments.
Herbs
Herbs are plants used in small quantities for various purposes. Herbs can be 
grouped into two categories:
 
✓ Culinary herbs, such as rosemary and sage, are used for the flavor 
and aroma they add to foods. These plants are considered herbs and 
not vegetables, simply because they’re used in such tiny amounts. 
Vegetarians love to use herbs and spices in cooking. Spices are usually 
made from the roots, bark, and other, non-leafy parts of the plants.
 
✓ Medicinal herbs are generally thought to confer health benefits, and 
many people use them for their potential therapeutic effects. (Some 
people refer to these as botanicals, another name for herbs.) Just as 
some people believe that vitamin and mineral supplements protect 
health by boosting immunity or preventing heart disease and cancer, 
some people believe that certain herbs may have similar effects.
 
Some herbs are used for both medicinal and culinary purposes. Ginger is safe 
and effective during pregnancy, for example, in small quantities for short peri-
ods of time to relieve nausea and vomiting, according to the National Center 
for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a unit of the National Institutes 
of Health. Ginger also happens to taste good in a variety of vegetarian dishes, 
including soups and stir-fry.
When I talk about herbal supplements, though, I’m generally referring to 
medicinal herbs taken for their therapeutic benefits, rather than culinary 
herbs. Herbal supplements can be composed of a single herb or a combina-
tion of two or more herbs.
Examples of popular medicinal herbs include
 
✓ Black cohosh
 
✓ Echinacea
 
✓ Feverfew
 
✓ Gingko
 
✓ Kava

✓ Red clover
 
✓ Saint-John’s-wort

A comprehensive list of popular herbs, including their common names, uses, 
and possible side effects, is available online from the National Center for 
Complementary and Alternative Medicine at http://nccam.nih.gov/
health/herbsataglance.htm.
Probiotics
Enough about plants, though. Bugs are important, too.
In addition to herbal supplements, vegetarians often read about probiotics, or 
friendly bacteria. These are the good kind of bugs to have in your food.
The idea is that if you take these live microorganisms as supplements in cap-
sule or powder form, or if you eat them in whole foods, they can replace or 
increase your body’s natural supply of good bacteria.
If you take an antibiotic to fight an infection, for example, the medicine kills 
off the bad bacteria as well as the friendly bacteria that are naturally present 
in your intestines. These friendly bacteria are necessary for the normal func-
tioning of your intestines.
You may be able to use probiotics to restore the natural supply of friendly 
bacteria in your intestines, though. Probiotics include yeast and a range of 
other microorganisms. Supplements, or yogurt with active cultures, such as 
Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus, may help to repopu-
late your intestines with these good guys.
Some scientific support also exists for the benefits of probiotics in the treat-
ment of diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, the prevention and treatment 
of urinary tract infections, and the prevention and treatment of eczema in 
children. It’s too early to make concrete recommendations, though. In fact, 
it’s even possible that some benefits may be caused by a placebo effect. In 
other words, the benefits may all be in your head.
 
You can buy probiotics as dietary supplements in natural foods stores and 
pharmacies, or you can get them in whole foods. Common vegetarian foods 
that contain probiotics include some brands of yogurt, soymilk and other soy 
products such as miso and tempeh, kefir (a drinkable form of yogurt), and fer-
mented milk (such as buttermilk). Fermented vegetables such as sauerkraut 
and kimchi — a traditional Korean dish made from pickled vegetables and 
seasonings — also contain probiotics.

71
 Chapter 4: Supplement Savvy
 
Many brands of yogurt contain active cultures. Look for those words — 
“active cultures” — on the package to be sure that you’re getting a dose of 
friendly bacteria when you eat that product. Other products, such as kefir, 
may use the word “probiotic” on the label to show that the product contains 
active cultures. Still others, such as buttermilk, may simply list “bacterial cul-
tures” on the product’s ingredient list.
Knowing how to use them safely
You may be surprised to discover that federal guidelines regulating the mar-
keting and sales of nutritional supplements are quite loose. The products 
aren’t held to the same standards as prescription drugs or over-the-counter 
medications. In fact, companies can start marketing nutritional supplements 
without having to prove that their products are safe or effective at all.
That alone should cause you to hesitate — and to do a little research of your 
own — before you decide to use a dietary supplement.
Herbal supplements, in particular, merit special attention. Just as with vita-
min and mineral supplements, if you use herbal supplements, be sure to let 
your healthcare provider know. He or she understands your total care plan 
and may recognize when a supplement has the potential to cause a problem.
 
Talking to your healthcare provider is especially important if you’re on 
medications or contemplating surgery. Like high levels of vitamin or mineral 
supplements, some herbal supplements have the potential to interfere with 
medications you may be taking. Others may affect your risk for bleeding 
during surgery or may alter the way you react under anesthesia.
 
If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, it’s also best to let your healthcare pro-
vider know if you’re taking an herbal supplement. Before giving an herbal sup-
plement to a child, check with your child’s healthcare provider, too. Though 
you may have nothing to worry about, it’s better to be safe. Most research on 
herbal supplements has been conducted on adults, and little if any has been 
conducted on pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children.
 
Be aware that discrepancies are sometimes found between what’s in the sup-
plement bottle and what the label says the product contains. The plant spe-
cies used or the amount of the active ingredient listed can be different from 
what you may think you’re getting. Products may also be contaminated with 
pesticides, other herbs, and other substances that may not be safe to ingest.
In contrast to herbal supplements, probiotics don’t seem to pose much risk, 
though more research is needed on their use by young people, older adults, 
and people with depressed immune systems. For healthy adults, the most 
common side effects are gas and bloating — uncomfortable, perhaps, but not 
serious.

Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Locating Reliable Sources 
of More Information
A great deal of research is being conducted on dietary supplements, so rec-
ommendations can change in relatively little time. That’s why it’s important 
that you know where to go for accurate, up-to-date information about their 
use and safety.
One first-line source of information is your healthcare provider. Physicians, 
registered dietitians, pharmacists, physician assistants, and other providers 
don’t always have all the answers. They may not know, for example, where 
the science stands on the use of evening primrose oil or ginseng.
They do know where to go to get the information, though, and they usually 
have access to medical libraries or researchers and other experts who can 
provide reliable feedback.
 
I also highly recommend the following resources:
 
✓ The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine: 
Access this clearinghouse online at http://nccam.nih.gov/ for 
updates on research about herbal supplements and probiotics. Fact 
sheets and other materials are available in English and Spanish.
 
✓ The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health: 
Find it online at http://ods.od.nih.gov/. Resources include com-
prehensive fact sheets with information about specific vitamins, miner-
als, and herbal supplements; advice for supplement users and tips for 
older adults; and background information about dietary supplements.
 
✓ MedlinePlus, a service of the U.S. Library of Medicine and the 
National Institutes of Health: Find it online at http://medlineplus.
gov/. This site lets you search by the first letter of herbs and other 
supplements for detailed information compiled from a variety of authori-
tative sources. It also provides a link to the Dietary Supplements Labels

to Meat-Free
In This Chapter

▶ Planning the details of your dietary switch
▶ Steering clear of animal ingredients
▶ Getting started on your lifestyle change
“Where are you going?” the cat asked.
“I don’t know.”
“Well, either road will get you there.”
—Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
D
on’t be like Alice, who doesn’t know which route to take to get where 
she wants to go. If you want to change your eating style, how you do it 
isn’t as important as having a plan for getting there. Without a plan, you’re 
less likely to achieve your goal.
We all have different styles of doing things. What’s important is that you find 
a method that works for you. There’s no right or wrong way of making a life-
style change, as long as you’re successful. So do what’s comfortable for you. 
In this chapter, I cover key points to think about in formulating your plan of 
action as you make the switch to a vegetarian eating style.
Finding the Right Approach
In this section, I present two approaches for you to consider as you plan your 
transition to a vegetarian lifestyle. I also cover pros and cons to consider as 
you weigh the options for making the transition.

74
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Going cold tofu: Instant vegetarian
One day he’s chewing on a 10-ounce rib-eye at a local steakhouse, and the 
next day he’s ordering the tempeh burger at  his neighborhood natural foods 
cafe. It’s not a likely scenario, but some people do make an overnight deci-
sion to go vegetarian. They see a video or hear a lecture that inspires them, 
or they read a book or story about the horrors of the slaughterhouse. Worse: 
They visit a slaughterhouse in person.
Instant vegetarian
The overnight transition to vegetarianism usually isn’t flawless, but those 
who do it are motivated to make the change as soon as possible. Some 
people just prefer to make big changes quickly as opposed to dragging them 
out over months or years. That’s fine.
Benefits of the quick switch
Making the switch to a vegetarian diet in  one fell swoop has some benefits:
 
✓ People who make big changes right away tend to notice the benefits 
quickly and enjoy the benefits sooner. That may be especially appealing 
if you have health concerns. For example, if you’re overweight, you may 
notice weight loss sooner, or if you’re a diabetic, your blood sugar level 
may drop.
 
✓ You get immediate gratification. Your personality may be such that 
you need the satisfaction that comes with taking immediate action and 
reaching your goal as soon as possible.
 
✓ You know you’ll get there in this lifetime. In comparison to people who 
take the gradual approach (see the later section “Taking your time: The 
gradual approach” for details), people who make the change all at once 
jump one big hurdle to arrive at their goal. They don’t run the risk that 
the others do of getting stuck in a rut along the way.
The overnight approach works best for people who
 
✓ Have done some homework: Even a little bit of reading or talking with 
another vegetarian about basic nutrition questions and ideas for quick 
and easy meals can help immensely.
 
✓ Are surrounded by support: The overnight approach is easiest for 
people who live or work with other vegetarians and have someone they 
can emulate or question about basic nutrition and meal-planning issues.
 
✓ Are relatively free of other distractions: Making a big change overnight is 
easier if you don’t have a new baby, a new job, or an 80-hour workweek.

75
 Chapter 5: Making the Transition to Meat-Free
 
If you switch to a vegetarian diet and   find yourself tired and hungry or irrita-
ble, you may not be eating enough. Some people who switch overnight haven’t 
had time to figure out what they can eat. They end up eating only a few differ-
ent types of foods, and they often don’t get enough calories.
Don’t fall prey to the “iceberg lettuce syndrome” — the situation where the 
only thing new vegetarians know they can eat is lettuce. You can eat all kinds 
of foods — see Part III for ideas.
 
If you’re a diabetic and you switch to a vegetarian diet, visit your healthcare 
provider. Diabetics who adopt a vegetarian diet frequently need less insulin or 
oral medication and need to have their dosages adjusted. In some cases, dia-
betics’ blood sugar levels decrease enough to allow them to discontinue their 
medication altogether. Don’t attempt to change your medications without 
checking  with your doctor or other healthcare provider first, however.
Drawbacks of instant vegetarianism
If you take the  instant route to gratification, you’ll soon find out that you 
have no time to develop necessary new skills and to put supports in place. It 
takes time to soak up the background information about nutrition and meal 
planning, as well as to learn how to deal with all sorts of practical issues such 
as eating out and handling questions from friends and family. These are some 
of the things that are necessary for a successful transition, and if they’re not 
taken care of before you dive in, your entry can be a bit sloppy, or you may 
even do a big belly flop.
 
If you opt for the overnight approach, use your wits to do the best you can at 
the outset, but come up with a plan for smoothing the transition as soon as 
possible. Get yourself educated, get a plan, and get some support. I include 
plenty of tips in Parts II, IV, V, and VI.
Taking your time: The gradual approach
When it comes to making a major lifestyle change, most people fare best by 
taking the gradual approach. You probably will, too.
Let your diet evolve at your own pace as you develop new skills and educate 
yourself about the new eating style. As you master each new skill, you’ll 
become more secure and comfortable with meal planning and handling a 
variety of food-related situations. In Parts II and IV of this book, I provide you 
with lots of practical information to help make the transition to a vegetarian 
lifestyle as easy as possible.

76
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Benefits of the gradual approach
Advantages  to making a gradual switch to vegetarianism include:
 
✓ Your new eating habits are more likely to stick. Making changes gradu-
ally allows you to collect the information and support you need to make 
it work and helps you build a strong foundation.
 
✓ The gradual approach may be less disruptive to your routine. If you 
have more time to adapt to each change every step of the way, you may 
have a better chance of sticking with it.
Drawbacks of easing in
 
The gradual approach has disadvantages, too. Keep these in mind and try to 
avoid them:
 
✓ Getting stuck in a rut along the way. You can get stuck anywhere along 
the line and never make the transition to a full-fledged vegetarian diet. 
Some people cut out red meat as an initial step, but they never make it 
any further. They’re forever stuck in the chicken-and-fish rut, or they 
get as far as substituting cheese and eggs for meat. Their blood choles-
terol levels soar because they’re living on cheese omelets, macaroni and 
cheese, and grilled cheese sandwiches.
 
 Don’t let this happen to you. Have a plan to keep moving.
 
✓ Procrastinating and dragging the change out too long. If you take too 
long to make the change, it may never happen. Don’t delude yourself. 
If you want to adopt a vegetarian diet but it’s been a year since you 
started, it’s time to put pen to paper and develop a more structured plan 
 with dated goals for getting there.
Easing the Way
Whether you choose to make the switch to a vegetarian diet overnight or 
gradually, you can tackle the change in a variety of ways. It’s just a matter 
of personal preference. You may be especially interested in nutrition and 
devour books on the subject, or you may love to cook and find yourself 
experimenting with recipes long before you get around to thinking about veg-
etarian meals while traveling. You may like to read, or you may prefer talking 
to other vegetarians or attending lectures instead.
How you choose to proceed is up to you. The following guide is only one 
suggestion for planning a reasonably paced transition to a vegetarian eating 
style.

77
 Chapter 5: Making the Transition to Meat-Free
Defining some simple steps
Have you ever had to write a term paper or thesis? Cringe! Any large project 
can seem overwhelming when you look at it in its entirety.
 
To tackle a big project, break it up into smaller pieces, focusing on only one 
piece at a time. Writing down the steps you plan to take and checking them 
off as you master each one can give you a sense of accomplishment and help 
keep you motivated along the way.
Draw up a weekly or monthly plan of action outlining the things on which you 
want to focus each step of the way. For instance, you may want to concen-
trate on reading several books and other written materials for the first two 
months. From there, you may pick up a few vegetarian cookbooks and experi-
ment with recipes, adding a few meatless meals per week to your schedule 
for the next month. Step it up to five meatless days per week for the next few 
months, and begin attending local vegetarian society meetings.
Your plan should reflect your lifestyle, your personality and preferences, and 
any constraints that you may have to factor in, such as cooking for a family 
or traveling frequently.
 
It helps to set time  goals in your plan for transitioning to a vegetarian diet. If 
you can keep these deadlines in your head, fine. If not, or if you find yourself 
dragging your feet getting to the next step, you may need more structure. 
Write your plan on paper, and break it down week by week. Give yourself a 
reasonable amount of time to complete each task, and stick to your plan.
Educating yourself
Education is a good first step in any plan for lifestyle change. If you like 
to read, you’re in luck, because you can find many excellent resources on 
vegetarian diets. It’s a great idea to spend several weeks to months reading 
everything you can get your hands pertaining to vegetarianism as you make 
the transition.
You’ll find materials on all aspects of vegetarianism. Some books, magazines, 
and online materials may seem to cover the same subjects, but it’s worth 
reading them all, because each author presents the information in his or her 
own style, and the repetition of the subject matter can help you learn and 
build a solid foundation for your transition.
If you don’t particularly care to read, seek out lectures about vegetarian diets 
and related topics on college campuses, at natural foods stores, and in com-
munity centers. Or drop in on meetings of local vegetarian societies where 
guest speakers are often featured.

78
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
 
There is one caveat, however. Although many excellent resources are avail-
able, some materials contain inaccuracies or misinformation. I include refer-
ences to many reliable resources in this book, including some listed in the 
later section “Tracking down resources for up-to-date advice.”
Reducing your meat intake
 
While you’re doing some background reading about vegetarian diets, start 
reducing your meat intake in some easy ways:
 
✓ Add two or three meatless main meals to your diet each week. Begin 
 with some easy and familiar entrées, such as spaghetti with tomato 
sauce, vegetarian pizza, bean burritos, vegetable lasagna, and pasta 
primavera.
 
✓ Try some vegetarian convenience foods,  such as veggie burger patties, 
veggie breakfast meats, frozen vegetarian dinners, and veggie hot dogs. 
They’re quick and convenient. Most supermarkets carry these products, 
and you can also find a large selection at natural foods stores. Substitute 
them for their meat counterparts.
 
✓ When you do  eat meat, make it a minor part of the meal rather than the 
focal point of the plate. Use meat as more of a condiment or side dish. 
Keep portions small, and extend the meat by mixing it with rice, veg-
etables, pasta, or other plant products. For instance, rather than eat a 
chicken breast as an entrée, cut it up and mix it into a big vegetable stir-
fry that feeds four to six people.
From there, just keep going. Add a few more meatless meals to your weekly 
schedule and stick with it for a month or so. Set a date beyond which you’ll 
be eating only vegetarian meals. Mark  that date with a big star on your calen-
dar, and then cross off each day that you’re meat-free after that.
 
Be aware that interruptions in your routine, such as a vacation, holiday, or 
sickness,   can trigger a lapse in your eating plan. In times of stress or a break in 
routine, it’s common to fall back into familiar patterns, including old ways of 
eating. Give yourself a break, and then start fresh again. With time, you’ll dis-
cover how to handle breaks in routine and you won’t be derailed by them.
Setting your goals
After you start the switch to vegetarianism, it’s all about practicing and con-
tinuing  to expand your knowledge base and experience. Expect some bumps 
in the road, but keep going.
Experiment with recipes, new foods, and vegetarian entrées at restaurants. 
Invite friends and family members over to your place for meals, read some 
more about nutrition and meal planning, and allow yourself more time to get 
comfortable with your new lifestyle.

79
 Chapter 5: Making the Transition to Meat-Free
All this is easier to accomplish if you set specific goals and a timeline for 
achieving them. Think about steps that seem realistic for you to achieve, and 
estimate the length of time you think it will take to master each step. Sketch 
out a plan in a notebook or set up a spreadsheet or table on your computer.
Table 5-1 shows a sample schedule for making the transition to a vegetarian life-
style. Your own transition may take more or less time. Adjust the timeline — and 
the specific steps — to suit your own needs and preferences.
Table 5-1 
Twelve Months to a Vegetarian Eating Style
Time 
Frame
What to Do
Months 1 
and 2
Read about basic nutrition, meal planning, dealing with social situa-
tions, and other aspects of vegetarian diets. Borrow books from the 
library, buy a few good resources at a bookstore, visit vegetarian 
organizations online for materials, attend lectures, and subscribe to 
vegetarian magazines. Absorb information.
Month 3
Begin to reduce your meat intake. Add two or three meatless meals 
each week, experiment with new products, make a  list of all the veg-
etarian foods you already enjoy, and when you do eat meat, make it 
a minor part of the meal, rather than the focal point of  the plate.
Months 4 
through 6
Cut back even more on your meat intake. Plan five meatless days 
each week. Limit meat to use as a condiment, a side dish, or a minor 
ingredient in a dish. Plan a cutoff date after which you’ll eat only 
vegetarian meals. Mark that date on your calendar. A week or two 
before that date, stop buying meat and products containing meat, 
such as soup with ham or bacon and baked beans with pork. Keep 
a diary or log of everything you eat for several days. You’ll refer to it 
later to gauge your progress. Be specific about the ingredients. For 
example, if you eat a sandwich, note the kind of bread and filling you 
chose.
Months 7 
and 8
Look into joining a local vegetarian society or attending a national 
vegetarian conference. Seek out occasions when you can be sur-
rounded by like-minded individuals. Continue reading and absorbing 
information.  Continue experimenting with new recipes. Go out to eat 
and order vegetarian entrées at restaurants.
Months 9 
through 
12
Practice. Continue to seek new information. Socialize and invite 
friends and family members to your home for vegetarian meals. Look 
back over the past year and evaluate how you’ve handled holidays 
and special occasions, vacations, and breaks in your routine. Do 
some situations need attention, such as eating away from home or 
finding quick and easy meal ideas? Keep a food diary for several 
days and compare it to your first one (which I suggest starting in 
months 4 through 6).

80
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Monitoring your progress
After you complete the initial steps in the transition to a vegetarian diet, keep 
a food diary from time to time for several days or weeks — whatever you can 
manage. Spot-checking your diet now and then helps you stay aware of what 
you’re eating. Recording not only what, where, and when you eat but also 
how you feel and who you’re with may help you become aware of behavior 
patterns you may want to target for change.
 
Keep a low-cost food diary with a pen and pad of paper, or try one of the sev-
eral online food diaries available. Some charge a monthly fee. An added bonus 
of maintaining your diary online is that some, such as www.myfooddiary.
com, will tally your daily intake of calories and nutrients and also let you know 
how many calories you’re burning with exercise.
Making Sure It’s Meat-Free
Avoiding obvious sources of meat, fish, and poultry is relatively easy. You 
probably recognize a chicken leg or steak when you see one. Living vegetar-
ian gets trickier when animal ingredients and their byproducts are added to 
products in small quantities that may be hard to see or taste.
In this section, I help you find those hidden ingredients.
Being wary of hidden animal ingredients
Many foods contain hidden  animal ingredients. Some are present in very 
small amounts. Casein and whey — both derived from dairy products — are 
acceptable for vegetarians but not for vegans. Others, such as rennet (which 
comes from the stomach lining of calves and other baby animals), are typi-
cally unacceptable to all vegetarians. I include a list of hidden animal ingredi-
ents in Table 5-2. Decide for yourself what you are and aren’t willing to eat.
In some cases, an ingredient may originate from either an animal or plant 
source, and you can’t determine which from the label. You may need to con-
tact the manufacturer and ask (see the later section “Communicating with 
food companies” for more info).

Where You Find It
Vitamin A 
(A1, retinol)
Vitamin obtained from vegeta-
bles, egg yolks, or fish liver oil
Vitamin supplements, 
fortification of foods such 
as breakfast cereals, low-
fat and skim milk, and 
margarine 
Vitamin B12
Vitamin produced by microor-
ganisms and found in all animal 
products; synthetic form (cya-
nocobalamin or cobalamin on 
labels) is vegan
Supplements,  fortified 
foods such as breakfast 
cereals, soymilk, and rice 
milk
Vitamin D 
(D1, D2, D3)
D1 is produced by humans upon 
exposure to sunlight; D2 (ergo-
calciferol) is made from plants 
or yeast; D3 (cholecalciferol) 
comes from fish liver oils or 
lanolin
Supplements, fortified 
foods such as milk, mar-
garine, yogurt, and orange 
juice 
Whey
Watery liquid that separates 
from the solids in cheese-
making
Crackers, breads, cakes, 
processed foods 
Communicating with food companies
If you aren’t sure whether a product is meat-free, check company Web sites 
for ingredient information. If you don’t find the answers you need, check the 
Web site or package for a phone number you can call to speak with a cus-
tomer service representative.
Some ingredient questions may be beyond the ability of a customer service 
representative to answer. If you sense the individual you’re speaking with 
doesn’t know the answer, ask to speak with a supervisor. Another alternative: 
Put your question in writing and send a more formal inquiry to the company. 
Food companies take customer inquires about diet matters very seriously — 
lawsuits have resulted from false or misleading information about ingredients 
being given to consumers.
It may take some digging and persistence, but you can usually get answers to 
your questions about the sources of ingredients in food products.

Tracking down resources for 
up-to-date advice
 
The Vegetarian Resource Group publishes the “Guide to Food Ingredients,” list-
ing the uses, sources, and definitions of more than 200 food ingredients, as well 
as whether ingredients are vegan, vegetarian, or nonvegetarian. You can order 
the guide online for a nominal cost at www.vrg.org/catalog/fing.htm.
The North American Vegetarian Society also provides information about 
hidden animal ingredients. Visit the organization online at www.navs-
online.org/.
Vegans can find information about animal-free nonfood products by visiting 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) online at www.peta.org/.
Applying More Advice 
for Getting Started
You’re on your way! This section offers more tips to make the journey a little 
easier. Some people are their own worst critics. Although you don’t want to 
delude yourself into thinking that you’re making progress when you’re not, 
you also don’t want to be too harsh with yourself if you have a setback now 
and then. Change takes time and patience.
 
Occasional slips  are normal. If you have a lapse, pick up where you left off and 
start again. No one is keeping score but you.
Nonfood products that contain animal ingredients
Animal ingredients may turn up in some surpris-
ing places, including cosmetics, lotions, per-
fume, and household supplies such as glue and 
ink. Many vegans avoid such products, although 
it can be difficult for anyone to avoid them com-
pletely, considering the extent of their use.
Glycerides, lanolin, lecithin, oleic acid, stearic 
acid, tallow, and vitamin A, for example, are 
often used to make cosmetics. Lanolin is used in 
ointments and lotions, and many soaps contain 
oleic acid, stearic acid, or tallow. Read prod-
uct labels carefully if you want to avoid these 
ingredients, and check with the manufacturer if 
you’re in doubt about the source.

 Chapter 5: Making the Transition to Meat-Free
Scouting out supermarkets
Living vegetarian doesn’t require you to buy special foods or ingredients. 
However, after you make the switch to a meatless diet, you’ll find a big world 
of new products you’ll probably want to try, as well as new ways to put famil-
iar old ingredients together.
Now’s the time to encourage creativity. Break with your usual shopping rou-
tine and visit some new stores. Walk up and down all the aisles, including the 
frozen foods case. You’ll find dozens of vegetarian foods. Buy a few on this 
trip, and then try a few more next time.
 
Whole foods — products that are as close to their natural state as possible — are 
the healthiest. However, prepared foods and vegetarian specialty products — such 
as frozen entrées, veggie burger patties, and boxed mixes — can be an acceptable 
convenience. They’re nice to have on hand for occasions when you don’t have time 
to cook and need something quick and easy.
 
When you sample new products, expect to find a few duds. Next time, try 
another brand of the same type of product, because different brands of the 
same product can vary. Veggie burger patties and soymilk are two examples 
of products that vary greatly in flavor and texture, depending on the brand.
After you start experimenting with new foods, you’ll discover a long list of 
great products  that will become regulars in your kitchen. I cover much more 
about ingredients and shopping in Chapters 6 and 7.
Scanning cookbooks and magazines
Go to the library  and check out all the vegetarian cookbooks and magazines 
you can find. If you have friends who are vegetarians, borrow their cook-
books. Then begin to page through each one.
Read the names of the recipes. If you see one that grabs you, look at the list 
of ingredients. If the recipe inspires you, make the dish. When you find a 
cookbook with lots of recipes that appeal to you, go to a bookstore and buy 
it, or order it online. Natural foods stores also carry a good selection of popu-
lar vegetarian cookbooks.
When you orient yourself to the options on a vegetarian diet, you may be sur-
prised at the variety. You may also notice lots of ethnic foods from cultures 
that have vegetarian traditions. A vegetarian diet has more variety than a 
meat-centered diet, and reviewing cookbooks will help you see that.

86
Part I: Being Vegetarian: What It’s All About 
Listing vegetarian foods you already like
If you’re new to a vegetarian diet, it’s helpful to make  a list of the vegetarian 
foods you already enjoy. Fix them often. You probably eat a number of meat-
less foods and haven’t thought of them as being vegetarian until now. Here 
are some examples:
 
✓ Baked potato topped with broccoli  and cheese
 
✓ Bean burritos and tacos
 
✓ Grilled cheese sandwiches
 
✓ Lentil soup
 
✓ Macaroni and cheese
 
✓ Pancakes
 
✓ Pasta primavera
 
✓ Spaghetti with tomato sauce
 
✓ Vegetable stir-fry over rice
 
✓ Vegetarian lasagna
If your favorite vegetarian foods happen to contain dairy products such as 
cheese or milk, gradually reduce  the amount and switch to nonfat varieties. 
You can probably modify some of your other favorite foods to make them 
vegetarian. Some examples:
 
✓ Bean soups: Leave  out the ham or bacon.
 
✓ Breakfast meats: Use veggie versions  of link sausage or sausage patties 
and bacon. They taste great and can replace meat at breakfast or in a 
BLT.
 
✓ Burgers: Buy veggie burger patties instead  of meat.
 
✓ Chili: Make it with beans, tempeh,  or textured vegetable protein instead 
of meat.
 
✓ Hot dogs and luncheon meats: Buy veggie  versions. All natural foods 
stores carry them, and so do some supermarkets. They look and taste 
like the real thing but are far better for you.
 
✓ Meatloaf: Even this all-American food  can be made with lentils, chopped 
nuts, grated vegetables, and other ingredients. Many vegetarian cook-
books include a number of delicious variations. Try the recipe for 
Everybody’s Favorite Cheese and Nut Loaf in Chapter 15.

87
 Chapter 5: Making the Transition to Meat-Free
 
✓ Pasta sauces: Why add meat or meat flavorings when  you have basil, 
oregano, mushrooms, red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, pimentos, black 
olives, and scores of other delicious ingredients to add flavor to sauces? 
Great on cannelloni, stuffed shells, manicotti, ravioli, fettuccine, and 
steamed or roasted vegetables.
 
✓ Sandwiches: Load up on lettuce, tomatoes,  mustard, chopped or shred-
ded vegetables, and a little cheese if you like, but leave out the meat. 
Use pita pockets, hard rolls, and whole-grain breads to give sandwiches 
more character.
 
✓ Stuffed cabbage: Instead of using  pork or beef, fill cabbage leaves with a 
mixture of rice and garbanzo beans and seasonings.

onsider your kitchen Command Central. It’s the heart 
of your vegetarian food operation — where you pre-
pare delicious and nutritious meals for you, your family, 
and guests.
By preparing and eating more of your meals at home, 
you’ll not only save money but also have more control 
over the composition of your diet. That’s why it’s so 
important that you have what you need at your fingertips.
In this part, I coach you on how to set up your kitchen for 
maximum efficiency. You want to have on hand the most 
common and versatile ingredients for vegetarian meals. I 
help you understand where to shop to get what you need, 
and I give you strategies for getting the best values. I 
cover the practical equipment you should have and the 
basic cooking techniques you should be familiar with to 
get the best results from your kitchen adventures.

egetarian meals don’t have to be exotic, made with ingredients you 
can’t pronounce or buy at your local supermarket. In fact, they can be 
as all-American as corn on the cob, baked beans, and veggie burgers.
But if you’re interested, vegetarian cooking can be an introduction to a whole 
new world of flavors, textures, and aromas based on culinary traditions from 
around the world. Many vegetarian cookbooks draw on these traditions, 
which contribute greatly to the diversity of foods that many vegetarians 
enjoy.
In this chapter, I describe useful ingredients in vegetarian cooking. You may 
already use some, but others may be unfamiliar to you. All are healthful, mul-
tipurpose ingredients worth knowing about and keeping on hand. I also shed 
some light on the often-confusing topic of natural and organic products to 
help you make well-informed choices when you shop.
Building the Foundation 
of the Vegetarian Diet
It’s important to keep on hand ingredients in a variety of forms. Fresh is best, 
of course, but fresh isn’t always the most convenient option. So plan to keep 
a range of fresh, frozen, canned, and packaged foods in your kitchen.

92
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Bringing home the beans
Beans are highly nutritious and extremely versatile. You can mix several 
types of beans (such as garbanzos, pintos, red kidney beans, and white 
kidney beans) to make many-bean chili. You can mash them for dips, soups, 
and spreads. You can combine them with rice, pasta, or other grains to make 
a variety of interesting vegetarian entrées. Among others, try the following:
 
✓ Black beans
 
✓ Black-eyed peas
 
✓ Cannellini beans (white kidney beans)
 
✓ Garbanzo beans
 
✓ Kidney beans
 
✓ Navy beans
 
✓ Pinto beans
Forms of beans
Beans come in several forms, all of which are useful in vegetarian cooking. 
Here’s a rundown on the types you’ll see at the store:
 
✓ Canned beans: Canned beans are one of the most nutritious and versa-
tile convenience foods you can buy. Conventional supermarket varieties 
are fine, although natural foods stores carry a wide variety of organic 
canned beans.
 
 Rinse canned beans in a colander before using them. Rinsing removes 
excess salt and the fibrous outer skins of the beans that otherwise tend 
to flake off and look unsightly in finished dishes.
 
 If you have leftover canned beans, add them to a can of soup or stir 
them into pasta sauce to use them up. You can also spoon them on 
top of a green salad or mash them with a little garlic and add them to 
a casserole.
 
✓ Dried beans: Beans were sold dried in bags long before canned beans 
were available. Some people still prefer to buy and prepare their beans 
the old-fashioned way. Preparing dried beans is more time-consuming, 
but some people prefer the flavor and texture that result.
 
 Dried beans are often a little firmer than canned beans. In fact, they can 
be too hard if you don’t soak them long enough before cooking them. 
Also, dried beans don’t usually contain added salt; you have to season 
them yourself or they’re bland. (The exception is bags of beans pack-
aged with their own spice mixtures, which are often very salty.)

93
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
 
✓ Frozen beans: You can find a few types of beans, such as lima beans 
(also called butter beans) and black-eyed peas, in the freezer section 
of some supermarkets. They taste the same as fresh and are just as 
nutritious. Compared to canned beans, frozen beans have less sodium 
and may be slightly more nutritious, because nutrients can leach out of 
canned beans into the water in the can.
 
✓ Bean flakes: This form of dried beans is convenient and fun to use. You 
just shake some into a bowl, add boiling water, stir, and cover. In five 
minutes, you have a smooth, creamy bean paste that you can use to 
make nachos, burrito or taco filling, bean dip, or bean soup. The more 
water you add, the thinner the beans. The bean flakes themselves keep 
in the cupboard for months, just like dried and canned beans. After you 
mix the bean flakes with water, leftovers keep in the refrigerator for up 
to a week or in the freezer for up to six months.
 
 You’re more likely to find bean flakes at a natural foods store than in a 
supermarket. Fantastic Foods and Taste Adventure are two brands that 
make both dehydrated black bean flakes and pinto bean flakes.
 
Whether frozen, canned, or dried, beans have approximately the same nutri-
tional value. Convenience and flavor are the major differences.
Common dishes from around the world
Beans are used in many different cultures to make a wide range of traditional 
foods and dishes. Examples include:
 
✓ American navy bean soup
 
✓ Chinese stir-fried tofu and vegetables
 
✓ Ethiopian puréed lentil and bean dishes
 
✓ Greek lentil soup
 
✓ Indian curries and dal (Indian-style lentil soup)
 
✓ Indonesian tempeh
 
✓ Italian pasta e fagioli (pasta with beans)
 
✓ Mexican burritos, tacos, and nachos
 
✓ Middle Eastern hummus and falafel (small, round, fried cakes made from 
mashed garbanzo beans and spices)
 
✓ Spanish black bean soup
 
You can substitute many types of beans for others in recipes. For example, 
you can easily substitute black beans for pinto beans in tacos, burritos, 
nachos, and bean dip. The dark color often makes a striking contrast to other 
components of the meal, such as chopped tomatoes, salsa, or greens.

94
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Eating more vegetables and fruits
The best   vegetables and fruits are locally grown, in season, and fresh. Most of 
them are packed with vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. Frozen foods 
run a  close second in terms of nutrition, and they’re a perfectly acceptable 
alternative to fresh.
However,  canned vegetables and fruits are sometimes more convenient or 
less expensive than fresh or frozen. Because heat destroys some vitamins, 
and time on the shelf can allow some nutrients to leach into the water used in 
packing, canned vegetables and fruits tend to be less nutritious than fresh or 
frozen. However, that doesn’t mean that they’re worthless! On the contrary, 
canned produce can make a sizable nutritional contribution.
Varying your vegetables
Vegetarian cooking incorporates many kinds of vegetables, but some of the 
more popular recipe ingredients include white potatoes, sweet potatoes, 
onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, greens, broccoli, and many varieties of 
squash. Ethnic dishes make use of such less common vegetables as bok choy 
(in stir-fries), kohlrabi (in stews and casseroles), and arugula (steamed or in 
salads). I include recipes incorporating some of these in Part III.
 
When you use canned vegetables, you can save vitamins and minerals that 
may have leached out by incorporating the liquid from the can into the dish 
you’re making. For example, if you’re making soup or sautéed vegetables to 
serve over rice or pasta, dump the entire  contents of the can into the pot. The 
packing liquid may contain salt, but you can compensate by leaving out any 
additional salt that’s called for in  the recipe.
 
Some vegetables are worth extra attention because of their superior nutri-
tional value. Deep yellow and orange vegetables, for instance, are particularly 
rich in beta carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A. Sweet pota-
toes, acorn squash, tomatoes, red peppers, and pumpkin are examples. Other 
vegetables are potent sources of vitamin C, including white potatoes, green 
bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and tomatoes, which are high in 
both beta carotene and vitamin C.
Making vegetarian-style beans and franks
If you loved beans and franks as a nonveg-
etarian, you’ll love this vegetarian version. 
Add two sliced meatless vegetarian hot dogs, 
a handful of minced onion, and a couple of 
tablespoons of molasses to a 15-ounce can of 
vegetarian baked beans. If you like, you can 
also add a couple of tablespoons of ketchup 
and dark brown sugar. Stir, pour into a 11⁄2-quart 
casserole dish, and bake, uncovered, at 350 
degrees for 40 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.

95
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
Cruciferous vegetables are another example of super vegetables. They contain 
cancer-fighting substances as well as copious amounts of vitamins and miner-
als. Following are a few popular examples from this group:
 
✓ Arugula (pronounced a-roo-guh-la) is a leafy green vegetable that’s dis-
tinctive for its sharp, peppery flavor. It grows wild throughout southern 
Europe and is native to the Mediterranean. You eat arugula raw, and you 
can mix it with other salad greens or let it stand alone. I include a recipe 
for arugula salad in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Daikon (or Chinese radish) is a large, white, Asian radish. In contrast to 
the small red radishes that we know in North America, daikon is usually 
eaten cooked. However, it’s sometimes used raw in salads.
 
✓ Kale, Swiss chard, and bok choy (also known as Chinese cabbage) are 
thick, green, leafy vegetables that are best when cut or torn into strips 
and steamed, sautéed, or stir-fried. Many vegetarians add a little olive oil 
and minced garlic to these cooked greens. You can eat them plain or mix 
them into casseroles, soups, and other dishes.
 
✓ Kohlrabi is a white, turnip-shaped vegetable commonly eaten in Eastern 
Europe. Like other cruciferous vegetables, it’s full of potentially cancer-
preventing phytochemicals and is very nutritious and flavorful. Kohlrabi 
is usually diced, boiled, and eaten cooked or added to stews.
Picking fruits
You can use fruits in vegetarian meals in many creative ways — to make cold 
soups, warm cobblers, pies, and quick breads, for instance. I like to add bits 
of fruit — mandarin oranges, strawberries, and chunks of apple and pear — 
to green salads. Many of the dessert recipes in Chapter 14 call for fruit, which 
cuts the calories and adds important nutrients to sweet treats.
 
Strawberries and grapes often contain substantial amounts of pesticide, and 
sometimes people don’t wash them well before eating them. Wash all fruits 
under running water, rubbing with your hand or a soft cloth, or brush the fruit 
to remove pesticide residues, especially if you’re going to eat the skin. In addi-
tion, although you may not eat the peel, be sure to wash the outsides of such 
fruits as melons, grapefruit, and oranges before setting them on your cutting 
board to slice them. If you don’t, you may contaminate your cutting board 
surface. You may also drag any bacteria or contaminants present on the fruit’s 
surface into the edible inner portion.
 
Choose plenty of deeply colored fruits to get the benefit of their rich nutri-
tional content. Apricots, peaches, papayas, and mangoes, for example, are 
densely packed with many important vitamins and minerals. Watermelon, can-
taloupe, oranges, and grapefruits are also super healthful.

96
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Choosing breads and cereals
Grains are versatile — you can eat them by themselves or combine them with 
other ingredients to make a seemingly endless collection of dishes. Grains 
 can be an accompaniment to a meal, such as a slice of bread or a couscous 
salad, or they can be the foundation of an entrée, such as rice pilaf or a plate 
of spaghetti. Around the world, grains are familiar ingredients in soups, 
salads, baked goods, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and other foods. 
Examples include:
 
✓ Chinese vegetable stir-fry with steamed white rice
 
✓ Ethiopian injera (flatbread made from teff flour)
 
✓ Indian saffron rice with vegetables
 
✓ Indonesian tempeh (made with whole soybeans and a grain such as rice)
 
✓ Irish porridge (oatmeal)
 
✓ Italian polenta (typically made with cornmeal, baked or pan-fried, and 
often served with a sauce on top)
 
✓ Mexican enchiladas made with corn tortillas
 
✓ Middle Eastern couscous with cooked vegetables
 
✓ Middle Eastern tabbouleh (wheat salad)
 
✓ Russian or Eastern European kasha (toasted buckwheat) with bowtie 
pasta and cooked mushrooms
 
✓ Spanish rice
 
✓ Thai jasmine rice with curried vegetables
Grains come in two forms: whole and processed. Both forms are indispens-
able in vegetarian cooking.
 
Whole grains are grains that have had only the outer hull removed, leaving a 
small, round kernel, often called a berry. The major advantage to using whole 
grains in cooking is that they’re slightly more nutritious than processed 
grains, and they taste better. After you get used to the flavor of whole-wheat 
bread, for example, you’ll probably prefer it to soft, white bread.
The major drawback to whole grains is that they take more time to cook than 
processed grains. Whole-grain hot cereal, for example, may take 10 minutes 
to cook, compared to the 1 or 2 minutes it takes to fix instant hot cereals.

97
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
You can find many types of grains at most supermarkets and natural foods 
stores. Some may be new to you. Here are some examples of how they’re 
used:
 
✓ Amaranth: An ancient grain eaten for centuries in Central and South 
America. You can cook it and eat it as a side dish or hot cereal, or use it 
to make casseroles, baked goods, crackers, pancakes, and pasta. Use it 
as you’d use rice in recipes. Amaranth flour is also available.
 
✓ Barley: Barley comes in two forms: hulled and pearl.
 
• Hulled barley is the more natural, more nutritious, unrefined form, 
having only its outermost husks removed. Not surprisingly, hulled 
barley is brown in color. You can use it in soups, casseroles, and 
stews.
 
• Pearl barley is more processed than hulled barley. In addition 
to having the inedible outer hull removed, pearl barley also has 
the outer bran layer removed. Pearl barley is less nutritious than 
hulled barley, but it cooks faster.
 
✓ Corn: Corn kernels are actually the seeds of a cereal grass. You can use 
corn in cornbread, corn tortillas, and polenta.
 
✓ Kamut: An ancient type of wheat used in Europe for centuries, usually in 
baked goods.
 
✓ Millet: Tiny, beadlike seeds that come from a cereal grass. You use 
millet in baked goods and as a cooked cereal.
 
✓ Oats: Oats come from cereal grasses. Use oats as a hot cereal and in 
baked goods, veggie burger patties, and loaves.
 
✓ Quinoa (pronounced keen-wah): An ancient grain eaten for centuries 
in Central and South America. You can cook quinoa and eat it as a side 
dish or hot cereal, or you can use it to make casseroles, salads, a side 
dish with cooked vegetables, or pilaf. Use it as you’d use rice in recipes.
 
 Quinoa has to be processed to remove the seed coat, which contains 
saponin and is toxic. Before you cook quinoa, rinse it several times with 
water to remove any remaining saponin. The saponin is soapy; you’ll 
know that you’ve rinsed the quinoa well enough when you no longer see 
suds. Packaged quinoa is often pre-rinsed and needs only minimal rins-
ing. Quinoa purchased from bulk bins often is not pre-rinsed.
 
✓ Rice: Rice has been grown for centuries in warm climates, where the 
seeds are harvested from cereal grasses that grow in wet areas called 
rice paddies. If you’re a diehard white rice eater, that’s fine. However, 
brown rice has a slightly better nutritional profile, and many people like 
its hearty flavor. Several quick-cooking brown rice varieties are on the 
market; you can find them at regular supermarkets and natural foods 
stores.

98
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
 Supermarkets also carry many specialty rice varieties, such as aromatic 
jasmine rice, basmati rice, and arborio rice (a medium-grain rice used 
to make the Italian dish risotto). Jasmine and basmati rice are available 
in white or brown form; the brown form is slightly less refined. You can 
use these various forms of rice in casseroles, baked goods, puddings, 
and side dishes.
 
 Rice is one of the least allergenic and most easily digestible foods. That’s 
why rice cereal is one of the first solid foods introduced to infants. 
People who are allergic to wheat and other grains can use rice flour to 
make baked goods such as breads and cookies.
 
✓ Rye: A form of cereal grass grown for its seeds, which are ground to 
make flour. You use rye in baked goods, such as bread and rolls.
 
✓ Spelt: An ancient type of wheat that has been used in Europe in baked 
goods for centuries.
 
✓ Teff: One of the oldest cultivated grains in the world, teff is used in 
Ethiopia to make injera, a flat, spongy bread that’s a staple food there. 
You can also use it in baked goods, soups, and stews.
 
✓ Wheat: Wheat is grown around the world as a cereal grass and used in 
baked goods and pasta.
 
✓ Wheat berries: Whole-wheat grains that have had only the outer hull 
removed. Use wheat berries in baked goods and as a hot cereal.
 
When you make   a pot of rice (or any grain), make more than you need for one 
meal. You can store the leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 
up to two weeks. You can reheat leftover rice and serve it with steamed veg-
etables, bean burritos, or tacos; top it with vegetarian chili; add it to a filling 
for cabbage rolls; or use it to make rice pudding.
Selecting seeds and nuts
Seeds and nuts are excellent additions to many vegetarian dishes because 
they’re rich in protein and other nutrients, including health-supporting phy-
tochemicals. A handful of chopped walnuts or almonds or a sprinkling of 
toasted sunflower seeds makes a nice addition to a casserole, salad, or bowl 
of hot cereal.
Here are a couple of products made from seeds and nuts that are common in 
vegetarian cooking:
 
✓ Tahini: Tahini is a smooth, rich paste made from sesame seeds. It’s a 
traditional Middle Eastern ingredient in hummus — a spread made with 
garbanzo beans, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil — and you can also use 

99
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
it to flavor salad dressings, sauces, dips, and other foods. Tahini is sold 
in cans or bottles. A layer of sesame oil usually floats at the top of the 
container; you have to stir it in each time you use the product.
 
✓ Nut butters: Don’t stop with peanut butter. Cashew butter and almond 
butter are equally, if not more, nutritious, and they’re just as delicious. 
You can use them in all the same ways that you use peanut butter — for 
sandwiches, cookies, and in cooking.
 
 If you buy a jar of natural peanut butter, you’ll notice a layer of oil at the 
top. Don’t make the mistake of pouring the oil off, thinking that you’ll 
reduce the fat content. If you do, you’ll need a pickax to get the dry nut 
butter out. Storing the jar upside down to keep the oil dispersed is also 
risky — the oil may ooze out onto the shelf. Instead, just stir the oil back 
into the nut butter when you’re ready to use it.
Fitting in Specialty Foods and Products
Living vegetarian can be extraordinarily simple. No fancy equipment or spe-
cial food products are necessary — unless you want them.
Several specialized products do exist that many vegetarians find especially 
convenient. All these products are nutritious, and many are much better for 
your health than their animal-product counterparts. You can find most of the 
products I mention in this section in your neighborhood supermarket; you 
can find them all in a natural foods store.
Introducing soy foods and their variations
Soy foods come in dozens of forms and can take the place of meat, cheese, 
eggs, milk, and other animal products in recipes. Nutritionally, soy products 
are far superior to their meat counterparts because they’re cholesterol-free, 
low in saturated fat, and usually lower in sodium. They’re also free of nitrates 
and nitrites, preservatives that are commonly found in processed meat prod-
ucts and that may cause cancer.
Table 6-1 lists several types of soy products that are available and ways you 
can use them.

Table 6-1 
Soy Foods and Their Uses
Product
Description and Uses
Meat substitutes
Meat substitutes are made from soy protein, tofu, and veg-
etables. Some are made to resemble traditional cold cuts, 
hot dogs, sausage, and bacon in appearance, texture, 
flavor, and aroma. You can use them in the same ways as 
their meat counterparts.
Miso
A rich, salty, East Asian condiment used to flavor soups, 
sauces, entrées, salad dressings, marinades, and other 
foods. This savory paste is made from soybeans, a grain 
(usually rice), and salt. It’s combined with a mold culture 
and aged for at least one year. It doesn’t have much 
nutritional value and is high in sodium, so, like most condi-
ments, you should use it sparingly.
Soy cheese
A substitute for dairy cheese that comes in many different 
forms, such as mozzarella style, jack style, American style, 
and cream cheese style. You can use it to make sand-
wiches, pizza, casseroles, and spreads.
Soy margarine 
Find it in natural foods stores. It’s free of casein and other 
dairy byproducts that other brands of margarine usually 
contain, so it’s vegan-friendly.
Soy mayonnaise
Several brands are available at natural foods stores. 
Use soy mayonnaise in all the ways you use regular 
mayonnaise.
Soymilk
A beverage made from soaked, ground, and strained soy-
beans. You can use it cup for cup in place of cow’s milk in 
recipes, or drink it as a beverage.
Soy sauce
A rich, salty, dark brown liquid condiment made from 
fermented soybeans. Use it to add punch to stir-fried veg-
etables and as a dip for dumplings and egg rolls.
Soy yogurt
Made from soymilk, it often contains active cultures and 
is available in many flavors. Use it as a substitute for dairy 
yogurt.
Tamari
A type of soy sauce and byproduct of the production of 
miso. It has a rich flavor.
Tempeh
A traditional Indonesian soy food made from whole soy-
beans mixed with a grain and a mold culture, fermented, 
and pressed into a block or cake. You can grill it and serve 
it as an entrée or use it in sandwich and burrito fillings, 
casseroles, chili, and other foods.

 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
Product
Description and Uses
Textured soy 
protein (TSP) or 
textured vegetable 
protein (TVP)
A product made from textured soy flour that’s usually 
sold in chunks or granules. It takes on a chewy, meatlike 
texture when rehydrated and is used in such foods as veg-
etarian chili, vegetarian sloppy Joes, veggie burgers, and 
other meat substitutes.
Tofu
Soybean curd that’s made in a process similar to cheese 
making, using soymilk and a coagulant. It’s bland-tasting 
and is available in a variety of textures and densities. 
You can use it in numerous ways: cubed and added to a 
stir-fry, marinated and baked, as a substitute for eggs and 
cheese, as a sandwich filling, and as an ingredient in dips, 
sauces, desserts, cream soups, and many other foods.
 
You can use different styles of tofu in different recipes. For instance, soft tofu 
works well for making dips and sauces because it’s easy to blend. Firm tofu 
works well in baked goods and as an egg replacer in many recipes. Extra-firm 
tofu is the style of choice for making stir-fries because the cubes can hold up 
when they’re jostled around in the pan. Unlike cheese, tofu is never coagu-
lated with rennet, an enzyme taken from the stomach linings of baby animals. 
It’s always safe for consumption by vegetarians and vegans alike.
 
Like cheese, eggs, meat, and other high-protein foods, tofu and tempeh can 
spoil if left unrefrigerated. Don’t leave out foods made with tofu and tempeh at 
room temperature for more than two hours. After a meal, cover the leftovers 
and put them back in the refrigerator as soon as possible.
Making the most of milk substitutes
In addition to the soymilk, soy cheese, and soy yogurt listed in Table 6-1, 
you may also be interested in rice, almond, and oat milks packaged in 
aseptic (shelf-stable) packages. People who are allergic to soy often use these 
alternatives.
You can buy potato milk in natural foods stores in powdered form. Some soy-
milk is still sold in powdered form, too. The liquid soymilk is more palatable 
and much more convenient, though. Also try   soy and rice frozen desserts and 
soy-based nondairy coffee creamer.
 
Soymilk is generally more nutritious than any   of the other milk alternatives, 
such as rice milk and almond milk. Fortified soymilk has extra calcium and 
vitamins A, D, and B12. If you use substantial amounts of a milk alternative, 
fortified soymilk is usually the best choice in terms of   nutrition.

102
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
If you try soymilk for the first time and don’t care for it, give it a second 
chance and try another brand. Soymilk varies in flavor considerably from one 
brand to the next. You may have to taste three or four before you find your 
favorite. Most of the soymilk sold in the United States and Canada is made 
from whole soybeans, so it has a bit of a beany aftertaste, which some people 
find pleasant but others don’t like. If you object to the mild bean flavor, you 
may prefer a flavored soymilk to plain. Soymilk does grow on you — if you 
use it for a while, you’ll probably grow to love it.
 
If you do include dairy products such as cheese, milk, and ice cream in your 
diet, buy  the nonfat varieties. Even the so-called low-fat items are too high in 
fat. The problem with dairy fat is that two-thirds of it is saturated, so the fat in 
dairy products is a real artery-clogger.
Incorporating egg replacers
Powdered vegetarian   egg replacer is an egg substitute made from a mixture 
of vegetable starches. You just mix a teaspoon and a half of the powder with 
two tablespoons of water to replace one egg in virtually any recipe. It keeps 
on a shelf in your cupboard almost indefinitely and is always on hand when 
you need it. It’s free of saturated fat and cholesterol and doesn’t pose a sal-
monella risk. Ener-G Egg Replacer is a common brand that you can find in 
most natural foods stores.
Considering meatless burgers, dogs, 
sausages, and cold cuts
Some   vegetarian burger patties are made  from soy (see Table 6-1), and some 
are grain- or vegetable-based. A wide variety is available, and they all taste 
different, so you need to experiment to find your favorites. Some are meant 
to look and taste like meat, while others don’t look or taste anything like 
meat. Vegetarian hot dogs are typically made of soy, and they taste and look 
like the real thing. You can cook meat substitutes on a grill and serve them 
the same way that their meat counterparts are served.
 
One of the advantages of these products is that you can take them to picnics 
and cookouts and join in on the food fun with all the nonvegetarians. One note: 
Vegetarians will want to reserve one side of the grill — or an entire grill — to 
themselves so that their veggie burgers and dogs aren’t cooked on the same 
surfaces as meat. Call it a “meat-free” zone!

103
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
Meatless sausages and cold cuts are also versatile. Let these fakes stand in 
for their meat counterparts in sausage biscuits, sandwiches, on top of pizza, 
and in other creative ways. The nutritional advantage of these foods is that 
they’re low in saturated fat, they’re cholesterol-free, and many even contain 
a good dose of dietary fiber. They’re quick, convenient, and good tasting, and 
they work well as transition foods for people making the switch to a vegetar-
ian diet.
Including other vegetarian 
convenience foods
Seitan (pronounced say-tan) is a  chewy food made from wheat gluten, or 
wheat protein. You can buy mixes for seitan at natural foods stores, but most 
people find it far more convenient to buy it ready-made. Look for it  in the 
refrigerated sections of natural foods stores.
 
One of the best ways to sample seitan is at a Chinese or Thai restaurant, 
where you can try it prepared in different ways. It’s often served in chunks or 
strips in a stir-fry.
Seitan dishes are absolutely scrumptious. Don’t be surprised if you get 
hooked on the stuff. But because seitan is relatively unfamiliar to most 
Westerners, you aren’t likely to find it in small-town or even medium-sized-
city restaurants. You’ll usually see it in big-city Asian restaurants   where the 
menu is fairly extensive.
After you’ve been living vegetarian for a while, you’ll discover many more 
interesting and delicious vegetarian specialty products.
Exploring Natural and Organic 
Alternatives
Living vegetarian doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to buy and eat 
natural or organic foods. If you are a vegetarian, though, or if you’re just 
interested in eating healthfully, you probably want to know something about 
these distinctions. In this section, I help you understand what these terms 
mean and how to assess their importance.

104
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Going au naturel
No legal  definition exists for the term natural foods, but the term is generally 
understood to mean that a food has been minimally processed and is free 
of artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and any other additives that don’t 
occur naturally in the food.
Assessing the benefits of natural foods
Natural foods are  frequently better choices than their mainstream counter-
parts because they lack the undesirable ingredients of many commercially 
processed foods and they contain more nutritious ingredients.
For instance, natural breakfast cereals, baking mixes,  and bread products 
contain no partially hydrogenated fats, so they’re trans fat-free. They’re usu-
ally made with whole grains, so they contain more dietary fiber, vitamins, 
and minerals than products made with refined grains.
Natural foods are usually minimally sweetened, and when they   are sweet-
ened, less sweetener is used. Fruit juice is frequently used as a sweetener in 
lieu of refined sugar. Natural foods also typically contain less sodium  than 
other foods, and they contain no monosodium glutamate   or nitrites. The 
ingredients used in natural foods products are often organically grown,  too.
Knowing when natural isn’t enough
 
Just because a food is natural doesn’t mean it’s nutritious. Believe it or not, 
natural junk foods do exist. Many natural sweets, candies, and snack foods 
have little nutritional value, just like their conventional counterparts. Even 
though they’re natural, you should limit your consumption of them. Don’t let 
these foods displace more nut ritious foods in your diet.
Finding natural foods
Even within a particular   category of food products, you usually find more 
healthful choices in a natural foods store than in a regular supermarket. For 
instance, in a regular supermarket  you may find several types of whole-grain 
pasta. In a natural foods store, you’re likely to find an entire shelf of them. The 
same is often true of breakfast cereals and many other product categories.
Opting for organic
 
The word organic applies to foods that are grown without persistent or toxic 
fertilizers and pesticides, using farming methods that are ecologically sound 
and earth-friendly. Organic foods must be produced and processed with-
out the use of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, genetic engineering, sewage 
sludge, or irradiation.

105
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with Common Vegetarian Ingredients
The widest variety of organic products is available at natural foods stores, 
but most conventional grocery stores now also stock organic produce and 
organic processed and packaged foods. Natural foods stores in particular 
often carry seasonal organic produce from local farmers. Buying locally sup-
ports small farmers in the community and helps ensure the freshness of the 
products.
 
If you don’t have access to a big natural foods store with a good supply of 
organic produce, seek out local farmers at roadside stands or at farmer’s mar-
kets where you can buy locally grown fruits and vegetables in season. Ask the 
farmer about his or her use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Some small 
farmers don’t go to the hassle and expense of applying for organic certifica-
tion of their crops, even though they use sustainable farming methods and 
their products may, in fact, be organic. Get to know your farmer, and ask.
 
Organically grown fruits and vegetables generally have the same nutritional 
value as conventionally grown produce, but they’re often not as pretty as 
those grown with chemical fertilizers and pesticides. They may have small 
blemishes, and they won’t be glossy like their nonorganic counterparts, which 
often have a waxy coating added. Don’t let the appearance of organically 
grown foods deter you from buying them.
Deciphering organic labels
For decades, the natural foods industry self-regulated and adhered to its own 
high standards for organic farming and food processing practices. In recent 
years, though, the market for organic foods has grown dramatically. As more 
commercial interests entered the organic foods market, longstanding organic 
standards became threatened.
 
In conjunction with the 1990 Farm Bill, the U.S. Congress passed the Organic 
Foods Production Act. Years of public discussion and debate followed, includ-
ing considerable debate and disagreement between longstanding organic 
foods advocates and commercial newcomers who wanted to loosen the stan-
dards. In 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) implemented a final 
rule establishing national organic standards. The rule maintains the high stan-
dards originally established by the old-guard natural product industry.
Organic growers and food manufacturers can have their products certified 
as “USDA Organic” through third-party state and private agencies accredited 
by the USDA. Labeling regulations permit products to be labeled “100 Percent 
Organic” if all ingredients meet the organic standards. Both these products 
and those containing at least 95 percent organic ingredients (the remaining 5 
percent must also be approved for use in organic products) may display the 
“USDA Organic” label.
Products that contain at least 70 percent organic ingredients may be labeled 
as such on package ingredient lists.

106
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Weighing the choice: Organic versus conventional produce
I’ll convey the most important point first: Eat more fruits and vegetables, 
whether they’re organic or conventional. Most of us need to increase sub-
stantially our intake of produce, and that’s easier to do for vegetarians than 
meat-eaters.
After you’ve done that, you can think about whether you want to eat organic 
or conventional produce.
Very few studies have looked at the potential health effects of long-term 
exposure to low doses of pesticides, herbicides, and other contaminants, but 
it makes sense to avoid unnecessary exposure when possible. You may never 
know whether your diet ultimately delayed or prevented illness, but it seems 
prudent to err on the side of safety.
On the other hand, organic foods have disadvantages, too: cost and access. 
Not everyone can afford to pay extra for organic. And despite the growth in 
sales of organic foods, not everyone lives in neighborhoods where supermar-
kets stock a big supply of them.
 
If you don’t have access to organic produce or can’t afford it, cheer up. If you 
eat a diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, the fiber content 
of your diet will help remove environmental contaminants from your body. 
Roughage binds with contaminants and helps move waste through your 
system faster, leaving contaminants less time to be in contact with the lining 
of your intestines.
 
You can also take a practical approach to organics and avoid the dirty 
dozen — the 12 fruits and vegetables that are most likely to be contaminated, 
according to the Environmental Working Group. Avoid the conventional ver-
sions of these items if you can and instead buy organic: apples, bell peppers, 
carrots, celery, cherries, imported grapes, kale, lettuce, nectarines, peaches, 
pears, and strawberries. A pocket guide or iPhone application is available 
online from the EWG at www.foodnews.org/index.php.

Shopping and Stocking 
Your Vegetarian Pantry
In This Chapter
▶ Buying the food items you need
▶ Deciding where to shop
▶ Using shopping strategies
▶ Saving money when shopping
M
uch of the challenge of eating well on a vegetarian diet is having the 
staple ingredients on hand when you need them. Shopping for these 
supplies can be a rewarding adventure, partly because living vegetarian can 
open you to culinary options you may never have considered.
This chapter is devoted to helping you understand how to go about the task 
of getting the right supplies into your house — at the right price. I encourage 
you to go beyond your neighborhood  supermarket to explore places you may 
never have set foot in to search for good foods. I also cover some important 
shopping strategies, including ways to save money without sacrificing quality 
or nutritional value.
Figuring Out What You Need
Before you head to the store, you should have a concrete plan for what you 
want to buy. You’ll be more likely to end up having the range and types of 
foods you need to build healthy meals at home, and you’ll be less likely to 
come home with impulsive, less-than-ideal purchases, or to forget to buy a 
key ingredient.

108
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
The first step in creating a plan is to look at your overall nutritional goals. 
From there, you draft a shopping list.
Sketching out your meal plans
In Chapter 3, I cover the basics of vegetarian nutrition and provide back-
ground information about meeting your needs for vitamins, minerals, protein, 
and other components of a health-supporting diet.
This nutrition information is shown in the quick-reference guide in Figure 7-1. 
Use this information to help you think about the foods that belong on your 
plate and on your shopping list.

Use the following tips in conjunction with Figure 7-1 to help you sketch out 
your meal plans:
 
✓ Eat a variety of foods, and get enough servings to meet your energy 
needs.
 
✓ Eat at least 8 servings of calcium-rich foods from the food guide in Figure 
7-1. These foods can pull double-duty and count as servings from other 
food groups at the same time. For example, a serving of calcium-fortified 
orange juice also counts as a serving from the fruit group.

109
 Chapter 7: Shopping and Stocking Your Vegetarian Pantry
 
✓ Every day, include 2 servings of foods that contain n-3 fats. Find these 
foods in the legumes/nuts group and in the fats group. Examples of one 
serving of these foods include the following:
 
• 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of flaxseed oil
 
• 3 teaspoons (15 milliliters) of canola or soybean oil
 
• 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of ground flaxseed
 
• 1⁄4 cup (60 milliliters) of walnuts
 
 Use primarily canola oil and olive oil for cooking to help ensure an opti-
mal balance of fatty acids in your diet.
 
✓ You can count nuts and seeds as servings from the fat group.
 
✓ Be sure to get enough vitamin D through sun exposure, eating fortified 
foods, or taking a supplement.
 
✓ Get at least three reliable food sources of vitamin B12 in your diet every 
day. One serving is equal to the following:
 
• 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of Red Star Vegetarian Support 
Formula nutritional yeast
 
• 1 cup (250 milliliters) fortified soymilk
 
• 1⁄2 cup (125 milliliters) cow’s milk
 
• 3⁄4 cup (185 milliliters) yogurt
 
• 1 ounce (28 grams) of fortified breakfast cereal
 
 If you don’t consistently get enough vitamin B12 from food sources, 
take a B12 supplement. Aim for 5 to 10 micrograms each day, or take a 
weekly supplement of 2,000 micrograms.
 
✓ Keep your intake of sweets and alcohol to a minimum to help ensure 
that you have enough room in your diet for the nutritious foods listed in 
the food guide.
Keeping a grocery list
People have different shopping styles, just as they have different personali-
ties. Some people like to plan their week’s meals, draw up a correspond-
ing shopping list, and buy only what they need to make the meals they’ve 
planned. Other people prefer the casual approach — walk up and down the 
aisles, and put whatever strikes their fancy into their basket. At home,   they 
decide what they’re having for dinner based on what they feel like making 
and the supplies they have on hand.

110
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
Do what works for you. However, be aware that maintaining a list does have 
its advantages, especially when you’ve made a change in your eating habits 
and are developing new eating skills. Planning ahead gives you more control 
over your meals.
The grocery lists that follow are only suggestions of what you may want to 
buy to stock your vegetarian kitchen. You can adapt them to suit your indi-
vidual preferences. If you like them just the way they are, you may want to 
photocopy them and  make enough copies to last a few months. Tape a fresh 
list to the door of your refrigerator after each shopping trip. Check off items 
that you need and add any that aren’t listed. I provide separate lists for items 
that you buy weekly and items that you buy less often.
Shopping by the week
You have to purchase the foods on this list fairly frequently because they’re 
perishable and will keep in the refrigerator  for only a week or two before 
spoiling. Use the list to help you decide which foods you want to buy this 
week. Vary your choices depending on seasonal availability of fruits and veg-
etables or just to help ensure you get a good mix of nutrients in your diet.

Let’s Go Shopping! Considering 
the Options
Many people — especially vegetarians — find that they purchase certain 
items at one store and others at another store. For instance, you may shop 
at a natural foods store to buy frozen vegetarian entrées, specialty baking 
mixes, whole-grain pastas and breakfast cereals, and your favorite brand of 
soymilk by the case. Then perhaps you shop at a conventional supermarket 
for such items as toilet paper, fresh produce, and toothpaste.
It all depends on your individual preferences. This section includes a quick 
rundown of your options, listed generally in order of most to least common.
Your neighborhood supermarket
Conventional supermarkets have undergone a transformation during the past 
ten years because of the rapid expansion of the natural foods and organic 
foods markets. In years past, your neighborhood supermarket may have had 
a special aisle for “health foods” where the soymilk and vegetarian specialty 
items were shelved. Today, these foods are more likely to be integrated with 
all the other foods in the store.
Your neighborhood supermarket also probably carries a much wider variety 
of natural products, organic foods, and vegetarian specialty items than it did 
in the past. Depending on the store, the selection may be comprehensive 
enough that you can do most of your shopping in one stop.

115
 Chapter 7: Shopping and Stocking Your Vegetarian Pantry
Warehouse stores
 
Buying in volume can be economical, but it isn’t always the best approach. 
Think carefully before you buy a giant jar of pickles, a huge bottle of ketchup, 
or a 20-pound bag of rice! Not only can storage space be a challenge, but some 
foods may spoil before you can reasonably use them up.
An extra large bottle of vegetable oil, for example, may go rancid before you 
can use it all. Buy too many croutons, and they may become stale before you 
get to the bag’s bottom.
On the other hand, warehouse stores can be a good place to find excellent 
values on such vegetarian staples as canned beans, tubs of hummus, veggie 
burger patties, and other meatless specialty items.
Natural foods stores
If you’ve never set foot in a natural foods store, now’s the time to do it. You 
may not shop there for all your groceries and supplies, but you should take 
a look at the many vegetarian specialty items and other great choices avail-
able. Natural foods stores include large national chains such as Whole Foods, 
regional chains such as Earth Fare in the Southeast, and local mom-and-pop 
stores.
Some people buy everything they need at natural foods stores, including 
nonfood items, because natural foods stores often carry a wider selection 
of environmentally-friendly cleaning supplies and paper goods than other 
stores. Big natural foods stores are common in  large, metropolitan areas, 
and prices may be better and the variety greater than in cities that have only 
small stores.
Farmer’s markets and CSA farms
Many communities have farmer’s markets where small farmers sell locally 
grown, seasonal fruits and vegetables. You can often find locally produced 
honey, jams and jellies, and baked goods at the farmer’s market, too.
 
Not all sellers who grow and produce their foods organically pay to have their 
foods certified as organic, so ask your local farmers for details about their 
approach. That’s an advantage to buying from local farmers — you can estab-
lish a relationship with these people over time and grow to know and trust 
their food.

116
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
Be careful, though. Some farmer’s markets permit large wholesalers to sell 
out-of-state products. Ask questions about the source of the produce you see 
to make sure you’re getting locally grown food, if that’s important to you.
An alternative or supplement to seasonal produce from the farmer’s market is 
food from a CSA farm. CSA stands for community-supported agriculture. Residents 
of a community pay a local farmer a predetermined amount of money upfront. In 
return, they get a portion of the harvest throughout the growing season. If you 
subscribe to a CSA farm, expect to pick up your food at a centrally agreed-upon 
site. In some cases, home delivery may also be available.
 
The advantages to getting your food from farmer’s markets and CSA farms is 
that foods are more likely to be fresh and at their peak of nutritional value, 
and you support your local farmers by giving them your business.
Ethnic food markets
Shopping at ethnic supermarkets can be an entertaining and enjoyable expe-
rience. Go with an open mind and be ready to experiment with a few foods 
you’ve never tried before.
You’re more likely to find these markets in larger metropolitan areas and in 
communities with large concentrations of immigrants from different countries. 
In some cities, you’ll find many different types of ethnic grocery stores — 
Indian, Asian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, kosher, and many more. Each one car-
ries foods and ingredients that are commonly eaten in those cultures but are 
frequently difficult  to find in mainstream U.S. stores.
In Indian stores, for  instance, you’ll be amazed to see the many types of len-
tils that you can buy — red, orange, yellow, brown, and so on. You may find 
small, skillet-sized pressure cookers used in India to quick-cook dried beans 
and lentils. You’ll also find unusual spices and a variety of Indian breads.
 
You may see the same products — Indian heat-and-serve, single-serving 
entrées, for example — at conventional supermarkets at substantially higher 
prices. Go with a list, especially if you have to drive a distance to get to the 
store.
In Asian stores, you’ll find vegetables  such as some Chinese greens that are 
shipped to the store from overseas but that aren’t typically found in U.S. 
stores. You’ll find unusual condiments as well.
In all these stores, you’ll see a wide range of traditional foods, many of which 
are vegetarian or just different and which you can incorporate into your 
vegetarian menus at home. More than anything, a trip to one of these stores 
may inspire you to sample foods of another culture and to expand your own 
culinary repertoire.

117
 Chapter 7: Shopping and Stocking Your Vegetarian Pantry
Food cooperatives
Many communities also have  food cooperatives, or co-ops. A co-op is a group 
that purchases foods in volume for distribution to its members, usually at 
a reduced cost. The costs are reduced because of the power of the group 
to buy in volume, so larger groups may be able to get better prices than 
smaller groups. Co-ops frequently emphasize natural foods products, and the 
arrangement can be especially helpful in small towns and rural areas, where 
people don’t have access to large  natural foods stores with good variety and 
competitive prices.
Membership rules vary from one co-op to another. Some co-ops ask their 
members to contribute a certain number of hours each month to help unload 
trucks and bag or distribute groceries. Others don’t require that you work, 
but they may give an additional discount to those who donate their time.
Gourmet stores
Upscale or gourmet foods stores are a fun place to look for interesting spe-
cialty items such as jams and preserves, other condiments, canned soups, 
pasta sauce, and a wide variety of packaged foods, often from boutique pro-
ducers or international sources. Many of these products are appropriate for 
vegetarians. The downside: They’re often expensive. Gourmet stores can be 
a good place to shop, though, if you need a special gift for the vegetarian on 
your list.
Web sites and catalogs
 
Another alternative   for people who don’t have time to shop or can’t find cer-
tain food items in their local stores is to shop via mail-order catalog or online 
stores such as Pangea (www.veganstore.com) or the Mail Order Catalog for 
Healthy Eating (www.healthy-eating.com). Be aware, though, that ship-
ping and handling charges can be substantial.
Other places to try
Bargain stores such as Grocery Outlet are good places to check for deeply 
discounted vegetarian specialty products. Inventories change frequently, so 
you may not be able to find a specific item if you need it. If you’re open to 
surprises, though, you may find some good buys.

118
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Similarly, specialty stores such as Trader Joe’s often carry a sizable selec-
tion of vegetarian foods at competitive prices. Look for name brands here, as 
well as products such as soymilk and rice milk sold under the store’s private 
label.
Making the Most of Your 
Shopping Adventure
Regardless of where you shop, a few more tips and suggestions may help 
ensure that you have a good supply of nutritious ingredients on hand at 
home. The ideas I include in this section have worked for me and for many 
other vegetarian shoppers.
Slowing down to see what’s new
Every now and then, spend a little more time than usual roaming up and 
down each aisle of your favorite store to find out what’s new. It’s a good way 
to notice products you may like but didn’t know were available.
That’s especially true in the produce department. Many people make a bee-
line for the iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and don’t notice much else. Take 
an extra ten minutes to peruse the piles of colorful fruits and vegetables, and 
pick up something you’ve never tried before.
Experimenting with new foods 
and products
Speaking of trying foods that are new to you . . .
Expect to find a few duds. Along the way, though, you’re also likely to find 
some new favorite foods. Unless you take a risk and try something new, you 
may never know what you’re missing!
That’s the way I discovered — and grew to love — mangoes and papayas. I 
didn’t like the flavor of mango the first time I tasted it, but I tried it again. By 
the second or third try, I was hooked.

119
 Chapter 7: Shopping and Stocking Your Vegetarian Pantry
If you haven’t tried soymilk, soy yogurt, meatless hot dogs, or meatless 
burger crumbles (for tacos, burritos, and spaghetti sauce), I highly recom-
mend them. If you’ve never eaten an arugula salad or fresh kale, let the reci-
pes in Chapters 11 and 12 be your introductions.
Don’t see what you need? 
Ask the manager
If you want to buy a specific product but you don’t see it in your favorite 
store, ask to speak with the manager. Chances are good that she can place a 
special order for you.
 
Store managers can often arrange for you to purchase certain foods such as 
soymilk and canned or bottled foods by the case at a discount. If the demand 
is high enough, the store may even begin to stock that product regularly.
Keeping Your Costs Under Control
Living vegetarian can be a very cost-effective lifestyle. Diets that include little 
or no meat, eggs, cheese, or other dairy products tend to be built around foods 
that are relatively inexpensive, such as beans, pasta, rice, and vegetables.
 
The economy of a vegetarian diet can be lost, though, if you find yourself 
depending on too many specialty products and ready-made foods. To hold 
down the cost of your meals, keep the suggestions in this section in mind.
Collecting the building blocks 
to keep on hand
It’s important to keep a good supply of basic ingredients on hand so that you 
can whip up a meal in a relatively short amount of time. The most practical 
ingredients are shelf-stable — you can leave them in your pantry for several 
months before using them. Good examples include pasta, canned soups, sev-
eral varieties of canned beans, pasta sauce, rice, dry cereal, hot cereal, and 
condiments. Most of these items are inexpensive.
Good freezer basics include several types of frozen vegetables, veggie burger 
patties, whole-grain rolls and bread, and frozen, mixed berries (for a quick 
dessert, see the Berry Cobbler recipe in Chapter 14).

120
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Buying in volume — or not
 
Buying in volume isn’t always the most economical way to shop. If food spoils 
before you can use it, you may end up spending more than you otherwise would 
have spent on a smaller quantity of food. If you shop at a warehouse store, you 
may also want to factor in the membership cost in addition to the cost of the 
food itself when evaluating whether buying in large quantities is economical.
 
One remedy: Consider saving by buying in volume and splitting the item with 
a friend. For example, you may buy a case of oranges or a large container of 
pre-washed salad greens and each take half.
Perusing private labels and store brands
Compare prices among brands. Private label and store brand products — 
including breakfast cereals, canned goods, soymilk, peanut butter, and many 
other foods — can cost significantly less than similar brand-name products. 
The quality is often indistinguishable from one brand to the next, too. You 
won’t know until you try!
Scaling back on specialty items
Expensive specialty items — gourmet condiments, frozen entrées licensed 
by famous chefs, and many boutique-brand packaged foods — can take a 
big bite out of your food budget. Give them as gifts now and then, and enjoy 
the champagne raspberry preserves when a jar comes your way. In general, 
though, these foods are too costly to be staples for most of us. Scale back on 
these items if you’re working on keeping your costs under control.
 
Similarly, many specialty products in natural foods stores can be pricey. One 
way to save money at natural foods stores is to buy staples — beans, rice, len-
tils, granola, seeds, and nuts — from bulk food bins. You won’t pay for unnec-
essary packaging, and you can take only the amount you need.
Getting the best value — nutritiously
Sometimes, the best value isn’t the least expensive option.
For example, a standard bag of carrots from your supermarket may remain in 
your refrigerator so long that the veggies turn to rubber. You can pay more 
for a bag of prepeeled carrots (or any prewashed, preprepared vegetable), 
and if the added convenience helps ensure that you eat your veggies, the 
extra cost may be worth it.

121
 Chapter 7: Shopping and Stocking Your Vegetarian Pantry
On the other hand, junk foods — such as many packaged cookies, cakes, 
and other desserts — are also relatively expensive. If you have them in your 
house, you’re very likely to eat them. By keeping them out of the house in the 
first place, you not only save money but also protect the nutritional quality of 
your diet, too.
Cooking meals at home
The typical American spends about 40 percent of his food budget on meals 
eaten away from home. That means that eating more meals at home can 
potentially save you a lot of money.
Establish the habit of making simple meals at home. The information I cover 
in Parts II and III in this book — as well as in Chapter 16 — can help you get 
started.
 
Consider growing some of your own ingredients, too. Tomatoes, bell peppers, 
lettuce, and herbs such as basil and parsley are easy to grow, even in small 
spaces. You’ll save money, and fresh ingredients for your homecooked meals 
will be right outside your back door.

Chapter 8
Cooking Tools and Techniques
In This Chapter
▶ Assessing your equipment needs
▶ Knowing the fundamentals of vegetarian cooking
▶ Giving new life to old recipes
▶ Getting familiar with alternative ingredients
A
dopting a vegetarian diet is a good reason to brush up on basic cooking 
skills. If you understand how to use simple tools and techniques in the 
kitchen, you’ll be able to enjoy more healthful, good-tasting vegetarian meals 
in your own home.
That’s important.
The more meals you eat at home instead of away, the more money you save, 
and the more control you have over the ingredients in the food. Preparing 
your own meals gives you the flexibility to adapt traditional recipes by 
removing the meat and other animal ingredients. It’s also a good way to 
improve the overall quality of your diet, because you can cut back on added 
sodium and sugar at the same time that you limit artery-clogging saturated 
fat and cholesterol from meat, eggs, cheese, and other dairy products.
Cooking your own vegetarian meals at home from scratch or by using some 
convenient shortcuts also gives you an opportunity to be creative. After you 
develop confidence in your cooking skills, you’ll be able to experiment with 
new and delicious combinations of basic ingredients — vegetables, rice, 
pasta, beans, and fruit. You’ll be less likely to get into a rut and more likely to 
be the mealtime destination of choice among your family and friends.
In this chapter, I introduce the tools you need to fix simple vegetarian meals. 
I cover the ins and outs of cooking with some common vegetarian ingredients 
and convenience products, as well as how to modify your favorite nonveg-
etarian family recipes to make them veg-compatible. The emphasis is on 
simple and practical ways to be your own vegetarian chef.

124
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Tools You Really Need
The world is full of kitchen gadgets and appliances that make the work easier 
and save you time. You can do without them, but having them makes cooking 
more enjoyable.
Then there are the true necessities, the tools without which it would be very 
difficult to cook from scratch. In this section, I outline the equipment you 
need to outfit a basic vegetarian kitchen.
 
Use the lists I provide to do a quick inventory of your own kitchen. Consider 
what’s missing and what you need to buy. Yard sales and kitchen supply out-
lets are great places to pick up inexpensive but serviceable pieces.
 
Spend the time to make sure you have the equipment you need for a fully func-
tional kitchen. If you don’t have what you need, you may find it frustrating — and 
even unsafe — to perform simple cooking tasks. Using a serrated knife instead of 
a paring knife to peel an apple, for example, is a good way to do a poor job and cut 
your finger while you’re at it.
Pots and pans
You don’t need a large collection and they don’t have to be top-of-the-line, 
but you do need several good-quality pots and pans in various sizes. Invest 
now and you’ll use these to make a lifetime’s worth of health-supporting veg-
etarian meals.
 
Stainless steel is clean, safe to use, and a good choice for most pots and pans. 
Choose four to six of the following to handle most of your cooking needs, from 
pasta sauce and potatoes to chili and soup:
 
✓ 1-quart saucepan
 
✓ 2-quart saucepan
 
✓ 3-quart saucepan
 
✓ 4-quart saucepan
 
✓ 41⁄2-quart pot
 
✓ 6-quart pot or larger (such as a stock pot or stew pot), if you cook for a 
crowd

125
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
 
A skillet is also invaluable. You’ll use it for everything from frying pancakes 
and grilling sandwiches to sautéing onions and mushrooms. Choose a heavy-
duty, 10-inch, cast-iron skillet from a company with a reputation for making 
such high-quality products, like Lodge (www.lodgemfg.com). Stainless steel 
is fine, too. I also recommend getting one or more of the following:
 
✓ 7-inch skillet
 
✓ 9-inch skillet
 
✓ 12-inch skillet
 
Try to get at least one skillet lid — it comes in handy for steaming greens and 
other times when you need to hold the heat in with what you’re cooking. If 
you buy the same brand of pots, pans, and skillets, it’s likely that one or more 
of the lids that come with some of the pieces will fit other pieces as well.
Knives
You may have noticed the large wooden knife blocks that some people keep 
in their kitchens, filled with an assortment of scary-looking blades that have 
figured prominently in several bad movies.
Vegetarians have no need for all those flesh-piercing utensils.
 
All you need is four different kinds of knives, and only one looks like it could 
play a role in an action flick (Figure 8-1 shows you what some of these knives 
look like):
 
✓ 6-inch, serrated knife. Use it for cutting fruits and vegetables, especially 
tomatoes. You’ll use this knife more than any other.
 
✓ Paring knife. This is for cutting certain fruits like apples and pears, peel-
ing potatoes, and similar tasks. The blade is short — 3 or 4 inches — so 
it’s easy to maneuver.
 
✓ 10-inch, serrated bread knife. Use this for cutting cakes and similar 
foods.
 
✓ 10-inch chef’s knife. This one has a long blade that’s widest near the 
handle, gradually tapering to a point at the end. Holding the point on the 
cutting board, you rock the blade up and down from the handle to chop 
salad greens, fresh vegetables, fruits, and other ingredients.

cooking.
 
Assorted extras
Most vegetarian cooks need some baking supplies, including pans, sheets, 
measuring cups, and utensils. At a minimum, you need:
 
✓ Two cookie sheets
 
✓ Muffin tin for baking cupcakes and muffins
 
✓ 8-inch square baking pan
 
✓ 9-x-13-inch baking pan
 
✓ Two loaf pans
 
✓ Two pie tins (cake pans aren’t as useful, so they’re optional)
 
✓ Set of two or three stainless steel mixing bowls
 
✓ At least one set of dry measuring cups
 
✓ At least one set of measuring spoons
 
✓ 2-cup liquid measuring cup
You may be able to whip a yogurt dressing with a fork and spread hummus 
into a serving bowl with the flat side of a place knife, but having the proper 
utensils for certain uses in the kitchen gives you better results. The following 
items are so practical that I deem them necessary for a complete vegetarian 
kitchen:
 
✓ Three or four wooden spoons in various shapes and sizes
 
✓ Two or three silicon spatulas
 
✓ Stainless steel spatula for flipping pancakes and veggie burgers or 
removing cookies from a cookie sheet
 
✓ Soup ladle
 
✓ Stainless steel colander
 
✓ Pizza cutter
 
✓ Pastry brush

127
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
 
✓ Pastry blender
 
✓ Pasta fork
 
✓ Two stainless steel whisks
 
✓ Hand-held bean or potato masher
 
✓ Large, stainless steel, slotted spoon
 
A well-equipped kitchen also includes attractive and functional serving bowls 
and plates, as well as at least a few clean, attractive tablecloths, placemats, 
cloth napkins, and decorative hot pads or trivets to place under hot dishes on 
the table. These features are important, because the way in which you pres-
ent food can influence how well others receive the food. If it looks appealing, 
people are more likely to expect it to taste good.
Handy Appliances You May 
Actually Use
If you’re like many people, you have an appliance graveyard lurking in the 
back of a kitchen cupboard or pantry. Those bread machines and waffle irons 
that seemed like a good idea at the time are collecting cobwebs in dark cor-
ners around the house.
 
One key to positioning yourself to cook your own vegetarian food at home is 
to clear some space. If your countertop and drawers are jammed with appli-
ances and gadgets that you seldom use, get rid of them. Donate them or pack 
them away, but remove them from your kitchen. Make room so that you have 
easy access to the few appliances you may actually use to make daily meal 
prep easier and faster.
Which tools you need depends on the kinds of foods you like best and how 
you feel about performing certain kitchen tasks. For example, I like using 
an old-fashioned, crank-style can opener that I keep in a kitchen drawer. An 
advantage is that I don’t have an electric can opener taking up space on my 
countertop.
And not everybody needs a large, countertop mixer. A hand-held mixer may 
work just fine for your needs, or maybe all you need is a simple whisk. Think 
about your equipment needs and remove what you don’t need to free up pre-
cious kitchen space.
In the following sections, I tell you about several appliances that many veg-
etarians find particularly handy.

128
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
High-speed blenders
Blenders are useful for whipping up fresh fruit smoothies and fresh vegetable 
blends. An advantage of a high-speed blender over a juicer — another popu-
lar appliance — is that it preserves the dietary fiber in fruits and vegetables 
and may be easier to clean.
 
Ordinary kitchen blenders are inexpensive, but their motors tend to overheat 
easily when the blender is used to process thick mixtures such as hummus 
(see the recipe in Chapter 10) and some smoothies (Chapter 9 includes two 
smoothie recipes). A heavy-duty, restaurant-quality blender such as the 
Vita-Mix (www.vita-mix.com) holds an advantage over ordinary blenders 
because it has a larger capacity and stronger motor. The trade-off is that the 
Vita-Mix is much more expensive.
 
Make cold melon soup by placing fresh cantaloupe or honeydew chunks, 
nonfat plain yogurt, and a few teaspoons of honey in a blender and processing 
until creamy. For thinner soup, add orange or apple juice by the tablespoon 
until the soup reaches the right consistency. Serve in a rimmed soup bowl 
with a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg and a sprig of fresh mint on top.
Food processors
Mini food processors — those with only a one- or two-cup capacity — can be 
a great help in grating, mincing, and chopping small amounts quickly. I use 
mine to grate carrots or a small chunk of red cabbage for color in a salad, or 
when I don’t feel like chopping an onion by hand.
Larger, full-capacity food processors are a must-have in many vegetarian 
households. They make quick work of larger chopping jobs, and the results 
are often more consistent than when you chop by hand.
 
It’s amazingly simple and quick to make fresh gazpacho — a cold, traditional 
Spanish soup made with fresh vegetables — using a food processor. You’ll 
find many variations, but most include one or more of the following ingredi-
ents, blended until smooth: fresh, uncooked tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, 
bell peppers, celery, olive oil, chives, minced garlic, red wine vinegar, and 
lemon juice. I include a recipe for Classic Gazpacho in Chapter 11.
Rice cookers
One of the pitfalls of cooking rice the traditional way — in a pot on the 
stovetop — is that if you don’t watch it carefully, the rice can quickly boil 
over and make a mess. Enter the rice lover’s best friend: the rice cooker.

129
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
Some people swear by their rice cooker for that reason: It lets you make 
perfectly steamed rice while you’re out of the kitchen doing something other 
than watching the stove. Rice is also a mainstay of many ethnic vegetarian 
meals — as an accompaniment to Indian and Asian entrées as well as with a 
variety of bean dishes. You can find several recipes in Chapter 12.
 
A great way to store leftover rice is to portion it into airtight plastic bags and 
place them in the freezer. The rice will keep for months that way. When you’re 
ready to use it, transfer the frozen rice onto a plate or into a bowl and reheat it 
in a microwave oven. Eat it with leftover chili, stew, stir-fry, or Indian entrées.
Pressure cookers
Name a gadget that can cook a two-hour meal in ten minutes. Nope, it’s not a 
magic wand — it’s a pressure cooker. A pressure cooker enables you to cook a 
vegetarian casserole, stew, or bean dish in the time it takes to set the table.
 
The way a pressure cooker works is simple. You place foods such as beans, 
rice, lentils, or root vegetables in the cooker with water or another liquid. You 
tightly seal the pot and set it over high heat on the stove. As the steam inside 
the pot builds, the pressure inside the pot increases, raising the temperature 
to 250 degrees — far above the boiling point of 212 degrees. Under these con-
ditions, foods get soft and cook faster than they would by other means.
Some people remember their mother’s — or grandmother’s — old jiggle-top 
pressure cooker from 30 years ago or more. Those old-fashioned pressure 
cookers hissed, rattled, and clanged so violently that at times they seemed as 
if they were about to blow a hole through the ceiling.
Newer jiggle-top pressure cookers from companies such as Mirro and Presto 
are much easier and safer to use and include features that prevent too much 
pressure from building up.
European companies such as Kuhn Rikon, Magefesa, and Zepter make pres-
sure cookers with stationary pressure regulators instead of the old jiggle-top 
variety. Stationary regulators don’t clog as easily, making it safer to leave 
the kitchen while the cooker is in use. These newer pressure cookers are 
quieter and may require less water to reach high pressure. After the food is 
done, you can release the pressure on the stovetop, in contrast to old models 
that had to be set in the sink and doused in cold water to bring the pressure 
down.
You can find a variety of pressure cookers in specialty stores, as well as 
some good buys online. You may even find some sold in Indian food markets, 
including short, squatty, pressure frying pans. Pressure cookers are a stan-
dard tool in Indian cooking because they’re so useful in shortening the cook-
ing time for lentils, rice, and many of the dried beans used in Indian dishes.

130
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Pressure cookers come in several shapes and sizes. If you want only one, a 6- or 
8-quart cooker is the most practical size to buy. It may look big, but when you 
use a pressure cooker, you fill it from only one-half to three-quarters full. The 
remainder of the space is needed for the steam that builds up inside the pot.
 
Note that European models designate the volume of the pot in liters rather 
than quarts. A 6-liter pressure cooker is roughly equivalent to a 6.5-quart 
cooker; a 7-liter cooker is about the same size as a 7.5-quart cooker. Prices 
vary widely by make and model.
 
If you want to try your hand at using a pressure cooker, a good resource is 
Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure by pressure cooker guru Lorna J. Sass 
(William Morrow Cookbooks). Another good resource is registered dietitian 
Jill Nussinow, “The Veggie Queen.” Visit her Web site at www.pressure
cookingonline.com.
Slow cookers
A ’70s-era kitchen aid that’s enjoying a comeback is the slow cooker, a remov-
able stoneware crock with a lid set into a heating element. Slow cookers 
allow you to dump ingredients into a pot, turn on the heat, and walk away. 
At the end of the day, you come home to the smell of dinner, ready to serve, 
wafting through your home.
Newer models include timer and temperature controls, whereas the original 
model had only a few settings. Slow cookers come in various sizes, from very 
small — good for singles and couples — to family-sized models. Others are 
made with locking lids, carrying handles, and travel bags for people who 
want to cook and carry a dish to get-togethers with family and friends.
 
Slow cookers work well for making vegetarian-style meals with combinations 
of vegetables, beans, lentils, and grains such as rice, oatmeal, bulgur wheat, 
and others. For example, you can use a slow cooker to make the recipes for 
Fruited Oatmeal (see Chapter 9), Lentil Soup (see Chapter 11), Cashew Chili 
(see Chapter 11), Cuban Black Beans and Rice (see Chapter 12), and Cajun Red 
Beans and Rice (see Chapter 12).
Electric teakettles
Electric teakettles are relatively inexpensive — under $40, or about the cost 
of a common coffee maker — and they can save you time. Just add hot water 
and flip the switch. You get boiling water in less time than it takes to heat 
water on the stovetop.

131
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
It’s a quick and very convenient way to have hot water in a hurry when you 
want to make a single serving of oatmeal, a soup cup, or a hot drink. It’s also 
useful for rehydrating bean flakes and instant couscous used in some veg-
etarian dishes, and for giving a jump-start to a pot of hot water for cooking 
pasta or rice.
Vegetarian Cooking Basics
You don’t have to be a professional chef to fix good vegetarian meals. You 
don’t even have to impress your friends. All you have to do is satisfy yourself 
(and your family — maybe).
If you’re already an accomplished cook, you probably need no reassurance 
that you’ll be adept at fixing vegetarian masterpieces after you figure out 
what you want to make. That won’t take long, because you’re already skilled 
and creative.
On the other hand, if you’re like most people, you’re no pro, but you some-
how manage to put together reasonably appealing meals most of the time. 
Usually, that means whipping dinner together in a half hour or less, with the 
emphasis on less.
Vegetarian cooking can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. 
In this section, I cover some of the basic skills that any beginning vegetarian 
needs.
Mastering simple cooking skills
Becoming comfortable and confident in the kitchen takes time and practice. 
Like driving a car or knitting a sweater, you get better at it over time.
Each of the cooking techniques I describe requires hands-on experience. 
If you’re a beginning cook, consider asking an experienced friend or family 
member to guide you at the start, or look into taking a cooking class at your 
local natural foods store or community college.
Baking
You’ll use your oven to make many vegetarian foods, including casseroles, 
baked potatoes, breads and rolls, pies, winter squash, and more. A few key 
points are important to follow when you bake:

132
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
✓ Preheat the oven. Set the oven to the temperature called for in the 
recipe. Give the oven at least 10 or 15 minutes to reach the correct tem-
perature before putting the dish in.
 
✓ Use the timer. Don’t rely on your nose to tell you the food is ready. Set 
the oven timer, or use a free-standing timer. Make sure that you’re in a 
place in the house where you’ll hear the timer going off when the food is 
ready.
 
✓ Measure precisely. Think of dry ingredients in cakes, breads, rolls, and 
other baked goods like a science experiment. You have to add the flour, 
baking soda, and baking powder in the right proportions for the ingredi-
ents to react together properly. Use measuring spoons and cups to mea-
sure amounts accurately.
 
✓ Check for doneness. Poke a toothpick or knife into the center of the 
baked good to see whether it’s ready to come out. If the toothpick or 
knife comes out clean, the food is probably done. If not, check again in 
another few minutes.
Boiling
You need to know how to boil water on the stovetop for cooking grains, dried 
beans, pasta, rice, and a number of other foods. In most cases, this entails 
bringing a pot or saucepan of water to a boil over high heat, adding the food, 
and then turning the heat down to let the food simmer for a period.
When cooking some foods, such as a pot of rice, you need a lid to keep the 
steam inside the pot. You can cook other foods, such as pasta, without a lid 
to help ensure the water doesn’t boil over the sides.
 
Setting a timer is helpful so that you know when a food should be done cook-
ing. Be careful not to overcook some foods, such as pasta, which can become 
mushy if it’s left in the water too long.
Steaming
Steaming vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage by cooking 
them for a short time in a small amount of water is a great way to preserve 
their nutrients. It takes only minutes to steam most vegetables so that they’re 
tender enough to eat while retaining their color and crispness.
The microwave oven is the quickest and easiest way to steam foods. Set the 
food in a glass container and add a few tablespoons of water. Cover with a 
paper towel or plastic wrap and heat. A medium-sized baking potato needs 
six to eight minutes to cook, while a small serving of broccoli may need only 
a minute or two.

133
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
To steam foods on the stovetop, add several tablespoons of water to a pot 
and heat it to boiling. Add the food, cover with a lid, and let the food steam 
for as long as necessary. When the food is done, remove the pot from the 
stove and drain the excess water into the kitchen sink.
 
Be careful when you drain the water after steaming foods, whether you cook 
the food in a microwave oven or on the stovetop. When you remove the lid 
or cover, hold the pot or bowl away from your face so that escaping steam 
doesn’t burn you.
 
If you’re looking for kitchen gadgets specifically for steaming, consider trying 
one of the following:
 
✓ Bamboo or stainless steel steamer baskets: You set them into a pot of 
boiling water and they hold the food just above the bottom of the pan. 
The advantage in using these baskets is that they help fragile foods such 
as dumplings or tiny vegetables stay intact better and prevent nutrients 
from being leached into the cooking water.
 
✓ A free-standing, electric steamer: These small appliances are inexpen-
sive and simple to operate and clean. You can find them in most dis-
count and home stores.
Sautéing
Many vegetarian recipes begin by asking you to sauté onions, garlic, celery, 
or bell peppers before adding other ingredients. To sauté is to fry foods in a 
small amount of fat — usually vegetable oil — over high heat.
Begin by adding a few tablespoons of olive oil or another vegetable oil to a 
skillet to keep food from sticking and to help distribute the flavors. When the 
skillet is hot, add the food and stir frequently to prevent sticking. Onions are 
done when they’re translucent. Garlic may brown a bit, and celery and pep-
pers become soft when done.
Caring for cast-iron cookware
Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations 
for cleaning and seasoning cast-iron pots, pans, 
griddles, and other cookware. Instructions may 
vary from one brand to the next, depending on 
how the cookware is made. In general, though, 
you should clean cast-iron cookware by using 
nothing but a stiff, nylon brush or a sponge and 
hot water. After removing food residue, use a 
clean towel to dry your cookware. Air-drying can 
cause cookware to rust. Use a paper towel to rub 
the cooking surface with a light coat of vegetable 
oil, and then store the cookware in a cool, dry 
place. Place a piece of newspaper or a paper 
towel between pots and their lids to promote air 
circulation and prevent rust formation.

134
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Stewing
Soups, stews, and chili are examples of foods that are often left to stew or 
simmer on low heat on the stovetop for an hour or more before serving. They 
have to be stirred every so often with a long-handled spoon to keep food 
from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
A deep stew pot or stockpot is ideal for making large batches of foods like 
these, which tend to splatter if the heat is too high or the pot is too full. A 
lid — tipped to let steam escape — can help keep your stovetop and burners 
clean.
Prepping fruits and vegetables
The first step in preparing most fruits and vegetables is to wash them thor-
oughly, even if you’re using organic produce. Harmful bacteria can be pres-
ent on any produce, and you need to take precautions to be safe.
Using your hands or a soft brush, rub fruits and vegetables as you hold them 
under fast-running water for several seconds, removing all visible traces 
of dirt and debris. Soap isn’t necessary, and research has found little or no 
advantage to commercial fruit and vegetable rinses.
For fruits and vegetables such as broccoli and strawberries that have lots of 
crevices, soak them in a pan or sink full of water, swishing to help dislodge 
tiny bits of debris, and then rinse them well.
 
Even if you don’t plan to eat the peel, it’s important to wash the outsides of 
foods like watermelon, cantaloupe, and oranges before setting them on a cut-
ting board or slicing them. If you don’t, bacteria on the outside of the food 
could contaminate the cutting board’s surface and anything you set on it after-
ward. Cutting unwashed foods can also permit bacteria to get into the part of 
the food that you’re going to eat.
The right knives can make peeling, chopping, and cutting much easier. Use a 
paring knife to peel and cut apples, pears, peaches, cucumbers, bell peppers, 
and radishes. A chef’s knife is useful for chopping romaine lettuce, herbs, 
greens, and pineapple. Use a serrated knife to slice soft fruits and vegetables 
such as tomatoes and kiwi fruit. (For more information and an illustration of 
these knives, refer to Figure 8-1 and the earlier section on knives.)
 
Save time fixing meals by pre-preparing fruits and vegetables. Take a half hour 
when you return from shopping to wash and cut up produce. Store precut 
fruits and vegetables in airtight containers in the refrigerator so that they’re 
ready when you start fixing a meal.

135
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
 
Look for ways to be efficient when you prepare fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Chop several bell peppers or onions at a time, for example, and store the extra 
in 1⁄4-cup portions in airtight plastic bags in the freezer. Do the same thing 
with fruit. You can cut up peaches and strawberries, freeze them, and use 
them later to make smoothies or to serve for dessert with ice cream.
Cooking extra now for later
Batch cooking is a great way to save you time and effort in the kitchen. It 
means fixing a larger amount of whatever recipe you’re making and setting 
part of it aside for later. For little additional effort, you can have enough food 
for two or more meals in the time it takes you to prepare one.
Batch cooking works best for foods that you can store in the refrigerator 
for at least a few days or in the freezer for several weeks. For example, you 
can serve a big pot of chili for dinner one day and store the remainder in the 
refrigerator and use it for lunches for the next couple of days. Or you can 
freeze part of a large lasagna and reheat it for a quick meal another day.
Some salads even store well for days in the refrigerator. Pasta salad, bean 
salad, and other marinated vegetable salads, for example, can keep in the 
refrigerator for up to several days.
Discovering a few tricks for cooking 
with tofu and tempeh
People often talk about tofu and tempeh as if they’re bookends and go 
together like a matching pair. The fact is, they look and taste very different, 
and their functions in recipes vary, too. Another common misconception is 
that if you’re a vegetarian, you probably eat a lot of tofu. (Most nonvegetar-
ians have never heard of tempeh.) It’s not necessary to eat tofu and tempeh 
to be a full-fledged vegetarian, but you can certainly make some good-tasting 
dishes with these nutritious soy foods.
 
If you do care to experiment with tofu and tempeh, here are a few tips to make 
the most of these ingredients:
 
✓ When you use tofu as a meat substitute, you usually cut it up into cubes 
and stir-fry it (extra-firm tofu works best for this), or you marinate it and 
cook it in slabs or chunks. If it’s frozen first and then thawed, tofu devel-
ops a chewy  texture that resembles that of meat.

136
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
✓ Try using tofu to make cream soup without milk or cream. Just purée 
some soft tofu with vegetable broth and mix it into the soup.
 
✓ You can use tempeh in ways that meats are more traditionally used. 
For instance, you can grill, barbecue, bake, or broil strips or blocks of 
tempeh. You can use chunks of tempeh with vegetable pieces for shish 
kebabs or to make stews, casseroles, and other combination dishes.
Adapting Traditional Recipes
When I think about adapting traditional recipes to make them suitable for 
vegetarians, I can’t help but remember a 1970s TV show that left a lifelong 
impression on me. That show — Gilligan’s Island — was all about a group of 
castaways from a tourist boat, stranded on a deserted tropical island.
Living off the land, this group somehow managed to bake the most luscious-
looking coconut cream and banana cream pies. As a kid with a mother who 
baked, I was mesmerized — and confounded — by the idea that they could 
do this without milk, eggs, or butter.
“Well, they had coconut milk,” I thought. But no eggs or butter. And those 
pies looked so good.
The show was fiction, but the idea that plant-based ingredients can perform 
just as well in recipes as animal ingredients is the truth. You’ll be surprised 
to discover how easy it is to cook the vegetarian way, and you may be 
equally as pleased to know that you don’t have to throw away your old family 
favorites!
 
When you substitute plant-based ingredients for animal ingredients in recipes, 
anticipate that the characteristics of the finished products may be at least 
somewhat different from the qualities of foods made with animal products.
 
I encourage you to try substituting plant-based ingredients for animal prod-
ucts in your favorite nonvegetarian recipes. If you do, however, one caution is 
in order: Expect to experiment before you get it right. If you don’t use a veg-
etarian cookbook in which the recipes have already been tested, you’ll have 
to fiddle around with traditional, nonvegetarian recipes until you hit on the 
ingredient substitutions and proper amounts that work best.
In the following sections, I show you how to make many of your favorite foods 
without using any animal products whatsoever. That way, you’ll be prepared 
to adapt recipes for any kind of vegetarian diet. Of course, if you’re a vegetarian 

137
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
who eats dairy products and eggs, you may not care to work those ingredients 
out of your recipes. However, if you’re a vegan or you just want to lower your 
intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, the information is very useful.
In many cases, you can use any of several different foods as a substitute for 
an animal product in a recipe. Experiment to find the one that gives you the 
best result. Figure 8-2 shows some common substitutions.
 
When you modify a recipe, use a pencil   to note on the original recipe the 
substitutions you made and how much of each ingredient you used. When 
the product is finished, jot down suggestions for improvements or any minor 
adjustments that you want to make next time. Whenever you make an adjust-
ment, erase and update your notes on the recipe.
Replacing eggs
How many times have you wanted to bake a  batch of cookies, only to find 
that you were missing a vital ingredient, such as eggs?
 
Figure 8-2: 
Common 
vegetarian 
substitutes.
 

138
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
Bet you didn’t know that those eggs aren’t so vital. If you had known that you 
could substitute any of several other foods for the eggs in your recipes, you 
wouldn’t have had to waste a minute running to the store.
Eggs perform a number of functions in recipes, including binding ingredients, 
leavening, affecting texture, and affecting color (such as in a spongecake or 
French toast). So your choice of a substitute depends on how well it can per-
form the necessary function. In some cases, the egg’s effect in the recipe is so 
slight that you can leave it out altogether, not replace it with anything else, 
and not even notice that it’s missing.
In this section, I look at some of the foods that you can use to replace eggs in 
recipes.
Baking without eggs
In baked goods, you usually use eggs for leavening, or lightness, and to act as 
 a binder. In some recipes, eggs are beaten or whipped, incorporating air into 
the product and decreasing its density. The type of baked good determines 
whether you can leave out the egg entirely, or whether you need to replace it 
with another ingredient to perform the egg’s function   in the original recipe.
For example, in baked goods that are relatively flat and don’t need a lot of 
leavening, such as cookies and pancakes, you can often get away with leav-
ing out the egg and not replacing it. That’s particularly true when the original 
recipe calls for only one or two eggs. In recipes that call for more eggs, the 
eggs probably play a much greater role in leavening or binding, and you’ll 
find that the recipe fails if you don’t replace them.
 
If you omit the eggs in a recipe and don’t replace them, add a tablespoon or 
two of additional liquid — soymilk, fruit juice, water, and so on — for each egg 
you omit to help the product retain its original moisture content.
In baked goods that are light and have a fluffy texture, you want to replace 
eggs with an ingredient that provides some lift. Try any of the following to 
replace one whole egg in a recipe:
 
✓ Half of a ripe mashed banana. This works well in recipes in which you 
wouldn’t  mind a banana flavor, including muffins, cookies, pancakes, 
and quick breads.
 
✓ 1⁄4 cup of any kind of tofu, blended with the liquid ingredients in the 
recipe — soft or silken tofu works especially well.
 
✓ 1⁄2 teaspoon commercial vegetarian egg replacer, such as EnerG Egg 
Replacer, mixed with 2 tablespoons of water. This product is a combina-
tion of vegetable starches and works wonderfully in virtually any recipe 
that calls  for eggs. Natural foods stores usually sell this in a 1-pound box.

139
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
 
✓ 1⁄4 cup applesauce, canned pumpkin, canned squash, or puréed prunes. 
These fruit and vegetable purées may add a hint of flavor to foods. If   you 
want a lighter product, also add an extra 1⁄2 teaspoon of baking powder 
to the recipe, because using fruit purées to replace eggs can make the 
finished product somewhat denser than the original recipe.
 
✓ 1 heaping tablespoon soy flour or bean flour mixed with 1 tablespoon 
water. This combination thickens and adds  lift.
 
✓ 2 tablespoons cornstarch beaten with 2 tablespoons water. This mix 
also thickens and adds  some lift.
 
✓ 1 tablespoon finely ground flaxseeds whipped with 1⁄4 cup water. This 
blend also thickens and  adds some lift.
Holding food together without using eggs
In foods where the ingredients need to stick together, such as vegetable   and 
grain casseroles, lentil loaves, and vegetarian burger patties, you need an 
ingredient that acts as a binder. Eggs traditionally serve that function in non-
vegetarian foods like meatballs, meatloaf, hamburgers, and many casseroles, 
but you can find plenty of alternatives if you want to omit   the eggs.
 
Moist foods such as casseroles or some vegetarian loaves may not require any 
additional moisture when you’re removing or replacing eggs. In these cases, 
you’ll need to experiment to determine whether the finished dish is moist 
enough without extra liquid to compensate for the eggs you’ve left out.
 
With the following substitutions, you’ll probably find that you have to experi-
ment a bit to determine just the right amount of an ingredient to serve the 
purpose in a specific recipe. A good starting point  with most recipes is 2 or 3 
tablespoons of any of these ingredients, or a combination of them, to replace 
one whole egg. If the original recipe calls for two eggs, start with 4 to 6 table-
spoons of egg substitute.
Try any of the following to replace eggs in a recipe where eggs are used to 
bind food:
 
✓ Arrowroot starch
 
✓ Cornstarch
 
✓ Finely crushed breadcrumbs, cracker meal, or matzo meal
 
✓ Mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, or instant potato flakes
 
✓ Potato starch
 
✓ Quick-cooking rolled oats or cooked oatmeal
 
✓ Tomato   paste
 
✓ Whole-wheat, unbleached, oat, or bean flour

140
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
EnerG Egg Replacer is one of my favorite egg substitutes, and only 11⁄2 tea-
spoons of the powder mixed with 2 tablespoons of water replaces one whole 
egg in most recipes.
 
When working with dry ingredients such as arrowroot or cornstarch, some reci-
pes may work best if you mix the dry ingredients with water, vegetable broth, 
or another liquid (about 11⁄2 teaspoons of dry ingredient to 2 tablespoons of 
liquid) first, and then add the mixture to the recipe in place of the egg.
Some of the egg substitutes may affect the flavor of the finished product, too, 
so you should consider that when you decide which ingredients to use. For 
instance, if you add sweet potato to a burger patty, you may be able to taste 
it in the finished product, whereas if you mix some sweet potato into a casse-
role, its flavor may be more disguised by the other ingredients. On the other 
hand, the extra flavor that some of these  ingredients add may be a pleasant 
surprise.
 
If you’re looking for another substitution, try replacing one whole egg with 1⁄4 
cup of any kind of tofu blended with 1 tablespoon of flour. (See the nearby side-
bar “Imitating egg with tofu” for more information on tofu as an egg substitute.)
Cooking with dairy substitutes
Replacing   dairy products in recipes is incredibly easy. The dairy products 
you’re most likely to find in recipes are milk, yogurt, sour cream, butter, and 
cheese. You can easily substitute good nondairy alternatives for any of these 
products.
Getting the cow’s milk out
You can replace cow’s milk in  recipes with soymilk, rice milk, potato milk, 
nut milk, or oat milk. Just substitute any of these alternatives cup for cup for 
cow’s milk. Though oat milk has a neutral flavor without sweetness, some nut 
milks, such as almond, are too sweet for savory dishes. Use them in desserts 
and smoothies.
Plain and vanilla flavors are the most versatile varieties of soymilk because 
the mild flavors blend in with just about any recipe. You can try plain soy-
milk in savory recipes such as some main dish sauces and soups. Use vanilla 
soymilk in sweeter dishes, such as puddings and custards, and on cereal, in 
baking, and for smoothies. Carob or chocolate soymilk is also delicious in 
some smoothies and puddings.
 
Make your own version of nondairy buttermilk by adding 2 teaspoons of 
lemon juice or vinegar to 1 cup of soymilk or any other milk substitute.

141
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
Removing sour cream and yogurt
You can use soy yogurt and soy sour cream in most of the same ways that 
you use the dairy versions, including baking, making sauces and dips, and 
eating as is. Because these substitutes sometimes separate when they’re 
heated on the stove, they may or may not work in certain sauce recipes. Most 
of the time, however, you’ll find that you  have no problems substituting them 
for dairy yogurt and sour cream.
Choosing cheesy alternatives
Nondairy cheese alternatives may not melt as well as regular, full-fat dairy 
cheeses, but they generally melt better than nonfat dairy cheeses. That’s 
partly because they tend to be high in fat — albeit vegetable fat.
Experiment with cheese replacers to find the brands you like the best and 
the varieties that work best in your recipes. Most cheese substitutes do well 
as an ingredient in a mixed dish, such as a casserole, in which the cheese 
doesn’t stand alone but is mixed throughout the dish. Cheese substitutes, 
including nonfat dairy cheeses, melt better this way, too.
Imitating egg with tofu
Tofu can stand in for eggs in all sorts of reci-
pes. Usually it’s invisible as an ingredient, but 
sometimes it works as an egg imposter. Here 
are some examples:
 ✓ Use chopped firm tofu or extra-firm tofu 
in place of egg whites in recipes for egg 
salad sandwich filling. Just make your 
favorite egg salad recipe, but use chopped 
tofu instead of hard-boiled eggs. You can 
even use soy mayonnaise instead of regu-
lar mayonnaise for a vegan version. See the 
recipe for Tofu Salad in Chapter 11.
 ✓ Add chopped firm tofu to mixed green 
salads or spinach salad in place of 
chopped hard-boiled eggs. You can also 
add chopped or minced tofu to bowls of 
Chinese hot and sour soup.
 ✓ Make scrambled tofu instead of scram-
bled eggs. Natural foods stores stock tofu 
scrambler spice packets, and you may 
also see them in the produce section of 
your regular supermarket, next to the tofu. 
Vegetarian cookbooks also give recipes for 
making scrambled tofu. The recipes usually 
include turmeric to give the tofu a yellow 
color, similar to that of scrambled eggs. Try 
the recipe for Scrambled Tofu in Chapter 9. 
Use scrambled tofu to   fill pita pockets or as 
a sandwich filling  on hoagie rolls.

142
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
Make your own nondairy substitute for ricotta cheese or cottage cheese by 
mashing a block of tofu with a fork and mixing in a few teaspoons of lemon 
juice. You can use this “tofu cheese” to replace ricotta cheese or cottage 
cheese in lasagna, stuffed shells, manicotti, Danish pastries, cheese blintzes, 
and many other recipes. Nutritional yeast works well as a substitute for 
Parmesan cheese on casseroles, salads, baked potatoes, popcorn, and pasta. 
It has a savory, cheesy flavor. You’ll find it in   natural foods stores.
Making better butter choices
You can use stick-style soy margarine in recipes in place of regular margarine 
or butter, but it’s not ideal. That’s because any kind of regular, stick-style 
margarine is made by using a process that creates artery-clogging trans fat.
Instead, try replacing stick margarine and butter with soft, tub-style, trans 
fat-free margarine available in natural foods stores. Examples include Earth 
Balance and Canoleo. Read the labels and look for those containing zero 
trans fat and less than a gram of saturated fat per serving. Experiment with 
these in recipes, because the soft nature of the product may cause it to per-
form differently in different recipes.
 
You can also use liquid vegetable oil to replace butter in some recipes. Use 
about 7⁄8 cup of vegetable oil to replace 1 cup of butter. This substitution may 
not work as well in recipes for baked goods as it does in other   recipes, so 
experiment to find the amount that works best.
Using meat substitutes
Some vegetarian dishes are originals — they’ve been meatless from the start, 
and  they don’t cry out for a meat-like ingredient. Examples include falafel 
(deep-fried Middle Eastern chickpea balls), spinach pie, ratatouille (a spicy 
vegetable dish), and pasta primavera.
Other dishes were created with a meat-like ingredient in mind. Without meat — or 
a suitable substitute — they lack something. Examples include burgers (a burger 
without the burger is just a bun), sloppy Joes, and recipes that call for chunks of 
meat, such as stews and stir-fries.
Some meat products are stand-alone traditions — hot dogs, sa usage, cold 
cuts, and bacon, for instance. Believe it or not, you can find some very good 
imposters to replace even these stand-alones. Whatever the   recipe, you have 
lots of choices when it comes to replacing the meat. Consider the following, 
which I’ve generally listed in order of their popularity:
 
✓ Meatless strips, nuggets and patties: Soy- and vegetable-based substi-
tutes that resemble chicken and beef strips, chicken nuggets, burger and 
chicken patties, and similar products are sold in the refrigerator and 

143
 Chapter 8: Cooking Tools and Techniques
freezer cases in supermarkets and natural foods stores. Use them in stir-
fry recipes, over rice, in casseroles, and in other creative ways.
 
✓ Tofu: Tofu is a smooth, creamy food that has very little flavor or odor. It 
picks  up the flavor of whatever it’s cooked with. It can be seasoned with 
herbs, spices, and sauces and can be baked, fried, or sautéed and used 
like meat as a main dish or as an ingredient in other dishes, such as the 
stir-fry recipe I include in Part III.
 
✓ Tempeh: Tempeh can be crumbled and used to make such foods as 
tempeh sloppy Joes, tempeh mock chicken salad, and tempeh chili.
 
✓ Textured vegetable protein (TVP): This product can replace  the ground 
meat in taco and burrito fillings, sloppy Joe filling, and spaghetti sauce. 
If you toss a handful into a pot of chili, people won’t likely be able to 
tell the difference between the TVP and ground meat. You can find dry 
TVP in natural foods stores and through mail order catalogs, though it’s 
largely being replaced by newer products, such as the meatless ground 
“beef” products sold in the refrigerator and freezer cases in supermar-
kets and natural foods stores.
 
✓ Bulgur wheat: Bulgur wheat has a nutty flavor, and you can use it in some 
of the same ways that TVP is used. For example, you can toss a handful of 
bulgur wheat into a pot of chili and get much the same effect as you would 
if you used TVP. It absorbs the liquid in whatever it’s cooked with, and it 
has the appearance of ground meat and a   chewy texture.
Factoring in other replacements 
for animal ingredients
Don’t let any animal ingredient stand in your way of enjoying a favorite 
recipe.
Replace beef and chicken broths in soup with vegetable broth, available in 
a variety of flavors and forms. For convenience and flavor, brands that are 
packaged in aseptic, shelf-stable boxes and sold in many supermarkets and 
natural foods stores work well. Plain vegetable broth works well in most soup 
recipes, but consider tomato and red pepper, ginger carrot, and other varia-
tions, too. You can also use bouillon cubes, powders, and canned vegetable 
broths.
And if you think being vegetarian means an end to molded gelatin salads, 
consider this: Vegetarian  sources of plain and fruit-flavored gelatin are avail-
able. They’re made from sea vegetables and are sold in natural foods stores. 
Agar is one form, and it’s made from red algae. You can use these products in 
the same ways that nonvegetarian gelatin is used.

144
Part II: Planning and Preparing Your Vegetarian Kitchen 
 
If you use vegetarian gelatin in recipes in which regular gelatin is usually lique-
fied and then added to cold ingredients, you may need to change the process 
a bit. Vegetarian gelatin may begin to set immediately, so you need to add the 
rest of the recipe’s ingredients right away. If a recipe doesn’t turn out well 
when you use the original preparation method, try blending the vegetarian 
gelatin into cold liquid first, and then bringing the liquid to a boil.
Selecting Vegetarian Cookbooks
Though you can modify traditional nonvegetarian recipes to remove the 
animal ingredients, it can help to have a few vegetarian cookbooks on hand 
as well.
Vegetarian cookbooks are helpful for a couple of reasons. They provide 
explicit instructions for making recipes that may be new to you. You can 
even use a recipe as a starting point and modify it to make the dish uniquely 
your own.
And some people like to peruse cookbooks just for the ideas they can inspire. 
If you find yourself in a rut, thumbing through a favorite cookbook may 
remind you of something you haven’t made in a while.
Dozens and dozens of excellent vegetarian cookbooks are available, ranging 
from vegan to lacto ovo vegetarian and including cuisines from many differ-
ent cultures. I’m not going to attempt to list them here. However, you should 
realize that it’s common to find one or two favorite cookbooks that you 
return to over and over again. Other cookbooks may contain only one or two 
recipes that you make now and then.
 
As you shop for vegetarian cookbooks, be especially attuned to the complex-
ity of the recipes and the number and type of ingredients used. In my experi-
ence, the most practical cookbooks for home cooks are those with simple 
recipes requiring only basic cooking skills and equipment. Ingredient lists 
should be short and be relatively free of exotic ingredients that you aren’t 
likely to use often or that may be expensive or hard to find.
In fact, I’m a strong advocate of learning to cook using no recipes at all. After 
you develop confidence in cooking, you should be able to put together foods 
that taste good — like the ingredients in a veggie burrito or a pot of vegetar-
ian chili — without the need to measure. That’s freedom in cooking!
 
You do have to use precise measurements in baking, which requires that cer-
tain ingredients be present in exact proportions. For most other simple recipes, 
though — fruit salad, a batch of hummus, or veggie lasagna, for instance — you 
can use a little more or less of this or that and everything will turn out just fine.

more than basic cooking skills.
Most of these recipes can be adapted to suit your own

ily modified to add or subtract animal ingredients (like 
butter, milk, and eggs) using information in Chapter 8 and 
throughout the book.
As you test these recipes, use a pencil to jot notes in the 
margins about what you liked, what you didn’t like, and 
ideas for changes you’d like to try the next time you fix 
each recipe. If you make a modification, write a note in the 
book to help you remember what you changed and how 
much of the ingredient you added or took away.
Enjoy!

A
lthough breakfast for many people is a bagel 
or glass of juice as they run out the door, 
eating a nutritious meal in the morning doesn’t 
take a lot of planning or preparation. That’s fortu-
nate, because breakfast is important. It gives you 
an energy lift as you start your day and helps you 
stay alert and perform your best.
Some good vegetarian and fuss-free options include a bowl of dry cereal 
with milk, a piece of fruit, a cup of yogurt, or toast and jam. When you do 
have more time to prepare a meal in the morning, making something a little 
more substantial can be fun. You can make most breakfast classics, including 
breakfast breads and egg dishes, in a variety of ways to include as many or as 
few animal ingredients as you care to eat.
I include several examples in this chapter to get you started.
Getting Off to a Smoothie Start
Unlike their cousin the milkshake, smoothies made with fresh fruit and either 
nonfat milk or nondairy alternatives are low in calories and saturated fat 
and contain no cholesterol. They take only minutes to make in a blender and 
make a refreshing and convenient take-and-go breakfast alternative. I include 
two examples here — use your imagination to create other variations.

Vegans can replace frozen yogurt with nondairy alternatives available in natu-
ral foods stores. Ice cubes, crushed in blending, improve the mouth feel or 
texture of smoothies, making them frostier.
 
Very Berry Smoothie
Rich purple jewel tones dotted with tiny black flecks create a light, attractive refresh-
ment. Serve this smoothie in a clear glass to show off the pretty colors. This one’s a 
crowd-pleaser, so if you have company, plan to multiply the recipe.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: One large (16-ounce) serving or two smaller servings
1 cup vanilla soymilk
1⁄2 ripe banana
1 cup frozen mixed berries (strawberries, 
blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries)
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
 1 Place all the ingredients in a blender.
 2 Blend on high speed for about 1 minute or until smooth, stopping every 15 seconds to 
scrape the sides of the blender with a spatula and to push the solid ingredients down to 
the bottom of the blender.
 3 Pour into a tall (16-ounce) tumbler or two smaller (8-ounce) glasses and serve immedi-
ately with an iced tea spoon and a straw.

Orange Juice Smoothie
This delicious drink is reminiscent of the orange Creamsicles some of us enjoyed in 
summers past. Add a sprig of fresh mint as a garnish.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: Two 12-ounce servings
1 cup orange juice
2 cups frozen nonfat vanilla yogurt
1⁄2 cup fresh orange sections (remove every bit 
of peel and white membrane — 
see Figure 9-1 for instructions)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
5 or 6 ice cubes
 1 Place all the ingredients in a blender.
 2 Blend on high speed for about 1 minute or until smooth, stopping every 15 seconds to 
scrape the sides of the blender with a spatula and to push the solid ingredients down to 
the bottom of the blender. Thin the mixture as needed with a little more orange juice 
until it reaches the desired consistency.
 3 Pour into two tall (16-ounce) tumblers and serve immediately with iced tea spoons and 
straws.
Vary It! The fresh orange tastes great in this recipe, but you can leave it out if it’s too 
much work or if you happen to be out of oranges.

Using Tofu to Take the Place of Eggs
A big surprise to many people who are new to vegetarianism is that tofu 
works wonderfully as a stand-in for eggs in certain recipes. Although it can’t 
take the place of an egg fried sunny side up, tofu can hold its own as an egg 
substitute in many other ways.
You can mix tofu with spices and fry it in a skillet with sliced onions and bell 
peppers to make a tasty variation of traditional scrambled eggs. With toast 
and hash browns, it makes a hearty and healthful breakfast alternative. Tofu 
also works wonderfully as an egg substitute in quiche.
 
Scrambled Tofu
Tofu picks up the flavors with which it’s cooked, so this dish tastes very much like its 
egg counterpart — a savory blend of onions, bell peppers, and spices. Turmeric gives 
the dish its yellow hue and helps the tofu stand in for eggs. Serve this dish hot with 
Seasoned Home Fries (see Chapter 11), whole-grain toast, and juice. You can also serve 
it hot or cold as a sandwich filling in a pita pocket or on a kaiser roll.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 cups bell pepper strips (green, red, yellow, 
or mixed)
Two 12-ounce bricks of firm tofu
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon soy sauce
Salt to taste
 1 Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Over medium heat, cook the onion, garlic, and bell pep-
pers, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the peppers are soft — 
about 8 minutes.
 2 Crumble the tofu into the onion-bell peppers mixture. Add the black pepper, turmeric, 
and soy sauce, and mix everything together with a wooden spoon or spatula. Heat thor-
oughly for about 2 minutes, mixing and scrambling the ingredients continuously.

Mushroom Quiche with 
 
Caramelized Onions
The base of this quiche is tofu, and the texture and consistency are similar to — but not 
exactly like — those of a traditional quiche made with eggs. Popular among many vege-
tarians as a hot breakfast item, this dish may take some getting used to for those accus-
tomed to the flavor and texture of egg-based quiche. The dish is delicious served with 
home fried potatoes (see the recipe for Seasoned Home Fries in Chapter 11) or a muffin 
and a seasonal fresh fruit salad. You might even add a side of soy-based link sausages 
or sausage patties. For brunch or lunch, consider serving this quiche with potatoes and 
steamed greens, such as kale or spinach. Cheese-eaters may want to mix in a handful of 
low-fat shredded cheddar cheese in Step 4.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 60 to 70 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Two 12-ounce bricks of firm tofu
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
1⁄2 cup canned mushrooms, drained, or 2 cups 
sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons flour
2 tablespoons lemon juice
9-inch pie shell, unbaked (if you buy yours from 
a store, read the nutrient facts label and make 
sure the pie shell is lard- and trans fat-free)
Paprika
 1 Slice the tofu and place it between two clean towels. Set a heavy cutting board or simi-
lar weight on top and press the tofu for 30 minutes.
 2 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and 
slowly cook over medium heat until the onion is caramel-colored, stirring often. This 
will take 30 to 40 minutes. If you’re using fresh mushrooms, sauté them with the onion.
 3 In a medium mixing bowl, combine the tofu, soy sauce, dry mustard, salt, black pepper, garlic, 
flour, and lemon juice. Mash with a pastry blender or fork, and mix the ingredients well.
 4 Add the onion and mushrooms to the tofu mixture. Stir until the ingredients are well blended.
 5 Pour the mixture into the unbaked pie shell and spread the filling evenly. Sprinkle the 
top lightly with paprika.
 6 Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned and the quiche is set and 
looks firm in the middle when you jiggle the pan. Serve immediately.

Putting a Vegetarian Spin 
on Breakfast Favorites
Pancakes, French toast, hot cereal, fresh cinnamon rolls, and other break-
fast staples have always been vegetarian, but you can give these everyday 
foods a twist that most nonvegetarians don’t. Health-conscious vegetarians 
often prefer to use whole grains, add such extras as dried fruit and nuts, and 
substitute nondairy alternatives for fatty dairy products to cut down on satu-
rated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein. Taste for yourself.
 
Mom’s Healthy Pancakes
These pancakes are fluffy yet hearty. As kids, my siblings and I simply called them “Healthies,” 
and we’d beg my mother to make a batch on weekend mornings. Make these pancakes as 
soon as possible after mixing the batter, because the leavening action of the baking powder 
begins as soon as it mixes with the liquid ingredients. Batter left too long will begin to lose its 
leavening power and can result in flat, dense pancakes. Leftover pancakes keep well in the 
refrigerator or freezer, and you can reheat them in the microwave oven.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (about twelve 5-inch pancakes)
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄2 cup white flour
1⁄3 cup wheat germ
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
13⁄4 cups skim milk or soymilk
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
2 egg whites, beaten stiff (see note)
 1 Measure the dry ingredients into a medium-sized bowl.
 2 Add the milk or soymilk, oil, and whole egg, and stir well using a whisk. Break up any 
remaining chunks of flour by using the back of a spoon.
 3 Fold in the beaten egg whites with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. The batter will be 
thick but light and somewhat foamy.
 4 Pour the batter by 1⁄3-cup measures onto a hot, oiled skillet. When the pancakes are 
bubbly all over and the edges are browned, turn them over and cook for about 30 sec-
onds, or until the undersides are browned. Serve immediately.

153
 Chapter 9: Beyond Cereal and Toast: Whipping Up Breakfast Basics
Tip: Egg whites are beaten stiff when they’ve thickened enough to form a peak when you 
pull the beaters out of the bowl. If you keep beating egg whites past this point, they can col-
lapse and become thin again. The key is to stop beating when you notice that the whites 
are forming soft peaks that can stand up on their own.

Fruited Oatmeal
This recipe is very simple, but the tartness of the Granny Smith apples makes it special. 
Expect an oatmeal-like texture with a bit of crunch from the nuts and some sweetness 
added by the apples and brown sugar. You can eat this oatmeal as is, but it’s delicious 
served with vanilla soymilk on top.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: Two 1-cup servings
13⁄4 cup water
1 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
1⁄2 Granny Smith apple, peeled and finely diced
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts or pecans
1 teaspoon cinnamon, plus extra for dusting
2 tablespoons brown sugar
 1 Bring the water to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan.
 2 Add the oats and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
 3 Add the apple, nuts, and cinnamon, and cook on low heat for an additional 2 to 3 min-
utes, or until heated through. The mixture will be thick and creamy.
 4 Remove from the heat and ladle into serving bowls. Top each serving with a dusting of 
cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.
Vary It! For softer apples, add the apples with the water in Step 1. Then add the oats and 
the remaining ingredients and cook as directed.

Favorite Cinnamon Rolls
These rolls are soft, chewy, and sweet and will fill your home with the welcoming fra-
grance of cinnamon and freshly baked bread. Egg whites replace whole eggs in this ver-
sion to reduce saturated fat and cholesterol without sacrificing flavor.
Preparation time: 45 minutes, plus an hour and 45 minutes for dough to rise
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 24 rolls
Rolls:
1 cup whole-wheat flour
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 package (1⁄4 ounce) active dry yeast
1 cup plain soymilk or milk
3⁄4 cup sugar
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
4 egg whites
1⁄4 cup trans fat-free margarine
2 teaspoons cinnamon
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons soymilk or milk
 1 In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour, 1 cup of the all-purpose flour, 
and the yeast. Set aside.
 2 Combine the soymilk, 1⁄4 cup of the sugar, the oil, and the salt in a saucepan and heat on 
low until warm (no more than 110 degrees, or just warm to the touch). Stir to blend, and 
then add to the flour and yeast mixture. Whisk in the egg whites.
 3 Beat on high speed for about 4 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides.
 4 Stir in enough (most) of the remaining all-purpose flour to make a stiff dough.
 5 Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and set it on a floured surface. Knead the 
dough for about 10 minutes, adding more flour by the tablespoon as needed to prevent 
sticking. When you’re finished kneading, the dough should be smooth and elastic.
 6 Set the dough in an oiled bowl, and then turn it to oil the top of the dough ball. Cover with a 
towel or waxed paper and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size — about 1 hour.
 7 After the dough has doubled, punch it down and divide it into two pieces. Roll each 
piece of dough into a rectangle about 1⁄4 inch thick.
 8 Melt the margarine and brush it onto each rectangle of dough. In a small cup, mix the 
cinnamon and the remaining 1⁄2 cup of sugar, and sprinkle the mixture evenly over both 
rectangles of dough.

155
 Chapter 9: Beyond Cereal and Toast: Whipping Up Breakfast Basics
 9 Roll up the rectangles, starting at the widest ends. Pinch the ends shut with your fingers 
and press the seams into the dough (see Figure 9-2).
 10 Cut the rolls into 1-inch pieces, and place the pieces cut side down in two oiled baking 
dishes or 9-inch round nonstick pans. Cover each dish with a towel or waxed paper, and 
let the rolls rise in a warm place until doubled in size — about 45 minutes. Preheat the 
oven to 375 degrees.
 11 Bake for 20 minutes, or until the rolls are slightly browned. Don’t overcook.
 12 While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze by mixing the confectioner’s sugar, vanilla, 
and 1 tablespoon of the soymilk. Add additional soymilk in increments of 1 teaspoon 
until the glaze is thick but pourable. Drizzle the glaze over the warm rolls and serve.
Vary It! Add 1⁄2 cup chopped walnuts, raisins, or currants to the filling in Step 8.

Vegan French Toast
Bananas and soymilk take the place of eggs in this version of French toast. Don’t expect 
this to look or taste exactly like traditional French toast, but it’s an interesting adapta-
tion that’s flavorful and nutritious.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 large ripe bananas
1 cup plain or vanilla soymilk
1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (go ahead and 
use it even if you’re using vanilla soymilk)
1 or 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to grease 
the skillet
8 slices multigrain or whole-wheat bread
Powdered sugar
Maple syrup
Sliced kiwi fruit and strawberry halves for 
garnish (optional)
 1 In a blender or food processor, purée the bananas, soymilk, nutmeg, and vanilla. Pour 
the mixture into a shallow pan such as a pie tin, cake pan, or 8-x-8-inch baking pan.
 2 Generously oil a griddle and heat it until a drop of water spatters when flicked onto 
the pan.
 3 Dip both sides of each slice of bread into the soymilk mixture, and transfer each slice to 
the griddle. The first side will take about 2 minutes to brown. Turn gently and carefully, 
because the bread tends to stick to the griddle. Cook the second side for about 3 
minutes.
 4 Carefully remove the French toast from the griddle and turn it so that the brown side is 
face up. Dust each slice with powdered sugar, and serve with a pitcher of warm maple 
syrup. Garnish with thin slices of kiwi fruit and strawberry halves (if desired).

Starting Your Day the Miso Way
Miso is a fermented soy condiment — a rich, salty, savory paste — that’s a 
key ingredient in many East Asian dishes, including soups, sauces, gravies, 
and salad dressings. You can find it in natural foods stores and Asian markets. 
Although you may not think of using miso at breakfast time, it’s a common 
sight on breakfast tables in Japan, where miso soup is the traditional way to 
start the day. I provide more information about miso in Chapter 6.
 
Morning Miso Soup
This simple recipe for miso soup takes only minutes to make — quick enough for even 
the most harried of mornings. A big mugful is comforting at breakfast, but you can eat 
this soup as a snack or as part of a meal anytime.
Preparation time: Less than 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 cups vegetable broth
2 cups hot water
4 tablespoons miso
1 teaspoon fresh ginger root, grated (optional)
1⁄2 cup thinly sliced mushrooms (see Figure 9-3)
1⁄2 cup diced firm tofu
3 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens
 1 Pour the vegetable broth and 1 cup of the hot water into a medium saucepan.
 2 In a bowl, dissolve the miso in the remaining 1 cup of hot water. Mix well, and then add 
to the contents of the saucepan.
 3 Add the ginger root (if desired) and mushrooms and heat until simmering — about 5 
minutes.
 4 Remove from the heat and stir in the tofu and scallion greens. Serve in a mug or bowl.

Serving Simple Starters
In This Chapter
▶ Enjoying delicious dips and spreads
▶ Including flavors from around the world
▶ Fixing finger foods
A
ppetizers are versatile. You can eat dips and 
spreads now or as sandwich fillings tomor-
row. You can pack leftover hors d’oeuvres in a bag 
lunch, or reheat them and serve them with a salad 
for a quick lunch.
You can also assemble several appetizers on a 
platter for a sophisticated — and often lighter — 
alternative to an entrée for dinner. The samples I 
include in this chapter are tasty, easy to make, and good for you, too.
Making Dips and Spreads
Recipes in this section borrow flavors from around the world. The first, 
hummus, is perhaps the most popular vegetarian dip. You’ll find it on the 
menu at every Middle Eastern restaurant, and most vegetarian restaurants 
as well. Many variations exist, but the basic dip is made with garbanzo beans 
and olive oil, and it’s very easy to make.
 
Beans, a popular ingredient in many cultures, are a staple in most vegetarian 
diets. They make great dips because you can puree them to a creamy texture 
and flavor them with a variety of ingredients. For more information about 
beans as ingredients in vegetarian cuisine, see Chapter 6.
The other recipes in this section are also tasty and versatile. From the cool-
ing cucumber and dill yogurt dip and guacamole to zippy mango salsa and 
flavorful roasted garlic spread, these dips and spreads have wide appeal 
among vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Use them to add color, flavor, and 
pleasing texture to your meals.

Basic Hummus with 
 
Toasted Pita Points
Hummus is a smooth, creamy, garlicky dip or spread that’s made primarily from gar-
banzo beans, or chickpeas. This healthful dish is popular throughout the Middle East 
and is typically served in a shallow bowl, drizzled with a few teaspoons of olive oil 
and fresh lemon juice, with warm wedges of pita bread for dipping. You can also 
serve hummus as a dip for raw vegetables and as a pita pocket filling.
Preparation/cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: Eight 1⁄4-cup servings
2 pieces of whole-wheat pita bread, each cut 
into 12 wedges
About 1 tablespoon olive oil for brushing onto 
pita wedges
One 15-ounce can garbanzo beans, rinsed 
(about 13⁄4 cups)
1⁄4 cup water
1 large clove garlic, minced
1⁄4 cup tahini
1⁄4 cup lemon juice
1⁄4 teaspoon cumin
2 teaspoons olive oil
1⁄2 fresh lemon
Paprika
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush olive oil onto the pita wedges using a pastry 
brush. Arrange them on a baking sheet and place into the oven.
 2 While the pita wedges are browning in the oven, place the garbanzo beans, water, 
garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and cumin in a blender or food processor and process until 
smooth and creamy. Scoop into a shallow bowl.
 3 Drizzle the olive oil over the hummus, followed by a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a 
dusting of paprika.
 4 Remove the pita wedges from the oven after about 15 minutes, or when the bread is 
lightly browned and toasted. (If you prefer warm and chewy pita wedges, start checking 
the bread after 7 to 10 minutes and remove it sooner.) Arrange the pita wedges around 
the bowl of hummus for dipping, or serve separately in a small basket or bowl.
Vary It! Add 1 roasted red bell pepper or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill in Step 1. 
Increase garlic by 1 or 2 cloves for a greater garlicky punch.

Spicy Black Bean Dip
This dip has a mild flavor and a smooth, creamy texture. With the salsa added, it works 
well as a dip for tortilla chips and for raw vegetable pieces such as broccoli and cauli-
flower florets, baby carrot sticks, and bell pepper strips. Depending on what you have 
on hand, you can garnish the dip with parsley sprigs, minced green onions or tomatoes, 
grated cheddar or Jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream or mashed avocado, or any com-
bination of these ingredients. If the dip sets for about 30 minutes, it thickens enough to 
be used as a filling for burritos or tacos. If you plan to use this as a filling or spread, the 
salsa is optional.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: Eight 1⁄4-cup servings
One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed
1⁄2 cup warm water
1⁄2 small onion, minced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1⁄4 cup mild salsa (optional)
 1 Combine the beans and water in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 
minutes, or until the beans are hot.
 2 Remove from the heat and mash the beans well with a potato masher or fork. Add the 
onion and garlic and stir well.
 3 Return the mixture to the stovetop and heat on low for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
 4 Stir in the salsa (if desired) and heat until the beans are hot and bubbly. Add more 
water by the tablespoon, if necessary, until the dip reaches the desired consistency.
 5 Remove from the heat and serve.
Vary It! In this recipe, the onions remain crunchy. If you prefer the onions cooked, sauté them 
for a few minutes in a teaspoon of olive oil before adding them to the beans in Step 2.

Tahini
Tahini is a paste made from ground sesame 
seeds. It has a mild sesame flavor and is used 
as an ingredient in some dips and salad dress-
ings. You can find tahini at natural foods stores, 
Middle Eastern and specialty stores, and some 
supermarkets. It’s often sold in a can with a 
plastic lid or in a jar, like natural peanut butter, 
with a layer of oil floating on top. Stir in the oil 
before scooping out the tahini.
 
Guacamole
Enjoy this rich, mildly flavored dip with tortilla chips, spread a layer on a sandwich, or 
fold some into a burrito. Avocado has a buttery consistency whether you mix the dip by 
hand or make it smooth in a blender or food processor. Note that you should use this 
recipe soon after preparation; the dip will turn dark on the surface. You can delay the 
discoloration by covering the surface of the dip with plastic wrap and keeping it chilled.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: Four 1⁄4-cup servings
1 medium avocado
1⁄4 cup finely diced sweet onion (such as 
Vidalia)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons salsa (optional)
 1 Cut the avocado in half, remove the seed and peel, and place the meat in a small bowl 
(see Figure 10-1 for peeling and seeding instructions). Mash the avocado with a potato 
masher or fork until it’s fairly smooth.
 2 Add the remaining ingredients and mix well by hand. For a much smoother result, you 
can puree everything in a blender or food processor. If you do so, however, stir in the 
salsa by hand after processing.

Mango Salsa
You may be in the habit of buying bottled salsa from the store, but salsa is quick, easy, 
and inexpensive to make at home, and you can vary the flavors depending on the ingre-
dients you have on hand. Try this version, made with fresh mango. Serve with black

Cucumber and Dill Yogurt Dip
You serve this dip cold with whole-grain crackers, toasted pita bread points, or fresh 
vegetable sticks. It’s similar to Greek tzatziki sauce or Indian raita — both yogurt-based 
dips — so it makes a good accompaniment to spinach pie (Greek spanakopita) and 
spicy Indian entrees. You can also use it to top a bean burrito!
Preparation time: 10 minutes (plus chilling time)
Yield: Six 1⁄4-cup servings
1⁄2 medium cucumber, peeled and finely 
chopped
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped
One 8-ounce carton of nonfat, plain yogurt
 1 Peel the cucumber, and then chop it into fine pieces (see Figure 10-2). Mince the garlic 
and chop the fresh dill.
 2 Scoop the yogurt into a small bowl. Add the cucumbers, garlic, and dill, and stir to mix 
the ingredients.
 3 Cover and chill for at least an hour before serving.
Vary It! Get creative. Instead of dill, try using fresh cilantro and a dash of cumin, or omit 
the garlic and substitute fresh mint for dill. Adding salt and pepper to taste or a squeeze of 
fresh lemon are also good options.

Roasted Garlic Spread
This dish is as simple as can be to make, and it makes the house smell so good. Pop a 
garlic bulb into the oven for a nutritious spread on French bread rounds or homemade 
rolls.
Preparation time: 1 minute
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
1 large garlic bulb
2 teaspoons olive oil
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Pull the outer, loose layers of tissue off the garlic bulb, leaving enough so that the 
cloves remain intact.
 3 With a sharp knife, cut off the top of the bulb (about 1⁄4 inch of the top — see Figure 
10-3) to expose the tops of the cloves inside. Drizzle the tops of the cloves with the 
olive oil.
 4 Wrap the bulb loosely in aluminum foil, seal the foil completely, and place in the hot 
oven.
 5 Bake for about 1 hour, or until the cloves are soft. Remove from the oven.
 6 Place the garlic bulb on a small serving dish. Lift the cloves out of the bulb with a 
dinner knife and smear the softened garlic on bread. If the cloves are hard to spread, 
squeeze the bulb to loosen them.

Creating Other Easy Appetizers
Bite-sized portions of many foods — pizza, sandwiches, and spinach pie, for 
example — lend themselves to serving as hors d’oeuvres or simple starters 
before a meal. Following are three more examples of meatless appetizers with 
widespread appeal.

Cheesy Pesto French Bread Rounds
Fill your kitchen with the intoxicating aroma of basil and warm bread. Serve these as an 
appetizer or accompanied by a green salad or bowl of soup for a light meal.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (3 rounds each)
1 French baguette sliced into eighteen 1⁄4-inch-
thick rounds (about 2 inches in diameter)
3⁄4 cup pesto (use the pesto recipe from 
Pesto Pasta Primavera in Chapter 12, or use 
ready-made pesto)
1 heaping cup grated, part-skim mozzarella 
cheese
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray or rub a cookie sheet or pizza pan with vegeta-
ble oil. Alternatively, line the cookie sheet with foil, and then rub the foil with a table-
spoon of olive oil to keep cheese from baking onto the cookie sheet.
 2 Spread each round with 2 teaspoons of pesto.
 3 Top each round with about 1 tablespoon of grated cheese.
  4 Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until cheese is lightly browned and bubbly. 
Remove from the cooking sheet and serve immediately.
Vary It! Add 1 teaspoon of black olive tapenade or sun-dried tomatoes to tops of rounds.

Grilled Vegetable Quesadilla
Cut quesadilla into wedges and serve as an appetizer with Mango Salsa (see the recipe 
earlier in this chapter). These also make a quick meal that kids love. Serve half of a 
large quesadilla with a small green salad for a light lunch or supper.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 large quesadilla (serves four as an appetizer or two as a light meal)
1⁄2 cup chopped broccoli florets
1⁄4 cup grated carrots
1⁄4 cup chopped onion
1⁄2 cup chopped zucchini squash
1⁄4 cup red or yellow bell peppers, seeded and 
chopped
Salt and pepper to taste (optional)
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 large whole-wheat flour tortillas
3⁄4 cup grated, reduced-fat Jack cheese or 
cheddar and Jack cheese mixture
Salsa; plain, nonfat yogurt; or reduced-fat sour 
cream and sliced black olives for garnish 
(optional)
 1 Prepare broccoli, carrots, onions, zucchini, and bell peppers and place them into a 
glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of water, cover, and heat in a microwave oven for 3 to 5 
minutes, until tender. Drain and set aside. Salt and pepper to taste (if desired).
 2 Smear 2 tablespoons of olive oil on the bottom of a large skillet. Place a flour tortilla 
into the skillet.
  3 Sprinkle half the cheese evenly on top of the flour tortilla, and then distribute steamed 
vegetables evenly on top of the cheese. Top the vegetables with the remaining cheese.
  4 Top with second flour tortilla. Brush the top of the second tortilla with remaining 
olive oil.
  5 Cook on medium heat. After several minutes, lift the edge of the bottom quesadilla with 
a spatula to check for doneness. When the bottom tortilla appears lightly browned and 
the cheese is melted (about 5 to 7 minutes), carefully turn the quesadilla over and cook 
for an additional 2 or 3 minutes, until the other side is lightly browned.
  6 Remove from the heat and cut into wedges for serving. Top with a scoop of salsa, a 
dollop of plain, nonfat yogurt or reduced-fat sour cream, and sliced black olives. 
Vary It! Substitute 3⁄4 cup cooked, drained, chopped spinach for the vegetables to make a 
spinach quesadilla.

Stuffed Mushrooms
This appetizer goes well with Cheesy Pesto French Bread Rounds (see the recipe earlier 
in this chapter) and a selection of olives. A mini-chopper or small food processor can 
make preparation easier and faster.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (3 mushrooms each)
18 medium white mushrooms (about 1 pound)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, minced (about 1⁄2 cup)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1⁄2 cup breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
1⁄4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Fresh rosemary or basil sprigs for garnish
 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
 2 Rinse and pat the mushrooms to dry them. Trim off the bottoms of stems. Separate the 
stems from the mushroom caps to create a small crater in the bottom of each cap. Chop 
the stems finely and set aside.
  3 In a medium skillet, add olive oil and sauté the mushroom stems, onions, and garlic on 
medium heat until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the breadcrumbs, 
oregano, parsley, salt and pepper, and cheese.
  4 Distribute the filling equally among mushroom caps, pressing lightly to set filling into 
each cap.
  5 Place mushroom caps on an oiled baking sheet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the 
mushrooms are hot. Remove from the baking sheet and place on a serving dish. Garnish 
with fresh rosemary or basil sprigs.
Vary It! Experiment with additions to filling mixture. Add a few tablespoons of chopped 
walnuts or pecans, basil, or sundried tomato pesto.

Enjoying Easy Soups, 
Salads, and Sides
In This Chapter
▶ Making savory soups with beans and lentils
▶ Using salads as light meals, sides, and snacks
▶ Rounding out meals with side dishes
S
oups, salads, and sides complete a meal by 
complementing the entrée and by adding 
flavor, texture, and color to the plate. They’re 
versatile, too. Alone, a hearty bowl of soup, gener-
ous salad, or side — or any combination of two 
or more — can make the perfect lunch or dinner. 
Soup is even on the menu in Chapter 9 — for 
breakfast!
I love the convenience of soups, salads, and sides, so I keep plenty of the 
ingredients in my pantry and refrigerator. Use them to add variety to meals 
and as quick, light meals and snacks by themselves.
Serving Soups for All Seasons
Beans and lentils are the foundations of many filling, nutritious vegetarian 
soups. High in protein and fiber, they give soups a stick-to-your ribs quality 
that makes them well suited for the main course at meals. Use canned beans 
or dried, or try your hand at using a pressure cooker to soften dried beans 
more quickly (I include more information about pressure cookers in Chapter 
8). Recipes in this section include traditional lentil soup; a classic, cold vege-
table soup (gazpacho); and chili with a twist, made with raisins and cashews.

Lentil Soup
This soup has a rich, savory flavor, and the lentils cook quickly because of their small 
size and flat shape. If you have leftover cooked spinach, stir it into this soup to add 
color and a healthful nutrient boost.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: About 1 hour
Yield: 8 servings
11⁄4 cups dried lentils (1⁄2 pound)
5 cups water
1 medium onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
One 16-ounce can stewed or crushed 
tomatoes
1 bay leaf
 1 Rinse the lentils in a colander or strainer.
 2 Combine the lentils, water, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a large saucepan. 
Cover and cook on medium-high heat until boiling — about 14 minutes.
 3 Stir in the tomatoes and bay leaf.
 4 Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 45 minutes, or until the lentils are 
tender.
Vary It! In place of regular crushed tomatoes, try fire-roasted crushed tomatoes if you can 
find them at your grocery store.

Classic Gazpacho
This spicy Spanish soup is served cold. Many variations exist, from very smooth to 
chunky. Adjust the heat according to your taste by adding more or less cayenne pepper 
and hot pepper sauce (this version is relatively mild). The soup’s color and taste may 
vary slightly, depending on the tomatoes you use.
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus time for bread to marinate
Yield: 5 servings
1 slice stale white bread
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
1⁄2 cup finely chopped onion
1 green bell pepper, chopped fine (see 
Figure 11-1)
1 cucumber, peeled and sliced
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
Juice of 1 fresh lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
 1 Break the bread into small pieces and place it in a small cup or bowl. Pour the vinegar 
and oil on top and add the garlic. Mash with a fork, and then set aside for at least 30 
minutes.
 2 Place the bread mixture in a blender and add 1 cup of the liquid from the canned toma-
toes, plus the onion, green bell pepper, and cucumber (save a few tablespoons of onion 
and green bell pepper for garnish). Blend at low speed for 1 minute.
 3 Add the remaining tomatoes and juice, cayenne pepper, hot pepper sauce, and lemon 
juice. Give the mixture a whirl in the blender to break up the whole tomatoes. Chill.
 4 Garnish with a sprinkling of chopped onions, green bell peppers, or croutons and serve.

Cashew Chili
Raisins add a touch of sweetness to this chili, and cashews add a rich, nutty flavor. 
Serve it over steamed rice with cornbread and a green salad on the side. This chili is 
thick, and it thickens considerably more if left overnight.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: About 55 minutes
Yield: 6 large servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 medium onions, chopped
2 large green bell peppers, seeded and 
chopped
2 stalks celery, minced
4 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon oregano
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon black pepper
One 15-ounce can tomato sauce
One 16-ounce can stewed tomatoes or whole 
peeled tomatoes
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 bay leaf
1 cup cashew pieces
1⁄3 cup raisins
3 cups cooked dark red kidney beans (two 
15-ounce cans)
 1 In a large pot, heat the olive oil. Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery and cook over 
medium heat until the onions are translucent — about 10 minutes.
 2 Stir in the garlic, basil, oregano, chili powder, cumin, and pepper.
 3 Add the tomato sauce, tomatoes (with their juice), vinegar, and bay leaf. Reduce the 
heat to low and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes.
 4 Stir in the cashews and raisins and cook over low heat for another 16 to 17 minutes.
 5 Add the beans and cook for an additional 25 minutes, stirring frequently. The chili is done 
when all the ingredients are well blended and soft and the chili is thick and bubbly.

Going Beyond Iceberg Lettuce
Chilled salads made with fresh, seasonal ingredients are palate-pleasing refresh-
ments in summer months and add contrast to the warmth and texture of cooked 
foods in cold-weather months. These dishes are delicious and very easy to make.
 
Arugula Salad with Pickled 
 
Beets and Candied Pecans
This salad is a delicious and nutritious alternative to mixed green salads. Bottled, pick-
led beets from your pantry and candied pecans available in many supermarkets make 
this special salad a snap to assemble.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 ounces goat cheese or chèvre
2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper for 
dipping
6 heaping cups arugula, washed, with heavy 
stems removed
1 cup sliced, pickled beets
1 cup candied pecan halves
 1 Divide the goat cheese or chèvre into 12 portions. Let the cheese stand at room temperature 
for 10 to 15 minutes, and then roll it into balls and dip one side of each ball into the pepper.
 2 Arrange the arugula on 6 plates. Cut the beet slices in half, and then distribute the beets 
and pecans evenly over the arugula. Put 2 balls of cheese on each plate.
 3 Drizzle the salad with your favorite vinaigrette dressing and serve immediately.
Vary It! Vegans omit the goat cheese. Also good: Sprinkle the salad with dried cherries or 
dried cranberries.

Arugula
Arugula, also called rocket salad or roquette, 
is a dark, leafy green known for its distinctive 
sharp, spicy, peppery flavor, similar to that 
of mustard greens. Arugula is native to the 
Mediterranean and grows wild throughout 
southern Europe. You can serve it cooked, but 
it’s most popular as a salad green. Arugula is 
becoming very popular in the U.S., and you can 
find it in many supermarkets.
 
Easy Four-Bean Salad
My advice: Double this recipe. It’s delicious, and the leftovers taste even better after a 
day or two in the refrigerator. If you prefer a less sweet salad, reduce the amount of 
sugar to your taste.
Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus chilling time
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
One 151⁄2-ounce can cut green beans, drained 
and rinsed
One 151⁄2-ounce can cut wax beans, drained 
and rinsed
One 151⁄2-ounce can dark red kidney beans, 
drained and rinsed
One 151⁄2-ounce can garbanzo beans, drained 
and rinsed
1⁄2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1⁄2 red onion, chopped
1⁄2 cup sugar (or less, to taste)
2⁄3 cup red wine vinegar
1⁄3 cup vegetable oil (avoid olive oil, as it 
solidifies in the refrigerator)
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons black pepper
 1 Place the green beans, wax beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, bell pepper, and 
onion in a large bowl.
 2 Combine the sugar, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl or cup, stir well, and pour over the 
bean mixture. Add the salt and pepper and toss to coat.
 3 Chill overnight. Toss again to coat the beans before serving.

Italian Chopped Salad
Everyone remembers his or her first Italian chopped salad. Mine was in the beach town 
of Lahaina on the western coast of Maui. Exact proportions or measurements aren’t 
necessary. The key is that you chop everything into tiny pieces. That’s what makes this 
salad so addictive — the texture. You’ll eat heaping bowls full of this salad — a good 
thing, because it’s as nutritious as it is delicious.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 large head of romaine lettuce, chopped into 
1⁄2-inch squares
1 cup canned garbanzo beans, rinsed, drained, 
and chopped
1⁄2 cucumber, peeled and minced
1⁄2 green bell pepper, seeded and finely 
chopped
1⁄2 yellow or orange bell pepper, seeded and 
finely chopped
2 or 3 radishes, minced
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1⁄2 medium red onion, minced
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped into 1⁄4-
inch pieces
2 or 3 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh 
parsley
1⁄3 cup chopped black olives
1⁄2 cup grated Parmesan cheese or finely 
chopped, reduced-fat Swiss cheese (optional)
Vinaigrette dressing to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
 1 Mix all the vegetables and cheese (if desired) in a salad bowl. Add your favorite Italian 
or vinaigrette dressing, and toss well.
 2 Divide the salad into six bowls and add pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
Vary It! Use up whatever salad ingredients you have on hand. Finely chopped yellow 
summer squash or zucchini, banana peppers, grated carrot, and jicama are good in this 
salad.

Tofu Salad
If you’ve never tried tofu salad, you’re in for a nice surprise. Many variations exist. This 
recipe is similar to traditional egg salad, but tofu takes the place of egg whites, and tur-
meric and mustard provide the color. The result is a mock egg salad that tastes and 
looks very much like the real thing. Serve it as a sandwich filling on bread, crackers, or 
rolls, or in a pita pocket with grated carrots. This salad also works well served on a bed 
of salad greens or as stuffing for a fresh, ripe tomato.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 pound firm tofu
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup soy mayonnaise
2 teaspoons yellow mustard
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon turmeric
1⁄4 cup finely chopped celery
2 green onions, finely chopped
 1 Mash the tofu with a fork or potato masher until crumbly.
 2 Add the salt, mayonnaise, mustard, garlic powder, pepper, and turmeric and mix well.
 3 Add the celery and green onions and mix well. Chill before serving.

On the Side
You can serve any of the soups or salads I include in this chapter as simple 
side dishes at almost any meal. A small cup of soup on the side of the plate, a 
scoop of tofu salad, or a handful of green salad serve as nutritious garnishes — 
a touch of color or cool crunch — at the same time that they round out your 
meals.
I wrap up this chapter with two popular side dishes that you can serve with a 
variety of foods.

Tabbouleh
Lemon juice gives this Middle Eastern dish its tangy flavor, and mint provides its char-
acteristic fragrance. You can serve tabbouleh as a side dish with sandwiches and burg-
ers, or add it to hummus in a pita pocket.
Preparation time: 20 minutes, including time to cook bulgur wheat and let it cool
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 cups water
1 cup bulgur wheat
1⁄4 cup olive oil
Juice of 1 large lemon (about 1⁄4 cup)
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
3 green onions, chopped (white and green 
parts)
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1⁄2 cup canned garbanzo beans, drained and 
rinsed
2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped
 1 Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the bulgur wheat, reduce the heat to low, 
cover, and simmer until the bulgur absorbs all the water — about 8 to 10 minutes.
 2 Remove the bulgur wheat from the stovetop and set it aside to cool for about 15 
minutes.
 3 In a medium bowl, combine the cooled bulgur wheat and the remaining ingredients 
(except the tomatoes) and toss well.
 4 Chill the tabbouleh for at least 2 hours before serving. It’s best when you chill it over-
night. Add tomatoes and toss again just before serving.
Vary It! Reduce the mint (or leave it out entirely) if you’re not a big fan.

Seasoned Home Fries
This is the ultimate easy recipe — you don’t have to measure anything, and it comes 
out great every time. These potatoes are hugely popular with everyone I serve them to, 
and the leftovers are good reheated. The cayenne pepper and paprika give the potatoes 
a nice coppery color, but you can leave out or reduce the amount of the cayenne 
pepper if you like your food less spicy. You can pair this dish with Scrambled Tofu or 
Mushroom Quiche with Caramelized Onions from Chapter 9, or with any sandwich and 
many entrées.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: About 8 servings
Vegetable oil spray
6 medium white potatoes
Several shakes each of garlic powder, 
oregano, cayenne pepper, and paprika
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Coat a baking sheet with vegetable oil spray or a thin layer of olive oil.
 3 Wash the potatoes. Leaving the peels on, cut the potatoes into wedges and place them 
in a mixing bowl. (You can quarter small potatoes. Cut fist-sized potatoes into 6 or 8 
wedges each.)
 4 Sprinkle the potato wedges with several shakes of each of the spices, more or less to 
your taste. Toss to coat.
 5 Spread the potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheet. Spray the tops with a thin film 
of vegetable oil spray, or brush with olive oil.
 6 Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft. Serve plain, with ketchup or 
salsa, or with malt vinegar for dipping.

I
f you’re new to a vegetarian diet, visualizing 
meatless meals may be hard at first. Western 
culture tends to define meals by the meat that’s 
served. Ask some nonvegetarian friends what 
they’re having for dinner tonight, and they’re 
likely to mention the chicken or fish — not the 
salad or the peas and carrots.
In fact, vegetarian meals often have no main dish or entrée. Instead, vegetar-
ians can make a meal of any number of side dishes. Beans, rice, vegetables, 
and other foods come together and fill the plate in colorful combinations of 
healthful, tasty foods.
Who says you need a focal point?
When there is a focal point, vegetarian entrées often resemble meat-based 
entrées — minus the meat. Lasagna, burritos, and pizza, for example, can all 
be made meat-free.
Other vegetarian main dishes reflect cuisines from cultures around the 
world. Delicious stir-fries, bean and rice dishes, and soy foods are some 
examples I include in this chapter.

Cajun Red Beans and Rice
This dish is a tradition in deep-South coastal states such as Louisiana, where seasoned 
beans and rice are a favorite among people of mixed French, Spanish, and African 
descent. If you make the rice ahead of time, this dish takes very little time to prepare. 
Toss a salad and steam some broccoli or greens, and dinner’s ready.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1⁄2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 stalk celery, including green leaves, 
chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
1⁄2 teaspoon thyme
Two 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans, 
rinsed and drained (about 3 cups)
41⁄2 cups cooked rice
Fresh parsley for garnish
 1 In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Cook the onions, garlic, bell pepper, and celery in the 
oil over medium heat until the onions are translucent — about 7 minutes. Add the salt, 
cumin, chili powder, and thyme, and stir to combine.
 2 Add the beans and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for several 
minutes until the beans are hot, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.
 3 Add the rice to the bean mixture and mix all the ingredients well. Cook for about 5 min-
utes to heat the rice through before serving. Garnish with sprigs of parsley.

Beans: Versatility in a Can
Beans are a staple ingredient that nearly every culture uses. Inexpensive and 
one of the most nutritious sources of protein, they should be a mainstay on 
your vegetarian menus. I include three favorite recipes here.

 Chapter 12: Making Meatless Main Dishes
 
Basic Bean Burrito
You can doctor up this burrito anyway you like, but here’s a bare-bones version that 
virtually everyone loves. If you use whole beans, mash them with a potato masher or 
fork and mix them until they’re smooth in consistency. Cheese eaters can add a couple 
tablespoons of grated, low-fat cheddar cheese or cheese alternative to the topping if 
desired.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 7 minutes
Yield: 4 burritos
2 cups canned vegetarian refried beans, plain 
mashed pinto beans, or black beans
Four 10-inch whole-wheat flour tortillas
Chopped tomato, romaine lettuce or spinach, 
and green onions (any combination, about 1 
cup total)
1⁄4 cup plain nonfat yogurt or low-fat sour 
cream (vegans can use soy yogurt or nondairy 
sour cream)
1 cup salsa
 1 In a small saucepan, warm the beans over medium heat until heated through — about 7 
minutes.
 2 For each burrito, follow these instructions:
 
 Lay a tortilla flat on a dinner plate. (Warm it first, if you like, by heating it on each side 
for a minute or two in a hot skillet). Spoon about 1⁄2 cup of the beans onto the center of 
the tortilla.
 
 Fold one end of the tortilla toward the middle, and then fold the sides toward the 
middle. Leave the burrito on the plate with the end of the fold tucked underneath so 
that the burrito doesn’t unroll (see Figure 12-1).
 3 Top with salsa, chopped tomato, greens, and green onion. Add a dollop of plain yogurt 
and serve immediately.
Vary It! Express yourself by adding banana or jalapeño peppers, sliced black olives, sliced 
avocado, mashed sweet potatoes, strips of cooked tempeh . . . or whatever suits your fancy.

Cuban Black Beans
Serve these beans over a plate of your favorite steamed rice, or thin the beans with veg-
etable broth and serve them as black bean soup. This flavorful, hearty dish goes well 
with a refreshing green salad and a chunk of crusty bread.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, chopped (see Figure 12-2)
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 stalks celery, including green leaves, 
chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
4 cups (two 20-ounce cans) black beans, 
drained and rinsed (or 2 cups dried black 
beans, soaked or cooked in a pressure 
cooker)
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 bay leaf
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
2 tablespoons lemon juice
 1 In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Cook the onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic in the 
oil over medium heat until the onions are translucent (about 10 minutes).
 2 Add the beans, salt, bay leaf, cumin, oregano, and lemon juice, and stir well to combine.
 3 Cover and simmer for another 35 or 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent stick-
ing. Remove the bay leaf and serve over rice.

Pasta-Mania
Pasta is a fun food. Multi-colored, multi-shaped varieties served with different 
types of sauce and extras make pasta almost endlessly versatile. There’s a 
variation to suit nearly every palate. Leftover pasta keeps in the refrigerator 
for several days or in the freezer for several months.
 
Pesto Pasta Primavera
Pesto is a sauce that’s traditionally made with basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, garlic, 
and olive oil. This dish is best in the summertime, when basil is fresh and you can make 
a batch of pesto from scratch. Pesto is a snap to make, and it fills your home with the 
wonderful aroma of fresh basil. This recipe makes about double the amount of pesto 
that you use for a pound of pasta. Store the leftover pesto in an airtight container for 
one week in the refrigerator, or freeze it in a small jar or airtight plastic bag for several 
months. When you can’t make your own pesto, substitute ready-made pesto from the 
supermarket and have dinner ready in minutes.
Primavera means “spring” in Italian. In culinary circles, primavera dishes are made with 
a variety of fresh vegetables and herbs.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: About 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Pesto:
3 cups chopped fresh basil leaves, 
lightly packed
4 cloves garlic, peeled
4 tablespoons pine nuts
6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese or a 
combination of Parmesan and Romano 
cheeses
1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper
1⁄3 cup olive oil
Pasta:
1 pound whole-wheat fettuccine or other 
pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound asparagus, trimmed and sliced 
diagonally in 1⁄4-inch pieces
1 medium zucchini, sliced
1 medium carrot, sliced very thin
1⁄2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
2 green onions, chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
1⁄2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1⁄2 cup pine nuts
6 cherry tomato halves and several sprigs of 
parsley for garnish

189
 Chapter 12: Making Meatless Main Dishes
 1 Place the basil, garlic, pine nuts, cheese, and pepper in a blender or food processor. 
Process until well blended and smooth, and then dribble in the olive oil. Continue pro-
cessing until the mixture is the consistency of a smooth paste. Set aside.
 2 In a large pot, cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside. 
(Follow Steps 2 through 5 while the pasta is cooking.)
 3 In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the pine nuts and cook on medium 
heat, stirring frequently, until the pine nuts begin to sizzle. Continue cooking until they 
become golden brown (about 3 minutes), taking care not to let them burn. Remove 
them from the heat and set them aside.
 4 In a large skillet, heat the remaining olive oil. Cook the onion and garlic in the oil over 
medium heat until the onions are translucent — about 7 minutes.
 5 Add the asparagus, zucchini, carrot, and mushrooms, and cook over medium heat for 5 
minutes.
 6 Add the peas and green onions. Heat for 2 minutes.
 7 Add the pepper, and then add the cooked pasta, cheese, pine nuts, and pesto, tossing 
until the ingredients are well mixed. Serve immediately. Garnish with cherry tomato 
halves and parsley.
Vary It! For a vegan version, omit the Parmesan cheese, or substitute nutritional yeast for 
all or part of it. Alternatively, leave out the pesto sauce and instead toss the pasta with 
herbs, spices, vegetables, and an additional 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil. You can also 
substitute chopped walnuts for toasted pine nuts.

Rotini with Chopped Tomatoes 
 
and Fresh Basil
You can make this light, simple dish any time of the year, but I like to make it in the 
summertime, when tomatoes and basil are in season and fresh. Vegans can substitute 
soy cheese for regular cheese, or leave out the cheese entirely. You can also substitute 
nutritional yeast for all or part of the Parmesan cheese. Leftovers are delicious the next 
day, after the pasta has absorbed the flavors of the sauce.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes or less for pasta
Yield: 6 servings
3 cups diced ripe roma tomatoes (scoop out 
and discard most of the seeds)
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh basil
8 ounces shredded part-skim mozzarella 
cheese
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1⁄2 cup chopped walnuts
1 pound whole-wheat rotini (spiral-shaped) 
pasta
4 tablespoons olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
Black olives and parsley for garnish
 1 In a medium bowl, toss together the tomatoes, basil, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan 
cheese, and walnuts.
 2 In a large pot, cook the rotini according to package instructions and drain.
 3 In the pot or in a large bowl, toss the pasta with the olive oil. Next, add the tomato mix-
ture and toss until well combined.
 4 Serve on individual plates and add freshly ground black pepper to taste. Garnish each 
plate with a black olive and a sprig of parsley.

Vegetarian Lasagna
Bottled pasta sauce and no-boil lasagna noodles make the preparation for this dish 
quick and easy. This dish appeals to vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike. Serve it with 
a simple green salad and crusty bread.

191
 Chapter 12: Making Meatless Main Dishes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 large head or 2 small heads broccoli
2 medium zucchini and/or yellow (summer) 
squash
1 cup carrots, grated
3 cups reduced-fat ricotta cheese
4 egg whites
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon thyme
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
3⁄4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 jar (about 24 ounces) prepared pasta sauce
8 ounces no-boil whole-wheat lasagna 
noodles
12 ounces shredded part-skim mozzarella 
cheese (3 cups)
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Chop the broccoli and zucchini or squash into small pieces. In a medium skillet, heat 
the olive oil. Cook the onions in the oil over medium heat until they’re translucent — 
about 7 minutes. Add the broccoli, zucchini, and carrots, and steam for 2 to 3 minutes 
to partially cook. Remove from the heat.
 3 In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg whites, oregano, thyme, parsley, pepper, 
and half the Parmesan cheese.
 4 In a lightly oiled, 13-x-17-inch pan, layer the lasagna as follows:
 
 Put a generous layer of pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan.
 
 Lay 4 uncooked lasagna noodles on the sauce (or the number of noodles needed to fit 
the pan in a single layer; break the noodles if necessary to fit).
 
 Add a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, and then half the vegetable mixture, followed 
by half the mozzarella cheese.
 
 Repeat the layers, and then top it off with another layer of noodles, more pasta sauce, 
and the remaining Parmesan cheese.
 5 Bake for 1 hour, or until brown and bubbly.
Vary It! If you have sun-dried tomato pesto or basil pesto on hand, spread some of that on 
top of the lasagna along with the pasta sauce (or mixed in with the pasta sauce) in Step 4.

All-Time Favorites
Who says you can’t enjoy a slice of pizza or a sloppy Joe on a vegetarian diet? 
These days, just about any old favorite recipe has a vegetarian counterpart. I 
include two popular examples in this section.
 
Roasted Vegetable Pizza
Pizza in its simplest form — with fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese — is vege-
tarian. In this recipe, I show you how to take it one step further, adding roasted vegeta-
bles for rich flavor. But don’t stop there. With a homemade base of pizza dough, you 
can be creative and try many different topping combinations. Another option: Leave off 
the cheese. You’ll be surprised how good a vegan, cheeseless pizza tastes. And without 
all that high-fat dairy cheese, pizza can be a guiltless indulgence.
This recipe makes two pizzas. Make both pizzas at the same time, or save half the 
dough for another day. Pizza dough keeps in the freezer for up to three months.
Preparation time: About 50 minutes (including time for dough to rise)
Cooking time: 65 to 70 minutes
Yield: 2 large pizzas (4 servings, or 8 slices per pizza)
Pizza Dough:
11⁄2 teaspoons yeast
13⁄4 cups warm water (110 degrees)
1 tablespoon honey or sugar
1 teaspoon olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
2 cups whole-wheat flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
Extra oil to grease the pizza pan
Pizza Toppings:
2 cups combined of your choice of washed, 
chopped vegetables (whatever you have on 
hand): broccoli, mushrooms, green bell 
peppers, onions, black olives
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3⁄4 cup bottled pizza sauce (more or less to suit 
your taste)
2 cups shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
 2 In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water (about 110 degrees) and add 
the honey or sugar. Add the oil and salt and stir.
 3 Gradually add the flour, alternating between whole-wheat and white. Mix well after each 
addition using a wooden spoon or your hands to make a soft dough.

193
 Chapter 12: Making Meatless Main Dishes
 4 Turn out the dough onto a floured board and knead for 5 minutes, adding more flour if 
needed.
 5 Lightly oil the sides of the mixing bowl. Put the dough in the bowl, turn the dough over 
once, cover with a towel or waxed paper, and let set in a warm place for about an hour.
 6 While the dough rises, wash and chop the vegetables for the pizza toppings.
 7 Pour olive oil and balsamic vinegar onto the bottom of a 13-x-9-inch baking dish. Add 
the vegetables and toss to coat them with oil and vinegar. Spread evenly on the bottom 
of the baking dish and roast in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until 
the vegetables are cooked and browned. Set aside.
 8 Divide the dough in half. Reserve one half for later if desired (store in the refrigerator or 
freezer).
 9 Give the dough a quick knead, and then pull and stretch it out onto an oiled, 14-inch 
pizza pan. You can also roll the dough out first on a floured surface, or simply press the 
ball of dough onto the pizza pan and distribute it evenly by using your hands. If it 
springs back too much, let it rest for 5 minutes, and then stretch it again.
 10 Spoon on the pizza sauce and spread it to within 1⁄2 inch of the edge of the dough.
 11 Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the pizza, and then add the vegetable 
toppings.
 12 Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, until the crust and/or cheese 
begins to brown lightly. Do not overcook.
 13 Remove from the oven and let set for 5 minutes.
 14 Cut into slices and serve.

Tempeh Sloppy Joes
This is many people’s favorite alternative to burgers and hot dogs. Serve this sandwich 
filling on whole-grain burger buns. It’s also good served on whole-grain toast. Sloppy 
Joe filling made with tempeh tastes similar to — but not as greasy as — the kind made 
with meat.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: About 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 medium onion, chopped
1⁄2 green bell pepper, chopped
One 8-ounce package tempeh (any variety), 
crumbled into small pieces
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1⁄2 cup spaghetti sauce
1 teaspoon brown mustard (or other mustard)
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 teaspoons sugar
4 whole-grain burger buns
 1 In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic, onion, and bell pepper, and 
cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent — about 10 minutes. Add the 
tempeh and soy sauce and stir well. Cook for an additional 2 minutes.
 2 Add the spaghetti sauce, mustard, vinegar, and sugar. Mix well and simmer for 10 min-
utes. Serve on whole-grain buns.

Vegetable Stir-Fry
Chinese stir-fries traditionally use peanut oil to cook and flavor the vegetables. More 
convenient and just as effective for flavor is peanut butter, which this recipe uses. Feel 
free to vary the amounts or varieties of vegetables according to your preferences and 
what you have on hand. This meal is highly nutritious — full of vitamins, minerals, and 
fiber. Leftovers aren’t a problem — this dish tastes great reheated.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: About 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound firm or extra-firm tofu, sliced into 
rectangles (approximately 1⁄4 inch x 11⁄2 inch)
1 large onion, chopped
3 stalks celery, thinly sliced
3 carrots, thinly sliced
1 cup broccoli florets
1⁄2 cup sliced canned water chestnuts
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
3 cups sliced bok choy (Chinese cabbage)
2 cups mung bean sprouts
1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1⁄4 cup water
 1 In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sugar, ginger, and garlic. Set aside.
 2 In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the tofu and fry it on 
both sides until browned. Remove, place on a plate lined with paper towels, and set 
aside.
 3 Add the onion, celery, and carrots to the skillet, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 
minutes, stirring frequently.
 4 Add the remaining vegetables, peanut butter, and soy sauce mixture, and continue to 
cook for an additional 2 minutes. Stir.
 5 Add the cornstarch and water and continue to cook until the liquid thickens and all the 
ingredients are steaming hot. Serve immediately over rice.

Soy-Ginger Kale with Tempeh
This is a staple in my home from spring through fall, when the CSA (community-
supported agriculture) farm to which I subscribe delivers organic kale nearly every 
week. (See Chapter 7 for additional information on CSA farms.) The soy-ginger sauce 
makes this dish slightly sweet and delicious. I serve it with steamed brown rice or 
seasoned couscous.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 bunch kale (about 1 pound)
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1⁄2 cup chopped onion (about half of a 
medium-sized onion)
1⁄3 cup plus 1⁄4 cup of your favorite bottled 
soy-ginger sauce
One 8-ounce block of tempeh (any variety), 
chopped into 1⁄2-inch cubes
A few tablespoons of water
 1 Rinse the kale leaves well, removing and discarding the thick stems. Cut the rinsed 
leaves into 1⁄2-inch-wide strips (do not pat dry). Set aside.
 2 In a large skillet over low heat, cook the olive oil, garlic, and onions for about 5 minutes, 
stirring to prevent sticking.
 3 Add the kale, and then pour 1⁄3 cup of the soy-ginger sauce over the mixture. Cover and 
cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until tender, stirring occasionally to 
make sure the kale doesn’t stick (add a few extra tablespoons of soy-ginger sauce, if 
necessary).
 4 In a small skillet over medium heat, add 1⁄4 cup of soy-ginger sauce, followed by the 
tempeh cubes. When the sauce and tempeh begin to sizzle (about 5 minutes), turn the 
tempeh using a spatula. Reduce heat, add a few tablespoons of water, and cook for an 
additional 5 minutes, or until the tempeh is browned on both sides. Be careful not to let 
the sauce burn. Remove from heat.
 5 Remove the lid from the kale. Lift and stir the mixture with a spatula, and then transfer 
it to a shallow serving bowl. Top with the tempeh cubes and serve.
Vary It! Replace kale with other greens, such as Swiss chard or collards.

Baking Easy Breads and Rolls
In This Chapter
▶ Incorporating whole-grain goodness
▶ Keeping home-baked goodies on hand
B
read — the “staff of life” — is a dietary 
staple around the world. It’s hard to think 
of anything more inviting in a home than the fra-
grance of freshly baked bread.
There’s room for bread on the table at breakfast, 
lunch, or supper. Muffins, quick breads, and homemade biscuits make good 
snacks anytime, too. I discuss in more detail in Chapter 6 the different types 
of cereal grains used to make breads and rolls, and in Chapter 3 I cover the 
nutritional merits of grains (plenty!). The recipes I include in this chapter are 
a sampling of the many types of breads you can enjoy on a vegetarian diet.
 
If you eat out, be aware that meats such as bacon and minced ham are sometimes 
added to biscuits, loaf breads, and rolls. In the American South, cracklin’ corn-
bread is made by stirring small, crunchy pieces of fried pork fat into the batter.
 
Most important, I want to convey the notion that breads are easy to bake and 
enjoy at home and that they complement and round out many vegetarian 
meals. Enjoy a slice or share a batch!

Whole-Wheat Crescent Rolls
These rolls fill the house with the delicious aroma of yeast bread and make any meal 
special. Their texture is soft and slightly chewy. They stay fresh for two or three days, 
and they also freeze well. The addition of whole-wheat flour makes these rolls more 
nutritious and flavorful than rolls made only with refined white flour. It also gives them 
a nice light brown color.
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus 21⁄2 hours for the dough to rise
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 32 rolls
1 package (1⁄4 ounce) active dry yeast
1⁄4 cup warm water
3⁄4 cup warm milk
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon salt
2 egg whites
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil
11⁄2 cups whole-wheat flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
Olive oil
 1 In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast completely in the water.
 2 Add the milk, sugar, honey, salt, egg whites, oil, and whole-wheat flour. Stir until all the 
ingredients are well combined and the dough is smooth.
 3 Add the all-purpose flour and mix until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is too sticky 
to handle, add several more tablespoons of flour as necessary.
 4 Place the dough on a floured surface and knead for several minutes until it’s smooth 
and elastic. (See Figure 13-1 for the proper technique for kneading bread dough.)
 5 Oil a large bowl with olive oil. Place the dough ball in the bowl and turn it over once so 
that you lightly coat the top of the dough ball with oil. Cover with a towel or waxed 
paper and let the dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size — about 2 hours.
 6 Punch down the dough ball with your fist; then divide the ball into two pieces.
 7 Place the dough balls one at a time on a floured surface. Roll each piece of dough into a 
circle approximately 12 inches in diameter. Lightly brush each circle with vegetable oil. 
With a sharp knife, cut the circle in half, and then in quarters, continuing until you have 
16 wedges of dough (see Figure 13-2).

199
 Chapter 13: Baking Easy Breads and Rolls
 8 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Beginning at the wide end of each wedge, roll the 
dough into a crescent shape, ending by pressing the tip onto the roll. Set each roll on a 
lightly oiled baking sheet and bend the ends slightly to give the roll a crescent shape.
 9 Cover and let the rolls rise for about 30 minutes before baking. Bake for 20 minutes, or 
until the rolls are lightly browned. Do not overcook.

Banana Chip Muffins
Everyone loves these muffins, and they’re a great way to use up bananas that are 
becoming too ripe. They freeze well, so make a batch whenever you have extra bananas 
and you’ll have muffins on hand when you want them.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 12 muffins
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon powdered vegetarian egg 
replacer (EnerG Egg Replacer) blended with 4 
tablespoons water*
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 ripe bananas, mashed
11⁄2 cups all-purpose flour
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 cup wheat germ (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
6 ounces chocolate chips (about 1 cup)
* or use 4 egg whites instead of egg replacer 
and water

201
 Chapter 13: Baking Easy Breads and Rolls
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, sugar, egg replacer/water, and vanilla. Add 
the bananas and blend well with a whisk or an electric mixer.
 3 Add the flour, wheat germ (if desired), baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold the 
dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with quick strokes — be careful not to overmix.
 4 Stir in the chocolate chips.
 5 Spoon the batter into lined or oiled muffin cups and bake for 20 minutes, or until muf-
fins are golden brown. When cool enough to handle, remove muffins from cups.
Vary It! Substitute carob chips or butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips. Add a handful 
of chopped walnuts or pecans.

Pumpkin Biscuits
Serve these with honey for breakfast in the fall, or with the Cashew Chili in Chapter 11 
in lieu of cornbread for a change of pace.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 12 biscuits
1 cup unbleached, all-purpose flour
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄4 teaspoon allspice
1⁄3 cup Earth Balance or other trans fat-free

 4 Fold in the pumpkin, and then gradually add milk, stirring to make dough. Use your 
clean hands if necessary to shape the dough into a ball.
 5 Roll the dough out onto a cool, floured surface to about 1⁄2 inch thick. Using a juice glass 
or a small, round cookie cutter, cut the dough into rounds and place them onto an oiled 
baking sheet. Push together and roll the dough scraps to cut out the remaining biscuits.
 6 Bake for about 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Be careful not to overcook.
Vary It! Add a handful of chopped pecans or dried cranberries.

▶ Checking out some chocolate alternatives
▶ Making greater use of fruits

M
ost people think of dessert as a guilt-
inducing indulgence that’s not very nutri-
tious and is loaded with calories. Where most 
commercial cakes, cookies, and pies are con-
cerned, this is usually true!
Though most desserts contain no meat, many do 
contain oodles of artery-clogging saturated fat and 
calories from rich dairy ingredients and eggs. Desserts made with gelatin — a 
vegetarian no-no — are usually junky, with lots of added sugar and artificial 
colors and flavors, too.
That’s where the vegetarian alternative can help. Make no mistake — just 
because a dessert is vegetarian doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed to be better for 
your health. In general, though, desserts made from scratch at home using 
wholesome ingredients and fewer animal products tend to be better for you.
The recipes in this chapter will convince you to extend the vegetarian way 
to the desserts you bake every day. Many of these recipes incorporate fruit 
to boost the nutritional value and lower the calorie content, and, where pos-
sible, whole-wheat flour replaces white.
Chocolate Desserts
Sometimes, nothing but chocolate will do. The desserts in this section will satisfy 
the chocolate lovers in your life and add a delicious finishing touch to any meal.
The first two recipes are kid-pleasers and lunchbox staples — cupcakes and 
cookies. They freeze and travel well. The remaining two recipes include a

decadent — but much more healthful — tofu version of a classic cheesecake 
and a foolproof, make-it-in-minutes chocolate cake that I guarantee everyone 
will love.
 
Cocoa Pink Cupcakes
I adapted this recipe from one that has been a favorite in my family since I was a little 
girl. These cupcakes have a not-too-sweet, mild cocoa flavor. The cocoa gives them a 
rosy brown color on the inside.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: About 22 cupcakes
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
21⁄2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 teaspoon salt
3⁄4 cup vegetable oil
11⁄4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon powdered vegetarian egg 
replacer (EnerG Egg Replacer) blended with 
4 tablespoons water*
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup cold water
6 ounces (1 cup) semi-sweet chocolate chips
1⁄2 cup chopped walnuts
Confectioners’ sugar
* or use 4 egg whites instead of egg replacer 
and water
 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
 2 In a small bowl, combine both types of flour with the cocoa and salt, stir to blend, and 
then set aside.
 3 In a large mixing bowl, cream the oil and sugar together, and then add the egg replacer 
and vanilla.
 4 In a cup, combine the baking soda and water and stir to dissolve.
 5 Add the baking soda mixture alternately with the dry ingredients to the creamed mix-
ture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and blending well on low speed 
after each addition.
 6 Stir half the chocolate chips and nuts into the batter.
 7 Line muffin tins with paper liners and fill each a little more than half full with batter.
 8 Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips and nuts over the tops of the cupcakes.
 9 Bake for about 25 minutes. The cupcakes should appear done but no more than very 
lightly browned. Be careful not to overcook them, or they’ll become dry.
 10 After the cupcakes cool, sift confectioners’ sugar over the tops.

Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies
A slightly healthier version of the classic, these drop cookies are chewy and moist.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes per batch
Yield: About 6 dozen cookies
3⁄4 cup trans fat-free margarine, softened
1⁄2 cup packed brown sugar

replacer blended with 1⁄4 cup water
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
11⁄4 cups all-purpose flour

1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 cups rolled oats
11⁄2 cups (12 ounces) carob chips
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 In a mixing bowl, cream the margarine, sugars, egg replacer, and vanilla until smooth.
 3 In a separate bowl, mix both types of flour with the salt, baking soda, baking powder, 
and cinnamon. Add to the butter mixture and mix well.
 4 Stir in the oats. The batter will be very stiff.
 5 Add the carob chips and mix thoroughly using clean hands.
 6 Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonfuls about 3 inches apart on an ungreased cookie 
sheet. Bake each batch for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned.

Rich Chocolate Tofu Cheesecake
Tofu makes a fabulous replacement for cream cheese in cheesecake recipes. This 
cheesecake has a rich chocolate flavor and a smooth, creamy texture. I adapted it from 
a recipe in Tofu Cookery (25th Anniversary Edition) by Louise Hagler (Book Publishing 
Company). You can also use a ready-made 9-inch graham cracker crust (which holds 
the same volume as the 8-inch springform pan used in this recipe).
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes (plus 2 hours to chill)
Yield: 8 servings (1 pie)
Filling:
11⁄4 pounds firm tofu
11⁄2 cups sugar
3 ounces (3 squares) semi-sweet baking 
chocolate
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1⁄2 teaspoon pure almond extract
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
Crust:
11⁄4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 tablespoon sugar
1⁄3 cup trans fat-free margarine
 1 Remove tofu from packaging and place it in a clean sink. Cover the tofu with waxed paper 
and a heavy weight, and let it drain for 20 minutes. While the tofu drains, make the crust.
 2 For the crust, combine the graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a medium bowl. Melt 
the margarine in a saucepan over low heat, and then add it to the crumb mixture. Stir 
until blended, and then press the crumbs into the bottom and sides of an 8-inch, non-
stick springform pan. Set aside.
 3 In a blender or food processor, blend the drained tofu, 1⁄4 pound at a time, with 1 cup of 
the sugar, adding 1⁄4 cup sugar with each addition of tofu (set aside the remaining 1⁄2 cup 
sugar for later). Process until the ingredients are well blended.
 4 Pour the tofu-sugar mixture into a bowl. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 5 In a double boiler or saucepan, melt the chocolate. While the chocolate is melting, place 
the graham cracker crust in the oven and cook for about 8 minutes; then remove, set 
aside, and let cool.
 6 After the chocolate has melted, add it to the tofu mixture. Mix in the vanilla, almond 
extract, salt, and remaining 1⁄2 cup sugar. Blend well.
 7 Pour the mixture into the graham cracker crust and bake for about 40 minutes. When 
the cheesecake is done, the edges will rise slightly, with small cracks on the surface. 
The middle won’t rise, but it will be springy to the touch and have a dry, firm appear-
ance. Chill the cheesecake for at least 2 hours after baking.
Vary It! Top the cheesecake with fresh raspberries or a thawed bag of frozen raspberries 
mixed with a few tablespoons of sugar. You can also top the cheesecake with canned cherries.

Easy Vegan Chocolate Cake
This is the recipe I turn to when there’s nothing in the house for dessert and I want to make 
something delicious — fast. This family favorite is a no-fail, quick and easy recipe using 
common ingredients you probably have in your pantry. Add your own frosting if you’d like, 
but I just dust with confectioners’ sugar before serving. I adapted this recipe from the 
Moosewood Collective’s Moosewood Restaurant Book of Desserts (Three Rivers Press).
Preparation time: 6 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 squares
11⁄2 cups unbleached white flour
1⁄3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup cold water or cold coffee
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
Confectioners’ sugar, for serving
 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
 2 Oil an 8-inch square cake pan. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar 
directly into the cake pan.
 3 In a 2-cup measuring cup, mix the oil, cold water or coffee, and vanilla.
 4 Pour the liquid ingredients into the cake pan and mix the batter with a fork or a small 
whisk. When the batter is smooth, add the vinegar and stir quickly. The batter will have 
pale swirls as the baking soda and vinegar react. Stir just until the vinegar is evenly dis-
tributed throughout the batter.
 5 Bake for about 30 minutes and set aside to cool. Using a mesh strainer, shake confec-
tioners’ sugar on top of the cake immediately before serving.
Vary It! Serve with nonfat or nondairy ice cream or sliced fruit.

Fruit Desserts
Fruit desserts are a good choice because they add fiber and other health-
supporting nutrients while still satisfying a sweet tooth. They also tend to be 
lower in calories than desserts made with lots of refined flours, sugar, and fat.
The desserts that follow are wholesome enough that you can even enjoy 
them for breakfast or as a snack.
 
Baked Apples
Baked apples are quick and convenient to make when you already have the oven heated 
to bake a casserole or loaf of bread. They keep in the refrigerator for up to three days, 
and they’re good any time of the day or night — warm with ice cream, cold for break-
fast, or as a snack.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
4 large, tart apples
1⁄2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon trans fat-free margarine
1⁄2 cup apple juice (optional)
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Wash and core the apples, stopping the coring just before the bottom of the apple (so 
that the hole doesn’t go all the way through). Using a paring knife, cut away the peel 
from the top to about one-third of the way down each apple (see Figure 14-1).
 3 In a small dish or cup, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Spoon one-quarter of 
the mixture into the center of each apple.
 4 Divide the margarine into quarters and put one chunk in the center of each apple.
 5 Set the apples in an 8-x-8-inch baking dish or a 1-quart casserole dish and add water or 
apple juice (if desired) to a depth of about 1⁄2 inch.
 6 Bake uncovered for 1 hour, or until the apples are soft. Serve warm or chilled.

Pear Cranberry Crisp
This beautiful dish is sweet, tart, and totally satisfying. The cranberries add a festive 
color and flavor, so this dish works well as a simple but lovely dessert for holidays and 
other gatherings.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
Filling:
6 large, soft, ripe pears, peeled, cored, 
and sliced
11⁄2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
3⁄4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose, unbleached 
flour
Topping:
1 cup rolled oats
1⁄2 cup packed brown sugar
1⁄3 cup all-purpose, unbleached flour (or mix 
half and half with whole-wheat flour)
1⁄4 cup trans fat-free margarine
1⁄2 cup chopped pecans
 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Oil a 9-x-13-inch baking dish.
 2 In a large bowl, combine the pears, cranberries, sugar, and flour. Toss to coat the fruit. 
Spread the fruit over the bottom of the baking dish.
 3 In a small bowl, combine the oats, brown sugar, flour, and margarine. Using a fork or 
pastry blender, combine the ingredients until the mixture is crumbly and the margarine 
is well incorporated. Stir in the pecans.
 4 Sprinkle the topping evenly over the fruit and pat it down with your fingers.
 5 Bake for 40 minutes, or until the fruit is bubbly and the topping is browned. Serve warm 
or chilled.
Vary It! Use tart apples in place of the pears and walnuts in place of the pecans.

Mixed Berry Cobbler
I adapted this recipe from one of my favorite vegetarian cookbooks, The Peaceful Palate 
by Jennifer Raymond (Heart & Soul Publications). It’s delicious, easy to make, and much 
lower in fat than a berry pie. It’s one of the staple desserts at my house. You can use 
whatever type of berries you like, or a mixture of berries.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 9 servings
5 to 6 cups fresh or frozen berries 
(boysenberries, blackberries, blueberries, 
strawberries, raspberries, or a mixture)
3 tablespoons all-purpose, unbleached flour
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 cup all-purpose, unbleached flour (or mix 
half and half with whole-wheat flour)
11⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1⁄2 cup soymilk, rice milk, or nonfat cow’s milk
 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
 2 Spread the berries in a 9-x-9-inch baking dish. Mix in the flour and 1⁄2 cup of the sugar.
 3 In a separate bowl, mix the flour and the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar with the 
baking powder and salt.
 4 Add the oil to the flour mixture and mix it with a fork or your fingers until the mixture 
resembles coarse cornmeal.
 5 Add the soymilk, rice milk, or cow’s milk and stir to combine.
 6 Spread this mixture over the berries (don’t worry if they’re not completely covered) 
and bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Vary It! For a real treat, top the hot cobbler with a spoonful of nondairy or reduced-fat 
ice cream.

Other Classic Comforts
Rice pudding and oatmeal cookies are two of my favorite comfort foods. The 
recipes in this section are variations of two traditional recipes. These ver-
sions are healthful enough to eat every day.
 
Notice that the rice pudding recipe that follows calls for soymilk in place of 
the cow’s milk traditionally used in puddings and custards. Any nondairy milk 
alternative, including rice milk and almond milk — plain or vanilla — would 
work, though. Use whatever you have on hand. I like vanilla soymilk in this 
recipe because of its creaminess and the extra vanilla flavor it adds.
 
Rice Pudding
This rice pudding requires no eggs because it thickens in the pan as the rice absorbs 
the liquid in the recipe. The result is a rich, creamy rice pudding that’s simple to make 
and requires minimal time supervising the stovetop.
Preparation time: 5 minutes (plus time to chill, if desired)
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 cups vanilla soymilk
1⁄2 cup long-grain white rice
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon trans fat-free margarine
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1⁄4 cup sugar
 1 In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the soymilk to a boil, stirring constantly 
(about 5 minutes).
 2 Add the rice, salt, margarine, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar, and stir to combine. 
Reduce the heat to low and cover.
 3 Cook, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed. Lift the 
lid and stir every 15 minutes, covering again tightly each time you remove the lid.
 4 After all the liquid has been absorbed, remove the pudding from the heat. Cool to 
warm, and then serve or place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours before 
serving.

Celebrating the Holidays, 
Vegetarian-Style
In This Chapter
▶ Creating festive vegetarian meals
▶ Adapting old traditions
▶ Sampling special holiday recipes
H
olidays are made special by the family and 
friends we share them with and by the tra-
ditions that accompany those special days. Chief 
among those traditions is the food!
We associate certain foods with specific holidays. What’s the centerpiece of 
most Thanksgiving tables? The turkey, of course. That is, unless you’re a veg-
etarian, in which case you can make use of a variety of plants to round out 
your holiday meals.
The selection of recipes I include in this chapter underscores the diversity of 
the vegetable world. Meatless holiday meals are characterized by an abun-
dance of colorful, flavorful, and festive foods.
Adopting New Traditions 
and Adapting the Old
Food traditions vary, and some even change over time. Christmas dinner 
may mean antipasto and ravioli to one family and a tofu turkey with all the 
trimmings to another. It’s all a matter of what has become familiar to you and 
your family or friends over the years.
Many of the recipes in this book are well suited to special-occasion 
meals. They’re colorful and will fill your home with delicious aromas.

Some make use of seasonal foods that evoke a particular mood or time of 
year. Pear Cranberry Crisp, for instance (see Chapter 14), may bring late 
autumn and the winter holidays to mind.
 
If you’re new to a vegetarian diet and your traditions still center on foods of 
animal origin, don’t worry. Choose the aspects of special-occasion meals that 
still fit and find replacements for those that don’t.
For example, most of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner is already vegetarian. 
Mashed potatoes, candied sweet potatoes, green peas, cranberry sauce . . . 
these foods can stay on the menu. You can easily swap the turkey for 
Everybody’s Favorite Cheese and Nut Loaf, or Stuffed Squash (recipes for 
both are in this chapter), or any of a number of other main dishes.
 
To supplement your menu, add Whole-Wheat Crescent Rolls (Chapter 13), 
Arugula Salad with Pickled Beets and Candied Pecans (Chapter 11), and 
Stuffed Mushrooms or Roasted Garlic Spread (Chapter 10). Use your imagi-
nation and think about the foods that you enjoy most. Over time, these will 
become your new traditions, as dear to you as the old ones once were.
Tips for Entertaining 
for Special Occasions
When you peruse the recipes that follow, think about what makes holiday 
meals special for you. Do you eat in the dining room rather than the kitchen? 
Do you place candles or a centerpiece on the table? Do you cover the table 
with your best linen tablecloth and fine china? Maybe you play soft music in 
the background.
The atmosphere you create in the room where you eat and the manner with 
which you present the food set the tone for the meal and can set a meal apart 
from the everyday routine. You can serve the recipes in this chapter anytime, 
but if you reserve them for special occasions and serve them with flair, they 
say, “This meal is special!”
Holiday Recipes to Savor
Many vegetarians have traditions of their own that are linked with specific 
holidays. In my family of longtime vegetarians, we make Everybody’s Favorite 
Cheese and Nut Loaf at Thanksgiving, for Christmas Eve, and for some special 
events. The dish is so good that it’s become legendary among my extended 
circle of family and friends. Some of the nonvegetarians who sometimes join 
us for holiday meals have adopted the tradition for themselves.

                   Everybody’s Favorite 
 
                  Cheese and Nut Loaf
This savory dish is reminiscent of meatloaf in texture and has a nutty flavor. It’s festive 
if it’s presented on a platter garnished with parsley and cherry tomatoes. My family 
now makes two loaves to ensure we have enough for second helpings — leftovers are 
wonderful reheated or eaten cold in a sandwich.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped fine
1⁄2 cup water
11⁄2 cups whole-wheat breadcrumbs, 
plus extra for topping
2 cups grated, reduced-fat cheddar cheese 
(vegans may substitute nondairy cheese)
1 cup chopped walnuts
Juice of 1 fresh lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
6 egg whites (or vegetarian egg replacer 
equal to 3 eggs)
Parsley, bell pepper rings, and cherry tomato 
halves for garnish
 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
 2 In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Over medium heat, cook the onions in the olive oil 
until they’re translucent.
 3 Add the water and breadcrumbs and mix well. Remove from the heat.
 4 Add the cheese, walnuts, lemon juice, and egg whites and mix well.
 5 Scoop the mixture into a greased, 9-x-5-x-3-inch loaf pan or casserole dish. Top with a 
sprinkling of breadcrumbs.
 6 Bake for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
 7 Turn out onto a platter and garnish with parsley sprigs and cherry tomatoes, or slices 
of red and yellow bell peppers.
Vary It! Experiment with this recipe by replacing part of the walnuts with an equal amount 
of chopped water chestnuts, or a portion of the cheese with an equal portion of grated car-
rots. You can also serve this dish with 1⁄2 cup ketchup mixed with 1⁄2 cup salsa.

Stuffed Squash
Stuffed squash makes a festive main course for holiday meals and is a convenient and 
colorful centerpiece for the table. Any kind of squash will do, but acorn and butternut 
squash are the easiest to find in supermarkets. This recipe shows you how to make one 
large stuffed squash, enough for four ample servings (1⁄4 squash each). Double or triple 
the recipe as needed to make enough servings to feed the number of guests you expect. 
You can also use the filling to make several small (3 to 4 inch), individual stuffed pump-
kins if you prefer.
Preparation time: 1 hour (including time to prebake squash)
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 butternut squash, cut in half, seeds and strings 
removed (or use 2 small acorn squashes for 4 
individual servings — see Figure 15-1 for an 
illustration of both types of squash)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1⁄2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 clove garlic, minced
1⁄4 cup finely minced celery (leaves and stem)
1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1⁄2 teaspoon sage
1⁄2 teaspoon thyme
Juice of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
1⁄4 cup diced, peeled Granny Smith apple
1⁄4 cup chopped walnuts
1⁄4 cup golden raisins
3 slices whole-wheat bread, coarsely crumbled
3⁄4 cup grated, reduced-fat cheddar cheese (use 
nonfat cheese or a mix to lower the saturated fat 
content further; vegans may substitute nondairy 
cheese)
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Cut the squash in half. Scoop out and discard the seeds and strings.
 3 Place the squash halves in a small, oiled baking dish and fill the dish 1⁄2 inch high with 
water. Place the dish in the oven and bake, covered loosely with foil, for 30 minutes, or 
until the squash is tender but still firm (don’t let it cook so much that it falls apart when 
you move it later).

 4 While the squash is baking, heat the olive oil in a small skillet. Cook the onions, mush-
rooms, garlic, and celery in the oil until the onions are translucent. Stir in the black 
pepper, parsley, sage, thyme, and lemon juice and remove from the heat.
 5 Transfer the onion mixture to a mixing bowl. Add the apples, walnuts, raisins, bread, 
and cheese. Mix until well combined.
 6 If desired, remove the squash from the oven and transfer it, cut side up, to a decorative 
baking or casserole dish. Otherwise, carefully pour out the water in the pan. Fill each 
squash half with half the stuffing mixture and press down lightly.
 7 Cover tightly with foil and bake the squash for another 20 minutes, or until the cheese 
is melted and the stuffing is browned.

Fluffy Mashed Potatoes 
 
with Mushroom Gravy
Yukon Gold potatoes lend a rich color to this dish. The gravy goes well on the potatoes, 
as well as over Everybody’s Favorite Cheese and Nut Loaf (see the recipe earlier in this 
chapter).
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
Potatoes:
5 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 
2-inch chunks (or halved if they’re small)
1⁄4 cup melted trans fat-free margarine
1 cup plain soymilk or skim milk
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper
Mushroom Gravy:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoons flour
1 vegetable bouillon cube
1⁄4 teaspoon salt (if using a sodium-free bouillon 
cube; otherwise omit)
1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup plain soymilk or skim milk
 1 Place the potatoes in a pot and fill with cold water to cover them. Cover and cook over 
medium-high heat until boiling; then reduce the heat, tilt the cover to allow steam to 
escape, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
 2 While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the Mushroom Gravy. Heat the olive oil in a 
medium skillet. Over medium heat, cook the mushrooms and onions in the oil until the 
onions are translucent — about 5 minutes.
 3 Add the flour, and crumble the bouillon cube into the skillet. Add the salt (if needed) 
and pepper and stir.
 4 Add the soymilk. Cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, until the gravy thickens and the ingredi-
ents are well blended. Pour into a small pitcher or serving dish and set aside until the 
potatoes are ready. If you don’t serve it immediately, the gravy may need to be reheated 
in a microwave oven, or you can hold it on the stovetop, warming, until ready to eat.
 5 When the potatoes are done, drain them. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, marga-
rine, milk, salt, and pepper. Mash with a potato masher until smooth and well blended. 
Use a wooden spoon to help blend the ingredients if necessary. Transfer to a serving 
dish and serve with Mushroom Gravy.

Roasted Roots
Herbs and the roasting process bring out the delicious flavors of the root vegetables in 
this dish. Peel the vegetables before cutting them. The beets stain the other vegetables 
a rich red color.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 5 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
2 medium carrots, sliced into 1-inch pieces
1 medium turnip, sliced into 1-inch wedges
3 to 4 beets, quartered

1 medium onion, quartered
2 small leeks, split and washed
1 medium white potato, cut into eighths
1 medium sweet potato, cut into eighths
1 bulb fennel, quartered
1⁄3 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic (chopped or whole cloves)
Three 2-inch sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
5 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Toss the vegetables with the olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Set the fennel 
and leeks aside and arrange the remaining vegetables in one layer in an oiled roasting 
pan or on a greased cookie sheet. Do not cover.
 3 Roast the vegetables for 15 minutes, and then add the fennel and leeks. Roast all the 
vegetables for an additional 50 minutes, or until tender. Pay particular attention to the 
beets and make sure that they’re soft before removing them from the oven.
 4 Toss the vegetables with the balsamic vinegar and serve.

    Candied Sweet Potatoes
You can make this simple holiday classic healthier by substituting trans fat-free 
margarine for butter.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 12 to 14 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
8 medium sweet potatoes (about 3 pounds)
3⁄4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons trans fat-free margarine
Juice of a fresh lemon (optional)
 1 Wash the potatoes and cut them into 1⁄2-inch segments. Place them in a medium sauce-
pan, cover with water, and bring the water to a boil. Let the potatoes simmer until 
tender — about 12 to 14 minutes. Cook longer if necessary, but don’t let the potatoes 
get mushy.
 2 Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain. Add sugar and margarine, and stir gently 
with a large wooden spoon to coat the potatoes.
 3 Turn the potatoes into a serving bowl. Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the tops of 
the potatoes before serving (if desired).
Vary It! Substitute 1⁄3 cup maple syrup for the brown sugar. Add 1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger 
in Step 2. Another option: Add a handful of chopped pecans and/or 1⁄3 cup crushed pine-
apple in Step 2.

Living — and

Vegetarian 
Lifestyle

In this part . . .
Y
ou have the nuts and bolts behind you — an under-
standing of the various approaches to vegetarianism, 
sound reasons to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle, and the 
nutrition basics. You know how to begin, and you’ve got-
ten your kitchen ready. You may have tried fixing a few of 
the recipes in this book.
Now it’s time for some advanced advice for those of you 
who want to dig more deeply into making the transition to 
a vegetarian lifestyle complete.
In this part, I share strategies for keeping the peace in 
households where you may be the only vegetarian at the 
table, and I discuss how to deal with the nonvegetarians 
you encounter every day outside your home. I also offer 
advice for maintaining your vegetarian diet when you’re a 
guest at someone else’s home or when you eat out.

ome food fights are easy to settle. He likes chunky and she likes creamy? 
Keep two jars of peanut butter in the cupboard. Butter versus marga-

If only all differences in food preferences were so easy to handle.
If you’re a vegetarian, chances are good that you’re the only vegetarian in 
your household. Like May–December romances, partnerships between a 
steak-and-potatoes type and a veggie lover can present challenges. If you’re 
going vegetarian alone at home, you, your partner, and other immediate 
family members have to address several issues. Some will be unique to your 
living situation, but other problems are common in many people’s experi-
ences. An awareness of the issues and the manner in which you approach 
them can have a significant effect on your relationships.
Managing Family Meals
Should you fix a standard meat-two-vegetables-a-starch-and-a-salad meal, 
dodge the meat, and fill up on the rest? Or do you fix a separate vegetarian 
entrée for yourself?

230
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Some families feel burdened by this problem. Nobody wants to get stuck 
cooking two meals for the same table every night. Should all meals be veg-
etarian, so that everyone can eat them? After all, most nonvegetarians enjoy 
many meatless dishes.
I don’t have all the answers. The situation requires discussion and negotia-
tion among all parties concerned. Unless you face it head on, though, it will 
bite you from behind.
Thinking through some of the options may help.
Fixing both meat and vegetarian foods
Serving both a meat entrée and a vegetarian alternative is the most obvious 
solution to the problem of preparing meals that everyone can eat. It’s also 
the most work. For vegetarians who happen to be the family cook, it may also 
be out of the question if they don’t want to handle and cook meat.
Deciding who prepares what
If you’re the head cook in your household and you’re a vegetarian, should 
 you be expected to fix meat for the nonvegetarians? Maybe it’s time for a 
nonvegetarian family member to learn how to cook meat. Another option: 
Prepare meals together. You can be in charge of everything but the meat.
On the other hand, maybe you don’t want to subject yourself to the smell 
of cooking meat, or you don’t want meat to touch your kitchen counter or 
pots and pans. I can relate to that point of view, but you’ll have to hash this 
one out with your family. It may help to know that you’re not alone — lots of 
people like you are out there.
If your household has meat-eaters, sit down and try to work out compro-
mises that everyone can live with. Some options include the following:
 
✓ You may agree that any meat brought into the house is prepared on 
waxed paper so that it doesn’t touch the countertops, and that it’s 
cooked in a pan dedicated solely to meat.
 
✓ You may decide to cook meats outdoors on a grill to keep offending 
odors and drippings out of the house.
 
✓ You may choose to buy only precooked meats such as deli or luncheon 
meats, which can be kept wrapped in the refrigerator and need no cook-
ing or further preparation in the house.

231
 Chapter 16: Getting Along When You’re the Only Vegetarian in the House
 
If you’re having difficulty negotiating meal issues with family members, it may 
help to talk to other vegetarians who’ve dealt with the same challenge. Consider 
joining a vegetarian chat group on the Internet, participating in a blog, or joining 
a local vegetarian society. The Vegetarian Resource Group maintains a list of 
these and other resources online at www.vrg.org/links/.
Respecting others’ food preferences
What you eat is a highly personal decision. I’ve found over the years that it’s 
best to let friends and family members make their own food choices without 
pressure from me — a strategy you may want to consider as well.
For a while, you may have to live with two variations at every meal. However, 
fixing both vegetarian and nonvegetarian options for family meals has its 
advantages. As any experienced vegetarian knows, the vegetarian option 
tends to look really tasty. Try setting a vegetarian pizza on the table with 
other pizzas at a party or any gathering. If you’re a vegetarian, claim a slice 
quickly, because the nonvegetarians often want the vegetarian choice. If 
you’re not quick enough, you may find your vegetarian option is gone.
Likewise, put a bowl of pasta topped with marinara sauce on the table side 
by side with pasta and meat sauce. Conduct a bit of research, and see which 
bowl empties fastest. I’ll put my money on the marinara — I’ve seen it happen 
too many times.
So the idea is that if you set out vegetarian entrées, nonvegetarians are going 
to want them, too. Eventually, you may be making nothing but vegetarian 
meals, and the other people in  your household may not even notice the tran-
sition. And all that arguing and teeth gnashing will have been for nothing.
Making do when you need to
Instead of fixing two meals, another option is for the   vegetarian to eat large 
servings of whatever meatless foods are on the table. Mashed potatoes, 
steamed broccoli, salad, and a dinner roll make a great meal. You don’t have 
to have a hole on your plate where the meat should be — you can cover up 
that bare spot with extra servings of the foods you like.
Many vegetarians use this same approach when they eat out at the homes 
of friends or others who don’t serve vegetarian meals. They eat what they 
can of the available meatless foods. They don’t draw attention to themselves 
(some vegetarians prefer it that way), and they don’t give others the impres-
sion that it’s hard to be a vegetarian by whining about not having an entrée.

232
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
This approach is passive and fairly nonconfrontational. Problems are most 
likely to arise if another family member is threatened by the fact that you’re 
behaving outside the norm of the family. For some, it may appear that you’re 
rejecting family values and traditions. You’re not, of course — you’re just 
 changing them.
Finding the vegetarian least 
common denominator
Another sensible strategy is to consider vegetarian foods   to be the least 
common denominator. In other words, everyone — vegetarians and non-
vegetarians alike — can eat vegetarian foods, so when you plan meals, start 
with vegetarian choices. Choose foods that are vegetarian as prepared but to 
which a nonvegetarian can add meat if he so chooses.
For example, make a stir-fry using assorted vegetables, and serve it on 
steamed rice. A nonvegetarian can cook chicken, shrimp, pork, or beef sepa-
rately and add it to her own dish. Rather than actually making two different 
entrées, you’re modifying an entrée for a meat-eater. That should be consid-
erably easier than fixing two distinct dishes.
The following foods are vegetarian, and meat-eaters can add small bits of 
meat if they so desire:
 
✓ Bean burritos, nachos, or tacos
 
✓ Italian stuffed shells, manicotti, cannelloni, or spaghetti with marinara 
sauce
 
✓ Mixed green salad (large dinner-style)
 
✓ Pasta primavera
 
✓ Pesto pasta
 
✓ Vegetable jambalaya
 
✓  Vegetable lasagna with marinara sauce
 
✓ Vegetable soup or stew
 
✓ Vegetable stir-fry 
 
✓ Vegetarian chili
 
✓ Vegetarian pizza

 Chapter 16: Getting Along When You’re the Only Vegetarian in the House
Gaining Support from Nonvegetarians
When it comes to handling family meals, several options that have worked 
for others may work for you, too. Because every family is different, though, 
you may have to adapt these ideas to fit your own circumstances.
For starters, take some simple steps (which I outline in this section) to make 
the other members of your household more receptive to vegetarian meals. 
Remember that you’re asking them to trade in some of their favorite foods.
What would it take for you to give up something that you like and are com-
fortable with? You’d probably want a substitute that tastes as good as or 
better than the food you gave up. You wouldn’t want to be inconvenienced. 
And you wouldn’t want the change to leave you feeling dissatisfied.
Keep these points in mind when you ask for your family’s support.
Employing strategies for compromise
If your family is agreeable, you may be able to get away with fixing nothing 
but vegetarian meals, provided that everyone likes the choices. Whether you 
go vegetarian all the time or part of the time, it’s a good   idea to go out of your 
way to make foods that everyone likes.
 
Begin by making a list of family members’ favorite foods that just happen to be 
vegetarian. For instance,   your list may include veggie-topped pizza, bean soup 
and chili, stuffed baked potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and pasta primavera.
To that list, add some transition foods — foods that look and taste like famil-
iar meat-based foods — that appeal to most people. These alternatives taste 
good, and you can use them in the same ways as their meat counterparts. Let 
them serve as crutches or training wheels until people become more com-
fortable planning meals without meat. Examples include vegetarian burger 
patties and hot dogs, vegetarian cold cuts for sandwiches, vegetarian bacon 
and sausage links and patties, and frozen, crumbled, textured vegetable pro-
tein for recipes that call for ground beef.
 
Let family members  have input into planning, and incorporate their prefer-
ences into the menu. People who are involved in any aspect of meal planning 
are more likely to be interested in eating the food. Before long, you’ll have a 
list of family favorites a mile long.

234
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Setting a positive example
Don’t push. It’s that simple. When you preach to people   and push them to do 
something they aren’t ready to do — like change the way they eat — you’re 
likely to get the opposite of the result you want.
 
Instead, teach by your own example. If your family or partner isn’t ready 
to make a switch to a vegetarian diet, quietly go about it by yourself. Your 
actions will make an impression, and chances are good that, given time, the 
others will notice, get interested, and make some dietary changes of their own.
I know this from experience. I grew up in Michigan in a typical, traditional, 
meat-and-potatoes household. One day, just as my family was sitting down to 
dinner, my mother briefly announced that from that day forward she would 
be a vegetarian. She didn’t say another word about it. No explanation   except, 
“This is what I’ve decided is right for me.” She sat down, and we ate our 
dinner.
My mother didn’t discuss her vegetarianism with anyone. With the excep-
tion of her family and close friends, most people didn’t even realize that she 
didn’t eat meat. At family meals, she continued to prepare meat for my father 
and siblings, but she would make a cheese omelet or  toasted cheese sand-
wich for herself (a Wisconsin native, she was stuck in the cheese-and-eggs 
rut!) and eat the same salad and vegetables that the rest of us ate.
Time went by. Then, one by one, my sisters and brother and I quietly went 
vegetarian ourselves. Nobody offered more of an  explanation than to say to 
our mother, “You don’t have to fix meat for me anymore.” Eventually, the 
only person my mother was fixing meat for was my father. Many years later, 
meat faded out of his diet, too. Decades later, we’re still   vegetarians.
This process repeated itself when I met my husband, a barbecue-eating, 
native North Carolinian. Within a couple of years and without a word from 
me, he began to eat less meat. Pretty soon, he began referring to himself as 
a vegetarian. Now, after ten years on a meat-free diet, he’s a pro. He’s 6 feet 
3 inches tall and weighs more than 200 pounds, and people are surprised to 
learn that such a big guy doesn’t eat meat. But the greens and beans he takes 
to work for lunch draw comments from colleagues (“You win the prize for 
the best-smelling food”), and he’s healthier and trimmer than he has been in 
years.
The only reasonable alternative if you want others to change is to let them 
decide for themselves.

235
 Chapter 16: Getting Along When You’re the Only Vegetarian in the House
Negotiating the Menu 
When Guests Come
In addition to  working out a family meals plan that promotes harmony, you 
may want to discuss how to handle such events as guests staying at your 
house and friends dropping in for dinner.
For some people, this kind of situation can cause friction, particularly when 
the lifestyle of the vegetarian in the household is seen as an intrusion or 
unwelcome deviation from the norm. Having outsiders come in can cause 
built-up tensions to flare. The meat-eater’s point of view may be that if eating 
meat is the norm of the guests, the preferences of the majority should rule.
In other circles, vegetarianism may be no big deal. In fact, some of your 
guests may well be vegetarians.
 
If you live with someone who doesn’t support your diet choice, it’s a good idea 
to get the issue on the table and resolved before your guests arrive. You may 
decide to eat out, or you may opt to bring takeout food home. However you 
solve the dilemma, the important   thing is to anticipate the problem and try to 
find a solution ahead of time.
Then enjoy the visit.
Giving your guests options
Many people are comfortable having some vegetarian dishes and some meat 
dishes available, with everyone free to choose what she pleases. This works 
well when the household already has a custom of serving two entrées — one 
meat-based and one meatless.
But nonvegetarians will often have a helping of the meatless choice. You 
want the nonvegetarians to have the option of tasting that delicious-looking 
vegetarian entrée if they care to, but you also want to ensure that enough 
is left for the vegetarians. So when you invite guests to come to your home, 
ask whether anyone has special dietary needs. Do your best to estimate the 
number of people who may be interested in the vegetarian option — and 
then double that amount.
I once spent several days on a small boat on the Great Barrier Reef on a 
scuba diving trip. I was one of two vegetarians in a group of about 15 divers 
and crew. For our first meal — spaghetti — the cook set aside a small amount 

236
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
of pasta with meatless sauce for me and the other vegetarian on board. She 
labeled it as meatless and set it out on the serving table alongside the larger 
bowl of pasta with meat sauce.
I made the mistake of being near the end of the serving line. By the time I got 
to the head of the line, the vegetarian spaghetti was gone. From that day for-
ward, the two vegetarians were permitted to go through the serving line first.
And I made an important realization — the vegetarian option often appeals to 
everyone, vegetarian or not.
Serving meals with mainstream appeal
One easy way to handle meals for guests is to rely on old standbys — such as 
vegetable lasagna or pasta primavera — that are familiar to both vegetarians 
and nonvegetarians alike. Serve either with a loaf of good bread and a beauti-
ful mixed green salad or a bowl of minestrone soup, and finish the meal with 
coffee and a delectable dessert.
Nobody will notice the meat was missing.
Minimizing the focus on meat-free
Another strategy to redirect guests’ attention away from the fact that they’re 
eating a meatless meal is to knock their socks off with a delicious, sophisti-
cated, gourmet vegetarian meal, or an ethnic entrée such as an Indian curry 
dish or a Middle Eastern spinach pie. Many guests would be impressed and 
also enjoy the change of pace.
Don’t forget about the importance of setting the mood, too. Dim the lights 
and put on some soft music. Set an attractive table. Use a tablecloth or place-
mats. Place a vase with a sprig of foliage or flowers from the yard on the 
table. Arrange foods in serving bowls or plates using parsley and sliced fruit 
as garnishes.
 
Emphasize the experience of enjoying good food with good company. The fact 
that there’s no meat on the table will be irrelevant.

M
aintaining a vegetarian lifestyle at home is one thing. Doing it away 
from home with style and grace is quite another thing.
You owe no one an explanation of  your eating preferences. Keep in mind, 
though, that despite the fact that vegetarianism has become more main-
stream in recent years, the vast majority of people still eat meat. You’ll likely 
stand out, especially if you eat a vegan diet. For that reason, you’re the one 
who has to do most of the adapting in social situations.
This chapter focuses on common situations for which you need to develop 
skills to relate with nonvegetarians. You’ll become more comfortable manag-
ing these situations as you gain experience.
Mastering the Art of Diplomacy
You may be quite content  to live a vegetarian lifestyle without explaining 
your choice to people or attempting to convert them. If so, you’re probably 
the type who doesn’t rub people the wrong way. You’re an undercover veg-
etarian, not a walking-and-talking advocate, and that’s fine. Even in your rela-
tive silence, you’re making a statement.

238
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
On the other hand, if you frequently find yourself engaged in debates or ear-
nest discussions about the merits of a vegetarian diet — whether you initiate 
the conversations or not — you should give some thought to your approach 
in handling these interactions.
 
Diplomacy is key, whether you prefer to do your own thing quietly or hope 
to inspire others to go vegetarian. You’re going to need skills in dealing with 
social situations in which your vegetarian lifestyle converges with the nonveg-
etarian world. That takes time and experience. To help you get started, con-
sider some of the ideas I share in this section.
Watching how you present yourself
Maybe you’ve seen the features on fashion do’s and don’ts in women’s 
magazines — photos of people whose looks are perfectly and tastefully coor-
dinated next to photos of people with visible panty lines and other fashion 
gaffes. Your physical appearance can give people the impression that you 
have it all together or that you’re a frazzled wreck.
Similarly, the manner in which you conduct yourself in the presence of 
others affects the way they perceive you. If you’re belligerent, bossy, or 
brash, you come off as being uncouth. Even if your point of view is valid, 
others are likely to discount your message at best, or be totally repulsed and 
reject it outright at worst.
 
Bumper stickers, buttons, and shirts with vegetarian slogans can express your 
politics loudly and clearly. One makes a statement. Two emphasize the point. 
But when your car and body are blanketed with these items, you’re shouting. 
Some people may perceive you to be hysterical, depending on the degree of 
coverage of your car and clothing. Consider that you may reach a point of 
diminishing returns in terms of the extent to which people will listen to you 
when you express   your views this way.
Activism done right
Some people  feel that the in-your-face 
approach has a place. Opinions are neither 
right nor wrong, of course. The bra burners 
of the 1960s drew attention to women’s rights 
issues with their very visible demonstrations 
of activism, and other women advocated for 
change in subtler ways. Likewise, a peace 
activist may wage a hunger strike to draw 
attention to the cause, while others promote 
peace behind the scenes. Ultimately, it’s up 
to you whether — and how — you advocate 
for vegetarianism. Attacking others, however, 
is a negative approach that’s likely to alienate 
people and make them less receptive to your 
message.

 Chapter 17: Vegetarian Etiquette in a Nonvegetarian World
Responding to questions about 
your vegetarianism
“Why did you become a vegetarian?”
Most vegetarians   have heard that question at least 25 times.
“If you don’t eat meat, how do you get enough protein?”
They’ve heard that one just as many times.
“What do you eat for dinner?”
“Don’t you just want a good steak once in a while?”
“If you’re a vegetarian, why do you wear leather shoes?”
When someone inquires about your vegetarianism, the best response is a 
simple, straightforward answer. You don’t have to expound   on the basics — 
just the facts will do. This is generally also not the time for the hard sell, nor 
is it the time to push someone else’s buttons by criticizing his lifestyle.
You need to use your own judgment, but most of the time when people ask 
questions such as these, they’re just exploring. They may not know much 
about vegetarianism, but you’ve piqued their interest. They may also be test-
ing to determine what you’re all about. Answer their questions concisely, but 
leave ’em wanting more. They’ll ask when they want to know — and they may 
start asking you how   they can become vegetarians themselves.
Being an effective role model
The world would be a  better place if more people were vegetarians. Those of 
us who’ve already made the switch know how nice it can be to live a vegetar-
ian lifestyle. A vegetarian lifestyle is good for you, good for the animals, and 
good for the environment and planet.
 
As much as possible, try to be positive in the way you interact with others where 
food is concerned. Your attitude affects how people feel about you, and people 
will associate that feeling with how they feel about the concept of vegetarianism.
The truth is, being a vegetarian isn’t particularly difficult, and vegetarianism 
has many benefits. Why not advertise that fact? Some vegetarians present 
themselves in a way that makes it appear that living a vegetarian lifestyle is 
difficult and problematic. Instead, aim to show people how easy and pleasur-
able a vegetarian lifestyle can be. Take the positive tack if you want other 
people to give vegetarianism serious consideration.

Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Filling your plate to show vegetarian variety
Show people that eating a vegetarian  diet doesn’t mean you have to go 
hungry when you eat meals away from home. Fill your plate with food. Let 
people see how colorful and appealing a meal without meat can be. Don’t 
leave a hole  on your plate or allow it to look empty, as if you’re deprived.
Demonstrating flexibility in difficult situations
All vegetarians  get stuck at a truck stop or a fast food restaurant occasion-
ally, where the menu has nothing for them to eat. Those are the times when 
you kick into survival mode and take a can of juice, a side order of slaw, and 
a bag of chips and just hang on until the next opportunity to eat some real 
food.
Most of the time, though, vegetarians have plenty of food choices, or they 
can make do with what there is. Whether you’re a guest at someone’s home, 
eating out on business, traveling, or out with friends, try to be flexible when 
it comes to your meals. By being flexible, you show others that you can be 
a vegetarian in a nonvegetarian society without your lifestyle creating too 
much conflict. Send a positive message.
 
Flexibility and planning are especially important  for vegans. Vegans do find it 
more difficult than other types of vegetarians to eat away from home, espe-
cially when they’re in the company of nonvegetarians or nonvegans   and don’t 
have total control over where a group goes to eat.
I was once with a group of people, including two vegans, at a conference 
in Kansas City. When it came time to find a place to have dinner the first 
night, we literally roamed the streets for over an hour, wearily walking into 
one restaurant after another, reading the menus, finding few vegan options, 
and walking out again. Eventually, after everyone was frustrated and overly 
hungry, we settled on a Chinese restaurant. We ended up eating there every 
night thereafter for the rest of that week. The impression I was left with was 
that it was no fun at all to be a vegan, and that it was tiresome   and difficult to 
find something to eat away from home.
 
In a mixed group of vegetarians  and nonvegetarians, or vegans and nonvegans, 
try to anticipate the limitations and preempt them. Steer your party to a res-
taurant at which you’ll be most likely to have numerous choices. If you can’t 
do that, do your best to make do wherever you land.
Some vegetarians eat a vegan diet at home but occasionally make excep-
tions and eat foods containing dairy and/or eggs when they’re away and have 
limited choices. The reason? They prefer not to isolate themselves socially 
from nonvegans. They feel that by being 90 percent of the way there, they’re 
achieving most of the benefits of a vegan lifestyle without sending others a 
negative message.

241
 Chapter 17: Vegetarian Etiquette in a Nonvegetarian World
 
When you’re setting an example for others, inspiring lots of people to drasti-
cally reduce their intake of animal products may be more important than 
 inspiring one or two to go vegan.
Reconciling your approach and withholding judgment
Just as your decision to live a vegetarian lifestyle is a personal one, the 
manner in which you interact with people is also your call. You can be toler-
ant or intolerant, compassionate or confrontational.
Your approach may be different from someone else’s. A concession on the 
part of one near-vegan to eat a food containing dairy or eggs when away from 
home may be completely unacceptable to another vegan, just as someone’s 
decision to eat a piece of turkey on Thanksgiving may be an abhorrent choice 
to other vegetarians.
 
In understanding others’ choices, remember how complicated and deeply 
personal the subject of vegetarianism can be for everyone. Reconcile your 
approach as you see fit. Then work at projecting a positive image. Show others 
that you’re confident, content, and at ease with your lifestyle.
Handling Dinner Invitations
Being invited to a nonvegetarian’s home for dinner is one of the most 
 common and most stressful events that many vegetarians encounter. How 
you approach the situation depends on the degree of formality of the occa-
sion and how well you know your host.
 
If you’re a dinner guest at a nonvegetarian’s home, carrying on about the evils 
of meat is a major faux pas. Even if another guest eggs you on and attempts 
to engage you in an earnest discussion or debate about the merits of veg-
etarianism, resist the temptation to participate. To do otherwise is just plain 
uncouth.
Letting your host know about your diet
You’re a vegetarian. Out with it.
You need to find the right moment to tell  your host that you’re a vegetar-
ian, but do say something right away. If the invitation comes by phone or in 
person, the best time to say something is when you get the invitation.

242
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Say something as simple as, “Oh, thanks, I’d love to come. By the way, I’d 
better tell you that I’m a vegetarian. You don’t have to do anything special for 
me — I’m sure I’ll find plenty to eat — but I just didn’t want you to go to the 
trouble of fixing meat or fish for me.”
The chances are good that your host will ask whether you eat spaghetti, lasa-
gna, or some other dish that she’s familiar with serving and thinks will suit 
your preferences. If your host suggests a shrimp stir-fry, you can also nip that 
one in the bud by letting her know that you don’t eat seafood (if you don’t). 
In that case, you may want to toss out a few more suggestions of foods you 
do eat, or you could reassure your host that you’ll be fine with extra servings 
of whatever vegetables, rice, potatoes, salad, and other side dishes she plans 
to serve.
If you get an invitation to dinner by mail, through a spouse or partner, or in 
some other indirect way, you  have two choices:
 
✓ Show up for dinner and eat what you can.
 
✓ Call your host, thank her for the invitation, and mention that you’re a 
vegetarian.
If you’re invited as the guest of the invitee (your spouse, partner, date, and 
so on), you may want that person to call the host on your behalf. Examine the 
situation and do what feels most appropriate and comfortable.
 
Initiating a conversation about your vegetarianism may feel a bit awkward, 
but telling your host upfront that you’re a vegetarian may be less uncomfort-
able than showing up for dinner and finding nothing you can eat, or discover-
ing that the host made something special for you that you have to decline. In 
either of these situations, not only do you run the risk of not getting enough 
to eat, but you also risk disappointing your host, or causing her to puzzle over 
why you aren’t eating what she served.
Some   people may get a little nervous when you say that you’re a vegetarian. 
Most people who invite guests to dinner want them to enjoy the food and 
have a good time, and they may not be very familiar with what a vegetarian 
will and won’t eat.
Reassure your host that you’ll be fine. Most people appreciate knowing 
ahead of time that you won’t be eating the meat or fish, as it saves them from 
preparing something that won’t be eaten. It also saves everyone the embar-
rassment of scurrying to find something for you to eat.
It also saves you from being stuck in a situation where the rice is cooked 
with chicken stock, the salad is sprinkled with bacon, the appetizer is shrimp 
cocktail, and steak is the main course. You can be a bit conspicuous if all you 
have on your plate is a dinner roll.

243
 Chapter 17: Vegetarian Etiquette in a Nonvegetarian World
 
If you think you may have trouble finding something you can eat at your host’s 
house, have a snack before you leave home. That way, you won’t be starving if 
you discover that  there isn’t much to eat.
Offering to bring a dish
Another way to handle dinner invitations is  to offer to bring a dish that you 
and everyone else can share. This works best in casual situations when you 
know your host well or the setting is relatively informal. You may not feel as 
comfortable suggesting this, for instance, if you’re invited to a formal com-
pany function at the home of someone with whom you don’t interact regu-
larly. In that case, bringing your own food could look tacky.
Offer, but don’t push. If you tell your host that you’re a vegetarian and he 
sounds worried or unsure about how to handle it, you might say something 
like this:
“If you’d like, I’d be happy to make my famous vegetable paella and saf-
fron rice for everyone to try. It often complements other entrées, and a 
salad and bread would go well with it.”
If your host bites, great. If he brushes the suggestion aside, just consider 
your job done and leave it at that. Reassure him that you think you’ll be fine 
eating the salad and side dishes that don’t contain meat or seafood and that 
you’re looking forward to coming.
Graciously declining nonvegetarian foods
Sometimes you tell your host you’re a vegetarian, and she tries to fix a spe-
cial vegetarian meal for you but “misses.” For example, she may prepare a 
gelatin mold salad, use eggs in the baked goods, put bacon on the salad, or 
serve the salad with Caesar dressing (it contains anchovies). What should 
you do?
 
Be the best actor that you can be and just eat whatever you can   of the other 
parts of the meal. Make your plate look as full as you can so your host doesn’t 
feel as though you don’t have enough to eat. Assure her that you’re fine. Enjoy 
the company, and eat when you get home.
If you can’t finesse a refusal without your host detecting it, go ahead and fess 
up. Explain as gently and simply as possible that you prefer to pass up the 
dish and why. You might acknowledge that many people are surprised to dis-
cover that vegetarians don’t eat gelatin (or lard, or beef broth, for example). 
Be sure to thank your host for her efforts and reassure her that you have 
plenty to eat.

244
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Being a stealth vegetarian: What to do if 
your host doesn’t know
If you decide for whatever reason not  to tell your host in advance that you’re 
vegetarian, downplay the fact during the meal or stay undercover. Pointing 
out that you can’t eat the food will make everyone uncomfortable and may 
put a damper on the gathering. Your host may feel badly and may even ask 
why you didn’t say something sooner.
Eat what you can. If you have to ask about ingredients in the food or can’t 
eat something because it’s not vegetarian, be sure to play down any inconve-
nience. Reassure your host that you’ll be just fine with what there is.
Managing Invitations to Parties 
and Other Special Events
It’s fairly easy to manage invitations to weddings, banquets, and other func-
tions with lots of people where the food is served from a buffet line. Even if 
a sit-down meal is served, a hotel or restaurant usually caters the food. You 
may find it much easier to speak to hotel or restaurant staff about getting a 
vegetarian meal than to ask the host directly.
Handling parties at private homes
If the function happens to be held at a private residence, follow the advice I 
give earlier in this chapter for dinner invitations. If the occasion involves a 
large number of guests, lots of food will likely be served and your host won’t 
have to do anything special for you.
Making your way through public venues
If the event is at a hotel, country club, community center,   or restaurant, call 
ahead and ask to speak with the person in charge of food service. You don’t 
have to say anything to your host. It’s perfectly fine to speak to the chef or 
caterer and request a vegetarian or vegan entrée as a substitute for whatever 
the other guests are served. Most places will provide an alternate dish at no 
extra charge, but if you’re worried, you can ask to be sure.

245
 Chapter 17: Vegetarian Etiquette in a Nonvegetarian World
Be clear about what you can and can’t eat. For example, if you eat no meat, 
fish, or poultry, say so. Otherwise, you may end up with fish or chicken, 
because vegetarian only means “no red meat” to some people. You might 
also ask about how the chef will prepare other items. For instance, if Caesar 
salad is on the menu, see whether a different type of dressing or salad can be 
set aside for you (and remind the kitchen that you don’t eat bacon on your 
salad).
 
When talking with a member of the food service staff, be sure to mention 
whether you eat dairy products or eggs. If you aren’t explicit and you’re 
vegan, you may end up with egg pasta, an omelet or a quiche, grated cheese 
on your salad, or cheese lasagna.
 
If you call the restaurant or hotel kitchen to request a vegetarian meal for 
an event, feel free to suggest a dish that you know you can eat and that the 
kitchen is likely to be able to make. For example, most kitchens have the ingre-
dients on hand to make pasta primavera or a large baked potato topped with 
steamed vegetables. Those foods are simple to fix, and they can be preferable 
to that ubiquitous steamed vegetable plate.
As service begins and the waiter arrives at your table, quietly mention that 
you’ve ordered a vegetarian meal. If a plate containing meat lands at your 
place before you can say a word, let the food sit there until you can flag the 
waiter down to request your vegetarian meal.
If the meal is a buffet, you may not even need to mention to your host that 
you’re a vegetarian, unless you think the menu may be limited. If the buffet 
is at a restaurant or hotel, it will likely include a wide variety of dishes and 
plenty of foods you can eat.
 
If you’re vegan, however, it may still be wise to phone ahead and ask about 
the menu, just to be certain that it will have dairy- and egg-free choices. You 
may have to request that some rice, pasta, or vegetables are set aside for you 
if everything on the buffet line is doused with butter or cream sauce. The chef 
may even be able to make you a separate, suitable dish.
Dating Nonvegetarians
If your date is also a vegetarian, you’re off to a good start. All you have   to 
worry about (food-wise, anyway) is whether you’re in the mood for Mexican 
or Thai or Ethiopian food. Even if you’re a lacto ovo vegetarian and he’s 
vegan, at least you’re simpatico — you’ll work it out.

246
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
On the other hand, if your date isn’t a vegetarian, broach the subject early 
on. You don’t have to make a big deal of the fact that you don’t eat meat, but 
it’s probably best to mention that fact sooner rather than later, and probably 
before you get together for a meal.
 
If you think the relationship has the potential to become serious, ask yourself 
the following:
 
✓ Do I expect this person to stop eating meat eventually?
 
✓ What would the ground rules be if we decided to live together or get 
married?
 
✓ Would I be willing to have meat in the house?
 
✓ Would we cook two different meals or fend for ourselves?
 
✓ What would we do if nonvegetarian guests came over for dinner — serve 
them meat or not? How would we resolve the conflict if we had different 
views about what to do?
 
✓ Can I live and let live, or would I want my partner to see things as I do 
and maintain a vegetarian lifestyle?
This last question is especially important  if your vegetarianism is rooted in 
ethical beliefs or attitudes. Compromising is difficult to do when your per-
sonal philosophy is on the line. You have to decide whether your life has 
room for someone who lives differently.
Some vegetarians find it harder to connect with a partner who doesn’t share 
the same sensitivities. If it doesn’t matter now, it may later. You don’t have 
to arrive at any hard-and-fast conclusions about these issues today, but if 
you’ve never faced them before, it’s a good idea to begin thinking about 
them.
If you do decide to get serious with a nonvegetarian, be sure to think about 
how to make the relationship work over the long run. If you want children, 
talk about whether you’d raise them as vegetarians.
Some vegetarians won’t even date a nonvegetarian. (Kiss someone with 
greasy cheeseburger lips? No way!) Would you? If you restrict yourself to 
dating only fellow vegetarians, you may spend many a Saturday night alone in 
front of the TV. After all, vegetarians make up only a few percent of the popu-
lation, and only a fraction  of that number is in the market for dating.
 
Vegetarian singles groups are active  in some cities. Check with your local veg-
etarian society to see whether such a group exists in your area. These groups 
plan restaurant outings, outdoor activities, and other events with the needs 
and interests of singles in mind.

Working It Out: Vegetarianism 
on the Job
In many professions, your success at the office is partly dependent on how 
well you  blend into the organization’s culture. If your job involves entertain-
ing clients or meeting with colleagues over lunches and dinners, your eating 
habits will be on display for all to observe.
If you’re a vegetarian, the manner in which you conduct yourself can lead 
others to mark you as either sensible and health-conscious or eccentric and 
difficult to get along with. Your vegetarianism may be an asset or a liability, 
depending on how you play it.
To tell or not to tell?
Your dietary preferences may matter more in some work settings than in 
others. An advertising agency or a marketing department within a company, 
for instance, is likely to be comfortable with creative people who do things 
differently.
On the other hand, if you’re in a more conservative line of work such as 
law or banking — especially in rural areas where vegetarianism may be less 
prevalent — it may be more important for you to appear compatible with 
your peers. Attitudes about vegetarianism have changed considerably in 
recent years, but some people are still likely to be less receptive to your life-
style than others.
Why should you care about what your co-workers think of your eating 
habits?
You should care, because in some settings, the perception that you’re a 
social outlier may negatively affect your chances of getting a promotion or a 
choice job opportunity. If you play your cards right, however, you can turn 
the difference in your lifestyle into an asset that will reflect positively on you 
and enhance the company’s and clients’ impressions of you.
 
To increase your likelihood of success, don’t preach about the benefits of 
being a vegetarian. With your actions as a model, you can communicate an 
understated message to your co-workers that they’ll get loud and clear. Show 
them that you care about your health, that you’re socially and environmen-
tally conscious, and that you have the self-discipline and determination to   per-
severe with healthy lifestyle habits.

Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Handling meals during job interviews
Job interviews often involve  lunching with your prospective employer and 
colleagues. If that happens, you don’t need to hide the fact that you’re a 
vegetarian. At the same time, you don’t need to make a big deal of it. Just 
approach the subject in a confident, matter-of-fact way. Remember the 
following:
 
✓ First impressions count. In job interviews, you want your prospective 
employer and colleagues to focus on your skills and ideas, not on the 
fact that you don’t eat meat. When they reflect back on their meeting 
with you, you want them to think about how well you’ll fit into their envi-
ronment and how your unique set of abilities will be an asset to their 
organization.
 
✓ When you’re on a job interview, the people interviewing you often 
choose the restaurant where you’ll eat. As a result, you may not have 
an opportunity to steer them to a restaurant with lots of vegetarian 
choices.
 
 If that happens, size up your menu options as quickly as possible, and 
downplay inconveniences due to your diet. It’s fine to ask the waiter 
whether the soup is made with chicken stock or a beef base, or if the 
beans contain lard. But if you do, make it as low-key as you can. If the 
answer is affirmative, have an alternative choice in mind so that you 
don’t   hold up the table’s order while you struggle to find another dish.
 
✓ Have an off-menu choice in mind, in case you have trouble finding some-
thing on the menu. In a restaurant that serves pasta, for example, it’s usu-
ally easy for the kitchen to whip up pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, and 
vegetables, or pasta served with a marinara sauce. If you find yourself at a 
steakhouse, go for a baked potato, salad, and vegetable side dishes.
You may find yourself at a job interview being served a catered luncheon in 
a conference room. If you’re served a preplated ham sandwich, eat what you 
can from your plate and leave the rest. No explanation is necessary unless 
someone asks why you’ve left the food. In that case, all you have to say is, “I 
don’t eat ham.” Reassure your host that you’re okay. The key is not to make a 
big deal out of the fact that they served you meat and you aren’t eating it.
Leaving a positive impression
The best way to handle your dietary di fference is to present  yourself with 
confidence and in a matter-of-fact way. Let your co-workers view you as being 
sensible and health conscious, virtues that would reflect upon you positively 
in most business settings.

249
 Chapter 17: Vegetarian Etiquette in a Nonvegetarian World
Just keep it low-key. After all, if one of your co-workers had values that didn’t 
suit you, would you want to hear about it every day?
 
Whatever you do, don’t allow yourself to be sucked into silly conversations or 
debates about the political or ethical issues relating to vegetarianism. These 
subjects have great merit, but you’ll be a loser if you bring them up in a busi-
ness setting.

D
espite the 16-ounce steaks and entire chicken halves that are typically 
on the menu, finding vegetarian entrées when you go out to eat is much 
easier nowadays than it used to be. Even so, you may find it handy to have 
a few tricks up your sleeve to ensure that you get what you want when you 
order meals away from home.
This chapter covers some of the strategies and know-how that seasoned veg-
etarians rely on when they go out to eat in the nonvegetarian world, whether 
at a neighborhood restaurant or farther away from home.
Adopting the Right Attitude
Eating out is one of life’s great pleasures. Your vegetarian diet shouldn’t get 
in the way of enjoying good food in the company of other people.
In fact, you may find just the opposite is true: Living vegetarian can open up 
a wide range of new food options at restaurants that serve foods you don’t 
make or can’t easily make at home.
Eating out on a vegetarian diet can be fun. It’s all a matter of your perspective 
and of understanding some ways to expand your choices wherever you go.

252
Part IV: Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
Staying flexible
One key to enjoying vegetarian meals away from home is your ability to 
adapt to the environment you find yourself in. At certain times and in certain 
circumstances, you may find that you don’t have much control over where 
you eat out.
Keep an open mind-set. If you find yourself at a restaurant where the clos-
est thing to a vegetarian entrée is the macaroni and cheese side dish, get 
creative. Order a few side dishes and piece together your own meal. Eat less 
for dinner but enjoy a favorite dessert. Be ready to adapt to your setting as 
needed.
Savoring the atmosphere 
and the companionship
Enjoy your surroundings and the people you’re with when you eat out. The 
setting and company are as much a part of the experience as the food.
Let’s face it: Most of us aren’t at risk of withering away from lack of food. 
If you find yourself in a situation where you have few good meatless menu 
options, order what you can. Then turn your attention to the beautiful view, 
the soothing music, and the stimulating conversation. Have a snack later if 
you get hungry before your next meal.
Choosing the Restaurant
The good news for vegetarians is that the  restaurant industry has gotten the 
word that a sizable percentage of the population wants meatless foods when 
they eat out. Not all these people are full-fledged vegetarians, but they see 
vegetarian meals as being healthful and tasty alternatives.
Even some of the most traditional restaurants have responded by adding at 
least one or two vegetarian options to their menus. Many have added veggie 
burgers because burgers are so familiar and popular.
Wherever you go, you have options now. Look for vegetarian restaurants, 
and try cafes nestled into natural foods supermarkets, where high-quality, 
delicious, meatless entrées are nearly always available. Mix it up by eating at 

253
 Chapter 18: Dining in Restaurants and Other Venues
ethnic restaurants serving Middle Eastern, Chinese, Indian, and other cultural 
cuisines known for their many good meatless dishes. (For more on different 
cultural cuisines, see the “Ethnic options” section later in the chapter.)
Chains versus fine dining
Finer restaurants and family-run eateries  are often in a good position to 
accommodate special requests. They tend to prepare their menu items at the 
time you order, so you usually have an opportunity to make substitutions 
or other modifications, such as ordering a salad without bacon or a plate of 
pasta without the meat.
In contrast, chain restaurants are less likely to be able to help you out, 
because many of their menu items are premade. They may not be able, for 
instance, to cook the rice without chicken stock — the rice may have been 
made in a large batch the  day before — or to fix the pasta without meat in the 
sauce.
 
Ask questions about how the food is prepared before you order. If you prefer 
to avoid cream, butter, grated cheese, anchovies, and other animal products, 
check to be sure that the restaurant doesn’t add these ingredients to the food, 
rather than sending the food back after it comes to the table with the offend-
ing ingredient.
 
Be aware of cooking terms that can be clues  that a menu item contains an 
animal product. For example, au gratin usually means that the food contains 
cheese, scalloped means that the dish contains cream, sautéed can mean that 
the food is cooked with oil or butter, and creamy usually means that the item 
is made with cream  or eggs.
 
If you have plans to go to a restaurant that’s unfamiliar to you, try to look 
at the menu ahead of time. Look online to see whether the restaurant has it 
posted. If you don’t see an obvious vegetarian option, call the restaurant and 
ask for recommendations on what may be possible for you to order. Given 
enough notice, finer restaurants are usually happy to prepare a special meal 
for you.
 
Be reasonable about special requests, especially if you can see that the res-
taurant is very busy. If it’s a Friday or Saturday night and the place is packed, 
make your requests as simple as possibl e.

Vegetarian restaurants and 
natural foods cafes
Many natural foods stores have a cafe tucked away in   a corner where you can 
get a quick bite to eat. Some carry cold salads and ready-made sandwiches, 
and others have a more extensive menu, including a salad bar, hot foods, and 
baked goods. These cafes are popular places for many people to pick up a 
takeout meal for lunch during the workweek or for dinner on the way home 
from work.
Vegetarian restaurants, on the other hand, can run the gamut from homey 
little vegetarian hideaways to large metropolitan restaurants that stay 
packed for lunch and dinner. Some are raw foods specialists or macrobiotic 
eateries, others concentrate on vegan cuisine, and many serve foods with an 
ethnic bent, such as Indian or Middle Eastern, or a blend of various ethnic 
cuisines.
Some vegetarian restaurants have an atmosphere that harks back to the 
counterculture feel of the 1960s and 1970s, with an earthy environment 
that’s usually quite casual. You’re likely to find brown rice rather than white 
rice on the menu, and whole-grain breads rather than white, refined dinner 
rolls. Even desserts such as cookies and pie crusts may be made from whole 
grains.
Many vegetarian restaurants flag menu items that are vegan. You’ll find 
packets of raw sugar on the table, and the menu will offer natural soft drinks, 
herbal teas, dishes made with tempeh and tofu, and foods made with mini-
mally processed ingredients. You may find soymilk on the menu, too. All 
these features — as well as a rustic, homey atmosphere — give many veg-
etarian   restaurants a distinctive personality that sets them apart from other 
eateries.
Vegetarian choices on the run
Fast-food restaurants usually  have only limited 
vegetarian options, but some have several. 
Examples include pancakes with syrup, muf-
fins, mixed green salads, bean burritos (you can 
order them without the cheese), bean soft tacos 
or regular tacos, bean tostadas, beans-and-
cheese, veggie burgers (or ask for a cheese-
burger, hold the meat), baked potatoes with 
toppings from the salad bar, and veggie wrap 
sandwiches. Note that yogurt served at some 
fast-food restaurants may contain gelatin.

255
 Chapter 18: Dining in Restaurants and Other Venues
Ethnic options
Many countries, such  as India and China, have vegetarian traditions. Not 
everyone in these countries is vegetarian, but many are, and everyone — 
vegetarian or not — is familiar with the concept of vegetarianism and veg-
etarian foods.
Other countries — including those along the Mediterranean Sea, in the 
Middle East, and in parts of Latin America — have some traditional foods 
that happen to be vegetarian, despite the fact that the diets in these cultures 
often rely heavily on meats and other animal products. For example, people 
in the Middle East eat lamb in large amounts, but falafel, spanakopita, and 
hummus are also traditional favorites that happen to be vegetarian.
What you order when you eat at an ethnic restaurant depends on what type 
of vegetarian diet you follow and how that restaurant prepares specific foods.
In one Italian restaurant, for example, the pasta with marinara sauce may be 
topped with cheese, and in another restaurant, it may not. If you’re vegan, 
you probably won’t eat the spanakopita at a Greek restaurant, because it’s 
usually made with cheese. On the other hand, you may be perfectly happy 
with a Greek salad (minus the feta cheese), some pita bread, and an order of 
boiled potatoes with Greek seasonings.
 
Wherever you eat, ask the wait staff for specifics about how the restaurant 
prepares the food, especially if you’re vegan. One restaurant’s baked ziti in 
marinara sauce may be free of all dairy products, while another’s may come to 
the table smothered in melted mozzarella. Some restaurants prepare marinara 
sauce using beef broth, or use pasta made with eggs.
The following are common vegetarian foods served  in a variety of ethnic 
restaurants:
At Italian restaurants, try:
 
✓ Fresh vegetable appetizers (sometimes called antipasto) with or without 
mozzarella   cheese
 
✓ Mixed green salads
 
✓ Minestrone soup, lentil soup, or pasta e fagioli (pasta with beans)
 
✓ Focaccia and Italian bread with olive oil or flavored oil for dipping
 
✓ Vegetable-topped pizzas (with or without cheese)
 
✓ Pasta primavera

Vegetarians should make it a habit to ask whether beans are cooked with lard, 
a common practice at Mexican restaurants. Restaurant menus don’t always 
note whether the beans are prepared vegetarian-style.
At Chinese restaurants, try:
 
✓ Vegetable soup or hot and sour soup

nutmeg)
Working with Menu Choices
You may occasionally encounter a menu with virtually  nothing for a vegetar-
ian. Some fast-food restaurants and truck stops are good examples — the 
baked beans contain pork, the biscuits are made with lard, the vegetables are 
cooked with bacon, and the staff just chuckles and looks incredulous when 
you ask whether the menu has any meatless items.
You’re stuck.
In most cases, though, choices abound — you just have to get creative. With 
a little practice, getting a vegetarian meal at a nonvegetarian restaurant is a 
relatively simple matter.
Asking about appetizers
Combine several appetizers to create a vegetarian plate. For example, you 
might order a mixed green salad, a bowl of gazpacho, an order of stuffed 
mushrooms, and an appetizer portion of grilled spinach quesadilla.
This approach is a great way to taste a sampling of several foods. It’s also 
a good way to control the amount of food you eat. Restaurant portions — 
especially for entrées — are often excessively large. By ordering a few appe-
tizers, you can help hold your meal to a reasonable amount of food.
Surveying the sides
Just as you may create a meal from the appetizer menu, you can also piece 
together a full plate from a sampling of sides.

259
 Chapter 18: Dining in Restaurants and Other Venues
Pay attention to the descriptions of entrées on the menu, including the sides 
listed with meat dishes. Choose three or four and check with your server to 
find out how they’re prepared. With a salad and some good bread, your meal 
may be the envy of the others at your table.
Coming up with creative combinations
When a restaurant isn’t vegetarian-friendly, scan the menu to get an idea of 
the ingredients the restaurant has on hand. In many cases, you can ask for a 
special order using ingredients that the restaurant uses to make other menu 
items.
For example, if the restaurant serves spaghetti with meat sauce, you know it 
has pasta. The tomato sauce may be already mixed with meat, but the restau-
rant may have vegetables on hand for side dishes. Ask for pasta primavera 
made with olive oil and garlic and whatever vegetables the chef can add.
If all else fails, ask for a baked potato and a salad, or a salad and a tomato 
sandwich on whole-wheat toast. Be creative. If the restaurant serves baked 
 potatoes, ask for one as your entrée. You can top it with items from a salad 
bar, if the restaurant has one. Try adding broccoli florets, salsa, black olives, 
sunflower seeds, or whatever looks good to you.
Making sensible substitutions
Take a good look at meat-containing entrées and determine whether the res-
taurant can prepare them as vegetarian dishes instead. For instance, a pasta 
dish mixed with vegetables and shrimp could easily be made without the 
shrimp. A club sandwich could be fixed with grilled portobello mushrooms, 
avocado, cheese, or tomato slices instead of the meat. This is most likely to 
work at restaurants where the food is made to order and not premade.
Working with Restaurant Staff
Your attitude and level of confidence can make a difference in how well you 
do when you order a vegetarian meal at nonvegetarian restaurants. Your rela-
tionship with the wait staff is key.

260
Part IV: Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
 
Try these tips to make the most of your dining experience:
 
✓ Be assertive: When you speak with restaurant staff about your order, 
be clear about what you want. For instance, instead of just saying, “I’m a 
vegetarian,” explain specifically what you do and don’t eat. Let the wait 
staff know whether dairy and eggs are okay, or if you don’t want your 
foods flavored with chicken broth or beef broth.
 
 Don’t be afraid to press to get the information you need to order effec-
tively. Ask your server whether your special request will increase or 
decrease the cost of the meal, too.
 
✓ Smile and say thank you: As your mother taught you, “please” and 
“thank you” go a long way. If you need special attention from restaurant 
staff to get a meal you can eat, ask for it. But be as pleasant as possible. 
Ask the wait staff for suggestions if you can’t figure out what to order.
Traveling Vegetarian
When you travel, you have less control over meals, you may be in unfamiliar 
surroundings, and you have to contend with the challenges that a change in 
your normal routine can bring. That can put you at risk of eating poorly, par-
ticularly if you can’t find the meatless options you need.
For vegetarians, avoiding meat and possibly other animal products away 
from home requires a set of skills acquired with time and experience. In this 
section, I help you get started by explaining ways you can improve your 
chances of getting what you need when you’re on the road, in the air, or on 
the sea.
Tips for trippin’ by car, bus, or train
If you get hungry when you’re traveling by car or bus, you’re usually lim-
ited to whatever is near the exit off the highway. Your choices are likely to 
be a fast-food restaurant, a family chain eatery, or a truck stop with limited 
choices for vegetarians.
Traveling by train, your food choices may vary, depending on the type of 
train you’re riding. Commuter trains may offer no food service whatsoever. 
Trains with longer routes may have meal cars serving pre-packaged snacks 
and drinks, or table service with limited menus.
In all these cases, consider carrying your own food. Pack a cooler or bag 
of food to take along. On car trips, it’ll save you time not having to stop for 
meals. You’ll save money and eat more healthfully, too.

261
 Chapter 18: Dining in Restaurants and Other Venues
If you do pack your own food, portable, nutritious choices include:
 
✓ Bagels
 
✓  Bottles of mineral water or flavored seltzer water
 
✓ Deli salads
 
✓ Fresh fruit
 
✓ Homemade, whole-grain quick breads, muffins, and cookies
 
✓ Hummus sandwiches
 
✓ Individual aseptic (shelf-stable) packages of soymilk
 
✓ Individual boxes of dry breakfast cereal
 
✓ Instant soup cups or instant hot cereal cups that you can mix with hot 
water from the coffee maker at a gas station food mart
 
✓ Peanut butter or almond butter sandwiches on coarse, whole-grain bread
 
✓  Peeled baby carrots
 
✓ Small cans or aseptic packages of fruit juice
 
✓ Snack-sized cans of fruit or applesauce
 
✓ Tofu salad sandwiches
 
If you like to take trips by bicycle, or if you hike, you need to pack foods that 
are light and portable and don’t require refrigeration. Dried fruit and nut mix-
tures, small containers of soymilk or fruit juice, crackers and peanut butter, 
and  fresh fruit are good choices.
Food for fliers
Airlines have cut back on meal  service, especially on shorter flights. So don’t 
be surprised if the next time you fly, you aren’t served anything more than 
peanuts or snack mix and a beverage. Be prepared. Many travelers now rou-
tinely carry on their own food from home.
Most airlines still offer full meal service on most longer and overseas flights, 
and they’ll usually accommodate requests for vegetarian meals if you give 
them enough notice. Call the airline’s reservation desk at least 24 hours 
before your flight, or make the request when you make your reservations. 
You may or may not be able to post the request online.
Meal service options are in a state of flux because of continuing cutbacks in 
service at most airlines. In the past, most airlines offered several options for 
vegetarians, including lacto ovo, lacto vegetarian meals, and vegan meals. 
Some even offered fruit plates, Asian vegetarian meals, or Indian  vegetarian 
meals. Check with your airline to find out which options are available.

262
Part IV: Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
On most flights, the crew has a list of passengers who’ve ordered special 
meals. They may identify you as you’re taking your seat, or they may ask you 
to ring your flight attendant call button just before meal service begins. On 
other flights, you get served a regular meal unless you speak up and tell the 
flight attendant that you’ve ordered a vegetarian meal.
 
If you’re seated near the back of the plane, you may want to ring your call 
button early during meal service to let attendants know that you’re expecting 
a vegetarian meal. That ensures that they don’t give it away before they get to 
you, which can happen when someone seated in front of you asks for a veg-
etarian meal despite not having ordered one, or when the airline hasn’t loaded 
enough of a particular special request onto the   aircraft.
Meatless at sea
Many cruise ships are like spas or small communities on the water, with 
a wide selection of restaurants and foods, including healthful, vegetarian 
options. Some have separate menus for health-conscious people, or they 
flag specific entrées and menu items as being “healthy.” In many cases, that 
means meatless.
If meat is included in the dish, it can often be left out of meals that are cooked 
to order. For example, a large salad topped with chicken strips can be fixed 
without the chicken, and a stir-fried vegetable and meat dish can be made 
with all the same ingredients, minus the meat.
If you find that the menu choices on a particular day don’t include enough 
meatless options, handle the situation the way you would at a fine restaurant. 
Explain your needs to your server or the chef and ask for a special order. If 
possible, let the kitchen know what you want the day before, especially if the 
ship is going to seat a large number of people (for the captain’s dinner, for 
instance).
 
If you have concerns about whether a cruise line can accommodate your food 
preferences, have your travel agent request information about meals and get 
sample menus to examine. You   can also call the cruise line’s customer service 
office yourself and ask for more details, or check online.
In addition to elaborate, sit-down meals, cruise ships are known for their 
expansive buffets. The sheer volume and variety of foods at these buffets 
makes it easy for most vegetarians to find enough to eat. You’ll have to side-
step the gelatin salads, and vegans may have to bypass items made with 
cream and cheese. Fill up on good-for-you fresh tropical fruit salads, rice, 
pasta, vegetables, and breads.

Coming up with alternatives: 
When plans go awry
Be prepared to improvise when you travel. You may not be able to anticipate 
every complication that affects your meals, but if you’re flexible and creative, 
you can deal effectively with most of them.
Most travel snafus involving meals happen when you travel by plane. As any 
frequent flyer will tell you, ordering a vegetarian meal doesn’t ensure you’ll 
get it. This isn’t always the airline’s fault — sometimes a last-minute change 
of aircraft means that the meals meant for your flight aren’t on that plane.
If you miss a flight and have to take an alternate flight, you won’t get the meal 
that you specially ordered. If you upgrade your ticket to first class just before 
you board your flight, your vegetarian meal may be back in coach, and you may 
have another (maybe better) menu from which to choose. Your flight attendant 
can usually retrieve your meal from coach, though, if you still want it.
 
If you have a particularly long travel day and want to be extra sure that your 
vegetarian meal has been ordered, phone the airline a day or two before 
you leave, just to confirm that the request has been noted. This is especially 
important if you’ve made a schedule change, because the agent may not have 
carried your meal request over   to your new reservation.
If you do find yourself stuck with a ham sandwich instead of your vegetarian 
meal, here are a few things you can do:
 
✓ Eat what you can of the meal you’ve been served. Picking the meat off a 
sandwich and eating the rest isn’t an option for many vegetarians, nor 
is pushing the sausage away from the stack of pancakes that it’s been 
leaning against. But your only other option may be peanuts and tomato 
juice, so if you’re really hungry, eat the salad and dessert.
 
✓ Ask your flight attendant for cookies, crackers, nuts, pretzels, or juice. A 
flight attendant who knows you haven’t received your special order will 
often help you out with some extra snacks or beverages.
 
✓ Pull out the reserves (fresh fruit, a bagel, a sandwich) that you took 
along in your carry-on bag, just in case.
 
Whatever your mode of travel, packing your own provisions is good insurance 
for times when best-laid meal plans fall through. Some good ideas include 
small containers of aseptically packaged soymilk or fruit juice, packaged 
crackers, pretzels, nuts, dried fruit, or trail mix. You can sprinkle trail mix over 
a green salad during in-flight meals or at airport food courts to turn a salad 
into a substantial meal or snack.

264
Part IV: Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Vegetarian Lifestyle 
 
Take opportunities to restock while you’re traveling. Many hotels have bowls 
 of fruit at the checkout desk. Before you leave your hotel, pick up a piece and 
stow it in your carry-on bag or luggage. If you don’t find fruit at your hotel, buy 
a piece or two in the airport terminal or at a supermarket or cafeteria. Fruit is 
good to have on hand in case you get hungry while you’re traveling, and it’s a 
good source of dietary fiber and other nutrients that people tend to neglect 
when they travel.

T
here’s no better time to be a vegetarian than when you’re expecting. A 
healthful vegetarian — and even vegan — diet can provide a woman and 
her baby with all the nutrients needed for a healthy start in life.
But don’t be surprised if your family and friends don’t know it.
Tell people you’re pregnant and that you’re a vegetarian, and all sorts of 
alarms go off. Your family and friends may not have personal experience with 
a vegetarian diet, and they may not have a current understanding of the sci-
ence. They’re anxious, and anxieties heighten when a baby’s involved.
Of course, vegetarians all over the world have been having healthy babies for 
centuries. Here at home, though, the idea of meat-free diets for babies and 
children still sounds like a radical idea.
That’s slowly changing. But until more people have a better understanding of 
vegetarian diets, concern over your vegetarian pregnancy may seem like an 
irritating intrusion.
Take comfort in knowing that people care. The information in this chapter 
will help put to rest some of the most common worries.

Before Baby: Ensuring a Healthy Start
Not every pregnancy is planned, but  if you think you may get pregnant soon, 
it’s a perfect time to be proactive and get yourself into great nutritional 
shape. The longer you have to eat well before you become pregnant, the 
better for you and your baby.
Prepregnancy advice for vegetarians is similar to advice for nonvegetarians:
 
✓ Follow your healthcare provider’s advice about taking a regular-dose, 
daily multivitamin  and mineral supplement for several months before 
you get pregnant. In particular, it’s important to have adequate folic acid 
before pregnancy.
 
 Folic acid may help prevent a neural tube defect such as spina bifida in 
your baby. Spinal bifida is a type of birth defect that involves an incom-
plete closure of the spinal cord.
 
✓ Limit sweets and junk foods. They  displace more nutritious foods from 
your diet.
 
✓ If you drink coffee, limit it to two cups a day. Avoid alcohol and tobacco.
 
✓ Get regular physical activity and drink plenty of water.
 
Vegetarians often go into pregnancy with an edge over nonvegetarians, 
because vegetarians are more likely than other women to have close-to-ideal 
body weights. Vegetarians are also more likely to have been eating plenty of 
folic-acid-rich foods, which lower the risk of neural tube defects.
Paying careful attention to your diet and fitness level can go a long way 
toward ensuring a healthy pregnancy and baby. Drinking plenty of fluids, 
especially water, and getting plenty of rest round out a healthful prepreg-
nancy lifestyle. In this section, I tell you what you need to know about nutri-
tion and exercise when you’re thinking about becoming pregnant.
Maximizing nutrition before 
you get pregnant
The longer you can eat well before  you become pregnant, the better off you 
and your baby will be. People who are well nourished have strong immune 
systems, and they’re less likely to succumb to common illnesses such as 
colds and the flu.

269
 Chapter 19: When You’re Expecting: Managing Your Vegetarian Pregnancy
By limiting your intake of junk foods and stocking up on plenty of nutritious 
vegetables, whole grains, and fresh fruits, you can substantially increase your 
intake of folic acid. Having high folic acid intakes before pregnancy increases 
the chances that your baby is protected from neural tube defects, because 
the period of risk occurs in the very earliest stage of pregnancy, before many 
women even realize that they’re pregnant.
 
Ensuring that your iron stores are high before you get pregnant is also 
important. Many North American women go into pregnancy with low iron 
stores and put themselves at risk for iron deficiency while they’re pregnant. 
Maternal blood volume increases by about 50 percent during pregnancy, and 
women who go into pregnancy with low iron stores risk becoming anemic. See 
Chapter 3 for more about iron.
If you follow a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, you need to have a   reliable 
source of vitamin B12 before, during, and after pregnancy. See Chapter 3 for 
details on getting vitamin B12.
Staying physically fit
The beginning of a pregnancy isn’t the best time to start a new or vigorous 
exercise program. If you establish an exercise routine prior to pregnancy, 
though, it’s likely you can continue that level of activity throughout your 
pregnancy. Get individualized advice from your healthcare provider about 
exercising while you’re pregnant.
 
Staying physically active helps you maintain muscle tone and strength and 
promotes normal stools during a time when many women experience prob-
lems with constipation and hemorrhoids. The fiber in your vegetarian diet 
also helps where that’s concerned!
Eating Well for Two
Okay, the test strip turned blue, and you’re on your way to becoming a 
mommy. The questions are beginning to trickle in:
 
✓ Now that you’re eating for two, how are you going to get enough protein?
 
✓ Are you getting enough calcium, iron, and other nutrients?

270
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
The questions you’re being asked now that you’re pregnant are probably the 
same ones you fielded  when you first became a vegetarian. Understanding 
the ways that pregnancy changes your nutritional needs and how you can 
meet those needs on a vegetarian diet gives you the confidence to enjoy your 
vegetarian pregnancy with fewer worries. Figure 19-1 shows some vegetarian 
foods that are especially good for you during pregnancy.
In this section, I explain how to maximize the nutritional value of your diet to 
help ensure a healthy pregnancy for you and your baby.

Watching your weight gain
Vegetarians are more likely than nonvegetarians to go   into pregnancy at body 
weights that are close to ideal. Women who become pregnant when they’re 
close to their ideal weight can expect to gain from 25 to 35 pounds. If you’re 
overweight when you become pregnant, you may gain less — between 15 
and 25 pounds. If you’re thin when you become pregnant, it’s healthy to gain 
more weight — between 28 and 40 pounds. Weight gain varies with individu-
als, however, so it’s important to get prenatal guidance from a healthcare 
provider, whether that’s your medical doctor, nurse practitioner, or midwife.

271
 Chapter 19: When You’re Expecting: Managing Your Vegetarian Pregnancy
In the first three months of pregnancy, it’s common to gain very little weight — 
a few pounds at most. Weight gain picks up in the second and third trimesters, 
and a weight gain of about one pound a week is typical. When you begin gain-
ing weight after the third month of pregnancy, you need about 300 more calo-
ries  per day than what you needed before you became pregnant. Women who 
need to gain more weight need slightly more calories, and women who need to 
gain less weight need fewer calories to maintain a healthy pregnancy weight.
Most vegetarian women have weight gains that follow patterns similar to 
those of nonvegetarian women. However, vegan women are more likely to be 
slender going into pregnancy. They may be more likely than other women to 
have low calorie intakes because their diets tend to be bulky — high in fiber 
from lots of fruits and vegetables.
If you’re having trouble gaining weight, consult your healthcare provider for 
individualized advice. The following tips may also be helpful:
 
✓ Snack between meals. Foods that are  light and easy to fix are good 
choices. Examples include a bowl of cereal with soymilk, half a peanut 
butter sandwich or peanut butter on crackers, a bowl of hearty soup 
such as lentil or  split pea soup, or a frozen, ready-to-heat bean burrito.
 
✓ Substitute starchy, calorie-dense foods for bulkier, low-calorie foods. For 
example, instead of filling up on a lettuce and tomato salad, try a thick 
soup made with vegetables and barley. Choose starchy vegetables such 
as potatoes, sweet potatoes, peas, and corn more often than low-calorie 
choices such as green beans and cucumbers. (Don’t give up the folic-
acid-rich greens, though!)
 
✓ Drink extra calories. Shakes and smoothies are an easy way to get the 
calories you need. If you use dairy products, make shakes or smoothies 
using ice milk or frozen yogurt mixed with fresh fruit. Vegans can use tofu, 
soymilk or other milk substitutes, and nondairy ice cream substitutes.
 
If you have the opposite problem and are beginning your pregnancy over-
weight, now is not the time to actively reduce. At most, you want to control 
your weight gain by limiting sweets and fatty or greasy foods that are calorie-
rich but nutrient-poor. Plan to lose weight gradually with diet and exercise 
after the baby is   born.
Putting nutritional concerns in perspective
Friends and family mean well, but constant badgering about your vegetarian 
diet can make even the most confident woman worry that her diet and preg-
nancy don’t mix. Not true. In this section, I give you some information you 
can use to reassure others that you’re just fine.

Protein is the first thing  people ask vegetarians about, but it’s the nutrient 
about which most vegetarians have the least need to be concerned. Even if 
you’re pregnant, protein still should be the least of your concerns.
The recommended level of protein intake during pregnancy is 60 grams per 
day for most women. That’s about 10 grams more protein than a woman 
needs when she’s not pregnant. Most women, including vegans, already 
exceed that level of protein intake before they become pregnant. They typi-
cally get even more during pregnancy because their calorie intakes increase 
by 300 calories a day, and protein makes up part of those 300 calories. So you 
can see that getting enough protein during pregnancy is nothing to worry 
about.
Each of these food choices adds an extra 10 grams of protein or more to your 
diet:
 
✓ A peanut butter sandwich on whole-wheat toast
 
✓ A baked potato topped with 1 ounce of shredded cheese (regular or soy)
 
✓ A 6-ounce dish of flavored yogurt (regular or soy) with a bagel
 
✓ A bowl of vegetarian chili and a couple of crackers
 
✓ A bowl of bran cereal with soymilk
 
✓ Two pieces of vegan French toast with maple syrup
 
✓ A bowl of navy bean soup with  half a tofu salad sandwich
Calcium
Counting the milligrams of calcium  in your diet wouldn’t be much fun, and 
fortunately, it’s not necessary. Getting enough calcium isn’t a problem, even 
if you’re a vegetarian.
In general, pregnant women need about the same amount of calcium as 
women who aren’t pregnant. Current recommendations call for 1,000 mil-
ligrams of calcium per day during pregnancy and while a woman is breast-
feeding her baby. Because vegans typically get less calcium than other 
vegetarians and nonvegetarians, it may be more challenging for them to meet 
the recommended level of calcium intake.
On the other hand, evidence suggests that the body becomes more efficient 
at absorbing and retaining calcium during pregnancy, and that may offset 
lower calcium intakes. Nevertheless, vegans and other pregnant women 

273
 Chapter 19: When You’re Expecting: Managing Your Vegetarian Pregnancy
should aim for the 1,000 milligram target. The best way to do this is to try 
hard to get three or four servings of calcium-rich foods each day. See Chapter 
3 for a list of good calcium sources.
If you need help getting enough calcium in your diet when you’re pregnant, 
try these ideas:
 
✓ Go for big portion sizes of calcium-rich foods. Instead of a wimpy half-
cup serving of cooked kale, go for the gusto and take a 1-cup helping.
 
✓ It may be easier to drink your calcium than to chew it. Have some 
calcium-fortified orange juice, or make smoothies with calcium-fortified 
soymilk, fresh or frozen fruit, and tofu  processed with calcium.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D  goes hand in hand with calcium to ensure that your baby’s bones 
and teeth develop normally, so be sure that your vitamin D intake is ade-
quate. Vegetarian women and nonvegetarian women alike need vitamin D, 
but it’s easy to come by. You can get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight or 
from fortified foods. Either way, just make sure you get it. For more on vita-
min D, see Chapter 3.
Iron
If you pumped up your iron stores before you got pregnant (see the earlier 
section “Maximizing nutrition before you get pregnant” for details), it’s more 
likely you  began your pregnancy with adequate iron stores. This is impor-
tant, because going into pregnancy with low iron stores is associated with 
iron deficiency anemia in the later stages of pregnancy.
 
All pregnant women need additional iron during the second and third trimes-
ters of pregnancy when maternal blood volume skyrockets and iron levels 
plummet. It’s common for healthcare professionals to advise women to take 
an iron supplement of 30 milligrams per day during this time.
Vitamin B12
 
A pregnant vegetarian woman needs no   more vitamin B12 than any other preg-
nant woman. However, if you’re a vegan, you have to make a special effort to 
get it. I can’t stress this point enough. Vitamin B12 is found in eggs and dairy 
products, which vegans don’t eat. Not only does your baby need vitamin B12 
from you while she’s developing, she also needs it while breast-feeding. So 
vegan women need a reliable source of vitamin B12 before, during, and after 
pregnancy. See Chapter 3 for more information about vitamin B12.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
Getting enough DHA may be important for brain and eye development 
for developing fetuses and babies. Some research suggests that vegetarian 
and vegan women may have lower DHA levels in their breast milk than 
nonvegetarians.
To be on the safe side, vegetarians should make sure they get a regular 
dietary supply of alpha-linolenic acid, a fatty acid that gets converted into 
DHA in the body.
Eggs are a direct source of DHA, but vegetarians who don’t regularly eat eggs 
can get alpha-linolenic acid from the following sources:
 
✓ Canola, flaxseed, soybean, and walnut oils
 
✓ Cooked soybeans
 
✓ Ground flaxseeds
 
✓ Tofu
 
✓ A vegetarian DHA supplement made from microalgae
 
✓ Walnuts
 
Pregnant vegetarian women should limit foods containing linoleic acid, 
another type of fatty acid found in corn, safflower, and sunflower oils. They 
should also avoid trans fats found in foods made with partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils. These fats can interfere with your body’s ability to convert lino-
lenic acid into DHA.
Caffeine and pregnancy
Whether you’re a vegetarian or not, it’s best 
  to limit or eliminate your use of caffeine when 
you’re pregnant. Studies have demonstrated 
problems in pregnancies resulting from the 
equivalent of five cups of coffee or more per 
day. Until otherwise demonstrated to be benign, 
it’s best to err on the side of caution and elimi-
nate caffeine during pregnancy, or limit your 
use to one or two cups of caffeine-containing 
beverages per day, including coffee, tea, cola, 
and other soft drinks that contain caffeine.

 Chapter 19: When You’re Expecting: Managing Your Vegetarian Pregnancy
Keeping mealtime simple
What most pregnant women  need is someone to make their meals for them. 
Now that’s meal planning made easy! Okay, so you don’t see that happening 
within the next nine months. Here’s what you do: Take some shortcuts for a 
while. Here’s how:
 
✓ Embrace convenience foods. Frozen vegetarian entrées and snacks such 
as burritos, ready-to-heat sandwiches, and veggie burger patties can 
reduce meal prep to minutes.
 
✓ Order out when you’re too tired to cook. Chinese vegetable stir-fry with 
steamed rice, a falafel sandwich and a side of tabbouleh, or a vegetarian 
pizza may be just what you need.
 
✓ Open a can or carton. Eat a can of lentil soup with whole-wheat toast, 
or have a bowl of cereal with soymilk for dinner. Canned beans, canned 
soups, breakfast cereals, frozen waffles, burritos, and microwave pop-
corn are nutritious and quick.
 
✓ Become a weekend cook. Make a big batch of vegetarian chili or lasagna 
and freeze part of it. You can take it out and reheat it when you don’t 
feel like cooking. Muffins and quick breads freeze well, too. You can also 
fix a big, fresh fruit salad or mixed green salad one day, and eat it over 
the next three days.
 
When you’re pregnant, you don’t really have to eat different foods than when 
you’re not pregnant — you just need about 300 more calories per day. Give 
yourself permission to take the easy way out. Forget about fancy meals until 
a time when you have more energy. For now, eat according to your appetite, 
and pay attention to the overall quality of your food choices.
Handling Queasies and Cravings
Pregnancy is a time for strange food aversions and even stranger cravings. 
They’re usually harmless and pass by the end of the first three months of 
pregnancy. Not always, but usually. The same is true of nausea — better 
known as morning sickness, and known by some as morning, noon, and night-
time sickness!
These aspects of pregnancy are no different for vegetarians than they are for 
nonvegetarian women. In this section, I help you understand how to cope 
with these issues.

276
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
Dealing with morning sickness 
any time of day
Morning sickness can be one of the most uncomfortable symptoms of preg-
nancy, whether you’re a vegetarian or not. For many women, overcoming 
nausea is a matter of waiting it out. In the meantime, here are some things 
you can do to minimize its effects:
 
✓ Eat small, frequent meals or snacks. Don’t give yourself a chance to get 
hungry between meals, because hunger can sometimes accentuate feel-
ings of nausea.
 
✓ Eat foods that are easy to digest, such as fruits, toast, cereal, bagels, and 
other starchy foods. Foods high in carbohydrates such as these take 
less time to digest. In contrast, fatty or greasy foods such as chips, pas-
tries, cheese, heavy entrees, and rich desserts take longer to digest and 
are more likely to give you trouble.
 
✓ If nausea or vomiting keep you from eating or drinking for more than one 
day and night, check with your healthcare provider for guidance. It’s 
important to get help to ensure you don’t become dehydrated.
 
✓ If vitamin or mineral supplements make you nauseous, try varying the 
time of day you take them, or try taking them with a substantial meal. 
If the smell of the supplement is  offensive, try coating it with peanut 
butter before swallowing.
Managing the munchies
If you’re having cravings  for something outlandish — like, say, tofu cheese-
cake with chocolate sauce, or a hummus and green tomato sandwich — the 
best thing to do is . . . go for it! This phase isn’t going to last forever, and, let’s 
face it, pregnancy is a time when all sorts of hormonal changes are taking 
place and things can be topsy-turvy for a while. You can’t do much about it, 
it’s not necessary to control it, and it’s probably not going to hurt you. As 
long as you aren’t chewing on radial tires or the clay in your backyard, you 
should   be just fine.
 
What should you do if you crave meat or another animal product that you’ve 
banned from your diet? It’s your call. But if you want to stay meat-free and you 
find yourself daydreaming about bacon, try a look-alike. Soy- and vegetable-
based substitutes for cold cuts, hot dogs, burgers, and bacon are available in 
supermarkets. I talk about these in more detail in Chapter 6.

nter a world in which the little people wear mashed potatoes in their 
hair and toss more of their food onto the floor than into their mouths. 
Hey, when was the last time you smeared smashed peas up and down your 
arms and hid cracker bits behind your ears? You were probably 2 feet tall 
and had three chins. Me, too.
This scenario is pretty much the same whether your child is a vegetarian or 
not. In this chapter, I help guide you in the progression from breast or bottle to 
baby food and beyond, and I address special considerations for vegetarians.
 
Many healthcare providers   are neither familiar with nor comfortable with the 
idea of vegetarian diets for children. Be assured that vegetarian diets are perfectly 
safe and adequate for children and that they hold numerous advantages over 
nonvegetarian diets. Although attitudes are changing, vegetarian diets are still 
largely outside the North American cultural mainstream, and that’s the primary 
reason you may meet with resistance from healthcare providers. You may also 
find unnecessary cautions and a lack of support for vegetarian diets in baby and 
childcare books. Be assured that these opinions aren’t consistent with scientific 
knowledge. The American Dietetic Association and the American Academy of 
Pediatrics support the use of well-planned vegetarian diets for children.
Taking Vegetarian Baby Steps
We all begin our lives as vegetarians. Think about it: How many newborns eat 
hamburgers or chicken nuggets? Milk is our first food. Humans make milk for 
human babies. The alternative, infant formula, is as close a replica as can be 
made in a laboratory. Babies should be breast-fed or bottle-fed exclusively for 
the first four to six months of life. They need no other food during this time.

278
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
 
In fact, if you start solid foods too soon, your child is more likely to become 
overweight and to develop allergies. Resist the temptation to start solids too 
early.
In this section, I walk you through the basics of a vegetarian diet during the 
first year of life.
First foods: Breast and bottle basics
Breast milk is the ideal   first food for babies, because it’s tailor-made for them. 
At no other time in our lives do most of us have a diet so well-suited to our 
needs. From birth through at least the first six months — and longer, if pos-
sible — breast-feeding your baby is the best choice, bar none, for several 
reasons:
 
✓ The composition of breast milk makes it the perfect food for human 
babies. Even baby formulas may not compare. It’s quite possible that 
breast milk contains substances necessary for good health that haven’t 
yet been identified and, therefore, aren’t available in synthetic formulas. 
Just as researchers are discovering new phytochemicals and other sub-
stances in whole foods that aren’t found in synthetic vitamin and min-
eral supplements, our knowledge about the nutritional value of breast 
milk continues to evolve.
 
✓ Breast milk contains protective  substances that give your baby added 
immunity, or protection against certain illnesses. Breast-fed babies are 
also less likely than others to have problems with allergies later in life.
 
✓ Breast-fed babies are  more likely than others to maintain an ideal weight 
throughout life.
 
✓ Breast milk is convenient and sterile.
 
✓ Breast-feeding is good for Mom because it helps the uterus return to its 
former size more quickly and aids in  taking off excess baby fat.
 
Babies of vegetarian women  are at an advantage over babies of nonvegetar-
ians, because vegetarian women have fewer environmental contaminants in 
their breast milk. The diets of vegetarian women contain only a fraction of 
the amount of pesticide residues and other contaminants that nonvegetar-
ian women unknowingly consume. These contaminants are concentrated in 
animal tissues and fat, and women who eat the animal products store the 
contaminants in their own tissues and fat. Consequently, when they produce 
breast milk, they pass the contaminants on to their babies through their milk.

279
 Chapter 20: Raising Your Vegetarian Baby
Women who breast-feed  their babies get lots of applause, but women who 
can’t breast-feed shouldn’t be chastised. Some women can’t or don’t want 
to breast-feed, for a variety of reasons. They need to feed their babies a 
synthetic baby formula instead. Just as with breast-fed babies, formula-fed 
babies need their formula — and nothing but their formula — for at least the 
first four to six months, if not longer.
Several  brands of baby formula are on the market, and your healthcare pro-
vider may recommend a few to you. Most are based on cow’s milk, altered 
for easy digestibility and to more closely resemble human milk. Others may 
contain animal fat or other animal byproducts. Vegans don’t use these for-
mulas, but some formulas contain no animal products and are soy-based. 
These formulas, including such brands as Isomil, Prosobee, and Soyalac, are 
acceptable for use by vegans. Read product labels or talk with your doctor or 
a registered dietitian if you’re unclear about the source of ingredients in baby 
formula. (I include a list of hidden animal ingredients — ingredients you may 
not realize come from animals — in Chapter 5.)
 
Commercial soymilks aren’t the same thing as  infant soy-based formulas, and 
they aren’t appropriate for infants. If you don’t breast-feed your baby, be sure 
that you feed her a commercial infant formula, not the commercial soymilks 
that are meant for general use (such as Edensoy and Silk). When your child is 
older, these are fine, but not in infancy and toddlerhood.
 
If you bottle-feed your baby,   don’t put anything in the bottle except breast 
milk, formula, or water for the first six months. Sugar water drinks, soft 
drinks, and iced tea are inappropriate for babies and small children, and you 
shouldn’t introduce fruit juices and diluted baby cereals until after the six-
month point. Nothing  is more nutritious or beneficial to your baby for the first 
six months than breast milk or infant formula.
Getting the calories and nutrients you need
You may be surprised    to discover that you 
need even more calories when you’re breast-
feeding — about 200 more calories per day — 
than you do when you’re pregnant. Therefore, 
most breast-feeding women need a total of 500 
more calories a day than they needed before 
they were pregnant. No wonder many women 
find that during the time they’re breast-feeding, 
they begin losing some of the extra weight they 
gained while they were pregnant.
You also need a few more nutrients when 
you’re breast-feeding compared to when you’re 
pregnant. For instance, you need about 5 grams 
more protein daily. You can easily get the extra 
nutrients in the additional calories that you eat. 
Be sure to include plenty of fluids, too; water 
is always the best choice. And remember that 
vegans need to be sure to get a reliable source 
of vitamin B12. (See Chapter 3 for more about 
getting enough B12.)

280
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
Solids second
When your baby is about four to six months of  age, you want to begin gradu-
ally introducing solid foods when any of the following occur:
 
✓ Your baby reaches about 13 pounds in weight, or doubles his birth weight.
 
✓ Your baby wants to breast-feed eight times or more during a 24-hour 
period.
 
✓ Your baby takes a quart of formula or more in a 24-hour period and acts 
as if she’s still hungry and wants more.
You won’t find any hard-and-fast rules about how to introduce solid foods to 
babies — just some general guidelines. For instance, all babies — whether 
their families are vegetarians or not — start out eating foods that are the 
easiest to digest and least likely to cause problems, such as allergic reactions 
or choking. These foods are cooked cereals and mashed or pureed fruits and 
vegetables and their juices.
Baby rice cereal is the most common  first solid food for babies because 
almost every baby can tolerate it. It’s best to give your baby iron-fortified 
baby rice cereal until he’s at least 18 months old.
 
Rather than abruptly discontinuing breast or bottle feedings, just supplement 
them by gradually introducing small amounts of solid foods. Begin by mixing 
baby rice cereal with breast milk or infant formula and offering a few table-
spoons. Work up to two feedings a day, totaling about a half cup. From there, 
gradually   add other foods, one at a time, a little at a time, and your baby will 
increase the amounts at her own pace. Introducing foods one at a time helps 
you pinpoint the culprit if your baby has a sensitivity to a particular food.
 
You should wait until a bit later to introduce protein-rich foods and foods that 
are high in fat. After your baby becomes accustomed to cooked cereals and 
mashed and pureed fruits and vegetables, he can move on to table foods.
 
Don’t give cow’s milk   to infants under the age of one year. Cow’s milk can 
cause bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract of human babies and lead to 
anemia. Studies have also linked cow’s milk given to infants with an increased 
risk for insulin-dependent  diabetes.
Adding foods throughout the first year
Table 20-1 suggests schedules  for feeding vegan babies from 4 through 12 
months of age. Notice that the guide excludes all animal products. If you 
prefer a lacto ovo vegetarian approach, you can substitute milk-based baby 
formula for soy formula, eggs for tofu, and low-fat cheese and yogurt for soy 
varieties.

Tracking Your Toddler
Vegetarian diets are associated with numerous health advantages, so chil-
dren who start their lives as vegetarians are more likely to develop good 
eating habits that will follow them into adulthood. Even so, after young veg-
etarian children from 1 to 3 years of age begin eating table foods, you need to 
be aware of a few issues.
Planning meals
No real trick exists for feeding most children a healthful vegetarian  diet. 
The key is to offer a variety of foods and encourage children to explore new 
tastes. Table 20-2 presents a daily feeding guide for vegetarian toddlers and 
preschoolers ages 1 through 3 years.
 
If you need assistance adapting the food guide for your individual child, or you 
need more help with menu planning, contact a registered dietitian who’s famil-
iar with vegetarian diets and accustomed to working with families.
And while I’m on the topic . . .
You should be aware of a few more issues con-
cerning your baby’s nutritional needs during the 
first 12 months:
 ✓ Remember: If you’ re a vegan mom, it’s criti-
cal that you take a vitamin B12 supplement 
while you’re breast-feeding to ensure that 
your baby has a source of vitamin B12, too.
 ✓ Babies over the age of three months who 
have limited exposure to sunlight need a 
vitamin D supplement of not more than 400 
IU per day. If you suspect your   baby may 
not be getting enough sunlight to make 
adequate amounts of vitamin D, consult 
your healthcare provider for advice about 
whether a supplement is needed.
 ✓ After the first four to six months of age, 
mothers usually start their breast-fed 
babies on iron supplements, whether the 
babies will be vegetarians or not. After solid 
foods are added to the diet, iron-fortified 
baby cereal and other foods provide addi-
tional iron in your baby’s diet. Your health-
care provider can give you individualized 
advice about the need for your baby to have 
an iron supplement.

Adjusting to food jags
Young children are notorious for wanting to eat nothing but mashed potatoes 
one week and shunning them the next. Fixations on certain foods — and aver-
sions to others — are typical at this age, and they sometimes last as long as 
weeks, or even months.
Toddlers grow out of food jags, and these fickle food preferences seldom do 
any nutritional harm. Your best strategy is not to overreact. I cover ways to 
encourage your child to eat vegetables and other healthful foods in Chapter 21.

284
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
Getting enough calories
Vegetarian diets — especially low-fat or vegan diets — can be bulky. Many 
plant foods are high  in fiber and relatively low in calories. Because young 
children have small stomachs, they may become full before they’ve had a 
chance to take in enough calories to meet their energy needs. For this reason, 
it’s important to include plenty of calorie-dense foods in the diets of young 
vegetarian children.
 
Some adults try to keep their fat intakes to a minimum, especially to control 
their weight, but this very aspect of plant-based diets that helps adults control 
their weight can backfire for young children. If fat intakes are overly restricted 
in young vegetarian children, those children may have trouble getting enough 
calories to meet their energy needs.
Liberally using plant sources of fat can help provide young children with the 
extra calories they need during a period of their lives in which they’re grow-
ing and developing rapidly. So, for instance, adding a slice of avocado (nearly 
all fat) to a sandwich is fine, or using nut and seed butters on sandwiches and 
vegetable sticks is also a good idea.
Vegan or vegetarian? Determining what’s 
appropriate for young children
After your baby makes the transition to a toddler diet and solid foods, you 
have to decide the extent to which you’ll include animal products in her diet.
Young children can thrive on vegetarian diets that include some animal 
products or none at all. Table 20-2 shows you what to expect toddlers and 
preschoolers to eat.
The protein needs of vegan children are a bit higher than those of nonvegan 
children because of differences in the digestibility and composition of plant 
and animal proteins. Assuming vegan children get enough calories to meet 
their energy needs, though, and get a reasonable variety of plant foods, they 
should get plenty of protein in their diet.
 
An added caution is that vegan children need a reliable source of vitamin B12 
in their diet. I list examples in Chapter 3. If a vegan child has limited exposure 
to sunshine, consult your healthcare provider to determine whether you 
should add a vitamin D supplement or fortified foods to his diet.

285
 Chapter 20: Raising Your Vegetarian Baby
Serving sensible snacks
Another way to ensure that vegetarian kids get enough calories is to offer 
them between-meals snacks .
 
Be sure you don’t  give toddlers foods they can choke on. For instance, grapes 
and whole tofu hot dogs are dangerous because they can easily get stuck in 
the esophagus. If you want to offer these foods to a small child, be sure to 
slice them in half or into quarters. Also be careful with chips, nuts, and other 
small snacks that can lodge in a small child’s throat. Be sure to supervise 
young children while they’re eating.
A few nutritious snack ideas for vegetarian toddlers include
 
✓ Cooked or dry cereal with soymilk
 
✓ A dab of smooth peanut or almond butter on a cracker
 
✓ Graham crackers
 
✓ Single-serving, shelf-stable boxes of 100 percent fruit juice or soymilk
 
✓ Small pieces of fresh fruit
 
✓ Soy yogurt
 
✓ Tofu processed with calcium, served as cubes or made into smoothies 
or pudding
 
✓ Unsweetened applesauce
 
✓ Whole grain cereal O’s

Many of these kids are the only vegetarians in their household. You’ve got to 
admire their conviction, but when Mom and Dad aren’t vegetarians as well, 
the situation may cause parents to worry about the nutritional adequacy of 
the diet and how best to manage family meals without meat. Even in homes 
where vegetarianism is the norm, people have questions about vegetarian 
nutrition for kids.
 
Feeding any child — vegetarian or not — takes time, patience, and care. A 
haphazard diet that’s heavy on chips and soft drinks and light on fruits and 
vegetables — or otherwise poorly planned — isn’t likely to meet the needs of 
any growing child. On the other hand, a well-planned vegetarian diet offers 
health advantages over nonvegetarian diets for kids, and it helps put into 
motion healthful eating habits that can become a pattern for a lifetime.
In this chapter, I discuss the most common questions and concerns about 
vegetarian diets for children and teenagers.

Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
Watching Your Kids Grow
Some people worry that children who don’t eat meat won’t grow as well 
as they should. Reports in the scientific literature over the years have 
addressed poor growth rates in vegetarian children, but a closer look at 
those studies should help you put concerns into perspective.
According to these studies, growth problems in vegetarian children occurred 
when:
 
✓ The children lived in poverty in developing countries and didn’t have 
enough to eat.
 
✓ The children did not live in poverty but had bizarre, inadequate diets 
that were severely limited in variety and calories.
Malnutrition, not vegetarianism, causes growth retardation. Any child, veg-
etarian or not, who doesn’t have enough to eat will suffer from nutritional 
deficiencies and may have difficulties developing properly.
I advocate vegetarian diets that contain adequate calories and a range of 
foods to ensure that children meet their nutritional needs. Reasonable veg-
etarian diets not only meet nutritional needs but are associated   with health 
advantages as well.
Understanding issues about growth rates
Talking about growth rates in vegetarian children raises the question of what 
a normal rate of growth is for a child.
Your pediatrician has growth charts that she uses to plot your child’s height 
and weight at regular intervals, comparing them to population norms. You 
may even be doing this yourself at home. Growth rates are usually reported 
in percentiles. For instance, one child may be growing at the 50th percentile 
for height and weight, while another child of the same age may be growing at 
the 90th percentile. Still another same-aged child may be growing at the 25th 
percentile. Is one child healthier than the others? Not necessarily.
 
Within any group of people, you should expect to see 50 percent growing 
at the 50th percentile, 25 percent growing at the 25th percentile, and so on. 
That’s called normal distribution. In other words, variation is normal within 
population groups. A child growing at the 25th percentile isn’t necessarily 
healthier or less healthy than a child growing at the 90th percentile. What’s 
important is for a child growing at a particular rate to continue to grow at that 
same rate.

289
 Chapter 21: Meatless Meals for Children and Teens
 
However, you want to investigate a decline in your child’s growth rate. So a 
child growing at the 35th percentile who continues to grow at the 35th percen-
tile is probably fine, but if that child’s rate of growth falls to the 25th percen-
tile,   the parent or healthcare provider should look into possible causes.
Putting size into perspective
Parents expect kids who eat a meat-and-potatoes diet to go through growth 
spurts at certain ages. Most people think of that as a good thing. It’s impor-
tant for your child to grow up to be big and strong, right? Many people hope 
for football player-sized kids and worry that the playground bully is going to 
pick on their child if he’s too small.
The good news is that the growth rates of lacto and lacto ovo vegetarian chil-
dren are similar to the growth rates of nonvegetarian children. (I give details 
about what different kinds of vegetarians eat in Chapter 1.) However, you 
find very little information about growth rates of vegan children in the U.S., 
although a peek at the growth rates of children in China eating a near-vegan 
diet has given scientists some idea of what you may expect to see.
In a population study called the China Project, which began  in 1983, scien-
tists found that children eating a near-vegan diet grew more slowly than U.S. 
children eating a standard, Western-style diet containing meat and milk. The 
Chinese children attained full adult stature eventually, but they took longer 
to get there. They grew over a period of about 21 years, as compared to 
American children, who stopped growing at about the age of 18.
 
Chinese girls reached menarche (had their first menstrual cycle) at an aver-
age age of 17, compared to 12 for U.S. girls. This later age of menarche was 
associated with lower rates of breast cancer in Chinese women, theoretically 
because  they were exposed to high levels of circulating estrogen hormones 
for a shorter period.
So it’s possible that U.S. vegan children may grow more slowly than other 
children. Nobody knows, though, if that’s good, bad, or indifferent.
 
The most important thing for you to know if you have a vegetarian child is 
that your child’s growth rate should be constant or increase. If growth takes a 
nose dive, that’s the time to investigate and intervene. In the meantime, if your 
child is growing and is otherwise healthy, you have no need to worry.

Feeding Fundamentals
People generally associate vegetarian diets with health advantages for every-
one, but a few of the characteristics that make vegetarian diets good for you 
can be pitfalls for children if you aren’t aware of them and don’t take precau-
tions. The primary issue is the bulkiness of a vegetarian diet and the fact that 
some children can fill up before they’ve taken in enough calories.
In this section, I discuss this issue and a few others to be aware of.
Making sure kids get enough calories
It’s important to be aware of the  potential bulkiness of a vegetarian diet and to 
give your child plenty of calorie-dense foods. A child whose diet is mostly low-
calorie, filling foods such as large lettuce salads and raw vegetables could run 
into problems getting enough calories. It’s okay to include those foods in your 
child’s diet, but don’t let them displace too many higher-calorie foods.
Feel free to use vegetable sources of fat in your child’s diet, such as seed 
and nut butters, olive oil, and avocado slices. These fats are a concentrated 
source of calories. Though some adults may want to limit fatty foods in their 
own diet to control their weight, kids need the extra calories for growth.
 
If you and your family have recently switched to a vegan diet and your child 
loses weight or doesn’t seem to be growing as quickly, include more sources 
of concentrated calories. Add vegetable fats, and serve more starchy foods — 
breads, cereals, peas, potatoes, and corn — and fewer   low-calorie, bulky foods 
such as lettuce and raw vegetables. Like other vegetarian diets, vegan diets 
can be healthful for children.
Reviewing the ABCs of nutrition for kids
When it comes to designing a vegetarian diet for older children and teens, 
a few key nutrients — protein, calcium, iron, and vitamins B12 and D — 
deserve special attention. (If you need more information about any of these 
nutrients, I cover them in detail in Chapter 3.)
 
I could list numerous other nutrients and discuss their roles in the growth and 
development of children, as well as the importance of including good food 
sources in the diet. When it comes right down to it, though, the major points 
you need to remember are to make sure kids get enough calories, a reason-
able variety of foods, a reliable source of vitamin B12 for vegan and near-vegan 
children, and adequate vitamin D. Kids should limit junk foods, too, so they 
don’t displace more nutritious foods.

291
 Chapter 21: Meatless Meals for Children and Teens
Protein power
Protein and calorie malnutrition go hand in hand. When a child’s diet is too 
low in calories, her body will burn protein for energy. When her diet contains 
sufficient calories, her body can use protein for building new tissues instead 
of burning it for energy.
 
The exact amount of protein your child needs each day depends on several 
factors, including her size, her activity level, and the number of calories she 
needs each day. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in 
the National Academies estimates that 5 to 20 percent of calories should come 
from protein for children and teens ages 4 through 18.
The most practical way to ensure that your child has enough protein is to 
be sure she’s getting adequate calories from a reasonable variety of foods, 
including vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds (fruits contain no pro-
tein). Particularly good sources of protein that are also likely to be hits with 
children include
 
✓ Bean burritos and tacos
 
✓ Hummus or other bean dips with vegetable sticks or tortilla chips
 
✓ Nonfat or soy cheese on crackers
 
✓ Nonfat or soy yogurt
 
✓ Peanut butter on apple chunks or celery sticks
Supplement with snacks
Give your kids nutritious snacks between meals. 
In Chapter 20, I include a list of good snacks for 
younger children. For older children and teens, 
you can expand that list to include
 ✓ Bagels
 ✓ Bean burritos and tacos
 ✓ Cereal and soymilk or skim cow’s milk
 ✓ Dried fruit
 ✓ Fresh fruit
 ✓ Fresh vegetable sticks with hummus or 
black bean dip
 ✓ Frozen fruit bars
 ✓ Frozen waffles with maple syrup or jam or jelly
 ✓  Individual frozen vegetarian pizzas
 ✓ Muffins
 ✓ Popcorn
 ✓ Sandwiches
 ✓ Smoothies made with soymilk and fresh 
fruit, ice cream substitute, or nonfat dairy 
products
 ✓ Veggie burgers
 ✓ Whole-grain cookies
 ✓ Whole-grain crackers
 ✓ Whole-grain toast with jam or jelly

292
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
 
✓ Peanut butter sandwiches made with whole-grain bread or crackers
 
✓ Soymilk and fruit smoothies made with milk
 
✓ Tempeh sloppy Joes
 
✓ Tofu or nonfat  ricotta cheese and vegetable lasagna
 
✓ Tofu salad sandwiches
 
✓ Vegetarian pizza
 
✓ Veggie burgers
 
✓ Veggie hot dogs
 
Some scientific evidence suggests that young vegan children’s bodies may use 
protein better if they space meals close together. Eating snacks between main 
meals, for example, may be helpful.
Keeping up with calcium
Because children and  teens grow rapidly, they need plenty of calcium to 
accommodate the development of teeth and bones. The Food and Nutrition 
Board of the Institute of Medicine in the National Academies recommends 
that children and teens ages 9 through 18 get 1,300 milligrams of calcium 
each day. Several factors, though — including the presence of vitamin D and 
the absorption and retention of calcium — are as important to maintaining a 
healthy body as having adequate amounts of calcium in the diet.
Still, it’s a good idea to encourage children and teens to eat three servings of 
calcium-rich foods each day. (Counting servings of calcium-rich foods, rather 
than counting milligrams of calcium, is a practical way to ensure your chil-
dren get what they need.)
Calcium-rich foods include dark green, leafy vegetables (such as kale, collard 
greens, turnip greens, and bok choy), broccoli, legumes, almonds, sesame 
seeds, calcium-fortified orange juice and soymilk, and nonfat dairy products 
such as milk and yogurt. I list more foods in Chapter 3.
Aim for big servings — at least a cup at a time — and include one or two serv-
ings of a fortified food such as calcium-fortified soymilk or juice. If your kids 
won’t eat their vegetables, keep reading — I cover that later in this chapter.
Iron, too
Many high-calcium foods also happen  to be high in iron, so serving these 
foods to your family gives you a double benefit. Good plant sources of iron 
include dark green, leafy vegetables, soybeans and other legumes, bran 
flakes, and blackstrap molasses.

293
 Chapter 21: Meatless Meals for Children and Teens
The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in the National 
Academies recommends that boys and girls ages 9 to 13 get 8 milligrams 
of iron in their diets each day. Boys 14 to 18 need a little more — about 11 
milligrams of iron each day — and girls in that age range need about 15 mil-
ligrams of iron each day.
 
Don’t forget that it’s important for vegetarians to have good food sources of 
vitamin C present at meals to increase the body’s absorption of the iron in 
those meals. So give your kids plenty of fruits and vegetables to help ensure 
they get enough calcium, iron, and vitamin C.
Vitamin B12
Everyone, including children and teens, needs  a reliable source of vitamin 
B12. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in the National 
Academies recommends that boys and girls ages 9 to 13 get 1.8 micrograms 
of vitamin B12 in their diets each day. Boys and girls 14 to 18 need a little 
more — 2.4 micrograms each day.
If your kids are eating a vegan or near-vegan diet, they should be eating vita-
min B12-fortified foods regularly, or taking a vitamin B12 supplement. If you 
have any doubt about whether fortified foods are providing enough vitamin 
B12, the safest bet is to have your kids take a supplement.
Children who regularly include animal products in their diets — milk, eggs, 
cheese, and yogurt, for example — should have no problem getting neces-
sary amounts of vitamin B12. If you aren’t sure if your child is getting enough, 
ask a registered dietitian for individualized guidance.
Vitamin D
The important thing to  remember about vitamin D and children is that vita-
min D, in concert with calcium, is critical for the normal growth and devel-
opment of bones and teeth. Our primary source of vitamin D isn’t food at 
all — our bodies produce vitamin D after our skin is exposed to sunlight. 
Vitamin D-fortified cow’s milk and fortified soymilk, rice milk, and almond 
milk are also good sources.
The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in the National 
Academies recommends that boys and girls ages 9 to 18 get 5 micrograms 
(200 IUs) of cholecalciferol, a form of vitamin D, in their diets each day in the 
absence of adequate sunlight exposure. I discuss vitamin D in more detail in 
Chapter 3.
 
If you have any doubts about whether your child is at risk of not getting 
enough vitamin D, ask a registered dietitian or your healthcare provider for an 
assessment and recommendations.

Notes: You can increase the calorie content of the diet by adding greater amounts of nut butters,

like Vegetarian Support Formula nutritional yeast, vitamin B12-fortified soymilk, vitamin B12-fortified 
breakfast cereal, vitamin B12-fortified meat analogs, or vitamin B12 supplements. I also recommend 
adequate exposure to sunlight —20 to 30 minutes of summer sun on the hands and face two to three 
times a week — to promote vitamin D synthesis. If sunlight exposure is limited, use supplemental 
vitamin D.

Teaching Your Children 
to Love Good Foods
As a kid, what did you do with the vegetables you didn’t want to eat? I lined 
my peas up along the edge of my plate, hidden along the underside of my 
knife. As you probably know by now, trying to force people to do things they 
don’t want to do is usually a losing battle, and kids are no exception.
You can employ some strategies, however, that may increase the likelihood your 
child will eat his vegetables. More important, you can do some things — which 
I outline in this section — to increase the likelihood that your child will grow up 
enjoying healthful foods and will make them a part of his adult lifestyle.
Modeling healthy choices
Model the behavior you want your children to adopt. If you’d like your 
children to eat broccoli and sweet potatoes, for example, let them see you 
enjoying these foods yourself. But don’t pretend to like something you don’t, 
because children can spot a fake. If you don’t care for a food, fix it for the 
others in your household, and don’t make a big show out of the fact that you 
don’t have any on your plate.
Present foods with a positive attitude — an air that says you expect others 
to like this food. If your child expresses dislike for a food that you want to 
see her eat, play it low key. She may come around in time. If not, you have no 
need to fret — you can choose from among hundreds of different vegetables, 
fruits, and grains. If your child doesn’t like one, plenty of other options are 
out there to take its  place.
Feeding furry family members
Dogs are naturally omnivorous and can fare 
well on a diet that excludes meat. Cats, on the 
other hand, are carnivorous and need the nutri-
ents found in meat. Specifically, cats must have 
a source of the amino acid taurine in their diets, 
and taurine doesn’t exist in the plant world. If 
you don’t feed your cat meat, you must provide 
a taurine supplement. Your veterinarian may or 
may not be receptive to the idea of a vegetar-
ian diet for cats and dogs, just as many human 
healthcare providers have no training in the 
fundamentals of vegetarian diets for people.

296
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
Giving kids the freedom to choose
Children, like everyone, prefer a  measure of freedom. If your child turns up 
his nose at a particular food, offer one or two other healthful choices. For 
instance, if your child says no to cooked carrots, offer a few raw carrots 
with dip instead. If he refuses these, let it go. The next meal will bring new 
choices, and not eating any vegetables at one meal won’t make a difference in 
your child’s health.
Of course, your child may also have special requests. It’s okay to enter-
tain them, within reason. In the next section, I talk about the advantages 
of empowering your children to make good food choices by getting them 
involved in meal planning.
Getting kids involved in meal planning
Children are more likely to eat what they’ve had a hand in planning and pre-
paring. Give your child frequent opportunities to get involved in meals.
You can start by taking her shopping. If you buy apples or pears, let her pick 
out two or three. Let older children have even more responsibility. Send your 
teen to the opposite side of the produce department to pick out a head of 
cauliflower. Who cares if it’s the best one? It’s more important that your kids 
become   involved.
When it comes to cooking, supervise young children and let them help with 
simple tasks like retrieving canned goods from the pantry or dumping pre-
pared ingredients into a pot. Older kids can help wash and peel fruits and 
vegetables for salads and can assemble other  ingredients for casseroles and 
stir-fries.
 
By planting a garden and tending it together, you can teach children how their 
foods grow to help them gain an interest in and appreciation for fresh foods. 
Short on space or time? Try a window-sill herb garden, or grow a pot of toma-
toes on your back porch or apartment balcony.
Troubleshooting Common Challenges
Older vegetarian children and teens share diet problems similar to those 
faced by their nonvegetarian peers. In this section, I offer guidance on the 
meat-free approach to addressing these issues.

 Chapter 21: Meatless Meals for Children and Teens
Making the most of school meals
It isn’t easy to find a healthy school lunch, and it’s tougher to find a healthy 
vegetarian school lunch. School systems have poured lots of time, energy, 
and money into improving their meals programs in recent years to try to 
bring them into compliance with contemporary dietary recommendations.
Most aren’t there yet, but changes in federal regulations have made more 
health-supporting vegetarian options feasible. For instance, schools can now 
serve yogurt as a meat replacement, and they can serve nondairy cheeses in 
lieu of dairy cheeses if they’re nutritionally similar.
But schools still lack many vegetarian options, and kids who want vegan 
options have even fewer choices. What to do? Here are some ideas:
 
✓ Take a bag lunch. Figure 21-1 shows some ideas to get you started. I also 
include a list of ten good-tasting and practical ideas for bag lunches in 
Chapter 25.
 
✓ Get a copy of the cafeteria menu. You and your child can peruse the 
menu for the best choices each day.
 
✓ Talk to school food service personnel. The circumstances are different 
for each student and each school, so try sitting down with food service 
personnel and discussing practical solutions  that both your child and 
the school can live with.
Following are two options that may help your child make the most of 
school meals:
 
✓ The National Farm to School Program: This program is one example 
of efforts to bring more fresh, locally grown produce to schools. The 
program has great potential to improve the nutritional quality of school 
meals and increase options for vegetarians.
 
 The program began with pilot projects in California and Florida in the 
late 1990s as a movement to connect community farmers and local 
schools with the goals of supporting local agriculture, improving meals 
in school cafeterias, and educating students about nutrition.
 
 By 2004, Congress recognized the program in the 2004 Child Nutrition 
Reauthorization — legislation renewed every five years authorizing fed-
eral support for child nutrition programs, such as the National School 
Lunch Program.
 
 Today, more than 2,000 Farm to School programs operate in 39 states. 
The National Farm to School Program is managed jointly by the Center 
for Food & Justice, a division of the Urban and Environmental Policy 
Institute at Occidental College, and the Community Food Security 
Coalition. For more information about Farm to School, go to www.
farmtoschool.org/.

298
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
 
✓ Nutrient-based menu planning system: Schools also have the option of 
using this system, which enables them to evaluate meals based on over-
all nutritional composition rather than on whether a meal consists of a 
specified number of servings from various food groups.
 
 Theoretically, a nutrient-based system could make it easier to serve 
meatless menus, because servings from the meat group wouldn’t be 
mandatory. In reality, few schools in the U.S. are using this system, 
because changing from the old food groups system would take more 
resources than many schools can afford.

Supporting a healthy weight
Obesity is a major public health problem for children in North America and 
around the world. In fact, health professionals worry that today’s young 
people may face more health problems earlier than their parents and grand-
parents did because of excess weight. The problem is that diets are too high 
in calories and kids get too little physical activity.
The good news is that vegetarian children are more likely than other children 
to be at an ideal body weight. Their diets also contain substantially more 
fiber and less total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than diets that include 
meat.

299
 Chapter 21: Meatless Meals for Children and Teens
If your vegetarian child happens to be overweight, give him a junk check 
(more about that in the next section, “Dejunking your child’s diet”). If the 
diet is already up to  snuff, the problem is likely due, at least in part, to lack of 
exercise.
Pull your child away from the computer or video games and require her to 
get moving. For teens, aerobics classes, school sports, and weight lifting 
are excellent ways of burning calories and increasing cardiovascular fitness 
and overall strength. Encourage biking, hiking, or canoeing. Switch activities 
depending on the season: Snow ski in the winter and swim in the summer. 
Mix it up to avoid getting into a rut.
Older children and teens are also very body-conscious. Teen boys are more 
likely than teen girls to feel they’re too skinny. Nature will probably take its 
course, and today’s string bean will be tomorrow’s 40 regular. It just happens 
sooner for some than for others.
So if your teen wants to gain weight, the way to do it is simply to eat more 
of the good stuff. Increase serving sizes at meals and add healthful snacks 
between meals. Smoothies and juice blends add easy, quick calories. 
Increasing   weight-bearing exercise — within limits, of course — also stimu-
lates the growth of more muscle tissue.
 
Your teen should steer clear of special — and often expensive — protein pow-
ders, shakes, bars, or other supplements. Flooding his body with extra protein 
from supplements won’t build muscle. In fact, it could be harmful. Byproducts 
of protein breakdown have to be filtered from the bloodstream, increasing the 
workload for the kidneys. Muscle is made from hard work and food — noth-
ing fancier than the nutrients found in an ordinary diet that contains a mix of 
health-supporting foods.
 
Eating disorders are   more common in teens — especially girls — than in 
adults. No cause-and-effect relationship exists between vegetarian diets 
and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa (self-starvation) and bulimia 
(bingeing and purging), but research suggests that some girls adopt vegetar-
ian diets to mask eating disorders. The effects of anorexia can also cause a 
loss of the taste for meat, leading some anorexics to stop eating meat. Eating 
disorders have psychological origins, and people with eating disorders need 
psychiatric or psychological intervention.
Dejunking your child’s diet
Older children and teens have more freedom than younger children to make 
their own food choices. Too often, they reach for chips, soft drinks, fast 
foods, and other junky foods that provide little nutrition in exchange for the 
calories.

300
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
Encourage your child to clean up her diet. Keep fresh fruits on hand at home, 
and serve bigger helpings of vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Give 
your child a big apple to take to school in her backpack. Most important, 
model a junk-free diet yourself.
 
Having some appealing and acceptable — though not nutritionally perfect — 
alternatives on hand may also be helpful. Diet drinks and noncaloric, flavored 
seltzer water, for example, are preferable to caloric soft drinks and other 
sweetened beverages. (All caloric drinks, including fruit juices, contribute to 
excessive calorie intakes for many children, teens, and adults and may con-
tribute to obesity.) Popping plain corn kernels or steaming a bowl of edamame 
(fresh or frozen soybeans in the pod) and adding a dash of salt may satisfy the 
craving for a salty snack with only a fraction of the sodium contained in store-
bought, processed snacks.
Dealing with food allergies
Food allergies are an extreme response by the 
body’s immune system to proteins in certain 
foods. Symptoms include hives, rashes, nausea, 
congestion, diarrhea, and swelling in the mouth 
and throat. Severe reactions can cause shock 
and death.
So for some vegetarians, a stray peanut can 
be life threatening. Other vegetarian foods that 
are among the most common food allergens 
include eggs, milk, soy, tree nuts, and wheat.
About 2 percent of adults and 8 percent of 
children have true food allergies, according 
to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, 
and Immunology. Food allergies are different 
from food intolerances, which seldom cause 
symptoms so severe. One example is lactose 
intolerance — the inability to digest the milk 
sugar lactose. (I discuss lactose intolerance in 
Chapter 3.)
Food companies are now required by law to 
use easily recognizable terms on food labels 
to describe common food allergens. Prior to 
this law, food companies listed terms such as 
albumin and casein on food packages without 
explaining that they were byproducts of eggs 
and milk. The law also requires companies to 
disclose potential allergens if they’re present in 
natural flavorings, natural colorings, and spices 
added to packaged foods.
Food allergies have no cure. Children may out-
grow them, but allergies to peanuts and tree 
nuts usually last for life. For more help with food 
allergies, I recommend:

any people are healthy and active into old age these days, though age-
related health problems do increase over the years. Within the field 
of gerontology, the study  of normal aging, scientists are gaining insights into 
aspects of aging that most of us take for granted as part of growing old.
Everyone experiences age-related changes, but these changes occur at dif-
ferent rates for different individuals. Some people never develop certain 
diseases and conditions. Why? Genetic differences among people may be one 
reason, but lifestyle factors probably play a role, too.
Diet is one lifestyle factor that makes an undeniable difference in the way 
people age. Physical activity makes a substantial difference, too. Eating a 
nutritious diet and maintaining a lifelong habit of regular — preferably daily — 
physical activity may not stop the clock, but it can delay evidence of aging 
that some people experience later than others.
For example, you may consider constipation, hemorrhoids, and weight gain 
to be normal parts of the aging process, or you may figure that diabetes and 
high blood pressure are inevitable at some point.
But vegetarians, as a group, have a different experience.
Vegetarians have lower rates of many chronic diseases and conditions. They 
generally live longer than nonvegetarians, too. Health and longevity differ-
ences may be due, in part, to lifestyle factors typical of vegetarians, including

a higher level of physical activity, not smoking, and eating a health-supporting 
diet.
In this chapter, I explain how you can leverage an active vegetarian lifestyle 
to help delay or prevent some age-related changes in your health. I discuss 
nutritional issues that affect adults as they age, and I cover the basics of 
eating for optimal athletic performance — whether you’re a neighborhood 
walker or a contender for the Tour de France.
Monitoring Changing Nutrient Needs
Older adults — roughly defined as people age 50 and above — have been 
 at the back of the line when it comes to research on the body’s nutritional 
needs throughout the life cycle. Very little is known about how the aging pro-
cess affects the body’s ability to digest, absorb, and retain nutrients.
For now, recommended intakes for most nutrients for older adults are simply 
extrapolated from the recommendations for younger people. Scientists do 
know a bit about how metabolism and the body’s need for certain nutrients 
changes with age, though. Read on to discover the smartest way to get the 
nutrients you need as you age.
Getting more for less
Yes, what you’ve always  heard is true: Your metabolism declines as you age. 
Unfair! Unfair! But the sad fact is that you need fewer calories the older you 
get, assuming that your physical activity level stays the same. In fact, if 
your activity level decreases, then your calorie needs decline even further. 
Oh, woe!
It gets worse. If you consume fewer calories, your intakes of protein, vita-
mins, minerals, and other nutrients also decrease. Unfortunately, as far as 
anyone knows right now, your nutritional needs don’t diminish. Your needs 
for certain nutrients may actually rise.
 
That means that you have to be extra careful to eat well. You have to get the 
same amount of nutrition that you got when you were younger (and eating 
more calories), but you have to get it in less food. That means that you have 
to eat fewer empty-calorie foods — less junk. Fewer sweets, snack chips, cakes, 
cookies, candy, soft drinks, and alcohol. Empty-calorie foods are nutritional 
freeloaders — they   displace nutrient-dense foods and provide little nutrition 
in exchange for the calories.

303
 Chapter 22: Aging Healthfully: Vegetarian Lifestyles for Adults of All Ages
Paying special attention 
to specific nutrients
More research is needed on how nutritional needs change for people age 
50 and beyond, but scientists are sure that needs do change. That may be 
partly because the body’s ability to absorb certain nutrients declines grad-
ually over time.
 
For example, older people produce less stomach acid, which is vital in help-
ing the body absorb vitamin B12. Scientists estimate that 10 to 30 percent of 
adults over age 50 may have difficulty absorbing enough vitamin B12 from 
their food.
That’s why older adults should eat foods that are fortified with vitamin B12 
or take a B12 supplement. This is especially noteworthy for older vegans, 
who need to be careful to have a reliable source of vitamin B12 in their diets.
 
For older vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike, recommendations for calcium, 
vitamin D, and vitamin B6 are higher than for younger people. If you’re an 
older vegetarian who doesn’t drink milk or eat other dairy products and your 
exposure to sunlight is limited, use vitamin D-fortified foods such as some 
brands of soymilk, or get your vitamin D from a supplement.
The bottom line is that it’s important for older folks to be frugal with their 
calories and save them for nutritious foods, rather than filling   up on sweets 
and junk.
Celebrating the Vegetarian Advantage
You knew you were getting old when your eyebrows started turning gray.
Besides the obvious outward signs of aging — wrinkles, lines, and gray 
hair — older people have other common complaints. Most have to do in 
some way with the digestive tract. People start getting constipated, or they 
have more trouble with heartburn and indigestion. Some of these problems 
are a result of a decrease in the production of the stomach secretions that 
aid digestion, or they’re in some other way a result of the body not function-
ing as efficiently as it once did.
But many  problems are the result of a lifelong poor diet, or a lack of regular 
exercise, or any of a host of other destructive habits, such as smoking or 
abusing alcohol. For instance, if you’ve been exercising, eating plenty of fiber, 
and drinking enough water for the past 20 years, you’re much less likely than 
other people to have hemorrhoids or varicose veins.

304
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
 
The general dietary recommendations for older adults are similar to those for 
younger people: Get enough calories to meet your energy needs and maintain 
an ideal weight, and eat a variety of wholesome foods, including fruits, vegeta-
bles, whole grains, legumes, and a limited number of seeds and nuts. Drink 
plenty of fluids, and limit the sweets and junk.
Eating a vegetarian diet can help prevent or delay many of the common prob-
lems associated with getting older, and a vegetarian diet can also help allevi-
ate some of the problems after they’ve developed.
That’s something to celebrate — and take advantage of. In this section, I 
explain how.
Being fiber-full and constipation-free
Constipation is nearly always  caused by diet. Regardless of your age, you 
need plenty of fiber in your diet from fruits, whole grains, vegetables, and 
legumes. Enough fluids and regular exercise are important factors, too.
Older adults develop problems with constipation when their calorie intakes 
dip too low. When you eat less, you take in less fiber. If you eat too many 
desserts and junk foods, you may be getting even less fiber. Older people are 
also notorious for being physically inactive. Both of these factors — low fiber 
intake and low activity level — can cause you to become constipated.
Constipation can be made worse if you’re taking certain medications, includ-
ing antacids made with aluminum hydroxide or calcium carbonate, or if 
you’re a habitual laxative  user.
 
If you have problems with constipation, take these steps to get moving again:
 
✓ Add fiber to your diet. Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, whole-grain 
breads and cereal products, and legumes.
 
✓ Drink fluids frequently. Water is best. You don’t have to count eight 
glasses per day, but keep a pitcher of water on your desk and a bottle 
of water in your car, and drink them regularly. Stopping for a sip every 
time you pass a water fountain is a good idea.
 
✓ Eat prunes and drink prune juice. Prunes have a laxative  effect for 
many people.
 
✓ Keep fatty foods and junk foods to a minimum. These foods are usually 
 low in fiber and will displace other foods that may contribute fiber to 
your diet.
 
✓ Hold your fat intake down. If you do, you won’t need as many antacids. 
Fat takes longer to digest than other nutrients, so it stays in the stomach 
longer and can promote indigestion and heartburn.

305
 Chapter 22: Aging Healthfully: Vegetarian Lifestyles for Adults of All Ages
 
✓ Get regular physical activity. It  keeps your muscles (including those in 
your abdomen) toned and helps prevent constipation.
Vegetarian diets tend to be lower in fat and higher in fiber than nonvegetar-
ian diets, so it’s not surprising that older vegetarians are less likely than 
 older nonvegetarians to have problems with constipation.
Heading off heartburn
Because vegetarian diets tend to be lower in fat than meat-based diets, they 
can be useful in helping to minimize problems with heartburn. If you’re a 
vegetarian and have trouble with heartburn, examine your diet. You may be 
eating too many high-fat dairy products or greasy junk foods such as chips, 
donuts, and French fries.
 
In addition to cutting the fat in your diet, you can help prevent heartburn by 
avoiding reclining immediately after a meal. If you do lie down for a nap after 
lunch, put a couple of pillows under your back so that you’re elevated at least 
30 degrees and aren’t lying flat. Avoid overeating, and try eating smaller, more 
frequent meals.
Getting a grip on gas
You may prefer to call it “flatulence.” By any name, it’s intestinal gas, which 
can be  caused by a number of things, including the higher fiber content of a 
vegetarian diet.
More than just a social problem, gas can cause discomfort in your abdo-
men, and it can cause you to belch or feel bloated. Before you incriminate 
the beans and cabbage, though, a few other causes of gas may be exacerbat-
ing your problem, including drinking carbonated beverages, swallowing too 
much air when you’re eating, and taking certain medications.
 
If you do think your diet is the problem, you have a few options. Consider 
these gas-busters:
 
✓ Single out the culprits. Beans? Cabbage? Onions? Eliminate one at a time 
until you reduce your gas production to a level you can live with. The 
foods that cause gas in one individual don’t necessarily cause gas in 
everyone else, and unfortunately, the foods that do cause gas are among 
the most nutritious.
 
✓ Try using a product such as Beano. It uses enzymes to break down some 
of the carbohydrate that causes gas. Products such as these come in 
liquid form. Squeeze a few drops on the food before you eat it. Its effec-
tiveness varies from person to person.

306
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
 
✓ Get active. People who exercise regularly  have fewer problems with gas.
 
✓ Give it time. If you’re  new to a vegetarian diet, your body will adjust to 
the increased fiber load over several weeks, and your problem with gas 
should subside.
 
✓ Avoid carbonated  beverages.
 
✓ Eat slowly and  chew your food thoroughly to minimize the amount of air 
that you take in with each bite.
Living vegetarian is good for what ails you
You’re diabetic and you follow a special diet? Maybe you’re  on a special diet 
for high blood pressure or heart disease? It doesn’t matter. A vegetarian diet 
is compatible with restrictions for any diet, and in many cases, a vegetarian 
diet is ideal for people with medical conditions.
For instance, if you have diabetes, you may be able to reduce  the amount of 
medication or insulin you take if you switch to a vegetarian diet. (Be sure to 
talk to your healthcare provider, though, before making any changes in your 
medications!) The fiber content of vegetarian diets helps to control blood 
sugar levels.
Anyone taking medications for high blood cholesterol levels should know 
that the fiber in vegetarian diets helps to lower blood cholesterol levels, too.
 
Vegetarians have weights that are closer to ideal than nonvegetarians. Weight 
control is an important component of the dietary management of diabetes, 
heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, and many other conditions.
 
There’s no reason that you can’t eat a vegetarian diet, whatever your ailment. 
If you need help adapting a vegetarian diet to your special needs, contact 
a registered dietitian with expertise  in vegetarian nutrition. The American 
Dietetic Association’s online referral service can help you find a dietitian in 
your area. Go to www.eatright.org.
Staying Active the Vegetarian Way
Regular exercise is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, and it’s 
just as important for older adults as it is for younger people. When you’re 
regularly and vigorously physically active, you burn more calories and are 
more likely to keep your weight at an ideal level.

307
 Chapter 22: Aging Healthfully: Vegetarian Lifestyles for Adults of All Ages
You can also eat more! The more food you consume, the more likely it is that 
you’ll get the nutrients you need. You’re likely to preserve more bone and 
muscle tissues, too, when you exercise regularly, especially when the activity 
is weight-bearing exercise, such as walking or using weight sets.
In this section, I explain how adults of all ages can eat for optimal athletic 
performance, whether you’re a recreational athlete or a pro.
Nourishing the weekend warrior
In this chapter, I use the term athlete to describe a  person who is vigor-
ously physically active most days of the week for extended periods of time. 
Swimmers or runners, or triathletes who are training hard, are considered 
athletes.
They are in the minority of people who are active.
 
If you go to the gym three times a week to work out on the stair climber and 
lift weights, it’s great, but you’re not an athlete. It’s also not enough activity 
to make any appreciable difference in your nutritional needs. Ditto for golfers 
and weekend warriors.
Unless your activity level rises to the level of an elite athlete, it’s unlikely that 
you need to take any special dietary measures on account of your activity.
Inspired by Murray Rose
I was 16 years old and a competitive swimmer 
when a book by Murray Rose caught my eye 
and inspired me to change my lifestyle forever. 
Murray Rose was an Australian swimmer who 
attributed his athletic endurance to his vegetar-
ian diet.
Rose was a three-time Olympic gold medal-
ist and world record holder in swimming in 
Melbourne in 1956. He won a gold medal, a 
silver medal, and another world record at the 
1960 Olympic Games in Rome. I’m not sure the 
switch to a vegetarian diet improved my own 
athletic performance, but it didn’t hurt, and the 
diet stuck.
Rose was an athlete. I was, too — then. I prac-
ticed hard for two hours every day, after which I 
would swim two lengths of the high school pool 
underwater. If I tried that today, I’d need the 
Emergency Medical Service.

Giving elite athletes the edge
Like everyone, an athlete’s diet should consist primarily of carbohydrates, 
with adequate amounts of protein and fat. Can athletes do well on a veg-
etarian diet? You bet. Just ask vegetarian baseball player Prince Fielder 
(Milwaukee Brewers); basketball players Salim Stoudamire (Milwaukee 
Bucks) and Raja Bell (Charlotte Bobcats); football player Ricky Williams 
(Miami Dolphins); legendary track star Carl Lewis; and mixed martial arts 
fighter Mac Danzig.
Experts have different opinions about how much  protein athletes need. Some 
question whether physical activity level affects the body’s need for protein at 
all. Others feel that increased physical activity level does necessitate higher 
levels of protein, depending on the kind of activity. The extra protein isn’t 
needed primarily for muscle development, though, as you may think. Instead, 
it’s needed to compensate for the protein that athletes burn up as fuel.
Some athletes need a tremendous number of calories to meet their energy 
needs, and if they don’t have enough fuel from carbohydrates and fats, their 
bodies turn to protein for energy. When that happens, they need extra pro-
tein in their diets so that enough will be available for building and repairing 
tissues.
Because athletes need more calories than people who are less active, they 
tend to consume more protein in the extra food they eat. If you’re an athlete, 
just getting enough calories to meet your energy needs and eating a reason-
able variety of foods is probably enough in itself to ensure   that you get the 
protein you need.
This is especially true for endurance athletes, such as swimmers, cyclists, 
runners, and triathletes. If you’re into strength training (weight lifting, wres-
tling, or football, for example), you need to be more aware of getting enough 
protein-rich foods in your diet, especially if your calorie intake is low.
Any athlete restricting calories to lose weight while training should also be 
more careful to get enough protein. The lower your calorie intake, the harder 
it is to get what you need and the less room there is for junk.
 
A little protein is a good thing, but too much isn’t. In times past, it was a tradi-
tion for coaches to serve their football players big steaks at the training table 
before games. A baked potato with butter and sour cream and a tossed salad 
with gobs of high-fat dressing rounded out the meal. High-protein, high-fat 
meals like that actually make players sluggish and are generally bad for your 
health. Instead of a steak, athletes are better off   with a big plate of spaghetti 
with tomato sauce, a heaping helping of stir-fry with vegetables and tofu, or 
bean burritos with rice and vegetables.

309
 Chapter 22: Aging Healthfully: Vegetarian Lifestyles for Adults of All Ages
Crunching the carbs
A diet that consists primarily of carbohydrates — vegetables, pasta, rice and 
other grains and grain products, fruits, and legumes — promotes an athlete’s 
stamina and results in better performance. Athletes who restrict their carbo-
hydrate intake show poorer performance levels. It isn’t surprising, then, that 
vegetarian diets have advantages for athletes, because vegetarian diets tend 
to consist primarily of carbohydrate-rich foods.
Athletes used to “carb load” before an event. They would restrict their car-
bohydrate intake and load up on fat and protein for a few days, and then they 
would gorge on carbohydrate-rich foods for a couple days just before the 
event. The idea was that this method would maximize their muscles’ storage 
of fuel and result in better performance. Now we know that it’s more effec-
tive just to  eat a high-carbohydrate diet all the time. Most vegetarians are, in 
effect, in a constant state of carbohydrate loading.
 
When you eat a diet that’s high   in carbohydrates, your body stores some of 
it in your muscles and liver in a form of sugar called glycogen. Your body taps 
into its stockpile of glycogen for energy during athletic events. Whether you 
engage in endurance events such as swimming and cycling or in shorter, high-
intensity activities such as running a sprint or the high hurdles, your muscle 
and liver glycogen stores are a vital energy supply and a critical determinant 
of your ability to perform your best.
Getting enough calories and carbohydrate in your diet helps to ensure that 
the protein in  your diet is available for the growth and repair of tissues and 
that it doesn’t have to be sacrificed and burned for fuel. But not just any car-
bohydrates will do.
 
Soft drinks, candy, snack cakes, and other junk foods consist mainly of carbo-
hydrates, but these are empty-calorie foods. Anyone who depends on their 
diet to help them feel and perform their best needs to take pains not to let the 
junk displace nutrient-dense foods from their diet. Junk-food forms of carbo-
hydrates do provide calories, so they can help keep your body from needing 
to burn protein for fuel. But you need the nutrients in the more wholesome 
foods, too. You’ve got to look at the big picture, not just a little piece of it.
Good choices for carbohydrates include
 
✓ All fruits
 
✓ All vegetables
 
✓ Beans
 
✓ Breads
 
✓ Cold and hot cereals
 
✓ Lentils
 
✓ Pasta

310
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
 
✓ Potatoes
 
✓ Rice
 
✓ Soymilk
Some athletes have tremendously high calorie needs, and many   carbohy-
drate-rich foods are bulky. They can be so filling that some athletes can get 
full at meals before taking in enough calories. If this is your experience, go 
ahead and include some low-fiber, refined foods in your diet, despite the fact 
that most other people need more fiber. For instance, you may choose to eat 
refined breakfast cereals or white bread instead of whole-grain products.
Meeting vitamin and mineral needs
Generally speaking, a well-planned vegetarian diet that emphasizes adequate 
calories and variety and limits the junk should provide athletes with all the 
nutrients they need. Under certain circumstances, though, a few nutrients 
may deserve some special attention.
 
✓ Calcium: Athletes have the  same needs for calcium as nonathletes, but 
some female athletes who train intensely may be at risk if their level of 
training causes amenorrhea, the  cessation of regular menstrual cycles.
 
 Amenorrhea isn’t caused by vegetarian diets; any female athlete may 
stop having periods when training too intensely. Like postmenopausal 
women, amenorrheal women have reduced levels of estrogen, and that 
can lead to accelerated loss of calcium from the bones.
 
 Several factors affect bone health, and the amount of calcium you 
absorb and retain from your diet is more significant than how much 
calcium your diet contains in the first place. Nevertheless, if you’re a 
female athlete who has stopped having periods or who skips periods, 
the recommendations for calcium intake are higher for you. That means 
you need to push the calcium-rich  foods and make less room in your 
diet for junk. (See Chapter 3 for more information about calcium.)
 
✓ Iron: All athletes — vegetarian or not — are at an  increased risk of iron 
deficiency due to iron losses in the body that occur with prolonged, 
vigorous activity. Female endurance athletes are at the greatest risk, as 
are athletes who have low iron stores. (See Chapter 3 for a refresher on 
iron.) You don’t need to take a supplement unless blood tests show that 
you need one. Men, in particular, should avoid taking unnecessary iron 
supplements because of the connection between high intakes of iron 
and coronary artery disease.
 
✓ Other vitamins and minerals: Vegans, in particular,  need to have a reli-
able source of vitamin B12 in their diets. Some studies also show that 
exercise raises all athletes’ needs for riboflavin and zinc. The most prac-
tical advice for any athlete is simply to do your best to eat well to help 
ensure you get what you need.

311
 Chapter 22: Aging Healthfully: Vegetarian Lifestyles for Adults of All Ages
Meal planning for peak performance
Whether you’re in training or getting ready for an athletic event, what you eat 
and when you eat it can make a difference in your level of performance.
 
Here are a few pointers for vegetarian athletes, or any athlete wanting to maxi-
mize  athletic performance:
 
✓ If your calorie needs are high, add snacks between meals. Dried fruit 
mixtures, bagels, fresh fruit, soup and crackers, hot or cold cereal with 
soymilk, a half sandwich, soy yogurt or a smoothie, a bean burrito, or 
baked beans with toast are all excellent choices.
 
✓ If you have trouble getting enough calories with meals and snacks, 
reduce your intake of the bulkiest foods, such as salad greens and low-
calorie vegetables, and eat more starchy vegetables such as potatoes, 
sweet potatoes, peas, beans, and lentils. Liquids can be an especially 
efficient way to add extra calories — try fruit or soy yogurt shakes and 
smoothies. Make your own blends, using wheat germ, soy yogurt and 
soymilk, and frozen or fresh fruit. Remember, too, that some added veg-
etable fats can be fine for athletes who need a compact source of extra 
calories.
 
✓ Take a portable snack in your gym bag, backpack, or bike pack for imme-
diately after your workout to replace carbohydrates and protein and 
provide calories. Fresh fruit, a sports bar, a bagel, or a package of crack-
ers and bottle of fruit juice are good choices.
 
✓ Keep fluids with you when you work out — fruit juice or bottled water 
are best.
 
✓ Don’t work out when you’re hungry. Your session will suffer. Take a 
break and have a light snack first.
 
✓ If you get the pre-event jitters, eat only foods that are easy to digest and 
low in fiber. Some athletes who get too nervous to eat any solid food 
before an event may find that it’s possible to drink a smoothie or  eat 
some nonfat or soy yogurt.
The following sections give you specific diet information to follow before, 
during, and after your athletic events.
Before an athletic event
If you generally eat a high-carbohydrate vegetarian diet, you’re ahead of the 
game already. When it  gets closer to the time of the event in which you’ll be 
competing, it’s time to pull a few more tricks out of your sleeve.
In the hours before the event, you want to eat foods that are easy to digest 
and will keep your energy level up. High-carbohydrate foods are good 
choices, but now’s the time to minimize your fat and protein intakes. Fat, in 
particular, takes longer to digest than other nutrients. You want your stom-
ach to empty quickly to give your food time to get to the intestines, where it 

312
Part V: Living Vegetarian for a Lifetime 
can be absorbed before you burst into action. That’s the reason to keep your 
fat intake low at this point. Avoiding foods that are concentrated in protein is 
also a good idea immediately before an event because protein also takes a bit 
longer to digest than carbohydrate. That leaves fruits, vegetables, and grains 
as the best choices in the hours before an event.
It’s also a good idea to avoid foods that are excessively high in sodium or 
salt because these foods can make you retain fluids, which may impair your 
performance or make you feel less than your best. Foods that are especially 
high in fiber are probably best saved for after the event, too, because you’ll 
probably want your large intestine to be as empty as possible during the 
event. High-fiber foods can cause some people to have diarrhea and others to 
become constipated before athletic events, especially when they’re anxious.
 
The best rule is to give yourself one hour before the event for every 200 calo-
ries of food you eat, up to about 800 calories. In other words, if you eat a meal 
that contains 400 calories, it’s best to eat   it two hours before the event.
Here are some good pre-event light meal and snack ideas:
 
✓ A bagel with jam
 
✓ A banana and several graham crackers
 
✓ A bowl of cereal with soymilk
 
✓ Cooked vegetables over steamed rice
 
✓ Pancakes or waffles with syrup
 
✓ Pasta tossed with cooked vegetables or  topped with marinara sauce
 
✓ A soymilk and fruit smoothie
 
✓ Toast or English muffins and 1 cup of soy yogurt
 
✓ A tomato sandwich and a glass of fruit juice
During an athletic event
Have you ever played a set of tennis in the blazing sun on a   hot summer day, 
or paddled a canoe or kayak for several hours on a river in the middle of 
August? If so, you may have needed as much as 2 cups of water every 15 min-
utes to replace the fluids your body lost during heavy exercise in the extreme 
heat. Many athletes don’t pay enough attention to fluid replacement, yet it’s 
critical to your health and optimal performance.
 
It’s important to drink 1⁄2 to 1 cup of water every 10 to 20 minutes while you’re 
exercising and, when possible, when you’re competing. If you’re working out 
in a gym, make it a point to take frequent breaks to visit the water fountain. 
One good gulp or several sips can equal 1⁄2 to 1 cup of water. In other settings, 
keep a water bottle with you on a nearby bench, in your boat, or strapped to 
your bike.

313
 Chapter 22: Aging Healthfully: Vegetarian Lifestyles for Adults of All Ages
Water is the best choice for exercise sessions or athletic events that last up 
to 90 minutes. After that, there’s a benefit to getting some carbohydrates in 
addition to the water to help boost your blood sugar and prolong the period 
of time before your muscles tire out. Eating or drinking carbohydrates sooner 
may also be of some benefit when the activity is of very high intensity, such 
as racquetball or weight training.
In these situations, it’s a good idea to aim for about 30 to 80 grams of carbo-
hydrates per hour. Sports drinks are fine for this purpose and may be more 
convenient than eating solid food. An added advantage is that they provide 
fluid as well as carbohydrates. For most brands of commercial sports drinks, 
that means aiming for 1⁄2 to 1 cup every 15 minutes, or twice as much every 1⁄2 
hour. In lieu of commercial sports drinks, you may prefer to drink fruit juice 
diluted 1:1 with water. For example, mix 2 cups of apple juice or cranberry 
juice with 2 cups of water, and drink it over a 1-hour period.
Fruit is also a good choice for a carbohydrate boost. A large banana contains 
at  least 30 grams of carbohydrates, and so do two small oranges.
After an athletic event
After the event or  exercise session, protein can come back to your table. You 
need protein for the repair of any damaged muscles. Your body also needs to 
replenish its stores of muscle and liver glycogen, amino acids, and fluids. So 
calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fluids are all very important immediately 
after an athletic event. The sooner you begin to replace these nutrients, the 
better. In fact, studies have shown that your body is more efficient at sock-
ing away glycogen in the minutes and hours immediately following the event 
than it is if you wait several hours before eating.

f you need any more persuading to become a vegetarian, this chapter lists 
ten sound reasons for making the switch.
Talk to veteran vegetarians and you’ll probably discover that they were first 
compelled to kick the meat habit by one of these reasons. After they started 
on the vegetarian path, other reasons gradually became apparent, adding 
conviction to the original decision.
Which of these reasons speaks to you?
Vegetarian Diets Are Low in Saturated 
Fat and Cholesterol
Generally speaking, vegetarian diets  tend to be lower in total fat, saturated 
fat, and cholesterol than nonvegetarian diets. The fewer animal products 
in the diet, the less saturated fat and cholesterol the diet usually contains. 
This lower intake of saturated fat and cholesterol probably contributes to 
the decreased rates of coronary artery disease in vegetarians compared to 
nonvegetarians. Vegan diets are generally lower in saturated fat than lacto or 
lacto ovo vegetarian diets, and vegan diets contain zero cholesterol. (Chapter 
1 tells you more about the differences between these varying types of veg-
etarian diets.)

Vegetarian Diets Are Rich in Fiber, 
Phytochemicals, and Health-
Supporting Nutrients
Unless you’re a junk food vegetarian, you’re likely to get far more dietary 
fiber on a vegetarian diet than a diet that includes meat.
Fiber-rich vegetarian foods provide the bulk that helps prevent constipation, 
hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and diverticulosis. Bean burritos, lentil soup, 
pasta primavera, vegetable stir-fry, and four-bean salad are a few examples. 
Find easy recipes for all these and more in Part III.
 
Fruit-, grain-, and vegetable-rich vegetarian diets are also high in beneficial 
vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals such as vitamins E and C, selenium, 
beta carotene, lycopene, and isoflavones, which promote and protect your 
health when you get them naturally from whole foods. These substances are 
associated with many of the health advantages of vegetarian diets, including a 
decreased risk for coronary artery disease and cancer.
Vegetarians Are Skinnier
Because vegetarian diets tend to contain lots of bulky fiber foods, the diet 
helps you fill up before you fill out. In other words, you stop eating  before 
you take in too many calories, because you feel full sooner. Therefore, veg-
etarians are usually leaner than nonvegetarians. Who needs fancy weight-loss 
diets when you can be a vegetarian and stay slim the easiest, and healthiest, 
way of all?
Vegetarians Are Healthier
Not surprisingly, vegetarian diets are associated with a long list of health 
advantages. Not only are vegetarians slimmer and less prone to coronary 
artery disease, but they also have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels, lower blood pressure, lower overall cancer rates, and lower rates of 
type 2 diabetes.
Science suggests that several characteristics of vegetarian diets are respon-
sible for these health advantages, including lower intakes of saturated fat and 

319
 Chapter 23: Ten Sound Reasons for Going Vegetarian
cholesterol and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy 
foods, and beneficial substances such as the aforementioned dietary fiber 
and phytochemicals.
Vegetarian Diets Are Good 
for the Environment
Livestock grazing causes desertification of the land by causing  erosion of the 
topsoil and drying out of the land. Topsoil is being destroyed faster than it 
can be created because of people’s appetite for meat. All over the world, irre-
placeable trees and forests are being lost to make way for cattle grazing. By 
eating a vegetarian diet, you can help to minimize this devastation.
But that’s not all. Animal agriculture is one  of the greatest threats to the 
world’s supply of fresh water. Factory farms suck up tremendous quantities 
of water from aquifers deep beneath the earth’s surface to irrigate grazing 
lands for livestock. Animal agriculture also pollutes rivers and streams by 
contaminating water supplies with pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used 
to grow food for the animals. Nitrogenous fecal waste from the animals them-
selves compounds the problem. By choosing a vegetarian lifestyle, you can 
do your part not to support this contamination.
The production of meat, eggs, and dairy products also  makes intensive and 
extensive use of fossil fuels (like oil) to transport animal feed and animals 
and also to run the machinery on the factory farms where animals are raised. 
By eating fewer animal products, you can do your part to conserve fossil 
fuels by not supporting the production and distribution of animal-derived 
goods or food.
Vegetarian Diets Are Less Expensive
Sure, if you opt to buy all your groceries at gourmet stores or the ready-made 
food section of your local deli, your vegetarian diet can soon become more 
expensive than a diet that includes meat.
But assuming you eat most of your meals at home and take reasonable care 
to shop for value, eating vegetarian is an inherently economical way to go. 
Wholesome, simple vegetarian meals made from fresh, frozen, or canned 
vegetables and fruits, whole-grain breads and cereals, dried or canned beans 
and peas, and a smattering of seeds and nuts are all you need. It costs less to 
build a meal from these ingredients than it does to make meat the focal point 
of the plate.

Vegetarian Diets Are More Efficient
Vegetarian diets can sustain more people than diets that center on   meat 
and other animal products. That’s because it takes far more food energy for 
an animal to produce a pound of meat or a cup of milk than humans get in 
return when they eat those foods.
 
Eating plants directly — rather than eating them after they’ve passed through 
animals first — is a more sustainable and efficient way to nourish the world.
Vegetarian Diets Are the 
Compassionate Choice
The philosopher and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Albert Schweitzer  said, “Until 
he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not 
himself find peace.”
And the great artist Leonardo da Vinci said, “I have from an early age abjured 
the use of meat, and the time will come when men such as I will look on the 
murder of animals as they now look on the murder of men.”
Enough said?
Vegetarian Foods Are Diverse 
and Delicious
Vegetarians often hear, “If you don’t eat meat, what do you eat?” If meat 
eaters only knew. . . .
The variety in food is in the colorful, flavorful, healthful plant kingdom. 
Cultures around the world serve satisfying and nutritious dishes such as cur-
ried vegetables, garlicky pasta, savory spinach pies, thick soups, and spicy 
couscous mixtures made with a mouth-watering assortment of fresh, meat-
less ingredients.
 
Endless combinations of these foods prepared in creative ways make vegetar-
ian meals exciting. See the recipes in Part III for some suggestions to get you 
started cooking the vegetarian way.

321
 Chapter 23: Ten Sound Reasons for Going Vegetarian
Vegetarian Diets Set a Good 
Example for Children
Your children notice what you eat. They learn through the models they expe-
rience at home and at school. The dietary practices they adopt when they’re 
young carry forward into their adult lives. Who doesn’t want the best for 
their children?
Children everywhere are at high risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases 
such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. 
Consider, too, that they’ll inherit this earth someday. Encouraging your chil-
dren to move toward a vegetarian diet is one way to support their health and 
the health of their world.

Ten Simple Substitutes 
for Vegetarian Dishes
In This Chapter
▶ Making recipes dairy-free
▶ Using convenient meat-free ingredients
▶ Substituting stocks in soups
S
ometimes, all that stands between a traditional meat eater’s meal and a 
vegetarian version is one small ingredient. With the creative use of alter-
natives, you can modernize an old family favorite to accommodate every-
one’s food preferences, with delicious results!
You’ll be surprised at the ways you can accomplish these substitutions. In 
most cases, even the most discerning foodie won’t mind the difference. In 
fact, kitchen wizards may be stunned to discover the tricks I describe in this 
chapter. For example, how many people know that you can swap mashed 
banana for an egg in quick breads and cookies? Or that you can fool your 
friends by using tofu instead of egg whites in your favorite recipe for an egg 
salad sandwich?
You may take for granted that you need eggs, milk, and butter to make baked 
goods, or that spaghetti sauce and sloppy Joes require ground beef, or that 
vegetarian foods look, smell, or taste “different” from the foods to which 
you’re accustomed.
It doesn’t have to be that way. Use the easy techniques I show you in this 
chapter to assist you in your menu makeovers. I list them roughly in the 
order in which I think you’ll use them — from those you’ll use most often to 
those you may use less often.
In some examples, I show you easy ways to work the meat out. In others, I 
show how simple it is to work out other animal ingredients such as dairy 
products and eggs, depending on the extent to which you want to avoid 
animal ingredients.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Replace Eggs with Mashed Bananas
Replacing eggs with mashed bananas is a no-brainer, as well as a great way to 
use up those bananas that have gone from just right to too brown.
 
In recipes that call for an egg, you can use half of a ripe, mashed banana in 
place of one whole egg. This trick works best in recipes for foods such as pan-
cakes and muffins in which you wouldn’t mind a mild banana flavor. Add 1 to 2 
tablespoons of a liquid — soymilk, fruit juice, or water, for example — for each 
egg omitted to restore the recipe to its original moisture content. Because 
banana tastes best in foods that are slightly sweet — pancakes, cookies, and 
muffins — adding sweet liquids such as vanilla soymilk or fruit juice generally 
works fine. If in doubt, though, use an unsweetened liquid such as any unfla-
vored milk or water.
 
I don’t recommend this substitution for recipes that rely on eggs to provide 
lift, as many cakes or a soufflé require. Flat foods such as pancakes, waffles, 
and cookies, and even dense baked goods such as quick breads and muffins, 
are perfect candidates for the banana trick, though.
Substitute Soymilk or Rice Milk 
for Cow’s Milk in Any Recipe
You can use soymilk or rice milk (or any other kind of nondairy milk) cup for 
cup instead of cow’s milk in most recipes. Nobody will know the difference.
Use plain or vanilla flavor in sweet dishes such as rice pudding and smooth-
ies. Use plain soymilk or rice milk in savory recipes like mashed potatoes and 
cream soups.
 
Replacing cow’s milk in recipes is an easy way to cut the saturated fat con-
tent and make foods such as puddings and soups appropriate for vegans and 
people who are lactose intolerant.
Use Vegetable Broth in Place of 
Chicken Stock and Beef Broth
A savory broth is the foundation for many soup recipes. But even vegetable 
soups — such as minestrone, barley, potato and leek, navy bean, and 
others — are often made with chicken or beef stock, rendering the recipe out 
of the question for vegetarians. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Replacing 

325
 Chapter 24: Ten Simple Substitutes for Vegetarian Dishes
chicken or beef broth with vegetable broth is one of the easiest ways to con-
vert a nonvegetarian soup to a version that works for everyone.
Vegetable broths are widely available in a variety of flavors and forms. My 
favorites, because of their convenience and flavor, are those packaged in asep-
tic, shelf-stable boxes sold in many supermarkets and natural foods stores. 
Bouillon cubes, powders, and canned vegetable broths are also available.
 
Of course, you can also save money by making your own from scratch at 
home. You don’t need a recipe, because there’s no need for precision. First, 
save vegetable scraps — carrots, onions, celery, bell peppers, and others — in 
an airtight container in the freezer. When you’re ready, simmer them in a large 
pot of water for at least an hour. Salt and pepper to taste, and drain. After the 
broth cools down to room temperature, you can freeze it in ice cube trays and 
save the little blocks of broth to use later as needed.
Plain vegetable broth works well in most soup recipes, adding just the right 
amount of richness and flavor. For a change of pace, try using other mixtures 
available in stores, including tomato and red pepper, ginger carrot, and other 
tasty variations.
Stir in Soy Crumbles Instead 
of Ground Meat
In some recipes, your guests won’t know the difference between ground beef 
and soy crumbles. Not that your bean burritos or meatless spaghetti sauce 
need the extra ingredient, but if you’re aiming for the flavor, look, and feel of 
fillings and sauces made with ground beef, meatless soy crumbles and similar 
products are an excellent choice. Use them in the same way you used ground 
beef or ground turkey in the past. You can brown the crumbles in a skillet or 
just toss them into a pot of sauce while it’s heating.
 
Find soy crumbles in the freezer section of most supermarkets and natural 
foods stores. Boca and Morningstar Farms are two popular brands.
Make a Nondairy Version of 
Ricotta or Cottage Cheese
Italian favorites like lasagna, manicotti, and stuffed shell pasta are familiar 
crowd-pleasers. If you make a good-tasting and versatile substitute for ricotta 
or cottage cheese, your traditional recipes can be suitable for anyone who 
prefers a nondairy alternative.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Making the substitution for ricotta or cottage cheese is simple. Just mash a 
block of tofu — any firmness will do — and add a few teaspoons of lemon 
juice. Mix well. You can mix with your clean hands if you find it helps distrib-
ute the lemon juice more evenly throughout the tofu.
Then, simply proceed with your recipe as usual, incorporating your 
substitution.
Add fresh, spicy marinara sauce, a crisp green salad, and crusty bread to 
round out your revamped recipe and make a complete meal.
Take Advantage of Soy “Bacon” 
and “Sausage”
Soy “bacon” and soy “sausage” have come a long way since food companies 
first tried to replicate the texture and flavor of the real things. Now they’re 
better than their meat counterparts, because they not only taste great but 
also are free of nasty nitrates and contain less sodium than the original, 
with little or no saturated fat and cholesterol. Many of these products are 
seasoned to taste just like their meat counterparts. Others may taste slightly 
different or have a different texture. Experiment to see which brands you like 
best.
 
Use soy-based products such as Lightlife Fakin’ Bacon and Smart Bacon, or 
Morningstar Farms Veggie Bacon Strips, to make a new-fashioned BLT sand-
wich. Crumble them over a spinach salad and stir them into German-style 
potato salad. The same companies make veggie sausage patties and links that 
you can serve with pancakes and waffles. Use sausage crumbles on pizza, 
or make a healthier sausage biscuit by serving a patty on a toasted English 
muffin.
There’s no going back. Trust me.
Top a Tofu Hot Dog with Vegetarian Chili
Veggie dogs are here to stay — they’re that good. You can grill them, boil 
them, or heat them in the microwave oven. Serve them in a whole-wheat bun 
or sliced into a pot of baked beans. Top one with some meatless bean chili 
(you can find the recipe for my Cashew Chili in Chapter 11) and a scoop of 
freshly minced onions or slaw.

327
 Chapter 24: Ten Simple Substitutes for Vegetarian Dishes
Try Lightlife Tofu Pups or Smart Dogs, Morningstar Farms America’s Original 
Veggie Dogs, and Yves hot dogs and brats.
Why not enjoy your first health-supporting chili dog? Have two.
Create a Nondairy Substitute 
for Buttermilk
Buttermilk adds a tangy flavor to pancakes, biscuits, and creamy salad dress-
ings. You can get the same effect without the saturated fat by making your 
own using plain soymilk or rice milk.
 
Just add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of plain soymilk, 
rice milk, or other nondairy milk. Stir, and use this mixture cup for cup in 
place of regular buttermilk made from cow’s milk. The acid in the lemon juice 
or vinegar lends the tangy flavor of buttermilk. No need to wait for the milk to 
clabber or curdle the way traditional buttermilk is made, though the milk may 
thicken slightly if left for a few days before using.
Add Flaxseeds Instead of Eggs
 
If you want to replace eggs with flaxseeds, here’s what to do: Using a small 
whisk, whip 1 tablespoon of finely ground flaxseeds with 1⁄4 cup of water. This 
mixture replaces one whole egg. Double it if the recipe calls for two eggs.
That’s all there is to it! The flaxseeds gel and bind with the other ingredients 
in the recipe, sticking everything together, just like an egg would do. It’s also 
a nice way to add some heart-healthy omega-3s to your diet.
 
This substitution works well in a variety of recipes whether sweet or savory, 
including quick breads, muffins, casseroles, and loaves. Don’t use it in recipes 
for foods that rely on eggs for lift, though, including many cakes and soufflés.
Swap Tofu for Hard-Boiled Eggs
Love an old-fashioned egg salad sandwich but want to avoid eggs? No 
problem.
In traditional recipes, hard-boiled eggs are mashed and mixed with mayo and 
a little mustard. Some recipes call for minced celery or a teaspoon of pickle 
relish.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Follow your favorite recipe, but replace the egg with an equal amount of firm 
or extra-firm silken tofu. You can even use eggless mayonnaise in place of reg-
ular mayonnaise to make this filling suitable for vegans. I include a sample 
Tofu Salad recipe in Chapter 11.

Ten Vegetarian Lunchbox Ideas
In This Chapter
▶ Packing portable meals and snacks
▶ Taking advantage of leftovers
▶ Thinking outside the (lunch) box
P
acking your own lunch can save you money and is likely to be healthier 
than a meal you buy in a restaurant or from a vending machine. But 
coming up with fresh ideas for tasty foods to take to work or school can be a 
challenge, whether you’re a vegetarian or not.
Free your mind to be creative; creativity is key to packing an appealing bag 
lunch. Who says you must have a main course, or that lunch has to include a 
sandwich, an apple, and a bag of chips?
Try some of these delicious ideas and look forward to lunch again.
Almond Butter Sandwich with 
Granny Smith Apple Slices 
on Whole-Wheat Bread
Get creative — you can find alternatives to peanut butter. Almond butter is 
one example.
To make an almond butter sandwich with Granny Smith apple slices, start 
with two slices of whole-wheat bread. Top one slice with a sticky smear of 
almond butter. Add thinly sliced apple, finish with the second slice of bread, 
and cut diagonally into quarters for four little tea sandwiches. These sand-
wiches are perfect with a serving of leftover pasta salad and a cup of hot tea.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
For a change of pace, soy butter, cashew butter, and pumpkin butter make 
good alternatives to peanut butter. Other ingredients you can substitute or 
add to the mix include pear, banana, fruit compote, or preserves.
Bean Burrito
To make a tasty bean burrito, start with a flour tortilla and add a scoop of 
black beans or refried pinto beans. Add chopped lettuce and tomato or a 
handful of tossed salad from last night’s dinner. What’s nice is that you can 
vary the burrito at the same time that you use up leftovers.
You don’t have to stop there. Add leftover cooked vegetables or the odd 
serving of cooked rice. If you like salsa or black olives, include those, too.
Fold up one end of the tortilla, and then roll the whole thing into a neat 
package. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil or waxed paper. When you’re ready 
to eat, heat and serve. If the idea of warm lettuce bothers you, leave it out 
or add it later.
 
My favorite burrito recipe includes mashed sweet potatoes as an option. Find 
the recipe in Chapter 12.
Easy Wraps
Like burritos and pita pocket sandwiches, wraps are a handy sandwich 
style because they envelope loose ingredients and help to keep them from 
falling out.
Use a large flour tortilla or a Middle Eastern, lahvash-style flatbread to make a 
hummus wrap. (See Chapter 10 for a recipe to make your own hummus.) I like 
to use hummus as the base because you don’t need to warm it before eating, 
and its stickiness helps bind it with other ingredients, such as leftover salad, 
chopped tomatoes, grated carrots, black olives, sprouts, and cooked rice.
Sliced low-fat cheese or tempeh strips also make good bases for a wrap sand-
wich. Add your favorite ingredients, leaving a few inches free of filling on the 
far end of the bread. Begin rolling from the end closest to you. Extra filling 
will be squeezed onto the bare end that you strategically left for that pur-
pose. A tightly wrapped sandwich holds together well, but rolling it in waxed 
paper or aluminum foil helps it survive intact in a backpack or lunchbox until 
mealtime.

331
 Chapter 25: Ten Vegetarian Lunchbox Ideas
Fresh Fruit Salad with Nonfat 
Vanilla Yogurt
In contrast to the granola parfait (see the next section for details), this light, 
one-dish meal is mostly fresh fruit.
Use whatever’s in season — melon balls, blueberries, peach slices, strawber-
ries, or cut-up apples with raisins and cinnamon. Toss fruit with a simple 
dressing made by mixing nonfat, plain, vanilla, or lemon yogurt with a few 
tablespoons of orange juice and 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey. This is a no-
measure recipe. Use enough yogurt to make a creamy dressing to coat the 
fruit, and add just enough juice and honey to thin and sweeten the dressing 
to your liking.
 
A big bowl of fresh fruit may be all you need during a day spent sitting at your 
computer. Fruit is a nutritious, filling, and hydrating choice.
Granola Parfait
Make a granola parfait by using plain or flavored nonfat yogurt and your 
favorite granola. Simply alternate layers of yogurt and cereal in a narrow 
glass or plastic cup with a snug lid. This works especially well with plain, 
vanilla, or lemon yogurt, and you can substitute soy yogurt for yogurt made 
with cow’s milk, too.
 
For extra pizzazz, add sliced strawberries, bananas, peaches, melon, or 
blueberries. Add a shot of nutrients by sprinkling a tablespoon of wheat 
germ on top.
This works well for a portable breakfast on the run, too.
Leftovers from Last Night’s Dinner
Yesterday’s vegetable curry or pasta primavera makes a great lunch tomor-
row. Round out the meal with a chunky slice of good bread and a piece of 
fresh fruit. Other tasty vegetarian dinners that reheat and transport well for 
tomorrow’s lunch include

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Beans and rice
 
✓ Macaroni and cheese casserole
 
✓ Spinach pie (Greek spanakopita)
 
✓ Vegetable lasagna
 
✓ Vegetable pizza
 
✓ Vegetable stir-fry
 
✓ Vegetarian chili
Pita Pocket Sandwich
The nice thing about pita pockets is the way they keep crumbly or messy 
ingredients all together and off your lap. Buy whole-wheat pita bread instead 
of white: It tastes better and is more nutritious.
Fill a pita pocket with tofu salad and baby spinach leaves, hummus, and 
shredded carrots; baked beans and coleslaw; or tossed salad with a drizzling 
of vinaigrette dressing. You can find the recipe for hummus in Chapter 10 and 
one for tofu salad in Chapter 11.
 
Use waxed paper to wrap your pockets tightly and keep the ingredients intact 
until you’re ready to eat.
Soup Cup
Single-serving soup cups are light and easy to carry. All they require when 
you’re ready to eat is a source of hot water and a spoon. Peel back the top, 
add piping hot water, stir, and enjoy.
Complement a steamy soup cup with a few whole-grain crackers and a cool-
ing side of fresh fruit salad.
Another variation on the theme: Try a hot cereal cup when you don’t have 
time to eat before you leave home in the morning. Tote it to the office and 
enjoy it as you ease into your day. Hot oatmeal and multigrain hot cereals are 
appropriate and healthful alternatives for any meal.

333
 Chapter 25: Ten Vegetarian Lunchbox Ideas
Vegetarian Chili
Like hot soup or cooked cereal, vegetarian chili is hearty and portable. Carry 
it in a squatty Thermos or in a glass container that you can place in a micro-
wave oven for reheating.
Whole-grain crackers make good scoops for hot chili in lieu of a spoon. 
Cucumber slices with ranch dressing dip round out this easy meal.
 
I include my favorite vegetarian chili recipe — Cashew Chili — in Chapter 11.
Veggie Burger on a Bun
Assemble your burger before you leave home. Heat the patty and place it in 
a whole-grain bun. Pack lettuce and a tomato slice separately and add them 
when you’re ready to eat. Packing the burger fully assembled risks a soggy 
sandwich.
Add mustard and ketchup, or vary it by topping your burger with salsa or a 
scoop of corn relish or mango chutney. Pack a side of crispy carrots and bell 
pepper slices.
Veggie burgers on a bun even taste good cold. Many brands and varieties are 
available to choose from to suit most anyone’s taste. Experiment with several 
to find those you like the best.
