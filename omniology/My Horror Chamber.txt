Preface
Preface
Many years ago when I was teaching a class in Functional Analysis at the Technical University of
Denmark, I was quite often challenged by my students who would ask: “If we make the following
assumptions is it then possible to conclude some desired result not in the textbooks?” The answer was
usually “no”, though sometimes the questions also struck some unexpected positive results. Anyway,
I always had to prepare a proof or counter-example for the following lecture. In this way a large
collection of strange examples in Mathematics grew up. One of my students, Eske Rahn, called this
collection The Horror Chamber of Mathematics. This explains the title of this book.
The purpose of this book is to show that Mathematics and even Calculus can be very diﬃcult to
handle with lots of unexpected results, so one cannot just rely on some standardized exercises. I still
remember my ﬁrst encounter with such a strange example, which was not in my elementary books in
Mathematics. I had bought the newly published book of Riesz & Sz.–Nagy [47], in which I for the
ﬁrst time came across a singular function in the form of a continuous and strictly increasing function,
which is diﬀerentiable “almost everywhere”, and whenever it is diﬀerentiable, its diﬀerential quotient
is 0. In other words, if we ﬁrst diﬀerentiate this function, and then take the Lebesque integral of the
result, we just get 0 and not the original function! This means that diﬀerentiation and integration
are not always the inverse of each other. Such examples force the reader to think in an alternative
way instead of using the standard procedures. Without going into details, it can be mentioned that it
is the operation of diﬀerentiation, which is the villain and not the Lebesque integral. Unfortunately,
the traditional teaching gives the impression that diﬀerentiation is easy, while integration is an art,
to quote a professor from one of his lectures in the early 1960s. It should be added that the singular
functions were known long before the 1960s. The subject was not included in the usual elementary
courses.
Such weird examples can be used for inspiration of thinking in a new and diﬀerent way. One example
is the clearly convergent integral

π
2
0
dx
1 + tanα x
for any ﬁxed α ∈R.
It is not diﬃcult to calculate the integral for α = 0, 1, 2, and the result is in all cases the same, namely
π/4. A head-on approach in the general case is doomed to fail, and computer programs like MAPLE
are also in trouble, though one gets a result as a decimal fraction. We need an idea, and the idea is
to change variable to t = π/2 −x and then use the symmetry. In fact,

One may of course add this result to the catalogue of known integrals in MAPLE, but then one
just constructs another example which MAPLE does not recognize and which can be solved by some
nonstandard mathematical argument. The point is that Kurt G¨odel in 1931 proved his famous theorem
which implies that there will always exist mathematical problems which the given version of MAPLE
cannot solve. The reader should therefore be aware of that sometimes the standard procedures of
solving problems are not suﬃcient for a given problem under consideration.
But even if one is not looking for some example which can be applied in some context, this collection
could be of some interest – maybe even fun – for some readers. It is classical Calculus and Mathematics,

and yet giving quite unexpected results, like e.g. “a continuous curve which passes through every point
of the unit square and which is almost nowhere almost everywhere” (and “almost everywhere almost
nowhere”).

Elementary theory of functions
1.1
Introduction
In this chapter we give some examples which only involve “simple functions”. Some of them are
extremely elementary and they only show that one shall always be very meticulous when checking the
assumptions.
In the ﬁrst example I have deliberately “forgotten” an assumption, which many readers will tacitly
assume to be fulﬁlled. We only use that a function can have relative minima everywhere without
being continuous. In the following example we also lack a crucial assumption.
The next two examples will probably be more surprising for the reader. In the ﬁrst example we con-
struct a function which is discontinuous everywhere in the set of rational numbers Q, and continuous
everywhere in the complementary set R \ Q of irrational numbers.
Then we construct a sequence of functions, which in some sense “converges” towards Dirac’s δ-
function”, and which clearly does not converge pointwise towards Dirac’s δ-function”. This example
gives us a warning that the two natural deﬁnitions of convergence in fact are diﬀerent, and they are
useful in diﬀerent situations which may have nothing to do with each other. This shows that one
should always be very precise when we specify some deﬁnition, e.g. of convergence.
We then construct a continuous function, which is not diﬀerentiable at any point. We shall later in
Chapter 2 meet some other bizarre examples of continuous functions, concerning their diﬀerentiability
properties. However, the present example will for the time being be bad enough.
We continue discussing an hypothesis, which intuitively “must be correct”. Then we demonstrate that
when we try to prove it, we really get into trouble! Therefore we go to plan B, which is to assume
the negation of the original hypothesis . . . and then again end up with another mathematical mess! In
this way we may continue with this mathematical ping-pong without getting any further, unless we
get a quite diﬀerent idea. I shall of course for illustration ﬁnally solve the problem. Although only
Calculus known from high school is applied it is seen that the proof becomes far from obvious.
In the next example we must assume some elementary knowledge of Complex Functions Theory. Notice
that we in one of the constructions implicitly are using Banach’s ﬁx point theorem. We learn from this
example that Taylor series are not always the best tool for approximation, which also follows from
one of the previous examples, where we constructed a continuous function, which is not diﬀerentiable
at any point. In this case it does not make sense to talk about the corresponding Taylor series. It
simply does not exist. Instead we may use the classical and important Weierstraß’s approximation
theorem
Many years ago one of my friends asked me if some functional equation did only have one class of
solutions, depending on a single arbitrary constant. This would indeed be desirable from at statistical
point of view. Unfortunately, this hypothesis was wrong without some additional assumptions, so
the task became to ﬁnd such additional conditions, which assures that the functional equation indeed
had only the desired family of solutions. This has been included here as an illustrative example. The
project was quite a task, though not as bad as an exercise many years ago during my ﬁrst year of
study. My professor asked us to ﬁnd the error in some given hypothesis, then to correct the statement
and ﬁnally prove the right theorem. First year students! One would not challenge students today
with exercises of that sort.

Finally, we include a vicious example of a linear partial diﬀerential equation of polynomial coeﬃcients
and a C∞-function as its inhomogeneous term.
The point is that this equation does not have a
solution, not even in the sense of Schwartz’s distributions (generalized functions). By a small twist
of this example we may even obtain linear partial diﬀerential operators, which are injective, which
should violate one’s intuition.
1.2
A nonconstant real function with relative minima everywhere
The headline looks like a paradox because “if a function has a relative minimum everywhere it cannot
be growing, so it must be a constant”. In order to resolve this enigma we go back to analyzing the
deﬁnition of a relative minimum at a given point x0 ∈R. By deﬁnition, there exists an ε > 0, such
that
f(x) ≥f (x0)
for all x ∈] x0 −ε , x0 + ε [ .
Then note that we in this deﬁnition do not require that the function f is continuous! This gives us the
idea of searching a discontinuous function of this property. One extreme example of a nonconstant
function with a relative minimum at every point x ∈R is then given by
f(x) = n,
for x ∈]n −1, n]
and
n ∈Z.
It can be proved (left to the reader) that if f : R →R has a relative minimum at every real point
x ∈R, then the range
{f(x) | x ∈R}
is at most countable, i.e.
{f(x) | x ∈R} = {yn | n ∈N}
for some sequence (yn) (or ﬁnite set).
1.3
A continuous absolutely integrable real function which does not tend
towards 0 at inﬁnity
For some unknown reason, many students believe that if a function is continuous and absolutely
integrable, then it must converge towards 0 for x →+∞(or x →−∞, the construction of a counter-
example being similar). This is in general not true. One is probably misled by the usual catalogue
of nice functions which are dominant in the elementary Calculus courses. This will “almost always”
tend towards 0 for x →+∞(−∞).
A simple counter-example is given by
f(x) =

It is obvious that f is continuous and nonnegative, and since by taking the restriction of f to N we
get the sequence

we only have to check that

We then add the missing assumption and prove the following theorem
Theorem 1.1 Every uniformly continuous and absolutely integrable function f : R →R tends to-
wards 0 for x →+∞.
Proof. Assume that f is uniformly continuous and that f(x) does not tend towards 0 for x →+∞.
We shall prove that f is not absolutely integrable, because then the claim follows by contraposition.
By assumption f(x) does not tend towards 0 for x →+∞. This means that we can ﬁnd an ε > 0,
such that for all N > 0 there is an xN ≥N, such that
(1.1)
|f (xN)| ≥ε.

Also, by assumption, f is uniformly continuous. Then, corresponding to the chosen ε > 0 above there
is a δ > 0, such that for x, y ∈R,
(1.2)
if |x −y| ≤δ, then |f(x) −f(y)| ≤ε

Choose any x1 ∈R+ satisfying (1.1), i.e. |f (x1)| ≥ε. Then by (1.2),

so

Then construct by induction an increasing sequence (xn), such that

integrable, then either f is not uniformly continuous, or f(x) →0 for x →+∞, and the theorem is
proved. □

A real function, which is discontinuous at every rational number, and
continuous at every irrational number
It is well-known – or easy to prove – that the function
χQ(x) =



1
for x ∈Q,
0
for x ∈R \ Q,
is discontinuous at every point in R.
We modify the construction above by deﬁning

q ,
for x = p
q , p ∈Z \ {0}, q ∈N, q  | p,
0,
for x ∈R \ Q,
where the symbol q  | p means that q is not a divisor in p.
We shall prove that f is discontinuous in Q and continuous in R \ Q.
Assume that x0 ∈Q. Then f (x0) = 1/q > 0 for some q ∈N, and we see that for every 0 < ε < 1/q
and every δ > 0 there is an x ∈R, where |x0 −x| < δ, such that
|f (x0) −f(x)| = 1
q −0 = 1
q > ε.
In fact, just choose x as any irrational number in the interval ]x0 −δ, x0 + δ[. This proves that f is
discontinuous at every rational number x0 ∈Q.
Then assume that x0 ∈R \ Q. For every given ε > 0 we can ﬁnd q0 ∈N, such that
0 < 1
q < ε
for all q > q0.
We deﬁne for every ﬁxed j ∈N,
δj := min
x0 −m
j

 m ∈Z, j  | m

.
The points of the set {m/j | m ∈Z} lie for neighbouring points at the mutual distance 1/j in Q. Since
x0 /∈Q, it follows that δj > 0 for all j ∈N. Deﬁne
δ := min {δj | j = 1, . . . , q0} > 0,
(a minimum of a ﬁnite set of positive numbers, hence δ > 0), where q0 was given above. For every
x ∈R, for which |x −x0| < δ, we get
|f(x) −f (x0)| < ε.
In fact, if x is irrational, then the left hand side is 0, and if x is rational, then
|f(x) −f (x0)| = 1
q −0 = 1
q < ε
for all q > q0,

because then 1/q < ε.
Summing up, for every irrational x0 and every chosen ε > 0 there is a δ > 0, such that
|f(x) −f (x0)| < ε,
whenever |x −x0| < δ.
This argument shows that f is continuous a every irrational point.
Remark 1.1 It follows from the theory of the Lebesgue integral that the constructed function f above
is Riemann integrable of integral 0. It is left to the reader to prove this claim by using the deﬁnition
of the Riemann integral over the restriction of f to the unit interval [0, 1]. ♦

Elementary theory of functions
1.5
A sequence of functions (ϕn), which converges towards Dirac’s δ “func-
tion” in the “sense of distributions”, and at the same time pointwisely
towards −∞at x = 0, and towards 0 for x = 0.
At the ﬁrst glance this looks strange, because Dirac’s δ “function” in some sense is nonnegative, and
yet the pointwise limit is −∞at x = 0. This shows that the two concepts of convergency are not at
all equal.
We shall ﬁrst deﬁne what is meant by convergency in the sense of distributions. We say that a sequence
of real function (ϕn) converges towards Dirac’s δ “function” in the sense of distributions, if
(1.5)
lim
n→+∞
 +∞
−∞
f(t)ϕn(t) dt = f(0)
for every continuous function f, which is 0 outside a bounded interval on the real line.
The reason for this deﬁnition is that Dirac’s δ is not a function in the ordinary sense of the word.
The idea is that the functions ϕn represent a “mass” 1, which for n →+∞is concentrated in a very
small interval containing 0. Since f is assumed to be continuous, it is almost constant in this small
interval of the value f(0), so the integral is close to f(0). So instead of this mysterious element δ one
may use any ϕn for suﬃciently large n as an approximation of this ideal element.
One usually uses the following construction of the possible sequences (ϕn). Choose a frequency ϕ of
some probability function, i.e.
ϕ(t) ≥0
for all x ∈R,
and
 +∞
−∞
ϕ(t) dt = 1.
Then deﬁne the sequence by
(1.6)
ϕn(t) := n ϕ(n t)
for all t ∈R and all n ∈R.
Then by a change of variable,
 +∞
−∞
ϕn(t) dt =
 +∞
−∞
n ϕ(n t) dt =
 +∞
−∞
ϕ(t) dt = 1,
where the mass of ϕn is concentrated in a small interval containing 0.
The point in this section is that ϕ in this construction does not have to be a frequency. We shall only
need that ϕ satisﬁes  +∞
−∞ϕ(t) dt = 1. We shall later in Theorem 1.2 below formulate some conditions
on ϕ which assure that the sequence (ϕn) given by (1.6) also satisﬁes (1.5). However, in order to
become familiar with this construction we ﬁrst give some examples.
The simplest construction uses
ϕ(t) = χ[−1

which again is a frequency, and we see that the mass is concentrated in the small interval

.
It is obvious that the pointwise limit is
(1.7)
Φ(t) :=
lim
n→+∞ϕn(t) =



+∞
for t →+∞,
0
otherwise.
This gives us a clue where to search for more strange examples. If we e.g. consider
ϕ(t) = χ[−1,−1
2](t) + χ[ 1
2 ,1](t),
then this ϕ is again a frequency. The usual argument shows that for ﬁxed t = 0 the sequence ϕn(t) →0
for n →+∞, and since ϕn(0) = 0 for all n ∈N, it follows in this case that
Φ(t) :=
lim
n→+∞ϕn(t) = 0
for all t ∈R,
so already here we obtain a “strange” behaviour of the chosen sequence of functions.
If we skip the claim that ϕ should be a frequency, a good candidate would be
˜ϕ(t) = 1
2 χ[−3,−1](t) −1
2 χ[−1,1](t) + 1
2 χ[1,3](t).
In this case
 +∞
−∞
| ˜ϕ(t)| dt = 3,
and
 +∞
−∞
˜ϕ(t) dt = 1,
so ˜ϕ satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 1.2 below.
Since ˜ϕn(t) = 0 for |t| > 3
n, it is obvious that for t = 0 ﬁxed,
lim
n→+∞˜ϕ(t) = 0,
and since ˜ϕ(0) = −n/2, we clearly get
lim
n→+∞˜ϕ(0) = −∞,
and we have constructed our example, provided that Theorem 1.2 holds.
Theorem 1.2 Let ϕ be a (measurable) real function satisfying
 +∞
−∞
|ϕ(t)| dt < +∞
and
 +∞
−∞
ϕ(t) dt = 1.
We deﬁne the sequence of concentrated sequences (ϕn) by
ϕn(t) = n · ϕ(n · t),
for n ∈N.
Then for every ﬁxed continuous real function f, which is zero outside a bounded interval,
lim
n→+∞
 +∞

f(t) ϕn(t) dt = f(0)

Proof. We shall only prove the claim, when ϕ is Riemann integrable.
Assume that f is a continuous function which is 0 outside a bounded set. Then f is also bounded
(one of the main theorems in Mathematics), so |f(t)| ≤M for some M > 0, which is ﬁxed in the

uous at 0. The tedious technical details ar left to the reader. ♦
It is not diﬃcult to obtain the same phenomenon starting with some properly chosen continuous ϕ.
One simple example is given by the graph of Figure 1.2.
One can also construct a real analytic function ϕ, such that the derived sequence (ϕn) has the same
two properties, namely that (ϕn) →δ in the sense of distributions, while ϕn(0) →−∞for n →+∞
and (ϕn(t)) →0 for n →+∞for all ﬁxed x = 0. One such example is given by

It is obvious that we must choose the constant a > π/(π−1) in order to get ϕa
n(0) →−∞for n →+∞.
The graph of ϕ2 is given on Figure 1.3.
Since the proof requires some knowledge of Complex Functions Theory, I shall only sketch the proof

1) It is easy to prove, using a Laurent series expansion for t = 0 and t0 = 0, that ϕa(t) is real analytic
with a removable singularity at t = 0.

because sin2 t/t2 can be considered as a continuous function on the closed and bounded interval

of Dirac’s δ “function”, because it is not a function! Instead one should use either Lighthill’s deﬁnition,
which is preferred by engineers, because you start with ordinary functions, or apply the more abstract
Theory of Distributions, developped by Laurent Schwartz [49], which is preferred by mathematicians.
We have above used Lighthill’s approach, i.e. we have represented Dirac’s δ function by a sequence
(ϕn) of functions, where
lim

f(t)ϕn(t) dt = f(0),
whenever f is absolutely integrable and continuous at t = 0.
Laurent Schwartz is using a more abstract setup, where δ is deﬁned as a functional deﬁned on the
space of all continuous (absolutely integrable) functions f by
δ(f) := f(0).
The diﬀerence between a function ψ and a functional, like δ, is that the function is deﬁned on points
in e.g. R, while a functional is deﬁned on some set of functions, and its values are numbers.

A continuous function which is not diﬀerentiable anywhere
The continuous functions, which we usually consider, are also diﬀerentiable, with only probably the
exception of some points, where the corresponding graphs have bends of cusps. We are guided by
the dominance of the real analytic functions in our daily life, and compositions of such functions, to
intuitively believe that this is correct in general, and Amp`ere [3] tried as early as in 1806 to prove this
statement, however, in vain.
The problem was solved by Karl Weierstraß in 1861. He proved that every function of the form
f(x) =
+∞

n=0

an sin (bn x) ,
for x ∈R,
where the constants a, b satisfy

is continuous and not diﬀerentiable anywhere.
We have in Figure 1.4 shown what MAPLE does to the ﬁnite sum
10

n=0
2−n sin (11nx) ,
where 11 > (1 + 3π/2) · 2. Clearly, something is wrong, though we have not proved by this graph
that the function is not diﬀerentiable. The function pictured in Figure 1.4 is of course of class C∞,
because it is a ﬁnite sum of C∞functions.

It is more diﬃcult to prove that it is nowhere diﬀerentiable. We shall here not go into details, since
we below choose a simpler construction. For some unknown reason Weierstraß’s example was ﬁrst
published by du Bois-Reymond in 1875.
The construction chosen in the following was developed by van der Waerden [52] in 1930. The same
construction can also be found in Riesz, Sz.-Nagy [47].
In order to avoid any confusion we shall here emphasize that we only consider diﬀerentiation in the
classical sense, and not using other concepts of diﬀerentiation like “weak diﬀerentiation” or “diﬀeren-
tiation in the sense of distributions”. We deﬁne
A continuous function f is diﬀerentiable at a point x, where f(x) is deﬁned and ﬁnite, if the
diﬀerence quotient
(1.11)
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
is convergent for h →0, when h = 0 goes through the set, where f(x + h) is deﬁned. In this case
we deﬁne the diﬀerential quotient as
f ′(x) :=
lim
h→0
f(x+h) deﬁned
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
.
When we construct a continuous function f which is not diﬀerentiable anywhere, we shall “only”
check (1.11) for every ﬁxed x.
We ﬁrst deﬁne an auxiliary function ϕ : R →

0, 1
2

by
ϕ(x) = dist(x, Z) := min
y∈Z |x −y|,
x ∈R.
This deﬁnition means that ϕ(x) denotes the distance from x to the set Z.

Then we deﬁne a real function f : R →R by
(1.12)
f(x) :=
+∞

n=0
1
10n ϕ(10nx)
for x ∈R.
Every single term of this series is continuous, and we have the trivial estimate
|f(x)| ≤
+∞

n=0
10−n = 10
9
for all x ∈R.
Hence, (1.12) is uniformly convergent, so f is indeed a continuous function on R.
We shall then prove that the diﬀerence quotient (1.11) does not have a limit for h →0 for any point
x ∈R. Since f is deﬁned for all x ∈R, it suﬃces to prove the claim for just one sequence (hm), where
the deﬁnition of this sequence depends on the point x under consideration.
Clearly, f is periodic of period 1, so it suﬃces to consider x ∈[0, 1[ and afterwards use the periodicity.
When x ∈[0, 1[, we can write x as a uniquely determined decimal fraction
(1.13)
x = 0.a1a2 · · · an · · · ,
where an ∈{0, 1, . . ., 9},
where we shall never allow a representation, where for some e.g. aN = 9, while an = 9 for all
n > N. In fact, such a representation can be replaced by another one, where aN is replaced by
aN + 1 ∈{1, 2, . . ., 9}, and an = 0 for all n > N.
For given n ∈N0 we have two possibilities: Either
a) 0.an+1an+2 · · · ≤1
2,
or
b) 0.an+1an+2 · · · > 1

We get respectively,
a) ϕ (10mx) = 0.an+1an+2 · · ·
and
b) ϕ (10nx) = 1 −0.an+1an+2 · · · .
Fix x ∈[0, 1[ with the uniquely determined decimal fraction (1.13). We choose (hm) in the following
way,
hm =



−10−m,
if am ∈{4, 9},
+10−m,
if am ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
The change of sign of hm, when am ∈{4, 9}, implies that if n < m, then ϕ (10n (x + hm)) and ϕ (10nx)
lie under the same “half roof” of the graph of the function ϕ (10ny). Hence,
(1.14)
ϕ (10n (x + hm)) −ϕ (10nx) = ±10n hm
for n < m,
where the sign depends on x, m and n.
The property (1.14) is apparently not suﬃcient to prove that (1.11) does not converge for the function
f given by (1.12). However, if we consider the diﬀerence quotient (1.11) for f, then it follows that
1

Here, the second equality follows from the fact that ϕ is periodic of period 1, so ϕ (10n (x + hm)) =
ϕ (10nx) for n ≥m. The third equality follows by an insertion of (1.14).
Summing up, we conclude that

an odd number for m odd.
It follows then immediately that the limit does not exist for m →+∞. Since x ∈R was chosen
arbitrarily, we have proved that the function f given by (1.12) is not diﬀerentiable anywhere in the
classical sense.
Remark 1.3 Since f is a continuous and bounded function, it can be proved that the derivation of
f does exist in the sense of distributions, i.e. generalized functions. We shall not go further into this
theory. ♦

Let f : R+ →R be continuous and assume that f (an) →0 for n →+∞
for every equidistant sequence (an) on R+. Is it possible to conclude
that f(x) →0 for x →+∞?
This is an old problem which belongs to the folklore in Mathematics. I have not been able to ﬁnd
the origin of it. In the light of the previously constructed strange functions one would be inclined to
intuitively guess that this is not possible. Wrong again! The claim is actually true. We shall here
follow L. Mejlbro [36].
We shall prove
Theorem 1.3 Assume that f : R+ →R is continuous and that
(1.15)
f(na) →0
for n →+∞,
n ∈N,
for every ﬁxed a > 0. Then
f(x) →0
for x →+∞,
x ∈R+.
Proof. Assume that f : R+ →R is continuous and fulﬁls (1.15). We shall prove that whenever ε > 0
is given, we can ﬁnd an N ∈R+, such that
|f(x)| ≤ε
for all x ≥N.
So given ε > 0, we deﬁne a sequence of sets (An) by
An = {x ∈R+ | |f(m · x)| ≤ε for all m ≥n} =
+∞

m=n
{x ∈R+ | |f(m · x)| ≤ε} .
Since f is continuous, every set An is closed in R+. Furthermore, it is obvious that An+1 ⊇An, so
the sequence (An) is increasing.
Choose any a > 0. Then by assumption, f(m · a) →0 for m →+∞through N, and there exists an
n ∈N, such that
|f(m · a)| ≤ε
for all m ∈N, such that m ≥n.
This implies that a ∈An. Since a ∈R+ was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that
(1.16)
R+ =
+∞

n=1
An

=
lim
n→+∞An

,
so we have written R+ as a countable union of the closed sets An. According to Baire’s theorem, at
least one of them must contain an interior point, i.e. A◦
n = ∅. (The proof continues after the following
remark.)
Remark 1.4 Since it cannot be assumed that all readers know Baire’s theorem, we include a proof
in this remark.
Indirect proof. Assume that none of the sets An in (1.16) contains interior points. The set A1 is
closed, so there are constants a1, b1 ∈R+, a1 < b1, such that
[a1, b1] ∩A1 = ∅.

MY HORROR CHAMBER
26
Elementary theory of functions
By assumption, the next set A2 does not contain any interior point either, so [a1, b1]\A2 = ∅. Since A2
is also closed, we can ﬁnd a closed interval [a2, b2] ⊆[a1, b1], where a2 < b2, such that [a2, b2] ∩A2 = ∅,
hence in particular,
[a2, b2] ∩(A1 ∪A2) = ∅.
In this way we continue the construction of closed intervals [an, bn], where 0 < an < bn, such that
[an, bn] ⊆[an−1, bn−1], and such that
(1.17)
[an, bn] ∩
n
j=1
Aj = ∅.
Clearly,
[a1, b1] ⊇[a2, b2] ⊇· · · ⊇[an, bn] ⊇· · ·
is a decreasing sequence of closed intervals, so their intersection is not the empty set. Choose
(1.18)
x ∈
+∞

n=1
[an, bn] ,
x ∈R+,
where we have proved above that such an x ∈R+ exists. Then by (1.17),
x /∈
+∞

n=1
An = R+,
because we also have that x /∈An for any n ∈N.
Due to (1.18) this is not possible, so we have come to a contradiction. We therefore conclude that at
least one of the sets An must contain interior points, and Baire’s theorem is proved. ♦
We shall return to the main proof.
Let x ∈A◦
n be an interior point.
By deﬁnition we can ﬁnd
0 < a < b, such that [a, b] ⊆A◦
n ⊆An. It then follows from the deﬁnition of An that
(1.19)
|f(m · x)| ≤ε,
for all x ∈[a, b] and all m ≥n,
m ∈N.
Deﬁne
Bn :=
+∞

m=n
[m a, m b].
Then it follows from (1.19) that |f(y)| ≤ε for all y ∈Bn.
Put
P = min

p ∈N
 p ≥n and p ≧
a
b −a

.
It follows from a small calculation that every point y ∈[P · a, +∞[ belongs to at least one interval of
the type [m a, m b], where m ∈N and m ≥n. In other words, [P · a, +∞[ ⊆Bn.

Finally, it follows from the above that to every given ε > 0 we can ﬁnd N = P · a, such that
|f(y)| ≤ε
for all y ≥N,
and we have proved the theorem. 
It is left to the reader to prove the following generalization of Theorem 1.3.
Theorem 1.4 Let (cn) be a strictly increasing sequence on R+, such that
cn →+∞
and
cn+1
cn
→1
for n →+∞.
Assume that the continuous function f : R+ →R for every a > 0 satisﬁes
f (a · cn) →0,
for n →+∞,
n ∈N.
Then f(x) →0 for x →+∞through R+.
Example 1.1 When we choose the sequence cn = np for ﬁxed p > 0, the conditions of Theorem 1.4
are fulﬁlled, so f (a · np) →0 for n →+∞through R+ for all a > 0 implies that also f(x) →0 for
x →+∞through R+. If, however, the strictly increasing sequence (cn) does not satisfy the condition
that cn+1/cn →1 for n →+∞, it is possible to construct a continuous function f, which does not
tend towards 0 for x →+∞, and yet f (a · cn) →0 for n →+∞for every a > 0. ♦

Two examples of functions from C∞(R) which are nowhere real analytic
It is often believed that a C∞function is also analytic and “that a real C∞function in x ∈R is made
analytic by substituting x ∈R by z ∈C.” We shall in this section demonstrate that this intuitive
claim in general is wrong.
A real function f is real analytic at a point x0 ∈R, if its Taylor series expanded from x0 is convergent
in a neighbourhood of x0 with the right sum, namely f(x),
f(x) =
+∞

n=0
1
n! f (n) (x0) · (x −x0)n ,
for |x −x0| < r.
Clearly, every C∞function has a Taylor series. So if the function is not analytic, then either its Taylor
series is divergent for all x = x0, or it is convergent,but it does not converge towards f(x).
We shall in the ﬁrst example follow a standard procedure. The second example, which is due to T.
Bang [6] from 1946 is probably more exciting.
Example 1.2 We shall use Cauchy’s function ϕ, which is deﬁned by
ϕ(x) =







exp

−1
x

,
for x > 0,
0,
for x ≤0.
Figure 1.6: The graph of Cauchy’s function ϕ(x).
This function is obviously of class C∞for x = 0, and for x = 0 we only have to convince ourselves
that ϕ(x) is more “ﬂat” than any monomial xn at x = 0, so it is easy to prove that
ϕ(n)(0) = 0
for all n ∈N0.
The Taylor series of ϕ developed from x0 = 0 is trivially convergent and represents the identical
zero function, while it does not converge towards ϕ(x) for x > 0. In particular, ϕ(x) is not analytic

at x0 = 0. It is, however, analytic at every other point x = 0, because it is composed of analytic
functions.
The idea is to move the point x0 = 0, where ϕ(x) is C∞, but not (real) analytic, through a dense
and countable set in R. Choose e.g. the dense and countable set of rational numbers, Q. Due to the
countability, the set can be written as a sequence, Q = {qn | n ∈N}.
Then deﬁne the function
f(x) :=
+∞

n=1
2−nϕ (x −qn) .
Since ϕ(k)(0) = 0 and limx→+∞ϕ(k)(x) = 0 for every ﬁxed k ∈N, we conclude that
sup
x∈R
ϕ(k)(x)
 = max
x∈R
ϕ(k)(x)
 < +∞,
for every k ∈N0.
Then (it is not hard to prove that) each of the termwisely diﬀerentiated series
+∞

n=1
2−n ϕ(k) (x −qn) ,
k ∈N0,
is uniformly convergent, so its sum must be f (k)(x), which is deﬁning a continuous function. Since
this is true for all k ∈N0, we conclude that f is of class CR.
Then choose any rational number x0 ∈Q, so x0 = qm for some m ∈N, and we have the splitting of
the function
f(x) =

n=m
2−n ϕ (x −qn) + 2−m ϕ (x −qm) .
The sum is analytic at x = qm, while the latter term is not. We therefore conclude that f(x) is not
analytic at x0 = qm. Since x0 is any rational number, we conclude that f(x) is not analytic at any
rational number, though of course of class C∞everywhere.
Finally, choose any x0 ∈R\Q. Then just note that every open interval containing x0 will also contain
a rational number, where f(x) is not analytic. Hence, we cannot ﬁnd any open interval containing
x0, in which f(x) is analytic, so f is not analytic in x0.
Summing up, we conclude that f(x) is of class C∞(R) and not analytic at any point of R. ♦
Example 1.3 Bang [6] (1946). This example uses a totally diﬀerent idea. We consider the nonlinear
diﬀerential equation
(1.20)
df
dx(x) = 2 f(2x),
for x ≥0,
where f(0) = 0. We shall prove that it has a C∞solution, which satisﬁes the following two conditions,
a) In the interval [0, 2] the graph of the solution is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = 1,
f(1 −x) = f(1 + x)
for x ∈[0, 1].

b) The function has the values f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.
When we integrate (1.20) from x0 = 0 we get the equivalent equation

f(x) =

It follows from the estimate above by iteration that

so (fn) is a uniformly convergent Cauchy sequence.
The uniformly convergent Cauchy sequence (fn) of continuous functions has a continuous limit function
f. By taking the limit in (1.25) it follows that the limit function f satisﬁes the integral equation
(1.26)
f(x) =

f(t) dt,
and f satisﬁes of course also the conditions a), b) and c).
Since f is continuous, the right hand side of (1.26) is of class C1, hence f itself is of class C1, which
again implies that the right hand side of (1.26) is of class C2, so f is of class C2. By using this
bootstrap method we conclude that f ∈C∞(R). Furthermore, we get by diﬀerentiating (1.26),
(1.27)

Then we extend (1.27) to hold for all x ≥0. Since f ′(x) is known for x ∈[0, 2], we get f(x) for
x ∈[2, 4] from the equation
f(x) = 1
2 f ′x

for x ∈[2, 4].
Finally, it is seen by another bootstrap method (iteration) that f(x) is uniquely determined for all
x > 0, and that f belongs to the class C∞(R+).
When x = 0, it follows from (1.27) that f ′(0+) = 0, and then by induction, that also f (n)(0+) = 0
for all n ∈N. Hence, 0 is a zero for f of inﬁnite order. This implies that we can extend f to all of R
by the deﬁnition f(−x) = f(x), i.e. f becomes an even function, and we have ﬁnally constructed our
C∞(R) function f.
When we iterate (1.27) it follows that
(1.28)
f (n)(x) = 2
1
2 n(n+1) f(2nx)
for x ≥0 and n ∈N.
Using a) we see that f(2) = f(0) = 0, so x = 2 is also a zero of f. Since the graph of f in [0, 2] is
symmetric with respect to the line x = 1, and since x = 0 is a zero of inﬁnite order, x = 2 must also
be a zero of inﬁnite order.

Then by a diﬀerentiation,
f(2 + x) = −f(2 −x),
for x ∈[0, 2].
In particular, f(4) = f(2 + 2) = −f(2 −2) = f(0) = 0.
Repeating this argument it follows that the graph of f is symmetric in the interval [0.2 · 4n] with
respect to the line x = 4n, n ∈N0, and also symmetric with respect to the point (2 · 4n, 0) in the
interval

0, 4n+1
, n ∈N0.
Since all points {2n | n ∈Z} are zeros of inﬁnite order, we get that also ϕ(x) := |f(x)| is of class
C∞(R), and even periodic of period 2.
Choose some x0 = 2−p h, where h ∈Z and p ∈N0. It follows from (1.28) that
f (n) (x0) = 0
for all n ≥p + 1,
so the Taylor series, expanded from x0, degenerates to a polynomial, which clearly does not agree with
the given function f(x), which is not a polynomial. In other words, the Taylor series does converge,
but not towards f(x).
Then choose x0 = 2−p, h for all h ∈Z and all p ∈N0. Clearly, x0 can uniquely be written in the form
x0 = [x0] +
+∞

n=1
2−n an,
where the integer [x0] ∈Z is the largest one, for which [x0] ≤x0, and where an ∈{0, 1}.
By
assumption, x0 does not have the form 2−p h for some h ∈Z and p ∈N0. Therefore, the sequence
(an) contains inﬁnitely often 0 and 1. Using (1.28) we ﬁnd a constant C > 0 and an inﬁnite index set
I ⊆N, such that
f (n) (x0)

Therefore, the radius of convergence of the Taylor series, expanded from x0, is given by

We conclude that the Taylor series for f(x), expanded from x0 ∈R \ {2−p h | h ∈Z, p ∈N0}, is

a small argument that the same is true for the function ϕ(x) = |f(x)|. ♦

The example above shows that it is possible to construct a function ϕ ∈C∞(R), such that
1) ϕ∞= 1, i.e. ϕ is in particular bounded.
2) ϕ is periodic.
3) The Taylor series from a point x0 ∈R is divergent for almost every x0 ∈R. And if the Taylor
series, expanded from some x0 ∈R is convergent, then it does not converge towards ϕ.
Another consequence is that a Taylor series expansion of a C∞function does not always give us a
good approximation of the function under consideration. Fortunately, the Weierstraß’s approximation
theorem states that every continuous function (so we do not require that ϕ ∈C∞) in a closed and
bounded (i.e. compact) interval can be even uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials. If
we therefore in our calculations allow a uniform error < ε in a closed and bounded interval I, then
we can replace any continuous function in I by some polynomial.

Elementary theory of functions
Recently, in August 2015, onee of my former students, Jeppe Ammitzbøll, sent me a letter in which
he improved the theorem above, so we only get the wanted solutions f(x) = c/x for x ∈R+, where
c ∈R is an arbitrary constant.
Theorem 1.6 (Jeppe Ammitzbøll, 2015; private communication). Let f : R+ →R be a function.
Then the following three conditions taken together,
(1.31)
x f(x) = 1
x f
 1
x

,
for x ∈R+,
(1.32)
f(x)f
 1
x

= f(1)2,
for x ∈R+,
(1.33)
f(x) f(1) ≥0,
for x ∈R+,
are equivalent to
f(x) = f(1)
x ,
for x ∈R+.
Proof. The proof is incredibly simple.
a) If x f(x) = f(1), then it is easy to check the three conditions, (1.31), (1.32) and (1.33).
b) If instead f satisﬁes the three conditions, (1.31), (1.32) and (1.33), then
(x f(x))2
=
x f(x) · 1
x · 1
x f
 1
x

from (1.31)
=
f(1)2
from (1.32).
Since (1.33) only means that f(x) and f(1) have the same sign, and x > 0, we get by taking the
square root
x f(x) = +f(1),
for all x ∈R+,
and the theorem is proved. We note that in this case c = f(1). □
A more abstract approach would be the following. We want that the only solutions are of the form
f(x) = c/x for x ∈R+, where c = 0 is a constant. These desired solutions are all monotonous, so
they have an inverse. If y = f(x) = c/x, then the inverse is of course f −1(y) = x = c/y of the same
structure. It would therefore be natural to add the assumption that the inverse f −1(y) of f(x) exists
on R+. Unfortunately this is not enough. If we choose h(x) = √x in (1.30) of Theorem 1.5, then we
get that
f(x) = 1

h(x) + h

x√x,
which satisﬁes (1.29) without having the right structure. It is easy to see that f(x) is monotonous, so
its inverse exists. Thus, f −1 should fulﬁl something more.
By adding some missing assumptions we arrive at the following theorem

Theorem 1.7 Assume that f is a strictly monotonous C1 function, and that both f and its inverse
f −1 satisfy the functional equation (1.29). Then there is a constant c ∈R, such that
(1.34)
f(x) = c
x
for x ∈R+.
The proof, which is given here for completeness, is rather technical and probably not of interest for
all readers. One may just accept the result of Theorem 1.7.
Proof. It follows from (1.29) that f(x) and f
1
x

must have the same sign, so they are both either
positive, or both negative. The monotony of f then implies that f(1) = 0.
We deﬁne the auxiliary function
g(x) := f(x)
f(1).
Then g also satisﬁes the assumption (1.29). We may therefore in the following assume that f(1) = 1,
and accordingly f −1(1) = 1.
When x > 1, it follows from the functional equation that we have the estimate
f(x) = 1
x2 f
 1
x

< f
1
x

.
Since f is monotonous, we conclude that f is decreasing in R+, i.e. f ′(x) < 0 for all x ∈R+.
When we diﬀerentiate the functional equation (1.29), we get
xf ′(x) + f(x)

Using that f(1) = 1 it follows that f(x) > 0 for all x > 0. Therefore, this inequality can also be

We prove the following lemma of induction
Lemma 1.1 Assume that f and f −1 satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 1.7 and that f(1) = 1. If f,
hence also f −1, satisﬁes (1.38) for some n ≥2, then f and f −1 also satisfy (1.38), when n is replaced
n + 1.
Proof. When x ∈]0, 1], it follows from (1.38) that

which is the ﬁrst inequality of the second line of (1.38), when n is replaced by n + 1.
Similarly,
f −1(y) ≥y−n+1

for y ∈[1, +∞[.
Then put y = f(x) for x ∈]0, 1] (when y ∈[1, +∞[). Then

for x ∈]0, 1],
and therefore
f(x) ≥x−
n

for x ∈]0, 1],
which is the ﬁrst inequality of the ﬁrst line of (1.38), when n is replaced by n + 1.

Similarly,
f −1(y) ≤y−n+1

for y ∈]0, 1].
Put y = f(x). Then x ∈[1, +∞[ for y ∈]0, 1], so
x ≤f(x)−n+1

for x ∈[1, +∞[,
and therefore
f(x) ≤x−
n
n+1 ,
for x ∈[1, +∞[,
which is the second inequality of the second line of (1.38), where n has been replaced by n + 1. The
lemma follows by the symmetry of f and f −1. □
Return to the proof of Theorem 1.7. We know already that (1.38) holds for n = 2. It then
follows from Lemma 1.1 that for every ﬁxed x ∈]0, 1],
1
x =
lim
n→+∞x−n−1
n
≤f(x) ≤

i.e. we must have equality everywhere. We have proved that
f(x) = 1
x,
for x ∈]0, 1].
If instead x ∈[1, +∞[, then
1
x =
lim
n→+∞x−
n
n−1 ≤f(x) ≤

n

x,
and we have equality. Hence also
f(x) = 1
x,
for x ∈[1, +∞[.
We have proved the theorem in the special case, when f(1) = 1 = c. However, due to the introductory
remarks of the proof this is suﬃcient, so the theorem is proved. □

A linear partial diﬀerential equation without solution
Lewy [33] constructed in 1957 an extremely simple inhomogeneous partial diﬀerential equation with
polynomial coeﬃcients and where the right hand side is a C∞function, such that this equation did
not have any solutions, not even in the sense of distributions, i.e. in the sense of generalized functions.
Later on, Lars H¨ormander [27] found some suﬃcient conditions for linear partial diﬀerential operations
being of this strange type.
A simple twist of the present example gives us an injective diﬀerential operator, which is hard to
believe, because one usually loses some information by diﬀerentiation. We shall here in the large
follow Lewy [33].
His idea was to create a linear partial diﬀerential operator, which turns every
function, or distribution, into an analytic function, so the range is a subset of the analytic functions.
If we then choose a C∞function f, which is not analytic anywhere, cf. e.g. Section 1.8, as the right
hand side of the equation, then f does not lie in the range of the linear partial diﬀerential operator,
so the equation does not have a solution.
We consider the space R3 with the coordinates (x, y, s), and let ψ ∈C1(R). ﬁrst prove

Proof. We may assume that Ωis an open ball of radius δ > 0. Let Γ be a circle contained in Ωand
lying in a plane parallel with the XY plane, i.e.
Γ =

(x, y, s) ∈R3 | s = s1 and x2 + y2 = t

,
where s1 and t are chosen constants, which satisfy
|s0 −s1| < δ
and
0 < t < δ2 −(s1 −s0)2 .
Figure 1.9: The circle Γ in the proof of Theorem 1.8.
The radius of Γ is r =

x = eln

t · cos θ =

and
y = eln

so

We then put
V (s, t) = V (z) := U(s, t) −ππ(s),
where z = s + it.
Then V is of class C1, and according to (1.42) this function V satisﬁes the complex Cauchy-Riemann
equation

and we have proved the usual real Cauchy-Riemann equations.
We conclude that V (z) is analytic in a least a domain which contains the set

Figure 1.10: The Schwarz reﬂection.
It follows from U(s, 0) = 0 that V = −πψ for t = 0, where ψ by assumption is real. Then using
the Schwarz reﬂection V can be extended analytically across the line t = 0, so V is analytic in a set,
which at least contains the sets
ω
and
ω = {z ∈C | z ∈ω} ,
and the line segment ] s0 + δ, s0 + δ [ on the s-axis between ω and ω. In particular, V is analytic on
the s-interval ] s0 + δ, s0 + δ [, so we conclude that −V/π is an analytic extension of ψ. Then for every
chosen a1 ∈] s0 + δ, s0 + δ [, the Taylor series of ψ is equal to ψ in a neighbourhood of a1, i.e. ψ is
analytic. The theorem is proved. □
It follows from Theorem 1.8 that if u ∈C1 
R3
and the expression
−∂u
∂x −i ∂u
∂y + 2i(x + iy) ∂u
∂s
can be written as the derivative of a C1 function, ψ′(s), in the single variable s, then ψ(s) – and hence
also π′(s) – is an analytic function.
Corollary 1.1 There exists a function f ∈C∞
R3
, such that the equation
(1.43)
−∂u
∂x −i ∂u
∂y + 2i(x + iy) ∂u
∂s = f,
is never fulﬁlled for any u ∈C1 
R3
, i.e. the set of solutions is the empty set.
Proof. Choose f(x, y, s) = f(s) as a real C∞function, such that f is not analytic anywhere, cf.
Section 1.8. The corollary follows by contraposition of Theorem 1.8. □
Corollary 1.1 still holds if the operation of diﬀerentiation is replaced by the more general diﬀerentiation
in the sense of distributions. The reader may consult e.g. H¨ormander [27] for further details.
It is also possible to prove that (1.43) is the simplest possible example of a linear partial diﬀerential
equation with C∞coeﬃcients and without solutions.

Corollary 1.2 (H¨ormander [27]) Given N ≥3, N ∈N.
There exists an injective linear partial
diﬀerential operator of ﬁrst order with C∞coeﬃcients.
Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that N = 3. Let f be any function, such that
(1.43) does not have a solution. We claim that the only solution of the linear partial diﬀerential
equation
(1.44)
∂u
∂x + i ∂u
∂y −2i(x + iy = ∂u
∂s + f · u = 0,
is the zero solution u = 0.
We shall assume that this is not the case, so we assume that there exists a solution u = 0 of (1.44).
There exists a branch of the complex logarithm and an open set ω, such that v = ln u of class C1(ω).
When we put u = ev into (1.44) and divide the result by ev = 0 in ω, we get (1.43) with u replaced
by v, which contradicts that (1.43) does not have a solution. We conclude that the only solution of
(1.44) is u = 0, and since the operator is linear, it is also injective. □
The nasty consequence of this example is that if we e.g. try so solve the equation
f ′(x) = 2f(2x)
from Section 1.8 on a computer, then the approximation will always be an analytic function, i.e. in the
possible range of the diﬀerential operator. If we therefore try to let the computer solve the problem,
it will most likely ﬁnd a “solution”. So the computer is trying to approximate the empty set! This is
an extreme example showing that one cannot always trust the results obtained on a computer.

Some necessary measure theory
The present chapter is containing examples from Measure Theory, so we shall start with introducing
the most necessary concepts from this theory.
Most of them are intuitively clear, and yet their
consequences may sometimes seem very strange.
Only one example requires more than just the
knowledge of nullsets. The basics given here are also used in the Chapters 3, 6 and 8.
Apart from ﬁnite pointsets the simplest sets in R we can think of are the intervals, of which we have
four types,
[a, b] = {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b}
for −∞< a ≤b < +∞,
(closed interval)
]a, b] = {x ∈R | a < x ≤b},
for −∞≤a < b < +∞,
(halfopen interval)
[a, b[ = {x ∈R | a ≤x < b},
for −∞< a < b ≤+∞,
(halfopen interval)
]a, b[ = {x ∈R | a < x < b},
for −∞≤a < b ≤+∞,
(open interval).
Whenever I is such an interval with ﬁnite a and b, the measure of I is deﬁned as |I| = b −a, i.e. the
measure is the length of the interval, no matter whether the endpoints are included in I or not.
Based on the 1-dimensional intervals above we introduce in the N-dimensional real space RN,
Deﬁnition 2.1 An interval in RN, N ∈N, is a set of the form
I = I1 × · · · × IN,
where each Ij, j = 1, . . . , N, is an interval in R.
If each Ij, j = 1, . . . , N, is bounded with the measure |Ij| < +∞, we say that I = I1 × · · · × IN is a
bounded interval of the measure
|I| = |I1 × · · · × IN| = |I1| · · · |IN| .
Clearly, the bounded intervals in the plane R2 are rectangles, and the bounded intervals of the 3-space
R3 are axiparallel boxes. It follows immediately from Deﬁnition 2.1 that there are four diﬀerent types
of intervals in R2, and in general 2N diﬀerent intervals in RN, N ∈N. Whenever they are bounded,
the 2N diﬀerent intervals based on the same box have all the same measure. Since the emphasis is put
on the measures here, we shall in general not need to distinguish between the formally 2N diﬀerent
interval based on the same box.
Intuitively, if we in some way may give a set A ⊆RN a measure, denoted by |A|, and if (In) is a
sequence of intervals, such that A ⊆
n In (we call the sequence (In) a covering of the set A), then
we get the inequality
|A| ≤

n
|In| .
Note that we do not require that the intervals In are mutually disjoint. We shall be content, if only A
is contained in the union of the In. This relaxation is quite convenient, because it will often be diﬃcult
explicitly to describe a disjoint covering. Furthermore, it opens up for the following apparently simple
and “obvious”, and yet crucial deﬁnition

Deﬁnition 2.2 A set A ⊆RN is called a nullset

in RN
, if to every ε > 0 we can ﬁnd a sequence
of intervals (In) (a covering), such that
A ⊆

n
In
and

n
|In| < ε.
This “innocent” deﬁnition implies latently the diﬀerence between the Riemann integral and the
Lebesgue integral. So this “trivial” deﬁnition turns up to be far from trivial.
We shall ﬁrst prove the following theorem.
Theorem 2.1 Every countable subset of RN is a nullset.
Proof. Since the set A is countable, we can write it as a sequence, A =

x(n) | n ∈N

. When ε > 0
is given, we choose
ε := 1
2
N√
2n−1ε,
for n ∈N.
We write in coordinates in RN,
x(n) =

x(n)
1 , . . . , x(n)
N

,
and deﬁne the intervals In ⊂RN, n ∈N, by
In :=

x(n)

−εn, x(n)
1
+ εn

× · · · ×

x(n)
N −εn, x(n)
N + εn

,
so each In is an N-dimensional cube of centre x(n) and edge length 2εn, i.e. of measure
|In| = (2εn)N = 2−n−1 ε.
Since each point of A =

x(n) | n ∈N

belongs to at least one of the Ij, we clearly have a covering of
A, so
A =

x(n) | n ∈N

⊆
+∞

n=1
In.
Furthermore,
+∞

n=1
|In| =
+∞

n=1
2−n−1 ε = ε
2 < ε,
and it follows that A is a nullset, □
The rational numbers form a countable set Q, so Q is a nullset, i.e. of measure 0. This may seem
strange, because every x ∈R can be approximated by a sequence (qn) of rational numbers qn ∈Q.
We shall later also give examples of nullsets which are not countable, so the family of nullsets in RN
is larger and not equal to the family of countable sets in RN.
We mention that a proper linear subspace of RN, hence of dimension < N, is always a nullset in RN.
In connection with the nullsets it is also natural to introduce nullfunctions.

Deﬁnition 2.3 A function f : R →R ∪[−∞, +∞} is called a nullfunction,, if there exists a nullset
A ⊂R, such that
f(x) = 0,
whenever x /∈A.
If f is a nullfunction, we deﬁne its Lebesgue integral by
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx := 0.
This formulation may again seem quite reasonable, until we consider the standard example of a
function, which is not Riemann integrable, namely
χQ ∩[0,1](x) =



1
for x ∈Q ∩[0, 1],

otherwise.
Since Q ∩[0, 1] is countable, it is a nullset, so χQ ∩[0,1] is a nullfunction, and its Lebesgue integral is

χQ ∩[0,1](x) dx = 0,
while its Riemann integral is not deﬁned.

Deﬁnition 2.4 We say that two functions f and g are equal almost everywhere, and we write
f = g
a.e.,
if the set
A := {x | f(x) = g(x)}
is a nullset.
If f and g are equal almost everywhere, and f is Lebesgue integrable, then so is g, and

f dx =

g dx.
This means that the Lebesgue integral cannot distinguish between function which are equal almost
everywhere. It can be proved that “= a.e.” is an equivalence relation, and if an element of one of
its equivalence classes is Lebesgue integrable, then all functions in this equivalence class are Lebesgue
integrable with the same value of the their Lebesgue integral.
Roughly speaking, one may say that we get the Lebesgue integrable functions by taking all Riemann
integrable functions and add to them all nullfunctions. This statement is not quite correct, “but
almost”. This inaccuracy will, however, not be of any importance in the following, so in order to
just give a hint we mention that the standard example of a Riemann integrable function which by
deﬁnition is not Lebesgue integrable, is the function f(x) = sin(x)/x for x > 0.
For convenience and later use we here also introduce the Lp spaces for p ∈[1, +∞[. This is easiest
in the 1-dimensional case Lp(R), so we shall only give the deﬁnitions in this 1-dimensional case. The
trivial and tedious task of extending the deﬁnitions to Lp 
RN
is left to the reader. Finally we brieﬂy
introduce the spaces Lp(Ω) for subsets of RN.
2.1.1
The space L1(R)
A slightly imprecise deﬁnition, which however is suﬃcient for us, is the following.
Given a function f : R →R, or C. Then f belongs to the space L1(R), if there exists a Riemann
integrable function g : R →R, or C, such that
f = g
a.e.,
and
 +∞
−∞
|g(x)| dx < +∞.
When this is the case, we deﬁne the Lebesgue integral of f by

The elements of L1(R) are more precisely equivalence classes of functions, where two functions belong
to the same class, if their diﬀerence is a nullfunction. For the same reason,  · 1 is strictly speaking
not a norm, but a so-called semi-norm. In practice this will not bother us much, so instead of “an
equivalence class of functions” we just say “a function”, and we call  · 1 a norm in the following.
The elements of L1(R) are as mentioned above equivalence classes of functions with respect to the
equivalence relation “= a.e.”. It is then possible to prove that  · 1 becomes a (semi-)norm on the
space of these functions, and a norm on the space of equivalence classes, and that

L1(R),  · 1

becomes a complete normed vector space. The latter means that every Cauchy sequence of elements
(fn) from L1(R) with respect to this (semi-)norm converges towards some limit function f ∈L1(R).
More precisely, if (fn) ⊂L1(R) satisﬁes the condition that to every ε > 0 there exists an n0 ∈N, such
that
fm −fn1 < ε,
for all m, n ≥n0,
then there is a limit function f ∈L1(R), i.e. for every ε > 0 there exists an n1 ∈N, such that also
f −fn1 < ε,
for all n ≥n1.
A complete normed vector space is called a Banach space, a notation we shall use in the following.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The space Lp(R) for 1 < p < +∞.
We use L1(R) to deﬁne the space Lp(R) for 1 < p < +∞.
A function f belongs to Lp(R), if there exists a locally Riemann integrable function g, i.e. g is Riemann
integrable over every bounded open set, such that
f = g
a.e.,
and
|f|p ∈L1(R).
When f ∈Lp(R), we deﬁne its (semi-)norm – called a norm in the following – by
fp :=
 +∞
−∞
|f(x)|p dx
1/p
.
It should be mentioned as a warning that the condition |f|p ∈L1(R) is not enough. There exist
functions f, such that |f|p ∈L1(R), and such that no locally Riemann integrable function g exists,
such that also f = g a.e.. By deﬁnition, such functions are not elements of Lp(R).
It can be proved that (Lp(R),  · p) is a Banach space.
Two positive numbers, p, q > 1, are called conjugated, if
1
p + 1
q = 1.
We mention without proof the important
H¨older’s inequality. Let p, q > 1 be conjugated numbers. If f ∈Lp(R) and g ∈Lq(R), then the
pointwise product f · g ∈L1(R), and we have the estimate
f · g1 ≤fp · gq.
The case p = q = 2 is of particular interest. In this case H¨older’s inequality is called
Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality. If f, g ∈L2(R), then

 +∞

f(x) · g(x) dx
 ≤f2 · g2.
We have here added a complex conjugation to the second factor in the integrand. The reason is that
then the function ·, · : L2(R) × L2(R) →C, given by
f, g :=
 +∞
−∞
f(x) · g(x) dx,
for f, g ∈L2(R),
has properties, which are similar to the usual inner product in an Euclidean vector space or a ﬁnite
dimensional complex vector space with an inner product. We therefore call the present function ·, ·
(in the space L2(R)) an inner product.

Then Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality is written
|f, g| ≤f2 · g2,
for f, g ∈L2(R),
which has the same structure as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in Euclidean spaces.
We mentioned above that all Lp spaces are complete, i.e. Banach spaces.

{x ∈R | |f(x)| > λ}
is a nullset. When this is the case we deﬁne the (semi-)norm  · ∞by
f∞:= inf{λ > 0 | the set {x ∈R | |f(x)|λ} is a nullset}.
We obtain with respect to the equivalence relation “= a.e.” that (L∞(R),  · ∞) becomes a Banach
space. Furthermore, H¨older’s inequality is in this case written
f · g1 ≤f1 · g∞,

The space Lp(Ω), where Ω⊆RN is measurable.
Let Ω⊆RN be any subset. We deﬁne the indicator function χΩof Ωby
χΩ(x) =

for x ∈Ω,
0
for x /∈Ω.
The set Ωis called a measurable set, if the indicator function for the set Ω∩[−n, n]N is Lebesgue
integrable for every n ∈N. When this is the case, the measure of Ωis deﬁned in the following way
|Ω| :=

RN χΩ∩[−n,n]N(x) dx =

When there is no risk of misunderstanding we just write fp, when we should have written fΩ,p.
If Ωis a measurable set, then Lp(Ω) is a Banach space for all p ∈[1, +∞], and a Hilbert space for
p = 2.
2.2
Short overview of the contents of this chapter.
The ﬁrst three examples require only some knowledge of the Riemann integral. In Section 2.3 we
demonstrate that integration of a continuous function over a bounded, though not closed domain
in the plane may cause some problems. For the chosen function the two possible axiparallel double
integrals both exists, but they are not equal to each other.
We shall not go too deep into the
explanation, because that would involve the Lebesgue integral, and this is not the main subject here.
In Section 2.4 we construct a function, which is diﬀerentiable everywhere in R, but its derivative is
not absolutely integrable over [0, 1]. This gives us the hint that the classical concept of diﬀerentiation
may have some nasty properties, which at best should be avoided. Later on we shall see even worse
examples, both in the present chapter, as well as in Chapter 5.
In Section 2.5 we play a little with integration. We shall not yet apply the Lebesgue integral, although
the example is better explained in Lebesgue theory.
However, the basic calculations are easy to
understand even with only the Riemann integral at hand. The starting point is the following nonsense,
“one half indeﬁnite integration from 0”. Once the meaning of this phrase has been understood (it
is called fractional integration), it is easy also to introduce “indeﬁnite integration α times from 0”,
where α is any real, positive number, like e.g. √π, just to mention one of the more bizarre possible
numbers. We shall not go through all details in the general formula, because this would require some
knowledge of the Γ and the B functions.
In spite of the above, fractional integration is not as exotic as one would think. It actually occurs
quite natural in some practical cases, including situations from the technical sciences. The earliest
implicit application of this theory can even be traced back to Abel [1], [2], in connection with the
problem of the tautochron.
We continue in Section 2.6 and Section 2.7 demonstrating that convergence in Lp is not in harmony
with the usual well-known pointwise convergence. This is a hidden warning! The inexperienced student
would always prefer to apply the pointwise convergence instead of the more useful convergence in Lp.
In practice, when one has made some measurements, the natural concept will mostly be L2, or L1, or
L∞. These are used in the maximum likelihood method and in convergence in energy.
In Sections 2.8 and 2.9 we show that if p = q, then there are Lp functions which do not belong to Lq,
and vice versa.

In Section 2.10 we construct a function f : [0, 1] →R, which is diﬀerentiable everywhere with a
bounded derivative f ′, and yet f ′ is not Riemann integrable.
This can be proved by using the
Riemann theory alone, but in order not to be too elaborated we shall here allow ourselves without
proof to apply a theorem from the Lebesgue theory.
Finally, we construct in Section 3.3 an “universal indeﬁnite integral” (in a sense which shall be
explained later on) of every measurable function.
2.3
A continuous function f on ]0, 1[2, where both iterated integrals exist
without having the same value.
The simplest possible function of this type is left as an exercise to the reader at the end of this
section. However, due to a discontinuity of this example at some points, we shall here show the same
phenomena, where the function under consideration is continuous.
For simplicity we ﬁrst consider the function g : [1, +∞[ × [0, 1[ →R given by
g(x, y) = e−xy −2 e−2xy,
for (x, y) ∈I1 × I2 = [1, +∞[ × [0, 1].
We shall later use a coordinate transformation to construct a function which is continuous and bounded
on a bounded set. Obviously g is continuous and bounded in I1 × I2.

It is of course inconvenient that the two iterated integrals do not agree. We therefore quote the correct
theorem for Lebesgue theory,
Fubini’s theorem Let f = f(x, y) be a Lebesgue integrable function in R2. For almost every ﬁxed
y the function f(x, y) a Lebesgue integrable function of x. Its integral

f(x, y) dx deﬁnes (almost
everywhere) a Lebesgue integrable funktion of y, and we get


dy =
 

where dz denotes the area element of R2.
Alternatively, it can be proved that if f is continuous – or piecewise continuous – on R2, then
(2.1)
 
|f(x, y)| dy

dx < +∞,
implies that f is a Lebesgue integrable fnction, and we can then interchange the order of integration.
In the present case, the function
(2.2)
g(x, y) = e−xy −2e−2xy = e−2xy (exy −2)
is continuous for (x, y) ∈A = [1, +∞[ × [0, 1], so we must show that (2.1) does not hold for g.
It follows from (2.2) that
g(x, y) > 0
for xy > ln 2,
and
g(x, y) < 0
for xy < ln 2.
Hence,

So far we have strictly speaking only considered α in Bα as an index. However, if we also can prove
that in general BαBβ = Bα+β for all α and β > 0, then α may also be considered as an exponent,
and that we can interpret Bα as an “integration α times from 0”, because this is true for α = 1.
So, let us assume that α, β > 0 are given. Then we get by composition of the operators,

After these reminders we construct our sequence of functions in the following way,

The construction goes as follows. In the n-th row we deﬁne n · 2n−1 functions of the type χ]a,b], where
b −a = 22−n, such that every point from the interval ] −n, n] lies in precisely one of these intervals.
Then for every ﬁxed x ∈R, the sequence (fm(x)) takes the values 0 and 1, both taken inﬁnitely often.
In particular it cannot be convergent at any x ∈R, so (fm) is not pointwise convergent anywhere on
the set of real numbers, R.
On the other hand, if m ∈

because then also m →+∞. We therefore conclude that (fn) converges in Lp(R) for every p ∈[1, +∞[
towards the zero function. Notice, however, that (fn) does not converge in L∞(R)! (Why not?)

A function from L1([0, 1]), which does not belong to any Lp([0, 1]) for
p > 1.
It follows from H¨older’s inequality, cf. page 54, that
Lp([0, 1]) ⊆L1([0, 1]),
for all p > 1.
In fact, χ[0,1] ∈Lq([0, 1]) trivially, where (p, q) are conjugate numbers, and thus

Notice also that fp is only discontinuous at the nullset {0}.
The above is the standard example of a function, which lies in L1([0, 1]), but not in Lp([0, 1]) for
p > 1.
Then we use the construction above to deﬁne a function f ∈L1([0, 1]), which does not belong to any
Lp([0, 1]), p > 1. Using a well-known trick we deﬁne

We shall show that f /∈Lp([0, 1]) for all p > 1, and that f ∈L1([0, 1]).
First notice that for every p > 1 there is an n ∈N, such that 1 + 1
n < p. Then because all fp ≥0,
f(x) ≥2−n f1+ 1
n (x) ≥2−n fp(x).
Since fp does not belong to Lp([0, 1]), it follows that also f /∈Lp([0, 1]). This holds for all p > 1, so
we conclude that
f /∈

A function f ∈Lp(R), which does not belong to any Lq(R) for q = p and
p, q ∈[1, +∞].
For p = 1 this was already proved in Section 2.8, because by an obvious embedding we trivially have
L1([0, 1]) ⊂L1(R). The present task is to prove this statement in general.
If p = +∞, then f = χR is bounded, so it belongs to L∞. Since R has inﬁnite measure, it is obvious
that χR /∈Lq(R) for any q ∈[1, +∞[.

Finally, we consider the remaining case, where 1 < p < +∞. We may somehow use the construction
given in Section 2.8, which we shall do here. We shall, however, at the end of this section shall describe
an alternative function.
We deﬁne as in Section 2.8,
gq(x) :=



x−1

for x ∈]0, 1],
for q > p.

for x ∈[1, +∞[,
for q ∈[1, p[.

If q > p, then we can ﬁnd n ∈N, such that p + 1
n < q. Hence,
f(x) ≥2−n gp+ 1
n (x) ≥2−n gq(x).
From gq /∈Lq(R) follows that f /∈Lq(R) for all q > p.

f(x) ≥2−n hp−1
n (x) ≥2−n hq(x).

Summarizing, we have for every p ∈[1, +∞] constructed a function f, such that
f ∈Lp(R) \

2.10
A function f : [0, 1] →R, which everywhere has a bounded derivative
f ′, and yet f ′ is not Riemann integrable.
The following example was constructed by V. Volterra in 1881. Notice that the Lebesgue integral was
ﬁrst introduced by Lebesgue in 1902, from which we conclude that the integral involved must be the
Riemann integral. However, in order to shorten the presentation, we shall (without proof) apply the
following theorem from Lebesque theory.
Theorem 2.2 Let f be a bounded function, deﬁned on a bounded interval [a, b]. Then f is Riemann
integrable, if and only if f is continuous almost everywhere, i.e. the set of discontinuity points for f
is a nullset (of Lebesgue measure 0),
Remark 2.2 Theorem 2.2 explains why the function χQ is not Riemann integrable.
The set of
discontinuity points in every bounded interval of the form [−n, n] is [−n, n] itself, which is not a
nullset. ♦
Let us ﬁrst consider the function
g(x) =



for x ≤0.

We notice that it follows from the discussion of g itself above that for given a, b ∈R, where a < b,
there exists such a k. It is of course obvious that k depends on b −a, but we shall not need to know
this relationship.
The functions ga,b are derived from g, so it follows immediately that ga,b is diﬀerentiable, and that the
derivative g′
a,b is continuous in ]a, b[, so in every neighbourhood of a (or b) we can ﬁnd an x ∈]a, b[,
such that g′
a,b(x) = 1, as well as an x ∈]a, b[, such that g′
a,b(x) = −1. Also,
g′
a,b(x)
 < 3 for all
x ∈]a.b[.
We extend ga,b(x) to all of R by putting ga,b(x) = 0, whenever x /∈]a, b[. This extension, also denoted
by ga,b, is diﬀerentiable in all of R, and g′
a,b is only discontinuous at a and b.
The idea is then to sum a sequence of functions of the type ga,b, such that the set of discontinuity
points of the sumfunction f has a positive measure, because the claim then follows from Theorem 2.2.
We shall do this by using a Cantor-like construction, cf. e.g. Section 3.2.
We choose an interval ]a1, b1[ of length 1
4 and symmetric with respect to the midpoint of the interval
[0, 1].
Clearly, ]a1, b1[ =

, but we have chosen this vague description, because the explicit
description of the following intervals very soon becomes really messy. Therefore, it is better only to
use this loose geometric description.
When we remove ]a1, b1[ from [a0, b0] := [0, 1], we obtain two closed intervals, [a0, a1] and [bq, b0],
each of length 1

symmetric with respect to the midpoint of [b1, b0], cf. Figure 2.7. When we remove these intervals,
the remainder set is the union of four closed intervals of the same length,

b) If x + h /∈A, then there is an n, such that x + h ∈]an, bn[.
Now, x ∈A and h > 0, so
x ≤an ≤a + hzbn, hence
|f(x + h)| = |gan,bn(x + h)| ≤(x + h −an)2 ≤h2,
and the estimate (2.10) follows.
We have proved that f is diﬀerentiable in all of [0, 1]. The intervals ]an, bn[, n ∈N, are mutually
disjoint, so we conclude from the discussion of ga,b that f ′ is bounded, |f ′(x)| < 3 for every x ∈[0, 1].
Let x ∈A, and let δ > 0. We can ﬁnd an endpoint, an or bn, of distance < δ from x. In fact, the
distance from x to the nearest endpoint aj, bj, from level n is smaller than 2−n. Hence, choose n ∈N,
such that 2−n < δ
2, and let c denote the closest of the points aj, bj from level n. The properties
of ga,b imply that we can always in a distance < δ
2 from c ﬁnd points t , such that f ′(1) = −1 and
f ′(t) = +1. This shows that f ′ is discontinuous at every point of A, because f ′(x) = 0, and x was a
point from A. We have proved that A is the set of discontinuity points of the derivative f ′.
The measure of A is |A| = 1
2 > 0. It follows from Theorem 2.2 (which Volterra did not know, because
it was ﬁrst proved after his result) that f ′ is not Riemann integrable.
It is possible to show that the constructed function f above is indeed Lebesgue integrable with the
expected value,

Marcinkiewicz’s function
The following strange example concerning the so-called universal primitives was given by Marcinkie-
wicz [34] in 1935. The core is the following: To a given sequence (hn) of real numbers hn = 0, where
hn →0 for n →+∞, there exists a continuous function Φ on [0, 1], such that to every measurable
function ϕ, deﬁned on [0, 1] we can construct an inﬁnite suhsequence (hnk) ⊆(hn), such that ϕ can
be found as the limit of the diﬀerence quotients
lim
k→+∞
1
hnk
{Φ (x + hnk) −Φ(x)} = ϕ(x)
for almost every x ∈[0, 1].
In other words, there exist some continuous functions Φ which really have a weird behaviour, and
which is not easy to comprehend.
Since

1
hnk,ϕ
{Φ(x + hnk,ϕ) −Φ(x)}k∈N

is a sequence of diﬀerence quotients, which converges towards the chosen function ϕ(x) almost ev-
erywhere, and since ϕ could be any measurable function, Marcinkiewicz called such a Φ a universal
primitive.
Remark 2.3 Marcinkiewicz furthermore proved that the set of all universal primitives Φ with respect
to a given sequence (hn), hn = 0, and hn →0 for n →+∞, is of second category. I have chosen here
not to prove this result. The interested reader is referred to Marcinkiewicz [34]. ♦
The construction of the function Φ relies on the existence of a singular function, i.e. a continuous
bijective and strictly monotonous function
(2.11)
H : [α, β] →[a, b],
such that H′(x) = 0 for almost every x ∈[α, β].
We have already proved the existence of such a singular function in Section 3.3 in the special case,
when [α, β] = [a, b] = [0, 1]. It is a simple exercise using an aﬃne map (left to the reader) to generalize
this construction to (2.11).
We shall use the singular functions in the proof of the following lemma.
Lemma 2.1 Given ε > 0.
Let F1(x) and F2(x) be two continuous functions on [0, 1].
Assume
furthermore that F2(x) is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere in [0, 1].
There exists a continuous function G(x), which is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere in [0, 1], such that
a)
G′(x) = F ′
2(x) for almost every x ∈[0, 1].
b)
|F1(x) −G(x)| < ε for all x ∈[0, 1].
Proof. The diﬀerence F1 −F2 is continuous on the closed and bounded (i.e. compact) interval [0, 1],
hence also uniformly continuous. Thus, to the given ε > 0 above, the interval [0, 1] can be divided
into a ﬁnite number of subintervals
In = [an, an+1] ,
n = 0, 1, . . . , n0 −1,

such that
(2.12)
|{F1(x) −F2(x)} −{F1(y) −F2(y)}| < ε
for all x, y ∈In.
Using the methods of Section 3.3 we construct a continuous function on [0, 1], such that
H′(x) = 0
for almost every x ∈[0, 1],
and such that H in each of the intervals In = [an, an+1] is monotonous of type (2.11), and where
furthermore,
H(an) = F1(an) −F2(an) .
It follows from (2.12) that
|F1(x) −F2(x) −H(x)| < ε
for all x ∈[0, 1],
and we conclude that the function
G(x) := F2(x) + H(x)
for x ∈[0, 1],
fulﬁls the two conditions of the lemma. □
We shall then prove
Theorem 2.3 Marcinkiewicz [34], 1935. Let (hn) be a sequence of real numbers hn = 0, converging
towards 0 for n →+∞. There exists a continuous function Φ, deﬁned on [0, 1], such that
to every measurable function ϕ on [0, 1] there exists an inﬁnite subsequence (hnk,ϕ) of (hn) ,
(2.13)
such that
lim
k→+∞
1
hnk,ϕ
{Φ(x + hnk,ϕ) −Φ(x)} = ϕ(x)
for almost every x ∈[0, 1].
Proof.
Without loss of generality we assume that all hn > 0.
Then notice that the set of all
polynomials of ﬁxed degree n ∈N0 and of rational coeﬃcients is countable. A countable union of
countable sets is again countable, from which we conclude that the set of all polynomials of rational
coeﬃcients is countable.
We can therefore structure the set of all such rational polynomials in a
sequence {Pn(x) | n ∈N}.
We deﬁne by induction a sequence {Φk(x)} of continuous functions, which are diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere, as well as a subsequence (tk) of the given sequence (hn), and a sequence of sets (Ek) of
measure |Ek| ≤2−k, such that

Let Φ1(x) be any primitive of the ﬁrst polynomial P1(x) from the sequence, and choose t1, such that
(2.15) holds. The other two conditions, (2.14) and (2.16), are satisﬁed of formal reasons, because
k = 1 /∈N \ {1}.
Assume that we have found the ﬁrst k −1 terms, k ∈N \ {1}, of {Φj(x)}, {Ej} and {tj}. Choose

because we can always remove a set Ek of measure ≤2−k, such that (2.15) is fulﬁlled for some tk > 0.
It follows from (2.14) and (2.16) that {Φk} is a uniform Cauchy sequence, thus it is convergent with

Introduction
In Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 we show some classical examples, which should be included in every
collection of “strange” examples.
Cf. also Gelbaum and Olmsted [22] and Mejlbo [35] (not to be
confused with the present author). These examples are also connected with the theory of fractals,
though they are much older.
The example of Section 3.4 was the ﬁrst one which many years ago aroused my attention to these
examples. I have not been able to ﬁnd the right reference, but it may probably be found in Riesz-Sz.
Nagy [47]. We construct a continuous and strictly increasing function, which is diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere, and its derivative is 0, when it exists,
The Kakeya problem is the subject of Section 3.5. The task is to ﬁnd the Lebesgue measure of the
smallest subset Ωof R2, such that an inﬁnitely thin needle of length 1 can be moved inside Ωand
eventually come back to its original position, only with the needle pointing in the opposite direction.
The Nikodym set of Section 3.6 is closely connected with the Kakeya problem.
We show in Section 3.7 a counterexample from Complex Functions Theory. The example is put here,
because the methods used are more in line with the already mentioned examples than with analytic
functions.
Finally, we construct in Section 3.8 a metric space and two diﬀerent probability measures, which
nevertheless are identical on every ball in this metric space.
3.2
The Cantor set C.
(G. Cantor, 1845–1918). This classical set, which should be known by all mathematicians, is an
example of a perfect nowhere dense set. It is also an example of a non-countable nullset in R.
We ﬁrst introduce
Deﬁnition 3.1 A closed set A is perfect, if every point x ∈A is an accumulation point of A, i.e. for
every neighbourhood U,
A ∩(U \ {x}) = ∅.
Remark 3.1 It can be proved that if A is a perfect set in a complete separable metric space, then A
is not countable. For completeness we shall nevertheless give a proof for that the Cantor set C is not
countable. ♦
Deﬁnition 3.2 A set A in a topological space is called nowhere dense, if its closure A has empty
interior, (A)◦= ∅.

Construction of the Cantor set.
Let C0 = I = [0, 1] be the unit interval. We divide it into three subintervals of equal length and
remove the middle open interval. We get a smaller subset
C1 = I0 ∪I2 =

consisting of two closed intervals of equal length 1

Then iterate this process by removing the open middle interval in the next trisection of each interval,

where the trisections with an obvious notation are
I0 = I00 ∪I01 ∪I0,2
and
I2 = I20 ∪I21 ∪I22.
Proceed in this way. Cf. Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1: The Cantor-like construction of Section 2.10.
Then notice that if x ∈Ia1a2···an, where all aj ∈{0, 1, 2}, then x has the following triadic description
x =

k=1
xk · 3−k = 03x1x2x3 · · · ,
where xk ∈{0, 1, 2},
and where also xj = aj for j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

If in particular aj ∈{0, 2}, then the endpoints of the subinterval Ia1a2···an will always belong to C.
We shall prove that C is a perfect set. Given x ∈C and ε > 0. Choose n ∈N, such that 3−n < ε.
Then choose the subinterval I of Cn, which contains x. Since I has two endpoints, at least one of
them, y, is = x. So y ∈C, and since |x −y| ≤3−n < ε, it follows that C is perfect, cf. Deﬁnition 3.1.
Then we prove that C is nowhere dense. We shall prove that the closed set C = +∞
n=1 Cn does not
contain interior points. Let ]a, b[ be any open interval, and choose n ∈N, such that 3−n < b−a. Then
]a, b[ cannot be a subset of Cn, because the lengths of the subintervals of Cn is 2−n. Hence ]a, b[ is
not a subset of C. This holds for every open interval ]a, b[, so we conclude that C does not contain
any open interval, and C is nowhere dense.
We then prove that C is not countable. This is done by a nice direct proof instead of relying on the
unproved claim that every perfect set is not countable. This proof will contain some elements, which
previously were often used in proofs of this type.
It follows from Figure 3.1 that every element of C has a uniquely determined triadic representation
x = 03x1x2x3 · · · ,
where xn ∈{0, 2},
i.e. without the number 1. Notice that e.g. 1 = 03222 · · ·, and similarly for every other right endpoint.

Therefore, we have a unique correspondence between the Cantor set C and the interval [0, 1], given
by the map
x =

because 1
2 xn ∈{0, 1}, when xn ∈{0, 2}. Notice that every y ∈[0, 1] similarly is expressed as a dyadic
fraction,
y = 02y1y2y3 · · ·
or
y =
+∞

j=1
yj · 2−j,
where yj ∈{0, 1}.
This correspondence x ↔y is clearly bijective, hence, the two sets C and [0, 1] must contain “equally
many” elements.
It is well-known that [0, 1] has a non-countable number of elements which is e.g. proved by Cantor’s
diagonalization. An alternative simple proof is the following. We have already seen that every count-
able subset of R is a Lebesgue nullset. Since [0, 1] is not a nullset, (its measure is 1), it follows that
[0, 1] is not countable.
Finally, it follows from the iterative construction of C that
|Cn+1| =

|Cn| = 2

where |Cn| denotes the measure of Cn. Hence, by recursion

and we have proved that C is a nullset, and all the claims have been proved.
Remark 3.2 We may slightly alter the construction above in the following way. In the n-th step we
let the middle interval An which should be removed from the subinterval In, before we proceed to
step n + 1, have the measure
|An| = εn |In| ,
where the fraction εn ∈]0, 1[. Repeating the proof above with obvious modiﬁcations we again obtain
that the limit set C becomes a nowhere dense and perfect set. All such sets C are called Cantor sets.
The measure is then
|C| =

(1 −εn) .

It is therefore possible to choose the sequence (εn), where 0 < εn < 1 for all n ∈N, such that the
corresponding Cantor set C becomes a perfect and nowhere dense set of positive measure. It is left
to the reader to prove that given any δ ∈]0, 1[ it is possible to construct C, such that |C| = 1 −δ. ♦
3.3
The Cantor function
Using the Cantor set of Section 3.2 as a step stone we shall here construct the Cantor function f. This
function is a continuous and (weakly) monotonous function which is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere
with the derivative 0, and yet f(0) < f(1).
We shall later in Section 3.4 construct a Cantor function, which is even strictly monotonous. We shall,
however, as a start in this section prove the weaker claim, which is easier to construct.
In the ﬁrst step we put
f(0) = 0
and
f(1) = 1.
Let I1 denote the middle open subinterval by the trisection, i.2. I1 =
 1
3, 2
3

. We deﬁne
f(x) := 1
2 = 1
2{f(0) + f(1)}
for all x ∈I1.
Then repeat this construction.
If I01 is the middle open subinterval of the interval I0 from C1, and I21 is the middle open interval of
I2, cf. Section 3.2, then we put
f(x) =







1
4 = 1
2 {f(0) + f (I1)} ,
for x ∈I01,
1
2 + 1
4 = 1
2 {f (I1) + f(1)} ,
for x ∈I21.
All middle subintervals must be of the form Ix1···xn1, where x1, . . . , xn ∈{0, 2}. If x ∈Ix1···xn1, then
we deﬁne
f(x) =
1
2 x1

· 2−1 + · · · +
1
2 xn

· 2−n + 2−n−1,
and it is easy to prove that f(x) is the mean between the values on the two closest intervals from
an earlier step, where f already has been deﬁned. We consider here for convenience {0} and {1} as
degenerated intervals of values f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1, respectively.
In this way we deﬁne f in the set ([0, 1] \ C) ∪{0, 1}. Obviously, f is (weakly) increasing, and the
range of f is dense in the interval [0, 1].
If x ∈C \ {0, 1}, then we deﬁne
f(x) = sup{f(y) | y /∈C, y < x} = inf{f(y) | y /∈C, y > x},

Figure 3.2: The ﬁrst steps of the construction of the Cantor function.
where the latter inequality follows, because the range is dense in [0, 1], and because f is increasing.
In particular, f must be continuous everywhere in [0, 1].
When x ∈[0, 1] \ C, then f ′(x) = 0, because x belongs to some open interval, where f is constant.
It is left to the reader to prove that if x ∈C, then the corresponding diﬀerence quotients tend towards
+∞for the increment tending towards 0+.
3.4
A strictly increasing function f, where f ′(0) = 0 almost everywhere.
We shall in this section follow the construction given by Riesz, Sz.-Nagy [47]. The authors do not
mention who actually created this example.
A vague hint given by Marcinkiewicz is that it was
probably constructed by Lusin.
We shall construct a continuous function f, deﬁned on [0, 1], with the following properties,
a) The function f is strictly increasing in the interval [0, 1].
b) The function f is in the classical sense as a limit of diﬀerence quotients diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere in [0, 1].
c) Whenever f is diﬀerentiable at a point x ∈[0, 1], then f ′(x) = 0.
A continuous function f, which satisﬁes the three conditions above, is called a singular function. We
notice that for all x1, x2 ∈[0, 1], for which x1 < x2,
f (x2) −f (x1) =
 x2
x1
f ′(x) dx.
The conditions above are intuitively contradicting each others, and since we have claimed that it
nevertheless is possible to construct such a function, we may expect a fairly long theoretical detour.
We shall start with the following technical lemma.

Lemma 3.1 (F. Riesz, 1932). Given a real continuous function g ∈C0([a, b]) on the closed interval
[a, b]. Deﬁne an open set E = Eg by
E = {x ∈]a, b[ | g(ξ) > g(x) for some ξ ∈]x, b[}.
If E = ∅, then we can write E as a disjoint union

where g (ak) ≤g (bk) .
Proof. We assume that E = ∅, because otherwise there is nothing to prove. Let x0 ∈E. Then we
can ﬁnd ξ ∈] x0, b], such that g(ξ) > g (x0).
We put ε = g(ξ) −g (x0). It follows from the continuity of g that there is a δ > 0, such that
|g(x) −g (x0)| < g(ξ) −g (x0) ,
for all x ∈]a, b[, for which |x −x0| < δ.
Hence, if x ∈]a, b[ satisﬁes the estimate |x −x0| < δ, then
g(x) ≤g (x0) + |g(x) −g (x0)| < g (x0) + g(ξ) −g (x0) = g(ξ),
and we have proved that x ∈E by the deﬁnition of E. We therefore conclude that for every x0 ∈E
there is a δ > 0, such that
]a, b[ ∩]x0 −δ, x0 + δ[ ⊆E,
which proves that E is an open set.

There is only one way, in which we can write
E =

k
]ak, bk[ ,
where k runs through a ﬁnite or inﬁnite index set, and where the intervals ]ak, bk[ are all mutually
disjoint. So if bk = b (i.e. the right endpoint of the interval), then
(3.1)
g(ξ) ≤g (bk)
for all ξ ∈]bk, b] ,
cf. Figure 3.3.
Figure 3.3: Illustration of the set E in Section 3.4.
Assume that x ∈]ak, bk[. We shall prove that g(x) ≤g (bk). We put
x1 := sup
ξ
{ξ ∈]x, bk] | g(ξ) ≥g (xk)} .
Then x1 ∈]x, bk] is the closest point with respect to bk in this interval, for which also g (x1) ≥g (x).
We shall prove that x1 = bk.
We ﬁrst prove that we can ﬁnd ξ ∈]x, bk], such that g(ξ) ≥g(x).
Since x ∈E, there is a ξ ∈]x, b], such that g(ξ) ≥g(x).
If ξ ∈]bk, b], then (3.1) implies that g (bk) ≥g(x), and we can even choose ξ ∈]x, bk]. It follows that
{ξ ∈]x, bk] | g(ξ) ≥g(x)}
is a nonempty set, which is bounded from above, so the supremum x1 exists.
Finally, it follows from the continuity of g that g(x) ≤g (x1).
Then we assume that x1 < bk, and hope for a contradiction, because this will prove the lemma. By
assumption, x1 ∈]ak, bk[ ⊆E, so there exists a ξ ∈]x1, b], such that (cf. the deﬁnition of x1),
g(x) ≤g (x1) ≤g(ξ).

If ξ ∈]x1, bk[, this contradicts the deﬁnition of x1.
If instead ξ ∈]bk, b], then g (bk) ≤g (x1) zg(ξ), which proves that bk ∈E, contradicting the assumption
that bk /∈E.
We conclude that ξ = bk, which implies that g(x) ≤g (bk), hence also x1 = bk, which contradicts the
assumption above that x1 < bk.
Summing up we conclude that x1 = bk, and we have proved that
g(x) ≤g (bk) ,
for all x ∈]ak, bk[ .
Finally, it follows from the continuity of g that
(3.2)
g (ak) ≤g (bk) ,
and the lemma is proved. □
Theorem 3.1 (Lebesgue, 1902) Every continuous and monotonous function f is diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere in the classical sense.
Proof. We may without loss of generality assume that f is increasing. Put
λr(x) := lim inf
∆x→0+
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
,
Λr(x) = lim sup
∆x→0+
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
,
(limits from the right), and
λl(x) := lim inf
∆x→0−
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
,
Λl(x) = lim sup
∆x→0−
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
,
(limits from the left). Then for every x ∈]a, b[,
λr(x) ≤Λr(x)
and
λl(x) ≤Λl(x).
If we can prove that
a)
Λr(x) < +∞,
and
b)
Λr(x) ≤λl(x),
for almost every x ∈]a, b[, we get by applying b) on the increasing function g(x) := −f(−x) for
x ∈[−b, −a] that
Λl(x) ≤λr(x)
for almost every x ∈]a, b[,
from which we infer that
Λr(x) ≤λl(x) ≤Λl(x) ≤λr(x) ≤Λr(x),
for almost every x ∈]a, b[.
Therefore, we must have equality almost everywhere, i.e.
lim sup
∆x→0
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
= lim inf
∆x→0
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
= lim
∆x→0
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
= f ′(x).

In other words, the theorem follows, if we can prove the conditions a) and b).
We shall ﬁrst prove that
a)
Λr(x) < +∞
almost everywhere.
For every constant C > 0 deﬁne the set EC by
EC :=

x
 Λr(x) = lim sup
∆x→0+
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x

.
Hence, if x ∈EC, then there is a ξ > x, such that
f(ξ) −f(x)
ξ −x
> C.
Deﬁning g(x) := f(x) −C · x we infer that g(ξ) > g(x) for all x ∈EC, so EC = E is the set
corresponding to the continuous function g deﬁned in Lemma 3.1. Hence,
EC =

k
]ak, bk[ ,
where g (ak) ≤g (bk), thus f (ak) −C · ak ≤f (bk) −C · bk, and then by a rearrangement,
(3.3)
C (bk −ak) ≤f (bk) −f (ak) .
The function f is increasing, hence by summing over k,
C ·

k
(bk −ak) ≤

k
{f (bk) −f (ak)} ≤f(b) −f(a) = constant.
The measure of the set EC is |EC| = 
k (bk −ak). Using (3.3) we get
|EC| ≤1
C · {f(b) −f(a)},
for every C > 0.
Now, for every C > 0,
E∞:=

x
 Λr(x) = lim sup
∆x→0+
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
= +∞

⊆EC.
We therefore conclude that the measure
|E∞| ≤1
C · {f(b) −f(a)},
for every C > 0.
It follows for C →+∞that |E∞| = 0, so E∞is a nullset. We conclude that Λr(x) < +∞almost
everywhere.
Then we prove that
b)
Λr(x) ≤λl(x),
almost everywhere.
Choose any two constants c and C, such that 0 < c < C. Then consider the continuous function
g(x) = f(−x) + c · x,

Consider in each of the intervals

Assume that x satisﬁes the estimates λl(x) < c and Λr(x) > C. Then x ∈E2.
Consider the function

Lemma 3.1 on each of these, we get the system

Let x be a point, for which λl(x) < Λr(x). Using that f is increasing we can ﬁnd rational numbers c,
C ∈Q+, such that
λl(x) < c < C < Λl(x),
so x ∈ΩcC, and
{x | λl(x) < Λr(x)} ⊆

c∈Q+

C∈Q+,C>c
ΩcC = Ω.
This shows Ωas a countable union of nullsets, hence, Ωitself is a nullset, and so is the subset
{x | Λl(x) < Λr(x)} ⊆Ω.
This implies that λr(x) ≤λl(x) almost everywhere, and the theorem is proved. □
Theorem 3.2 There exists a continuous function f : [0, 1] →R, which fulﬁls the following properties,
a) The function f is strictly increasing on [0, 1].
b) The function f is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere.
c) Whenever f ′(x) exists, then f ′(x) = 0.
Proof. Fix any α ∈]0, 1[. One could, alternatively, in the following assume that α ∈] −1, 0[ instead,
but it will not provide us with anything new. The choice α ∈]0, 1[ will be suﬃcient for the time being.

Choose f0(x) = x for x ∈[0, 1]. Then deﬁne by induction the continuous functions fn, such that
fn is piecewise linear in each of the intervals [k · 2−n, (k + 1) · 2−n] for k = 0, 1, . . . , 2n −1. At the

for all m ∈N.
This means that (3.6) ﬁxes fn+1 at all points of the form x = k·2−n = (2k)·2−(n+1). If we furthermore
ﬁx all the values
fn+1

(2k + 1) · 2−(n+1)
,
for k = 0, 1, . . . , 2n−1,
then the sequence (fn) is uniquely determined, because it is also required to be piecewise linear.
We use the chosen α ∈]0, 1[ in the beginning of the proof to deﬁne

for k = 0, 1, . . . , 2n −1.
A small calculation, or a consideration of the graph, shows that fn(x) for ﬁxed n ∈N is increasing in
x. Furthermore,
0 ≤fn(x) ≤fn+1(x) ≤1,
for ﬁxed x ∈[0, 1],
so {fn(x)}n∈N is a bounded and increasing sequence of numbers for every x ∈[0, 1]. It is therefore
convergent, and we have proved that (fn) converges pointwise towards a function, which we denote
f(x) :=

n→+∞fn(x).
For every x ∈[0, 1] we choose a sequence of intervals

This series is divergent, because the sequence of its terms, (ln (1 + εkα)) does not tend towards 0 for

The Kakeya problem
The Kakeya problem is also called the needle problem. The problem is to ﬁnd the inﬁmum of the
area |A| of all sets A ⊆R2, which have the following property. An inﬁnitely thin needle of length 1
is moved around inside A in such a way that it can return to its original position, but in its reverse
sense, where its two endpoints are interchanged.
The problem was originally posed by Kakeya [30] in 1917. It was solved by Besicovitch [7] in 1928.
In the same year his construction was improved by Perron [44]. Later improvements were given in
1962 by Rademacher [46] and Schoenberg [48]. The presentation in the following is in broad outline
following Rademacher [46].
Theorem 3.3 (The Perron tree). Let Ak, k = 1, 2, . . . , 2n, denote the triangle of the corners
((k −1)ℓ, 0), (kℓ, 0) and (a, b),
where ℓ, h > 0 and a ∈R. Then the union

Proof. Basic construction. We shall ﬁrst consider, what we here call the basic construction. Let T1
and T2 be any two neighbouring triangles with their bases lying on the X axis and of the same height
h and of the same length b of their basis, cf. Figure 3.5.
Figure 3.5: Two neighbouring triangles in the basic construction.
We translate T2 along the X axis to the triangle T ∗
2 , such that the two non-parallel edges of the
triangles intersect each other at the height αh, cf. Figure 3.6.
Figure 3.6: The set T1 ∪T ∗
2 , where T2 has been translated along the X axis to T ∗
2 .
The union T1 ∪T ∗
2 consists of a triangle S and two extra triangles. The triangles S and T1 ∪T2 are
similar, where T1 ∪T2 is of height h, while S is of height αh. We therefore conclude that
|S| = α2 |T1 ∪T2| .

When we divide the two extra triangles along the line af height αh, cf. Figure 3.6, and use that they
are pairwise congruent, and similar to either T1 or T2, we conclude that the two surplus triangles have
the total area
2(1 −α)2 |T1 ∪T2| ,
because the height of each of the four small triangles is (1 −α)h.
Summing up we get

Then return to the 2n subtriangles Ak of the triangle given by its corners (0, 0), (2nℓ, 0) and (a, h).
We organize these subtriangles in 2n−1 pairs, (A1, A2) , (A3, A4) , . . . , (A2n−1, A2n).

In the next step we repeat the process on the triangles S1, S2, . . . , S2n−1. These are paired in the

Proof. A simple geometric analysis, cf. Figure 3.8, shows that the needle can be moved from a line
to a parallel line by adding a set of area 2 · 1 · v = 2v, where v is measured in radians, and a straight
line segment, which is a nullset.
Figure 3.8: Translation of the needle from one straight line to a parallel straight line.
We can of course choose v > 0 as small as needed, so moving the needle from one line to a parallel
one will only require a set of a measure which can be made as small as we want, as long as we only
use a ﬁnite number of movements of the needle from a line segment to a parallel one.
Then notice that it suﬃces to prove that the needle AB can be moved inside a set of area ε
3 to some
straight line segment which forms the angle π
3 with its original position. In fact, if we can do this,
then we just repeat this construction three times followed by a translation from one line segment to
the original one, and the needle AB has been turned around the angle of π, i.e. A and B have been
reversed.
Let A be an equilateral triangle of height > 1 and its base on the X axis. Let the initial position of
the needle be one of the edges not lying on the X axis. We shall move the needle to the other edge
not lying on the X axis.
Choose η > 0, such that
|A|η < ε
6,
i.e.
η <

and then use the construction of the Perron tree with an α ∈

, such that 2(1 −α) < η
2, and
with an n ∈N, such that α2n < η
2.
The height of A is > 1 by assumption, hence the needle can be turned inside each Ak from one of its
longer edges to the other one, if only the needle can enter Ak.
The needle starts at the utmost edge (to the left) in A1, and is then turned inside A1 to the other
edge of A1. This is parallel to one of the edges of A2, and by switching from the ﬁnal edge of A1 to

This operation requires a set of area
2v <

which is possible according to the analysis above. Once the needle lies on the initial edge of A2, which
also is of height > 1, it is easy to move the needle inside A2 to the ﬁnal edge of A2.
Proceed in this way, until the needle has been turned the angle π
3 from is initial position. Notice that
we have only added a set of area
2v · 2n < ε
6.
In this way the needle is turned the angle π
3 within a set of at most the area
|A|η + ε
6 < ε
6 + ε
6 = ε

When we repeat this construction three times, we have turned the needle π radians, i.e. the needle
has been reversed inside a set F of area < 3 · ε
3 = ε. □

The Nikodym set
A Nikodym set is a set N ⊂[0, 1]2 with the following two properties,
1) Its measure is |N| = 1.
2) To every x ∈N we can ﬁnd an inﬁnite straight line ℓ(x), such that N ∩ℓ(x) = {x}.
.
Condition 2) means that every x ∈N can be reached by a full straight line lying in the complementary
set of N, with the exception of the point {x} itself. And yet condition 1) tells us that |N| = 1, so


x∈N
ℓ(x) \ N
 = 0.
The existence of such a set was ﬁrst shown by Nikodym [41] in 1927. His elementary, though extremely
complicated proof was later simpliﬁed by Davies [17] and Cunninngham [15], [16].
The titles of
Cunningham’s two papers show that this problem is closely connected with the Kakeya problem of
Section 3.5.
The construction here is based on the following
Theorem 3.5 There exists a nullset K ⊂R2, such that to every x ∈R2 there exists an inﬁnite
straight line ℓ(x), such that
x ∈ℓ(x)
and
ℓ(x) ⊂K ∪{x}.
So every point x ∈R2 lies on a straight line ℓ(x), which is contained in the union of {x} and the
nullset K.
Once Theorem 3.5 has been proved, and K is a nullset with the properties of Theorem 3.5, we get
a Nikodym set by N = [0, 1]2 \ K. In fact, |N| = 1 is obvious, and if x ∈N, then it follows from
Theorem 3.5 that we can ﬁnd a straight line ℓ(x) in the plane, such that
ℓ(x) ∩B = {x}.
The proof of Theorem 3.5 relies on two lemmata, of which the ﬁrst one below is the hard one. The
proof is a purely classical geometric proof of a type which today is almost forgotten.
Lemma 3.2 Let R1 and R2 be two closed parallelograms in R2, where R1 ⊂R2. Choose any ε > 0,
and denote by ω one of the two closed strips, which is determined by two parallel edges of R1.
There exists a ﬁnite family Ω= {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωk} of closed strips, such that

Figure 3.9: The ﬁrst case of the proof of Lemma 3.2.
Proof. We shall ﬁrst prove the lemma in the special case, where R1 and R2 are axiparallel rectangles
with their base lines lying on the same line.
Let R1 be the rectangle ABCD on Figure 3.9, and let R2 be the larger rectangle EFGH containing
R1, where the line segment AD (the base line of R1) is contained in the base line EH of R2. Let ω
be the closed parallel strip determined by the line segments AB and CD. Finally, choose any ε > 0.
Choose s as the vertical line PW in ω, which is parallel with AB, such that the rectangle determined
by the vertical line segments BI and s, and IP and BC, has area < ε
8. For clarity this has been
exaggerated on Figure 3.9.
Then choose a horizontal line segment t, parallel with BC, such that the subset in ω between t and
the line BC has area < ε
8.
The distance between t and BC is put equal to 2η. Let u be the line segment in ω in parallel with t
and BC and of distance η from both of them,
For a line segment like e.g. AB we denote its length by |AB|.
The intersection point of the two
perpendicular line segments t ans s is denoted by L1, and Q1 denotes the intersection point between
the two perpendicular line segments u and s. We then choose a point U on the line segment IP at
the distance ̺ from P, such that also the straight line through U and L intersects the base line AD
of R1, and such that if Q2 denotes the intersection point of this oblique line and the line u, then
|IU| > |Q1Q2|
and

and such that the intersection point V between the line through UL2 and AD has a distance from A,
which satisﬁes
|AV | < 1
4 AD|.
By choosing η > 0 suﬃciently small it is obvious that U can be chosen, such that the above is fulﬁlled.
In this way we have constructed a triangle △L1Q1Q2.
Let k ∈N denote the smallest natural number, for which
2k |Q1Q2| ≥|WD|.
Let h
2 denote the distance between u and the upper line segment FG. Let A be the triangle of height
h with two of its edges lying on the perpendicular lines s and u, similar to △L1Q1Q2. (This triangle
is for clarity not sketched on Figure 3.9.) Its notation is due to the previous notation of the Perron
tree. There should be from now on only a small danger of confusing it with the point A on the base
line of R1.
It follows from η < h
2 < h, that we can choose n ∈N, such that

Once n has been ﬁxed, ﬁnd α ∈]0, 1[, such that αnh = η.
Then apply the construction of the
Perron tree of Section 3.5 on the triangle A with respect to these parameters. This means that we
split A into 22 triangles A1, A2, . . . , A2n, and then translate them along the line u to thee triangles
A1, A2, . . . , A2n, such that the “trunk” of the Perron tree is precisely the triangle △L1Q1Q2. Here
we use the choice of α, such that αnh = η. Furthermore, the “branches” of the Perron tree has a total
area, which is at most

We consider one of the translated triangles Ai, cf. Figure 3.10, which is a part of Figure 3.9, where
we have removed all irrelevant objects,
Let α and β denote the intersection points o the longer edges of Ai. Let γ and δ be the intersection
points of the line segment AD and the same edges of Ai. Then cover the line segment γδ with a ﬁnite
number of closed line segments, all contained in the line segment γδ, and all of length |αβ|. Finally,
consider all strips, which are obtained by joining α and β by line segments with the endpoints of each
of these minor segments. We have shown two of them on Figure 3.10.
The construction guarantees that these strips cover △Q1WV on the previous Figure 3.9.
It follows from |Q1Q2| < |UI| that the intersection of each of these strips with the rectangle R2 is
contained in the strip ω, deﬁned by R1. In fact, all translated triangles A1, A2, . . . , A2n have their
base line lying within the line segment Q1Q2, and their edges from an angle with the base line which
is at most ∠Q1L1Q2. This implies that the left hand side of each of the strips, which we have deﬁned
above, intersects the line segment FG at a point to the left of U and at a distance from U, which is
smaller that |Q1Q2|.

Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10 show that the part of the union of these strips stemming from A1, and
which also lie between the line t and the line segment FG, is contained in Ai. Hence, the union of
them all for i = 1, , 2, . . . , 2n, lying between these lines, must be contained in the “branches” of the
Perron tree. Using (3.19) we conclude that their total area is < ε/(8k).

We have above described the procedure on the ﬁrst triangle △L1Q1Q2. We then deﬁne k triangles
△LjQjQ −j + 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , k, by simply translating △L1Q1Q2, along the lines t and u, cf.
Figure 3.11.
Figure 3.11: The translated triangles △LjQjQj+1, j = 1, 2, . . . , k in the proof of Lemma 3.2.
We have already chosen the smallest possible k, for which k |Q1Q2| ≥1
2 |WD|. This deﬁnition implies
that Qk+1 lies in the right hand side of the strip ω.
It should be no surprise to the reader that we then apply the same procedure as above on all the
triangles △LjQjQj+1, j = 1, 2, . . ., k. In this way we obtain a ﬁnite number of strips, which together
with the strip deﬁned by the parallel line segments IA and PW cover the left half of the rectangle
R1. Each of these strips have an intersection with R2, which is contained in ω. Finally, the part of
the union of all strips derived from one of the triangles between the lines t and FG has an area, which
according to the construction of the Perron tree is smaller than k · ε
/(8k) = ε/8.
The area of the domain in ω between t and BC is smaller than ε
8. Hence, the union of all these strips
from Ai has an intersection with R2 \ R1 of an area, which is < ε
8 + ε
8 = ε
4. We add the vertical strip
between IA and PW, and the horizontal strip between t and BC, thus covering the left half of the
rectangle R1 with strips, where the union of all these inside R2 \R1 has an area, which is smaller than
ε
4 + ε
8 + ε
8 = ε
2.
Then repeat the same construction on the right half of R1, considering all the mirror images instead.
It follows from 2 · ε
2 = ε that the lemma is proved in this special case.
Then we start on removing all the restrictions given on R1 and R2. The simplest case is when R1 and
R2 are parallelograms lying as shown on Figure 3.12.
Just use that an aﬃne map will transform this situation back to the previous one. It is well-known
that an aﬃne map preserves area, so the case follows.
Assume that R1 and R2 are the parallelograms ABCD and EFGH on Figure 3.13, where R1 and
R2 have their base lines lying on the same line, while the transversal edges of R1 and R2 are not
parallel. We replace R2 with the larger R∗
2, where we add two triangles, such that R1 and R∗
2 have

parallel transversal edges. Then R1 and R∗
2 are lying as in Figure 3.12. Therefore, Lemma 3.2 holds
for the pair (R1, R∗
2), and because R2 ⊂R∗
2, the lemma also holds for the pair (R1, R2) on Figure 3.13,
because R2 is a smaller set than R∗
2.
We assume that R1 and R2 have parallel edges and that R1 lies entirely in the interior of R2, cf.
Figure 3.14. We have already proved the lemma for R∗
1 = MBCN and R2 with ε
2. Each of the strips
ω∗
j ∩R2, j = 1, . . . , k, lies totally inside the parallelogram MPQN. Then apply the lemma on each
of the parallelograms ω∗
j ∩APQD and R2 with the constant
ε
2k. We get for each j = 1, 2, . . ., k the
strips (ωj)i=1,2,...,rj. The family Ωof all such strips ωj satisfy the conditions (3.15), (3.16) and (3.17)
of Lemma 3.2.
Finally, we consider the general situation as in Figure 3.15. Then replace R2 by the larger parallel-
ogram R∗
1 ⊃R2, the edges of which are parallel with the edges of R1. Using the result above, the
lemma holds for R1 and R∗
2, cf. Figure 3.15. The set R2 is contained in R∗
2, so the lemma also holds
for R1 and R2. This proves the lemma in general. □
We immediately conclude from Lemma 3.2

1, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, as shown on Figure 3.16.
Clearly, the edge length of each Qi
1 is 1. For each ﬁxed i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4} we apply Lemma 3.3 on R1 = Qi
1
and R2 = Q(3) with Ω= Ω1 and ε := 4−2 ε2. We get four families Ωi
2, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, of closed strips.
These are all collected in
Ω2 :=

2.
Then divide each Qi
1 into four closed squares of equal size, i.e. of edge length 1
2. We get 42 squares Qi
2,
i = 1, 2, . . ., 42. Fix i and apply Lemma 3.3 on R1 = Qi
2 and R2 = Q(4) with Ω= Ω2 and ε := 4−3ε3.
We obtain 42 families Ωi

and it follows from (6.2) that K∗is a nullset, |K∗| = 0.
In the next step we prove that to every x ∈Q there exists a straight line ℓ(x) through x and contained
in the nullset K∗∪{x}.
Let x ∈Q be given, and let Qj(x,n)

Then choose for n = 2 a strip ω2 ∈Qj(x,2)
2
, such that x ∈ω2, and such that ω2 ∩Q(2) ⊂ω1.
Proceed in this way.
For n = k we can choose a strip ωk ∈Ωk, such that x ∈ωk and such that ωk ∩Q(k) ⊂ωk−1.
Obviously, there also exists a sequence of straight lines {ℓk(x)}, all passing through x, such that
ℓk(x) ⊂ωk. Then it follows from εk →0 for k →+∞that the width of the strips ωk tends towards
0 for k →+∞. We furthermore conclude from ωk ∩Q(k) ⊂ωk−1 that the directions of the lines
{ℓk(x)} converges towards the direction of a well-deﬁned line ℓ(x) through x.
Finally, we shall prove that ℓ(x) ⊆K∗∪{x}. So let y ∈ℓ(x) \ {x}. Then we can ﬁnd N ∈N, such
that for all n ≥N,
y ∈Qj(x,n)
n
and
y ∈{Q(n)}◦,
(the interior of Q(n)).
Choose a sequence of points {yk}, such that yk ∈ℓk(x) and yk →y for k →+∞. Then we can ﬁnd
another (larger) N ∈N, such that for all k ≥N,
yk ∈Q(N) \ Qj(x,N)
N
.
If i > n ≥max{M, N}, then
yi ∈ℓi(x) ∩Q(N) ⊂ωi ∩Q(n) ⊂ωn.
We notice that yi ∈Qj(x,N)
N
implies that also yi ∈Qj(x,n)
n
, hence y ∈ˆω.
Summing up, we have proved that for every n ≥max{M, N} we have yi ∈ˆω for all i ≥n. The set
ˆωn is closed, and yi →y, so we also have y ∈ˆωn, and therefore y ∈K∗. Since y was any point of
ℓ(x) \ {x}, we therefore conclude that ℓ(x) ⊂K∗∪{x}.
Notice ﬁnally that the procedure above can be applied on every square Q. In other words, for every
given x ∈Q there exists a straight line ℓ(x) through x, such that
x ∈ℓ(x) ⊂K∗∪{x}.

3.7
A set which is ﬁlling almost all of R without containing any homoge-
neous subset.
Some problems in Complex Functions Theory require that a given subset of R contains an homogeneous
subset in the sense of Carleson (to be deﬁned below). It was e.g. proved in Kahanp¨a¨a and Mejlbro [29]
the already well-known fact that the Hilbert transform of a function f is totally controlled (in the
Lp norm) over a set A ⊆R, if and only if A is homogeneous. It was in the same paper proved that
to every ε > 0 there exists a closed set A, such that |R \ A| < ε, and such that no subset B ⊆A is
homogeneous. We include here the construction of the set A of these properties, because it may have
interest in itself, once we have deﬁned, what is meant by an homogeneous set.
Let us start with the deﬁnition of Carleson’s homogeneous set.
Deﬁnition 3.3 A nonempty measurable subset A ⊆R is called homogeneous, if there exists a con-
stant c > 0, such that
(3.24)
|A ∩[x −r, x + r]| > 2cr = c|[x −r, x + r]|
for all x ∈A and all r > 0.
In other words, a nonempty measurable set A is homogeneous, if every bounded interval I with its
midpoint lying in A, contains some portion of A, at least the fraction c of the length of the interval I.
For some obscure reason, which is not clearly understood, it is the geometrical assumption that the
midpoint of I should lie in A, which makes this construction of the example below possible.
The deﬁnition means intuitively that no point in A is “sparse” in A. If we let r →0+ in (3.24), then
roughly speaking the homogeneous set A is more or less uniformly distributed.
For convenience later on we get by a negation of Deﬁnition 3.3 that a nonempty subset A of R is not
homogeneous, if for every constant c > 0 we can ﬁnd x ∈A and r > 0, such that
(3.25)
|A ∩[x −r, x + r]| < 2cr.
In order to become familiar with homogeneous sets we include a couple of simpler examples.
Example 3.1 Every halﬂine is homogeneous. It suﬃces to prove this for the halﬂine A = [0, +∞[.
We see that the measure |A ∩[x −r, x + r]| is smallest for x ∈A, if x = 0, in which case
|A ∩[−r, r] = |[0, r]| = r = 1
2 · 2r,
proving that the homogeneity constant is c = 1

Example 3.2 The set
A =
+∞

n=−∞
[2n, 2n + 1]
is homogeneous with the homogeneity constant c = 1
3. The simple proof is left to the reader. ♦
We notice that every homogeneous set must have an inﬁnite measure. In fact, assume that |A| < +∞,
and let x ∈A. Then
|A ∩[x −r, x + r]|
|[x −r, x + r]|
≤|A|
2r →0
for r →+∞,
so (3.25) holds, and A is not homogeneous. In particular, no bounded set is homogeneous! We shall
later use this result.
Obviously, if A contains isolated points, then (3.25) holds at each of these, so A itself is not homoge-
neous. However, if we remove all the isolated points from A, the result A1 intuitively is intrinsically
more packed, so A1 might be homogeneous, while the larger set A is not. One simple example is
A = {−1} ∪[0, +∞[, where A1 = [0, +∞[ according to Example 3.1 is homogeneous. This simple
observation may unfortunately lure the reader to jump to the conclusion that “if |A| = +∞, then A
contains an homogeneous subset”. The tempting idea is that we ﬁrst remove all points x ∈A, for
which (3.25) holds. Call the remainder set A1. It is obvious that if (3.25) is only fulﬁlled in a nullset
of A, then A1 is indeed homogeneous. Unfortunately, (3.25) may be satisﬁed in all points of a subset
of A of positive measure, so by their removal we get |A \ A1| > 0. In that case we must repeat the
procedure above on A1, so we remove all points from A1, in which (3.25) holds (this time with respect
to the smaller set A1), in order to get the subset A2. In this way we may proceed, though it is by
no means obvious that this process will ever stop. We shall prove in the following that even this idea
may seem plausible, it is not always successful. In fact, we shall prove

Theorem 3.6 To every ε > 0 there exists a closed set A ⊂R, such that |R \ A| < ε, and such that
A does not contain any homogeneous subset.
We shall leave to the reader the simple proof that we in the proof may assume that
A =
+∞

n=1
[pn, qn] ,
where pn, qn ∈Q are rational numbers, such that pn < qn, and such that the closed intervals [pn, qn]
are mutually disjoint.
The proof of Theorem 3.6 relies on the following lemma, which proves the existence of sets, which do
not contain “locally” homogeneous subsets, a terminology which will be made precise in the following.
Lemma 3.4 Let the constants µ, c ∈]0, 1[ be given. There exists a closed set A ⊂[0, 1], such that
|A| = µ, and such that for every nonempty and measurable subset E of A there exist a point x ∈E
and an r ∈]0, 1[, for which
(3.26)
[x −r, x + r] ⊆[0, 1]
and
|E ∩[x −r, x + r]| < cr.
Condition (3.26) means that if x ∈E, then the interval I = [x −r, x + r] can be chosen, such that it
is contained in [0, 1]. This is the reason for saying that A is not “locally” homogeneous. Typically, µ
lies very close to 1, and c lies very close to 0.
Proof of Lemma 3.4. It follows from µ < 1 and
4µ (1 + 2−n)
(n + 1)c
→0,
for n →+∞,
that we can choose n ∈N, such that
(3.27)
µ + 4µ (1 + 2−n)
(n + 1)c
< 1.
Once n has been ﬁxed, such that (3.27) is fulﬁlled, we deﬁne a standard length ℓby
ℓ:=
µ
2n(n + 1),
and a gap length r0 by
r0 :=
2µ
2n(n + 1)c.
We construct the set A as the union of 2n+1−1 closed intervals Ij, j = 1, 2, . . . , 2n+1−1. In particular,
A is closed.
We spread these intervals over [0, 1] in their natural order, separated by open gaps of length r0, such
that I1 has its left endpoint lying at the coordinate r0 ∈]0, 1[. We shall only specify the length of
each Ij, j = 1, 2, . . ., 2n+1 −1. For every j there are uniquely determined constants m ∈{0, 1, . . ., n}
and k ∈

0, 1, . . ., 2n+1 −1

, such that j = 2m(2k + 1) We deﬁne Ij as a closed interval of length
|Ij| =
I2m(2k+1)
 = 2mℓ.

In particular, |I2k+1| = ℓ.
The 2m+1 −1 intervals Ij are separated from each other by 2n+1 −2 open intervals, all of length r0.
Furthermore, we have a gap of length r0 from 0 to the ﬁrst interval I1, and another gap from the last
interval to the coordinate 1. We shall in the following show that the length of this gap is ≥r0. When
we also consider these two intervals as gaps, we have in total 2n+1 open gaps.
Finally, we deﬁne
A = A0 :=
2n+1−1

k=1
Ij,
where it will be convenient in the following to use the index 0.
The lemma will be proved, if we can prove
a)
|A| = µ,
b)
A ⊆[r0, 1 −r0] ,
c)
For every nonempty subset E ⊆A we can ﬁnd x ∈E and r > 0, such that
[x −r, x + r] ⊂[0, ]
and
|E ∩[x −r, x + r]| < cr.
The proofs go as follows.
a) By a simple calculation,
|A| =
2n+1−1

k=1
|Ij| =
n

m=0
2n−m−1

k=0
I2m(2k+1)
 =
n

m=0
2n−m2mℓ= (n + 1)2nℓ= µ.
b) Deﬁne B as the union of the set A and all the 2n+1 gaps, all of length r0. Then by (3.27),
|B| = |A| + 2n+1 ·
2µ
2n(n + 1) = µ +
4µ
(n + 1)c < 1,
so we conclude that A ⊆[r0, 1 −r00].
c) Assume that E ⊆A satisﬁes the condition that for every x ∈E and every r > 0, for which
[x −r, x + r] ⊆[0, 1], we have |E ∩[x −r, x + r]| ≥c · r.
We shall prove that this is not possible, so E = ∅. This will prove the lemma.
We ﬁrst prove that
E ∩

k
I2k+1 = ∅.
Let x ∈
k I2k+1, and choose r = r0 = 2ℓ
c . Then by b) the interval [x −r, x + r] is a subset of [0, 1],
hence
|E ∩[x −r, x + r]| ≤|A0 ∩[x −r, x + r]| ≤|I2k+1| = ℓ= c
2 r0 < c r.

It follows from the assumptions on E that x /∈E. We therefore conclude that
E ∩

k
I2k+1 = ∅,
and thus
E ⊆A1 :=

k
I2k.
We remove 
k I2k+1 from A1. Then the gaps of A1 are all of length 2r0 + ℓ> 2r0, including the two
“gaps” at the endpoints.
Let x ∈
k I2(2k+1). We choose r = 2r0, which implies that [x −r, x + r] ⊆[0, 1], and that
|E ∩[x −r, x + r]| ≤|A1 ∩[x −r, x + r]| ≤
I2(2k+1)
 = 2ℓ= c
2 · 2r0 < c · r.
It follows again from the deﬁnition of E that x /∈E. Hence,
E ⊆A2 :=

k
I22(2k+1).
The gaps of A2 are all of length > 22r0, so when we repeat the argument above with r = 22r0 we get
E ⊆A3 :=

k
I23(2k+1),
etc.. Finally, after a ﬁnite number of steps
E ⊆An+1 :=

k
I2n+1(2k+1) = ∅,
and the lemma is proved. □
Proof of Theorem 3.6. For given ε > 0 we deﬁne
εn := 2−n−2ε,
µn := 1 −εn
and
cn := 2−n,
n ∈N0.
Construct An as described in Lemma 3.4 with respect to the constants µn and cn. Deﬁne
A :=

where e.g. n + An := {n + x | x ∈An}, and similarly. Then

2−n−2ε = ε,
and we have proved that |R \ A| = ε.
Assume that E ⊆A satisﬁes (3.24). Using that cn = 2−n →0 for n →+∞, it follows from Lemma 3.4
that whenever 2−N < c for some N ∈N, then x /∈E for every x, for which |x| > N, and we therefore
conclude that E ⊆[−N, N]. We noticed previously that no bounded set is homogeneous, so it follows
that A does not contain any homogeneous subset, and the theorem is proved. □

For comparison we notice the similarity with the Fourier transform
Ff(x) :=

√
2π
 +∞
−∞
e−ixt f(t) dt,
for x ∈R,
which also can be extended to a continuous linear map
F : L2(R) →L2(R),
for which
Ff2 = f2,
i.e.
F = 1,
and
F2f(x) = f(−x),
thus F4 = I.
Both operators on L2(R) satisfy the operator equation T 4 = I. Obviously, F2 = H2.
We ﬁnally deﬁne the Hardy-Littlewood maximum operator M by
Mf(x) := sup
r>0
1
2r
 x+r
x−r
|f(t)| dt,
for every locally integrable function f, deﬁned on R. We see that Mf(x) is the supremum of all
means of |f| over all symmetric intervals with x as its middle point. In some sense, the operator M
“smoothes |f|”, so Mf(x) gets more “nice” properties than the function f(x) itself. In particular, if
f is not identical 0, then Mf(x) ≥0 for all x ∈R.
In spite of the similarities above the Hilbert transform of a function may still have some “wild”
geometric properties. This is one of the reasons why one becomes interested in the homogeneous sets.
We shall shortly explain why.
The main result of Kahanp¨a¨a and Mejlbro [29] is that a set A is homogeneous, if and only if for every
p > 1 there exists a constant Cp > 0, such that for every f ∈Lp(R),

A
|Hf|p dx ≤Cp

A
|Mf|p dx.
This result tells us that we can control the Hilbert transform of a function f ∈Lp(R) by means of
the maximum operator over every homogeneous set. Furthermore, this is not possible for all f, if A
is not homogeneous.
The surprising consequence of Theorem 3.6 is therefore, that for every ε > 0 we may remove a set of
measure ε from R (to get A, so |R \ A| = ε), such that the Hilbert transform cannot be controlled by
the maximum operator over the remainder set A, even if this is “almost all” of R.
Notice the similarity between (3.28), i.e. H2 = −I, and the familiar complex equation i2 = −1. It is,
in fact, possible to consider H as an “imaginary unit” in the vector space of operators generated by I
and H. It is routine to transfer the theorems from Complex Functions Theory to this linear space of
operators, generated by I and H. We shall here not go further into this extension.

A metric space (M, d) and two diﬀerent probability measures µ and ν
on M, which agree on every ball in M
At a conference in 1968 Flemming Topsøe posed the following question:
“Is a measure in a metric space uniquely determined by its values on all balls in the space?”
The surprising negative answer was given three years later by R. O. Davies [18] in 1971. In 1982 R.
O. Davies [19] gave a less complicated proof, which we shall follow here.

It follows from (3.30) and (3.32) that µ0(B) = ν0(B) for every ball of radius < 1. When the radius is
1, then M0 is the only ball, and it follows from (3.29) and (3.31) that
µ0 (M0) = µ(M) + ˆµ( ˆ
M) = 1,
and
ν0 (M0) = ν(M) + ˆν( ˆ
M) = 1,
and we have proved that µ0 and ν0 agree on every ball in M0. Notice that the measures are probability
measures, because they are nonnegative, and each of their total masses is 1.
On the other hand, it follows from (3.29) that
µ0(M) = µ(M) = 2
3
and
ν0(M) = ν(M) = 1
3,
so the two measures µ0 and ν0 are indeed diﬀerent. Notice also that by construction M is not a ball
in M0. □
Proof of Lemma 3.5. We shall construct M as a union of k1 closed “islands”, each of diameter
1/2. For the time being we shall only be interested in the distance between points from two diﬀerent
“islands”.
Let I1 and I2 be two diﬀerent islands. We deﬁne
d(x, y) = d(y, x) := d (I1, I2) ∈

1, 1
2

for all x ∈I1 and all y ∈I2.
In other words, the distance between any two point from diﬀerent islands is put equal to the distance
between the two diﬀerent islands themselves. At this ﬁrst level this distance can only take the values
1/2 or 1. Another interpretation is that each island is represented by a point in a complete graph G1,
in which the valence of each edge indicates the distance between the endpoints of the edge between
them.
Figure 3.17: Example of a complete graph G1 at level 1, where k1 = 4..
We let every island (the points of the graph) in the complete graph consist of k2 smaller closed islands
of diameter 1/4. If I1 and I2 are two diﬀerent islands at this level, we put
d(x, y) := d (I1, I2) ∈
1
2, 1
4

for x ∈I2 and y ∈I2.
The “internal” distances inside each island at level 1 (i.e. a point in the graph G1) is then again
represented by a complete graph, consisting og k2 points, where the valences of each edge can only
take the values 1/2 or 1/4, corresponding to the distance between the islands.

We continue in this way by dissolving the islands at a given level into a union of smaller closed islands,
the “internal” distances of which are represented by a complete graph. Every island from level n −1
consists of kn smaller closed islands from level n, each of diameter 2−n. If I1 and I2 are two diﬀerent
islands from level n, contained in the same island from level n −1, then
d(x, y) = d(y, x) := d (I1, I2) ∈

1
2n−1 , 1
2n

for x ∈I1 and y ∈I2.
We deﬁne in this way in total n
j=1 kj closed islands at level n.
Every decreasing sequence of islands (from diﬀerent levels and contained in each other) is assumed
to have a non-empty intersection, consisting of just one point. This deﬁnition of points implies that
the distance between two points is 0, if and only if the points are identical. The other conditions
of a metric are trivial, so in this way (M, d) become a metric space. For completeness the triangle
inequality follows, when I1 and I2 are two diﬀerent islands from level n contained in the same island
from level n −1, then d (I1, I2) is either 2 · 2−n or 2−n.

The only possible values of the metric are 0 and 2−n for n ∈N0, from which follows in particular that
every ball is both open and closed.
The lemma will be proved, if we can specify the sequence (kn), kn ∈N, and the weight of each island
with respect to µ and ν, such that (3.29) and (3.30) are fulﬁlled.
A ball of radius 1/2 and centre x ∈M is the union of the island I from the ﬁrst level, for which x ∈I,
and all islands, which have the distance 1/2 from I. If we consider the graph G1 from the ﬁrst level,
then the valences are either 1/2 or 1. The ball B[x, 1/2] of centre x ∈I and radius 1/2 is therefore
I united with every island at this level, for which the connecting edge between them has the valence
1/2.
Figure 3.18: The subgraph G1, where we only consider edges connecting I with some other island at
level 1. The ball B(x, 1
2) consists of all points, for which the edge joining it to the island I, have the
valence 1/2. If the valence of the edge is 1, then the point is not contained in B(x, 1
2).
We can reformulate the problem in the following way: We want to set up a ﬁnite graph G1 and two
diﬀerent weights at its points (this will deﬁne the measures µ and ν on all closed balls of radius 1
2),
such that the total weight of G1 with respect to these is 2
3 and the total weight of G1 with respect to
the other one is 1
3, and such that every closed ball of radius 1
2 gets the same weight, no matter which
measure, µ or ν, is chosen.

Choose k1 = 12 and ﬁx a subgraph as shown on Figure 3.19 where we only consider edges of valence
1/2. This means that every other distance is 1.
The triangle of Figure 3.19 is determined by r1 = 3 points, which are called the interior islands. Each
of them is given the weight b1. The remaining r2
1 = 9 points are called exterior islands. Each of them
is given the weight a1. This determines the µ-measure of the interior and exterior islands at level 1.
In parallel we make the similar construction, where the only diﬀerence is that we interchange a1 and
b1, so the weight a1 is attached to each of the interior islands, and the weight b1 is given to each of
the exterior islands. In this way we deﬁne the µ-measure of all interior and exterior islands at level 1.
Notice that every ball of radius 1/2 and centre lying in an exterior island has the weight a1 + b1, no
matter which measure, µ or ν, we consider. If instead the centre lies in an interior island, then we
obtain the weight 3a1 + 3b1 in both measures. thus, µ and ν agree on every closed ball of radius 1/2,
no matter the choice of a1 and b1 > 0. The total masses of M in the two measures are
µ(M) = 2
3 = 9a1 + 3b1,
and
ν(M) = 1
3 = 3a1 + 9b1,
from which follows that we must choose
a1 = 5
72
and
b1 = 1
72.
Every closed ball of radius 1/4 in M is completely contained in one of the islands I from the ﬁrst
level. Here I consists of k2 islands from the second level. The problem of distributing the masses µ(I)
and ν(I) among the k2 islands is completely equivalent to the above with the only modiﬁcation that
the distribution of the mass is now given by either
5
72 :
1
72 or
1
72 :
5
72, instead of previously by either
2
3 : 1
3 or 1
3 : 2
3.
We choose a complete graph consisting of r2 points, i.e. the r2 interior islands. To every interior
island we attach r2 exterior islands. All the valences in the corresponding subgraph of G2 have the
valence 1/4, and the supplementing and remaining edges of G2 have all the valence 1/2. Thus we get
k2 = r2 (r2 + 1) islands from the second level, contained in each island from the ﬁrst level.
Deﬁne the µ-measure of each interior islands as b2, while every exterior island gets the µ-measure a2.
Concerning the measure ν we swap a2 and b2, so the ν-measure of every interior island is a2, while
the ν-measure of every exterior island is b2. Every ball of radius 1/4 gets the same weight in both µ
and ν, no matter the choice of a2, b2 > 0. We shall only ﬁnd the total mass, i.e. we shall ﬁnd r2 ∈N,
such that
(3.33)
r2
2a2 + r2b2 = 5
12
and
r2a2 + r2
2b2 = 1
72
have positive solutions a2 and b2. This is obtained for every r2 ≥6, r2 ∈N.
In general, when α and β are given, and r ∈N \ {1} is a parameter, then the system of equations
(3.34)
r2a + rb = α
and
ra + r2b = β
has the solution
(3.35)
a =

r (r2 −1)

then a, b > 0, in agreement with the requirement r ≥6 in (3.33).
When we continue this process indeﬁnitely, the solution (3.35) of (3.34) guarantees that we can choose
rn and kn = rn (rn + 1), such that the numbers, the positions and the measures of all islands can be
successively determined in the desired way, and Lemma 3.5 follows. □

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Fourier series
4.1
Introduction and basic deﬁnitions
4.1.1
Overview of the contents of the chapter
We shall in this chapter give some classical examples from the Theory of Fourier Series. In the present
section we brieﬂy sketch the most necessary of the theory of Fourier series. In Section 4.2 we discuss
the Gibbs’s phenomenon, which from time to time also occurs in the engineering literature. Then we
discuss in Section 4.3 the sequence of functions
sin nx
πx

n∈N
,
which in some sense to be explicitly explained converges towards Dirac’s delta “function”.
The next three sections are concerned with pointwise convergence of Fourier series. We construct
in Section 4.4 a continuous periodic function, which has a Fourier series which is divergent at some
points. We continue in Section 4.5 with Kolmogorov’s example of a function from L1([0, 2π[), the
Fourier series of which is pointwise divergent almost everywhere. Finally, we ﬁnish the discussion of
convergency in Section 4.6 by presenting Kolmogorov’s example of a function from L1([0, 2π[) which
has a Fourier series diverging pointwise everywhere.
The most successful application of the theory of Fourier series takes place in L2([0, 2π[), which can be
considered as a Hilbert space with a countable orthogonal basis. Also, from a physical point of view,
a function from L2([0, 2π[) represents in some sense an energy, so there is here a strong connection
between Physics and Mathematics.
In Section 4.7 we brieﬂy sketch the Besicovitch space, which is an example of a nonseparable Hilbert
space. Such spaces are usually not included in the elementary courses in Mathematics at the univer-
sities. The problem with them is that they have “too many” (non-countable) mutually orthonormal
unit vectors, However, from a philosophical point of view such spaces might give a far more realistic
model of reality than the ordinary Fourier series.
The theory of Fourier series is closely connected with the Lebesgue integral. It easily follows from
H¨older’s inequality, cf. Section 2.1, that Lp([0, 2π[) is contained in L1([0, 2π[) for every p > 1.
4.1.2

where the condition f ∈L1([0, 2π[) guarantees that the constants an, bn and cn all exist. As an
example of how to prove this we just mention the following estimate

2π

The estimates are similar in the other cases.
The numbers an, bn and cn are called the Fourier coeﬃcients of the function f ∈L1([0, 2π[), from
which they are derived. The series

are called the (real or complex) Fourier series corresponding to the function f. It follows from Euler’s
formulæ that
cn = 1
2 (an −ibn) ,
n ∈N,
c0 = 1
2 a0,
n = 0,
c−n = 1
2 (an + ibn) ,
n ∈N,
so the two Fourier series of (4.2) are equivalent. When everything is real, one usually prefers the ﬁrst
series, while the second representation is preferred, when we work theoretically in the Hilbert space
L2([0, 2π[), because then the set

becomes an orthonormal system with respect to
the complex inner product
f, g :=
 2π
0
f(x) g(x) dx
for f, g ∈L2([0, 2π[).
The classical book of the theory of Fourier series was written by Zygmund [54]. We shall here follow
this book in the introduction of the necessary deﬁnitions, needed in this chapter.
Based on (4.1) we deﬁne
Deﬁnition 4.1 A real trigonometric series is a series of the form
1
2 a0 +
+∞

n=1
{an cos(nx) + bn sin(nx)} ,
where x is a real variable, and where a0, a1, b1, . . . , an, bn, . . . , are real or complex constants.
We mention without proof that there exist convergent trigonometric series, which are not Fourier series
for any f ∈L1([0, 2π[). On the other hand, every Fourier series must by deﬁnition be a trigonometric
series.

We notice that pointwise convergence is not mentioned at all in Deﬁnition 4.1. In fact, pointwise
convergence is far from a natural concept for Fourier series. Unfortunately, the elementary teaching of
Fourier series has often laid misleadingly too much emphasis on the pointwise convergence. Although
one often gets some pointwise results on Fourier series, one should rather think of their convergence
as “convergence in energy” of “in L2”.
Deﬁnition 4.2 A (real) trigonometrical polynomial of order n is a ﬁnite sum of the form
T (x) = 1
2 a0 +
n

k=1
{ak cos(kx) + bk sin(bx)} .
If the coeﬃcients of the highest order terms satisfy (an, bn) = (0, 0), then T (x) is strictly of order n.
In the classical theory of Fourier series we have two important families of trigonometric kernels namely
the Dirichlet kernels, Dn(t), and the Fejer kernels, Kn(t). We shall in particular work with the Fejer
kernel’s, which however, are easily derived from the Dirichlet’s kernels. Therefore, we start with the
deﬁnition of the Dirichlet’s kernels.
Deﬁnition 4.3 The Dirichlet’s kernels, Dn(t), are given by the following trigonometric polynomials
of strict order n ∈N0,
D0(t) := 1

and
Dn(t) := 1

We derive another and more compact formula for the Dirichlet kernel Dn(t). We use the following
familiar antilogarithmic formula
2 sin u · cos v = sin(u + v) −sin(u −v),
and sin t

If we in particular choose f ≡1, then Sn(x; 1) = 1 for all n and x, and it follows from (4.4) that

Dn(x −t) dt ≡1,
for all n ∈N0,
which of course also can be derived directly from Deﬁnition 4.3.
We mention without proof that if f is periodic of period 2π, and f is continuous and piecewise C1 in
R, then we actually have the following pointwise result,
f(x) =
lim
n→+∞Sn(x; f),
We also mention that if instead the periodic function f is only piecewise continuous and piecewise C1,
then
lim
n→+∞Sn(x; f) = f(x+) + f(x−)
2
.
Therefore, for such functions f the sequence of sections {Sn(x; f)} is pointwise convergent everywhere
with almost everywhere f(x) as its limit. This is the reason, why one usually adjusts a function f(x)
at every point of discontinuity by the value 1
2{f(x+) + f(x−)}.

Gibbs’s phenomenon
Gibbs’s phenomenon describes an “overshoot” of the ﬁnite sections of a Fourier series in the neigh-
bourhood of a point of discontinuity of some function. To see what is meant by this, let us compute
the Fourier series of the discontinuous periodic function (period 2π), which is speciﬁed by its deﬁnition
in the half open interval [0, 2π[ by
f(x) :=



π −x
for 0 < x < 2π,
0
for x = 0,
continued by periodicity.

Fourier series
Even though the Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere with the right sum function, we
shall nevertheless take a closer look on how this convergence of (4.10) takes place. Let us consider the
sequence of sections of the Fourier series,
Sn(x) := Sn(x; f) = 2
n

k=1
sin kx
k
,
for n ∈N.
All these sections Sn(x) are continuous, while the sum function f(x) is discontinuous at all points 2pπ,
p ∈Z. We therefore conclude that the sequence of sections, {Sn(x)}n∈N does not converge uniformly
towards f, because this would imply that f was also continuous.
We say that Gibbs’s phenomenon describes how much Sn(x) diﬀers from f(x) in the uniform norm,
 · ∞. We shall ﬁnd the extrema of the diﬀerence function Sn(x) −f(x) in the interval ]0, 2π[. Using

Hence, there is an N ∈N, such that the section Sn(x) for all n ≥N is > π at some points (an
“overshoot”), while obviously sup f(x) = π. This is, what we call Gibbs’s phenomenon.

so for large n the section Sn(x) overshoots the function at some points with approximately 18/2 = 9 %,
because the 18 % describes the relative diﬀerence between the undershoot and the nearby overshoot.
Remark 4.2 According to Wikipedia J. Willard Gibbs [23], [24] only rediscovered this result in 1899,
It was ﬁrst found – and published in 1848 - by Henry Wilbraham [53]. Before it was understood in
Mathematics it did some fuss in Physics. In fact, the phenomenon was also observed by experimental
physicists, like e.g. Albert A. Michelson [40], who believed that it was due to some imperfections in
his measuring apparatuses. Well, it was not! This is again a case where one should not have jumped
to conclusions before the theory was fully understood. ♦

The sequence of functions
sin nx

n∈N
converges towards Dirac’s delta
“function” δ for n →+∞.
The unprecise headline is often met in the literature without any hint of what is meant by it. The type
of convergence is not speciﬁed. In this section we make it precise by proving the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1 We consider functions f ∈L2(R), i.e.
(4.12)
f2

|f(x)|2 dx < +∞,
where we furthermore assume that f is also continuous at 0. Then
(4.13)
lim

f(x) dx = f(0)
[= δ(f)].
Formula (4.13) is one way to express the incorrect way of writing
“
 +∞
−∞
f(x) δ(x) dx = f(0)”,
which is often seen in the literature.
The problem with this notation is that Dirac’s δ(x) is not
a function, and we may easily get into trouble, if we are not very careful. Therefore, (4.13) is a
better alternative, because it does not have the same ﬂaws as the integral with “δ(x)”. There are
other alternatives, based on e.g. sequences of probability functions, the mass of which in the limit are
squeezed into x = 0.

A continuous periodic function, where the corresponding Fourier series
is divergent at some points
The ﬁrst example of such a function was given by du Bois-Reymond in 1876. The example below is
due to Fej´er from 1911.
We proved in Section 4.2 that the function

where the Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere with the sum function g(x).
Let

denote its n-th section. We shall ﬁrst prove that we can ﬁnd a constant C > 0, such that

|Sn(x; g)| ≤C
for all x ∈R and all n ∈N.
This was almost proved in Section 4.2. We shall here give a direct proof. Let Kn denote Fej´er’s

The requirement on the pk can also be written pn > pk−1 + nk−1 + nk, and then it is obvious that
such sequences (nk) and (pk) exist.

and it follows that the series in (4.25) is uniformly convergent. Every trigonometric polynomial fp,n
is continuous, so by the uniform convergence f is also continuous. Every fp,n is periodic of period 2π,
hence f is also periodic of period 2π.

where by (4.25)

This means that if a term of the type am cos mx occurs in (4.26), then it only occurs once, so the
terms do not interfere.
We shall prove that the Fourier series of f exists and that it is obtained by removing the parentheses
in (4.26) followed by an addition of the missing terms as zero terms.
First notice that the series

If some an = 0, then there exists a k ∈N, such that pk −nk ≤n ≤pk + nk and n = pk, in which case
an is equal to the corresponding element of (4.26).
Summing up, we have constructed a continuous and periodic function f with a Fourier series, which
is obtained by removing the parentheses of (4.26). We shall then only show that this Fourier series is
divergent at some points. We shall prove this for x = 0.
We shall show that the sequence of sections {Sn(0)} of the Fourier series is divergent at x = 0. If
n = 2n1+2n2+· · ·+2nk, then (4.26) implies that sn(0) = 0. If instead n = 2n1+2n2+· · ·+2nk−1+nk,
then it follows from (4.23) that

Hence, the sequence {sn(0)} is divergent, i.e. the Fourier series is divergent at x = 0, and the claim is
proved.
Remark 4.3 It was a long time an open question, if it was possible to construct a continuous periodic
function f, where the corresponding Fourier series is divergent everywhere. This conjecture was partly
supported by the example above, and partly by Kolmogorov’s examples, cf. Section 4.5 and Section 4.6.
Kolmogorov’s examples do not solve the problem, because the functions are not continuous. However,
they are absolutely integrable, f ∈L1([0, 2π[), and the condition  2π
0
|f(t)| dt < +∞guarantees that
all Fourier coeﬃcients are well-deﬁned.
The problem above was solved by Carleson [11] in 1966, and his result was extended in 1967 by
Hunt [26]. Summing up, they proved the following theorem
Carleson-Hunt’s theorem.
For every p > 1 and every function f ∈Lp([0, 2π[) there exists a
Lebesgue nullset A ⊂[0, 2π[, such that
lim
n→+∞Sn(x; f) = f(x)
for all x ∈[0, 2π[ \A.
In other words, this theorem assures for p > 1 that every f ∈Lp([0, 2π[) is pointwise convergent
almost everywhere. We notice that the function f given by (4.25) is continuous and periodic, so its
restriction to the interval [0, 2π[ belongs to everyone of the spaces Lp([0, 2π[), p ≥1. Then it follows
from Carleson-Hunt’s theorem that its Fourier series is pointwise convergent almost everywhere. It
was shear luck that the choice x = 0 actually belongs to the exceptional nullset. ♦

We notice that Kolmogorov’s two functions deﬁned in Section 4.5 and Section 4.6 necessarily must
belong to the set
L1([0, 2π[) \

p>1
Lp([0, 2π[).
The interested reader may ﬁnd a proof of Carleson-Hunt’s theorem in Jørsboe & Mejlbro [28]. This is
not an easy proof either (121 pages), and even today I feel that the result in some way is not “natural”.
In all useful applications in the physical or technical sciences the Fourier series are convergent in
L2([0, 2π[), i.e. in limit in mean, l.i.m. or in energy. It is in such a context a very strange request
that it should also be pointwise convergent, and even more strange that this is actually true almost
everywhere in most cases of practical interest.
It should be added that there exist continuous and periodic function, where Carleson-Hunt’s theorem
applies, and where the Fourier series diverges at all points from a non-countable set, which then
necessarily is a nullset. And even more general, to every nullset N ⊂[0, 2π[ we can ﬁnd a continuous
function, such that its Fourier series is divergent at all points x ∈N.

A Fourier series which is divergent almost everywhere
We shall in this section construct a function f ∈L1([0, 2π[), such that its Fourier series
f ∼1
2 a0 +

n=1
{an cos nx + bn sin nx}
is (pointwise) divergent almost everywhere. We ﬁrst notice that it follows from the assumption that
f ∈L1([0, 2π[) and an application of Lebesgue’s majorizing theorem that all the coeﬃcients an and bn
do exist. In fact,

Kolmogorov [31] ﬁrst constructed a function of this type in 1923. Three years later, in 1926, Kol-
mogorov [32] gave the far more diﬃcult construction of a function f ∈L1([0, 2pi[) with a Fourier
series, which is (pointwise) divergent everywhere. When we compare with Carleson-Hunt’s theorem
from Section 4.4, it follows that none of Kolmogorov’s functions can belong to any Lp([0, 2π[) for
p > 1. This observation almost solves the classical problem concerned with pointwise convergence of
Fourier series.
We shall in the present construction of such a weird function more or less follow Zygmund [54]. As
usual, we put all the real diﬃculties into one preliminary lemma.

Lemma 4.1 There exists a sequence of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials fn, all of which have
the constant term 1
2 a0 = 1
2, satisfying the following;
To every m ∈N there exist a constant An > 0 and a measurable subset En ⊂[0, 2π[, such that
1) An →+∞for n →+∞
2) |En| →2π for n →+∞, where | · | denotes the Lebesgue measure of measurable sets.
3) For every ﬁxed n ∈N and every x ∈En there exists a constant m = mx ∈N, such that

Proof. For any given n ∈N we put
cj =

j = 0, 1, . . ., n,
and choose m1, . . . , mn ∈N, such that
(4.27)



m1 ≥n4 and mj+1 > 2mj,
2mj + 1 = (2n + 1)pj for some pj ∈N.
We deﬁne the trigonometric polynomial fn as a mean of some Fej´er kernels, cf. Deﬁnition 4.4,
(4.28)
fn(x) := 1
n {Km1 (x −c1) + Km2 (x −c2) + · · · + Kmn (x −cn)} .
It follows from the general property Kn(t) ≥0 that also fn(x) ≧0. Each of the functions Kmj(x −cj)
contains the constant term 1
2. Consequently, fn(x) has also the constant term 1
2.
Then we prove (1)–(3) of Lemma 4.1. We start by calculating the mj-th section Smj(x; fn) of the
Fourier series of the function fn given by (4.28). The ﬁrst j terms of (4.28) are the same. However,
when i ∈{j + 1, . . . , n} we must delete all terms of order > mj in Kmi(x −ci). Therefore, by the
deﬁnitions of Km and Dk from Section 4.1 and a small count,

is divergent almost everywhere.
Proof. Let (fn) be a sequence of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials, all of constant term 1
2 and
satisfying Lemma 4.1. Assume that the constant m = mx of Lemma 4.1 (3) satisﬁes the estimates
1 ≤m ≤νn, where νn is the order of fn. The sequence (An) of Lemma 4.1 (1) tends towards +∞.
Thus there exists a sequence (nk), where nk ∈N, such that

The adjusted trigonometric polynomial fnk(x) −1
2 has the constant term 0. Therefore, we can choose
another sequence (qk) of numbers qk ∈N, which increases so fast that the order of the trigonometric
polynomial fnk(qkx)−1
2 is smaller than the smallest occurring order of the terms in fnk+1(qk+1x)−1
2.
We may e.g. choose (qk), such that qkνnk < qk+1. In particular, any term of the type a·cosnx+b·sinnx,
where (a, b) = (0, 0), is at most a member of one of the fnk(qkx) −1

It follows from Lemma 4.1 (3) that whenever x ∈Ek, then some partial sum of ϕk(x), i.e. some

which tends towards + ∞for n →+∞.
We therefore conclude that the Fourier series is divergent at every point x, which lies in inﬁnitely
many of the Ek. Since |Ek| →2π for k →+∞, it is not hard to prove that the set Ωof all points,
which at most lie in ﬁnitely many of the Ek is a nullset. In fact, let ε > 0 be any positive constant,
and deﬁne

Then clearly, Ω= +∞

|Ek| →2π for k →+∞implies that we can choose k ≥n + 1, such that
Ek > 2π −2−nε,
i.e.
|Ωn| < ε · 2−n.
We ﬁnally get by a very crude estimate that
|Ω| ≤

|Ωn| < ε

2−n = ε.
This holds for every ε > 0, which is only possible, if Ωis a nullset. We therefore conclude that the
Fourier series of f ∈L1([0, 2π[) is divergent almost everywhere. □

A Fourier series which diverges everywhere
We shall in this section use a modiﬁed version of a proof given by Zygmund [54] of Kolmogorov’s
result, [32], from 1926.
Deﬁne for ﬁxed n ∈N,
xj :=
2πj
2n + 1,
for j = 0, 1, . . . , 2n.
Notice in particular that x2j = cj, where the cj were deﬁned in Section 4.5.
Recall the deﬁnition of Fej´er’s kernel in Deﬁnition 4.4. Then put

where Dp(x) is Dirichlet’s kernel, cf. Deﬁnition 4.3, and where m0 := 2n(2n + 1) is the order of ϕn(x)
of its trigonometric polynomials. In this way we ﬁx such a δ = δn > 0 for every n ∈N.
Deﬁne the intervals
I′
j = [xj −δ, xj + δ]
and
Ij = [xj + δ, xj+1 −δ] .
Then
ϕn(x) ≥n
for x ∈I′
j, where j = 0, 1, . . . , 2n.
As usual we put all the diﬃcult parts of the proof of the result into some preliminary lemmata.
Lemma 4.2 For given n ∈N let δ > 0 and Ij be deﬁned as above, and write for short m0 = 2n(2n+1).
There exists a ﬁnite sequence of strictly increasing natural numbers,
mj ∈N
and
m0 < m1 < m2 < · · · < mn < · · · ,
such that for every x ∈I2j ∪I2kj+1, j = 0, 1, . . ., n −1, there exists an h = hx,j ∈N, satisfying

2) mj ≤k < 1

Proof. By induction. Assume that we already have ﬁxed m0, m1, . . . , mj with the properties de-
scribed in the lemma. We shall ﬁrst prove that there exists an m′
j ∈N, m′
j > mj, such that (1) and
(3) hold for some k = kx ∈N between mj and m′
j. Then later on we shall adjust this choice, such
that (2) also holds.
Fix some j ∈{0, 1, . . ., n −2}. Condition (1) tells us to check the set of numbers
2k + 1 = ̺(2n + 1),
where ̺ is an odd integer.
Using that

If θ is irrational, then {(2k + 1)θ (mod 1)}k∈N0 obviously has inﬁnitely many elements in J.
Then assume that θ = p
q ∈S ∩Q, where p and q do not have common factors = 1. Then we have
two possibilities:
(i)
q is an odd integer
(ii)
q is an even integer.
(i) If q is an odd integer, then the q numbers
̺0p, (̺0 + 2) p, . . . , (̺0 + 2q −2) p
(mod q)
are mutually diﬀerent, because p
q ∈Q cannot be further reduced. Then divide by q, and we get,
modulo 1, all numbers in the sequence
(4.34)
0, 1
q , . . . , q −1

possibly in a diﬀerent order. If q > 3, then at least one of the numbers of (4.34) lies in the interior of
J, because |J| = 1
3. If q = 3, then clearly 1
3 ∈J.
Hence it follows that the sequence

(2k + 1)p
q (mod 1)

k∈N0
has inﬁnitely many elements lying in J,
when the denominator q is an odd number.
(ii) If q is even, then p must be an odd integer. The q
2 numbers
̺0p, (̺0 + 2) p, (̺0 + 4) p, . . . , (̺0 + q −2) p,
are all odd and mutually diﬀerent modulo q. When we divide by q, we obtain, modulo 1, all numbers

If 2
q < 1

Let θ ∈S, and let ̺ = ̺(θ) ∈N be the smallest odd number ≥̺0, such that ̺ · θ (mod 1) belongs to
J. Then (4.33) holds, so

Because the function θ →sin (2π̺ (θ0) · θ) is continuous, there exists an ε = ε (θ0) > 0, such that

Hence, the system of intervals {]θ −ε(θ), θ + ε(θ)[| θ ∈S} is an open covering of the compact (i.e.
closed and bounded) set S. According to Heine-Borel’s covering theorem it contains a ﬁnite covering,
i.e. there exist ﬁnitely many θ1, . . . , θs ∈S, such that
S ⊆

j=1
]θj −ε (θj) , θj + ε (θj)[ .
It follows from the above that to every interval ]θj −ε (θj) , θj + ε (θj)[ there exists a corresponding
odd number ̺ (θj), satisfying the above. Then put
̺S := max {̺ (θj) | j = 1, . . . , s} ,
and it follows that for every θ ∈S there exists a ̺(θ) ≤̺S, such that ̺(θ) has the right properties.
Choose ̺0 = mj. To every x ∈I2j ∪I2j+1 there is a constant k = kx,j ∈N, lying between mj and
m′
j := ̺S, such that (1) and (3) both hold. If we ﬁnally choose mj+1 > 2mj = 2̺S, then (2) is also
fulﬁlled, and the lemma is proved. □
Let m0 = 2n(2n+ 1), cf. (4.31), and let m0 < m1 < · · · < mn be determined according to Lemma 4.2.

where the Km(t) are Fej´er’s kernels. One should, however, notice that the sequence (mi) is not chosen
in the same way as in Section 4.5. It is obvious that every fn in nonnegative with 1

Lemma 4.3 Let ϕn be given by (4.30), and fn by (4.35). Put Fn := fn + ϕn.
To every j ∈N, where 0 ≤j ≤n −√n, and every x ∈I2j ∪I2j+1, there exists k ∈N, such that
1
2mj+1 > k ≥mj > m0, and such that
(4.38)
Sk(x; Fn) ≥C · ln n.
Proof. We know that ϕn(x) ≥n, so when k is chosen as above, then
Sk(x; Fn) = Sk(x; fn) + Sk(x; ϕn) + ϕn ≥C · ln n.
□
Lemma 4.4 There exists an N ∈N, such that if n ≥N and m0 = 2n(2n + 1), then

Proof. It follows from the deﬁnition (4.30) of ϕn that it is a trigonometric polynomial of degree
2n(2n + 1) = m0. Hence,
Sm0(x; Fn) = Sm0(x; fn) + Sm0(x; ϕn) = Sm0(x; fn) + ϕn.
We deﬁned previously δ and I′

In fact, it follows from (4.40) and (4.41) that for N ∈N suﬃciently large,
Sm0(x; Fn) ≥n −C · ln n > 1
2 n,
for all n ≥N,
and (4.39) follows.
Finally we turn to the proof of (4.41). Let p be ﬁxed, and choose any x ∈I′

Lemma 4.5 There exists a sequence of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials (Fn) of order (νn),
where ν1 < ν2 < · · · , and all of constant term 1
2, such that the following conditions are fulﬁlled:
To every n ∈N there exist a constant An ∈R and a set En ⊆[0, 2π[, and another constant λn ∈N,
such that
1) An →+∞for n →+∞,
2) E1 ⊂E2 ⊂· · ·
and
+∞
n=1 En = [0, 2π[,
3) λn →+∞for n →+∞,
4) to every x ∈En there exists a k = k(x) ∈N, such that λn ≤k ≤νn and
Sk(x; Fn) > An.
Proof. Choose Fn := fn + ϕn, where fn is given by (4.35) and ϕn by (4.30). Since every fn and
every ϕn have the constant term 1
2, every Fn has the constant term 1. Furthermore, the orders of the
Fn as trigonometric polynomials are strictly increasing.
We deﬁne
En :=

0, 4π(n −√n)
2n + 1

Then it follows from (4.38) of Lemma 4.3, and (4.39) of Lemma 4.4 that to every n ≥N and every
x ∈E2n there exists a k > 2n(2n + 1), such that for some constant C > 0,
Sk(x; Fn) ≥C · ln n.
The remaining conditions of the lemma follow by putting An = C ·ln n for n ≥N (and an appropriate
An for n < N) and λn = 2n(2n + 1). □
Theorem 4.3 There exists a function f ∈L1([0, 2π[), such that its Fourier series is divergent every-
where.
Proof. We choose the sequence of functions (Fn) as in Lemma 4.5. Then choose n1, such that
An1 > 0. Determine by induction a sequence (ni) of natural numbers ni ∈N, such that
(a)
λni > νni−1,
(b)

Due to the linearity, the section Sp(x; f) is split in the same way,
(4.43)
Sp(x; f) = Sp(x, u) + Sp(x; v) + Sp(x, w).
When we apply Lemma 4.5 (4), we ﬁnd k = k(x, i), such that λni ≤k ≤νni, and such that
(4.44)
Sk(x; v) =

Sk(x; Fni) >

Furthermore, it follows from (a) that
(4.45)

Finally, we notice that for every x ∈[0, 2π[ there exists an i0 ∈N, such that x ∈Eni for all i ≥i0.
Then it follows from (4.36) and Lemma 4.5 (1) that the Fourier series of f is divergent everywhere in
[0, 2π[, and the theorem is proved. 
It is obvious that it is not possible to specify all coeﬃcients an, bn explicitly for such divergent Fourier
series for a function from L1([0, 2π[).

Some “wild” Hilbert spaces
In most introductory descriptions of Functional Analysis one only considers separable Hilbert spaces,
i.e. Hilbert spaces which contains a countable dense subset. The reason is that a Hilbert space has
a countable orthonormal basis, if and only if it is separable. The prototype of a separable Hilbert
space is L2([0, 2π[), or equivalently – and more convenient for our purposes in this section – the space
L2([−π, π[) where the interval [−π, π[ has the center x = 0. We shall start with
4.7.1
Short review of the standard Hilbert space L2([−π, π[)
We shall for convenience assume that we are dealing with complex separable Hilbert spaces over the
ﬁeld of complex numbers C. It can be proved that there is essentially only one such separable Hilbert
space, because they are all mutually isomorphic. We can therefore restrict ourselves to the standard
example. Notice for the geometrical mind, that the Hilbert space in some sense is the generalisation
of the Euclidean spaces En of dimension n ∈N to inﬁnite dimension. We may therefore expect some
deﬁnitions which have a ring of Geometry, like e.g. inner product and orthogonality, and these concepts
are indeed essential in the theory of Hilbert spaces.
We shall in this section consider the standard example of a separable Hilbert space over C, namely
L2([−π, π[). Recall that an element f ∈L2([−π, π[) is a (measurable) function on [−π, π[), for which
the norm f2 of f is ﬁnite,
f2 :=

1
2π
 π
−π
|f(t)|2 dt.
Remark 4.4 In practice, all functions in daily life are measurable, so we shall not worry here about
his extra assumption. We shall in Chapter 6 return to the non-measurable sets and show that they
have some really strange properties, which are impossible to realize in the ordinary world. They only
exist in the theoretical minds of the mathematicians, including the author’s. ♦

should be no surprise for the reader that the properties are the same. It also follows from Cauchy-
Schwarz’s inequality, cf. Section 2.1, that f, g is well-deﬁned for f, g ∈L2([−π, π[), and that
|f, g| ≤f2g2,
and
f, f = f2
2.
Furthermore, it is easy to prove that the double inﬁnite sequence of functions
(4.47)
{en | n ∈Z} ,
where en(t) := eint for t ∈R,
with respect to this inner product is an orthonormal sequence in L2([−π, π[). This means that

Fourier series
All this is well-known from the Theory of Fourier series, and this is actually the reason why we focus
so much on the Fourier series. They provide us, when they are equipped with the right generalisation
of the inner product, with a natural generalisation of the Euclidean spaces to a space of inﬁnite

The sign ∼in (4.48) indicates that the two expressions are not necessarily equal in a pointwise sense.
They are, however, equal in L2-sense. Formula (4.48) corresponds to the usual expansion of a vector
in an Euclidean space with respect to an orthonormal basis. In the present situation the functions
{en | n ∈Z} play the same role as the basis vectors in the Euclidean space. We notice that Pythagoras’s

Recall that according to Carleson-Hunt’s theorem, cf. Section 4.4 or Jørsboe & Mejlbro [28], we have
for the Hilbert space L2([−π, π[) pointwise equality almost everywhere in [−π, π[ in (4.8). This is
very convenient from a physical and engineering point of view. Mathematicians may still consider
Carleson-Hunt’s theorem as a very strange phenomenon.
4.7.2
Kadec’s 1
4-theorem
It was emphasized above that the theory of Fourier series is very important in the sciences of Mathe-
matics, Physics and Engineering. However, from the point of view of practical applications it is often
neglected that signals only seldom can be expanded into oscillations of the form of linear combinations
of eint, where n ∈Z, or similarly. One simple example is the vibrating string with inhomogeneous
density. Such a situation occurs e.g. when one tries to tune a worn-out string of a guitar. Fortunately
it is still possible to deal with such a situation. Here we again have a strange result, namely
Kadec’s 1
4-theorem. Let (λn)n∈Z be a sequence of complex numbers, for which there exists a constant
c ∈


, such that for all n ∈Z,
|λn −n| ≤c.
For every f ∈L2([−π, π[) there exists an uniquely determined sequence (cn)n∈Z of complex numbers,
such that

It is possible to prove that the constant 1
4 is the best possible. The proof of the theorem is easy, if we
furthermore assume that c < ln 2
π , cf. e.g. Riesz & Sz.-Nagy [47], and I have even once used it in one
of my exams. However, if ln 2

A mathematical model of the vibrating string with inhomogeneous density describe the impurities of
the materials by replacing numbers from Z by perturbed numbers {λn | n ∈Z}, which may even be a
set of complex numbers. It can be proved that in the case of the vibrating string then all λn are real.
4.7.3
The Besicovitch space
Kadec’s 1
4-theorem makes it possible to use other oscillations than the usual ones. It also inspires one
to allow even orthogonal systems of higher cardinality. We shall here sketch, how we introduce the
Besicovich space B2, which is a non-separable Hilbert space. More precisely, the non-countable set of
functions
{eλ | λ ∈R} ,
where eλ : R →C, eλ(t) := eiλt for λ ∈R,
becomes a non-countable orthonormal set. In particular, the Besicovitch space contains all elements
of the form
f ∼
+∞

n=−∞
cn eiλnt,
where
+∞

n=−∞
|cn|2 < +∞,
and where the real sequence (λn) is not necessarily the familiar sequence (n)n∈Z.
Let V = span

eiλt | λ ∈R

. This means that every element of V is a ﬁnite linear combination of
functions of the type eiλt, λ ∈R. It is obvious that V with the usual operations of calculation becomes
a complex vector space.
We deﬁne a bilinear function ·, · : V × V →C by
(4.49)
f, g := lim sup
T →+∞

2T
 T
−T
f(t)g(t) dt
for f, g ∈V.
When we compare this bilinear function with the inner product of L2([−π, π[), we notice that we
in both cases integrate over a symmetric interval and then divide by the length of the interval of
integration. In the present case we furthermore let the length of the interval tend towards +∞. Some
very simple calculations, which are left to the reader, show that V indeed becomes a vector space over
C with an inner product given by (4.49). We shall take all this for granted in the following. By the
usual process of completion we get B2 := V.
We shall ﬁnally show some simple properties of the Besicovitch space B2.
For ﬁxed λ ∈R we get

It follows that {eλ | λ ∈R} is a non-countable orthonormal set of functions from B2 with respect to
this inner product. Since we have found a non-countable set of basis vectors, the space B2 cannot be
a separable Hilbert space.
It is possible by using Parseval’s eguation to prove that to every f ∈B2 there exists a countable
sequence (λn)n∈N of real numbers, and another countable sequence (cn)n∈N of complex numbers, such
that

and we shall never get into the situation, where we have to sum over a noncountable set of λ-s.
Notice that we have deﬁned a totally diﬀerent inner product in B2 than in L2([−π, π[). Therefore,
this result does not contradict Kadec’s 1
4-theorem.

Fourier series
Historical remarks
Obviously, if (λn)n∈Z = (n)n∈Z in (4.50), then we get the usual Fourier series.
The structure of these usual Fourier series inspired Harald Bohr [8], [9], [10], in 1923 to generalise
the Fourier series by allowing more general exponents of the exponential function eiλt. In total Bohr
wrote 54 papers on this subject, where we here only refer to the ﬁrst three of them.
One must here realise that in 1923 Lebesgue’s theory of integration from 1907 had not yet been applied
to form the Hilbert spaces, so these were not known to Bohr. His idea was instead to consider the
closed hull of all ﬁnite sums of the form
(4.51)
n

j=1
aj eiλjt,
λ1, . . . , λn ∈R,
with respect to the well-known uniform norm
f∞:= sup
t∈R
|f(t)|.
Well, (4.51) above is not Bohr’s original deﬁnition, but it gives a shortcut to explain his idea without
being too technical. The advantage of this choice is of course that everyone of Bohr’s almost periodic
functions are bounded and continuous, because they can be written as a limit of a uniformly convergent
sequence of continuous functions of the form (4.51).
It is noteworthy to see that Bohr actually uses Hilbert space methods before the Hilbert space theory
was known. In fact, Bohr ﬁrst introduces the mean value operator,
M{f(t)} := lim sup
T →+∞

and considers in particular,
(4.52)
M

|f(t)|2

|f(t)|2 dt.
Bohr even proves the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
|M{f(t)g(t)}| ≤

M {|f(t)|2}

M {|g(t)|2},
for the mean value operator given above.
Furthermore, he proves Parseval’s equation, which is a very deep result. More precisely, if f(t) is
almost periodic in the sense of Bohr, then we have the expansion
f(t) ∼

With all the clues above it is a pity, though one cannot blame Bohr, that he misses to see that if f
and g are almost periodic functions in his sense, then
f, g := M{f(t)g(t)}
is actually (almost) an inner product and the extension to the full Hilbert space is today an easy
exercise. This was left to Besicovitch, who introduced the general Banach spaces Bp, p ≥1. In these
spaces we deﬁne a seminorm  · p by
fp
p := lim sup

|f(t)|p dt,
f ∈Bp,
whenever fp < +∞. This is, however, not a norm. Let e.g. f = 0 be continuous and 0 outside
a bounded set. Then clearly fp = 0, so we have to restrict ourselves to the quotient space with
respect to the nullspace {f | fp = 0}. Two functions f and g then belong to the same equivalence
class, if f −gp = 0, in which case they are considered as equal. The set of all equivalence classes
with respect to this nullspace becomes our Banach space Bp. It can be proved that when p = 2, then
we precisely get B2 with the norm given by (4.52), i.e.

Continuous curves
5.1
Introduction
We shall in this chapter go through two classical examples of space ﬁlling curves. We consider in
Section 5.2 the famous Peano’s curve,, and in Section 5.3 we modify Peano’s curve to get Osgood’s
curve.. When we ﬁnally in Section 5.4 combine Peano’s curve with Cantor’s function, introduced in
Section 3.3, we get a curve passing though every point of the unit square, i.e. its graph has positive
area 1, and yet this curve is “almost everywhere” (in the parameter domain) “almost nowhere” (in
the range, i.e. it lies almost nowhere in the unit square). In particular, it follows that nullsets are not
necessarily mapped into nullsets by a continuous map.
Obviously, we must reconsider what is meant by a continuous curve. From time to time one comes
across in the literature the following heuristic deﬁnition of a continuous curve,
Pseudo deﬁnition. “The graph of a continuous curve is an inﬁnitely thin line, which can be drawn
without lifting the pencil from the paper.”
This “deﬁnition” is of course very convenient in most practical cases, because it contains the idea of a
curve. However, it implicit assumes that the curve is smooth in some sense and not just continuous.
E.g. piecewise diﬀerentiable.
Once Weierstraß in 1861 constructed a continuous function, which
was not diﬀerentiable anywhere, cf. Section 1.6, his result implicitly also implied that the pseudo
deﬁnition above was far too imprecise, though the mathematical society still did not react. The next
step forward in the direction of a reconsideration was given by Peano [43] in 1890, when he constructed
a continuous curve in the plane, which went through every point of the unit square, in which case the
pseudo deﬁnition above clearly does not apply.
We shall in Section 5.2 go through the classical construction of Peano without using the alternative
construction of David Hilbert.
Peano’s curve contained a lot of double points. Then in 1903 Osgood [42] modiﬁed Peano’s construc-
tion and constructed a curve without double points, such that the area of its graph is ≥1 −ε, where
ε ∈]0, 1[ is any given constant. The editor of Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. must in 1903 have thought
that this example was very extraordinary, because Osgood’s contribution was supplied with attached
ﬁgures in colour to describe his procedure. This must have been very expensive in those days. We
shall here not go that far.
Osgood’s curve is also classical stuﬀ, so we describe the construction in Section 5.3. This is a curve
without double points in the unit square, and yet its graph has an area ≥1 −ε, where ε ∈]0, 1[ can
be chosen as small as we want.
Instead of the pseudo deﬁnition above we shall in the following use the more precise
Deﬁnition 5.1 Let I ⊂R be an interval, and let ϕ : I →R2 be a continuous map. We then call ϕ a
continuous curve in the plane.
We shall in the beginning also assume that I is bounded and closed, i.e. compact, because then it
follows from one of the main theorems of continuous functions that then the range ϕ(I) is compact,
i.e. bounded and closed.
We mention that if I is not bounded, or not closed, then ϕ(I) may be unbounded.

Continuous curves
Then recall another main theorem from the elementary mathematical analysis.
Theorem 5.1 Assume that fn : I →R2 is an uniform Cauchy sequence of continuous functions.
Then the limit function f : I →R2 of (fn) exists, and it is continuous.
5.2
Peano’s curve
The idea of the construction of Peano’s curve is to construct an uniform Cauchy sequence of continuous
functions
fn : [0, 1] →[0, 1] × [0, 1] = [0, 1]2,
for n ∈N0,
such that
a) The sequence of functions (fn) converges uniformly towards a continuous function f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2.
b) For every point (x, y) ∈[0, 1]2 there exists a parameter t ∈I, such that f(t) = (x, y).
The limit function f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2, which is called Peano’s curve, is continuous and its graph is
passing through every point of the unit square, so this will solve our problem.
We deﬁne (fn) inductively. First put
f0(t) := (t, t),
for t ∈[0, 1].
Figure 5.1: The structure of the graph of the function f1 : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2.
The ordering of the
subsquares is indicated by the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 9.
We then deﬁne f1 : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2, based on Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.2: The order of the numbering of the subsquares
Choose the diagonal of this subsquare and let it be traversed in the same direction as given by the
order of the subsquares of Figure 5.2. If f1 maps the subinterval
k −1
9
, k
9

onto this oriented diagonal
of constant speed, then we obtain a continuous curve f1 : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 as given on Figure 5.1
Then notice that every subsquare is a micro cosmos, which is similar to f0 : [01] →[0, 1]2. In both
cases we have a square with a directed diagonal traversed at a constant speed. If we for f1 consider
the subinterval
k −1
9
, k
9

with its corresponding subsquare Qk of edge length 1
3, then divide Qk into
9 smaller subsquares of edge length 1
9 = 1
32 , and order them according to Figure 5.2 and the direction
of the diagonal, speciﬁed by f1. Similarly, divide the subinterval
k −1
9
, k
9

into 9 smaller intervals,
and let the m-th of these be the parameter interval of the directed diagonal of the m-th subsquare of
Qk. This is just a repetition of the previous construction at a smaller scale, so when we glue all pieces
together, we get a continuous map f2 : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2.
For later use we notice that f2 maps the interval
k −1

connected with the previous map f1 into
precisely the same subsquare Qk. So when we iterate this construction to get f3, f4, . . . , all these will
always map

into the same subsquare Qk as f2. In particular, for every n ∈N and every

very similar to the methods much later used in the construction of fractals. ♦

Since this estimate holds for every t ∈[0, 1], it follows for m, n ≥N,
fm −fn∞:= sup
t∈[0,1]
|fm(t) −fn(t)| < ε,
and we have proved that (fn) is an uniform Cauchy sequence. We infer from Theorem 5.1 that it has
a continuous limit function, i.e. a curve, f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2.
The interval [0, 1] is compact, i.e. closed and bounded, and the limit function f is continuous, so by one
of the main theorems of continuous functions the range f([0, 1]) ⊆[0, 1]2 is also closed and bounded.
We shall only prove that f([0, 1]) = [0, 1]2. It suﬃces to prove that to every point (x, y) ∈[0, 1]2 and
to every ε > 0 there exists a point (x0, y0) ∈f([0, 1]), such that
(5.1)
|(x, y) −(x0 −y0)| =

(x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 < ε.
In fact, if (5.1) holds, then choose the sequence (ε), εn := 1
n, to obtain by (5.1) a sequence ((xn, yn))n∈N
from the closed set f([0, 1]) converging towards the point (x, y) under consideration. The point (x, y)
must lie in the closure of f([0, 1]), which is f([0, 1]) itself.
We turn to the proof of (5.1). Let (x, y) ∈[0, 1]2 and ε > 0 be given. We choose as above N ∈N,
such that 3−N√
2 < ε. Then choose the subsquare Q at level N, for which (x, y) ∈I. The image of
the function fN includes the diagonal of I, and k · 3−N is mapped into the same point by all functions
fm, m ≥N, accordingly also by the limit function f.
Each corner (x0, y0) ∈f([0, 1]) of the subsquare Q has a distance < ε from any other point in Q, so
we conclude that
|(x, y) −(x0, y0)| < ε,
and (5.1) is proved. □

Continuous curves
Theorem 5.2 There exists a continuous curve, which runs through every point of the unit square.
It is not hard to construct a generalised Peano’s curve which runs through all points of the plane. We
only have to allow the parameter interval to be R. That I previously was chosen bounded was only
due to some technicalities in the basic construction.
Figure 5.3: The ordering of all squares in the plane. Peano’s curve runs through a diagonal, so one
must check that the diagonals match each others at their endpoints. This is possible by the ordering
in the double spiral on the ﬁgure.
The basic Peano curve goes from one diagonal point to the opposite diagonal point. We shall just be
convinced that it is possible to glue together inﬁnitely many Peano curves to get an inﬁnite continuous
Peano curve, which runs through every point of the plane R2. The simplest possibility is shown on
Figure 5.3. The double spiral indicates the ordering of the subsquares, such that every endpoint of
one chosen diagonal of one subsquare is identical with the initial point of the chosen diagonal in the
next subsquare. This construction is obviously possible.
Another extension is to a space ﬁlling curve f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]3 in the 3-dimensional space R3. The
basic construction is easily illustrated by Rubik’s cube. We consider the unit cube and start by moving
along the diagonal from the point (0, 0, 0) to the point (1, 1, 1). Then apply the 2-dimensional Peano
construction, described above with the only modiﬁcation that we instead always use the 3-dimensional
diagonal. So if a diagonal of a subcube starts from a point at the lower face of a layer of Rubik’s
cube, then it will always end at the upper face of this layer, and vice versa. Since we move through an
odd number of subcubes, namely 9, and start at a point on the lower face, we shall end at the upper
face of the lowest layer of Rubik’s cube. This is, however, the lower face of the middle layer, so the
process can be repeated, until we end at the upper face of the middle layer, which also is the lower
face of the upper layer, and the procedure is then obvious, because we just repeat this construction
of al subcubes of the next level of division, etc.. The proof itself is just a repetition of the previously
given concerning the plane Peano curve with obvious modiﬁcations.
It is left as an exercise to the reader to ﬁnd an ordering of all unit cubes in R3, such that we by this
construction obtain a continuous curve, which runs through all points of R3.

Continuous curves
The extension to a similar construction to general RN is almost obvious. It is also left to the reader.
An immediate consequence of Theorem 5.2 is that it is possible continuously to map a line segment
(of area zero) onto a set of positive area. One might here object that the parameter interval I = [0, 1]
has the 1-dimensional measure 1 in the space R, and that we are dealing with two diﬀerent spaces.
Unfortunately, it is not so simple that images of continuous maps and of positive area stem from sets
of positive area in the parameter interval. A counterexample is given in Section 5.4, in which we
construct a curve, where a nullset of the parameter interval is mapped continuously onto a set of area
1. So measure is not preserved by continuous functions. We must add some extra conditions to obtain
such a desirable result.
As a preparation of Section 5.3 we repeat the fact that already the function f1 has double points,
thus also following functions fn, as well as the limit function f. In particular, f is not injective. It is
possible to prove that if the range f([0, 1]) of a continuous curve contains interior points, then f cannot
be injective. Notice that this is by no way contradicting the construction in Section 5.3. Although
Osgood’s curve has a positive area, it cannot have inner points, because it is injective, so its interior
is the empty set.
5.3
Osgood’s curve
In this section we show that using a simple modiﬁcation of the construction of Peano’s curve we are
able to deﬁne an injective continuous curve of positive area. More precisely, to every ε > 0 there exists
a continuous curve f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2, such that
a) The map f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 is injective, i.e. if f(s) = f(t) for s, t ∈[0, 1], then s = t.
b) area(f([0, 1]) ≥1 −ε.
We shall here more or less follow Osgood [42], but since much of the construction is the same as for
the Peano curve in Section 5.2, we may at some points be brief.
Let ε ∈]0, 1[ be given, and put εn = 2−nε. Then

for k = 1, . . . , 17.
The unit square is at ﬁrst divided into 9 subsquares of equal size like in Peano’s construction, but
since the ﬁrst level has been given the constant ε1 = ε/2, we furthermore cut out a “tartan” of [0, 1]2
along the division lines of a total area of ε1 = ε/2, such that we get 9 smaller squares, each of which

, and such that these remaining closed subsquares are mutually disjoint. We order
the subsquares according to Peano’s pattern, through the nine odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, . . . , 15, 17.
We map the interval

for k odd into the diagonal of subsquare number k as shown on
Figure 5.4, like in the construction of Peano’s curve.
If k is even, this part of the curve is the

By this process we obtain that all double points in Peano’s construction are removed, so f1 does not
have any double point. On the other hand, we have in the following lost an area ≤ε1.
In the construction of f2 : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 we remove a “tartan” from each of the nine subsquares of
Figure 5.4, of a total area ε2, so we remove an area of the size

Continuous curves
We repeat the process already given for f1 on each of the subsquares following the same pattern as
for Peano’s curve, with the following modiﬁcation. If for some t ∈[0, 1], the point f1(t) lies on a line
segment between two of the subsquares, then
f1(t) = f2(t) = f3(t) = · · · = f(t)
in the limit.
In general, if fN(t) lies on such a connecting line segment, then
fN(t) = fN+1(t) = fN+2(t) = · · · = f(t)
in the limit.
Proceed in this way.
In the n-th step of this iteration we remove a “tartan” from each of the 3n subsquares of a total area
of εn, and then construct the continuous curve fn : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2, following the iterative description
above.
We prove almost in the same way as in Section 5.2 that (fn) is uniformly convergent.
The only
modiﬁcation is that on the connecting line segments this uniform convergence is trivial, because
the sequence (fn(t)) for ﬁxed t is constant eventually. We therefore conclude that the limit curve
f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 exists and is a continuous function.
The range of the limit curve f([0, 1]) consists of all points of the square [0, 1]2, which do not belong
to any of the removed “tartans”. Hence,
area(f([0, 1])) = 1 −
+∞

εn = 1 −ε > 0.
Finally, we shall prove that the map f is injective. If t1 < t2, then there exists an n ∈N, such that

17n .
If f (t1) and f (t2) belong to the same line segment between two squares, then they must be diﬀerent,
f (t1) = f (t2), because the line segment does not contain double points.
If f (t1) and f (t2) belong to diﬀerent line segments, or one point a line segment and the other one
some square from level n, or two diﬀerent subsquares from level n, then obviously f (t1) = f (t2).
The remaining possibility is that f (t1) and f (t2) belong to the same k-th square from level n. This
is, however, not possible, because this would require that t1, t2 ∈

, contradicting the
assumption (5.2).
We conclude that f is injective. Summing up we have proved
Theorem 5.3 To every given ε ∈]0, 1[ there exists a continuous and injective curve f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2,
such that
area(f([0, 1])) ≥1 −ε.
The curve constructed above is called Osgood’s curve. It can be used to illustrate the diﬃculties of
the following classical theorem. We shall ﬁrst introduce some terminology. Every injective curve,

Continuous curves
i.e. without double points, is called a simple curve. A Jordan curve is a simple curve, except for its
coinciding endpoints, i.e. a Jordan curve is a closed curve. Every Jordan curve in the plane divides
R2 into three mutually disjoint subsets, namely the Jordan curve itself, the open interior of the curve,
and the open exterior of the curve. The classical result is the following theorem,
Jordan’s curve theorem. The complementary set of a Jordan curve in the plane has a bounded and
an unbounded connected component.
Figure 5.5: Sketch of a nontrivial Jordan curve of positive area. The four copies of Osgood’s curve
are indicated by squares with a diagonal to show the direction of the curve.
The complications of Jordan’s curve theorem may be illustrated in the following way. If we combine
four copies of Osgood’s curve as indicated on Figure 5.5 and with the connecting line segments, we
obtain a Jordan curve of positive area contained in the unit square [0, 1]2 and of area 1 −ε, where
ε ∈]0, 1[ can be any constant. One can easily imagine that the proof of Jordan’s curve theorem must
be diﬃcult, because how do we decide whether a point in [0, 1]2 not lying on the Jordan curve itself
is an interior or an exterior point? Notice that the Jordan curve is closed, so the complementary
set is open. In particular, the bounded component, i.e. the interior of the curve, is open, hence even
curve connected. This means that every two points inside the Jordan curve can be connected by a
continuous curve, which does not intersect the Jordan curve. When one considers the construction of
Osgood’s curve it does not look like an easy job to connect two such points in the interior.
As already mentioned above, another strange observation is that one can deﬁne a Jordan curve in
[0, 1]2, such that its area is ≥1 −ε for any given ε ∈]0, 1[. By a remark in Section 5.2 no injective
curve can contain interior points, so the interior of the Jordan curve itself is empty, and it must be
the boundary of the much smaller set in area of all points lying inside the curve.

A space ﬁlling curve, which is almost everywhere almost nowhere, and

The headline of this section is more precisely interpreted in the following way
Theorem 5.4 There exist a continuous curve ϕ : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 with range ϕ([0, 1]) = [0, 1]2, and
nullsets N1 ⊂[0, 1] and N2 ⊂[0, 1]2, such that
ϕ ([0, 1] \ N1) = N2
and
ϕ (N1) ⊇[0, 1]2 \ N2.

Continuous curves
Furthermore, ϕ is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere with the derivative 0.
Proof. Let Φ : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 be Peano’s curve as described in Section 5.2, and let f denote the
Cantor function as constructed in Section 3.3. We deﬁne a continuous curve ϕ : [0, 1] →[0, 1]2 by the
composition
ϕ(x) := Φ(f(x))
for x ∈[0, 1].
The function f : [0, 1] →[0, 1] is surjective, so it follows from Section 5.1 that
ϕ([0, 1]) = Φ([0, 1]) = [0, 1]2,
proving that the range of ϕ is the unit square.
Let C denote the Cantor set of Section 3.2. If x ∈[0, 1] \ C, then we can ﬁnd an open interval I, such
that
x ∈I ⊂[0, 1] \ C.
The Cantor function is constant on I, hence Φ(y) is constant for y ∈I. In particular, ϕ is diﬀerentiable
almost everywhere with the derivative
ϕ′(x) = 0,
for x ∈[0, 1] \ C.
It follows from the construction of the Cantor function that the range of [0, 1] \ C is countable, hence
a nullset, so the curve is “almost nowhere” in the unit square, almost everywhere in the parameter
interval. It therefore follows that
ϕ(C) ⊇ϕ([0, 1]) \ ϕ([0, 1] \ C).
This means that the Cantor set C, which is a nullset in the parameter interval, is mapped onto a set
⊆[0, 1]2 of area 1, and the theorem is proved. □
The traditional error of jumping to conclusions is of course, “when ϕ′ = 0 almost everywhere, then
the range is a nullset”. The example above shows that this claim is far from true.

Nonmeasurable sets
6.1
Introduction
The nonmeasurable sets are very strange objects, which will be demonstrated in this chapter. We
start in Section 6.2, where we show the standard example of a non-measurable set. We are in this
construction forced to apply the dubious axiom of choice, which implies that it cannot be constructed
in a physical way.
For the same reason it is not possible to illustrate any nonmeasurable set on
a ﬁgure. In other words, nonmeasurable sets in practice only exist in the minds of mathematicians.
Whenever we consider a theory reﬂecting something from the real world, then the functions are always
measurable. We mention here Hausdorﬀ’s paradox, which will be given in Section 6.4. It implies that
if one explicitly could construct (i.e. physically) nonmeasurable sets, then one would be able cut the
unit ball into 10 non-measurable pieces, where the four of them could be joined together to form
another full unit ball, just as the remaining six can be joined together to make up a full unit ball,
so we would have a means to double everything without making holes, i.e. without leaving out any
point. Practice from Physics shows that this is not possible in the real world.
6.2
A nonmeasurable set
We shall in this section “construct” a subset of R, which is not Lebesgue measurable. The doubtful
of this “construction” is that it applies the plausible axiom of choice. However, even if the axiom
of choice is intuitively “obvious”, its consequences are not!
We shall later give some other weird
examples relying only on the axiom of choice, such like dividing the solid unit ball into jigsaw pieces,
which are then put together in a diﬀerent way to form two solid unit balls without missing any point!
For the time being we shall assume the axiom of choice, cf. Section 6.3.
Let ∼denote the relation in R, which is deﬁned by
x ∼y
if and only if
x −y ∈Q.
Then ∼is reﬂexive, i.e. x ∼x (in fact, x −x = 0 ∈Q) and symmetric (in fact, x ∼y implies that
y −x ∈Q, hence y ∼x), and transitive. In fact, if x ∼y and y ∼z, then x ∼z, because x −y ∈Q
and y −z ∈Q implies that x −z = (x −y) + (y −z) ∈Q.
A reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive relation ∼on R is an equivalence relation on R, so R can be
written as a disjoint union of equivalence classes. A point x ∈R belongs to the equivalence class
X := {y ∈R | x ∼y} = {y ∈R | y = x + q for some q ∈Q} = {x} + Q.
Every x ∈R belongs to some class X, and since two classes, X and Y , with respect to ∼are either
disjoint or identical, we can write
R =

i∈I
Xi,
where I is some index set, where each Xi = ∅, and where the Xi are mutually disjoint.
The set Q is dense in R, and since Xi = {xi} + Q for some xi ∈R, every Xi is also dense in R. We
therefore conclude that
(6.1)
To every x ∈I there exists an xi ∈Xi ∩[0, 1].

Nonmeasurable sets
At this step we apply the axiom of choice. Choose one representative xi for each class Xi, such that
(6.1) is fulﬁlled, and deﬁne the set
(6.2)
A := {xi | i ∈I} ⊂[0, 1].
We mention here that the Lebesgue measure is translation invariant. This means that if the measure
|A| of a set A exists, and if we deﬁne
{c} + A := {c + x | x ∈A},
then {c} + A is also Lebesgue measurable, and |{c} + A| = |A|. Furthermore, if B = 
n An, where
the An are mutually disjoint and Lebesgue measurable, then B is also Lebesgue measurable, and its
measure is given by
|B| =

n
|An| ,
where we allow the value +∞.
It is possible to prove these intuitive properties of the Lebesgue
measure.
We shall prove that the set A given by (6.2) is not Lebesgue measurable. We have the following three
possibilities, of which precisely one must hold,
a) A is Lebesgue measurable, and |A| = 0.
b) A is Lebesgue measurable, and |A| > 0.
a) A is not Lebesgue measurable.
We shall in the following show that neither a) nor b) is possible, inferring that we are in case c).
a) Assume that |A| = 0, i.e. A is a Lebesgue nullset. Then we can write R as a disjoint union in the
following way,
R =

i∈I
Xi =

i∈I
{xi + q | q ∈Q} =

q∈Q

i∈I
{xi + q} =

q∈Q
(A + {q}).
The Lebesgue measure is translation invariant, thus |A + {q}| = |A| = 0, and we have written R as a
countable union of nullsets. This implies the contradiction that R itself is a nullset. Hence, case a) is
not possible.
b) Then assume that A is Lebesgue measurable and |A| > 0. Consider the set B ⊆[0, 2] deﬁned by
B :=

q∈Q∩[0,1]
(A + {q}) =
+∞

n=1
(A + {qn}) =
+∞

n=1
An,
where we have written Q ∩[0, 1] = {qn | n ∈N} as a sequence, and put An := A + {qn}. It follows
from the deﬁnition of A that if m = n, then Am ∩An = ∅. Finally, since B ⊆[0, 2] and the An are
mutually disjoint, we get the following contradiction
2 ≥|B| =
+∞

n=1
|An| = |A|

1 = +∞.
We therefore conclude that A is not Lebesgue measurable, so we have proved

6.3
The axiom of choice
We have already pointed out that the questionable of the construction is the application of the axiom
of choice, when we from (6.1) choose an “explicit” xi ∈Xi from the equivalence class Xi.
This
assumption is extremely plausible, but nevertheless it can neither be proved nor disproved within the
present system of axioms. We must either add this property or its negation as an extra axiom. We
formulate
The axiom of choice. Let M = ∅be any nonempty set, and let D(M) denote the system of all
subsets of M. There exists a function
u : D(M) \ {∅} →M,
such that
u(A) ∈A
for every A ∈D(M) \ {∅}.
In other words, there is a function u, which explicitly selects an element from every subset = ∅. This
is of course easy to construct, if M has a ﬁnite number n of elements, in which case D(M) \ {∅}
consists of 2n −1 nonempty subsets. We just line them all up and choose an element in each of them,
deﬁning in this way the function u.
If M, however, has inﬁnitely many elements, the method above does no longer apply. It can be proved
that D(N) has as many elements as the set R of all real numbers, so it is no longer possible to line
them all up in a table. It is even worse in the present case, where we constructed the nonmeasurable
set A given by (6.2). We chose M = R and then tacitly applied the axiom of choice on the large set
D(R) \ {∅}. The set D(R) contains more elements then there are in R itself.
It can be proved that if the present system of mathematical axioms is consistent, it remains consistent
whether we add the axiom of choice or its negation. Axioms are characterized by this property.
To illustrate what is meant by this we consider another famous axiom, the parallel axiom in the
Euclidean geometry.
The parallel axiom. Two parallel straight lines are either coinciding, or they are never intersecting
each other.
Its negation is
The negated parallel axiom. There exist two diﬀerent straight lines, which intersect each other,
The latter axiom is the basic axiom of the non-Euclidean geometry which was developped in the 19th
century.
Let us return to the axiom of choice in order to illustrate some of the problems involved with it. We
have already seen that it implies the existence of really nasty sets. We emphasize the word “existence”,
because there is no constructive way (e.g. an iterative method) to create such a nonmeasurable set.
They exist in the mind of some mathematicians, but never in the real world.
The axiom of choice has far more strange consequences. The most famous is
The well-ordering theorem. Every nonempty set M can be well-ordered.

This means that there exists an ordering relation ≺on M, such that every element a ∈M which is
not the last element, if such an element exists, has a uniquely determined successor b ∈M, i.e. there
is no element c ∈M, such that a ≺c ≺b, i.e. diﬀerent from a and b and lying between them.
Clearly, (R, <) with the usual ordering relation < is not well-ordered, and it is not possible to get any
idea of how to construct a well-ordering (R, ≺) of R.
In connection with the axiom of choice and the well-ordering theorem one usually also mentions
Zorn’s lemma, which mostly is used in mathematical proofs. We shall not formulate Zorn’s lemma,
only mention that the three mentioned statements are mathematically equivalent. Choose any of them
as an axiom, and the other two follows as theorems.
Outside the circles of mathematicians it is most convenient just to accept the axiom of choice, even if
it has some very strange consequences.
As a curiosity we mention that Alan Turing, who knew all the problems with the axiom of choice, in his
thesis, which has been reprinted in [4], tried to develop a theory for at least some of the nonmeasurable
sets. His ideas were to the author’s knowledge never followed up by others, though one never can tell.

The Hausdorﬀparadox
In this section we shall assume the axiom of choice and show that it implies that the unit sphere in
R3 – denoted S in the following – can be divided into ten disjoint subsets, where four of these by only
translations and rotations in space can be put together, such that they form a unit sphere without
missing any point, while the remaining six subsets also can be put together, using only translations
and rotations in another jigsaw puzzle to form another unit sphere, again without missing any point.
If the pieces in this jigsaw puzzle were all measurable sets, this would of course be impossible, because
the measures then would add up in the expected way, and when we consider the areas, we would get
4π = 4π + 4π, or put in another way, 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which clearly is nonsense. Here we claim that it
is possible to double the area using only isometries by allowing non-measurable sets in the division of
S. This is what is called Hausdorﬀ’s paradox.
The paradox is easily derived from a result, ﬁrst proved by Hausdorﬀ[25] in 1914. We shall here more
or less follow the proof given by Sierpinski [50]. This proof can also be found in Sierpinski, Klein,
Runge & Dickson [51].
It is remarkable that the proof only requires a little knowledge of elementary Group Theory, some
knowledge of elementary Geometry, and Calculus at high school level. It is, however, very long, and
the reader must be painstakingly accurate in the arguments. The axiom of choice, cf. Section 6.3,
is used only once in the proof in an apparently very innocent way, and we nevertheless obtain this
paradox.
We shall ﬁrst introduce some terminology.
Deﬁnition 6.1 A map T : R3 →R3 is called an isometry, if it preserves Euclidean distances, i.e.
T x −T y2 = x −y2,
for all x, y ∈R3.
It should be well-known that an isometry T in R3 is either a translation, or a rotation, or a reﬂection,
or a composition of the above mentioned simple isometries. We shall not need the reﬂections in the
following, and the translations are only used at the very end of the construction to put the jigsaw
pieces together, so the proof will mostly be applications of rotations and their compositions.
Deﬁnition 6.2 Two subsets A and B of R3 are said to be congruent, or isometric, if there exists an
isometry T : R3 →R3, such that B = T (A). When A and B are isometric, we write A ∼= B.
Obviously the two deﬁnitions above apply in any Euclidean space. In this section we shall only use
them in R3.
Deﬁnition 6.3 Two subsets A and B of R3 are called n-equivalent,, and we write A =n B, if there
exist 2n subsets A1, . . . , An and B1, . . . , Bn, such that
1) A = n
j=1 Aj and B = n
j=1 Bj.
2) Each of the two systems {Aj | j = 1, . . . , n} and {Bj | j = 1, . . . , n} consists of mutually disjoint
sets.
3) Aj ∼= Bj for all j = 1, . . . , n.

In other words, A =n B, if the two sets each can be divided into n mutually disjoint sets, such that each
subset Aj of A is congruent with the subset Bj of B of the same index.
Given two subsets A and B. If A =n B for some n ∈N, we also say that A and B are equivalent by
ﬁnite decomposition, and we may write A
f= B.
Furthermore, we can also derive the following theorem.
Theorem 6.2 If A =n B and B =

Remark. It is possible to prove that this result cannot be improved. ♦
Proof of Theorem 6.2. It follows from the assumption A =n B that there exist decompositions, such
that
1) A = A1 ∪· · · ∪An and B = B1 ∪· · · ∪Bn.
2) Ak ∩Aℓ= ∅and Bk ∩Bℓ= ∅for 1 ≤k < ℓ≤n,
3) Ak ∼= Bk for k = 1, 2, . . . , n
Similarly, it follows from B =
m C that there exist decompositions
(6.3)
B = B′
1 ∪B′
2 ∪· · · ∪B′
m and C = C1 ∪C2 ∪· · · ∪Cm,
such that
(6.4)
B′
k ∩B′
ℓ= ∅
and
Ck ∩Cℓ= ∅
for 1 ≤k < ℓ≤m,
and
(6.5)
B′
ℓ∼= Cℓ
for ℓ= 1, 2, . . . , m.
It is natural to deﬁne
(6.6)
Bk,ℓ:= Bk ∩B′
ℓ
for 1 ≤k ≤n and 1 ≤ℓ≤m.
Then by 1) and (6.3) and (6.6),
(6.7)
Bk = Bk,1 ∪Bk,2 ∪· · · ∪Bk,m
for 1 ≤k ≤n,
and
(6.8)
B′
k = B1,ℓ∪B2,ℓ∪· · · ∪Bn,ℓ
for 1 ≤ℓ≤m.
Let k, k1 ∈{1, . . . , n} and ℓ, ℓ1 ∈{1, . . ., m}. Then it follows from (6.6) and 2) and (6.4) that
(6.9)
Bk,ℓ∩Bk1,ℓ1 = ∅,
if either k = k1 or ℓ= ℓ1.
Using 3) and (6.7) and 2) and (6.9) we obtain the decomposition
(6.10)
Ak = Ak,1 ∪Ak,2 ∪· · · ∪Ak,m
for k = 1, . . . , n.

It therefore follows for 1 ≤k, k1 ≤n and 1 ≤ℓ, ℓ1 ≤m that
(6.11)
Ak,ℓ∩Ak1,ℓ1 = ∅,
if either k = k1 or ℓ= ℓ1,
and that
(6.12)
Ak,ℓ∼= Bkℓ,
when 1 ≤k ≤n and 1 ≤ℓ≤m.
Analogously, it follows from (6.5) and (6.8) and (6.4) and (6.9) that there exist decompositions
(6.13)
Cℓ= C1,ℓ∪C2,ℓ∪· · · ∪Cn,ℓ
for ℓ= 1, . . . , m,
such that
(6.14)
Ck,ℓ∩Ck1,ℓ1 = ∅,
if either k = k1 or ℓ= ℓ1,
and
(6.15)
Bk,ℓ∼= Ck,ℓ
for 1 ≤k ≤n and 1 ≤ℓ≤m.
Then by 1), (6.3) and (6.13),
(6.16)
A =
n
k=1
m

ℓ=1
Ak,ℓ
and
C =
n

k=1
m

ℓ=1
Ck,ℓ.
We infer from (6.12) and (6.15) that
Ak,ℓ∼= Ck,ℓ
for k = 1, . . . , n and ℓ= 1, . . . , n,
and it ﬁnally follows from (6.16 and (6.11) and (6.14) that A
=
mn = C. □
Corollary 6.1 The relation
f= is transitive, i.e. if A
f= B and B
f= C, then also A
f= C.
We ﬁnally formulate
Hausdorﬀ’s paradox. Let S denote the unit sphere of R3. There exist four disjoint sets A, B, C
and D, where D is a countable set, such that
1) S = A ∪B ∪C ∪D,
2) A ∼= B ∼= C ∼= B ∪C.
We shall later use Hausdorﬀ’s paradox to prove that the unit sphere S can be divided into ten subsets,
such that
S ∼= S1 ∼= S2
and
S =
10 S1 ∪S2,
where S1 and S2 are two mutually disjoint unit spheres.
Proof. Let Φ be a straight line in the XZ-plane through 0, forming the angle ν
2 = 1 radian with
the Z-axis, i.e. ν = 2, cf. Figure 6.1.
Let ψ denote the rotation in the XY Z-space with the Z-axis as its rotational axis, and with the
rotational angle 2π
3 . Similarly, let ϕ denote the rotation in the XY Z-space with rotational axis Φ
and rotational angle π. Finally, I denotes the identical map. Then
(6.17)
ϕ2 = ψ3 = I.

Figure 6.1: The two rotational axes Z and Φ in the proof of Hausdorﬀ’s paradox. The angle between
them is 1 radian.
Let G be the set of all transformations of R3, which are obtained by applying ϕ and ψ a ﬁnite number
of times. it follows easily from (6.17) that G is a group with the usual composition of maps as its
composition. It follows also from (6.17) that every element of G is generated by the four fundamental
factors
I,
ϕ,
ψ
and
ψ2,
in such a way that ϕ is never followed by ϕ (because then ϕ ◦ϕ = ϕ2 = I), and ψ and ψ2 are never
followed by ψ or ψ2, because the composition then can be reduced,
ψ ◦ψ = ψ2,
ψ ◦ψ2 = ψ2 ◦ψ = I,
ψ2 ◦ψ2 = ψ.

Notice in particular that if p ∈Φ \ {0} is a point = 0 on the straight line Φ, then ϕ(ψ(p)) = ψ(ϕ(p)),
so ϕ ◦ψ = ψ ◦ϕ, and G is not an Abelian group.
We divide G into classes. We put G0 := {I}, and let Gn denote the class of all transformations from
G, which can be written as precisely n fundamental factors = I. In particular,
G1 =

ϕ, ψ, ψ2
.
The identiﬁcation of Gn goes by induction. Assume that Gn is known. Then we ﬁnd the elements
of Gn+1 in the following way. Every element from Gn, which starts with a ϕ, is multiplied by either
ψ or ψ2, from the left. Every element from Gn, which starts with either ψ or ψ2, is multiplied by ϕ
from the left. In this way we get
G2 =

ϕψ, ϕψ2, ψϕ, ψ2ϕ

and
G3 =

ϕψϕ, ϕψ2ϕ, ψϕψ, ψϕψ2, ψ2ϕψ, ψ2ϕψ2
,
etc..
The next step is a fairly long proof of the claim that all elements of
G =
+∞

n=0
Gn
are mutually disjoint, so {Gn | n ∈N0} is a division of G into mutually disjoint classes.
With the exception of I and γ = ϕ, every other element of G can be written in one of the following
four possible ways,
(a)
α = ψm1ϕψm2ϕ · · · ψmnϕ,
(b)
β = ϕψm1ϕψm2ϕ · · · ψmn,
(c)
γ = ϕψm1ϕψm2ϕ · · · ψmnϕ,
(d)
δ = ψm1ϕψm2ϕ · · · ψmn,
where n ∈N and m1, . . . , mn ∈{1, 2}.
Let N ∈R3 be any point in space of the coordinates (x, y, z). Then ψ(N) = (x′, y′, z′). Since ψ is a
rotation of the angle 2π
3 with respect to the Z-axis, we describe ψ in coordinates by

(6.18)
a′ = (c −a)λ,

The claim then follows by induction for every α of the structure given by (a).
We notice that it follows from the shorthand λ = −1

Clearly, cos 2 is a transcendental number, i.e. it is not a root in any polynomial of algebraic coeﬃ-
cients. Thus it follows from the above that the point N = (0, 0, 1) is never mapped into itself by any
transformation of the form (a), which means that no transformation of type (a) is the identity.
The next step of the proof is to show that the identity cannot be of any of the types (b), (c), (d)
either. We here give an indirect proof.
Assume that some β ∈G of type (b) is the identity. This means that
β = ϕψm1ϕψm2 · · · ϕψmn = I.
It follows from ϕβϕ = ϕIϕ = ϕ2 = I that
I = ϕβϕ = ψm1ϕψm2ϕ · · · ϕψmnϕ,

so I = ϕβϕ is of type (a), which we previously proved was not possible. Hence, no transformation of
type (b) is equal to the identity I.
Then assume that some δn ∈G of type (d) is the identity, i.e.
δn = ψm1ϕψm2ϕ · · · ϕψmn = I.
Then
ψ3−m1δnψm1 = ψ3−m1Iψm1 = ψ3 = I,
so
σ := ψ3−m1δnψm1 = ψ3ϕψm2ϕ · · · ϕψmnψM−1 = ϕψm2 · · · ϕψmn+m1 = I.
It follows from m1, mn ∈{1, 2}, that m1 + mn ∈{2, 3, 4}. If m1 + mn ∈{2, 4}, then σ = I is of type
(b), which is not possible. If instead m1 + mn = 3, then
σ = ϕψm2ϕ · · · ψmn−1ϕ,
and
ϕσϕ = ψm2ϕ · · · ϕψmn−1 = δn−2 = I,
so ϕσϕ = δn−2 = I is again of type (d), only with fewer factors. Hence, by recursion,
either δ1 = ψm1 = I
or
δ2 = ψm1ϕψm2 = I,
depending on whether n is an odd or an even number. When m1 ∈{1, 2}, then obviously ψm1 = I,
so n cannot be an odd number.

We turn to the other possibility,
δ2 = ψm1ϕψm2 = I.
In this case
ϕ = ψ−m1−m2 ∈

I, ψ, ψ2
,
which is not true. Hence, the assumption that I is of type (d) is wrong, and all transformations of
type (d) are diﬀerent from the identity I.
Finally, we assume that some transformation γ of type (c) is the identity, i.e.
γ = ϕψm1ϕψm2 · · · ϕψmnϕ = I.
Then
I = ϕγϕ = ψm1ϕψm2 · · · ϕψmn,
and we have written I as a transformation of type (d), which is not possible according to the above.
Summing up, we have proved that I cannot be written in any of the forms (a), (b), (c), (d). This
implies that they are all mutually diﬀerent. In fact, assume that σ = τ. Then στ −1 = I. If τ = I,
then also σ = I, and neither σ nor τ can be written in one of the forms (a)–(d).
Then assume that τ = I, thus also σ = τ = I. We have
(6.19)



σ = ϕkψm1ϕψm2 · · · ϕψmnϕℓ,
τ = ϕrψq1ϕψq2 · · · ϕψqpϕs,
where m1, . . . mn, q1, . . . , qp ∈{1, 2}, and where k, ℓ, r, s ∈{0, 1}. It follows from στ−1 = I that
ϕkψm1ϕψm2 · · · ϕψmnϕℓϕ−sψ−qpϕψ−qp−1 · · · ϕψ−q1ϕ−r = I.
The left hand side is equal to i, so it cannot be of any of the types (a)–(d). The only diﬀerence from
(a)–(d) is the inner composition ϕℓϕ−s, so we must have ϕℓϕ−s = I, from which ℓ= s. Then by
reduction, ψmnIψ−qp = ψmn−qp = I, etc., and we conclude by recursion that
ℓ= s,
p = n,
mn = qn, mn−1 = qn−1, . . . , m1 = q1,
k = r.
It follows from (6.19) that σ and τ have the same expansions as products of fundamental factors.
Summing up, we have proved that every element of G \ {I} has an unique expansion as a product of
fundamental factors. This proves that all elements of G = +∞
n=0 Gn are mutually diﬀerent.
We show in the next step that G can be split into three disjoint subsets
G = G(1) ∪G(2) ∪G(3),
such that

ϕG(1) = G(2) ∪G(3),

where we write
ϕG(1) :=

ϕσ | σ ∈G(1)
,
and analogously in the other cases.
The proof of (6.20) is not diﬃcult, but it is also fairly long. The idea is to split each Gn into three
disjoint subsets G(1)
n , G(2)
n , G(3)
n , which is done inductively in the following way.
First we put
G(1)
0
:= {I},
G(2)
0
:= ∅,
G(3)
0
:= ∅.
Then assume that we already have deﬁned G(1)
n , G(2)
n
and G(3)
n
for some n ∈N0. It follows from
the above that to every σ ∈Gn+1 there is an unique ̺ ∈Gn, such that one of the following three
possibilities occurs,
1) σ = ϕ̺, where the ﬁrst factor of ̺ is either ψ or ψ2,
2) σ = ψ̺, where the ﬁrst factor of ̺ is ϕ,
3) σ = ψ2̺, where the ﬁrst factor of ̺ is ϕ.
Then deﬁne G(1)
n+1, G(2)
n+1, G(3)
n+1 in the following way,
1a) If σ = ϕ̺ and ̺ ∈G(1)
n , then put σ ∈G(2)
n+1,
1b) If σ = ϕ̺ and ̺ ∈G(2)
n
∪G(3)
n , then we put σ ∈G(1)
n+1,
2a) If σ = ψ̺ and ̺ ∈G(1)
n , then we put σ ∈G(2)
n+1,
2b) If σ = ψ̺ and ̺ ∈G(2)
n , then we put σ ∈G(3)
n+1,
2c) If σ = ψ̺ and ̺ ∈G(3)
n , then we put σ ∈G(1)
n+1,
3a) If σ = ψ2̺ and ̺ ∈G(1)
n , then we put σ ∈G(3)
n+1,
3b) If σ = ψ2̺ and ̺ ∈G(2)
n , then we put σ ∈G(1)
n+1,
3c) If σ = ψ2̺ and ̺ ∈G(3)
n , then we put σ ∈G(2)
n+1.
When we prove (6.20) we shall repeatedly refer back to these eight possibilities. At this point we
only notice that because G(1)
n , G(2)
n , G(3)
n
are mutually disjoint, G(1)
n+1. G(2)
n+1, G(3)
n+1 are also mutually
disjoint, so they are all mutually disjoint.
We put

n=0
G(i)
n
for i = 1, 2, 3.
This gives us a decomposition of G = G(1) ∪G(2) ∪G(3) inbto three disjoint subsets.
We shall prove that this decomposition of G satisﬁes (6.20).

Let ̺ ∈G(1). Then ̺ ∈G(1)

ϕ̺ = ϕ ∈G(2)

ψ̺ = ϕ ∈G(2)

and
ψ2̺ = ψ2 ∈G(3)

where we have applied 1a), 2a) and 3a). The result is satisfying (6.20).
It follows from G1 =

ϕ, ψ, ψ2
and (6.21) that G(1)

n
we must
have n ≥2. Then there exists a ̺1 ∈Gn−1, such that one of th following three possibilities is fulﬁlled,
I.1) ̺ = ϕ̺1 and the ﬁrst factor of ̺1 is either ψ or ψ2,
I.2) ̺ = ψ̺1, and the ﬁrst factor of ̺1 is ϕ,
I.3) ̺ = ψ2̺1, and the ﬁrst factor of ̺1 is ϕ.
The Roman numeral I refers to ̺ ∈G(1). Later we shall let II denote that ̺ ∈G(2), and III that
̺ ∈G(3).
Let us consider each of the three possibilities successively.
I.1) We assume that ̺ = ϕ̺1 ∈G(1)

n−1, hence
ϕ̺ = ϕ2̺1 = ̺1 ∈G(2)

n−1.
Analogously, using 2a) and 3a) instead,
π̺ ∈G(2)
n+1
and
ψ2̺ ∈G(3)
n+1.
I.2) Assume that ̺ = ψ̺1 ∈G(1)
n . It follows from 1a) that ϕ̺ ∈G(2)
n+1, and from 2c) that ̺1 ∈G(3)
n−1,
hence by 3c),
ψ̺ = π2̺1 ∈G(2)
n .
Finally,
ψ2̺ = ψ3̺1 = ̺1 ∈G(3)
n−1.
I.3) Assume that ̺ = ψ2̺1 ∈G(1)
n . It follows from 3b) that ̺1 ∈G(2)
n−2, hence by 1a),
ϕ̺ ∈G(2)
n+1,
and
ψ̺ = ψ3̺1 = ̺1 ∈G(2)

ψ2̺ = ψ4̺1 = ψ̺1 ∈G(3)

Summing up, we get for ̺ ∈G(1) that

which implies that
(6.22)
ϕG(1) ⊆G(2) ∪G(3),

We go successively through the three possibilities.
II.1) If ̺ = ϕ̺1 ∈G(2)
n , then it follows from 1a) that ̺1 ∈G(1)
n−1, hence
ϕ̺ = ̺1 ∈G(1)
n−1,
by 1a),
ψ̺ ∈G(3)
n+1,
by 2b),
ψ2̺ ∈G(1)
n+1,
by 3b).
II.2) If ̺ = ψ̺1 ∈G(2)
n , then ̺1 ∈G(1)
n−1 by 2a), and
ϕ̺ ∈G(1)
n+1,
by 1b),
ψ̺ = ψ2̺1 ∈G(3)
n ,
by 3a),
ψ2̺ = ̺1 ∈G(1)
n−1,
by 2a).
II.3) If ̺ = ψ2̺1 ∈G(2)
n , then ̺1 ∈G(3)
n−1 by 3c), and
ϕ̺ ∈G(1)
n+1,
by 1b),
ψ̺ = ̺1 ∈G(3)
n−1,
by 3b)
ψ2̺ = ψ̺1 ∈G(1)
n ,
by 2c).
Summing up, it follows in case II that
(6.23)
ϕG(2) ⊆G(1),
ψG(2) ⊆G(3),
ψ2G(2) ⊆G(1).
In particular,
(6.24)
G(2) = ψ3G(2) ⊆ψG1
and
G(2) ⊆ϕG(1).
Finally, if ̺ ∈G(3), then ̺ ∈G(3)
n
for some n ∈N. There exists a ̺1 ∈Gn−1, such that one of the
following three possibilities occurs,
III.1) ̺ = ϕ̺1, where the ﬁrst factor of ̺1 is either ψ or ψ2,
III.2) ̺ = ψ̺1, where the ﬁrst factor of ̺1 is ϕ,
III.3) ̺ = ψ2̺1, where the ﬁrst factor of ̺1 is ϕ.
III.1) If ̺ = ϕ̺1, then it follows from 1b) and 1a) that ̺ ∈G(1)
n
∪G(3)
n , contradicting that ̺ ∈G(3).
Hence, this case never occurs.
III.2) If ̺ = ψ̺1 ∈G(3)
n , then it follows from 2b) that ̺1 ∈G(2)
n−1, so
ϕ̺ ∈G(1)
n+1,
by 1b),
and
ψ̺ = ψ2̺1 ∈G(1)
n
by 3b).

III.3) If ̺ = ψ2̺1 ∈G(3)
n , then it follows from 3a) that ̺1 ∈G(1)
n−1, so
ϕ̺ ∈G(1)
n+1,
by 1b),
and
ψ̺ = ψ3̺1 = ̺1 ∈G(1)
n−1
by 3a).
Summing up, we get in case III that
(6.25)
ϕG(3) ⊆G(1)
and
ψG(3) ⊆G(1),
hence
(6.26)
G(3) = ψ3G(3) ⊆ψ2G(1)
and
G(3) = ϕ2G(3) ⊆ϕG(1).
When we combine (6.22), (6.24) and (6.26), we get
ϕG(1) ⊆G(2) ∪G(3) ⊂ϕG(1) ∪ϕG(1) = ϕG(1),
and
ψG(1) ⊆G(2) ⊆ψG(1),
ψ2G(1) ⊆G(3) ⊆ψ2G(1),
so we have equality everywhere, and we have proved (6.20), i.e.
ϕG(1) = G(2) ∪G(3),
ψG(1) = G(2),
ψ2G(1) = G(3).
Recall the following theorem from elementary Geometry.
Theorem 6.3 If a body is transformed isometrically in R3, such that one of its points is a ﬁxpoint,
then this transformation is equivalent to a rotation with respect to an axis going through this ﬁxpoint.
Theorem 6.3 implies that to every transformation from G \ {I} we can ﬁnd a rotational axis and a
rotation with respect to this axis. The rotational axis cuts the given sphere in two points, which
are called the poles corresponding to this transformation. The set of all transformations from G is
countable, so the set D of all poles is also countable.
Consider a rotation, the angle of which is not a multiple of 2π. Then the corresponding two poles are
the only ﬁxpoints of this rotation. Hence, no point from S \ D is a ﬁxpoint for any transformation
from G \ {I}.
We shall in the following prove that
(6.27)
if σ, σ′ ∈G and σ = σ′, then σ(p) = σ′(p) for all p ∈S \ DE.
In fact, assume that σ(p) = σ′(p). Then σ′σ−1(p) = p. Since p = D is not a pole, we conclude that
σ′σ−1 = I, from which we get that σ′ = σ, and (6.27) follows by contraposition.
Let p ∈S \ D be a point on the unit sphere, which is not a pole. We deﬁne
G(p) := {σ(p) ∈S | σ ∈G}.
It follows from the above that all points of G(p) are mutually diﬀerent.

Assume that p, p′ ∈S \ D and p = p′. We shall prove that
(6.28)
either G(p) = G(p′)
or
G(p) ∩G(p′) = ∅.
In the proof we assume that G(p) ∩G(p′) = ∅. This means that we can ﬁnd two elements σ0, σ′
0 ∈G,
such that σ0(p) = σ′
0(p′). If σ ∈G, then
σ(p) = σσ−1
0 σ0(p) = σσ−1
0 σ′
0(p′).
If we put σ′ := σσ−1
0 σ′
0, then σ′ ∈G, and σ(p) = σ′(p′). This shows that σ(p) ∈G(p′) for all σ ∈G,
and we have proved that G(p) ⊆G(p′).
Due to the symmetry we also get G(p′) ⊆G(p), so G(p) = G(p′), and (6.28) is proved.
We have come to the crucial point of the proof. We introduce an equivalence relation ∼on the set
S \ D by
p ∼p′
for p, p′ ∈S \ D,
if and only if
G(p) = G(p′).
Then the set S \ D is split up into (countably many) disjoint equivalence classes.
It is at this step that we apply the axiom of choice, cf. Section 6.3. We choose one element from each
equivalence class and let M denote the set of all these choices. Notice that this is the only place,
where we apply the axiom of choice. Notice also that
S \ D =

σ∈G
σ(M).

It is easy to see that σ(M) ∩σ′(M) = ∅, if σ = σ′. In fact, assume that σ(M) ∩σ′(M) = ∅. Then
there are elements p, p′ ∈M, such that G(p) = G(p′), and it follows from the deﬁnition above of the
set M that p = p′, so σ(p) = σ′(p). Since p ∈S \ D is not a pole, (6.27) implies that σ = σ′.
Finally, we deﬁne
(6.29)
A :=

σ∈G(1)
σ(M),
B :=

σ∈G(2)
σ(M),
C :=

σ∈G(3)
σ(M).
We proved previously that G = G(1) ∪G(2) ∪G(3) is a decomposition of G into three disjoint classes,
hence
(6.30)
S \ D = A ∪B ∪C
is a decomposition of S \ D into three disjoint sets.
It follows from (6.29) and (6.30) that
(6.31)
ϕ(A) = B ∪C,
ψ(A) = B,
ψ2(A) = C,
hence by Deﬁnition 6.2 that
(6.32)
A ∼= B ∼= C ∼= B ∪C.
Finally, ϕ(D) = ψ(D) = D, because D is the set of all poles, and Hausdorﬀ’s paradox is proved. □
Notice that we only used rotations in the proof of Hausdorﬀ’s paradox.
Let S = A ∪B ∪C ∪D be the decomposition as deﬁned above in the proof of Hausdorﬀ’s paradox.
Then it follows from (6.32) that we can ﬁnd decompositions
A = A1 ∪A2,
A1 ∩A2 = ∅,
A1 ∼= A2 ∼= A,
B = B1 ∪B2,
B1 ∩B2 = ∅,
B1 ∼= B2 ∼= B,
C = C1 ∪C2,
C1 ∩C2 = ∅,
C1 ∼= C2 ∼= C.
From (6.31) we get ϕ(A) = B ∪C, so it follows from ϕ2 = I that
A = ϕ(B) ∪ϕ(C),
and we can deﬁne A1 := ϕ(B) and A2 = ϕ(C), and similarly in the other cases. We therefore have
the following disjoint decomposition
S = A1 ∪A2 ∪B1 ∪B2 ∪C1 ∪C2 ∪D.
Deﬁne
S1 := A1 ∪B1 ∪C1 ∪D1
and
S2 := A2 ∪B2 ∪C2.
Then
S1 =
4 S
and
S2 =
3 S \ D.

In fact, A1 ∼= A and B1 ∼= B and C1 ∼= C and D = D, so we get S1 =
4 S by Deﬁnition 6.3. Similarly
we prove that S2 =
3 S \ D.
Summing up, we have proved that S can be divided into seven disjoint sets, which by isometric
transformations (translations and rotations) can be put together to form the entire unit sphere S1
and at the same time also another unit sphere with the exception of a nullset. We shall now improve
this construction by using the following
Theorem 6.4 If D is a ﬁnite or countable subset of the unit spere S, then S \ D =
2 S.
Proof. Let the unit sphere S be given by the equation x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. The set D is assumed to
be at most countable, hence there exist straight lines through the centre of the sphere, which do not
contain points from D. We may without loss of generality assume that no point from D lies on the
Z-axis.
For every p ∈D we let α(p) ∈[0, 2π[ denote the angle between the projection of the vector deﬁned
by p onto the XY -plane and the positive X-axis. Since no point from D lies on the Z-axis, the angle
α(p) is uniquely deﬁned for every p ∈D.
Let β be a given angle, and denote by D(β) the set, which is obtained, when D is rotated the angle
β with respect to the Z-axis. We claim that we can choose the angle β, such that the sets
(6.33)
D(nβ)
for n ∈N0,
are mutually disjoint.
Let k, ℓ∈N0, where k < ℓ, and assume that there exists a q ∈S, such that q ∈D(kβ) ∩D(ℓβ).
Then there exist points p1, p2 ∈D, such that
α(q) = α(p1) + kβ −2k1π,
and
α(q) = α(p2) + ℓβ −2ℓ1π,
where k1, ℓ1 ∈Z. It follows from k < ℓthat
(6.34)
β = α(p1) −α(p1) + 2 (ℓ1 −k1) π
ℓ−k
.
The set
(6.35)
 α(p1) −α (p2) + 2sπ
n
 p1, p2 ∈D, s ∈Z, n ∈N

is countable. Hence, there exists a β ∈]0, 2π[, which does not belong to the set (6.35), i.e. it is not
of the form given by (6.34). For any such β the system (6.33) consists of sets, which are mutually
disjoint.
We deﬁne
Ω:=
+∞

n=0
D(nβ)
and
R := S \ Ω.
Then clearly Ω(β) = Ω\ D, so Ω\ D ∼= Ω.

Finally, it follows from
S = Ω∪R,
Ω∩R = ∅,
S \ D = (Ω\ D) ∪R,
(Ω\ D) ∩R = ∅,
that S \ D =
2 S. □
Recall that we just before Theorem 6.4 decomposed the unit sphere S into seven disjoint subsets
S = A1 ∪A2 ∪B1 ∪B2 ∪C1 ∪C2 ∪D,
where D is a nullset, and where
S4 =
4 A1 ∪B1 ∪C1 ∪D
and
S2 \ D =
3 A2 ∪B2 ∪C2.
It follows from Theorem 6.4 that S2 \
=
2 S, hence, we can – using Theorem 6.2 – write as a disjoint
union,
A2 ∪B2 ∪C2 = A21 ∪A22 ∪B21 ∪B22 ∪C21 ∪C22 =
6 S2.
Therefore, we have the disjoint union
S = A1 ∪A21 ∪A22 ∪B21 ∪B22 ∪C21 ∪C22 ∪D,
where
S1 = A1 ∪B1 ∪C1 ∪D =
4 S,
and
S2 = A21 ∪A22 ∪B21 ∪B22 ∪C21 ∪C22 =
6 S.
We see that the unit sphere S can be decomposed into precisely ten disjoint sets, where four of these
can be put together by isometric transformations to form an entire unit sphere, while the remaining
six subsets by other isometric transformations can be joined to form another entire unit sphere.
The area has clearly been doubled by this process, where we only use isometries, so we conclude that
some of the ten subsets must be nonmeasurable.
It is left to the reader to prove that when n ≥2 we can decompose S into 10 + 36(n −2) disjoint
subsets, which afterwards by isometries can be put together to form n copies of the unit sphere.
6.5
Banach-Tarski’s paradox
We shall apply Hausdorﬀ’s paradox, cf. Section 6.4, to derive
Banach-Tarski’s paradox. If E1 and E2 are two bounded sets in R3, both with interior points, i.e.
E◦
1 = ∅and E◦
2 = ∅, then E1
f= E2.
In other words, if we assume the axiom of choice, then e.g. a lump of gold can theoretically be split into
ﬁnitely many disjoint pieces, which then can be put together in a diﬀerent way to form another lump
of gold of the double size. Such a procedure would of course be devastating for the world’s economy,

and the worth of gold would fall to nothing, so luckily no one has yet constructed a non-measurable
set.
The theorem was ﬁrst proved by Banach & Tarski [5] in 1924. The proof given here is simpler. We
shall more or less follow Sierpinski [50], and we shall use the notation already given in Section 6.4.
We shall split the proof into a series of simpler results. The ﬁrst one is the following theorem.
Theorem 6.5 Given three sets, A, B and E in R3, where A ⊇E ⊃B and A =n B, then A
=
n+1 E.
Proof. By assumption, A =n B, so there exists 2n sets, A1, . . . , An and B1, . . . , Bn, such that
1) A = A1 ∪. . . ∪An and B = B1 ∪· · · ∪Bn.
2) Ak ∩Aℓ= ∅and Bk ∩Bℓ= ∅for 1 ≤k < ℓ≤n.
3) Ak ∼= Bk for all k = 1, 2 . . . , n.

Using 3) we get that for every k = 1, 2, . . . , n there exists an isometry ϕk : Ak →Bk, i.e.
(6.36)
Bk = ϕ(Ak) ,
for k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Deﬁne
(6.37)
ϕ(x) := ϕk(x),
if x ∈Ak and k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Then ϕ : A →B is bijective, and ϕ realises the equivalence A
=n B.
Using that A ⊇E ⊇B we get ϕ(a) = B ⊆A, and in particular ϕk(A) ⊆A for all k ∈N, where we
deﬁne ϕk := ϕ ◦· · · ◦ϕ (with k “factors”). Then also
ϕk(A \ E) ⊆E
for all k ∈N.
If we deﬁne
(6.38)
A′ :=

k=0
ϕk(A \ E),
then A′ \ A, so we deﬁne
(6.39)
A := A \ A′,
and
(6.40)
E′ := ϕ(A′).
It follows from A′ ⊆A and (6.39) that
(6.41)
A = A′ ∪A′′
and
A′ ∩A′′ = ∅.
Then, using (6.40) and A′ ⊆A and ϕ(a) = B ⊆E,
(6.42)
E′ = ϕ(A′) ⊆ϕ(A) = B ⊆E.
It follows from (6.38) that
ϕ(A′) =

so we get from (6.38), (6.40) and (6.42), that
(6.43)
A′ = (A \ E) ∪ϕ(A′) = (A \ E) ∪E′ = A \ (E \ E′).
Then it follows from E ⊆A and (6.39) that
E \ E′ = A \ A′ = A′′,
hence
(6.44)
E = E′ ∪A′′
and
E′ ∩A′′ = ∅.

We conclude from (6.41) that A = (A′ ∩A) ∪A′′, so it follows from 1) and 2) that we have a
decomposition of A into n + 1 sets given by
(6.45)
A = (A′ ∩A1) ∪(A′ ∩A2) ∪· · · ∪(A′ ∩An) ∪A′′.
The function ϕ is injective on A, hence by (6.41), (6.40) and (6.36),
(6.46)
ϕ (A′ ∩Ak) = ϕ(A′) ∩ϕ (Ak) = E′ ∩Bk
for k = 1, . . . , n.
We infer, cf. (6.37), that ϕ(A′ ∩Ak) = ϕk(A′ ∩Ak), and since ϕk : Ak →Bk is an isometry, we also
have ϕ(A′ ∩Ak) = A′ ∩Ak, and it follows from (6.46) that
(6.47)
A′ ∩Ak ∼= E′ ∩Bk
for all k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The sets {E′ ∩Bk | k = 1, . . . , n} are disjoint, cf. 2).
Then (6.42) and E ⊆B imply that E′ ⊆B, so E′ = E′ ∩B, and if follows from 1) and (6.44) that
E \ (E′ ∩{B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bn}) = E \ (E′ ∩B) = E \ E′ = A′′,
or, put in another way,
(6.48)
E = (E′ ∩B1) ∪(E′ ∩B2) ∪· · · ∪(E′ ∩Bn) ∪A′′.
The subsets of this decomposition are mutually disjoint, cf. 2) and (6.44).
Finally, collecting (6.45), (6.47) and (6.48) it follows that A
=
n+1 E, and the theorem is proved. □
An immediate consequence of Theorem 6.5 is
Corollary 6.2 If A ⊇E ⊇B and A
f= B, then A
f= E.
To end the proof of Banach-Tarski’s paradox we ﬁnally prove
Lemma 6.1 Assume that a bounded set E in R3 contains a solid ball B (⊆E). Then E
f= B.
Proof. We apply Hausdorﬀ’s paradox to get
S
f= S1
f= S2
f= S1 ∪S2,
where S and S1 and S2 are disjoint spheres, all of radius 1.
Let αS, α ∈]0, 1] denote the sphere of radius α and same centre as S, and similarly for S1 and S2.
Then
αS
f= αS1
f= αS2
f= αS1 ∪αS2,
where we can use the scaled decompositions, deﬁned already for α = 1. If B, B1 and B2 are the solid
balls inside S, S1 and S2, we get
B
f= B1
f= B2
f= B1 ∪B2.

Strictly speaking, we do not get the centres in the ﬁrst place in this construction, but they can be
added by e.g. a variant of Theorem 5.4.
Let r > 0 be the radius of B. The set E is bounded, so E ⊆s
j=1 Qj, where the Qj are e.g. disjoint
cubes of diagonal 2r. Let B1, 6s, Bs be disjoint solid balls, each of which ∼= B. Then by the result
above,
(6.49)
B
f= B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bs.
Using that E ⊆Q1 ∪· · · Qs it follows that E can be divided into s disjoint sets E1, . . . , Es, where
Ei ⊆Qi for i = 1, . . . , s.
The cube Qi, i ∈{1, 2, . . ., s}, of diagonal 2r is congruent with a part of the ball Bi (of radius r),
hence the set Ei ⊆Qi is also congruent with a subset of Bi. This means that E is
f= a subset of
B1 ∪· · · ∪Bs, Then it follows from (6.49) and Corollary 6.1 that the set E is
f= a subset H of B. If
ﬁnally follows from H ⊆B ⊆E and E
f= and Corollary 6.2 that E
f= B, and the lemma is proved. □
Proof of Banach-Taerski’s paradox. Let B1 and B2 be two solid balls, contained in E1 and
E2, resp.. By choosing the same radius in B1 and B2 we may assume that B1 ∼= B2. Then it follows
from Lemma 6.1 that E1
f= B1 and E2
f= B2, hence by Corollary 6.1, E1
f= E2. □

Introduction
In this chapter we collect some examples, which do not belong to the classiﬁcation of any of the other
chapters. It is on purpose that we have put it before Chapter 8, which must be considered to be the
most diﬃcult chapter in this book. Here we ﬁrst consider the method of induction in Section 7.2.
This section should not be taken too seriously, because in practice most applications of the method
of induction are straight forward. Then in the following Section 7.3 we play a little with series. The
theory becomes more serious in Section 7.4, in which we organise the set of irrational numbers R \ Q
as a complete set without changing the topology inherited from R. Finally, we show in Section 3.8 an
alternative way of solving the heat equation, where the method applied here is not commonly known
in the literature.
7.2
The method of induction
We shall in this section ﬁrst give an anecdote, in which a mathematician, a physicist and an engineer
are making fools of themselves by applying the method of proof by induction in a wrong way. Then
follows an example, in which the standard proof of induction is successfully demonstrated, and then
ﬁnally we demonstrate that there may even in the standard method of proof by induction be some
unexpected pitfalls.
7.2.1
An anecdote
There are lots of anecdotes describing the diﬀerence in thinking of mathematicians, physicists and
engineers. They are all more or less very silly, and yet they often hit the head of the nail, concerning
the characteristics of these three scientiﬁc tribes, where the author himself feels that he is a part of
all three of them.
A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer are sitting together discussing how to “prove” that all
odd numbers, except for 1, are primes.
First the mathematician says: “This is easy, because 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime and 7 is a prime, and
then the claim follows by induction!”
The physicist is not convinced. “No, no!”, he objects. “You must reason in the following way: 3 is
a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is a prime, 13 is a prime, and the
claim follows!”
“Well, well, well!”, says the engineer. “It is much easier to prove, because 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime,
7 is a prime, 9 is a prime, 11 is a prime, etc..”
The usual reaction is that mathematicians cannot see that this is a joke. Physicists are in general
really amused, while engineers are embarrassed.
All three proofs are wrong, including the mathematician’s application of the proof by induction. We
shall in the next section in a simple example give a standard method of the proof by inductions, and
ﬁnally in Section 7.2.3 follow this standard procedure in a case, where it cannot be applied, due to a
hidden pitfall.

7.2.2
The standard method of proof by induction
We shall only shortly recall this method, because is should be well-known to the reader. Therefore,
we only demonstrate it in the proof of the formula
(7.1)
n

j=1
j2 = 1
6 n(n + 1)(2n + 1).
Let us assume that we do not know the formula (7.1), so we ﬁrst have to derive a reasonable formula.
The argument may go as follows. Summation is analogous to integration, and as  x2 dx = 1
3 x3, we
may expect that
n

j=1
j2 = 1
3 n3 + a · n2 + b · n + c,
where a, b and c are unknown coeﬃcients. To ﬁnd these we set up the equations
n = 1,
1

j=1
j2 = 1 = 1
3 + a + b + c,
n = 2,
2

j=1
j2 = 5 = 8
3 + 4a + 2b + c,
n = 3,
3

j=1
j2 = 14 = 9 + 9a + 3b + c,
which are easily solved by Cram`er’s formulæ,
a = 1
2,
b = 1
6
and
c = 0,
so the only possibility of such a formula is
2

j=1
is equal to
1
3 n3 + 1
2 n2 + 1
6 n = 1
6 n(n + 1)(2n + 1),
which is (7.1). Since this expression is derived from the cases n = 1, 2, 3, we know that (7.1) is correct
for n = 1, 2, 3.
Assume (7.1) for some ﬁxed value n ∈N, i.e.
n

j=1
j2 = 1
6 n(n + 1)(2n + 1).
We shall prove that it is also correct, when n is replaced bu n + 1, i.e.
n+1

j=1
j2 = 1
6 (n + 1)(n + 2)(2n + 3)?

j=1
j2 + (n + 1)2 = 1
6 n(n + 1)(2n + 1) + (n + 1)2

1
6 (n + 1){n(2n + 1) + 6(n + 1)} = 1
6 (n + 1)

2n2 + 7n + 6

=
1
6 (n + 1)(n + 2)(2n + 3) = 1
6 (n + 1)({n + 1} + 1)(2{n + 1} + 1),
which is (7.1) with n replaced by n + 1. If therefore (7.1) holds for some n, it does for the ﬁrst
numbers, n = 1, 2, 3, then it also holds for the successor n + 1, and then for n + 2, etc., so it holds by
induction for all n ∈N.
The above is a standard application of the principle of induction. We assume that some formula holds
for some number n and then prove that it also holds for the following number n+ 1. Finally, we check
that it also holds in the beginning, i.e. for n = 1 (suﬃcient here), and for n = 2 (to be absolutely
sure).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

7.2.3
Wrong application of the principle of induction
We shall in this section by induction “prove” that given any bundle Ln of n mutually nonparallel
straight lines in the plane, they will all pass through the same point in the plane. This claim is
obviously wrong.
The “proof” goes as follows. The claim is trivial for n = 1, because then we only have one line. For
n = 2 the bundle L2 contains two straight lines which are not parallel. They must therefore intersect
each other at a point, and the claim is also true for n = 2.
Then assume that given any bundle Ln, consisting of n mutually nonparallel straight lines from Ln
these will all intersect each other at a point x, say. This is at least true for n = 1 and n = 2.
Consider any such bundle Ln+1 of n+ 1 mutually nonparallel straight lines. If we remove one of these
lines, we reduce the situation to a bundle Ln consisting of n lines. By assumption, they intersect each
other at a point x. Then we remove another line to get another bundle L′
n, consisting of n lines. By
assumption they must also intersect at a point y. Then the bundle Ln−1 in which we have removed
both lines above, must intersect each other at both x and y. Since the lines of Ln−1 are mutually
nonparallel, this is only possible if x = y, and the claim “follows” by induction.
This is an example of what happens, if one argues too formally and jumps to conclusions. The proof
follows the usual scheme of a proof by induction. Assuming that some claim is right for some n, we
prove that it also holds for the successor n + 1. Furthermore, we checked that the claim was true for
both n = 1 and n = 2, so it should follow by this bootstrap method. However, it does not hold for
n = 3.
Figure 7.1: A bundle L3 consisting of three mutually nonparallel straight lines in the plane and not
passing through a common point.
If we in the bundle L3 of Figure 7.1 remove ℓ1, the intersection point is x. If we instead remove ℓ2,
then the intersection point is y. There is only one line in L3 \ {ℓ1, ℓ2} = {ℓ3}, and it surely passes
through both x and y = x. We see that the induction step from n = 2 to n = 2 + 1 = 3 does not
apply.

The irrational numbers organised as a complete metric space without
changing the subspace topology inherited from R
This pathological example is mostly of interest for mathematicians. Let us ﬁrst recall some topological
notions.
Let M = ∅be a nonempty set. A metric on M is a map d : M × M →R, which fulﬁls the following
four conditions:
m1) The distance between two points x, y ∈M is always nonnegative, i.e.
d(x, y) ≥0
for all x, y ∈M.
m2) The distance between two points x, y ∈M is 0, if and only if the points are identical, x = y, i.e.
d(x, y) = 0
if and only if
x = y.
m3) The distance from x to y is the same as the distance from y to x, i.e.
d(x, y) = d(y, x)
for all x, y ∈M.
m4) The triangle inequality. The distance between two points x and y is smaller than or equal to the
distance from x to z plus the distance from z to y, i.e.
d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, y),
i.e. a detour is always longer (or at least equal to) than the straight way.
When d is a metric on M, we call (M, d) a metric space.
We deﬁne the open ball of centre x ∈M and radius r > 0 in the metric space (M, d) as the set
Bd(x, r) := {y ∈M | d(x, y) < r}.
Similarly,
Bd[x, r] := {y ∈M | d(x, y) ≤r}
denotes the closed ball of centre x ∈M and radius r > 0 in the metric d.
Assume that d1 and d2 are two metrics on M. We say that the two metric spaces (M, d1) and (M, d2)
– or just the metrics d1 and d2 – are equivalent, if the following two conditions are fulﬁlled.
e1) For every x ∈M and every r > 0 there exists an R > 0, such that
Bd1(x, R) ⊆Bd2(x, r).
e2) For every x ∈M and every r > 0 there exists an R > 0, such that
Bd2(x, R) ⊆Bd1(x, r).

In other words, every ball in the d2-metric contains a ball in the d1-metric, and vice versa.
A sequence (xn) of points from the metric space (M, d) is called convergent in the metric d, if there
exists a point x ∈M, such that for any given ε > 0 there is a constant N ∈N, such that
d (xn, x) < ε
for all n ≥N.
In other words, the elements of (xn) eventually belong to the open ball Bd(x, ε)
When (xn) is convergent in the metric d, then the point x is uniquely determined. In fact, if the
elements of (xn) eventually belong to both Bd(x, ε) and Bd(y, ε), and x = y, then we obtain a
contradiction by choosing ε < d(x, y)/2, because then Bd(x, ε) ∩Bd(y, ε) = ∅. Hence, x is uniquely
determined, when (xn) is convergent in (M, d), and we call x the limit of (xn), and we write
lim
n→+∞xn = x.
A sequence (xn) from (M, d) is called a Cauchy sequence (with respect to the metric d), if for every
ε > 0 there is an N ∈N, such that
d(xm, xn) < ε,
whenever m, n ≥N.
It is easy to prove that every convergent sequence is also a Cauchy sequence. In fact, choose N ∈N,
such that
d(xm, x) < ε
2
and
d(xn, x) < ε
2
for all m, n ≥N.
Then it follows from the triangle inequality for m, n ≥N = N(ε),
d(xm, xn) ≤d(xm, x) + d(x, xn) < ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.

On the other hand, a Cauchy sequence is not always convergent. An example is given in (Q, | · |) by
x1 = 3;
x2 = 3.1;
x3 = 3.14;
x4 = 3.141;
x5 = 3.1415;
x6 = 3.14159;
. . . ,
where we approximate π by the sequence of its decimal fractions. Since the limit π /∈Q, this sequence
is not convergent in (Q, |·|), though it is in the larger space (R, |·|), so it is clearly a Cauchy sequence.
If a metric space (M, d) has the property that every Cauchy sequence is also convergent with a limit
in M, then we call (M, d) a complete metric space.
The prototype of a complete space is the space of all real numbers, (R; | · |) in the usual metric,
d(x, y) := |x −y|. In general we deﬁne the usual metric on a subset A ⊆R by
d(x, y) := |x −y|
for x, y ∈A,
A ⊆R,
and we denote the metric space by (A, | · |).
As mentioned above, (R, | · |) is complete, but neither (Q, | · |) nor (R \ Q, | · |) are complete. In the
latter case, just consider the sequence (2−nπ) from the set of irrational numbers R\Q. It is obviously
a Cauchy sequence, which in the larger space (R, | · |) of formally the same metric converges towards
0 /∈R \ Q, and we know already that the limit is unique, when it exists.
After all these preparations the following theorem should indeed be surprising.
Theorem 7.1 There exists a metric d on the irrational numbers R \ Q, such that
1) (R \ Q, d) and (R \ Q, | · |) are equivalent metric spaces.
2) (R \ Q, d) is a complete metric space, while (R \ Q, | · |) is not.
Proof. The set of all rational numbers Q is countable. Hence, its elements can be arranged as a
sequence
Q = {rn | n ∈N} .
Let x, y ∈R \ Q be two irrational numbers. Then deﬁne

.
Then d : R \ Q × R \ Q →R is well-deﬁned.
We shall ﬁrst prove that (R \ Q, d) is a metric space, i.e. we shall prove that d given by (7.2) is a
metric. The ﬁrst three conditions, m1), m2) and m3), are trivial, so we shall only prove the triangle
inequality m4).
We ﬁrst notice that if a, b, c > 0, then
min{1, |a −b|} ≤min{1, |a −c| + |c −b|} ≤min{1, |a −c|} + min{1, |c −b|}.

Using (7.5) we ﬁnd an R = R(x, ε) > 0 corresponding to x ∈R \ Q and r = ε > 0, such that
B|·|(x, R) ⊆Bd(x, ε).
Since xn →x for n →+∞in (R \ Q, | · |), there exists an N ∈N, such that
xn ∈B|·|(x, R)

which implies (7.6)
Hence, if (xn) is a Cauchy sequence in (R \ Q, d), and xn →x ∈R \ Q in (R, | · |), then also xn →x
in the metric space (R \ Q, d).
Then assume that ii) xn →x ∈Q for n →0 + ∞in the usual metric in R, i.e. in (R, | · |). We shall
prove that (xn) is not a Cauchy sequence in the metric space (R \ Q, d). In other words, we shall
prove that there exists an ε > 0, such that for every N ∈N we can ﬁnd m, n ≧N, such that

The diﬀusion equation
In 1995 I was asked to give a practical solution of the diﬀusion equation, also called the heat equation
and Fick’s second law, depending on in which connection the equation is met. It was a big surprise
to me that although a solution formula has existed for a long time, it was very far from being of any
practical use. In fact, consider the special initial/boundary problem

for t > 0,
where C(x, t) e.g. denotes the concentration of chloride ions in an half-inﬁnite slab of concrete with
chloride ions penetrating into the concrete from the left at x = 0, and where the boundary condition
is a given function ϕ(t).
If we furthermore assume that ϕ ∈C1(R), then the unique bounded solution has been known for over
a century,

It is an easy exercise (left to the reader) to check that (7.9) indeed is a solution of (7.8).
All this was quite satisfactory, because formula (7.9) is exact. There was, however, only one drawback.
It was not in general possible to calculate the convolution integrals of (7.9). It was only possible to
calculate the solution, when ϕ(t) = 1 for t > 0 and ϕ(t) = 0 for t < 0, and in this case we must
ﬁrst apply a partial integration, because ϕ /∈C1(R). It is not continuous at t = 0. The result is the

The structure of (7.9) is as mentioned above a convolution integral, but even to date one is forced to
use very powerful computers to solve (7.9), and programs like MATHEMATICA or MAPLE are not
suﬃcient.
The original problem had to be solved, so I developed a diﬀerent approach in [37], later repeated
in [38]. Frankly speaking, I more or less stumbled over this alternative method, which I believed
had been known for a long time. Asking recently a professor in linear partial diﬀerential operators I
learned that it is apparently not known. In other words, one may still ﬁnd alternative and simpler
proofs than the usual ones known for e.g. more than a century.
In the following I shall give a proof diverging from the one given in [37], this time trying to argue why
this method is quite natural.
Let us consider the heat equation alone without initial conditions, i.e.
(7.10)
∂u
∂t = ∂2u
∂x2 .
Already Boltzmann was very well aware of that x/
√
4t played a special role in the problem of diﬀusion,
so this expression was therefore later called the Boltzmann variable. What I do not understand is why
no one earlier has got the idea to change variables to
(7.11)
z =
x
√
4t
and
τ = t.
The Boltzmann variable invites to such a procedure, and the inverse is simple
x = 2z√τ
and
t = τ.
Then by the chain rule,
∂
∂t = ∂z
∂t

∂z + ∂τ

∂τ = −

and

∂τ =

∂τ =

2√τ
∂
∂z ,
from which
∂2
∂x2 = 1
4τ
∂2
∂z2 .
By this change of variables equation (7.10) is transferred into
−z
2τ
∂
∂z + ∂
∂τ = 1

∂z2 ,
hence, by a rearrangement,
(7.12)
∂u
∂τ = z
2τ
∂u
∂z + 1
4τ
∂2u
∂z2 .
If we require that the variables are separated in some solution u, then it follows from (7.12) that the
only possible structure of u is
(7.13)
u(τ, z) := τ p Ψp(z),
p ∈R,

where p is some constant, and Ψp(z) is a corresponding unknown function. When (7.13) is inserted
into (7.12), we get
p τp−1 Ψp(z) = z
2 · τ p−1 Ψ′
p(z) + 1
4 τp−1 Ψ′′
p(z),
hence, by cancelling the common factor τ p−1, followed by a rearrangement,
(7.14)
Ψ′′
p(a) + 2z Ψ′
p(z) −4p Ψp(z) = 0.
This is an ordinary linear diﬀerential equation of second order and with polynomial coeﬃcients, so
it can be solved by insertion of a power series and then identifying the coeﬃcients. The relevant
solutions are (after some tedious computations)

a formula, which has the advantage that Kummer’s function is programmed in e.g. MAPLE, so in
practice these formulæ are easily to apply.
Using the functions (7.15) and the special solutions (7.13) it is easy to build an approximate solution
of the problem (7.8), when ϕ(t) is continuous in some bounded half-open interval ]0, T ], and where
ϕ(t) →a0 for t →0+. In fact, if we put ˜ϕ(0) = a0, and ˜ϕ(t) = ϕ(t) for t ∈]0, T], then ˜ϕ(t) is
continuous in a compact interval [0, T]. Then it follows from Weierstraß’s approximation theorem,
that for every ε > 0 there exists a polynomial Pε(t), such that
| ˜ϕ(t) −Pε(t)| < ε
for all t ∈[0, T].

x = 0, where we already know that it is < ε.

Although this result is nice, it is for the time being not the most useful one. The reason is that at
present the problem is usually a diﬀerent one, namely given a set of data, how can we approximate
this set of data by linear combinations of solutions of the type (7.17), where we tacitly have included
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the problem (7.8)?
The ﬁrst attempt in that direction was made by
Collepardi [12], [13] and [14], from 1970 and the following years. He suggested to approximate a set
of measurements by the complementary error function, i.e. by
(7.18)
c0 erfc

a
x
√
4t

= c0 Ψ0

a
x
√
4t

,
with the two unknown constants a and c0.
By using the statistical method of least squares to ﬁx the two unknown constants a and c0, he obtained
a lot of excellent results, which were not known before, so this was really a big step forward. In the
1980s, however, one discovered some examples where the Collepardi method did not apply very well.
This was why there was a need of a better model.
In line with the above, which was not known before 1970, the next approach would be to model with
(7.19)
c0 Ψ

a
x
√
4t

+ c1 t Ψ1

a
x
√
4t

with three unknowns a, c0 and c2 and then use the method of the least square approximation. Neither
of the two approximations are fully correct. In (7.18) we tacitly approximate the boundary value
˜ϕ(t) with a constant c0, and in the second case (7.19) we approximate the boundary value ˜ϕ(t) with
the aﬃne map c0 + c1t. Since the latter one includes the former one by choosing c1 = 0, we must
necessarily get a better approximation by using (7.19) instead of (7.18).
Notice that if the same set of measurements is modelled by both (7.18) and (7.19), the two constants
a and c1 are not the same in the two cases, when c1 = 0.
One should also notice that the approximation (7.18) is always decreasing in x, when t is ﬁxed,
while (7.19) in some cases for ﬁxed t is ﬁrst increasing in x to some maximum, before it decreases.
This is apparently against common sense, although it was predicted in 1995.
Recently, in 2015,
this phenomenon was actually observed in some data measured at the Swedish research station at
Tr¨asl¨ovsl¨age on the Swedish west coast. Here slaps of concrete of diﬀerent composition had been
exposed to salty water for 20 years. In the measurements they discovered that in some cases the
concentration of chloride ions reached a maximum at some distance from the surface. This can never
be modelled by the complementary error function solution alone. But it can by the more general
model of (7.19).
It is obvious that we can extend this method by including more terms of the special structure in the
approximation. Each time we add a new unknown constant, which should be found by the method of
least squares. There is no need here to go further into this theory.

stepping stone for Section 8.3, in which we consider a Gaussian measure on an inﬁnitely dimensional
separable Hilbert space, for which no diﬀerentiation theorem exists with respect to the systems of
small balls of contracting radii (and ﬁxed centre). We shall use this result in Section 8.4 to derive an
unexpected positivity principle in Hilbert space.
8.2
Surface measure and volume measure in Rn
Most people have a vague sense of that the Euclidean geometry of Rn resembles the ordinary geometry
of the usual space R3. However, it should not be a surprise that we also here may ﬁnd some unexpected
results. We shall here only deal with two closely connected results, none of which can be called obvious.
We shall in the following also vary the dimension n ∈N, so let us ﬁrst ﬁx the notation,
A point in Rn is denoted by x = (x1, . . . , xn), or similarly, and we deﬁne the Euclidean norm of x by
x :=

x2
1 + · · · + x2n.
Notice that we shall use the same notation of the norm, no matter the dimension n ∈N of the space.
The n-dimensional volume of a body L ⊂Rn is denoted by |L|n. If F is some (n −1)-dimensional
“surface” in Rn, then we denote the surface area of F by σn−1(F).
We shall prove the following theorem.
Theorem 8.1 Let 0 ≤a < b < 1 be given constants, and denote by
ωn := {x ∈Rn | x = 1, a ≤x1 ≤b} ,
and
Ωn := {x ∈Rn | x = 1, b ≤x1 ≤1}
two slices of the surfaces of the unit sphere in Rn.
To every constant c > 0 we can ﬁnd n0 = n0(a, b, c) ∈N, such that for all dimensions n ≥n0,
σn−1 (ωn) ≥c · σn−1 (Ωn) .
Remark. The result must have been known for a long time, although I have not been able to ﬁnd any
reference. I guess that it is at latest from the 1920s, though something in the spirit of the example
indicates that it is much older. The following proof is my own reconstruction, and it is probably more
or less diﬀerent from the original proof. ♦
We consider Figure 8.1 as a model of the general case. We see that Theorem 8.1 claims that the
(n −1)-dimensional surface area of the small slab ωn can be much larger than the (n −1)-dimensional
surface area of Ωn, which is lying further away from the centre of the ball, provided that the dimension
n is chosen suﬃciently large, Notice that we may choose the length of the projection b −a of the slab
onto the X1-axis much smaller than the length of the projection 1 −b of the remainder part of the
sphere bounded away from the centre.

Figure 8.1: Visualisation of Theorem 8.1 in the case of n = 3, i.e. in R3. For higher dimensions,
n > 3, it is diﬃcult to imagine, what is going on.
We shall start with some simple deﬁnitions and results.
Deﬁnition 8.1 A continuous positive real function on an interval I in R+, i.e. f : I →R, is called
logarithmic concave, if ln f is concave on I. This means that for every a, b ∈I and every 0 < λ < 1,
λ · ln f(a) + (1 −λ) ln f(b) ≤ln f(λa + (1 −λ)b).
Figure 8.2: Graph of ln f(x) for a logarithmic concave function f : I →R+.
The geometric interpretation of this deﬁnition is the following. For any points a, b ∈I, where a < b,
the straight line ℓthrough the points (a, ln f(a)) and (b, ln f(b)) lies below the curve y = ln f(x)
for x ∈]a, b[, and above the curve for x ∈I \ [a, b]. We shall in the following use this geometrical
observation.
If f ∈C2, then f is logarithmic concave, whenever
d2
dx2 ln f(x) ≤0,
for all x ∈I.
Lemma 8.1 Assume that f : [a, b] →[0, +∞[ is continuous and strictly increasing, and that f is
logarithmic concave in ]a, b. Then

Proof. Let t ∈]a, b[. Then we can write
t = b −t
b −x · x + t −x
b −x · b,
which is easily checked. By assumption, ln f is concave, so outside the interval [x, b], i.e. in ]a, x[,
ln f(t) ≤b −t
b −x ln f(x) + t −x
b −x ln f(b) = ln f(b) + b −t
b −x ln
f(x)
f(b)

,
for t ∈]a, x[.
If instead t ∈]x, b[, then the straight line through (x, ln f(x)) and (b, ln f(b)) lies below the graph
of y = ln f(t), so
ln f(t) ≥b −t
b −x ln f(x) + t −x
b −x ln f(b) = ln f(b) + b −t
b −x ln
f(x)
f(b)

,
for t ∈]x, b[.
If we introduce the shorthand
k :=

b −x
and
c := f(b)
f(x) > 1,
then these estimates can be written
f(t) ≤f(b) · e−kb · ckt,
for t ∈]a, x[,
f(t) ≥f(b) · e−kb · ckt,
for t ∈]x, b[.

It is possible to prove, e.g. by induction (left to the reader), that the Jacobian Jn corresponding to
this change of coordinates is given by
Jn = rn−1 · sinn−2 ϕ1 · sinn−3 ϕ3 · · · sin2 ϕn−3 · sin ϕn−2.
Notice in particular that the variable ϕn−1 does not occur in Jn.
It is proved in the elementary
calculus that J2 = r (polar coordinates in the plane) and J3 = r2 sin ϕ1 (spherical coordinates in the
3-dimensional space), which are in agreement with the general formula above.
We have expressed in the general spherical coordinates in Rn,
ˆΩn = {x ∈Rn | r = 1 and 0 ≤ϕ1 ≤θ} ,

and the theorem follows from (8.1) and (8.2). □
A simple consequence of Theorem 8.1 is the following
Corollary 8.1 Given constants 0 ≤a < b < 1, deﬁne the bodies
˜ωn := {x ∈Rn | x ≤1, a ≤x1 ≤b}
and
˜Ωn := {x ∈Rn | x ≤1, b ≤x1 ≤1} .
Given any constant c > 0. There exists n0 = n0(a, b, c) ∈N, such that for all n ≥n0,
|˜ωn|n ≥c ·
˜Ωn

n .
Intuitively one would guess that the measure of ˜Ωn would be the larger, when b −a ≪1 −b. Never-
theless, the geometric position of the thin slab ˜ωn closer to the centre implies that the measure of ˜ωn
for ﬁxed a and b can be bigger than c ·
˜Ωn

n for any constant c > 0, by choosing the dimensions n
suﬃciently large.
Proof of Corollary 8.1. When we consider a shell in Rn, given by x = r, where r ∈[b, 1], it
follows that we can apply the same proof as in Theorem 8.1 with the modiﬁcations, that the limits
are now given by
θr = arccos b
r
and
θr + αr = arccos a
r .

8.3
Negative diﬀerentiation results
8.3.1
The main result and some notation
It was proved in Section 3.8 that it is possible to construct a metric space (M, d) with two diﬀerent
probability measures, which nevertheless agree on every ball in (M, d). However, Hilbert spaces are
nicer, because it can be proved that a measure is uniquely determined by its values on a family of
small balls, e.g. on all balls of radius ≤1. Unfortunately, this property is not suﬃcient for also having
a diﬀerentiation theorem, or just a density theorem,, so we cannot in general conclude that if µ is a
measure on a Hilbert space, then

It is known from classical Measure Theory that (8.3) holds for all Euclidean spaces, i.e. for all ﬁnite
dimensional Hilbert spaces. But in inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces this is not always true, which
is the result of the following theorem.
Theorem 8.2 There exist a Gaussian measure γ on a separable Hilbert space H and a nonnegative
function f ∈L1(γ), such that

The idea is simple, but the technical proof itself is very complicated. We choose a sequence of Euclidean
spaces of higher and higher dimensions and supply each of them with a (ﬁnite dimensional) Gaussian
measure, where we “squeeze” the parameters in an appropriate way and then put all spaces together,
such that the wanted result follows. We shall even construct the function f ∈L1(γ), f ≥0, such that
we have the uniform estimate

lined version, also given by D. Preiss (private communication).

The proof of Theorem 8.2 is split into three parts, each described in one of the following subsections.
We ﬁrst investigate Gaussian measures in (ﬁnite dimensional) Euclidean spaces of high dimension. In
the following subsection we apply the obtained ﬁnite dimensional results to also get some technical
results in the inﬁnite dimensional case, including the speciﬁcation of the sequence (nj), which is the
crucial step. Finally, we put all things together and construct a nonnegative function f ∈ℓ2(H),
which satisﬁes the condition of Theorem 8.2.
8.3.2
Gaussian measures in Euclidean spaces of high dimension
We shall in this subsection derive some properties concerning the geometry of balls in Euclidean spaces
of high dimension. The ﬁrst results were already given in Section 8.2, where we focussed on the simple
part of the proof, which can be read independently. We might of course just refer to Section 8.2, but
in order not to interrupt the context we here repeat the construction in a slightly diﬀerent way and
with a slightly diﬀerent notation.
We say that a function f : [a, b] →R+ is logarithmic concave, if ln f : [a, b] →R is concave.

We write for short
λ =

b −x
and
c = f(b)
f(x) > 1,
where the latter inequality follows from the assumption f(x) < f(b) in 1).
The estimates above are then rewritten as
f(t) ≤f(b) · c−λb · cλt
for t ∈]a, x[,
and
f(t) ≥f(b) · c−λb · cλt
for t ∈]x, b[.
Then integrate the ﬁrst inequality over the interval ]a, x[ to get
c

where we have used the deﬁnition of λ, so

Similarly, by integrating the second inequality above over the interval ]x, b[, we get

We shall use Lemma 8.2 to prove the following result on surface areas in Euclidean spaces of high
dimension. This result was also proved in Section 8.2 with a slightly diﬀerent notation.
We shall here include Figure 8.1 from Section 8.2 (in three dimensions) as Figure 8.3, so the reader
can get an idea of the content of Lemma 8.3 below.
We ﬁrst need some new notation. Let Hn denote the n-dimensional Hausdorﬀmeasure, and let Sn−1
denote the unit sphere in Rn, i.e.
Sn−1 := {x ∈Rn | xn = 1} .
Let θ ∈[0, π] be some constant. Then we deﬁne
Sn−1
θ
:=

x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Sn−1 | xn ≥cos θ

,
i.e. Sn−1
θ
is the subset of the unit sphere Sn−1, which lies “above” the hyperplane deﬁned by xn = cos θ.

Clearly, Lemma 8.3 contains Theorem 8.1.
Notice that the relation between the Hn−1 measures of the subsets of the unit sphere does not depend
on the radius r of the sphere (= 1 for the unit sphere). Since we shall consider spheres of general
radius r > 0, we here rewrite the statement of Lemma 8.3 in a more elaborate way, using the previous
introduced notation,

The results above were purely geometrical. We shall in the following extend these to some estimates,
which also involve Gaussian measures νn on Rn. First we recall that we have in spherical coordinates

We shall not use this exact value in the following.
We shall, however, use the simple fact that the function fn(r) := rn−1 exp

, r > 0, is logarith-
mic concave, and that fn(r) is increasing in ]0, √n −1[, attaining it global maximum at r = √n −1,

Lemma 8.4 Let b, c > 1 and ε ∈]0, 1[ be given constants. There exists an n0 ∈N, such that whenever
n ≥n0 and x ∈Rn and r, R > 0 satisfy the conditions
x2
n ≤bn,
and
r2 ≤(1 −ε)n + x2
n,
and
R2 ≥r2 + εn,
then
νn (Kn[x, R]) ≥c · νn (Kn[x, r]) .
The proof of this technical lemma is fairly long and complicated. Notice that we always can choose
R as small as possible, i.e. in the proof we may always assume that R2 = r2 + εn.

is nonempty, if and only if
(λ −r)+ ≤v ≤λ + r,
where for c ∈R a real number, c+ := max{c, 0}, cf. Figure 8.5.
We introduce for brevity an auxiliary parameter τ ≥0 by
τ 2 :=

r2 −λ2 + εn

+
.
Then notice that by assumption,
r2 ≤(1 −ε)n + x2

so

hence τ 2 ≤

We split the proof into two cases, a) and b).
a) We ﬁrst assume that
max

τ, (λ −r)+
≤v ≤λ + r.
It follows from Figure 8.5 that λ > 0 (this was an assumption) and
(8.10)
{y ∈Rn | x −yn = r} ∩{y ∈Rn | yn = v} = ∅.
When we write y = (y1, y2) ∈Rn−1 × R, we see that the set given in (8.10) is determined by the
equations
y12
n−1 + (y2 −λ)2 = r2
and
y12
n−1 + y2
2 = v2.
When we eliminate y12
n−1 from these two equations we get
−(y2 −λ)2 + r2 = −y2
2 + v2,
thus
2λy2 −λ2 + r2 = v2,
from which
y2 = v2 −r2 + λ2
2λ
.
We introduce the angle ϕ between the point y ∈Rn and the positive part of the n-th coordinate axis,
i.e.
cos ϕ = v2 −r2 + λ2
2λv
.
Then we get
(8.11)
Kn[x, r] ∩{y ∈Rn | yn = v} = {y ∈Rn | yn = v, y2 ≥yn cos ϕ} .
We shall ﬁnd the lower bound of cos ϕ. We ﬁrst see that by the assumption of the lemma,

By the assumption a) above we have v2 ≥τ 2.
If τ = 0, then it follows from the deﬁnition of τ that
r2 + εn
2 ≤λ2,
so
v2 −r2 + λ2 ≥−r2 + λ2 ≥εn
2 .
If instead τ > 0, then v2 ≥τ 2 = r2 −λ2 + εn
2 , hence again
v2 −r2 + λ2 ≥εn

was deﬁned in the beginning of the proof.
It follows in particular that
0 ≤ϕ ≤ϕ0 ≤π
2 .
Still assuming that max {τ, (λ −r)+} ≤v ≤λ + r we then consider the set
(8.12)
Kn[x, R] ∩{y ∈Rn | yn = v, y2 ≥0} .
Since ϕ < π/2, we get
Kn[x, r] ∩{y | yn = v} ⊂Kn[x, R] ∩{y | yn = v, y2 ≥0} .
Similarly, as in (8.11), we can write
(8.13)
Kn[x, R] ∩{y ∈Rn | yn = v, y2 ≥0} = {y ∈Rn | yn = v, y2 ≥yn cos(ϕ + η)} ,
where we still have to determine the angle η. Clearly, the formula for cos(ϕ+η) must be analogous to
the formula for cos ϕ. There are, however, two modiﬁcations. 1) The radius r is replaced by the larger
radius R, and 2) the restriction in (8.12) to the upper half-sphere implies that cos(ϕ + η) cannot be
negative. Therefore

νn (Kn[x, r] ∩Kn[0, τ]) ≤1
2c νn (Kn[x, R] \ Kn[0, τ]) .
Finally, using the two estimates (8.16) and (8.18), we get
νn (Kn[x, r])
=
νn (Kn[x, r] \ Kn[0, τ]) + νn (Kn[x, r] ∩Kn[0, τ])

c νn (kn[x, R] \ Kn[0, τ]) ≤1

and the lemma is proved. □
The last lemma of this section shows that most of the νn of Rn actually lies in an “ε-shell” of centre
x, provided that n is suﬃciently large, and xn is not too big. More precisely,
Lemma 8.5 Given constants ε, ∈]0, 1[ and b > 1. There exists an n0 ∈N, such that whenever
n ≥n0, and x ∈Rn is bounded by x2
n ≤bn, then we have the estimate

where everything takes place in the Euclidean space Rn.
The idea is to concatenate inﬁnitely many spaces of this type of increasing dimension n. We shall let
the sequence (n) govern the corresponding constants bn, cn and δn.
For technical reasons we shall also need a sequence (Aj) of compact subsets of the Euclidean space

construct (nj), (Aj) and (dj) by induction. The other constants follow from the deﬁnitions in (8.23).
Lemma 8.6 Given ε ∈]0, 1[. There exist a sequence (nj) of integers, a sequence (Aj) of compact

Apply Lemma 8.4 and Lemma 8.5 to ﬁnd n1 ≥3, such that if r, R > 0 and x ∈Rn1 satisfy

(if x is bounded in some sense, then some relatively thin shell of centre x contains most of the νn1

This shows that (1) and (2) hold for j = 1.

for every r ∈[0, 1] and every x ∈H1, for which B1[x, 1] ∩A1 = ∅.
This proves the ﬁrst step of the induction.
In general, we assume that nj, Aj and dj, 1 ≤j ≤k −1, have been determined, such that (1)–(4)
hold. We shall prove that we can ﬁnd nk, Ak and dk, such that (1)–(4) also hold at step number k.
It was noticed above that we can right away ﬁnd ck and δk, because they only rely on pk−1, already
found at level k −1. Applying Lemma 8.4 and Lemma 8.5, we ﬁnd as previously nk > nk−1, such
that if r, R > 0 and x ∈Rnk satisfy the conditions

r2 ≤(1 −ε)nk + x2

Recall that the Hilbert space (actually an Euclidean space) Hk is inductively given by

where x = (x1, x2) ∈Hk−1 × Rnk.
We attach inductively the measure µk := µk−1 × νnk to Hk = Hk−1 × Rnk. Then there exists a
compact set Ak ⊂Hk, such that
µk (Hk \ Ak) ≤2−k.
In particular, Ak is bounded, so there exists a constant dk > dk−1, such that
1

for r ∈]0, 1],
whenever x ∈Hk and Bk[x, 1] ∩Ak = ∅. We have proved that (3) and (4) also hold at level k, and
the lemma then follows by induction. □

z −x2

Notice that the choice of ε guarantees that the expression r2(y) −6 · 2−kε > 0 for every y ∈M k+1(x).
When we split according to these two alternatives, we get

The proof of (v) is split into two cases. If r fulﬁls the assumptions of Proposition 8.1, then either
(a) 2−(k−1)(1 + 2ε) + |x|2
σ,k ≤r2 ≤2−(k+1) + 2−(k−1)(1 + 2ε) + |x|2

(b) 2−(k+2) + 2−k(1 + 2ε) + |x|2
σ,k ≤r2 ≤2−(k−1)(1 + 2ε) + x2

Case (a). We conclude from (8.31) that if y ∈Knk [0, ̺k] × Hk+1(x), then
r2 −|y −x|2

This inequality holds, whenever the assumptions of Lemma 8.7 are fulﬁlled. In the present case a

(i) If Bk[x, r] ∩Ak = ∅for some k ≥m, then obviously

Once Theorem 8.2 has been proved, it is not hard to obtain other strange examples. We here include
a result which shows that the density theorem also fails, cf. Corollary 8.3 in the following, because its
proof is so simple. Another and more diﬃcult consequence is postponed to the next section.
Corollary 8.3 Let H be a separable Hilbert space. There exist a ﬁnite measure τ on H and a Borel
set A ⊂H, such that τ(A) > 0, and

Positivity principles in Hilbert spaces
We shall in this section give some unexpected consequences of Theorem 8.2. The material is based on
Mejlbro, Preiss & Tiˇser [39].
We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of the positivity principle.
The Positivity Principle. Let (X, B) be a measurable space. We say that a subfamily (also called
a paving) P ⊂B satisﬁes the positivity principle, if we can conclude for every signed measure µ on
(X, B), for which µ(C) ≥0 for every C ∈P, that also µ ≥0.
It is classically known that the Positivity Principle is equivalent to the following computation formula,
(8.36)
µ(A) = inf

.
This explains, why we are interested in the Positivity Principle.
We shall in most of this section consider separable Hilbert spaces, and only at the very end of this
section also take a look at more general Banach spaces, Furthermore we shall be concerned with only
two types of pavings, either a paving consisting of “small balls”, i.e. all balls in the Hilbert space of
diameter ≤1, say, or the paving of all “large balls”,, i.e. all balls of diameter ≥1, say. The bound 1
can obviously be replaced by any other positive constant c > 0.
We proved in Theorem 8.2 that it was possible to ﬁnd a Gaussian measure γ on H, and a nonnegative
function f ∈L2(γ), such that
lim
r→0+

γ(B[x, r])

Theorem 8.3 Given a constant c > 0, and let H be an inﬁnite dimensional separable Hilbert space.
Then we can ﬁnd two probability measures γ and ν on H, such that
ν(B) ≥c · γ(B)
for every “small ball” B in H, i.e. for every ball B in H of diameter ≤1, say.
Proof. Let ˜H be the separable Hilbert space of Theorem 8.2, and let γ and f ∈L1(γ), where f ≥0,
be chosen, such that (8.37) holds. Then γ is in particular a probability measure. In particular, we
can ﬁnd a positive constant α > 0, such that
(8.38)

α f(y) dγ(y) = 1.
Deﬁne ν as the measure, which har αf as its Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to γ. This means
that
ν(A) =

A
αf(y) dγ(y).
It follows from (8.38) that ν is a probability measure on ˜H. Furthermore, (8.37) implies that
ν(B)
γ(B) ≥c
for every ball of diameter ≤ε!

. Hence,
(8.39)
ν(B) ≥c · γ(B).
Finally, let H be the Hilbert space consisting of the same points as ˜H, and with the rescaled inner
product,
x, yH :=

for x, y ∈H.
Then (8.39) holds for every ball in H of diameter ≤3, and Theorem 8.3 is proved. 
Remark. It is well-known that all inﬁnite dimensional and separable Hilbert spaces are equivalent.
Therefore, Theorem 8.3 can be restated in the following way: Whenever H is an inﬁnite dimensional,
separable Hilbert space, there exist probability measures γ and ν on H, such that (8.39) holds. ♦
The classical result is
Theorem 8.4 The positivity principle holds for the paving of “all small balls” in a separable Hilbert
space H, if and only if H is ﬁnite dimensional.
Before we prove Theorem 8.4 we give the following
Remark. Theorem 8.4 may be reformulated in the following way. Assume that the signed measure
µ on a separable Hilbert space is nonnegative on the paving of all “small balls”. Then µ itself is

MEASURES IN Rn AND IN INFINITE 
DIMENSIONAL HILBERT SPACE
nonnegative, µ ≥0, if and only if the Hilbert space H is ﬁnite dimensional, i.e. H is an Euclidean
space. When this is the case, we can calculate the µ measure µ(A) of any measurable set A in H by
formula (8.36). We notice, that this is not possible, if H is inﬁnite dimensional, and µ is only known
on all “small balls”. ♦
Proof of Theorem 8.4. Assume that H is an Euclidean space, i.e. of ﬁnite dimension. Then the
statement follows from e.g. the Besicovitch Covering Theorem.
Concerning the “only if” part, we assume that the dimension is inﬁnite. According to the remark
following Theorem 8.3 there exist two probability measures ν and γ, such that ν(B) ≥2γ(B), whenever
B is a ball of diameter ≤1, say, i.e. when B is a “small ball”. Deﬁne µ = ν −2γ. Then µ is a measure,
which is nonnegative on all “small balls”, while clearly µ(H) = −1, so µ is a truly signed measure. 
A surprising result is the following.
Theorem 8.5 The positivity principle holds for a paving of “large balls” in a separable Hilbert space
H, if and only if H is inﬁnite dimensional.
Again we ﬁrst give a remark, before the theorem is proved.
Remark. We notice that one of the consequences of Theorem 8.5 is, that if H is inﬁnite dimensional,
and the signed measure µ is positive on all balls of diameter ≥1, then the measure µ(A) of a measurable
set A is reconstructed by means of the formula (8.36), i.e.
µ(A) = inf

Proof. “⇒”. Let H be the Euclidean n-space. Let Ln denote the Lebesgue measure in H. Let B1
be any ﬁxed unit ball, and let Bε denote the ball of same centre as B1 and of radius ε > 0. For every
ε ∈]0, 1[ we deﬁne
µ := Ln|B1 −2Ln|Bε.
Then µ is a truly signed measure.
Choosing ε > 0 suﬃciently small (depending on the dimension) we clearly obtain a truly signed
measure, which is nonnegative on every “large ball” (of radius ≥1, say).
“⇐. When we prove the inverse implication, we shall check that every signed measure, which satisﬁes
the assumption on an inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space, is in fact nonnegative.
It suﬃces to prove that every orthogonal projection Πµ onto any ﬁnite dimensional subspace V is
nonnegative. Fix any such ﬁnite dimensional subspace V .
Choose a sequence of n-dimensional subspaces Un ⊂V ⊥, such that
U1 ⊂U2 ⊂· · · ⊂Un ⊂· · · ,
and such that the union +∞
n=1 Un is dense in V ⊥. Deﬁne

Let γλ denote the Gaussian measure on V of density function

,
where cn > 0 is the normalisation constant.
Then the left hand side of (8.41 is the convolution of γλ and ν, so we infer that γλ ⋆ν ≥0. The
sequence (γλ) of Gaussian measures converges weakly towards the Dirac measure δ0 at the origin for
λ →+∞. We therefore conclude by taking this limit that
0 ≤δ0 ⋆ν = ν,
and we have proved that ν = Π is nonnegative. Since this is true for every ﬁnite dimensional subspace
V , we conclude that µ must also be nonnegative, and the theorem is proved. 
We ﬁnally mention that the situation is totally diﬀerent in general Banach spaces. We shall demon-
strate this by the following
Theorem 8.6 There exist a separable Banach space X and a truly signed measure µ on X, such that
µ is nonnegative on all balls.
Remark. This theorem means that the Positivity Principle does not hold in general for the family
of all balls in a Banach space. In particular, the µ measure of a measurable set A cannot always be
reconstructed in a Banach spade by means of only the formula (8.36). ♦
Proof.
Let H be an inﬁnite dimensional, separable Hilbert space, and ν and γ two probability
measures as described in Theorem 8.3, i.e. such that for every ball B of diameter ≤1, say,
ν(B) ≥2γ(B).

If B is a “small ball”, i.e. diam(B) ≤1, or if B is a ball satisfying B ∩({0} × H) = ∅, then µ(B) ≥0,
because all the remaining terms are nonnegative.
If instead B is a “large ball”, diam(B) ≥1, for which B ∩, ({0} × H) = ∅, then a small geometrical
consideration shows that B must intersect either
