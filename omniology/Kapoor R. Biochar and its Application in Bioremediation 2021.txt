Application of Biochar for Wastewater
Treatment

A. I. Abd-Elhamid and M. Emran
Abstract
Due to the increased progress in the industrial activities, considerable quantities
of inorganic (such heavy metals Pb2+, Cd2+, As2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, As3+, Cr7+, etc.)
and organic (such as dyes, antibiotics, phenols, etc.) materials resulted as
efﬂuents. The discharge of these pollutants without proper management will
cause a serious threat on the surrounding environment. Moreover, the accumula-
tion of these contaminants in the waterway becomes a health threat as they are
toxic, recalcitrant, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Therefore, it is very necessary to
exploit new adsorbents for efﬁcient recovery of clean water. Activated biochar is
derived from biomass by-products via thermal pyrolysis followed by activation
step. The resulted biochar will own superior physical and chemical properties,
which include high porosity, large surface area, enhanced surface properties, and
excellent adsorptive performance toward the pollutants. These properties make
the activated biochar excellent adsorbent that can be applied for water
remediation.

1.1
Introduction
Biochar (BC) is an organic C-rich material, stabilized through pyrolysis of biomass
by-product in limited oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperature. Due to availabil-
ity of biochar precursor, low-cost preparation, high surface area, large porosity, and
easy modiﬁcation, biochar is widely applied in several application ﬁelds such as soil
amendment,
C-sequestration,
and
the
removal
of
organic
and
inorganic
contaminants from wastewater. The raw BCs provide low adsorption capacity of
the pollutants; thus further modiﬁcation will be required to improve different
physicochemical properties: surface area, pore structure, and surface functional
groups. In this regard, physical and chemical activation may be investigated to
enhance the removal afﬁnity of BC during environmental application. Meanwhile,
the prepared modiﬁed biochar could be considered as alternative adsorbent to
various carbonaceous materials (activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene)
with equalized removal capacity for organic and inorganic pollutants. Another major
property of preparing biochar is to get rid of the biomass waste problem which is
considered an extra environment challenge.
1.2
Preparation of Activated Biochar
The preparation of biochar passed through three various stages: biomass precursor
selection, carbonization/pyrolysis process, and activation of biochar, as illustrated in
Fig. 1.1.
1.2.1
Biomass Precursor Selection
The precursor material used for preparation of activated biochar should be low-cost,
available, diverse, renewable, and nonhazardous to the environment. These raw
materials may be derived from agricultural waste or industrial biomass waste such
as various portions of crops shell, stem ﬁbers, seed, husk and stones, woody
biomass, herbaceous, etc. The biomass type and the pyrolysis conditions used induce
the surface morphology and the physical function of produced biochar. For example,
the celluloses, hemicelluloses, and lignin biomasses presented a strict structure
similar to the plant because they are ﬁrmly interacted and non-covalent chemically
bonded. Consequently, the biochar obtained has an excellent surface area including
internal network porous structure along with high abundant functional groups which
are preferable in the adsorption process. Therefore, it is more important to choose the
biomass precursors to produce biochar with acceptable adsorption performance,
textural properties, and porosity structure, available for decontamination of waste
water.
Batista et al. (2018) observed that the biochar samples prepared from various
biomasses showed pores with different sizes, where the charcoal ﬁnes (CR) and
coconut shells (CS) owned pore size approximately 10 μm, while the oil palm bunch
2

(PO) and sugarcane bagasse (SB) samples presented 6 μm pore size. Moreover, the
water hyacinth plants (WH) sample exhibited a rough surface, probably due to
breakdown of the pores and further ﬁlling of the porous system with ash; see
Fig. 1.2a.
1.2.2
Carbonization/Pyrolysis Process
The preparation of activated biochar from the selected precursor biomass is
investigated through two main steps: initially, pyrolysis of the biomass and,
secondly, activation of biochar. In the pyrolysis stage, thermochemical reactions
execute; moisture as well as the volatile matter content is liberated from the biomass
under controlled oxygen atmosphere, heating rate, and pyrolysis time. At presence of
oxygen during the pyrolysis process, the oxygen will diffuse interior the prepared
materials and those with the biomass decomposition rate increasing, and it will be
unstoppable. For efﬁcient carbonization operation, the remoting of the pyrolysis
temperature plays a vital role in detecting the quality and applicability of the
prepared biochar. The pyrolysis of biomass at temperature range of 350–650 C
resulted in breaking and rearrangements of the chemical bonds in the selected
biomass, leading to formation of new functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, lactone,
lactol, quinine, chromene, anhydride, phenol, ether, pyrone, pyridine, pyridone, and

The biochar produced at elevated pyrolysis temperatures exhibits a highly hydro-
phobic nature with well-organized C layers; see Fig. 1.2b. This behavior attributed to
loss of water content and oxygenated groups; thus the obtained biochar will have
fewer oxygen- and hydrogen-containing functional groups. Consequently, the sur-
face groups can serve as electron donors or acceptors, which result in generation of
appropriated areas whose behavior can range from acidic to basic and from hydro-
philic to hydrophobic (Tomczyk et al. 2020).
In addition, during the pyrolysis process, the network porous structure of the
biochar will be generated. Where, the high temperature cause thermal decomposition
and releasing of the materials that are clogging the pores, leading to creation of
pores, network channel structures, or amorphous carbon structures, consequently
increasing the speciﬁc surface areas (Raﬁq et al. 2016). Moreover, Claoston et al.
(2014) observed that the further increase in the pyrolysis temperature, the porosity of
the biochar enhanced, and the biochar structure become more ordered and the pores
become more wider, as illustrated in Fig. 1.2c.
1.2.3
Activation of Biochar
Un-activated biochar suffers from poor active groups, limited pore properties, and
reduced surface area. Therefore, the raw biochar exhibits lower adsorption afﬁnity
toward various organic and inorganic water contaminants which makes it of limited
use in the water treatment applications. For instance, great efforts are carried out to
prepare a class of biochar with a well-improved porous structure, high surface area,
high density of surface functional groups, and efﬁcient physiochemical stability.
Two main activation routes, the physical and chemical activation, were employed for
enhancement of the physical and chemical behaviors.
1.2.3.1 Physical Activation
In the physical activation process, the precursor will be carbonized at high elevated
temperature (<800 C), thereafter, it will be activated using steam or CO2. The steam
modiﬁcation of the biochar aimed to enlarge the surface area, volume of pore, and
surface morphology through reducing the aromaticity, as well as the polarity. This
will be achieved due to at the reaction of the steam with carbonized biochar induce
the volatile matter and ﬁxed carbon transformation into CO and CO2 as well as
trapped particles will be eliminated. In case of CO2 activation, carbon dioxide
interacts with the carbon of the biochar and yields carbon monoxide (i.e., hot
corrosion); consequently, a microporous structure was formed.
1.2.3.2 Chemical Activation
Chemical activation is the most applied method for activation of the biochar. The
chemical activation may be carried out during (single activation process) or after
(two-step activation process) the carbonization of the selected raw biomass using a
chemical agent (acid or alkaline modiﬁer, metal salts, oxidizing agent, etc.).

and adsorption capacities of the prepared biochar and activated biochar toward
various inorganic and organic pollutants.
Acid activation is supplied for decoration of biochar surface by acid functional
groups. Usually it is carried out using acidic agent such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric
acid, nitric acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, and citric acid. An extra function for
the acid treatment is to remove the undesired metallic impurities present in the
biochar. The alkaline activation of biochar is investigated to improve the surface
area and oxygen functional groups on the obtained modiﬁed biochar. Commonly
employed alkali-modifying agents include NaOH or KOH. Impregnation of biochar
with metal oxides (MO) or metal salts MXn was expected to increase the mass yield
production as well as enhance the adsorption capacity of anionic species.
1.3
Designed Biochar for Treating Polluted Water
Recently, activated biochar has been awarded more attention and extensively studied
by scientists in various ﬁelds. This is attributed to availability of biochar precursor,
low cost, easy preparation, high reactivity, easy modiﬁcation, and getting rid of an
environment-waste challenge. Especially, in water treatment applications, the
activated biochar is heavily used because it is an economically feasible and
eco-friendly carbonaceous material and has high surface area, large porosity, excel-
lent adsorption capacity, and ion-exchange capacity. All of these features make the
biochar an efﬁcient adsorbent in waste water treatment applications.
1.3.1
Biochar for Removal of Inorganic Pollutants
With further progress of industrial activities and the employment of mines, heavy
metal contamination is becoming a challenge environmental problem. The discharge
of these elements to the raw water will cause a serious threat to the human life. These
elements are carcinogenic and it may cause renal, liver, and prostatic diseases.
Therefore, it is very necessary to investigate an efﬁcient adsorbent to eliminate
these elements from the wastewater. Modiﬁed biochar has several properties such
as high porosity, enhanced surface area, and high adsorptive performance suitable
adsorbent for these pollutants.
Zhang et al. (2021c) studied Cd(II) adsorption onto MgCl2 functionalized biochar
(MgC600), and results showed that the adsorption capacity of MgC600 was
exceeded more than twice of that of pristine biochar attributed to its preformed ion
exchange ability. Oil tea camellia shell biochar was prepared by pyrolysis (500 C)
in the introduction of sodium silicate and applied for adsorption of Cd (Cai et al.
2021). The characterization results revealed that The SEM silicon (Si) is anchored on
biochar surfaces as ﬁne particles, in the form of quartz (SiO2) as indicated from XRD
data. Cai et al. found that the addition of silicate highly increases the speciﬁc surface
area (45–112%) and slightly improves the porosity (5–12%) of biochar. Batch
results indicated that Si modiﬁcation highly enhances Cd adsorption (at pH > 5).

Furthermore, silicate functionalization allows the internal diffusion of Cd on
biochar. According to FTIR and XPS, ion exchange with Na+, surface precipitation
(CdCO3, CdSiO3, or Cd2SiO4), coordination with π electrons (C¼C), and complex-
ation with carboxyl and C–Si–O groups are explained sorption mechanisms; see
Fig. 1.3a. Magnesium-modiﬁed coconut shell biochar (MgBC400) was investigated
(Wu et al. 2021) for high adsorption performance of Pb and Cd from wastewater. As
a result of modiﬁcation, the adsorption capacity of Mg-coated biochar (MgBC400)
was found 20 (For Pb) and 30 (for Cd) times compared with the pristine biochar
(BC400). The removal mechanism (Fig. 1.3b) may be explained on bases of ion
exchange (Qe), mineral precipitation (Qp), interaction with oxygen functional groups
(OFGs) [(Qf)], and metal-π electron coordination (Qπ). Compared with the BC400,
the adsorption capacity of the four routes of MgBC400 especially enhanced the ion
exchange and precipitation. The Qe values of MgBC400 were almost 49 (Pb) and
59 (Cd) times that of BC400, and the Qp values of MgBC400 increased by 214.4 and
81.7 mg/g, respectively. Sulfonated biochar (SBC) from Axonopus compressus was

prepared via a simple one-step solvothermal route under a mild-temperature condi-
tion (Yu et al. 2021b). The generation of –OH, –COOH, and –SO3H moieties on the
surface of SBC during the sulfonation process was conﬁrmed by FTIR and XPS
analysis. Attributed to high electronegativity and strong complexation of these active
sites, SBC can adsorb Pb(II) and Cd(II) rapidly (in 5 min) with capacities of 191.07
and 85.76 mg/g, respectively. SBC can be recycled for 5 times with a negligible loss
of adsorption capacity. Effective cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) removal from
aqueous solution was achieved (Wang et al. 2021a) by using of composite
synthesized by Bacillus sp. K1 anchored onto Fe3O4 biochar (MBB). The blending
with Bacillus sp. K1 exhibited new biosorption active sites such as amine and
hydroxyl groups in the composite surface, which highly enhances the removal
activity of Cd(II) by 230% compared with the raw magnetic biochar. Moreover,
the adsorption of As(III) will act as a new active site for adsorbing Cd(II), which is
introduced on the surface of the MBB. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cd
(II) is 25.04 mg g1 and As(III) reached 4.58 mg g1 in a binary system.
A biochar derived from sewage sludge functionalized with hydroxyapatite (HAP)
was prepared as a novel and efﬁcient adsorbent (HAP-SSBC) for adsorption of Cu2+
and Cd2+ from aqueous solution (Chen et al. 2021). Adsorption experiments
indicated that HAP-SSBC presented higher adsorption performance compared to
the raw sludge-based biochar (SSBC). According to Langmuir model, the
HAP-SSBC showed maximum adsorption capacity of Cu2+ (89.98 mg/g) and Cd2+
(114.68 mg/g). Moreover, the characterization analysis of the solid after the adsorp-
tion process provided that the main mechanisms involved in the adsorption process
were ion exchange with Ca2+, interaction with –OH and –COOH, and forming Cu-π
or Cd-π binding with aromatic C¼C on HAP-SSBC surface. A hybrid adsorbent
(MO-L-BC) was fabricated (Wan et al. 2020) via dispersing manganese oxide
(MO) inside a biochar with enlarged pore structure (L-BC). The used carrier (porous
L-BC) promoted a high proportion of large pores (>2 nm) (87%) and thus allows the
target pollutants to diffuse in pore region of MO-L-BC. Consequently, Sb(III) and
Cu(II) could be adsorbed rapidly (within 15 min) onto MO-L-BC. The XPS analysis
demonstrated that 53.3% of the sorbed Sb(III) was oxidized to Sb(V) by the mixing
MO. Coexisting substances such as HCO3
, SO4
2, NO3
, Ca2+, Mg2+ and humic
acid with concentration up to 20 times higher than target contaminants (Sb(III) or Cu
(II)) resulted in <20% drop in sorption amount of MO-L-BC. The ﬁxed-bed column
adsorption experiments presented MO-L-BC success in the tertiary treatment of
either the singly contaminated (Sb(III) or Cu(II)) or the copolluted wastewater at a
high ﬂow rate of 0.27 m h1; moreover, the saturated MO-L-BC can be effectively
regenerated. Konjac starch was dispersed in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution to
fabricate various sizes of hydrophilic carbon spheres (HCSs) by hydrothermal
approach (Li et al. 2020a). Interestingly, with further increase in the temperature,
adsorption thermodynamics are more consistent with the Freundlich model. In
addition, HCSs possessed excellent selectivity for the adsorption of Pb2+ and Cu2+.
Hydrophilic biochar (HPB) is produced by an acid ammonium persulfate oxida-
tion treatment with an adsorption capacity of up to 135.4 mg g1 for Pb2+ (Li et al.
2020c). Due to the strong Fe–C–O covalent bond, nano-zerovalent iron (nZVI)
1

13

forced the binding with the carbon matrix. Moreover, the used composite is featured
by high speciﬁc surface area, porous structure, and richness with oxygenated
functional groups, which makes the obtained composite appropriate for Pb2+ diffu-
sion and adsorption. Therefore, nZVI-HPB presented maximum adsorption capacity
of 589.9 mg g1. Several interaction mechanisms for the Pb2+ removal could be
supposed such as the reduction reaction, complexation, and coprecipitation which
proceed simultaneously. Sylwan et al. (2020) studied sorption of heavy metal to
sludge-derived biochar (SDBC) via batch experiments and modeling and compared
to that of wood-derived biochar (WDBC) and activated carbon (AC). The SDBC
presented superior Pb2+ sorption capacity (maximum ~2 mg/g) compared to WDBC
(<0 mg/g) and AC ((3.5  0.4)  103 mg/g); however, at the lowest concentration
investigated (0.005 mg/L), SDBC released Pb2+. Β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD)-modiﬁed
rice husk-derived biochar (BC) was conveniently and rapidly prepared through
microwave (MW)-assisted one-pot strategy (BCMW-β-CD) and applied for simul-
taneous removal of bisphenol A (BPA) and lead (Pb) (Qu et al. 2020). Proﬁting by
microwave irradiation, the surface functionalization was proceeded in 15 min, and
the
prepared
BCMW-β-CD
introduced
an
excellent
adsorption
efﬁciency
(209.20 mg/g) for BPA and (240.13 mg/g) for Pb(II). Furthermore, the
BCMW-β-CD could simultaneously achieve efﬁcient cleanup of BPA and Pb
(II) in binary system without further competition with each other, which was referred
to the different adsorption mechanisms for Pb(II) (i.e., electrostatic attraction and
complexation) and BPA (i.e., host-guest supramolecular and π-π interactions).
Moreover, the BCMW-β-CD could be reused with mild decrease in the adsorption
efﬁciency even after ﬁve runs in the Pb(II)-BPA multicomponent system.
Raw jujube seeds (RJS) activated with sulfuric acid followed by ultrasonic
treatment to yield ultrasonic-assisted jujube seed (UAJS)-based biochar have been
studied (Gayathri et al. 2021) as a viable material for managing Zn(II)- and Pb(II)-
contaminated water. UAJS Langmuir capacity was found 221.1 mg/g for Zn(II) ions
and 119.8 mg/g for Pb(II) ions which were higher than that obtained by RJS. The
mechanism of the separation process is controlled by internal and external diffusion.
Moreover, the real electroplating industrial wastewater was also blended with UAJS
biochar to eliminate the metal ions such as copper, nickel, chromium, and zinc ions
from wastewater. The adsorbent efﬁciency maintains the maximum over ﬁve adsorp-
tion/desorption runs. Low-cost banana stalk (Musa nana Lour.) biochar (BB) was
synthesized (Deng et al. 2020) using oxygen-limited pyrolysis (at 500 C) and
employed to remove heavy metal ions (including Zn(II), Mn(II), and Cu(II)) from
aqueous solution. Adsorption experiments presented that the initial solution pH
affected the ability of the biochar to adsorb heavy metal ions in single- and multi-
metal systems. Compared to Mn(II) and Zn(II), the biochar possessed highly selec-
tive Cu(II) adsorption. The results showed that the heavy metals were chemically
adsorbed from single system with maximum adsorption capacities (mg g1) in order
Cu(II) (134.88) > Mn(II) (109.10) > Zn(II) (108.10). The results indicated that the
ion exchange was likely involved in Mn(II) and Zn(II) removal, while C–O, O–H,
and C¼O possibly were responsible for Cu(II) removal by complexing or other
reactions.

Maneechakr and Mongkollertlop (2020) studied the adsorption behaviors of
heavy metal cations such as Cd2+, Cr3+, Hg2+, and Pb2+ using active MnO2-anchored
magnetic biochar coming from palm kernel cake residue. The Fe3O4 is synthesized
via coprecipitation and simply assembled on surface of carbonized biochar powder
(CP). The adsorption efﬁciency of magnetic biochar (CP-Fe) was highly enhanced
by doping with KMnO4 (CP-Fe-Mn). According to Langmuir, all heavy metal ions
studied adsorbed over CP-Fe-Mn as a monolayer-physisorption process, with maxi-
mum adsorption capacities (qmax, mg/g) of Cd2+ (18.60), Cr3+ (19.92), Pb2+ (49.64),
and Hg2+ (13.69). At the end of the adsorption experiments, the composite simply
recovered from the solution by external magnetic ﬁeld. Sugarcane bagasse BCs
(produced at pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 700 C) were functionalized in a
one-step reaction with isothiocyanate (Macedo et al. 2021). The performance and
selectivity of original and modiﬁed BCs for elimination of Cd2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and
Cr3+ from mono- and multi-element aqueous solutions were studied. The analysis
results showed that the modiﬁcation of organosulfur will lead to increase of S and N
quantity on the surface of the BCs, particularly isothiocyanate groups, as shown in
Fig. 1.3c. The results displayed that the adsorption of metal ions by treated biochars
follows the order Pb2+ > Cr3+ > Cd2+ ﬃNi2+ and Cd2+ > Pb2+ > Ni2+ ﬃCr3+ in
case of mono- and multi-element systems, respectively. The mechanisms explained
the adsorption processes were physisorption, chemisorption, complexation, precipi-
tation, and ion exchange. Moreover, the introduction of other metal ions in the multi-
element system resulted in a synergistic effect on adsorption of Cr3+, Cd2+, and Ni2+
and an antagonistic effect on adsorption of Pb2+.
MnFe2O4-biochar composite (MFBC) was synthesized (Liu et al. 2021) through
coprecipitation route as an efﬁcient adsorbent for treating Tl(I)-contaminated waste-
water. Based on Langmuir model, the MFBC has high Tl(I) removal capacity
(170.55 mg/g). The removal mechanisms combine physical and chemical adsorp-
tion, ion exchange, surface complexation, and oxidation. Rice husk (RH) and
coconut shell (CS) biomasses were applied to fabricate honeycomb-networked
biochar (BC) precursors through slow pyrolysis (Kamran and Park 2020). Further-
more, the RHBC- and CSBC-based MnO2 composites were prepared by precipita-
tion of MnO2 in altered ratios onto RHBC and CSBC by changing the KMnO4
concentration (2%, 3%, and 4%), subsequent by simple ultrasonication and heat-
treatment routes. The comparative adsorption analysis indicated that the RHBC-Mnx
composites excite stronger Li+-adsorption ability than the CSBC-Mnx composites.
Moreover, further increasing the MnO2 deposition to 3% in both composites resulted
in maximum Li+ adsorption capacities (62.85 mg g1 and 57.8 mg g1), respec-
tively. Finally, Li+ was successfully recovered using HCl (eluting agent).
A novel anchored and combined N-doped graphene oxide hydrogel with shrimp
shell magnetic biochar (NGO3DH-MSSB) biosorbent was prepared as a preformed
material for Cr(VI) adsorption (Mahmoud et al. 2021). The obtained results showed
that the NGO3DH-MSSB composite owns high surface area (398.05 m2/g) com-
pared with that of MSSB (138.64 m2/g). Moreover, the hydrogel exhibits maximum
swelling ratio (800%) within 300 min. The binding mechanisms among Cr(VI) ions
and NGO3DH-MSSB biosorbent were explained by electrostatic adsorption

(ion-pair), pore ﬁlling, and reduction coordination reaction. According to Langmuir,
the adsorption capacity (350.42 mg/g) was obtained at pH 1.0, using initial Cr
(VI) concentration (100 mg/L) and contact time (180 min) at room temperature.
Additionally, NGO3DH-MSSB biosorbent could be efﬁciently reused after eight
cycles. Moreover, the removal percentage of Cr(VI) were recorded as 99.79% (tap
water), 99.20% (seawater), and 98.00% (wastewater). In hybridization of corn straw,
attapulgite, zeolite, starch, and iron oxide, a series of hematite-anchored biochar-clay
granular composites (HGCs) were prepared via two-step pyrolysis routes used for
efﬁcient Cr(VI) removal from an aqueous solution (Zhu et al. 2020). The characteri-
zation data of HGCs described that a mesoporous structure and the hematite were
successfully formed on the surface of HGCs. The maximum adsorption capacity of
Cr(VI) on the HGCs at pH 5.0 was 19.51 mg/g as related to the Langmuir model.
The mechanisms of Cr(VI) removal by HGCs could be explored with electrostatic
interaction, hydrogen bond attraction, redox reaction, and coprecipitation reaction.
Moreover, the strong electrostatic interaction bounded HGCs and Cr(VI) might
describe the decreased adsorption capacities of Cr(VI) along pH range 1.0–10.0. A
new and efﬁcient composite of siltstone-nanomagnetite-biochar (SNB) composite
based on Eleocharis dulcis biochar with magnetite nanoparticles and siltstone
(Ud Din et al. 2021) was prepared to remove chromium from water. Batch adsorp-
tion mode was used to evaluate the adsorption capacity of composite for the
decontamination of chromium. The adsorption capacity obtained in this study was
found to be 35.57 mg/g. It was suggested that hexavalent chromium reduced to the
trivalent chromium Cr(III) which, thereafter, interacted with functional groups of
MBS, which was conﬁrmed by FTIR and XPS analysis. A high-efﬁcient porous
biochar (PBCKOH) (Qu et al. 2021) was prepared through two-step pyrolysis of
corn straw and chemical activation of KOH and was applied for the removal of Cr
(VI) and naphthalene (NAP) from water. The KOH activation promoted the
PBCKOH with huge speciﬁc surface area of 2183.80 m2/g and many well-improved
micropores with average size of 2.75 nm and the main pore diameters distribution
range (1–2 nm). The PBCKOH possessed a suitable adsorption performance with a
theoretical monolayer uptake of 116.97 mg/g for Cr(VI) and a heterogeneous
adsorption capacity of 450.43 mg/g for NAP. Furthermore, the PBCKOH improved
the Cr(VI) adsorption mainly through the electrostatic attraction, complexation, ion
exchange, and reduction action, while it exhibits the high NAP elimination by pore
ﬁlling and π-π stacking interactions. Mao et al. (Mao et al. 2021) prepared a novel
Bi2WO6-anchored N, S co-doping corn straw biochar (Bi2WO6/NSBC) with a
simple solvothermal approach for the elimination of ciproﬂoxacin (CIP) and Cr
(VI) under visible light irradiation. The Bi2WO6/NSBC was characterized with
preformed and fast catalytic removal toward CIP (5 mg/L) (90.33%) and Cr
(VI) (10 mg/L) (99.86%), within 75 min. More importantly, this composite can
be used over a wide pH range (3.0–9.0) and with weak inﬂuence by coexisting ions
(Cl, CO3
2, SO4
2, and Ca2+). It was observed that N, S co-doping of the BC owns
ﬁbrous structures, high catalytic feature, and appropriated speciﬁc surface areas,
which aid for avoiding the agglomeration of Bi2WO6. This synergistic effect of
16

Bi2WO6 and NSBC will optimize the bandgap and improve the response toward the
visible light, consequently increasing the photocatalytic activity.
A novel nanocomposite of Sesbania bispinosa biochar (SBC) (Imran et al. 2021)
is combined with copper oxide (SBC/CuO) and manganese oxide nanoparticles
(SBC/MnO) for the efﬁcient and low-cost removal of arsenic (As) from
contaminated water at batch scale. The ﬁndings indicated that the maximum adsorp-
tion of As increases in order SBC/CuO composite (12.47 mg/g) > SBC/MnO
(7.34 mg/g) > SBC (7.33 mg/g). Moreover, the SBC/CuO exhibited excellent
reusability and stability over four adsorption/desorption times. Li et al. (Li et al.
2020a, b, c) applied the ball milling to prepare a nanocomposite of 20% hickory
biochar (600 C) and 80% expanded vermiculite (20% BC/VE). This novel com-
posite adsorbent had much higher removal of As(V) from aqueous solutions than
ball-milled biochar and expanded vermiculite, individually. Characterization of
these adsorbents showed that the enhanced As(V) adsorption was attributed to
much larger surface area and pore volume (two-to sixfold), notable variations in
crystallinity, activation of cations, and increased functional groups density in the
nanocomposite compared with the ball-milled products of their pristine counterparts.
The As(V) was adsorbed with maximum capacity (20.1 mg g1) based on Langmuir.
The adsorption efﬁciency was not affected with the presence of NO3
, Cl, SO4
2,
and humic acid. However, the adsorption capacity for As(V) was highly decreased at
addition of PO4
3. Porous biochar-supported MnFe2O4 magnetic nanocomposite
(BC-MF) was successfully prepared and employed as an efﬁcient adsorbent for
simultaneous elimination of p-arsanilic acid ( p-ASA) and As(V) from water envi-
ronment at pH range 3–7 (Wen et al. 2021). The BC-MF possess adsorption
capacities of p-ASA (105 mg/g) and As(V) (90 mg/g) at a 10μg/L equilibrium
concentration. The suggested adsorption mechanism could be explained on basis
of electrostatic interaction and surface complexation which involved the p-ASA and
As(V) immobilization; moreover, H-bonding and π-π interactions may also be
involved
on
the
p-ASA
removal.
An
active
MnO2/rice
husk
biochar
(BC) composite (MBC) was fabricated (Cuong et al. 2021) to improve As(III)
removal for groundwater remediation. The removal studies revealed that MBC
presented a high elimination capacity for As(III), which was tenfold higher than
that of BC. This enhancement can be explained based on the redox conversion of As
(III) via MnO2, leading to more effective removal of As(V) species. In addition,
under alkaline environments, the As(III, V) removal capacity of MBC was highly
lower than those under acidic and neutral conditions; this is attributed to the negative
effects of electrostatic repulsion. Importantly, a powerful transformation ability of
As(III) via MBC was observed, where only 5.9% As(III) remained in solution under
neutral conditions. Both MnO2 and the BC substrate are involved in the removal of
arsenic by MBC. MnO2 provided Mn-OH functional groups to create surface
complexes with As(V) produced by As(III) oxidation, while the reduced Mn
(II) and As(V) could precipitate on the MBC surface. Moreover, the BC substrate
also exhibited COOH and OH functional groups for As(III, V) removal through a
surface complexation mechanism with removal percent reaching up to 94.6%.

A new poly(allyltrimethylammonium) (ATMAC)-modiﬁed chitosan (CTS) and
biochar composite (PATMAC-CTS-BC) was prepared for the removal of selenate
(SeO4
2) from water (Zhang et al. 2021a). Results suggest that the PATMAC-CTS-
BC possess high capacity of SeO4
2 adsorption (98.99 mg g1) based on Langmuir
model. Also, the composite could be used over a wide initial pH range (2–10) with
high removal performance of SeO4
2. This is due to the permanent positive charges
related to quaternary ammonium groups (¼N+–). The adsorption mechanisms of
SeO4
2 were mainly based on electrostatic interactions with ¼N+– and protonated –
NH3
+ groups as presented in Fig. 1.3d and redox-complexation interactions with –
NH2, –NH–, and –OH groups. Besides, the hexavalent chromium (Cr2O7
2) was
supplied as another model to examine the capability of cationic hydrogel-BC
composite for anion removal. Activated biochar-anchored nano-zerovalent iron
(A-BC-NZVI) (Zhang et al. 2021b) was applied to remove heavy metal uranium
(U(VI)) from sewage water. The A-BC-NZVI composite was prepared by aqueous
phase reduction using biomass longan shell as carbon source under N2 at 800 C. The
batch sorption experiments indicated that the removal of U(VI) decreases in pH
range 7–10 and at pH 6.0, and the maximum U(VI) adsorption quantity referring to
Langmuir model was 331.13 mg/g. The XPS analysis indicated that A-BC-NZVI has
two effects on U(VI), involving adsorption and reduction.
1.3.2
Biochar for Removal of Organic Pollutants
Organic pollutants are efﬂuents from several industries, such as textile, plastics,
pharmaceuticals, food, paper, etc. However, the discharge of contaminants in water
resources always caused a negative inﬂuence on the surrounding environment and
can seriously threaten living organism life. As a result, great efforts have been
carried out for the preparation of a preformed material to enhance the removal of
these wastes from contaminated water.
Salehi et al. (2020) prepared biochars by treating spent-tea residue (STR) with
phosphoric acid and pyrolysis at different temperatures. Results demonstrated that
the further increase in the pyrolysis temperature could improve the porous structure
and increase the surface area, whereas it might cause loss in the surface functional
groups. The produced biochar samples were employed for the adsorption of methy-
lene blue (MB) from water. The batch adsorption process indicated that the STR
biochar prepared by pyrolysis at temperature of 400 C offered the maximum MB
removal of 99.26% and the maximum adsorption capacity was 91.13 mg/g. Silva
et al. (2021) prepared biochar-derived castor seed cake by the pyrolysis process.
Thereafter, the crude biochar (40.6% yield) was treated with concentrated sulfuric
acid
(H2SO4)
to
produce
activated
biochar
1
(AB1)
with
speciﬁc
area
(603.29 m2 g1) for removal of methylene blue dye. The adsorption results showed
that the removal percent reached to 96% of the dye and the intraparticle diffusion
controls the adsorption rate of the dye by AB1. A novel composite of chitosan-
modiﬁed biochar (CPB)-anchored MnFe2O4 (MnFe2O4@CPB) (Wang et al. 2021b)
was fabricated via simple chemical coprecipitation process which does well for
18
A. I. Abd-Elhamid and M. Emran

methyl orange (MO) removal in adsorption and photo-Fenton processes. Under the
same adsorption condition, the adsorption capacity of MnFe2O4@CPB was 1.48,
1.06, and 7.90 times of pure biochar, CPB, and MnFe2O4, respectively. This is
referring to H-bonding and π-π interactions between MO and MnFe2O4@CPB.
Moreover, MnFe2O4@CPB has ability to degrade 99.50% of MO in visible LED
light/H2O2 system under the synergetic effect of MnFe2O4 and CPB. The abundant
surface functional groups of CPB (especially amino groups and C–O) presented
active sites for H2O2; thereafter, the hydroxyl radicals (•OH) will be generated. In
addition, the redox catalytic cycles of Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Mn(III)/Mn(II) were devel-
oped under visible LED light, which qualify MnFe2O4@CPB to have great removal
efﬁciency over ﬁve recycle tests. Mesoporous nano-zerovalent manganese (nZVMn)
and Phoenix dactylifera leaves biochar (PBC) composite was synthesized for the
removal of CR from water (Iqbal et al. 2021). The nZVMn/PBC adsorbed
117.647 mg/g of CR versus 25.316 mg/g by PBC under similar condition, based
on Langmuir calculations. The addition of H2O2 to the nZVMn/PBC system will
enhance the removal of CR; this is attributed to the possible generation of hydroxyl
radical (●OH) and resulted to 95% removal of CR versus 77% by nZVMn/PBC
alone. Finally, the nZVMn/PBC presented a good reusability and efﬁcient removal
of CR up to the seventh cycle of treatment. A hierarchical porous biochar (HPB)
prepared from shrimp shell presented enhanced adsorption capacity (Qm > 300 mg/
g) and rapid adsorptive equilibrium (	10 min) toward three typical aromatic
organics 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), rhodamine B (RHB), and tetracycline hydro-
chloride (TC) (Yu et al. 2021a). Whereafter, the analysis model explored that the
adsorptive forms (mono- and multilayers) on HPB relied on whether the contaminant
is charged. Compared to the benzene-ring site of organics, the charged site shared
5.13 times to adsorption promotion in monolayer but 0.49 times in inhibition for
multilayers forms. Simultaneously, the active sites functional group contributed
relatively weak (0.023–0.342 times only). Finally, it was important to note that the
hierarchical pore structure of HPB was the key for the rapid adsorption speed, and
highly graphitic structure was vital for the high adsorption capacity.
An innovative heat pipe reactor was applied to prepare biochar from food and
garden materials residue (Hoslett et al. 2021). The biochar fabricated had an adsorp-
tion capacity about 2.98 mg/g and 8.23 mg/g for initial tetracycline concentrations of
20 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively. Wang et al. (2021c) employed the residue
derived from Chinese herbal medicine, Flueggea suffruticosa, to synthesize biochar
for antibiotics pollution management. Furthermore, the biochar was anchored by
zinc chloride (Zn-BC) and utilized as an adsorbent to eliminate tetracyclines (TCs)
from water, as presented in Fig. 1.3e. Referring to the Langmuir model, the maxi-
mum removal capacity of Zn-BC to chlortetracycline (CTC) is 200.0 mg/g, tetracy-
cline (TC) 188. 7 mg/g, and oxytetracycline (OTC) 129.9 mg/g. Hydrogen bonding
and electrostatic interaction explain the mechanism of the adsorption process. An
economical biochar-supported iron-copper bimetallic composite (BC-FeCu) was
prepared and utilized to remove tetracycline (TC) from water (Liu et al. 2020).
The experimental results showed that BC-FeCu presented higher removal (92.50%)
than FeCu (67.30%) under the same condition. Moreover, the TC removal by
1

19

BC-FeCu constantly increased within pH range 4.50–9.03. Desorption studies
displayed that the adsorption and degradation were calculated for 26.09% and
73.91% of the total TC removal by BC-FeCu, respectively. N2 sparing tests explored
that the degradation proceeded via dissolved oxygen (DO) and the direct degradation
by BC-FeCu were calculated for 17.02% and 56.89% of the total TC removal,
respectively. The O2
• was conﬁrmed to be the main active species for TC degrada-
tion by BC-FeCu. The degradation mechanism could be explained via the electron
transferred from –COOH, –OH, and Cu/Cu+ in BC-FeCu to O2 to form O2•. A
magnetic rape straw biochar (MRSB) catalyst was prepared by a high value-added
and energy-saving strategy (Huang et al. 2021). The MRSB catalyst presented high
catalytic activity and recyclability for activating persulfate (PS) to degrade tetracy-
cline hydrochloride (TC) in water. Moreover, the presence of Fe3O4 in the MRSB
greatly enhances the activation of PS. Additionally, the MRSB catalyst presented
excellent catalytic activity over a wide pH range (2.99–11.01) for activating PS to
degrade TC in water. Moreover, good catalytic activity for TC degradation was
maintained over eight recycling runs and was easily recovered by an external
magnetic ﬁeld for reuse. The electron spin resonance (ESR) data explored that the
production of the sulfate radicals (SO4
•), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and superoxide
radicals (O2
•) was greatly allowed in the MRSB/PS system. Therefore, MRSB
showed 13.24-fold higher reaction rate for activating PS than those of pure rape
straw biochar (RSB). Both radical and non-radical mechanism presented in the
MRSB/PS system, and SO4
• and singlet oxygen (1O2) displayed a determinative
role. Zhao et al. (2021) successfully fabricated and structurally characterized Fe0-,
Fe3C-, and Fe3O4-anchored biochars (BCs) for elimination of chlortetracycline
hydrochloride (CH). The experimental result presented higher removal rate and
afﬁnity revealed to Fe0@BC toward CH than Fe3C@BC and Fe3O4@BC. The
removal rate was controlled by the O–Fe content and solution pH after the reaction.
The CH adsorption takes place on the O-C groups of Fe0@BC and the O¼C and
O
Fe groups of Fe3C@BC and Fe3O4@BC. Electron paramagnetic resonance
analysis and radical quenching experiments demonstrated that HO●and 1O2/O2
●
were mainly the key for CH degradation by biochar/Fe composites. Biochar-
supported nanosized iron (nFe(0)/BC) was prepared and applied as a persulfate
(PS) activator for degradation of tetracycline (TC) (Shao et al. 2020). In the nFe
(0)/BCePS system, TC could be effectively removed in pH range 3.0–9.0. The
degradation performance of TC (100 mg/L) was 97.68% using nFe(0)/BC (0.4 g/
L) and persulfate (1 mM) at pH 5.0. Coexisting anions (HCO3 and NO3) retard the
degradation
TC.

and

experiments supposed that sulfate radicals (SO4
●) and hydroxyl radicals (HO●)
were responsible for TC degradation. Even after ﬁve reused cycles, nFe(0)/BC
could still maintain 86.38% of its original removal capacity. Two biochars derived
from date pits (DP) non-magnetic (BCDP) and magnetic (MBC-DP) were prepared
and used to remove tigecycline (TIGC) from TIGC artiﬁcially polluted water
samples (El-Azazy et al. 2021). The experimental results presented that the
MBC-DP possessed higher removal (%R) (99.91%), compared to 77.31% for
BCDP. Moreover, according to Freundlich isotherms, the maximum adsorption
20
A. I. Abd-Elhamid and M. Emran

capacity of TIGC is 57.14 mg/g using MBC-DP. Ramanayaka et al. (Ramanayaka
et al. 2020) applied macro- (BC), colloidal (CBC), and nanobiochar (NBC) for
studying the particle size to induce the adsorptive removal of oxytetracycline
(OTC) and co-occurring nutrients, which are present in simulated hydrolyzed
human urine. The highest maximum adsorption capacity for CBC is 136.7 mg/g,
BC 129.34 mg/g, and NBC 113.2 mg/g. Colloidal biochar related the highest
adsorption for NH4
+, PO4
3+, and SO4
2+ nutrients. All three types of chars presented
strong recovery with a poor desorption (6% in average) of OTC in synthetic
hydrolyzed urine medium.
The production of biochar from sugarcane bagasse using HTC followed by
NaOH treatment at inert atmosphere for removing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from
water (Prasannamedh et al. 2021). The XRD and FTIR analysis indicated that
presence of aromatized graphitic structure combined with oxygenated functional
groups is responsible for the adsorbing of SMX. The SEM images showed the
sphere-shaped structure of biochar with hydrophobic groups interior and hydrophilic
groups exterior. BET provided the active surface area equal to 1099 m2/g with high
coverage of mesopores structure. Pzpc of adsorbent is evaluated to 6.5 conﬁrming
that effective uptake of SMX based on ionization effects was induced due to reaction
medium. The adsorption of SMX on ABC surface is referred to charge-assisted
hydrogen bonding and π-π interaction with graphitized carbon, showing maximum
sorption capacity of 400 mg/g through spontaneous reaction. Zeng and Choi (2021)
study the inﬂuence of FeCl3 impregnation ratio on the functions of FeCl3-activated
bermudagrass (BG)-derived biochars (IA-BCs) for adsorption of sulfamethoxazole
(SMX). Compared with the pure BC (85.82 m2/g), IA-BCs produced by pyrolysis
with FeCl3-to-BG mass ratio between 1 and 3 (1–3 g FeCl3/g BG) caused enhance-
ment in the surface area (1014–1035 m2/g), hydrophobicity, Fe amount in IA-BCs
(3.87–7.27%), and graphitized carbon. The results indicated that IA-BCs exhibited
magnetic separation and higher adsorption (32–265 mg SMX/g BC) than the control
BC (6–14 mg SMX/g BC) at various pH. The adsorption mechanisms of SMX over
IA-BCs could be supposed by π-π EDA, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen
bond with intraparticle diffusion limitation, as illustrated in Fig. 1.3f. The IA-BC
prepared at FeCl3-to-BG mass ratio of 2 (IA-BC2.0) presented the maximum
adsorption capacity for SMX (253 mg SMX/g BC) based on Langmuir isotherm
calculations. Furthermore, the IA-BC2.0 could be regenerated by both NaOH
desorption and thermal oxidation. After three cycles of adsorption-regeneration,
64% (thermal treatment at 300 C) and 62% (desorption with 0.1 M NaOH solution).
Peng et al. (2021) investigated a simple route to fabricate cobalt phosphide/carbon
composite for PMS activation. Combining impregnation route with pyrolysis treat-
ment allows the formation of Co2P/biochar composites using baker’s yeast and Co2P
as precursors. The as-prepared products presented high catalytic activity for sulfa-
methoxazole (SMX) degradation over the pH range 3.0–9.0 by activating PMS. For
example, 100% of SMX (20 mg L1) removal was reached in 20 min with catalyst
dosage of 0.4 g L1 and PMS amount of 0.4 g L1. Near-zero Co2P leaching was
obtained during catalytic reaction, which signiﬁcantly lowered the toxic risk of
1

transition metal ion in water. Meanwhile, the reusability of catalyst could be attained
by thermal treatment.
Anthriscus sylvestris-derived activated biochar was investigated (Shirani et al.
2020) to yield raw biochar (R-BC) and activated biochar (ACT-B) for adsorption of
diclofenac (DF) and cephalexin (CPX). Batch studies showed that the maximum
adsorption capacity of ACT-B was 392.94 mg g1 for DF and 724.54 mg g1 for
CPX and the removal of DF and CPX was affected by temperature and the coexisting
ions. The kinetic data ﬁtted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model,
whereas the isotherm data showed the best correlation with Langmuir isotherm
model. Electrostatic adsorption, hydrophobic interaction, and π-π bonding were
the responsible for adsorption of both adsorbates by ACT-B. Additionally, column
studies conducted using ACT-B were investigated for the practical applicability of
ACT-B in removal of the target contaminants. Cost-effect kaolinite (KAC) clay was
synergistically mixed with blended Carica papaya or pine cone seeds and calcined
to yield composites of KAC-Carica papaya seeds (KPA) and KAC-pine cone seeds
(KPC) for removal of ivermectin in aqueous media (Olu-Owolabi et al. 2021). The
composites presented signiﬁcant property differences involving over 250% increases
in cation exchange capacity and 
50% decreases in the surface area, but KAC still
unchanged. The adsorption data showed that the adsorption rate on KAC decreased
over time, while rates for KPA and KPC increased until equilibrium at 180 min; the
introduction of biomaterials in the composites explained better ivermectin adsorp-
tion and retention under continuous agitation. Freundlich adsorption isotherm model
was better ﬁtted (
0.9887) the experimental data; this indicates complex interactions
among ivermectin and the adsorption sites of both composites. Furthermore, the
KPA possessed better reusability with 83.5 and 67.5% initial adsorption strengths
remaining in the second and third adsorption cycles, respectively, compared to the
73.8 and 58.8% for the KPC. Cell-immobilized biochar was investigated to remove
paraquat (PQ) from polluted water through immobilizing Pseudomonas putida onto
coconut ﬁber-derived biochar (BC) (Ha et al. 2021). The FTIR spectrum analysis
demonstrated that the adsorption mechanism of bacteria and BC belongs to the
interaction between cell surface proteins and the functional group on biochar. The
cell-loaded biochar using the covalent bonding and adsorption approach presented
superior PQ removal capacity (16.79 mg/g) with 30–35% increases in efﬁciency
compared with original biochar. More interestingly, after 48 h of using cell-
immobilized biochar, the PQ was converted to 4,4-bipyridyl and malic acid as
assessed by GC/MS.
An
innovated
FeOX
nanoparticle-immobilized
biomass-activated
carbon
(BAC/FeOX) composite was fabricated via one-pot calcination strategy using
FeCl3 and cherry stone powder as precursors (Li et al. 2021). The carbonization of
biomass, reduction of Fe3+, and FeOX supported on carbon substrate could be done
at the same time. Bisphenol A (BPA) was used to study the degradation efﬁciency of
BAC/FeOX activating peroxydisulfate (PDS). The results showed that the free
radical determination and quenching experiments explored that both SO4

•OH were contributed in BPA degradation. Low-cost and eco-friendly biochar

was fabricated by facile pyrolysis of sugarcane waste and employed for preformed
degradation of organic pollutants (He et al. 2021). Combining high sp2 hybrid
carbon density, large surface area, and good electron transfer ability, the
SugBC900 coupled with PMS possessed far enhanced catalytic degradation ability
toward bisphenol A (BPA). The oxidative species of 1O2 and O2
• were indicated to
be responsible for catalytic degradation, and the route of SO4
• and •OH was minor.
Even at the extremely acidic (pH of 1.0) or low-temperature (10 C) environment,
the degradation efﬁciencies maintain more than 90%. In addition, the SugBC900
was successfully applied efﬁciently to degrade BPA and other organic pollutants in
different real environmental water.

Conclusion
Recently, water resources are contaminated by an increasing number of various
pollutants, such as inorganic and organic compounds. These contaminations have a
negative impact on all the living organisms. Therefore, great efforts have been done
to put forward effective remediation agent. The biochar is a carbon-rich material
derived from organic biomass through thermal carbonization process. The physico-
chemical properties of the biochar highly depend on the type of biomass used,
thermal pyrolysis conditions, and the activation method. By optimizing the previous
parameters, a low-cost, highly porous, enhanced surface area, and efﬁcient biochar
adsorbent was obtained. The activation methods, especially chemical activation, can
make a highly difference in the surface properties and, consequently, enhanced the
adsorption performance of modiﬁed biochar.

Abstract
Increased industrial growth in the world serves a signiﬁcant role in the water
contamination with heavy metals. Heavy metals such as arsenic, copper, lead,
chromium, mercury, nickel, and cadmium impart several health hazards to
humans, plants, and animals. Moreover their accumulation potential disturbs
the food chain. Freshwater demand is higher in the world which may lead to a
severe water crisis in the upcoming years. Hence feasible water treatment
technologies must be identiﬁed and its efﬁciency must be concentrated. Heavy
metals bear the risk of biodegradation and transformation. Hence adsorption is
found to be an attractive method nowadays for sequestration of such metals. It is
an economically feasible and eco-friendly method. Biochar is advantageous over
other adsorbents such as activated carbon, graphene, silica, etc. It is the product of
a thermochemical process which possesses better adsorption capacity. It reduces
the production time and in addition provides fuel. Different pyrolysis conditions
inﬂuence the quantity and yield of char. The degree of biochar adsorption is
mainly focused on the type of biomass used, metal species concentrated, func-
tional groups, and surface area of the biochar. Regeneration of biomass is also an
important phenomenon to be considered as the adsorbed biochar may cause
secondary pollution if not disposed in a proper manner. In order to improve the
surface properties, physical structure, and regeneration capacity of biochar,
various modiﬁcation technologies have been adopted. It will also pave way for

Introduction
Water is an essential commodity for which our entire life relies on. Save water to
save the earth and to secure future generation are what the human aims and needs.
With the improvement in scientiﬁc works, our earth is attaining newfangled spheres,
but the amount that the people are giving and will give in upcoming years will be
surely too high putting the people in appalling situation. One of the upshots is
environmental pollution which hits our country both economically and ecologically.
The demand for water has increased tremendously with the production of huge
quantities of wastewater with manifold pollutants. Among the innumerable
pollutants known so far, the heavy metals have drawn a special concern considering
its carcinogenicity, and it causes serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem. Among the
variety of industries in operation, tanneries drain efﬂuent rich in chromium which in
turn reaches the human through the biomagniﬁcation processes. Therefore, a suitable
cleanup technology is needed for making our environment pollution-free. To over-
come the aforesaid lacuna and to justify a suitable technology, the literature pertinent
to the sources of contamination, environmental impact, available conventional
methods, suitable technology, and its impact on crop growth are reviewed and
presented below.
2.2
Water Contamination
“When the well’s dry, we know the worth of water.” Water is an asset to be carried
over for the future generation beneﬁts. But nowadays water has been polluted
anthropogenically in many ways. The industries play a prime role comprising metals
like cadmium, zinc, nickel, chromium, arsenic, lead, iron, etc. (Debnath et al. 2020).
These heavy metals enter into food chain and bioaccumulate in the body of humans
and animals (Salam et al. 2011). Among various inorganics, chromium is an
egregious contaminant released by the industries comprising leather tanning, pig-
ment manufacturing, metal ﬁnishing, and wood preservation.
A recent study estimated that wastewater generated from municipal and urban
centers is about 61,754 million of liters per day (MLD) out of which 62% is left
untreated due to insufﬁcient facilities and dispersed into the water and groundwater
28
E. Parameswari et al.

sources (Kamble et al. 2019). Because the treatments vary with ﬁnancial status of the
nation where 70%, 38%, and 8% of the wastewater are treated by high-income,
middle-income, and low-income countries, respectively. As a result, water availabil-
ity is much reduced, for example, per capita availability of water in India had
decreased from 5177 m3/year in 1951 to 1545 m3/year in 2011 given by the Ministry
of Water Resources (2011). Although the industries came after various pavements
for the metal contamination eradication, huge volume of discharge is carried out
annually into the environment which is the gateway for diverse impairment to the life
forms on the earth.
2.2.1
Leather Industries and Its Production
Among the different industries, the highest activity is recorded by the leather
industries where the discharge contains about 4–5% of Cr in 15% of mineral
components. Here, 70–80% of the input in the industry acts upon hides and the
remaining expelled as waste. They consume water of about 15–20 m3/ton of raw
skin. Wastewater expelled by the tanneries lies within 1500–3000 mg L1. World-
wide production of leather is around 2108.94 Mmt2. It exceeds 551,000 tons/year
affecting 1.8 million people (Raﬁque et al. 2019; Tamersit and Bouhidel 2020).
India is one of the major exporters of leather-related products which ranks ﬁfth in
the world. It contributes about 15% of the world leather production capacity (Alam
et al. 2007). In Tamil Nadu, Dindigul and Vellore are the preponderant districts in
tannery industries which release enormous volume of wastewater that affects major
parts and causes several diseases (Princy et al. 2020).
2.2.2
Chromium and Its Toxicity
Chromium (III) and Cr (VI) are the two major forms present in nature. Chromium
(III) persists in two forms as Cr (OH)3 and Cr2O3. They are less soluble, immobile,
and less toxic. In contradiction, hexavalent chromium leads to serious damages to
human beings due to its carcinogenic and mutagenic properties as it is highly mobile,
toxic, and rapidly soluble. They prevail in terms of anions such as HCrO4
,
Cr2O7
2, and CrO4
2. Hexavalent ions show comparatively 10–100 times more
toxicity than the trivalent ions (Sarkar et al. 2019; Qin et al. 2020).
According to the World Health Organization, the admissible limit of total chro-
mium in drinking water is 50μgL1 although chromium (III) was found to be an
essential nutrient. But potable water has been reported to have as high as 120μgL1
(WHO 2011). The maximum contaminant level (MCL) for chromium is
5  102 mgL1 reported by USEPA (Bej et al. 2020). In human, chromium
exposure is contributed more by the oral uptake, whereas 1.9–7% by means of
water and role of air is trivial. Once ingested, the hexavalent chromium is reduced to
trivalent and binds to the macromolecules. Hilar lymph nodes and lungs registered
higher concentrations. Those Cr (III) ions result in producing more reactive oxygen

species and reactive chromium intermediates causing apoptosis. In addition, they
cause lung cancer, nephrotoxicity, DNA damage, and intravascular hemolysis.
Ongon’g et al. (2020) found that children who consume vegetables cultivated in
Cr (VI) soils are more prone to health risks than the adults. The major route for crops
is by means of growing in the chromium-contaminated soil. The vegetable crops
uptake, translocate, and accumulate Cr (VI) in the edible parts and roots which
results in the decline of carbohydrates, sugars, amino acids, and proteins.
Stambulska et al. (2018) had speciﬁed that these hexavalent Cr ions will disturb
the pigment and cellular function. It also has impact on nodular formation affecting
their symbiosis and gets accumulated there. Other effects on plants were inhibition
of seed germination, protein modiﬁcation, and damage to DNA.
2.2.3
Treatment Methods
There are various physicochemical and biological methods for the treatment of
wastewater such as precipitation, ﬁltration, ﬂocculation, adsorption, membrane
separation, and ion exchange. The suitable treatment method is chosen based on
the factors such as treatment energy, cost, environmental effects, and inﬂuent and
efﬂuent quality. The physical methods have certain complications including high
cost of equipment, toxic sludge generation, and high space requirements and time.
Chemical methods also beneﬁcial in terms of higher pollutant removal efﬁciency but
have some disadvantages like secondary waste production, higher operational cost
etc. Other drawbacks are incomplete removal, continuous checking, and higher
energy requirement (Crini 2005; Siyal et al. 2020). Among them adsorption was
found to be an effective one compared to others as the amount of secondary waste
generated is comparatively less (Renu et al. 2017). Adsorption mostly relies on the
surface characteristics of adsorbents particularly their surface area and porous
structure (Wu et al. 2017).
The frequently used adsorbents for metal removal are silica gel, activated carbon,
biochar, and alumina (Ahmed et al. 2016). Activated carbon is found to have higher
cost in commercial purpose and poor regeneration capacity, and hence its usage is
foreshortened. Hence biochar prepared by exploiting agricultural and industrial
wastes have been widely utilized.
2.2.4
Adsorption
Adsorption has been in practical use for longer time. It is used for the purpose of
separation or puriﬁcation. Adsorption and absorption differ with the fact that
adsorption takes place on a two-dimensional matrix, whereas absorption occurs on
a three-dimensional matrix. Adsorption takes place at the interface of two phases.
Usually, it happens on a pore-ﬁlled solid matter in which the other phase liquid or
gas is attracted. There are two types of sorption based on the interaction of adsorbate
and adsorbent: physisorption and chemisorption. The physisorption is due to the
30
E. Parameswari et al.

forces such as dipole-dipole forces, London forces, and van der Waals interaction.
On the other hand, covalent bond forms between the adsorbent and adsorbate by
transferring of electrons in case of chemisorption. Physisorption has low enthalpy
and it is reversible, while the chemisorption is irreversible and has high enthalpy
(Sims et al. 2019; Ghouti and Da’ana 2020).
The main advantage of adsorption process is regeneration potential of the adsor-
bent. Isosteric heat is also considered as an important factor in this study. It is
calculated by dividing the inﬁnitesimal change of the adsorbate enthalpy by change
in the inﬁnitesimal of the adsorbed amount. The most important thing for gaining
knowledge on adsorption process is adsorption equilibria. This helps in understand-
ing how much components can ﬁt on the biosorbent (Ayawei et al. 2017). Isotherms
of adsorption give the equilibrium of the adsorbents. It depends on various properties
like pH, temperature, initial ion concentration, adsorbent, dosage, and adsorbate.
2.2.5
Biochar Production
Biochar is a ﬁnely grained porous, stable, and carbon-rich material produced by
thermal decomposition (pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation, and torrefaction) of biomass at a
temperature of about 300–700 C with limited or no supply of oxygen (Ahmed et al.
2015). Thines et al. (2017) reported that their production dates back to the past
history as native Indians produced char by burning the wood stocks piled up in the
pits which resulted in fertile soil known as terra preta. It has an excellent application
in pollutant removal as it is simple to produce, eco-friendly, economic, and efﬁcient
compared to other methods of heavy metal remediation. In addition, they possess
unique properties such as high microporosity, higher ion exchange, larger surface
area, and high adsorption capacity (Mohanty et al. 2013). Apart from adsorption they
possess multiple applications comprising soil remediation, carbon sequestration, and
bioenergy production.
Biochar production is inﬂuenced by temperature. For instance, at elevated tem-
perature it possesses high aromatic nature but due to deoxygenation possesses fewer
functional groups and lesser ion exchange capability. In case of lower temperature of
about 300–400 C, the biochar shows more functional groups (C–H and C¼C) and
contains numerous organic characters.
Such biochar are prepared nowadays from various feedstocks including rice husk,
pomelo peel, water hyacinth, Lantana camara, pinewood, sugar beet tailings,
pineapple peel, sugarcane bagasse, sewage sludge, peanut straw, wood bark, and
dairy manure at different temperature for adsorption of the speciﬁc inorganics from
efﬂuent (Nithya et al. 2020). Those nonliving biomass by producing biochar remove
the inorganic contaminants by means of passive binding over their surface. Amid
different sources, water hyacinth is a poisonous and dreadful weed found ubiqui-
tously in the water bodies globally. The weed was brought as ornamental plant in
India from Brazil. IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources) has classiﬁed it as one of the most aggressive invasive species.
Its growth is vigorous as it could increase its size twofold within 5 days. It is an

urgent need to get rid of this serious issue. It creates the way for evapotranspiration
rate increase and greenhouse gas emissions. It has high cellulosic carbon and high
biomass yield. The conversion into biochar happens by the transformation of
cellulose carbon into aromatic carbon, which is more stable.
2.2.6
Water Hyacinth as a Biosorbent
Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), belonging to Pontederiaceae family, is a
rooted aquatic macrophyte. The leaves of the weeds accumulate higher concentra-
tion of heavy metals followed by stem and roots. This pickerel weed leads to several
adverse effects because of their vigorous growing ability. They affect the biodiver-
sity of water body by reducing the dissolved oxygen concentration as they block the
pavement for sunlight penetrance. Moreover, they interfere in the activities of
ﬁshing, irrigation, and power generation and lead to navigation jam. Besides these
disadvantages, they also possess some of the properties such as improved pores,
mineral components, functional groups, and larger surface area. Hence, they are
utilized as “low-cost” adsorbents of heavy metals. Absence of natural enemies in the
newly introduced places paves way for them to grow exponentially. In a hectare of
water, 270–400 tons of Eicchornia are noticed present. Utilization of this widespread
species for wastewater treatment is very suitable as it is an eco-friendly, economic,
and efﬁcient technology. This abundant weed gives good biomass yield, and it is a
rich source of cellulose (64.51%), lignin (7.69%), and ash (12%). In addition, they
acquire both the cationic and anionic binding sites. Though raw biochar is a good
adsorbent, they are less efﬁcient compared to the modiﬁed char. It involves func-
tional modiﬁcation and surface oxidation that enhances the adsorption potential. For
instance, acid or alkali treatment will increase the metal uptake. In case of chromium,
Cr6+ uptake was improved, whereas Cr3+ uptake is lowered in acidic enhancement.
2.2.7
Mechanism of Adsorption
There are mainly ﬁve different mechanisms (Fig. 2.1) for removal of heavy metals
from industrial washouts which are as follows (Inyang et al. 2016):
1. Physical sorption
2. Ion exchange
3. Complexation
4. Electrostatic interactions
5. Precipitation
Hexavalent chromium follows the mechanism of electrostatic attraction and
reduction where they are converted into trivalent which forms complex with the
functional groups. Heavy metals form complex with the biochar due to the occur-
rence of special O-containing functional groups including carboxylic, hydroxyl,
32
E. Parameswari et al.

amine, alcohol, etc. The O-containing functional groups such as catechol, diols, and
unsaturated anhydro sugars on the adsorbent surface reduce Cr (VI) into Cr (III)). Xu
et al. (2018) found out that besides reducing the ions, they also aid in adsorbing the
reduced metal ion. The authors also quoted that at lower pH the biochar acts as
electron donors, whereas at higher pH acts as electron shuttle (O-centered radicals).
2.2.8
Impact of Surface Properties
Surface properties highly affect the adsorption process of biochar. It is based on the
type of biomass used, pyrolysis temperature, and pretreatment/posttreatment
handling. Biochar is an amorphous and honeycombed structure. They have hetero-
geneous adsorption sites. If pore size is too narrow for the ions to bind and diffuse
into the surface, steric hindrance occurs. The criteria for hindrance lie in the fact that
the ratio of pore size to the minimum critical diameter is less than 1050. The pore
aperture of the surface varies. The different sizes include nanostructures, micropores
(<2 nm), and mesopores (2–50 nm). The micropores are produced on the surface of
biochar due to dehydration during the pyrolysis process. Composition of biochar
predicts the pore aperture. Plant biochar shows higher porosity than biochar from
biosolids. Cellulose-rich biochar produces micropores, whereas macropores are
developed from lignin-rich material.
Another surface factor inﬂuencing sorption is surface charge. As the biochar
added for wastewater treatment, surface charge is controlled by the pH of the
solution. Point of zero charge is the pH where net charge of the surface is zero.
When pH > pHpzc, negative charges dominate the surface so it attracts cations and
Fig. 2.1 Various mechanisms for sorption of metal ions on biochar (Shaheen et al. 2018)
2
Utility of Surface-Modified Biochar for Sequestration of Heavy Metals in Water
33

vice versa. At higher pyrolysis temperature, pHzpc is increased where positively
charged functional groups increased resulting in less negative charges.
Organic content is an important surface property. It is determined by aromaticity
and polarity. Aromaticity is represented by ratio of aromatic to total carbon content
in the biochar. Polarity is subjected to the aliphatic portion of the biochar. The
overall polarity is increased by the oxygen-containing functional groups. The
organic content can be carbonized and non-carbonized due to improper carboniza-
tion which inﬂuences isotherm. Carbonized and non-carbonized fractions represent
isotherm with curvature and linear isotherm, respectively.
Another surface property of biochar is elemental composition. When the feed-
stock is pyrolyzed, chemical composition of the biomass gets changed. When the
temperature increases, the detachment of oxygen- and hydrogen-containing func-
tional groups occurs and leads to increase in carbon groups. Hence, the carbon can
increase for about 90% and greater reduction in oxygen and hydrogen. Modiﬁed
biochar assists in amelioration of the surface properties. Chemical oxidation of the
biochar increases the hydrophilicity as the functional groups (Table 2.1) such as –
OH and –COOH are increased. It also enhances pore size and structure of biochar.
On the other hand, chemical reduction decreases the oxygen-containing groups and
improves the nonpolarity of biochar. In addition, it expands the surface area and
strengthens the pore volume (Yang et al. 2019).
2.2.9
Factors Affecting Adsorption Process
2.2.9.1 Effect of pH
The pH is a signiﬁcant factor inﬂuencing adsorption. The pH differs not only for the
different metals but also for different kinds of biomass. As aforesaid, anion adsorp-
tion is facilitated more at pHpzc > pH. On the other hand, pHpzc < pH favors cationic
sorption. Chromium prevails in HCrO4 form at pH 1.0 and as Cr2O7
2, HCrO4
,
and Cr3O10
2 at pH 2–6, while the dominant species is HCrO4
. At pH greater than
6–11, CrO4
2 dominates. Hexavalent chromium adsorption is higher at lower pH
and decreases as the pH increases. Because at lower pH, the biosorbent surface is
dominated by H ions and hence the surface becomes positively charged which
improves the Cr (VI) adsorption onto surface, while at higher pH, OH ions
inﬂuences the surface which causes electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent
surface and the negatively charged Cr (VI) species. The Cr (VI) adsorption at pH
below 2 is administered by reduction to Cr (III). The pH is also varied due to changes
in acidic groups on adsorbent surface.
Modiﬁed biochar surface also shows variations in different pH range due to
changes in the chemical nature of the adsorbent functional group. Those modiﬁed
char adsorb Cr (VI) more efﬁciently because they have low surface net negative
charge compared to the unmodiﬁed biochar. In addition to higher acidic conditions,
modiﬁed biochar could remove the ions at high rates even in the wide range of pH up
to 7.0. Adsorbate solution pH inﬂuences the solution chemistry of ions such as redox
reactions, hydrolysis, and precipitation which in turn inﬂuences biosorption

availability and speciation of ions. Finally, increase in pH resulted in negative
charges on the surface and therefore decreased the sorption. In addition, more
number of protons is required for hexavalent reduction.
2.2.9.2 Effect of Dosage
Amount of biochar added is a vital parameter affecting the biosorption. It is studied
by ﬁxing other factors constant. Usually, the adsorption increases with increase in
dosage. This fact is due to increase in surface area of the adsorption resulting in large
number of active sites. But in many cases, lower amount of adsorbent shows higher
uptake of heavy metals. This is due to overlapping of Cr (VI) ions on surface of the
biosorbent decreased the unit adsorption. It also increased the diffusion path length.
Thus, increase in dosage of biochar increased the removal efﬁciency but decreased
the biosorption per unit weight of biochar. There may be interference in binding sites
due to deﬁciency of solute for all the exchangeable sites present on the biochar. The
removal efﬁciency stays constant after reaching the optimum level. Adsorbent
functional group and their concentration inﬂuence the adsorption of different
adsorbents (Singha and Das 2011).
2.2.9.3 Effect of Reaction Time
Chromium (VI) adsorption increases with increase in time. Equilibrium time is
determined by the adsorbent nature and its sorption sites (Singha and Das 2011).
The adsorption is higher at the initial stage and then it decreases near the equilibrium.
Presence of more number of binding sites increases the surface area which is later
occupied by the Cr (VI) and gets saturated. The initial metal ion concentration
facilitates the monolayer formation on the surface. Hexavalent chromium ions are
adsorbed within short period to reach equilibrium in physical adsorption. When the
contact time increases, the chemical binding of species with the surface of biochar
also increased.
2.2.9.4 Effect of Temperature
Temperature also plays a crucial role in adsorption process. The adsorption potential
increases with increase in temperature indicating that the process is endothermic.
This is because the rise in temperature results in higher diffusion rate of the metal
ions on the adsorbent internal pores and outer surface. Equilibrium capacity is varied
by the temperature for various absorbents. Hence, the adsorption is favored by lower
temperature for some cases. For example, biochar made from peanut hull have
higher potential for Cr (VI) removal at lower temperature as the functional groups
containing “O” are more at this condition which favor metal ion interaction. But
when this biochar is treated with magnetic property (γ-Fe2O3), it is favored by higher
temperature.

2.2.10 Isotherm Study for Adsorption
In order to enhance the adsorption process, isotherms must be studied well. These
equilibrium relationships are essential for the assessment of effective adsorption
system and how the adsorbate interacts with the surface of adsorbents. As a result,
isotherm explains the mobility of heavy metal ion from aqueous solution into the
porous solid adsorbent. It also describes the degree of afﬁnity, surface properties,
and capacity of adsorbent used. The isotherms are classiﬁed as one-, two-, three-,
four-, and ﬁve-parameter isotherms. One-parameter isotherm is the simplest iso-
therm model where the adsorbate is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the
gas. The most commonly used isotherm models are Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms.
Langmuir isotherm is used to quantify the adsorption potential of various
adsorbents though it was initiated for gas-solid phase. It is a monolayer adsorption
that occurs at a ﬁxed number of sites. It follows a dynamic equilibrium which
balances the rate of adsorption and desorption. This theory has arrived that rise of
distance results in rapid decrease of the intermolecular forces. In contrast, Freundlich
isotherm is based on the multilayer adsorption between the liquid and solid phase. It
occurs on a heterogeneous surface. In this model stronger binding sites are ﬁlled ﬁrst
and then the energy of adsorption decreases exponentially. Temkin isotherm takes
into account the indirect interactions of the adsorbate and adsorbent. Increase in
surface coverage leads to decrease in the heat of adsorption of molecules. Though
nonlinear regression analysis is used by the researchers, linear analysis is frequently
used for analyzing adsorption performance. Therefore, the successful adsorption
isotherm modeling inﬂuences the accuracy of sorption process (Ayawei et al. 2017).
2.2.11 Kinetic Models for Adsorption of Heavy Metals
Kinetic study is used to express the rate of chemical processes that governs the
residence time in adsorption process. It is used to determine the performance and
mechanism of adsorption. The rate of kinetics depends on the species concentration,
and the law is expressed as follows (Gupta and Bhattacharyya 2011):
R ¼ K A
½ a B
½ b . . . . . . . . . :
where K is the kinetics coefﬁcient and A, B, etc. are the species involved in
adsorption which have the order a, b, etc.
The rate-limiting step and kinetics have been portrayed by different kinetic
models. They are pseudo-ﬁrst-order, pseudo-second-order, Adam-Bohart-Thomas
model, Elovich model, Ritchie’s equation, intraparticle diffusion, and external mass
transfer model. Pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate equation was ﬁrst presented by Lagergren in
1898. He explained the oxalic and malonic acid adsorption by the charcoal, i.e.,
liquid-solid phase adsorption. Though it is the earliest model, it was found that it is
not suitable for whole contact time, whereas appreciable only for about initial
2

37

20–30 min. Pseudo-second-order kinetic model was introduced by Ho which
involves the divalent metal ion adsorption on peat. This model is interpreted as
special kind of Langmuir kinetics that gives two assumptions. They are (1) amount
of ion species determines the total number of sorption sites at equilibrium and (2) ion
concentration is constant with time. Intraparticle diffusion model is found to be a
suitable model in case of diffusion of ions into the pores for porous substance. It is a
rate-limiting factor but not for the whole process where other models control the rate
simultaneously. Homogeneous solid diffusion model (HSDM) is the typical
intraparticle diffusion model. Elovich rate equation was initially introduced by
Zledowitsch for chemisorption of gases onto solids, whereas it has expanded to
the aqueous phase adsorption. Elovich model states that adsorption takes place on
particular sites and the energy is directly proportional to surface coverage in
adsorption.
2.2.12 Response Surface Methodology
Biosorption is a multifactor-dependent process which impacts the sorption perfor-
mance. Hence, optimization is a best method to ﬁnd the speciﬁc condition that
results in best efﬁciency. The response surface methodology (RSM) is one of the
excellent methods for optimization of parameters. It will help in reducing the number
and cost of experiments. The RSM is a set of mathematical and statistical tools
developed by Box and Wilson. It deﬁnes the interaction and relation between the
dependent and independent variables. The results will be in the form of 2-D contours
and 3-D plots (Nair et al. 2014).
Optimization in RSM is carried out by the following six steps. They are (1) inde-
pendent variable selection, (2) suitable design selection, (3) carrying out the experi-
ment and data generation, (4) the results were ﬁtted with model equation,
(5) veriﬁcation of the obtained response graphs, and (6) graphical representation
and determination of optimal conditions. The popular experiment designs involved
are Box-Behnken design, central composite design, full three-level factorial design,
and Doehlert matrix. The full factorial design includes three levels such as maxi-
mum, mean, and minimum which are represented by +1, 0, and 1, respectively. It
includes all possible combinations. The disadvantage is second-order and higher-
order polynomials. Hence to overcome this, Box and Wilson (1951) have introduced
the central composite design (CCD). This CCD is highly efﬁcient up to six factors
and then decreases. The CCD is applied for parallel experiments instead of sequen-
tial experiments. In order to produce an alternative to the full factorial design, Box
and Behnken developed the incomplete block design. It includes only two-level
factorial (+1, 1) which is less labor extensive and more economical in industrial
research. Apart from these advantages, RSM ﬁnd difﬁculty over wide range. Hence
the selection of domain must be concentrated by the experimenter (Nair et al. 2014).

2.2.13 Significance of Column Experiment
The contact between adsorbate and adsorbent is brought out by various techniques
such as batch, column, continuous ﬂuidized bed, and pulsed bed experiment. For
adsorption of heavy metals, batch experiment is widely used in the laboratory scale,
while column setup will facilitate treatment of large quantities of wastewater in
commercial scale (Parameswari et al. 2020). The adsorption performance of the
column study is explained by the breakthrough curve analysis. The determining
factors for operation of column are time to attain breakthrough point and shape of the
breakthrough curve. The effect of variables on the adsorption efﬁciency is described
by various models. Among them, Adam-Bohart, Yoon-Nelson, and Thomas models
are widely utilized. Thomas model predicts the breakthrough curves and it follows
second-order reversible kinetics. It describes the column performance and predicts
the monolayer adsorption. It is applied in adsorption process where internal and
external diffusion limitations are absent. Yoon-Nelson model is a simple assumption
which states that decreasing rate of probability of adsorption is directly proportional
to breakthrough and adsorbate adsorption. Adam and Bohart model is based on the
assumption that adsorption rate depends upon the residual capacity and sorbate
concentration. Column experiment is better, fast, and feasible for industrial scale.
Further studies are required to overcome the challenges of column study (Patel
2019).
2.2.14 Activation of Biochar
Tailoring the properties of biochar to improve the surface properties is an emerging
technology for efﬁcient removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants. Surface
enhancement of biochar can be achieved by different methods (Fig. 2.2). They are as
follows:

Acid /oxidizing

Fig. 2.2 Different methods of biochar modiﬁcation (Shakoor et al. 2020)
2

39

1. Steam activation
2. Heat treatment
3. Acid modiﬁcation
4. Alkali modiﬁcation
5. Impregnation methods
Steam activation is the widely used method where improvement is obtained by
exposure of biochar to steam for partial gasiﬁcation which enhances the surface
pores and surface area. Bardestani and Kaliaguine (2018) found an increase in BET
surface area by steam activation from 50 to 1025 m2/g.
The disadvantage of this process was found out that it does not have signiﬁcant
impact on the functional groups. Heat treatment increases the surface hydrophobicity
and functional groups of biochar by exposing to heat at temperature of about
800–900 C.
Acidic modiﬁcation by introducing the oxidants improves the surface area due to
increase in porosity. The expansion of micropores leads to increase in the oxygen-
containing functional groups such as carboxylic, ketonic, and hydroxyl groups. Due
to the presence of these groups, there is an increase in O/C and H/C molar ratios
which leads to decrease in hydrophobicity. Sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric
acid, and nitric acid are the common oxidizing agents used for the biochar ameliora-
tion. Sarkar et al. (2019) in his study reported that acid modiﬁcation enhanced the
active sites 10 times and 25.29% increase in carbon content. It has also improved
BET surface area of about 142.78  2.57 m2g1.
The phosphoric acid treatment increases the micropores enhancing the speciﬁc
surface area. The micropores were formed by two mechanisms: (1) H+ catalysis
process generates the micropores, utilizing H+ ions from H3PO4, and (2) the organic
PO4
3 bridge ensured the carbon skeleton from collapse of micropores by means of
phosphate radical cross-linking.
Enhancement of biochar with alkali like potassium hydroxide and sodium
hydroxide offers additional positively charged sites which assist in absorbing nega-
tively charged species. Alkali treatment increases the surface area as it increases the
surface basicity. For example, potassium hydroxide-tailored biochar has improved
surface area from 14.4 to 49.1 m2g1. Sun et al. (2015) reported that effect of alkali
modiﬁcation depends on the preparation methods and feedstock nature. In addition
to surface area, there is an increase in the surface aromaticity (H/C). When compared
to acid treatment, alkali modiﬁcation showed lesser O/C and higher N/C ratio. Mahdi
et al. (2019) suggested that alkali pretreatment can consume long time and is
performed at low temperature and high concentration. In case of acid pretreatment,
it can be at lower temperature and long retention time, otherwise at higher tempera-
ture in a short retention time. Hence, time is one of the important factors to be
considered during surface modiﬁcation of the biosorbent.
Impregnation is accompanied by different materials such as metal oxides,
minerals, organic compounds, nano-materials, clay, and carbonaceous materials.
This method is quite different from the physical method as it introduces new
functional groups which are absent on the surface earlier. It involves two methods
40
E. Parameswari et al.

of impregnation pre-pyrolysis and post-pyrolysis. The mineral impregnation is
mostly carried out using FeCl3, FeO, and MgCl2 which introduces positive charge
favorable for the removal of inorganics like chromium. The γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles
on surface enhance the sorption sites through electrostatic interactions. The major
mechanisms for sorption on the biochar impregnated with magnetic material are
electrostatic attraction, surface complexation, ion exchange, and O-containing
groups. Coating with carbon-rich material is mostly assisted by the introduction of
graphene oxide for effective sorption of heavy metals.
Treatment with polyethylenimine solution increases the sorption sites by intro-
duction of primary and secondary amine groups (Table 2.2). In nanocomposite,
establishment of particles such as MnOx and ZnO reduces the overall O/C ratios
which shoot up the metal uptake capacity. The nZVI has been utilized for reduction
and adsorption of Cr (VI). The removal efﬁciency of 98.35% was recovered wherein
the virgin biochar tends to remove only 64.04%. Wang et al. (2019) had modiﬁed the
bamboo biochar with polyethylenimine for adsorbing U(VI) and compared with the
unmodiﬁed biochar. As a result, PEI (polyethylenimine)-alkali/acid biochar showed
9–10 times higher adsorption capacity.
2.2.15 Regeneration of Adsorbents
As the biochar can undergo several adsorption-desorption cycles, it is a good option
to go for effective desorption and regenerating the adsorbent from the adsorbate. The
desorption process helps in reducing the biochar cost in treatment and also the
environmental risk of secondary pollutant. The eluted metal can also be used for
various purposes. It should be noted that the desorbents used are cheap and nonpol-
luting. The adsorbate must be easily readsorbed and the desorbing agent should not
damage the structure of adsorbent. The elutant used may be of varying concentration
from 0.01 to 5 M (Table 2.3). The efﬁciency increases with increase in molarity. For
instance, Pb (II) ions adsorbed on the surface have been regenerated with 0.01 M at
77.7% efﬁciency and 0.5 M HCl at 98.3% efﬁciency. However, in some cases
biochar structure may be degraded at higher concentration.
The best desorbent is chosen from the ﬁrst desorption cycle. Double-distilled
water is found to express worst behavior in detachment of bounded metal ions.
Hence, adsorbed heavy metals are desorbed by undergoing multiple washes with
various desorbents such as strong acids (HNO3, HCl, H2SO4), strong alkali (NaOH),
salts (NaNO3, KNO3), and chelating agents. These elutants provide cations which
could replace the adsorbed metal ions on the surface of adsorbent. However, the
metal ions regeneration cannot be 100% as they may be tightly bonded in the porous
space and hence cannot be removed easily.
Acid favors regeneration process as acidic condition prevents the metal ion
sorption. Desorption with alkali has less efﬁciency compared to the acids. The
acid condition provides a space for the surface to be protonated by H3O+ ions
desorbing the ions of positive charge. The sorbents were washed with distilled
water after desorption followed by treating with 1 M CaCl2. The use of calcium

chloride removes the excess protons and repairs the damage caused by the acid
creating the new sites for binding. It also reduces the loss of sorbent mass and hence
decreased by 18%. It has been recorded that even after three sorption cycles, the
change in sorption and desorption efﬁciency is negligible. Hence the acid elutants
have been used for better regeneration. But it fails in one or two cases. In case of
recovery of Pb (II), sulfuric acid should not be used because of the lower solubility of
lead sulfate resulting in lower pore volume (Abdolali et al. 2015).
Alkaline salts such as NaOH, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 were utilized as elutants.
Alkaline desorbents can elute the metal ions based on the pH. The pH responsible for
elution is alkaline condition (pH 8–10) because the adsorption forces weaken and the
bounded Cr ions get eluted into the aqueous solution. Desorption of ﬁxed bed
column is carried out by purging with inert ﬂuid, change in pH, and heat treatment.
Chelating agents desorb the heavy metals from the surface of adsorbents and
produce the water-soluble compounds. Chatterjee and Abraham (2019) had reported
that commonly used chelation agents are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
and [S,S]-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS). Without altering the nature of
the adsorbent, 0.1 M EDTA showed good removal of chromium and copper. The
EDDS also effectively desorbed the contaminants mainly Cu (II), Zn, and PB. In
addition, it is also economic because it can be reused in several cycles.

2.3
Conclusion
The prevailing puriﬁcation technologies used to remove contaminants are too costly
and not eco-friendly. As the research is oriented toward economically sound and
environmentally safe technology for contaminant removal, it has paved the way for
the present investigation for the use of water hyacinth biochar as a suitable adsorbent
to bind the metallic ions. The biosorbent is renewable in nature and have more
binding sites towards heavy metals which adds strength to the development of a
viable biological system for adsorption of heavy metals from industrial efﬂuent.
Besides this, the possibility of metal recovery and reuse of desorbed chromium in

Abstract
Contamination of environment with highly toxic chemicals is increasing and
warning us to ﬁnd the technologies which are sustainable to protect the environ-
ment and human health. Presently, a variety of technologies are being applied to
decontaminate the environment and human health. However, these technologies
are costly and are not environmental-friendly. As an alternative approach, biore-
mediation
technologies
using
microbes,
plants,
and
their
enzymes
are
eco-friendly and sustainable. Biochar is a charcoal produced by pyrolysis of
biomass and a stable solid rich in carbon and is recognized as effective and
promising method to remediate various contaminations in soil and water. The
biochar application to groundwater systems with organic and inorganic pollutants
can be used as an additive/support media during anaerobic digestion and as ﬁlter
media for the removal of suspended matter and pathogens. The current chapter
discusses on the different methods for biochar production, its application, and its
use with microbes in wastewater treatment.

Introduction
An important and continuous problem related to environment is water pollution
which accompanies with worldwide human population increase and economic
development. The eutrophication of water bodies occurs through release of organic
pollutants, including phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) through runoff, which causes
harmful effects on human health and to ecological environment (Wang Beaver et al.
2014).
Various processes like mineral processing, mining, and energy generation result
in production of large quantities of contaminated efﬂuent. The contaminated efﬂuent
contains elements at different concentrations which are of potential environmental
concern, including Al, As, B, Cd, Mo, Se, Sr, V, and Zn, and therefore extensive
treatment is needed before discharge (Jankowski et al. 2006).
Deterioration of the world’s water resources is due to the continuous discharge of
variety of organic and inorganic contaminants from municipalities and industries
including pesticides, dyes, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, surfactants, and personal
care products. The discharge of uncontrolled pollutants is of major concern because
of their negative effects on ecosystems because they are highly persistent and cannot
be converted into degradable form (Zulﬁqar et al. 2019).
Therefore, it is desirable to establish cost-effective and environmental-friendly
measures to keep such pollutions under control. Worldwide, various conventional
technologies are used for the removal of these pollutants from wastewater including
adsorption, ﬂotation, coagulation-ﬂocculation, reverse osmosis, electrochemical
treatment, solvent extraction, photocatalytic oxidation, and biodegradation (Vunain
et al. 2020).
However, these technologies offer disadvantages stretching from inefﬁciency to
remove pollutants to completely convert pollutants into less toxic by-products,
consumption of high-energy chemicals, complex process, and high maintenance
and operation costs (He et al. 2017). Each and every approach has its own plus
and minus points, and none has the merits in all aspects. Therefore, a cost-effective
and sustainable technique for remediation of complex industrial efﬂuents and even
scientists are looking for practices that can improve water treatment. Therefore, an
efﬁcient and viable treatment process should be included with both economic and
environmental requirements to be marketed and applied in large scale to increase the
process efﬁciency.
Some water discharges need a speciﬁc treatment. Methods of conventional
wastewater treatment typically include primary and secondary treatment. Precipita-
tion, oxidation, and separation are methods of primary treatment. Other methods of
removal or recovery from industrial efﬂuent include advanced treatment such as
membrane separation, advanced oxidation processes, and ion exchange. Secondary
treatment is usually accomplished by activated sludge systems, which is possible
after a proper pretreatment. However, conventional systems, based on activated
sludge, result in the generation of a considerable amount of sludge, which requires
treatment before ﬁnal disposal.

Microorganisms are generally used in biological wastewater treatment which has
been proven as an effective and environmental-friendly strategy. Metabolic activity
of microbes uses different substrates, for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(Shukla
et
al.
2014),
Aspergillus
niger
(Vassilev
et
al.
1997),
and
Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides (Liu et al. 2015a, b).
Microorganisms are able to degrade toxic pollutants in aqueous media during
their metabolic process. Among them photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) have been
found to be an effective and eco-friendly species that can degrade carbon, nitrogen,
and phosphorus in the wastewater simultaneously (Idi et al. 2015). This process is
called as bioremediation which is considered as a standard practice for the restora-
tion of heavy-metal-contaminated soils and water. This process is eco-friendly and
cost-effective compared to other conventional methods, which are often very expen-
sive, in addition to producing signiﬁcant amounts of toxic sludge. Degradation of
pollutants by the microorganisms depends on the environmental conditions suitable
for their growth and metabolism including temperature, pH, and moisture
(Ayangbenro and Babalola 2017).
Of all those methods, promising technology that can be used to remediate various
contaminations, bioremediation, especially biochar-amended phytoremediation, is
increasingly being recognized. Biochars through immobilization inﬂuence the bio-
availability and bioaccessibility of metals for bioremediation. Biochar is a carbon-
rich product, which plays signiﬁcant roles on the bioaccessibility and bioavailability,
in
turn
biotransformation
and
bioremediation
of
heavy-metal-contaminated
ecosystems. Biochar is a low-cost eco-friendly product produced from organic
wastes including municipal, forest, and agricultural wastes (feedstocks) under dif-
ferent pyrolysis systems, and thus, the surface properties could be varying
signiﬁcantly.
Conversion of organic wastes into biochar can be achieved by different
techniques including pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC),
and torrefaction. Of all, pyrolysis is the conventional carbonization method for
producing biochar, while other methods do not meet the deﬁnition of biochar
which has been speciﬁed in the guidelines for the European Biochar Certiﬁcate
(EBC). Feedstock comprises of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, fat, and starch
which gets thermally broken down during pyrolysis forming three products: biochar
(solid), bio-oil (partly condensed volatile matter), and non-condensable gases (CO2,
CO, CH4, and H2) (Suliman et al. 2016). The bio-oil and gases can be captured to
produce energy and depending on the feed valuable coproducts like wood
preservatives, food ﬂavoring, adhesive, or biochemical compounds, and the yield
of biochar depends on the pyrolysis condition.
High yield of biochar can be obtained by slow pyrolysis at moderate temperature
(350–500 C) and slow heating rate than around 10% or less yield with fast pyrolysis
(600–700 C and fast heating rate) or gasiﬁcation (temperature 700 C or above).
Biochar production also depends upon the type of feedstock used, which also
changes the physiochemical properties of biochar such as surface area, polarity,
pH, etc. and determines the effectiveness of biochar in wastewater treatment.
Biochar and its derivatives can be used efﬁciently for the removal of various

contaminants because of its properties such as rich carbon content, enhanced surface
area, high cation/anion exchange capacity, and stable structure. Biochar can be used
for pathogenic organisms (Kaetzl et al. 2020), inorganic such as heavy metals, and
organic contaminants such as dyes.
Biochars remove organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater due to its
adsorption capacity, which depends on their physicochemical characteristics
(Brassard et al. 2016). The properties of biochar can be modiﬁed for better removal
efﬁciency of recalcitrant molecules, which are present at low concentrations. Biochar
can be modiﬁed by different ways which are regrouped into two classes. The
methods include chemical modiﬁcation methods such as acid modiﬁcation, alkalin-
ity modiﬁcation, and oxidizing agent modiﬁcation and physical modiﬁcation
methods.
Biochar contains both positively and negatively charged surfaces (zwitterionic) of
which negatively charged functional groups contribute to cation exchange capacity
(CEC) such as oxygen (O)-containing alcohol, carbonyl, and carboxylate functional
groups and positively charged surfaces to anion exchange capacity (AEC) such as
oxonium groups (Kong et al. 2011).
3.2
Substrate Used for Biochar Preparation
Biomass feedstock and its properties play a signiﬁcant role in the yield of biochar.
The properties of biochar can be increased by pyrolysis catalytic effects (Kan et al.
2016). Biomass feedstock is divided into lignocellulosic and non-lignocellulosic
biomass which provides biochars different properties.
Biomass Containing Lignocellulose: Biomass obtained from agriculture, forest,
and wood as raw material is lignocellulosic biomass. It consists of cellulose
(25–50 wt%), hemicellulose (15–40 wt%), and lignin (10–40 wt%), with a small
fraction of extractives (0–15 wt%) and minerals. Each composition manifests char-
acteristic retaliation during the pyrolysis process, resulting in divergence of
products. For example, increased amount of biochar results from lignin and bio-oil
yield from cellulose and hemicelluloses (Akhtar and Amin 2012).
Agricultural waste, forest residues, softwood from gymnosperms, and hardwood
from angiosperms cover a wide variety of suitable feedstock having 47–50% carbon
content and high cellulose-to-lignin ratio. Examples include evergreen plants and
deciduous plants; herbaceous biomaterials have been used as a potential source of
carbonaceous material and in biochar production offering various beneﬁts due to
their cost-effective and renewable nature (Wang et al. 2017).
Biomass Containing Non-lignocellulose: Biomass obtained from sewage sludge,
algae, insects shell, and animal and poultry manure is non-lignocellulosic biomass. It
contains a distinct proportion of protein and lipid, which gives the biochar a high
mineral content and distinct functionality of surface. Another most abundant bio-
polymer
rich
in
nitrogen
is
chitin
and
provides
functional
biochar.
Non-lignocellulosic biomass comprises of organic and inorganic matters like
carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, and lipids (Li and Jiang 2017).

3.3
Approaches for Biochar Preparation
There are several approaches for biochar production from different feedstocks.
Among them are pyrolysis, torrefaction, ﬂash carbonization, gasiﬁcation, and hydro-
thermal carbonization (HTC) the most important technologies which include ther-
mochemical conversion.
Pyrolysis: Decomposition of biomass at 300–1200 C in the absence of oxygen is
called pyrolysis. It produces carbons which are pyrogenic in nature named as
biochar. Pyrolysis process is divided into slow, intermediate, and fast depending
upon the modes, ﬂash, and vacuum (Keiluweit et al. 2010).
Slow Pyrolysis: Also called conventional pyrolysis. It occurs at low process
temperatures (400–600 C), slow heating rate (~10 C min1), long vapor residence
times (5–30 min), and long holding times (hours to days) (Inyang and Dickenson
2015). Slow pyrolysis results in 20–40% of biochar and it decreases with increasing
temperature and heating rate. Different size of pores and high thermal stability of
biochars can be obtained from broad range of mineral composition at around 500 C
like bagasse and wood stem as compared to cocopeat, paddy straw, and palm kernel
shell. Optimum temperature was found to be 450 C for high yield with low carbon
content, cation exchange capacity, high pH, ash, inorganic nutrients, and nitrogen
(Bird et al. 2011).
Fast Pyrolysis: It is deﬁned as a high-temperature treatment of biomass in the
absence of oxygen. For this, the feedstock needs drying and grinding for rapid heat
transfer and conversion which gives high yields of bio-oil instead of char. For
example, pyrolysis of wheat straw results in production of biochar containing labile
unpyrolyzed carbohydrate fraction. These two methods result in production of
biochars with different characteristics including pH, particle sizes, and SBET
(Qian et al. 2015).
Intermediate Pyrolysis: The process of intermediate pyrolysis operates at
conditions between slow and fast pyrolysis, i.e., at moderate temperatures up to
500 C, vapor residence times of 2–4 s, and solid residence times of 0.5–25 min
yielding 15–35 wt% of dry biochar. For example, wood and barley straw pellets at
intermediate pyrolysis result in production of 30 wt% char with 75 wt% carbon
(Yang et al. 2014).
Other Methods: Other popular processes of pyrolysis include ﬂash and vacuum
pyrolysis. Flash pyrolysis occurs at very high temperature (around 1000 C) and
heating rate (1000 C s1) for less than 1 s, leading to high yield of liquid and low
char production. Vacuum pyrolysis is somewhat similar to slow pyrolysis except the
low pressure at tens to hundreds kPa.
Another method of producing biochar is torrefaction which is a mild pretreatment
of raw material (200–300 C), heating at very slow rate for short period of time prior
to pyrolysis. The solid product obtained is rich in carbon, often porous, with low O/C
ratio and moisture content, thus easy to store and deliver. The carbon yield during
torrefaction depends on the raw material used, temperature at which it is heated, its
retention time, and the atmosphere of the furnace (Chen et al. 2015). Torrefaction, a
kind of mild pyrolysis which is operated at a temperature range of 200–300 C, for
3

producing biochar increases drastically. Torrefaction is dependent on biochar yield,
densiﬁcation factor, and heating value and energy yield. The higher the weight loss
or the lower the solid yield, the higher the torrefaction severity. Three different
torrefaction extents based on pretreatment temperature, including light torrefaction
(200–235 C), mild torrefaction (235–275 C), and serve torrefaction (275–300 C),
have been classiﬁed to identify the impact of the pretreatment on hemicellulose,
cellulose, and lignin (Chen et al. 2015).
Another technology that involves heat and steam as controlled process is gasiﬁ-
cation of biomass to convert it into hydrogen and other products. Various types of
biomasses like rice straw, palm kernel, switchgrass, coffee, grape waste, sawdust,
sludge, algae, etc. have been used and evaluated for biochar production. Major
problem related to gasiﬁcation is the formation of tar which on the catalytic decom-
position leads to enhanced hydrogen production. So, two-stage gasiﬁcation can be
one of the alternatives for tar reduction. Also, different steps of gasiﬁcation (drying,
pyrolysis, and gasiﬁcation) in conventional one-stage gasiﬁcation can be controlled
in the two-stage (Xin et al. 2017).
Another type of conversion is hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), type of ther-
mochemical conversion, also referred to as wet torrefaction that converts raw
biomass into a coal-like product, called hydrochar. It is an induced coaliﬁcation
process which is characterized by high carbon content and high caloriﬁc value and
can be applied to a variety of nontraditional sources including sewage, algae
municipal solid waste, etc. This process involves the treatment of substrates at
high pressure (10–50 bar) and high temperature (180–250 C) for a few hours
(0.5–8 h) with elevated moisture content, up to 75–90%, without requiring a drying
pretreatment step. During process, the biomass undergoes various reactions involv-
ing dehydration, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation and converts into a carbon-
densiﬁed product, hydrochar, which has many applications (Libra et al. 2011).
3.4
Preparation of Biochar Catalysts
For physicochemical properties of biochar, various approaches of activation and
functionalization have been used to enhance reactivity in various processes and
device architectures (Liu et al. 2015a, b). The most common methods of preparation
of biochar catalysts are impregnation and physical and chemical activation.
Impregnation method is a method in which biochar structures are incorporated
with active metallic species via mixing biomass feedstock with metal precursors,
forming active interfaces and binding sites. This method develops composite with
higher SBET, macroporosity facilitating both the adsorptive and degradative
removal. For example, biochar with zerovalent iron has been synthesized from a
lignin-magnetite pellet at 900 C. A biochar-Co3O4 composite was prepared from
rice straw by impregnating the biochar with Co(NO3)2, followed by calcinations and
hydrothermal treatment. The resulting catalyst was found to be effective in the
oxidative degradation of oﬂoxacin mediated by peroxymonosulfate (PMS)
(Lawrinenko et al. 2017).

Chemical Activation: Chemicals such as nitric acid, phosphoric acid, ammonium
nitrate, and urea change surface properties of biochar, introduce surﬁcial acidic or
basic groups, decrease pore volume, and introduce oxygen, carbonyl groups, and
nitrogen leading to improved hydrophilicity of biochar and adsorption capacity (Chu
et al. 2018).
Activation by Physical Methods: Methods like stream of steam, mild air oxida-
tion, and air activation help in modifying the structure of biochar with increased
SBET, introducing groups with enhanced catalytic activity (Rajapaksha et al. 2016).
3.5
Aquatic Biomass as Biochar
Aquatic biomass includes algae, giant kelp, other seaweeds, and marine microﬂora
with phytoplankton and zooplankton. Aquatic wastes are generated after ﬁshing and
other activities and are found in rivers, lakes, and ponds. Algae are the most
prominent among aquatic wastes which is a fast-growing unicellular and micro-
scopic biomass which can grow in freshwater, seawater, or damped oils. Algal
biochar is more nutritionally rich than lignocellulosic biochar containing N, P, K,
Ca, and Mg. Algal biochar cultivation has established markets as food, alginate,
agar, and carrageenan, giving more commercial value. Algal biomass is used to
sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide to minimize greenhouse effect. Algal biomass
converted into biochar through thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis, hydro-
thermal carbonization, or torrefaction has an application as adsorbent for environ-
mental pollutant uptake or biomaterials for medical applications.
Algal biochar has lower surface area, carbon content, higher cation exchange
capacity, high pH, high nutrient content of nitrogen, ash, and inorganic elements
compared to lignocellulosic biochar. These properties of algal biochar make it
suitable for soil amendment in agriculture (Kołtowski et al. 2017) and as a
bio-adsorbent in water treatment for remediation (Awad et al. 2017).
3.6
Modification of Biochar
Biochars adsorb heavy metal ions with an excellent capability which is relatively
lower in comparison with other known biosorbents such as activated carbon. Appli-
cation of biochar has been focused primarily on the modiﬁcation with improved
surface properties and novel structures to enhance its environmental beneﬁts and
remediation efﬁcacy. Several approaches are there to modify the biochar, i.e.,
chemical modiﬁcations, physical modiﬁcations, magnetic modiﬁcations, and
impregnation with mineral oxides.
Chemical Modiﬁcations Biochar can be modiﬁed by chemical means by carboni-
zation and activation in presence of activating chemical agent. Acidic or alkaline
modiﬁcation of biochar changes the functional groups resulting in increase of O/C
and H/C molar ratios which signiﬁes the occurrence of decrease in hydrophobicity
3
Biochar and Microbes: Collaborative Approach for Bioremediation of. . .
55

(Vithanage et al. 2015). Some causes increase in polarity of biochar which leads to
chemisorptions of pollutants from wastewater, while some increase aromaticity with
higher N/C ratio enhancing sorption of organic pollutants from wastewater.
Functional Group Modiﬁcation Biochar functional group modiﬁcation by use of
hydrogen peroxide, KMnO4, etc. can be done by oxidation. These modiﬁcations
have signiﬁcant effect on remediation of pollutant due to complexation for heavy
metals in wastewater (Rajapaksha et al. 2016). Introduction of functional groups
gives the biochar basic properties with strong afﬁnities toward metal ions in
contaminated water. Coating of biochar with chitosan can be used as adsorbent for
uptake of heavy metal ions; peanut shell modiﬁcation with hydrogen peroxide
improves lead ion adsorption capacity; biochar modiﬁcations with amino group
improve adsorption capacity for copper ions in wastewater.
Engineered Biochars Previous studies have demonstrated that engineered biochars
loaded with various metal oxyhydroxides can effectively remove P from aqueous
solutions under various conditions. Engineering nanoparticles with biochar results in
new composite with improved physical and chemical properties. Recently, different
substrate-based nanocomposite materials have been developed for decontamination
of wastewater even the nuclear wastewater (Awual et al. 2016).
Magnetic Biochars Coprecipitation of iron ion and iron oxides onto biochar results
in synthesis of nano-sized magnetic iron oxide including Fe3O4, c-Fe2O3, and
CoFe2O4 particles. These can be coated on the surface of biochar, which results in
the introduction of magnetism and active sites of iron oxide onto the biochar for the
removal of contaminants. These magnetic biochars can be easily separated from
solution by application of external magnetic ﬁeld (Chen et al. 2011).
3.7
Chemically Modified Biochars
Biochars obtained from feedstock of biomass with nanocomposites containing MgO
were prepared by pyrolysis at 600 C with N2 and MgCl2 results in dispersal of
particles of MgO all over the surface of biochar. Therefore, nanocomposites then can
be used for removing phosphate and nitrate from water. Sugar beet achieved
adsorption capacity of 835 mg/g (in the presence of phosphate). Peanut shell with
MgO biochar adsorption was 12% nitrate from water, which is the highest value
among these chars, having an adsorption capacity of 94 mg/g. High amounts of
phosphate and nitrate capacities could be due to either surface area or porosity
enhancement by the introduction of MgO (Zhang et al. 2012).

3.8
Application of Biochar for Wastewater Treatment
3.8.1
Color/Dye Removal
The efﬂuent from dye industry poses majority of problems because it contains acids,
toxic compounds, dissolved solids, and color. Various conventional wastewater
treatments are there to wipe out textile dyes due to their stability in oxidizing agents
and light. But later on biochar was developed for dye removal from wastewater
which can be obtained from straw (Xue et al. 2012) and bamboo (Yang and Jiang
2014).
3.8.2
Removal of Metal Ions
Anthropogenic activities such as manufacturing units, mining activities, smelting
process, etc. are responsible for contamination of heavy metals in water. Use of
biochar for heavy metals removal from contaminated water depends on the valence
state of metal. There are four mechanisms in which biochar can be applied for the
removal of heavy metals and they are as follows: (1) electrostatic attraction, (2) ion
exchange, (3) complexation with π electron-rich domain or surface functional
groups, and (4) coprecipitation to form insoluble compounds (Li et al. 2017).
Biochar can be applied at different stages of wastewater treatment to improve
efﬁciency and recovery of value-added by-products and can be governed by the
mechanism of adsorption and immobilization of microbial cells. Modiﬁed biochar
efﬁciently adsorbs nutrients from environment and can be used later as nutrient-rich
material for remediation purposes. Biochar can be applied in activated sludge
treatment, and settling ability by adsorption of inhibitors and toxic compounds can
be improved (Mumme et al. 2014). It can also be used for the removal of organic and
inorganic pollutants including agrochemicals, volatile compounds, antibiotics/drugs,
cationic dyes, etc. (Adeel et al. 2017).
Adsorption occurs due to high surface area, microporosity, and functional groups
having high afﬁnity to polar organic compounds. For example, rice husk, soybean-
derived biochar, red-gum woodchips, and broiler litter-derived biochar facilitate
removal of nonpolar carbofuran (pesticide) and trichloromethylene (VOC),
pyrimethanil and diesopropylatrazine (fungicide/pesticide), 1-naphthol, norﬂurazon,
and ﬂuridone from contaminated water. Biochar in wastewater removes heavy
metals and compounds like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphorus, etc.
Biochar with high organic carbon content, speciﬁc porous structure, and numer-
ous functional groups interacts with heavy metals through ion exchange, complexa-
tion, precipitation, and coordination of metal ions with π electrons (C¼C) due to
increased pH and surface area with biochar addition. Hardwood and crop-derived
biochars, Sida hermaphrodita, guayule shrub, soybean straw, wheat straw-derived
biochars, alkaline biochars derived from various agricultural residues, manure, and
animal manure-derived and cocoa husk biochar showed high afﬁnity toward Cu2+,
Cd2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+ removal.
3
Biochar and Microbes: Collaborative Approach for Bioremediation of. . .
57

Biochar due to high surface charge density allows retaining cations by cation
exchange, and the high surface area, internal porosity, and presence of both polar and
nonpolar surface sites enable it to adsorb nutrients like NH4, NO3
, and PO4
3.
Sugar beet tailing biochar, orange peel biochars, rice husk and a mixture of tree
trunks and branches, and bamboo charcoal biochar can be used (Pokharel
et al. 2020).
Suspended aerobic microbe growth decomposes organic matter in wastewater in
activated sludge treatment, where numerous micro-pollutants from pharmaceuticals,
personal care products (PCPs), pesticides, disinfectants, and antiseptics are of great
importance. Therefore, biochar can be added to the aeration basin of activated sludge
system. Biochar results in increased process stability by (a) adsorption of inhibitors
(heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), (b) increasing the buffering capac-
ity of the system, and (c) immobilization of microbial cells.
Among different approaches anaerobic digestion is one of the most promising
treatment technologies for wastes management. It is an eco-friendly process because
of its ability to combine bioremediation and energy recovery. The anaerobic diges-
tion process removes efﬁcient pollutants under stable conditions with high energy
recovery, and their metabolic intermediate products could inhibit microorganisms by
acclimation of bacterial cells and hinder their activity. In order to counteract the
inhibition in anaerobic reactors, the adoption of packing materials has been proved
as an advantageous alternative allowing for the development of a large bacterial
biomass within the digester.
For anaerobic digestion, the addition of biochar increases the rate and amount of
biogas production and also yield of CH4 attributed to the buffering properties of
biochar, promoting methanogenesis for higher biogas yield. Biochar increases
microbial metabolism and growth because of the support provided. Biomass immo-
bilization onto a packing material with large surface areas for growth of microbes has
been proved as an advantageous alternative, which allows formation of bacterial ﬁlm
within the reactors, facilitating electron transfer between interspecies and reducing
the distance between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens (Gehring et al. 2016).
The biochar could reduce the mobility or availability of the inhibitors like heavy
metals, pesticides, antibiotics, and other organic compounds by binding them in its
porous structure and maintain proper microbial activity for the digestion process.
As a Filtration Support Medium: Biochar can be used as a layer/column into a
slow sand ﬁlter or bio-sand ﬁlter systems for the treatment of wastewater. In a study
Miscanthus biochar ﬁlter was used, and higher removal efﬁciency of COD was
observed (Kaetzl et al. 2020) as compared to a sand ﬁlter. Also, higher removal of
E. coli with a mean reduction of 1.35  0.27 log-units compared to that of sand
ﬁlters with a mean reduction of 1.18  0.31 log-units was observed.
Biochar as ﬁlter media has an ability to remove total suspended solids, nutrients,
E.coli, and heavy metals from wastewater (Reddy et al. 2014). The removal of
suspended solids and organic matter in an anaerobic biochar ﬁlter could be
performed by series of steps including coagulation sedimentation and the ﬁltration.
Removals of smaller particles are carried out by straining and adsorption, while
organic matter is hydrolyzed under anaerobic conditions.
58

Biochar ﬁlter efﬁciency increases with increase in surface area and the attachment
sites on the biochar surface. It also supports the bioﬁlm establishment and the
bacterial deposition within the ﬁlter column. Filtration and adsorption of viral and
bacterial cells reduces the load of pathogens (e.g., protozoa, amoeba). Also, electro-
static attraction of bacteria to the biological ﬁlm developed on the surface of the
biochar ﬁlter and the attachment of E. coli to the biochar ﬁlter coupled with the
increase in the water-holding capacity.
The biochar after ﬁltration becomes enriched with nutrients and therefore can be
reused for remediation and as fertilizer. In the study performed by Werner et al.
(2018), the biochar ﬁlter showed removal of pathogens, and concentrations of P, Mg,
and K were reduced during ﬁltration, while N content remained unchanged. The
agronomic effects of the biochar ﬁlter on spring wheat biomass production on an
acidic sandy soil were evaluated. The results showed higher wheat biomass produc-
tion for biochar ﬁlter (37%) treatment (20 t/ha), compared to the unamended control.
As a Catalyst During Heterogenous Oxidation: For the remediation and degrada-
tion of biorecalcitrant compounds, biochar-based catalysts can be used in different
systems, including catalytic ozonation processes, Fenton-like reactions, and
photocatalytic systems. Biochar prepared from pistachio hull biomass with
macroporous structure and hydroxyl and phenolic functional groups can be used
for the ozonation of a water recalcitrant contaminant (reactive red 198 dye)
(Moussavi and Khosravi 2012). Biochars originating from pine needles, wheat,
and maize straw having free radicals transfer electrons to oxygen to form superoxide
radical anion and hydrogen peroxide which can induce OH generation. Biochar
obtained from HTC results in degradation of alachlor and methylene blue by
transferring electrons from biochar to Fe (III) (Izghri et al. 2019).
3.8.3
Biotransformation
Another important and promising application of biochar is biodegradation
treatments. It can be brought about by the immobilized-microorganism technique
(IMT)
which
combines
the
degradation
and
adsorption
technologies
by
immobilizing microorganisms on the surface of carriers. This creates a favorable
degradation environment for the microorganisms through the effective adsorption of
pollutants
on
the
carrier
to
achieve
the
efﬁcient
removal
of
pollutants.
Microorganisms immobilized on biochar could directly or indirectly ameliorate
environmental contamination of organic and inorganic pollutants. IMT results in
high microbial density and activity, a fast reaction speed, strong stability, better
resistance to environmental impact, etc. and, therefore, can be used in water pollu-
tion remediation (Chuaphasuk and Prapagdee 2019).
Using adsorption method, a surfactant-enhanced biochar immobilized with bac-
teria was prepared for the removal of PAHs in wastewater (Lü et al. 2014). Another
way of immobilizing microorganisms on biochar is gel embedding method which
immobilizes microbial cells in the limited space of microcells or microcapsules of
gelatin. Adding biochar and surfactant on the basis of a general sodium alginate
3

59

embedding agent may give rise to immobilized materials with higher microbial
immobilization efﬁciency and degradation activity and can also be applied to more
types of reactors.
Immobilized Pseudomonas aeruginosa beads with biochar and alginate as the
composite carriers and the nonionic surfactant TX100 as a promoter were prepared
by the gel embedding method and applied in both batch and continuous reaction
systems for efﬁcient removal of organic pollutants in wastewater.
Biochar immobilized with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria forms stable pyromor-
phite by precipitation and has an ability to immobilize Pb (Chen et al. 2019).
Moreover, biochar immobilized with PAH-degrading bacteria and chromium-
reducing bacteria was effective in remediation of pyrene and chromium (Wang
et al. 2019) and also atrazine, nonylphenol, and petroleum hydrocarbon (Lou et al.
2019). Apart from heavy metals and organic compounds, biochar immobilized with
microorganisms helps in the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and bioavailable
carbon as quantiﬁed by chemical oxygen demand (COD). Efﬁcient removal of
ammonium, phosphate, and COD from wastewater can be achieved by modiﬁed
biochar with immobilized heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria or photosynthetic bacteria
(Yu et al. 2019).
Paracoccus sp. strain YF1 (Liu et al. 2012), Pseudomonas stutzeri strain T1 (Yao
et al. 2013), Acinetobacter sp. SZ28, and Enterobacter sp. FL (Wang et al. 2018) can
be applied in the ﬁeld of wastewater bioremediation. Woodchip bioﬁlters as biochar
with mixed bacterial inoculum can increase the nitrate removal capacity. An aerobic
denitriﬁer, isolated from surface ﬂow constructed wetland and identiﬁed as Pseudo-
monas mendocina immobilized on biochar, exhibited excellent aerobic denitriﬁca-
tion ability (Zhang et al. 2019).
EC removal in existing treating systems is one of the key focus areas to mitigate;
therefore, immobilized biomass (biochar and microorganism) can be applied for
improving the performance of treatment systems. Immobilized systems can also be
easily retroﬁtted with the existing biological systems for wastewater treatment.
Bioﬁlters, rotating biological contactors (RBCs), moving bed bioﬁlm reactors
(MBBRs), and ﬁxed bed reactors (FBRs) employ immobilized systems and have
been reported to show better EC removals than conventional activated sludge
processes. In addition, membrane bioreactor systems (MBRs), which show high
potential for EC removal, also involve cell immobilization onto the biochar. Studies
have also been conducted with conventional biological systems augmented with
carrier materials to encourage biomass attachment and adsorption removal of
contaminants. Bioreactors have also been developed for biomass attached on carrier
supports for the wastewater treatment (Naz et al. 2015).
Cell-immobilized-biochar bead is another form which can be used to treat various
water pollutants. For example, cell-biochar beads can be used to treat BTEX and
Cr6+ from wastewater, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-alginate beads placed in
solution of storage tank reduced the inhibitory effects of high-load isopropyl alcohol
(IPA) vapor on microbial growth. Bamboo biochar and microorganisms are com-
bined with PVA to make the novel cell-immobilized bamboo-biochar beads (cell-
biochar bead) as a packing material in a BTF for treating toluene-contaminated waste
60
S. Sethi

gas, and the biodegradation kinetics and changes in the microbial community in the
BTF under various operating conditions were elucidated.
Softwood bark charcoal biomass with immobilized bacteria was able to remove
naphthenic acids. In one study, bamboo charcoal (BC) and wood charcoal
(WC) were used as carriers for removal of nonylphenol (NP), an environmental
pollutant with estrogenic activity, which persisted in the sewage sludge in wastewa-
ter treatment plants. Furthermore, Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Ochrobactrum,
and Stenotrophomonas were the dominant bacteria for NP degradation. The addition
of
biochar
(especially
bamboo
charcoal)
could
promote
the
growth
of
microorganisms and slow down the change of the dominant microﬂora for NP
degradation (Lou et al. 2019).
One of the developing industries is the pharmaceutical industry which generates a
lot of wastewater during manufacturing process from complex raw materials like
solvents. Wastewater contains high amounts of refractory organic compounds and
inorganic salts which continuously accumulate into natural environments and human
bodies through food chains, resulting in toxic hazards to health.
Due to high chemical oxygen demand in wastewater of pharmaceutical industry,
various strategies have been used for treatment including anaerobic technology,
advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), adsorption, biodegradation, and multi-
technology combination. Another promising technology for treatment is anaerobic
membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) (Ng et al. 2014) along with the combination of
modern membrane separation technology for high organic removal, low energy
consumption, and biogas recovery.
The most popular adsorbent material used for membrane bioreactor is powdered
activated carbon (PAC) for wastewater treatment as bioﬁlm. It can retard membrane
fouling and increase membrane ﬂux and improve sludge ﬂocculation. Compared
with PAC, biochar is a low-cost product of biomass with various functional groups
besides large speciﬁc surface area and porosity. AnMBR system with biochar and
without biochar was set to achieve AOX and COD removal and mitigating mem-
brane fouling (Chen et al. 2020).
Another industry generating major pollutants in water is leather processing
industry with azo dyes and hexavalent chromium (CrVI) as common pollutants in
wastewater. A treatment strategy to remove azo dyes, their by-products, and CrVI
using a biochar packed bioreactor was introduced. Various feedstock materials were
evaluated, after which biochar produced from pyrolysis of corn cobs at 400 C was
selected as a packing material for the reactor, based on its large surface area
(1275 m2 g1), microporosity (2–5 μm), and ability to support microbial bioﬁlm
formation.
In an experiment tannery wastewater containing reactive black-5 azo dye and
aniline was treated using bacteria Pseudomonas putida strain K1 with pyrolyzed
carbon (biochar) as a support matrix. The results showed complete biodegradation of
reactive black-5 within 5 h. Strain KI could also reduce dye and CrVI simultaneously
in 24 h in a continuous packed bed bioreactor. Complete biodegradation of aniline
(by-product of reactive black-5) in the bioreactor was obtained within 24 h in the
3

absence of CrVI, whereas degradation was decreased to 84% in the presence
of CrVI.
Another industry is battery manufacturing industry releasing mainly Pb2+ pollu-
tion. Pb2+ is removed from water using a variety of procedures, including lime
precipitation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, electrochemical process, coagulation,
and ion ﬂotation, although these treatments are costly and produce secondary waste.
Battery industries efﬂuent has high pH, electrical conductivity, COD, BOD, DO,
TDS, TSS, and TS which are due to different inorganic and organic pollutants such
as nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate affecting quality of water. Bagasse biochar with
immobilized microbes is a cost-effective adsorbent for the successful removal of
pollutants and heavy metals from different wastewater-generating industries
(Poonam et al. 2018).
Another commonly immobilized biomasses are of algal origin. Using microalgal
cells with biochar for the bioremediation of industrial efﬂuent involves biotransfor-
mation and biodegradation processes of metabolism. Microalgal biochar as an
adsorbent can be applied for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants (PNP) which
can be used as nutrients by algal cells. Therefore, biochars derived from three
microalgae species Chlorella sp. Cha-01, Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03, and
Coelastrum sp. Pte-15 can be used for PNP removal, released by dyes production,
petroleum reﬁning, and plastics manufacturing. Biochar prepared from microalgae
exhibited superior adsorption capacity for pollutants because they contain high N/C
and O/C ratios with polarizable functional groups. This biochar could be applied as
an adsorbent for the removal of organic pollutants in wastewater treatment.
Microalgal biomass, e.g., kelp; Undaria pinnatiﬁda; Saccharina japonica and
Sargassum
fusiforme;
Sargassum
sp.;
Cladophora
coelothrix,
Cladophora
patentiramea, Chaetomorpha indica, Chaetomorpha linum, Cladophoropsis sp.,
Ulva ﬂexuosa, as well as freshwater Spirogyra and Cladophora; Cladophora
vagabunda; and Oedogonium intermedium, can be used as biochar. It is
characterized by a comparatively low carbon content, surface area, and cation
exchange capacity when compared with lignocellulosic biomass, but has a high
pH plus nitrogen and inorganic nutrients such as Ca, K, Mg, and P, which is why it is
proposed to be used in agriculture as a soil fertilizer/soil additive. Its other
applications include its use as an adsorbent for the removal of organic or inorganic
pollutants or energy sources. Algal biochar is suitable for wastewater treatment like
the removal of ammonium-N (NH4+N) and various organic and inorganic
pollutants from wastewaters (Michalak et al. 2019).
Also, algal biochar as a biosorbent can be used for the removal of toxic metals
from wastewater even when their concentrations are low and range from 1 to
100 mg L1. The possibility of the production of “bio-ore” from the metal-loaded
sorbent at the end of the process is very advantageous. Combustion of biochar after
sorption enables the recovery of metals and energy accumulated in biomass. The sale
of recovered elements is known as “phyto-mining.” Algal biochar has already been
tested as a sorbent of some heavy metals such as Cu, Cd, and Zn ions from aqueous
solutions. Kidgell et al. (2014) used the biochar produced from freshwater macroalga
Oedogonium to remove metal ions from the industrial efﬂuent coming from a coal-
62
S. Sethi

ﬁred power station. Johansson et al. (2016) showed that biochars produced from
Gracilaria and Oedogonium, which were treated with Fe before pyrolysis, have a
high afﬁnity also for oxyanions such as As, Mo, and Se, which are difﬁcult to
remove through conventional techniques.
Wastewaters are severely polluted that will consequently lead to environmental
problems due to the high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen
demand (BOD) and rich in organic and inorganic nutrients. Microalgae can be used
as absorbent during cultivation stage and after converting into biochar. Cultivation
of microalgae adsorbs the nutrients and metals contained in wastewater to improve
wastewater quality and sustainability. Microalgae reduce large amount of carbon
dioxide because microalgal biomass required carbon dioxide to cultivate.
Microalgae consist of high carbon ﬁxing or photosynthetic efﬁciency compared to
plants at lands to allow low-cost efﬁciency carbon mitigation. Conversion of
microalgal biomass to biochar stores the carbon dioxide in the form of solid to
mitigate carbon to atmosphere. Production of microalgal biochar efﬁciently
mitigates the carbon and adsorbs contaminant from cultivation stage to biochar
production process.

Abstract
Biochar has been widely applied in wastewater pollution control due to its high
stability, excellent surface properties, high-developed pore structure, and rich
surface functional groups. In this chapter, the research progress of biochar
application in recent years was reviewed. The application of biochar technology
in the removal of heavy metals, organic pollutants, and nitrogen and phosphorus
nutrients was mainly summarized. In fact, although biochar is made of agricul-
tural and industrial wastes such as crop straw, litter, dewatered sludge, and
sediment by pyrolysis, it plays a substantially important role in environmental
treatment, reﬂecting the concept of “treating wastes with wastes.” Therefore,
biochar is a new, economic, and environmental material which can be used in
the wastewater treatment technology.

4.1
Application of Biochar as Absorbents
Biochar is used for wastewater treatment as a low-cost and environmentally friendly
adsorbent with high efﬁciency. It has been commonly used to adsorb pollutants in
wastewater (Sanjrani et al. 2019).
4.1.1
Adsorption of Heavy Metals in Wastewater
Heavy metals (e.g., Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Hg) are elements of great concern
due to their toxic and persistent nature in the environment. They ﬁnd their way in the
aquatic stream through various industrial operations, like mining, smelting,
electroplating, etc.
The adsorption capacity of biochar is closely related to physical and chemical
properties (Inyang et al. 2016). High speciﬁc surface area and developed pore
structure can provide more adsorption sites. Oxygen-containing groups and mineral
components can be chemically adsorbed with heavy metals to improve the adsorp-
tion effect. High speciﬁc surface area and developed pore structure can provide more
adsorption sites. The choice of adsorbent to be used for a speciﬁc application
depends on various factors, such as its cost, its selectivity for different metals, its
adsorption efﬁciency, reusability and regeneration, the adsorption and desorption
rates, its ease of synthesis, and mechanical strength (Gupta et al. 2020). For instance,
elevated pyrolysis temperature is helpful to increase capacities of rice husk biochar
for Pb (Shi et al. 2019).
Since biochar is a porous material whose ability for sorption is greatly affected by
its surface area, increasing its surface area by adding nanoparticles increases its
potential for metal sorption. For example, Yan et al. (Yan et al. 2015) synthesized
magnetic biochar/ZnS composites by depositing ZnS nanocrystals onto magnetic
biochar-based sorbents. The biochar-based sorbents showed a maximum sorption
capacity of Pb up to 368 mg/g, which was tenfold of the unmodiﬁed biochar. To
modulate the properties of biochar-based sorbents for heavy metal removal, a range
of modiﬁcation methods have been adopted. Popular approaches are chemical
alteration and physical alteration. Chemical alteration is the most common form of
alteration used. This primarily involves acid alteration, alkalinity alteration,
oxidizing agent modiﬁcation, metal salts or oxidizing agent modiﬁcation, and
carbonaceous material modiﬁcation. Physical alteration primarily includes the purg-
ing of steam and gas (Wang and Wang 2019). Metal nanoparticles, in particular iron,
are the most cost-effective and advantageous modiﬁcation materials due to their
ferromagnetic properties for the preparation of magnetic biosorbents (Gupta et al.
2020). Magnetic biosorbents boost surface areas, functional groups, and active sites
and, consequently, improve removal performance. While nanoparticles have high
adsorption capacities, they are typically not used directly in practical applications
due to their expensive regeneration. As a result, the regeneration of the adsorbent is
an extremely difﬁcult process. Therefore, to solve this problem and simplify the
68
S. Wang et al.

process of regeneration, nanoparticles with magnetic properties have been
synthesized (Liu et al. 2010).
Biochar with speciﬁc porous structure, higher organic carbon content at
noncarbonized fraction, and a number of functional groups interacts with heavy
metal contaminants in several ways. Among divalents, Cu showed greater afﬁnity
toward biochar due to the formation of surface complexes with carboxylic and
phenolic hydroxyl groups on hardwood- and crop straw-derived biochars (Tong
et al. 2011). It was found that Cu bind with phosphate and silicate groups on biochar
surface, which was the adsorption mechanism for copper ion removal from water
(Meng et al. 2014; Tareq et al. 2019).
In the recent years, modiﬁed biosorbents are being widely for improved metal
removal efﬁciency even at low concentrations and easy recovery and reuse due to
several limitations of pristine biochar and other biosorbents. Metal-induced sorbents
or magnetic biosorbents/biochar are being developed by incorporating metal
nanoparticles (Fe, Ni, Cr, Ti, Zr, Zn, Cu, etc.) (Nisticò et al. 2018). It was found
that they have improved surface area, pore size, thermal stability, crystalline nature,
and surface functionality leading to higher adsorption capacity and easy recovery
(Yin et al. 2017). The properties of magnetic biosorbents were found to be dependent
on the nature of biomass itself, metal nanoparticles, and modiﬁcation methods,
besides process parameters like pyrolysis temperature and duration and particle
size (Alizadeh et al. 2018; Dinari and Tabatabaeian 2018). Ultraﬁne nanoparticles
like metal oxides could be used as successful modiﬁers to enhance the structural and
thermal stability of the adsorbents. Different types of modiﬁcations (e.g.,
pretreatment/single step, posttreatment modiﬁcation/double step, microwave-
assisted modiﬁcation, hydrothermal modiﬁcation, etc.) are employed in the synthesis
of magnetic biosorbents. In the pretreatment method, metal nanoparticles are
incorporated into biomass before pyrolysis leading to a larger surface area, porosity,
and superparamagnetic behavior. In the second method of posttreatment, biosorbents
and nanoparticles are prepared separately before mixing. However, this is less
efﬁcient and more expensive than the pretreatment method. Microwave-assisted
synthesis of magnetic biosorbents is commonly used (Thines et al. 2017) but with
some difﬁculty in customization. This method is replacing conventional pyrolysis in
the synthesis of magnetic biochar.
Recently, engineering biochars and magnetic biosorbents are being explored as
innovative alternatives due to improved physical-chemical attributes and adsorption
capacity (Gao et al. 2015). However, they are still in experimental phase and need
further exploration. Magnetic biochar can be produced using coprecipitation
method. In this process, a carbon material is heated in the absence of fusion in a
pressurized autoclave to remove water and drive off gases and other volatile
constituents. Magnetic biochar synthesized using this method with FeCl3.6H2O
resulted in larger surface area, diverse morphology from macro-mesoporous struc-
ture, and high crystallinity besides simple recovery and reusability (Gao et al. 2015).
Moreover, a scavenger of Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (Mg-Al LDH) with
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) intercalated between the layers was found
to be extremely successful in the removal of heavy metals. For example, Cu, Cd, and
4

69

Cr(VI) could be removed from wastewater rapidly by them (Huang et al. 2019).
Since biochar without appropriate modiﬁcation and functionalization was not very
competent in the metal removal, it is an urgent to develop these novel and effective
techniques to enhance the utility of biochar (Gupta et al. 2020).
On the other hand, the decrease in oxygen-containing functional groups can affect
the metal sorption capacity of biochars. It was found that higher Pb adsorption
capacity was achieved at lower temperature (Ding et al. 2014). Figure 4.1 explains
the mechanisms of Pb sorption by bagasse biochars. The possible reason was that
oxygen-containing functional groups were responsible for Pb sorption at low tem-
perature, while Pb sorption was affected by the abundant pores at high temperature
(Sizmur et al. 2017).
Pretreatment is frequently advised to maintain adsorption efﬁciency. In most
cases, it increases removal efﬁciency and selectivity in comparison to unmodiﬁed
biosorbents. This pretreatment can enhance ion-exchange ability, improve the for-
mation of functional groups, and provide a greater number of binding sites, which, in
turn, favors metal uptake. It has been found that pretreatment modiﬁcations led to
improved attributes in biochar-based sorbents, thereby enhancing its performance
(Gupta et al. 2020).

4.1.2
Adsorption of Organic Pollutants in Wastewater
Rapid industrialization and agrochemical-based cultivation produce considerable
amounts of organic pollutants (e.g., pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(PAHs),
polychlorinated
biphenyls
(PCBS),
dyes,
antibiotics) and thus affect the environment greatly. The removal of these pollutants
from soil, drinking water sources, and wastewater still remains a challenge. Organic
contaminants are of special concern (Beesley et al. 2010; Tareq et al. 2019; Xu et al.
2012). They can persist in the environment for long periods of time and badly affect
aquatic environments as well as human health via the food chain. For example,
phenols affect the taste and odor of ﬁsh and drinking water even at very low
concentration; tetracycline is one of the most abundant antibiotics in livestock
farm wastewater (Zhang et al. 2020b).
Conventional techniques such as chemical precipitation, ion-exchange, adsorp-
tion, and membrane separation processes are often costly and yield considerable
amounts of chemical waste. In recent years, applications of biochar in organic
remediation
have
attracted
signiﬁcant
research
interest
as
a
sustainable,
environment-friendly, and low-cost alternative (Thompson et al. 2016; Tareq et al.
2019), i.e., dyes challenge conventional waste treatment methods due to their
resistance to light, oxidation, and aerobic digestion and hence amenability to
adsorption technology (Zhang et al. 2020b).
Solution pH has a predominant inﬂuence on the charge characteristics of biochars
through the protonation and deprotonation of oxygen-containing groups on the
composite surface which, in turn, affects pollutant adsorption. When the solution
pH is lower than the point of zero charge (pzc) of biochars, that is, pH < pHpzc, the
composite surface is positively charged, and anion adsorption is favored. On the
contrary, when pH > pHpzc, the surface charge is negative and hence conducive to
cation adsorption (Wang et al. 2020a). When the pH increases beyond a certain value
(amino groups are deprotonated), the contribution of the π+-π electron donor-
acceptor interaction is suppressed, and sulfathiazole adsorption by biochar is
decreased. For example, the ZrO2-biochar composite had a pzc of 7.35 and showed
maximum adsorption of reactive yellow 39 at pH 6.0 when its surface was positively
charged (Khataee et al. 2017). Positively charged ZrO2-biochar composite was also a
good adsorbent of anionic dyes which may be degraded by hydroxyl produced
during the reaction. The adsorption of organic dyes by biochars decreases as solution
pH increases. Moreover, solution pH also has a signiﬁcant effect on the adsorption of
phosphorus by biochars, reaching a maximum at about pH 3.0 (Peng et al. 2020;
Zhao et al. 2021).
4.1.3
Adsorption of Inorganic Pollutants in Wastewater
The adsorption of phosphate and nitrate are widely studied over biochars. Small
amount of phosphate (>25μg/L) in surface water can promote algal blooms and
eutrophication, leading to a decline in water quality, aquatic ecosystems, waterway
4

71

transport, and human health (Zhang et al. 2020b). Generally, adsorption of
oxyanions from aqueous solution takes place on positively charged biochar surface
through electrostatic attraction. Therefore, the solution pH is an important factor in
nitrate adsorption as biochar surface demonstrates an amphoteric nature in response
to solution pH (Tareq et al. 2019).
Another major hazardous inorganic pollutant is ﬂuoride. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), the concentration of ﬂuoride in drinking water should
not exceed 1.5 mg/L because ingestion above this level can lead to dental and
skeletal ﬂuorosis. It was found that acidic condition is more favorable for ﬂuoride
uptake due to higher positive charges on biochar surface (Oh et al. 2012). Oxidized
aluminum and iron species on the surface of sludge-based biochar were positively
charged at low pH and thus induced greater electrostatic attraction with ﬂuoride ions.
Greater adsorption of ﬂuoride ions at acidic pH has also been reported for the
deﬂuoridation of drinking water (Mohan et al. 2012; Tareq et al. 2019).
Competitive adsorption by other anions suppressed phosphate adsorption with
the impact decreasing in the order of F > SO4
2 > NO3
 > Cl. Phosphate
adsorption was also pH sensitive, reﬂecting the acid-base properties of the LDH
component and corresponding electrostatic attraction and surface complexation.

4.1.4
Adsorption Mechanism
4.1.4.1 Heavy Metal Adsorption
The ﬁve mechanisms believed to govern metal adsorption by biochars are complex-
ation, cation exchange, precipitation, electrostatic interactions, and chemical reduc-
tion. However, the contribution of a certain mechanism to a particular metal
adsorption depends primarily on the nature and valence states of the target metals
(Tareq et al. 2019).
Adsorption mechanisms governing remediation of lead from water are surface
complexation, cation exchange, and precipitation. Lu et al. performed analysis of the
relative distribution of mechanisms for Pb2+ adsorption on sludge biochars in a pilot
plant-scale study for wastewater treatment (Lu et al. 2012). In this case study,
exchange with K+ and Na+ contributed up to 4.8 and 8.5% adsorption, whereas
surface complexation contributed 42% of the adsorption. The adsorption was also
governed by precipitation as lead phosphate, surface complexation with active
carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups, as well as coprecipitation of lead with
organic matter and mineral phases of biochars (Cao et al. 2009). However, Xu et al.
(Xu et al. 2014) separated biochars into organic and inorganic fraction and showed
that lead adsorption was higher onto inorganic fraction. This observation indicates
that cation exchange and precipitation are the dominant mechanisms, while com-
plexation with functional groups has a small contribution (Baig et al. 2014; Tareq
et al. 2019).
Batch adsorption of cobalt showed that cobalt uptake was rapid and was governed
by ion exchange through calcium release (Pan et al. 2009). However, cobalt
72
S. Wang et al.

adsorption had a competitive disadvantage due to the presence of co-ions like zinc
and copper. These co-ions showed higher afﬁnity toward biochars (Tareq et al.
2019). Therefore, cation exchange was found to be predominant at eliminating
cadmium for high cation-exchange biochars (Harvey et al. 2011). When mineral
content of biochar is higher, the main mechanism for the adsorption of cadmium is
precipitation (Xu et al. 2013).
Cation exchange, surface complexation with functional groups or π electrons, and
precipitation have been cited as the remediation mechanisms controlling adsorption
of mercury from water. Surface complexation with carboxylic, phenolic hydroxyl,
and thiol groups is the most dominating mechanism. For biochars derived at higher
temperature or where functional groups are less or absent, binding with the π
electron system becomes the major contributor (Dong et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2016).
The presence of sulfur and chlorine species on alkaline biochar obtained from soya
bean stalk and dairy manure effectively removed above 90% of toxic Hg2+ in the
form of HgCl2 or Hg(OH)2 through precipitation (Kong et al. 2011). However, Hg
precipitates with Cl2 species during adsorption in the form of Hg2Cl2 (Lloyd-Jones
et al. 2004). Therefore, more research concerning the precipitation mechanism for
the remediation of mercury from water has been recommended (Li et al. 2017a;
Tareq et al. 2019).
The three major mechanisms in Cr(III) removal are complexation with
oxygenated functional groups, cation exchange, and electrostatic interaction
between negatively charged biochar and positively charged Cr(III) ions. Pan et al.
prepared biochar from peanut, soybean, canola, and rice husk and showed that
adsorption capacity increases as functional groups on biochar increase, suggesting
complexation with functional groups as the controlling remediation mechanism for
trivalent chromium (Pan et al. 2013). Chen et al. observed release of Ca2+ and Mg2+
cations into solution during adsorption. These released cations correlated well with
adsorbed Cr(III) indicating cation exchange as the main removal mechanism (Chen
et al. 2015). At lower pH of solution, cation exchange between Cr(III) and minerals
of biochar was hindered due to higher concentration. When solution pH is 2.5,
surface biochar becomes negatively charged, and trivalent chromium species
remains positively charged leading to electrostatic interaction and the removal of
the chromium. Electrostatic attraction between positively charged biochar and
negatively charged Cr(VI) species, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by oxygenated
functional groups, and subsequent Cr(III) complexation with functional groups of
biochar are the dominating mechanisms for remediation of Cr(VI) species (Mohan
et al. 2011). Due to reactive surface functional groups such as unsaturated
anhydrosugars, diols, catechol, and substituted catechol structures originating from
pyrolysis of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, Cr(VI) is easily reduced to Cr(III) at
lower pH (<2.5). Although the surface area of these biochars was very small
compared to those of commercial-activated carbons, adsorption of Cr(VI) per unit
surface area for the biochars was higher than that of activated carbons due to the
swelling effect. Biochars showed interesting swelling properties that led to addi-
tional adsorption sites by increasing internal char/water contact with maximum
chromium removal at pH 2 (Tareq et al. 2019).

Arsenic also retains a pentavalent state in the form of arsenate under aerobic
condition and is less mobile and toxic than arsenite (Sizmur et al. 2017). Complexa-
tion and electrostatic interaction are the major mechanisms governing remediation of
arsenic from aqueous solution. In the remediation of both As(III) and As(V) from
water, the adsorption capacity of biochars to the presence of oxygenated functional
groups counterbalanced the impact of lower surface area (Samsuri et al. 2013).
Although the surface porosity and micropore structure may be destroyed due to
the growth or assembly of nano-metals, more abundant surface functional groups
could be generated from the catalysis of metal ions (Ma et al. 2015). The formed
functional groups showed great afﬁnity toward HM ions to develop the metal-ligand
complexes. In addition, taking iron oxide as the example, surface oxides or
hydroxides could provide coordinative bonds (i.e., Fe–O) in the liquid phase and
then transferred HM ions into H–Fe–O–Mn+ species. In this case, the speciﬁc
surface functional groups (e.g., Fe–O and –OH) are considered as the main mecha-
nism to remove some HM ions (e.g., Zn2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+) (Wang et al. 2019).
During the removal process of As5+, the inner sphere complexation is produced
between surface –OH groups and As5+ at pH ¼ 4.1, where –OH groups are derived
from the nZVI NPs on the surface of BC (Wang et al. 2017; Ho et al. 2017).
Different adsorption mechanisms are also postulated for metals in different
oxidation states. For example, Cr(VI) and Cr(III) exhibit different adsorption max-
ima (7 and 20 mg/g, respectively) over biochars. The higher afﬁnity for Cr(III) was
attributed to synergistic precipitation and ion-exchange processes as follows (Zhang
et al. 2020b):
1. Ca and Mg dissolve in the aqueous Cr(III) solution:

novel sorbents through effective synthesis and modiﬁcation protocols as they are
strongly correlated. Heavy metal removal by biochar-based sorbents follows differ-
ent mechanisms like physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, complexation, ion
exchange, and precipitation. Metal removal is found to occur through individual or
combination of mechanisms stated above. Biochar-based adsorbents have high
surface area with diverse pore network ranging from micro-, meso-, and macropores
(Mukherjee et al. 2011). Pore volumes with high afﬁnity toward metals can follow
adsorption, negatively charged surface of the sorbent can attract positive metals
through electrostatic attraction, and ligands and various modiﬁers can form
complexes or precipitates with metals to be removed (Gupta et al. 2020).
In physical adsorption, metal removal occurs through diffusional movement of
metal ions through pores without chemical bond formation. Higher carbonization
temperatures favor this mechanism due to enhanced surface area and pore volume,
and the mechanism could be better explained by ﬁlm pore diffusion model. In
ion-exchange mechanism, the ionizable cations on the sorbent are exchanged with
heavy metals in solution whose efﬁciency depends on the contaminant size and
surface functionality. It has been found that nonwoody and grassy biochars with high
O content and acidic sites exhibit higher cation-exchange capacity (Harvey et al.
2011). In electrostatic interaction, surface-charged sorbent and metal ions lead to
their immobilization. The pH, point of zero charge (pzc), and carbonization
temperatures are found to play a critical role in this mechanism (Dong et al. 2011;
Mukherjee et al. 2011).
In the mechanism of complexation, the ligands and metals are found to form
multiatom complexes. This is mostly prevalent in the presence of transition metals
and oxygen-containing functional groups and employing plant-derived biochars. In
the last mechanism of precipitation which is very common in the removal of metals
and rare-earth elements, immobilization occurs by the formation of solids either in
solution or on the sorbent surface during the sorption process.
Precipitation mechanism is widely observed at high pH and mineral content, in
both plant- and animal-derived biochars (Inyang et al. 2011). As discussed in the
preceding sections, biochar by itself is inferior in metal removal. Hence, to enhance
biochar performance, various kinds of modiﬁcation methods, such as mineral
impregnation, nanoscale metal additions, surface oxidation, and surface reduction
have been applied. These modiﬁcations are found to enhance biochar performance in
terms of metal removal capacity, thermal and structural stability, desired morphol-
ogy, and easy recovery and reuse (Gupta et al. 2020). It has been found that
modiﬁcations and mechanisms of metal removal are strongly correlated. It was
revealed that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups introduced through modiﬁca-
tion underwent complexation with heavy metals before and after adsorption. Also,
oxygen-containing functional groups are found to release H+ after ion-exchange,
thereby reducing solution pH (Mohan et al. 2014).
The charge characteristics on the sorbent surface are found to affect the strength
of materials through electrostatic adsorption with pH playing a vital role in achieving
the desired metal removal capacity. It is found that when pH is more than pHzpc
(point of zero discharge), the negatively charged surface due to deprotonation led to
4

75

strong electrostatic attraction toward the metals leading to enhanced removal. Con-
versely, with pH higher than pHzpc, the positively charged surface due to protonation
led to lower afﬁnity toward the metal besides lower availability of sites due to
competition between protons and metal, thereby leading to lower metal removal
(Jin et al. 2014; Mohan and Skews 2013).
Besides abovesaid mechanisms, the modiﬁed biochars are also found to follow
precipitation and reduction mechanisms to further enhance afﬁnity toward metals.
Oxygen-containing functional groups were found to follow electrostatic attraction,
ion exchange, and complexation mechanisms (Ding et al. 2016). The presence of
metals through modiﬁcation was found to enhance metal removal through the
formation of precipitates like carbonates, phosphates, and silicates with metals
(Xu et al. 2013). Nanoscale modiﬁcations in the biochar-based adsorbents led to
metal removal through the mechanisms of electrostatic attraction and ion exchange
(Erdinç et al. 2010). Variable valence metals (e.g., Cr and Pb) were found to follow
reduction mechanism primarily in metal removal besides others (Gupta et al. 2020;
Li et al. 2015a, b). The principle of metal removal mechanisms is shown in Fig. 4.2.
4.1.4.2 Organic Pollutant Adsorption
Basic mechanisms involved for the adsorption of organics are π-π interaction,
hydrophobic sorption, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, pore diffusion,
surface complexation, and partitioning through functional groups (Tareq et al. 2019).
Surface functional groups are responsible for the surface effect on the sorption of
biochars. The dissociation/association of biochar surface functional groups and the
ionizable organic pollutants control the H-bond interactions. Many researchers
reported a pH-dependent sorption behavior of ionizable organic pollutants (Xiao
et al. 2018). For the sorption of sulfamethazine onto biochars, the sorption mecha-
nism was proposed to be a π+π donor-acceptor interaction at low pH and a negative
Fig. 4.2 Principles of metal removal mechanisms (Gupta et al. 2020)
76
S. Wang et al.

charge-assisted H-bond at high pH. A quantitative study on the H-bond interactions
is still needed to evaluate the contribution of H-bonding with pKa considerations
from both biochar functional groups and ionizable pollutants (Xiao et al. 2018).
The polar π interaction along with the π stacking between the antibiotics and the
benzene bundles on the biochar are responsible for the greater adsorption onto
biochars. The slightly higher adsorption afﬁnity of naproxen is attributed to its
hydrophobicity as well as its polarizability. The more polar sites of naproxen induce
greater interaction with the quadrupole moment of benzene bundles on the biochars
compared to acetaminophen. Moreover, greater adsorption is eminent for naproxen
since it has a naphthalene aromatic ring, whereas acetaminophen has a single
benzene ring only (Tareq et al. 2019).
Electrostatic interaction between pollutant species and biochar surface is the
prime mechanism responsible for the removal of aromatic cationic dyes (Qiu et al.
2009; Tareq et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2011). For example, the mechanism underlying the
removal of sulfonamides and tetracyclines is probably due to the electron donor-
acceptor interactions and associated with the attracting groups on surface area rings
(Peiris et al. 2017); SMX adsorption onto biochars was mainly controlled by p-p
interaction and effected by the solution pH value; iron- and zinc-doped biochars
showed high simultaneous removal of tetracycline from aqueous solution. The
predominant adsorption mechanisms include site recognition, bridge enhancement,
and site competition (Zhou et al. 2017).
4.1.4.3 Inorganic Pollutant Adsorption
Sorption of inorganic pollutants by biochars is due to stoichiometric ionic exchange,
electrostatic attraction, or surface precipitation (Sizmur et al. 2017):
1. Chemical sorption occurs due to ion exchange with the abundant functional
groups on the carbonaceous surface of biochar, such as carboxylic, hydroxylic,
or phenolic groups. These groups confer cation-exchange capacity (CEC) to
biochar depending on feedstock and pyrolysis temperature, probably due to the
loss of oxygenated functional groups above this temperature. Chemical sorption
of cations relies on releases of protons and base cations (Na, K, Ca, or Mg) from
the biochars. Since chemical sorption is stoichiometric, sorption efﬁciency is pH
dependent and thus dictated by the pH of the medium (Sizmur et al. 2017).
2. Physical (electrostatic) sorption occurs between positively charged ions in water
and the delocalized cloud of electrons associated with aromatic groups on the
surface of carbonaceous biochars, creating cation-π interactions with the C¼C
aromatic bonds. Unlike chemical sorption, physical adsorption does not require
stoichiometric release of cations or protons from the biochars (Sizmur et al.
2017).
3. Precipitation (or coprecipitation) of inorganic pollutants (particularly metal
cations) with insoluble salts occurs on the surface of biochars with a high mineral
ash content. For example, precipitation of Pb has been demonstrated on the
surface of phosphate-rich biochars derived from manures. Biochars may also
4

77

raise the pH of the solution, leading to the precipitation of metal oxides, which are
generally sparingly soluble (Sizmur et al. 2017).
Ammonium has a low charge-to-radius ratio similar to alkali metal ions and hence
does not form a stable bond with biochar surface like divalent metal ions do. The
most inﬂuential factor for the adsorption of ammonium ions is the amount of acid
functional groups present on the biochar surface and not the pore structure and
micromorphology. Biochars prepared from different agricultural wastes at varying
temperatures were found to be capable of retaining over 90% of ammonium (Cai
et al. 2016). In this case, adsorption of ammonium was governed by electrostatic
interaction and hydrogen bonding with biochar surface containing carboxylic acid
and ketone groups (Fig. 4.3). Ion exchange was reported as another mechanism
involved in the remediation of ammonium ion by biochar derived from pig manure
and straw (Tareq et al. 2019).
The nitrate removal was primarily due to outer-sphere complexation arising from
the electrostatic interaction, but cationic exchange also contributed to some extent
(Chintala et al. 2013). However, the majority of investigations concerning nitrate
remediation from water have focused on the application of acid-activated biochars
and metal oxide-biochars. The possible reason is that it is easy to create positive
surface charge on biochar surfaces after modiﬁcation (Tareq et al. 2019).
4.2
Application of Biochar as Catalysts
4.2.1
Biochar-Based Photocatalysts
Photocatalysis has emerged into an efﬁcient and viable technique for puriﬁcation of
wastewater. Various nanoparticles such as TiO2, RuO2, SiO2, ZrO2, ZnO, CdS, and
ZnS have been used as semiconductor photocatalysts (Mian and Liu 2018). Despite
the excellent functionality, high photostability, and nontoxicity properties, the quick

+ and biochar (Cai et al. 2016)

S. Wang et al.

recombination of hole-electron pairs and poor visible-light response limit the
photocatalytic performance of semiconductors (Cui et al. 2020; Shaban et al. 2016).
To date, considerable attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic
ability using TiO2 modiﬁcation. In the beginning, metal or metal oxides were used to
dope TiO2 to lower the bandgap energy and motivate the visible-light response.
However, metal-based doping photocatalysts increase the carrier recombination rate,
induce the photo-corrosion and secondary pollution, and are subject to poor thermal
stability (Choi et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2015). The high price also hinders its wide
application under visible light. In 2001, Asahi (Asahi et al. 2001) ﬁrst synthesized a
nonmetal-semiconductor composite by doping nitrogen. Nitrogen can extend the
optical absorption spectra of TiO2 to 500 nm without reducing ultraviolet light.
Subsequently, researchers began to study various nonmetal-based photocatalysts
(Devi and Kavitha 2013, 2014). Doping of semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO,
ZrO2) with nonmetals such as C, S, N, B, F, and P helped to improve the
photocatalytic efﬁciency. Moreover, nonmetals could extend the visible region
absorption close to the edge of the valence band, which is more advantageous than
metal in improving the visible-light response (Cui et al. 2020; Lai et al. 2010; Mian
and Liu 2018).
Among them, combining semiconductors with carbonaceous nanomaterials has
been increasingly investigated due to their tunable structural, electrical properties, a
wide range of visible-light absorption, and enhanced electronic conductivity (Zhang
et al. 2015). Khan et al. (2002) ﬁrst achieved the doping of carbon in the natural gas
ﬂame by heating the Ti metal. It signiﬁcantly changed the absorption characteristics
of the catalyst to visible light. Its photoelectric conversion efﬁciency can reach
8.35%, compared with that of pure TiO2 (1.08%). Sakthivel et al. (Sakthivel and
Kisch 2003) found that the photocatalytic effect of carbon doping was ﬁve times
higher than that of nitrogen-doped samples. Chen et al. (2007) compared the
photocatalytic activities of carbon- and nitrogen-doped TiO2 samples under
visible-light irradiation. They suggested the higher photocatalytic activity was due
to the synergistic effect of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Wang and Lewis (2005)
theoretical calculation results demonstrated the forbidden bandgap of C-TiO2 was
narrowed down to 2.35 eV. They proposed that the introduction of carbon can
narrow the bandgap, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. However, the
widespread application of carbon-based photocatalysts was most limited because of
the high price and complicated fabrication methods of these materials. Thus, the
development of cheap, sustainable, and efﬁcient photocatalysts will be of great
interest (Cui et al. 2020).
In comparison with most conventional activated carbon, biochar possesses a well-
developed mesoporous structure and abundant surface functional groups. Further-
more, it can be served as a versatile catalyst or catalyst support (Colmenares et al.
2016). In recent years, biochar-based photocatalysts (BCPs) have received great
attention in various environmental ﬁelds. Some of those recently reported BCPs
were TiO2-coconut shell, TiO2-Salvinia molesta, TiO2-reed straw, TiO2-ramie char,
TiO2-corn cob, TiO2-paper sludge and wheat husks, TiO2-bamboo, ZnO-waste
biomass, g-C3N4/FeVO4

(Cui et al. 2020).
4.2.2
Fe/Biochar (Fe-BC) Catalysts
Fe-based biochar composites (Fe-BC) are promising catalysts for generating reactive
oxygen species (ROS) for environmental remediation considering their low costs
and excellent physicochemical surface characteristics. Various methods have been
used to prepare Fe-BC composites, and the synthetic methods and conditions used
affect the properties of the Fe-BC material, thereby inﬂuencing its pollutant removal
performance. The mechanisms of pollutant removal by Fe-BC are intricate and
include adsorption, degradation, and reduction. Fe loading on BC could improve
the performance of BC by affecting its surface area, surface functional groups, and
electron-transfer rate (Li et al. 2021). To date, several methods have been employed
to prepare Fe-BC from different feedstocks. Among them, impregnation-pyrolysis,
coprecipitation, hydrothermal carbonization, and ball milling are the four most
commonly used technologies among the methods reported (Li et al. 2021).
Since they are efﬁcient, economical, and environmentally friendly catalysts,
Fe-BC composites have been extensively used for removing organic pollutants,
including decabromodiphenyl ether, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, trichlorobenzene, and
4-nonylphenol from wastewater (Li et al. 2021). Fe-BC catalysts can also be applied
for the reduction of inorganic pollutants, reducing their toxicity. To enhance the
feasibility of Fe-BC composites, it is extremely important to clarify the mechanism
of the removal process. Loading iron species would change the properties of BC,
such as their speciﬁc surface area, porous structure, surface functional groups, and
defect degrees. On the other hand, Fe species could offer high reduction reactivity,
make them effective coprecipitation precursors, and provide high electron-transfer
capability. Moreover, the mechanisms might also be correlated with the properties of
the contaminants. Thus, the mechanisms of pollutant removal by Fe-BC composites
are usually complicated.
4.2.2.1 Adsorption
Due to its large speciﬁc surface area, Fe-BC could remove contaminants by adsorp-
tion. The adsorption mechanisms involved different interactions, including electro-
static interactions, hydrophobic effects, π-π interactions, hydrogen bonds, and pore
ﬁlling (Wu et al. 2017). It was found that the removal efﬁciency of pollutants by the
Ag/Fe/MB system was higher than those of other systems (OB, Ag/Fe, Ag/Fe/OB,
and MB) (Wu et al. 2017). This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that the
adsorption capacity of MB enhanced the contact between the pollutants and Ag/Fe
nanoparticles, and the simultaneous reduction released surface sites previously
occupied by pollutants to promote further adsorption. Ahmed et al. produced
nZVI-BC composites and used them to remove chloramphenicol. The results
veriﬁed that chloramphenicol was simultaneously reduced and adsorbed by nZVI-
BC and that sorption was the predominant mechanism (Ahmed et al. 2017). The
80
S. Wang et al.

removal of BPA by BC was investigated and found that no depletion of BPA was
observed (Diao et al. 2020; Li et al. 2021).
4.2.2.2 Reduction
Reduction is another mechanism of pollutant removal by Fe-BC. Owing to the
presence of Fe0, Fe(II), and S(II), Fe-BC has redox properties. S-nZVI/BC
composites were used for tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) removal. A portion of
the TBBPA was removed through reduction debromination by S-Fe0, and bisphenol
A and monobromobisphenol A, which were the reduction products of TBBPA, were
detected. The reduction was signiﬁcantly enhanced by the loading Fe and
S. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) were removed from
water by Fe0-containing BC, which could reduce the pollutants. The presence of
BC promoted the reductive transformations of DNT and DCP in the Fe0-included
BC system. The reduction of nitrobenzene (NB) was carried out by modiﬁed
BC-supported sulﬁdated nano-zerovalent iron (S-nZVI@HCl-BC), and the results
showed that S-nZVI@HCl-BC had excellent performance in reducing NB to aniline
(AN), a less toxic reduction product (Zhang et al. 2019a). In addition, surface
functional groups such as C–O, C–O–C, and O–C–O bonds were important redox-
active moieties for pollutants reduction. Fe-BC has been proven to reduce Cr
(VI) and TCE due to its abundant carboxyl groups and aliphatic carbon (Liu et al.
2019; Zhang et al. 2020c).
Moreover, PFRs in biochar were another redox-active moiety to stimulate the
reduction of pollutants through electron donation. Researchers found that Fe species
promoted the electron transfer to pollutants via the formation of PFRs. PFRs reduced
Fe(III) into Fe(II) and consequently facilitated the reduction of pollutants (Li et al.
2021; Wang et al. 2020c; Zhang and Lu 2018).
Fe-BC catalysts have been widely applied in redox systems. The removal
efﬁciencies of the contaminants were signiﬁcantly higher with BC-coated Fe(0).
BC-coated Fe(0) acted as an electron-transfer mediator in the reductive transforma-
tion, and the surface functional groups of BC could enhance the catalytic electron
transfer. It was found that the removal efﬁciency of Cr(VI) by the ZVI/PC system
was more than four times greater than that of Cr(IV) by the pristine PC and ZVI
systems, and ZVI was an important reductive active site for Cr(IV) removal (Zhao
et al. 2020). Ni/Fe nanoparticles supported by BC were successfully synthesized,
and the removal efﬁciency of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) was 99.3% under
the optimal conditions. The main mechanism of 1,1,1-TCA degradation is the
reduction of hydrogen atoms produced by ZVI corrosion. Therefore, Fe-BC
composites can be used as efﬁcient and cost-effective catalysts for the removal of
redox-sensitive pollutants (Li et al. 2017b, 2021).
4.2.2.3 Degradation
ROS (e.g., OH, O2, SO4, 1O2) could be generated in Fe-BC catalysis processes,
which, along with electron transfer, are responsible for the degradation of organic
pollutants. Fe species (ZVI, iron oxides, and iron sulﬁdes) can not only activate PDS,
PMS, H2O2, and O2 to produce ROS but could also be used as electron donors to
4
Application of Biochar for Wastewater Treatment
81

degrade pollutants. Fe-BC materials activate oxidants in the following ways:
(1) through the OFGs and PFRs on the surface of Fe-BC, (2) through defects in
the Fe-BC, and (3) as an electron-transfer mediator between oxidants and targeted
pollutants. The degradation mechanisms of pollutants by Fe-BC mainly involved
Fenton-like and photocatalytic process (Li et al. 2020a; Tao et al. 2019).
Numerous researchers found that Fe-BC can be used as catalyst for H2O2 activa-
tion. For example, Yi et al. (Yi et al. 2020) developed an approach to produce
magnetic BC composites (SMBC300, SMBC400, and SMBC500) at various
temperatures (300 C, 400 C, and 500 C), which were used to activate H2O2.
SMBC400 had good H2O2 activation and metronidazole (MNZ) degradation
properties. The results of EPR and free radical quenching showed that all three
materials could activate H2O2 to produce OH and O2
 and that surface-bound OH
played a pivotal role in MNZ degradation. Zhang et al. (2020a) synthesized
Fe-impregnated BC (FBC) by impregnation-pyrolysis. FBC was used to activate
H2O2 for SMX degradation, and the mechanism suggested that C–OH would
activate H2O2 to generate OH, which cooperated with nonradical sites to attack
SMX. Rubeena et al. prepared iron-loaded rice husk BC (Fe-RHB) and coir pith BC
(Fe-CPB) to activate H2O2 for acid red 1 (AR1) removal (Rubeena et al. 2018). It
was found that FeOOH, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 were formed on the surface of BC. The
removal efﬁciencies of AR1 and TOC were 97.6% and 84.2% in the Fe-RHB/H2O2
system and 99.1% and 86.7% in the Fe-CPB/H2O2 system, respectively. Both Fe-BC
composites also displayed favorable stability and reusability with very little iron
leaching. Zhang et al. prepared magnetite BC (SMBC) to activate H2O2 for aniline
degradation (Zhang et al. 2019b). They veriﬁed that OH and O2
 both contributed
to aniline degradation, indicating that BC in SBMC could mediate ROS generation
by Fe3O4. Moreover, a conventional one-step pyrolysis method to prepare
functionalized biochar (Fe2O3/TiO2-BC) was investigated, and results indicate that
it provides great potential for removing dye pollutants from water in a Fenton-like
system (Chen et al. 2020). Figure 4.4 describes the possible mechanism of Fenton
process of Fe2O3/TiO2-BC. Fe2O3/TiO2-BC exhibits outstanding performance for

et al. 2020)

the degradation of dye pollutants, and the TOC removal efﬁciencies reached above
65%. The combination of Fe2O3/TiO2 and BC could accelerate the activation of
H2O2 to generate OH. The mechanisms of dye pollutant removal were sorption and
catalytic processes; adsorption is attributed to the material’s abundant channels and
pores, and the catalytic process is due to the presence of π-π interactions, ionic
bonding, and H-bonding between the pollutants and Fe2O3/TiO2-BC (Li et al. 2021).
Compared to OH, SO4
 possesses higher oxidative potential, a wider operative
pH range, and a longer lifetime, and it was applied for the oxidation of organic
contaminants. An increasing number of researchers have focused on the activation of
PDS or PMS via Fe-BC composites. Rong et al. applied magnetic B (γ-Fe2O3@BC)
derived from banana peel to active PDS (Rong et al. 2019). Figure 4.5 explains the
possible mechanism of persulfate activation by γ-Fe2O3@BC for BPA degradation.
There are more active sites, including OFGs, on iron oxides and doped nitrogen in
γ-Fe2O3@BC, which contributed to bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. In addition,
they found that the signal intensity of the DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra in the
γ-Fe2O3@BC system was stronger than those in the PS, γ-Fe2O3@BC, and BC/PDS
systems. Noticeably, within 20 min, BPA (20 mg/L) was completely removed, and
the mineralization efﬁciency was approximately 90% in the γ-Fe2O3@BC/PS sys-
tem without pH adjustment. The Fe@HC-800 catalyst also exhibited stable perfor-
mance after three cycles of regeneration.
Radical scavengers were used to determine which reactive species were respon-
sible for contaminant degradation. Li et al. reported the degradation of TCE by the
nZVI-BC/PMS system. The degradation efﬁciency of TCE (0.1 mM) was 100% in
20 min (5 mM PMS, Fe-CB600 1 g/L, bicarbonate buffer solution at pH 8.2) under
groundwater conditions (Li et al. 2020b). They proved that OH, SO4
, O2
, and
1O2 were responsible for TCE degradation. O2
 and 1O2 mediated by Fe0 and OFGs
played major roles in TEC degradation. Wang et al. studied the removal of phenolic
contaminants via PMS activation with magnetic Fe,N-codoped carbon catalysts

et al. 2019)

(UBC-x), and the results showed that the UBC-x/PMS system could almost
completely remove phenolic contaminants under a wide pH range (2–11) (Wang
et al. 2020b).
1O2 was the dominant ROS for the degradation of phenolic
contaminants, and the catalytic activity of UBC-x could be enhanced by loading
Fe and N active sites. Jiang et al. quantiﬁed the contributions of SO4
2, the
nonradical pathway, and absorption for BPA degradation in the Fe-BC/PMS process
(Jiang et al. 2019). Under the optimal conditions, degradation reached 53%, and of
that, SO4
2 degradation accounted for 23%, the nonradical pathway accounted for
30%, and the other 47% was attributed to adsorption.

Conclusion and Future Outlook
As a green, environmentally friendly, cheap, and easy-to-obtain new functional
material, biochar has unique structural advantages such as large speciﬁc surface
area, dense pore structure, wide sources, environmental friendliness, rich oxygen-
containing functional groups, and good adsorption characteristics and is used for
sewage treatment. Future research on the application of biochar in wastewater
treatment should focus on the following issues.
1. The current research on biochar in related ﬁelds is mainly concentrated in the
laboratory test stage, which lacks a systematic theoretical basis. In the actual
operation and application process, there are harsh production conditions, the
production process is not easy to realize, and the cost is high, and the production
process is difﬁcult to promote on a large scale, thereby restricting the large-scale
preparation and use of biochar. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out further
experiments to promote its practical application and pay attention to its long-term
stability in the environment.
2. Strengthen research on the potential hazards of biochar materials; while paying
attention to and studying the advantages of biochar/modiﬁed biochar, it is
necessary to pay attention to its negative effects. Both biochar and its modiﬁed
products are derived from biomass residues (including primary agricultural and
forestry production residues, agricultural and forestry secondary residues,
bio-utilization and transformation wastes, etc.). In the process of biomass
processing, substances harmful to the environment (organic, inorganic, and
heavy metals) may be released. At the same time, biological carbon and its
modiﬁed products are a kind of nanoparticles, and their release may also cause
potential harm to the environment and ecology. In addition, biochar and its
modiﬁed materials still have the risk of secondary pollution after the pollutants
are treated. The recycling of waste should avoid the diffusion and release of
pollutants. Therefore, the harmlessness of biochar materials should be strength-
ened in subsequent research. Especially during chemical treatment of biochar, its
environmental hazard monitoring, and analysis etc.
3. Activated carbon has become an indispensable and important means in water
treatment technology. The treatment technology has changed from single
84
S. Wang et al.

activated carbon adsorption to the combined application of multiple treatment
methods such as adsorption reduction, catalytic oxidation, electrolysis, and bio-
degradation. According to the water quality of the treated water source, selecting
appropriate activated carbon or modiﬁed activated carbon combined with other
water treatment technologies can often achieve better treatment effects than the
combined effects of various single methods. However, the current various
activated carbon treatment technologies are not very complete. Although some
have improved the removal rate of pollutants, the process is complicated, and the
economic beneﬁts are poor, making it difﬁcult to promote and apply. Therefore,
in the future, the research direction of activated carbon should be comprehen-
sively considered from reducing costs, improving efﬁciency, and simplifying
operations to achieve the unity of environmental and economic beneﬁts.
4. The research on biochar has not formed a complete system and standard, and the
adsorption and ﬁxation capacity of biochar is affected by many factors. There-
fore, it is difﬁcult for many studies to conduct systematic comparative analysis, so
in the future, we need to pay attention to the formulation of biochar-related
standards.

Abstract
The generation of efﬂuents in industrial processes is a constant problem that
accompanies economic development and population growth. Most of these
efﬂuents have in their composition high concentrations of organic compounds
and heavy metals, among other substances that are harmful to the environment.
The treatment and ﬁnal disposal of these wastes become a problem for many
industries due to these processes’ complexity and costs. Seeking to solve this
problem effectively and economically, different techniques have been developed.
The synergistic approach involving microbial action and biochar is one of these
techniques and stands out for being potentially efﬁcient, of low cost, and environ-
mentally friendly. The metabolic diversity of microorganisms, combined with the
biochar’s adsorption capacity, ensures effectiveness in different efﬂuent bioreme-
diation types. Thus, this chapter will address information on microorganisms used
in conjunction with the biochar in the bioremediation of efﬂuents generated in
industrial processes.

problems. The generation of efﬂuents from the most diverse industrial processes
stands out due to the signiﬁcant deterioration that has been caused to water
resources. According to the United Nations reports World Water Development, it
is estimated that approximately 80% of industrial and domestic efﬂuents generated
in several countries are released into the untreated environment (Water UN 2018).
Therefore, research that seeks efﬁcient and cheap technologies to treat industrial and
urban wastewater is necessary.
Bioremediation is a promising treatment method in which microorganisms are
used to reduce contaminants. This process has been intensively researched and
recommended by the scientiﬁc community as an ecologically suitable, sufﬁcient,
and inexpensive alternative for treating organic and inorganic pollutants present in
soil and water (Huang et al. 2019).
However, the application of microorganisms in bioremediation is often limited by
substrate inhibition and concentration of constituents (Zhuang et al. 2015; Lou et al.
2019). When exposed to highly heterogeneous environments with large loads of
contaminants, microorganisms perform poorly since these compounds inhibit their
activity (Biswas et al. 2015; Enaime et al. 2020). Thus, different approaches are
being tested, seeking to stabilize these processes, such as biochar’s combined use
with microorganisms.
Biochar has been standing out as an adsorbent and immobilizer due to its
characteristics such as porosity, stability, and bioavailability, which help metabolism
and microbial growth. Another way to apply biochar in bioremediation processes is
to add it to reactors as a buffer since alkaline/neutral characteristics prevent the
acidiﬁcation of the medium (Enaime et al. 2020; Pokharel et al. 2020).
However, the possible adverse effects of using biochar-microorganisms must be
taken into account. The biochar’s strong afﬁnity for contaminants can decrease its
bioavailability for microorganisms. Also, few studies in the literature portray how
the biochar’s complex characteristics impact the biodegradation of pollutants. There-
fore, there is much to be investigated about its use in wastewater treatment (Zhao
et al. 2020).
Considering the search for efﬁcient and economical treatment processes, this
chapter will present information on the main methods used in applying biochar-
microorganisms. Studies reported in the literature on efﬂuents in which these
techniques have already been applied will be discussed, gathering relevant informa-
tion to apply these approaches in the new research.

5.2
Mechanisms of Biochar-Microorganism Interaction During
Contaminants Degradation
The application of biochar in a synergistic way with microorganisms in the treatment
of efﬂuents can occur through mechanisms of adsorption, buffering, and immobili-
zation of microbial cells. The application of these mechanisms can increase the
efﬁciency of treatments and provide, in some instances, the recovery of value-added
by-products present in the efﬂuent (Pokharel et al. 2020). The following sections will
discuss how to apply these mechanisms and how processes are affected by this
approach.
5.2.1
Immobilization of Microbial Cells
Immobilization consists of the physical retention of cells in a deﬁned region, in
which biological activities are maintained, allowing for a higher rate of cell multi-
plication (Karel et al. 1985). The higher concentration of microbial cells in the
support allows an increase in the efﬁciency of removing pollutants. Also, it
facilitates the reuse of inoculated supports and provides more resistance to
microorganisms in the face of toxic components present in the efﬂuent (Mollaei
et al. 2010; Lou et al. 2019).
The support used in cell immobilization must have unique characteristics to be
considered adequate. Among these characteristics are low toxicity to cells, chemical
stability, and high mechanical resistance, in addition to good mass transfer perfor-
mance (Chen et al. 2012).
Biochar has stood out as efﬁcient support due to its good physical and chemical
properties and its cost-beneﬁt, since it can be produced from several sources, such as
agro-industrial waste (Lou et al. 2019). Table 5.1 gathers some studies in which this
technique was applied to remediate pollutants, showing its removal efﬁciency.
One of the techniques used to immobilize cells in the biochar is through absorp-
tion. In the studies by Lou et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020), a cell suspension was
added over the biochar, and then the mixture of cell suspension and biochar was
stirred on a rotary shaker until the cells were adsorbed on the surface and pores of the
biochar, thus forming an immobilized bioﬁlm. The time in which the mixture
remained stirred in the two studies was 24 h, with a temperature of 30 C. Lou
et al. (2019) applied a 150 rpm agitation in his experiment and Zhang et al. (2020)
160 rpm.
5.2.2
Adsorption of Inhibitors
The adsorption capacity of the biochar enables a higher rate of microbial growth in
bioremediation processes. The transformation of pollutants from the soluble state to
the state adsorbed on the biochar’s surface can decrease its toxic inhibition to
microorganisms (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c).

Lou et al. (2015) investigated how the application of biochar affects the
adsorption-biodegradation of nonylphenol. The biochar used in this study is derived
from rice straw and was applied as an adsorbent. The results showed that approxi-
mately 47.6% of the nonylphenol was biodegraded in 2 days, representing a 125%
increase in degradation compared to the experiment in which the biochar was not
added.
In the study by Zhao et al. (2020), the biochar produced pyrolytically from peanut
shells was applied together with the bacterium Pseudomonas citronellolis in the
biodegradation of wastewater that has high concentrations of phenol. According to
the authors, phenol’s initial adsorption by biochar alleviated the toxicity of phenol to
the bacterium. Then, the slow release of phenol in the aqueous medium controlled its
bioavailability. This mechanism resulted in a high efﬁciency of removing the
compound, which increased from less than 46% when the biochar was not added
to up to 99% in the highest concentrations evaluated.
However, this mechanism can promote adverse effects, as shown in the study Xin
et al. (2014), where there was a reduction of approximately 90% in the efﬁciency of
removing ether when adding the biochar in the process. The authors raised the
hypothesis that the slow desorption of this substance by biochar may be one of the
factors responsible for decreasing the rate of degradation.

inhibited PCP biodegradation due to a strong sorption afﬁnity with PCP, reducing
the compound’s bioavailability for microbes.
These studies show that biochar can cause positive and negative effects on its
adsorption mechanism applied to the degradation of pollutants, requiring further
investigation to be done regarding the relationship between the adsorbed pollutants
and microbes.
5.2.3
Increasing Buffering Capacity
The biochar can be alkaline depending on the biomass source. The alkaline charac-
teristic is mainly related to inorganic minerals and ash formed during pyrolysis and
carbonization, present in its composition (Yuan et al. 2011). Due to this characteris-
tic, the biochar is added to biological waste and efﬂuent treatment processes to
promote a buffering effect, avoiding acidiﬁcation of the medium. Also, the cost of
using biochar as a buffer in these processes is more economical when compared to
other buffering agents used, such as CaCO3 and NaHCO3 (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c).
The use of biochar to increase buffering capacity is not well known; however,
some studies such as that of Luo et al. (2015) show that the application of biochar in
anaerobic digestion reactors causes a reduction in the acidiﬁcation of the medium,
providing an increase in the production of bioproducts such as methane (86.6%).
Shen et al. (2015) report that the addition of biochar increased the medium’s
alkalinity and attenuated the inhibition of ammonia, providing stability in the
anaerobic digestion process of wastewater sludge.

5.3
Biochar and Microorganisms in the Treatment of Industrial
Effluents
Industries such as textiles, leather tanning, and thermoelectric and oil reﬁneries, of
extreme importance for the economic sector, are sources of efﬂuents with high loads
of paints, heavy metals, and other chemical substances, such as hydrocarbons, which
cause signiﬁcant damage to the environment if the efﬂuent is not treated correctly.
Alternatives that aim to reduce chemical substances in the treatment of these
efﬂuents are very desirable. Among them is the use of biochar and microorganisms.
Biochar, best known for its application in soil correction, has shown, through
studies, several other forms of use, mainly in the environmental area, such as in
the treatment of efﬂuents, due to the improvement of its properties over the years
(Sanroman et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2020a, b, c).
Because it is a product resulting from vegetable biomass residues, such as corn
cobs, coconut husks, and characteristic properties that deﬁne it, it may vary
depending on the biomass used, being neutral/alkaline pH, aromatic carbon chains,
porosity, cation exchange capacity, and its high nutritional value (Karim et al. 2019),
in addition to the low cost concerning the use of chemical substances in the treatment
of efﬂuents.
In addition to biochar, as previously mentioned, many studies have used
microorganisms to treat efﬂuents since, when discarded without treatment, they
can cause damage to health and the environment (Bhattacharjee et al. 2020).
This topic addresses the application of biochar and microorganisms in treating
industrial efﬂuents, such as those of the textile, tannery, thermoelectric, and oil
reﬁneries industries, which are described below.
5.3.1
Textile Industry Effluents
The textile industries are considered enterprises that are highly impactful for the
environment due to their transformation processes using large amounts of water,
reaching 200 L/kg of fabric (Ghaly et al. 2014). These processes range from
degumming with enzymes to bleaching and neutralizing the fabric for dyeing it
(Ntuli et al. 2009). At the end of these processes, the water used has many chemicals
such as dyes, phenols, and other highly toxic substances to the environment (Ghaly
et al. 2014; Bhattacharjee et al. 2020).
According to Ghaly et al. (2014), some dyes have organic substances that are
difﬁcult to break down, requiring microorganisms that are following the composition
of the efﬂuent, which can be isolated from areas contaminated by these pollutants
found in the efﬂuents (Bhattacharjee et al. 2020).
Bharti et al. (2019) used the biosorption technique, using biochar as a packaging
medium for immobilizing bacteria, in the biodegradation of methylene blue dye,
widely used in textile industries. In this study, the authors isolated Alcaligenes
faecalis from a river near a textile industry in India and used it in consortium with
the biochar from the seed from Casuarina equisetifolia.
96
T. R. C. Souza et al.

The use of biochar as a means of packaging for the immobilization of Alcaligenes
faecalis in a packed bed bioreactor resulted in a removal of 81.5% and 89.1% for free
and immobilized cells of Alcaligenes faecalis, respectively (Bharti et al. 2019).
Talha et al. (2018) applied biochar from coconut shell and the bacterium
Brevibacillus parabrevis, isolated from a river near a textile industry in India, in
the bioremediation of Congo red dye using a packaged bed bioreactor. In that study,
the authors used the biochar to immobilize Brevibacillus parabrevis. When carrying
out the research, they obtained a 65.95% dye removal at 100 mg/L for free cells and
63.23% at 300 mg/L for the cells immobilized with biochar, in batch tests ranging
from 50 to 500 mg/L (Talha et al. 2018).
When performing the continuous test, increasing the concentration and varying
from 100 to 500 ppm, B. parabrevis cells immobilized with biochar were also more
effective, reaching a degradation of 88.92% of the dye. In contrast, free cells
degraded only 77.82% (Talha et al. 2018).
Other studies that used a continuous process packed bed bioreactor to remove
dyes also demonstrated effectiveness in this procedure, such as the study by Giri
et al. (2020), which also used Brevibacillus parabrevis, isolated from efﬂuent, and
biochar from ears of corn for the removal of bright green dye from efﬂuent. As a
result, Giri et al. (2020) removed approximately 90% of the dye for concentrations of
50, 100, 400, and 500 mg/L in 5 days.
Raj et al. (2021), on the other hand, carried out a study using a strain of the
bacterium Escherichia fergusonii and activated carbon from rice husk, with the
bacterium being evaluated for color removal (reaching 98%) and reduction of total
dissolved solids (reaching 75%) (Raj et al. 2021). When using activated carbon, after
treating the efﬂuent with E. fergusonii, there was a reduction in chemical and
biochemical oxygen demand (reaching 92.5% and 85%, respectively) (Raj et al.
2021).
As can be seen in the studies mentioned above, the use of biochar and
microorganisms in the treatment of efﬂuents and dyes used in textile industries
showed the efﬁciency of these processes, resulting in removals of approximately
92%. This is since biochar and microorganisms have the sorption mechanism.
Hence, the combination of both enhances this mechanism since adsorption is an
effective method for removing these contaminants and is environmentally friendly
and of low cost (Giri et al. 2017; Weng et al. 2009).
5.3.2
Petroleum Refinery Wastewater
Oil reﬁneries are major environmental polluters and generate high volumes of
wastewater in their production process. These efﬂuents are composed of complex
elements such as hydrocarbons and naphthenic acid, which often have high toxicity
and low biodegradability (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c).
Some technologies currently used in treating wastewater from oil reﬁneries
consist of biological treatments such as activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge
(Wang et al. 2016). The use of biochar to stabilize these biological processes is a
5

97

promising technique. Wang et al. (2020a, b, c) added biochar produced from waste
oil-activated sludge in the reﬁnery wastewater treatment process. According to the
authors, the addition of biochar increased the removal efﬁciency of organic
compounds (3%), oil (4%), and total nitrogen (10%). Wang et al. (2020a, b, c)
explain that the porous structure and the high degree of hydrophilicity of the biochar
facilitated colonization and microbial adhesion, providing the formation of more
substantial and stable aerobic granules.
Ming et al. (2020) investigated the effect of adding different biochars on the
aerobic granulation process of reﬁnery efﬂuent. The biochar was produced from rice
bran (biochar-rb), rice husk (biochar-rh), and nutshell (biochar-ws). According to the
authors, the addition of biochar reduced aerobic granulation time in 15 days com-
pared to the control. It increased the efﬁciency of removing chemical oxygen
demand (COD) by 3.2–5.1% and nitrogen total (10–13%).
This study also shows how the physicochemical properties of different biochars
inﬂuence aerobic systems of granular sludge. According to the authors, the reactor
containing biochar-rb was the most stable and removed most of the nutrients, and the
reactor containing biochar-rb had the largest granule size (Ming et al. 2020).
The results of these studies indicate that the use of biochar in aerobic granulation
processes in the treatment of wastewater from an oil reﬁnery is an efﬁcient and viable
option; however, research in this area is still scarce, so further research is needed.
5.3.3
Tannery Wastewater
The tannery industry has a vast movement of products and goods worldwide,
producing tons of leather per year (Saxena et al. 2020). To obtain the ﬁnal product,
leather undergoes treatment. It receives approximately 170 types of chemicals, such
as acids, chromium salt, solvents, and dyes, thus generating many efﬂuents with high
concentrations of toxic compounds (Hansen et al. 2020; Cassano et al. 2001).
The pretreatment of the tannery efﬂuent consists of two processes. The ﬁrst
treatment is done with oxidation, separation of solids, and precipitation of chromium
(Di Iaconi 2012), and the second treatment is given by activated sludge systems,
generating a large amount of sludge that will need to undergo a new treatment (Dotro
et al. 2011; Cassano et al. 2001). Microalgae in the bioremediation of this activated
sludge is a promising technique that is gaining more and more attention because it
can reduce concentrations of inorganic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and
reduce the concentrations of dissolved heavy metals. However, tannery efﬂuents
can inhibit the growth of microorganisms due to the presence of toxic compounds,
especially chromium (Sforza et al. 2020).
Seeking improvements in this process, Sforza et al. (2020) evaluated the combi-
nation of the application of biochar and the cultivation of microalgae to treat tannery
efﬂuents. The authors tested two different biochar types: pine biochar (PB) and
commercial one (CB). The biochar was applied as a pretreatment step before the
cultivation of Chlorella protothecoides, resulting in a signiﬁcant increase in the
growth rates of microalgae (61% and 126% for PB and CB, respectively).
98
T. R. C. Souza et al.

Chromium is a signiﬁcant pollutant in wastewater from the leather processing
industry. Mahmood et al. (2015) combined the use of biochar produced from corn
cobs’ pyrolysis with a strain of Pseudomonas putida KI in a bioreactor to treat
simulated tannery wastewater, containing azo dye Black-5 and hexavalent chro-
mium (CrVI). The results of this study showed that Reactive Black-5 completely
biodegraded in 5 h. The KI strain also reduced the CrVI concentration from 100 to
10 mg/L in 24 h.
Another toxic component present in tannery wastewater is dye. Ortiz-Monsalve
et al. (2020) investigated in their study the combined treatment of adsorption in
woodchip biochar and biodegradation under solid-state fermentation by Trametes
villosa in the removal of the acid blue leather 161 dye from wastewater.
The authors tested biochar as an adsorbent and as a basis for immobilization and
growth of Trametes villosa. After 15 days, this fungus showed a growth rate of
86.8  0.8%, in addition to biodegrading 91.4  1.3% of the adsorbed dye.
These studies clearly illustrate the feasibility of using microbiological strains
combined with biochar for the biological treatment of tannery wastewater as a
support matrix for microbial cells.
5.3.4
Effluents from Thermal Power Plants
The increase in the world population and the need for mass production of energy
have led to a search for alternative sources due to the scarcity of fossil fuels. The
generation through thermal plants appears with great potential for large-scale pro-
duction and means to reuse some organic waste. In addition to organic energy
production, nuclear plants have a high potential for energy production through
uranium, showing efﬁciency for generating large amounts of energy through nuclear
reactions. In contrast, the waste generated by this activity causes severe environ-
mental problems due to its radioactivity and toxicity (Ying et al. 2020).
Uranium is one of the main toxic components found in this industry’s wastewater.
Several methods are studied to remove uranium ions, such as surface precipitation,
sorption, solidiﬁcation, ion exchange, photocatalysis, ﬁltration, and membrane ﬁl-
tration (Li et al. 2018).
Studies like the one by Ding et al. (2018) show that microorganisms are also
gaining space in the uranium remediation in aerobic media when combined with
biochar to synthesize compounds to increase the stability of the adsorption process.
After evaluating eight species, the strains of Leifsonia sp. showed the best removal
with 68%. When pH adjustment ranges from 2.5 to 7.5, the adsorption in aqueous
phase with pH 3.5 was carried out, and it was possible to obtain 99.59% U
(VI) adsorption.
Biosorption using macroalgae is a promising technology for the bioremediation
of industrial efﬂuents, as shown by the study by Kidgell et al. (2014), where the
efﬁciency in removing pollutants from industrial efﬂuent from a coal-ﬁred power
station was investigated, using macroalgae biomass in the production of biochar.
The biosorbents were produced from the macroalgae Oedogonium sp. (Chlorophyta)

99

and showed excellent removal of metals such as Al, Cd, Ni, and Zn, at pH-dependent
rates.
Studies regarding the remediation of residues from thermal plants such as ura-
nium are still scarce. Still, they are economically and environmentally viable in using
biochar combined with microorganisms, mainly in adsorption processes.
5.4
Biochar-Microorganisms in the Treatment of Industrial
Effluents and Energy Recovery
The wastewater generated in industrial processes is composed of several
biopolymers, such as starch, lignocellulose, glucose, protein, lactose, lipids, fats,
and minerals, which can be converted into sustainable biofuels and biocomposite
through their bioremediation followed by fermentation and anaerobic digestion
(Bhatia et al. 2020).
Anaerobic digestion is a technique that has stood out because it provides the
treatment of this material while it generates products with high-added value, such as
biomethane. However, this process is impaired due to the heterogeneous environ-
mental conditions that microorganisms face when coming into contact with these
efﬂuents. The use of biochar as a stabilizer of these processes has been investigated.
Torri and Fabbri (2014) applied biochar produced from corn stalk in the anaerobic
digestion of the efﬂuent generated in the biochar pyrolysis process (aqueous pyroly-
sis liquid, APL). The addition of biochar increased the methane yield by 65  5%
compared to the process where pure APL was used (34  6%) and improved the
reaction rate.
Shen et al. (2015) obtained a 27.6% increase in the maximum rate of methane
production by adding biochar wastewater sludge produced by corn straw to the
anaerobic digestion process. The addition of biochar also increased the medium’s
alkalinity and attenuated the inhibition of ammonia, providing stability in the
process.
Huggins et al. (2016) used the biochar-microorganism combination in a different
approach. The authors evaluated the biochar derived from residual wood as an
electrode in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). MFCs are bioreactors that convert chemical
energy
stored
in
biodegradable
materials
into
electrical
current
through
microorganisms’ metabolic activity (Logan et al. 2006).
Huggins et al. (2016) applied biochar electrodes to wastewater containing large
amounts of nutrients such as ammonia and phosphorus. The reductions in these
nutrients were 73% and 88%, respectively. The authors observed a stable energy
peak with a power density of 6 W/m3, showing the potential use of biochar as an
electrode in MFCs to treat wastewater and simultaneous energy production.
Other bioproducts can be generated from the anaerobic digestion of efﬂuents. The
inﬂuence of biochar on the production of volatile fatty acids (AGVs) from anaerobic
digestion of the tannery sludge supernatant was investigated by Zhai et al. (2020).
The biochar produced from the sludge decreased the concentration of ammoniacal
nitrogen, which caused a reduction in the inhibition of bacteria during anaerobic
100

digestion. The experimental results showed that the AGV yields improved in the
biochar presence, with a maximum yield of 1037.5 mg/g. According to the authors,
the recovered volatile fatty acids can be reused in water treatments.
The potential of the biochar-microorganism mechanism in the treatment and
energy recovery of industrial wastewater is high but still little explored. This
mechanism can be applied to obtain different bioproducts using different raw
materials, making these processes cheaper and more sustainable.
5.5
Challenges and Perspectives in the Use of Biochar
Associated with Microorganisms in the Treatment
of Industrial Effluents
One of the differential characteristics of biochar is that it is a promising material
derived from waste, which makes it a unique renewable resource, with the potential
for several environmental issues currently addressed, among them remediation of
pollutants in soil, water, and gaseous medium (Oliveira et al. 2017).
However, studies investigating the contribution of biochar to the bioremediation
of wastewater generated in industrial processes are still scarce. The inﬂuence of
different sources of raw material used in the production of biochar and physical-
chemical factors that affect the efﬁciency of removing contaminants are still in the
initial evaluation phase (Ambaye et al. 2020). Also, there is little knowledge about
what is degraded by bacteria and what is adsorbed by biochar (Wang et al.
2020a, b, c).
Investigations involving adsorption with biochar mostly focus on individual
pollutants or single groups of environmental contaminants. Studies that include
expanding knowledge about biochar’s adsorption capacity with multi-pollutants
(heavy metals present in efﬂuents) still need to be more widespread and applied
(Lyu et al. 2016).
The recovery and regeneration of biochar after pollutant adsorption is also an area
that needs more attention. Few studies are related to this critical topic since adsorbed
toxic and harmful substances can be effectively converted or solidiﬁed into potential
sources of pollution that not be released (Dai et al. 2019). According to Li et al.
(2019), the disposal of biomass polluted by toxic components such as heavy metals
obtained in bioremediation processes is a signiﬁcant challenge.
Also, the application of biochar in bioremediation was limited to the laboratory
scale. Studies that aim to use it on a large scale should be carried out and analyzed in
technical and economic aspects (Lyu et al. 2016). However, Dai et al. (2019)
highlight that the cost of production of biochar is still the main limiting factor for
its application in the ﬁeld and the selection of cheap raw materials for its production
and reuse methods.

Role of Biochar in the Removal of Organic
and Inorganic Contaminants from
Wastewater

A. M. Joe Cyril Harrish and Hitesh S. Pawar
Abstract
Biochar is a carbonaceous (C-65-90%) solid product which can be produced from
biomass as a result of thermal decomposition such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal
carbonization, gasiﬁcation, torrefaction, and rectiﬁcation where there is little or
no oxygen at all. The source of biomass is from a wide range of diverse organic
materials such as plant residue, sewage solids, poultry manure, human manure,
goat manure, agro-industrial biomass, etc. The characteristic physiochemical
properties provide a wide range of applications such as climatic change mitiga-
tion, carbon sink to reduce emission of greenhouse CO2, soil remediation, carbon
sequestration, wastewater treatment, etc. In the recent years, there are several
advance developments in the ﬁeld of water and wastewater treatment using
biochar as an adsorbent. Ideally, activated carbon is considered as a universal
adsorbent to remove dissolved contaminants from wastewater but the downside is
the high cost. Thus, researchers are directed toward replacement through biochar
to drop down the process cost and avail the speciﬁc characteristic properties of
biochar. Biochars have been reported to remove toxic metals, organic pollutants,
and nutrients by substituting them in wastewater as an adsorbent. Adsorption
capacities of the biochar in the removal of contaminants mainly depend on the
source of biomass and type of thermal decomposition employed for biochar
conversion as it directly affects its yield and its chemistry. However, biochar
can be a new remunerative and nature-friendly solution for the treatment of
wastewater. Thus, the present book chapter is mainly focused on the signiﬁcance
of biochar for treatment of wastewater. Various methodologies for biochar

Introduction
The quality of our life has been increasing day by day with the rapid growth of
industrial sectors and their economics. But along with that growth, there is
subsequent increase in environmental concerns. One such alarming concern can be
water pollution. Of the total water resource available, only a mere 0.14% is the total
water available for consumption. For the ever-growing population, the water scarcity
is increasing day by day and the demand for water increases by 1% every year. The
major cause of water pollution is due to the discharge of efﬂuents from various
industries into them without any prior treatment. In accordance to the reports of the
United Nations World Water Development, about 80% of municipal and industrial
wastewater were discharged into natural water bodies. The efﬂuents from these
industries contain a diverse range of inorganic and organic contaminants such as
organic molecules, toxic metal ions, dyes, and some cancer-causing carcinogens.
These contaminants are persistent in nature, are nonbiodegradable, and may easily
pass into food chain through bioaccumulation. To overcome water pollution and its
shortage, drastic measures were taken by the development of many effective water
treatment technologies such as membrane separation, adsorption, precipitation,
advanced oxidation process, ozonation, and biological treatment methods such as
aerobic and anaerobic digestion. Although these treatment methods may seem
effective, they are quite costly, and there arises a need to develop more remunerative
technologies. Activated carbon was often considered as the universal adsorbent for
the treatment of water. But employment of activated carbon in wastewater treatment
is very costly. So, the cost problem can be rectiﬁed by the employment of biochar as
it requires only less investment and on the other hand it reduces the cost of disposal
of the wastes from wide variety of sources, as biochar is derived from it (Huang et al.
2019).
Biochar is a charred organic matter also known as pyrogenic black carbon
generated by thermal carbonization of carbon-rich biomass in an environment
where the oxygen content is sparse [66]. Thermal carbonization at different
temperatures yields diverse range of biochar. In the recent decade, biochar has
attained remarkable attention owing to their multifunctional application in bioenergy
production, soil fertility, environmental remediation, climate change mitigation, and
carbon sequestration. The biomass feedstock can be of any organic materials such as
algal biomass, agri-residue, manure, activated sludge, and forest residues. The
interest in biochar is peaked due to two distinct beneﬁts. The ﬁrst one is that the
production of biochar decreases the greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere by
108

preserving the carbon in their stable form (Yang et al. 2018b; Creamer and Gao
2016). Secondly, biochar is a highly efﬁcient, remunerative, environmentally viable
adsorbent (Inyang et al. 2016; Cha et al. 2016), which has large surface area and
abundant surface functional groups. The biochar produced after-water treatment can
be applied to soils to remediate soil fertility, thus increasing the crop productivity.
The biochar’s physical and chemical properties are affected by the feedstock
characteristics, thermal carbonization method, operation temperature, and duration
of the carbonization. Naturally, after the thermal carbonization of the biomass, three
fractions are obtained. They are bio-oil, biochar, and syngas. The distribution of the
fraction depends on the thermal carbonization temperature. The biochar is graded
into three categories by the International Biochar Initiative based on their carbon
composition. They are Class I biochar which has carbon content above 60%, Class II
biochar containing carbon content between 30 and 60%, and Class III containing
carbon content below 30%.
6.2
Types of Thermal Carbonization Technologies
The biomass conversion to biochar by thermal process includes pyrolysis, hydro-
thermal
carbonization,
gasiﬁcation,
torrefaction,
and
rectiﬁcation.
The
abovementioned process of biomass feedstock yields biochar, syngas, and bio-oil
in different fractions based on the type of thermal carbonization.
Usually, there are pretreatment and posttreatment technologies that are employed
to further enhance the properties of the biochar. Some of them are pore volume,
speciﬁc surface area, surface chemistry, etc. Crushing, sieving, washing, and drying
come under physical pretreatment technologies. In chemical pretreatment technol-
ogy, the chemical precursors or functional agents are loaded into the biomass by
immersing them in chemical solution or colloidal suspension, for example, immers-
ing them in metal ions solutions such as AlCl3 and FeCl3, to convert them into
biochar-based nanocomposites. After immersing them in these, they are dried prior
to biochar production. Biological means include bacterial treatment, anaerobic
digestion, biofuel process, etc.
Post-treatment technologies physical and chemical modiﬁcations which include
ball milling and corrosive and magnetic treatment. Biochar is converted into mag-
netic particles in magnetization. For example, magnetic iron oxides are loaded into
biochar by immersing in aqueous solution. In ball milling, the kinetic energy breaks
the chemical bonds, changes the shape of particle, and ﬁnally produces them in the
range of nanoscale. Corrosive treatment includes acid, alkali, and oxidation treat-
ment and this treatment alters the surface chemistry of the biochar. Posttreatment of
biochar increases the speciﬁc surface area, negative zeta potential, pore volume,
surface functional groups, and adsorption capacity.

6.2.1
Pyrolysis
In this method, a thermal decomposition of biomass was condcuted for conversion
into biochar in hypoxic or anoxic environment without combustion. The yield of
biochar, composition, and physicochemical properties depend on the operating
parameters such as temperature, residence time, and heating rates. The increase in
biochar pyrolysis temperature decreases the biochar yield. Of all these parameters
mentioned above, the heating rate and the residence time distinguish this process into
conventional/slow pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis. The residence time is low, while the
heating rate is high for fast pyrolysis on comparison to slow pyrolysis.
In fast pyrolysis, biochar usually has volatiles, but degree of carbonization is low
indicating the presence of low ﬁxed carbon mass. Hence, the yield of the biochar is
low in fast pyrolysis which will be in the range of 10–20%, while the yield of biochar
is 30–60% in slow pyrolysis. In slow pyrolysis, the yield has equal composition of
biochar, bio-oil, and biogas which contradicts the fast pyrolysis process as the bio-oil
yield is quite high. The reduction in bio-oil yield in slow pyrolysis is due to the
cracking reaction. Biochar from fast pyrolysis usually consists of conjugated aro-
matic structures. The pyrolysis temperature is the main factor in affecting the
aromaticity and aromatic condensation of the biochar. At high temperature, the
hydrophobicity of the char is increased by the destruction of surface functional
groups. The biochar surface area along with the micropore structure increases with
increase in pyrolysis temperature. This is due to the devolatilization of the biomass.
But too high temperature can cause blockage of the pores and collapse of the
microstructure reducing the surface area. So, the recommended pyrolysis tempera-
ture is around 400–700 C.
The heating rate greatly affects the biochar yield. The low heating rate increases
the aromatic character and preserves the structural complexity. The high heating rate
yields a large number of liquid fractions reducing the biochar yield due to the
depolymerization of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose from the biomass, phase
transition, localized melting, and swelling of the cells.
A long residence time and low temperature are ideal for high biochar yield. This
long residence time increases the ﬁxed carbon content by increasing the degree of
carbonization (Mohan et al. 2006; Czernik and Bridgwater 2004).
6.2.2
Gasification
In gasiﬁcation, the thermal decomposition of biomass will be at very high tempera-
ture which yields less than 10% of biochar and the majority being syngas or biogas.
Partial combustion happens in gasiﬁcation. Usually, the biochars from pyrolysis are
fused rings. But the char from gasiﬁcation is highly condensed aromatic rings. The
chars obtained from gasiﬁcation are ﬁne powders. Aromaticity is less in comparison
to char from pyrolysis. The chars from gasiﬁcation contain alkaline earth minerals
and alkali salts in high amounts (Brewer et al. 2009).

6.2.3
Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC)
All the carbonization techniques discussed above are dry carbonization techniques,
so the biomass feed is usually dried before the carbonization techniques. The main
advantage of HTC is energy needed for drying is eliminated. In this method, wet
biomass is heated under pressure in a conﬁned space. The activation energy for HTC
is also quite low on comparison to the above-discussed techniques. Char obtained
from HTC is called hydrochar, which is a solid-water slurry and from this solid char
is separated. Hydrochar usually contains alkyl moieties and abundant acidic func-
tional groups, while the char from dry carbonization techniques consists of
aromatics. In HTC, the reaction temperature is the governing parameter (Libra
et al. 2011; Wiedner et al. 2013).
6.2.4
Torrefaction and Rectification
From the above processes, adsorbent chars can be generated. But this technique was
used just to increase the energy density by lessening the water content. This reduces
the transportation costs as it lessens the weight of the biomass and mainly prevents
the rot of the biomass. So adsorbent-based char cannot be generated in this technique
as only partial decomposition of the biomass occurs. The difference between
torrefaction and rectiﬁcation is the reaction temperature ranges (Antal and Grønli
2003).
Apart from the techniques discussed above, there are some sustainable techniques
such as ﬂash carbonization and microwave-assisted pyrolysis. The main advantages
are short processing time, lesser energy requirement, and effectual heat transfer. In
MAP, better volumetric heating is obtained. But the main disadvantage is degrada-
tion of microstructure when treated for a long time, and yield of biochar is also less
as it can be attributed to inﬂated heating rates at high microwave power levels. In
ﬂash carbonization, the biochar yield is quite high on comparison to conventional
processes.
In the development of biochar, apart from feeds different types of reactors are
employed for different types of carbonization processes. Some of the reactors
include agitated drum sand rotating kilns, screw pyrolizers, vacuum reactor,
ﬂuidized-bed reactor, transported-bed reactor, rotating-cone reactor, vortex-
centrifuge reactor, ablative reactor, augur reactor, gasiﬁers, etc. (Table 6.1).
6.3
Classification of Biochar
6.3.1
Types of Feedstock
The biochar production can be from a wide range of feedstocks. The source of these
feedstocks classiﬁes them into three categories such as (1) forest and agricultural
residues, (2) industrial by-products and municipal wastes, and (3) nonconventional

materials. The value addition of these waste biomasses into biochar will drastically
reduce the operation cost for the disposal of these wastes, and the aftereffects caused
by them to the environment can be kept in check to some level.
6.3.1.1 Forest and Agricultural Residues
Global production of these forest and forest residues is increasing day by day over
the years. It amounts to more than 500 million tonnes based on the record of the year
2011. This may be doubled or tripled over the coming years (Duku et al. 2011). Most
of the agricultural residues includes wastes or by-products generated as a result of
harvesting and processing of crops such as sugarcane, sorghum, etc. Forest residues
include sawdust, wood chips, and wood mills etc. The operating cost associated with
disposal of these residues is costly and is scarcely utilized. The ease of collection,
reduction of operational cost for disposal, and abundancy of these residues make
them a better feedstock for biochar production.
The biochar produced from these residues has good sorption ability for a diverse
group of organic and inorganic contaminants which is due to the surface properties
of the feedstock materials (Mohan et al. 2007). This sorption ability can be explained
by few examples such as the following: The oak bark has high contents of suberin,
ﬂavonoids,
and
polyphenolic
tannins.
The
beet
tailings
have
complex
heteropolysaccharides such as galacturonic acid, galactose, arabinose, and some
variation of pectin substances. Thermal carbonization of these residues yields
abundant oxygen-containing groups. Some of these groups are C–O, C–OH,
C¼O, C–O–R, and –OH (Aksu and Isoglu 2005). In addition to this, oak and
pinewood chars consist cationic micronutrients such as Na, Mg, and K (Mohan
et al. 2007).
6.3.1.2 Industrial By-Products and Municipal Wastes
The generation of biochar from industrial by-products and municipal wastes has
been noted, and interest in them has been growing day by day (Yao et al. 2011a, b;
Phuengprasop et al. 2011). In industries, biodegradation is an important step in waste
treatment. Anaerobic digestion is the most common biodegradation step which
degrades waste by employing a variety of microorganisms. The biochar produced
from this feedstocks has a high ion exchange capacity as it has anaerobically
digested wastes and has high concentrations of cationic or metallic elements
(Hanay et al. 2008; Gu and Wong 2004).
In contrary to this, municipal wastes are another possible source for potential
biomass feedstock for biochar production. Fauna wastes such as poultry litter which
comprises of bedding material, spilled feed, and feather and manure from cattle
rearing have excess amounts of ash and inorganic micronutrients which can bind
heavy metals in aqueous phase (Uchimiya et al. 2010; Duku et al. 2011; Cao et al.
2011).
6.3.1.3 Nonconventional Materials
Some examples of nonconventional materials include waste tires (Karakoyun et al.
2011), scraps of newspaper (Li and Zhang 2004), bones (Dimovic et al. 2011;
6

Cheung et al. 2000), plastic wastes (Gil et al. 2010), and food wastes (Rhee and Park
2010; Ahmed and Gupta 2010). Owing to the abundancy of waste tires, using them
as biochar feedstock has made them attractive, and their operating cost for disposal
will be greatly reduced. The ignition of crushed and distilled animal bones yields a
heterogenous sorbent called bone biochar. This biochar has high concentration of
hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate which has high ion exchange capacity
(Cheung et al. 2000).
6.3.2
Hybrid Biochar Through Modification
The biochar potential in wastewater treatment can be ascribed to their relative
inexpensiveness, feedstock abundancy, and surface characteristics. Although
biochar exhibited great potential, sure it has its won limitations such as restricted
limitations to its ability to adsorb contaminants from wastewater containing high
concentrations, because the small particle size of biochar makes it difﬁcult to remove
from aqueous systems. These shortcomings can be dealt by modifying or engineer-
ing them to have novel structures and surface properties. These modiﬁed biochars
are called biochar-based nanocomposites. These nanocomposites were classiﬁed
into three categories such as (1) nano-metal hydroxide/oxide-biochar composites,
(2) magnetic biochar-based composites, and (3) functional nanoparticles-coated
biochar.
6.3.2.1 Nano-metal Oxide/Hydroxide-Biochar Composite
In this, there are three pursuits to engineer the abovementioned composite. In the ﬁrst
two methods, the target metals were impregnated before thermal carbonization, and
in the third technique, the target metal is directly introduced into the biochar. In the
ﬁrst method, bioaccumulation of the target metal element by the biomass and on
thermal treatment yields the nano-metal oxide/hydroxide biochar. For example,
Mg-enriched biochar derived from tomato tissues obtained by slow pyrolysis had
a substantial adsorption propensity to phosphate in aqueous solution (Yao et al.
2013).
Pretreatment of biomass using metal salt by immersing the biomass in metal salt
solution. The ions will get attached to the surface or may ﬂow into the inside of the
biomass. The metal ions will be modiﬁed into metal oxides/hydroxides after pyroly-
sis. Thus, the biochar saturated with metal ions will transmute into biochar-based
nanocomposites. The development of Al2O3, AlOOH, CaO, MgO, MnOx, and ZnO
nanoparticles onto the biochar surface can be obtained by pretreating the biomass
with metal salts such as AlCl3, CaCl2, MgCl2, KMnO4, MnCl2, and ZnCl2 (Yao et al.
2013).
In the last method, the metal oxides/hydroxides were impregnated after the
thermal carbonization of biomass. Some of the techniques for impregnation involves
evaporative, heat treatment, and wet impregnation method. For example, the biochar
modiﬁed by evaporative method using Fe(NO3)3.9H2O has increased surface area by
a factor of approximately 2.5.

6.3.2.2 Magnetic Biochar-Based Composites
To overcome the difﬁculty of separating from aqueous solution after contaminant
removal, the biochar can be converted into magnetic materials. So, the magnetic
biochar can be easily segregated under the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. In addition
to this, the adsorption capability of the magnetic biochar was also increased (Zhang
et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2011). For conversion, two techniques are followed. They are
as follows: (1) pretreatment of biomass in the presence of iron ions and (2) iron oxide
precipitation onto biochar.
In the ﬁrst technique, the biomass was impregnated with Fe3+/Fe2+, and
subsequent thermal carbonization of the impregnated biomass yields the magnetic
biochar, for example, thermal carbonization of the FeCl3 along with Fe ions, and
other ions can also be impregnated along with them (Zhang et al. 2014), for example,
magnetic biochar synthesized by pretreating the biomass with Fe(NO3)3.9H2O and
Co(NO3)2.6H2O followed by slow pyrolysis (Reddy and Lee 2014).
The second technique is chemical coprecipitation of Fe3+/Fe2+ directly onto the
biochar. The synthesis involves the mixing of aqueous biochar solution with aque-
ous ferrous/ferrous solution, followed by treatment using aqueous NaOH solution
(Han et al. 2015).
6.3.2.3 Functional Nanoparticles-Coated Biochar
To make the biochar-based nanocomposites affordable to some extent, functional
nanoparticles are integrated into them. Some of the functional nanoparticles include
chitosan, carbon nanotube, graphene, ZnS nanocrystals, graphene oxides, layered
double hydroxides, etc. The main advantage of the functional nanoparticles along
with adsorption is degradation of the contaminants. Synthesis of these involves two
methods which are precoating of the biomass before thermal carbonization with
functional nanoparticles and saturation of functional nanoparticles onto biochar after
pyrolysis treatment.
In precoating technique, the biomass is immersed in homogenized functional
nanoparticles suspension which is called dip-coating procedure. Some illustrations
are as follows: Graphene-coated biochar is produced from the congelation of
graphene/pyrene derivative-treated biomass, and dip coating of biomass in
carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotube solution followed by pyrolysis yielded
multiwalled carbon nanotube-coated biochar (Inyang et al. 2014). Both biochars
show increased thermal stability, surface area, and porosity.
Saturation of functional nanoparticles onto the biochar after thermal carboniza-
tion holds advantage over the previous technique as there may be blockage of pores
in the latter technique. Hydrogel, Mg/Al LDH, chitosan, zerovalent iron (ZVI), and
ZnS nanocrystals were commonly used in this synthesis of these biochars.

6.4
Role of Biochar in Wastewater Treatment
Biochar is an emerging substitute for treatment of organic pollutants such as
volatiles,
antibiotics,
aromatic
dyes,
polychlorinated
biphenyl
(PCB),
and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from aqueous systems, and it application was
extended to inorganic pollutants, for instance, heavy metals, ammonia, nitrate,
phosphate, etc. Mechanisms such as ion exchange, pore ﬁlling, precipitation, and
surface sorption are involved in removal of contaminants from aqueous systems
(Fig. 6.1).
6.4.1
Inorganic Contaminant Removal
The potential adsorption mechanism involved in removal of inorganic pollutants
includes synergistic effects of various interactions such as ion exchange, electrostatic

interaction, precipitation, surface sorption, and complexation. Some illustrations for
the adsorption of inorganic contaminants were given in Table 6.2.
6.4.1.1 Heavy Metal Removal
The high concentration of heavy metals present in aqueous system gives rise to a
serious threat to the environmental remediation which can adversely affect human
beings, plants, and animals. In the event of long exposure, it can cause severe health
concerns to the living beings. Thus, there are studies that conﬁrm biochar can be a
suitable adsorbent for the treating of heavy metals in wastewater. The adsorption of
uranium and copper ions by pinewood char and grass char occurs through surface
sorption (Kumar et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2010a, b). Sort of a physical sorption involves
the formation of chemical bonds between ions and sorbent when diffusing between
the pores of the sorbent (Patra et al. 2017). The thermal carbonization temperature of
the biomass inﬂuences the adsorption capacity. The higher the temperature, the
higher the number of pores and surface area which in turn increases the diffusion.
Surface adsorption is the governing mechanism in the adsorption of Co(II), Zn(II),
Cu(II), Pb(II), and Cd(II) to dairy manure biochar (Wang et al. 2015). Similar to this
surface precipitation mechanism is a governing mechanism for adsorption of Zn, Cr,
Mn, and Cu by municipal sewage sludge-derived biochar (Zhou et al. 2017a, b).
Next, electrostatic interaction of ions to biochar depends on the pH of the aqueous
system along with point of zero charge pH of the biochar. The interaction between
the metal ions and charged biochar surface causes the immobilization of the ions
(Mukherjee et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2011). In the adsorption of anionic metal ions,
electrostatic interaction is the dominant mechanism. The rate of production of
graphene in biochar directly inﬂuences electrostatic interaction between the
contaminants and surface. This is why thermal carbonization temperature exceeds
400 C to favor electrostatic interaction (Keiluweit and Kleber 2009). In the adsorp-
tion of Cd and aluminum, electrostatic interaction is the main mechanism.
Ion exchange mechanism is the exchange of protons and ionized cations between
the surface of biochar and metals in aqueous system. This sorption behavior depends
on the size of the metal ion in the aqueous system and surface functional groups on
the biochar. In ion exchange process, based on the ionic radii, bond characteristics
and charge difference occur with the substitution of metal ion from aqueous system
in the biochar system by removal of positively charged ions (Krauskopf 1967).
Cation exchange capacity (CEC) depends on the presence of surface functional
groups, and the higher the CEC, the higher the capability or potential for elimination
of metal contaminants from aqueous system (Ali et al. 2017; Rizwan et al. 2016). In
the adsorption of Pb and Cd by biochar derived from feedstocks such as wheat straw,
grape stalk, nut shield, and stone husk, cation exchange is the governing mechanism
(Trakal et al. 2016).
During precipitation a sorption mechanism involves the development of solids in
the aqueous system or on the biochar surface. Biochar rich in alkaline minerals is
usually involved in the precipitation of metal ions from aqueous system. This
suitable biochar that supports this mechanism was derived by degradation of feed-
stock rich in cellulose and hemicellulose by thermal carbonization (Cao and Harris

2010). For example, bagasse biochar forms hydrocerussite precipitate with Pb on the
biochar surface (Inyang et al. 2011). For precipitation mechanism, the thermal
carbonization temperature for the biochar feedstock should be less than 200 C as
these minerals in the biochar should be soluble to interact with metal ions in the
aqueous system to form non-soluble precipitation, thereby enhancing the sorption
behavior of the biochar (Cao and Harris 2010). The biochar is produced with thermal
carbonization temperature between 300 C and 650 C, and the alkaline minerals are
slightly soluble form, thus slowing down the sorption behavior of the biochar
(Inyang et al. 2011). In the sorption of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) to municipal waste
sludge-derived biochar, precipitation is the dominant mechanism (Chen et al.
2015a).
Complexation of metal ions involves the formation of complexes with speciﬁc
metal ligands. This is a multiatom arrangement formation. Biochar produced at low
thermal carbonization temperature has an abundant oxygen functional groups like
lactonic, phenolic, and carboxylic groups which showed greater efﬁciency of metal
ion binding in the aqueous systems (Liu and Zhang 2009; Mohan et al. 2007).
Surface oxidation of biochar surface increases the oxygen content which in turn
increases the sorption capacity (Harvey et al. 2011). Plant-based biochar has more
complexation capacity than animal-based biochar. Ni, Cd, and Pb form complexes
with carboxylic and phenolic groups in plant-based biochar. Biochar derived from
dairy manure and poultry litter binds the phosphate ligand to Pb to form pyromor-
phite (Guo et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2009).
6.4.1.2 Nitrogen and Phosphorus Removal
Biochar was able to adsorb phosphorus and nitrates in the aqueous systems. They
usually exist in the water bodies in the form of nitrate (NO3
), ammonium (NH4
+),
and phosphate (PO4
3). These inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus lead to eutrophi-
cation. This water eutrophication in water bodies is one of the biggest concerns in the
world today. Although carbon (C), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) also play a
role in the eutrophication, the major proportion is caused by nitrogen and phospho-
rus. The large surface area and pore structure enables for sorption of high concen-
tration of N/P from aqueous systems. In comparison of wood biochar with rice husk

biochar, the former has more surface area than the latter one which in turn shows
more efﬁciency for adsorption of ammonium ions by the wood biochar (Kizito et al.
2015). And biochar modiﬁed by magnesium oxide shows high adsorption capacity
to nitrate owing to the high surface area provided by the MgO nanoﬂakes (Zhang
et al. 2012). Phosphate adsorption capability is affected by surface area and active
sites distribution in the biochar. The surface area increases with increase in operation
temperature in pyrolysis but only in the range between 200 and 400 C. Although
adsorption capacity of phosphate is increased in these temperature ranges, it
decreases for temperature above 400 C. Thus, the adsorption of N/P not only
depends on the surface area of the biochar.
Surface functional groups are important for the removal of NH4
+/NO3
 from
aqueous systems. There is a positive interrelationship between the removal rate of
NH4
+, NO3
, and the acidic, basic functional groups on the surface of biochar
(Wang et al. 2015). The aromatic C¼C, C¼O, CH2–, and aliphatic C–O–C
functional group on the surface of biochar is mostly involved in the adsorption of
NH4
+ (Zeng et al. 2013). Naturally, acidic functional groups are mostly present in the
biochar. But for adsorption of NO3
, basic functional groups are required. Thus, by
modiﬁcation of the surface of the biochar with ammonia, basic functional groups are
introduced on it. This increases the sorption capacity of NO3
 (Iida et al. 2013).
The adsorption of phosphate occurs in the biochar due to the presence of metallic
oxides such as CaO, MgO, AlOOH, Fe2O3, etc. These metal oxides either form
hydrogen bonds or react with phosphate to form precipitation in the aqueous system
which is the reason for the sorption behavior. Phosphate removal is in direct
correlation to the presence of Ca and Mg fraction in biochar (Takaya et al. 2016).
Peanut shell biochar has the highest content of Ca and Mg, thus showing high
efﬁciency for phosphate removal (Jung et al. 2015). The reason for afﬁnity toward
phosphate is due to the presence of nanoﬂakes of MgO widely distributed over the
surface of the biochar. The surface of MgO is always positively charged as the point
of zero charge of pH is 12 and most aqueous system naturally has pH below than this
(Yao et al. 2011a).
Some other factors which inﬂuence the sorption behavior are pH and coexisting
ions. The pH of the aqueous system greatly inﬂuences the sorption by altering the
surface charge of the biochar. In alkaline conditions, the ammonium ions get
converted to NH3 greatly lowering the sorption capacity (Huang et al. 2010). The
surface charge of the biochar surface is inﬂuenced by pyrolysis temperature. Biochar
produced at thermal carbonization temperature more than 400 C shows higher value
of point of zero charge pH than the pH of the aqueous system. But biochar generated
at temperature less than 200 C has point of zero charge pH at 7. So, on this case the
phosphate sorption capacity of biochar is low (Jung and Ahn 2016).
Wastewater contains not only the target ions but also other coexisting ions. These
coexisting ions affect the adsorption capacity of the biochar. When the biochar is
selective or site speciﬁc for a particular target ion, then the coexisting ions’ inﬂuence
will be minimal or none at all. For example, Cl, NO3
, and SO4
2 show no effect
on the adsorption of ammonium ions, but chloride, sulfate, and phosphate inhibit the
extent of adsorption of nitrate to some level which is due to the competitiveness
122

between the coexisting ions and nitrate (Liu et al. 2010a, b). The phosphate sorption
capacity of the biochar greatly decreases with increase in bicarbonate concentration;
this may be due to the competitiveness or the increase in the pH of the aqueous
system (Yao et al. 2011a, 2013).
6.4.2
Organic Contaminant Removal
The removal mechanism of organic contaminants by biochar is a combination of
many mechanisms such as electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction, pore ﬁlling,
partitioning, and electron donor and acceptor interaction. Some illustrations for
adsorption of organic contaminants were given in Table 6.3.
6.4.2.1 Dye Removal from Textile Effluent
The efﬂuent discharged from textile industry has vast amounts of acids, bases, toxic
compounds, dissolved solids, and mainly dyes which are responsible for the color of
the efﬂuent. This efﬂuent poses major threat to the environment. The textile dyes do
not degrade easily as they are resistant to light, aerobic digestion, and oxidizing
agents. Some of the mechanisms involved in the sorption of dyes in biochar include
electrostatic interaction, pore ﬁlling, cationic π interaction, π-π interaction, ion
exchange, etc. Electrostatic interaction is the governing mechanism for sorption of
ionizable and ionic organic contaminants, and most of the textile dyes comes under
this category. Ionic sorbates naturally show afﬁnity to oppositely charged sorbent
surface. Ionic strength and pH are the determining factor in sorption capacity of the
biochar based on the electrostatic interaction mechanism. During repulsive electro-
static interaction, sorption between the sorbent and sorbate increases with increase in
ionic strength, whereas during attractive electrostatic interaction, sorption between
the sorbate and sorbent decreases with increase in ionic strength. Sorption of
methylene blue and methyl blue onto the biochar was electrostatic interaction
mechanism. Alternate sorption mechanism for methylene blue dye is ion exchange,
because at low pH the H+ ions bind with the binding sites that are involved in
electrostatic interaction and metal ions such as Ca2+, Na+, etc. are released into the
aqueous system with sorption of methylene blue dye to the biochar.
Pore ﬁlling is the governing mechanism in the sorption of malachite green dye to
biochar derived from Opuntia ﬁcus-indica. This biochar possesses mesoporous
structure. Some other mechanisms involved in the malachite green dye sorption to
biochar
are
π-π
electron
donor-acceptor
(EDA)
interactions
and
cation-π
interactions. This occurs due to the presence of electron-deﬁcient groups in mala-
chite green dye and electron-rich groups such as amine and hydroxyl groups present
on the biochar surface (Srivatsav et al. 2020; Abbas et al. 2018).
6.4.2.2 Phenol Removal
Phenolic concentrations are present in diverse concentration in various wastewater
streams. Usually, phenolics are mass produced for production of drugs, dyes,
pesticides, antioxidants, etc. They give rise to serious threat to the environment

even at low concentration. The phenolics are considered as human carcinogens,
show poor biodegradability, and can cause serious ecological damage. Hydrophobic
interaction is the dominant mechanism for the phenol removal in biochar derived
from pistachio shells, pecan shells, and sawdust which can be reasoned by the
presence of increased carbon content (graphene structure) obtained at high thermal
carbonization temperature. Hydrophobic interaction is a combined mechanism
which involves both partitioning and hydrophobic mechanism generally driven by
entropy (Komnitsas and Zaharaki 2016; Abbas et al. 2018).
Acid-base interactions and hydrogen binding are the sorption mechanism in the
phenol removal on the biochar derived from corn cob and rice husk biochar. In
catechol sorption onto the biochar derived from loblolly pine, oak, and gamma grass,
pore ﬁlling is the dominant mechanism. This mechanism depends on the presence of
micropore and mesopore on the surface of the biochar. Sorption behavior involving
pore ﬁlling mechanism is favored at low concentration of solute and small number of
volatiles in biochar (Abbas et al. 2018).
6.4.2.3 Pharmaceutically Active Compounds Removal
Pharmaceutically active compounds that come under micropollutants are of great
concern to the environment due to their nonbiodegradability along with their toxic-
ity. This effect can rise to permanent long-time side effects to marine organisms. The
adsorption mechanism involved in sorption of pharmaceuticals involves hydrogen
bonding, electrostatic attraction, π-π interaction, hydrophobic interaction, dipole-
dipole interaction, and van der Waals force (Chen et al. 2020).
Hydrogen bonding mechanism involves the intermolecular attraction between the
hydrogen donor and acceptor. The sorption of atrazine to the biochar derived from
sludge is due to the hydrogen bonding between the amino groups in the contaminant
and the hydroxyl groups on the biochar. Rather than normal hydrogen bonds,
charge-assisted hydrogen bonds such as negatively charged, positively charged,
and doubly charged hydrogen bonds have more strength. Ionizable pharmaceuticals
(e.g., sulfamethoxazole) usually form negatively charged hydrogen bonds with the
biochar. The charge-assisted bond formation occurs due to indistinguishable pKa
values of adsorbent and adsorbate. Charge-assisted hydrogen bond is the sorption
mechanism between the pharmaceuticals and oxygen-rich biochar (Chen et al.
2020).
π-π interaction is a type of dipole interaction and is weaker than hydrogen bond.
Increase in pyrolysis temperature increases the rate of aromaticity of biochar. This
interaction between sorbent and sorbate is polar. π-π interaction is the most usual
type of interaction between aromatic groups. So, this interaction is the dominant
mechanism between the pharmaceuticals norﬂoxacin, diclofenac sodium, and
chitosan magnetic composite biochar. The sorption of tetracycline onto the
bagasse-derived biochar is due to π-π interaction. Due to the high electronegativity
of π system, cation attraction is also favorable (Chen et al. 2020).
Some other interactions for sorption behavior of pharmaceuticals include hydro-
phobic interaction. Phenanthrene removal from aqueous system onto the biochar
may be due to the hydrophobic interaction, but it is not the dominant mechanism.
126
A. M. Joe Cyril Harrish and H. S. Pawar

Pore ﬁlling mechanism was also seen in case of pharmaceuticals like dimetridazole
and metronidazole (Chen et al. 2020).
6.4.2.4 Pesticide and Herbicide Removal
These are compounds which have wide array of applications in parks, industrial
sites, educational facilities, farming, and forestry to control rodents and insects
which naturally act as vectors for diseases. Usually, based on the chemical structure
of pesticides, they are classiﬁed into ﬁve major categories which are as follows:
organochlorines, organophosphorus, chlorophenols, carbamates, and synthetic
pyrethroids (George and Shukla 2011; Hamza et al. 2016). Sorption behavior of
pesticide onto biochar can be explained by a culmination of mechanism such as
partitioning and hydrogen bonding and as usual depends on the biochar surface area.
The composition of biochar usually contains carbonized and non-carbonized
fraction. Graphene and crystalline-like fractions come under carbonized fractions
and organic carbon, noncrystalline, amorphous fractions under non-carbonized
fractions. When the sorption mechanism is partitioning, it occurs by propagation
of sorbates into the pores of the biochar, and later it gets solubilized into the matrix of
the amorphous carbon which contains polyaromatic and aliphatic compounds. The
dominant sorption mechanism that occurs between the biochar enriched with volatile
matter and aqueous system containing high concentration of contaminant is
partitioning (Abbas et al. 2018). Sorption of 1-naphthol and naphthalene onto
biochar derived from orange peel under different thermal carbonization temperature
is by partitioning mechanism. The other interaction involved in sorption of
1-naphthol onto the biochar is hydrogen bonding which is due to the presence of
hydroxyl group in the contaminant (Chen and Chen 2009).
Dibromochloropropane is a soil fumigant used to prevent nematodes which were
treated by using almond shell-activated biochar with 100% removal rate. Pore ﬁlling
mechanism can also be seen in the sorption of 1,4-dichlorobenzene onto the biochar
derived from pinewood (Klasson et al. 2013).
6.4.2.5 Solvents Removal
Some of the solvents used in the industry include benzene, nitrobenzene, 1,2,4-
trichlorobenzene, and trichloroethylene. The sorption of benzene and nitrobenzene
onto the biochar derived from wheat residues produced under different thermal
carbonization temperature. The solvents get adsorbed on the carbonized surface,
while low-temperature char follows partitioning mechanism for sorption. More than
that, nitrobenzene shows afﬁnities to functional groups on the surface of the biochar
owing to the presence of nitro group (Chun et al. 2004).
Pore ﬁlling was seen in the sorption of 1,2,4-dichlorobenzene onto the biochar
derived from pinewood char (Nguyen et al. 2007). Trichloroethylene adsorption
onto the biochar derived from soybean stover and peanut shells is in positive
correlation with the carbon contents of the biochar but in negative correlation with
oxygen content of the biochar (Ahmad et al. 2013).

6.5
Conclusion and Future Perspectives
Biochar is a remunerative adsorbent generated from a wide range of biomass and is
modiﬁed as nanocomposites for easiness of operation. The sorption of contaminants
from wastewater onto biochar follows a combination of numerous mechanisms. Use
of biochar for wastewater treatment for adsorption of both organic and inorganic
contaminants has high removal percentage. And the cost of operation is also
minimal.
Although there is bright future for their application in wastewater treatment, the
work on biochar done was mostly in laboratory level. Future perspective should be
to develop technology to modify the biochar to have greater efﬁciency, practical
application of biochar in wastewater treatment, and further improvement of the
adsorption capacity of biochar.

Introduction
In recent years, the explication of water resource management has developed
signiﬁcantly because the exponentially growing problem of water pollution has
become a major current issue. As an aspect of such initiatives, global pollution
agencies and organizations, including the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, have identiﬁed the control and removal of highly toxic and dangerous
substances, such as dyes, as crucial functions (US EPA). Enormous studies are being
conducted to establish both the immediate and long impacts of dye on people’s well-
being and the natural ecosystem (Long et al. 2017). Dyes are the most widely used
chemicals in a variety of industries, such as the textile industry; the threat of dye
contamination has attained an all-time high degree in recent times. About 10,000
forms of synthetic dyes are reported to be industrial purposes utilized with a yearly
output of more than 7  105 tons. As such, the utilization of dyes for a variety of

uses, such as textiles, leathers, detergents, medicines, and cosmetics, has seen an
upsurge (Ooi et al. 2017).
Adsorption is a method of mass transfer of dyes from the liquid-state to a solid-
state adsorbent. Adsorption is one of the most prevalently deployed methods in
wastewater treatment processes; it has several strengths, such as clean design,
relatively inexpensive, simple operation, and high performance. Biochar (BC) has
steadily penetrated the perception of humanity in recent times. BC is a carbon-rich
material generated in an oxygen-depleted system by heating biomass, like wood and
manure with less or no oxygen, and BC can survive in the soil for hundreds of years
(Tan et al. 2015). BC is characterized by high surface area, high porosity, active
surface functional groups, and trace minerals, making it possible to extract dyes from
aqueous systems as a sensible adsorbent (Zhang et al. 2018). As a sorbent, BC, with
a porous nature identical to activated charcoal, is currently the most widely used and
efﬁcient adsorbent to remove water contaminants such as dyes. BC, however, is a
new form of adsorbent with low cost and high performance, distinct from activated
carbon. Higher temperatures and the activation time are needed for the development
of activated carbon. By comparative analysis, BC is easier to manufacture and
requires less electricity. BC is a renewable resource, and owing to its environmental
and economic beneﬁts, it is an excellent product for green technology to process
water pollutants like dyes (Tan et al. 2015).
However, signiﬁcant attention has been paid to improving the pyrolysis
parameters to boost the production and properties of the resulting BC. Various
variables, including biomass source and operational parameters of the pyrolysis
process (time, temperature, heating rate, pressure), increase the efﬁcacy and perfor-
mance of the BC. For example, materials with heavy lignin and low moisture levels
are pertinent for the production of high-yield BCs; the heating rate has an impact on
production, pore volume, and surface area. Among them, the pyrolytic temperature
is the most important factor in the development of high-quality BCs. In additament,
signiﬁcant advancements in BC design incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) and chem-
ical and biological alteration have culminated in a speciﬁc subset of hybrid chars
with expanded capabilities for the treatment of a wide range of dyes. BC activities
can also be signiﬁcantly impacted by pretreatment of raw material and posttreatment
of BC. As seen in Fig. 7.1, pretreatment probably depends on the feed material and
the intent for BC usage, covering physical (dry, crush, sieve, wash, etc.), chemical
(chemical treatment, precursor and functional agents processing, etc.), and biological
(bacterial treatment, etc.) methods. Posttreatment is primarily based on physical
(magnetization, ball milling, etc.) and chemical (corrosive treatment, etc.)
approaches (Tan et al. 2016; Tang and Zaini 2017). To date, numerous publications
have illustrated pretreatment in connection to raw material decomposition methods
and the resulting BC properties and also posttreatment techniques for BC characteri-
zation and their implications on dye-contaminated wastewater management.
Preceding researches have been published on the existence and implementation of
BC, and several researchers have assessed the development and operation of BC on
dye-contaminated wastewater. Interestingly, some research has been conducted on
the engineering application to remove industrial contaminants and the recovery of
136
S. S. Sutar et al.

BCs in recent times. This chapter describes a vast volume of existing research on BC
adsorption of synthetic dyes in recent times to include a summary of the updated
technology on adsorption of dyes and their implementation in engineering and
regeneration. This chapter presents the relevant information of BC (basic physical
and chemical properties, sources, forms, mode of production) and incorporates the
process of interaction of dyes and BC.
7.2
Sources and Production
Biomass waste products, comprising agro-industrial wastes (Fathi et al. 2015),
forestry waste (Boumehdi Toumi et al. 2015), and livestock and poultry manure
(Yu et al. 2018), are suitable for the development of BC. BC’s raw resources are
primarily harvested from agricultural organic matter, including crop residues, wood
organic matter, animal waste, and solid waste. The content of the BC (carbon,
nitrogen, potassium, calcium) relies on the materials employed, the pyrolysis time,
and temperature. The nature and surface characteristics of BC primarily depend on
the type of raw resources and the pyrolysis temperature. Distinct raw materials and
various temperatures of pyrolysis have differential consequences on BC’s total
carbon and gray content.

7.2.1
Pretreatment
Pretreatment is the ﬁrst stage in the development of BC from various raw materials.
These approaches can usually be categorized as physical, chemical, and biological
pretreatment techniques (Fig. 7.1). In particular, physical pretreatment technology
requires drying, crushing, sieving, and biomass feedstock washing. The raw material
rich in lignocellulose is normally processed at 110 C or other temperature to
constant mass, crushed using a hammer mill into ﬁner molecules, and then slashed
into various parts (Essandoh et al. 2017). As a raw material, papers and cardboard are
typically crushed and mixed into pulp (Randolph et al. 2017). Paper manufacturing
waste is acid-washed and further washed with deionized water to acquire mineral-
free sediment (Cho et al. 2017). Alga is alkaline and is probably washed with
freshwater prior to pyrolysis and then processed, granulated, or ﬂaked (Roberts
and de Nys 2016).
To alter the attributes of raw material products, chemical pretreatment technology
also focuses on chemical reactions. The processing of biomass raw material with
chemicals to incorporate chemical precursors or functional agents into the raw
material is one of the most widely used chemical pretreatment techniques. The
biomass is soaked in a chemical solution throughout processing and then dried
before BC production. Biomass can be managed to transform into BC-based
nanocomposites with metal oxyhydroxide nanoparticles reinforced on the BC sur-
face by the pores of formulated BC after pretreatment with metal ion solutions, for
instance, MgO, AlOOH, and SnFe2O4 (Zhang et al. 2012; Zhang and Gao 2013; Rai
et al. 2015). On the other side, graphene, carbon nanorods, and clay could be mixed
with engineered nanoparticles and natural colloids, which also contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to the efﬁcient development of BC-based nanocomposites (Du et al. 2020a, b;
Dil et al. 2016; Liang et al. 2019). Researchers pretreat biomass to develop modiﬁed
BC with expanded surface area, unique adsorption capacity, highly porous nature,
etc.; corrosive chemicals like acid, alkali, and oxidant were also utilized.
A reasonably novel approach is the biological pretreatment technique that enables
bioprocesses to enhance biomass feedstock for engineered BC production. Several
biomass products have been exposed to the anaerobic digestion process, namely,
sugar beet tailings, bagasse, industrial sludge, and animal waste, and then the
products were processed by slow pyrolysis into BC (Inyang et al. 2010; Yao et al.
2014). The pretreatment of anaerobic digestion would render the procured BC to
possess a larger speciﬁc surface area (SSA) and boosted adsorption potential (Inyang
et al. 2010).
7.2.2
Thermal Carbonization
Thermal processes primarily include pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, and
gasiﬁcation for raw material conversion into BC. In an anaerobic climate, pyrolysis
is a thermochemical mechanism for biomass decomposition. The processing tem-
perature, heating period, and residential time are employed to impact the pyrolysis
138
S. S. Sutar et al.

mechanisms, which can inﬂuence the chemistry and morphological attributes of
products. With increased pyrolysis temperature, BC quantities decrease, while ash
and carbon products increase. Gasiﬁcation is the mechanism by which the biomass is
converted by gasiﬁcation agents into gas fuel. Generally, the gasiﬁcation tempera-
ture is greater than 800 C. Elevated concentrations of alkali salts and alkaline earth
minerals are generally present in the BC formed during gasiﬁcation.
Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is the processing without pre-drying of wet
raw material at a temperature scale of 120–260 C into BC. Predominantly, the BC
formed by HTC is called hydrochar. During the HTC, the reaction temperature is
deﬁned as the regulatory variable. Hydrochar develops ample acidic functional
groups on its exterior with the rising temperature, which can enhance the capacity
of dye adsorption. The porosity of the hydrochar can be improved by rising retention
temperature and residence time which enhances the implementation of hydrochar
being applied as an adsorbent. Gasiﬁcation is the mechanism used by gasifying
agents to turn biomass into BC. The temperature of gasiﬁcation is usually above
800 C. During gasiﬁcation, the BC formed typically contains high concentrations of
alkaline salts and soil minerals.
7.2.3
Posttreatment
Magnetic, ball milling, and corrosive (i.e., acid, alkali, or oxidation) processings are
the
three
foremost
widely
employed
methods
for
posttreatment
of
BC. Magnetization is the process of transforming BC into a magnetic product
where magnetic iron oxides are placed into BC, like SnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and
NiZnFe particles (Rai et al. 2015; Liang et al. 2019; Amin et al. 2020). Therefore,
from the aqueous solution, magnetic altered BC can effectively be retrieved. Ball
milling is an easy, convenient, and straightforward technique that uses kinetic energy
by rotating balls to disrupt chemical bonding, modify the structure of molecules, and
produce nanoscale particles. BC features, namely, speciﬁc surface area, pore size,
oxygen-bearing functional groups, and adsorption capability, were strengthened
after ball milling. In order to manufacture novel engineered BC, ball-milling tech-
nology, therefore, becomes an efﬁcient engineering process. Corrosive therapies
such as acid, alkali, and oxidation approaches are widely applied methods of
chemical alteration that modify the BC’s surface chemistry. For various reasons,
corrosive chemicals, e.g., HCl, HNO3, KOH, NaOH, KMnO4, and H2O2, have been
used to alter the BC. There are a higher surface area, more mesoporous nature, more
functional groups, and improved sorption ability of the chemically modiﬁed BC.
7.3
Native-State BC
In agricultural production, agricultural waste is an umbrella term for organic
products disposed of by living creatures. As shown in Table 7.1, it consists mainly
of forest waste, animal and poultry waste, and processing materials from

agro-industries (Bouguettoucha et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2018; Etim et al. 2016).
Numerous agricultural products and their associated waste have been manufactured
worldwide each year in the present history. The key structural constituents of
agricultural waste are lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. Lignin is an aromatic
polymer mainly formed on the surface by carbonyl, hydroxyl, methyl, and other
groups. The functional oxygen species, such as carbonyl and hydroxyl, comprise
both hemicellulose and cellulose. In BC technology, researchers are now making a
major contribution to extending the adsorption capacity of generated waste by
strengthening it, using different approaches. BC study has also increasingly begun
in several areas of the globe. From 2005 to date, BC technology has gained higher
and higher recognition. Depending on raw materials, necessary BC applications,
production methods, overall economy, and the formulation and construction of BC
systems worldwide differ substantially (Tan et al. 2015).
7.3.1
Agro-industrial Wastes
Durian seeds were chemically synthesized using KOH to produce the durian seed
BC by Ahmad et al. (2015) (DSAC). Based on experimental data, the percentage of
dye adsorption was augmented with increasing dye concentration, temperature, and
contact time. The rise in temperature led to an escalated proportion of adsorbed dye,
signifying an endothermic mechanism. The pseudo-second-order model best
demonstrated the adsorption kinetics, and both ﬁlm and intraparticle diffusions
governed the process. Conﬁrmation of Freundlich isotherm model to obtained
measurements intimated heterogeneity of the surface and unequally distributed
energies. Spontaneous and endothermic nature has been observed to interpret the
thermodynamic ﬁndings (Ahmad et al. 2015). Fathi et al. (2015) emphasized on
evaluating the potential and effectiveness of maize stalk (CS) in the removal from
aqueous solutions of diazo dye Direct Red 23 (DR23). The sorption processes have
adopted the pseudo-second order in conjunction to the intraparticle diffusion kinetics
with a good R2 value. Freundlich isothermal experiments have veriﬁed DR23 to be
well adsorbed, showing the multiple layer distribution of DR23 dye molecules on the
adsorbent surface. Evaluation based on thermodynamic ﬁndings showed that the
mechanism of adsorption is endothermic (Fathi et al. 2015). For sequestration of
methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions, a peanut shell was used as a sorbent
by mixing it with citric acid. The results of the kinetic assessment revealed that the
adsorption process of the system aligned satisfactorily with the pseudo-second-order
kinetics. Provided the adsorption results, the Freundlich model is a good ﬁt,
afﬁrming surface heterogeneity with the dispersed spectrum of adsorption energies.
The thermodynamic constants of adsorption were also assessed and observed to be a
spontaneous and exothermic process (Wang et al. 2016).
The purpose of Chalinez’ paper was to build the BC (DPP-BC) by pyrolysis of
date palm petioles (DPP) and to use the potency of harvesting puriﬁed solutions from
crystal violet (CV). The adsorption process is especially pH-dependent. The dataset
was well assimilated to the pseudo-ﬁrst-order, pseudo-second-order, and kinetic
7

model of Avrami. The isothermal model of Langmuir adsorption was best suited to
the equilibrium results. The homogeneity of the surface with evenly assigned
energies and afﬁnities is asserted by the Langmuir isotherm. The adsorption process
occurred spontaneously at different modulation temperatures and was endothermic
(Chahinez et al. 2020). The adsorption of methylene blue from solution to coconut
coir dust (CCD) BC using comparatively cheap agricultural waste material was
investigated by Etim et al. (2016). Three isothermal adsorption models, namely,
Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin, have been tested, and adsorption has been fully
tested impeccably well with these models. The kinetic data were well represented by
the pseudo-second order of kinetics. The adsorption procedure was endothermic and
spontaneous (Etim et al. 2016).
7.3.2
Forest Wastes
A unique cellulose acetate-integrated lemongrass leaf ﬁber adsorbent (TLGL-CA)
was produced, and its attributes and adsorption capability for crystal violet
(CV) were explored. The impacts of adsorption at different contact times and
speciﬁc CV concentrations were well equated with the model of pseudo-second
order. With the Langmuir isotherm model illustrating monolayer adsorption, the
measured results at an equilibrium state were well-governed. The inclusion of
hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the outside of TLGL-CA and a high potential
for adsorption endorse the afﬁnity of CV to the TLGL-CA BC (Putri et al. 2020). BC
has been generated using a physiochemical activation process from agricultural
waste (Stipa tenacissima ﬁber). In order to extract methylene blue from an aqueous
phase, the obtained BC was assessed as a methylene blue (MB) adsorbent. An
upsurge in the surface area was detected when activation was accomplished with
zinc chloride solution. Compared to conventional processes, the evaluation showed
that a combination of water, steam, CO2, and acetic acid was a stronger inciting
agent. In order to assess the fundamentals of adsorption, pseudo-ﬁrst-order, pseudo-
second-order, and intraparticle diffusion rate constants were investigated; it was
found that adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order and an intraparticle
diffusion model, inferring that intraparticle diffusion is not just an adsorption-
limiting mechanism. In comprehending MB adsorption, Sips isotherm was quite
vital. A spontaneous adsorption process and the endothermic nature were evinced by
the negative values of ΔG (Bouguettoucha et al. 2016). Adsorption properties of raw
Alfa grass were inspected for the removal of methylene blue (MB) dye in the
aqueous phase. The experimental database method indicated that the models of
Langmuir and pseudo-second order accurately explained the adsorption process.
The thermodynamic parameters unveiled that Alfa grass-MB adsorption was a
favored endothermic and spontaneous process that bolsters Alfa grass BC interaction
to MB. The comprehensive analysis of their work indicated that chemisorption was
required for adsorption in contrast to physisorption (Boumehdi Toumi et al. 2015).
The capability to eliminate crystal violet from aqueous solution by the novel
bio-adsorbent, Centaurea stem, has been deemed. The isothermal results found that
146
S. S. Sutar et al.

both Langmuir and Freundlich models obey the process, and the maximum adsorp-
tion capacity of 476.19 mg g1 was amassed for the bio-adsorbent, reﬂecting
Centaurea stem’s conspicuous and high potential to efﬁciently extract crystal violet
from the aqueous phase. The thermodynamic and kinetic processes of adsorption
have been investigated. The positive values of ΔH and ΔS have deﬁned the
endothermic nature of adsorption. The kinetic results demonstrate that the pseudo-
second-order kinetic model was obeyed by the adsorption of crystal violet (Naderi
et al. 2018). Terminalia arjuna sawdust (TASd) has been developed to be an
effective adsorbent comprising crystal violet (CV) dye to decontaminate wastewater.
With the rise in initial dye concentration, the adsorption potential was found to
increase, and the equilibrium was reached within 2 h. The medium’s pH should be
higher than 5 for the effective decontamination of water holding CV dye by the
adsorbent TASd. The isotherm studies illustrated that the experimental data complies
with the Freundlich isotherm model, suggesting the adsorption of crystal violet by
multilayer cooperative form. Thermodynamic experiments have reported that the
process of adsorption is spontaneous, endothermic, and followed by an upsurge in
entropy at the interface of the CV solution. It has been documented that as tempera-
ture rises, the efﬁciency of adsorptive removal of CV by TASd increases. The best
one for representing kinetic data was the pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic model (Shakoor
and Nasar 2018).
7.3.3
Livestock and Poultry Manure
Earthworm manure chars (EMCs) are produced from the processing of earthworm
waste. There were a high surface area of the EMCs, high porosity, and abundant
chemical functional groups. The adsorption process has been heavily impacted by
adsorption factors, for example, initial RB (Rhodamine B) concentration, contact
time, temperature, and the pH of the reaction solution. The Langmuir isotherm
model demonstrated that the mechanism of adsorption inferred monolayer adsorp-
tion well. Kinetic and thermodynamic experiments revealed that the adsorption
kinetics operated well with the pseudo-second-order and the RB adsorption process
was a spontaneous reaction and endothermic state. Oxygen-containing operational,
functional groups on the surface of the EMCs might actually communicate with RB
molecules via electron transfer, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic attraction,
resulting in a huge effect on RB adsorption (Shen et al. 2017). To adsorb methylene
blue (MB) from the aqueous solution, the low-temperature BC (CMB) produced
from cattle manure was analyzed. The study revealed that the developed data were
well-tailored to the Langmuir isothermal model and the operation of equilibrium
adsorption was a system of monolayer adsorption with equal energy distribution.
Pseudo-second-order kinetics was the most appropriate model to show the
biosorption of MB on BC. The thermodynamic ﬁgures demonstrated that the
adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. CMB behaves as a sorbent
by monolayer adsorption, and increasing the temperature and boosting the initial MB
concentration are beneﬁcial to the process of adsorption. In MB’s adsorption
7

mechanism on CMB200, cation exchange, electrostatic interaction, H-bonding,
physical interactions, and others were entangled (Zhu et al. 2018).
For preparing adsorbent ﬁlms, chicken feathers were utilized as a model adsor-
bent to extract crystal violet. Interestingly, the chemical composition of the reaction
affects the mechanism of adsorption. Adsorption is more reliant on operation
conditions, such as solution pH. Exothermic adsorption has, however, been
speculated for adsorption mechanism. Freundlich isotherm implies multilayer
adsorption on a heterogeneous surface, widely spread adsorption sites, and their
energies (Pradhan and Bajpai 2020). The accelerating temperature of the pyrolysis
was beneﬁcial for (Congo red) CR adsorption and had a signiﬁcant effect on BC
dynamics. The best description of CR adsorption is the Langmuir isotherm. The
kinetics is well demonstrated by the pseudo-second-order model. The experimental
ﬁndings propose that the BC concentration has a major inﬂuence on the CR
monolayer adsorption. Electrostatic interaction is ascertained as the decisive CR
mechanism in which CR adsorption is dominated by the interaction of π-π dispersion
(Yang et al. 2016). For the aqueous extraction of methyl orange (MO), BC adsorbent
(CMC) was developed from chicken manure pyrolysis at 600 C. The pseudo-
second-order model correctly represented the kinetic adsorption of varying
concentrations, and extrinsic mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion probably
inﬂuenced the rate of adsorption. The isothermal model of Langmuir showed a
better ﬁt with the parameters determined, i.e., R2  99. The mechanism for the
adsorption of MO on the CMC seems to be pore ﬁlling, and electrostatic forces have
been involved. Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters of a spontaneous and
endothermic system are proclaimed (Yu et al. 2018).
7.4
BC Composites with
7.4.1
Nanomaterials
7.4.1.1 Carbonaceous Materials
To improve the adsorption capability and regeneration efﬁciency of graphene-BC
composites, a new Fe3O4-graphene-BC composite (GBC-Fe3O4) was developed.
Adsorption properties were evaluated for the removal of crystal violet (CV), an
industrial wastewater product. After Fe3O4 nanoparticles immersed the GBC sur-
face, morphological and structural examination showed an increased surface area,
higher temperature stability, and establishment of plentiful functional groups. A
maximum qm value of 436.68 mg g1 at 40 C was reported. The dynamics of
functional groups, let’s say aromatic C¼C and C¼O, –OH, C–C, and π-π, played a
crucial role in the adsorption of CV. The thermodynamic investigation of isotherms
from Langmuir and Freundlich showed a spontaneous endothermic process. The CV
adsorbability of GBC-Fe3O4 recollected was 157.31 mg g1, which was marginally
lower than GBC-Fe3O4 (199 mg g1) freshly produced. These studies have shown
that GBC-Fe3O4 is an effective and recyclable multifunctional BC composite
(Du et al. 2020b). This study scrutinized the adsorption efﬁciency of LDH (NiZnFe)
148
S. S. Sutar et al.

and its composites (LDH-cnt and LDH-DPb) for the removal of RB5 dye from the
solution. In all instances, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model ﬁtted almost
closely to adsorption data. A strong correlation was noted with the adsorption
experiment data utilizing the Elovich kinetic model, thereby indicating a heteroge-
neous exterior of this adsorbent via chemisorption. Compared favorably to several
other adsorbents, the impact of solution temperature was signiﬁcantly higher for
LDH-cnt, whereas a marginal improvement of ~2% in sorption capability and
percentage removal was reported for LDH-DPb as the temperature of the solution
escalated from 30 to 60 C. Furthermore, the positive values of ΔH and ΔS were the
maximum for plain LDH (NiZnFe), and, despite the negative values of ΔG, a
non-spontaneous reaction of the adsorption of RB5 dye on plain LDH and hybrid
adsorbents is stated. In addition, they reported an almost proper ﬁt of the Langmuir
model to the equilibrium data, indicating the monolayer coverage of RB5 dye on
LDH (NiZnFe) or composite adsorbents (Amin et al. 2020).
Using

between

compositions, a single-mixing route for the production of GO-AC structural absor-
bent has been successfully executed. The GO-AC composite absorbent has been
used to eliminate cationic dyes as an effective adsorbent, e.g., MB and CV, from
water bodies that have been polluted. Results indicated that m-AC was integrated
into GO and enhanced the thermal resilience of the resulting GO-AC composite
(over ~600 C). Analogously, AC integration has made the GO-AC structural
framework appear to be a strong surface structure that improves the composite’s
adsorption effectiveness. Expanding the contact time and composite concentration
have increased the rate of dye adsorption of MB and CV, whereas elevated dye
concentration and NaCl concentration have noticed unpredictable adsorption activ-
ity. The isotherms of adsorption are suited by the equation of the Langmuir model.
The pseudo-second-order kinetics for the composite GO-AC correctly represented
the kinetics of adsorption. These ﬁndings, therefore, indicate that GO-AC composite
is a possible low-cost adsorbent for the abatement of dye from textile wastes and
polluted bodies of wastewater. In the scenario of MB dye, the GO-AC composite’s
desorption/reusability is more effective than in the context of CV dye (Abd-Elhamid
et al. 2019). Dil et al. (2016) analysis addresses the extraction by ultrasound-aided
adsorption of crystal violet dye solution employing zinc oxide nanorods armed as an
adsorbent on synthesized BC. Zinc oxide nanorods were primed and ﬁlled with BC
in this analysis. The use of zinc oxide nanorods has been found to be an effective,
rapid, and inexpensive method of adsorption for CV extraction. Experimental
system design has examined the impacts of process parameters on the percentage
of CV elimination. The equilibrium data suited Langmuir pretty well. The adsorption
rate was proven to obey the kinetic model of the pseudo-second order (Dil et al.
2016).
7.4.1.2 Metal Oxides and MOFs
A carbon magnetic nanocomposite (SnFe2O4@BC) was effectively produced
employing a coprecipitation process and was used to adsorb CV from aqueous.
The existence of stannous ferrite does not contribute to major decreases in the
7

149

surface area, and thus the porosity of the BC has retained its high adsorption
properties. The adsorbent has demonstrated substantial CV extraction and a high
95% elimination at a low concentration of 25 mg L1. The adsorption was done
corresponding to the pH, and a higher extraction was reported to be pH 8.0. The
extraction mechanism was dominated by the kinetic model of the pseudo-second
order. The adsorption isothermic data shows that the Langmuir isothermic model is
used to adsorb the CV. The magnetic nanocomposite adsorption potential increased
from 105.26 to 158.73 mg g1 with a rise in temperature of 303–323 K. The
thermodynamic research ﬁndings illustrated that adsorption is an endothermic and
spontaneous process. The ﬁndings reported that a strong, efﬁcient adsorbent could
be employed to extract CV from an aqueous solution using the SnFe2O4@magnetic
BC nanocomposite (Rai et al. 2015).
In this piece, the composite CoFe2O4/BC has been synthesized and employed as
an adsorbent for extracting GV (gentian violet) from the liquid solution. The
adsorption capacity of GV was determined by the initial concentration, time of
interaction, BC concentration, and solution pH. Results of equilibrium adsorption
suit the Langmuir model suggesting a monolayer adsorption mechanism. GV’s
notable adsorption potential on CoFe2O4/BC was due to a signiﬁcant bonding,
namely, π-π and low electrostatic interaction between GV and CoFe2O4/BC. The
mechanism of adsorption was well represented by the kinetic pseudo-second-order
model. The entire process of adsorption was regulated collectively by exogenous
mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion. The negative ΔG and positive ΔH
suggested that CoFe2O4/BC adsorption of GV was spontaneous and endothermic
in existence. The CoFe2O4/BC with low cost and high adsorption potential can be an
efﬁcient adsorbent product for wastewater extraction of GV (Liang et al. 2019).
The current research study shows the increase in OP (orange peel) adsorption
efﬁciency for segregation of CV from aqueous solutions upon magnetization.
Adsorption of CV showed to rely on reaction operation factors such as adsorbent/
adsorbate concentration, contact time, solution pH, and the process temperature.
Isothermal and kinetic experiments for both have shown that the experimental
adsorption results were conﬁrmed for Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order
kinetic models. The peak monolayer MOP adsorption (555.6 mg g1) potential was
marginally higher than OP adsorption capacity (138.9 mg g1). CV decoloration was
primarily observed by the chemisorption process with the concurrent involvement of
the physical force of attraction. The thermodynamic analysis showed that the
adsorption was spontaneous, and the MOP had heat adsorption and entropy upsurge.
The CV adsorption analysis from MOP has been found to be optimum with
hydrochloric acid, and up to ﬁve adsorption/desorption cycles have superior regen-
erative potential. The current survey asserts that MOP is unique, cost-effective, and
efﬁcient to extract dyes from wastewater (Ahmed et al. 2020).
For the efﬁcient adsorption of methylene blue in an aqueous mixture, carbonized
kelp BC (AKB) was amended by KOH, and photocatalytic Bi2MoO6/AKB compos-
ite (BKBC) nanomaterials have been formulated. The excellent dye adsorption
efﬁciency of this composite may certainly be due to its large speciﬁc surface area
(507.177 m2 g1) and its pervasive prevalence of different functional groups, for

instance, –OH and ¼C-H. In the interim, experimental evidence showed that
adsorption kinetics aligned perfectly with the pseudo-second-order model. Its suc-
cessful adsorption and photodegradation operation revealed its immense promise in
wastewater treatment (Zhou et al. 2018). In this novel report, composite materials
with various AC ratios (2.5 and 10% wt) activated carbon (AC)/metal-organic frame
(MIL-101(Cr)) have been produced and employed to extract dyes from wastewater,
leveraging historic RSM data models. The related dynamics of the adsorption
mechanism are the weak π-π bonding and strong electrostatic attachment between
the positive surface charge of AC/MIL-101(Cr) 5% and the negative charge of dye as
a powerful dipole force. The amplitude of active surface sites improved as the
adsorptive speciﬁc area expanded by raising the quantity of adsorbent dose. As the
initial concentration of dye is minimal, the pores of adsorbents adsorb the dye
efﬁciently on the adsorbent’s surface, and equilibrium contact time becomes very
short. Enhancement in dye decolorization was rendered by the volume of dye
extraction at the acidic pH attributable to the more positive charge density of the
adsorbent. The equilibrium data is well suited to the isothermal model of Langmuir.
The ﬁndings collected conﬁrmed that the best ﬁt model for this adsorption was the
pseudo-second order (Mahmoodi et al. 2019). Using the terephthalic acid linker and
FeCl3, the MIL-53-Fe metal-organic framework (MOF) was developed into an
already processed, magnetic, adsorbent Douglas ﬁr BC/Fe3O4 (MBC). To extract
and stimulate the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (Rh B) both with and without
Cr6+ introduction, this resultant triphase hybrid, multifunctional, magnetically
retrievable, adsorptive, photocatalytic, and degradative, adsorbent (MOF-MBC)
was employed. This adsorption pursued pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir
isotherm model for equilibrium data intimating monolayer adsorption. In Rh B
sorption, electrostatic and π-π stacking interactions are assumed to perform a crucial
role (Navarathna et al. 2020).
7.4.2
Natural Materials
Over the last 10 years, adsorbents derived from natural sources have piqued the
scientiﬁc community’s interest in utilizing these materials in adsorption techniques.
There are numerous natural materials that have adsorbent properties and are found in
signiﬁcant amounts, but among them, siliceous materials, zeolites, clays, and their
composites have been efﬁciently engaged to extract dyes from wastewater (Singh
et al. 2018). The minerals in natural clay comprise bentonite, montmorillonite
(MMT), kaolinite (KLN), sepiolite, saponite, vermiculite (VMT), zeolite, chlorite,
etc. that predominantly occur as hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates together with
magnesium, iron, alkali metals, and many other cations (Han et al. 2019). Some of
the vital physicochemical characteristics of clay minerals encompass their surface
chemistry, high surface area, particle type and size, lamellar structure, and high ion
exchange capacity, making them substantial in removing a number of organic
pollutants embracing dyes (Yao et al. 2014). Silica has been fetching noteworthy
attraction as a modern BC modiﬁer. Silica particles possess a hydrophilic surface

because of the presence of silanol groups. The groups are weakly acidic and reactive,
enabling the silica surface to be modiﬁed chemically and form composites. Silica
was identiﬁed to mend the BC’s carbon stability and decrease the bioaccumulation
of contaminants. Nonetheless, natural adsorbents still need comprehensive treatment
in order to achieve their most effective adsorbent form.
Hydrogels are three-dimensional cross-linked networks that can be polymerized
using water-soluble polymers or monomers to form the gel solution by physical or
chemical cross-linking. This synthesis of the hydrogel is known as “inotropic
gelation.” The speciﬁc features of hydrogels, for instance, desired functionality,
reversibility, and biocompatibility, fulﬁll both material and biological needs. Hydro-
gel adsorbents display super high and rapid adsorption efﬁciency, pH independence,
water afﬁnity, ease of use, relatively high porosity, diverse morphology, and ﬂexible
magnitudes and can therefore be preferred as a substitute for dye removal (Du et al.
2020a). The fact that hydrogels are facilely manufactured from natural and synthetic
polymers is another signiﬁcant beneﬁt. Besides, the entrapment of various ﬁllers on
the hydrogel matrix creates composite materials with excellent and improved ther-
mal stability, chemical resistance, mechanical characteristics, and adsorption capa-
bility. In recent years, hydrogel-composite preparation has fetched substantial
interest in environmental remediation applications comprising wastewater treatment.
Hydrogels have been commonly used in dye remediation in recent decades; never-
theless, the low mechanical strength restricts their usage in removing dye
contaminants due to the hostile environment through the wastewater treatment
procedure. Hence, adequate reinforcing agents or ﬁllers must be developed into
hydrogel grids to escalate their mechanical strength (Du et al. 2020a).
BC has been demonstrated to be a very powerful dye removal adsorbent. Despite
the fact that the chemical compositions and structures of BCs are very diverse, they
have many disadvantages to being applied as a sole adsorbent, for instance, limited
functionality and low anti-interference capacity. All these mentioned disadvantages
led to restricted applications of BC in dye remediation. In view of this, researchers
have proposed a range of modiﬁcation methodologies to boost the adsorption
capacity of BC. The methodologies comprise the acid-modiﬁed process, alkali-
modiﬁed method, and several other modiﬁcations approach to minimize the cost
of BC adsorbents and mend their sorption capability for pollutants and further extend
the applications in the environmental pollution control (Chen et al. 2018), but
considering adsorption capability we need some modiﬁcations. BC is a cheaper
material that needs to be combined to fabricate novel adsorbents without losing their
adsorbent ability (Laysandra et al. 2018). So far, a variety of BC-based composites,
including nanomaterials, metal oxides, carbonated materials, MOF, natural sources,
etc., have been developed as described in the earlier section. Here, we will discuss
the dye adsorption strategies based on BC composites impregnated with natural
materials, like clays, silica, and hydrogels. The adsorption ability of clay, silica,
hydrogels, and BC can be amended by synthesizing a composite of these materials.
The BC has a decent porous structure and functional groups; therefore, adding clay
and silica to the BC upsurges the surface area and exchangeability, thereby boosting
the adsorption capacity. Moreover, BC-based materials can also be trapped in the

hydrogel and applied to the adsorption process. As an elucidation for the twofold
water absorption, the physical and covalent linkage within the BC/hydrogel com-
posite may be anticipated to coexist. Here hydrogel plays a role as scaffold support
for BC, maintaining its original functional characteristics.
Earlier attempts were made by Yao et al. (2014) who developed a low-cost
adsorbent by engineering a new BC for the adsorption of methylene blue
(MB) dye with clay particles scattered on carbon surfaces inside the BC matrix.
The BC composite has been developed using the use of MMT and/or kaolin clay,
modiﬁed by the use of three biomass feedstocks: bagasse (BG), bamboo (BB), and
hickory chips (HC). Physicochemical characterizations, comprising microscopy and
X-ray investigations, established that clay particles were present on the BC surface
and all the BC samples had large surface areas. Adsorption experiments have
revealed that the existence of clay particles on carbon surfaces has signiﬁcantly
augmented (almost ﬁve times) the BC’s MB adsorption capability. The experimental
results have demonstrated that MB sorption on the clay-BC composite was regulated
primarily by ion exchange mechanisms (with clay) and electrostatic attraction (with
BC). The kinetic study has revealed that the sorption mechanism could be regulated
by multiple mechanisms and strongly inﬂuenced by the intraparticle diffusion
mechanism, and Ritchie nth-order and Elovich model kinetics were accompanied.
The isotherm results showed that the MMT modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly augmented the
BG-MMT MB sorption capacity, and the isotherm models Freundlich and Redlich-
Peterson ﬁtted better. MB sorption is therefore on a heterogeneous surface, and the
process is regulated by several mechanisms consistent with the ﬁndings of the
kinetic analysis. Later on, Reactive Brilliant Red X-3B (RBR) adsorption by bagasse
clay-BC composites and naturally occurring at pulgite (ATP) was subsequently
analyzed (Chen et al. 2018). The adsorption data exhibited a strong correlation
with the isotherm Langmuir model, and the kinetic data were ﬁtted into the pseudo-
second-order model. The adsorption mechanism was due to the surface coverage and
monolayer formation. The pseudo-second-order model denotes that the adsorption
mechanism was the rate-limiting step encompassing valence forces via sharing or
exchanging electrons between BC and RBR. These ﬁndings suggested that RBR
adsorption on clay-BC involved electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π
interactions, and surface involvement. ATP and bagasse employed a synergistic
effect on the adsorption of RBR.
MB adsorption in an aqueous solution was scrutinized using state-of-the-art
composite ball-milled BC (BMB) encapsulated in beads (CA-BMB) of calcium
alginate (Wang et al. 2019). Sorption efﬁciency was compared with batch adsorption
experiments between CA, BMB, and CA-BMB composites. The kinetic adsorption
was well elucidated by Ritchie’s kinetic model, which showed adsorption on
energetically homogeneous solid surfaces by physical sorption. BMB, CA, and
CA-BMB adsorption isotherms were well ﬁtted with the Langmuir models
displaying substantial changes in BMB’s MB adsorption after being cross-linked
with CA. The best ﬁt with the Langmuir equation might signify that the MB
adsorption phenomenon was monolayer adsorption, probable to be accomplished

(1210.7 mg g1) adsorption was in close proximity with CA (1282.2 mg g1) and
much more signiﬁcant than BMB alone (184.1 mg g1). Further, the impact of
macroalgae (Saccharina japonica) (kelp) bentonite mineral co-pyrolysis on physi-
cochemical characteristics and bentonite/BC composite’s ability for cationic
(CV) and anionic (Congo red) dye removal has been examined (Sewu et al.
2019b). CR and CV dye adsorption was investigated using mathematical
expressions by comparing bentonite/BC composites with stand-alone pyrolysis of
kelp and bentonite. The key adsorption was chemisorption up to the micropores and
mesopores with a boundary layer value which indicated that the CV adsorption was
subjected to mechanisms other than intraparticle diffusion. The mechanism of
adsorption involved hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, ion exchanges,
and the interaction between the π-π and n-π.
Recently, the preparation of silica-composited BCs from alkali-fused ﬂy ash
(AFFA) and agricultural wastes (swine manure and rice straw) for boosted adsorp-
tion of MB has been performed (Wang et al. 2020a). After pyrolysis, the two
different silica-composited BCs were synthesized (AFFA/SWB and AFFA/RSB)
with alkaline-fused ﬂy ash (AFFA). The MB adsorption potential of the modiﬁed
BCs proportionally augmented considerably after the solution’s pH escalated from
3 to 13. The adsorption data were well represented with pseudo-second-order model
kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. The kinetic analysis indicated that the adsorption of
MB on the two AFFA-modiﬁed BCs comprised multiple adsorption mechanisms
(surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion). The isotherm analysis revealed that
both modiﬁed BCs had equally distributed surface adsorption sites. The maximum
MB adsorption capacities were 143.76 mg g1 and 131.58 mg g1 for AFFA/SWB
and AFFA/RSB, respectively. Finally, Biswas et al. (2020) designed and developed
a unique strategy based on a semi-ﬂuidized batch and continuous circuit bed for
removing MB dye using bagasse BC (SB) entrapped in calcium alginate (CASB).
The kinetics of MB adsorption demonstrated that 70% removal of MB could be
achieved within 30 min. The sorption kinetic modeling displayed strong agreement
with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Chemisorption was involved in the dye
adsorption mechanism between the SB adsorbent. Concurrently the external mass
transfer is accompanied by liquid ﬁlm and intraparticle diffusion. The isotherm
model Langmuir indicated a superior ﬁt over Freundlich. Thermodynamics studies
eventually indicated that the mechanism was irreversible and endothermic. Table 7.1
illustrates all the composite materials based on BC.
7.5
External Factors Affecting Adsorption Reaction
BC works in immensely precise conditions as an adsorbent. pH and temperature of
the solution, and initial concentrations of adsorbate, adsorbent concentration, etc.,
determine the rate of adsorption and play a vital role in deﬁning the efﬁcacy of BC.
154

7.5.1
pH
One key parameter which has been established to persistently impact the manner BC
is utilized as an adsorbent is pH. In the majority of studies, pH changes lead to
signiﬁcant effects on adsorption procedures (Srivatsav et al. 2020). The pH of the
aqueous solution has been reported to affect the sorption of contaminants into
BC. This is associated with the pH-dependent functional groups that contain oxygen.
The surface charge and ionization of the surface of BC are therefore pH-dependent,
thus distinguishing the adsorption capability to remove dye contaminants. When the
pH of the aqueous solution upsurges, the functional groups are deprotonated. This
causes an escalation in BC’s sorption capability to cationic metals. Though the pH
drops, the electrostatic repulsion forces between the dye and metal ions in the
aqueous solution have surged. Subsequently, competition can arise between cations
for BC adsorption sites, ensuing in reducing metal ion adsorbent material capability
(Ambaye et al. 2020). The pH at zero-point change (pHzpc), a point where net
charges on the surface of any adsorbent in solution turn out to be neutral, is also
affecting the absorption efﬁciency of the active BC surface by supplying active
functional groups to chemicals in water (Gautam et al. 2021).
In a study conducted by Adekola et al. (2019), it has been observed that the
adsorption percentage augmented with elevated pH and reached maximum at pH 7,
but then reduced moderately. Protonation of the adsorbent surface was reported to
occur at low pH, and as a result, a repulsion was observed between the cationic dye
Rhodamine B (RhB) and adsorbent surface with a positive charge. With the aug-
mented solution pH, the adsorbent surface was constantly deprotonated. The adsorp-
tion was escalated owing to the attraction between the negatively charged adsorbent
surface and cationic dye. An equivalent trend was observed in the research by other
researchers, Yek et al. (2020), which scrutinized an impact of various operational
factors on the adsorption of CR dye utilizing BC made from organic peel waste. It
was detected that acid conditions persisted when pH was between 2 and 3 and the
presence of H+ ions facilitated to adsorb CR dye onto active sites of
BC. Simultaneously, alkaline conditions prevailed over a pH of greater than 7, and
the occurrence of OH ions impeded dye adsorption onto the BC by competing for
the BC active sites. On the other hand, an opposite trend has been observed in the
experiment on methyl violet (MV) dye adsorption with chitin-derived BC performed
by Zazycki et al. (2019). For pH levels >6, the adsorption of dye was preferred, and
the trend was perceived attributable to the fact that the concentration of the H+ ions is
substantial at a very low pH, and they compete for the active adsorption sites on the
BC with the MV dye, consequently alleviating the dye removal percentage.
From the abovementioned results, it has been recognized that the nature of the
dye acts as a catalyst in establishing the optimal pH of adsorption. The acidic pH
(<2) is favored when a dye is anionic since the surface of the adsorbent is positive on
account of augmented H+ ions and electrostatically favors anionic dye attraction, and
when the dye is cationic, the rising pH (>2) is triggered by the presence of OH
ions, which alternatingly results in negative BC surface by stimulating the
7

155

electrostatic attraction between the positively charged dye and the negatively
charged BC surface (Sewu et al. 2019a).
7.5.2
Temperature
Adsorption reactions are either exothermic or endothermic reactions; thus, tempera-
ture plays a fundamental role in the dye adsorption mechanism. An experiment
examined the effects of factors like the adsorbent concentration, pH, and temperature
on the adsorption characteristics of MB dye from the aqueous solution into sludge-
derived BC (Fan et al. 2017). It was observed that a rise in the temperature boosted
the maximum adsorption capacity, signifying that an escalation in operating temper-
ature improved the adsorption behavior, which can be elucidated by the endothermic
reaction of the MB adsorption on BC. In addition, Wang et al. (2020b) also found the
same results. They observed an escalation in the adsorption capacity for acridine
orange (AO) by NiAl-layered double oxide-modiﬁed magnetic corncob BC
(MC1/NiAl-LDO) with an increase in the temperature. In another study conducted
by Yang et al. (2014), where the estimation of adsorption capability of bamboo BC
for metal-complex dye was performed, the same trend was observed. The adsorption
capacity augmented with temperatures from 20 to 40
C for the tested dye
concentrations. It was suggested that the temperature effects could be ascribed to
the reduction in the viscosity of the solution with the temperature rise. The tempera-
ture with a relative importance of 28.67% seemed to be the most impactful adsorp-
tion parameter by the artiﬁcial neural network. In contrast, Chen et al. (2019a, b)
conducted adsorption studies of four dyes, viz., Direct Red (DR), Acid Orange II
(AO), React Blue 19 (RB), and methylene blue (MB), using sludge-rice husk BC
(SRHB) and noticed that the adsorption capabilities augmented with the escalating
temperature in the case of RB and MB, whereas the adsorption of DR and AO onto
SRHB was exothermic, the adsorption capacities reduced accompanied by the rising
temperature. It can be concluded that the dye molecules have enough energy at
higher temperatures to interact with the surface of BC. Into the bargain, increasing
temperatures also attenuate the viscosity and diffusion of dye molecules via the
external surface and inner pores of the material.
7.5.3
Adsorbent Concentration
The amount of BC also affects the adsorption capacity and is the chief factor to be
taken into account. In a dye adsorption study with wet-torreﬁed microalgal BC, the
percentage of removal and adsorption capacity was strongly affected by the adsor-
bent dose. Even with a slight upsurge in adsorbent dosage, the removal rate was
substantially augmented (approx. 80% higher) and remained constant after a speciﬁc
highest dosage was achieved. The authors (Yu et al. 2021) claimed that this
phenomenon was owing to the fact that at maximum doses of adsorbent, the number
of active sites and the adsorption surface area were dramatically escalated, which
156
S. S. Sutar et al.

successively enhanced the percentages of the dye removal from water. The magniﬁ-
cation in the dye removal rate was attributable to the upsurge in adsorbent doses,
which ampliﬁed active sites for both the adsorption and the adsorbent surface area.
Nonetheless, after a certain dosage of the BC, the dye adsorption rate remained
constant as a consequence of the reduction in dye molecules adsorbed per unit mass
of adsorbent (Nautiyal et al. 2016). Thus, the general removal efﬁciency of dye by
BC will not be altered once a point of equilibrium is attained. High BC
concentrations have a positive effect on dye removal. The optimal dose is therefore
useful, as it is a fundamental parameter in reducing the cost of BC industrial
production.
7.5.4
Initial Dye Concentration
The initial dye concentration could be associated with an adsorbent’s adsorption
capacity. Overall, with the rise in initial dye concentrations, the removal percentage
drops as long as the active site on the adsorbent surface is saturated, while with the
upsurge in initial dye concentration, the removal percentage augments in case if the
active site is unsaturated where the maximum concentration of dye will act as a
catalyst for mass transfer toward adsorption. It was reported that when the initial dye
concentration rose from 5 to 360 mg L1, the removal percentage of MB reduced
from 89.78 to 26.32%. An analogous trend has been detected in CR adsorption
where the removal rate was dropped from 97.10% to 54.72% when the initial
concentration of the dye augmented from 10 to 550 mg L1 (Yu et al. 2021); there
are examples in which the rise in dye levels ultimately increased the BC adsorption
potential until an equilibrium is attained, beyond which no further adsorption was
detected as dye molecules have occupied all the active sites entirely in the BC
surface leaving no more space for adsorption (Wang et al. 2020a).
7.6
Adsorption Mechanism
7.6.1
Physisorption
Four forms of physical interactions (van der Waals forces, π-π interactions, hydro-
phobic interaction, and hydrogen bonding) accelerate the adsorption process. Van
der Waals forces occur between each form of adsorbent and dye molecule. The wide
surface area and porosity of BC favor the adsorption of dyes by van der Waals
forces. As one of the most frequently used adsorbents, BC has a signiﬁcant volume
of sp2-hybridated carbon and a two-dimensional framework in its structural compo-
sition. Various functional groups have been triggered to the carbon surface to
enhance adsorption efﬁciency. For instance, conjugation systems such as amide,
ester, aldehyde, and acetyl in BC may involve dipole-dipole associations with dyes.
The separation of van der Waals forces is difﬁcult to accomplish. Traditional
methods for the recycling of BC comprise, in particular, thermal, biological, and
7
Recent Advances in Biochar-Based Dye Remediation
157

solvent treatment. Whereas several innovative products have also been documented
for the removal of BC regeneration, like wet oxidative regeneration, microwave
radiation exposure, and electrochemical regeneration, these methods are costly, lead
to signiﬁcant alterations in physical structures, or cause signiﬁcant carbon deteriora-
tion. Aromatic rings in dyes and adsorbents could generate enticing non-covalent
associations, i.e., stacking. Off-centered parallel and T-shaped arrangements are two
major notions of this kind of stacking. Electrostatic interaction is identiﬁed as the key
CR mechanism in which the interaction of π-π dispersion is controlled by CR
adsorption (Yang et al. 2016). The associated dynamics of the adsorption mecha-
nism were the weak binding of π-π and the intense electrostatic binding between the
positive surface charge of AC/MIL-101(Cr) 5% and the negative dye charge as an
effective dipole force (Mahmoodi et al. 2019). It isn’t easy to distinguish such
interactions since they are very strong interactions. Hydrophobic contact occurs
commonly between BC and respective dyes despite the hydrophilicity or
hydrophobicity of BC. This kind of interaction is generally dependent on shifts in
the entropy. The sorption of dyes into BC reduces the interaction between the dyes
and the underlying solution and produces free water from the hydration shell of the
dyes. Adsorption is thermodynamically worthwhile due to hydrophobic cooperation.
While the hydrophobic association is necessary for the adsorption of dyes to BC
adsorbent, it is often used to describe the process of adsorption. On the premise of
such a process, the inclusion or elimination of free water from the dye hydration shell
may enable to regulate its adsorption and desorption mechanism. The key associa-
tion between dyes and adsorbents is unlikely in most cases due to the hydrogen
bonding between anionic dyes and water. Dyes are more dispersible in the water
when there is no other force for adsorption. Popular contenders to establish hydrogen
bonding with dyes are functional groups such as nonaromatic hydroxyl or those
containing heteroatoms with lone pair electrons in BC adsorbent. It was advanta-
geous to build up hydrogen bonds with RB molecules when the solution pH was in
the frame of pKa, –OH, and –COOH on the exterior of EMC. When the value of
solution pH elevated to be higher than 7 (basic condition), –OH and –COOH were
ionized as –O and –COO. As a result, these ionized groups not only repulsed –
COO but also enticed N+ in RB molecules based on electrostatic forces. Oxygen-
containing functional domains on the exterior of EMCs, therefore, portrayed a key
role in the adsorption of RB, relying on ion exchange, hydrogen bonding, and
electrostatic attraction interactions (Shen et al. 2017). An overall depiction of
adsorption mechanism is represented in Fig. 7.2.
AC and NAC have dynamic charges arising from the solution’s adsorption of
ions, such as H+ or OH. For pH levels below the zero-load point, Sur-OH + H3O+
gives Sur-OH2
+ + H2O, and for pH levels above the zero-load point, Sur-OH + OH
gives Sur-O + H2O. The peak transition in the NAC spectrum suggested that a
signiﬁcant factor in MB adsorption on NAC was exerted by bonded –OH groups in
particular. As per the FTIR spectra and the pH adsorption reliance of methylene blue
(MB), electrostatic (columbic) repulsion was observed between MB and the positive
charge on the AC and NAC exterior at pH below 3 (i.e., pH  3) (Sur-OH2
+ + MB),
while for pH levels above 3 (pH  3), electrostatic (columbic) attraction was
158
S. S. Sutar et al.

ascertained between MB and the negative charge on the AC and MB surface
(Bouguettoucha et al. 2016).
7.6.2
Chemisorption
The chemical bonding established in adsorption is covalent. This force of adsorption
is often supplied by BC; dyes may create complexes with inorganic compounds such
as metal oxides or metal hydroxides. Within aqueous environments, the main
operational groups which bind to the exterior of metal oxides or metal hydroxides
are hydroxyl groups (Rai et al. 2015). Through concurrent acidic or basic dissocia-
tion at the solid-liquid interface, metal-hydroxide complexes assemble in such a
manner, giving positive or negative charges to the exterior of the complexes (Liang
et al. 2019). Between the positively charged exterior of metal complexes and the
negatively charged sulfonic groups of anionic dyes, strong electrostatic attraction
occurs at low pH values and forms dye-metal complexes by covalent bonding
(Nassar 2010). Dissociation of the dye-metal complexes may also be challenging,
contributing to lesser efﬁciency of desorption and thus low adsorbent recyclability.
7.7
BC Regeneration
Adsorbent regeneration is one of the fundamental parameters for the practical
application of BC and is very crucial for the enhancement of the adsorption process
and economic viability. Regeneration of BC is a reverse adsorption operation, and it
Fig. 7.2 The adsorption mechanism of dye on BC

Recent Advances in Biochar-Based Dye Remediation
159

has two basic principles, viz., adsorbate desorption and adsorbate decomposition. A
competitive adsorbent must exhibit a top-notch recyclable potential for industrial
applications and be able to greatly decrease the BC adsorbent cost as a repetitive
sorption-desorption cycle. Not only does recycling the adsorbent save money, but it
also
eliminates
secondary
environmental
pollutants.
Several
regeneration
techniques, including thermal, solvent, electrochemical, ultrasonic, microwave irra-
diation, supercritical ﬂuid regeneration, etc., have been reported, but the most
commonly utilized cost-efﬁcient approach in industrial and wastewater treatment
plants is thermal regeneration.
BC produced from brown seaweed Turbinaria conoides was used to adsorb
Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBB), and the regeneration experiments have been
conducted to investigate the feasibility for three RBB sorting-elution cycles to
recycle the same sorbent. BC displayed the ability in all successive cycles to
maintain its ﬁrst-cycle RBB-sorption potential. At the end of the third cycle, the
loss of BC weight was 9.5%. In contrast to the ﬁrst cycle, the reduction in RBB
elimination at the end of the third cycle was just 13.5% (Vijayaraghavan and
Ashokkumar 2019). In the calcium-rich BC (CRB)-mediated CR and MG adsorption
study, the regeneration experiment was repeated for ﬁve cycles to assess the regen-
eration capacity of the used BC using ethanol washing (Dai et al. 2018). With
augmented adsorption cycles, CRB’s adsorption efﬁciency progressively declined,
which could be either due to a fractional recovery of dye-adsorbed CRB after
centrifugation or fractional recovery of active sites available following ethanol
washing after recycling. It was imperative to notice that the adsorption potential
for MG and CR was as high as >3500 and >6000 mg g1, correspondingly, after
ﬁve adsorption cycles. Hence, despite the much lower adsorption potential than that
of the original CRB, the regenerated CRB was still superlative over the rest of the
adsorbents in dye adsorption. Lian et al. (2016) employed two different techniques,
speciﬁcally direct combustion and desorption, to recycle the dye-adsorbed N-doped
microporous BC (NBC800-3) with 60% ethanol. After ﬁve adsorption/combustion
cycles, NBC800-3 was observed to retain up to 65% of its original adsorption
potential. Concurrently, only a minor mass loss of NBC800-3 occurred owing to
its high thermal stability for each cycle.
Guo et al. (2020) performed MB adsorption from an aqueous solution using
Michelia ﬁgo (MFL)-BC and studied recycling of used adsorbents with an
eco-friendly thermal process. It was noted that, even after three successive thermal
treatments, the recycled MFL had an adsorption potential of about 139.4 mg g1.
The regeneration study concluded that MFL and MFL-BC presented stable and
effective recycling efﬁciency throughout the thermal regeneration method. The
liberation of volatile components through carbonization facilitated the expansion
of a speciﬁc area of the regenerated MFL-BC, which stimulated the adsorption
potential of the regenerated MFL-BC. The regeneration efﬁcacy could also have
been boosted by π-π interactions as the recycled MFL-BC contained distinct BC
graphene layers that might interact with dye molecules. Cassava slag BC (HCS)
demonstrated exceptional adsorption recycling potential performed with sodium
hydroxide (NaOH). It was revealed that the removal rate of Rhodamine B (RBB)
160
S. S. Sutar et al.

by HCS was 93% after ﬁve cycles of NaOH regeneration, signifying remarkable
regeneration efﬁciency (Wu et al. 2020). In a recent study on Cocos nucifera shell,
the BC (CSB)-mediated removal of the basic dyes Blue 41 (BB41) and Basic Red
09 (BR09) was examined for their ability to adsorb BB41 and BR09 by different
elutants such as 0.01 M of NaOH, hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4),
and deionized water. The method of sorption-elution was repeated to establish the
regeneration efﬁciency of the sorbent. Of the three acidic elutants, 0.01 M HCl
performed better for cationic dyes with an efﬁciency of 99.4%. After following
several cycles, CSB displayed its capability to retain the ﬁrst-cycle dye sorption.
Successful recycling of used adsorbents possibly will aid in reducing the usage of
chemicals by conﬁrming environmental sustainability and to upsurge adsorption
potential and economic viability (Saravanan et al. 2020).
7.8
Benefits and Drawbacks of Using BC at an Industrial Scale
The most enticing aspect of BC is that it embodies a low-cost, sustainable, and easily
manufactured procedure with large-scale applications relatively cheaper than the
products from other chemical approaches. As an adsorbent, BC embraces numerous
beneﬁts, for instance, being environmentally friendly, inexpensive, easy to use, high
surface area and microporosity, electrical conductivity, recalcitrance, and tensile
strength. Plenty of precursors are available for transformation into BC and possess
recyclability and high adsorption potential than other traditional adsorbents. BC also
has environmental advantages and fewer environmental impacts than other
adsorbents, such as activated carbon, predominantly as a consequence of carbon
sequestration and energy generation throughout pyrolysis (Thompson et al. 2016).
BC encompasses a signiﬁcant number of residual functional groups, for example,
carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups, on its graphitic backbone. Many of these
functional groups are oxygen-containing or alkaline and offer BC a strong adsorp-
tion potential, hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, buffering, and ion exchange capa-
bility, typically referred to as “cation exchange potential” (Chen et al. 2019a). All
these abovementioned unique characteristics make them an ideal candidate for
industrial applications compared to several other adsorbents.
It is reported that BC has a great potential for industrial application, but the usage
of BC has some disadvantages. In most studies, BC is utilized under extremely
precise dosage conditions, pH, temperature, etc. that decide how the process is
performed. Consequently, successive stages are essential to eliminate the BC from
wastewater prior to reuse in other applications that can raise treatment costs. Some
reports have revealed that the efﬁcacy of BC reduced after its repeated use of an
adsorbent in the removal of dyes (Tran 2020). Hence, it is observed that BC, as an
adsorbent, might entail auxiliary desorption practices and could possibly result in
economic disadvantages. The most widely used BCs comprise large amounts of
heavy metals; thus, immoderate desorption of these heavy metals raises the possibil-
ity of environmental pollution. It was identiﬁed that potentially toxic compounds,

hydrocarbons
(PAHs),

metals,

metalloids, inexorably form an association with BC (Tan et al. 2015). Odinga et al.
(2020) further scrutinized the effects of environmentally persistent free radicals in
BCs on soil and wastewater. It was observed that free radicals could cause a greater
threat to the environment unless scrutinized and regulated. On a concluding note,
prior to extending the use of BC in practice, possible detrimental effects linked with
the use of BC in aqueous substances must be addressed.
7.9
Conclusion and Future Perspectives
BC is an effective and low-cost adsorbent that can be made from a range of biomass
resources comprising residues of agricultural crops, forestry products, sewage
sludge, and manure and has been employed for the processing of wastewater. This
chapter discusses existing BC processing technologies with a focus on pretreatment
of raw materials, thermal transformation, and posttreatment techniques and also
explores the use of engineered BC for aquatic system dye processing and extraction.
Alteration changes BC’s surface characteristics (surface area, pore volume, pore
size, surface charge, and surface functional groups). Combined with BC, a variety of
modiﬁers have been used, such as clays, metals, metal oxides, and carbonaceous
substances (graphene, graphene oxide, and nanorods). Proportionally, the altering
factors show positive growth in adsorption ability but often negatively affect the
adsorption efﬁciency of the intended dyes. Therefore, further examinations include
the identiﬁcation of suitable modiﬁers for precise dye targeting. It can be achieved by
modifying the structure, especially the physical and chemical characteristics of
adsorbents. Climate effects may also be amended to increase the performance of
adsorption, particularly temperature maintenance.
The function of clay-BC composite materials as adsorbents in wastewater abate-
ment has not been thoroughly researched. Although the surface area is so often
decreased by blocking pores, the cumulative impact of BC and clay minerals
dramatically boosts the ability of clay-BC composites to adsorb dyes, particularly
when layered clays are coupled with BC. Further research would therefore be
required to improve the understanding of surface chemistry, adsorption mechanisms,
and variables affecting the adsorption potential of clay-BC composite materials
produced by clay minerals. In addition, a favorable end use may be the use of
waste clay materials such as red mud, steel slag, etc., with BC operation. In addition
to many pollutants, alteration of BC with metals or metal oxides has been
documented. The adsorption of an assigned contaminant was negatively affected
by certain triggers, prompting further scrutiny. For different implementations,
functionalized
BC
has
currently
been
successfully
introduced.
BC’s
functionalization method facilitates the modiﬁcation of its surface properties and
functionality and can therefore be implemented in different industrial processes.
Further to boost the functionality of various applications, the development of
functionalized BC-based composites is advised. Most experiments on adsorption
have been performed under laboratory settings. The natural atmosphere, moreover,
frequently varies drastically from the laboratory setting, especially with regard to
162

continuous pH and temperature variations, each of which has a major impact on the
adsorption of most of the adsorbents investigated. To evaluate the strength and
efﬁciency of BCs and their composites in wastewater management, pilot-scale
experimentation will therefore be critical. In addition, to determine the stability of
BC composites and assure their environmental sustainability, long-term inspections
are necessary. In conjunction, there is limited knowledge on the large-scale devel-
opment of engineered BCs, and it should be published. Another main endeavor that
will allow the assessment of the feasibility of BC-based remediation relative to other
methods accessible is the cost of production investigation.

Abstract
Textile industries use several types of synthetic toxic dyes having complex
aromatic structures that lead to detrimental effects on ecosystems. Discharge of
efﬂuent directly into the natural environment (soil and water) adversely affects
the biota. In recent years, different dye removal strategies have been adopted to
control textile pollution including physical, chemical, and biological methods.
Recently, exploring agro-industrial waste biomasses into biochar is being studied
as an economically sustainable approach for remediation of textile wastewater
and other environmental pollutants. Biochar is a black carbon produced after the
pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions. It is proving the best
adsorbent which offers advantages like high surface area, porosity, and active
functional groups important for the effective removal of organic and inorganic
contaminants. Biochar reduces the bioavailability of contaminants with additional
environmental beneﬁts including soil fertilizer and mitigation of climate change.
The present book chapter provides a brief outline of dye types and toxicity and
biochar preparation and characteristics with a detailed account of mechanism of
biochar-assisted remediation of hazardous textile dyes and wastewater.

Introduction
The developmental anthropogenic activities like manufacturing, transportation, and
construction produce a huge quantity of organic and inorganic pollutants which
rigorously affect the natural environment leading to air, soil, and water pollution.
Few examples demonstrated how human activities are liable to pollute the environ-
ment; excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides runoff from the agricultural ﬁeld, and
release of efﬂuents with additional harmful chemicals from various industries emit
offensive smell and pollute water bodies. This contaminated water is unsafe for
people and the environment (Dil et al. 2017). Environmental pollutants can be
classiﬁed as chemical, biological, and physical substances that are unwittingly
discharged into the natural ecosystem which are consequently injurious to the living
organism. Waterborne diseases and other health-related problems are mainly
associated with water pollution. The water-carrying pollutants were taken up by
aquatic organisms and could reach into the food chain. Thus consumption of such
foods adversely affects the body in terms of dry, rough skin and consequently
induces cancer-like diseases. However, owing to the valuable coloring properties,
an enormous amount of synthetic colors are utilized in diverse industries like paper,
food, leather, cosmetics, petrochemicals, and textile. The textile industry in India is
booming due to its economic inﬂuence on the manufacture and export of goods,
thereby leading to a large amount of contaminated water as a highly radioactive,
mutagenic, and carcinogenic efﬂuent (Ahmed et al. 2015). Throughout the world,
dye production is approximately 800,000 tons per annum. Among these 10–15% dye
is released as an efﬂuent which is mainly allied with incomplete exhaustion during
the dyeing process. Dyes are broadly classiﬁed into natural (indigoid dyes, ﬂavones,
anthraquinone, anthocyanidins, carotenoids, etc.) and synthetic dye (basic dye,
acidic dye, direct dye, azoic dye, dispersive dye, reactive dye, vat dye, mordant
dye, sulfur dye, etc.) depending on the source. Despite its widespread use in the
textile industry, it has also been used to monitor protozoa and fungal contamination
as a pH predictor, microbiological stain, and additives in medicine and aquaculture
(Schnick 1988; Moturi and Charya 2009). However, it is highly toxic to species,
which eventually decreases their growth, fertility rates, and food intake with holding
carcinogenic features (Culp et al. 1999). Nevertheless, for the survival of organisms,
water is an imperative element on earth. Water covers 71% of the earth’s surface, and
among those 97% are found in the ocean that can’t be used for irrigation and
drinking purpose. The remaining available freshwater is 3%; out of this 2.997%
water is fastened in glaciers. Thus, the access of water for irrigation and other
domestic usage is only 0.003%. This denotes water as an extremely valuable
resource. Hence, water pollution raising the scarcity of freshwater resources will
be a key factor affecting the ﬁnancial growth of various countries throughout the
170

world. These dye materials alter the water properties; therefore, scientists are given
the prime importance for exclusion of pollutants from the aqueous solution. Hence,
treating the efﬂuent containing toxic residual dyes was a crucial parameter to reduce
the risk of contaminants to the ecosystem. Several researchers have previously used
various
methods
of
decolorization
of
colorants,
such
as
biodegradation,
phytoremediation, adsorption, chemical precipitation, photolysis, electrochemical
treatment, chemical oxidation, and reduction (Jadhav et al. 2010). These decoloriza-
tion strategies, however, have a number of disadvantages, such as increased costs,
enormous sludge generation, high dissolved O2 requirements, and the development
of highly toxic intermediates such as leucomalachite (Bayramoglu et al. 2009).
However, adsorption is one of the more cost-effective approaches used for the
treatment of textile waste. Therefore, an exploration of the secret potential of biochar
extracted from agro-industrial waste biomass for higher dye sorption capability
reveals a sustainable cost-effective strategy for the treatment of polluted dye in the
wastewater. Biochar (BC) is nothing but the carbon-rich solid by-product formed by
heating to temperatures between 300 and 1000 C under oxygen-limiting conditions
after the carbonization of biomass (Lehmann and Joseph 2009). There are four main
areas including agricultural ﬁeld, waste management, climate change mitigation, and
energy production where biochar could be effectively adopted (Lehmann and Joseph
2009). Biochar has ideal physicochemical properties for the secure and long-term
retention of carbon in the atmosphere and, possibly, amendment of the soil. Mainly,
biochar consists of nutrient components and also has alkaline pH which offers
certain advantages not only in remediation but also in agronomical ﬁelds for yield
improvement via changing the physicochemical properties of soil (Blackwell et al.
2009). BC is a low-cost carbonate sorbent with a better ability to extract organic and
inorganic contaminants from the polluted site (Enaime et al. 2020). It is proving the
best adsorbent which offers advantages like high surface area, porosity, and active
functional groups important for the effective removal of organic and inorganic
contaminants. The upcoming phase toward a sustainable future will be the treatment
of wastewater for multiple treatments and resource recovery purposes, such as water,
nutrients, and electricity. However, biochar is the most widely used technique to
remove the pollutants and thus would be a better option to remove the wastewater
pollutants. Recently, several industrial toxic pollutants discharged as wastewater
have been efﬁciently sorbed by using biochar (Enaime et al. 2020). Thus, the present
book chapter provides a brief outline of dye types and toxicity and biochar prepara-
tion and characteristics with a detailed account of the mechanism of biochar-assisted
remediation of hazardous textile dyes and wastewater.
8.2
Pollution
Pollution is an unnatural shift in the climate that adversely affects the ecosystem,
including livestock, plants, and human beings. The population of India has increased
by approximately 1.3 billion people. Overexploitation of resources such as industri-
alization and certain anthropogenic activities has also been carried out to the
8

171

detriment of the ecosystem in order to meet the demands of people. Environmental
contaminants most prominently occur in terms of the type of liquids, solids, and
gases, which exceed the agreed limits. There are six types of pollution as shown in
Fig. 8.1. Water pollution is the second most pollutant after the air. Water is the
substance necessary for every living organism to survive on the planet and to
perform a normal routine function. Similarly, unpolluted fresh drinking water
plays a censorious role in a healthy life.
However, water contamination is a big concern due to overpopulation and
industrialization. The textile industry is one of those that commonly uses different
coloring agents to display more appealing clothing. These industries use many types
of coloring with complex aromatic structures that impart color to the fabrics and
have different characteristics, such as solubility, speed, color, and content. In the
dyeing process, it is necessary to have chromophore and auxochrome chemical
groups.
8.2.1
Chromophore
It is an active atom possessing the capability to absorb light in the visible region
(400–800 nm) which is responsible for giving color to the particular dye. There are
different types of chromophores such as azo (–N¼N–), carbon-nitrogen (>C¼NH
or –CH¼N–), sulfur (>C¼S), carbon (¼C¼C¼), nitro (¼NO–OH or –NO2),
Fig. 8.1 Different types of environmental pollutions
172
G. Vyavahare et al.

nitroso (N–OH or –NO), and carbonyl (¼C¼O), respectively, referred to as a
chromogen.
8.2.2
Auxochrome
Auxochrome is a group of atoms attached to a chromophore; eventually it changes
the wavelength and absorption intensity of chromophores. The dye binding to the
fabric should have a stable bond which is accomplished by the auxochromic groups;
either it might be acidic (–OH, –S–OH, and –COOH) or basic (NH–R, NH, and N–
R) in nature correspondingly. Dyes take the leading role in the global textile market
until purple dye which was chemically synthesized by William Perkin, and thereafter
in the twentieth century, synthetic dyes became dominant over natural dyes.
8.3
Classification of Dyes
Different types of dyes have unique properties like structure and bonding ability
toward the speciﬁc ﬁber. Some of the dyes are ﬁrmly bound to the fabrics by
chemical bonding, while others are bonded by van der Waal forces. Dyes are majorly
classiﬁed concurring to their origin such as natural and synthetic dyes.
8.3.1
Natural Dye
Natural dyes are acquired from natural plant, animal, and mineral sources.
According to its biochemical composition, natural dyes are classiﬁed as indigoid
dyes obtained from a bush pea family, i.e., Indigofera tinctoria. Flavone dyes are
isoﬂavones, and ﬂavone derivatives, i.e., hydroxy- and methoxy-substituted groups,
reveal yellow color possessing light fastness properties. Usually, anthraquinone-
based dyes exhibit red color isolated from the plants and insects. Alpha-hydroxy-
naphthoquinones are extracted from the Lawsonia inermis cultivated in Egypt and
India and give an orange color shade. Carajurin and direct orange dye is a natural
member of anthocyanidins isolated from the Bignonia chica leaves. Dihydropyran is
closely related to the ﬂavones and provides dark shade. Carotenoids have conjugated
double bonds that are responsible for providing color including saffron and annatto.
8.3.2
Synthetic Dyes
Synthetic dyes are made from organic or inorganic sources. Depending on their
chemical structure and dyeing process, different types of synthetic dyes include the
following: Basic dyes possess positively charged chromophore, which are more
attracted toward the oppositely charged substrate via electrostatic interaction. Acidic
have one or more acidic groups liable for getting the negative charge on dye and
8

include food colors. Direct dyes are water-soluble aromatic compounds also known
as substantive dye and revealed bright shades on fabrics. Azoic dyes are made up of
aromatic amines mostly naphthol or phenol or aniline and created with the aid of two
chemical compounds reacted with each other which were diazo base or diazo salt or
diazo compound and naphthol as a coupling compound. Dispersive dyes are water-
insoluble, pursuing ﬁne particle size possessing larger surface areas which are
assisted to absorb by the substrates. Reactive dyes have chromophore groups
possessing the ability to bind the ﬁber covalently. Vat dyes are produced from
carbazole, anthraquinone, and indigo. It is an insoluble complex of polycyclic
compound readily soluble in sodium hydrosulﬁde (Na-S-H) solution at 50 C
temperature with color fastness property. Mordant dyes are an organic or inorganic
molecule which is required for the coloring agent to act as a dye. Solvent dyes are
water-insoluble while soluble in an organic solvent such as alcohols. In sulfur dyes
chromophore of these dyes contains sulfur as an integral part and sodium sulﬁde is
used in dyeing process. Pigment dyes are azoic compounds with metal content and
maintain the crystalline structure throughout the coloring process. Ingrain dyes
(developed dyes) are directly synthesized on the fabrics. Commonly, phenol and
naphthol are used as coupling reagents during the dyeing process.
8.4
Hazardous Effect of Textile Dyes
Usage of dyestuff in the textile industry is up to 80% which is largest than the other
sectors. Approximately 30–50 L of water is needed to make 1 kg of fabric,
depending on the type of dye used in the dyeing application. According to the
World Bank, 17–20% of water pollution mainly arises from the textile dyeing
industries as a huge amount of synthetic dyes are released into a water stream.
Mainly in India, 55,000 million cubic meters of wastewater are discharged daily
from the textile ﬁeld, of which 68.5 million are wastewater directly mixed into the
river without any pretreatment (Government of India Ministry of Water Resources
Annual Report 1999–2000 New Delhi 2005) leading to immense toxicity (i.e.,
mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic) which is not only limited to mankind
but also the ﬂora, fauna, and livestock presented in the concerning environment.
Most of the azo dyes are harmful and have been reported to cause human cancer:
hepatocarcinomas, sarcomas, and also chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells
and ultimately owing to chromosomal breakage (Ratna and Padhi 2012). According
to Chen (2006), the carcinogenic amines are increased by azo and nitro compounds
eliminated in the sediments of marine animals. With this reactive dyes have also
shown symptoms such as respiratory sensitization, itching, watery eyes, sneezing,
coughing, and wheezing symptoms with carcinogenic properties (Rangabhashiyam
et al. 2013). Dispersive and vat dyes are also familiar with skin sensitivity. Toxicity
assessments of several types of dyes were tested on various model organisms for
proving the toxic nature of dyes.

8.5
Remedial Technologies for Textile Dyes
Now, different methods are implemented to remove and neutralize the hazardous
chemicals and colors from textile efﬂuent on the basis of its efﬁcacy which includes
chemical, biological, physical, and some other technologies as shown in Fig. 8.2.
8.5.1
Chemical Methods
Chemical methods involve strong oxidizing agents such as H2O2, ozone which is a
highly unstable gas, Fenton’s reagent (H2O2-fe), and sodium hypochloride (NaOCL)
to oxidize the organic-inorganic pollutants including the process of mineralization of
textile dyes. H2O2 is a potent oxidizing agent, harmless since each organism has the
ability to convert it to oxygen and water. However, this single compound is unable
and needs composite with ferrous salt for the efﬁcacious treatment of textile dyes.
For the remediation purpose, ozonization process has been adopted (Kurbus et al.
2003) mostly against the drinking water for generating a clean and clear solution by
generating a free radical which is extremely reactive against the substrate. But the
process has some drawbacks such as higher equipment cost and duration time, and
also it generates hazardous intermediate by-products. Among the advanced oxida-
tion processes, Fenton reagent (H2O2-fe) is one of the best oxidation processes for
the mineralization of numerous textile dyes and persistent organic pollutants
presented in the wastewater bodies. Using Fenton reagent, i.e., H2O2 with FeSO4,
higher dye concentration containing efﬂuent can be treated efﬁciently but requires
the highest energy. However, this method is restricted due to the production of
secondary pollutants, i.e., precipitate of Fe(OH)3 promoting water pollution

problem. Similarly, sodium hypochloride (NaOCL) is a chemical method where
efﬂuent decolorization rate is directly proportional to the intensity of chlorine
compound present in the reaction mixture. Commonly, those dyes comprising
naphthalene ring having amino group are greatly favored for the successful chlorine
decolorization process. In the electrochemical method, chloride of sodium, potas-
sium, magnesium, and calcium are mostly used as an electrolyte. In this process,
metal complexes are removed via the precipitation reaction with the electrode while
applying an electric charge on it.
TiO2 and UV radiation coupled photocatalysis has the ability to degrade toxic
organic substrates or dyes as well. It works actively at lower temperature and
pressure and doesn’t require costly oxidants. However, this process also produces
secondary by-products which might be extremely toxic than the maternal compound.
Thus, the above chemical methods are restricted to use in the treatment of textile
dyes because it possesses the following drawbacks such as chemical expensiveness
and also it arises secondary pollution problem and some of them also create a
disposal problem.
8.5.2
Biological Methods
A biological method is an eco-friendly approach extensively used for the treatment
of textile efﬂuent. Since 1970 efforts have been taken into consideration for the
isolation of bacterial cultures, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Aeromonas
hydrophila, for the degradation of azo dyes. Several researchers have reported that
the remediation of textile dyes is successfully achieved through microorganisms
including bacteria (Pearce et al. 2003) and fungi (i.e., Dichomitus squalens,
Daedalea ﬂavida, Irpex ﬂavus, P. chrysosporium BKM-F-1767, and Polyporus
sanguineus) (Chander and Arora 2007).
The fungal system releases numerous enzymes like manganese-dependent
peroxidases, lignin peroxidase, glucose-1-oxidase, phenol oxidase, and laccase
playing a key role in the degradation of efﬂuent containing azo dyes. At the present
moment, bacterial-assisted color removal system has been extensively applied for
the management of textile dyes. Some algae like Chlorella and Oscillatoria belong-
ing to aquatic organism secrete azo reductase enzyme liable to interrupt the azo bond
that existed in dye structure (Aksu 2005). Many plant systems include Aster amellus
and Zinnia angustifolia, and some aquatic plants such as Elodea canadensis, Elodea
nuttallii, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Hydrilla verticillata have been found to
degrade the textile dyes (Khandare and Govindwar 2015). Plants secreted
oxidoreductive class of enzymes like laccase, veratryl alcohol oxidase, azo reduc-
tase,
riboﬂavin
reductase,
tyrosinase,
lignin
peroxidase,
and
dichlorophenolindophenol reductase which have ability to convert the complex
structure of dyes into a simpler form. Common advantages and disadvantages of
all these strategies are demonstrated in Table 8.1.
176
G. Vyavahare et al.

8.5.3
Physical Methods
The physical methods include sedimentation, ﬂotation, radiation, membrane ﬁltra-
tion, and adsorption. In sedimentation, the suspended particles present in the aque-
ous solution are determined by the gravitational process. Consequently, reducing the
consumption of chemicals is required in the process of coagulation.
Flotation is a simple process given an alternative to sedimentation to remove the
total ﬂocs. This process is basically applied to the mineral called froth ﬂotation. Even
various bubble generation methods have also been extensively used for the removal
of the contaminants including dispersed air and dissolved air ﬂotation (Kitchener and
Gochin 1981). Different types of ﬂotation processes are available on the basis of size
and its mechanism, i.e., foam fractionation, foam ﬂotation, ion ﬂotation, and micro-
and ultra-ﬂotation used in industrial applications. Even several textile dyes were
efﬁciently removed by the dispersed-air ﬂotation process. However, these methods
also come up with some drawbacks such as greater requirement of collector reagent,
nonbiodegradable compound, and toxicological effects of generated by-products on
the environment.
Radiation is a technique that originally comes from chemistry and showed
promising results in wastewater treatment (organic pollutants). This process
generates high energy ﬂux signiﬁcantly responsible for the radiolysis of water
eventually forming highly reactive species to decompose the hazardous organic
pollutants from the environment (Liau and Chiang 2007). A different type of
radiation includes gamma-ray, X-rays, and electron beams which have been widely
used for the management of wastewater pollutants. However, this technique also has
a disadvantage; it is unable to treat a larger volume of efﬂuent.

Membrane ﬁltration is the method to evacuate dye particles from the water.
Membrane pore size is a crucial parameter inﬂuence on the membrane. Membrane
ﬁltration includes reverse osmosis (<0.002 μm), ultraﬁltration (0.2–0.02 μm), and
nano-ﬁltrations (<0.002 μm) which are commonly used in the industrial process for
reﬁning or purifying the ﬁnal products. However, this method has major
disadvantages like limited membrane life and expensive periodic replacement.
Owing to the above disadvantages in the abovementioned methods, adsorption is
one of the viable methods for extracting dissolved contaminants from aqueous
solution or efﬂuent. Different adsorbents like ion exchangers, activated carbon,
and inorganic materials with higher surfaces are used in adsorption applications.
Among these, activated carbons and biochar are effective adsorbents demonstrating
microporous properties and superior sorption ability. However, biochar is an excel-
lent alternative adsorbent for the elimination of diverse organic-inorganic
contaminants. Exploring diverse agro-industrial waste biomasses into the biochar
is a cost-effective ﬂourishing treatment for remediation of fabric dyes and efﬂuent
also. For the biochar preparation, various types of agro-industrial waste biomasses
have been utilized which include plant waste biomass, animal manure, industrial
waste and sewage sludge (sugar factory, paper mill, food processing waste, etc.), and
forest biomasses as demonstrated in Fig. 8.3 (Ahmad et al. 2014; Vyavahare et al.
2021). The sorption capacity is totally dependent on the pyrolysis temperature and
physiochemical properties of biochar. Thus, biochar has been recognized as an
effective adsorbent signiﬁcantly applied in the management of environmental
pollutants (Ahmad et al. 2014). Currently, most biochar-assisted color removals
practices have been done successfully which are demonstrated in Table 8.2. As

shown in Table 8.2, several laboratories and ﬁeld studies have been performed to
explore the biochar absorbency with different contaminants which involve organic
pesticides, heavy metals, antibiotics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
textile dyes, and wastewater.
8.6
Biochar Preparation
The different thermal processes include slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and ﬂash
pyrolysis which are mainly adopted for the preparation of biochar which depends on
our interest in end products. Major differences in the above processes include
heating rate, operating temperature, and residence time in which it was produced.
8.6.1
Slow Pyrolysis
Different feedstocks that have been adopted in the preparation of biochar for the
remediations of various contaminants are shown in Table 8.2. The slow pyrolyzed
process has a higher residence time (minutes to hours) with a heating rate <10 C/
min and temperature ranging from 350 to 800 C favorable for greater yield
(15–89%) of biochar (Ahmad et al. 2012). The thermal decomposition of biomass
acquired from plant compounds is gradually increased with increases in pyrolytic
temperature. Stages found in pyrolysis are dehydration, depolymerization, and
decomposition of feedstock. At the initial stage, biomass dehydration is carried
out, and some of the compounds get volatilized and subsequently decompose the
hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin at 300, 500, and >700 C temperature, respec-
tively. The biochar yield obtained from the slow pyrolysis is higher than the fast and
ﬂash pyrolysis process.
8.6.2
Fast Pyrolysis
Usually, bio-oil production is accomplished in a fast pyrolysis process. Bio-oil arises
from cellulose-, hemicellulose-, and lignin-containing biomass consisting of several
compounds. Residence time for fast pyrolysis process is very short (<2 s) and has a
higher heating rate (1000 C/s) with 400–1000 C temperature which ultimately
reduces the yield of biochar (Shah et al. 2012). Higher heating rate of fast pyrolysis
simulates a key part in rapid dehydration and volatilization of biomass by removing
vapors, and thus condensation yields higher bio-oil as a main product.
8.6.3
Flash Pyrolysis
In the ﬂash pyrolysis process, biomass is converted into a gaseous product at
elevated pressure (1–12 MPa). Pyrolysis conditions for ﬂash pyrolysis are <0.5 s
8

181

residence time pyrolyzed at 800–1000 C temperature. This pyrolysis process is
mainly used to convert the biomass containing a long chain of carbon, oxygen, and
hydrogen into the gaseous and oil as an end product. The process that occurred
during ﬂash pyrolysis is rapid devolatilization in the inert atmosphere by applying a
high heating rate and temperature (500–1000 C) and forming gas.
8.7
Properties of Biochar
Biochar is a carbon-rich solid material with an aromatic surface resulting after
burning or pyrolyzing of biomass and waste material in a zero or low oxygenated
environment. Every biomass has speciﬁc chemical functional groups in its structure
indicating their desired properties depending on biomass type and process of its
preparation conditions. Thus, below mentioned are the common physicochemical
properties of biochar.
8.7.1
Physical Properties of Biochar
Biochar prepared under lower heating rates exhibited similar-sized particles com-
pared to the feedstock. Grinding of feedstock prior to pyrolysis increases the heat
transfer rate that inclines to be very ﬁne particles (1–100 μm) of biochar, thus making
it more porous (Brewer 2012).
According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC),
pores are divided into three types on the basis of their size: micropores (internal
diameter less than 2 nm), mesopores (internal diameter less than 2–50 nm), and
macropores (internal diameter greater than 50 nm) correspondingly. Thus, larger-
pore materials are responsible for increasing the water-holding ability of the soil.
Biochar surface area is an important property that has a crucial role in the interaction
of pollutants and their surfaces; higher surface area means the participation of
biochar is higher in a chemical reaction per gram of biochar. If biochar has a higher
surface area, it would possess better adsorption capacity (Chen et al. 2008). The
biomass pyrolyzed at higher temperature along with long residence heating times
encourages the formation of micropores structure in the material. Thus, it indicates
that pyrolyzing temperature signiﬁcantly affects the biochar surface area and its
porosity.
8.7.2
Chemical Properties of Biochar
Mostly, the chemical properties of biochar are related to aromaticity and its surface
functionality. Rise in pyrolysis temperature, hydrogen, oxygen, and some volatile
compounds get extracted and form a new aromatic structure of biochar by carbon-
carbon bonding that is gradually limited to oxidative breakdown.
182
G. Vyavahare et al.

Surface active groups of feedstock are generally carboxylic acids (–COOH),
hydroxyls (–OH), and alkaline chains like methyl groups (–CH3) that varied
according to the type of raw material (Brewer 2012). After pyrolysis of feedstock,
prepared biochar has different surface chemistry groups that highly contributed to
increasing the cation exchange capacity of the biochar. Biochar pH is another
important chemical property that signiﬁcantly impacts the sorption mechanism.
Generally, most of the biochar surface has a negative charge and alkaline pH; this
negativity and alkalinity are increased with an increasing pyrolytic temperature
(Ahmad et al. 2013). These negatively charged active groups can effectively attract
positively charged environmental pollutants through cation exchange capacity.
8.8
Mechanism of Sorption
The sorption interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent basically depends on
the structural and chemical properties of adsorbate and adsorbent as well, and it will
be varied with its type. Protonation and deprotonation of surface functional groups
can facilitate a net charge of the biochar resulting in the formation of double-layer
surfaces that signiﬁcantly interacts with organic pollutants via coulombic attraction.
Interaction or sorption mechanism between the biochar and pollutants is classiﬁed
as covalent bonding, electrostatic attraction, surface adsorption, hydrogen bonding,
coulombic interaction, π-interaction, pore ﬁlling, ion exchange, precipitation, hydro-
phobic interaction, and other dipole interaction (Vithanage et al. 2016).
8.8.1
Covalent Bonding
In covalent bonding, electron pairs are shared and form an irreversible chemisorption
reaction which is stronger than any other non-covalent interaction. However,
non-covalent interaction is generally found in the physical sorption process
(physisorption) of the adsorbent.
8.8.2
Electrostatic Interaction
This interaction mainly occurs among the cationic charged pollutants and negatively
charged attributed biochar surfaces (Vyavahare et al. 2018). Generally, the surface
of biochar has a negative charge, and it can be controlled using pH, i.e., when the pH
of the solution below its isoelectric point attributes positively charged surface of
biochar, whereas solution pH higher than the isoelectric point will occupy net
negative charge.
Ionic strength and pH of solution also affect the sorption reaction; it can affect
positively or negatively depending on the isoelectric point of biochar.
8
Application of Biochar for the Treatment of Textile Dyes and Wastewater
183

8.8.3
Hydrogen Bonding
This reaction is carried out where the hydrogen donor, acceptor pairs are present.
Usually, hydrogen donors are bonded to acceptor atoms which include nitrogen (N),
ﬂuorine (F), and oxygen (O) in the form of –NH2, –COOH, and –OH functional
groups (Yang and Xing 2010; Kah et al. 2017). These donor-acceptor groups might
have existed on the pollutants or biochar surfaces that facilitate hydrogen bond
formation. According to Gilli et al. (2009), the charge-facilitated H-bonding has
three classes: positive charge-assisted (+), negative charge-assisted (), and double
charge-assisted () H-bonding. The small change of pka values between pollutants
and biochar surfaces encourages H-bond formation by sharing proton. Negative
charge-assisted H-bonding has strong bonding capacity among proton donor and
acceptor pairs in that base and acid were acted as a proton donor and acceptor,
respectively (Gilli et al. 2009). Compared to π- or hydrophobic interaction, charge-
assisted H-bonding plays a signiﬁcant role in sorption of weak organic pollutants on
oxygen possessing biochar surfaces.
8.8.4
Coulombic Interaction
Two charged moieties are involved in coulombic interaction; if adsorbate and
adsorbent have opposite charges, eventually they will interact with each other via
inducing the coulombic force.
8.8.5
p-Interaction
This interaction is weaker than hydrogen bonding. In this system, aromatic rings or
C¼C double bond could interact with polar molecules. This sorption system also
includes π-π interaction where the intermolecular attractions between the π systems
occurred. Oppositely polarized quadrapoles of the system also participate in the π-π
interaction.
8.8.6
Pore Filling
Biochar surfaces have micropores and mesopores structures which reveal their
applicability in pollutant sorption through the pore-ﬁlling mechanism (Hao et al.
2013). Pyrolysis temperature highly inﬂuenced the contaminant sorption properties
of biochar. This indicates that higher heating rates increase the overall surface area
and porosity of the biochar because of rapid depolymerization reaction and hence
the sorption process. The sorption process of biochar is inﬂuenced by biochar
porosity; if the biochar has higher pore volumes, it will sorb a greater amount of
pollutants via the internal diffusion mechanism, whereas low pore volumes of
biochar have fewer pollutant sorption efﬁciency. Polar, nonpolar contaminants can
184
G. Vyavahare et al.

be sorbed via pore-ﬁlling mechanisms of the biochar, depending on its type and
nature of biochar.
8.8.7
Ion Exchange
Ion exchange is another sorption mechanism where cation exchange capacity is
considered as one of the essential parameters for measuring the ion exchange
capacity of the adsorbent. Cation exchange capacity will vary with biochar type.
This process comprises ionizable cations and protons of the biochar which are
exchanged through the ion exchange mechanism. However, this process depends
heavily on the scale of the pollutant and the functional groups of biochar surfaces.
Biochar containing minerals control its cation exchange capacity. Higher pollutant
sorption on the biochar via ion exchange mechanism speciﬁes that this biochar has
greater cation exchange capacity.
8.8.8
Surface Precipitation
This process has two main aspects: One is increased pH of solution from the biochar
leads to reduce the mobility of pollutants and forms precipitate with hydroxide. The
second aspect of precipitation is releasing of some soluble chemicals like carbonate
and phosphate from the biochar prepared at a lower pyrolytic temperature which
enables the formation of surface precipitation reaction with pollutants (Cao and
Harris 2010). Precipitation of contaminants has certainly occurred with alkaline
biochar after thermal degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses at moderate
pyrolytic temperature (>300 C) (Cao and Harris 2010). Mostly, biochars made
up of plant biomasses are executed in the surface precipitation reaction.
8.8.9
Hydrophobic Interaction
Hydrophobic interaction is a nonspeciﬁc interaction implying the aggregation of
nonpolar groups which ultimately reduces the water molecules contact. For the
hydrophobic interaction, term bond is irrelevant because unspeciﬁc interactions are
not triggered by intermolecular forces with adsorbents (Meyer et al. 2006). Octanol-
water distribution coefﬁcient (Kow) is a chromatographic method mainly adopted for
the determination of hydrophobicity of the organic chemicals.
8.8.10 Other Dipole Interaction
Dipole-induced
dipole
interaction
(Debye
interactions),
permanent
dipole
interactions (Keesom interactions), and ﬂuctuating dipoles (dispersive forces or
London forces) are included in the other dipole interaction. These forces might be

185

useful for the polar functional groups (ether, nitrile and alkyl halide, etc.) of the
adsorbate (Yang and Xing 2010; Kah et al. 2017).
8.9
Application of Biochar
Biochar has a wide range of applications such as animal farming, building sectors,
food industries, and soil and water remediation due to its unique characteristics like
high sorption capacity, surface area, microporosity, and ion exchange capacity
(Ahmad et al. 2014; Schmidt and Wilson 2014). In animal farming, it is used as a
silage agent and feed additive which increases the antibody level. Biochar added into
the soil along with molasses, ash, or slurry can act as a soil conditioner and fertilizers
(Schmidt and Wilson 2014). A small bowl of biochar stored in the refrigerator
absorbs bad odors and prevents the post-maturation of fruits and vegetables from
increasing the storage time (Schmidt and Wilson 2014). Biochar has the ability to
perform effectively a decontaminator role in soil remediation after being added into
the soil. It is widely used in the treatment of sewage plants to sorb broad varieties of
organic and inorganic contaminants by acting as an adsorbent and reduces the
malicious odor and color of aqueous solution (Ahmad et al. 2014; Amin et al.
2016). Continuing with abovementioned applications, biochar has also been
reported for the treatment of lakes and ponds water by sorbing pesticides, fertilizers,
and textile dyes and promotes the aeration of water. Thus, biochar worked as an
active carbon ﬁlter and microﬁlters for the treatment of wastewater and drinking
water correspondingly (Schmidt and Wilson 2014). Prevailingly, biochar is used in
textile industries for the expulsion of noxious dyes, heavy metals, and recalcitrant
chemicals certainly used in the dyeing method of cloths (Vyavahare et al. 2018).
8.10
Biochar-Assisted Textile Dye Removal
Several dyes are used in the textile industry for dyeing process and are destructive for
the ecosystem and thus need to be removed from the industrial efﬂuent prior to
release into the common environment. Thus, different biochars derived from agro-
industrial waste, kitchen waste, microalgae, and seaweeds have been reported to
remove a variety of fabric dyes through the various sorption mechanisms (Sun et al.
2013; Sewu et al. 2017; Vyavahare et al. 2018, 2019, 2021).
Despite this, pigments-extracted macroalgae, bamboo shoot shells, cassava slag,
and straw-based biochar have been reported for the maximum sorption of textile
dyes (Chen et al. 2018; Hou et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2020). The N-doped microporous
biochar synthesized from crop straws performs orange acid 7 dye sorption in
presence of ammonia (Lian et al. 2016). In addition, Zhu et al. (2019) researched
the rapid removal of acid orange 7 dye by wood-based biochar due to the porous
nature of biochar. Several Remazol dyes were removed by algae-derived biochar
(Gokulan et al. 2019). Pig manure biochar prepared at 800 C showed efﬁcacious
removal of direct 23 dye (Liu et al. 2016) indicating weak electrostatic force present
186
G. Vyavahare et al.

in between dye and active sites of the biochar (Fan et al. 2017). Further, Kelm et al.
(2019) demonstrated the successful sorption of azo dye “Indosol Black NF1200”
onto wood waste biochar via external mass transfer and electrostatic interactions.
Thus, it indicates that several organic materials pyrolyzed at higher temperatures
were effective in the removal of textile dyes. Recently, modiﬁed biochars attempts
have been made for the sorption of higher concentrations of dyes. Sugarcane bagasse
biochar composite with calcium alginate, magnetized nanocomposite biochar made
up of seaweed, and banana peel biochar composite with iron sulfate were used in the
exclusion of methylene blue dye (Zhang et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020) with superior
sorption capacity for ﬁve repetitive cycles. This shows that the chemicals used in
modiﬁcation are primarily attributed to the formation of pores (mesoporous and
macroporous) and additional new functional groups on their surface that acts an
important role in dye sorption (Islam et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2017). Sorptions of wide
varieties of pollutants onto different biochars are demonstrated in Fig. 8.4. Thus,
biochar-assisted environmental pollutants removal can be considered as a sustain-
able cost-effective remedial strategy.

Conclusion with Future Prospective
Most of the scientiﬁc works have offered better intuition, particularly on the envi-
ronmental risk assessment for the management of toxicants especially emphasis on
textile dyes. In this chapter, we have detailed the usage of different types of dyes and
their hazardous impacts on environmental organisms. Usage of dyes is not only
limited to the textile industry but also in the microbiological and medicinal ﬁeld as a
pH indicator and stain. However, most of these dyes are deadly poisonous to
environmental organisms. Widely, these dyes are being enormously used in the
world. Therefore, the removal of dyes from efﬂuent is an imperative need. Sorption
is an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable strategy for the removal of
contaminants. We have taken efforts in order to review articles for the expulsion
of textile dyes with the help of various biological, chemical, and physical methods.
Expulsion of different organic and inorganic pollutants from the environment is
remarkably perceived by using biochar as an adsorbent. Nevertheless, disposal of
pollutants sorbed biochar is a major concern. Hence, future attention needs to be
given to solve the disposal problem of biochar-sorbed noxious contaminants.

Abstract
Biomass, after thermal decomposition without the presence of O2, is turned into
biochar; hence, it is resulted from the thermochemical conversion of biomass. The
quality and yield of biochar are dependent on the process parameters and the
technology that is used for its production. Ever-increasing anthropogenic
activities have resulted in continuous release of various types of wastes out of
which on-farm crop residues and household peels of vegetables and fruits have
resulted in serious environmental issues posing threats to human life. Biodegrad-
able residues are considered to be important source for substantial production of
energy. Various biodegradable substances like agricultural residues can be easily
converted to biochar via various thermochemical routes that help in the sustain-
able management of biodegradable wastes. The production of biochar involves
various processes that include gasiﬁcation, pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis and
torrefaction. The yield of biochar is signiﬁcantly reduced with the increase in
oxygen availability. It plays a signiﬁcant role in the enhancement of soil quality
by improving the physicochemical parameters of the soil. This chapter
emphasizes on the mechanisms of conversion of various agro-wastes to biochar

Introduction
Biochar is produced through the process of pyrolysis of different types of
organic compounds. Here, the biomass is supplied with continuous heat in the
presence of minimum amount of oxygen. The various contaminating compounds
are reduced to intermediate products, which are a simpler than their original
forms. These conversions produce gaseous products like carbon dioxide (CO2),
carbon monoxide (CO), water vapour, hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4) and ethane
(C2H6). This leads to the development of solid carbon residues that are also
known as “char”. The term “biochar” denotes that the components are produced
from biomass, like hay, rice hulls, woodchips, animal manure, sewage sludge,
corn stover, bagasse, switchgrass, etc. The main reason for the production is
using them as a rich source of energy. A lot of these components are the
byproducts of agricultural materials or components of the municipal waste
management. These products are usually classiﬁed or treated as the waste
materials those are required to be disposed. The reusage of the waste materials
for the production of biochar is advantageous as they may often be used in the
process of formation of agricultural crops and also used in animal farming. The
utilization of biochar is a way of environmental protection through which carbon
and energy may be recovered. The different characteristics of biochar rely on the
type of the feedstock materials that further determines the parameters, such as the
process of pyrolysis and heating. The parameters like temperature and duration
of pyrolysis are specially considered in this case. The various kinds of biomass
yield of biochar have different types of properties. However, for almost every
type of feedstock component, a rule is in its application. This rule states that,
with increase in the temperature of pyrolysis, the formed biochar is accounted to
have a high level of carbon content, bulk density, energy content, porosity and
surface area with low levels of oxygen and hydrogen content. Increase in the
process of pyrolysis time also increases the biochar surface area and the amount
of carbon level. The usage of biochar in the process of farming and agriculture is
a topic which is thoroughly administered through many research works through-
out the last few decades. Many of these research works aim to use biochar for
soil amendment. The different factors which are dependent on each other like the
194
D. Lahiri et al.

increased quality of the soil and different bacterial activities, the increase in crop
yields and the decrease in the emissions of greenhouse gases, which is associated
with the increased use of fertilizers, are considered as focal point of research.
Biochar is rich in carbon and are comprised of products those are organic and
undergoes some speciﬁc thermal combustion processes in the presence of mini-
mum amount of oxygen. Different organic waste materials which may be
considered as feedstock materials for the production of biochar, like the
cultivational wastes and kitchen solid wastes, are extensively studied (Glaser
et al. 2002).
9.2
Biochar Properties
The different characterizations of biochar are extensively discussed by research
journals and review papers in the course of time. One of the main characteristics
of biochar from the point of cultivation and production of livestock is studied the
most and is the main topic of research. Biochar properties are dependent on its
composition. Usually, it is dependent on the feedstock components which are
necessary for the process of pyrolysis and the parameters used in the process. In
the process of biochar formation, the most important factor is to get the maxi-
mum of the carbonaceous product which is in the solid state. The ideal time of
pyrolysis and temperature required for the production of biochar usually varies
between 1 and 4 h and from 300 to 700 C, respectively. Torrefaction is said to
be a certain temperature in the process of pyrolysis which is low and lies between
200 and 300 C and is also referred to as “high-temperature drying” or “mild
pyrolysis”. The ever-increasing demand in the process of formation of biochar
has effects in high levels of product development with regulatory effect. The
European Biochar Foundation, which is a non-proﬁt organization, gives us some
general instructions to ensure that the formation or production of biochar also
gives a component which has well and good characteristics and a nicer environ-
mental effect. The International Biochar Initiative (IBI) is the type of institute that

practices,
inﬂuencing
the
collaboration
with
stakeholders, other industrial processes, along with some ethical or environmental
standards for supporting the process of biochar which is regarded as commer-
cially viable and safe. The standards of biochar of the IBI give us some speciﬁc
tools for maintenance of quality standards to ensure safer use. It also helps to
maintain the required characteristics and several process parameters of biochar. It
is an essential factor for the cultivational functions of biochar which may have
been suffered from contamination with dioxins, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, semi-volatile and volatile organic compounds like toxins. The
biochar which suffers from their unknown origin, which is formed from waste
components having contaminations, should be studied much, rather than the other
types, which are the type of biochar whose substrates or origins are known.
These types include the agricultural types like the biochar originating from the
pruning residues, poultry litter and corn stover. Some studies convey that the

ﬁndings in the effect of different pyrolysis conditions also affect the rate of
biochar production. The rise in the level of temperature of pyrolysis and the
time of heating of pyrolysis of the feedstock substances from approximately
350 to 550 C and from 1 to 3 h show the results in the biochar, which have
characterizations such as increase from 64.4 to 82.2% of carbon content, decrease
from 6.67 to 12.62% of ash content and increase from 6.95 to 8.58 in the pH
conditions. But between all these things, the yield of the biochar suffers a
reduction from 45.18 to 20.94%. Some research studies also utilized pitch pine
woodchips in a fast pyrolysis process, which takes approximately 2 min in
various temperatures like 300, 400 and 500
C as well as the elevated
temperatures which will eventually form into a biochar with high carbon content
which are about 63.9%, 70.7% and 90.5%, respectively. However, the reduced
hydrogen margin remains 5.4%, 3.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The reduced
oxygen margin remains 30.13, 25.625, and 7.78% of the total content. The
various production rates of biochar which are also reduced with the increase in
the process of pyrolysis temperatures, which ranges from 60.7% at 300
C,
33.5% at 400 C to 14.4% at 500 C. Some speciﬁc studies however showed a
comparison with the results of slow heating rate, ranging from 50 C/min, when
the total process accounts for 60 min. They also showed the results of the fast
heating rate of 120 C/min where the total process accounts for 20 min. The
process of pyrolysis of sugarcane results in the slow pyrolysis and gives rise to
fuel in a greater biochar percentage of production from the fuel which is received
by similar components in the fast pyrolysis process. The fuel which is received
from fast pyrolysis process is said to possess a larger fraction of the total amount
of ﬂuid which ranges from about 50.89% at 480 C to 38.11% at 780 C in
comparison to the process of slow pyrolysis. In the slow pyrolysis process, the
content of tar usually ranges from 27.11% at 390 C to 19.20% at 980 C. The
amount of biochar is comparatively high through the process of slow pyrolysis
and low through the process of quicker pyrolysis; however, an indirect relation
exists among the amount of biochar, and the parameters like the temperature of
pyrolysis may be explained. The larger the amount of biochar is, the slower the
process is. This is actually likely towards the result of the secondary biochar
production, which takes place in the different procedures slowly. But normal
ways may be observed because, whatever the type of pyrolysis is, the rise in the
pyrolysis temperature gives rise to reduction in the content of biochar. This again
results in lowering in the yield of biochar. Some studies state that, when the
temperature of wastewater sludge pyrolysis increases, this effects in reduction of
the yields from 72.3% for pyrolysis at 300 C down to 52.4% at 700 C. But
with the increase in the temperature of pyrolysis, the reduction in the content of
carbon takes place from 25.6 to 20.2% between 300 and 400 C which then
remains stable. These changes in the content of carbon have an explanation
which can be explained by the large amount of carbon high having volatile
compounds in the components of feedstock, which was supplied with different
gases quite easily when the temperature level increased. Hydrogen, nitrogen and
196

oxygen levels reduced with the increased temperature ranging from 2.645% to
0.76%, 4.01% to 1.34% and 7.96% to ~0.001%, respectively.
9.3
Modification and Preparation of Biochar
9.3.1
Preparation of Biochar
The different processes for the formation of biochar, which are usually grouped into
carbonization and microwave carbonization, pyrolysis, HTC or hydrothermal, are
very common. The various ways of formation effect the different properties which
can be both chemical and physical characteristics present in biochar. These include
speciﬁc surface area, yield, ash, pore structure, type, functional groups and cation
exchange capacity. In comparison to the pyrolysis process, in hydrothermal carbon-
ization, drying is not required, and it possesses a larger yield of biochar. The
positive sides of microwave carbonization are no hysteresis, controllable process,
rapid convey of heat and efﬁciency of energy. But the biochar, which is formed
by hydrothermal carbonization and also by a microwave carrying higher
concentrations of organic compounds, is usually not required as a component of
soil remediation.
9.3.2
Pyrolysis
The process known as thermal decomposition or commonly known as pyrolysis is a
process which is operated in cases where oxygen is not required and which is an
easiest way for the preparation of the biochar. Usually, the process of pyrolysis
contains the heating of organic compounds to temperatures which are higher than
400 C in the different inert atmospheres, taking place by higher temperature
medium or electric heating. Some of the parameters effecting the physicochemical
characteristics of biochar include the raw materials, reaction conditions like heating
rate, residence time and reaction temperature.
9.3.3
Characteristics of Pyrolysis Process
Normal substrates requiring information of biochar are innumerable. Usually, the
use of various forms of organic compounds can undergo pyrolysis. Because of
the high biomass output of resources of solid wastes, the biomass acts as a
common raw component in biochar which is consisted of livestock and poultry
manure, kitchen waste, sludge, fruit skin, melon seed shell, peanut shell, rice
husk, wheat straw, corn straw, wood chips, etc. The produced biochar is usually
formed of various components which possess several ratios of cellulose, hemicel-
lulose and lignin. That’s why, the yield of the composition and the portion of ash
are different. Some studies have found out that the amount of ash in the straw
9

197

biochar is comparatively larger than that of the rest of the types of biochar,
especially those which are majorly resulting to large amount of Si in straw. The
comparison of the physicochemical characteristics of the produced biochar having
different feedstocks is done by many research articles. The feedstock materials
are the components of soybean, peanut, canola and corn. The amount of produced
ash in the biochar, produced from the straw and produced from the corn, is done
in a temperature of 700 C, and it gives the amount which is up to 73.30% in
comparison to the peanut straw, canola and soybean biochar having production
percentages of about 55%, 23.70% and 38.50%, respectively. The temperature of
reaction varies from higher hydrothermal synthesis, temperature anoxic and ﬂash
carbonization for preparing the BC which are 400 to 900 C to 180 to 250 C
and 300 to 600 C, respectively. Usually, when the temperature of pyrolysis
increases the biochar yield and the number of acidic side chains like the –OH
and –COOH are reduced ash content, pH and the alkaline functional groups are
all risen up. Additionally, results of the process of temperature of pyrolysis on
pore volume and the surface areas are very much important. Some of the studies
have showed that the total pore volume and speciﬁc surface area of sesame straw
BC rises from 44.7 to 276.2 m2g1 and 0.0654 to 0.1388 cm3g1 respectively,
when the temperature of pyrolysis rises up from 500 to 600 C. Based on the
various heating rates, pyrolysis can be parted into slow pyrolysis or SP and FP or
fast pyrolysis. Slow pyrolysis is shown by heating in a slow process which
depends on minutes to hours. The slow heating of pyrolysis is in the organic
components in the oxygen-less atmosphere and comparatively gas residence times
and long solids. In the time of the process of slow pyrolysis, the liquid and solid
components like the syngas, BC and bio-oil which are mainly H2, CO2 and CO
are formed. The fast pyrolysis process consists of a blow of small particles in the
different organic compounds in a thermal reactor and suffers an explanation
towards the process of heat transfer in milliseconds to seconds. The newest fast
pyrolysis normally occurs in some systems using ablative reactors, ﬂuidized bed
system and systems using polymerase chain reaction or which is otherwise
known as centrifuge reactors for pyrolysis. Slow and fast pyrolysis processes
give rise to biochar, having various physicochemical characteristics. This gives
various effects on the application of soil and its different properties. In compari-
son to the biochar undergoing fast pyrolysis, it contains unpyrolyzed fraction of
biomass. However, the biochar formed from slow pyrolysis can experience a
complete pyrolysis. Similarly, in the temperature of pyrolysis, the yield of biochar
suffers a reduction with the rise in the residence time. Some studies provide a
preparation from BC with orange peel with a temperature of pyrolysis for about
700 C, the time of residence of 7 h approximately, and the yield of biochar was
about 6.95%. The pores of BC and the speciﬁc surface area were with the
extending of the residence time.

9.3.4
Metal Impregnation
The term “metal impregnation” means the process of adsorption of a few
heteroatoms and ions of metals in the pores and surfaces of the BC. Again, there
are instances, where the surface area is risen up, and additionally the ions of the
metal are in a combination along with the adsorbent for the improvement of the
performance of adsorption. Some of the usual metal ions are Fe, Mg, Ag, Zn, etc.
From a few of the works, we come to know that there are certain advantages of the
chemical reagents for having a better adsorption performance. Preparation of a novel
biochar material is also done, which is the CMC–FeS biochar by the combination of
CMC or carboxymethyl cellulose and FeS or iron sulphide. This has undergone a
demonstration that the useful absorbent of CMC–FeS biochar has a composition for
removal chromium (VI).
9.3.5
Other Methods
Along with the above-mentioned ways of modifying the methods like the low
temperature plasma modiﬁcation methods, organic matter grafting and ozone oxida-
tion are very popular subjects of experimentation nowadays. The modiﬁcation of
temperature plasma which occurs on a very low temperature refers to the plasmas,
which occur through the generation by glow, microwave and corona. All of these are
collided with carbon-carbon bonds on the biochar surface and plasmas which have
been oxidized to the functional group containing oxygen, and it also increased the
polarity of biochar. But there are many ways which are not yet used on a large scale
or experimented for a long time because of the high cost of it and its complicated
operation.
9.4
Removal Mechanism of Major Pollutants by Biochar
There are different types of processes of remediation against soil pollution, which are
caused by biochar. Some of these are precipitation, electrostatic interaction, com-
plexation, ion exchange and physical adsorption (Table 9.1).
9.4.1
Ion Exchange
The term ion exchange conveys the process in which the acidic functional groups
that possess oxygen on the biochar surface like the hydroxyl groups, carbonyl
groups and carboxyl groups possess the ability of ionizing the proton or the base
ions on the surface like K+, Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+, etc., for the purpose of exchanging
against the ions of heavy metal or the organic pollutants that are cationic.
9

9.4.2
Physical Adsorption
The mechanism of physical adsorption says that the biochar undergoes full utiliza-
tion of its surface properties consisting of porousness and large speciﬁcity of the
surface area. These factors result in different pollutants like the heavy metals or the
organic substances which can undergo absorption over the biochar area or diffusion
into the micropores. The heavy metal ion radius is always shorter than the mean pore

radius of the biochar. Usually, the lesser the radius of the heavy metal more are the
number of pores present which undergo penetration inside the pores of the BC
thereby increasing in the adsorption capacity. Intensity in the physical adsorption
method is in close relation to the different characteristics and speciﬁc surface area of
biochar, the characteristics and various concentrations of the temperature and the
pollutants in which the procedure of adsorption is carried out. Again, the process of
physical adsorption kinetics is basically used through the pseudo ﬁrst-order and
pseudo second-order models of chemical kinetics. Physical adsorption may have
only one layer of adsorption or some multilayers of adsorption that is done by
Freundlich and Langmuir model.
9.4.3
Electrostatic Interaction
The process of electrostatic interaction means that the adsorption takes place
electrostatically between the heavy ions of metal and the area charge of
BC. While the value of pH in the solution is higher than that of point of charge of
BC or the pHpzc, the ve charge lying inside the biochar of the positive charge and
surface on the heavy metals results in the process of electrostatic adsorption. The
ions present in the heavy metals possess a positive charge on the biochar surface
along with the functional groups containing oxygen like carboxyl, carbonyl and
hydroxyl.
9.4.4
Precipitation
Various types of mineral compounds that are found within BC remain associated
with OH, Cl, SO4
2, SO3
2, CO3
2, PO4
3 and SiO3
4, when combined
together with heavy metal ions for the production of water insoluble components.
The different water insoluble components are metal carbonates, metal phosphates
and metal oxides, which carry the process of immobilization and adsorption of
heavy metals. Some studies have proved that the adsorption of copper, zinc,
cadmium, etc. by the biochar fertilizer is majorly done by the process of precipi-
tation of PO4
3 and CO3
2. During this process, the surface of electron complica-
tion by the functional side chains such as –OH groups or delocalized π is much
less.
9.4.5
Complexation
The term complexation explains the level of interaction between functional groups
possessing oxygen, which takes place in the surface of biochar and heavy metals for
the production of various complexes that can be repurposed. Many research works
9
Conversion of Agricultural Wastes into Biochar and Its Characteristics
201

have been conducted over the cow manure biochar, and its aluminum phytotoxicity
for production of wheat and a conclusion can be drawn that the process of
adsorption of Al by BC was because of the complication of carboxyl side chain
with [Al (OH)]2+ complex and the surface, which is a monomer compared to the
attraction of Al3+ electrostatically with negative charge is distinctively proven.
Some studies have also conveyed that the oxytetracycline adsorption of biochar is
majorly done through the formation of π and π bonds and bridge of metal along
with the surface complication, which is the major property and also cation
exchange, which may or may not exist. During this procedure of adsorption, there
is not a single pathway, but there exists a summation of combinations of various
processes of adsorption.
9.4.6
Biochar in the Sludge as well as Sludge Additive
It is of almost importance that the environment factors in the utilization of biochar
are the biochar as a manure and the use of biochar as any other kind of compostable
wastes or additive. The properties like high porosity and large surface area of
biochar are considered to be a very good adsorbent agent. This retains the precious
elements like nitrogen, carbon and sulphur which are typical and will not be found
in the environment as pollutants which are not required. High surface area creates
high aerated and spacious habitats for the different microbes which facilitates the
microbial activities with and highly stimulated conditions and with a little high level
of acidic and organic carbon content that is necessary for the microbes and which
has a very strong and very positive effect on the different composting processes.
Many research works conducted previously have a laboratory scale of experiment,
which are conducted for the investigation on the different effects of biochar
amendment for dairy cattle slurry for the necessity of preserving the slurry nutrients.
The biochar produced from wood shavings at ﬁrst underwent an addition with the
slurry with a dosage, which almost equals 3.89 m3 ha1 and resulting in 76% NH3,
64% N2O and 81% CO2 decrease of emissions. Other conducted research works
also result in the application of pinewood biochar, apparently ﬂoating inside the
surface of manure formed by swine by the treatment of gaseous emissions. Many
research works also showed a 13–23% decrease in the ammonia emission, which
takes place along with the largest experimented biochar application of dosage of
4.47 kgm2, a 14–32% decrease ammonium sulphate with a dosage of biochar of
2.28 kgm2 and up to a 26% reduction for indole, again along with the application
of biochar dose of 2.28 kgm2. But the different observations were mathematically
and statistically insigniﬁcant. It should also be mentioned here that an applied
dosage of 4.43 kgm2 is seen to have a very signiﬁcant increase in the methane
content, which is up to 24%. This may occur because of the extra availability and

content of carbon, along with the other nutrients for the high methanogen content in
the manure. Other research works also suggest that an extra 5–22% (w/w) of chips
of pine from biochar to poultry litter goes through the process of composting. The
process of biochar amendment fastens up the process of composting and the process
of reduced emissions of hydrogen sulphate and ammonia by 72% and 54%,
respectively. These were seen for the 22% biochar treatment, whether the 6%
biochar for treating decreased the hydrogen sulphate emission by 58%. Some of
the research works suggest that 6% production of biochar is produced by woody
components to sludge from sewage like that of the woodchips mixture which is
enriched with decomposition of organic matter and decreased ammonia emission by
almost half during the course of the primary week of production of compost as seen
in Table 9.2.

Biochar in the Additive of Feed
Application of biochar in additive for the feed and in the animals of farm is seen
since a long time. The results of these supplies in the various groups of animals are
commonly seen. The meaning of this application of biochar indicates towards better
digestion, feed, GHGs emission mitigation, conversion ratio, weight gain and used
also in medicating in response to bacteriological diseases, intoxication and viral
diseases. Also, various applications of biochar as a food option in the matter of
nutrition in animals can be an alternative method of solution and so a lot of research
is targeted in this area. Some of these research works are observed to give the
introduction which wood from oak in biochar inside laying hens’ and chicken
broilers’ diets may greatly affect the formation and the efﬁciency of the produced
biochar (Table 9.3).

Conclusions
In the recent times, the usage of biochar in cultivation is actually based among
the products based on biochar as an amendment of soil. But, here always lies
ample number of possibilities for the investigation through the other applicable
areas of biochar application. There are many strong relationships, which lie
between many factors like the feedstock components of biochar, biochar dose,
the different characteristics of biochar, the various types of soil, the various types
of species of plants, the targeted elements or the experimental compounds, etc.
The other factors of biochar development, which are exposed to experimentation
in the last few years, include the biochar-enhanced composting methods and
formation of the biochar by the process of pyrolysis of wastes produced out of
cultivation. But the usual and known characteristics of biochar with their cultiva-
tion potentials have been utilized in the rest of the areas like the odour, providing
nutrients to the animals, emitting the gases, the usage of biochar-containing
manures made from animals used usually due to different types of fertilizers,
etc. The process of composting the biochar contains an overall good result on the
process of composting. But the decrease of few gaseous emissions can take up
the other options. Using the biochar as an additive of animal feed also possesses
a good effect. Again, other studies also confront that the ﬁeld of biochar utiliza-
tion is a new one and needs to be experimented more, and also they are expected
to produce useful results. Again, some research works prove that as in this area,
the utilization of biochar can be low, but at the same time, it can also give useful
results. The various types of feedstock components have a contribution in the
various properties of the biochar, and the differences in the characteristics have
an increased amount of substance by the various parameters of pyrolysis, espe-
cially the parameters like temperature and time. An optimum dosage of biochar
should be studied when it is studied as an additive and when the inﬂuence and
different characteristics of biochar should be taken into account.

Abstract
Around 50 million people worldwide live with epilepsy, making it one of the
most common neurological diseases globally. Affecting people of all ages, this
chronic noncommunicable condition is mainly concentrated in low- and middle-
income countries, becoming a public health problem. Besides, people with
epilepsy suffer from stigma and discrimination, and this condition also requires
therapeutical treatment with antiepileptic drugs for many years or a lifetime. This
fact leads to the need for constant production and use of these pharmaceutical
compounds globally, placing them among the four classes highly found in water,
thus creating an environmental health problem. To ﬁll gaps in social and environ-
mental contexts, this chapter addresses understanding and perspectives on the
topics (1) public awareness of epilepsy and its effects in society; (2) antiepileptic
drugs occurrence and interaction with aquatic ecosystems; and (3) remediation
processes for anticonvulsants in wastewater.

Epilepsy Disease Effects in Society
Affecting approximately 50 million people globally of all ages, sexes, and races,
epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological severe diseases. People with
epilepsy (PWE) suffer from a brain disorder characterized by abnormal electrical
activity, causing seizures, unusual behavior, sensations, and, in some cases, loss of
awareness (WHO 2019). Despite it being the only severe and disabling chronic
neurological condition fully treatable with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in most cases,
PWE’s life is negatively impacted in essential areas, such as education, employment,
marriage, and social integration. This is due to stigma and discriminatory practices
that remain in society for centuries (Braga et al. 2020).
Besides the social impacts, epilepsy carries neurological, cognitive, and psycho-
logical consequences, leading to a high risk of disability, psychiatric comorbidity,
social isolation, and premature death. PWE has up to three times more chances to
have a premature death than the general population, and in low- and middle-income
countries, the risk of poor quality of life for people with this condition increases.
This is due to high treatment gaps, exceeding 75% in low-income countries (LIC)
and 50% in middle-income countries (MIC), despite the effectiveness and low cost
of AEDs available in the market. The epilepsy occurrence in these countries is higher
than in high-income countries (HIC), and the reason can be the lack of access to
basic health facilities to prevent the disease.
Although the cause of some epilepsy cases remains unknown, this neurological
condition can be attributed to genetic, metabolic, infectious, structural, and immune
causes. Also, lesions such as birth injury, head trauma, and stroke can lead to an
epilepsy case, justifying the predominance in children and people over 60 years old
(WHO 2019). Signiﬁcant progress has been made to improve epilepsy diagnosis and
therapeutic approaches. However, the burden of epilepsy is still positively associated
with social aspects, and it has severe implications in personal health and society
functioning, including economic development (Jennum et al. 2021). From the social
and treatment point of view, PWE’s life’s-related factors are highlighted in Fig. 10.1
and discussed in the sections below. It is important to emphasize that the treatment
quality is directly linked to the epilepsy social aspects. Access to reliable medicines
and control of the clinical condition will only be possible when epilepsy becomes
part of the public health agendas worldwide.

10.1.1 Public Awareness
Due to rising life expectancy and healthcare services, avoiding several epilepsy-
related deaths, the number of PWE is estimated to continuously increase worldwide,
with a rate of 5 million new cases per year. Because it is treatable, this neurological
condition can lead to a full and productive life. In 70% of the cases, the individual
can become seizure-free through an appropriate therapeutic approach. The integra-
tion of epilepsy into primary health care and the guarantee that PWE has access to
quality and affordable medical services has shown a promising way to achieve a
quality of life and reduce the burden of epilepsy (WHO 2019).
The treatment and social gaps remain enormous and lead to a human rights
violation scenario worldwide. The knowledge regarding epilepsy is still limited in
the general population, both in HIC and LIC, leading to myths and misconceptions
about this condition and an intrinsic undervaluation of PWE, both by the felt and
institutionalized stigma (WHO 2019; Braga et al. 2020). The WHO report (2019)
showed that only 20% of Latin America and the Caribbean countries has national
legislation related to epilepsy and emphasizes that physical and social health can be
improved with a multipronged strategy.
Almost 50% of adults with epilepsy have coexisting physical or psychiatric
conditions, with depression and anxiety being the most prevalent. In children,
epilepsy often coexists with intellectual disability, and the elderly with neurodegen-
erative diseases (WHO 2019). In a pandemic scenario, as in the SARS-CoV-
2 (COVID-19) started in the late 2019, the implementation of several degrees of
social distance and interventions can negatively impact the quality of life and
medical care of PWE. Subotic et al. (2020) highlighted that a pandemic situation
exacerbates negative feelings, such as social isolation, and brings more anxiety about
the future, both in social and treatment aspects.
The long-term consequences of epilepsy could be ameliorated through manage-
ment and research. However, the investments in epilepsy research remain insufﬁ-
cient, and even in HIC, only a small proportion of the efforts are directed to this
disease. In the United States, for example, 0.09% of the total National Institutes of
Health budget is dedicated to epilepsy, and it has stagnated over the last 3 years,
according to WHO (2019). The WHO report mentions the even worst situation of the
low- and middle-income countries, where research is majority ﬁnanced by domestic
organizations and is directed to other types of diseases.
To obtain a measure of epilepsy research in public awareness, we consulted the
Web of Science and Scopus databases and found the disparity in scientiﬁc produc-
tion worldwide. In both databases, the regions domaining publications on the subject
are the United States, the United Kingdom, and, surprisingly, India. The last one
goes against the expected comportment for two reasons: it is a LIC, and, according to
WHO (2019), in 2016, India devoted only 3.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) to
health care. On the other hand, the United States and the United Kingdom, both HIC,
devoted 17.1% and 9.8%, respectively. The establishment of regional research
priorities and agenda may be the case in India and is one of WHO suggestions
because it facilitates the defense of research funding in regions of high need.

N. Klanovicz et al.

Public knowledge and awareness about epilepsy play an essential role in disease
control because PWE requires therapeutic treatment with antiepileptic drugs for
many years or a lifetime. Although there are many compounds available in the
market to treat epilepsy, as shown in Fig. 10.1, and capable of reducing or
eliminating the seizures in 70% of the cases, the medication non-adherence can
reach up to 79% in some low- and middle-income countries, mainly due to a
diagnosis lack and poor access to medicines (WHO 2019; Braga et al. 2020).
Given the importance of antiseizure medicines in epilepsy treatment and control,
the next section of this chapter is addressed to introduce this group of drugs and
some therapeutic aspects of these compounds.
10.1.2 Antiepileptic Drugs
The pharmaceutical class known as antiepileptic, anticonvulsant, or antiseizure
drugs has been widely used to manage seizure frequency in PWE. As shown in
Fig. 10.1, there are many types of action mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to
AEDs which prevent the brain disorders that cause epilepsy, making them a group of
drugs structurally and pharmacologically diverse. The AEDs can be classiﬁed based
on when the compound was accepted and approved as a medicine to treat epilepsy
(McMillin and Krasowski 2016; Rani et al. 2016; Zabihollahpoor et al. 2020).
The AEDs known as older, ﬁrst-generation, or classical were introduced before
the 1990s and include the compounds carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin,
primidone, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, clonazepam, diaze-
pam, ethosuximide, and clobazam. They possess signiﬁcant pharmacokinetic
variability and high adverse effects and risk of toxicity (Brodie and Kwan 2012;
Pickrell et al. 2014; McMillin and Krasowski 2016; Zabihollahpoor et al. 2020; Fox
et al. 2020). Long-term use of these medicines may affect thyroid function and bone
metabolism, increase the risk of vascular-related pathologies, and impact the
patients’ reproductive health (Fox et al. 2020; Markoula et al. 2020; Shi et al.
2020). Despite the use of older EADs trends to diminish, their utilization remains
relatively common in PWE, mainly among elderly patients. This behavior is also
seen in countries with limited health resources, where the use of older EADs
represents a cost-effective strategy to guarantee access to treatment for the popula-
tion (WHO 2019; Fox et al. 2020).
Driven by the necessity to reduce side effects and drug-drug interactions and
cover drug-resistant epilepsy cases, affecting one-third of PWE (Brodie and Kwan
2012), the treatment with newer AEDs, also classiﬁed as the second and third
generation of anticonvulsants, has been approved since the late 2000s. The newer
compounds
comprise
levetiracetam,
oxcarbazepine,
lacosamide,
pregabalin,
ruﬁnamide,
zonisamide,
eslicarbazepine,
vigabatrin,
felbamate,
stiripentol,
tiagabine, retigabine, and perampanel. Several of them have shown efﬁcacy similar
to the older, lower risk of adverse effects, and increased chances for patients to
become seizure-free (Brodie and Kwan 2012; Pickrell et al. 2014; McMillin and
Krasowski 2016; Zabihollahpoor et al. 2020). Clinical experience is limited for some
10

213

of these compounds, and it is a concern among the medical community. Epilepsy
research can be a powerful tool for increasing conﬁdence in the newer AEDs and
reducing the impacts that epilepsy treatment can have on the PWE’s quality of life.
According to the WHO report (2019), besides the diverse availability of older and
newer EADs worldwide, the quality aspect should be considered. Data indicate that
over one out of ten medicines available in low- and middle-income countries are
substandard or falsiﬁed. The use of these medicines has severe consequences
because they may contain toxic compounds or impurities. In this sense, the
standardization of AEDs production is a public concern. It has to become closely
monitored to ensure security to patients and the environment since some drugs are
not fully metabolized. In fact, up to 50% of the administered dose can be excreted
unchanged (Habibi 2010).
10.2
Antiepileptic Drugs Interaction with Aquatic Ecosystems
The occurrence and detection of AEDs in environmental matrices, such as surface
water and wastewater, brought a new perspective of environmental quality due to
their
low
concentrations
and
hazardous
aspect.
The
primary
sources
of
pharmaceuticals such as AEDs in the environment are wastewater treatment plants
(WWTPs) (Naghdi et al. 2018) and hospital efﬂuents (Verlicchi et al. 2012). Global
consumption of AEDs leads to an increase of these compounds’ occurrence in water
matrices since the active principles are not completely metabolized in the human
body and, consequently, are excreted in metabolites form. For example, 25% of
carbamazepine (CBZ) is excreted in urine after liver metabolization, where the
primary metabolite is carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (Bertilsson and Tomson
1986), while 40–50% of primidone (PMD) is excreted unchanged by urine (Habibi
2010).
Jjemba (2008) highlights that pharmaceuticals’ half-life (t1/2) on environmental
matrices depends signiﬁcantly on the pharmaceutical compound itself and on the
medium, reaching up to 120 h. This parameter helps to estimate how long the
pollutant will be present in the environment. Solubility is also an important
physical-chemical property, indicating whether the contaminant has more afﬁnity
with water or with organic substrates. It is directly related to the distribution
coefﬁcient and the octanol-water partition coefﬁcient (log Kow). The pKa is also
relevant in environmental samples, which are usually acidiﬁed before the extractions
and analysis of pharmaceuticals. In fact, the extractability is reduced for compounds
exhibitig high pKa values. The aspects mentioned above illustrate if the contaminant
has more water or organic afﬁnity, deﬁnitely impacting the wastewater treatment
strategies.
Many studies have investigated these properties and the concentration of AEDs in
water bodies, as presented in detail in Table 10.1. In addition to the occurrence in
surface water and WWTPs, the AEDs have been found in other matrices either, as
reported by Rezka et al. (2015), pointing concentrations of 2–2325 ng L1 of CBZ in
groundwater and 12–25 ng L1 in drinking water. This compound is the most

studied and monitored in several countries, with a wide range of concentrations
found in surface water and in inﬂuent and efﬂuent streams of WWTPs.
The ﬁndings in studies of Table 10.1 indicate the failure in existing treatment
plants in AEDs removal, with higher concentrations of the compounds in efﬂuent
samples than in inﬂuent, in some cases. The high half-time of AEDs is also an
indication that these substances persist in water bodies if the appropriate removal
process is not applied. To date, the newer class of EADs is poorly monitored in the
environment, and the literature available so far has been monitoring only the
oxcarbazepine compound.
Pivetta et al. (2020) investigated psychotropic drugs in Brazilian surface water
and wastewater treatment plants in addition to assessing their environmental risks.
The presence of six of eight target compounds on wastewater samples supports the
inefﬁciency of conventional treatment processes applied to remove contaminants of
emerging concern. The risk assessment presented by the authors showed that the
AEDs’ detected concentrations pose no direct risk to the aquatic environment.
Despite this, psychoactive drugs have a lack of reliable ecotoxicological data,
highlighting the challenge of assessing the impact of these drugs.
The investigation of pharmaceuticals in environmental matrices faces a common
challenge, with regard to the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of compounds, due to
their low concentrations and the inherent complexity of water matrices. Monitoring
AEDs in the environment requires reﬁned analytical techniques and, in most cases,
pre-treatment procedures, such as liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction.
The determination of several compounds in the same sample is also a challenge that
has been explored, aiming at achieving sensitivity and accuracy in complex
mixtures, such as in WWTP inﬂuents (Rani et al. 2016). Even though many analyti-
cal methodologies have been developed to quantify AEDs in water bodies, the
search for fast and inexpensive techniques will go further to achieve the maximum
number of analytes and best sensitivity. These challenges motivate new research and
environmental policies worldwide.
10.2.1 Risk Assessment of AEDs
To assess and manage environmental risks of emerging contaminants, it is necessary
to know their ecological exposure and associated hazards. Toxicological assessment
is an important study ﬁeld to understand the risks of AEDs release in the environ-
ment. Toxicological analyses are mainly based on lethal dose (LD50) or lethal
concentration (LC50) indicators. In summary, the indicators represent the concentra-
tion that eliminates 50% of the evaluated organisms, considering ingestion or
inhalation contact (Jjemba 2008).
For instance, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and valproic acid have been
associated with changes in human lipid metabolism, leading to an increased risk of
cardiovascular accidents (Fox et al. 2020) and an increase in the rate of congenital
malformations when administered during pregnancy (Pickrell et al. 2014). From the
environmental point of view, LD50 and LC50 indicators have been monitored in
10

ecotoxicological studies with the microcrustacean Daphnia similis, conﬁrming the
effect of carbamazepine in mobility and reproduction health of the tested organism
(Chen et al. 2019).
The potential risks of AEDs to the environment can be assessed using a procedure
guideline from the European Medicines Agency. The procedure takes place by
determining the capacity of drugs to bioaccumulate along the food chain, their
mobility, and the predicted environmental concentration in the aquatic environment.
However, most pharmaceutical compounds do not show toxicity under the
conditions of traditional assays (which include tests, e.g., for acute and reproductive
toxicity and carcinogenic effects), and most studies available in the literature are
based on the mathematical prediction of no-effect concentrations (Cunha et al.
2019).
Another analysis used is the Hazard Quotient (HQ), or risk quotient (RQ), which
considers the occurrence and ecotoxicological data to deﬁne the potential environ-
mental risk caused by a contaminant. The purpose of this analysis is to assist
environmental agencies in updating the lists of priority substances. Verlicchi et al.
(2012) investigated the RQ of hospital and WWTP efﬂuent samples containing
73 pharmaceutical compounds. The authors identiﬁed that the AEDs carbamazepine
and diazepam have low environmental risk.
It is worth emphasizing that pharmaceutical compounds are designed to alter
target organisms’ biochemical, physiological, and behavioral functions. It is then
possible that nontarget organisms in the aquatic ecosystem undergo functional and
behavioral changes due to these compounds’ presence (Cunha et al. 2019). Several
toxic effects are observed in organisms in nonstandardized tests, which are often not
considered in the risk assessment. In this sense, it is essential to consider the
ecotoxicological data from nonstandardized trials to ﬁll existing gaps in the literature
and legislation, especially for AEDs increasingly used worldwide.
10.2.2 Ecotoxicity of AEDs
The persistence of AEDs in the environment, even in trace concentrations (ng L1 to
μg L1), has brought the necessity of understanding the contaminants’ fate and
transport and their effects on organisms in the environment. They can bioaccumulate
in the tissues of living organisms through water absorption and ingestion (Naghdi
et al. 2018), in addition to the possibility of bioaccumulation at different trophic
levels, through the biomagniﬁcation of food chains (Wang et al. 2020).
It is essential to use organisms from different trophic levels to understand and
evaluate pharmaceutical compounds’ fate in the environment. The most-reported
organisms
in
ecotoxicity
assays
are
crustaceans
(Daphnia
magna),
algae
(Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), and bacteria (Vibrio ﬁscheri). In aquatic
ecosystems, primary consumers can be considered the main bioaccumulators of
pharmaceutical compounds.
Because CBZ has been on the market for years as a well-established and older
AED, it is the most prescribed medication for epilepsy treatment and is, therefore, an
218
N. Klanovicz et al.

essential indicator of the occurrence of drugs in the water. CBZ and its metabolites
are widely detected in wastewater at concentrations equal or higher than the parent
compound (Wang et al. 2020). For the reasons mentioned above, studies have been
focused on its ecotoxicity.
Nkoom et al. (2019) analyzed D. magna exposure’s effects to 5 and 100 μg L1 of
CBZ for 48 h and evaluated its bioconcentration capacity. At the end of the test, the
CBZ concentrations in the medium were 4.5 and 94.8 μg L1, respectively,
indicating its bioconcentration. The feeding and phototactic behavior were also
evaluated by exposing to concentrations of 5, 15, 50, and 100 μg L1, for 5 h and
7 days. The results showed that the organisms were unable to feed properly and
showed a decrease in negative phototactic behavior. The authors also conducted a
biochemical experiment with 150 neonates exposed to the AED in the same
concentrations as the feeding and phototactic behavior tests for 7 days. The activities
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and
glutathione reductase (GR) were determined, and the results indicate the oxidative
stress of the organism, caused by the accumulation of the compound and inhibition
of the antioxidant enzymes mentioned above. In addition, activity inhibition of
AChE was identiﬁed, indicating the potential for neurotoxicity.
Spirulina platensis was exposed to CBZ in Wang et al. (2020) study by adding
the drug (varying from 1 to 100 mg L1) to the Zarrouk medium containing
microalgae suspension. After 10 days of cultivation, there was a decrease in the
algae growth compared to the control. At higher concentrations (50 and
100 mg L1), there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the organism’s biochemical
characteristics and photosynthetic activity due to the change in antioxidant enzymes’
activity.
Herrmann et al. (2015) studied the toxicity of the phototransformation products of
gabapentin (GAB) through V. ﬁscheri and Salmonella typhimurium. The ﬁrst organ-
ism was applied to investigate the inﬂuence of GAB on the bacteria luminescence,
and the second to study the effects of GAB by-products on genotoxicity. Twenty-
seven phototransformation products were formed shortly after the start of photolysis.
After 128 min of irradiation, inhibitory effects occurred, indicating an increase in
short-term bacterial cytotoxicity and an even more pronounced long-term
antibacterial activity for samples collected during photolysis. The results suggest
that GAB phototransformation products may have a considerably higher toxic
potential than the parent compound.
The ecotoxicity of transformation products (TPs) generated during wastewater
treatment is paramount for choosing the appropriate treatment and avoiding envi-
ronmental risks. Li et al. (2011) studied different processes for disinfecting synthetic
wastewater and investigated the toxicity of oxcarbazepine TPs in D. magna. The
solutions disinfected with UV, prepared in synthetic surface waters, exhibited an
increase of acute toxicity to the organism due to acridine formation during the
process.
Donner et al. (2013) investigated the toxicity of TPs (acridine and acridone)
produced during UV photolysis of CBZ in wastewater efﬂuents, using organisms of
different trophic levels. The following standardized ecotoxicity tests were
10
Antiepileptic Drugs: From Public to Environmental Health Problem
219

performed: inhibition of V. ﬁscheri bioluminescence, inhibition of P. subcapitata
growth, and immobilization of D. magna. There was 70% inhibition of V. ﬁscheri
bioluminescence after 25 min of treatment and 100% of P. subcapitata growth in
20 min. D. magna only demonstrated a measurable toxic effect after 45 min of
treatment, indicating that this organism was the least sensitive to the CBZ exposure.
These results suggest that TPs may be signiﬁcantly more harmful than the parent
contaminants.
10.3
Biochar-Based Process for Anticonvulsants Removal from
Wastewater
Carbonaceous materials for drug removal in wastewater have shown signiﬁcant
advances over the past decade. Characteristics like high surface area and thermal
and chemical stability make these materials adsorbing efﬁciencies greater than 90%
in most cases (Cai and Larese-Casanova 2014). In this scenario, biochar has stood
out among contaminant removal processes, mainly because it is a carbon-rich
material, derived from biological residues, highly heterogeneous, porous, and with
the presence of functional groups on the surface (Chu et al. 2019).
Pyrolysis of residual biomass is the main strategy for biochar production for
remediation processes, whose characteristics will depend on the nature of the
precursor material and the pyrolysis parameters (Nidheesh et al. 2021). The pyroly-
sis of biosolids to generate biochar as a micropollutant adsorbent is interesting since
the biochar can be recycled back to the pyrolysis process after removing the
pollutants, considering that the pyrolysis step will remove the compounds, as already
observed for antibiotics and hormones. Consequently, residual biomass pyrolysis to
produce biochar can offer a sustainable alternative to remove micropollutants from
wastewater by adsorption (Tong et al. 2019).
The raw biochar’s absorption capacity can be improved by functionalization
processes, applying different chemicals to the material to increase the system’s
efﬁciency (Tan et al. 2016). As for the application of biochar in AEDs, a recent
advance in research can be seen, however, mostly limited to carbamazepine remedi-
ation (Liang et al. 2020). Therefore, the adsorption mechanisms of this drug and
others in biochar are still being discussed.
Biochar functionalized with copper oxide showed high speciﬁc surface area and
pore volume associated with Cu2+ ions as a pore-forming agent, being able to
remove twice the concentration of carbamazepine compared to crude biochar
(Liang et al. 2020). Chen et al. (2017) described the dependence of adsorption
mechanisms of carbamazepine in biochar with the presence of aromatic carbon in
the structure, resulting from the increase in pyrolysis temperature, where the highest
concentration was adsorbed. In amorphous carbon, the drug was adsorbed to a lower
concentration but more quickly. The authors also addressed that hydrophobic and
π-π interactions were probably the most prevalent in this system.
Recent studies have shown biochar application for the removal of other anticon-
vulsant drugs with promising results. Primidone was efﬁciently removed by three
220
N. Klanovicz et al.

different biochar types, demonstrating that the modiﬁed biochar can signiﬁcantly
impact decontamination (Yanala and Pagilla 2020). In the same way, lamotrigine
proved to be efﬁciently removed through biochar adsorption (Li et al. 2020).
Considering the characteristics of biochar, many potential applications are targeted,
mainly involving the removal of pollutants from wastewater, as it is a low-cost and
abundant matrix, in addition to easy production (Tan et al. 2016). Even so, attention
is drawn to the need to advance studies with AEDs in efﬂuents, mainly aiming at the
biochar production and optimization of adequate functionalization processes to
remove these contaminants.
10.3.1 Hybrid Treatment Systems with Advanced Oxidation
Processes
The combination of biochar with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has been
considered an exciting alternative for the degradation of emerging contaminants.
The versatility and sustainability of the carbonaceous material combined with
aqueous phase oxidation show several advances (Nidheesh et al. 2021). AOPs use
the power of highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals (HO•), hydrogen
radical (H•), hydrated electron (eaq
), sulfate radicals (SO4
•), peroxymonosulfate
radicals
(SO5
•),
superoxide
radicals
(O2
•),
singlet
oxygen
(1O2
•),
and
hydroperoxyl radials (HO•
2). The association of these processes in a hybrid system
allows high efﬁciency in the degradation of several organic compounds with a low
generation of residues during the treatment and potential mineralization of the
pollutants.
The high degradation efﬁciency is due to the combination of chemical and
physical properties of the biochar and to the possibility of using these materials as
catalysts in AOPs to activate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate, or as a
support material for metals and metal oxide composites. They can also act as a
cathode for H2O2 generation in the electro-Fenton process and ensure electron
transfer and separate photoexcited holes and electrons in photocatalysis. Addition-
ally, the biochar structure contains free radicals necessary for reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation, thus playing an essential role in AOPs. However, it is
necessary to note that the biochar suitable characteristics for application in hybrid
systems with AOPs are strongly associated with the biomass preparation procedure
(Nidheesh et al. 2021).
As a catalyst, biochar can be explored mainly for HO• and less pronounced for
SO4
•-mediated degradation. This fact may be related to the highest standard
reduction potential of HO• compared to SO4
•. Accordingly, hydrogen peroxide,
an oxidant widely used in AOPs, can be decomposed through interaction with free
radicals present in the biochar, with the generation of hydroxyl radicals (Nidheesh
et al. 2021). Similarly, according to the authors, the mechanism behind the activation
of persulfate forming SO4
• radicals depends on the hydroxyl groups present on the
carbon surface and also on the π-π* transitions in the biochar.
10
Antiepileptic Drugs: From Public to Environmental Health Problem

Furthermore, the presence of iron oxides in the biochar, obtained mainly from
sources such as rice husks and coconut husks, can promote Fenton reactions without
the need to use additional iron. Finally, as a cathode in electrochemical processes,
biochar is a potential material for the working electrode in electro-Fenton reactions.
The mechanism involved is related to highly perfect graphitization, porous nature,
and functional groups containing oxygen on the biochar surface (Nidheesh et al.
2021).
Nidheesh et al. (2021) recently reviewed the role of biochar in AOPs, showing
that around 25% of the hybrid system’s target application was related to pharmaceu-
tical removal (e.g., sulfamethazine, ciproﬂoxacin, tetracycline hydrochloride,
gemiﬂoxacin). At the same time, no studies with AEDs were mentioned. It is also
observed that different conﬁgurations of hybrid systems can be effectively applied.
Despite the several advantages of using this combined treatment approach, the
authors emphasize that the biochar-based catalyst in AOPs in real ﬁeld wastewater
must be further evaluated. Design of more compact and simple reactors, which can
accommodate biochar-based catalysts, is required for real ﬁeld applications. Hence,
pilot-scale studies have to be conducted to gain insight into the applicability at the
industrial level.
Despite the effectiveness of the hybrid system in drug removal, few studies
closely matched a combination of AOP and biochar for AEDs degradation. Liu
et al. (2019) achieved 97% of carbamazepine removal by coupling a reductive
process with zero valence iron and biochar. At the same time, AOPs have shown
an essential role in the degradation of AEDs, especially carbamazepine (Huang et al.
2021), primidone (Sgroi et al. 2021), and diazepam (Yang et al. 2020), all of them
belonging to the class of older AEDs.
As mentioned above, the biochar application for AEDs degradation has been
focused on carbamazepine. Recent studies show excellent degradation efﬁciencies
for different compounds, such as primidone (Yanala and Pagilla 2020) and
lamotrigine (Li et al. 2020). Therefore, the literature validates the critical role of
different non-combined AOPs and biochar for the effective treatment of wastewater
containing AEDs. It is also observed that the coupling of processes has shown
encouraging results for other classes of drugs, mainly with regard to the low
biodegradability and high toxicity of these compounds.
In this regard, a good response is expected from the application of hybrid systems
combining biochar and AOP to remove antiepileptics, since the behavior for most of
the drugs already studied is quite impressive. In addition, the exploration of second-
and third-generation AEDs is expected, as studies generally focus on older AEDs.
Thus, an opportunity opens up for future investigations in this area.
10.3.2 Biochar as a Support Material in Enzymatic Biocatalysis
The degradation or transformation of emerging contaminants can be catalyzed
biologically using a wide spectrum of enzymes and microorganisms. Enzymatic
biocatalysis is an environmentally safe alternative, low energy consuming, and
222
N. Klanovicz et al.

operated under moderate conditions. In this scenario, microorganisms and enzymes
stand out as a promising pathway for the selective removal of contaminants in
wastewater, including AEDs.
The biodegradation of drugs can be directly catalyzed by oxidoreductase
enzymes or by applying microorganisms that produce a consortium of enzymes
(Yang et al. 2021). Fungal enzymes, mainly produced by white-rot fungi, have been
evaluated for this purpose due to their action on a wide spectrum of substrates
(Naghdi et al. 2018). Other microorganisms have also been studied, such as the
bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Shewanella putrefaciens (Yang et al. 2021).
Although each enzyme has speciﬁcities and unique mechanisms of action
resulting from different producing microorganisms and environmental conditions,
the principle of all oxidoreductases is based on the generation of free radicals and
ions, responsible for the biotransformation of compounds in subsequent reactions.
The most-reported oxidoreductase enzymes for removing emerging compounds are
lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), versatile peroxidase, laccase
(Lac), and tyrosinases (Bilal et al. 2019). Lac is the most used enzyme for drug
removal, mainly because it has low speciﬁcity and uses oxygen as an electron
acceptor. This allows the catalysis of a wide spectrum of compounds, making it
relevant in wastewater treatment systems (Viancelli et al. 2020).
Reactions catalyzed by enzymes generally do not mineralize the substrate but
form free radicals that can be disintegrated into fractions of transformation products,
which may have less toxicity or be more biodegradable than the parent compounds.
Therefore, oxidative enzymes for wastewater treatment are an attractive route for
removing micropollutants (Unuoﬁn et al. 2019). However, one of the signiﬁcant
challenges of the enzymatic process performance in WWTPs to remove recalcitrant
compounds, such as AEDs, is the process’s stability, which can be affected by
variations in operational parameters. Besides, the use of enzymes in the free form
is not viable, considering that the entire enzyme would be lost with each batch.
To improve the process feasibility, techniques for immobilizing microbial cells
and enzymes have been widely evaluated. The immobilization process is carried out
by adhering the microorganism cells or enzymes to support materials, making it
advantageous due to easy handling, excellent stability, reuse potential, and greater
ability to withstand adverse conditions, including variations in pH and temperature,
and inhibitors’ presence. The use of carbon-based materials (such as biochar) as a
support material for immobilizing enzymes has demonstrated high efﬁciency,
making them an important advance for these processes (Zdarta et al. 2018). Enzymes
immobilized in biochar showed improved stability in relation to the free enzyme and
recyclability with low loss of enzyme activity, which is of great relevance for the
economic viability of wastewater treatment (Naghdi et al. 2017).
The adsorption method, conducted keeping the enzyme and biochar in contact, is
widely used because it is simple and economical. However, it occurs through weak
chemical bonds, thus facilitating enzyme leaching. The covalent bond immobiliza-
tion process has the main advantage of enzyme slower release and greater stability.
In continuous processes, immobilization by covalent bonds may be preferred
(Lonappan et al. 2018).
10
Antiepileptic Drugs: From Public to Environmental Health Problem
223

The use of enzymes or microorganisms immobilized in biochar in drug biodegra-
dation processes occurs through two main mechanisms: (1) enzymatic catalysis,
where the compound occupies the active sites of the enzyme through adsorption,
which are released following the enzymatic action; and (2) removal of compounds
by adsorption in the pores of the biochar, without degradation (Naghdi et al. 2017).
In the Naghdi et al. (2017) study, it was estimated that the ﬁrst mechanism was
responsible for more than 45% of carbamazepine removal from wastewater, while
the second one removed less than 30%, highlighting the relevance of enzyme
immobilization to increase efﬁciency and avoid rapid saturation of material adsorp-
tion sites, allowing for continuous treatment processes.
The functionalization of biochar through chemical processes is interesting for
immobilization since it leads to functional groups’ formation on the material surface.
This functionalization favors the formation of anchor points, providing stronger
connections between the support and the enzyme through electrostatic interactions
(Naghdi et al. 2017). After biochar functionalization with nitric acid and sulfuric
acid, the concentration of functional groups on the surface increased, and there was
no change in the material structure. The use of laccase immobilized in functionalized
biochar demonstrated the potential to reduce 86% of carbamazepine concentration
on secondary efﬂuent (Naghdi et al. 2017).
Advances related to biocatalysts immobilization to remove AEDs, whether by
microorganisms or enzymes, are still very scarce. This demonstrates a research ﬁeld
with a large gap, especially considering the persistence of these compounds in the
environment. In this scenario, it is essential to understand the biodegradation
pathways of anticonvulsants and the already reported efﬁciency of enzymes and
microorganisms to remediate these compounds.
When evaluating the drug lamotrigine in the biodegradation process with sub-
strate colonized by the fungus Pleorotus ostreatus with laccase activity, a 73%
reduction in the drug concentration was observed in just 5 min of incubation
(Hultberg et al. 2020). Another recent study reported that it took 20 days for 93%
lamotrigine biodegradation through the fungus Pleorotus ostreatus. The simulta-
neous presence of carbamazepine and lamotrigine in wastewater hindered the
biological removal of the compounds, in which case the removal of carbamazepine
was not affected. However, lamotrigine removal was slower, assuming that the
fungus oxidation mechanism of both drugs was the same (Chefetz et al. 2019).
Even in the absence of immobilization processes, these advances are relevant to the
understanding of biodegradation pathways and to the development of new
technologies from exploratory investigations with high efﬁciencies, as observed in
these studies.
It is essential to highlight that the immobilization of enzymes in biochar concom-
itant with its potential to remove AEDs is an area that is still little explored. Some
studies related to enzymatic immobilization in biochar with application purpose for
other classes of drugs, such as antibiotics and anti-inﬂammatories (Lonappan et al.
2018; Yang et al. 2021), reinforce the need for advances in research to remove AEDs
by enzymatic process combined with biochar. Also, the lack of newer AEDs
224

exploration is enormous in this research area, opening an opportunity for further
ﬁndings.
10.4
Conclusions and Future Perspectives
The perspectives explored in this chapter from the public to environmental health
problem of epilepsy disease and antiepileptic drugs shows considerable gaps to be
ﬁlled both in the pharmaceutical industry and in environmental sciences. Although
the availability of several medicines in the market for epilepsy treatment, especially
the older ones, just a few of them have been widely studied.
So far, the long-term consequences in people with epilepsy life treated by older
AEDs are worrying. Still, there is a lack of global engagement to solve the epilepsy
burden, from social to treatment aspects. This same gap has been seen to solve the
problems of wastewater treatment plants containing these drugs, increasing the
environmental risks caused by their disposal in water bodies.
The environmental regulation should be improved and reinforced to include more
emerging contaminants as target compounds, motivating the use of new
technologies in wastewater treatment. The lack of research on AEDs, especially
from second and third generations, investigating their fate, occurrence, translocation,
and biotransformation, emphasizes the task emergency. Efforts are required in order
to understand the removal mechanisms and associated toxicity of novel degradation
processes, such as hybrid systems combining biochar and advanced oxidation
processes, or enzymatic biocatalysis using biochar as a support material. These
treatment processes have great potential to ﬁll gaps in the environmental health
problem of anticonvulsants.

Biochar: A Futuristic Tool to Remove Heavy
Metals from Contaminated Soils
11
Hiren K. Patel, Maitrik P. Joshi, and Rishee K. Kalaria
Abstract
Biochar has seized interest due to its important impact on the remediation of
heavy-metal-contaminated soil. Based on the research accomplishments of
biochar remediation of heavy-metal-contaminated soils in recent years, a variety
of important aspects, including development and properties of biochar, remedia-
tion processes, remediation effects, and inﬂuencing factors, are examined for
research status and advancement in this sector. The following results have been
obtained: (a) Biochar has the advantages of low price, good performance, green-
ing, and enhancement of the soil. (b) Biomass materials and pyrolysis
temperatures inﬂuence the physicochemical properties of biochars. The adsorp-
tion of heavy metals on biochar can be enhanced by activation, magnetization,
oxidation, and digestion. (c) Two opposing factors are involved in the effects of
biochar on heavy metal mobility and bioavailability: the immobilization of heavy
metals to minimize bioavailability or the mobilization of heavy metals to improve
bioavailability. (d) Biochar can be used to improve the quality of the treated soil
with other solidifying materials. (e) Physical adsorption, ion exchange, electro-
static interaction, complexation, and precipitation comprise the adsorption pro-
cesses of heavy metals on biochar. Finally, future research is proposed, including
the development of a standardized biochar classiﬁcation criterion; the investiga-
tion of the effectiveness of biochar in the remediation of multicontaminant sites;
the illustration of the interactions between biochar and heavy metals in the diverse
soil environment; and the extension of the research scale from laboratory- and
small-scale in situ testing to large-scale and long-scale in situ testing.

Introduction
The inefﬁcient and intensive use of pesticides to manage crop pests and diseases led
to infection of agricultural soils and related ecosystems (Chiari et al. 2017; Jallow
et al. 2017; Mostafalou and Abdollahi 2017; Shahid et al. 2016; Tosi and Nieh 2019;
Khalid et al. 2020). Heavy metals are discharged from different industries viz.,
mining, metallic ﬁnishing, electroplating, glass, textiles, ceramics, and garage
batteries. Recently, there are growing considerations over water pollutants, which
in the long run directly or indirectly combine with agricultural land. Soil pollutants
with pesticides, herbicides, industrial water, and alternative practices (which contain
heavy metallic ions) can also additionally stop up in ﬂuctuations in physicochemical
properties and microbial properties of agricultural soils. As a soil health and human
health purpose of view it is essential to decrease the impact of heavy metal inside the
soil. To manage the venturesome results and preferably repair the system offerings
of infected soils, an array of in situ and ex situ remedy strategies are developed, as
properly as surface capping, encapsulation, landﬁlling, soil ﬂushing, soil washing,
soil emanation (air sparing), vacuum ventilation (vapor extraction), thermal extrac-
tion, electro kinetic extraction, chemical degradation, stabilization, solidiﬁcation,
vitriﬁcation, bioremediation, and phytoremediation (Zhu et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2018).
These strategies use physical, chemical, thermal, electrical, and biological strategies
and tactics to contain, immobilize, and in the end cast off soil contaminants
(Fig. 11.1). In the ﬁeld, all of the available solutions highlight the beneﬁts and
drawbacks of treatment potency, cost effectiveness, and pertinence (Liu et al. 2018).
Recently, biochar change has been investigated to relieve soil infection and facilitate
soil remedy (Chai et al. 2012; Houben et al. 2013; Koltowski et al. 2016; Ippolito
et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2020).
Biochar is a carbon-rich byproduct of pyrolyzing biomass at high temperatures
and low oxygen levels for biofuel production (Lehmann 2007) and though it’s type
of like alternative charcoals, biochar is outlined through its intentional application to
the soil for environmental applications (Lehmann and Joseph 2015). It contains
extremely condensed aromatic structures that face up to decomposition in soil and
therefore will correctly sequester some of the implemented carbon for lots of years to
centuries (Lehmann et al. 2006; Novak et al. 2009; Wardle et al. 2008). One
evaluation estimates that signiﬁcant use of biochar might mitigate up to 12% of
current anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Woolf et al. 2010; Biederman and Harpole
2013).

11.2
Preparations of Biochar
The physical and chemical residences of biochar rely absolutely on the categories of
feedstock and pyrolysis situations, i.e., temperature, residence time, reactor kind,
and heating rate. The most thermochemical procedures that are commonly used to
generate biochar square measure slow carbonization, fast pyrolysis, ﬂash carboniza-
tion, gasiﬁcation, and microwave assisted pyrolysis (Manya 2012). It’s true that
biochar produced at high temperatures (600C to 700C) contains less H and O
functional groups due to drying and deoxygenation of the biomass, but it also has a
very aromatic character with well-organized C layers and lower ion exchange
capacities (Uchimiya et al. 2011; Ahmad et al. 2014). On the opposite hand, the
biochar created at decreased temperature (300–400 C) suggests numerous natural
characters, aliphatic and cellulose kind systems and contain additional C—H and
C¼¼C functional group (Glaser et al. 2002). It is this advanced and heterogenous
physical and chemical composition of biochar that gives its wonderful properties of
contamination elimination via activity (Vithanage et al. 2015; Godwin et al. 2019).
11.2.1 Feedstocks
The feedstocks for each conventional and microwave-aided pyrolysis is biomass.
During pyrolysis the proportion of cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin content
determines the ratios of bio-oil, fueloline, and biochar in pyrolysis product. It has
Fig. 11.1 Preparation and application of biochar
11
Biochar: A Futuristic Tool to Remove Heavy Metals from Contaminated Soils
233

been incontestable that feedstocks with high lignin content produce the very best
biochar yield once pyrolyzed at slight temperatures, viz. 500 C (Fushimi et al.
2003). Therefore, selection of pyrolysis feedstocks is also decided by the required
stability between the various pyrolysis products (biochar, bio-oil, fueloline). Bio-
mass is any residing or lately residing organic material with the ability as a source of
energy (Motasemi and Afzal 2013). Biomass is believed to possess the ability to
become one of the foremost reasserts of energy in the subsequent century (Berndes
et al. 2003). The biomass as a source of energy is carbon-neutral, renewable,
promptly available in nature, comparatively decreased S (sulfur) content, and feature
the ability to be the maximum effective different to fuel sources. Replacing fuel with
biomass as a source of energy will reduce pollutants and global warming, alleviate
the energy disaster, and make contributions toward property development (Hall
1997; Panwar et al. 2011). Biomass sources will be classiﬁed into three essential
categories: (1) virgin sources, (2) residues, and (3) municipal solid waste (Motasemi
and Afzal 2013). The virgin sources include forest sources and oilseed/cereal crops.
The residues are also timber residues, agricultural residues, and wastes of livestock
residues. Municipal stable waste may be residential or non-residential. With an
acceptable conversion method those classes of biomass will be promising resets of
energy for the longer term. The municipal stable wastes and forest and agricultural
residues are promising substitutes for microwave pyrolysis processes. Extensive
study has been conducted using those lingo-cellulosic feedstocks, as well as virgin
sources and residues. wood, wood pellets, tea trash, coffee hulls, biodegradable
sewage sludge, wheat straw, rice straw, macro and microalgae, maize fodder all have
unquestionable fantastic potentials as pyrolysis feedstocks (Miura et al. 2004;
Domínguez et al. 2007; Yagmur et al. 2008; Budarin et al. 2009, 2011; Huang
et al. 2010; Godwin et al. 2019).
11.2.2 Conventional Pyrolysis
This is the standard heating system in which heat is transferred from an external
supply to the biomass through conductivity, radiation, and convection. In this
methodology, the heat/temperature on the ﬂoor of the feedstock is extremely exces-
sive and reduces toward the center of the feedstock. In standard pyrolysis method the
most important method variables are that (I) the heating is low and (II) the vapor
residence time is long (Manya 2012). This methodology has been used to manufac-
ture charcoal for many years. During this pyrolysis there are some known variables
that decide performance and yield of the process. These parameters are strain and
wet content material of the feedstock (Antal and Grønli 2003). The peak temperature
is the highest temperature reached during the conventional pyrolysis procedure. It
has been stated that a rise in the height temperature results in a rise in the biochar
ﬁxed-content material (Manya 2012). The operational strain of the pyrolysis method
has vital effect on the properties of the produced biochar. A study on the pyrolysis of
various biomass feedstocks (eucalyptus wood, radiata pine, sugar cane bagasse)
(Cetin et al. 2004) discovered that increasing the operational strain leads to a
234

decrease in the total expanse of the char. Similar results were conjointly reported
during a slow pyrolysis of Miscanthus (Melligan et al. 2011). They observed a major
decrease in BET expanse of char from 161.7 m2/g at 0.1 MPa to 0.137 m2/g at
2.6 MPa. The researchers attribute these ﬁndings to deposits of tar clogging the char
pores as a result of high strain. According to studies on the effects of wet content
material in biomass feedstocks, top moisture content material complements charcoal
production when subjected to high pressures. As a result, maximal biomass with
high moisture content is particularly appealing for biochar production via conven-
tional pyrolysis (Manya 2012). This pyrolysis approach is inefﬁcient and slow, and it
is also dependent on the biomass thermal conductivity as well as the system’s
convection present day (Godwin et al. 2019).
11.2.3 Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis of biomass using microwave entails strength conversion rather than mere
heating. At some point of this approach, electromagnetic energy is regenerated into
thermal energy by using dielectric heating (Motasemi and Afzal 2013). Furthermore,
the heat is generated during the biomass volume as a substitute than an external
supply. In contrast to typical pyrolysis, the temperature of the feedstock at its centre
is higher than the temperature of the components.
The microwave-aided pyrolysis approach is among the foremost promising
strategies of fast and improving chemical reactions. As an end result of the econom-
ical heat transfer proﬁle, the chemical reactions are completed at a shorter time and
efﬁciently in comparison with alternative thermo-chemical processes (Lidstrom et al.
2001; Salema et al. 2017; Nhuchhen et al. 2018). The advantages of this system over
competing pyrolysis strategies are that it accelerates chemical reactions and shortens
their duration, saving energy surface and time (Godwin et al. 2019).
11.2.4 Impregnation-Pyrolysis
The preparation of magnetic biochar by impregnation-pyrolysis is accomplished by
impregnating biomass with a solution containing transition metal salts while remov-
ing the solvent. The dried residue mufﬂe chamber is then pyrolyzed in an oxygen-
depleted or inert atmosphere to generate funding for the magnetic biochar product.
Thus, pyrolysis and magnetization are ﬁnished in a single step, thereby guaranteeing
that the physicochemical properties and surface assimilation capability of the mag-
netic biochar are tightly managed by the operative parameters (e.g., pyrolysis
temperature, inert gas, and pyrolysis time) (Li et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2019). For
example, Liu et al. (2020) discovered that the Cr (VI)-adsorption capacities of
magnetic biochar synthesized at varied temperatures (650–800 C) ranged from
182.32 to 223.21 mg/g and have been proportional to the pyrolysis temperature. Fur-
thermore, when the pyrolysis temperature rises, the species of iron oxides in
magnetic biochar are reduced. For example, Wang et al. (2019a, b) discovered that
11

235

the iron oxides present in magnetic biochar modiﬁed with a rise in pyrolysis
temperature. Hematite, magnetite, wustite, and zero-valent iron are the oxides that
develop as a function of temperature (Yi et al. 2019).
11.2.5 Co-precipitation
The synthesis of magnetic biochar by co-precipitation includes the dispersion of
biochar into a solution containing transition metals, accompanied by the addition of
sodium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide solution at a particular temperature and
the subsequent stirring of the aggregate for a period of time at pH scale 9–11. Next,
the supernatant is removed and consequently the residue is washed and then dried to
afford magnetic biochar. This methodology is more sophisticated than the
impregnation-pyrolysis methodology; however it is more manageable, allowing
the magnetic medium to be stably adhered to the biochar matrix. Recently,
researchers have consistently compared the pollutant-adsorption capability of mag-
netic biochar synthesized by two strategies. As an example, Wang et al. (2015)
demonstrated that magnetic biochar synthesized by co-precipitation had an adsorp-
tion capacity for arsenic that was sevenfold higher than that of magnetic biochar
synthesized
by
impregnation-pyrolysis.
Conversely,
Zhou
et
al.
(2019)
demonstrated that the magnetic biochar prepared by impregnation-pyrolysis
removed ﬂuoride more efﬁcaciously than did the magnetic biochar synthesized by
co-precipitation. Therefore, target waste characteristics ought to be notion before the
synthesis of magnetic biochar for pollutant removal, to modify the acceptable
artiﬁcial synthetic to be elite (Yi et al. 2019).
11.2.6 Reductive Co-deposition
The subtractive co-deposition approach is similar to the co-precipitation technique,
but it varies in that the transition metals are reduced in their mixture with biochar
using lowering agents like as sodium borohydride or potassium borohydride. Once
During the reaction, the supernatant is removed and consequently the residue is
washed and vacuum dried to get magnetic biochar. Surprisingly, this substance
contains nanoparticles and primarily zero-valent metals, which signiﬁcantly reduces
and increases the pollution removal performance of magnetic biochar. Zhu et al.
(2018) determined that the adsorption ability of reductively co-precipitated magnetic
biochar for Cr(VI) was 58.82 mg/g, in which maximum of the Cr(VI) turned into
decreased to Cr(III). As a result, magnetic biochar with improved pollutant- elimi-
nation performance is frequently synthesized using this technique; however, the
reluctant required is hazardous, and hydrogen is produced during the reduction
process, implying that this technique has some capability protection risks, particu-
larly if used at scale. (Yi et al., 2019).

11.2.7 Hydrothermal Carbonization
Hydrothermal carbonization is the heterogeneous reaction of biomass with a metal
particle solution at a lower temperature (100–300C) than pyrolysis, and at a
pressure generated by the reaction itself. These are milder reaction situations than
the previous ways, and besides the very fact that an alkali or a powerful reducer is not
required, this synthesis is more enticing. For instance, Zhang et al. (2018) success-
fully synthesized magnetic biochar by this hydrothermal technique from iron-
containing sludge and sludge at 473 K and used the ensuing product as a Fenton-
like catalyst to fully degrade methylene blue. Similarly, Cai et al. (2017) observed
that magnetic biochar synthesized by this technique had a maximum ﬂoor assimila-
tion capability for Cr (VI) of as much as 142.86 mg/g, which was more than that of
maximum magnetic biochars prepared by of co-precipitation (Shang et al. 2016),
subtractive co-deposition (Zhou et al. 2018), or impregnation-pyrolysis (Yi et al.
2019).
11.2.8 Other Preparation Methods
In recent years, alternative preparation strategies are developed like ball-milling
(solvent free mechanical combining of biochar and iron oxides) (Shang et al.
2016), direct pyrolysis of biomass/metal salts (also acknowledged as the molten
salt method) (Dai et al. 2019), cross-linking of biochar and iron oxides (Mojiri et al.
2019), and microwave-assisted pyrolysis (Yap et al. 2017). For example, Shang et al.
(2016) demonstrated that the surface assimilation capacities of magnetic biochar
synthesized by ball-milling of biochar and iron oxide for the pharmaceuticals
carbamazepine and tetracycline have been 62.7 mg/g and 94.2 mg/g, respectively.
Additionally, Dai et al. (2019) found that the herbicides dichlorophenol and atrazine
have been very efﬁciently eliminated by magnetic biochar synthesized by the molten
salt technique. To further enhance the utility of magnetic biochar in environmental
remediation, several researchers have treated it with alternative metals, or with acids
and bases, or functionalized it with varied chemical moieties to enhance its surface
assimilation property and capability. For example, Li et al. (2017) determined that
the amendment of magnetic biochar with the linear polysaccharide chitosan yielded
a material with advanced surface morphology and considerably improved surface
assimilation capability for Cd (II). Similarly, Li et al. (2017) CeO2–MoS2 treated
magnetic biochar showed a maximum surface assimilation capability for lead of
263.6 mg/g, which was several times higher than untreated magnetic biochar. The
maximum ordinarily used strategies have been impregnation-pyrolysis (39%) and
co-precipitation (30%). Hydrothermal carbonization, subtractive co-deposition, and
other artiﬁcial strategies are alternative methods to get magnetic biochar. Therefore,
the character of the stuff, the physicochemical properties of the pollutants, and
consequently the technique operability ought to be rigorously thought about when
choosing an artiﬁcial method to magnetic biochar (Yi et al. 2019).

11.2.9 Biochar Made Using from Nanoparticle
Metal nanoparticles of biochar will be produced by pretreating biomass mistreatment
with metallic salt before pyrolysis. Firstly, the biomass is impregnated with metallic
salts (FeCl3, Fe(NO3)3, AlCl3, MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, etc.), sulfur-based
metallic salts, and natural primarily based totally metallic salts solutions in an
electrical area or no electric powered area (Jung and Ahn 2016). Metallic ions
from the solutions are deposited onto the surface or indoors of feedstocks. Secondly,
the pretreated biomass is pyrolyzed at comparatively decreased temperature begin-
ning from 400 to 800 C in an O2 limited or O2-free surroundings when drying.
In the pyrolysis techniques, metallic ions are going to be reborn to metallic oxide
nanoparticles (Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, MnO2, CaO, ZnO, etc.) or zero valent ions on
the surface of biochar. For instance, Fe3O4 in most cases primarily based totally
magnetic biochar become ready with the aid of using the pyrolysis of FeCl3
pretreated corn straw in an electrical ﬁeld at 600
C for 1 h (Yang et al.
2019). The presence of evenly dispersed rod-like Fe3O4 nanoparticles was con-
ﬁrmed by characterization of Fe3O4 on a fully magnetic biochar surface in the
majority of cases. Additionally, the end result unconcealed that Fe3O4 primarily
based magnetic biochar conﬁrmed an impressive lead surface assimilation capabil-
ity. A unique magnesium impregnated biochar was prepared through the pyrolysis of
MgCl2 pretreated biomass feedstock at 10 C/min as much as 600 C under O2
limited situations for 1 h (Chen et al. 2018). The consequences conﬁrmed that nano
sized magnesium oxides were equally distributed on the surface of biochar with a
thickness of over 4.3 nm and MgO biochar displayed a mesoporous shape with
common pore length of 1.74μm. The MgO biochar composites exhibited excessive
phosphate surface assimilation capability from solution. Thermal pyrolysis of bis-
muth oxide and hydrochloric acid pretreatment wheat straw at 400 to 600 C with a
heating rate of 10 C/min in a highly nitrogen environment atmosphere for 1 hour
produced bismuth impregnated biochar (Zhu et al. 2016). Morphology examination
indicated that the ﬂourishing pore shape with a diameter between 0.5 and 1μm
become ascertained in bismuth impregnated biochar and consequently the white
global debris have been ﬁrmly grafted in the internal and outer surface of biochar. For
phosphorus, arsenic, and chromium, bismuth-modiﬁed biochar shown a high capac-
ity for ﬂoor assimilation. A useful biochar supported magnetic MnFe2O4 nano
composite become ready through the pyrolysis of Fe (NO3)3 and Mn(NO3)2
pretreated corn straw at 500 C in a very element environment for 5 h (Zhang
et al. 2019). Characterization consequences indicated that magnetic MnFe2O4 debris
have been with success supported on surface of biochar and conﬁrmed excessive
dispersion at the ﬂoor of biochar. Furthermore, the composite conﬁrmed wonderful
overall performance in the elimination of Cd (II) and Pb (II) (Liu et al. 2020).
The second synthesis technique of metal nanoparticles of biochar is assisting
metallic nanoparticles onto biochar. Firstly, the biomass become reborn to biochar
by pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization and gasiﬁcation. Afterward, biochar
become soaked inside the metallic salts solution and metallic ions have been
adsorbable to the pores and surface of biochar. Finally, metallic nanoparticles have
238
H. K. Patel et al.

been brought about onto the surface of biochar to make the composites by using the
reduction technique of pyrolysis adjustment of metallic salt solution pH and alterna-
tive ways (Liao et al. 2018). For example, Kim et al. (2019) studied that iron changed
biochar and utilized it to get rid of arsenite from water. Miscanthus become foremost
pyrolyzed to provide biochar at 500 C with a rate of 10 C/min for 1 h in a nitrogen
present in environment. Iron ions have been precipitated onto biochar by the
adjustment of pH to 9 with sodium hydroxide. Fe modiﬁed biochar exhibited
advanced overall performance on the surface assimilation of arsenite. The sewage
sludge become foremost pyrolyzed at 600 C with a rate of 10 C/min in a nitrogen
present in atmosphere for 3 h to arrange sewage sludge derived biochar and
afterward zero valent iron nanoparticles have been immobilized on biochar (Diao
et al. 2018). Characterization effects conﬁrmed that lots of porous systems have been
ascertained and zero valent iron nanoparticles have been deposited on the surface of
biochar. Pb2+ and Cr6+ may also be efﬁciently removed. Biochar supported iron
nanoparticles are created and are utilized to remove heavy metals from aqueous
solution (Zhu et al. 2016). The wetland plant become foremost pyrolyzed reed to
arrange biochar at a temperature of 600 C for 1.5 h under N2 condition. Nanoscale
zero valent iron become prepared via the chemical reduction technique and it had
been supported onto the surface of biochar. Wan et al. (2017) used available biochar
to support MgFe and MgAl double hydroxides for phosphate recovery from waste-
water. Bamboo biochar become foremost ready by using slow pyrolysis of bamboo
at 600 C in nitrogen present in atmosphere for 2 h. The metallic hydroxide has been
brought about onto biochar by adjusting solution pH. Characterization end result
analysis conﬁrmed biochar may also act as a good aid for MgFe and MgAl
superimposed double hydroxides. The experimental consequences indicated that
the composites displayed excessive phosphate surface assimilation (Liu et al. 2020).
The third synthesis technique reportable to arrange metal nanoparticles of biochar
is when pyrolyzing the biomass enriching the goal metallic component (Dai et al.
2019; Cho et al. 2019; Mian et al. 2019). The metallic component inside the biomass
is reborn to metallic nanoparticles by using thermal pyrolysis. For instance, a
calcium wealthy biochar is created by direct carbonization of crab shell at
300–900 C with the heating rate of 10 C/min for 2 h and it had been used for
phosphorus elimination (Dai et al. 2019). Characterization evaluation indicated the
most metallic component calcium and consequently the formation of lime in crab
shell biochar. The elimination experiments prompt that calcium wealthy biochar is
used for the elimination of phosphate in water. An enriched magnesium biochar is
created by direct carbonization of magnesium wealthy tomato tissues at 600 C for
2 h in nitrogen surroundings (Yao et al. 2013). Scanning electron microcopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction conﬁrmed a mass of nanoscale
periclase and magnesium hydroxide particles existed in the built biochar. The
material exhibited a higher elimination capacity to phosphate from wastewater.
Crayﬁsh shell become at once pyrolyzed at 600 C with a heating rate of 15 C/
min for 2 h to arrange a calcium rich biochar for lead surface assimilation (Zhang
et al. 2019). Scanning electron microcopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform
infrared spectrometry evaluation conﬁrmed that crayﬁsh shell biochar had a mass of
11
Biochar: A Futuristic Tool to Remove Heavy Metals from Contaminated Soils
239

CaCO3 particles on its surface. Calcium enrich crayﬁsh shell biochar may also be
extremely powerful for lead elimination from water. A built biochar is created by
direct carbonization of magnesium-rich tomato tissues at 600 C in nitrogen sur-
roundings to get better phosphorus from waste water (Yao et al. 2013). Characteri-
zation consequences indicated that the novel built biochar had an oversized variety
of magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles. This biochar derived
from magnesium-enriched tomato tissues displayed robust phosphate surface assim-
ilation capacity. In the artiﬁcial techniques of metallic nanoparticles of biochar a few
factors like the feedstocks varieties, pyrolysis temperature, ratio of biochar and
metallic nanoparticles, and pyrolytic response media have an impact on the
properties and overall performance of metallic nanoparticles of biochar. Initially,
different feedstock varieties result in different compositions, such as cellulose,
hemicellulose, lignin, and inorganic salt (Liu et al. 2020).
11.3
Properties of Biochar
Biochar is often used not only as a soil amendment with the goal of improving soil
physical, chemical, and biological properties, but additionally as an adsorbent to
remove organic and inorganic pollutants. The capabilities and applications of
biochars largely depend on their structural and physicochemical properties; so, it is
vital to represent the structural and physicochemical properties of biochar before its
use. Various types of biomass (wood, agricultural wastes, dairy farm manure,
sewage sludge, and so on) are used to produce biochars under a variety of pyrolysis
conditions. Different feedstock reassets and pyrolysis method situations contribute
to different structural and physical traits of biochar, including structural complexity,
extent, porosity, particle size distribution, density, and mechanical strength
(Lehmann and Joseph 2015; Plaimart et al. 2020). During pyrolysis, biomass
undergoes a variety of physical, chemical, and molecular changes. Pyrolysis circum-
stance and feedstock type considerably affect the structural and physicochemical
traits of the ensuing biochar product (Zhao et al. 2017).
Biochar is porous, displaying a tough morphological surface with honeycomb
like anatomical or different abnormal structures under the microscope. The inherent
micropores (diameter in the range of 0.8–235μm and mostly large, with average at
10μm; Hardie et al. 2014) engender the material a comparatively excessive intrapore
volume (e.g., 0.9–1 cm3 g1; Batista et al. 2018) and low envelope density (e.g.,
0.2–0.6 g cm3; Joseph et al. 2019). Biochar consists frequently of amorphous,
aromatic carbon and possesses over abundant oxygen containing surface functional
groups (e.g., –C¼O, –COOH, and –OH). A disorderly stacked graphene sheet shape
has been projected for biochar. The aromaticity of biochar usually will increase
whereas the surface practicality decreases due to the fact that the pyrolysis tempera-
ture is elevated (Song and Guo 2012; Zhao et al. 2016). That is often an outcome of
the innovative losses of aliphatic C–H, oleﬁnic C¼C, carbonyl, carboxyl, and
hydroxyl groups at a higher temperature (Fu et al. 2012; Tan et al. 2015; Guo
et al. 2020).
240
H. K. Patel et al.

Biochar will play a crucial position in improving nutrient retention in soil largely
due to its surface charge density (Kongthod et al. 2015). Biochar largely has
negatively charged surfaces that will increase the surface assimilation capability of
cation species (Lou et al. 2016). Biochar has gained interest in the multidisciplinary
areas of global warming mitigation, soil amendment, crop production enhancement,
and carbon sequestration (Glaser et al. 2002; Laird 2008; Tan et al. 2015). Biochar
has good capacity for increasing soil fertility (Ahmad et al. 2014). This could be
partly attributed to effects on soil microbiology that scale back fertilizer losses via
leaching (Atkinson et al. 2010; Tan et al. 2015; Plaimart et al. 2020). Generally,
woody biomass provides a plenty of carbon-rich biochar as compared to other
feedstocks because it contains variable quantities of hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin,
and tiny portions of different natural extractives and inorganic compounds. Xu and
Chen (2013) recommend that better lignin and mineral content result in a higher
yield of biochar. Therefore, woody biomass is one of the vital sources for biochar
production. The structural and physicochemical properties of biochar, like extent,
pore structures, surface functional groups, and element composition, may be
inﬂuenced by varying the pyrolysis circumstance, like pyrolysis temperature,
heating rate, and keeping time. The pyrolysis temperature is reported to considerably
inﬂuence the ultimate structural and physicochemical properties of biochar due to
the discharge of volatiles and the formation and volatilization of intermediate melts.
Previous research indicated that better temperature resulted in a very better C content
material, whereas the losses of nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) were
additionally recorded. Additionally, increasing the temperature causes a rise in the
ash and stuck carbon contents and lowers the content material of unstable materials.
Furthermore, the rise in pyrolysis temperature inﬂuences H/C and O/C ratios,
porosity, surface area, surface functional groups, cation exchange capability
(CEC), and so on (Zhao et al. 2017).
11.4
Remediation of Biochar
Biochar has been explored for mitigating soil heavy metal contamination. Reported
analysis using laboratory vessel, greenhouse pot, and subject plot experiments
indicates that biochar is capable of efﬁcaciously sorbing heavy metallic cations
from water and immobilizing heavy metallic elements in soil and thus serves as a
promising amendment for decreasing the eco-toxicity of heavy metal contaminated
soils (Guo et al. 2010, 2020; Ahmad et al. 2014; Tan et al. 2015; O’Connor et al.
2018).
Biochar is often used for the correction of soils (or sediments) that are
contaminated by inorganic and organic compounds. It is high sorption capability
together with its high surface area applicable to immobilize contaminants. Thus, the
contaminants will not be eliminated from the matrix however sequestered. It
is assumed that the contaminants will not be freed into the matrix until the biochar
is degraded. A close discussion concerning the steadiness of biochar over the years is
the primary target of this paper. However, the average residence times of pyrogenic
11
Biochar: A Futuristic Tool to Remove Heavy Metals from Contaminated Soils
241

organic memories examined under various ﬁeld settings varied widely, ranging from
6 to 5448 years (Lehmann et al. 2015). A component of this variability owes to the
real fact that the models to calculate the mean residence times differed, or that
pyrogenic organic matter properties or experimental tactics were completely differ-
ent (Lehmann et al. 2015; Hilber et al. 2017).
11.4.1 Biochar for Remediation of Soils Contaminated with Organic
Compounds
Biochars used for remediation were better suited to immobilize organic than inor-
ganic contaminants (Xie et al. 2015) and activated charcoal reduced organic
contaminants more effectively than biochar (Hale et al. 2015). The biochars’
comparatively low KD (Soil and sediment solid/liquid partition coefﬁcients) values
compared to in situ KOC caused the modest end outcome. As compared to these, the
KOC (tendency of a chemical to bind to soils) values no longer contain carbona-
ceous geosorbents like black carbon, coal, or kerogen that clearly arise in organic
matter and exhibit a 10–100 times higher sorption capability than amorphous OC
(Cornelissen et al. 2001). None of the char amendments decreased DDT uptake in
plants. The C free was assessed by the polyoxymethylene (POM) passive sampler
proxy and correlated well with the availability of the earthworms, but no longer with
the phytoavailability (Denyes et al. 2016). So, completely different endpoints
(earthworms, plants, proxy) under globe situations indicated contradicting results
and consequently the form and kind of char inﬂuences the end result. The restricted
data of only ﬁeld study with biochar leads to inconclusive results. Equilibrium times
are, besides the weathering of biochars in soils or sediments, important and need to
be taken into consideration before deciding over success or failure of remedy of
contaminated sites with biochar (or activated charcoal). Positive or immobilization
effects cannot be anticipated to be reached at once, as equilibration instances are also
terribly lengthy for biochar or AC modiﬁcation. A polychlorinated biphenyl-
contaminated sediment that was amended with 2% AC reached equilibrium after
about 2000–2500 days (Werner et al. 2006). When the batch experiment was mixed,
the C free was decreased to a tenth of its original concentration after only 50 days;
however once it had been left unmixed, the same result was reached not until about
900 days (Werner et al. 2006; Hilber et al. 2017).
11.4.2 Biochar for Remediation of Soil Contaminated with Heavy
Metals
The sorption characteristics of biochar may scale back the bioavailability of
unsought elements and reduce ecotoxic outcomes (Karer et al. 2015). Nutrients
from organic soil additives together with biochar may enhance the productivity of
marginal lands with contaminated soils. As for other soil remediation technologies, it
is necessary to survey the site-speciﬁc soil and contaminant situations and to check
242
H. K. Patel et al.

the efﬁcacy of the meant remediation technology at small scale. Different
combinations of contaminants might also additionally require bespoke biochars or
combinations of biochars with different sorption characteristics. The dominance of
the superb or the poor face of biochar for remediation functions relies upon the
component and its speciation. Whereas metals occurring predominantly in cationic
form are bound by biochar, anionic metals and metalloids won’t be immobilized by
biochar and display a frowny. Elements like As, B, and Mo that predominantly arise
in anionic form are rather mobilized due to negative surface charges of biochar, pH
outcomes, and opposition with DOC for binding sites (Beesley et al. 2014). In the
following we pay attention on current subject research concerning remediation of
heavy metal contaminated sites. The foremost investigated heavy metals are Cd and
Pb in paddy rice soils (Cui et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2016) or Zn and Ni (Shen et al.
2016). The uptake of Cd by rice grain was reduced by 57–86% over two seasons
(Chen et al. 2016) and by 17–62% over 2 years (Cui et al. 2011). The study of Shen
et al. (2016) described that 0.5–2% biochar amendment conﬁrmed reduced acid
leachates of Ni and Zn by 83–98% over 3 years, which was comparable to the
cement-based treatment performed at constant site in parallel. Despite the fact that
the contaminant’s absorption into plants was reduced in the preceding study, plants
react differentially to the biochar amendment, for example, various rice cultivars
reacted differently to Cd uptake. (Chen et al. 2016) or no grass may be planted on the
subject (Shen et al. 2016). These results suggest that though biochar has wonderful
sorption capacities for heavy metals, other factors like the plant species, the contam-
inant itself, and the impact of the biochar on soil conditions like pH, available
nutrients, earthworm habitats, etc. (Beesley et al. 2014) are required for a site-
speciﬁc
self-reclamation.
Shaheen
and
Rinklebe
(2015)
compared
the
immobilisation of Cd and Pb by biochar, chitosan, nanohydroxyapatite, and
organoclay to low-cost alternative materials such as limestone, zeolite, bentonite,
and others. n research lab and ﬁeld tests, they discovered that in rapeseed, the
availability of elements from soil to soil solutions was altered for Cd and Pb ﬂood
plain in response to biochar additions. 100% shows that same elemental means in
soils with and while without biochar. 50% implies that in soils with biochar the
elements have been only half as available as in soils while without biochar. 200%
implies that in soils with biochar the elements had double the provision as compared
to soil while without biochar. The decreased availability can be a positive impact. All
research that conﬁrmed increased availabilities of heavy metals after biochar
amendments have been marked with a frowny. The biochar and chitosan
amendments decreased the Cd concentrations in the plant, and thus did zeolite and
bentonite. In contrast, the amendment with limestone increased the Cd concentration
in B. napus. Limestone increased the carbonate fraction (CaCO3 content material in
limestone is 98.5%), which induced Cd precipitation and complexation with
carbonates, and was then mobilized inside the acid rhizosphere zone and brought
up into the plant (Shaheen and Rinklebe 2015). The researchers proposed to take
beneﬁt of this increased phyto-extraction for Cd for the utilization of rapeseed as
bioenergy crop. Biochar might indirectly remediate Cd-contaminated soils by
phytoremediation. The consequences of the rising amendments, besides organo-
11
Biochar: A Futuristic Tool to Remove Heavy Metals from Contaminated Soils
243

clay, conﬁrmed also a minimized uptake of Pb into the plant, so did all low value
amendments besides zeolite. It has been concluded that subject and long-term study
with biochar and contaminated soils are extremely limited for both natural pollutants
and heavy metals, implying future research needs (Zhang et al. 2013). Another
aspect of biochar amendment can be the decreased mineralization as opposed to
the immobilization and occasional bioavailability and accessibility of the
contaminants. These outcomes of contrary directions, immobilization, and microbial
degradation of biochar or activated charcoal amendment need to be rigorously and
consistently evaluated (Gouliarmou et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015; Hilber et al.
2017).
Heavy metals in soil will be degraded, posing a risk to the ecosystem. They will
enter the food chain through plants and move into bodies of water (Nathanail and
Bardos (2005) used the source pathway receptor model to simplify the interaction
between organisms and heavy metals, indicating that heavy metal-infected locations
may be remediated by removing sources, removing the pathway, or modifying the
publicity to the receiver (Fig. 11.2) (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
Biochar can immobilize heavy metals in the soil, thereby decreasing their mobil-
ity and bioavailability. At the same time, addition of biochar to the soil reduces the
strength of the soil. Therefore, in this section, the outcomes of biochar on heavy
metal contaminated soils are reviewed from the aspects of mobility, bioavailability
and strength (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
Biochar will sorb heavy metals and scale back their environmental dangers in
soil. Batch experiments (e.g., toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and
column leaching) are useful to measure the leachability of heavy metals in biochar
treated with contaminated soils. Properties of biochar created from different biomass
feedstocks are usually different, which inﬂuences the mobility of heavy metals in the
soil. Conversely, biochar can also mobilize the heavy metals from soil particles to
soil solutions. For instance, arsenic and phosphorus have competitive adsorption on
the surface of biochar. The addition of biochar increased phosphorus in the soil and
thus forced additional arsenic to be leached out due to the competitive adsorption
(Hartley et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2019a, b).
Biochar can also immobilize heavy metals through reduction. For example, in the
environment, Cr exists in two main forms: trivalent (chromium (III)) and hexavalent
(chromium (III)). Chromium (III) is usually non-toxic and tightly attached to soil
particles, whereas chromium (VI) is very poisonous and mobile. Cr (VI) hazards can
frequently be reduced by lowering Cr (III) levels (Choppala et al. 2012). The oxygen
functional group on the surface of biochar reduces the mobility of Cr (VI) in the soil
via inﬂuencing its redox response. Choppala et al. (2015) investigated two carbon
substances (chicken manure biochar and black carbon) for their effects on the
reduction of hexavalent Cr (chromium (VI)) in two spiked (600 mg Cr (VI)/kg)
and one tannery waste-contaminated (454 mg Cr (VI)/kg) soils. The results con-
ﬁrmed that the addition of carbon substances enhanced the reduction of Cr and the
subsequent immobilization of chromium (III) in soils. The reduction rate of Cr
(VI) in the black loam-recovery sandy loam was up to 75%. Under aerobic
conditions, the quality and toxicity of arsenic (III) in soil is better than those of
244
H. K. Patel et al.

arsenic (V). Biochar might reduce arsenic (V) to arsenic (III), thereby improving
arsenic mobility (Ahmad et al. 2014). The application of biochar might cause
increased mobility of arsenic. Therefore, different amendments are required to offset
this negative effect. Studies have determined that the application of iron oxide
magnetizes biochar and decreases the mobility of arsenic in soil by anion exchange
(Warren et al. 2003). It can be seen that biochar might immobilize or mobilize heavy
metals in soil, depending on the categories of heavy metals and biochar properties
(Wu et al. 2012). The type of soil signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the effectiveness of
biochar. Shen et al. (2016) implemented a hardwood biochar to a sandy
contaminated soil (95% sand) and discovered a signiﬁcant decrease in leached nickel
and zinc (Zn) from the soil 3 years after the remedy. In contrast, they implemented a
similar biochar to a lead (Pb)-contaminated kaolin (35% clay) (Shen et al. 2016) and
consequently the remedy conﬁrmed no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the lead mobility in
the soil. Likewise, Shen et al. (2018) implemented a wheat straw biochar to a clay
rich contaminated soil. Although the addition of biochar reduced the amount of
signiﬁcant metals (cadmium, copper (Cu), and lead) leached by TCLP, this
immobilisation deteriorated with increased ageing. As a result, the efﬁcacy of
biochar in immobilising metals in soils is highly dependent on soil type (Wang
et al. 2019a, b).
Heavy metals in soil and sediment have the dangers to be absorbed by ﬂora. A pot
research is usually used to conﬁrm the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil (Lai
et al. 2008). Additionally, the fate of heavy metals in soil determines their bioavail-
ability and environmental risks. At present, the common analytical ways for soil

heavy metal forms are the Tessier sequential extraction method and the Community
Bureau of Reference consecutive extraction technique. Tessier et al. (1979) devel-
oped an analytical process involving consecutive chemical extractions for the
partitioning of particulate trace metals (cadmium, cobalt (Co), copper, nickel, lead,
zinc, iron and manganese (Mn)) into ﬁve fractions: exchangeable, bound to
carbonates, bound to iron manganese oxides, bound to organic matter, and residual.
The iron manganese oxide bound and also the organic matter bound fractions are
usually non-bioavailable. The residual fraction is available inside the crystal lattice
of primary or secondary minerals and thus is the maximum stable fraction with very
cheap bioavailability. The fate and fractions of heavy metals represent absolutely
speciﬁc bioavailabilities and effect at the surroundings (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
The combination remediation of biochar and other materials will minimize the
bioavailability of heavy metals in soil. Gao (2013) compared the effects of biochar,
lime, and biochar and lime-mixed curing agents on pH and cadmium in cadmium-
contaminated meadow soil. The experimental results show that the pH of the soil is
signiﬁcantly increased when applying the aforementioned curing agents, and there-
fore the content of exchangeable cadmium in the soil is decreased to a few extent; the
reduction is in the order of biochar and lime mixed > lime > biochar. The
concentration of various kinds of cadmium also rose, resulting in a decrease in
cadmium bioavailability. At the same time, regression analysis revealed that there is
a strong negative connection between soil exchangeable cadmium concentration and
pH value. Beesley and Marmiroli (2011) studied the effect of fruit tree biochar and
compost on the restoration of naturally infected ore. A pot experiment was
conducted to measure the dissolved concentration of heavy metals in pore water
and soil extract. Heavy metal migration is inﬂuenced by the dissolved organic
carbon concentration in compost. Heavy metal bioavailability will be reduced
signiﬁcantly with combined repair. Biochar can reduce the bioavailability of heavy
metals, reduce the absorption of heavy metals by ﬂora, and therefore greatly lower
the toxicity of heavy metals (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
The density and pore shape of biochar affect the mechanical properties of treated
soil. Zhang et al. (2014) studied the effects of three varieties of biochar on the
mechanical properties of red soil and carried out experiments on unconﬁned com-
pressive strength (UCS) and shear strength of soil. The results show that the
application of biochar signiﬁcantly reduces the UCS and shear strength of the soil
and a rise in the quantity of biochar implemented results in a rise in compressive
strength, but has no signiﬁcant result on the inner friction angle. As a result of the
application of biochar, the soil’s macrospores will increase, and the connection
between the soil particles will alter, reducing the soil’s compressive strength. The
ﬁndings of the pot experiment reveal a decrease in tensile strength with higher rates
of biochar application (Chan et al. 2007; O’Kelly and Som 2014; Wang et al.
2019a, b).
The decrease in soil strength by biochar might aid crop production in agriculture;
but, in the context of soil solidiﬁcation, a diminished soil strength was not expected.
There biochar is usually applied with speciﬁc alternative materials in solidiﬁcation/
stabilization to boost the mechanical properties of the soil. Haque et al. (2014)
246
H. K. Patel et al.

conducted laboratory UCS tests on biochar mixed clays (BMCs) treated with lime
and ground coarse blast furnace slag (GGBS), combined with scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was determined that a rise in
GGBS content led to a signiﬁcant increase in soil strength and an extended curing
time will aid the development of the compressive strength. The application of
biochar offset the development of soil strength at the initial stage of curing
(90 days), resulting in a decrease in compressive strength; however this end result
diminished in the long run (after 180 days of curing). SEM and XRD ﬁndings
revealed three distinct forms of microstructural interactions between biochar and
soil particles: interface cementation, surface deposition, and pore area space by
cementations minerals, all of which are responsible for the improvement of UCS
with curing. Reducing lime content by incorporating biochar and GGBS into soils
would create the soil combining a more environmental friendly and sustainable
technique. In practical projects, the determination of the remediation plan should
consider heavy metal type in soil, environmental conditions, curing age, and the
physical and chemical properties of biochar. Akhtar and Sarmah’s (2018) studied
biochar, a carbonaceous solid material produced from three different waste sources
(poultry litter, rice husk and pulp and paper mill sludge), was utilized to exchange
cement content up to a quarter of the whole volume and the result of individual
biochar mixed with cement on the mechanical properties of concrete was
investigated through absolutely speciﬁc characterization techniques (thermo gravi-
metric analysis, XRD, etc.). Biochar has the potential to improve the concrete
properties while substituting the cement in minor fractions in typical concrete
applications (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.5
Modification Methods of Biochar Remediation
The use of biochar as a way of remediating polluted soil and water has been
advocated. Standard biochar’s practical uses for pollutant immobilisation and
removal require further improvements in order to be successful in remedial needs.
To increase biochar’s remediation effectiveness, physical and chemical methods
such as activation, magnetization, oxidation, and digestion are commonly used
(Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.5.1 Steam Activation
Steam activation is an efﬁcient activation technique. During activation, the biochar
surface consists lots of advanced pore structure and a bigger pore volume. Hass et al.
(2012) investigated the impact of pyrolysis temperature and steam activation on the
properties of biochar. It was discovered that steam activation will increase the ssa
and pH scale of biochar. The steam activation of biochar made at 350 C includes a
comparable liming impact to soil with that made at 700 C (Wang et al. 2019a, b).

11.5.2 Magnetization
Magnetization is additionally a way for improving the sorption capability of biochar.
Magnetic biochar has strong ferromagnetic capacity and the exhausted/spent biochar
can be easily separated and picked up through magnetic separation. Chen et al.
(2011) studied three magnetic biochars made through chemical co-precipitation of
iron (III) (Fe3+)/iron (II) (Fe2+) on orange peel powder and discovered that
magnetized biochar includes a large pore diameter and a more potent ability to
remove organic contaminants and phosphate from water. Additionally, the g-iron
(III) oxide (g-Fe2O3) particles at the carbon surface served as sorption sites through
electrostatic interactions. Magnetized biochar is simply isolated and eliminated with
outside magnets; it is employed in numerous arsenic (As) contaminant elimination
applications (Wang et al. 2015).
11.5.3 Oxidation
Oxidation of biochar is accomplished through adding different oxidants such as
nitric acid (HNO3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4) (Li et al. 2014), and hydro-
gen peroxide (H2O2) (Xue et al. 2012) to enhance the adsorption capacities of
biochar. Studies have proven that the surface of biochar during oxidation treatment
contains a large number of acidic functional groups, and nitric acid is extra effective
than potassium permanganate (Li et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.5.4 Digestion
Digestion treatment can also enhance the adsorption capacity of biochar. The
adsorption capability of biochar made from biomass feedstocks like bagasse (Inyang
et al. 2010), beetroot (Yao et al. 2011), and dairy manure (Inyang et al. 2012) treated
through anaerobic digestion is far above that without digestion remedy and its
adsorption capability is comparable to that of commercially activated carbon. Inyang
et al. (2010) discovered that digestible bagasse biochar had higher pH, surface area,
CEC, and hydrophobicity and more of negative surface charge (Wang et al.
2019a, b).
At the ssa, functional groups, CEC, pH scale, and alternate physical chemical
characteristics of biochar, it can be observed that the varied have diverse outcomes.
These modiﬁcations are closely associated with the remediation of heavy metal
contaminated soil. The alkaline, porous structure and surface O2 functional groups
of biochar are the best indicators for comparing its remediation capability for heavy
metals (Wang et al. 2019a, b).

11.6
Remediation Mechanisms of Biochar
11.6.1 Heavy Metal Remediation Mechanisms
Biochar has a porous structure, comparatively high pH values, aromatic components,
and active surface functional groups. These properties play a crucial role in the
remediation mechanisms of heavy metals in soil, collectively with physical adsorp-
tion, ion exchange, electrostatic interaction, complication, and precipitation (Wang
et al. 2019a, b).
11.6.2 Physical Adsorption
Physical adsorption, also mentioned as van der Waals adsorption, arises from
interactions among the adsorbate and also the adsorbent molecules. As physical
adsorption is principally a result of the intermolecular force, the adsorption is mostly
reversible. The physical adsorption of heavy metals on biochar is mainly affected by
the speciﬁc surface area, surface energy, and pore quantity of biochar (Xie et al.
2011; Zhang et al. 2009). A rise in the pyrolysis temperature of biochar will increase
its speciﬁc surface area and pore quantity, which can signiﬁcantly increase the
contact area among biochar and heavy metallic ions and enhance the physical
sorption of biochar. For example, biochar produced from pine wood (700 C) and
switch grass (300 C) will correctly immobilize copper and uranium (U) by physical
adsorption (Liu et al. 2010). Beesley et al. (2014) conﬁrmed that heavy metallic ions
like arsenic, cadmium, and Zn are immobilized at the surface of biochar by physical
adsorption (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.6.3 Ion Exchange
Ion exchange is the selective exchange of exchangeable metal ions/ionizable protons
(e.g., sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+)) on the
biochar surface by heavy steel ions. The efﬁciency of ion exchange principally relies
on surface chemical properties of the biochar. High CEC of biochar will enhance the
ion exchange effect between biochar particles and metal cations (Wang et al.
2019a, b).
The biggest CEC of biochar has been found in pyrolysis temperatures of
250–300 C, because a higher pyrolysis temperature leads to a decrease in the
number of acidic oxygen functional groups and oxygen/carbon, which reduces the
CEC of biochar (Lee et al. 2010). El-Shafey (2010) investigated the remediation
mechanisms of zinc and mercury (Hg) by husk biochar created at 175–180 C. The
results conﬁrmed that acidic oxygen functional groups at the biochar surface like –
COOH and –OH will exchange with zinc (Zn2+) and mercury (II) (Hg+). The cation
exchange capability of biochar is closely associated with the pH of soil solution.
Once pH values of soil solution are below the pH of biochar at point of zero charge, a
11

lot of heavy metal ions are attracted to the biochar surface via the ion-exchange
method. Liu et al. (2010) determined that hydrothermal biochar has abundant
oxygen functional groups, whereas pyrolysis biochar have excessive speciﬁc surface
area that aid the adsorption of copper (II) ions (Cu2+) by ion exchange and physical
adsorption, respectively. Additionally, the adsorption capability of hydrothermal
biochar was larger than that of pyrolysis biochar, indicating that ion exchange is
more effective than physical adsorption (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.6.4 Electrostatic Interactions
A high negative charge of biochar will enhance the electrostatic interactions between
soil particles and metallic cations to immobilize heavy metals through electrostatic
attraction. The biochar metallic electrostatic interaction is principally dependent on
soil solution pH, the valence and ionic radius of the heavy metallic and the PZC of
biochar (Dong et al. 2011; Mukherjee et al. 2011). Applying biochar to soils will
increase the CEC and pH of soil and so increases electrostatic interactions between
heavy metallic ions and soil particles (Peng et al. 2011). According to Qiu et al.
(2008), wheat and rice straw biochar have a stronger rectiﬁcation effect than
electrostatic interactions between lead (II) ions (Pb2+) and electrostatic biochar.
Therefore, electricity interaction is a mechanism for biochar to immobilize heavy
metals in soil (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.6.5 Complexation
The surface of biomass carbon is rich in oxygen-containing functional groups like –
COOH, –COH, and –OH, which complex with heavy metallic ions to make stable
complexes (Park et al. 2011). Biochar, when produced in signiﬁcant quantities,
includes an unusually high amount of oxygen functional groups, which efﬁciently
immobilise heavy metals by metallic complexation. The number of oxygen func-
tional groups within biochar will increase over time, which can be caused by
oxidation of the biochar surface and carboxyl formation (Harvey et al. 2011).
Complexation will be generated between the undoubtedly charged metallic cation
and the C¼O ligand of the oxygen functional group, like surface complexation of
lead (II) ions with free carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups and inner-sphere
complexation of lead (II) ions with free hydroxyl functional groups of mineral
oxides (Cao et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2012). The oxygen functional groups of biochar
signiﬁcantly increase the ligands on the soil surface to immobilize more heavy
metals by forming ligand–heavy metallic complexes (Tong et al. 2014; Uchimiya
et al. 2011). Dong et al. (2011) looked into the mechanisms of Cr correction by sugar
beet tailing biochar. Complexation is the most important process for Cr cleanup,
according to the results (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
250
H. K. Patel et al.

11.6.6 Precipitation
Biochar will co-precipitate with metal cations to create insoluble phosphates and
carbonates, thereby immobilizing heavy metals in soil (Shen et al. 2016, 2018). The
high-temperature (>300 C) pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose in plant
biomass sometimes produces alkaline biochar to create metal precipitates in soil
(Cao and Harris 2010). Animal biochar generally has more ash content, like sodium,
potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur (S), and silicon (Si), which may
react with heavy metals to create insoluble minerals. For example, Cao et al. (2011)
observed that cow manure biochar contains a large quantity of phosphate, which
may immobilize lead in soil by forming insoluble pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3(OH)).
Additionally, research have proven that dairy-manure-derived biochar adsorbs lead
from aqueous solution via precipitation (84–87%) and surface sorption (13–16%)
(Cao et al. 2009). Xu et al. (2013) compared the effects and mechanisms of lead,
copper, zinc, and cadmium adsorption by rice husk biochar and cow manure biochar
and observed that main adsorption mechanism is the precipitation between phos-
phate or carbonate and metals. The results recommend that precipitation will
correctly immobilize heavy metals (Wang et al. 2019a, b).
11.7
Conclusion
Because of signiﬁcant segment pressure, at a time when the environment is changing
and human demands are projected to increase. Biochar treatment is a crucial step in
restoring soil fertility. If the pollution of the soil by toxic natural mixtures and heavy
metals worsens, the condition of the soil must be improved to minimize environ-
mental change, ensure food protection, power availability, and water accessibility for
future generations. Using suitable parent material and fair arrangement techniques
for biochar shift not only increases biochar properties, but also increases remediation
components such as real adsorption, particle trade, electrostatic partnerships, com-
plexity, and precipitation, all of which are useful in the remediation of soil polluted
with natural mixtures and heavy metals.

Introduction
Majority of the North Asian countries are equatorial with various weathers, i.e. rainy,
winter and summer seasons, which help to have an agricultural diversity. Two of the
major crops in India and neighbouring countries are rice and corn, whereas Southeast
Asian countries have a tropical climatic region that differs the cropping pattern. Crop
selectivity depends on the speciﬁc climatic region such as Malaysia has sugarcane as
a native perennial crop and oil palm as a commodity crop, and in the Philippines,
majority of the agricultural practices are pivoted around fruit farming like pineapple,
coconut, etc. A large amount of agricultural productivity revolves around rice, corn,
oil palm, sugarcane, coconut and pineapple farming in the Asian region. Figure 12.1
shows the production (million tonnes) of the selected crops in different Asian
countries.
Waste generated through all the agricultural activities contributes to the genera-
tion of biomass. Biomass is a lignocellulosic energy dense compound, which can be
used for energy recovery processes, and it is considered as a renewable resource of
energy. Different biomass has different physical and chemical properties due to its
diversiﬁed origin and species. Also, the same biomass at a different location,
geographical condition, age, climate and soil conditions would have different chem-
ical compositions (Kerkeni et al. 2016). Study shows that only 10% of these natural
ﬁbres from agricultural wastes are used as alternative raw materials for
biocomposites, automotive component, biomedical and other similar industries.
12.1.1 Biomass Waste Generation from Various Crops
Rice (Oryza sativa) is considered to be a robust crop that can grow in any soil. The
residues from this crop consist of rice husk and rice straw. In India, based on the
straw to grain ratio of 1.2, around 4.2 tonnes/ha rice straw is produced, and 200 kg of
rice husk is generated for every ton of paddy processed (Soam et al. 2017). These
residues are incorporated in the ﬁeld by open burning, used as animal fodder, or used
for the generation of electricity or biogas. Agricultural residues generated from corn
(Zea mays) include corn cob, corn straw and corn stover. The major end use of corn
residues is poultry farming, brewery industries and energy productions (owing to
high energy content) (Ficci 2014). The conversion process of oil palm fresh fruit
bunch in palm oil mills will produce crude palm oil (CPO) and oil palm biomass
such as oil palm trunks (OPT), palm oil sludge (POS), oil palm fronds (OPF), empty
fruit bunches (EFB) and palm pressed ﬁbres (PPF), palm kernel shells (PKS) and
palm oil mill efﬂuent palm (POME) (Hambali and Rivai 2017). In Indonesia, the oil
260
S. R. Narde et al.

palm biomass has been estimated at 418 million tonnes by palm oil mills by 2030
(Hambali and Rivai 2017). However, 85–110 million tonnes of biomass, dry solid
and liquid are expected to be generated by Malaysia’s oil palm industry by 2020
(Onoja et al. 2019). Sugarcane (Saccharum ofﬁcinarum L.) is a perennial grass
native to Southeast Asia’s tropical climates and now is grown in different countries
around the world (El Chami et al. 2020). It is an essential crop to produce sugar
(sucrose) and ethanol. It is transferred to the sugar processing mill to extract raw
juice after harvesting from the sugarcane farm. The major by-product generated after
processing is sugarcane bagasse. For example, 540 million metric tonnes of sugar-
cane bagasse is generated every year globally from the top ten sugarcane-producing
countries (Kumar et al. 2021). The common reuse method for the sugarcane bagasse
is to generate energy through burning (Aruna et al. 2021). Pineapple (Ananas
comosus (L.) Merr) is one of the most well-known tropical fruits in the world,

particularly in Asia. The residues of pineapple are reported to account for 50% of its
weight and generate ~10 tonnes/year quantity of fresh ﬁbre. Insoluble dietary ﬁbre is
the main ﬁbre fraction found in the residues of pineapple which is 56–65% of the
total dietary ﬁbre content. Pineapple residues which include leaf bracts, shell and
core are composed mainly of cellulose microﬁbrils containing hemicellulose and
lignin (Elena et al. 2014). Coconut (Cocos nucifera) has several main products
which include coconut oil, desiccated coconut, coconut water, coconut milk, coco-
nut sap sugar and reﬁned glycerin, not excluding coco coir, coco lumber and other
food and non-food products. Its shell is generally identiﬁed as one of the agricultural
wastes with the potential to serve as the base material to be utilized for the develop-
ment of activated carbon (Muzarpar et al. 2020).
12.2
Characteristics of Agricultural Wastes
12.2.1 Proximate, Ultimate Analysis and Biomass Composition
Agricultural waste (biomass) can be characterized using proximate, ultimate and
compositional analysis. Proximate analysis provides values of volatile matter (VM),
ash content (AC) and ﬁxed carbon content (FC); ultimate or elemental analysis
determines carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and sulphur
(S) elements present in the biomass; biomass composition analysis speciﬁes the
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content. Table 12.1 enlists the proximate, ulti-
mate and biomass composition analysis of various biomass.
VM of biomass is a signiﬁcant parameter affecting the biomass conversion
process, and it is the major source for gaseous and liquid yield from the thermo-
chemical process (Vassilev et al. 2010). Compounds having weak chemical bonds
get dissociated into simpler hydrocarbons like aliphatic hydrocarbons and phenols
and acids which evaporate due to heat and end up in condensable gases. Whereas
molecules dissociated extensively form CO2, H2, CO, CH4, etc., VM of the selected
biomass varied from 45.2 to 82.13% (Table 12.1). Inorganic compounds in biomass
like silica, oxides of calcium or magnesium or aluminium contribute to the
AC. These inorganic contents are not generally inﬂuenced by the heating process
but can alter the rate of the thermochemical conversion process. Higher AC was
observed in rice straw, rice husk, corn straw and oil palm sludge, whereas AC was
<10% in the other selected biomass (Table 12.1). The carbon content that remains in
the solid structure after the VM is driven off is referred to as FC. The FC content of
raw biomass varied from 7.7 to 39% (Table 12.1). AC and FC present in biomass
deﬁne char properties after the conversion process (Vassilev et al. 2010; Weber and
Quicker 2018).
Ultimate analysis is used for determining the element composition of carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur in percentages. Ultimate analysis helps in
analysing the biomass quality and to predict the biomass yield. Table 12.1 enlists the
ultimate analysis of the selected biomass. C, H, O, N and S varied in the range of
34.2–49.36%,
5–6.57%,
39–48.1%,
0.4–1.23
and
0.07–1.1%,
respectively
(Table 12.1).

Biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin which are
naturally occurring complex organic polymers along with trace amount of pectins,
starch, etc. Biomass composition is an inﬂuencing factor for thermochemical con-
version of biomass as it affects the heating rate and thus the quality of generated
biomass. The degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin occurs at different
temperatures. Lignin is considered to be the binding material of biomass which starts
degrading above the temperature of 200 C. Hemicellulose is thermally degraded
before cellulose at a temperature of 350 C, whereas cellulose is degraded at
comparatively higher temperatures (Huang et al. 2012). Higher cellulose to lignin
ratio ensures a higher heating rate of biomass and vice versa (Gani and Naruse 2007).
Generally, all the biomass samples constitute a higher percentage of cellulose and
hemicellulose and comparatively lower percentages of lignin. The composition of
biomass varies according to seasonal variation, region, climatic conditions, age of
crop, species, growth stage, etc. (Bajpai 2019). Cellulose and hemicellulose in all the
selected biomass were >20%, whereas the lignin content of 19% was observed in
corn stover (Table 12.1).
12.3
Methods for Biochar Production
For biochar production, different thermochemical conversion techniques are
adopted. The selected conversion technique and the operating parameters (amount
of oxygen, heating rate, reaction temperature, etc.) of the conversion technique
determine the yield and quality of biochar obtained from particular biomass. Gener-
ally, the yield of biochar decreases with a faster heating rate or more oxygen
available. Biochar production is achieved through various traditional and modern
approaches.
12.3.1 Traditional Approaches
The early approach of biomass conversion is the burning of biomass in a pit covered
by soil to prevent oxygen supply, burning of biomass in open space, covering half-
burned biomass immediately with soil, etc. The process is carried out in handmade
reactors such as ﬁrebrick pits, clay burners, brick kilns and iron retorts. Pyrolysis is
the common traditional approach used for biomass conversion to biochar. It is a
process by which biomass is subjected to thermal degradation under a limited/
minimal supply of oxygen yielding solid residue (biochar) along with liquid and
gaseous end products. Based on the heating rate, pyrolysis is classiﬁed as slow and
fast pyrolysis. In slow pyrolysis or conventional pyrolysis, biomass is heated to
300–600 C at a heating rate of 5–7 C/min for hours to yield biochar. Fast pyrolysis
is carried out at a temperature greater than 500 C with a heating rate of 300 C/min
for a shorter time (REILLY 1925; Thines et al. 2017). Fast pyrolysis yields more
liquid and gaseous products compared to biochar.

12.3.2 Modern Approaches
Modern approaches of biomass conversion include gasiﬁcation, torrefaction, ﬂash
pyrolysis, vacuum pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), microwave pyrol-
ysis, electro-modiﬁed biochar and magnetic biochar. Gasiﬁcation is carried out at a
high temperature, usually greater than 700 C, under a limited or controlled supply
of oxygen and steam. The main product is hydrogen, with a considerable amount of
biochar which can also be produced during the process (Al-Rahbi and Williams
2017; González et al. 2008). The torrefaction process improves the biomass
properties at relatively low temperatures such as 230–300 C and is carried out in
the absence of oxygen under atmospheric pressure (Pentananunt et al. 1990). Flash
pyrolysis is an improved process of fast pyrolysis wherein biomass is heated to
900–1200 C for around less than 1 min, employing a heating rate of 1000 C/
s (Demirbas and Arin 2002). Vacuum pyrolysis is conducted in the absence of
oxygen where biomass is subjected to thermal degradation under vacuum or low
pressure with the range of 0.05 and 0.20 MPa and at a temperature range of
450–600 C. In the HTC process, wet biomass is processed at a temperature range
of 220–240 C under high-pressure (2–10 MPa) reactor for several hours (Hu et al.
2010; Lynam et al. 2011; Titirici et al. 2007). The process eliminates pre-drying of
biomass to reduce moisture content. The end product is usually transformed into
brown coal or remains in its dissolved form. Microwave pyrolysis is an advanced
technique, where the biomass is heated by the dielectric heating of microwave
(Arafat Hossain et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2012; Menéndez et al. 2004). Electro-
modiﬁed biochar production employs modiﬁcation of biochar by chemical treatment
such as mixing it in Fe, Mg or Al for 2–12 h in the presence of electric current that
might change the functional groups on the surface of pores and eventually improves
speciﬁc adsorption (Jung et al. 2015; Zhang and Gao 2013). Production of magnetic
biochar intends the production of biochar with good magnetic property along with
other surface characteristics. For example, magnetic biochar can be prepared with
iron (Fe) ions on the surface of biochar through the help of a binding agent such as
chestnut shell at a temperature 450 C under microwave heating (Thines et al. 2017;
Zhou et al. 2017). The magnetic biochar exhibited tremendous adsorption capacity
of pollutants with complete separation and recovery of the biochar from aqueous
phase after the treatment process. The biochar produced in these methods is mainly
used as a soil amendment to improve soil property or adsorbent for the removal of
aqueous pollutants (Table 12.2).
12.4
Biochar Yield from Various Production Methods
Biochar yield from particular biomass varied based on the conversion techniques and
the operating parameters such as heating rate, the temperature of the reaction, inert
gas (N2/Ar/H2) purging, etc. Biochar yield decreased with an increase in temperature
and residence time in the thermochemical conversion process. Table 12.3 enlists the
biochar yield from various biomass at different operating conditions. MW pyrolysis

Conversion of Agricultural Wastes into Biochar and Its Characteristics

of rice husk yielded 62.9% biochar with MW power, temperature and residence time
of 800 W, 500 C and 10 min in a continuous reactor (Table 12.3). MW pyrolysis of
rice husk and rice straw resulted in comparable biochar yield under similar operating
conditions (Table 12.3).
Conversion of agricultural wastes to biochar offers several end uses of the
obtained biochar, along with agronomic beneﬁt of crop residue handling and man-
agement. Biochar is one of only a few technologies with good carbon sequestration
potential (Castilla-caballero et al. 2020; Dhar 2020). Besides, biochar produced from
different agricultural wastes is extensively used as an adsorbent for the removal of
pollutants such as heavy metals, nutrients and pharmaceutical compounds from
wastewater (Dhar 2020; Goh et al. 2019; Lo et al. 2017; Rajasekhar Reddy and
Vinu 2018; Ravikumar et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018). The incorporation of biochar
as soil amendment improved soil fertility, microbial activity and soil nutrient
retention capacity thus resulting in enhanced crop productivity (Castilla-caballero
et al. 2020; Dhar 2020; Lo et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018). Biochar is also used in
biocomposites and bioremediation process (Castilla-caballero et al. 2020; Dhar
2020). The comparable heating value of biochar with conventional fuels like coal
enables its use as a solid fuel (Castilla-caballero et al. 2020; Dhar 2020).
12.5
Biochar Characteristics
Biochar is majorly used as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment, soil amendment for
improved soil property and crop productivity, solid fuel to replace conventional coal,
etc. The end use of biochar depends on the characteristics of biochar obtained from
different biomass employing various conversion techniques. Table 12.4 enlists the
proximate and ultimate analysis characterizations of various biomass along with
surface area and heating value. The carbon content of various biochars varied from

28.3 to 90.15%. The carbon content of the biochar was highest (90.15%) in bagasse
biochar obtained through conventional pyrolysis process, whereas POS biochar
obtained through pyrolysis process resulted in the lowest carbon content
(Table 12.4). Proximate analysis of biochar shows FC and VM which majorly
deﬁnes the activity of biochar. For different biochars, obtained FC ranges from
2.86 to 71.03% and VM ranges from 9.3 to 69.82%. The highest FC is observed in
pineapple peel waste biochar obtained through conventional pyrolysis process, and
the lowest VM is obtained in POS biochar obtained through pyrolysis process
(Table 12.4).
For adsorption and nutrient retention in soil with biochar, it should have a
considerably high speciﬁc surface area (SSA). The SSA obtained by Brauner-
Emmett-Teller (BET) Technique after thermochemical conversion process majorly
showed an increase in value, compared to parent biomass. The highest SSA
obtained, considering the selected biomass, is 361.77 m2/g for sugarcane bagasse
biochar (Table 12.4).
Heating value is one of the important characteristics of biochar. If the heating
value of biochar is good enough to compete with conventional fuel, then the
obtained biochar can be considered as a good fuel alternative considering its
production cost. The average heating value obtained via pyrolysis lies in
20–30 MJ/kg. The maximum heating value obtained is 46.95 MJ/kg (Table 12.4).
This shows promising results of heating value comparable to conventional fuels like
coal which has a heating value around 22–25 MJ/kg.

Summary
With an increase in agricultural productivity, the generation of agricultural residues
and wastes is among rising problems all over the world. Rice, corn or maize, oil palm
tree, sugarcane, coconut and pineapple are the six major crops produced in Asian
countries. India and China are major producers of rice and corn; oil palm crops are
cultivated majorly in Malaysia and Indonesia; coconuts are mainly produced in
Singapore and other coastal Asian countries. The crop production and post-
processing techniques generate enormous quantity of residue as agricultural waste
(biomass) such as rice husk, rice straw, corn cob, corn straw and corn stover, crude
palm oil, oil palm biomass, sugarcane bagasse, pineapple leaf bracts, coconut
shell, etc.
Based on proximate analysis, volatile matter content of the selected biomass
varied from 45.2 to 82.13%. Higher ash content (AC) was observed in rice straw,
rice husk, corn straw and oil palm sludge, whereas AC was <10% in the other
selected biomass. The ﬁxed carbon (FC) content of raw biomass varied from 7.7 to
39%. The ultimate analysis of biomass indicated C, H, O, N and S of the biomass in
the range of 34.2–49.36%, 5–6.57%, 39–48.1%, 0.4–1.23 and 0.07–1.1%, respec-
tively. Traditional approaches of thermal conversion techniques like combustion,
pyrolysis, etc. and advanced approaches such as torrefaction, gasiﬁcation, micro-

production, etc. are employed for the conversion of biomass into biochar. The
characteristics of biomass, type of conversion process and operating conditions
affected the yield and property of the obtained biochar. Among the selected biomass,
the highest biochar yield of 92.1% was obtained from pyrolysis of POS and average
yield of biochar from various biomass was observed between 30 and 50%. Sugar-
cane bagasse biochar obtained through pyrolysis indicated the highest speciﬁc
surface area of 361.77 m2/g. The average heating value biochar is observed to be
20–30 MJ/kg.
Biochar produced from biomass posed good carbon sequestration potential.
Besides, biochar produced from different agricultural wastes is extensively used as
an adsorbent for the removal of pollutants such as heavy metals, nutrients and
pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater. The incorporation of biochar as soil
amendment improved soil fertility, microbial activity and soil nutrient retention
capacity thus resulting in enhanced crop productivity. Biochar is also used in
biocomposites and bioremediation process. The comparable heating value of biochar
with conventional fuels like coal enables its use as a solid fuel. Thermal conversion
processes of different feedstocks are efﬁcient value-adding techniques and getting
great attention from researches as well as industry experts, considering their lower
operation time and high scale-up potential. These technologies deﬁnitely will
become part of industrial activities in the near future.

Abstract
Biochar is a carbon-rich solid produced by heating biomass with little or no
oxygen. It can be produced from vegetable biomass or animal wastes from agro-
industrial processes, reducing the volume of residues to be disposed of and
adding value to these materials. Biochar presents a porous structure with a high
surface area containing many functional groups. These characteristics allow the
use of biochar in many applications, such as a remediation tool for degraded
agricultural soils. Intense use of the soil can cause a decrease in the nutrient
content and accumulation of pesticides, negatively affecting the soil ecosystem
and the crop yields. The application of biochar in degraded soil can change the
physicochemical properties of the soil, increase the nutrient availability by
reducing nutrient leaching, and promote the chemical and/or biological degrada-
tion of pesticide residues. Thus, this chapter aims to approach the main aspects of
biochar production and its application as a remediation tool in degraded soils,
including the increase in nutrient availability and the promotion of pesticides

Introduction
Healthy soils are essential to keep human life on Earth since they are directly
connected with the provision of food, wood, and raw materials, besides acting as a
gigantic ﬁlter, accumulating nutrients, regulating greenhouse gases concentrations,
decontaminating the water, and minimizing ﬂoods (Kopittke et al. 2019). However,
with the intense human population growth and the consequent increase in the
demand for consumer goods, soils and all the services they provide are being
subjected to huge pressure. The global human population was 6.5 billion in 2005,
7.7 in 2019, and is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations 2019).
Based on this, the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative estimated that food
production must increase by 70% between 2005 and 2050, which will directly
impact the use of the soil (ELD Initiative 2015).
Conventional agriculture already impacts soil properties and functions leading to
different processes of unsustainable soil degradation, such as erosion, desertiﬁcation,
loss of organic matter, contamination by overapplication of agrochemicals, acidiﬁ-
cation, salinization, and loss of biodiversity (Kopittke et al. 2019). With an increas-
ing demand for food and other commodities, the expansion of conventional
agriculture is expected, as well as the intensiﬁcation of soil degradation, reducing
the long-term capacity of soils to provide the complex net of services from which
humanity is dependent (Kopittke et al. 2019). To solve this paradox (increasing
demand $ intensive use of the soil $ decreasing soil productivity), the focus of the
decision-making processes must change from the immediate beneﬁts of intensive
agricultural systems to the long-term sustainability of the soil. For this, it is important
to understand that soil degradation directly leads to economic losses. It is estimated
that 52% of agricultural land is already moderately or severely degraded, which costs
the world US$400 billion per year due to lower productivity and increased food
prices (ELD Initiative 2015).
Intensive agriculture impacts on soil mainly include harmful effects on soil

to short-term and long-term productivity loss, income reduction, a drop in the price
of agricultural land, leading to farmers vulnerability, food insecurity, and migration
(Asfaw et al. 2020).
The availability of nutrients in the soil is negatively affected by erosion processes,
loss of soil microbiota and organic matter, and reduction of pH and porosity, which
282
J. Mulinari et al.

are all caused by non-sustainable agricultural practices (Zalidis et al. 2002). When
the quantities of nutrients removed from the soil by the harvest products and the
impacts caused by intensive agriculture surpass the quantities of nutrients being
applied, the soil fertility decreases, resulting in a reduction of plant growth and yield.
Thus, more fertilizer is needed to meet the demands of the crops. Therefore,
increasing the efﬁciency of the fertilizers is essential to reduce the farming costs,
decrease the exploration of nonrenewable resources for the production of fertilizers
(such as phosphorus reserves), and create more sustainable agriculture.
Another environmental problem caused by intensive agriculture is the accumula-
tion of pesticide residues in the soil due to the extensive and inefﬁcient use of these
agrochemicals (Liu et al. 2018). Despite decreasing soil quality, the pesticide
residues can run off to surface water bodies and leach to groundwater, contaminating
the aquatic ecosystems and compromising human health, since some pesticides are
known to be toxic, mutagens, carcinogens, immunosuppressants, etc. (Hassaan and
El Nemr 2020). Moreover, the intense degradation of agricultural soils can have
global impacts, such as the enhancement of climate change (due to increased
deforestation in the search for new fertile lands), water regime changes, and water
contamination. Thus, the sustainable use of soil resources, restoration of degraded
areas, management of land use, and conservation of soil quality is essential to
preserve the agricultural yields as well as the balance of the global ecosystem
(Zeraatpisheh et al. 2020).
Several strategies have been employed to increase agricultural soil sustainability,
and many more are being developed. The use of biochar, for example, has shown to
be a promising alternative to increase the nutrient retention in the soil by decreasing
nutrient loss through gaseous emissions or leaching and enhance pesticide degrada-
tion by modifying the physicochemical properties of the soil and improving soil
microbial abundance, activity, and associations (Ding et al. 2017). Biochar is a
carbon-rich porous solid produced by heating biomass in the absence of oxygen
(Ding et al. 2017). It presents several functional groups and can be made using
agricultural wastes such as corn cob (Mensah and Frimpong 2018), rice straw
(Si et al. 2018), grass and beet residues (Isakovski et al. 2020), pig manure (Zhang
et al. 2013), and many others. The use of biochar produced from agricultural waste to
enhance crop yield is an environmentally friendly technique since it turns residues
into useful agricultural additives, being a sustainable strategy for the management of
agro-residues. Moreover, it can promote a circular economy in the agriculture sector
since the application of biochar in the soil can be integrated into conventional
fertilization practice (Jindo et al. 2020).
Based on this, this chapter approaches the use of biochar in agriculture as an
alternative to increasing the sustainability of the agricultural system and as a tool for
the remediation of degraded soils. First, a general overview of the production
process of biochar and its main characteristics are addressed, and then its use to
promote nutrient availability in the soil and pesticide degradation is discussed.

13.2
Biochar Production
Biochar is a solid carbonaceous material produced from carbon-rich raw materials
(Yaashikaa et al. 2020; El-Naggar et al. 2019). The most common sources for
obtaining biochar are the solid biomass composing the different types of organic
waste (Kim et al. 2012). Some of the most used wastes for the production of biochar
are from crops, municipal organic waste, industrial organic waste, animal waste
(manure/feces), and waste from forest biomass (leaves, branches, wood, and roots)
(Yaashikaa et al. 2020). The use of organic residues for biochar generation is
justiﬁed because it is a highly economical way of obtaining it and, in general,
presents a high production yield (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Chi et al. 2021; Babu and
Chaurasia 2003). Moreover, the use of waste promotes the circular economy and
meets the search for sustainable social development, through the reduction of waste
through reuse and recycling (Yaashikaa et al. 2020). Besides biochar, other products
are obtained in the bioreﬁnery, such as syngas and bio-oil, which can be considered a
form of renewable energy and can be used in several steps of the biochar production
cycle, reducing the costs and the demand for fossil fuels. Figure 13.1 illustrates the
main steps of biochar production and application.
For the reasons mentioned above, the focus of this topic is on obtaining biochar
derived from biomass. In this context, the biochar production conditions are the main
determinants of the biomass yield (Babu and Chaurasia 2003). These parameters
include, basically, the type of biomass, synthesis temperature, synthesis time,
heating rate, and pressure (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Babu and Chaurasia 2003).
Among all parameters, the temperature is the one that most affects the biochar
characteristics; for example, it can make it hydrophobic or hydrophilic (Chi et al.
2021), more porous or less porous (Manyà 2012), etc. For biomass-derived biochar,
thermochemical methods of production are the most widely used. Among them, it is

284

worth mentioning the pyrolysis, carbonization, torrefaction, and gasiﬁcation
methods. Pyrolysis is the most commonly used method among all the others
(Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Manyà 2012; Chi et al. 2021).
The most appropriate thermochemical method must be chosen according to the
biomass type, as well as the process parameters, to guarantee the highest biochar
yield (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Babu and Chaurasia 2003). In general, the thermo-
chemical transformation processes start with the dehydration of biomass (close to
100 C), which loses weight by removing the high structural water content; subse-
quently, with the rise in temperature (from 220 C), the degradation of cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin begins. Finally, after the decomposition and burning of the
carbonaceous residues, a remaining material is obtained. This material of carbona-
ceous and thermally stable nature is called biochar (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Babu and
Chaurasia 2003). The main biochar production methods are described in the
sub-items below.
13.2.1 Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis is a thermal process in which materials (usually organic) are subjected to a
high temperature (250–750 C) under an oxygen-free or low-oxygen atmosphere
(Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Chi et al. 2021). This process promotes a physical and
chemical transformation of biomass, converting it into solid (biochar) (Kim et al.
2012), liquid (bio-oil) (Brindhadevi et al. 2021), and gaseous (syngas) (Zhou et al.
2021) products with high added value. Pyrolysis can be classiﬁed as slow or fast,
depending on the process conditions used, such as temperature, heating rate, resi-
dence time, and pressure (Manyà 2012). The process is carried out in reactors, such
as wagon reactor, paddle kiln, bubbling ﬂuidized bed, and agitated sand rotating
kilns, which are quite suitable for the production of biochar (Yaashikaa et al. 2020).
In a simpliﬁed way, pyrolysis occurs in basically three stages (Kim et al. 2012): ﬁrst,
with the gradual increase in temperature, the biomass is dehydrated; subsequently,
primary char is formed, and as a result of the initial temperatures of thermal
degradation in this phase, part of the mass is converted into volatile compounds
(pyrolytic gases) (de Oliveira et al. 2021); the continuation of the process promotes
the slow degradation of primary char, which ultimately results in a secondary carbon
with high carbon content, that is, biochar (Kim et al. 2012).
During pyrolysis, the biomass cellulose undergoes depolymerization (Manyà
2012; de Oliveira et al. 2021). The cellulose fragmentation in chemical species of
lower molecular weight during the slow pyrolysis favors the char formation
(de Oliveira et al. 2021). However, under fast pyrolysis, cellulose undergoes rapid
degradation with the immediate release of volatiles, which leads to the formation of
levoglucosan (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2012). Levoglucosan also
undergoes
a
dehydration
process,
which

to
the
formation
of
hydroxymethylfurfural. The latter can decompose and originate liquid (bio-oil) and
gaseous (syngas) products, as well as undergo aromatization, condensation, and
polymerization reactions, forming biochar (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Zhang et al.
13
Biochar as a Tool for the Remediation of Agricultural Soils

2012). Hemicellulose decomposes similarly to cellulose to form oligosaccharides.
Depending on the pyrolysis temperature, hemicellulose may undergo different
reactions that lead to the formation of biochar or even decomposition in bio-oil
and syngas (Huang et al. 2012). The lignin present in the biomass undergoes
molecular breaks in the β-O-4 bonds caused by hydrolysis and dealkylation
reactions, resulting in the formation of free radicals and phenolic products. At the
end of the reactions, biochar is obtained by repolymerizing/cross-linking intermedi-
ate compounds (Jain et al. 2016).
Pyrolysis can be performed under different temperatures, generally ranging from
100 to 800 C (Hassan et al. 2020). At higher temperatures (500–800 C), the
biochar yield tends to be lower. However, the material has a higher ﬁxed carbon
content, greater surface area, and increased microporosity (Ding et al. 2017; Manyà
2012). Huang et al. (2020) produced biochar from sewage sludge using different
pyrolysis temperatures, and the biochar surface area increased from 7.26 to
81.26 m2/g when the temperature changed from 300 to 700 C. This increase can
be due to the release of biochar volatiles as the pyrolysis temperature rises (Liu et al.
2014a). Besides temperature, the biochar characteristics also depend on the raw
material used. Hassan et al. (2020) analyzed 533 publications and concluded that,
generally, biochar from hardwood and softwood has greater surface area than
biochar derived from manure and grass, for example.
Another feature inﬂuenced by the pyrolysis temperature used in the process is the
biochar pH. Biochar produced at higher temperatures presents higher pH due to the
release of alkali salts from the organic raw material used. Domingues et al. (2017)
demonstrated that biochar produced from different feedstocks (chicken manure,
eucalyptus sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, and pine bark) showed a signiﬁcant increase
in pH as a consequence of increased pyrolysis temperature. For example, the pH of
eucalyptus sawdust biochar increased from 5.9 to 9.7 when the temperature changed
from 350 to 750 C (Domingues et al. 2017).
The biochar obtained from pyrolysis under lower or moderate temperatures
(100–500 C) may have a more hydrophilic characteristic; the opposite is true for
high-temperature pyrolysis processes, in which the produced biochar is thermally
more stable and hydrophobic (Chi et al. 2021). In processes where the temperature is
higher, the biomass undergoes more chemical transformations and rearrangements,
as aromatization, giving rise to new functional surface groups, such as carboxyl,
pyridine, phenol, lactone, etc. (Manyà 2012). However, polar functional groups
(such as -OH and C-O) are removed when a high pyrolysis temperature is used,
turning the biochar surface more hydrophobic, which can hinder water retention
within the biochar particle (Ding et al. 2017). The reduction in the concentration of O
and H results in lower surface reactivity and, therefore, higher biochar stability. The
stability is also dependent on the feedstock used in the process. As demonstrated by
Cross and Sohi (2013), biomasses containing more recalcitrant carbon lead to more
stable biochar: for example, wood-derived biochar showed higher stability in com-
parison to biochar produced from sugarcane bagasse, which in turn was more stable
than chicken manure biochar. The production of biochar with great stability is
286
J. Mulinari et al.

important to maintain the potential positive effects of biochar application in the soil
over longer periods.
Another characteristic inﬂuenced by the pyrolysis temperature is the cation
exchange capacity (CEC) of the biochar. The CEC is an important feature since it
indicates the biochar capacity to adsorb cations such as ammonium and calcium
ions, which are vital nutrients for the crops, reducing nutrient losses from the soil
(Hodges 2010; Ding et al. 2017). Some studies indicate that biochar produced at
higher pyrolysis temperatures has lower CEC. This was demonstrated by
Domingues et al. (2017) using biochar derived from chicken manure: when pyrolysis
temperature of 350 and 450 C was used, biochar had a CEC of ~40 cmolc/kg;
however, when the biochar was produced at 750 C, its CEC reduced to ~20 cmolc/
kg. The decrease of CEC value when high pyrolysis temperature is applied has been
attributed to the biochar aromatization and the loss of negative functional groups,
mainly oxygen-containing groups (Ding et al. 2017; Domingues et al. 2017).
As can be noticed in the discussions above, several biochar characteristics are
inﬂuenced by the temperature used during the pyrolysis process. Table 13.1
summarizes the effects of low and high temperature on the main characteristics of
biochar that must be considered when choosing the process parameters. These
characteristics dictate whether or not the produced biochar will be suitable as a
remediation tool in the target soil.
13.2.1.1 Fast Pyrolysis
Fast pyrolysis is considered a direct thermochemical treatment, capable of liquefying
solid biomass to obtain bio-oil, mainly used for energy generation (Yaashikaa et al.
2020; Chi et al. 2021; Manyà 2012). Although its application is more suitable for
obtaining bio-oil, some studies have shown good biochar yields derived from
biomass from fast pyrolysis. This process is characterized by the high heating rate
of the biomass (above 100 C/min) and very short synthesis time (exposure of the
biomass to heat between 0.5 and 2 s) under high temperatures (about 400–600 C)
(Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Chi et al. 2021; Manyà 2012). Due to the processing speed,
the biochar obtained by fast pyrolysis tends to have lower surface areas and
porosities concerning the biochar obtained from slow pyrolysis (Manyà 2012).
Some studies have shown that the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals during

the pyrolysis, such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium salts or hydroxides, can
catalyze the reaction by increasing the yield of pyrolysis products, in this case,
bio-oil and biochar (Manyà 2012).
13.2.1.2 Slow Pyrolysis
Slow pyrolysis has a better char yield when compared to fast pyrolysis and carboni-
zation methods. This process is characterized by the low heating rate of the biomass
(from 5 to 7 C/min) and synthesis times of hours and even days depending on the
objective (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Chi et al. 2021; Manyà 2012). The slow heating
and the long residence time of the biomass favor the formation of char, much more
than of bio-oil and syngas. For this reason, slow pyrolysis is the process most
commonly employed in the production of biochar. Studies have shown that pro-
cesses under high pressure (1.0–3.0 MPa) tend to increase the yield of biochar.
However, some research reports that, with the increase in pressure, a decrease in the
biochar surface area can be observed (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Chi et al. 2021; Manyà
2012). Moreover, the moisture content present in the biomass can inﬂuence the
biochar yield; some studies showed that high moisture content (42–62%) can
increase the production yield (Manyà 2012).
13.2.2 Carbonization
Carbonization is a thermochemical process in which incomplete combustion of solid
organic-based materials occurs when they are exposed to extreme temperatures.
During the carbonization reaction, heat removes hydrogen and oxygen from the
solid; so the residual matter is composed mostly of carbon, which we call char. In
this case, the residual biomass processing by the carbonization gives rise to biochar
(Chi et al. 2021). Carbonization can be performed using the conventional hydrother-
mal process or by a method known as ﬂash carbonization, which is described in the
next items.
13.2.2.1 Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC)
Classic hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is also known as wet torrefaction, and it
is a biochar production method that occurs at pressures of around 10–15 bar and
lower temperatures (150–300 C) compared to the pyrolysis process. This process
was developed by Friedrich Bergius in 1913 in Germany and aims to use wet
biomass (mixed with water) or with a high moisture content (food residues, algae,
animal waste, etc.) (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Libra et al. 2011). During the process, the
biomass is usually mixed with water in a closed reactor. The temperature is increased
slowly to ensure the process stability, which lasts, on average, from 30 min to 16 h.
The HTC process can also be used to obtain different products depending on the
temperature used. Up to 250 C hydrothermal carbonization takes place, through
which wet char, called hydrochar (paste composed of a carbonized solid phase and a
liquid phase), or dry char, i.e., biochar can be obtained (Zhang et al. 2017). Between
250 and 400 C, hydrothermal liquefaction occurs and bio-oil is produced. Above
288
J. Mulinari et al.

400 C hydrothermal gasiﬁcation takes place, and syngas (CO, CO2, H2, and CH4) is
formed (Yaashikaa et al. 2020). In this process, the reactions of biomass decompo-
sition and char formation occur mainly by hydrolysis, decarboxylation, aromatiza-
tion, and reconditioning (Libra et al. 2011).
13.2.2.2 Flash Carbonization (Flash)
The ﬂash carbonization process (Flash) was developed at the University of Hawaii
by professor Michael J. Antal, and its main characteristics are described in the US
Patent No. 6,790,317 B2 (Antal Jr 2004). The Flash production method is a process
of converting biomass to char that has shown higher efﬁciencies than slow pyrolysis
and hydrothermal carbonization. This process consists of a compacted bed of
biomass inside an air-pressurized vessel (1.0–2.0 MPa) (Manyà 2012). A heated
air (300–600 C) is forced through the biomass, which is converted into char. The
processing time is usually less than 30 min. The bed temperature proﬁle is inﬂuenced
by several factors, including the type of raw material, the heating time, and the
amount of heated air supplied (Manyà 2012).
13.2.3 Torrefaction
Torrefaction is an emerging thermochemical process and occurs in milder conditions
than traditional pyrolysis (Yu et al. 2017). This process uses much lower heating
rates (less than 50 C/min), residence time (less than 1.0 h), and temperatures
(150–300 C); for this reason, it is also called mild pyrolysis (Yaashikaa et al.
2020; Yu et al. 2017). Torrefaction can be performed in a closed reactor which
atmosphere is inertized by the removal of all internal air and oxygen through the
injection of N2 (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2017). The process phases can
include drying, torrefaction, and cooling. Through torrefaction, it is possible to
produce biochar of high caloriﬁc value capable of being used as an alternative raw
material in the production of clean energy (Yu et al. 2017). The torrefaction can be
carried out as (1) wet torrefaction, also called hydrothermal carbonization (explained
above), which is usually carried out in the presence of water at a temperature
between 180 and 260 C for about 5–240 min depending on the type of raw material
and objective; (2) steam torrefaction, in which the biomass is treated under steam for
about 10 min at a temperature not exceeding 260 C; and (3) oxidative torrefaction,
carried out under classical process conditions but in an atmosphere containing
oxidizing gases (air, oxygen, etc.) (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2017).
13.2.4 Gasification
Gasiﬁcation is a thermal method of decomposing carbonaceous material (biomass,
charcoal, or a mixture of both) into gaseous (non-condensable) products called
syngas, which is basically composed of CO, CO2, H2, CH4, and traces of low-
molecular-weight hydrocarbons (Yaashikaa et al. 2020). The process is normally
13
Biochar as a Tool for the Remediation of Agricultural Soils
289

operated at high temperatures (above 800 C). In the same way, the temperature is
the most important parameter in the gasiﬁcation process, capable of determining the
yield of syngas production and composition (Manyà 2012). Some studies have
shown that, at higher temperatures, the production of CO and H2 is favored, with a
reduction in the fraction of the other chemical species (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Manyà
2012). In this process, syngas is the main product formed, with biochar being the
secondary product of the reaction, presenting, then, lower yields (5–10%) (Brewer
et al. 2009). The biochar obtained from gasiﬁcation can contain high levels of metals
and minerals, depending on the ash content and the composition of the raw material
used. This characteristic is not desirable for applications of the material in soil due to
the toxicity and bioaccumulation of metals and the high content of minerals (Manyà
2012).
The classic gasiﬁcation process comprises of the stages of drying, pyrolysis,
oxidation/combustion, and gasiﬁcation (Yaashikaa et al. 2020). Drying takes place
between 100 and 150 C and is carried out separately when the raw material has high
humidity; in this stage, the substrate dehydration occurs. With the gradual increase in
temperature, the biomass undergoes a pyrolysis process between 200 and 500 C; in
this stage, thermal decomposition, char formation, and release of pyrolytic gases take
place (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Manyà 2012; Zhang et al. 2010). The rise in tempera-
ture leads to the oxidation/combustion of char and generated gases, which happens
between 800 and 1200 C. In this stage, gasiﬁcation occurs, where oxidation agents
(air, steam, among others) react with the combustible gases present in the gasiﬁer
(reactor system) to produce CO2, CO, and water (Yaashikaa et al. 2020; Manyà
2012; Zhang et al. 2010).
The partial gasiﬁcation process (controlled with air, steam, or CO2 as an oxidizing
agent) can be used to improve the textural properties of biochar previously obtained
by other processes (Manyà 2012). In this case, gasiﬁcation is not used for produc-
tion, but for the physical activation of char, which can be applied in adsorption and
catalysis processes (Zhang et al. 2004). The obtaining of activated char by gasiﬁca-
tion is carried out with a burning percentage between 30 and 50% and constant
temperature between 700 and 850 C (Zhang et al. 2004).
Each production technique produces biochar with different characteristics, such
as porosity, hydrophilicity, surface functional groups, among others. These
characteristics inﬂuence the biochar performance as a soil remediation tool. The
next sections discuss the use of biochar to increase nutrient availability in the soil
and increase pesticide degradation, showing how the process parameters can help in
obtaining biochar capable of remediating the soil based on the needs of the land to be
treated.

13.3
Increasing Nutrient Availability Through the Use
of Biochar
During development, plants need at least 16 elements to complete their life cycle. A
few are made available by air and rainwater (carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen), while
the rest of the elements are absorbed by the plants through the roots, being acquired
exclusively through the soil. The elements consumed in greater quantities are
nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), being called macronutrients. In
addition to these, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S) are also essential.
Micronutrients are needed in smaller quantities, but equally crucial for the normal
development of plants, such as boron, copper, chlorine, iron, manganese, molybde-
num, and zinc (Hodges 2010).
During soil formation, the base material for each soil type undergoes many
physical and chemical changes. There is a reduction of soil particles and dissolution
of minerals, forming new clay minerals. These tiny particles are called colloids and
due to their large surface area in relation to the volume, they are extremely reactive.
They are of organic or mineral origin and are responsible for basically all the charge
and chemical reactivity of the soils, having an essential role in the availability of
nutrients. The extent and type of charges on soil colloids determine their ability to
retain essential nutrients for plants, preventing the leaching of nutrients with water.
This ability to retain cations increases with the increase of negative charges on the
soil, acting as a magnet, being able to make these cations available when another
cation takes its place. The nutrients attached to the soil in this way are called
“exchangeable cations.” Thus, the negative charge of the soil is called cation
exchange capacity (CEC), and it is responsible for the availability of nutrients for
the soil solution, becoming accessible to plants (Hodges 2010). A summary of the
cation exchange process is shown in Fig. 13.2.
Other factors such as pH and soil type affect CEC and, therefore, soil fertility. The
application of biochar has the potential to modify the chemical and physical
properties of the soil (Guo 2020). The acidic pH in the soil is detrimental to the
growth of plants because it makes available normally toxic metals like aluminum
(Al). The potential of biochar to increase the pH of the soil is related to its alkalinity
and retention of cations. Mensah and Frimpong (2018) found that the application of
biochar in acidic soils (pH 4.7 and 5.0) resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in pH (5.8
and 6.1, respectively). This increase may be related to the high pH of the biochar
used (7.0). Thus, biochar can be used as an alternative to limestone to correct
soil pH.
The increase in soil pH facilitates the release of nutrients into the soil solution,
allowing them to be absorbed by the plants’ roots. Studies have shown that the
addition of biochar can increase soil CEC. Jien and Wang (2013) observed an
increase from 7.41 to 10.8 cmol/kg in the CEC of the soil after the application of
biochar. Laird et al. (2010) observed an increase of up to 30% in relation to the
control after the application of biochar, demonstrating an improvement in nutrient
retention and general soil fertility. The improvement in soil CEC after the application
13

of the biochar may be related to its high speciﬁc surface area and the number of
biochar carboxylic groups (Ding et al. 2016).
In addition to the inﬂuence on pH and CEC, the biochar has other positive effects
on soil, improving the structure and capacity of water retention, besides reducing the
loss of nutrients through volatilization or leaching (Van Zwieten et al. 2010). When
applying biochar from paper mills to two different soil types (ferrosol and
calcarosol) in greenhouse experiments, Van Zwieten et al. (2010) found that the
application of biochar was beneﬁcial for the agronomic performance of the studied
crops (radish, wheat, and soybean). At the rate of 10 t/ha application, the biochar
signiﬁcantly increased the pH, CEC, and calcium (Ca) exchangeable in ferrosol,
while in calcarosol, it also increased exchangeable potassium (K). These effects on
the soil increased crop productivity. Other examples of studies that observed an
increase in crop productivity and biomass after biochar application are presented in
Table 13.2.
Ding et al. (2016) indicate four ways in which the biochar can improve soil
fertility: (1) Biochar can be used as a source of nutrients. The nutrient content present
in the biochar depends on the temperature and the raw material used; lower
temperatures of pyrolysis release more N, while higher temperatures release
more P, K, and Ca. Thus, the biochar could be produced for speciﬁc situations
depending on the soil needs. (2) Biochar can improve the physical and chemical
characteristics of the soil, mainly due to its porosity, speciﬁc surface area, and water
retention capacity. Due to its ability to improve CEC, aggregation, and pH, it can
enhance soil fertility by increasing the content and availability of nutrients in the soil,
also preventing its leaching. However, long-term experiments must be carried out to
assess the performance of the biochar over time. (3) Biochar could store nutrients.

Due to its porosity and functional groups, surplus nutrients can be stored on the
surface of the biochar, being made available slowly over time. (4) Biochar can
improve the activity, structure, and abundance of the soil microbiota. This improve-
ment in soil microbiology may be due to increased availability of nutrients, shelter,
and improved living conditions. The increase in microbial activity makes it possible
to improve nutrient cycling, improving the general fertility of the soil.
Despite demonstrating the potential for plant production, negative effects on plant
development have also been reported in the literature. Aguilar-Chávez et al. (2012)
found that the application of oak biochar hindered the development of wheat plants,
with no increase in production being observed. Nzanza et al. (2012) observed that
the application of eucalyptus biochar resulted in a 13% decrease in the dry mass of
the tomato root, in addition to a reduction in the P content in the leaves. Thus, the
application of biochar can have adverse effects, which may be related to the type of

Biochar as a Tool for the Remediation of Agricultural Soils

biochar in a speciﬁc type of soil. Further studies on the effects of biochar on crops
should be performed, especially in the long term, since crops are the main interest of
the farmers (Shaaban et al. 2018).
Thus, the application of biochar in degraded soils could be a way to recover these
soils. Its capacity for water retention, increase soil pH and ECC, and improvement of
the soil structure makes it an interesting alternative for recovery processes. However,
the source material and the production method of the biochar must be carefully
selected to produce speciﬁc biochar considering the type and necessities of the soil to
be remediated and the crops intended to be planted.
13.4
Biochar Role in the Promotion of Pesticide Degradation
Over the years, the overuse of pesticides in agricultural ﬁelds has caused harmful
effects on the environment, especially on soils. Despite the capacity for self-
puriﬁcation of the soil, it is now perceived that the accumulation of these toxic
agents is above the limit of natural and spontaneous degradation of nature, requiring
efﬁcient and sustainable interventions/strategies to promote the remediation of the
deteriorated soils (Zhen et al. 2018). Besides, the application of low-cost alternatives
that allow large-scale use in crops should be considered when proposing procedures
(Sanchez-Hernandez et al. 2019). In this context, biochar is an effective option,
widely studied for this purpose and eco-friendly. The role of biochar in promoting
the degradation of pesticides is closely correlated with the properties of the material
itself, the soil to be treated, and the form (combined or not) in which it is applied in
the crop. Therefore, it is essential to have full knowledge about the biochar-soil-plant
interaction mechanisms when using it as an ally in the degradation of pesticides.
Also, biochar can act as a stimulator for microbial biodegradation of pesticides since
it can change the chemical composition and pH of the soil, providing energy, water,
and structure suitable for microorganisms (Ren et al. 2018).
The process of degradation of pesticides in the soil can happen through different
mechanisms, such as hydrolysis, photolysis, oxidation, biodegradation, among
others (Liu et al. 2018). Table 13.3 shows some works reported in the literature,
highlighting the feedstocks used for the production of biochar and the degradation
mechanisms of different pesticides. The degradation of most products of this class of
agrochemicals occurs due to the action of microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria,
and others. However, the excessive application of pesticides in the crop can cause
adverse effects to the soil’s natural microbiota, such as the increase and/or reduction
of the presence of microorganisms through the availability of nutrients (carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and others). These disturbances in the soil microbiota
can cause the accumulation of pesticides in the area, which consequently deteriorates
the soil even more, besides contaminating rivers and aquifers by leaching. Further-
more, the degradation of different pesticides in the soil only happens under speciﬁc/
appropriate conditions, such as, for example, in the presence of little or no oxygen
and at a certain pH (Varjani et al. 2019). Therefore, the use of biochar in conjunction
with microorganisms or some chemical process can provide excellent results in the
294
J. Mulinari et al.

(bio)degradation of pesticides in the soil. For instance, the biochar can act as a
support for microorganisms or in changing the pH of the soil to provide an increase
in the biodegradation activity. Also, biochar application in the soil can increase the
amount of organic matter and water available, reducing competition between
microorganisms for supplies. Another phenomenon involved in promoting the
process of degradation of pesticides when using biochar is adsorption, and its
study (biochar-pesticide interaction) must be carried out previously so that it does
not cause problems in the application phase, as the biochar can adsorb the agro-
chemical, interfering in the chemical/biological process of breaking the agrochemi-
cal and/or combating the respective pests (Vijayaraghavan 2019).
Nowadays, most of the developed pesticides are easily degraded, mainly by
hydrolysis. Thus, the biochar can assist in the chemical degradation of these
compounds, due to the synergy between the materials, ions present in the soil, and
the pH. However, the degradation of pesticides by microorganisms is still dominant
in the environment. Biochars produced from Miscanthus  giganteus biomass and
pieces of beet were used to investigate its potential as a remediation technique to
prevent the leaching of organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-
methyl, and chlorfenvinphos) into groundwater (Isakovski et al. 2020). The process
of synthesis of the materials was through slow pyrolysis at a temperature of 400 C,
chosen based on the chemical composition of the raw materials used (cellulose and
hemicellulose). In the study, they used alluvial sediment from the banks of the
Danube River to test pesticide biodegradation and found, from the isolation of
strains and phylogenetic analysis, that Bacillus megaterium was the microorganism
responsible for the breakdown of the compounds. From the results obtained from the
biodegradation tests with the presence of biochar, they observed that there was an
increase in the delay of up to 18 times the pesticides leaching to groundwater. Also,

they listed the main positive points of the aid of biochar in the biodegradation of
agrochemicals present in the sediment, since it can act as support for bacteria due to
its microstructural properties, promoting the multiplication of the microorganisms,
besides acting as an adsorbent for the pesticides. In general, the research
demonstrated the potential of biochar as a remediation tool to inhibit pollutant
leaching into groundwater and to act in synergy with microorganisms in the biodeg-
radation of organophosphate pesticides.
The inﬂuence of the biochar production variables and the composition of the
carbon precursor are reported in several studies that evaluated the role of carbona-
ceous material in the degradation of pesticides. Biochars synthesized from pyrolysis
of sewage sludge at different temperatures (300, 500, and 700 C) were used to
evaluate the degradation of carbendazim in clay soils from different locations in
China (Huang et al. 2020). The results showed that the degradation of the pesticide
occurred quickly in the presence of biochar produced at 700 C (BC 700) in
comparison to other temperatures. One reason may be related to the higher surface
area of the biochar (81.26 m2/g), since more adsorption sites are available for the
pesticide and/or nutrients to the microorganisms that degrade carbendazim. Also, the
sorption power of the biochar is intrinsically correlated with the surface functional
groups, which are strongly affected by the pyrolysis temperature. The BC
700 presented aromatic compounds and a higher degree of aromatization than
the biochars synthesized at milder temperatures, which may be one of the reasons
for the higher percentage of adsorption of the agrochemical. Also, the degradation of
the pesticide in the presence of BC 700 can be linked to the increase in soil pH and
the generation of free radicals, which can facilitate the chemical degradation of
carbendazim.
Another mechanism of degradation of agrochemicals in the soil is through
photolysis, commonly called photodegradation. Biochars synthesized from empty
bunches of palm oil and rice husks were applied to the degradation of imazapic,
Onduty®, and imazapyr herbicides in rice paddy soil (Yavari et al. 2019). The
biochars were used in herbicide biodegradation and photodegradation experiments.
Samples were collected and analyzed at intervals of 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 days
after the application of the chemical agents. The results demonstrated that the use of
biochar in the soil has great potential to inﬂuence the herbicides’ half-lives. In the
photodegradation experiments, a decrease in the rate of photolysis was observed
when the biochar was applied in the soil, demonstrating an increase in the half-life of
the agrochemicals. On the other hand, the biodegradation was improved with the
presence of biochar, mainly with the material coming from the rice husk biomass,
since the results demonstrated a reduction by half of the half-lives of the herbicides.
Another topic of great interest to the scientiﬁc community is to unravel the
mechanisms involved in the degradation of pesticides in the soil. As a result, more
research is focused on adsorption-desorption processes, bioaccumulation, transfor-
mation, among others. There are different alternatives to base/elucidate the studies
of the phenomena involved in the degradation process of agrochemicals. The use of
biochar, for example, can provide numerous advantages for the mechanistic study of
the degradation of pesticides since it is widely known that it can act as an adsorbent
296

of chemicals/metals in contact with the soil and also help in the chemical and/or
biological degradation of the pesticides.
Zhang et al. (2018) used corn straw and pig manure for biochar production to
systematically study the degradation mechanisms of thiacloprid (THI) in black soil,
such as sorption and chemical and/or biological degradation. The biochar was
synthesized via pyrolysis at different temperatures (300, 500, and 700 C) and was
tested in different proportions in the soil to analyze the degradation of the agrochem-
ical. The results proved that the presence of biochar in the black soil inﬂuenced the
degradation of thiacloprid, and the changes were associated with the physical-
chemical and biological interferences of the material. Also, other advantages
attributed to the biochar are that it improved the pH, the electrical conductivity,
bioavailability of phosphorus, the contents of organic matter and hydrogen in the
soil, and the availability of shelter (pores of the material) for the microorganisms.
The biochar produced at a temperature of 300 C (300-TC) was the one with the best
values regarding the increase in dissolved organic carbon and the biodegradation of
the pesticide. The excellent biodegradation performance in the presence of 300-TC
was attributed to the increase in the number of microorganisms and to the improve-
ment of the activity of nitrile hydratase (NHase). However, biochar manufactured at
500 and 700 C inhibited the pesticide biodegradation, due to the amount of
dissolved free thiacloprid and adverse effects on NHase. Regarding the sorption of
the pesticide, the increase in temperature in the biochar synthesis favored the
adsorption of the agrochemical. This trend can be explained by the increase in the
surface area of the material and the decrease in the hydrogen to carbon ratio.
Therefore, based on the results of this study, pyrolysis temperature in the synthesis
of biochar can affect the degradation mechanism of the pesticide: low temperatures
can improve biodegradation, whereas high temperatures favor adsorption. In the
chemical degradation of THI, the authors observed that, as the pH became more
alkaline with the correction of the soil with the biochar, the degradation of the
pesticide increased, which can also be inﬂuenced by the active groups of the biochar
surface and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.
The use of biochar from pig manure biomass has shown excellent results in the
degradation of carbaryl and atrazine (Zhang et al. 2013). Adsorption and catalytic
hydrolysis were the two phenomena studied. The materials synthesized at different
temperatures (350 and 700 C) were evaluated with and without the ash removal
process (deashing). The adsorption results of the pesticides were higher with the
biochar manufactured at 700 C after the deashing process since the presence of ash
in the biochar can interfere in the sorption of the compounds. Both pesticides were
hydrolyzed more rapidly in the presence of biochar. In the study of carbaryl
hydrolysis, it was observed that the degradation increased with the biochar
suspensions due to the catalytic effects of the alkaline pH, the release of metal
ions, and the high surface area. The hydrolysis of atrazine was potentiated mainly
due to the high pH and biochar surface. Carbaryl and atrazine were broken down by
71.8% and 27.9% in 12 h, respectively.
The generation of free radicals by biochar is another mechanism that has been
studied for the promotion of pesticide degradation in soils. However, little is known
13
Biochar as a Tool for the Remediation of Agricultural Soils
297

about the behavior of these free radicals in contact with agrochemicals. Yang et al.
(2016) investigated the degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) using biochar seeking to
systematically assess the role of persistent free radicals in the process. Biochar was
produced from ﬁve different biomasses (pine wood, corn stalks, peanut shells, rice,
and wheat straw) using a programmed temperature method (kept at 100 C for
30 min and then pyrolyzed for 4 h in 200, 350, 500, and 700 C, separately). Biochar
obtained at temperatures above 200 C, except 700 C, showed satisfactory results of
degradation of PNP, mainly from the system with biochar produced from biomass of
pine wood at 500 C (PI-500). In the sorption experiment using PI-500, they found
that after 7 days of reaction, the nitrate concentration (intermediate of the PNP break)
proportionally increased with higher concentrations of PNP but ﬁxed biochar
amount. However, nitrate concentration decreased when the biochar amount was
reduced, demonstrating that the nitrate was originated from PNP degradation. Also,
the nitrate concentration kept increasing with time, showing that the degradation of
PNP in the presence of biochar was accelerated. The authors used electron paramag-
netic resonance (EPR) to detect the presence of free radicals at the biochar surface.
Strong signs of free radicals were detected in the samples, and the signal intensity
showed an excellent correlation with the extent of the degradation of PNP. In the raw
material, no sign of free radicals was detected, while for the biochar produced at
200, 300, and 500 C, the signal increased signiﬁcantly and proportionally to the
temperature. On the other hand, the sign of free radicals at the biochar produced at
700 C was very low. According to the authors, elevated temperatures can cause the
collapse and reorganization of the organic structures, resulting in a signiﬁcant
decrease or even disappearance of free radicals. Therefore, the study concluded
that biochar produced at the right pyrolysis temperature can generate free radicals
and is capable of promoting the degradation of organic contaminants in the environ-
ment through these radicals.
In general, it is observed that biochar plays a fundamental role in promoting the
degradation of pesticides, and there are numerous advantages of its use in the
(bio)degradation of these compounds: (1) it can serve as a soil additive to provide
a habitat optimized for microorganisms, where nutrients, water, and shelter are
available; (2) biochar can cause an increase/decrease in soil pH depending on the
soil needs; (3) it can release free radicals capable of degrading the pesticides;
(4) increase organic matter in the soil; (5) enhance the retention of agrochemicals
due to the adsorption phenomenon; among others. Figure 13.3 summarizes the role
of biochar in pesticide degradation in the soil. In the discussion of this topic, positive
points of biochar were reported in the chemical and/or biological degradation of
pesticides. However, new research addressing the behavior of this material in the
ecosystem in the long-term and cytotoxicity studies is necessary, so that the use of
biochar today does not become an environmental problem in the future.

Conclusions and Future Trends
The recovering of degraded soils is an important task, and human beings must take
total responsibility for it in order to ensure food security for the present and future
generations. The search for remediation techniques using low-cost, renewable, and
highly available resources must be one of the priorities in this area. In this sense, the
use of biochar in agriculture as an alternative for the remediation of degraded soils
has great potential. The use of waste, both from agricultural and industrial activities,
for the production of biochar makes it economically viable and environmentally
friendly.
Due to its physicochemical characteristics, the application of biochar to the soil
shows numerous advantages, such as beneﬁcial changes in pH, increased cation
exchange capacity, improved soil structure and porosity, improved water retention
capacity, reduced nutrient losses due to leaching and volatilization, and favoring the
activity of microorganisms.
The biochar also shows great potential for promoting the degradation of pesticide
residues in the soil, mainly due to its ability to provide a favorable microenvironment
for the activity of the soil microbiota, which is the main responsible for the
Fig. 13.3 Main effects of biochar application in pesticide-contaminated soil: (1) water and
(2) organic matter retention; (3) soil nutrient retention and prevention of nutrient loss by leaching
or evaporation; (4) the biochar pores serve as shelters for microorganisms that are attracted to the
solid due to the high availability of nutrients, water, and organic matter; (5) pesticide molecules can
adsorb on the biochar, preventing the leaching of pesticides to water bodies; (6) the microorganisms
present in the biochar can act on the degradation of pesticide molecules; (7) the biochar can release
free radicals able to degrade the pesticides present on the soil; (8) biochar surface charges can
modify soil properties, such as pH

degradation of these compounds. Also, biochar can promote the degradation of
pesticides through changes in soil pH, free radical release, and adsorption.
However, further studies are needed regarding the use of biochar in soils. Despite
the good results obtained so far, studies on the performance of this compound and
possible consequences for long periods are necessary. In addition, experiments
involving the combination of different raw materials and production methods can
be interesting for applications in speciﬁc situations.

Abstract
Biochar (BC) is a low-cost sustainable adsorption material. Due to its broad
application prospects, it has attracted a lot of research attention recently. Having
several functional groups available on the surface, biochar treated by several
methods can be modiﬁed and used as a catalyst or catalyst support. Functional
groups attached to the surface of biochar can trigger active free radical species to
play an important role, thereby causing destruction of pollutants as catalysts and
removal of adsorbents by involving electron transfer or redox processes. Biochar-
based materials can be used to remove inorganic contaminants, such as heavy
metal, nitrate or phosphate. Biochar-based materials can also be used to repair
eutrophic water by releasing compounds containing N or P. This chapter reviews
more feasible and sustainable biochar-based materials, which effectively remove
environmental pollutants as catalysts or carriers, and discusses the use of biochar-
based materials as catalysts.

14.1
Introduction
The world is currently facing environmental and climatic crisis such as increase in
atmospheric CO2, global warming, contamination of water bodies and decline in soil
organic carbon and drought. Biochar could be considered as a promising material to
help mitigate global environmental changes as well as elimination of contaminants
from water bodies. Biochar is a complex carbon-rich material, whose properties vary
along with production conditions and feedstock used. Scientiﬁc studies have
recently demonstrated that application of biochar or biochar-based materials to
agricultural soil increases crop production and contributes to carbon sequestration,
hence reducing emission of greenhouse gases. Biochar obtained from pyrolysis of
biomass is widely used in soil management, as a precursor for biofuel production,
health and sanitation and water puriﬁcation. In recent years, biochar has drawn
attention as a potential source of bioremediation or removal of contaminants from
polluted water bodies, therefore, helping in reducing the clean water availability
crisis. Biochar usage has another advantage, i.e. invasive plant management, thereby
protecting environment by converting invasive plant biomass into biochar which is a
win-win situation. A wide range of feedstock forestry remains, wood, agricultural
waste, grasses, animal waste, municipal sludge, etc. is employed for the production
of sustainable and nonhazardous biochar. This is considered to be a potential
absorbent
for
highly
toxic
emerging
contaminants.
pH,

(VM) content and recalcitrance, total carbon content, cation exchange capacity,
mineral content and oxygen-containing surface functional groups contribute to the
adsorption, catalytic oxidation and reduction properties of biochar. These
characteristics are attributes of pyrolysis such as temperature, pyrolysis time, etc.
Other alternatives to pyrolysis are hydrothermal carbonization, torrefaction, fast
pyrolysis, and gasiﬁcation. This chapter deals with the physico-chemical properties
of biochar and mechanisms involved in eradication of emerging organic/inorganic
and heavy metal pollutants (Yang et al. 2016).
14.2
Biochar: A Promising Biomaterial
Biochar is a carbon-rich sustainable and inexpensive renewable material. It is a
product of thermal degradation (300–700 C) via the process of pyrolysis under an
oxygen-limited environment. Pyrolysis of biomass converts precursor into various
products, viz. solid (biochar, tar), gas (syngas) and liquid (bio-oil). Yield and quality
of biochar depend on diverse factors like feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, duration,
heating rate, pressure and oxygen-limiting environment. A wide range of feedstock
is used for production of biochar like rice straw, canola straw, soybean straw, apple
wood, pine sawdust, manure pellets, alfalfa, wheat straw, multiple sludges, digested
sludge, etc. Activated carbon is considered the most common and efﬁcient sorbent
for elimination of pollutants from aqueous solutions, but production procedure of
activated carbon demands additional activation processes besides high temperature.
On the other hand, biochar is a sustainable low-cost adsorbent. Additionally, its
306

production is cheaper with low energy requirements as compared to activated carbon
(Huang et al. 2020).
14.2.1 Properties
Carbon-rich biochar is a surface decorated with oxygen-containing functional
groups and aromatic groups. Its varying physicochemical properties depend on
feedstock and different parameters of pyrolysis technology. With an increase in
treatment temperature during pyrolysis, biochar production decreases. This induces
a favourable change in biochar structure. While the total carbon content, cation
exchange capacity and mineral content are attributes of the type of feedstock used,
the reported pH of most biochar is alkaline; though, frequently, biochar exhibiting
pH range of neutral to slightly acidic has also been reported. This can be seen in case
of biochar produced from pinewood or black locust wood. pH of biochar increases
with an increase in pyrolytic temperature due to release of alkaline salts from
feedstock. In other words, high pyrolysis temperature is associated with loss of
acidic surface functional groups (oxygen-containing moieties). Therefore, it
decreases cation exchange capacity (CEC) of biochar. As mentioned earlier, CEC
is property of feedstock used for biochar production. Crop straw biochar shows
greater CEC than biochar derived from manure. Various elements present in feed-
stock such as K, Na, Ca, Mg and P contribute to the formation of O-containing
surface functional groups that enhance the value of CEC of biochar. Biochar
obtained from poultry waste or animal manure exhibits higher ash content which
is associated with greater mineral content in biomass. Another important property of
biochar, the electrical conductivity (EC), is higher for manure-derived biochar than
agricultural waste and woody feedstock. EC is deﬁned as the capacity to conduct
electricity. Higher EC of biochar is attributed to a higher concentration of Na, K, Mg,
SO4 and PO4. EC does demonstrate hype with pyrolysis temperature but mainly
depends on the types of biomass used for biochar production (Tan et al. 2015).
Surface area is a key property of biochar, and it increases with an increase in
pyrolytic temperature as a result of escape of volatile substances (cellulose and
hemicelluloses) and promotes formation of pore or channel structure. Large speciﬁc
surface area, porous structure, enriched surface functional groups as well as mineral
components contribute to biochar’s adsorption property. Adsorption by biochar can
be successfully applied in pollutant removal from an aqueous solution (Chintala
et al. 2013).
14.2.2 Production Methods
Various thermochemical processes that can be employed for production of biochar
are slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), ﬂash carboni-
zation, torrefaction and gasiﬁcation. Conventional processes of pyrolysis are slow
pyrolysis system and fast pyrolysis system. Slow pyrolysis system involves slow rate
14

of heating (5–20 C min1) with residence time of more than an hour. Moisture
content of the feedstock greatly affects pyrolysis process, and studies indicated that
feedstock moisture content must be less than 10% to be pyrolyzed into biochar.
Feedstock used for biochar production is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and
lignin, where lignin is the most recalcitrant as compared to hemicellulose and
cellulose. Pyrolysis sequentially follows four main steps:
1. Partial hemicellulose decomposition
2. Complete hemicellulose to partial cellulose decomposition
3. Full cellulose and partial lignin decomposition
4. Complete decomposition with high degree of carbonization
Weight loss in biochar becomes gradual with further increase of temperature up to
70 C. When various feedstocks are slow pyrolyzed, product yield falls in the range
of 15–90%. Increased pyrolytic temperature changes elemental composition of
resulting biochar. It has been reported that the increase in pyrolytic temperature
enhances carbon content of biochar and reduces concentration of nitrogen, hydrogen
and oxygen. However, Kim et al. (2013) observed that nitrogen content of biochar
largely depends on the feedstock used during pyrolysis. This observation indicates a
decrease in H/C, O/C and N + O/C molar ratio with increasing pyrolysis temperature.
High O/C ratio indicates the presence of more hydrophilic surface, while low O/C
ratio indicates the presence of more aromatic groups (higher extent of carboniza-
tion). The higher the O/C ratio, the more are the functional groups (hydroxyl,
carboxyl, carbonyl) present on surface leading to higher CEC value. H/C ratio
represents degree of carbonization or loss of polar groups at higher temperature.
With an increase in temperature, O + N/C ratio reduces; this indicates a loss of polar
group. Therefore, this surface chemistry contributes to adsorption property of
biochar (Kim et al. 2013).
Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) involves conversion of biomass into biochar
at 180–300 C in water for 30 min to 16 h. HTC shows biochar yield of 36–72%.
Biochar production through HTC is gaining more attention, and HTC makes use of
wet feedstock. HTC promotes formation of biochar with irregular surface (higher
surface area) and abundant oxygen-containing groups along with higher CEC value
than biochar formed by slow pyrolysis. HTC provides few advantages over pyrolysis
such as the use of unconventional wet biomass (sewage sludge, city waste, animal
remains), which are readily biodegradable and have high carbon sequestration
potential. The presence of acidic functional group on surface of biochar such as
carboxyl, lactone, and phenol makes the HTC-derived biochar an adsorbent of
choice (Kalderis et al. 2014). Torrefaction is another slow heating process at
temperature range of 250–300 C resulting in release of CO2 and water accompanied
with formation of solid fuel. Gasiﬁcation process favours formation of gas at
temperature range of 700–800 C with elevated pressure in gasiﬁcation chamber.
It is a promising and renewable pathway for mass production of syngas (Table 14.1).

Biochar-Based Materials: Application in Contaminant/
Pollutant Removal
Properties of biochar that contribute in the eradication of contaminants (nutrients
from eutrophic bodies):
14.3.1 Surface Area
The critical parameter governing adsorption capacity of biochar (carbonaceous
material) is the speciﬁc surface area. Increase in surface area leads to higher
adsorption of adsorbate, as surface is directly associated with density of adsorption
sites. Observation from studies conducted by Zeng et al. (2016) using ammonium
and phosphates as adsorbates concludes that increase in pyrolysis temperature
(500–700 C) enhances the surface area which elevates adsorption capacity of
biochar multiple folds. In a similar study, Chintala et al. (2013) reported that biochar
treated with hydrochloric acid has tenfold greater surface area which signiﬁcantly
improves adsorption abilities for nitrates. As surface area of biochar is generally
negatively charged, it may not perform same level of adsorption for anionic
compounds (Wang et al. 2015; Yao et al. 2013; Zeng et al. 2016).
14.3.2 Ion Exchange
It is a well-known fact that negatively charged surface of biochar adsorbs cationic
compounds. It is known that biochar produced from slow pyrolysis (at low

temperature) exhibits higher value for cation exchange capacity (CEC), and this
leads to greater adsorption capacity for NH+4 in eutrophic water where NH+4 is
adsorbed on the anionic surface by replacing another cation that shows week
interaction with the same surface anion. Gai et al. (2014) made an observation that
CEC value is higher for low-temperature biochar than high-temperature biochar (fast
pyrolysis). Besides pyrolysis temperature, biochar CEC is a feature associated with
the type of feedstock used. Gai et al. (2014) in their experimental studies found out
that straw-derived biochar shows greater value for CEC which leads to efﬁcient
removal of NH+4 when compared to biochar derived from peanut shell or wheat
straw at all temperatures. Surface modiﬁcation with metals enhances CEC, promot-
ing greater adsorption for NH+4. For example, magnesium-modiﬁed Phragmites
australis biochar undergo ion exchange between NH+4 and Mg+2 (Gai et al. 2014).
14.3.3 Surface Functional Group
The surface of biochar made by higher pyrolysis temperatures is commonly
characterized by hydrophobicity, and lower temperature leads to generation of
negatively charged surface functional groups (oxygen-containing groups such as
hydroxyl group or carboxyl group). The absence of functional group carrying net
positive charge or the presence of net negative charge leads to minimum electrostatic
attraction or maximum electrostatic repulsion, respectively. The solution pH has a
key impact on protonation/deprotonation status of surface functional groups. This
inﬂuences the electrostatic interaction between oxygen functional group and ammo-
nium ion. Kizito et al. (2015) worked on wood- and rice husk-derived biochar
(at 600 C) at lower pH and observed poor removal efﬁciency of NH+4. This poor
interaction is attributed to protonation of functional groups (C¼O, COO) on
biochar surface (Yang et al. 2018).
14.3.4 Precipitation
Primary mechanism for removal of PO4
3 from polluted water is the formation of
magnesium and calcium phosphates (Cui et al. 2016; Yao et al. 2013). Jung et al.
(2015) in their study explained that the high PO4
3 adsorption capacity is a result of
high ratio of magnesium and calcium to phosphorus (Mg/P ¼ 3.46 and Ca/P ¼ 47.6,
respectively) on peanut shell-derived biochar (at 700 C). There are several modiﬁ-
cation strategies for improving adsorption capacity of biochar. This includes physi-
cal activation (gas, microwave), acid, alkaline and oxidant oxidation, compositing
(that involves mineral impregnation or loading with nanoparticles). This can be
successfully applied for removal of heavy metals such as Pb, Cd and Zn from
polluted water (Yang et al. 2019a, b; Wang and Wang 2019; Li et al. 2020) used
engineering method of ball milling which greatly enhanced adsorption capacity for
tetracycline and mercury ions. They synthesized Fe3O4/wheat straw biochar
composites which used multiple combined adsorption mechanisms during removal

process. It has been reported that that the magnetic biochar holds potential to
effectively adsorb inorganic anionic pollutants (phosphate and nitrate), organic
pollutants (organic dye and antibiotics), and radioactive matters, while Yi et al.
(2020) reported that the N-doped biochar can be used to eradicate organic pollutants
from contaminated water bodies or industrial untreated efﬂuents. A number of
adsorption mechanisms are involved during heavy metal removal via biochar such
as electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, physical adsorption, surface complexation
and precipitation (Li et al. 2020) (Fig. 14.1).
The oxygen-containing surface functional groups (such as carboxylate and
hydroxyl) are responsible for interactions during removal of heavy metals. For
instance, Lu et al. (2012) proposed that Pb adsorption on a sludge-derived biochar
includes metal exchange with K+ and Na+ due to electrostatic outer-sphere complex-
ation, surface complexation with free carboxyl functional groups and free hydroxyl
functional groups and inner-sphere complexation with free hydroxyl groups. Similar
mechanism is involved in adsorption of Hg (II) on biochar derived from soybean
stalk as well as in case of adsorption of Cd (II) on corn straw biochar (Sun et al.
2014). Removal mechanism also depends on biochar feedstock source and mineral
components such as CO2 and PO4
3. Xu et al. (2013) tried simultaneous removal of
Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd from aqueous solution using rice husk biochar and dairy manure
biochar. Here the mineral components serve as additional adsorption site, therefore,
enhancing further the adsorption capacity of biochar for heavy metals. Cao et al.
(2009) also observed removal of lead by dairy-manure-based biochar through
adsorption. Dairy manure is rich in PO4
3 and CO3
2 which leads to formation of
Pb-phosphate precipitate Pb9(PO4)6 and Pb-carbonate precipitate Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2.

Surface organic groups of biochar (hydroxyl and carboxyl) exhibit complexation
with aluminium. Surface adsorption and co-precipitation of aluminium with silicate
particles promote aluminium adsorption on biochar. According to the literature,
surface area and porous structure of biochar seem to have less effect on heavy
metal adsorption than oxygen-containing functional groups. Ding et al. (2014)
reported that for high Pb adsorption on low-temperature biochar (250–400 C)
oxygen functional group was responsible whereas, for Pb adsorption on high-
temperature (500–600 C) biochar was mainly due to intra-particle diffusion. Oil
palm biochar and rice husk biochar show adsorption for different heavy metals
where the former has higher adsorption capacity for heavy metals with lower surface
area compared to later. This indicates that the surface is not as important as the
presence of oxygen-containing functional groups (Samsuri et al. 2014).
For removal of organic pollutants from aqueous solution, adsorption mechanisms
can be successfully employed. These involve electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic
effect, hydrogen bonds, and pore-ﬁlling phenomena of biochar with organic
pollutants. Biochar surface is heterogeneous due to the presence of carbonized as
well as non-carbonized fraction both having different adsorption mechanisms.
Studies suggest that dominant adsorption mechanism is electrostatic attraction. Qiu
et al. (2009) demonstrated the mechanism of dye adsorption on a straw-based
biochar. They proposed that the mechanisms of dye adsorption involved π-π
interactions (electrostatic attraction/repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bonding)
between dye molecules and graphene layers of biochar.
Zhang et al. (2013a, b) pointed out that the adsorption capacity of pig manure-
derived biochar for insecticide carbaryl is attributed to hydrophobic effect, pore-
ﬁlling together with pi-pi electron donor-acceptor interactions. Another report
suggests that the degree of graphitization inﬂuences adsorption of sulphonamide
on different biochar. Here the main mechanism of adsorption is also contributed by
π-π electron donor-acceptor interaction. Pore ﬁlling is considered to be an important
mechanism for removal of organic compounds by biochar via adsorption. Adsorp-
tion capacity here is majorly associated with surface properties of biochar. Adsorp-
tion capacity is proportional to surface area of micropores (Han et al. 2013).
Therefore, pore volume and high surface area of carbonaceous material favour
adsorption of organic pollutants as a result of signiﬁcant pore-ﬁlling effect (Zhu
et al. 2014).

Mechanisms That Drive Removal/Degradation
of Contaminants
14.4.1 Catalysis
Recent scientiﬁc advances have made it possible to explore catalytic property of
biochar and biochar-based material and their application in removal/degradation of
contaminants.

used for removal of contaminant; still adsorption is considered to be a
non-destructive process, where toxic/refractory contaminant is transformed from
one form to another, which still persists in the environment. Therefore, biochar-
derived catalytic degradation technology has become a useful means for remediation
of polluted environment. Commonly used catalyst includes titanium dioxide (TiO2),
zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO2), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), and cadmium sul-
phide. Biochar acts as catalyst due to the presence of surface functional group and
external transition metal. Both possess ability to degrade contaminant. Biochar can
also be used as supporting material for photocatalysis. Biochar as support material
can enhance photodegradation ability of the catalyst. Biochar surface contains
environmental persistent free radical (EPFR) which reacts with oxygen to generate
(OH) or sulphate radical (SO4) catalysed by hydrogen peroxide or persulfate. These
radicals are reported to degrade organic contaminant orange II, 2-chlorobiphenyl,
and sulfamethoxazole.
Parameters that inﬂuence biochar’s catalytic activity include pyrolysis tempera-
ture, pyrolysis time and transition metals. Yang et al. (2016) found out that higher
pyrolysis temperature (200–500 C) favours formation of free radicals which ulti-
mately enhances catalytic degradation capacity. Temperature above 700 C resulted
in loss of free radicals, hence, reducing the catalytic activity. They checked the
degradative role of biochar on p-nitrophenol, and feedstock used was pine wood,
corn stalk, peanut shell, rice and wheat.
Another factor that affects the catalytic activity of biochar is pyrolysis time; with
prolonged pyrolysis, a gradual decline in catalytic capacity can be observed. This
decline happens due to the decomposition of phenolic compounds that play role in
catalysis. Fang et al. (2015) demonstrated that for the generation of free radicals at
low temperatures (less than 500 C), the optimum pyrolysis time required is 12 h.
For pyrolysis temperature greater than 500 C, the required time is 1 h. In another
study, Wang and Wang (2019) checked the efﬁciency of biochar/Fe(III)/persulfate
system for catalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole. The rate constant for biochar/
Fe/persulfate system was found to be 31.3 times of biochar/persulfate system and 8.2
times that of Fe (III)/persulfate system (Fig. 14.2).
In this study, biochar preparation was undertaken at 500 C for 2 h. The mass
ratio of biomass to water too affects the catalytic ability of hydrocarbon. Greater
value of biomass to water ratio favours formation of environmental persistent free
radicals (EPFRs). It is concluded that catalytic activity of biochar/hydrocarbon is
mainly based on pyrolysis temperature, transition metals, mass ratio of biomass to
water and pyrolysis time.
Transition metal affects the catalytic capacity of biochar as it accounts for the
generation of persistent free radicals. Mechanism involves the transfer of electron
from phenol or quinone to metal oxides (e.g. Fe2O3) and later promoting the
generation of persistent free radicals (PFRs). Here metal (transition metals)
possesses higher redox potential. Fang et al. (2014) from his studies on degradation
of contaminants reported that Fe reacts with H2O2 to produce OH radicals; further
H2O2 reacts with hydroxyl radicals to generate superoxide ions (O2) that can
14
Removal of Contaminants by Modified Biochar-Based Material
313

degrade recalcitrant contaminants. Fe (III) is reported to possess the highest redox
potential which helps achieve fast EPFR formation.
In the studies done by Lyu et al. (2019), they prepared biochar via ball milling.
Ball-milled biochar exhibited greater electrocatalytic activity for reduction of Fe
(CN)6
3. They reported that ball milling enhanced oxygen-containing functional
group content from 0.8 to 2.9 to 2.2–2.4 m mol/g. Altogether it can be concluded that
ball milling is a great engineering technique to enhance external and internal surface
area together with good amount of surface functional group, and also exposing the
graphitic structure, hence, increasing the catalytic capacity of biochar. Recently, the
immobilizations of metal photocatalyst on biochar have paved another potential way
for degradation of highly toxic emerging contaminants. It involves cooperation of
adsorption and photocatalysis. Conventional catalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 and
ZrO2 possess high catalytic activity with good chemical stability but possess
limitations due to their large band gap width and difﬁculty in separation from
aqueous solution and undergo photodissolution.
14.4.2 Adsorption
Properties that inﬂuence the adsorption efﬁciency of biochar are de-ashing treatment,
pH, dosage of adsorbent, competitive anions and temperature.
Chen et al. (2008) analysed the combined desorption and distribution effects of
biochar derived from pine needle at various temperatures (100–700 C). Study
revealed that the pyrolysis temperature has a signiﬁcant impact on the structural
change of biochar and greatly inﬂuences adsorption capacity for numerous organic
pollutants. Degree of adsorption increases in the order of increasing temperature,
consistent with their speciﬁc surface area (Chen et al. 2008). Chen et al. (2012a, b)

noted that the pyrolysis temperature of biomass affects the rate of adsorption of
compounds by biochar as it is proportionally associated with degree of carbonization
of biochar. Higher temperature results in complete carbonization of the organic
matter of biomass; this greatly increases the surface area. Beside this, more
nanopores are generated which enhance the adsorption rate of naphthalene.
Ahmad et al. (2013) pointed out that the presence of more carbonized matter in
biochar generated at higher temperature leads to greater adsorption of trichloroethy-
lene. At higher treatment temperature, hydrophobicity of biochar increases with the
loss of oxygen and hydrogen functional groups. Hence, this leads to higher adsorp-
tion of hydrophobic compounds such as trichloroethylene. Kim et al. (2013) reported
that the pyrolysis temperature has impact on structure, elemental composition and
morphological properties of biochar. In this study, the pH and surface area of biochar
enhanced with pyrolysis temperature of greater than 500 C. As a result, increase in
Cd adsorption onto biochar was observed. Composition of feedstock also affects
adsorption capacity of biochar (Sun et al. 2014). Value of adsorption capacity for
pollutants differs with the type of original biomass or feedstock, even under the same
pyrolysis conditions. Mineral composition of feedstock plays important role in the
adsorption performance of biochar (Cao et al. 2009). Biochar derived from
co-pyrolysis could also be used to eradicate contaminants from aqueous solution.
Bernardo et al. (2013) checked removal efﬁciency of Pb by biochar derived from
co-pyrolysis of pine, used tires and plastic waste. Researchers further investigated
and compared adsorption properties of biochar derived from various biochar pro-
duction methods, besides the commonly used pyrolysis method. Liu et al. (2010)
reported that the hydrothermal treatment has potential to create more oxygen-
containing groups on biochar surface than pyrolysis process. Kumar et al. (2011)
showed that the biochar derived from hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) exhibits
better adsorption properties for Cu from wastewater. There is limited adsorption of
contaminants from water, when demineralization or de-ashing treatment is
performed on biochar. De-ashing greatly inﬂuences the composition and surface
characteristics of biochar as it decreases the elemental composition of surface except
for carbon. Zhang et al. (2013a, b) pointed out that after de-ashing, adsorption
capacity of biochar increases since inorganic compounds are removed which are
supposed to prevent access to organic adsorption sites in biochar. Sun et al.
(2013a, b) studied the effects on structural performance and adsorption performance
of phenanthrene biochar after de-ashing treatment. After decarbonization, biochar
had more hydrophobic domains and couple of polar functional groups. As a result,
favourable and hydrophobic organic adsorption sites increased. This ultimately
enhanced adsorption of phenanthrene (Fig. 14.3).
14.4.2.1 pH of the Solution
During optimization of adsorption process, pH of the solution is one of the crucial
parameters. The role of pH on adsorption depends on the type of biochar and the
target pollutants. It not only inﬂuences the surface charge of the absorbent but also
affects the degree of ionization as well as morphology of adsorbate (Li et al. 2013).
Therefore, most studies involving the adsorption of organic or inorganic pollutants
14
Removal of Contaminants by Modified Biochar-Based Material
315

consider the effect of pH. Biochar is enriched with number of functional groups such
as carboxylate and hydroxyl. As pH of the functional group increases, behaviour of
functional group alters. The surface of biochar is enriched with protonated functional
groups at low pH. For pH less than pHpzc (point of zero charge), biochar surface
exhibits positively charged functional groups; this facilitates the adsorption of
negatively charged organic pollutants (anions) (Abdel-Fattah et al. 2015). In addi-
tion, the presence of large amounts of H+ and H3O+ in aqueous solution may
compete with cations available on adsorption sites. Therefore, at low pH value,
electrostatic repulsion occurs between cationic contaminants and cationic functional
groups present on the surface of biochar. With gradual increase in pH value,
deprotonation of functional group occurs, and the competition between metal ions
and proton for binding site declines and more binding sites are free. When biochar
pH is greater than pHpzc (point of zero charge), the surface of biochar is negatively
charged, and increased binding of cationic compounds on biochar surface was
observed increasing its adsorption capacity. These trends have been observed in
studies on the adsorption of different heavy metals by various biochar. Oh et al.
(2012) investigated the effect of pH on ﬂuoride adsorption by water treatment sludge
biochar, which can also be explained on the basis of pHpzc (point of zero charge).
Chen et al. (2011) demonstrated that the biochar derived from hardwood and corn
straw indicates higher adsorption capacity for copper and zinc at high pH and peaked
at pH 5. Further hype in pH value resulted in decline of adsorption capacity.
Formation of hydroxide complexes might be responsible for this decline in adsorp-
tion capacity. Parshetti et al. (2014) in their study reported that the food waste
biochar show adsorption of textile dyes. The effect on adsorption was evaluated
for pH range of 3.0–9.0. Highest dye adsorption was observed at alkaline pH
because of the electrostatic interaction between cationic dye molecules and nega-
tively charged surface. At acidic pH, the low adsorption efﬁciency is a result of dye
protonation and excess H+ ions in the solution that compete with cationic dye
molecules for available adsorption sites. Tsai and Chen (2013) reported that the
Fig. 14.3 Mechanisms of adsorption of organic contaminant on biochar/biochar-based materials
(Tan et al. 2015)
316
K. Dasauni et al.

adsorption capacity of paraquat onto biochar signiﬁcantly increased when pH of
aqueous solution changed from 4.5 to 7.5 due to increased number of negatively
charged sites. Similar trends were observed with the adsorption of methyl violet and
oxytetracycline (Jia et al. 2013).
14.4.2.2 Co-existed Ions
For real-world application of biochar in actual water system, co-existence of ions has
a crucial impact on the equilibrium adsorption capacity. As in the environment, the
complex pollutants co-exist and have an interaction with adsorption efﬁciency. In a
study by Jia et al. (2013), they observed the effect of corn stover biochar on
adsorption of oxytetracycline involving interaction with metal ions. Results
indicated that the presence of heavy metals has different effects on oxytetracycline
adsorption on biochar. For example, Cd+2 has no obvious adsorption effect on it;
Zn+2 promotes small level of adsorption; Pb+2 carries small inhibition effect; and
Cu+2 at all pH values promotes adsorption of oxytetracycline on biochar. In another
study on adsorption of co-existing pollutant in real environment by Zhang et al.
(2011), they observed a signiﬁcant reduction in adsorption capacity of biochar in the
presence of more than one pollutant, for instance, the co-existence of diazine and
azine. On the other hand, co-existing compounds sometimes show competitive
adsorption where they inhibit adsorption of each other on to biochar. Kong et al.
(2011) observed the same inhibition of adsorption or total reduction of adsorption
scenario for phenanthrene (PHE) and Hg (II) in aqueous solution. However,
co-existence
of
humic
acid
and
cations
enhanced
the
adsorption
of
polychlorinated-biphenyl (PCBs) on biochar.
14.4.2.3 Dosage of Adsorbent
Adsorption efﬁciency of biochar for organic or heavy metal pollutants is signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuenced by dosage of adsorbent. It was observed in a study that the increase
in concentration of adsorbent/biochar for the contaminant’s removal reduces the
total adsorption capacity of biochar (Chen et al. 2011). A study by Tsai and Chen
(2013) pointed out that adsorption sites increase in line together with the increase in
adsorbent dosage (i.e. 0.10–0.30 g/L). However, there was reduction of adsorption
efﬁciency of biochar as its mass increased. In yet another study, it was reported that
at constant concentration of methylene blue, the dye adsorption increases with
increase in biochar dosage from 2 to 8 g/L. This characteristic can be attributed to
the increase in adsorption surface resulting in availability of more adsorption sites
(Sun et al. 2013a, b).
14.4.2.4 Temperature
Adsorption of contaminants on biochar is an endothermic process and with increase
in temperature, adsorption capacity increases. For example, Pb ion adsorption on
pinewood and rice husk biochar is more favourable at high temperature. This high
temperature provides energy for capturing lead ions onto the interior structure (Liu
and Zhang 2009; Zhang et al. 2013a, b). To test the rise in temperature adsorption
capacity of biochar, Sun et al. (2013a, b) investigated the effect of temperatures at
14
Removal of Contaminants by Modified Biochar-Based Material
317

30, 40 and 50 C on adsorption capacity for methylene blue dye (cationic in nature).
Signiﬁcant enhancement in adsorption efﬁciency of methylene blue at 50 C was
observed for biochar derived from eucalyptus as rise in temperature increased the
rate of diffusion of methylene blue.
14.4.3 Biochar as Gas Absorbent
Many scientiﬁc studies have proposed biochar as feasible low-cost gas adsorbent
compared to CO2 adsorbents as well as activated carbon. Surface chemistry of
biochar shows better adsorption capacity of CO2, benzene and methyl ethyl ketones
(MEK) in air. Zhang et al. (2019) shows adsorption performance of different
feedstock materials like rice straw pyrolyzed at 300–500 C for heavy metal ions
including Pb, Cd and Hg. These biochars are suitable for large-scale remediation of
environmental pollutants. Gao et al. (2019) demonstrated that the adsorption capac-
ity of rice husk biochar for Cd+2 is greater than sewage sludge biochar. Adsorption
phenomenon here is the result of precipitation and cation exchange mechanism. Cao
et al. (2019) used wheat straw biochar to analyse the adsorption efﬁciencies of
carbonization and ball milling for removal of Pb form waste or polluted water. At
lower adsorption dosage, both efﬁciently promoted Pb+2 adsorption due to enhanced
ion exchange capacity. Dai et al. (2020) used Auricularia auricular drugs-derived
biochar for tetracycline removal, and with increase in pyrolysis temperature, adsorp-
tion capacity increased. This adsorption possibly involved pore-ﬁlling effects,
hydrogen bonding, electrostatic repulsion and π-π EDA interaction.
14.5
Reduction
Biochar catalyst reduces the toxicity of contaminants through their reduction, espe-
cially in case of heavy metals. Heavy metal, chromium (Cr (VI)), is a top priority
hazardous pollutant, whereas Cr (III) is quite less toxic to environment. Therefore,
reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr (III) has gathered much attention. Oxygen-containing
functional groups on biochar surface are involved in Cr reduction making it less
toxic (Xu et al. 2019). Cr (VI) reduction by biochar in the presence of orange G
irradiated with UV was investigated. Here orange G oxidation produces organic acid
which acts as electron donor to carry out reduction of Cr (VI). Further addition of
persulfate into the system enhances the reduction efﬁciency of Cr (VI). Hence, it can
be concluded that biochar plays a key role in reduction and oxidation of inorganic/
heavy metal contaminants (Jeon et al. 2017).

14.6
Oxidation
Biochar and biochar-based catalysts remove organic pollutants via oxidation with or
without the addition of oxidants. Fang et al. (2015) stated that organic pollutants can
be oxidized by biochar with the use of external oxidants. Qin et al. (2017) carried out
a study to ﬁgure out the effectiveness of degradation of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D)
by biochar at various temperatures 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 C. Moisture content
of biochar plays a crucial role in removal of 1,3-D, and they concluded that the
higher the moisture content, the greater the adsorption performance of biochar
(Huang et al. 2015). With the rise in pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 500 C, a
decline in the rate of degradation of 1,3-D can be observed; this is due to decrease in
concentration of OH radicals. However, further increase in pyrolysis temperature
from 500 to 700 C shows a rise in degradation rate, as a consequence of increase in
pore size of biochar, thus, suggesting the effect of porosity selective adsorption. Its
worthy to note that the concentration of EPFR of biochar has an inverse relation with
the rate of degradation of 1,3-D; for instance, biochar at 500 C carries the highest
EPFR concentration, while at the same time the rate of degradation is the lowest.
This indicates that EPFRs of biochar contained external radicals as well as internal
radicals. Only the surface exposed external EPFRs participate in reaction with
oxygen and induce formation of hydroxyl radicals, catalysing the degradation of
1,3-D. Hydrogen peroxide, persulfate and peroxymonophosphate are some of the
oxidants which when added to biochar generate ROS that helps degrade organic
contaminants (Kemmou et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020). Wang and Wang (2019)
found
that
triclosan
is
signiﬁcantly
decomposed
when
biochar-activated

14.6.1 Advanced Oxidation Process
Advanced oxidation processes are widely applied in wastewater treatment and
production of potable or reusable water to combat the clean water crisis. Advanced
oxidation process works by generation of free radicals such as hydroxyl, sulphate-
free radicals or chlorine radicals to oxidize or degrade toxic or recalcitrant
compounds. In case of biochar, they during production generate and have environ-
ment persistent free radicals on their surface which react with oxygen gas to produce
hydroxyl radicals without the use of external oxidant (Lyu et al. 2020). These
hydroxyl radicals further oxidize the reduced organic or emerging contaminants
(Yu et al. 2020). Ruan et al. (2019) described biochar as a source of free radical for
such reaction as EPFR have longer lifetime. EPFR are also known to catalyse
oxidants to generate ROS for further oxidation of reduced compound. Chemical
compounds such as catechol, phenol, endocrine-disrupting compounds, etc. can be
oxidized by free radical processes. Zhu et al. (2018) demonstrated that some
biochars could possess higher catalytic activity than popular metal and nanocarbon
catalysts by utilizing the N-doped graphitic Phragmites australis biochar to activate
peroxydisulfate. Sun et al. (2019) produced multiple iron biochar composites
14
Removal of Contaminants by Modified Biochar-Based Material
319

(Fe-BC) with varying ratio of Fe/BC mass ratio used for eradication of different
pollutants from hydraulic fracturing wastewater. Fe-BC composite at ratio of 1:1
performed the best for simultaneous removal of 1,1,2-TCA as well as organic
compounds present in high salinity hydraulic fracturing wastewater. In another
study, Yang et al. (2019a, b) prepared corn stalk biochar composites featured with
different layered double hydroxide (LDHs) and observed that incorporation of LDHs
improves the adsorption capacity for phosphate many times. Here, the interlayer
anion exchange and surface complexation are the dominant phenomenon among
other adsorption mechanisms. An interesting study conducted by Zhang et al. (2020)
used green synthesis method to produce banana peel biochar/iron oxide composites.
These composites showed enhanced adsorption capacity for methylene blue and
were reusable after ﬁve cycles. Bamboo sawdust derived biochar pretreated with
phytic acid may enhance the surface area along with pore volumes and phosphorous
contents (Hu et al. 2020).
14.6.2 Biochar and Biochar-Based Catalysts for Photocatalysis
Besides the use of oxidants for degradation of organic contaminants, biochar and
biochar-based composites also show the property of photocatalysis for degradation
of contaminants. Photocatalysis involves either the use of ultraviolet or visible light
or in combination. Lu et al. (2019) investigated the degradation ability of TiO2/
biochar catalyst for methyl orange solution under the inﬂuence of UV irradiation. At
a biochar to Ti weight ratio of 0.2, 0.25 g/L/TiO2/biochar removed 96.88% of 20 mg/
L methyl orange solution in 140 min. Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion
radicals are responsible for oxidation of methyl orange. Among these, hydroxyl
radicals played the dominant role.
Pi et al. (2015) noted that biochar acts as co-catalysts to provide sufﬁcient
catalytic sites for graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) under LED light irradiation.
Biochar-based photocatalyst works as follows: electrons move from valence band
to conduction band upon irradiation, formation of electron-hole pair takes place,
followed by the formation of OH and O radicals, and then degradation of
contaminants takes place on the photocatalyst surface.
14.7
Biochar in Environmental Remediation and Wastewater
Treatment
Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus are the most essential elements
required for structure and functions of living organisms. Nitrogen is required for
synthesis of protein and nitrogenous bases, whereas phosphorus is a crucial part of
structures such as cell membranes, genetic material and energy-carrying molecules
(Marschner 2012). Anthropogenically generated organic waste, plant remains and
untreated industrial discharge often lead to accumulation of nutrient into aquatic
systems, which leads to eutrophication in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries
320
K. Dasauni et al.

worldwide. Eutrophication results in formation of algal blooms. This causes threat to
drinking water safety as well as biodiversity of aqueous systems. In water bodies,
elements responsible for causing eutrophication are inorganic nitrogen and phos-
phorus, generally existing in the form of ammonium (NH+4), nitrate (NO3) and
phosphate (PO4
23). Algal bloom is caused by simultaneous presence of N and P
(NH+4 and PO4
3, NO3 and PO4
3), whereas the presence of N alone does not
result in the formation of algal bloom (Zeng et al. 2016). To tackle the problem of
eutrophication, a dual-nutrient-reduction strategy can be used for removal of both N-
and P-rich compounds. Additionally, atmospheric precipitation, biological nitrogen
ﬁxation and decomposition of organic matters also contribute to the total N and P
concentration in aquatic ecosystems.
Phosphate-accumulating organisms are one of the ways of removing P-rich
compounds in polluted or wastewater where phosphate-accumulating organisms
store and release phosphates (Nielsen et al. 2019). As a supplementary method to
biological processes, the chemical precipitation processes can be employed, which
involve metal and metaloxides to precipitate phosphate (Ye et al. 2017). Depending
on adsorbent properties and ambient electrolyte conditions, adsorption is considered
an effective and rapid process to remove contaminants from the aqueous systems.
Zeolites, bentonite, polymeric ion exchangers, nanoparticles and aluminium oxides
have been evaluated for their effectiveness in eradication of N- and P-rich
compounds (Alshameri et al. 2018; Angar et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018). Because of
the easy availability of feedstock and its low cost, biochar is a material of interest for
environmental remediation. Metallic elements in biochar might help in binding of
soil nutrients NO3, PO4
3 and NH+4 via speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc adsorption. So,
these can act as N- and P-enriched input where undesirable contaminants can be
transformed into desirable nutrients in the agricultural system (Hale et al. 2013).
Taghizadeh-Toosi et al. (2012) reported that biochar sequestered ammonia in stable
form for a duration of 12 days which is considered to be available for plant uptake. In
a number of studies, biochar has been used for individual as well as simultaneous
removal of N (NH+4, NO3) and P (PO4
3) from aqueous solution (Yang et al. 2018;
Gao et al. 2015).
14.7.1 Ammonium Removal by Biochar
In aqueous solution, ammonium is one of the main inorganic forms of nitrogen. pH
and temperature inﬂuence the inter-conversion of ammonium and ammonia.
According to Emerson et al. (1975) in most of the aqueous environment, ammonium
serves as main source of ammonia at pH less than 8.2 and temperature less than
28 C. To evaluate the removal efﬁciency of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) by
biochar, extensive batch adsorption studies have been conducted by Yang et al.
(2018) particularly with pine sawdust biochar and wheat straw biochar, whereas Gao
et al. (2015) and Liu et al. (2016) conducted the same for peanut shell biochar, corn
cob biochar and cotton stalk biochar. Throughout the literature, Qmax value of
biochar varies with a mean value of 11.19 mg N/g. For pine sawdust biochar
14
Removal of Contaminants by Modified Biochar-Based Material
321

which pyrolyzed at temperatures 300 and 500 C, the Qmax values for NH4-N were
5.38 and 3.37 mg N/g, respectively (Yang et al. 2018). For giant reed-based biochar
pyrolyzed at 500 C, Qmax value is 1.21–1.49 mg N/g (Hou et al. 2016).
14.7.2 Ammonium Removal by Modified Biochar
Alteration in biochar surface functional group and increase in CEC value together
with enhanced chemical precipitation could improve total adsorption capacity of
ammonium by biochar. For instance, to enhance Qmax value of ammonium,
materials with high CEC can be added into char feedstocks (such as bentonite).
Similarly, Gong et al. (2017) used Mg-modiﬁed Phragmites australis biochar where
adsorption isotherm for NH+4 was observed to be linear. This indicates unsaturated
adsorption capacities and with rising concentration of NH4-N, Qmax value was
found to be 32 mg N/g within the tested concentration range. This result attributes to
the property of cationic exchange that took place between Mg+2 and NH+4.
Phosphate-rich biochar shows higher adsorption capacity for NH+4 in the presence
of Mg+2 as a result of precipitation of MgNH4PO4 (Struvite) (Fan et al. 2019).
14.7.3 Nitrate Removal by Biochar
Due to complete dissociation of HNO3, nitrate is mostly present in anionic form
(NO3) in aquatic phase. One of the signiﬁcant barriers for nitrate adsorption on
biochar is contributed by electrostatic repulsion between nitrates and negatively
charged surface constituents existing on biochar.
14.7.4 Nitrate Removal by Unmodified Biochar
A number of studies have shown that the unmodiﬁed biochar had minimal adsorp-
tion capacity for nitrate. Gai et al. (2014) investigated 12 biochars pyrolyzed from
3 different feedstocks in batch adsorption tests. They observed no removal of nitrate
from aqueous solution, even in some cases biochar released rather than adsorbing
nitrate. These results are explainable by taking into consideration higher pyrolysis
temperature (600 C) which leads to changes in physiochemical properties such as
higher surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups (Ahmad et al. 2014).
Reduction in oxygen-containing functional group minimizes electrostatic repulsion
between biochar and nitrate, whereas increase in surface area enhances number of
biochar sorption sites.

14.7.5 Nitrate Removal by Modified Biochar
Signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of biochar positively facilitates nitrate adsorption, espe-
cially the modiﬁcations that provide hindrance to electrostatic interaction between
biochar and nitrate ions. Protonation of anionic functional groups and impregnation
of metal/metal oxide on biochar are commonly used modiﬁcation strategies. For
instance, hydrochloric acid-treated biochar shows greater adsorption capacity for
nitrate (Chintala et al. 2013). HCl-modiﬁed ponderosa pine wood residue-based
biochar achieved highest level of adsorption for nitrate (9.74 mg N/g) when com-
pared to untreated biochar that showed adsorption of 2.58 mg N/g. Here, enhanced
adsorption attributes to rise in surface area by tenfold after HCl modiﬁcation.
Lanthanum-immersed sawdust pyrolyzed to biochar also enhances nitrate adsorption
capacity of unmodiﬁed oak sawdust biochar from 2.02 to 22.58 mg N/g. This
observation is also attributed to the increase in functional groups in lanthanum-
modiﬁed biochar (Wang et al. 2015). In another study, Zhang et al. (2012) repeated
the same method by immersing biomass feedstocks in MgCl2 solution prior to
pyrolysis treatment resulting in increase in adsorption capacity of MgO-modiﬁed
biochar nanocomposites for nitrate. The observations showed adsorption capacity of
this MgO-modiﬁed biochar as high as 95 mg N/g.
14.7.6 Removal of Phosphate by Unmodified Biochar
Depending on the environmental pH H2PO4
1, HPO4
2 and PO4
3 are some of the
forms in which inorganic P is found in aqueous solution or contaminated water
bodies. Phosphate anions show repulsion to the negatively charged surface func-
tional groups of biochar. Therefore, for inorganic phosphate, adsorption capacity of
biochar is poor. In a study (Gong et al. 2017) with 22 unmodiﬁed biochars,
adsorption capacity of PO4-P was tested from which only 4 biochars exhibited
positive results for PO4-P removal. This indicates weak interaction between most
of the wetland-derived biochar and PO4-P. Gong et al. (2017) pointed out that the
biochar of Phragmites australis (600 C) provides little interaction with total
phosphorus (TP) levels in a sample derived from eutrophic lake. The ability of
biochar towards sorption of PO4-P also shows biomass dependence. Biochar derived
from peanut shells at 700 C shows greater PO4-P removal capacity than oak,
soybean and bamboo pyrolyzed at same temperature (Jung et al. 2015).
14.7.7 Phosphate Removal by Modified Biochar
Scientiﬁc communities have strategically attempted to increase phosphate adsorp-
tion capacity of biochar via addition of metals and metal oxides to feedstock. A large
number of studies involved the use of Mg to promote PO4-P adsorption to biochar.
Here the strong divalent cation promotes binding between Mg and P (Wang et al.
2020). P-sorption is associated with the concentration of intrinsic Mg present in

biochar feedstock. Thalia dealbata-derived biochar shows greater adsorption capac-
ity (2.54–4.96 mg P/g) when compared to three other phytoremediation plants. This
increase in adsorption capacity by Mg-modiﬁcation can be attributed to factors such
as concentration of Mg, pyrolysis parameters and differences in intrinsic properties
of biochar.
14.8
Conclusion and Future Prospects
A survey of number of literatures on application as well as production processes of
biochar reveals the use of wide variety of biomass materials. The properties (adsorp-
tion and catalysis) are profoundly affected by parameters of pyrolysis, feedstock
used and modifying agents used. This catalytic property of biochar and biochar-
based composites holds potential future in environmental remediation and wastewa-
ter treatment. It is carried out in three ways: ﬁrst, EPFRs of biochar react with
oxygen to generate hydroxyl radicals, second, activation using hydrogen peroxide or
persulfate generate hydroxyl or sulphate radicals, and third, act as electron acceptor
to improve photodegradation capacity of catalysts. However, the current application
of biochar as catalysts is limited to laboratory scale. An analysis of adsorption
mechanisms reveals that different kinds of interactions including electrostatic attrac-
tion, ion exchange, physical adsorption and chemical bonding (complexation and/or
precipitation) are predominantly responsible for binding water pollutants. Therefore,
large-scale assessment and technical and economic applications should be
encouraged.

Abstract
Wastewater treatment is the key point to improve environmental and health
quality. In fact, providing clean water and sanitation for everyone is featured as
goal number 6 in the list of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
established by the United Nations. In this context, biochar application has
emerged as an efﬁcient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly option to wastewater
contaminant removal. Considering the importance of highlighting some success-
ful studies applied worldwide, this chapter will address the most relevant and
diverse biochar materials used on the removal of pathogens, heavy metals,
pharmaceuticals, and emergent contaminants from wastewater. Additionally, it
brings a critical review of current research updates in this issue, especially
considering that biochar application is in accordance with the circular economy
concept.

Introduction
One of the consequences of population growth is the increase on demand of foods
such as cereal and animal protein. This increase leads to a greater volume of
wastewater being generated, in an estimated world annual volume of 1000 km3 of
efﬂuent produced (Lu et al. 2018). After proper treatment, wastewater is commonly
disposed through incineration or applied as fertilizer on crops (Wang et al. 2017).
Over the last decades, it has been proposed that wastewater be reused on irrigation,
once that it is a rich source of nutrients and water for plants (Perez-Mercado et al.
2019). However, it is important to highlight the necessity of biosecurity protocols for
the reuse of this material, once that wastewater could also be source of contaminants
such as pathogens, residues of heavy metals, pharmaceutical, endocrine disruptors,
and dyes from textile industries (Li et al. 2019).
The lack of proper wastewater treatment is a problem that affects people all
around the world; as a consequence, thousands of contaminants reach the environ-
ment every day. This lead to the United Nations (UN) establishing the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG), a list of 17 goals created with the intention of encourag-
ing research on key points related to sustainability and environmental preservation.
Goal number 6 is about “clean water and sanitation for all” by 2030 (Gwenzi et al.
2017).
To achieve this goal, it is necessary to look for practical and efﬁcient treatment
methods to manage wastewaters. Among the low-cost methods to remove physical,
chemical, and biological contaminants from aqueous solutions, biochar has
presented itself as a promising option (Gwenzi et al. 2017); more than 6934
publications have been made on this topic from 1998 to 2018 (Wu et al. 2019).
However, the ﬁrst biochar application on wastewater treatment only happened in
2009 (Wu and Wu 2019).
The main steps of the transformation of residues into biochar by pyrolysis or
gasiﬁcation and its possible application to wastewater treatment are presented in
Fig. 15.1. These processes can generate three different products: biochar, gas, and oil
(Scholz et al. 2014). The pyrolysis system produces more biochar than the gasiﬁca-
tion, due to less oxygen present in the process. However, depending on the material
composition, the amount of biochar generated can change, for instance, the silica
content (such as rice husk), which prevents total carbonization, and consequently
preserves the biochar structure, resulting in a bigger volume of biochar (Scholz et al.
2014).
One of the advantages of biochar is that it could be produced from a huge
diversity of feedstock, enabling the use of local materials (natural and waste)
available where the treatment will be implemented, such as agricultural residues
(cereal plant parts), wood, and so on (Kaetzl et al. 2020).
Biochar mainly removes organic and inorganic pollutants through adsorption.
The nature of the feedstock material, the contaminant target and the pyrolysis
conditions, as well as surface area, chemical functional groups, and pore size are
factors that can alter its removal efﬁciency (Tan et al. 2015).

W. Michelon et al.

Biochar produced at high temperatures (above 500 C) usually presents hydro-
phobic surface areas, which favor the adsorption of organic pollutants, while at low
temperatures, a smaller pore size and oxygen-containing functional groups favor the
adsorption of inorganic pollutants (Tang et al. 2015). Additionally, adsorption
capacity can be improved by using chemical pretreatment techniques (Tang et al.
2015), such as applying alkali solutions which increase pore abundance, contact
surface areas, and functional groups (Pokharel et al. 2020). Considering the nature of
the binding and the ligation of the pollutant and the biochar, another important
parameter is the contact time between these two elements (Sforza et al. 2020).
Therefore, understanding these adsorption mechanisms is of essential importance
to determine the treatment system layout and the operational conditions in order to
achieve the highest removal rates.
15.1.1 Biochar Application in the Circular Economy Approach
Among the various advantages associated with biochar, one of them is the huge
options of materials that can be transformed by the pyrolysis process (Table 15.1). It
is worth to note that all of them are residues from other processes, mainly from
agriculture and forest activities such as crops or forest residues, and so on (Fytili and
Zabaniotou 2018). The practice of reusing residues in new production systems has
been utilized over the last decades, especially for being in accordance with the
concept of circular economy, which aims to close the loop of material utilization,
especially considering the value aggregations and sustainability approaches (Fytili
and Zabaniotou 2018).

Application of Biochar for Removal of Heavy Metals, Pathogens, and. . .

Additionally, there can be economic and social advantages indirectly associated
with biochar production. Fytili and Zabaniotou (2018) have proposed the construc-
tion of a collective thermochemical system for bioenergy production, where residues
generated on small rural properties could be gathered and used to produce energy,
provide waste management, generate income for farmers, and, consequently,
improve living conditions. After that, the biochar produced could be sold to be
used as soil additive or in water and wastewater treatment.
Wastewater treatment materials have been the research subject for thousands of
scientists around the world for a long time, for reasons such as the nutrient richness,
and the reuse of wastewater liquid fraction on irrigation. However, these practices
are of special concern once that, when unproperly treated, this material offers a very
high pollution potential through the spread of pathogens, the presence of heavy
metals, natural and artiﬁcial bioactive residues (hormones, pharmaceuticals), and
other pollutants directly related to the activity which generated the wastewater.
Treatment methods always present disadvantages, especially when the pilot is left
in the hands of large-scale plants (Li et al. 2019). Therefore, it is fair to say there is no
perfect treatment that ﬁts perfectly on the premises of being 100% efﬁcient,
eco-friendly, low-cost, and applicable to any type of contaminant removal.
Biochar presents versatile surface characteristics and has been proven to success-
fully remove a large amount of pollutants. Thus, its application has been pointed out
as an opportunity to improve treatment systems maintaining eco-properties and
avoiding the need for modiﬁcation on the actual layout.
15.2
Biochar Application for Wastewater Treatment
15.2.1 Removal of Pathogens
Many studies have pointed wastewater as a potential sink for human and animal
pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and several protozoa species, which have been
responsible for approximately 1.4 million deaths of children associated with water-
borne diseases worldwide annually (Sinclair et al. 2008). As an example, there are

more than 150 identiﬁed types of enteric viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route,
thought water contamination by wastewater (animal or human) discharge or runoff
(Sinclair et al. 2008).
Pathogen removal happens mainly through attachment and physical straining in
small pore spaces (Torkzaban and Bradford 2016). This interaction can be
inﬂuenced by physical and chemical factors such as pH, temperature, the presence
of organic matter, metal oxides, and so on (Wong et al. 2013). Changes in these
factors can lead to changes in the removal rate, for instance, an increase in pH levels
can lead to higher electrostatic repulsion of bacteria cells, and consequently, to such
pathogens not binding to the biochar (Mosley et al. 2015). Additionally, biochar
properties can also inﬂuence pathogen removal rates (Sasidharan et al. 2016), such
as the low-velocity areas created by small porous on the surface, which can lead to a
higher retention of microbes (Mohanty and Boehm 2014).
The design of the treatment system can also inﬂuence the removal rate of
pathogens, as studies have suggested that column systems are better to attach
microbes than the batch systems (Torkzaban and Bradford 2016). Also, the use of
biochar-amended materials such as sand ﬁlters has been reported as a better alterna-
tive than materials without it (Chung et al. 2014). Mohanty and Boehm (2014) have
reported improved rates of removal efﬁciency of up to 96% using these materials.
However, the same study reported that biochar with particles smaller than 125 μm
decreased the removal efﬁciency from 95 to 62%. Ghavanloughajar et al. (2020)
previously proposed that this phenomenon could be associated with the deposition of
small particles, blocking the natural ﬂow paths of the wastewater. These particles
might even be generated over time by a natural process of biochar degradation
(Ghavanloughajar et al. 2020). Because of this, some studies have suggested the
need for developing a prediction model that could estimate and avoid the clogging of
compacted bioﬁlters (Le et al. 2020).
Additionally, in some situations, a bioﬁlm might grow in the biochar surface,
decreasing

efﬁciency,

characteristics (Mohanty and Boehm 2015). Chemical modiﬁcations on biochar
have been recommended to increase the removal of virus particles through the
formation of a surface with positive charge (Sasidharan et al. 2016).
In bath treatments, microbes retained during one cycle might be carried into the
next, increasing the contamination instead of remove, and that in longer hydraulic
retention time cycles, the removal efﬁciency decrease due to the detachment
showing the importance of system careful maintenance (Mohanty et al. 2013).
Similarly, Guan et al. (2020) evaluated a biosand laboratory-modiﬁed ﬁltering
system with two biochars (one produced from wheat straw and the other one from
willow wood) on E. coli removal. The ﬁlter containing wheat straw biochar
presented the higher E. coli removal efﬁciency (84%) when compared to the willow
wood biochar ﬁlter (79%), and both biochars showed adsorption capacities of 5.7
log10 CFU g1.
However, it is important to highlight that surface area from the wheat straw
biochar was 55.24 (m2 g1), while the one from willow wood was 380.00
15
Application of Biochar for Removal of Heavy Metals, Pathogens, and. . .
335

(m2 g1). This demonstrates that other properties could be involved on bacteria
adsorption.
Bacteriophages, such as MS2 and ɸX174, are recognized as model (markers)
organisms for virus behavior on environmental samples for being nonpathogenic to
human and easy to analyze. Besides, MS2 bacteriophage presents characteristics
such as low isoelectric point and low inactivation, while ɸX174 bacteriophages have
low hydrophobicity and electrostatic interaction (Perez-Mercado et al. 2019).
Considering this, Perez-Mercado et al. (2019) used these markers to evaluate their
removal by the application of a ﬁlter (60 cm depth, 7.5 cm diameter, 70 cm height)
containing biochar derived from hardwood. The results showed that the bioﬁlter did
not remove the viruses. However, the same ﬁlter was successfully applied on the
removal of protozoan-like biomarkers (Perez-Mercado et al. 2019).
Miscanthus biochar was used as wastewater ﬁltration media as compared with
sand ﬁlter. The removal of chemical oxygen demand of Miscanthus biochar was
74%, signiﬁcantly higher than the 61% observed on sand ﬁlters. The biochar also
presented higher results for E. coli removal, with a reduction of 1.35 log units (and
even higher with increased contact time (Kaetzl et al. 2020)) when compared to 1.18
log units for the sand ﬁlters. On the other hand, biochar produced from wood pellets
was not efﬁcient in removing E. coli (Reddy et al. 2014).
Lau et al. (2017) investigated E. coli removal by wood modiﬁed-biochar (with
H2SO4
, H3PO4
, and KOH) from synthetic media under intermittent ﬂow. The
results with H2SO4
 modiﬁed biochar showed approximately double the surface
area (234.7 m2 g1) when compared to the original biochar. E. coli removal by
modiﬁed biochar was around 98%, with an initial concentration of 106 CFU mL1.
This removal rate was mainly attributed to the surface characteristics (area,
hydrophobicity, and functional groups) and porous structure.
Even with the huge amount of studies about biochar applications on ﬁltering
systems, bacterial removal mechanisms are still not fully understood, and even less is
known about viruses removal mechanisms (Sasidharan et al. 2016).
15.2.2 Removal of Heavy Metals
Heavy metal residues can reach the environment and water bodies mainly through
anthropogenic industrial activities (Li et al. 2017). The most common ones are
chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, mercury, and zinc (Krabbenhoft and
Sunderland 2013). These residues are of special concern for their nondegradability
and, consequently, long persistence on environmental matrices and bioaccumulation
through the food chain (Masindi and Muedi 2018). This characteristic, together with
carcinogenicity and high toxicity, has made heavy metals be classiﬁed as extremely
dangerous for animals and plants, even in low concentrations (Masindi and Muedi
2018). The toxicity classiﬁcation of heavy metals puts them in the following order:
Hg > Cu > Zn > Ni > Pb > Cd > Cr > Sn > Fe > Mn > Al (Filipiak-Szok et al.
2015).
336
W. Michelon et al.

In humans, contamination by these metals can cause nausea, diarrhea, skin
allergy, hearth kidney, liver and brain damage, mutations, teratogenicity, and con-
genital disorders, depending on metal type, concentration, and exposition time
(Masindi and Muedi 2018). In this sense, many countries have considered heavy
metals to be a priority concern when it comes to water quality processes (Calderón
et al. 2020).
Heavy metal removal by biochar is based on various mechanisms such as
precipitation, complexation, ion exchange, electrostatic interaction, and sorption.
Sorption capacity depends mainly on biochar surface pore area, abundance size, and
distribution (Mukherjee et al. 2011). A common characteristic of biochar is having a
negative charge surface, which attracts positively charged metals. Additionally, the
presence of functional groups can form complexes with metals, once biochar
presents minerals such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sodium (Dong
et al. 2011). The mineral content may vary according to the material used on the
production of the biochar. For example, biochar derived from crop residue contains
less mineral fractions; therefore, sorption occurs by functional groups, while in
biochar derived from manure, which possess high mineral content, sorption happens
based on mineral-metal complexation and precipitation (Zhang et al. 2013).
Xu et al. (2013) reported that biochar produced from dairy manure was more
efﬁcient than that produced from rice husk waste on removing heavy metals (Pb, Cu,
Zn, and Cd). The authors reported that manure biochar removes these metals through
precipitation with CO3
2 and PO4
3, whereas rice husk biochar does so through the
complexation of heavy metals and phenolic –OH present in the material surface.
Another study has reported that the application of biochar produced from
digestate of dairy waste and sugar beet residues was effective on removing heavy
metals through precipitation (Inyang et al. 2012). The authors also observed that
waste treated by anaerobic digestion process and then transformed in biochar
presented a higher sorption capacity (Inyang et al. 2012).
Corn straw biochar removed Cd and Pb through surface complexation with
functional groups (–OH, –COO–), precipitation (CO3
2, SO4
2), and coordination
with π electrons (C¼C, C¼O) (Chi et al. 2017). Wood pristine biochar removed Hg
through interactions with C¼C, COH, and COO (Park et al. 2019).
Goh et al. (2019) showed that biochar from palm oil mill sludge predominantly
removes Cu and Cd through monolayer adsorption mechanism. The same study
concluded that when biochar was produced by fast pyrolysis (ranging from 425 to
550 C for <2 s), the resulting product mainly removes heavy metals through surface
contact area, while surface functional groups were the main removing factor on the
one produced by slow pyrolysis (ranging from 350 to 800 C for minutes or days).
Similar results were observed by Agraﬁoti et al. (2013) during biochar production
with sewage sludge, where there was a larger surface area with high temperature of
pyrolysis (500 C), while low temperature pyrolysis (300 C) increased biochar
yield.
The removal rate of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions with the application of banana peel
biochar had its efﬁciency increased by approximately 45% when the pH of the
solution was increased from 3 to 9; however, this process also increases the pH of the
15

337

eluate (Amin et al. 2018). In this context, special attention must be given to highly
alkaline biochars, once the disposal of treated solutions and biochar should respect
legislation limits for environmental disposal (Komkiene and Baltrenaite 2016).
A study conducted by Sforza et al. (2020) compared the effect of exposition time
on the removal of 3 mg L1 Cr(III) from real tannery wastewater using 5 g L1
pinewood biochar. The results showed that after 5 min of exposition, approximately
34% of the contaminant was removed; however, increasing the exposition time did
not improve the removal rate. The same study also observed that increasing biochar
concentration from 5 to 50 g L1 did not increase the Cr(III) removal rate. The
authors attributed these ﬁndings to the wastewater matrix complexity (Sforza et al.
2020).
15.2.3 Removal of Pharmaceuticals, Dyes, and Emergent
Contaminants
The emerging contaminants, also called endocrine disruptors, are chemical
compounds present in medicines, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, beauty and personal
care products, plasticizers, food additives, cleaning products, and so on (Li et al.
2019). These compounds present bioactive effects on living organisms which,
depending on the time and dose of exposure, can cause reproductive disorders and
cancer (Li et al. 2019), even at very small concentrations. Additionally, these
compounds have been found in bioaccumulative food chains and have therefore
become a global concern (Rout et al. 2021). The removal of these compounds needs
to be deeply analyzed due to the fact that some treatment methodologies generate
by-products that are more toxic than the parent compound (Rout et al. 2021).
About pharmaceuticals, special attention has been given to antibiotic use, once it
can lead to the creation of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains/genes (Rout et al.
2021). Besides, such residues in water bodies can inﬂuence natural microbial
communities and consequently the limnology cycles (Rout et al. 2021). Biochar
predominantly removes emerging contaminants from wastewater through adsorp-
tion, which depends on chemical bond, polarity charges, ash content, pore ﬁlling,
and volume (Li et al. 2019). The mechanism is also dependent of the physicochemi-
cal properties of these organic compounds, such as molecular size, aromaticity, and
hydrophobicity (Jung et al. 2013).
Biochar produced from agricultural crop waste has been recognized as an effec-
tive material for the adsorption of organic contaminants; Cao et al. (2009)
investigated the application of biochar derived from dairy manure to removal of
atrazine from wastewater, for example. In this study, the authors compared the use of
dairy manure biochar with commercial activated carbon and reported that the ﬁrst
one presented higher removal rates, and removal happened mainly through adsorp-
tion (Cao et al. 2009).
Taha et al. (2014) evaluated the removal of 15 different pesticides (atrazine,
azinphos-methyl,
acetamiprid,
boscalid,
carbaryl,
chlorfenvinphos,
diazinon,
imidacloprid, ﬂutolanil, ﬂusilazole, malathion, oxamyl, phosmet, propiconazole,
338
W. Michelon et al.

and triadimenol) by the application of rice straw biochar pretreated with acid
solution. They found that the pretreated biochar was more efﬁcient in the removal
of the pesticides after an exposition time of 2 h to a solution with pH 7. The authors
proposed that the process happened through Van der Waals forces, primary π–π
dispersive interactions and H-bonding (via highly polar bonds, nitro-group oxygen,
and carbonyl group oxygen) (Taha et al. 2014). Wood pellet biochar was successful
in removing phenanthrene (100%) and naphthalene (76%); it was not efﬁcient on the
removal of benzo(a)pyren (Reddy et al. 2014), however.
Emergent contaminants such as bisphenol A and 17α-ethinylestradiol are the
most frequent compounds studied on environmental matrices, mainly because of the
solubility of these compounds on water/wastewater (Sun et al. 2011). Sun et al.
(2011) evaluated the removal of emerging contaminants by the application of
biochar produced hydrothermally from organic waste/biomass. One advantage of
this process is the little amount of energy required to transform the wet feedstock into
biochar. This biochar was efﬁcient on bisphenol A and 17α-ethinylestradiol removal
through adsorption, which the authors attributed to the speciﬁc interaction of the
compounds with the biochar functional groups (Sun et al. 2011).
Biochars produced from loblolly pine chips (15 mm  6 mm) under oxygenated
and oxygen-free conditions were applied to the removal of emergent contaminants
(atrazine, bisphenol A, and 17 α-ethinylestradiol) and pharmaceutical active
compounds (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole) (Sun
et al. 2011). Biochar produced in oxygen-free conditions showed polarity due to
the presence of alkyl, carboxyl carbon, methoxyl, and O-alkyl, while biochar
produced in oxygenated conditions showed characteristics of aromaticity. Biochar
produced in oxygen-free conditions showed better adsorption capacity in the
removal of emergent contaminants and pharmaceuticals, suggesting that this mate-
rial is a promising sorbent for environmental and agricultural applications (Jung
et al. 2013).
Rice husk biochar produced in fast pyrolysis (450–500 C) by a Chinese industry
(1 ton per hour) was used by Liu et al. (2012) to evaluate tetracycline removal. The
adsorption mechanism was attributed mainly to hydrogen bonding and π–π
interactions, once the biochar was obtained from an oxygen-rich biomass,
possessing many functional groups, such as OH, CO2H, C¼O, and C–O (Liu et al.
2012).
Biochars produced with pine needles and wheat straw under different
temperatures (350–550 C) and oxygen-free conditions were tested on removal of
2,4,40-trichlorobiphenyl and displayed high adsorption capacity. The same study
also investigated the 2,4,40-trichlorobiphenyl removal by both biochars in the pres-
ence of metals (K+, Mg2+, Al3+, and Fe3+), which resulted in an increased sorption
capacity (Wang et al. 2013). The same phenomena was investigated by Jin et al.
(2014) using biochar derived from plant and manure to remove phenanthrene and
dibutyl phthalate in the presence of Cd2+, which resulted in an increased adsorption
capacity (Jin et al. 2014).
A low-cost biochar was produced from crab shell through a simple pyrolysis
without any modiﬁcation. It showed an adsorption capacity of >2000 mg g1 to
15
Application of Biochar for Removal of Heavy Metals, Pathogens, and. . .

anionic Congo red and >1200 mg g1 to cationic malachite green dyes. Removal
was mainly attributed to hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and π-π interac-
tion (Dai et al. 2018).
15.3
Biochar Disposal
Despite the fact that biochar applications to wastewater treatment have numerous
advantages, some of these applications may produce undesirable results which must
be taken into consideration, such as the phytotoxicity observed by Gell et al. (2011)
in greenery vegetables exposed to biochar produced from pig co-digestate, which
presented high soluble salt content and organic compounds. Beesley et al. (2015)
reported a decrease on tomato germination rates when orchard prune biochar content
was increased on nutrient solution given to the plants. These ﬁndings indicate that
biochar may be toxic by itself when used in high doses and that this toxicity could be
potentialized by compounds immobilized in it after application on a treatment
process (Beesley et al. 2015).
Additionally, it is important to remember that, after application, all the
contaminants are concentrated on the biochar material, which makes correct disposal
a very important issue. Biochar used to remove nutrients such as ammonium, nitrate,
and phosphate from wastewater without heavy metals could be used in soil for
fertilization purposes (Tan et al. 2015). However, further studies are required to
understand its effects on soil natural biota, erosion, as well as biochar spreading and
environmental health over time (Montanarella and Lugato 2013).
Considering contaminant desorption possibility, some studies have been
conducted aiming to evaluate the possibility of “cleaning” biochar and its reuse on
subsequent removal processes. Successful results have been observed on the
removal of uranium and dyes by washing cycles with HCl and ethanol, respectively,
from food waste biochar (Tan et al. 2015). There have also been studies on the
regeneration of biochar by heat treatment at 100–300 C to recuperate the surface
capacity of adsorption (Zeng et al. 2021). Nevertheless, it is important to evaluate the
economic feasibility of such cleaning processes, given that there is a wide range of
materials from which biochar can be produced (Tan et al. 2015).
In general, the safe disposal of biochar is not completely established, and proper
legislation needs to be written, as the contaminants present on used biochar are of
special concern (Tan et al. 2015). EU regulations recommend that, in the absence of
proper regulation, biochar not originated from pyrolysis processes should be consid-
ered waste and be managed according to waste protocols, such as those applied to
sewage sludge (Montanarella and Lugato 2013).

Conclusion
This review showed many studies where the modiﬁcation of pyrolysis conditions
produced important changes on biochar characteristics and also the differences that
can be observed when different types of feedstock are used to produce it. Results
showed biochar as a viable and effective option to improve environmental quality by
removing harmful contaminants.
Full-scale biochar application will be consolidated in a near future, and conse-
quently, the industry of biochar production will be established in the circular
economy concept. However, it is important to highlight the need of constant
monitoring of wastewater after treatment with biochar, once that changes on the
load of contaminants present in the wastewater can inﬂuence the efﬁciency of the
process.
As for large-scale industries of biochar production, further studies are needed to
evaluate the economic feasibility of the process, for a successful procedure should
harmonically associate environmental and economic investments.

A Unique Collaborative Perspective
on the Utilisation of Biochar in Accelerated
Biodegradation of Discharge from Factories 16
Anwesha Bhattacharjee and Subhasish Dutta
Abstract
Nowadays, discharge from the factories is an environmental hazard for the
aquatic ﬂora and fauna due to rapid industrialisation. The primary components
of industrial efﬂuents are heavy metals, lubricants, surfactants, tannery efﬂuents,
minerals, etc., which causes biomagniﬁcation within aquatic life. However,
utilisation of biochar has proved to be very useful, sustainable and eco-friendly
compared with other rheological processes. The present book chapter mainly
focuses on various synergistic perspectives of biochar for effective biodegrada-
tion of industrial efﬂuents. Emphasis has also been given on the use of plant
endophytes like Brachiaria mutica along with speciﬁc bacterial stain for the
bioremediation of tannery efﬂuents showing the reduction of 94% BOD
(biological oxygen demand). Hence, the use of biochar could turn out to be an
excellent remedy for treating the industrial efﬂuents due to its eco-friendly
behaviour, which enhances soil fertility, thus stimulating the growth of the plants.

16.1
Introduction
Since past few years of industrialisation, efﬂuents from the factories are really an
environmental hazard for the aquatic life. The toxic chemicals present in the efﬂuents
enter the food chain of the aquatic biota resulting in biomagniﬁcation or
bioampliﬁcation in the food chain. Biomagniﬁcation is basically the increase in
the concentration of the toxin in the tissues of organisms at successively higher
levels. So in order to overcome this dreadful situation, biochar proves to be an
eco-friendly and sustainable remedy compared with other rheological or chemical
processes, because the inherent properties of biochar make it suitable for recovering
the nutrients from the efﬂuents or discharge from factories. Biochar is nothing but a
dense solid carbon, which is basically produced via the pyrolysis of organic
materials that occurs spontaneously at temperatures usually below 700 C. Now
when this biochar undergoes thermal degradation, it basically yields liquid bio-oil,
tars, gaseous syngas and solid char. Since most of the industrial efﬂuents often
contains heavy metals like Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II), they are traditionally
eliminated by some or the other rheological or physicochemical processes like
adsorption and chemical precipitation, but it doesn’t produce any valorisable prod-
uct, and these methods are very much exorbitant. So in this case, interaction between
biochar and certain kinds of microalgae and macroalgae proves to be very beneﬁcial
for removing heavy metal ions present in the efﬂuents. Now, some additional
advantages that were also mentioned by some of the researchers are that they had
possibly lower executing expenses, the soaring efﬁcaciousness in rectifying heavy
metals that were present in lesser concentration, and it required less quantity of
biosorbent that were actually worthless (He and Chen 2014). Now among the
industrial efﬂuents, tannery is one of the leading causes for degrading the quality
of water due to the increase in the level of BOD (biological oxygen demand).
Hence, plant-endophyte synergism in a constructed wetland can help in the
bioremediation of such kind of tannery efﬂuents. In order to utilise the natural
processes in a more controlled environment, certain kind of specialised systems
called constructed wetlands are established. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, treatment of
wastewater in constructed wetlands was characterised in many ways, for example,
treatment of speciﬁc compounds present in wastewaters and identiﬁcation of certain
kind of bacteria, which assisted in the treatment processes as mentioned by scientist
(Vymazal 2011). Since plants interact with a lot of microbial communities, some of
them reside in the plant tissues without having any negative impact on the plant that
they have mutualistic relationship. The word ‘endophyte’ means ‘inner’, and ‘phy-
ton’ means ‘plant’ by Puri (2020). Endophytes seem promising in increase the rate of
crop yield, producing ﬁxed nitrogen or novel substances, inhibiting pathogens as
pointed out by scientists (Rosenblueth and Martínez-Romero 2006). So basically in
some constructed wetlands, the efﬂuents are passed, and with it, some speciﬁc
bacteria or fungi are also inoculated to help the plants to combat the toxicity of the
pollutants present in the efﬂuents as described by some of the researchers (Yousaf
et al. 2010; Desta et al. 2014; Mitter et al. 2013; Ijaz et al. 2016). Here, plants provide
nourishment for the bacterial growth, and in return, bacteria detoxify the harmful
346

pollutants present in the efﬂuents. But the wastewater treatment in the tannery
industries experiences frequent problems but they are often dealing with adequacy
due to poor plan or to expand production (Calheiros et al. (2007). So the choice of
plants and the bacteria is also an important issue because they should have the
potential to survive in the toxic effects of the efﬂuents. Therefore, in this book
chapter, an effort has been made in discussing the various synergistic perspectives
for bioremediation of the industrial efﬂuents by using biochar and microbes.
16.2
Biochar and Its Uses
The word ‘biochar’ is obtained from the Greek word ‘bios’, which means ‘life’, and
‘char’, which means ‘charcoal’. So basically, biochar is nothing but a charcoal that is
generated via the pyrolysis of biomass in the absence of oxygen and is used for
improving the soil quality and carbon sequestration. During ancient period, biochar
was produced from smouldered agricultural offscourings in the pits by the
Pre-Columbians Amazonians. Biochar plays a great role in inﬂuencing the density,
porosity, particle-size distribution and the texture of the soil. In other words, we can
tell that biochar plays a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing the physical nature of the soil.
Now, biochar is manufactured via the pyrolysis of biomass at a temperature
below 700 C. During pyrolysis, most of the mass is lost in the volatile form, and
due to this, there is a reduction in the volume. But the physical features of the biochar
depend not only upon the biomass but also on the pyrolysis (i.e., pre- and post-
management of biochar and biomass) and also on carbonisation. Now, certain
processing condition can result in sintering (or fusion of ashes), which causes a
drastic change in the structural composition of biochar. Scientists Wildman and
Derbyshire (1991) found that the presence of leftover cellular framework of botani-
cal origin that was identiﬁed in biochar of coals and woods causes the macroporosity
in the biochar.
Heating rate, temperature and residence are some of the factors in pyrolysis on
which the speciﬁc yield depends. At temperature around 400–500 C, more char is
produced, but when the temperature is above 700 C, then in most of the cases, liquid
and gas fuel components are produced. In such cases, 20% biochar, 20% syngas, and
60% bio-oils are produced. But when slow pyrolysis occurs, then more amount of
char is produced (approximately 35%), which contributes in the soil fertility of Terra
preta. Terra preta is a fertile, anthropogenic and dark soil, which is basically found in
the amazon basin. It gets its characteristics dark colour due to the weathered charcoal
content present in it. It is usually made on addition of a mixture of compost, bone,
charcoal, etc. Researchers Lehmann and Joseph (2015) and Sohi et al. (2010) said
that the ‘Terra Preta De Indio’ has stable organic matter (OM) in higher content and
has higher pH and excellent crop productivity compared to other low fertile soils. So
certain biochar production techniques like centralised and decentralised, and
thermocatalytic degradation serves as an efﬁcacious way for waste management
and increases the efﬁciency of resources in the bioeconomy. In a centralised system,
for processing of biochar, all the biomass is brought to a central plant, and then, the
16

lower tech kiln is operated. Then, a pyrolyser is put on a vehicle or a truck so that it
could be carried from place to place for pyrolysing the biomass. Pennisetum
purpureum Schum. or napier grass is phenomenally efﬁcient for the atmospheric
CO2 ﬁxation and generating biomass around 60 t ha1 in a very short period of time
according to researchers Rafaela et al. (2016). In case of thermocatalytic
depolymerisation, the organic matter is converted to biochar by using microwaves.
On an industrial scale, approximately 50% char is produced.
Now, there are several methods for producing biochar other than the pyrolysis. So
some of the methods of biochar production are as follows:
16.2.1 Hydrothermal Carbonisation
In hydrothermal carbonisation process, the biomass is kept in a closed reactor, and
then, it is mixed with water. Now, in order to maintain the stability, the temperature
is gradually increased. The biochar, which is formed at a temperature less than
250 C, is called hydrothermal carbonisation, and hydrothermal liquefaction is the
bio-oil formed within 250–400 C temperature. At a temperature beyond 400 C,
some gaseous products like CH4, CO, H2 and CO2 are formed, which is called
hydrothermal gasiﬁcation (Khorram et al. 2016). Then the hydrolysed product goes
through a sequence of reactions like isomerisation, desiccation and fractionation. At
last,
the char is prepared
by cross-linking
of the intermediates and its
repolymerisation.
16.2.2 Gasification
Gasiﬁcation is the process of degradation of the carbonaceous material to syngas. In
this process, the temperature of the reaction is a very important factor for deciding
the syngas production. Researchers found that production of hydrogen and carbon
monoxide increased as soon as the temperature increased but other components like
carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and methane depleted. Now, gasiﬁcation includes
certain processes like drying where the moisture is fully evaporated from biomass
without the recovery of energy. Another process is oxidation and combustion. The
important sources of energy are the combustion and oxidation reactions of the
gasiﬁcation agents. So carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water are produced
when gasiﬁcation agents react with combustible agents.
16.2.3 Torrefaction
Torrefaction procedure is also called as mild pyrolysis due to low heating rate. This
process changes some of the characteristics of biomass like energy density, heating
rate, particle size and surface area. There are several types of torrefaction such as in
steam torrefaction, the biomass is treated with steam around 260 C temperature and
348
A. Bhattacharjee and S. Dutta

10 min of residence time. But in case of wet torrefaction and oxidative torrefaction,
the former biomass is treated with water at 180–260 C, and in case of the latter one,
the biomass is treated with certain kind of oxidising agents like gases used in
combustion.
The several uses of biochar are as follows:
16.2.3.1 Biochar as a Soil Conditioner
In certain regions, the quality of soil is so poor that they are not suitable for crop
cultivation. On applying untreated biochar, it has shown a positive effects by
increasing the soil fertility. It helps the soil by increasing the water holding capacity
and release of vital nutrients by increasing the pH of the soil.
16.2.3.2 Biochar as a Catalyst
Biochar has certain characteristics, which makes it suitable as an excellent catalyst.
First of all, biochar has a greater surface area for the catalytic activity as many
functional groups are present on it. For example, ketone groups are suitable for the
adsorption of ammonium ions. So as a catalyst, it has various applications like
production of syngas and tar removal.
16.2.3.3 Biochar in Wastewater Treatment
Since biochar is very much porous due to this property, it makes a very good
substitute for treating the wastewater. As biochar has high adsorption capacity and
greater porosity; it allows the poisons to cluster on its surfaces making the efﬂuent
clean.
16.2.3.4 Biochar Used as an Insulation in the Buildings
Since the thermal conductivity in biochar is very nominal, so it has greater water
absorption capacity. Due to these characteristics, it acts as a perfect material for
insulating the buildings and controlling the humidity. It also prevents air condensing
and wetness on the wall.
16.2.3.5 Use of Biochar in Conservation of Food
Biochar prevents the post-ripening of fruits and vegetables by absorbing. It can act as
an excellent packaging stuff for packaging of food. It absorbs humidity, thus
preventing the growth of fungus in the food.
16.3
Various Synergistic Methods for Bioremediation
of Industrial Effluents
As we know, industrial efﬂuents are contaminated with toxic chemicals and heavy
metals. So instead of using expensive wastewater treatment, we can use various
synergistic methods for treating industrial efﬂuents. Synergism is basically the
cooperation between two or more organisms, which produces a collaborating effect
16
A Unique Collaborative Perspective on the Utilisation of Biochar in. . .
349

greater than the summation of individual effects. So some of the synergistic methods
are as follows:
16.3.1 Fungi–Bacteria Synergism for Treating Reactive Red X-3B Dye
in the Effluents
The most important constituent in the efﬂuents of textile industries are dyes, and
nowadays, a large number of dyes and certain kind of chemical are used for
producing quality products, but this has really created a havoc in our environment.
But these dyes could be identiﬁed visually. Since most of the dyes used in textile
industries have an intricate aromatic structure, due to the cleavage of the azo groups,
the non-ionic and anionic azo dyes release certain toxic amines, which is resistant to
light or any kind of biological activity. Since most of the industrial efﬂuents are
highly alkaline, it has greater BOD (biological oxygen demand) and TDS (total
dissolved solids). So the textile dye wastewater could be treated by microbial
decolourisation process, and this method is eventually very cost-effective. It was
found that fungus had substantiated to be an appropriate organism for removing dyes
and treating the textile wastewater. One additional beneﬁt of fungal mycelia over
unicellular organisms is that by producing extracellular enzymes, it solubilises the
insoluble substrates. Fungus has substantial enzymatic and physical contact with the
environment due to an increased cell-to-surface ratios (Kaushik and Malik 2009).
The extracellular nature of fungal enzymes has several beneﬁts like it can endure
high concentration of the toxicants. Scientist (Hatakka 1994) found that in order to
endure the toxicity of dyes, fungi produce certain kind of enzymes like manganese
peroxidase and laccase.
The decolourisation mechanism of the reactive red X-3B dye occurring in the
bacteria and the fungi group is attributed to both biodegradation and bioadsorption
(Zhou et al. 2014). For fungi group decolourisation, bioadsorption played a crucial
role because 70% of the decolourisation occurred in just 5 min as told by researchers
(Zhou et al. 2014). For treating this, azo-dye wastewater from textile industries, near
about 15 bacteria and two fungi have been secluded from the activated sludge.
Researchers (Zhou et al. 2014) observed that the 18SrRNA sequence was homolo-
gous to Geotrichum candidum and Candida pseudolambica around 99%, and most
of the 16SrDNA bacterial sequences come under the proteobacteria group, which
include
Sphingobacteriia,
Flavobacteriia,
Bacteroidia,
Nitrospirales
and
Phycisphaerae. Due to the presence of large number of binding sites, the fungi
have greater potential for the adsorption of azo dyes (Fu and Viraraghavan 2002).
But the bacteria group has several other advantages compared with the fungi group
because the biodegradation potential of the bacteria group is much stronger than the
fungi group. The maximum absorption peak of reactive red X-3B dye was obtained
at 538 nm, and when the bacteria started biodegradation, the peak almost got
vanished (Zhou et al. 2014). The other chromogenic groups start originating as
soon as the chromogenic group of X-3B starts splitting. The fungi group has better
bioadsorption potential when it attains equilibrium at 5 min. But the bacteria group
350
A. Bhattacharjee and S. Dutta

undergoes radical biodegradation for decolourisation. So for checking the clustering
or aggregation potential of the microorganisms, the aggregation index is used.
Therefore, for treating azo-dye wastewater, we could see a synergistic relationship
that occurs between the fungi and bacteria group. The former plays a key role in the
separation of biomass and efﬂuent, whereas the latter contributes in improving the
efﬂuent quality.
16.3.2 Algae–Bacterial Synergism for Treating the Effluents of Wine
Factories
One of the major problems faced by most of the wine factories is the mismanage-
ment of large volumes of the efﬂuents produced by the factories. Since most of the
wastewater from wine factories has high amount of organic materials, lower pH and
salinity of the water are variable, which poses a threat to the environment.
According to a recent study, it was found that most of the efﬂuents from wine
factories were rich in certain sugars (like maltose and fructose), organic acids (like
tartaric acid and malic acid), esters, ethanol, etc. The organic substances in winery
efﬂuent mainly come from the wine material and grapes. In addition to this, winery
efﬂuents also contain sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium ions. So due to
the presence of organic and inorganic substances in the winery efﬂuents, it becomes
a bit difﬁcult for treating winery wastewater. Now, there are various methods for
treating this efﬂuent, and some of them are physicochemical method, ion exchange
method, biological method, etc. In physicochemical method, at ﬁrst, the large solid
substances like leaves and grape seeds get settled down; this step is very useful; it
basically impedes other treatment machineries from being obstructed by these solid
substances. But in ion-exchange method, ions are basically exchanged between the
immobilised resin and solution. Now comes the biological treatment; it is very
effective for treating winery wastewater as most of the organic substances present
in the efﬂuent are easily biodegradable. The consequences of culturing green algae
with the native winery efﬂuent abolishes nutrient pollutants and chemical oxygen
demand (COD) from the efﬂuents. The microbial community utilises the remaining
organic substances, for example, the photosynthate that is secreted by the green
algae. The photosynthate that is secreted by the algae assists the growth of the
bacteria, which expands the bacterial population size. So here two strains of green
algae that is Auxenochlorella protothecoides and Chlorella sorokiniana are cultured
in a photobioreactor containing the sterile-ﬁltered winery wastewater collected at
different grape crush season (Higgins et al. 2015).
It was found that both the algae, which were cultured in the sterile-ﬁltered
wastewater medium, had the efﬁciency of removing nitrogen more than 90%. And
more than 50% of phosphate was removed effectively. The detectable phosphate and
nitrogen could easily be eliminated from the post-crush and pre-crush wastewaters
from the wine factories with the help of Chlorella sorokiniana in just 4 days,
whereas an elevation in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was found in the post-
crush and pre-crush wastewaters after the Auxenochlorella protothecoides (algae)
16

were grown in the sterile-ﬁltered winery wastewater. After the experiment, it was
found that the bacterial community was proﬁcient in consuming the photosynthate
produced by the algae A. protothecoides. There was a deterioration in the growth of
Chlorella sorokiniana around 23% due to the existence of bacterial cells in raw
efﬂuents, but it had no impact on the growth of Auxenochlorella protothecoides
compared with sterile ﬁltered wastewater. Now there were plenty of Bacteroidetes,
but actinobacteria was greater than the bioreactor-adapted community in the absence
of algae when Auxenochlorella protothecoides cultured in wastewater with the
bacterial community. So algal photosynthate endows organic substances in the
wastewater, and the bacterial community lowers the chemical oxygen demand
(COD) loads. The photosynthate secreted by the alga delivers organic carbon that
assists the growth of the bacteria. So in other words, we can say that the bacterial
community and algae are reconcilable with each other.
16.4
Constructed Wetland and Its Functioning for Treating
the Effluents from Factories
Constructed wetlands are specially designed systems, which are built to use the
natural processes like soil and microbial accumulation for the treatment of wastewa-
ter in a regulated environment. Besides wastewater treatment, the constructed
wetlands have many objectives like it enhances the biodiversity and improves the
quality of river water. Wetlands gives many ecological beneﬁts to the human
community. Constructed wetlands take the help of natural processes to eradicate
pollutants from the wastewater without using chemicals. In fact, constructed
wetlands are very eco-friendly and cost-effective.
Now, the most essential designing parameters on which the design of constructed
wetlands depends are hydrology, macrophytic growth and ﬂow direction (Vymazal
2011). Under hydrology comes (subsurface ﬂow and open surface ﬂow). Free
ﬂoating, submerged and emergent comes under the category of macrophytic growth.
According to the direction of ﬂow inside the constructed wetland, it can be vertical or
horizontal. So the types of constructed wetland are given below:
16.4.1 Free Water Surface Constructed Wetlands (FWS)
They are also called as wetland with surface ﬂow. Many ﬂoating, emergent and
submerged plants are found in areas having open water (Kadlec 2009). Researchers
Crites et al. (2006) said that due to the presence of plant stalks, less velocity of water
ﬂow and litter controls the ﬂow of the water in narrow channels, which actually
assures the plug-ﬂow conditions. Low depth of the water also assures the plug-ﬂow
condition. Now basically the FWS (free water surface) constructed wetlands permits
the wastewater to ﬂow above ground so that it could be exposed to sunlight. These
beds are usually planted with aquatic ﬂora. Now when the wastewater ﬂows through
the wetland, it goes through various proceedings like biological, chemical and
352
A. Bhattacharjee and S. Dutta

physical proceedings. Here, the organic substances undergo biodegradation, certain
solids are ﬁltered, and nutrients are also removed from the water. In this type of
wetlands, the microbes degrade the organic substances in a very efﬁcacious manner,
and suspended solid substances are removed with the help of sedimentation and
ﬁltration. Scientist (Vymazal 2011) told that with the help of nitriﬁcation in the
aerobic region of the water column, the ammonia is efﬁcaciously removed. Here, the
nitrate undergoes denitriﬁcation in the anaerobic region of the litter layer presented
below for the removal of ammonia. Now the FWS (free water surface) constructed
wetlands have several merits such as it does not require any electrical energy, the
operational cost is very less, and BOD (biological oxygen demand) of wastewater is
eliminated at a higher rate. But there are several demerits of this wetland such as the
open surface facilitates the breeding ground for the mosquitoes, large area of land is
needed, and the rate of elimination process can be slowed down to ice formation in
winter.
16.4.2 Horizontal Subsurface Flow Systems
In such kind of constructed wetland, the water column is directly not exposed to the
atmosphere, and the wetland is generally saturated. Scientist Jan Vymazal (2011)
told that the wastewater is fed at the inlet, and at a very slow pace, the wastewater
moves through the porous medium under the bed surface where emergent vegetation
is planted to the outlet. Now most of the bed is anaerobic or anoxic because the
saturation of the bed is durable, but the aerobic region is basically found around the
rhizomes, which leak oxygen into substrate. This type of wetlands has the ﬁltration
bed, which provides high resistance during the winter season. In horizontal subsur-
face ﬂow constructed wetland (HFCW), basically, the municipal wastewater
undergoes the secondary treatment. This type of wetlands is very much efﬁcient in
the elimination of suspended solids, heavy metals, etc. Scientists Brix (1990) and
Vymazal and Kröpfelová (2008) found that the anaerobic process imparts a vital role
in horizontal subsurface ﬂow constructed wetland (HFCW), but the oxygen transport
capacity present in the system is inadequate to establish the aerobic decomposition.
The oxygen from air is basically transferred through the leaves and stems of
plants in rhizosphere in the presence of an aerobic–anoxic microcosm (Brix and
Schierup 1990). Now the horizontal subsurface ﬂow constructed wetlands have
several advantages such as this type of wetlands does not require any electric
power, the ﬂow of wastewater is assisted by the gravity, the maintenance cost is
very less, they require very less surface area, and these type of wetlands can treat the
diluted wastewaters from the wastewaters, which cannot be treated using the tradi-
tional wastewater treatment technologies. But in the inlet region, there are high
chances of obstruction, which is a major drawback in this type of constructed
wetland systems.

16.4.3 Vertical Flow Systems
In these type of constructed wetland, it basically consists of a ﬂatbed on which
graded gravels are kept, and it is covered with sand on which the macrophytes are
planted. Scientist Jan Vymazal (2011) said that this type of constructed wetland has
large batches, which are fed at irregular intervals, thus ﬂooding of the surface takes
place. Here, the wastewater enters the bed through seepage, and at the bottom, there
is a drainage system where the water gets accumulated. In this system, the suspended
solids and organic substances are removed in larger amount. The vertical ﬂow
system needs very less surface area around 1–3 m2 PE1 (Cooper 2005). Researcher
(Vymazal and Kröpfelová 2008) said that for treating sewage, industrial efﬂuents
and run-off storm water, generally VFCW, are used. In case of tidal ﬂow systems,
with the help of aeration pipes, the water is brought to the bottom, then the water
percolates in upper direction till the surface is ﬂooded. The pump automatically gets
turn off when the surface is fully ﬂooded and the wastewater in the bed comes in
contact with certain kind of microbes, which grows in that medium. Then the water
is drained after a certain time interval. The ﬁltration substrates get obstructed in
vertical ﬂow constructed wetland, which is a major drawback in this type of
wetlands.
The constructed wetland undergoes various kinds of processes like sedimenta-
tion, precipitation, sorption and microbial degradation for the elimination of toxic
pollutants from the wastewater. The ﬁgure of constructed wetland showing various
kinds of processes is shown below (Fig. 16.1):
Fig. 16.1 A simpliﬁed ﬁgure of constructed wetland [http://www.courses.online.org]
354
A. Bhattacharjee and S. Dutta

The solid pollutants in constructed wetlands are eliminated by various physical
processes such as ﬁltration and sedimentation. The inlet zone of horizontal subsur-
face ﬂow system and vertical ﬂow system undergoes the elimination of solid
pollutants. The organic pollutants are hydrolysed into simpler substrates, which
are later absorbed by the facultative and anaerobic bacteria. The heavy metals in
constructed wetlands are removed by metal sulphides precipitation in anaerobic
environment. Nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation are some of the major processes for
the elimination of nitrogen from wastewater in constructed wetland. Nitriﬁcation is
the process in which the ammonia is oxidised to nitrite and nitrate in presence of
certain kind of autotrophic bacteria. It is basically an aerobic process. In vertical ﬂow
constructed wetlands, oxidation of ammonia into nitrate is mainly dependent on the
organic surface loads. In the tidal ﬂow constructed wetlands when the wetland cells
are completely ﬂooded, then adsorption of ammonium ions takes place in the pores
and matrix. Some other nitrogen elimination processes include volatilisation, nitrate
dissimilatory reduction and assimilation of the biomass. Volatilisation is the process
in which the dissolved substances changes to vapour. Plants play a crucial role in
constructed wetlands. The wetland plants enhance the elimination of the nutrients. It
transforms the nutrients into gaseous forms. So this shows that constructed wetlands
are very effective in treating wastewater from dairy industries, food factories, wine
factories and various kinds of other industries. The most amazing feature of
constructed wetland is that it can work in any kind of weather conditions if the
wetlands are designed in a proper way. So for treating industrial efﬂuents or
wastewater, these sustainable systems can replace many expensive technologies.
16.5
Plant-Endophyte Synergism: A Boon for Treating
Industrial Effluents
As the world develops, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation increases the release
of many toxic chemicals, which are dumped into the water bodies, thus hampering
the aquatic biota. However, constructed wetlands have been proved very effective in
treating the industrial efﬂuents and improving the quality of contaminated water as it
was discussed earlier. But vegetation choice, which is done according to the nature
of the wastewater and climatic condition in a particular area, plays a crucial role in
building a constructed wetland. It was found that efﬂuents from the tannery
industries are one of the main causes for the contamination of water. Moreover,
when plant-endophyte synergism was established in a constructed wetland, it
decontaminates the tannery efﬂuents very effectively. Endophytes are basically the
endosymbiont, which is often a fungi or a bacteria that resides inside the stems or
leaves of a plant without causing any negative impact on the plant. They are often
called as mycorrhizal fungi because they possess an external hyphae, which arises
from the soil and surrounds the infected tips of the roots of the plants. According to
scientist, Puri (2020) many endophytic bacteria, for example, Pseudomonas, Bacil-
lus and Azospirillum, belong to the soil bacterial genera.
16

355

So here we would basically discuss the plant endophytic synergism between plant
Brachiaria
mutica
and
the
endophytic
bacterial
strains
(Microbacterium
arborescens HU33, Pantoea stewartii ASI11 and Enterobacter sp. HU38) in a
vertical ﬂow constructed wetland. Brachiaria mutica is commonly known as buffalo
grass, which is generally found in central Africa and parts of middle east where it is
generally cultivated for the fodder for ruminant animals. It is basically a monocot
plant and it belongs to the family Poaceae. Buffalo grass or Brachiaria mutica is a
perennial grass in which the creeping stolons can reach up to a height of 5 m. The
nodes found in the stem are a bit hairy. The bacteria Pantoea stewartii is a gram-
negative bacteria. The shape of the bacteria is rod shape. It belongs to the phylum
Proteobacteria and family Enterobacteriaceae. But Enterobacter sp. HU38 is also a
gram-negative bacteria. It is a rod-shaped bacterium, but it does not form spores.
This bacteria also belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
At ﬁrst, the sample tannery efﬂuent was collected from the major sewerage of
tannery industry. The efﬂuent contained Cr, Cu, Pb, Cd and Ni in higher amount. It
also contained higher amounts of ammonia, nitrate, sulphide, chloride, phosphate,
etc. So for treating this efﬂuent, the vertical ﬂow constructed wetlands were built in a
small scale. According to researchers Ashraf et al. (2018), the wetlands were covered
with a layer of pebbles, sand and loamy soil on top of it as shown in (Fig. 16.2). All
these materials were placed one after another in a netted basket. Then approximately
hundred number of stem cuttings of buffalo grass or Brachiaria mutica were cut
(at least having one node in each stem) and grown in soil and then placed in certain
containers, which were ﬁlled by tap water so that they were well-rooted. Since there
were 12 systems of vertical ﬂow constructed wetland. These systems were divided
by four different treatments in which treatment 1 includes well-rooted Brachiaria
mutica plants provided with tap water; treatment 2 includes Brachiaria mutica plants
provided with tannery efﬂuent; treatment 3 includes Brachiaria mutica plants having
bacterial inoculation, which were provided with tannery efﬂuent; treatment
4 includes Brachiaria mutica plants without bacterial inoculation and was provided
with tannery efﬂuent as performed by the researchers Ashraf et al. (2018). Regula-
tion of the constructed wetlands was done batch wise so that each of the wetlands
was subjected to tannery wastewater (after 27 days). Then root and shoot length of
buffalo grasses were measured. As described by the researchers. Yoon et al. (2006)
and Li et al. (2007), the translocation factor or (TF) is basically the ratio of heavy
metals detected in the shoot of the plants divided by heavy metals detected in the root
of the plants. It was found that in the presence of the endophytes, Brachiaria mutica
or buffalo grass showed signiﬁcant increase in growth in contrast to plants growing
in other constructed wetlands. Although in case of second treatment, an upgradation
was found in the quality of tannery efﬂuents in constructed wetlands when buffalo
grasses vegetated. But in case of third treatment when the Brachiaria mutica plants
were inoculated with the endophytes in constructed wetland, it exhibited maximum
eradication of the pollutants while minimum elimination of the pollutants were
found in the fourth treatment, which didn’t have any bacterial inoculation or
Brachiaria mutica plants.
356
A. Bhattacharjee and S. Dutta

So this proves that the Brachiaria mutica plant and the endophytic bacteria
experiences a symbiotic relationship. In a symbiotic relationship, plants provide
nourishment and habitation to the endophytic bacteria but in return the endophytic
bacteria degrade the harmful pollutants present in the tannery efﬂuents and take care
of the plant’s health. Researchers Ashraf et al. (2018) found that the depletion of
chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) was highest
in case of third treatment. The COD and BOD depletion was around 82 and 94%. In
other words when the organic pollutants in the tannery efﬂuents were depleted, there
was a signiﬁcant increase in the oxygen concentration by the vegetation. In the
vertical ﬂow constructed wetland when the buffalo grass in collaboration with the
endophytic bacteria were vegetated in the wetland, there was larger depletion in
chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD). So, similar
kind of plant-endophyte synergism was also listed in the given table below
(Table 16.1).
Brachiaria mutica was also efﬁcient in the eradication of heavy metals like Cr,
Mn, Ni, Co and Pb that are present in the efﬂuent. The bacteria possess excellent
potential for sorbing metal ions in its cell wall. In other words the availability of
Fig. 16.2 An experimental setup showing Brachiaria mutica treating industrial efﬂuent in a well-
designed constructed wetland (Van Thanh Ho et al. 2020)

357

metal ions by plants is intensiﬁed by the inoculation of bacteria. Maximum uptake of
Cr was found in case of third treatment. It was found that vegetation in collaboration
with the endophytes showed maximum eradication of Cr (around 96%) in the
wetlands. This can also be determined using the bioconcentration factor (BCF),
which shows that a part of the metal ion found in the wastewater shifted to the stems
and roots of the plants collected in larger amounts in the roots.
According to scientists Ashraf et al. (2018), the restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RELP) interpretation showed that most of the bacteria (around
66%) were the members of inoculated endophytes in stems and roots of the plants
of third treatment, but other endophytic bacterial strains were native to the efﬂuent or
Brachiaria mutica. So this proves that plant-endophyte synergism remediates the
tannery wastewater. This is the most eco-friendly method compared to other high-
tech machineries and chemical treatment. In this method, the biodiversity is
maintained. In plant-bacterial synergism, a huge number of bacteria live inside the
rhizosphere of the host plant, and the root and shoot of the plant helps in bacterial
colonisation. So with this method, pollution is controlled, and a balance is
maintained in our ecosystem.
16.6
Conclusion
As we all know, environmental pollutants enter the environment by means of both
artiﬁcial (man-made) or natural sources, which leads to the pollution in water, soil
and air. It degrades the condition of air and wastage of many non-renewable sources
like fossil fuels (Sebiomo et al. 2010; Janbandhu and Fulekar 2011; Prince et al.
2013; Shabir et al. 2013). As we all are so much dependent on the fossil fuels (like
petrol, diesel), due to this reason, it will get exhausted very soon. So for that reason,
we should think for some alternative source of energy, which is cheap, easy to
operate and is eco-friendly. So as we have discussed earlier, biochar can act as a very
good source of energy. As explained by the researchers (El-Naggar et al. (2019a, b);
Hu et al. 2017), the solid biomass mainly contains organic substances, and due to
this, it has tremendous capability to produce biochar. So instead of dumping this

solid waste, we can change it to biochar making a good use out of it. As we have
discussed earlier that biochar has many properties like eradication of some toxic
pollutants from soil, it helps in treating the industrial efﬂuents. Nowadays the
leftover of agricultural products like wheat straw are used to make biochar as
experimented by researchers (Qian et al. 2019). Scientists (Yargicoglu et al. 2015)
found that waste wood could also be used to make biochar. Corn cob was also used
by the scientists to prepare the biochar as done by (Duan et al. 2019). So biochar
appears as a promising alternative for the eradication of many toxic pollutants from
the environment.
As we have also discussed, constructed wetlands are efﬁcient in the elimination of
pollutants from the industrial efﬂuents. It is efﬁcient in removing the pathogens from
the wastewater. In other, words we can say that it is a kind of bioﬁlter. Since it is a
self-sustaining system, so it is very easy to operate, and the cost is very low. It uses
the natural functions like soil, plants and microbes for treating the wastewater. As we
have seen, certain factories discharge their wastewater directly into the bodies of
water, which, really disturbs the aquatic ecosystem, so instead of doing that, if these
efﬂuents are discharged in respective engineered systems like constructed wetland,
the water pollution (which is a burning problem for our environment) could be
prevented easily. It was proved that the plant-endophyte synergism increased the
efﬁciency of constructed wetland. It is totally eco-friendly. The plants provide
habitation and nourishment to the endophytes so that the endophytes could grow
properly, and in return, the endophytes degrade the toxic pollutants in the wastewa-
ter, which could hamper the health of the plants.
So constructed wetland with plant-endophyte synergism seems to be a promising
technique for eradication of pollutants from the industrial efﬂuents, thus preventing
the water from being polluted. Therefore, the balance in our ecosystem is also
maintained.

Abstract
The issues of wastewater containing different contaminants are insurmountable,
as they cause major threats to aquatic ecosystems. The stages of treatment
technologies may consist of or a combination of chemical, biological, or physical
processes, depending on the wastewater characteristics, the climate, and the
resources available. Among all, due to its simple operation in high volume with
high performance, easy to functional sorbent preparation and reuse, the removal
of contaminants by adsorption gains more interest. Biochar, a durable, low-cost
carbon-rich material, is a promising agent for evacuating various organic and
inorganic pollutants in wastewater due to its high adsorption properties. Func-
tionally modiﬁed surface biochar is currently being developed to improve its
ability to remove contaminants in wastewater and other bioremediation
applications. This chapter offers clear information about the wastewater treatment
process using biochar and knowledge gaps in biochar-based remediation of
wastewater.

Introduction
An increase in population growth causes the demand for limited resources like water
and affects the environment and aquatic system. In order to resolve this problem,
wastewater from various human activities such as pharmaceutical, leather, tanning,
pulp and paper industry, kitchen, agriculture, mining, and cosmetics is treated and
used for various applications. Wastewater can be classiﬁed into three categories:
1. Domestic wastewater or municipal wastewater: Wastewater discharged from
institutions, residences, and similar facilities. It is classiﬁed into gray water, such
as liquid waste from the bathroom, laundry, and kitchen, and black water, such as
wastewater discharged from the toilet.
2. Industrial wastewater: Wastewater discharged from factories and production
units.
3. Stormwater runoff: Resulting from ﬂood due to rainfall that enters the sewer
system.
Recent studies explain that nearly 1.1 billion people starve for clean drinking
water due to water contamination. Industries release wastewater containing many
organic pollutants like chemicals, phosphorus, nitrates, pathogens, dyes, and inor-
ganic pollutants as heavy metals such as Cu, Cd, Ni, and Pb. There are two types of
pollutants: (1) primary pollutants such as CO2 and NO2 directly affect the environ-
ment, and (2) secondary pollutants are acid rain and global warming caused due to
primary pollutants (Sörme and Lagerkvist 2002; Tahir et al. 2020). Wastewater
characteristics are varying upon its source, and some wastewater does not need
pretreatment to remove contaminants. Understanding the characteristics of waste-
water is a critical step in properly managing it. Physical, chemical, and biological
features of wastewater are the most common classiﬁcations. Total dissolved solids,
suspended solids, electrical conductivity, temperature, and color are all physical
characteristics. Dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD),
biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrogen, and phosphorus are chemical
characteristics, while biological characteristics include microbial population and
biochemical oxygen demand.
Many contaminants present in wastewater are toxic to ﬁshes in the stream and
other aquatic organisms. For example, colorants are used to make an attractive
product used in many industries like plastics, ceramics, cosmetics, and leather
industries. The cosmetics industry uses some chemicals to improve the product,
such as sodium laurel, a surfactant that causes the allergy, rashes, and eye irritation
and affects the immune system. The dye industry using paraphenylenediamine is
364

permanent hair dyes that cause skin irritation and redness. Plants up take some heavy
metals available in wastewater through food chains entering into human and animal
bodies. They cause numerous diseases such as carcinogenic and eye disorders,
mercury such as nervous disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, lethargy, ataxia,
nervous diseases, liver damage, and insomnia (Sörme and Lagerkvist 2002; Burakov
et al. 2018). Casein precipitation from the dairy industry is toxic to ﬁsh, and the
deposited water may lead to mosquito breeding that causes dengue fever, malaria,
chikungunya, and other diseases such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, cancer, typhoid,
giardiasis, amoebiasis, Alzheimer’s disease, respiratory problems, and hepatitis
(Shete and Shinkar 2013).
The number of pollutants and contaminants in water keeps on increasing due to
factories and similar units. To remove these pollutants, speciﬁc treatment methods
are required. Researchers have reported many treatment methods. Those treatment
levels are classiﬁed into four categories. Firstly, pretreatment or preliminary treat-
ment is performed to remove the suspended solids and reduces clogging. Secondly,
primary treatments are subjected to remove suspended inorganic and organic solids
due to gravity, such as ﬂotation and nanoﬁltration. Thirdly, the secondary treatment
is used to remove dissolved solids in primary efﬂuent using methods like membrane
bioreactor, anaerobic ﬁlters, activated sludge processes, coagulation–ﬂocculation,
and chemical precipitation. Finally, the tertiary treatment is used to remove micro-
pollutants using adsorption, reverse osmosis, and distillation techniques.
Recent studies show biochar as the best adsorbent to sorb heavy metals in
wastewater (Pavithra and Jaikumar 2019). Biochar is a carbon-rich product produced
during the thermochemical decomposition of biomass with or without oxygen.
Biochar feedstocks are bamboo wood, pomelo peel, pinewood, paper mill sludge,
rice husk, green waste, peanut shell, marine macroalgae, banana peels, maple wood,
peanut hull, pecan nutshell, cauliﬂower leaves, etc. Physical and chemical
characteristics of biochar depend on the biomass and thermochemical methods
conditions such as temperature, reactor type, and heating rate. Pyrolysis, hydrother-
mal liquefaction, carbonization, gasiﬁcation, and torrefaction are included in
methods of thermochemical decomposition. Temperature is the only difference
between all these processes.
Biochar acts as an adsorbent and has a high potential for sorption of organic and
inorganic substances from the water system. Their great sorption capacity is
associated with porous structure and their functional groups such as hydroxyl and
carboxyl on the surface area. Biochar has various advantages such as effective and
cheap, acts as a fertilizer to increase soil fertility and crop growth, is an eco-friendly
adsorbent, and prevents the discharge of greenhouse gas emissions. It has a strong
afﬁnity for heavy metals (Xiang et al. 2020).

17.2
General Characteristics of Wastewater
Water is a vital natural resource, and wastewater is deﬁned as any water negatively
affected by its quality due to human activities. Water is scarce in most countries, and
hence, it has become mandatory to reuse the wastewater in a productive manner to
replenish the water resources of the country. Wastewater is obtained from domestic,
industrial, commercial, and agricultural activities that contain physical, chemical,
and biological pollutants. Due to the expansion of population at a higher rate, this
wastewater is utilized for irrigation in agriculture. The nutrients and microorganisms
in wastewater conserve valuable water resources by taking advantage of the nutrients
in sewage to grow crops, algae, and bacteria for further application (Rajesh Banu
et al. 2020; Dhandayuthapani et al. 2021). For example, the nitrogen content of
sewage eliminates the requirement of commercial fertilizers in agricultural soil.
Wastewater released into the environment without proper treatment causes water
and soil pollution. Hence, it is very important to know about the characteristics of
wastewater for the effective usage of the wastewater for numerous applications. In
the forthcoming section, some of the common characteristics of wastewater
discharged from various industries are indicated in Table 17.1.
17.2.1 Physical Characteristics
Wastewater has various physical characteristics like color, temperature, solids, oil,
odor, and grease, as listed in Table 17.1. The color in the wastewater is the ﬁrst and
foremost characteristic for indicating the age of wastewater. The color varies based
on the period when it is generated and based on the wastewater source. Freshly
discharged wastewater appears to be gray in color, which on visual appearance looks
black. Industrial efﬂuents take the color of the type of product produced or based on
the industry type. Wastewater from the dairy industry is white in color (Shete and
Shinkar 2013).
In contrast, purple, blue, violet, and black colors are observed in the case of the
textile industry (Chowdhury et al. 2015). Efﬂuent from the tannery industry is in
yellowish-brown color with the average color range at the ﬁrst monitoring point to be
1820  5.5 Platinum–Cobalt Scale (Pt-/Co) units, which were 122 times higher than

the recommended values of standard limits (15 Pt/Co units) (Noukeu et al. 2016).
During alcohol production, residual liquid waste generated is called distillery spent
wash, also called stillage (Piccin et al. 2016). Thus, the color of the wastewater
changes based on the toxicity of the wastewater. In the case of dairy industry
efﬂuent, it is nontoxic, and the leather industry uses several dyes during their
processing, making it more toxic (Bisschops and Spanjers 2003).
The odor is another important criterion for assessing the nature of wastewater.
Gases produced by the decomposition of organic matter cause an offensive odor.
When the sewage waste becomes devoid of oxygen, anaerobic microorganisms
reduce sulfate to sulﬁdes liberating hydrogen sulﬁde gas. Industrial and domestic
wastewater has distinct odor based on the source from which raw material they are
generated. Both decomposing wastewater and industrial wastes are sources of odor.
The temperature of waste products has an abnormal impact on aquatic life,
chemical reaction rate, biological reaction rate, and gas solubility limitations like
element depletion. The mean annual temperature of the waste product depends on
the geographic location, from 10 to 21 C. The high temperature of waste products
will increase undesirable species and fungi, and low temperatures increase the
treatment time and plant size.
The presence of solid content is another notable characteristic of wastewater. The
solids can also be classiﬁed into organic (volatile) and inorganic fractions. In
anaerobic conditions, the suspended solids can lead to sludge deposits in the aquatic
environment when untreated wastewater is discharged. The ﬁltration process is used
to remove these suspended soils from the wastewater. Due to the nutritional avail-
ability in the suspended solids used for various applications (Selvakumar and
Sivashanmugam 2017, 2018a). Wastewater generated in the tanning industry pro-
duced total dissolved solids at 21,300 mg/L concentration and total suspended solids
at a concentration of 1250 mg/L, whereas the limit suggested by WHO is 2100 and
600 mg/L, respectively (Massoudinejad et al. 2015). Cotton textile industry efﬂuent
has total solids of about 28,900–49,300 mg/L because of the sourcing process. Most
of the solid content comes under suspended solids in the wool textile industry with a
concentration of about 1000–26,200 mg/L (Hubbe et al. 2016). The rubber industry
produces wastewater with 560 mg/L where the standard is to be less than 50 mg/L
and in the strict sense not to exceed 150 mg/L (Pillai and Girish 2014).
17.2.2 Chemical Characteristics
Chemical characteristics are determined by different constituents given in Table 17.1
as COD, TOC, pH, and alkalinity, and the amount of certain chemical components
(nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorides, and sulfate contents) is present in the wastewater.

materials present in wastewater, which is the amount of oxygen required to oxidize
both compounds. It is measured by using strong oxidizing agents like potassium
dichromate. The mean chemical oxygen demand of the efﬂuents at different
17

manufacturing units of the tannery industries ranges from 7200  20 to
71,040  40 mg/L, respectively. The tanning and dyeing efﬂuent has a higher
chemical oxygen demand level of 71,040  40 mg/L because of the adding up of
many organic vegetable tanning materials and inorganic chemicals (Piccin et al.
2016). The paper and pulp industry observed the chemical oxygen demand level of
7000 mg/L (Shankar et al. 2014). The chemical oxygen demand of rubber industry
efﬂuent was 5613 mg/L (Pillai and Girish 2014). A higher chemical oxygen demand
level means a greater amount of oxidizable organic material in the sample, which
will reduce dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (Bisschops and Spanjers 2003). A reduc-
tion in dissolved oxygen can cause a harmful effect on higher aquatic life forms.
Therefore, it is mandatory to have a deep understanding of each chemical
characteristics that have several destructive impacts. The pH of the efﬂuent is an
important characteristic of wastewater. The pH of the efﬂuent depends upon the unit
operations or process involved in the industry. The pH of paper and pulp industry
efﬂuent is 11.68; rubber industry mixed efﬂuent is 8.3, whereas efﬂuent of water
boilers is 10.3 and efﬂuent of boiler blowdown is 2.2. The pH values of the efﬂuents
at different leather manufacturing stages ranged from 3.8  0.2 to 12.5  0.5 (Hubbe
et al. 2016; Pillai and Girish 2014). To avoid the harmful impacts of wastewater, the
chemical characteristics have to be properly analyzed before using it for various
purposes.
17.2.3 Biological Characteristics
Biological characteristics of wastewater are mainly determined by the different
organisms that develop in the wastewater like bacteria, fungi, archaea, viruses,
protozoa, algae, and helminths. It also includes biological oxygen demand and the
oxygen necessary for the nitriﬁcation process. The BOD is the amount of oxygen
needed to stabilize organic matter using microorganisms. It is similar to chemical
oxygen demand, but it takes at least 5 days of testing, whereas chemical oxygen
demand can be estimated within 1–2 h. Usually, BOD is estimated at 3 and 5 days,
which gives BOD3 and BOD5, respectively. The mean BOD5 of the efﬂuents at
diverse leather processing industry manufacturing units was in the range of
7200  20 to 71,040  40 mg/L. The higher value, 71,040  40 mg/L, corresponds
to leftover remains, and dyeing efﬂuents were due to the accrual of many organic
vegetable tanning materials and inorganic chemicals (Jahan et al. 2014). In dairy
efﬂuent, the BOD varies from 200 to 3500 mg/L, and rubber industry efﬂuent has
BOD at a level of about 1340 mg/L. The biological oxygen demand level of the
paper mill efﬂuent was 5279 mg/L. The efﬂuent analysis of six different textile
industries shows that the BOD varies from 500 to 1010 mg/L. The biological
characteristics of various sources of water treatment are critically analyzed.

17.3
Different Stages in Wastewater Treatment
The removal of pollutants from the efﬂuent to attain the standard quality of discharge
requires different treatment levels. Here, the solids in wastewater are partially
removed by decomposition from highly complex organic solids to stable organic
solids. Various treatment methods treat those wastewaters. These treatment methods
can be classiﬁed into four types: (1) pretreatment or preliminary treatment, which
includes physical and mechanical processes to remove coarse suspended solids;
(2) primary treatment, which includes physicochemical processes to remove
suspended solids and organic matters such as biological oxygen demand due to
gravity; (3) Secondary treatment or puriﬁcation, which includes biological and
chemical processes to remove soluble biological oxygen demanding primary
waste; and (4) tertiary treatment, which includes physical and chemical processes
for metals ions, dissolved solids, pathogens, and color (Crini and Lichtfouse 2019;
Ullah et al. 2020).
Preliminary treatment is the ﬁrst step in the wastewater treatment process for
removing large and coarse suspended solids in untreated wastewater to reduce large-
sized particles such as plastics, clothes, and wood. To avoid clogging and for easy
operation, grit, grinders and screens are used. Treated wastewater ﬂows to the next
step for primary treatment. Primary treatment is done to remove suspended organic
and inorganic solids by physicochemical processes. This is done after the prelimi-
nary treatment. In this process, wastewater is passed through several tanks and
ﬁlters, including ﬂotation, primary sedimentation tank, neutralization tank, and
equalization tank. Sedimentation, an important process in wastewater treatment
and its operation, depends upon the properties of suspended solids. Sedimentation
tanks are classiﬁed into primary and secondary. Primary sedimentation tank is used
to remove solid deposition and is easy to operate (Shahrokhi et al. 2012). Next,
ﬂoatation is a separation process used to remove suspended solids from the liquid
phase by air bubbles. Mostly dissolved air ﬂotation is used to remove heavy metals,
which require less time, but further treatment must be made to improve removal
efﬁciency. Finally, the neutralization tank utilizes the chemical process to neutralize
or balance pH. It also requires a high cost for chemicals (Zhou et al. 2019; Ullah et al.
2020). The secondary treatment is used to remove the residual organic and
suspended solids in primary efﬂuent by biological and chemical processes. This
organic nutrient-rich sludge is used for different applications, including microbial
cultivation and energy production (Selvakumar and Sivashanmugam 2018b;
Selvakumar et al. 2019). In aerobic processes, membrane bioreactor treatment
removes micropollutants in primary efﬂuent, improving efﬂuent quality. These are
removed from the wastewater with the physical retention technique by membrane,
sorption, biodegradation, and air stripping method.
It has several disadvantages like easily contaminated and expensive, and an
experienced person needs to handle it (Grandclément et al. 2017). Activated sludge
processes are used for the removal of biological oxygen demand in suspended solids.
Lesser removal of pathogen and high power requirement is its limitations. Biological
treatment could not be an effective method for removing efﬂuent in all cases.
17

Therefore, the researchers are using the chemical process rather than biological
treatment. Coagulation–ﬂocculation removes the colloidal particles by adding a
coagulant and ﬂocculant that are formed. It requires lesser time to settle, but the
operational cost is high (Durai and Rajasimman 2011; Crini and Lichtfouse 2019).
Finally, the treated water is transferred to the ﬁnal treatment tank for further
handling.
Tertiary treatment is the ﬁnal step to improving water quality by physical and
chemical methods to reduce organic and inorganic substances such as nitrogen,
phosphorus, and micropollutants in wastewater by ~80%. Adsorption is simple,
which contain both chemical and physical process. Chemisorption is described as
a chemical reaction between the adsorbate and the surface of adsorbents that results
in a covalent or ionic bond formation. Physisorption is the sticking of particles on the
surface through van der Waals’ force. Adsorption has several disadvantages, as
operating and maintenance cost are high as well as deposition of active sites
(Burakov et al. 2018). Distillation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, electrodialysis,
and freeze desalination are ﬁve techniques used to remove soluble solids in water.
Desalination is the method used to remove dissolved minerals from brackish water,
which is an expensive method that requires high energy. Sludge is formed at the end
and is further treated by incineration and recycling (Crini and Lichtfouse 2019; Ullah
et al. 2020).
Although many materials and methods are used for wastewater treatment, the
treatment process aims to ﬁnd the best and efﬁcient method that cleanses the
contaminated environment. Therefore, in this context, to remove wastewater
contaminants from the environment and restore healthy ecosystems, biochar is
gaining importance as a promising agent for wastewater treatment. The carbon-
rich solid product obtained from any biomass is called biochar, differentiated from
charcoal, which possesses large numbers of pores and aromatic functional groups on
its surface (Qambrani et al. 2017; Enaime et al. 2020). Biochar is becoming the best
choice as it has the following advantages: low cost, eco-friendly, easy preparation
methods, availability of raw materials, improved physicochemical properties, and,
most importantly, an effective adsorbent in removing the pollutants from wastewater
(Thompson et al. 2016; Xiang et al. 2020). The application of biochar for different
wastewater treatment along with diverse approaches is discussed in the upcoming
topics.
17.4
Biochar Production and Its Application in Wastewater
Treatment
Biochar is an eco-friendly, low-cost substance produced from organic wastes
(Enaime et al. 2020). Biochar is a carbon-rich solid material obtained by heating
biomass with little or no oxygen (Wei et al. 2018). Based on the type of production
process, application, and general conditions, biochar has many deﬁnitions. Interna-
tional Biochar Initiative (IBI) deﬁnes biochar as a solid material and the thermo-
chemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment called biochar
370
Karthik V. et al.

(Xiang et al. 2020). Biochar has several pores with oxygen functional groups and
aromatic surfaces.
The feedstock used for the production of biochar includes canola straw, cattle
manure, corn straw, hardwood, peanut straw, pine needles, pinewood, rice husk, rice
straw, sewage sludge, soybean straw, Spartina alterniﬂora, sugar beet tailing,
switchgrass, algal biomass, eucalyptus, kenaf ﬁber, maize straw, palm bark, peanut
shells, rice hull, soybean stover, swine manure, wastewater sludges, bamboo wood,
pomelo peel, paper mill sludge, green waste, banana peel, cauliﬂower leaves, maple
wood, pecan nutshell, crab shell, reed, bagasse, sawdust, wheat straw, sugarcane
harvest residue, hickory wood chips, wheat straw, hardwood, willow wood cotton-
wood, and sugar beet tailings. (Tan et al. 2015; Xiang et al. 2020). Different
thermochemical processes, including slow pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization
(HTC), fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), ﬂash carbonization,
torrefaction, and gasiﬁcation, produce the biochar. The operating condition of
these processes also varies. The features of biochar, such as large surface area,
surface functional groups, and porous structure, play an essential role in removing
contaminants from wastewater. Figure 17.1 shows the different contaminants
removed by biochar.

17
Application of Biochar for Wastewater Treatment

17.4.1 Industrial Wastewater Treatment Using Biochar
The common industrial wastewater sources are mining, battery manufacturing,
chemical industry, smelting, dyes, leather manufacturing, etc. The pollutants are
heavy metals and organic pollutants. An effective adsorbent for heavy metals
adsorption is the biochar mixed with chitosan after being cross-linked and cast
into membranes, beads, and solutions. The adsorption of cadmium, copper, arsenic,
lead, and other heavy metals depend on the proportion of biochar and chitosan.
Organic pollutants, heavy metals, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and other pollutants
are mainly removed from the wastewater using biochar (Enaime et al. 2020; Xiang
et al. 2020). For the removal of these pollutants, the biochar act as an excellent
adsorbent. Heavy metals such as arsenic (As), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), nickel
(Ni), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) are mainly present in the wastewater, and the
long-term contact of these heavy metals in water bodies, even in low concentration,
can lead to the serious health effects. Arsenic is a highly noxious heavy metal that is
present in the wastewater. By the impregnation of biochar with Zn(NO3)2, the
adsorption capacity of As3+ is increased from 5.7 to 7.0μg/g in the course of the
surface modiﬁcation.
In dye-based industries, for crystal violet elimination in an aqueous environment,
Gliricidia biochar is efﬁcient biochar. The sorption process depends on the pore
volume, surface area, and pH value of biochar. Organic dyes are another major
contaminant present in the textiles, rubber, paper, and dye industry wastewater.
These contaminants have features like high chemical stability, high color, good
solubility in water, and complex aromatic structure, making it complicated to
decompose naturally. The presence of these organic dyes in water restricts light
and oxygen to enter into the water, affecting the survival of aquatic organisms.
Sewage sludge-derived biochar is used to eliminate the methylene blue dye from the
wastewater, and it shows a maximum adsorption capacity of 29.85 mg/g at pH 7.
The biochar obtained from the algae, Spirulina platensis is used to remove Congo
red (CR) and methylene blue dye. Some phenolic compounds, including phenol,
bisphenol A (BPA), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and p-nitrophenol (PNP) produced
from the paper, plastic synthesis, and also by agricultural activities, are in addition
present in the wastewater as a contaminant. These phenol compounds are detached
from the wastewater through ozonation by using the sludge-derived biochar (Huang
et al. 2019).
In the battery manufacturing industry, efﬂuent bagasse biochar is used to adsorb
lead to a maximum of 12.7 mg/g. The adsorption depends on nominal pH value,
dosage, and contact time. In dairy wastewater, the nutrients of ammonium and
phosphate are recaptured by biochar. The biochar can adsorb 20–43% of ammonium
and 19–65% of phosphate in the exit dairy manure within 24 h.
The biochar produced from the paper mill sludge as a feedstock is mainly used
to remove the As5+ from the wastewater, and it gives maximum efﬁciency of
34.1 mg/g removal. For removing Cd2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+, the biochar prepared
using feedstocks such as sugarcane straw, sawdust, rice husk, and chicken manure
mixed with sawdust are more effective. In this removal, the temperature increase
372

(350–650 C) in pyrolysis leads to the enhancement in the removal capacity of
biochar for removing Cd2+ from wastewater (Xiang et al. 2020). The rice straw
biochar has shown the highest carbon and hydrogen contents, the most signiﬁcant
number of functional groups (i.e., H, C¼C, and C¼O), highest pH, physical
stability, negative surface charge, and adsorption capacity for Pb2+ removal (Enaime
et al. 2020). The removal efﬁciency of fresh and dehydrated banana peel biochar for
removing Pb2+ is 359 and 193 mg/g, respectively (Wei et al. 2018).
17.4.2 Municipal Wastewater Treatment Using Biochar
For municipal wastewater treatment, biochar can be used directly or can be pooled
with bioﬁlter and other technologies to recover nitrogen and phosphorus. Biochar is
a highly porous bioﬁlter and the COD, TKN, TSS, and TP of wastewater lessen by
90, 89, 64, and 78%, respectively, after being passed through it. The biochar laden
with aluminum oxyhydroxides (AlOOH) was useful to recycle and reuse phosphorus
through adsorption by electrostatic attraction, and the phosphorus adsorbed from the
secondary wastewater treatment on the biochar is used as a fertilizer for crop
production (Hussain et al. 2017). To remove ammonium from municipal wastewater,
biochar produced at 450 C from the digested sludge is used as an adsorbent with
higher surface area and functional group density. The process is controlled by
chemisorption.
Biochar from waste sludge shows an elevated elimination rate of the total organic
carbon used as catalysts to ozonate reﬁnery wastewater. It contains functional carbon
groups, Si/O structures, and metallic oxides. It can promote oxidation through the
formation of hydroxyl radicals and mineralized petroleum contaminants. Wastewa-
ter from residential units can be treated with biochar in an on-site sewage treatment
facility (OSSFs). The addition of biochar increases the removal rate of some polar
and hydrophilic compounds and can be upgraded with low-cost biochar adsorbents.
17.4.3 Agricultural Wastewater Treatment Using Biochar
Due to the rapid development of agriculture, pesticides or toxic heavy metals are
released into farmlands. Imidacloprid and atrazine are adsorbed using rice straw
biochar and phosphoric acid tailored rice straw biochar. The pH and pore volume of
soybean and corn straw biochar are important factors in the high adsorption of
imidacloprid and atrazine. Sulfamethane is removed by steam-activated biochar,
and the rate of removal is a function of pH (Zheng et al. 2019). The removal of
pentachlorophenol can be done through zero-valent iron magnetic paper mill sludge
biochar (ZVI-MBC). The biochar feedstock and the functional materials play a
major role in biochar’s adsorption capacity to pesticides.
Pesticides, herbicides, and antibiotics are also the major contaminants in agricul-
tural wastewater, as shown in Fig. 17.1. For removing these contaminants, biochar is
applied based on the interactions (hydrogen bonding, intermolecular, electrostatic,
17
Application of Biochar for Wastewater Treatment
373

π–π and hydrophobic interaction, precipitation, and surface complexation ion
exchange) between functional materials and agricultural contaminants. The most
commonly found antibiotic in wastewater is tetracycline. The removal efﬁciency of
tetracycline antibiotics from the wastewater with various biochar ranges from 18.53
to 455.33 mg/g. In the process of antibiotic removal from wastewater, there are two
effects on functional materials on biochar were involved (Wei et al. 2018; Xiang
et al. 2020). They are escalating the surface functional groups of biochar, which
increases the surface area of biochar.
Other than antibiotics, pesticides also contaminate the water system. The most
commonly seen pesticides in wastewater are atrazine and pentachlorophenol. With
different biochar feedstocks, the adsorption capacity of biochar for the elimination of
pesticides varies and ranges from 11.56 to 50.00 mg/g (Wei et al. 2018). Anti-
inﬂammatory drugs, antibiotics, and analgesics are some pharmaceutically active
compounds that cause serious environmental and health problems. Biochar with
metal oxide/metal nanoparticles can efﬁciently remove the pharmaceutically active
compounds (Huang et al. 2019). The modiﬁed biochar has the greatest adsorption
capacity than the pristine biochar for removing nitrogen and phosphorus. The
modiﬁed biochar has a more speciﬁc surface area (SSA), more reaction activity,
and surface functional groups (SFG). Nitrogen present in the wastewater is removed
around 73% by using digested sugar beet tailing biochar. Mg biochar is used to
remove phosphate and ammonium from the wastewater. For industrial wastewater
treatment, the biochar is combined with chitosan after cross-linking; it can be casted
into membranes, beads, and solutions. The municipal wastewater is treated directly
with biochar or combined bioﬁlters.
17.4.4 Stormwater Treatment Using Biochar
Stormwater runoff causes deprivation of the natural water quality and needs to be
treated before its discharge due to increased metals, biological pollutants, and
organic matter. Biochar is used as a ﬁlter media in storm water treatment, economical
and readily available, depending on aqueous chemistry, pollutant characteristics, and
biochar properties. Zinc and copper in stormwater runoff are removed by a biochar-
based ﬁltration medium, and the removal rate is more than 85% and 95%, respec-
tively. Bisphenol A (BPA) from stormwater is removed by biochar integrated with
bioﬁlters. Wood dust biochar adsorbs BPA and promotes Phragmites australis
growth, increasing Escherichia coli, TOC, TSS, nitrogen, and phosphorus removal
rates (Rajapaksha et al. 2015). Biochar-amended bioﬁlters can show more than 99%
TOC removal rate than the unamended ones and can raise the elimination of TOC,
TN, and TP to greater than 60%.
The ammonium in stormwater can be adsorbed by poultry litter biochars (PLB),
which are pyrolyzed at 500 C, and the NH
4 adsorption is subjugated by cation
exchange. PO3
4 -P and NO3-N from leachate are removed by Zn-activated sewage
sludge-based activated carbon, and the rate of removal of PO3
4 -P and NO3-N
374
Karthik V. et al.

decreases with the increasing pH value. Biochar and zero-valent iron (ZVI) are
amended in bio-retention systems to increase nitrate removal efﬁciency. The trans-
port of E. coli depends on the morphology structures and hydrophobicity of the
biochar. H2SO4-modiﬁed wood biochar improves E. coli retention and can be a
bio-retention ﬁlter medium for E. coli removal from the stormwater. The surface
modiﬁcation of biochar increases the adsorption capacity of biochar. To effectively
remove pollutants from the wastewater, a deep understanding of the surface modiﬁ-
cation of biochar is important, which will be discussed in further topics (Xiang et al.
2020).
17.5
Surface Modification of Biochar for Wastewater Treatment
Unlike normal biochar, modiﬁed biochar works efﬁciently by adsorbing the
contaminants from wastewater. The modiﬁed biochar generally penetrates the sludge
and easily neutralizes the charge on the sludge, thereby removing the toxic waste
(Guo et al. 2020). Since biochar possesses hydrophobic properties, it hinders the
adsorption efﬁciency of hydrophilic materials. In order to overcome this failure, an
effective and targeted modiﬁcation should be done on biochar (Shi et al. 2020).
Scientists focus on modifying biochar for its excellent properties to improve the
environmental beneﬁts and easy remediation to pollution (Godwin et al. 2019).
Chitosan is an important material used to modify biochar, since it contains many
functional groups on its molecular chain, making the biochar hydrophilic and
improving its adsorption sites. Four common methods can do modiﬁcation: physical
modiﬁcation, chemical modiﬁcation, impregnation process, and magnetic modiﬁca-
tion, as indicated in Fig. 17.2 (Shi et al. 2020).
In the physical modiﬁcation, the surface area is made to increase in order to
improve the pore structure of biochar. A study reported that pore volume increased
by 6.4–48 times when the physical modiﬁcation is carried out on biochar (Liu et al.
2019). In chemical modiﬁcation/activation, the surface functional groups are
increased in number and are activated to provide more binding sites for the removal
of pollutants. The removal rate of pollutants from wastewater increased from 72 to
99.6% while using modiﬁed biochar (Zhang et al. 2020).
Surface modiﬁcation methodologies include steam activation for introducing
oxygen-containing functional groups, heat treatment for adsorbing hydrocarbon,
an alkaline modiﬁcation for producing positive surface charges, impregnation
methods for facilitating physical or chemical attachment of metal ions on biochar
structure, an acidic modiﬁcation for increasing the acidic property, and hydrophilic
nature of biochar. KOH- and H3PO4-modiﬁed biochar greatly help remove dyes
from wastewaters, especially methylene blue (Ahmed et al. 2016). The phosphorus
recovery ratio using unmodiﬁed biochar is 73 and 37%, which is very poor com-
pared with modiﬁed biochar (Fang et al. 2014). The use of biochar for removal of
phosphates and nitrates adsorbed only 2.5 and 1.5μmol/g. When the modiﬁcation is
done on produced biochar by Mg-Al, it showed three times of removal efﬁciency
than normal biochar (Yin et al. 2018).
17

On reviewing all methods for modiﬁcation, alkali-modiﬁed biochar and
nanomaterial impregnated biochar shows good adsorption properties, which favors
the removal of different contaminants from wastewater (Fang et al. 2014; Yin et al.
2018). The biochar has an immense ability for metal sorption from aqueous solutions
and has received better attention during the past decade. However, studies are mostly
at a lab scale, focusing on the sorption of single metal from spiked solution. In
natural waters, different heavy metals may coexist with other pollutants; hence, there
is a competition for sorption sites on biochar surfaces between metals and other ions
or organic pollutants. Only a small number of studies have analyzed the competitive
sorption of metals by biochar (Vickers 2017). The reported studies have utilized
pristine biochar developed by conventional pyrolysis and not microwave-assisted
pyrolyzed biochar (Luo et al. 2008). The sesame straw pristine biochar for the
sorption of multi-metals from synthetic wastewater showed that sorption behaviors
of multi-metals (Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu, and Zn) differed mono-metal sorption. In this
competition, other metals reduced Cd sorption. Similarly, they compared the sorp-
tion of corn straw pristine biochar for aqueous Hg and/or atrazine and showed that
Hg and atrazine inhibited each other’s sorption (Tan et al. 2016). The direct
competitive sorption on soybean stalk-based pristine biochar, each suppressing the
other when phenanthrene and Hg coexisted in solution, are observed (Kong et al.
2011). In addition, humic acids coexisting with the contaminants in the aqueous
environment inﬂuence the metal sorption by biochar. It was shown that the humic
acids increased the sorption capacities of Pb2+ and Cr(VI) by sludge-derived pristine
biochar from 197 to 233 mmol/g and 688 to738 mmol/g, respectively. Due to the
Fig. 17.2 General methods for surface modiﬁcation of biochar
376
Karthik V. et al.

adsorbed humic acids, their functional groups offer additional sites for Pb2+ ion and
supply more reducing agents, facilitating Cr(VI) transformation to Cr(III). Further
studies are required to accurately estimate the metal sorption capacity of biochar in
natural environments. Currently, there is no report on the usage of biochar to
eliminate heavy metals from polluted wastewater for ﬁeld application (Zhou et al.
2015). Besides, future studies are needed on the pH, dosing and recovery
approaches, and the regeneration, and disposal of metal-sorbed biochar for ﬁeld
application.
17.6
Future Prospects of Biochar for Wastewater Treatment
Supply and removal of water are the central components of settlement structures.
Lack of sanitary facilities and water scarcity is the key issues because many people
die or fall ill every day. To provide sustainable wastewater treatment, speciﬁc
technologies are to be further developed. The researchers are working on these
particular topics to improvise wastewater treatment in all possible methods. These
methods may include using certain highly potential materials, which increase the
efﬁciency of wastewater treatment. Biochar is a highly efﬁcient material that can be
used to remove pollutants from wastewater because they are low-cost, renewable,
and sustainable material compared with activated carbon.
Biochar has become increasingly important in remediating contaminants in the
industrial and agricultural sectors to improve environmental quality. It can be used
with all kinds of wastewater such as industrial, municipal, agricultural wastewater,
and stormwater. Some future needs should be focused on increasing the usage of
biochar in wastewater treatment, which helps in the easy removal of pollutants.
Some of them are feedstocks that need to be readily available and cheap sources.
Nevertheless, the major constrain in the process of production is the high cost due to
this modiﬁcation procedure.
Hence, in the future, researchers should attempt to ﬁnd a compromising solution
sandwiched between the production processes and enhancing the applicability of
biochar with more and suitable functional to minimize the cost. The stability of
biochar in biochar-based products needs to be increased to improve industrial and
municipal wastewater treatment efﬁciency. New methods can be optimized in the
future to increase the adsorption capacity of biochar for the sorption of heavy metals,
organic contaminants, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Certain solutions for recovery or
desorption of biochar, like magnetization of biochar, may also be made, making it
handy to separate the contaminant loaded with biochar from water by applying an
external magnetic ﬁeld.

Conclusion
This chapter gives a systemic outline of the importance of wastewater treatment in
general and the speciﬁc function of biochar in wastewater treatment. Various
biomass materials, including agricultural crop residues, forestry residues, sewage
sludge, solid organic municipal wastes and manure, are most widely used for
producing biochar, which is an efﬁcient and low-cost adsorbent material. The
alteration of biochar through physical and chemical activation methods is also
discussed to regulate the functional groups on the surface of biochar to improve its
surface area and porous structure. These modiﬁcations amplify its surface oxygen-
containing groups, leading to increased efﬁciency of biochar to remove pollutants
from the wastewater. Biochar, rather than activated carbon, can extract pollutants
and has many beneﬁts, including recovering nutrients from wastewater, enhancing
activated sludge treatment to minimize energy use for aeration, and increasing
sludge settling capacity and the energy recovery from sludge through anaerobic
digestion. Hence, biochar plays an efﬁcient role in wastewater management, which
may need speciﬁc future improvements to make it more effective in future economic
routes.

Abstract
Industrialization, urbanization, and mining activities are the primary sources of
soil contamination. Human-made and rare natural activities are disseminating
potentially toxic elements and organic pollutants in the environment. Restoration
of ecology also blends several related disciplines, including hydrology, geomor-
phology, and oceanography. The primary role of the restoration of ecology is to
conserve or improve the soil ecosystem services and implement efﬁcient
environment-friendly techniques for the characterization of pollutants, risk
assessment in problematic zones, and reclamation of polluted agricultural sites.
Physical and chemical methods are widely in practice to restore the contaminated
agricultural soil efﬁciently. There are also eco-friendly better techniques that
comprehend the mobilization and immobilization of enzymes/microbes to
reawaken the polluted soil. Restoration of agricultural soil is an important concept
needed in the present and future to make the upcoming generation healthier and
make the ecosystem stable.

Introduction
Soil is one of the most primitive of all resources available in the environment that
provides an essence to the terrestrial ecosystem and cultural heritage. Soil is found to
be ﬁnite in extent and has a threat by various natural and man-made factors. The soil
quality decides the health of the ecosystem, environment, and all life forms living in
this universe. There are different means of components provided in the ecosystem.
The soil environment is maintained through services provisioned throughout the soil
like food, ﬁber, waste disposal, climate moderation through carbon cycling, elemen-
tal cycling, and water ﬁltration. Soil quality or soil nutrient content needs to be
conﬁned or restored to augment these services. It has been becoming mandatory to
have public awareness and elementary perceptive of basic biology, chemistry,
physics, and ecology to improve long-term productivity (Lal 2015) and enhance
the health of the environment.
Soil is an important key factor that helps regulate natural and socioeconomic
processes for sustaining human and animal survival. Soil needs to be maintained
appropriately in order to overcome the crises of food and water in the future.
Agriculture is facing many challenges since the twenty-ﬁrst century. Researchers
are framing new technologies to protect the soil from various contamination types
that threaten human and animal life. The expanded demanding and arbitrary use of
agrochemicals unfavorably altered the biodiversity of soil and sustainability in
agriculture and food safety, which in the long-term creates harmful effects on
human, animal health, and nutrition. The activities of soil microbes and their
biochemical processes are negatively affected by agrochemicals.
Soil holds diverse ﬂora, fauna, and rich sources of microorganisms that can self-
renew the soil contamination to a permissible limit. These soil microorganisms have
an interrelation with the soil fertility on the basis of different soil properties:
1. Chemical properties include pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), salinity, and
nutrient content of the soil (micronutrient, macronutrient, and organic matter).
2. Physical properties such as stability of the soil, aeration in the soil, porosity,
water retention, and also the contact between mineral and organic soil
components.
3. Biological properties should have appropriate interaction between the micro-
and macrobiota in the soil.
All these aspects are closely interrelated. Consequently, their stability is respon-
sible for soil fertility. There are plenty of reasons for the contamination of soil
(Tetteh 2015). A large number of highly noxious components were delivered into the
surroundings because of numerous industrial and agricultural activities. Organic

chemicals comprise fuels, alkanes, pesticides, solvents, phosphorus compounds,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrogen, explosives, and dyes (Karthik
et al. 2020), whereas the inorganic contaminants are toxic heavy metals.
In most countries, soil, groundwater, and surface water contamination are con-
sidered a global problem. Furthermore, composite pollution, which contains more
than one contaminant and toxic metals, may mount up in the environment (Banu
et al. 2020). Toxicological risk evaluation and the practicability of bioremediation
technologies have been important points of concern in contaminated agricultural soil
sites.
There are many methods for remediating the contaminated agricultural soil, like
physical methods, chemical methods, and biological methods (Gianfreda et al.
2006). The majority of the chemical and physical techniques (such as stabilization,
encapsulation, electrokinetics, solidiﬁcation, vitriﬁcation, soil washing, vapor
extraction, and ﬂushing) are costlier than the biological processes. Such physical
and chemical methods are incapable of making the soil suitable for plant growth. In
comparison, the biological approach (bioremediation) promotes the establishment/
reestablishment of plants on contaminated soils at low cost (Chibuike and Obiora
2014). Bioremediation is an environmentally friendly technique since it occurs
through natural processes. It is also a cost-effective remediation method in contrast
with other remediation techniques.
To renovate soil properties, soil contaminated with heavy metal and other con-
tamination requires remediation. Soil washing, phytoremediation and immobiliza-
tion techniques are recurrently used for the remediation of contaminated agricultural
land. Soil washing is one of the stable management alternatives used to detach heavy
metals from agricultural soils. It has a greater advantage of removing heavy metals at
a maximum value at a considerable cost. Phytoremediation is a technique that
reduces the toxic heavy metal content in the soil using plants and its related soil
microorganisms. It comprises different sub-methods like phytostabilization,
phytodegradation, phytoextraction, phytovolatilization, and phytoﬁltration (Mitra
et al. 2020). The in situ technique of immobilization achieves the remediation of
contaminated soil with the help of varied processes like adsorption, precipitation,
and complexation reactions. Heavy metals are immobilized with immobilizing
agents and amendments, making them less available for transportation to other
sites in the soil and reducing their bioavailability. Broadly used amendments for
immobilization are limestone, zeolites, clay, minerals, lime, phosphates, organic
composts, etc. Immobilization has gained its advantage for remediation with negli-
gible impact on agricultural production compared with soil washing and
phytoremediation (Cagnetta et al. 2018). However, large-scale engineering is a
major limitation in the reclamation of agricultural soils due to high operating
expenses during the scale-up of the restoration process. At this juncture,
phytoremediation is one of the best green solutions for restoring the agricultural
soil contaminated with heavy metal. The soil environment will be healthy, mainly
for agricultural purposes.
There is a vast diversity in the sources of the pollutants and also chemical
complexity

18

remove the organic compounds. There are three main approaches to deal with the
polluted agricultural site: (1) classiﬁcation of the problem, (2) evaluation of the
nature and degree of the hazard, and (3) the best choice of remedial action. To
recreate the ecosystem, new technologies have been incessantly refabricated to
reestablish and renovate the contaminated agricultural soil, further to detoxify the
contaminated agricultural site. Remediation, whether by biological, chemical, or a
combination of both means, is the only way to get rid of toxins in the soil without
passing them to future generations (Ramakrishnan et al. 2011).
The selection of a suitable remediation method is based on the toxic limit of
pollutants and the peril it poses to the surroundings. It must be prominent that the
remediation does not intend for entire reﬁnement. The central focus is to bring the
pollution level well below the toxic regulatory limit (Kulkarni et al. 2008). This is
done by clearing the poisonous pollutants and/or immobilizing the pollutant that
restrict its movement through the subsurface geo environment. The remediation
techniques are broadly classiﬁed as physical, electrical, chemical, biological, ther-
mal, and blending methods (Asquith et al. 2012). In the forthcoming topics, various
causes of agricultural soil pollution and different methods for remediating polluted
agricultural soil are discussed in detail.
18.2
Sources of Agricultural Soil Contamination
The rapid development of industries and increased use of chemical amendments to
the soil have drastically ampliﬁed soil contamination in recent decades. The
contaminants are from different sources and of varied types. The sources of soil
pollution are grouped by different means in various kinds of literature as agricultural,
nonagricultural, and natural sources (Palansooriya et al. 2020). Figure 18.1 explains
the classiﬁcation of various sources of pollutants, which are the primary reasons for
contaminating agricultural soil.
18.2.1 Agricultural Sources
18.2.1.1 Fertilizers
Fertilizers are chemical-based components infused with micronutrients and
macronutrients in a particular ratio. Fertilizers are applied to the soil to improve
the soil nutrients like nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) to get a high
yield from the crops. Sometimes the fertilizers are prepared with the microorganisms
that promote the particular nutrients to the soil. They are in different forms like solid,
liquid, semisolid, and slow-release particles. However, these fertilizers improve the
productivity of the crop, but it has many harmful impacts on the soil health and the
microorganisms that reside in the soil. Soil health refers to the complete physical,
biological, and chemical properties of the soil. The critical nutrients such as N, K,
and P are supplemented in the soil to improve crop productivity (Velusamy et al.
2021). These inorganic fertilizers also hold many heavy metals like mercury, copper,
384
Karthik V. et al.

cadmium, lead, and nickel, contributing to soil degradation and contamination (Iqbal
et al. 2021).
Research studies explained that continuous use of chemical fertilizer on the soil
would have many ill effects on the soil and on all life on the soil in due course of
time. The vital component that is degraded due to these fertilizers is the soil
structure. Fertilizers degrade the soil structure with the help of the chemical
components present, and repeated use of acid-forming nitrogen fertilizer causes a
decrease in the soil’s pH. Research by Savci (2012) reported the ammonium sulfate
fertilizer effect on the tea ﬁeld in turkey. Application of nitrogen fertilizer in the tea
ﬁeld increased soils’ acidity, and nearly 85% of the territory reached a pH below
4 (Savci 2012). This research also portrayed the effect of potassium fertilizer, which
created an imbalance in the nutrient content of the agricultural soils. It made the
plants deprive of necessary essential nutrients for the growth and yield of the plant.
18.2.1.2 Pesticides
In modern-day agriculture, pesticides contribute to be a vital factor for increasing the
yield of the crop. However, it destroys the pest and insects in the crops, thereby
increasing productivity. On the other hand, it has several negative consequences for
the soil and humans. These pesticides reach the soil causing degradation, and some
of the soil properties are lost. The pesticides also increase the toxicity of the soil,
thereby killing the beneﬁcial soil microorganisms, which are essential for plant
growth (Tetteh 2015).
It was estimated that less than 10% of the applied pesticide alone reach the target
pest in particular research. The remaining content will reach soil and water bodies
Fig. 18.1 Different sources of agricultural soil contaminants
18
Restoration of Contaminated Agricultural Soils
385

contaminating the soil, air, and water. The levels of pesticides that become persistent
in the soil are at diverse ranges, disrupting the soil’s chemical composition.
Pesticides also have been known to harm soil microbes. It can alter the nature of
the soil microorganisms, which are accountable for soil health, plant growth, and the
proper maintenance of the ecosystem. The interference of the chemical pesticides in
the soil deteriorated soil fertility by spoiling the microﬂora and microfauna (Pimentel
and Burgess 2012). Fungicide is harmful to the fungi present in the soil and to the
actinomycetes by altering the structure of the microbial community. All kinds of
pesticides have a serious inﬂuence on the microbes present in the soil. Some of the
organochlorine pesticides are found to impact the nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria by reduc-
ing the crop yield (Terziev and Petkova-Georgieva 2020). Similarly, pentachloro-
phenol, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and methyl parathion are also
identiﬁed to interfere in symbiotic soil bacteria.
18.2.2 Nonagricultural Sources
Nonagricultural sources include the solid waste obtained from all kinds of waste
treatment plants, including garbage, constructional debris, sludge, and other redun-
dant materials. The rapid increase in population has maximized the amount of solid
waste delivered into society. These solid wastes are of different compositions, which
cause adverse effects on human, animal, and agricultural soil health (Palansooriya
et al. 2020). These solid wastes also vary based on the different localities and
sources.
18.2.2.1 Municipal Solid Wastes
Municipal solid waste encompasses a list of items that are being used in routine and
discarded daily, including domestic waste, kitchen waste, clothing, bottles, food
scraps, newspapers, paint, and batteries (Pedrero et al. 2010). Municipal wastes are
classiﬁed into ﬁve major types based on the kind of pollutants, as indicated in
Table 18.1.
Municipal wastes are disposed by two major methods like dumps and landﬁlls.
Landﬁlls are designed especially with the help of clay linings and synthetic sheets.

Karthik V. et al.

These sheets are used to separate the waste materials from the soil. These kinds of
landﬁlls are practiced since the olden days to avoid pollutants contaminating the
agricultural soil (Tabasso et al. 2020). The total production of municipal solid waste
(MSW) was 292.4 million tons in 2018, or 4.9 pounds per person per day. Of the
MSW produced, roughly 69 million tons were recycled, and 25 million tons were
composted. Almost 94 million tons of MSW were casted off and composted,
equivalent to a 32.1% recycling and composting rate. An additional 17.7 million
tons of food were handled by other methods (Angelovičová and Fazekašová 2014).
Pollution of agricultural soil due to the improper disposal of municipal wastes in
developing countries creates lots of environmental threats to the soil health and water
environment (Selvakumar and Sivashanmugam 2018), which disrupts the balance of
the ecosystem.
18.2.2.2 Hospital Wastes
Hospital wastes also constitute a major portion of a pollutant that causes several
adverse impacts on the agricultural soil. Hospital wastes originate from the disposal,
diagnosis, and treatment procedures done in the health sector. These comprise
medical wastes like surgical instruments, blood, tissues, amputated body parts, and
contaminated microbial cultures. Additional utilities are the following: dressings,
bandages, gloves, cotton, noxious and corrosive chemicals, solvents, diagnostic kits,
genotoxic waste and radioactive liquid wastes, etc. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO) report in 2018, it was summarized that the hospital waste
generated per bed in developed countries is found to be 0.5 kg. In developing
countries, the hospital wastes generated per bed are analyzed as 0.2 kg. The risk is
high in developed countries than the developing countries and causes numerous
health hazards. Most commonly, these wastes are disposed of by the landﬁll method,
in which some contaminants will penetrate into the soil and cause the surrounding
soil to get contaminated due to water percolation.
Another important strategy that is employed in remediating the hospital wastes in
developing countries is incineration. Incineration of waste releases many pollutants
like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB),
and many carcinogenic compounds that foist many unpleasant effects on the envi-
ronment. The ash predominantly released from these incineration processes causes
many worse effects on the soil health and environment. The ash also constitutes
some heavy metals like cadmium, lead, chromium, mercury, and zinc, contaminating
agricultural soil (Gidarakos et al. 2009). To overcome these issues related to hospital
wastes, novel strategies need to be employed to mitigate the environmental hazards.
18.2.2.3 Industrial Wastes
Industrial wastes are developed due to urbanization and industrialization, which
discard various materials like concrete, gravel, scrap, metals, paints, oil, trash,
gravel, and organic and inorganic chemicals (Wuana and Okieimen 2011). These
materials are chemical compounds released into the environment without under-
standing the futuristic problems that will be a threat to human and animal life, which
will completely modify the healthy ecosystem. Those pollutants are highly corro-
sive, toxic, and reactive materials that pose a severe threat to the environment
18
Restoration of Contaminated Agricultural Soils
387

(Selvakumar and Sivashanmugam 2020). Developed countries have identiﬁed many
strategies for these industrial wastes disposal, but the developing countries are still
struggling a lot in these issues (Ahmed et al. 2019). The point sources are discrete
and localized contaminations, whereas nonpoint sources are associated with a wide
range of processes or human activities that cover huge areas.
18.2.3 Natural Sources
Natural sources that cause soil contamination consist of volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes,
geographical
changes,
and
alterations
in
rainfall
patterns.
Accumulating these naturally occurring compounds or chemicals in the soil and
environment will cause serious disturbance to the ecosystem and human beings.
These chemicals are getting converted to toxic compounds, which are affecting all
forms of life.
18.2.3.1 Volcanic Eruptions
Dust, lava, ash particles, and gases were exploded from the interior of the earth’s
crust in hot magma, referred to as volcanic eruption. According to the US Geological
Survey, a huge amount of hazardous substances are produced by volcanic eruption
and demolish the surrounding environment. The contents released from those
eruptions are toxic to humans and other life on earth. Volcanic eruption releases
aerosols and greenhouse gases like sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
hydrogen ﬂuoride, and hydrogen sulﬁde, accumulating in the atmosphere termed as
outgassing. Lava, which is realized from the volcano along with the ash particles,
destroys the surrounding land area. The fertile portion of the soil is eroded by lava, a
hot material released from the volcano.
18.2.3.2 Earthquakes
Earthquakes are caused due to the sudden movement of tectonic plates below the soil
surface with the release of energy due to volcanic activities. Earthquake causes
serious damage to the constructions, dams, bridges, roads, railway lines and
pipelines, etc., thereby causing contamination to the groundwater, affecting the
agricultural soil. Agricultural soil fertility is affected after the earthquake, which
makes the soil to be unavailable for cultivations. There are enormous secondary
impacts of earthquakes like breakage of pipelines of water, fuel, electrical, and oil.
During nuclear power generation, a large amount of radioactive and other wastes
are released into the environment. These harmful pollutants continue to stay in the
environment for long times, which are used up by the atmosphere to accumulate and
biomagnify potential toxic contaminants for the organisms that live on the earth.
Medical waste, sewage waste, and radioactive waste release toxic material, affecting
the soil, water, and air. Earthquake leads to one of the most dangerous effects of soil
liquefaction. The soil loses its stability, strength, and stiffness by converting soil to
liquid or mud form. This effect has a severe impact on the residential area construc-
tion, which loosens the soil and makes it unﬁt for construction.

18.2.3.3 Rainfall Patterns
Soil constitutes many varied organic materials to balance the nutrient of the soil,
oxygen content, and water holding capacity, which forms the basic framework of the
soil. Variation in rainfall patterns considerably affects the composition of the soil
organic materials sensitive to climatic aberrations. Moreover, the acidic content
increase in the soil due to the excessive rainfall further leads to leaching. Alteration
in rainfall patterns has a serious problem in the arid and subhumid areas. For
instance, due to excessive rainfall, pyrite-rich materials are oxidized to acid sulfate
soils, which are important for leaching.
18.2.3.4 Geographical Changes
A wide range of undesirable effects on soil health is observed due to the geographi-
cal changes in the surrounding. The soil erosion with these geographical changes can
be observed with modern techniques like Geographic Information System (GIS) and
Remote Sensing (RS). These modern advanced techniques are used to acquire details
regarding the soil health and diverse characteristics of the soil surface in addition to
examine the extent of land degradation.
18.2.3.5 Tsunamis
It is caused by the sudden displacement of water from the interior of the sea due to
unexpected underwater explosions, earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions.
These changes happen in the depth of the sea due to the instability occurring below
or above the water level. Tsunami creates many problems by accumulating many
pollutants in the water, soil, and air, thus making the soil, water, and land unﬁt for
cultivation. The pollutants keep on increasing on the soil surface, causing land and
water pollution.
18.3
Techniques Used for the Restoration of Contaminated
Agricultural Soils
Various techniques were employed to treat the contaminated soil and to restore the
fertility of the agricultural soil. To maintain soil health and to preserve the stability of
the ecosystem, the polluted soil needs to be remediated and recycled (Bini 2009).
There are different methods of soil remediation, such as physical, chemical,
biological and concoction, or novel remediation, as represented in Fig. 18.2.
To better understand each process, the different soil remediation methods shown
in the ﬁgure are examined in detail, along with their remediation effectiveness. The
overall objective of any soil remediation approach is to generate an enhanced
solution that protects human health and the environment. Physical and chemical
treatments effectively remediate the soil, but there are some disadvantages causing
soil disturbance (Karthik et al. 2020). The biological remediation, which degrades
the soil contaminants in a natural process, produces positive results, but it is time-
consuming. Bioremediation is also an environment-friendly and less expensive
18
Restoration of Contaminated Agricultural Soils
389

technique for maintaining soil health (Gong et al. 2018). In general, soil remediation
techniques are classiﬁed into two types based on the way of application:
•
In situ remediation
•
Ex situ remediation
In Situ Remediation In situ treatment allows the soil fertility to be restored without
excavating it. It also restricts land disposal limitations on the redeposition of treated
soil. In situ remediation generally involves longer handling times due to the hetero-
geneity of the subsurface, which makes it laborious to assure uniformity of treat-
ment. A signiﬁcant concern regarding soil remediation in situ treatment is to avoid
the spread of contamination resulting from inducing the contaminants to remove
from the zone of contaminated soil (Wuana and Okieimen 2011).
Ex Situ Remediation Ex situ remediation is done by removing the soil from the
area of the polluted site. Ex situ treatment of excavated soils includes the technolog-
ical principles used to remove organic contaminants from the soil, namely, washing
and volatilization. Ex situ treatment of excavated soil has a further concern in
treatment and preparing the soil for processing. These include control of emissions,
screening, homogenization, dewatering/drying, feed rate control, and measurement
(Wuana and Okieimen 2011; Yao et al. 2012). These two methods will be applicable
for all the methods that are given in the upcoming topics.
18.3.1 Physical Remediation
Remediation of soil by physical method comprises technologies that isolate the
pollutants from the soil. The process involves reducing the volume of pollutants
by transferring them to another medium (e.g., air or water). Based on amount and
Fig. 18.2 Techniques for restoring contaminated agricultural soil
390
Karthik V. et al.

concentration, the new contaminated media may require additional treatment to
either concentrate or devastate the waste for the reuse of soil. Hence, physical
separation treatment requires a series of steps to complete the process (Yao et al.
2012). Physical remediation mainly includes (1) soil substitution strategy or soil
replacement method and (2) thermal desorption or warm desorption.
18.3.1.1 Soil Substitution Strategy or Soil Replacement Method
The soil replacement method or soil substitution strategy is a method used to clean
contaminated
agricultural
soil
by
replacing
or
moderately
removing
the
contaminated soil to dilute the pollutant concentration, which increases the soil
environmental capacity, thereby promoting soil fertility (Qayyum et al. 2020). The
soil substitution strategy is also divided into three types: soil replacement, new soil
importing, and soil spading.
1. Soil replacement is the removal of the contaminated soil and shifting it into the
new soil. This method is suitable for contaminated soil with a small area.
Furthermore, the replaced soil must be treated appropriately. Otherwise, the
second contamination may occur.
2. Soil spading is to trench the contaminated soil, making the pollutant diffuse into
the deep sites, thereby diluting and degrading naturally.
3. New soil importing is the process of adding up a large amount of clean soil into
the contaminated soil on the surface or mixing the clean soil with contaminated
soil, which will decrease the pollutant concentration.
The soil replacement can successfully isolate the contaminated soil and thus
diminish its effect on the environment. Soil replacement helps in renewing the
ecosystem by maintaining the proper natural healthy soil conditions. However, this
technology is tough to handle, high in cost, and suitable only for small areas with
profusely polluted soil (Yao et al. 2012).
18.3.1.2 Thermal Desorption or Warm Desorption
The thermal or warm desorption method is based on the contaminant’s volatility. It is
done by heating the contaminated soil using microwave, steam, and infrared radia-
tion to make the pollutant (e.g., Hg and As) volatile. The volatile heavy metals are
then made together using the negative vacuum pressure or carrier gas, removing the
heavy metals. According to the temperatures, the traditional thermal desorption can
be classiﬁed into:
•
High-temperature desorption (~320–560 C)
•
Low-temperature desorption (~90–320 C)
This technology is a simple process, with mobile devices, and the remediated soil
can be reused (Qayyum et al. 2020). However, limiting factors, such as expensive
devices and long desorption time, limit their application in soil remediation.
18
Restoration of Contaminated Agricultural Soils
391

18.3.2 Chemical Remediation
18.3.2.1 Chemical Leaching
The chemical method of leaching implies washing the polluted soil with chemical
reagents, gases of varied types, or other ﬂuids, which help remove the heavy metals
(Pd, Zn, Hg, etc.) from the polluted soils. The heavy metals present in the polluted
soil are then recovered from the leachate (Asaithambi et al. 2020). Investigations
were reported on wide concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCl), sulfuric acid
(H2SO4), hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF), nitric acid (HNO3), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and
for their effect of removal efﬁciency of arsenic (As) from yellowish-brown
contaminated soil. One of the most promising chemicals for the extraction of arsenic
is phosphoric acid, and potassium phosphate was found to be most efﬁcacious for the
removal of As from stream sediments around the abandoned mine areas in Goro,
Korea (Pająk et al. 2020).
Tea saponin is reported to be an effective solution for the removal of heavy metals
in addition to soluble acid, which will signiﬁcantly minimize ecological hazards.
Chemical leaching was a proven method to eliminate heavy metals like nickel
(Ni) and vanadium (V). These impurities were there in the black carbon waste
produced from the gasiﬁcation of crude oil bottom in reﬁneries. Acid leaching
with two molar nitric acid (HNO3) was analyzed to be a very advantageous method
(more effective than alkali) for the removal of both Ni (95%) and V (98%). Further,
the acid-treated carbon black waste was used as an absorbent for dye removal. It was
suggested that chemical leaching be a potent method for extracting Plutonium
(Pu) from radioactively contaminated soil. Although efﬁcacy mainly relies on the
type of soil and nature of heavy metal(s) present, chemical leaching is found to be
one of the best methods for effective remediation of polluted soils (Yao et al. 2012).
18.3.2.2 Chemical Fixation
Chemical ﬁxation is a type of remediation method in which chemicals or reagents are
introduced into a polluted soil environment and combined with heavy metals to form
insoluble, nontoxic content, minimizing the amount of heavy metals released into
the soil and water environment, thus preventing pollution. Qayyum et al. (2020)
analyzed the ability of bonemeal in the remediation process when added to the
contaminated soil. The pollutants/contaminants are immobilized on the soil and
reduced bioavailability with the formation of metal phosphates. Extraction of metals
was done batchwise in the bonemeal amended soil using 0.01 M CaCl2 and DTPA.
Cadmium (Cd) contamination was assessed with the help of bentonite and diatoma-
ceous earth. The experiment results showed a reduced concentration of cadmium
21.40, 27.63, 27.24, and 32.30% compared with the control when the chemical
addition quantity was 20, 30, 50, and 40 g/kg, respectively (Qayyum et al. 2020;
Prieto et al. 2018). Particular research reported the remediation of contaminated soil
with attapulgite clay in which the particular amendment can reduce the concentration
of cadmium pollutants by 46%. The soil quality will not be disturbed, thereby
enhancing the productivity of the soil.
392
Karthik V. et al.

Various literature on chemical ﬁxation analyzed the efﬁciency of phosphate rock,
furfural, and weathered coal on the polluted soil. The outcome explained that the
above materials could reduce the concentration of different metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and
Cd) to some extent. The chemical ﬁxation could renew the soil with low concentra-
tion pollutants; however, the bioavailability of ﬁxed heavy metals may be altered
with the changing environmental condition. The use of conditioning agents could
alter the soil organization to some degree and affect the microbes in the soil (He and
Yang 2007).
18.3.2.3 Vitrify Technology
Vitrify technology is the process of raising the temperature of the soil in the range of
~1400–2000 C, by which the organic matters volatilize or decompose. The steam is
produced and an offgas treatment system collects the pyrolysis product. The melt
formed after cooling forms rock shape vitreous, sieges the heavy metals and makes it
lose migration. For ex situ remediation, the energy can be supplied by fossil fuel
burning or electrode directly heating and then through an arc, plasma, and micro-
wave. For in situ remediation, the heat can be through electrodes inserted into the
contaminated soil (Wuana and Okieimen 2011). In summary, this technology can
remove heavy metals, and the efﬁciency was also high. However, it is complicated
and needs lots of energy to melt, making it to cost high that restricts its application.
18.3.3 Biological Remediation
Physical and chemical methods of remediation may negatively impact the soil up to a
certain limit due to the usage of chemicals and reagents. This problem would be
reduced with the help of biological remediation, which uses biological compounds
or materials to remediate the soil. With the alteration in physical and chemical
characterizations of microorganisms, the movement and transformation of heavy
metals can be reduced. It cannot destroy or completely degrade the pollutant.
However, biological remediation is affected by various conditions like pH,
temperatures, moisture, and oxygen. It is also limited to certain applications, such
as some microorganisms that can only degrade special contaminants and microbes
that may incur secondary pollution (Wuana and Okieimen 2011). The biological
remediation includes phytoremediation, bioremediation, and combined remediation
methods.
18.3.3.1 Phytoremediation
Phytoremediation comprises a pool of agricultural techniques for reducing the
concentration of pollutants and the risk associated with the occurrence of organic
and inorganic contaminants by using plants or their components. Phytoremediation
uses living green plants to ﬁx and adsorb contaminants to remediate the environment
and ecology (Fiorentino et al. 2018). Three main types of phytoremediation are
phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, and phytoextraction.
18
Restoration of Contaminated Agricultural Soils
393

18.3.3.1.1 Phytostabilization
Phytostabilization is the process in which the metals are immobilized in the soil with
the help of plants, thus reducing their mobility to groundwater, which will protect the
groundwater from contamination. Plants have the ability to immobilize the
contaminants in the soil through adsorption, accumulation in roots, or precipitation
in the area of the roots, which in turn prevents the migration of the pollutants,
minimizing erosion, leaching, and dispersion in the soil (Liu et al. 2015).
18.3.3.1.2 Phytovolatilization
Phytovolatilization is the process by which the heavy metals are absorbed and
converted into volatile compounds, i.e., into gaseous matter using special
compounds secreted by root. The process works by taking up the contaminants or
heavy metals and transpiration of pollutants by plants. It not only is primarily applied
to groundwater but also can be applied to sludges, sediments, and soils. Chlorinated
solvents can also be removed with the help of phytovolatilization, e.g., selenium,
mercury, and arsenic. Mercury is the most studied heavy metal. When contaminants
are adsorbed, the metabolic processes of the plant commence their functions to
renovate into other compounds or volatilize into the atmosphere. However,
phytovolatilization technology is only suitable for volatile contaminants, limiting
the application (Wuana and Okieimen 2011).
18.3.3.1.3 Phytoextraction
Phytoextraction is a method of adsorbing heavy metals using the most tolerant and
accumulating plants and then transferring them to overground parts. It is to employ
the plants that can hold and concentrate metals from the soil on the roots. The roots
of sunﬂowers have been used to treat wastewater containing lead, uranium, stron-
tium, cesium, cobalt, and zinc; other plants with this perspective are popular and
water hyacinth. Studying the adsorption characterization of different plants and
screening high uptake plants is the key to this technology (Fagnano et al. 2020).
Following the rules of US department of energy, the plants used for this
phytoextraction should have the following characteristics (Prieto et al. 2018):
(1) high metal accumulating efﬁciency even under low concentration of
contaminants, (2) accumulation of high concentrations of the contaminants,
(3) Accumulation of many different kinds of heavy metals, and (4) high resistance
to pest and disease.
18.3.3.2 Biochar
Biochar is carbonaceous porous materials developed from the conversion of organic
material through the thermochemical like pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation and hydrother-
mal process. In recent years because of the beneﬁts reported on biochar, it has been
extensively used in the ﬁeld of bioremediation. Researchers also acknowledge that
biochar was proved to be a beneﬁcial one for improving crop productivity by
remediating the contaminated agricultural soil and making it available for reuse by
the crops (Mohamed et al. 2015). Biochar is most widely used as a soil amendment
for its important advantages like sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere into
394
Karthik V. et al.

the soil, stabilizing soil properties and enrichment of soil nutrients. Despite a wide
range of applications available for biochar, there are various issues related to public
health. The addition of biochar to the soil causes severe respiratory problems to
human health, and also the accumulation of heavy metals also causes the same.
Having a considerable dose of biochar for remediation will be appropriate for the
purpose without causing much damage. Improvement needs to be done to make
biochar an eco-friendly and effective method for agricultural soil remediation
(Yi et al. 2017; Zahed et al. 2021).
18.3.4 Concoction and Novel Methods of Remediation
18.3.4.1 Nanoremediation
Nanotechnology ﬁnds its use in all the ﬁelds and has contributed a great diversity of
materials with the technology for varied applications. As common knowledge,
nanotechnology is used to get the materials or product in the nanorange of
1–100 nm. Nanotechnology aims to improve the quality of the product with a longer
lifespan. The arrival of nanotechnology has many environmental beneﬁts. The
emergence of nanotechnology presents several budding environmental beneﬁts
(Nehra et al. 2021). Nanotechnology keeps up an assuring ability for the preservation
of the environment and agricultural soil restoration. A signiﬁcant sustainable strat-
egy has been employed to replenish soil nature by degrading the toxic pollutants,
thereby enriching biodegradation. An efﬁcient and eco-friendly choice to other
remediation techniques can be made using this technology to extract varied organic
(PAHs) and inorganic (heavy metals) contaminants. Nanoparticles have made spe-
ciﬁc physical and chemical properties as the particles of preference to restore the
polluted environments. Immense importance for remediation of polluted soil is given
to the nanoparticles that are attained from hyperaccumulator plants, bacteria, yeast,
and fungi. Multitudes of research are now concentrated on the green synthesis of
nanoparticles, i.e., nanoparticle production using biological materials like plants,
algae, fungi, and bacteria.
Similarly, it is mandatory for the researchers to achieve the sustainability of
nanoparticles and comprehend the meticulous mechanisms and their mode of action.
In the years to come, additional improvements and transformations can be accom-
plished in the nanotechnological ﬁeld that will certainly enhance the efﬁciency of
nanobioremediation (Gong et al. 2018; Karthik et al. 2021). A furthermore thorough
study heeding the effect of nanoparticles on soil ﬂora ought to be suggested. It is
critical to plan a powerful strategy that may affect soil microbes to maintain the soil
biodiversity.
18.3.4.2 Immobilization
Several advanced technologies have been developing to remediate the soil; one
among them is immobilization. Immobilization has become an important technology
in almost all ﬁelds. It is used in the agricultural area to retain the total microbial count
in the soil, which is not possible in using the microorganisms directly in the soil.

Microbial load in the soil is one of the major reasons for the maintenance of soil
quality (Guo et al. 2018). Agricultural products are in the current situation are
prepared and developed with this technology. Stella et al. (2019) selected four
gram-negative bacteria strains used to improve N, P, and K concentration in the
soil. All four beneﬁcial strains are immobilized with alginate solution. Results
showed that the bacterial count in compost fertilizer was 107 cfu/g, while organic
fertilizer (5:5:5) was 106 cfu/g, after 1 year of shelf-life. Mineral fertilizer (15:15:15)
and immobilized bacteria mixed in 1:50 ratio exhibited 105 cfu/g after 210 days.
Pelleting the cells found to be effective for immobilizing with the organic fertilizer.
The immobilized bacterial cells are mixed in a ratio of 1:50 with organic fertilizer
and results observed that 106 cfu/g of bacteria retained for 348 days, showing the
immobilized bacterial cell will be a useful alternative for the agricultural soil
remediation (Stella et al. 2019; Nejad et al. 2018).
The efﬁciency of different restoration methods of various pollutants is
represented in Table 18.2. These remediation methods for the restoration of agricul-
tural soil have been discussed clearly in the above topics, which will provide a better
solution for the contaminated agricultural soil. Even though the remediation methods
are effective in its use, it has some limitations due to various factors. The general
limitations are addressed in the following discussion for understanding the proper
restoration conditions.

General Limitations of Contaminated Agricultural Soil
Restoration
18.4.1 pH
The pH of soil plays a signiﬁcant part in the mobility and bioavailability of heavy
metal present in the soil and affects the cation exchange and metal-binding pro-
cesses. An increase in the pH of acid paddy soils fallout in the creation of additional
negatively charged sorption sites on the soil colloid and organic matter surfaces,
decreasing the metal availability. As the pH of the soil increase, the concentration of
OH also increases with the carbonate and hydroxide precipitate formation. The pH
of the soil is one of the important factors for the proper survival of the microbial
community and the production of essential nutrients from those microbes. pH of the
soil alters the nutrient availability in the soil (Neina 2019). The optimum pH for the
biodegradation of soil contaminants is at pH 7, which is neutral; it may range from
pH 6 to 8.
18.4.2 Temperature
The temperature has a major role in the biodegradation rate in enzymatic reactions
with microorganisms. The speed of the enzymatic reactions in the cell doubles for
every 10
C rise in temperature. There is a maximum temperature that
microorganisms can sustain in the environment (Neina 2019). The mesophilic
bacteria present in the soil are most predominantly capable of degrading the soil
contaminants at the optimum temperature of 25–45 C. A type of bacteria that can
survive in extreme temperatures is thermophilic bacteria found in hot and cold soil
areas. These bacteria can be activated to degrade the contaminants present in the soil
by increasing the temperature of the soil to 60 C. This approach is not always
possible in all environmental conditions but can be applied to some extent in areas
where the temperature is moderate to high. It has a disadvantage in the places, which
have the temperature low to mild conditions (Yi et al. 2017).
18.4.3 Water Condition
Redox potential plays a vital role in the solubility and bioavailability of heavy metals
in the soil. Water condition affects the redox potential in the agricultural soils. A ﬁeld
experiment was conducted to inspect the optimum pH and redox potential of soil
with the decrease of arsenic and cadmium in the rice ﬁeld. The above experiment
results illustrated that alternating irrigation with ﬂooding and drainage concurrently
reduced the accrual of arsenic and cadmium in agricultural soil. These may also
include an important limitation in restoring the contaminated agricultural soils by
reducing the remediation effects. Flooding with water increases the pH of the soil
with the decrease in redox potential, which will raise the negative charge on soil
18

particles allowing the heavy metals to get accumulated, and there will be a reduction
in mobility (Liu et al. 2015; Yi et al. 2017). The reduction in soil mobility will help
restore the contaminated agricultural soils.
18.5
Future Prospects of Agricultural Soil Restoration
The success of the agricultural soil remediation strategy lies in the quality and
quantity of the contaminant or pollutants present in the soil. The restoration is also
based on the geographical location and type of contaminant accumulated in the soil
(Kalsi et al. 2020). Single remediation would not be an effective one without having
any deterioration effect in the soil. To restore the contaminated agricultural soil
effectively, concoction (combining physical, chemical, and biological strategies) and
novel remediation methods by integrating more than one remediation method can be
used (Wang et al. 2021). Remediation methods explained in the above topics can be
used to design an efﬁcient restoration method to restore the lost agricultural soil
health, which will make the ecosystem healthy. Thus, ideal soil restoration strategies
guarantee environmental protection by using natural resources for proper soil reme-
diation, cost-effectively, and environmentally advantageous for society (Mench et al.
2006; Ayub et al. 2020).
18.6
Conclusion
Agriculture health determines the wealth of the country, and it also helps in human
development. Due to the expansion of industries, soil quality deterioration has
become the major issue of the environment. Agricultural soil pollution is caused
by several sources like agricultural, nonagricultural, and natural sources. The impact
of these sources is in ascending order with natural sources, agricultural sources, and
nonagricultural sources. The majority of the pollutants that affect agricultural soil
health are by human activities and causing the shrinkage of the agricultural land,
affecting food security. The vital contaminants of the soil are heavy metals like
mercury, copper, cadmium, zinc, arsenic, and organic compounds (PAHs, PCBs,
etc.). All these contaminants get accumulated on the soil and increase the toxicity.
This toxicity of the soil needs to be removed from the soil to keep the environment
stable. For these reasons, scientists and researchers have designed many remediation
methods of diverse physical, chemical, and biological methods. Each technique has
speciﬁc pros and cons, which can be applied appropriately for the varied types of
pollutants. Besides, environmental policies concerning the administration of soil
standards should center on implementing appropriate and integrated soil remediation
strategies to improve soil quality.

such
as
toxic
metals,
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalic acid esters, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),

Introduction
Biochar is a porous material, rich in carbon and essential functional groups, and
produced from raw materials such as biomass from other processes or different types
of waste. The use of biochar can signiﬁcantly alter an environment’s characteristics
contaminated by organic and inorganic compounds (Li et al. 2017; Cheng et al.
2020).
The applicability depends on the chemical composition of the biochar, which is
dependent on the production method. The biochar can have different functional
groups of bonds with carbon and oxygen, oxygen, and hydrogen, in addition to ester
groups that are responsible for increasing the adsorption capacity, increasing the
cation exchange rates, reducing the loss of nutrients, and spreading the plumes of
contamination in leaching processes (Majumder et al. 2019).
The production of biochar involves the pyrolytic conversion of organic biomass,
in a process characterized by scarcity of oxygen. Depending on the variability of raw
materials and production methods, some fundamental properties of the biochar may
vary, such as pH, the composition of functional groups, porosity, cation exchange
capacity, and surface area. These properties directly inﬂuence this agent’s behavior
in the remediation processes (Oni et al. 2019). The biochar has an alkaline pH,
around 8–11, cation exchange capacity ranging from 27 to 485 cmol kg1, and a
surface area of 140–336 m2, assigning properties of high reactive potential to the
material. It has a water-holding capacity of 75–257%, which can reduce leachate
generation in contamination processes (Xie et al. 2015; Ghosh and Maiti 2020).
In soils, the applicability of biochar can bring numerous beneﬁts, such as
increased plant growth and the remediation of different contaminants, in addition
to promoting changes in soil properties, such as correcting the pH of soils by
updating acids and adding nutrients (Gascó et al. 2019; Ghosh and Maiti 2020).
Among the contaminants that can be remedied by biochar are organic and inorganic
compounds, such as PAHs, pesticides, dyes, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (Yu et al. 2019), and among the inorganic ones
arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and
mercury (Hg) (Nejad et al. 2017). Remediation can occur through mechanisms such
as adsorption, absorption, immobilization, and microbial inﬂuence, in addition to the
properties of the soil and biochar.
The aim of this chapter is to synthesize the methods used in the production of
biochar and the recent advances in the application of biochar in the remediation of
different contaminants in the soil, summarizing the main methods used to improve
the structural and physicochemical properties of biochar to increase its potential for
remediation. Besides, consideration should be given to the biological and abiotic
processes that can alter the physical and chemical properties of the biochar and the

main applications and were presented as in soil amendment and composting, carbon
sequestration, wastewater treatment, and bioenergy relating the use of the biochar
with the sustainable development goals.
19.2
Biochar Production Methods and Characteristics
Among the most cited raw materials for the production of biochar for soil applica-
tion, there are rice husks (pyrolysis at 400 C, with a residence time of 5 h,
pH 10.19), wood husks, beet tailings (pyrolysis at 400 C, with a residence time
of 4 h, pH 11.9), residues of fruit clusters (pyrolysis at 600 C, the residence time of
6 h, pH 9.2), organic residues (pyrolysis at 500 C, with a time residence time of 5 h,
pH 9.4), and sludge from domestic sewage treatment plants (pyrolysis at 500 C,
with a residence time of 4 h, pH 8.1). These raw materials were converted and
showed yields of 22.1–37.4% biochar (Oni et al. 2019).
The main ways of producing biochar are through fast, intermediate, or slow
pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation, hydrothermal carbonization, roasting, and among others
(Rangabhashiyam and Balasubramanian 2019).
Pyrolysis involves temperatures between 500 and 1000 C, with a residence time
of fewer than 2 s. The intermediate pyrolysis performs the conversion at average
temperatures of 500 C, with a retention time of 10–20 s. In slow pyrolysis, the
process occurs at temperatures of 350–600 C with a retention time of 1–24 h (Liu
et al. 2015). Pyrolysis involves temperatures between 500 and 1000 C, with a
residence time of fewer than 2 s. The intermediate pyrolysis performs the conversion
at average temperatures of 500 C, with a retention time of 10–20 s. In slow
pyrolysis, the process occurs at temperatures of 350–600 C with a retention time
of 1–24 h (Cheng et al. 2020). In gasiﬁcation, the raw material comes into contact
with a mixture of gases at high temperatures (750–900 C), oxygen, nitrogen, and
carbon dioxide.
The dry raw material is oxidized, but this process can present a disadvantage
compared with the pyrolysis process, due to the possibility of formation of
by-products derived from burning at high temperatures in the presence of different
gases, with the formation of toxic substances, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons
and consequently a reduction in the yield of the biochar (Zhang et al. 2019). On the
other hand, hydrothermal carbonization uses temperatures ranging from 180 to
300 C and 2–6 Mpa pressures. The raw materials used do not require pre-drying
treatment. Compared with other conversion technologies, this process has
advantages in generating biochar with high purity, greater aromatization degrees,
and more signiﬁcant amounts of hydroxyl, carboxylic, and amino surface functional
groups (Kambo and Dutta 2015).
As mentioned, the conversion technologies are classiﬁed according to the heating
rates, with variations in temperature peaks, biomass exposure time, and reaction
atmosphere variability. The yield of biochar production is directly linked to these
processes. Combining strategies, raw materials, and biochar properties is required
19

for a fair production process and efﬁciency in the degradation of compounds (Ghosh
and Maiti 2020).
The pyrolysis of organic substances and their exposure to the environment lead to
oxygenation of the biochar surfaces. Oxygenated surfaces produce oxygen that
contains functional groups, including hydroxyl, carboxyl, phenol, and carbonyl
groups with high CTC and that break down organic contaminants into their
by-products. As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the COC of the biochar
increases and subsequently reduces, breaking the contaminants into small
compounds. Ion exchange is deﬁned as the process that functional groups containing
oxygen on the surface of the biochar, such as carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl
groups, can ionize H+ ions or surface ions, such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+),
magnesium (Mg+) for exchange with heavy metal ions or cationic organic
contaminants (Koul and Taak 2018). The biochar produced at high temperatures
and longer retention times is characterized for having a higher amount of P and K
and having higher levels of Ca, Mg, Si, Fe, Mn, and S, elements essential for plants’
development.
At lower temperatures (150 C), the groups most present are –OH, C¼O, C¼C,
and –COOH; for temperatures of 250 C, the groups C¼O and C¼C predominate;
and when the temperature changes to 350 C, the C¼C bonds are strengthened,
which remain present up to temperatures above 700 C (Cheng et al. 2020). This
abundance of functional groups promotes oxidation stability in the biochar, cation
exchange capacity, which, in turn, can act to control the leaching of soil nutrients,
managing the process of adsorption of contaminants from the soil matrix, an
essential factor for remediation processes. The elementary composition and action
of critical functional groups brings to biochar two essential elements directly linked
to soil remediation processes and mechanisms. These elements are the cation
exchange capacity (CTC) and the speciﬁc surface area (ASE), which vary according
to the pyrolysis temperature and the raw material (Weber and Quicker 2018).
The higher the exposure temperature of the raw material during the conversion
technique, the lower the CTC and ASE values. There is a reduction in functional
groups in these cases, which consequently reduces the CTC and ASE values. On the
other hand, at high temperatures (>600 C), the biochar structures’ predominant
functional groups provide negative loads to the material. These negative charges
directly inﬂuence the biochar’s behavior and interaction with loads of the soil and
different contaminants (Kavitha et al. 2018).
The pH of the biochar produced is also dependent on the temperature used during
the conversion technology and the raw material used. Generally, the biochar’s ﬁnal
pH is alkaline, which is why it is widely used in the correction of acidic soil
pH. Alkalinity is linked to organic functional groups, which improve soil properties,
changing pH, and cation exchange capacity. The biochar’s alkalinity can also be
connected to organic compounds, carbonates, and bicarbonates from the converted
raw material. Other organic alkalis, such as oxides and hydroxyls, which are
characteristic of being alkaline compounds and easily solubilized, may be present.
These play an essential role in controlling soil acidiﬁcation and different
contaminants’ degradation processes (Weber and Quicker 2018).

A. Rempel et al.

The elementary composition of the biochar varies between nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, and magnesium. With the use of raw materials such as poultry
manure, the C/N/P/K ratio is higher than that present in the biochar produced by
woody raw materials (Xie et al. 2015; Ghosh and Maiti 2020). This factor is essential
for applying biochar since when analyzing the application in soil remediation, the
biochar produced with higher C/N/P/K ratios presents advantages, as it facilitates the
development of plants, acting as an agent corrective (Ghosh and Maiti 2020).
Therefore, the use of raw materials from manure or sludge is more suitable for the
production of biochar when applied to soils since its conversion results in elementary
compounds essential to developing plants or correction of soils. These factors can
inﬂuence from beneﬁcial way soil remediation (Xie et al. 2015; Qambrani et al.
2017).
The presence of negative charges from the elemental composition and functional
groups raises the biochar’s pH values, bringing with it the ability to interact with the
elements of the environment where it will be applied. This interaction results in
adsorption reactions and different complexations of the contaminants, which results
in their degradation. Therefore, the temperature of pyrolysis and the choice of raw
material are essential for the future uses of biochar since they determine and
constitute the properties of the material, its elemental composition, pH, functional
groups, CTC, and ASE. In turn, these properties inﬂuence the biochar’s interaction
mechanisms with the soil and contaminants.
19.3
Potential Contaminants to be Treated by Biochar
The presence of contaminants in the soil can come from numerous sources.
According to the geochemical compositions of the soil and rocks, they can be natural
by sedimentation or volcanic eruption. However, the main concern with the soil’s
health and the local ecosystem occurs due to contamination from an anthropogenic
source through mining, agricultural and industrial activities, and gas and oil produc-
tion. Conventional treatments cannot remove many compounds that can reach the
soil through these activities, so the biochar presents favorable characteristics to
promote soli treatment (Palansooriyaa et al. 2020). Contaminants come from various
activities and sources and can be divided into organic or inorganic elements.
19.3.1 Organic Contaminants
Soil contamination can occur by numerous types of contaminants, such as PAHs
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), pesticides, dyes, polybrominated diphenyl
ethers, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Biochars can be used to treat
contaminated soils with organic compounds, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, due to the
adsorption material of these compounds through electronic interactions. Carbonized
fractions of coal act as adsorption sites and non-carbonized fractions as partitioning
agents (Yu et al. 2019).
19
Application of Biochar for Soil Remediation

Organic pollutants such as aromatics and chlorines are highly toxic. They can
cause damage to the biology of various plants, generating mutations and cancer cells,
in addition to being recalcitrant and harmful to microbial communities present in the
soil (Yu et al. 2019). Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a hydrophobic
compound that has a low rate of biodegradation. Its presence in soils represents
signiﬁcant risks to plant health since it can be bioaccumulative and have a high
toxicity. Organic dyes can destroy plant DNA structures, are resistant to biodegra-
dation, and are stable when exposed to sunlight (Yu et al. 2019; Kavitha et al. 2018).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of compounds within the
hydrocarbon family and have multiple fused aromatic rings (Zama et al. 2018). The
presence of high PAH concentrations in soils has increased over the last 30 years and
continues to grow more each year. This contaminant is more present in industrialized
regions and usually reaches the soil through atmospheric deposition after transport.
They are relatively stable elements, recalcitrant, and difﬁcult to degrade by conven-
tional methods. The PAH group contains more than 100 hazardous compounds
generated by incomplete combustion of organic materials, such as oil, coal, and
wood (Yu et al. 2019).
The adsorption mechanisms of hydrophobic organic compounds, such as PAHs,
usually occur in internal regions of the biochar, where it can happen through π–π
interactions between electrons within the aromatic rings of hydrophobic organic
compounds with the π electrons present in the biochar (such as C¼O and C¼C) and
aromatic compounds of hydrophobic organic material. PAHs are nonpolar hydro-
phobic contaminants, as are organophosphates and organochlorine pesticides. For
the remediation of more polar contaminants (nitrobenzene, pyridazine herbicides,
pharmaceuticals, etc.), polar groups must be present on the biochar’s surface
(Gomez-Eyles et al. 2013).
The removal efﬁciency of these compounds by the biochar performance can vary
according to coal production. Biochar produced by slow pyrolysis can be efﬁcient in
removing some organics contaminants due to the more signiﬁcant number of pores
and organic functional groups on its surface, interacting through hydrophobicity.
Chemical treatment by NaOH and coal composite with microorganisms can present
greater efﬁciency in the removal of PAHs. Besides, the microorganisms present in
the soil can be stimulated in the biochar’s presence, promoting the contaminant’s
microbial degradation (Zama et al. 2018; Ogbonnaya et al. 2016).
19.3.2 Inorganic Contaminants
The inorganic compounds most commonly found in contaminated soils are arsenic
(As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and mercury
(Hg) (Nejad et al. 2017). These compounds are highly toxic to the health of plants
and humans. They are absorbed by the roots and can accumulate within the plants
that eventually enter the food chain. Thus, biochar’s use decreases its bioavailability
in the soil, preventing it from causing more signiﬁcant damage to ecosystems
(Cheng et al. 2020). Unlike organic compounds, removal of inorganic compounds
408
A. Rempel et al.

can be performed only by immobilizing the contaminant by biochar, in which case
there is no degradation by microbial action. Biochars can complex metal ions on
their surface, reducing their bioavailability, but the immobilization of compounds
and essential nutrients for plants can also occur (Beesley et al. 2011).
The element arsenic (As) is an oxy-anion that represents signiﬁcant challenges for
soil remediation, and it is commonly found in the soil due to geogenic and mainly
anthropogenic action (Vithanage et al. 2017). Human activities that most impact the
disposal of this element on the ground are those arising from the use of pesticides in
agriculture, mining, and ﬂy ash disposal. Arsenic is a carcinogenic trace element
highly toxic to human health, fauna, and ﬂora (Yu et al. 2019).
The soil pH directly affects the As mobility. High pH values allow arsenic to bind
to local anions in the soil, such as iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and manganese
(Mn) oxides, and oxyhydroxides. Thus, the introduction of basic biochars in acidic
soils reduces this contaminant’s mobility (Beesley et al. 2011). Also, optimization
processes, such as impregnation of the biochar with iron oxides, can increase the
soil’s retention capacity through the anion exchange between the elements
(Kuppusamy et al. 2016). Many studies on the removal of As from aqueous medium
and the removal of this soil element are still challenging. Some techniques for
removing As from soil use phosphorus (which has chemical properties similar to
As) as a critical treatment factor, since the presence of phosphorus (P) in the biochar
can generate competition between soluble phosphate and As in the phase solid,
increasing the availability of arsenic in the pore water (Cheng et al. 2020).
Like As, chromium (Cr) is an oxy-anion compound with a double valence in
sedimentary systems and soils. It can be presented in trivalent (nontoxic) or
hexavalent form (highly toxic). Biochar can reduce the contaminant’s toxicity and
bioavailability and reduce Cr (IV) to Cr (III). Furthermore, this contaminant is more
easily immobilized by biochar in acidic conditions (Wang et al. 2018).
The Cr immobilization processes that can occur in its interaction with the biochar
are adsorption, reduction, or precipitation mechanisms. The contaminant will inter-
act with the functional groups present on the biochar’s surface, mainly by those that
have oxygen in their formation, such as CO, C¼O, –OOH, and –OH (Cheng et al.
2020).
Lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn) are divalent compounds
with similar behaviors, so it is suggested that their behaviors in the presence of
biochar also have the same characteristics (Wang et al. 2018).
Lead is the second most toxic heavy metal, after As. Pb can cause damage to plant
health in germination and yield, and its toxicity depends on time and concentration.
This metal can inhibit the enzymatic, photosynthetic activity, and the permeability of
the plant membrane, in addition to disturbing the water and nutritional relationships
available in the soil (Zulﬁqar et al. 2019). It is a challenging metal for soil remedia-
tion because it is highly insoluble in soil due to phosphates and carbonates’ com-
plexation (Yu et al. 2019). Due to this characteristic, it was identiﬁed that biochar
with P could immobilize the contaminant through electron donor–acceptor
interactions, ion exchange, precipitation, complex formation, and pore ﬁlling.
Thus, when compared with other heavy metals, Pb is relatively more straightforward
19
Application of Biochar for Soil Remediation
409

to immobilize due to the variety of mechanisms that can occur between biochar and
contaminant (Zama et al. 2018).
Several biochars were tested in the Pb-contaminated soil. It was observed that the
coal production with slow pyrolysis at a lower temperature (around 200 C) showed
promising results, probably due to the presence of P on its surface under these
conditions. The biochar from the green waste compound also showed good efﬁ-
ciency promoting immobilization by the covalent bonding of functional groups
containing N. Thus, the combination of these factors can have combined effects
on retaining this contaminant (Beesley et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2020).
For Cu removal, certain functional groups in the biochar, such as –OH, are
essential. The negative zeta potential found in biochar from chicken manure
promotes immobilization of the Cu by increasing the soil’s pH. Basic biochar can
promote the contaminant complexing with the elements present on the material
surface. Coal produced by wood and bamboo shavings promoted copper adsorption
by forming CuCO3 and Cu(OH)2. For cadmium, alkaline substances such as CO3,
PO4, and OH in the biochar increase the sorption capacity. The presence of more
than one contaminant, such as Cu and Zn, can affect their retention; immobilization
of more than one element in the functional groups present in the biochar can occur
(Cheng et al. 2020).
Mercury is one of the most dangerous contaminants with high toxicity, mobility,
and long residence time in the environment. Due to its geochemical characteristics
similar to the soil, including redox reactions, sorption and desorption, methylation,
and biological processes, it is difﬁcult to carry out its retention (Wang et al. 2018).
The characteristics of the biochar also determine the efﬁciency of its removal.
Functional groups on the surface containing oxygen have more signiﬁcant interac-
tion with Hg. Wood-derived biochars provide the formation of a COOHg+ complex
that reduces the mobility of Hg in the soil (Cheng et al. 2020).
19.4
Mechanisms of Interaction Between Biochar
and Contaminated Soil
The use of biochar as a strategy for the remediation of contaminated soils has
excellent advantages, such as an increase in the availability of nutrients present in
the soil, an increase in microbial activity, and an increase in soil organic availability
matter. Its application also reduces the use of fertilizers in soils, emission of
greenhouse gases, leaching of nutrients, and soil erosion. The application of biochar
in the remediation of contaminated soils has a simple technology to be applied and
suitable for a wide range of soil types. However, its large-scale application still
depends on economic viability and optimization of results (Ye et al. 2017). The
application of biochar involves different devices, such as sorption, microbial inﬂu-
ence, and its relationship with the properties of soils, such as the cation exchange
capacity, which is deﬁned by the total amount of cations retained on the surface of
the soil (Brady 1989) and pH, having excellent potential for sorption and delaying
the bioavailability of organic and inorganic contaminants (Koul and Taak 2018).
410
A. Rempel et al.

For inorganic contaminants present in soils, He et al. (2019) point out several
reactions that can, directly and indirectly, inﬂuence the treatment of heavy metals in
soils using biochar. As interactions directly involved between biochar and toxic
metals in soils, electrostatic attractions, complexation reactions, precipitation, and
ion exchange were mentioned. For the relationships indirectly involved, mention is
made of the biochar’s ability to change pH, CTC, mineral composition, and the
percentage of organic matter in the soil as inﬂuencing the mobility and bioavailabil-
ity of toxic metals.
Regarding organic contaminants, the application of biochar to remove them from
the soil is essential, mainly to treat fungicides, pesticides, and herbicides, including
atrazine, carbofuran’s, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene. The treatment of these compounds in
the soil involves several characteristics of biochar and chemical and physical
reactions of sorption, such as chemical transformation, attraction, electrostatic repul-
sion between electrons, and diffusion. Besides, most of the bound contaminants are
mineralized through biodegradation carried out by microorganisms present on the
surface and in the biochar’s microcores. The pH, pyrolysis, and proportion ratio
between the contaminant and the biochar also affect the interactions between organic
pollutants and the biochar (Oni et al. 2019). The main mechanisms of interaction
between contaminants and biochar are highlighted below.
19.4.1 Sorption and Adsorption
Physical adsorption indicates that the biochar uses its surface characteristics, called
porosity and speciﬁc surface area, so contaminants, such as heavy metals and
organic substances, can be absorbed on its surface and micropores. The diameter
of the contaminant ions, such as heavy metals, is generally smaller than the biochar’s
average pore diameter. Thus, the smaller the contaminant’s diameter, the more its
pores penetrate the pores of the biochar, increasing its adsorption capacity. The
intensity of physical adsorption is strongly correlated with the biochar properties
(as a speciﬁc surface area) and the properties and concentration of contaminants.
Temperature is also taken into account during the adsorption process (Yang et al.
2019).
The biochar has a high speciﬁc surface area. It is rich in porous regions that can
develop double surface properties, both negative and positive, indicating that the
biochar can adsorb negative and positive charges. Also, the valence of contaminants
can vary in the presence of biochar, producing different adsorption behaviors. This
phenomenon’s main reason can be attributed to the microbiological process because
biochar can stimulate microbial activities in soils and sediments (Wang et al. 2018).
The efﬁciency of the physical adsorption of the biochar is generally correlated with
the adsorption kinetics, adjusted by ﬁrst- and second-order models, and the adsorp-
tion process can occur in a single layer or in multilayer adsorption, where the model
of adsorption kinetics of Langmuir and Freundlich (Yang et al. 2019).
19
Application of Biochar for Soil Remediation
411

The adsorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants by biochar can, with high
efﬁciency, decrease the contaminant’s concentration in the aqueous phase. The use
of biochar reduces the availability of organic pollutants in the soil, sediments, and
ﬂooded soils. In this property, the minerals that make up the biochar are carbonates
(CO3
2), phosphates (PO4
3), sulfates (SO4
2), combined with heavy metal ions to
form water-insoluble substances, such as metal oxides, metal-phosphates, and
metallic carbonates, promoting the adsorption and immobilization of heavy metals
(Yang et al. 2019).
Sorption is considered a physicochemical process in which contaminants are
divided between the absorbent and aqueous phases. Some sorbent properties include
surface area, pore volume, size, CTC, pH, functional surface groups, molecular
structure, hydrophobicity, solubility, polarity, and critical factors in transferring
soil contaminant to the sorbent material (Zama et al. 2018).
The biochar’s structure and chemical composition are generally very well
correlated with its function as a sorbent. Large pore sizes and pore volumes with
high surface areas (greater than 100 m2 g1) mean that biochar has high sorption
properties. The pyrolysis temperature also inﬂuences the factor that determines the
pores’ distribution (including pore size and volume) and the property of speciﬁc
surface area. These properties make biochar a sorbent with qualities similar to
activated carbon but with its application focused on nonpolar substances (Koul
and Taak 2018).
The potential use of biochar as a sorbent material is advantageous since the
material has the mentioned properties, also having resistance to decomposition and
mineralization. Too important are the high availability and low cost of raw materials,
especially when using sources of agricultural by-products (bark, sawdust, and
bagasse) (Zama et al. 2018).
19.4.2 Interaction with Autochthonous Native Microorganisms
Changes in the properties of soils and sediments induced by the biochar can alter the
abiotic (nutrients, pH, and oxygen) and biotic systems (different habitats that can
lead to changes in the microbial community’s composition and structure). Wang
et al. (2018) indicate that studies involving the relationship between biochar and its
interaction with microorganisms are abundant, suggesting that microbial biomass
and microbial activity in soils and sediments are treated with biochar increase.
In general, the porous structure of the biochar can promote habitat for microbial
communities. The soluble organic carbon and other nutrients absorbed by
the biochar can provide substrates for developing microorganisms. Furthermore,
the addition of different biochar compositions leads to varying distributions of the
microbial communities associated with the nutrients adsorbed on the biochar’s
surface, which may increase or suppress the microbial community present on the
site (Wang et al. 2018).
The soil microbiota can be an indicator of soil quality and the extent of soil
contamination, that is, if the contamination has advanced and stabilized or if the
412
A. Rempel et al.

contaminant has been effectively treated. The porous formation of the biochar and its
ability to absorb organic carbons provides a medium in which microorganisms can
synthesize nutrients from the sorbed organic substrates. This can be considered why
it is reported that there is a correlation between the increase in microbial biomass and
activity in soils treated by biochar (Beesley et al. 2011). With soil contamination, the
biodiversity of microorganisms present on the site is usually compromised, mainly
due to the high concentrations of contaminants present in the soil. Thus, the
application of biochar in contaminated soils can help to preserve the biodiversity
of contaminated soils.
The use of biochar affects microbial activity, and the increase in biomass alters
the rate of fungi and bacteria present in the soil and the soil’s enzymatic activity.
According to Zhu et al. (2017), the biochar can inﬂuence microbial activity posi-
tively or negatively as follows: the biochar provides shelter for microorganisms
through pore structures and soil surfaces or nutrients and ions essential for microbial
growth, which are adsorbed in the biochar particles; the biochar can present a
potential for toxicity with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and free radicals
persistent in the environment.
Also, biochar can modify the natural habitat of microorganisms, improving soil
properties essential for microbial development, such as aeration conditions, water
quality, and pH; it can induce changes in enzymatic activity that affect the soil cycle
that is related to microorganisms; the biochar can interrupt microbial inter- and
intraspeciﬁc communication between microbial cells through the combination of
sorption and the hydrolysis of signaling molecules; the biochar can increase the
sorption and degradation of soil contaminants, reducing the bioavailability and
toxicity for the microorganisms present.
19.4.3 Other Interaction Mechanisms
Other mechanisms of interaction between the biochar and the contaminant present in
soils can be identiﬁed, such as oxidation and reduction phenomena, exchange of
nutrients, and carbon sequestration.
Oxidation and reduction reactions in the soil are essential, as they regulate the
solubility of many elements, creating compounds and altering the soil’s biochemis-
try. The addition of the biochar causes these reactions to intensify and can remedy
contaminants in the soil. The application of biochar increases soil porosity while
reducing soil density. Soil pores contain aqueous and gaseous fractions and are
essential for the occurrence of toxic and anoxic reactions (Koul and Taak 2018).
Arsenic, for example, is one of the metals that has less toxicity in its reduced form
(As(III)) under anoxic conditions when compared with As(V) formed under oxic
conditions. Reduction conditions can develop in the soil pores due to increased soil
aeration, resulting in reduced arsenic valence. Oxides have a high afﬁnity for heavy
metals, forming covalent bonds or ionic bonds (Koul and Taak 2018).
Iron oxide is well known for its interaction with heavy metals. It can be used in
soil remediation and metals such as arsenic, mercury, chromium, lead, and selenium.
19
Application of Biochar for Soil Remediation
413

The organic carbon present in the biochar has been reported to have the ability to
oxidize and reduce arsenic and cadmium in their less toxic forms, such as As(III) and
Cd(VI). The effects of different forms of iron oxides, such as iron salts, red mud, or
by-products, containing iron in contaminated soils were evaluated, observing that
iron oxides increase the immobilization of trace elements present in the soil (Koul
and Taak 2018).
The exchange of nutrients is a chemical process where cations and anions are
stabilized in the soil instead of undergoing a leaching process. The cation exchange
capacity (CTC) is the primary indicator of the soil’s ability to absorb cations. Soils
with high CTC are generally considered fertile soils because they can absorb
nutrients. Anion exchange commonly occurs in positively charged locations due to
the dissociation of hydroxyl ions from iron hydroxide ions, minerals present in the
clay, and amino groups present in the soil’s organic matter (Singh et al. 2017).
19.5
Removal of Contaminants from Soil by Adding Biochar
Many studies have been developed to remove various contaminants from the soil by
biochar and have good removal efﬁciency, both for organic contaminants and for
inorganic contaminants (Gai et al. 2014; Oni et al. 2019; Mukherjee et al. 2011).
In removing organic contaminants, several contaminants were analyzed. Soils
contaminated with carbofuran had removal rates of 65 and 80% with biochar
produced from beet waste and fruit bagasse (Mukherjee et al. 2011; Zimmerman
et al. 2011). Atrazine and triﬂuralin had removal rates of 61.54–65.06% and
62.50–72.35% in soils treated with wheat straw biochar (Nag et al. 2011).
Insecticides such as cypermethrin had 82.18% of their content removed when the
biochar was associated with a consortium of bacteria, showing how there can be a
biodegradation of these contaminants by the action of microorganisms both present
in the soil and together with coal (Liu et al. 2018).
Table 19.1 shows some other studies carried out in removing inorganic
contaminants and the main mechanisms of interaction between the contaminant
and the biochar during remediation.
Through Table 19.1, it can be seen that several raw materials and pyrolysis
temperatures are used in the manufacture of biochar, resulting in a variety of
materials with different characteristics for the treatment of contaminated soils.
Some biochar optimization processes are also used, thus generating better efﬁciency
in speciﬁc contaminants (Gonzaga et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2017; Gao et al. 2019). In
this way, biochar is a new prospective material with the potential to increase soil
quality and minimize the harmful effects of organic and inorganic contaminants on
soil quality (Oni et al. 2019).

An Overview of Other Environmental Applications
of Biochar
In addition to the possibility of using biochar in remediation processes of soils
contaminated by organic and inorganic compounds, there are several other environ-
mental applications of biochar, such as carbon sequestration, reduction of green-
house gas emissions, waste management, wastewater treatment, renewable energy,
and soil amendment (Kuppusamy et al. 2016; Oni et al. 2019; Qambrani et al. 2017).
This variety of potential uses is due to the biochar’s physicochemical properties
(Nanda et al. 2016). In this sense, biochar is considered as an alternative technology
with the potential to mitigate environmental and food problems in contemporary
society (Tang et al. 2013). In the following items, different environmental
applications of biochar will be synthesized to provide an overview of its
potential uses.
19.6.1 Soil Amendment and Composting
One of the primary uses of biochar is soil improvement since they increase carbon
storage, fertility, and soil quality. Simultaneously, it can immobilize and transform
contaminants present in this environmental compartment, which increases the yield
of crops (Kalus et al. 2019; Nanda et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2017). This potential is
fundamental nowadays since, with population growth, there is a greater demand for
food, directly dependent on agriculture (Kavitha et al. 2018).
The use of biochar for agricultural purposes is due to its composition, containing
carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium, which can
result in an increase in the amount of organic matter and nutrients that are favorable
to plant growth (Kavitha et al. 2018; Nanda et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2019; Yuan et al.
2019). Besides, the biochar increases soil aggregates’ stability and the water holding
capacity, improving the soil’s physical properties (Kavitha et al. 2018). Yuan et al.
(2019) also report that biochar can improve the physical, chemical, and biological
properties of salt-affected soils.
High resistance to microbial decomposition and high retention capacity of essen-
tial nutrients for plants are some aspects that make the use of biochar for agricultural
purposes viable (Nanda et al. 2016). However, this effect can vary according to some
factors, such as pyrolysis temperature, feedstock, soil type, and biotic interactions
(Kavitha et al. 2018). Zhu et al. (2017) reported that biochars produced at high
pyrolysis temperatures tend to have better positive effects from the point of view of
fertility, since biochars that have a higher ash content may result in better cation
exchange capacity of the soil, facilitating the maintenance of nutrients to the biotic
community of this environment.
Regarding biotic interactions, Kavitha et al. (2018) emphasize that biochar’s
application creates a favorable environment for the development of soil microbiota,
which consequently favors plants’ growth. These authors also report that biochars
19

inﬂuence the soil’s enzymatic composition and mitigate plant stress, beneﬁcial in the
agronomic context.
Soils that receive biochar application can reduce nitrogen (N) leaching,
preventing high concentrations of this element from reaching water bodies and
causing eutrophication (Tang et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2019). According to Yuan
et al. (2019), the reduction of N leaching does not reduce its bioavailability for plants
since biochar can improve this nutrient’s efﬁciency, favoring the development of
crops.
However, it is necessary to consider the appropriate amount of biochar to be used
in the soil since an excessive application of biochar can inhibit the nutrient content
and, thus, not favor the growth of crops (Kuppusamy et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2019).
Kuppusamy et al. (2016) list some negative points that can occur from the use of
biochar for soil amendment that must be considered: (1) binding and deactivation of
herbicides and nutrients in the soil, (2) excessive supply of nutrients, (3) increase in
pH and electrical conductivity of the soil, (4) adverse effects on germination and soil
biological processes, and (5) release of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons present in the biochar.
Biochar has some beneﬁts concerning economic aspects since payments for
sequestration of carbon dioxide combined with higher productivity of crops make
this technology economically attractive to rural producers (Oni et al. 2019). Besides,
water and nutrient retention caused by adding biochar to the soil can result in minors
with irrigation and fertilizers (Oni et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2019).
Biochar has another important environmental application in the context of soil
amendment and waste management, as it can be produced from agricultural wastes
and used in composting processes, one of the leading technologies used for the
treatment of organic solid wastes (Gopinath et al. 2020; Kalus et al. 2019; Tang et al.
2013; Wang and Wang 2019). The addition of biochar in composting is a viable
approach since the decomposition of waste is faster and, at the end of the process, an
organic compound rich in nutrients is obtained, which can be used as a biofertilizer
for different crops (Gopinath et al. 2020; Wang and Wang 2019).
19.6.2 Carbon Sequestration
The concern about climate change is rising, especially concerning reducing carbon
dioxide emissions, as this is one of the leading gases that contribute to climate
change (Oni et al. 2019; Nanda et al. 2016; Wang and Wang 2019). Biochars are
considered a potential alternative to performing carbon sequestration to the soil (Oni
et al. 2019; Wang and Wang 2019; Zhu et al. 2017). In addition to soil amendment
applications, biochar can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and
remove oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in air puriﬁcation
uses (Kavitha et al. 2018; Nanda et al. 2016; Oni et al. 2019).
The performance of biochar as a carbon sequestering agent, mainly CO2 from the
atmosphere, is due to its ability to retain larger amounts of stable carbon in the soil
when compared with other uncharred organic matter (Nanda et al. 2016). The
418
A. Rempel et al.

maintenance or increase of carbon in the soil is advantageous for improving the
quality of agricultural soils. The reduction of GHG emissions decreases the agro-
industrial sector’s contribution to global warming (Kuppusamy et al. 2016; Nanda
et al. 2016).
According to Wang and Wang (2019), biochar’s performance as a carbon seques-
ter varies according to feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions. Biochars produced at
high pyrolysis temperatures are the most suitable for carrying out carbon sequestra-
tion. They have a more stable carbon structure and a higher C/N ratio, making them
recalcitrant to microbial decomposition (Zhu et al. 2017).
However, the effect of using and applying biochar for carbon sequestration
purposes is not entirely elucidated (Wang and Wang 2019). Kuppusamy et al.
(2016) consider that, although biochar is regarded as a potential carbon sequester,
studies show adverse effects of biochar, especially on ecological needs.
Nanda et al. (2016) list some factors that must be considered to elucidate the real
effectiveness of different biochars in carbon sequestration and, consequently, in the
reduction of GHG emissions: (a) GHG emissions associated with the production of
biomass; (b) release of CO2 and energy consumption during logistics operations
(production, harvesting, and transportation of biomass); and (c) energy consumption
during pretreatment, conversion of biomass, and ﬁnal product processing. Therefore,
it is essential to apply methodologies, such as life cycle assessments, that provide
accurate information about biochar’s real impact in reducing GHG through carbon
sequestration.
19.6.3 Water and Wastewater Treatment
Providing clean and safe water is a current concern because this resource is funda-
mental to human activities. However, with the advancement of detection techniques,
numerous contaminants are present in aquatic environments in concentrations
around the planet. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to develop treatment
technologies to provide suitable quality water for various uses.
Biochar is an emerging and alternative technology for the treatment of water and
efﬂuents since it can adsorb organic and inorganic contaminants in aqueous matrices
due to functional groups and charges on the surface of the biochar (Qambrani et al.
2017; Xiang et al. 2020). Biochar is commonly used to remove heavy metals,
organic pollutants, and nutrients from wastewater (Xiang et al. 2020). According
to Qambrani et al. (2017), biochar’s performance as an adsorbent for different
contaminants is similar to that of activated carbon, differing in terms of raw
materials, production method, and physicochemical properties of the material.
Some factors directly inﬂuence the adsorption capacity of contaminants by
biochar, such as temperature and pyrolysis time, as these affect the biochar’s
physicochemical properties (Gopinath et al. 2020; Wang and Wang 2019). The
effectiveness of biochar in removing contaminants from aqueous media depends
on its surface area, pore size, functional surface groups, and the molecules’ size to be
removed (Enaime et al. 2020). Wang and Wang (2019) emphasize that the recycling
19

419

and reuse capacity of biochars must be considered when applied to the treatment of
aqueous matrices. These factors increase the economic and environmental viability
of their use for this purpose.
19.6.4 Bioenergy
Energy is fundamental to human activities and economic development, and its
demand increases with the increase in the world population (Nanda et al. 2016;
Oni et al. 2019). Among the energy sources, fossil fuels are one of the most used, but
they can cause several adverse environmental impacts (Nanda et al. 2016; Nazari
et al. 2020). Fuels from biomass are considered an alternative and sustainable source
of energy and are based on converting carbohydrates present in the biomass of
plants, residues, or microorganisms into biofuels (Nanda et al. 2016; Oni et al. 2019).
These biomasses can be converted into biochar, bio-oil, and syngas (Oni et al. 2019).
During pyrolysis, part of the biomass carbon is stable in the biochar. Still, there is
also the production of liquids and gases with high energy density with the potential
for generating heat and energy (Nanda et al. 2016). According to Nanda et al. (2016),
the amount of energy released from biomass during pyrolysis may be more signiﬁ-
cant than combustion. Oni et al. (2019) report that the two main products (syngas
and oil) obtained from the biomass pyrolysis process can be used as an energy source
since the syngas presents the possibility of being used as an input during pyrolysis,
while the oil can later be transformed into biodiesel.
Syngas from thermochemical conversion of biomass contains CO, H2, CO2, and
volatile hydrocarbons, which can be turned into fuels (Nanda et al. 2016; Xiong et al.
2017). Xiong et al. (2017) reported that biochar increases hydrogen production
during pyrolysis/gasiﬁcation of biomasses. Biochar can also be used as a catalyst
to produce biodiesel (Xiong et al. 2017; Wang and Wang 2019) and as a substrate for
the anaerobic digestion (Gopinath et al. 2020).
19.6.5 Relationship Between Biochar and Sustainable
Development Goals
The 2030 Agenda, adopted by all United Nations countries, contains 17 sustainable
development objectives (SDGs) created to protect the environment and guarantee
health, education, and income so that all people can live with prosperity (United
Nations 2015).
As presented throughout this chapter, biochar has several applications, such as
soil amendment and remediation, carbon sequestration, bioenergy, water and efﬂu-
ent treatment, and air puriﬁcation. Therefore, this emerging technology can have a
positive impact on several SDGs. The biochar production stage can impact SDG
9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and
communities), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) since
obtaining the biochar requires aspects of innovation to make its use more viable.
420
A. Rempel et al.

In contrast, biochar can be produced from solid organic waste, making it a more
sustainable approach to waste management in cities and industries.
When used in the correction and remediation of agricultural soils, biochar can
increase crop productivity and, thus, favor food security and sustainable agriculture
(SDG 2—zero hunger), increase the income of agricultural producers (SDG 8—
decent work and economic growth), and make the soil healthier for the terrestrial
ecosystem (SDG 15—life on land). Regarding the application in the treatment of
water and efﬂuents, biochars favor SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 3 (good
health and well-being), and SDG 14 (life below water) since they remove
contaminants that can affect public health and the aquatic ecosystem.
The production of bioenergy from biochar favors the achievement of SDG
7 (clean and affordable energy) and SDG 13 (climate action) by reducing the demand
for fossil fuels and, thus, reducing GHG emissions and provide renewable energy.
The use of biochar for gas puriﬁcation can positively impact SDG 3 and SDG
13 since it removes nitrogen and sulfur oxides, preventing them from being emitted
into the atmosphere. Finally, biochars’ ability to perform carbon sequestration can
directly impact SDG 13 by reducing GHG emissions. Still, it can also indirectly
favor SDGs 2, 8, and 15. Maintaining more signiﬁcant amounts of stable carbon in
the soil can increase crops’ yields, improve the local economy, and make the soil
healthier for terrestrial ecosystems. Figure 19.1 summarizes all the SDGs that can be
positively impacted by the biochar’s production and environmental applications.

Conclusions
Because of the presented, it is concluded that biochar production from residual raw
materials is a current theme. It still needs studies to arrive at greater generalizations
and use about its use; because of the abundance of materials that can be used and the
factors that can lead to biochar production, as the temperature during pyrolysis and
the heating rate as the main factors, characterization studies of these materials are
required. Likewise, a wide range of compounds can be removed or immobilized
from liquid or solid media using biochar. Still, the relationships that are established
in the liquid and solid phases, chemically and physically, are not yet well elucidated,
being a challenge for the consolidation of this technique, and to study the life cycle
involving these process and the recycling of these materials, when used for remedi-
ation in liquid media. Biochar studies, therefore, consist of opportunities and the
need for current science.

Abstract
Applying organic materials such as biochar has been aimed at removing water
contaminants due to the overall low production cost, easy handling, and genera-
tion of renewable wastes after the application. Biochar materials have been
proposed to remove metal contaminants and pharmaceutical compounds. Fur-
thermore, such application ranges can extend to microorganism control, espe-
cially enteric viruses that require speciﬁc detection and control procedures. Water

pathogens present a constant but increasing worry in agriculture systems, threat-
ening to contaminate an entire production chain and the adjunct population
through a single contaminated source. In this approach, studies have presented
promising results in the retention of bacteria and viruses through biochar, com-
bined or not with additional materials ﬁlters, further increasing the relevance of
such compounds in water and wastewater sanitation.

Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria by
Biochar-Based Materials
Biochar is a ﬂexible, cheap, and highly accessible material, managing to cover a
wide range of contaminant retention capabilities using only quickly produced
materials and low-cost enhancements. Such products have an increasing demand
as a renewable utensil in treating different waste sources, especially in low-income
communities or industries that produce many wastes and require further use for the
byproduct of organic matter. Still, most studies only cover biochar that used to treat
bacterial pathogens and inorganic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and
metals, with few pieces of literature covering viral pathogens responsible for a
wide range of diseases. Several experiments managed to archive expressive amounts
of containment of viral indicators using biochar-based materials, whether using
enhancements like common sanitation materials and treatments or not, highlighting
that this material may be used as a viable alternative in viral contaminations.
20.1.1 Enteric Viruses Need Control
The global need for clean water is a constant challenge as the world population
grows exponentially. Enteric pathogens are often found in the water, easily spread
via fecal–oral transmission in low sanitation areas. Furthermore, gastrointestinal
illness can lead to death if left untreated. Viral diseases are also problematic for
crops and not just for humans, acting as many rural populations income. Some types
of cultivations, such as cowpea grain or rice, provide low-cost and nutritious food for
low-income communities. A wide diversity of viruses affects the agriculture indus-
try, causing an annual loss of millions of dollars. Viruses are the second leading
cause of plant diseases after fungi. Some examples are the tomato spotted wilt virus
(TSWV), cowpea mottle virus (CMeV), and tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV); in
general, diseases caused by a viral agent are far more complex to manage (Aliyu
et al. 2011; Florey and David 2012; Zeshan et al. 2018; Bonanomi et al. 2020).
The wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes is applied mainly for plants’
services, such as retrieving nutrients. Unfortunately, the spread of pathogens can
428

often occur when untreated or improperly treated wastewater is used. Different
strategies have been studied; organic amendments are a material that improves its
properties when added to the soil. Many agricultural wastes can be used in this sense;
some can even control plant infections (Aliyu et al. 2011; Perez-Mercado et al.
2019).
On the other hand, one of the biggest threats to public health concerns is the
human enteric viruses (HuEV). These viruses are fecal–oral and are responsible for
several diseases (gastroenteritis, enteric hepatitis, conjunctivitis, meningitis, and
others). Some of them, especially rotavirus, are important causes of diarrhea in
children in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), annually worldwide, 600 million people get ill after ingesting contaminated
food, resulting in 420,000 deaths, 125,000 of these covering children under ﬁve.
Diarrheal disorders are the main burden caused by a large sort of pathogens, being
driven primarily by rotavirus, Campylobacter spp., and Shigella spp. at 1-year-old
children and Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., and pathogenic Escherichia coli at
2-year-old children. Other common diarrheal pathogens include norovirus, Yersinia
spp., and non-typhoidal Salmonella (Donowitz et al. 2021; WHO 2015).
Environmental contamination of viruses is a severe threat to human and animal
health. Viral pathogens need a relatively low dose to start an infection, and because
they are very resistant in the environment, they are responsible for several outbreak
diseases. Discharges of rural and urban runoff have a vital role in the contamination
of these environments. Furthermore, many enteric virus species remain infectious
after passing through wastewater station treatments. They may contaminate water
supplies and crops. Bacterial monitoring is generally the only microbiological
parameter required for attesting water potability and bathing worldwide. However,
there is no correlation between bacteria and enteric virus presence (Bosch et al.
2005).
There are over 100 types of HuEV that are present in sewage-contaminated
waters, that are capable of causing different types of diseases in humans, that
includes hepatitis A and E; gastroenteritis, e.g., norovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus,
and adenovirus; respiratory illness, e.g., coronavirus and meningitis; poliovirus;
and coxsackie (Bosch et al. 2005).
Bacteriophages are also found continuously in treated and untreated sewage.
Since they are not pathogenic to humans, bacteriophages are primarily used in
tests as an enteric viral indicator. Bacteriophages MS2 and ɸX174 are the most
used for this purpose; ɸX174 has an icosahedral shape and is classiﬁed as a
coliphage since it attaches itself to the host cell wall. In contrast, MS2 has the
same condition but it is called an f-speciﬁc bacteriophage to infect the bacterial cell
by its sex pili. Different from MS2, ɸX174 has been showing a high rate of
adsorption to ﬁlter media. Although MS2 studies showed low adsorption levels, it
is still considered a suitable model organism for HuEV (Bosch et al. 2005; Molaei
2014).
One of the essential enteric viruses capable of causing health problems in humans
is the Mastadenovirus (early called adenovirus), belonging to the family
Adenoviridae, in which the genera Mastadenovirus comprehend the viruses that
20

429

infect mammals (ICTV 2019), being these eliminated in feces, urine, or respiratory
excretions. The early infection occurs in the pharynx mucosa, conjunctiva, and even
in the intestinal mucosa, causing different clinical features in the respiratory, gastro-
intestinal tract, and other organs (Knipe and Howley 2013).
Rotaviruses, another type of enteric viruses, are members of the family
Reoviridae. Rotavirus A is the main species involved in outbreaks by rotaviruses
and is responsible for most diarrhea cases in children under 5 years old. This virus is
zoonotic, and it is very stable in manure and animal waste (Knipe and Howley 2013).
Picornaviridae
family
has
three
genera
(Enterovirus,
Kobuvirus,
and
Hepatovirus) that have species associated with water/foodborne diseases. Enterovi-
rus genus multiplication occurs primarily in the gastrointestinal tract; however, this
genus has species that cause infections in other tissues. They may cause gastroenter-
itis, respiratory diseases, encephalitis, and others, depending on the speciﬁc tissues’
viral tropism. Among the species that cause human diseases, this genus comprises
enterovirus species A–D and rhinovirus species A–C. Rhinovirus causes respiratory
diseases (Elrick et al. 2021). The most studied enterovirus (an enterovirus C) is
poliovirus, which was the cause of poliomyelitis pandemic worldwide. Aichi virus is
a Kobuvirus that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Several Aichi
virus infections have already been reported in various continents, South America,
Asia, Africa, and Europe (Rivadulla and Romalde 2020). Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is
also a picornavirus, Hepatovirus genus, but causes enteric hepatitis. After Norovirus,
it is the most frequent foodborne virus associated with shellﬁsh-contaminated
consumption (Romalde et al. 2017). Genotypes AI, BI, AII, BII, AIII, and BIII
infect humans. The viruses infect small intestine cells and hepatocytes but replicated
predominantly within the liver, and disease may run more severely, with fulminant
hepatitis, in adults (references). Hepatitis A accounts for half of the global hepatitis
infection (Bosch et al. 2005).
The Norovirus genus, the Caliciviridae family, is responsible for the majority of
foodborne gastroenteritis. Several outbreak diseases were reported associated with
bivalve mollusks contamination. Because these animals are ﬁlter feeders, they retain
viruses present in seawater inside their organs. Especially Norovirus can persist for a
long time in these animals (Guyader et al. 2012). The risk is increased because some
species of mollusks are eaten raw or lightly cooked.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is another cause of enteric hepatitis. It belongs to the
Hepeviridae family and causes epidemic hepatitis in low- and middle-income
countries. In these places, waterborne transmission is mainly, but in industrialized
countries, it infects humans through consumption of meat from viremic animals
(Purdy et al. 2017). HEV is a zoonotic virus and can contaminate crops through
contaminated manure, mainly with swine waste (feces and carcasses).
Astrovirus is the common name from the viruses that represent the family
Astroviridae. They are the third most frequent causative agent of human gastroen-
teritis, especially in young children (Bosch et al. 2005; Fongaro et al. 2015).
These viruses are diverse in terms of their properties since they do not belong to
the same family but somewhat different ones. Genome type (single- or
double-stranded RNA and single-stranded or double-stranded DNA), capsid
430
E. B. de Souza et al.

structure, etc. tend to be quite diverse as there is a wide variety of enteric viruses
(Table 20.1).
Rotavirus tends to cause a high mortality and hospitalization per infection in
countries undergoing development, while hepatitis A accounts for half of the global
hepatitis infection. Such diseases have a fecal–oral route of transmission. This means
that insufﬁcient quality water and low sanitized food have an essential role in
maintaining these infections (Bosch et al. 2005).
Viral contaminants are generally more persistent to disinfection, and their capac-
ity to adsorb to solid particles protects the virions from inactivating factors (Florey
and David 2012; Fongaro et al. 2015). HAV and HEV have persisted for many
weeks in the soil (Parashar et al. 2011) since their unique viral features make these
particles more resistant to typical techniques of pathogens removal, such as their
capacity to adsorb to solid particles, protecting the virions from inactivating factors
(Florey and David 2012; Fongaro et al. 2015).
Enteric viruses also can be a bioindicator of sanitary security, being essential tools
to guarantee quality water for drinking or even agricultural use. Because of this,
some of them were included in the Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (USEPA 2016).
Therefore, developing new methods and tools for pathogen removal, especially on
farms and crops, is needed. Manure is a precious source of nutrients, which could
lower farm costs. However, viral pathogens’ presence in the waste makes its use
inviable (Fongaro et al. 2015; Perez-Mercado et al. 2019).
20.1.2 Biochar Uses for Virus Control
Organic amendments improve the soil’s physical, chemical, and biological
parameters and act as a suppressor against a large microbial diversity, like
oomycetes, fungi, and bacteria, which are already known. Still, little information
about its activity in viruses is available, especially on an on-farm scale. Also, in

Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar

bioﬁlters, the addition of organic amendments such as biochar has already been
determined a potential enhancer in pathogen removal (Florey and David 2012;
Afrooz et al. 2018; Kranner et al. 2019; Bonanomi et al. 2018, 2020).
Some studies suggest that microbiome diversity is one of the primary
mechanisms modulating viral removal. Bonanomi et al. (2020), comparing classic
soil management (mineral fertilizers and fumigation) with the use of organic
amendments (especially biochar) in soil, found that organic amendments were
responsible for the change of bacterial and fungal microbiome and also reduced
the TSWV infection symptoms in plants. A couple of pieces of evidence suggest that
beneﬁcial bacteria can mitigate viral diseases in plants, from Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens control TSWV in tomato plants to Paenibacillus lentimorbus controlling
cucumber mosaic virus in Nicotiana tabacum (Bonanomi et al. 2020).
Wang et al. (2013) demonstrated a signiﬁcant alteration in the denitrifying
bacteria population due to N2O-producing bacteria diminished as the N2O consump-
tion enhanced, such phenomenon occurred after an amendment with biochar on a
composting experiment using pig manure, wood chips, and sawdust. This happened
by shifting the microbiome and changing soil features, such as quality in terms of
nutrients available to plants, improving the organism growth, strengthening bio-
chemical mechanisms, and increasing the plant resistance to ﬁght off the viral
infections (Zeshan et al. 2018). Cui et al. (2016) described a considerable reduction
of antibiotic-resistant genes after the application of different kinds of biochar. The
authors suggest that the results may correlate with the differential diversity status
proportionate by applying the organic amendment, with a decrease in speciﬁc taxa of
bacteria that can carry antibiotic-resistant genes.
Ye et al. (2018) associated biochar with bacteriophages in the treatment of soil–
plant systems. The researchers performed biochar treatment coupled with a polyva-
lent bacteriophage. They were applied in a soil–lettuce system due to the high
amount of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in
agricultural soil–plant systems. They observed that after 63 days of incubation, the
amount of E. coli K-12 (tetR), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (ampR + fosR), and
their antibiotic resistance genes decreased signiﬁcantly ( p < 0.05), showing very
similar results to the ones obtained in lettuce tissues after treatment.
Afrooz et al. (2018) investigated the potential of bioﬁlters amended with biochar
to remove human pathogens (such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and
Staphylococcus aureus) and the indicators microorganisms E. coli and MS2 coli-
phage. The group concluded that biochar-amended bioﬁlters had achieved better
outcomes than sand ones in tests aiming to remove microorganisms from
stormwater. The authors also suggest that electrostatic interactions were the
mechanisms that proportionate viral removal, with interactions between MS2 nega-
tive surface charges and biochar. Unlike the essay mentioned earlier, Sasidharan
et al. (2016) found negligible effects on bacteria and virus removal from biochar
amended sand. Afrooz et al. (2018) argue that the solution’s chemistry can explain
this difference. While Sasidharan et al. (2016) used NaCl electrolyte solution,
Afrooz and his lab team used synthetic stormwater with natural organic matter.
The coliphages’ surface charges differ between both studies, and biochar properties
432
E. B. de Souza et al.

are also deviant factors. In other words, physical entrapment in small pore spaces is a
factor that can be disregarded for viruses when it comes to biochar since viral
particles are relatively smaller than biochar pores (Afrooz et al. 2018; Perez-
Mercado et al. 2019; Sasidharan et al. 2016). These conﬂicting results showed that
there is still a need to conduct further research to elucidate the limitations and
possibilities of using biochar in pathogen control.
Kranner et al. (2019) noted that biochar amendment of sand bioﬁlters was
responsible for improving the removal of fecal contamination indicators; the group
compared with sand and biochar-amended sand bioﬁlters during 61 weeks. In this
study, F+ coliphage MS2 removal was enhanced by the biochar amendment. The
authors discussed that these results agree with another previous analysis, even
suggesting that the increase in removal efﬁciency compared with sand occurs
because of biochars’ surface area, which is larger than sand, providing additional
sites to pathogens attachment. This argument is by the ﬁndings of Florey with David
(2012). Florey and David found that biochar activated with KOH, which has the
most signiﬁcant surface area, exhibited the most efﬁcacy in pathogen removal. The
authors also detected no effect from biochar derived from corn stove pyrolysis in
removing MS2 coliphage from PBS when no activation process was done. It was
stated that the sorption efﬁciency could not be attributed only to the measure of the
surface area since other variations of activated biochar did not show this pattern; e.g.,
ZnCl2-activated biochar (surface area 611.15 m2/g) exhibited more excellent
removal than H3PO4-activated biochar (surface area 703.78 m2/g).
Gerba et al. (1975) afﬁrmed that enteroviruses are adsorb in media surfaces with
high organic matter presence and low pH. Also, the author observed that poliovirus
is removed from wastewater by adsorption on activated carbon, especially at low
pH. Soluble organics in the sewage compete with viral particles for adsorption in the
activated carbon sites. These experiments used sewage with low organic matter
concentration, treated with lime coagulation, or reduced the pH, archiving optimal
viral adsorption. The amount of virus adsorbed was 25 times greater in sewage with
low pH values than at the level usually found in secondary efﬂuent.
Perez-Mercado et al. (2019) evaluated the effect of biochar ﬁltration as an
on-farm treatment for irrigation with wastewaters, measuring the viral, bacterial,
and oocystis indicators removal at high hydraulic loading rate and electric conduc-
tivity. They found that the removal efﬁciency was reduced with the increase of the
hydraulic loading rate, except for the oocysts. They saw no effect by the electric
conductivity, but the results indicate that the effective biochar particle diameter was
the principal factor for pathogen removal. The bioﬁlter with biochar was efﬁcient in
removing Saccharomyces cerevisiae but inefﬁcient in bacterial and viral indicators.
The authors suggested that the hydraulic loading rate can be optimized to provide a
more efﬁcient microbe removal.
A study conducted by Molaei (2014), which aimed to compare the efﬁciency of
four different types of ﬁlters (biochar, bark, activated carbon, and a mixture of bark
and activated carbon) to remove viral and bacterial indicator organisms from
graywater, found a lower reduction of the viral indicators in comparison with
bacteria. This happened because of the size of viral particles, which are smaller
20
Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar
433

than the bacteria. Due to that, bacteriophages have competed for the adsorption sites
with bacteria and organic particles, decreasing the chances of viruses being
adsorbed. Electrostatic interactions, the isoelectric point of the viruses, and the
biochar’s speciﬁc surface area were also important variables that affect viral
removal. Size particles interfere in the number of electrostatic charges. This number
is lower when particles are small, ultimately reducing the particle’s afﬁnity to the
ﬁlter media.
Bacteriophage ɸX174 isoelectric point is higher than MS2. This characteristic
gives MS2 a more signiﬁcant amount of harmful charge sites than all ﬁlters tested
since the isoelectric point dictates the attachment of small-sized organisms (espe-
cially those smaller than <60 nm) to the surface of solid particles. Biochar and
activated carbon ﬁlters showed a relatively high reduction (4 and 6 log10) in the ﬁrst
week of the experiment. After that, a decrease in the retention efﬁciency of the viral
indicators was observed. Activated carbon ﬁlters have the most signiﬁcant surface
area, more positively charged particles, and more adsorption-free sites. These
characteristics promote better efﬁciency by this ﬁlter than the compared ones.
Generally, MS2 had a lower reduction than ɸX174, but the ﬁlter followed the
same pattern for both bacteriophages. A worrying data is the release of viruses
from ﬁlters after several days, but not bacteria, implying a risk of releasing viruses in
the environment. Complementary studies should be performed to avoid the problem
(Molaei 2014).
In some viruses, such as TLCV, biochar was proposed as an alternative to
pesticides. In this assay, the group of Zeshan et al. (2018) treated tomato plants
with different quantities of biochar, and as a result, they found that biochar signiﬁ-
cantly diminishes disease severity. Mechanisms proposed for this effect range from
improved nutrients to beneﬁts in the change of the soil’s physical properties respon-
sible for enhanced resistance in plants due to plant growth and beneﬁts in biochemi-
cal mechanisms accountable for plant defenses (Zeshan et al. 2018).
Among the already documented beneﬁts of biochar performance in the crop, there
is the ability to increase the pH of soil due to the alkaline characteristics, detoxify
allelopathic and xenobiotic substances, improve the soil water holding capacity, and
stimulate the growth and development of beneﬁcial microbes, and there are still
some studies that report the ability to suppress diseases that affect plants (Jeffery
et al. 2011). The biochar can provide porous soil structures that physically protect the
microbial colonies from pastors or predators, such as mites, protozoa, collemboli,
and nematodes (Bonanomi et al. 2020).
The effect of biochar amendment on the extent of bacterial retention has been
observed to depend on the type of biochar and soil. For instance, Abit et al. (2014)
examined the effect of biochar addition on the transport of bacteria in sand and soil
columns. They observed that soil texture chronically affected bacteria recovery
percentages, with lower bacterial retrieval in sandy soil than in ﬁne sand. For the
uncorrected treatments, the recovery percentages of both bacteria (E. coli and
S. typhimurium) in the sandy soil columns was 3.3 orders of magnitude lower than
in the ﬁne sand columns (Abit et al. 2014). This can be explained due to the presence
434
E. B. de Souza et al.

of exposed positively charged groups at the edges of the clay crystals, causing the
negatively charged bacteria to be attracted (Fletcher and Loeb 1979).
During a study carried out by Aliyu et al. (2011), it was possible to state that a rice
husk, grounded into powder, can control diseases that affect cowpea, a food crop
essential to the subsistence of the communities through West Africa. The cowpea
plants, infected with the cowpea mottle virus, had increased growth and yield when
the soil was previously treated with rice husk powder. This result is an excellent
indicator that the rice husk powder can be used as a soil corrective to improve
growth, productivity, and suppression of viral diseases in infected cowpea plants.
This effect is possibly due to a competitive advantage of plants that grow in
corrected soils characterized by increased photosynthetic activity.
Besides all the beneﬁts as mentioned above and positive effects for plants in
agriculture based on the use of biochar and biochar-amended bioﬁlters to provide
drinkable clean water, besides other uses, data is still limited to lab scale. Evidence
of on-farm viral removal is still insufﬁcient to say that the outcomes collect in
lab-scale studies could be translated to a large scale situation, especially when
considering some data that found a signiﬁcant amount of microorganisms remaining,
which can lead to unintentional contamination of the environment and population
(Kranner et al. 2019; Perez-Mercado et al. 2019).
20.1.3 Enterobacteria and Environmental Control
With the advance of the human population, the food production process needs to
expand to meet demand. The growing need for more food results in the accelerated
conversion of natural landscapes into cultivated ﬁelds and pasture areas.
Accompanying the growth of areas aimed at raising cattle, swine, and poultry,
there was also an expansion in the volume of waste generated, with thousands of
liters of waste containing remnants of antibiotics, hormones, and enteric
microorganisms being produced daily. Without planning for the correct waste
destination and treatment, these contaminants are discarded in the soil. The contact
with the water used to irrigate the ﬁelds or wash the farm will direct them to the
surrounding springs and water bodies, contaminating the whole water system. As
they are inﬁltrated through water into the region’s soils and water sources, contami-
nation by pathogens becomes challenging to be treated, as the source of contamina-
tion will not be at a speciﬁc point, occurring in all places of contact with water bodies
(Abu-Ashour 1994).
Enteric bacteria that compose these animals’ intestinal microbiota usually have
resistance to the environment’s unfavorable conditions, remaining stable for an
extended period outside the animal tract. Thus, when incorrectly disposed of in
soils, the bacteria present in these wastes will contaminate groundwater and other
sources, causing risks to all organisms that depend on this water source. According
to the data from the WHO, approximately 500 thousand children under ﬁve die each
year from diarrheal diseases, such as gastroenteritis caused by enteric bacteria, being
the second causer that kills the most children of this age group (WHO 2017).
20
Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar
435

The Enterobacteriaceae family is the most common gram-negative bacteria that
affect the intestinal microbiota of humans and animals. Although some species are
found harmlessly inhabiting the human intestinal tract, such as E. coli, in an
immunocompromised person, physical integrity can increase the bacteria number,
generating infection even by nonpathogenic strains. When colonizing the intestinal
tract, the most at-risk species are classiﬁed as enteropathogenic and are represented
by the genera Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia (Santamaría and Toranzos 2003).
Salmonella is a genus of enteric bacteria with worldwide distribution. It
comprehends a large number of serotypes with different speciﬁcities capable of
infecting a wide variety of hosts. In addition to being one of the leading causes of
intestinal diseases worldwide, it is an enterobacter that is capable of generating more
compromising conditions, such as typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Like other enteric
bacteria, Salmonella spp. is disseminated through the fecal–oral route by ingesting
contaminated water and food, demonstrating the importance of ensuring that
the water sources used to supply residences and agricultural demand are following
the bacteriological quality standard. This microorganism is frequently found in the
environment, reaching water sources directly, through the contact of contaminated
human or animal feces, or indirectly, through the incorrect disposal of urban sewage.
Salmonella’s presence has already been detected in different water sources, such as
rivers, lakes, beaches, aquifers, and even in waters that have already undergone
the treatment process. Due to its frequent presence in environmental samples, the
consequences of infections in humans, and its high capacity to survive outside the
host and to form bioﬁlms, bacteria of the genus Salmonella are a signiﬁcant health
concern (Levantesi et al. 2012).
As well as E. coli, bacteria of the genus Enterococcus are also usually present in
human and other animals’ intestinal tract and are excreted at high rates in the feces.
Due to its high excretion rate, a frequent presence in the environment, and relation
with human health issues, its presence in water sources is a reliable indicator that
contamination by wastes is occurring and, consequently, by other enteric organisms
that may be pathogenic (Boehm and Sassoubre 2014). Bacteria of the genus Shigella
are genetically related to E. coli and Salmonella and can cause similar pathologies.
Enterobacteria is also transmitted through the fecal–oral route, and the development
of the condition known as Shigellosis starts from a low infectious dose. It can
generate severe cases of inﬂammatory diarrhea (Lampel and Maurelli 2003).
These are just a few examples of enteric pathogens present in contaminated water
and food, representing a risk to the population’s health. This data demonstrates the
necessity to prevent these enteric pathogens from reaching water sources or soils
destined for food cultivation.
The transport of these microorganisms across the soil surface to underground
layers will depend on several factors, such as the soil’s physical and chemical
properties and the interaction with the presence of other microorganisms. One of
the main properties that inﬂuence the inﬁltration of bacteria by the soil is related to its
texture. Depending on the size of the particles that make up the soil, it will have a
more compact or lighter structure, generating differences in the transport ﬂow of
these pathogens through their layers (Abu-Ashour 1994). In the same way that the
436
E. B. de Souza et al.

soil characteristics inﬂuence the transport of bacteria, it can facilitate the contamina-
tion of water sources. Management techniques that alter the soil qualities will affect
this transport and dissemination, preventing these pathogens’ displacement.
With the transformation of natural landscapes into urban areas full of buildings
and facilities, the advance of waterproofed soils over the spaces remains with
vegetation. The compaction and waterprooﬁng generated by the construction of
roads have adverse effects on rainfall. By preventing water from inﬁltrating and
spreading through the soil, it causes the rainfall to be carried to water bodies taking
all the roads’ pollutants. The retention systems perform as a solution to improve
urban areas’ ﬂow and overcome problems such as ﬂoods and water source contami-
nation. These systems are made up of mixtures of sand, soil, husks, and other
compounds that promote rapid water inﬁltration into the soil. They also act as
bioﬁlters, retaining microorganisms contained in soils or inﬁltrated waters. How-
ever, there is a need for further development in bioﬁlters, as they have limited
efﬁciency in removing enteric bacteria, such as fecal coliforms. Still, some ﬁlters
carry out the mobilization of bacteria, but that do not succeed in retaining and
releasing these pathogens back to the soil when there is a ﬂow of inﬁltrated water
(Mohanty and Boehm 2014).
20.1.4 Biochar Uses for Enterobacteria Control
One of the most used bioremediation techniques of contaminated soil and water is
activated carbon, whose adsorbent properties remove the contaminants present in the
environment. A more proﬁtable management alternative is the use of biochar as a
removing agent because although it is also a porous structure composed essentially
of carbon, the raw material used in its production is abundant and has a low cost,
with alternatives such as crop residues, animal waste, forest residues, remnants of
paper mills, food production, and sewage sludge (Cantrell et al. 2012). Other
advantages of using biochar are the need for lower temperatures for organic matter
degradation compared with activated carbon and not needing to undergo activation
processes. However, despite having a more accessible production than activated
carbon, the biochar’s physical and chemical properties will inﬂuence its operation in
removing contaminants.
An alternative to improve these systems’ retention capacity is the inclusion of
biochar in bioﬁlters, as they can remove, in addition to fecal coliforms, heavy metals,
and organic contaminants from contaminated soil water. Mohanty et al.’s (2014)
study of the E. coli removal capabilities of standard ﬁlters and ﬁlters implemented
with biochar demonstrated how the water decontamination rate could be improved
with biochar’s addition to the ﬁlters. Inoculating water containing E. coli in different
ﬁltration systems, Mohanty et al. obtained 95  1% removal of the pathogen using
sand ﬁlters implemented with 30% biochar. By inoculating the same contaminated
solution in ﬁlters composed only of sand, the removal of E. coli dropped to 35  6%.
Therefore, this study demonstrates the improvement in pathogen removal generated
by the inclusion of biochar in the ﬁlters that compose the bioretention systems.
20

However, as already elucidated, the properties of the biochar and the characteristics
of the matrix where it will be applied interfere with its efﬁciency, requiring previous
studies to establish which method best relates to the desired application and thus
obtain better results in removal of contaminants (Mohanty and Boehm 2014).
Biochar acts as a ﬁlter through its porous structure, retaining microorganisms that
came into contact with the material. The efﬁciency of the system will depend mainly
on the adsorption capacity of the material composing the biochar. Still, its function-
ing will also be inﬂuenced by organic origin issues, such as bioﬁlms’ formation and
structural origins, such as the surface area and the pores’ size and distribution. The
presence of bioﬁlms in the biochar composition can simultaneously generate
advantages and disadvantages. Simultaneously, they change the standard pore
diameter, increasing the variety of bacteria and viruses that the biochar will retain,
thus improving its role in removing contaminants. It can also create an ideal
environment for the growth of enteric bacteria, whose replication can increase the
environment’s contamination rates. In addition to including heterogeneity in the pore
diameters, bioﬁlm formation also changes the patterns that inﬂuence the water ﬂow’s
hydrodynamics inﬁltrated into the biochar. One of the main components that char-
acterize bioﬁlms is extracellular polymers, substances that can change the texture,
hydrophobicity, and electrokinetic properties of biochar surfaces. These biochar
structure changes will affect the relationship between the contaminating organisms
and the adsorbent pore, thus changing the efﬁciency in removing pathogens. The
bioﬁlms in the biochar are only advantageous when the bioﬁlm’s growth is
contained, as the accelerated colonization will reduce the adsorption process until
the biochar loses its bioremediation property (Afrooz and Boehm 2016; Perez-
Mercado et al. 2019).
Despite the increasing demand for biochar used as bioremediation of
contaminated areas, most studies still focus on evaluating the properties and effec-
tiveness of this system in soils, with few studies related to its application in water
sources, sewers, and treatment plants. When it comes to disinfecting water sources,
the main techniques used still are chlorination and ozonation, which are methods that
generate chemical residues such as trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids
(HAAs), formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde, products known to be carcinogenic to
human and toxic to the aquatic environment and the species involved (Park et al.
2016). The use of biochar is an alternative that presents less risk to the environment,
being a sustainable method of removing enteric pathogens and other contaminants
from water sources. One way to use the wastewater produced daily is to apply it to
irrigation, providing water and nutrients for cultivated plants. However, wastewater
often contains pathogens that can remain viable for a long time outside a host and
represent a risk of contamination by consuming food irrigated with this water.
Depending on the purpose for which the biochar application is intended, the
association with other compounds can increase the system’s efﬁciency in removing
various contaminants, both organic and inorganic. The antibacterial copper capacity
has already been elucidated through several studies. Still, its direct application as a
treatment agent for contaminated environments presents impasses mainly in its
subsequent removal from the treated environment (Dankovich and Smith 2014).
438
E. B. de Souza et al.

The application of metal derivatives for decontamination generally occurs by
handling particulate material, making it difﬁcult to remove after treatment and can
cause health problems for the population that consumes these waters. The frequent
aggregation of copper particles in a liquid medium is also responsible for reducing
the removal process’ efﬁciency that impairs water quality recovery. In addition to its
antimicrobial action, copper oxide, like iron oxide, also attracts attention due to its
ability to remove arsenic from groundwater, a highly toxic compound in its inor-
ganic form (Goswami et al. 2012; Hao et al. 2018). Metal oxide nanoparticles are
produced at a low cost due to their availability in the environment. Their physical
and chemical properties, such as the presence of a large adsorbent surface area and
functional groups for the binding of toxic ions, make these compounds essential
allies in the bioremediation of soils and waters contaminated by chemical entero-
pathogenic bacteria. Studies that explore the effects of bioﬁlters with metal oxides
show promising results in the production and application of this ﬁltration system.
Because it is a stable material and insoluble in water, biochar is the right candidate
for accommodating metal particles. Its easy separation of residues from the treatment
process solves the issue of removing nanoparticles from the environment and
presenting reasonable rates of reduction of the two classes of contaminants
(Priyadarshni et al. 2020).
The Nivedita Priyadarshni experiment was conducted using biochar derived from
rice husk, posteriorly treated with solutions of iron chloride (FeCl3) and copper
chloride (CuCl2). During the biochar incubation with its respective solutions, the
content was slowly agitated to produce iron and copper oxide nanoparticles using the
coprecipitation method. To evaluate the improved biochar’s efﬁciency in removing
contaminants, a mixture of the biochar under both treatments was brought into
contact with solutions using natural groundwater containing coliforms and over
different concentrations of arsenite and arsenate. The adsorption of pollutants by
treated biochar occurred quickly, reaching 95.3% removal of substances composed
of arsenic in 60 min. To evaluate the effect of the biochar in removing bacteria, water
samples were inoculated on agar plates before and after treatment. While the plaque
referring to the contaminated samples showed the growth of 13 bacterial colonies,
the plaque with treated water inoculum indicated only one colony present, which
means an insigniﬁcant bacterial contamination rate in the water. The colonies of both
plates were tested to determine the bacteria’s nature through a traditional gas
production test in Durham’s tube containing lactose broth. The bubble production
indicated that they were coliform bacteria. The recovery of the biochar implemented
with metal oxides was tested by washing the residues from the treatment process
containing the retained arsenic with alkaline water and sodium chloride solution,
obtaining a signiﬁcant recovery of the biochar ﬁve washing cycles. The possibility of
recovering the bioﬁlter and the metal oxide nanoparticles guarantees the decontami-
nation of the medium, including the remains of the products used in the treatment
process, in addition to reducing implementation costs. Through images performed
by ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy technique, it was possible to con-
clude that the improvement in the adsorption of contaminants generated by the
20
Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar
439

association with the nanoparticles of metals was due to a greater volume of pores and
the greater surface area acquired after the treatment (Priyadarshni et al. 2020).
From studies such as Priyadarshni’s, it is possible to show how the development
of ﬁlters that associate materials with limited decontaminating capacity can increase
the rate of pollutant removal in general, being more efﬁcient than when applied
individually. The removal of 92% of bacteria and 95.3% of arsenic compounds from
a natural water sample demonstrates how two different ﬁltration systems’ adsorption
properties can be combined to improve their productivity and achieve better results
in retaining compounds frequently associated with environmental pollution. In
addition to presenting consistent results in eliminating undesirable substances and
organisms, the association of biochar with metal oxides solves the recovery of the
material after treatment. When nanoparticles are attached to the structure of the
biochar, the metal oxides are quickly recovered. The possibility of reusing the ﬁlter
on other occasions can also positively affect treatment cost, generating applications
in other contaminated areas. Just as other studies have already evidenced the
antibacterial action of copper, there are antimicrobial compounds that in association
with stable materials such as biochar can generate an increase in the efﬁciency of the
system, thus developing appropriate methods for bioremediation of environments
with different contamination proﬁles (Priyadarshni et al. 2020).
The advantages of applying biochar as a tool for bioremediation of contaminated
environments include economic factors, through the low cost of raw materials used
in its production; environmental factors, as it is a biodegradable resource that
sequests atmospheric carbon; and practical issues, such as diversity of applications
that can be beneﬁted through management using biochar. The residues containing
enterobacteria that jeopardize the quality of water and soils and the surrounding
ecosystem’s integrity come from waste related to agricultural activities and homes,
industries, and businesses. The use of biochar is a viable application in various
treatment systems and is a cost-effective option that reduces decontamination costs.
Therefore, the possibilities of using biochar surpass its use as bioremediation in
contaminated environments and can also be applied in treatment systems,
guaranteeing water quality as to the presence of enteric pathogens, and in drainage
systems as a solution to soil waterprooﬁng in urban centers.
20.2
Environmental Challenges and Use of Biochar: Case
Studies
Many countries still rely on the road system as the primary means of transporting
people and cargo, which implies a gradual increase in the need for paved roads and
the extension of the territory to meet the growing demand for fast and reliable
transportation. Despite signiﬁcant importance in the national economy, road con-
struction also creates disadvantages, especially for the environment. The land needs
to be compacted for the construction of roads, which results in the removal of local
vegetation and the consequent interference in the regional environment diversity.
After being opened and compacted, the roads are produced with waterprooﬁng
440
E. B. de Souza et al.

substances, which, together with the lack of vegetation and soil settlement, will
generate impacts on the region’s rainfall. The number of vehicles related to
individuals who use the road system daily implies an increase in the amount of
waste and pollutants discarded on the highways. When coming into contact with
rainwater, these wastes will end up being washed to water bodies due to the
waterprooﬁng of roads and compaction of the surrounding soils. In addition to
increasing the volume of organic matter and waste in these water sources, these
pollutants may contain residues of feces, carcasses, and other wastes, containing
pathogens such as viruses and bacteria, representing a risk of contamination (Cambi
et al. 2015).
Aiming to reduce the impact of soil sealing by roadway constructions, road
border ﬁltration systems are being developed to improve rainwater drainage and
ﬁlter the pollutants carried by the inﬁltrated water. These structures are bioﬁlters,
composed mainly of a mixture of soil, sand, and carbon-rich compounds in
proportions that will depend on the desired application. One of the main challenges
of implementing these bioﬁlters for rainwater drainage from roads is soil compac-
tion, related to the prevention of landslides and trafﬁc accidents, but negatively
inﬂuences water inﬁltration. When added together with the bioﬁlter, certain
materials can reduce soil compaction on water inﬁltration and increase the efﬁciency
in removing contaminants, as is the case with biochar. To evaluate the differences in
the efﬁciency of E. coli removal in sand ﬁlters and sand ﬁlters implemented with
biochar and the impact of compaction on the ﬁlters, the researcher, Maryam
Ghavanloughajar, carried out an experiment testing the removal of the inﬁltrated
contaminant in the two systems of bioﬁlters (Ghavanloughajar et al. 2020).
In the Ghavanloughajar experiment, bioﬁlters were kept in containers with a
column shape and hollow bottom, where mixtures of biochar, sand, and garden
compost were kept. Periodically, a solution of artiﬁcial rainwater inoculated with
E. coli was added to the top of the columns, and a sample of the residue that dripped
down was collected. In addition to analyzing the functionality of retaining
contaminants from bioﬁlters with and without biochar, soil compaction was also
analyzed about the effects on the degradation of biochar particles. The results
showed that removing E. coli was increased in the bioﬁlters that contained a
consortium of biochar and sand and pointed out a greater efﬁciency of the biochar
in compacted bioﬁlters. This factor can be attributed to a greater surface area for
microbial adsorption created by breaking and simplifying the biochar particles, as
shown in Fig. 20.1. The functionality of the bioﬁlter was, once again, maximized in
columns that contained the mixture of biochar, sand, and compost because, in
addition to generating a more efﬁcient removal of pathogens, the compost increased
the ﬂow rate and water inﬁltration. Thus, the experiment proved how the association
between different materials and biochar could improve the efﬁciency in removing
pathogens and generate the possibility to customize this tool’s use to best suit the
remediation situation (Ghavanloughajar et al. 2020).
The use of biochar amended ﬁlters for water treatment on a full scale implies the
inclusion of several factors that must be considered. Stormwater produced in
laboratories for use in experiments does not contain the same properties as natural
20
Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar
441

stormwater and has chemical pollutants and microorganisms in its composition. At
the same time, rain still transports contaminants present in the soil. Therefore, what
will be ﬁltered by the bioretention systems is water with a considerable content of
organic matter capable of competing with the enteric pathogens present in the
adsorption sites of the ﬁlters (Mohanty and Boehm 2015; Kranner et al. 2019).
Conventional bioﬁlters are usually based on either compost or sand sources and
are widely used due to the relatively low price, easy manufacturing, and overall great
disponibility. However, such ﬁlters alone do not provide a reliable removal of
bacteria and viruses on a scale that allows safe use of the wastewater after ﬁltration.
More importantly is that even if such utensils can ﬁlter most of the high size
pathogens, such as bacteria and amebas, a small contend of living bacteria can be
enough for the wastewater to be considered as the untreated source by federal health
organizations that manly analyze the bacterial content of the liquid medium. This is
even without considering the low retention that these ﬁlters can offer in treating
viruses’ particles usually accounted for in sanitation regulations (Afrooz et al. 2018).
Standard sand ﬁlters amended with biochar powder were used in the treatment of
typical, not as highly organic mass dense, water sources like stormwater, as was
observed in the study realized by Afrooz et al. (2018), which previously measured
for E. coli, S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and MS2 coliphage. Compared
with standard sand ﬁlters, biochar powder’s addition achieved retention over nine
Fig. 20.1 Effect of compaction on the efﬁciency of removing contaminants in associated ﬁlters
442
E. B. de Souza et al.

times higher than that of the target bacteria and three times higher than that of the
MS2 bacteriophages. This method not only is a cheap and straightforward method to
enhance the ﬁltration capability using highly accessible biochar materials that
allowed a dramatic immobilization of bacterial pathogens but also exhibited signiﬁ-
cant retention of smaller structures such as viruses, possibly implying a useful and
accessible way to amplify the retention of different viral families, which usually
escape most ﬁltration methods.
The characteristic of hydrophobic nature of the biochar appeared to be responsi-
ble for a signiﬁcant part of the attraction between the material and the bacteria, for
the rate of removal matches the hydrophobic nature of each bacteria, being Staphy-
lococcus aureus the most hydrophobic, and therefore, the one that showed more
signiﬁcant adsorption in this study, followed by S. enterica and then E. coli. Such
characteristics may also explain the increased adsorptive rate of viruses after biochar
application. Such organic material’s hydrophobic and electrostatic properties may
enhance the entrapment of even small viruses like MS2. Fine particles of the biochar
for the amendment in sand ﬁlters also appeared to have allowed a hydrophobic
attachment and straining, facilitating pathogens’ removal. However, one must
beware that ﬁner particles can clog the ﬁltering mechanism. Therefore, such con-
junct technology may still require further observations and improvements (Afrooz
et al. 2018).
The experiment by Perez-Mercado et al. (2019), aiming to recreate a model of
farming wastes treatment, used hardwood biochar-based ﬁlters to achieve a signiﬁ-
cant difference in the reduction of bacterial and viral pathogens (such as E. coli,
Enterococci spp., Bacteriophage MS2, Bacteriophage ɸX174, and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae). Such a decrease was mainly attributed to the particle diameter of the
powdered biochar, with the smallest diameter of 1.4 mm, compared with the highest
of 5.0 mm, which achieved an overall more signiﬁcant reduction of bacteria and
viruses. In this study, the ɸX174 bacteriophage signiﬁcantly reduced the treatment
compared with the MS2 virus. Such a difference in the removal rate can be again
attributed to the different isoelectric points and hydrophobicity. Another issue that
may heavily inﬂuence the ﬁltration potential in these systems is the hydraulic
loading rate (HLR), which was the most determinant factor in the retention potential
than the biochar diameter when the ﬁrst one was present at higher levels
(200 L m2/d), reducing the adsorptive potential when compared with lower levels
(34 L m2 d1). This inﬂuence is implied due to the high ﬂow of matter, impairing
the contact time between biochar and pathogen, for the ﬂux of medium is too intense
for the electrostatic interactions to form between the pathogen and subtract. There-
fore, a low HLR would allow a more signiﬁcant surface contact opportunity between
particles, resulting in an increased adsorptive rate. Similar to how the lower diameter
of biochar particles grow the surface area and pores, causing an increase of adsorp-
tive sites for planktonic pathogens, lower HLR levels increased the absorptive
surface by allowing bioﬁlms to form, allowing the retainment of pathogens, and
increasing the probability that such pathogens may interact with the adsorptive sites.
In this way, viral and bacterial removal may be impaired in systems with high HLR,
20

443

requiring thin powdered biochar to compensate for the lost adsorptive potential if
aimed at high demanding treatment systems (Perez-Mercado et al. 2019).
Another factor disregarded in laboratory experiments is the probable formation of
bioﬁlm in the ﬁltration systems, considering that microorganisms’ deposition is
facilitated through the water ﬂow. The appearance of bioﬁlms in ﬁlters modiﬁed
with biochar can increase or diminish its efﬁciency in removing pathogens, and its
consideration in a large-scale application is fundamental (Mohanty and Boehm
2015; Kranner et al. 2019). In addition to the rate of organic matter in rainwater
and the probability of bioﬁlm formation and issues often overlooked in ﬁltration
tests, biochar’s behavior when in alternate irrigation and drought regimes should
also be included in the analyses approaching a natural rain cycle. The intermittent
ﬂow of water will reﬂect on the retention of microorganisms, as pathogens trapped in
the biochar pores during the drought period can be detached during the next ﬂow of
water. Despite the signiﬁcant effect of the interspersed ﬂow cycle, most experiments
still base their results on tests with a continuous ﬂow of water, thus moving away
from the actual application conditions. When considering these three factors, the
content of organic matter, formation of bioﬁlms, and regime interleaved between
rains and droughts, it is possible to verify the authentic effectiveness of these
bioretention systems in removing pathogens on a full scale (Mohanty and Boehm
2015; Kranner et al. 2019).
Considering these factors related to the large-scale application of bioretention
systems, better results of removing enteric pathogens in ﬁlters amended with biochar
are still obtained compared with standard ﬁlters composed of sand. To simulate the
use of this ﬁltering and decontamination model in the environment for which it was
developed, with good long-term performance, simple sand ﬁlters and sand ﬁlters in
conjunction with biochar in a 2:1 ratio went through about 60 weeks of tests under an
intermittent water ﬂow regime. The water used, unlike most experiments, was not
artiﬁcial water produced in the laboratory but natural stormwater implemented with
wastewater. The indicator of fecal contamination used was E. coli. Even competing
with the high rate of organic matter present in the stormwater used, the biochar’s
porous surface still obtained better results in removing the bacteria than ordinary
sand ﬁlters. After the testing period, the ﬁlters were deconstructed to make it possible
to seek a formation of bioﬁlms and determine whether their presence inﬂuenced the
ﬁltration system’s efﬁciency (Kranner et al. 2019).
Similarly to this study, another experiment further analyzed bioﬁlms’ inﬂuence in
retaining bacteria in an artiﬁcial porous structure ﬁlled with glass beads. The
retention of E. coli was higher when the porous material was covered in the naturally
formed drinking water bioﬁlm. The bioﬁlm also expressed signiﬁcant retardation in
adrift bacteria’s movement, as these have the activity slowed down by covering
organic matrix. The cells immobilized or retarded by the structure remained in the
ﬁlter system longer. Therefore, the cells were more likely to be immobilized by the
pores and other reactive surfaces of the material (Bauman et al. 2009). In that case,
the presence of bioﬁlm in a biochar ﬁltration system may not always be considered a
liability and treated as a typical “dirt” clogging the mechanism, primarily if the
present bioﬁlm consists of a nonpathogenic organism like a free water bacteria. Such
444
E. B. de Souza et al.

organic structures may, in numerous cases, indeed help the immobilization and assist
in biochar retention mechanisms, being a viable asset in pathogenic control.
Bioﬁlm inﬂuence in the retention of microorganisms is not restricted to bacteria.
Bioﬁlm-covered spheres, for example, achieved noticeable retention of 28B Salmo-
nella bacteriophage together with Legionella pneumophila bacteria in pretreated
drinking water by Långmark et al. (2005). Granting a persistence for over 38 days
of the contaminants in the organic matrix, allowing for the contaminated bioﬁlm to
be discarded and, by doing so, removing an expressive amount of a target virus.
Also, an insight that a bioﬁlm’s colonization in a determined surface is based on the
bioﬁlm characteristics and surface structure. One must know the particular features
of both factors for the functional biochar surface to maintain strong interaction with
the polysaccharide bioﬁlm matrix’s speciﬁc traits. For example, in this study, it was
noticed that the subtract’s physicochemical properties showed a more signiﬁcant
inﬂuence in the adsorption of pathogens than the bioﬁlm density, having hydrophilic
spheres demonstrated more excellent retention than hydrophobic ones.
However, bioﬁlm-enriched biochar ﬁlters have also been shown to decrease the
overall adsorptive potential in some studies. In an experiment by Afrooz and Boehm
(2016), biochar amended sand ﬁlters, as was previously expected, allowed more
retention of E.coli compared with regular sand ﬁlters; however with the presence of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa bioﬁlm matrix, the effect of these two types of ﬁlters was
the opposite, with sand ﬁlters exhibiting a signiﬁcant increase in the retention of E.
coli when enhanced with a bioﬁlm, while the bioﬁlm–biochar presented a decrease
in the absorptive capability. Due to the large surface area, rough, porous structure,
and higher hydrophobicity compared with sand, the biochar material’s unique
characteristics were also attributed to the higher retention and bioﬁlm density in
biochar amended sand ﬁlters compared with regular sand ones.
Bioﬁlm presence may act as a surface enhancer by increasing the reactive sites for
anchoring planktonic bacteria, especially in sand substrates, which have an overall
lower area than biochar. However, this mechanism can be negligible in biochar
systems. The material’s extensive surface is not signiﬁcantly increased by adding a
few reactive sites to be considered a noticeable percentage. In fact, due to no small
part of the reactive surface is based on the porous structure, that potential can be
diminished by the incorporation of a bioﬁlm, for the matrix impregnation in the
porous may decrease the attractive sites to planktonic bacteria and the porous offer a
considerable amount of adsorptive sites (Afrooz and Boehm 2016).
In an insight of the interactions that rule over the particles and the biochar surface,
the bioﬁlm matrix may also reduce the hydrophobicity of the material, reducing the
E. coli retention. The hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms appears to be lower
than the hydrophobicity of the biochar surface, possibly explaining why bioﬁlm
improved the retention potential in sand ﬁlters but decreased in biochar-sand ones.
Also, Afrooz and Boehm (2016) highlighted the interference of organic matter in
stormwater ﬁlter systems. In this study, biochar’s presence showed a different
performance with “natural organic matter” (NOM), added in the ﬁlter medium to
simulate high organic loaded stormwater. Without the presence of NOM, the sand
ﬁlter had a more excellent retention performance than with the NOM addition.
20
Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar
445

However, in biochar–bioﬁlm ﬁlters, the NOM presence indicated no alternation in
the bacterial immobilization, being underperformed by the regular sand ﬁlters in
both cases.
In virtue that the biochar material can be created using different substrates,
pyrolysis and additional treatments are essential to remind that these factors can
result in other properties. By that, they offer a contrasting behavior against the same
contaminant. An experiment by Dalahmeh et al. (2018) resulted in distinguished
grades of adsorption of certain pharmaceuticals, comparing the use of biochar
amended sand ﬁlters and regular sand ﬁlters with and without the presence of
bioﬁlms, similar to the method used by Afrooz and Boehm (2016). In this study,
carbamazepine was efﬁciently ﬁltrated by biochar and biochar–bioﬁlm treatments,
with a slight increase in non–bioﬁlm treated ﬁlters, possibly due to the compound’s
nature. It does not allow it to be easily biodegraded, as observed for the low retention
of the non-bioﬁlm sand ﬁlter (31–46%). Also, the high adsorptive area of the biochar
was efﬁcient in the retention of metoprolol regardless of the presence of bioﬁlm
(roughly 95–99% reduction), while sand ﬁlters struggled to obtain similar results
(36–73%), demonstrating that the biochar’s high adsorptive potential is not disrupted
by the presence of bioﬁlm in the retention of certain substances. For proper use of
this technology, the characteristics of both material, contaminant, and bioﬁlm
(if present) must be previously selected based on the reactive attraction among
these factors. Such regards should also be applied in viruses’ adsorption since little
literature covers the most efﬁcient viral retention strategy based on the biochar
characteristics, even without bioﬁlm.
In an insight of these characteristics, it is essential to presume the bioﬁlm’s
duality as a biochar enhancer. For one, such material may act by improving the
efﬁciency by removing microorganisms. Simultaneously, its presence adds variety
in the pores’ diameter present in the biochar, increasing the size range of the
organisms that will be retained. However, the bioﬁlm’s excessive development can
alter the biochar properties, such as texture and hydrophobicity, thus reducing the
removal effectiveness (Afrooz and Boehm 2016; Kranner et al. 2019).
Considering the inﬂuence of factors related to the large-scale application of
ﬁltering systems implemented with biochar, it is still possible to obtain greater
efﬁciency in removing pathogens than standard ﬁlters. Biochar is an accessible
and environmentally friendly material, and its association with standard ﬁlters can
improve the retention of pathogens even when considering issues such as the rate of
organic matter present in stormwater that seeps through the roads, the effectiveness
of these systems in the long term, and the effect of bioﬁlm formation on ﬁltration
systems. As more experiments are developed focusing on this system’s practical
application, it will be possible to get closer and closer to the real inclusion of this
material in water treatment and other possible uses (Afrooz and Boehm 2016;
Kranner et al. 2019).

20.2.1 Biochar Enhancement
Porous adsorbent materials, such as the termically treated organic materials
denominated as biochars, hold a capacity of high microorganism immobilization
due to surface adsorption and entrapment of particles in the interior of their porous.
Such interactions are ruled by physical phenomena like electrostatic attraction and
van der Waals forces, which can retain a distinguishable spectrum of particles based
on the nature of the interaction and the contaminant’s physical and chemical
properties as any physical and chemical phenomenal; such range of interactions
can have their intensity ampliﬁed or diminish based on the chemical conditions of
the material in question and the present medium, being the attractive potential
directly inﬂuenced by the pH of the material or medium, ionic force, temperature,
and the presence of ionized metals (Sasidharan et al. 2016).
Furthermore, due to biochar being a primarily low-cost and green material,
additional adsorption capability modiﬁcations can be highly valued or even neces-
sary to replace standard water puriﬁcation substances on an industrial scale. Such
adsorptive properties can be further modiﬁed and dramatically ampliﬁed by
controlling the conditions that rule the attractive process and the addition of external
modulatory materials that can interact with the biochar compound and increase the
overall adsorptive potential, like the addition of standard sand ﬁlters mixed in the
biochar substrate. The process aiming to increase the relevance of biochar further
subtracts in high demanding puriﬁcation systems by the use of external materials, or
substances can be deﬁned as an enhancement, for it “enhances” dramatically the
adsorption capability of the biochar by achieving a higher particle immobilization
potential (Sasidharan et al. 2016).
The enhancement of the biochar structure can dramatically change its properties,
and more importantly, change the overall function to a speciﬁc target contaminant or
particular use, for the primary appeal of the material is based on the general cost of
production and surface properties, which can extend or constrict one’s application.
Such additional variations allow a better all-around performance against a speciﬁc
range of subtracts or compounds, either metals, pathogens, or even interactions,
aiming to increase crop production and improve the soil, as previously mentioned.
The enhancement factors are based on chemical and physical alterations or addition
of reactive materials, such as ionized metals, inﬂuence the fundamental properties
that give the biochar its adsorptive nature, such as their reactive surface area,
porosity, pH, and presence of interfering substances that can change the material
interaction with speciﬁc functional groups. The amendment addition of importance,
or even environmental conditions, that results in, for example, an increase of cations
or anions in the adsorptive surface can result in a higher afﬁliation to metal ions,
allowing a greater use in the removal of heavy metals. These treatments can occur
before, during, or after the pyrolysis step that results in the ﬁnal commercial biochar,
and overall, they are as affordable as the biochar itself. One of the main advantages
of using these reactive materials and biochar remains the lower cost compared with
other industrial sanitation products (Premarathna et al. 2019).

Active Control of Environmental Enteric Viruses and Bacteria Using Biochar
447

Biochar characteristics such as surface area, surface activity, porosity, and physi-
cochemical stability can vary mainly depending on the feedstock used in the char
production (different organic materials like crop residues, wood, municipal waste,
sewage sludge, and manure; the majority of which are considered waste), a pyrolytic
temperature which usually occurs at a range of 400–700 C, heating rate, reaction
media, and residence time (Premarathna et al. 2019). These variations can affect the
efﬁciency of the pathogen removal and take pyrolysis temperature; for instance,
higher temperatures tend to produce biochars with greater surface area, elevated pH
levels, higher ash contents, and lower total surface charge; all of those characteristics
could reduce or even enhance the removal efﬁciency (Bolster and Abit 2012;
Sasidharan et al. 2016).
Bolster and Abit (2012) tested if biochar produced from two different
temperatures would react in distinct ways to reduce the amount of E. coli transported
in sand and soil columns. When added a high-temperature poultry litter biochar to
the ﬁne sand, they observed that the result was a large increase in the E. coli
retention, showing that the biochar pyrolysis temperature is one of the various
characteristics of the biochar that can inﬂuence the pathogen uptake. When these
soils were corrected with biochar, it was possible to observe that when adding high-
temperature poultry litter (HTPL) to the ﬁne sand, there was a reduction in the E. coli
recovery percentages by 1.8 orders of magnitude. Besides, low-temperature pine
chip (LTPC) and high-temperature pine chip (HTPC) biochars decreased by approx-
imately 2.0 and 2.5 orders of importance in the recovery of E. coli, respectively. For
S. typhimurium, the addition of HTPC reduced the recovery percentages by 2.2
orders of magnitude. The results on the effect of adding biochar on bacterial
transport in the sandy clay were visibly different. The low-temperature poultry litter
(LTPL) biochar to the sandy clay increased recovery percentages by more than three
orders of magnitude for both microorganisms. The mixture of HTPL biochar with
sandy clay caused a sharp increase (almost three orders of magnitude) in the
S. typhimurium recovery percentages (Abit et al. 2014). These results indicate that
retention of microorganisms may occur differently due to changes in pores, water
chemistry, or soil surface properties after biochars’ addition (Bolster and Abit 2012).
Being one of the main biochar qualities, the overall low cost and sustainable
nature of the material, such organic compound, has an increasing demand and
interest in strategies of cheap and “green” removal and treatment of contaminated
sources, whether those are with toxic levels of metals and pharmaceuticals
compounds, or by rapid spreading pathogens. Compared with most of the active
carbon materials, however, the smaller surface area, lower porosity, and negative
inﬂuence of biotic and abiotic processes in the proper function of the biochar make
the material less than ideal in removing pathogens and other contaminants. Further,
amplifying the relevance and search for additional enhancements methods, aiming to
improve biochar capabilities in the retention and inactivation of these contaminants.
Being the temperament or soaked with different metals and acidic or alkaline
compounds, one of the most common strategies to increase the overall adsorptive
area, and by that, increase the availability of interactive parts of the material with the
target particle (Premarathna et al. 2019).
448
E. B. de Souza et al.

With metals or ionized metallic compounds, the treatment usually results in
impregnation of the biochar surface, providing a more reactive adsorptive area,
generally archiving such structure by soaking the biochar base with solutions of
metal nitrates or chlorides. Temperature is also a simple and effective way to
increase the overall adsorptive properties of the organic compounds and other
wastes, having one of the most signiﬁcant decreases in the medium’s carbon content
and being easily achieved and measured by alterations in the max temperature of
pyrolysis. Also, temperature further increases the pores volume and size by thermal
destruction of hydrogen- and oxygen-based compounds like aliphatic alkyl, ester,
and phenolic groups (Premarathna et al. 2019).
Other ways of improving the biochar’s adsorptive potential lie in different
physical treatments, such as microwaving, gas or steam activation, ball milling,
magnetic inductions, and gas or steam activation. Physical enhancements have the
advantage of not creating by-product impurities than chemical methods, being a safe,
easily controlled, and reliable type of treatment without the need to worry about the
inﬂuence of potential by-products interfering with the particle-retaining capabilities.
Besides nearly doubling the particle retention potential, steam activation can also
expel remaining impurities and incomplete combustion products of the biochar
mass. This method needs to be followed with caution because useful functional
groups can be removed as well; for that, a second treatment may be advised to retain
certain available compounds. Magnetic improvements also have their drawbacks
because this method can result in small density and size particles, which can be
challenging to remove or collect after the use in water remediation, giving the risk
that such particles can decompose and by that release the adsorbed contaminants,
requiring additional treatments to magnetize the structure for been further collect by
a magnetic source (Panahi et al. 2020).
Chemical treatments can promote undesirable alterations, like by-products that
interfere with the functional groups, resulting in reduced adsorption of an aimed
target; such methods are still highly studied and used for biochar activation through
the use of chemical compounds and inert gases. Acid or essential components are
commonly added to promote the material’s oxidation, improving the overall surface
area, cation exchange capability, availability of micropores, and speciﬁc functional
groups. Certain treatments produce distinguishable functional characteristics; acidic
and alkaline modiﬁcations increase the surface area by particular dimerizing
compounds in the biochar structure. However, alkalic-treated materials appear to
result in an even larger surface area (Panahi et al. 2020). Based on the comportment
of distinguishable alterations, it is necessary to choose a treatment, or even a
conjunct of treatments wisely, to produce a material that can be both efﬁcient in
removing the target contaminant and economically desirable.
Such improvements in the retention of large and microscopic particles are highly
desirable in retaining pathogens in wastewater treatment plants, which usually hold
an exponential bacteria and virus concentration per liquid or solid waste. For
efﬁcient removal of microorganisms and to ensure that the ﬁnal material can be
reused in human and animal activities, it is necessary that no active pathogen can be
found in the ﬁnal product since contamination is based on a living organism that can
20

easily repropagate to even higher concentrations before treatment and thus contami-
nate different sources with little more than a few particles of infectious material.
Even traditional old methods like composting still require additional treatments to
increase the degree of safety before proper use for the average temperature, and toxin
build-up in such systems is usually not enough for full pathogen removal. Besides
also producing undesirable toxins after biological degradation, which can be poten-
tially harmful if aimed to be reused in agriculture and livestock systems. For that,
additional materials such as biochar continue to be highly desirable. Those are cheap
yet efﬁcient, pathogens removers and toxin compounds regulators, enhancing these
products based on various low-cost waste products, such as the addition of sawdust
and other wood shavings. (Ravindran et al. 2019).
In an experiment organized by Ravindran et al. (2019), the addition of biochar
with sawdust in composting systems not only signiﬁcantly decreased the pathogenic
bacterial load of E.coli and Salmonella sp. but also reduced the bulk density,
increased the aeration and porosity of the bulk compared with biochar without
such addition or the presence of any biochar compound. More remarkable is that
the conjunct treatment allowed a more signiﬁcant decrease of carbon, nitrogen, and
total moisture in the compost, probably due to the enhanced activity of decomposing
microorganisms inﬂuenced by the biochar’s presence, which may have protective
properties to certain types of microbiota, as previously mentioned. Such variation of
the nutrient composition and decrease of moisture can further reduce the necessary
conditions for proliferation and survival of different kinds of potential pathogens
present before treatment or even lower the odds of future colonization. Alterations of
pH and temperature during the decomposition phase could also be attributed to many
microorganisms’ increasingly hostile situations.
Even without many studies focusing on the interaction of enhanced biochars
combined with macrobiotic bacterial populations in the viral population, it is not
precipitous to imply that the extreme variations of physical and chemical conditions
of one waste inﬂuenced by the enhanced biological activities of the local bacterial
population can decrease the viability of virion particles present in the waste con-
tainer. For these organic structures, even though they can sustain themselves in an
extensive period without a host, they are susceptible to degradation by sudden
environmental variations (Ravindran et al. 2019).
20.3
Final Considerations
There is evidence that studies on an experimental and real scale to explore new
technological conﬁgurations using biochar are promising trends in the control of
environmental pathogens and chemical contaminants, reducing negative impacts on
human, animal, and environmental health based on sustainable and low-cost
technology.

Application of Biochar for Soil Remediation 21
Shubhangi Parmar, Sagar Daki, and Anupama Shrivastav
Abstract
Biochar refers to black solid carbonaceous material produced majorly by the
process of pyrolysis or sometimes produced by application of chemicals under
oxygen-limited environmental conditions. The term biochar is speciﬁcally
associated with a substrate that is used as soil ameliorant, and the surge in
research interests toward biochar is due to its varied applications. One of the
critical reasons to promote biochar as an excellent long-term soil conditioner is its
stability. The characteristic properties of biochar when added to the soil are an
increase in pH, nutrient retention capacity leading to elevated soil quality in
agriculture, crop biomass, the fertility of the soil, cation exchange capacity, and
carbon sequestration so its application in bioremediation of contaminated soils
would be a substantial way to initiate many green processes in the environment.
With large surface areas, accelerated sorption of organic and inorganic substances
is possible, which helps reducing contaminant mobility during amendments of
polluted soil. Biochar is quite promising for the removal of heavy metals,
persistent organic matter, improvement of soil quality, and stabilization of soil
for revegetation. This chapter summarizes biochar preparation methods and
parameters, the role of biochar in bioremediation, different approaches used for
soil restoration with potential drawbacks, and further scope of research with
biochar in soil amendments.

Introduction
Soil pollution refers to the entry of any primary or secondary toxic pollutant in the
environment that poses toxic effects to biota and humans in the surrounding. Soil can
be contaminated with organic and inorganic contaminants, which occurs universally
and naturally; accepted techniques have been developed for their disposal. Modern
remediation techniques are focused on cost-effectiveness with in situ amendments of
contaminated soil with substances that would remediate the soil and lead to plant
growth stimulation and overall ecological restoration. Soil quality assessment
systems have now adopted the risk-based approaches, which are concerned more
with the hazardous effects of the contaminants rather than assessing only the total
concentration of pollutants in the soil. Organic matter is preferentially used more
compared with other substances as it is obtained from biological sources and very
few preprocessing steps are required before it is added to the soil (Beesley et al.
2011). Biochar refers to black solid carbonaceous material produced majorly by the
process of pyrolysis or sometimes produced by the application of chemicals under
oxygen-limited environmental
conditions.
The
term
biochar
is
speciﬁcally
associated with a substrate that is used as soil ameliorant, and the surge in research
interests toward biochar is due to its varied applications. The main objective of land
remediation is the reduction of hazardous effects caused by land pollutants to biota.
The process of remediation can be simpliﬁed with familiarity with terms like source
and receptor. Source refers to any physical location from where contaminants have
been generated. A receptor could be deﬁned as any location like water bodies and
tissues of biota that could have harmful effects due to the source. The main idea of
remediation is to reduce the source pathway receptor linkage to shrink the harm on
receptors. The most common approaches used to date include removal of source or
removal of the receptor; however, application of such method on large scale seems to
be an impractical and expensive process. Numerous properties of biochar make it an
efﬁcient tool for remediation of contaminants in the soil as it has a large adsorption
area, negative charge, and is highly resistant to degradation. The surface area of
biochar is said to be increased along with the higher pyrolysis temperature up to an
extent. Further, the property of negative charge helps in attracting the metals and
organic in the internal surface of biochar from the polluted soil, and due to this
potential risk of their uptake by organisms can be reduced greatly. Biochar can
efﬁciently help in breaking the source and receptor pathways by adsorbing
contaminants on the surface that act as pollutants for soil (Gomez-Eyles et al.
2013; Bardos et al. 2002).
Sustainable soil remediation techniques for contaminated soil are generally
focused on maintaining or enhancing the quality of soil, which can occur by carbon
sequestration,
reducing
soil
erosion,
and
providing
suitable
environmental
conditions for increasing soil biodiversity. The porous nature of biochar makes it
possible to provide such a suitable environment with carbon sequestration
properties. Biochar has clearly demonstrated the potential for the reduction of a
variety of organic and inorganic contaminants present in the soil, in their mobile
forms. The characteristic properties of biochar when added to the soil are an increase

in pH, nutrient retention capacity leading to elevated soil quality in agriculture, crop
biomass, the fertility of the soil, cation exchange capacity, and carbon sequestration
so its application in bioremediation of contaminated soils would be a substantial way
to initiate many green processes in the environment. With large surface areas,
accelerated sorption of organic and inorganic substances is possible, which helps
reducing contaminant mobility during amendments of polluted soil. Biochar is quite
promising for the removal of heavy metals, persistent organic matter, improvement
of soil quality, and stabilization of soil for revegetation. The basic introductory
schematic representation of biochar source and its production is shown in Fig. 21.1
(Kumar et al. 2016).
21.2
Biochar Preparation Methods
Biochar can be prepared from organic waste, which has a high potential for the
generation of biochar. Waste materials that could be used as the source of biochar
preparation include agricultural waste like crop residues, food waste, animal manure,
and municipality waste (El-Naggar et al. 2019) (Varjani et al. 2019). Biochar is
generally prepared using different thermochemical methods. Common thermochem-
ical techniques employed for biochar preparation are pyrolysis, hydrothermal car-
bonization, gasiﬁcation, torrefaction, and ﬂash carbonization (Bridgwater 2012).
There are many different factors that affect the pyrolysis process of biochar produc-
tion, and one of the major factors to be considered while production is a type of
biomass used for the process. Biochar can be produced from residues like rice straw,
wheat straw, waste wood, corn cob, and many other agricultural waste substances
that are rich in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin compounds. The process
conditions in which biochar is prepared will play a crucial role in determining the
Fig. 21.1 Schematic representation of biochar source and production process
21

morphological characteristics of biochar. Different methods used for the preparation
of biochar preparation are explained in details below.
21.2.1 Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis is the process of decomposition of organic matter at temperatures ranging
from 250–900 C along with the maintenance of an oxygen-free environment.
Pyrolysis is used for the production of commercially valuable products from organic
material like biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. In pyrolysis, the cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin present in the source material go through series of reaction like depo-
lymerization, fragmentation, and cross-linking at varied temperatures that ultimately
leads to the production of products in three different solid, liquid, and gaseous states.
At the end of the pyrolysis process, solid products obtained are bio-oil and biochar,
while the gaseous state products include hydrogen, syngas, and carbon dioxide gas.
In this method, temperature is a crucial deciding factor that controls the production
efﬁciency of biochar, but at very high temperatures, there is a reduction in the overall
yield of biochar (Wei et al. 2019). The pyrolysis process carried out can be classiﬁed
into two different types, which are fast pyrolysis and slow pyrolysis. Fast pyrolysis
causes liquefaction of solid biomass materials into bio-oil. The process is carried out
in steps like the warming of biomass particles at a temperature of about 100 C per
minute with reduced duration of production of pyrolysis fumes and biomass
particles, and ﬁnally, moderate pyrolysis treatment that occurs in the temperature
range of 400–600 C. In slow pyrolysis, the better yield of biochar is obtained where
the temperature of the system is kept about 5–7 C per minute less compared with
fast pyrolysis and the residence time is more than 1 h (Al Arni 2018).
21.2.2 Hydrothermal Carbonization
The hydrothermal carbonization method for biochar preparation is a cost-effective
technique where the process is performed at a temperature range of 180–250 C. The
biochar prepared from the hydrothermal method is also commonly named hydrochar
as it uses wet biomass. The biomass is ﬁrst blended with water in a closed reactor,
and then the temperature is increased eventually to maintain biochar stability. In this
process, different products are obtained at different temperature ranges. Biochar is
produced at temperatures below 250 C, production of bio-oil occurs in between
250 and 400 C, which is known as hydrothermal liquefaction, and gaseous syngas is
produced as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane around 400 and above by
the process of hydrothermal gasiﬁcation. Hydrochar is produced through series of
reactions like condensation, polymerization, repolymerization, cross-linking and
dehydration (Jain et al. 2016).
458

21.2.3 Gasification
Gasiﬁcation is the decomposition of organic material into gases by the use of
thermochemical techniques. The gas produced after gasiﬁcation is called syngas,
which is abundant in carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, and
micro-quantities of hydrocarbons. Gasiﬁcation agents employed include steam, air,
high temperature, and oxygen. On ﬂuctuation of temperature, the concentration of
different gases obtained also changes. When gasiﬁcation is done, biochar is obtained
as a by-product after the production of syngas, and thus, the yield is low as compared
with other methods. Steps involved in the gasiﬁcation process include drying,
pyrolysis, and oxidation or combustion (Prabakar et al. 2018). The comparison
between different pyrolysis techniques and gasiﬁcation is explained in Table 21.1
(Tisserant and Cherubini 2019).
21.2.4 Torrefaction
Torrefaction emerged as a method for biochar production, which is also known as
mild pyrolysis as it requires low heating. Inert atmospheric air is used for the
removal of oxygen and moisture present in biomass under anaerobic conditions at
300 C. The main objective of the torrefaction process is a modiﬁcation of particle
size, surface area, heating rate, and moisture content of biochar. Torrefaction can be
classiﬁed into three different types as steam torrefaction, wet torrefaction, and
oxidative torrefaction. In steam torrefaction, treatment of biomass occurs with
steam at temperatures not exceeding 260 with 10 min of residence time. In wet
torrefaction, the water is added, and treatment is done at 180–200 C temperature,
while residence time is increased up to 5–240 min. It is also termed hydrothermal
carbonization at times. In oxidative torrefaction, the treatment of biomass is done
with oxidizing agents usually gases that are used in combustion, where energy is
generated after the end of the process. The initial methods of torrefaction achieve
incomplete pyrolysis, and after that, processes like drying, pre-drying, and post-
drying are carried out. The temperature range for the torrefaction process is

21.3
Parameters Influencing Biochar Quality
The type of reaction conditions is very crucial for the production of biochar.
Different factors have a cumulative effect on the production of biochar. The factors
like temperature of the reaction, size of the particle, heating rates, and type of source
material directly affect the quality of biochar. The in-depth knowledge of how these
factors affect biochar property is very important before the application of biochar to
any process. The most common materials used for production are agricultural
residues, solid waste, wood, etc. for biochar preparation (Shaheen et al. 2019).
Solid wastes produce more biochar as compared with other biological materials.
The different parameters affecting biochar quality are discussed below.
21.3.1 Source Material for Biochar Production
Biomass is the source material used for the production of biochar, which is deﬁned
as complex material that is composed of biological, organic, and inorganic matter
which is derived from living plants and living organisms. The biomass used for
production can be categorized into two different categories like woody biomass and
non-woody biomass (Tripathi et al. 2016). The woody biomass includes tree
residues, barks, twigs, and forestry parts with characteristics like low debris, high
density, less void-age, and low dampness with caloriﬁc value. On the contradictory,
the non-woody biomass includes industrial and agricultural solid wastes and animal
wastes showing features like high dampness, increased void-age, and high debris
with low caloriﬁc value and low density. Important parameters of source material are
its moisture content as it affects the biomass formation directly. The moisture can be
retained in the source material in many different ways in the form of water, vapors,
or present in the pores of the biomass. High moisture content hinders the formation
of biochar and increases the energy required to achieve suitable pyrolytic tempera-
ture for that source material. The source material with lower moisture content is
selected for the formation of biochar as it requires signiﬁcantly lower heat energy
and pyrolysis time when compared with the one with high moisture content. Overall
materials with low moisture make the process economically efﬁcient and easy (Jafri
et al. 2018).
21.3.2 Pyrolysis Temperature
Pyrolysis to date remains the most common method for conversion of biomass into
biochar by thermochemical decomposition process in the absence of oxygen and
elevated temperature. With regard to pyrolysis conditions, the process can be divided
460
S. Parmar et al.

into three classiﬁcations like slow pyrolysis, moderate pyrolysis, and quick pyroly-
sis. The best pyrolysis method for the production of good biochar can be moderate
pyrolysis. The difference between all three types is that they are operational at
different temperatures. The slow pyrolysis process occurs at temperatures below
300 C, while moderate pyrolysis occurs at a temperature range of 300–500 C,
while quick pyrolysis carried out at temperatures exceeding 500 C. The temperature
at which pyrolysis of biomass is carried out affects the physiological and chemical
parameters of biomass like its surface area, pore structure, functional groups, and
physical features (Dhyani and Bhaskar 2018).
21.3.3 Residence Time
Residence time is the total duration for which all the components react in the reactor
also deﬁned as the time required by all reactants to displace the total volume of the
reactor. The low pyrolysis process is signiﬁcantly affected by changes in residence
time, as an increase in residence time during this method decreases the yield of
biochar. The increasing residence time in high pyrolysis does not affect the process
of biochar formation or pH alteration and so the same amount of biochar is obtained
in case of variation. The residence time is also known to affect the iodine adsorption
number of biochar, which was observed to be reduced with an increase in residence
time for low pyrolysis; however, it increased on increased residence time in case of
the quick pyrolysis method (Liang et al. 2016).
21.3.4 Pretreatment of the Source Material
The biochar characteristics are governed by the pretreatment applied to the source
material before it undergoes the process of pyrolysis. The most widely applied
pretreatment methods include immersion of source material into different solutions
and reduction in particle size of the source material. It is observed that reduced
particle-sized raw materials are capable of producing high biochar yields. Other
pretreatment methods like nitrogen or metal doping also inﬂuence the biochar
characteristics, while the elemental composition of biochar can be modiﬁed by
soaking the source material or steaming the source material in a chemical solution.
Baking is another common pretreatment method that increases the carbon content
present in biochar and also helps in the reduction of moisture in the biochar
production. The properties of biochar can vary depending on the source material
as it has different concentrations of different mineral elements in it. Elements like
nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur are volatile in nature during pyrolysis, but minerals
like phosphorus, magnesium, silicon, and calcium remain present even after biochar
is formed as they are not volatile in nature (You et al. 2018).
After the production of biochar, characterization of biochar can be done using
various parameters, which include the physical, chemical, surface, and molecular
characteristics of biochar. Parameters like pH and electrical conductivity are checked
21

461

under physical characteristics, while chemical characterization includes checking the
surface area, particle size distribution, bulk density, and pore size. Surface
parameters can be checked using different spectroscopic methods and scanning
electron microscopy. The molecular parameters include thermal analysis, structural
arrangements, and aromatic characterization using transmission electron micros-
copy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. (Brewer et al. 2014).
21.4
Impacts of Biochar on Soil and Its Biota
Different articles on biochar provide sufﬁcient evidence that biochar improves the
physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of soil, which leads to an increase
in crop yield in agriculture and remediation of toxic pollutants present in the soil in
an efﬁcient manner. Soil sensitivity is deﬁned as the sensitivity level of soil toward
natural or man-made disturbances caused to it, while the ﬂexibility of soil is deﬁned
as the ability of soil to restore its original properties and qualities after being affected
by natural or induced interference. The quality of soil can be checked by assessing
the sensitive indicators of soil by certain parameters. Numerous properties of soil
including biological properties like microbial biomass, respiration, soil enzymes,
and earthworm activity are considered to be the indicators of soil quality.
Application of biochar to the soil causes an elevation in pH-dependent charge in
the soil, which causes further increased cation exchange capacity of the soil.
Increased pH in the soil leads to an increase in lime and calcium levels in soil,
which can decrease the aluminum toxicity seen in red iron soils. The addition of
biochar not only helps in the treatment of acidic soil but also helps in increasing the
pH of alkaline soil to an extent. The properties of biochar, which depend on the
source material, environmental conditions, and type of soil it is applied to, may
change over time. Some of the beneﬁcial effects of biochar include a reduction in soil
bulk weight, improvement in phosphorus, soil pH, organic matter, and water content
of the soil, which can overall increase the cultivation performance of such soils in
agriculture. Characteristics like soil bulk density, porosity, water retention capacity,
and redox conditions play a crucial role in microbial growth and plant growth in the
soil. The soil with high volume density has very low absorption capacity for water,
which affects the penetration of roots and plant growth, but with the application of
biochar decrease in bulk density, increase in soil porosity and soil aeration can be
achieved. Soil aggregation rates are higher in soils modiﬁed by the addition of
biochar as compared with controls. With the addition of biochar to soil, there is an
increase in water and nutrient content of soil over time, and the hydrophobic nature
of biochar causes elevated water absorption and retention capacities. Along with all
these beneﬁts of biochar, it also enhances the soil redox conditions and behavior of
microbes.
The source of nutrients in the soil is the organic matter that is present in it. The
absorption of nitrogen by organic matter and microbes present in the soil can
promote plant growth. The soil organic matter is determined by soil texture, moisture
content, temperature, and many other factors. When biochar is added to the soil, it
462
S. Parmar et al.

improves the organic content in the soil and soil humus, which increases the
proportion of carbon to nitrogen ration in the soil that is further absorbed by the
plants. Biochar signiﬁcantly reduces the leaching of organic matter from the soil and
supports the development of soil organic matter–mineral complexes and microbial
organic mineral complexes.
Biochar is useful in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions occurring from the
soil, while increases the total nitrogen by promoting mineralization and nitriﬁcation
reactions in the soil. The usage of biochar with ash as a biofertilizer in the soil is very
economic and an efﬁcient approach that improves environmental sustainability with
beneﬁcial effects in the long term. Biochar also has pieces of evidence of nutrient
acquisition, and so, it acts as a source of nutrients for plant roots.
The physical and chemical properties of biochar can modify the soil microbes and
their enzymatic activities. Biochar voids provide suitable habitat for microbes and
consequently; it also improves the density, pH, aeration, water, and nutrients in the
environment. Biochar obtained from different sources have fulvic and humus con-
tent similar to organic carbon present in the soil, which is thermally stable. Soil
enzymes are secreted from soil microbes or plant roots or from decomposition
reactions taking place in soil, and they play important role in all biochemical
reactions in the soil. The activity of biochar inﬂuences microbial growth providing
increased surface area for nutrient absorption and accumulation properties of soil
that contributes to the health of plants and provides nutrients that are essential for
higher yield. In most cases, the application of biochar can signiﬁcantly improve
enzymatic activity and the number of microorganisms in the soil. Studies indicate
that there are many other important factors that inﬂuence the microbial activity and
secretion of enzymes on the application of biochar (Mandal et al. 2021).
The microbial reproduction rate is also increased in biochar amended soils and
wastewater. The colonization rate of beneﬁcial symbiotic mycorrhiza with plant
roots is increased positively on the treatment of soil with biochar. After the applica-
tion of biochar, there is seen an increase in microbial abundance of nonsymbiotic
microbes speciﬁcally. The pH of biochar produced may range from values below
4 to above 12 depending on the material used for preparation and temperature of
pyrolysis. With the increase in pH of hydrochars, stimulation of microbial reproduc-
tion, that too particularly bacteria, is observed, while some fungi got inhibited
drastically due to unfavorable pH conditions in the soil. The bacteria get sorbed on
the surface of biochar, which makes them unavailable for leaching out in the soil.
Adsorption on the surface of biochar can occur by different processes like hydro-
phobic interaction and electrostatic forces. The bacteria and fungi are protected by
competitors by residing in pore habitats of biochar. Drying of soil causes stress on
microbes that lead to dormancy or death of microorganisms, but large surface areas
and greater water holding capacities of biochar with enough pores continue to
provide hydration to microbes that would otherwise die in the drying soil (Pathy
et al. 2020). The different applications of biochar with particular focus on
applications in soil quality can be represented in Fig. 21.2 (Kumar et al. 2016).

21.5
Biochar and Environmental Pollution
The interest in biochar research has increased over time due to its eco-friendliness,
inexpensive, and easy thermochemical techniques for preparation characters.
Biochar can address many different environmental problems as it plays a major
role in the removal of contaminants from soil and water. The carbonaceous biochar
produced at high temperatures shows more efﬁciency for the removal of organic
pollutants as compared with inorganic ones due to its properties like porosity, pH,
less dissolved carbon, and hydrophobicity. The biochar that is produced at low
pyrolysis temperature
are
more
suitable
for
the
elimination
of inorganic
contaminants. Biochar has a variety of applications in pollution control and different
ﬁelds like wastewater treatment, composting, carbon sequestration, and amendment
of soil, which are discussed here (Yaashikaa et al. 2020).
21.5.1 Biochar for Removal of Organic Pollutants
Biochar is widely applied for the removal of organic pollutants persistent in soil and
water. When biochar is applied to the soil, the adsorption of organic pollutants
present in the soil occurs. On increasing the biochar concentration in soil, the
degradation rate and adsorption rate of contaminants increase as they have a direct
proportional relationship. The organic contaminants that can be adsorbed on the
surface of biochar include agricultural chemicals, insecticides, herbicides, pesticides,
aromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics, dyes like methylene blue, and volatile organic
compounds. Pesticides like carbofuran can be adsorbed easily on the biochar surface
Fig. 21.2 Different applications of biochar and its effects on soil quality
464
S. Parmar et al.

due to the presence of functional groups like aromatic phenolic groups or carboxylic
groups. Biochar can remove organic pollutants from the soil by using many different
mechanisms like electrostatic attraction, pore diffusion, biodegradation, transforma-
tion, hydrophobic interactions, or electrophilic interactions, which mainly depends
on the quality of interaction between pollutant and biochar. The major factors that
would affect the elimination of organic pollutants by biochar include the type of
source material, temperature, pH, pollutant concentration, applied biochar type, and
the kind of biochar-pollutant interaction. Biochar adsorbs the soil organic pollutants
and decreases its bioavailability and uptake rates by plant roots and animals. Biochar
removes the soil conditions, and experiments show better soil properties of soil
amended with biochar as compared with one without biochar application. Along
with biochar properties and application methods, the type of soil to which it is
applied and its original conditions also contribute to its efﬁciency. The principal
mechanism by which the removal of organic matter occurs by biochar is adsorption
(Mondal et al. 2016).
21.5.2 Biochar for Removal of Inorganic Pollutants
The nonbiodegradable compounds and metals are counted under inorganic
pollutants that affect the health of humans and pose a serious risk on environments
when present in high concentrations. The important inorganic pollutants include
carcinogenic compounds and heavy metals like zinc, nickel, mercury, copper, and
calcium as they are attributed to the environment from sources like industrial
efﬂuents and municipal waters. The biochar, which is produced at low temperature
by the process of slow pyrolysis, is used for the sorption of inorganic compounds on
its surface. It is possible to remediate inorganic pollutants with biochar produced at
low temperatures as it possesses many different functional groups with porosity in
nature and high content of carbon. The main principle by which remediation of
inorganic pollutants like heavy metals occurs is ion exchange.
The characteristic immobilization property of biochar can cause alteration in
heavy metal properties like surface functional groups, pH, and cation exchange
capacities. Studies indicate that zeta potential and cation exchange capacities of
biochar are reduced with increasing the pH of the soil. The biochar amended soils
show efﬁcient immobilization of heavy metals and their remediation as compared
with other techniques. The source material used for the preparation of biochar, which
is to be applied for remediation of inorganic pollutants, includes sugar beet, corn
cub, straw, soybeans, and animal sewage. Another factor that affects the removal
capacities of biochar is pH and also the type of metal that that is needed to be
eliminated. At pH ranging from 6 to 7, the main mechanism for elimination is ion
exchange, while at pH 7 or higher, the main mechanism for elimination of pollutants
seems to be surface complexation and electrostatic attractions. The dosage of biochar
applied for remediation is also important as increasing the dosage provides more
surface area and increased pH, which enhances the rate of removal. In-depth studies
are still required in the ﬁeld of the removal of pollutants for efﬁcient operation. The
21
Application of Biochar for Soil Remediation
465

competition between metal binding and adsorption increases as the metals may
possess chemically the same functional group, and so many mechanisms are still
left unexplored (Karami et al. 2011).
21.5.3 Biochar in Air Pollution
Biochar is used as low-temperature selective reduction catalysts in many
experiments. The source material like sewage sludge or rice straw can be used for
the preparation of biochar that is used in air pollution control. The biochar obtained
from these materials is further physically or chemically modiﬁed and applied for the
removal of air pollutants after checking its removal efﬁciency. Before biochar
becomes functional for the elimination of pollutants, its activation by various
physical and chemical agents is done. Experiments suggested that chemical activa-
tion has produced better results as compared with physical methods. The type of
functional group present and absorption sites plays important role in the elimination
of air contaminants (Yu et al. 2009).
21.5.4 Biochar in Wastewater Treatment
Biochar is a very promising candidate when considered for treatment of wastewater
because it has higher porosity and high surface area. It can be used as media for
capturing elements that can be used as fertilizers in soil later. Due to its adsorption
capacities, the toxins from wastewater can accumulate on the surface of biochar, and
ultimately clean efﬂuent can be obtained. Researchers studied and compared the role
of biochar and activated carbon for the removal of toxic contaminants from the
wastewater and the execution of the biochar-based method on the basis of ﬁnancial
view, and biochar seemed to be much economical than activated carbon. Biochar is
good option for the removal of contaminants from wastewaters when compared with
production cost and greenhouse gas emissions from activated carbons (Yaashikaa
et al. 2020).
21.6
Techniques for Soil Restoration with Biochar
When biochar is applied to soil for increasing the fertility of soil, it should be applied
to soil surface present in proximity with root zone because nutrient cycling and
uptake of nutrients in bulk amount takes place in that area; when biochar is applied
with an aim of carbon sequestration or moisture management, then it should be
applied in the deeper layer of the soil as no destruction by microbial activity takes
place at deeper soil levels. The biochar can be protected from losses due to wind and
water erosion.
If they are applied thoroughly to the soil, the type of plants or crops growing in
the soil also decides the method by which biochar can be applied to that particular
466
S. Parmar et al.

soil; in conventional crop management systems, biochar is directly applied to the soil
with the help of farm machinery used in traditional farming, which would reduce the
cost associated with biochar application in conventional ﬁelds, biochar is, mixed
with lime for application as solid lime incorporates well with layers of soil.
Biochar can also be applied to the ﬁeld with the help of lime or solid manure
spreaders, which is called broadcasting. After broadcasting that biochar is
incorporated into the soil using different plowing methods used in ﬁeld, which
includes animal draft plow, disc harrows, and chisels, one of the limitations of
broadcasting and incorporating method is losses that occur due to wind erosion
and precautions needed to be taken while applications. Banding is a common method
used for the application of seeds and fertilizers in ﬁelds where material or seeds are
applied in a narrow band in the soil by using equipment that forms bands on the soil
surface without disturbing the entire surface of the soil; with banding technique,
biochar can be applied in the soil even after crop establishment with the minimal
disturbance caused to the soil. Another method of application is mixing of biochar
with other soil amendment agents like manure, compost, or lime instead of direct
application; as such method can protects against leaching and improves the efﬁ-
ciency of applied amendments.
Biochar can be applied to soil as slurry when mixed with liquid fertilizers. The
particle size of biochar to be applied with liquid should be ﬁne in nature. The
reduction of nitrogen losses in holding ponds can be achieved by the application
of biochar mixed with liquid manure. When sufﬁcient data on soil characteristics and
quality is available, it is possible to apply biochar speciﬁcally to certain areas of ﬁeld
where the fertility of soil is low. Uniform mixing of biochar can be done with sand,
topsoil, compost, or turfgrass substrate prior to application in the landscape environ-
ment. It can also be applied speciﬁcally in layers below the rooting zone of grass,
which helps in the protection of leached nutrients and pesticides from the soil.
Biochar can also be applied in localized areas around the root by excavation soil
around tree roots, which is later covered after application the biochar can be applied
over the planting area by creating planting holes in the soil. Biochar can also be
applied in trenches that radiate out from the base of established trees or holes that are
created at some distance from the base trees (Major 2010).
21.7
Limitations of Biochar
Biochar has inhibitory effects on the aging of soil and the addition of biomass into
the soil intermittently, which is essential for the recycling of nutrients. It can affect
the growth of fungi and earthworms in the soil. The positive effects of biochar
amendments done to the soil are soil-speciﬁc, which depends on the type of soil to
which it is applied and cannot be always beneﬁcial for all soil types. Findings
suggest that the problem of weed growth increases with the addition of biochar in
soil. Biochar can further cause a delay in the ﬂowering of different plants. The ability
of biochar to adsorb pollutants on its surface is also very selective. The biochar that
is produced using quick pyrolysis method contains higher amount of ash into it,

which might cause harmful effects on plant grown soils. Biochar at times can also
react with plant nutrients as a competitor instead of acting as a substance that
provides plant nutrients. The decomposition process of organic matter, which
continuously takes place in the soil, interferes with the addition of biochar to the
soil, which can have negative effects on fungi. The contamination of biochar source
in another problem can deteriorate the plant growth process. The cost of biochar
production depends on the type of biomass used, and sometimes the costs are very
high. The yield can also decrease at times due to the sorption of water and nutrients
by biochar. Biochar has also affected the germination process and showed an
inhibitory effect on it. The presence of ﬁne ash in biochar is the source of dust,
which can cause respiratory ailments in organisms. The long-term effects of the skin
of microorganisms that come in contact with biochar are still needed to be explored.
Application of large quantities of biochar in the soil for the long term may cause
negative effects in the soil due to nitrogen limitation. Emissions of black carbon from
the soil after the application of biochar can contribute to climate change and toxicity
when the environmental assessment of soil is conducted. Biochar after application in
soil may remain up to years as it cannot be removed from the soil all at once, and so,
long-term aging effects on soils are uncertain. Analysis of all important parameters is
a must before applying biochar to any kind of soil (Kavitha et al. 2018).

Future Perspective
Biochar is a promising renewable resource that can help in many environmental
problems and remediation of pollutants present in soil, water, and gas. Future
research in biochar scopes for studying adsorption and desorption mechanisms of
contaminants on biochar surface. The interaction of microbial population with
biochar and the diversity of microbes can also be explored. The alteration in growth
pattern and physiology of microbes on the application of biochar has to be explored
yet. More knowledge in the ﬁeld of binding mechanisms of biochar with soil is
needed. Future research will also focus on studying the life cycle of biochar
produced from the speciﬁc source material. The area of biochar characterization
has been progressive, but optimization of biochar properties and activation methods
are yet to be improved to enhance the activity. The effects of biochar on plants have
been studied, but less literature is available on the effects of biochar on fauna present
in the soil. For practical applications of biochar on a large scale, a better understand-
ing of long-term toxicity must be evaluated to provide safe environmental
applications. Future research can also focus on techniques for the development of
biochar composites and evaluation of their efﬁciency. Necessary research should be
conducted on reducing the production and equipment costs of biochar. A
standardized management system is needed to be developed for tracing the after
application (Lehmann et al. 2011). Further, all the areas having scope in biochar
research in the ﬁeld are explained as shown in Table 21.2 (Kuppusamy et al. 2016).

Conclusion
The depletion of quality agricultural land has created a need for the development of
sustainable crop production methods as population is increasing day by day. To
make the contaminated soil renewable and retain it’s original properties, biochar is a
promising means for remediation of contaminated soils and improvement of soil
fertility, by reducing its acidity and also increasing the nutrient availability in the
soil. The addition of biochar to soil is sustainable and eco-friendly method for
reduction of biotic stress created on solid. Biochar can increase the productivity of
soil by positive interactions between the soil plant and water, which would later
improve the photosynthetic efﬁciency nitrogen ﬁxation and water activity in agri-
culture. The physiochemical properties of biochar play key role in enhancing the
quality of soil. Properties of biochar like porous structure, high carbon content, and
ion exchange characters are very important for its application in removal of organic
and inorganic pollutants from soil, immobilization of heavy metal, and carbon
sequestration. The effect of biochar on the microbial communities present in the
soil is signiﬁcant as it increases the microbial abundance in the soil. It simulta-
neously provides soil with good nutritional status and proper microbial structure.
Biochar is one of the highly recommended substances in agricultural practices due to
its easy application methods and its cost-effectiveness. There are many trending
areas that can be explored in biochar research, and one of the interesting topics is
application of biochar combined with other substances with focus on achievement of
particular objective.
Biochar has not been used commercially on a large scale as most of the people
have based opinion fact that it is just a waste. Biochar is emerging as a tool for
remediation due to array of other beneﬁts it provides to the soil along with elimina-
tion of compounds; it is important to sufﬁciently study the environmental safety of
compounds before it is applied to the soil.
