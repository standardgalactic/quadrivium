Its been a long watch.. As the sun
disappears over the horizon, the
uninviting, grey bleakness of Cohan
becomes apparent. Following the
intense heat of the day, the onset of
night adds the bitterness of sub-zero
temperatures to an already hostile
environment, and the stark interior of
the 0.5V appears almost homelike
Deep melancholy is suddenly smashed
by the shrill scream of a siren The
status panel has gone crazy, an
extrordinary array of lights ﬂash
uncontrollably. Good grief. what's

Frantically, you turn to look at the
command scanner, hunting through
the mass of information before you, in
a desperate attempt to decipher what

f your idea of simulation is pressing 43 keys to lift a plane
off the ground, only to circle around for half an hour before
crashing, while attempting to land, then take a back seat as
Combat Simulations puts you ﬁrmly in the thick o f the
action. You take command (and often the cunt rols)of a war
machine with a mission and a not just a sight seeing tour and
you must strike ﬁrst before the enemy turns you into scrap
metal.
Intlight entertainment i s fo r those who like their
excitement without their feet on the ground and includes
bombing raids in World War II, 100 missions for an Apache
helicopter Gunship and futuristic ﬁghts for the SkyFox.
Surface tension takes to the high seas and on patrol in a
Destroyer unit ﬁnally we plunge into deep trouble and

Inﬂight Entertainﬁlent
Flight simulators were slow to take off with programmes
that were difﬁcult to use and were little more than sight-
seeing tours leaving the player to devise more and more
spectacular ways o f crashing. Flight simulators needed
more action. These high ﬂyers have plenty of action packed
into dogﬁghts and bombing raids and are as different as the
aircraft they simulate.
B24
R E V I E W S
In this latest combat ﬂyer you take control of not only one
plane but a full squadron of 40 B24's in bombing raids on the
oil reﬁneries of Ploesti, Rumaina. Your mission is to knock
out the oil supply for Hitler's war machines. The real B24
squadron that was given this task started with 60 aircraft
and were left with only four after ﬂying 50 missions. You
have only 40 bombers and 19 missions to knock out 12
targets.
With a mission that's tough you're going to need some
practice and so two other targets are included and so you

The following games are a selection from

Adriatic Sea from your base in Spinazzola, Italy) and the
heavily guarded Rumanian city of Bucharest. Survive these
training missions with your squadron in tact and you're
ready for the main event.
To help you plan your assaults the game disk or tape is
accompanied by a map of your targets and possible routes,
an intelligence report on Ploesti and an instruction booklet
that includes a step by step guide through the Mostar
mission.
The ﬁrst step of a mission is to take off and circle at
about 2000ft as the other planes slot into formation. Then
you must rendezvous with your ﬁghter escort, precede to the
target and start your bombing run. The effectiveness of your
run is increased if you're ﬂying at the correct height and
speed for your bomb load and deliver it on the target. Once
you've done this you should get out of the area as quickly as
possible and get your squadron back to base with as many
planes as possible ﬁt and fueled for the next mission,
B24 is one of SSI's superb strategy games and despite its
crude graphics, it's a frantic game to play. It was designed by
two bomber pilots, so you can be sure it's accurate, and you
can speed up real time to ﬂy past the long ﬂights to and from
11

the target. The game assumes that a d  ron Leaders know
how to ﬂy a plane and leave you with minimal controls but
plenty to do as you plan rendezvous routes with ﬁghter
escorts, bomb targets and return to base while coping with
damage to your own aircraft. One mission down. 18 to go
and you've already lost four aircraft and another six need
repairs!

Gunship
A former Game of the Month (Ma)r '87) Gunship took ﬂight
simulators to new heights and its players on 100 missions
that range from the training ﬁeld o f the USA to the
battleﬁelds of the world.
The Apache helicopter gunship is remarkably easy to ﬂy
considering there are 31 keyboard and joystick controls
thanks to a keyboard overlay and two 'ﬂy and ﬁght them'
tutorials.

When you've graduated from the training ﬁelds you're
ready for your ﬁrst sortie in South East Asia. After an
intelligence report and mission details of your primary and
secondary targets you must arm your Apache with a balance
of 30mm cannon ammo, Hellﬁre missiles, Flar rockets and
Sidewinder air to air missiles. The exact nature of your
weapons is decided by the mission you're on and the enemy
forces that you're expecting. Cannon ﬁre is good at close
range but you'll also need some Ffar rockets to take out
infantry and gun emplacements where as Hellﬁre missiles
are needed for armoured targets such as tanks and bunkers
leaving the Sidewinder to greet enemy Hind helicopters.
As you travel the globe from Asia to the Middle East,
Central America and Europe you'll be challenged by more
powerful and better equipped enemies and will need all your
electronic counter measures, ﬂares and chaffs to stay in the
air long enough to complete your mission.
Succesful missions will earn you points, medals and even
promotions until eventually you'll retire as a  heavily
decorated Colonel.

Aces of Aces
The Moquito ﬁghter bomber ﬂew a variety o f missions
during World War II and now it's your turn to take the
controls as you try to become the Ace of Aces.
The game begins in the brieﬁng room as the C.O.
outlines the tasks ahead to destroy the U-boats as they leave
their base, shoot down incoming bombers, deﬂect V-I
rockets and destroy a POW train but not the cars containing
the prisoners. These missions can be tackled individually but
to become the Ace of Aces you will have to tackle them all in
a single sortie.
To ﬂy the mission, you will have to master the controls
on ﬁve screens that show your left and right wings and
engines, bomb bay and weapon selector, operations map
and forward view from which you must ﬂy the plane and
shoot down enemy aircraft.
Ace of Aces owes a lot to an earlier Artech game based
on the Dambusters but features more options, missions and
a lot more action.

Here's a duo of destroyer action in which you must
protect the free world from air, sea and underwater attack in
Convoy Raider and Captain your ship in seven different
Destroyer missions ranging from a Subhunt to Convoy
Escort.
Convoy Raider
In Gremlin's Convoy Raider your mission is to patrol the
Inland Sea and attack and destroy any enemy planes. ships
or aircraft that you ﬁnd. Finding them isn't a problem as
they'll ﬁnd you even if you don't leave your port. Surviving
is the skill.
The ic tion is  controlled from ﬁve screens that are
accessed from a radar screen with three sweeping radar
displays showing the presence of any enemy in the sky, on
the surface or underwater_ If a blip shows up on any of these
must go the appropriate battleships. You must man the
-aircraft sea wolf missiles to shoot down enemy planes
or incoming Exocet missiles, the depth charge helicopters to
destroy submarines and guide y our  own Exocets t o
knock out enemy shipping. You must pilot your movements
around the Inland Sea using the map screen and assess the
state of your ship from the damage screen.
The action is fast and furious but isn't quite up to the
standards of the other simulations.

Destroye'c
Can you man 13 stations on a Fletcher class Destroyer, all at
the same time? Can you also use these stations to complete
one of seven missions on the high sea? You will need to do all
this and more as you take the helm in Epyx's Destroyer as
well as the radar, sonar, navigation, bridge, observation
deck, forward and aft guns, port and starboard anti-aircraft
guns. port and starboard torpedo tubes, depth charge and
damage control stations! You move between the stations by
typing in two letter codes such as BR for bridge and after a
few seconds you're faced with a new set of controls. Most
controls are self-explanatory such as  aiming guns o r
torpedoes before ﬁring or setting the depth charges to a
bracket o f  depths for  a better chance o f  taking out a
submarine.
In the controlled panic of a full mission you will need all
your skill and strategy to ensure that you get your shot in
ﬁrst, and that it counts as you can't afford long battles with a
single enemy ship when you've got a convoy to protect and
damage control crews to assign, a course to plot and so on_
An excellent multi-screen simulation.

The stealth of a submarine as it lurks unseen underwater
only to surface and strike at the heart of a convoy has always
been great material for a game. Until now, CM submariners
could only sign up for the Silent Service. Now they can also
go on patrol in Up Periscope and will soon be able to dive!
dive! dive! with the submarine version of Epyx's Destroyer.
Illionis based ActionSoft have produced one of the best

simulations you're ever likely to play as you take to the
depths in a World War II Beet class submarine.
The screen display is split into three sections. A strip
across the top of the screen shows the command options
available and highlights those selected. Below that a 3D view
displays what you can see from either the conning tower or
the periscope and below that is an instrument panel showing
your bearing. depth. speed, power, torpedos left and every
other dial or reading you'll need to ﬁnd your targets and sink
them.
If you select the charts to plot your position or the radar
to search for enemy destroyers or perhaps the torpedo data
computer to lock on target then the 3D view will swap to a
split-screen display with the instrument occupying the right
hand side and the important part of the 3D view on the left
The result works extremely well either in a practice mode or
on patrol in the Paciﬁc.
The graphics are quite exceptional and are the result of
ActionSoft using Sublogics 3D routines pioneered in its
ﬂight simulator.
A copy of  this game arrived in the VOW' Commodore
ofﬁce in an unmarked pack and it took some time to track
down where you could get it. There isn't a UK version of it
yet so if you want a copy of the game disk, instruction book
and tactics manual you'll have to get an imported copy from
Strategic Plus Software.

Silent Service
Silent Service was the ﬁrst submarine simulation to reach
these shores courtesy of US Gold.
Once the game has loaded and the scenario selected, the
program displays the bridge with y ou standing by  the
periscope, If you press the button you can see through the
scope (if you're not below periscope depth) but you can also
move the joystick to up up to the conning tower to ﬁre the
deck gun. to the map table to plot a route and to the
instruments to change course. Once selected the screen
changes to show the relevant display.
As in Up Periscope you can put your submariner skills to
the test in a series of scenarios and war patrols in which your
targets will be tankers and troop ships and your enemy the

destroyers. T o add to your problems you can include a
selection of reality factors such as poor visability. zigzagging
convoys, dud torpedos and the worrying expert destroyers.
Silent Service is the easier submarine game to play but
Up Periscope will provide a better campaign game. You may
even get promoted.

thousands of would-be programmers.
The main problem is that there are
very k w  training courses speciﬁcally
aimed a t  the Commodore 64 home
user. I  was myself involved with an
enterprise aimed at bringing Basic to
the masses through intensive weekend
courses. One message was clear, it is
not easy to learn from manuals alone
and most people require clear concise
instruction to help them understand
the whys and wherefores of speciﬁc
programming problems.
Having just alerted the Editor to
the apparent futility of this series I'd
better quic k ly  ex plain m y  Bas ic
philosophy!
This series will deal with all aspects
of Basic for the beginner, the crest-
fallen and the persistent keyboard
basher. I f  y o u  ﬁn d  y o u  d o n ' t
understand any area that we cover
during future months, pick up your
pen and write to me. If a routine in one
of your programs refuses to respond to
gentle persuasion, let me know. Before
I disappear under a ﬂood o f  white
envelopes I will say now that I can't
promise to have enough hours in a
week to answer all of your individual
problems but I do promise to give all
the help I can but only if you follow the
instructions at the end of this article.
Each month the article will deal
with a simple programming technique
followed by  a deeper dive into the
workings of the computer which may
be too advanced for those just wishing
to write some useful routines, but
which will provide the key to a fuller
understanding of computers for those
who wish to progress to machine code
routines later on.

Essential Attitude
A good attitude to take towards your
computer is to think of it as a foreigner
with a limited command of English.
The ﬁrst reaction a confused tourist
will ex perienc e i s  t h e  n a t u r a l
assumption that they're as thick as two
short planks and as deaf as a post. In
most cases this is not really a fair
attitude but with a computer nothing
could be nearer the truth. If you don't
believe me think of all the times the
machine has refused to perform the
simplest o f  tasks without fault and
consider w h y  w e  h a v e  t o  us e
CAPITAL LETTERS!
Presumably you will all have read
the erudite and deﬁnitive training
given in the Commodore manual and,
despite t h i s  h a n d i c a p .  h a v e
nevertheless gleaned a few of the very
basic commands available to you. I
will assume t h a t  y o u  c a n  n o w
successfully PRINT messages on the
screen and that you will also have
sussed the fact that programs consist
of numbered lines  o f  instructions
which the computer slavishly reads
and obeys unquestioningly. A simple
program would look like this:
10 PRINT "DON'T PANIC'
Type R U N  and the words DO N'T
PANIC appear on the screen. All very
comforting but not exactly useful.
We can get the computer to do
something fractionally more thrilling
by using a device known as a loop.
This causes the program t o  madly
repeat the program over and over
again. The simplest way to do this is to
add the line:
20 RUN
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
14
All this does is to get the program
to re-run time and again and, despite
the comforting message, it will induce
extreme panic in the beginner when
the wretched machine refuses to stop.
Don't reach f o r  the power switch.
simply pr es s  t h e  k e y  m a r k e d
RUN/STOP on the extreme left of the
keyboard and the computer will take a
break until you type in RUN again.
Believe it or not, one of the most
common faults  a t  t h is  lev el o f
programming is to forget to press the
RETURN k ey  when typing in  the
program. I f  y our  computer is n't
behaving p r o p e r ly  t y p e  L I S T
(remember to press RETURN ) and the
contents of the program memory will
be revealed.
Now that you're fully  equipped
with a way to drive computer salesmen
up the wall with eternally repeating
rude messages at your local computer
store let me say that he will not be
impressed w it h  y our  programming
style! Far better to substitute line 20 with:
20 GOTO 10
This simply tells the computer to loop
back and repeat line 10 ad nauseam or
until the RUN/STOP key is pressed.
Once again we have produced a
program w it h v ery  little practical
application except for hi-tech vandals
who make the saleman's life a misery
of continual vigilance.
To Usefully Go (To)
Before w e  s ee h o w  t h e  G O T O
command can be used in a sensible
way, we have one more kind of loop to
consider which introduces a  basic
concept used by  all programs: the
variable.

READY s o  t y p e  t h e  follow ing
program in:
10 FOR A= I TO 10
20 PRINT —
30 NEXT A
40 PRINT "FINISHED"
Run the program and you will ﬁnd the
phrase printed just ten times on the
screen. T o  explain this  miraculous
phenomenon concentrate on line 10.
The letter A is known as a variable.
The best way to imagine this is to think
of the computer as a stack of boxes.
We have asked the computer to mark
one of these boxes with a big letter A in
which it will store anything we say that
A is equal to. You may now think that
we've told the computer that A= I but
what about the TO 10 bit? The main
thing about a variable is that it can be
varied! We've told the computer that
A will vary between I  and 10, The
computer translates this as meaning
that A will have a value of one at the
beginning of the program so it stores
that value in the box labelled A.
The program then runs to line 20
and prints the message. Then when
line 30 is  translated the computer
checks back to where A= I TO 10 was
encountered and loops back to that
line. N o w  the clever par t occurs.
Checking the contents of box A the
computer ﬁnds that it still contains a
one. Having been told that A will vary
between I  and 10 it  increases the
content of the box by one so that A
now contains the value two. Line 20 is
obeyed and NEXT A is encountered
again so it loops back to line 10. Once
more the content of box A is increased
by one to three and the whole process
is repeated until A has a value of ten.
When A is increased the computer
checks to see if that number is greater
than ten. We have now reached the
point where A=10 and is incremented
to eleven this is bigger than ten and so
the program jumps to the line after the
NEXT A command and FINISHED is
printed on the screen.
How c an w e  prove that this
happens? First of all type PRINT A
and press RETURN. The value eleven
is printed on the screen, Hmm. it
seems plausible but we need proof.
B A S I C  T U T O R I A L
Semi Differences
Let's try something different. LIST 20,
move the cursor to the end of line 20
and type in a semi-colon. Press return
and LIST the program. Masterfully,
the computer should have inserted the
altered line in its correct place in the
program:
10 FOR A= I TO 10
20 PRINT —
30 NEXT A
40PRINT —
Change line 40 to read PRINT A
and run the program. This time the
message is printed ten times across the
screen with 11 printed at the end. The
semi-colon tells the computer that the
next PRINT statement will continue
from where the last print statement
leaves off. Alter line 40 to:
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
15
40 PRINTA:PRINT"FINISHED"
Re-run and you'll see that the number
11 is now printed on a separate line.
We hav e ended t h e  semi-colons
dictatorial reign. As you can see more
than one command can be written on a
program line as long as you separate
the commands by a colon. NEW the
program and type this in:
10 F O R  A = 1  T O  10:PR1NT A :
"DON'T PAN1C":NEXT A:? A
Don't worry about the question mark
in line 10. just type in the line as
printed here and run the new program.
This t i m e  t h e  messages a r e
preceded by  a number which is the
current value of A. List the program
and you'll ﬁnd that the question mark
has changed to the word PRINT. The
computer has a  built-in shorthand

1
which can save space and time. You
may have encountered listings which
have lines that the computer refuses to
accept because they stretch beyond
two lines of text on the screen. This is
known as the logical line length which,
logically, is the maximum length of a
line and equals 80 characters or  in
other words two screen lines.
We'll come back to this later so
store it as the back of your mind in a
box marked 'Don't Forget'.
Nine Times?
Let's put our  loop to some serious
work. A  computer is  more than a
sophisticated adding machine but it
can b e  us ed t o  bes t effect f o r
calculations. L e t ' s  c ons tr uc t a
program whic h produces the nine
times table, We could do this in the
long winded way which would repeat
lines such as:
10PRINT"2 X 9 =
20?"3 x 9 = " , 3 9
and so on, but using a loop simpliﬁes
all this typing:
10 FOR A=2 TO 12
.20 ?A:" x  9 = ",A*9
30 NEXT
You'll notice that I've failed t o
type A  after  N E X T  i n  lin e  30,
preferring to let the computer decide
which variable we're currently using.
This v a r ia b le ' s  n a m e  i s  n o t
particularly helpful when you come
back to look at the listing in ten years
time so why not use the computer's
ability to understand longer variable
names. I t  c ould easily b e  called
NUMBER instead of A, but you must
change the name in each line where is
appears.
We can run two loops at the same time
by placing one inside the other:
10 FOR MULT1PLIER=2 TO 12
20 FOR NUMBER=2 TO 12
30 '?NUMBER:" x":MULTIPL1ER:"
=":NUMBFR M U L T I P L I E R
40 NEXT NU,MU
Running this  program causes t he
computer to put up the full set o f
tables from two to 12 but it all goes too
quickly for any practical purpose.
You'll also notice that I've only
used the ﬁrst t w o  letters o f  each
variables n a m e  i n  t h e  N E X T
statement. The name of a variable is a
bit of a con because the computer only
B A S IC  T U T O R I A L
labels the relevant boxes with the ﬁrst
two letters o f  the variable's name.
When naming variables y ou i n
always remember this  because the
computer would treat variables called
MUL VIPLIER and MULTIPLICAND
as the single variable MU and chaos
would result.
Loops Within Loops
You'll also have seen that I've gone
back to naming the variables after the
NEXT statement. When more than
one variable is used it's safer to do
things this way but make sure that the
variables are named in  the correct
order. The computer will not accept
loops which are not properly 'nested'
inside one another. In other words the
Following is acceptable:
10 FOR A= I TO 10
20 FOR B= 1 TO 5
120 NEXT B,A
But in the following, the loops are not
nested lo o p s  a n d  w o u l d  c aus e
problems:
10 FOR A= I TO 10
20 FOR B= I TO 5
120 NEXT A,B
Meanwhile, back in our program
there is one way to make it easier to see
the times  tables  b y  adding t h e
following line:
40 NEXT NU
50 FOR DELAY=
60 NEXT MU
Now the program pauses between
each table printout. Line 50 simply
makes the computer count t o  250
before continuing. Tr y  varying the
value and see what happens.
Know Your Shorthand
Before I pull the plug on this week's
beginner's course let's go back to the
computer shorthand.
Apart from the question mark for
PRINT, most of the other keywords
can be shortened by using the ﬁrst one
or two letters of the keyword followed
by the next letter Shifted. The best way
to see this is to switch the computer
into lower case mode by holding down
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
16
the Sh if t  k ey ' a n d  pressing t h e
Commodore key once.
Type in the following:
10 ?:p0:nE:rU:reT
List the program and you'll ﬁnd the
keywords revealed in full. A full list of
abreviations can be found near the
back of your Commodore manual but
I included it here to show the number
of command keywords at your service.
The Deep End
The following line extends beyond the
logical line on the screen. Try entering
it as printed here and see what happens
when you press RETURN:
10PRINT " T H I S  W O U L D  N O T
FIT INTO ONE PROGRAM LINE":
FOR A = 1 T O  10:POKEIO24+A.0:
NEXT:?"BYE"
Next switch to lower case and enter
the line as follows:
10 ?"this  would n o t  ﬁt  in t o  one
program line", f0 a= Ito19:p0102-1-a,
0:nE:?"bye"
This t im e  t h e  lin e  goes  in t o
memory. L is t  i t  and i t  does the
impossible by  stretching over three
screen lines. Why?
To understand this phenomenon
you has t o  realise that every character
in a program line is stored as a separate
number i n  consecutive memor y
locations. Keywords are stored as a
single number no matter how long
their real name is. PRINT is stored in
memorY as the value 153 but in a
statement such as:
PRINT "PRINT YOUR N AME"
the ﬁrst PRINT would be stored as a
single byte of value 153 but the second
PRINT in the quotation marks would
be stored as a string of ASCII codes
for the relevant letters: 80,82,73.78 and
84, i t  were possible to poke a line
directiv i n t o  memor y  v o u  c ould
feasibly enter almost 40 keywords on
One line!

another within the same building, so a
phone line is not necessary but a fast
rate of transfer (baud rate — explained
later) is.
On the other hand, to transfer data
between different ofﬁces or between
your home and a computer miles away
necessitates the use of a telephone line
(except in  a  specialised ﬁeld where
data is  transmitted via satellite). A
telephone lin e  limits  t h e  r ate o f
transfer which can can take place.

C O M M U N I C A T I O N S
n order to connect your computer to
the phone line, there are two essential
items you need.
First of all, your phone line must
have the 600 Jack type sockets. These
sockets allow y ou t o  plug in  your
phone. answering machine or modern
providing o f  c ours e, t h a t  t h e
peripheral. i.e. V our phone or item that
you wish to plug in. is ﬁtted with a little
white plug.
Secondly you need a modem. The
word modem is an abbreviation of the
words MO Dulator  DEModulator .
The signals a computer understands
arc not the same as those which go
along a telephone line and therefore a
translation process is necessary at both
the sending and receiving ends. This
translation process is carried out by
the modem.
Also the software used depends on
the modem you use and the purpose
for which it is to be put. Some modems
come with software either in them (in
ROM) or on disk with them, others
require you to purchase the software
separately.
Before this question can be answered.
you have to decide what services you
want to access with your computer. in
other words you have to decide what
you want t o  d o once you have it
connected up. It's rather like buying
any other software: you have to decide
what features that software should
have. which will be dependent on what
you want to do.
The ﬁrst thing t o  consider when
deciding on which modem to use. is
baud rate. Baud rate is the rate at
which data transfer occurs and is
measured in  bits per second (bps).
(Remember that a single character is
made up of eight bits or one byte, at
least as tar as eight bit machines are
concerned.)
• Hewever. when characters are sent
from o n e  mac hine t o  another .
additional signals a r e  needed t o
indicate to the receiving computer. i.e.
'end of character'.

characters a second, you should divide
by ten. Thus a baud rate of 300 is
equivalent to 30 characters per second.
Also the maximum baud rate which
most telephone lines can use in this
country is 1200 bps,
The common baud rates used in
Britain over the telephone line are
300/300. 1200/75 and 120)/ 1200 •
When baud rates are written, the
downloading o r  receiving r ate i s
written ﬁrst and the uploading or
sending rate is written second. In two
out o f  three cases the rates in both
directions are the same,
The baud rate 1200/75 is  very
popular in Britain. (although never
used in America) enables information
to be received at 1200 bps, yet sends
information at only 75 bps. The baud
rate 300/300 is used for Telecom Gold.
Packet Switc h Stream (PSS) a n d
bulletin boards both in this country
and the USA.
The baud rat Z 1200/1200 is used
mainly for user-to-user ﬁle transfers
and fast upload by editors on Prestel
and Com pullet. This is also used in the
USA. Companies such as  Prestel.
Compunet. Telecom Gold. PSS and
bulletin boards favour 1200/75.

When dec iding whic h modem i s
needed, the next part to consider is
how to interface the modem to the
computer. The t w o  main interface
standards used are a) interfacing to the
cartridge port and b) interfacing with
the RS232 (usually via the user port).
This can be an important point t o
consider, e.g. if You plug a modem or
cartridge into the cartridge port of the
128 it willpower up as a 64. Also some
software will not let you print out via
the user port it' the modem is plugged
into the cartridge port, but this is much
more of a software problem.

where a 'page' of information comes
up in colour on your TV screen using
00/75 baud rate. I t  is  similar to
letext. but not identical.
Compunet is another system where
you receive a screenfull of information
at a  t im e  b u t  ar e it s  protocols
(parameters) different t o  those o f
Prestel? Hav e y ou t h 9 n d it  about
sending and receiving ﬁles v ia the
phone lin e  s o  y o u  c an wor k  i n
conjunction with your friends miles
away? Do you want to be able to look
at Bulletin Boards and if  so at what
baud rate? For the more adventurous.
how about running your own bu!letin
board o r  becoming a n  editor  o n
Prestel? Do you want to be able to
print the information out on paper
(e.g. a screen dump)? And so on.
Finally, ther e a r e  t h e  m o r e
'advanced' features which you look for
in a modem, e.g. can it autodia I? That
is. can you type in the number at the
keyboard and let the modem dial for
you? Can the modem a utoanswer. e.g,
if someone rings your number, will the
modem answer? This feature is only
really necessary if  you are running a
bulletin board and then it  becomes
essential. H a s  t h e  modem er r or -
checking? This is  a very important
feature i f  y o u  a r e  downloading
software, i.e. receiving a  tile fr om
another computer, e.g. Prestel, and
storing it on disk. Another question to
be asked is whether the modem is full-
duplex or half-duplex? Full-duplex isa
true two-way communication because
your computer screen displays what
you are typing, as well as what is being
typed o n  t h e  o t h e r  c omputer .
(Actually, whatever you type, is ﬁrst
sent to the other computer and then
sem back t o  y our  computer and
displayed on the screen. So if you are
using full-duplex and y our  ty ping
appears on screen, you know that the
connection has  been made,) Half-
duplex, however, lets you see only
what is typed on the other computer.
Some services use full-duplex and
others half-duplex. a n d  s o  i t  i s
necessary to consider this feature with
baud rate once you know how you will
be using your modem.

Today there are many modems on the
market. I  will discuss some of them,
along w i t h  t h e  v arious  software
packages that either come with them
or which can be bought separately.
This will provide you with sufﬁcient
information to let you investigate on
your o w n  before deciding whic h
products to buy.
This autodialling modem is no longer
being manufactured b u t  many  d o
exist. It is the most versatile modern. in
as much as you can access all sy•stems
with it. In fact, it is the onij• modem
which c an b e  used f o r  accessing
Compunet. The disadvantage of using
the Commodore modem is  that i t
works at 1200/75 or 1200/1200 (half-
duplex) and does not work at 300/300.

Modems from Tandata
Tandata M a r k e t i n g  L t d  h a v e
produced various modems which use a
serial interface from the I M  I I ( I which
could be used with the VIC2A). 64 and
128 at a cost of l.:99 compared with the
TM512E which costs £339. Tandata's

combinations of baud rate with both
full and half duplex along Ysith other
facilities, like being able to store your
phone numbers and passwords. This
means that in  order to log onto a
system you simply press a couple of
keys and the modem automatically
dials the appropriate number and logs
you on — very convenient, as lone as
the modem does not tall into the
wrong hands!

So far we has e said that you have to

software to do before obtaining your
modem. To do that you have had to
decide which computers you will want
to access. We will now take a briellook
at the main systems in Britain. namely
Prestel. Corn pullet and Telecom Gold,
Prest el
This is  British Telecom's viewdata
system. It is in colour with eraphics
and a screenitill of data is displayed at
a time. A screen of data is 2:' columns
high and 40 col MIMS wide. Although
British Telecom own the computers

information is  provided by various

information on almost every subject
including Agric ulture. Educ ation.
Banking, Microcomputing. Hobbies.
Trawl and Teleshopping.
Some of the I  Ps use Prestel as a
gateway to their own computers. i.e.
Prestel automatically connects you via
a phone link to another computer. On
Prestel there is the lacility to receive
and send mailboxes, receive and send
telexes, to download software and to
purchase certain items using y our
credit cards. You can even noyy use

games available (including multi-user
games) quizes anti competitions.
Prestel is also cheap. 99r, o f  all
people in the UK have local call access.
Even if  you are abroad you can use
PSS to access it. Computer connect
time is only charged from 8am to 6pm
Mondays to Fridays. At all other times
it is free. Most pages are also pros ided
free but some are charged for  (city

besides the Prestel subscription of 4

closed user groups (CUGS). Some
CUGs a r e  free. others ar e very
expensive. The Prestel Microcomp-

Mic ronet
The Prestel Microcomputing CUG is
owned hy a company called Micronet.
Micronet is the biggest IP on Prestel
which explains why they can produce
so many lovely things. The advantage
for newcomers w ho has C not y et
purchased a  modem, is  pac  kages.
These packages. usually £99 (although
l:1.29 for the Amiga) include a modem
and software for accessing Prestel pita

Prestel (which is worth if.64). So for i.:35
You get a modem and software. These
packages exist for the Commodore 64,
128. +4, Amiga and PC (as well as for
other micros).
Compunet
As 1
modem can be used t o  access this
system. A subscription to Compunet
can cost an% thing from £9 to i:15 a
quarter. depending o n  the type o f
account required. There are connect
time charges but some of these can be
dispensed with if  you have a G O LD
account (t15 per quarter). If you take
out a quarter's Gold subscription plus
post arid packing of 0.50, a modem
will he provided free of charge!
There is not local call access for
es en one. S o  why  use Compunet?
Com pullet does provide facilities that
Prestel does not, e.g. you can buy
items and have them charged to your
Comp LI net a c c o u n t  ( w h i c h  i s
something Prestel does  n o t  d o ) .
Compunet also has various I Ps but not
nearly so many as Prestel. but the
infOrMation on the system is all geared
to 64/128 users, but is not only to do
with Microcomputing — there is also a
hobbies section. Unlike Prestel where
viewers cannot edit or  upload pages
unless they have access to the editing
computer. C o m  pullet us er s  c a n
upload pages into an area called the
Jungle and without the need to use a

Compunet also has a useful editor

Compunet• Compunet als o has  a
duck shoot menu. so when you want to
go into the editor for example, you
mo‘, e the cursor until it gets to editor
and then press return. Prestel on the
other hand is  mainly  operated b y
numbers which originates from the
days when most terminals were not
al phanumberic. Prestel has recentl
begun to use words called keywords.
so instead of *  810714 y ou can key
RSGB o r  *  IC PUG tt T h e  main
disadvantage with Compunet is that it
is slow. but improvements are being in
the system to speed it up.
Telecom Gold
This is a scrolling system in black and
white, I t  is  ideal f or  sending and
receiving lo n g  documents o r  f o r
searching special databases which are

expensive a l  a minute). Telexes are
fairly cheap on Telecom Gold. There
are however, connect charges at all
times and these are expensive when
compared with Prestel or Compunet.
For example after 7pm in the evening,
Telecom Gold's connect charges are
three pence a minute, Prestel is Free
and Compunet is about 60 pence an
hour (a penny a minute), However. no-
one remains on Telecom G old For
long, it is not meant to be a system
which you browse around, although
various items o f  useful inlormation
and facilities a r e  provided. L ik e
Prestel it can be accessed by PSS.
Bulletin Boards vary considerably
and either use scrolling or view data
compatible software. One of the well-
known viewdata compatible BBs is
Databox. RSGB's bulletin board for
Amateur Radio Hobbyists (Tel 0707
52242). Like most Bulletin Boards few
phone lines are available which means
that you may ﬁnd it hard to get on to
the system at popular times or of course
the software can fall over!

produce backups of any program that
you o w n ,  inc luding c ommerc ial
programmes. This obviously raises the
question of copyright and piracy (or
theft as I prefer to call it). Evesham
Micros are well within their legal rights
to produce utilities such as this and
would say publicly that they do not
condone program theft. By stamping
the l e g e n d  S T R I C T L Y  F O R
l'ERSONAL U S E  ac r os s  t h e i r
instruction book let, they  absolve
themselves o f  any uses which t he
purchasers of the cartridge may put it
to. The misuser of the cartridge is the
thief.
It's a bit like buying a gun. The
purchaser is bound by the law not to
ﬁre the weapon in such a way as to
cause personal injur y  t o  someone.
That doesn't mean that shootings
don't occur and when one does the
legal process swings into action against
the user, not the manufacturer. This
analogy holds out quite well, but lied
I must point out that there is no such
thing in Law as accidental copying!
To own a backup you should also
have the original program, if you don't
then how can you plead innocence? If
YOU steal a program then it is not just
the company producing that package
that suffers but the programmer. Your
Commodore in no way condones the
theft of games but we cannot ignore
the fact that fast backup copies are
businesslike.
U T I L I T Y  R E V I E W
Freeze Machine is a combination of two of Eves/jam
Micros utility programmes encapsulated within a single
cartridge. Bringing together Freeze Frame MkV and
Laze,
a form which will reload in seconds rather than minutes.
By Erie Doyle
As a  j o u r n a l i s t  t h e  m a i n
application for my home micro is for
word processing. I  f a v o u r  t h e
Superscript package but it  takes 2
minutes 24 sec to set it up the way I
want it. Not a long time, but its over
tk4/0 minutes o f  not earning cash!
Could a fast load help me out? Yes.
with Freeze Machine it takes about 20
seconds using the Lazer loader and 50
seconds without it. Over a Year this
could increase my take-home pay by
over t 100, more than enough to cover
the cost of the cartridge, plus there are
all the other programmes I use ready to
be backed up.
"It's handy to be able to save
and load all my development
programmes at high speed and
this is possible with Lazer"
Lazer cartridge has two reset
buttons, one brings i n  the Freeze
facility and the other toggles between
the fastload and Lazerload menus.
In trials I was not convinced that
La Ler was necessary for two reasons.
Firstly, the fastioad facility was not
signiﬁcantly slower than Lazer but
secondly, and far more importantly.
the Lazer program tile is stored as a
locked USR ﬁle. This means that either
the cartridge or a 'boot' program is
necessary to load it and it always loads
at turbo speed. The effect of this is that
when your disk drive becomes slightly
misaligned or varies in speed later in its
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
23
life, all of your USR ﬁles will be useless
until your drive is repaired. This can be
a nuisance.
Turbo loader s  a r e  f a r  m o r e
sensitive to speed variation than is the
standard loading system. So a system
which offers both alternatives is the
belt and braces system for me. This
means the fastloader i n  the Lazer
cartridge.
Of course, backing up commercial
programmes is  just one use o f  the
cartridge. F o r  a  programmer lik e
myself it's handy to be able to save and
load all my development programmes
at high speed and this is possible with
Lazer, I can also fast-format disks and
use the DOS system to scratch and
validate ﬁles. The only thing I miss is a
built-in monitor  whic h w ould b e
useful. I'm spoilt because I must admit
to being the proud owner of Evesham
Micro's miraculous Dolphin D O S
system which makes Lazer look slow.
Evesham claim a  speed increase o f
over 20 times with Lazer but my tests
using a standard C64 came nowhere
near to this.
Inside the I,azer cartridge there is a
very powerful utility set for your C64.
It won't work  with every piece o f
commercial software on the market
but a large proportion Of them can be
backed up_ At t2.8.95 it's a steal!

So you Mill a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For example, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something lik e the
following at the head of the page:
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and wr ite i n  clear concise
English. it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of  each page you
should put the word MORE if there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances us e a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
II) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.

13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides. We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o

your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your

Using an
Epson-type
printer with
the C64
i
sometimes b e a  real chore. I t  is
necessary initially t o  obtain a n
interface cable to connect the C64's
user port to the printer's Centronics
interface. This can be bought for about
E20 (including some interfacing
software) or can be made for about 5.:8
if you are handy with a soldering iron
(see separate panel). N o  expensive
interface cartridges are necessary!
Connect the printer to the CM and
load up Easy Script. On the initial
screen you should enter a i n  printer
type and a 'C' when you are prompted
for interface type. From then on the
printer responds normally and you
may use a number of extra command
characters t o  exploit t h e various
modes of the printer. Some details are
found on the Easy Script disk in the
'IS.e1X/FX into' ﬁle which you can print
out.
Overcoming Problems in Basic
Listing B A SI C  programmes i s  a
possible problem since Epson printers
don't have the special Commodore

The Epson-Type printer is probably put to best use
when used in conjunction with a word-processing
program such as Commodore's OWn Easy Script.
cursor/colour co n t ro l symbols.
However, overcoming this is not too
difﬁcult — load and run the BASIC
extension program supplied with
November's Your COMIliodore, load
the program to be listed, and use the
CODE command to convert the listing
into a readable format without special
codes. Now open a ﬁle to disk or tape
and list the program as follows:
Disk: O PEN 2,8,2"0:programname.
TXT,S,W" : CMD2 : LIST
Tape: OPEN 2,1,1,"Programname.
TXT" : CMD2 : LIST
This writes the program as a text
tile. I f  you now use Easy Script you
should be able to load this ﬁle and
print it as normal. This has the added
advantage that your listing will have
pagebreaks that don't print over the
perforations. Also you can re-format
the listing t o  indent F O R /N EXT
loops, etc.
Without the Basic Extension
If you don't have the BASIC extension

then d o n ' t  w o rry, a n y  special

x Commodore 64 user port edge
connector for the C64 end.
3m x  12 core shielded round cable.

to Easy Script since Precision Software
had Epsons i n  mind. when they
designed the program.
These Features are accessible by
pressing< ﬂ > and then one other key.
Other functions must be sent to the
printer as a row of characters. usually.

In order to use these it is necessary to
predeﬁne a special character for each
code and assign that character the
required decimal value.
Easy Script provides up to ten such
special characters which can be used

character of ASCII value 65 to key 6
and a value of 67 to key 8 type a line in
Easy Script as follows:

Now pressing< f I> followed by a '6'
should produce a reverse '6'. When
printed this character will act as if it

A
that may be paid to the C64 is that it
has encouraged many' a programmer
to learn machine code, the reason
being that its  space-saving Basic is
rather slow for some types of program.
However, there are programmers
who do not necessarily agree that a
move to machine code is a progressive
step. T o  meet these programmers'
needs, many machine code routines
have been written which augment the
C64's Basic. The following describes
three more.
The programs have been written in
recognition that the 64's 40K of Basic
bytes can be severely drained by the
need t o  store data. This  data may
represent n u m e r i c a l  o r  t e x t
information. sprites or perhaps screen
data and associated colour memory.
The 4 K o f  memory from 49152 to
453247. whilst easy t o  address, is
nevertheless r ather  limited. T h e
programs we are to meet here, known
by mnemonics M E X .  M A V E  and
SYSSY, make the 8K RAM. hidden in
the shadow of  the Basic interpreter,
much more accessable in Basic.
The shadow memory refered to,
between 40960 and 49151 and known
as L O R  AM. i s  actually perfectly
simple to POKE to in the normal way.
The CM knows that it is futile to try to
write to ROM, and so responds to any
attempt t o  do Sc) by  switching the
ROM out and the RAM in to receive

Use the shadowy area of your computer's memory to

you need t o  switch the RO M out:
however. this  R O M  i s  t he Basic
interpreter and with it switched out,
the P E E K  instruction c annot b e

The answer is to utilise a short
machine code program whic h c an
access t h e  Shadow  R A M .  T h e
program here is called MEX, short for
Memory Ex c hange. M E X  w i l l
exchange any nominated segment of
memory for any other of identical size.
If a chosen area includes that from
40960 to 49151. then LORAM will be
exchanged. T his  allows  t he Basic
programmer to LOAD or POKE data
to LO RAM (sprite data perhaps or a
screen), a n d  w hen required. c a ll
MEX and swap it  for  similar data
which is not required for the moment,
and which is in memory-accessable to
Basic. N o  data is lost: calling MEX
again will re-exchange each byte back
to its original place, or to some other
position if you change the parameters.
Before using M EX it is necessary to
decide on three pieces of information:
the number of' 256-byte blocks to be
exchanged and the two addresses from
which they are to start.
As a n  example, suppose y o u
wished t o  swap the 8k  bytes from
32768 to 40959 for that in LO RAM
from 40960 to 49151 inclusive. First.
remember that the area 32768 to 40950

should have been protected from being
over-written by Basic if  you want to
use it  for  data storage. D o  this by

string storage. and 56. the highest
address used b y  Basic. w it h  128

memories to be exchanged is 8k, which
equates t o  8*IO24 o r  8192, s o the

although it has been put at 50000, and

Where MAVE differs from other
SAVE utilities is that, should you have
data stored in LO RAM. then it will
save this , r ather  than t h e  Ba s k
interpreter ROM.
Overcoming LOAD Problems
Unfortunately, there is a disadvantage
to using a cassette when LOADing to
'D R AM. The CM loading system will
LOAD your data into LORAN& but
this data is recorded twice on your
tape, and at the second pass the system
compares the tape data w ith that
supposedly LOADed on the ﬁrst pass.
This is  normally a  good check for
LOAD errors, but when loading to
LORAM t h e  check i s  made, n o t
against the contents of that area. but
against the ROM above it. The result is
an error message which you can ignore
in immediate mode, but which stops a
program if  the LO AD is made from
within it.
LOADing data into high memory
from disk can also be a source o f
annoyance, but this time, the difﬁculty
occurs in immediate mode rather than
from w i t h i n  pr ogr ammes . T h e
problem reveals itself as an out o f
memory error, the system assuming
that because the last data was high in
memory, everything below it is full.
SYSSY overcomes b o t h  thes e
quirks. SYSSY starts 155 bytes after
MEX and so, i f  you keep the basic
loader start at 50000 and then make
the variable SY equal to 50155, you
call it as follows:
SYSSY,"NAME". 1,1
for tape or
SYSSY."NAME". 8.1
for disk.
MEX. M A V E  and SYSSY have
been kept quite simple. using many
routines already resident in the 64. so
that they will not take hours to type in
via the single Basic loader SHADOW.
Nevertheless. it is worth testing them.
and practicing their  use w ith the
short Basic programmes listed here
called SCREEN TEST land SCREEN
TEST 2.
Testing
First L O A D  and R U N  SH AD O W
and, i f  the computer responds with
"OK". delete the Basic loader with
NEW. Next type in SCREEN TEST
which operates as follows:-
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987

Line 5 sets the character colours.
This line is required only  on older
C64s. I f  POKE 1024.160 on a freshly
switched-on c omputer  does  n o t
produce a square in the top left hand
corner, you will need this line.
Line 10 sets the variable M EX to the
start address of the program;
Line 20 draws a series of vertical lines
onto the screen:
Lines 30 through 60 draw a similar set
of horizontal lines in LORAM:
Line 70: the SYS command directs the
program t o  the routine M EX.  the
memories to be exchanged to start at
1024, (the screen) and 40960. (the
start of LORAM), and the amount of
memory involved to be 4 blocks of 256
bytes which equates to 1024, exactly
one screen's worth of data:
Line 80 ensures that the exchange
occurs whilst the ﬂying spot. which
traces your T.V. picture, is off the
screen:
Line 90 loops back to re-exchange the
data.
SAVE and RUN SCREEN TEST.
Note how slowly the vertical lines are
drawn in Basic and wait a little longer
for the horizontal lines to be drawn in
LORAN& As soon as MEX is called.
however, the speed o f  the machine
code p r o g r a m  i s  im m e d ia t e ly
evident, as it alternately exchanges the
vertical a n d  horizontal lines fr om
screen to LORAM. In fact, the speed
of interchange produces a chLquered
pattern which is even more apparent if
line 80 is deleted.
Now press RI IN/STOP and SAVE
the pattern in LOR AM with:
SYS50075.40960.41984."PAITERN"
If using disk. then the last digit should
be set to 8. As with standard SAVE
routines you may add a ﬁnal .1 as a
secondary address to ensure that the
pattern LO A Ds back to the memory
Iron whic h it was SAVE& This can
also be achieved by  adding.I when
LOADing.
Now modify SCREEN TEST I to
make program called SCREEN TEST
2. In the neW program:
Line 1 is simply an aid to memory:
Line 10 ensures the program RUNs
from l i n e  2 0  a f t e r  L O A D i n g
"PATTERN":
Line 15 has to be added. SYSSY calls
the LOAD routine, and is actually SYS
SY where SY = 50155:
Lines 20 to 50 are modiﬁed so as to
draw a  diagonal pattern. w hic h

contrasts w i t h  t h e  horiz ontal o r
vertical lin e s .  w hic hev er  w e r e
LOADed with "PATTERN",
Line 60 is no longer used, and should
be deleted:
Lines 70 to
Arhen it is RIJN. SCREEN TEST 2
90 remain unchanged.

Electronic Research (YER) is  a no
frills two-pass assembler which eases
the problems of coding considerably
by allowing labels to be used. This
means that subroutines can be called
by giv ing them a  name o f  y our
choosing and variables used within the
routine can also be named. It's easier
to explain this by example.
Let's us e a  s hort routine f o r
clearing four lines of the C64 screen in
conventional mnemonic form:
C000 L D Y  $ 2 8
C002 L D A  # $20
C004 STASO3FF.Y
C007 S T  ASO427A
COOA STA$44F,Y

C010 D E Y
C011 BNESC004

York Electronic Research is a small company
specialising in hardware and software utilities which are
worthy of more attention. The latest releases include a
6502 assembler and a Z80 camp der for the C64.

As you can see the purpose of the
routine is much clearer and the facility
to inc lude R E M  s ty le statements
following a semi-colon adds to the
clarity, The main advantage is that
jump and branch calls rely on a label,
not a  ﬁnite memory location. This
means that adding a line within the
program automatically adjusts the
calls accordingly on assembly of the
ﬁnal code. Relocation is also easier. By
simply changing the ORG address, the
assembler will then use this as the base
address for all jumps and branches.
Although I'v e said that YER's
assembler is lacking in frills this has
the advantage o f  leaving 3 9 K o f
memory free for program workspace.
Add t o  t h i s  t h e  f a c t  t h a t
programmes c an b e  chained onto
one another and you soon see the
power that this utility conceals.

There are only  fourteen editor
commands:
A -  assemble current source text
lEk- return to Basic
C v er if y  a saved ﬁle
D delete lines
E -  edit a line
G g e t  a ﬁle from tape/disk
H -  hunt text for a string
I -  insert new lines in text
I. -  list a line, set L
N -  clear memory (new)
O -  recover text (old)
P -  save text to tape/disk
S -  deﬁne output device
✓ -  list text to screen
Some kind of DOS to call up disk
directories and scratch unwanted ﬁles
would have been a sensible addition,
but this  would b e at  the cost o f
assembler program space. At least you
can always switch back and forth from
program control t o  Basic without
disturbing your assembler code.
Within the actual assembler listing
the normal mnemonic codes work as
expected but there are ten directives to
assist program writing:
LOF
LON
CHN
BEG

Pr
DBY
DWO
SPC
POK

AUT
At assembler code generation time
LOF and I O N  simply suppress o r
enable the listing o f  the assembled
code to go to the monitor screen. As
printing to the screen takes time, a
• signiﬁcant increase in assembly time
can be gained b y  suppressing the
screen display of  the code when the
assembly option (A) is employed.
CHN and BEG always appear at
the end of programmes when several

listings are chained together. C H N
tells the assembler to load the next part
of the chain during assembly, and
BEG is used at the end of the ﬁnal part
of the chain so that the second pass can
be initiated from the ﬁrst part program
of the assembled chain.
The reason the chain has to be
loaded twice is that the ﬁrst pass sorts
out the labels and their related actual
address in the assembled code. The
second pass is to insert these ﬁnite
addresses into the code as it assembles.
DBY and D WO  are used when
look u p  tables are inserted into a
listing.DBY stands for Deﬁne BYtes

string of bytes. For example:
DBY 147, " R EAD Y"
This would store the clear screen
(147) value as the ﬁrst byte followed by
each value for the word READY in the
following ﬁve memory locations.
DWO is followed by a series ()liable
names used i n  t h e  program. A t
assembly time the program stores the
high and low bytes o f  the memory
locations o f  the label as a look-up
table.
SPC is followed by a number which
allows a gap of up to 256 bytes to be
placed within a program to leave space
for variables and arrays.
At assembly time you have two
options. The code can either be poked
directly to its ﬁnal address or stored as
a basic booted relocator program.
The s tr aightfor war d memor y
assembly i s  directed t o  t he start
address by the POK command. In our
screen clearing routine PO K 49152
would cause the assembler to try to
poke the code directly into memory. In
this case a clash with the storage area
of t he ac tual assembler program
• would cause an OUT OF MEMORY
message to be generated forcing the
use of the second assembly method.
0 RG assembles the program in the
low basic programming area preceded
by a routine which will move the block
of code to its actual execution address
when R U N  is  entered. T he A U T
command can also be used for force
the boot program to jump to the new
code without having to enter a SYS
command.
On the whole the assembler works
well but correction of a bad line is a
long-winded affair. I f  an error has
been entered i n  line 0006 o f  the
program, the correction routine would
look like this:
L6 l i s t  correction line
0006 LDM # WIDTH
DI delete that one line
I i n s e r t  a line
0006 LDY # WIDT H
The instructions are good but the
area of saving assembled code is not
covered in sufﬁcient detail. There is no
way within the program to save the
assembled code so a return to Basic
must be made and a save can then be
made u s in g  t h e  n o r m a l S A V E
command. None of this gets a mention
which could confuse a beginner, and it
took me a while to work it out for
myself.

Nevertheless the York Electronics
Research Assembler is one that I
would recommend f o r  someone
makine, their entry into machine code
programming. A l l  o f  the essential
features are included within th e
program. and there are not enough
commands to confuse a novice.
The Z80 Emulator
The second of Y ER's products is the
Z80 Emulator. Before going any
further I would just like to say that this
is purely an educational aid. There is
little possibility o f transporting the
code directly across to a Spectrum or
Amstrad machine. This is an emulator
not a simulator.
For a loing time after mastering
6502 machine code I wanted to try Z80
code, but I was inhibited by the fact
that I'd have to buy another computer
to do so. If only this emulator had been
available then I  would n o t have
had to  shell out a  fortune on a
machine I don't really need.
The Y  ER emulator is really a
compiler which takes each Z8 0

command and translates i t into a
corresponding piece of 6502 code from
a library stored on disk. It's a bit like
Basic really in the sense the interpreter
takes the Basic keyword and executes a
corresponding piece o f  code. The
result is that the program runs more
slowly than a dedicated machine code
equivalent as is the case with this
emulator. A  compiled Z80 program
runs at about a sixth of the speed of a
dedicated 6502 routine. Not that this
matters a great deal as long as it runs
well enough to show if the Z80 coding
would work.
The Z80 assembler is a lot more
ﬂexible than YER's 6502 equivalent
and includes facilities such as search
and replace, a simple delete command,
hex/decimal/binary calculator and a
complete DOS support.
The actual assembler listing
follows almost the same conventions
as laid down by the 6502 assembler
except that the code follows the correct
Z80 mnemonic system.
Any emulation o f one CPU by
another is liable to compromises in the
interests o f speed and efﬁciency. In
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
40
this case only the essential Z80 ﬂags
are supported: carry. zero a n d
interrupt. With the exception of the IR
pair, all o f  the CPU registers are
supported, including th e  tw i n
alternative set o f registers. The net
effect of these omissions is that some
of the commands cannot be supported
by the emulator. This is limited to 20
speciﬁc commands and doesn't cause
any problems in learning Z80 code.
After writing your code in the
assembler editor, you then save it to
disk and load the compiler program.
The compiler produces the object code
which in turn is converted into the
ﬁnal 6502 version by the special saver
program.
This is a novel and relatively cheap
way of becoming familiar with the Z80
environment.

he Action pack series are compilations o f  Alligata
programmes that are sold exclusively through W.H. Smith,
This, the third in the series, contains the Commando style
shoot 'cm up, Who Dares Wins II, an odd arcade game
called Kettle, the terrible Indoor Bowling and superb Trap.
In Who Dares Wins II you're a man with a mission, a
machine gun and eight grenades. Your objective is to single
handedly take enemy outposts and free any  o f  your
comrades that need your unique (blast everything) help.
Indoor Bowling is a ten-pin bowling style of game but it
lacks four pins and any point. The six pins that are there to
be bowled over defy most of the laws of physics when they
move as when you get a strike they all fall over, in perfect
formation as soon as you touch the ﬁrst pin.

arm level to level you must ﬁnd the tin opener that's hidden

to wipe out aliens. A  weird game but fun to play
cularly if you like kettles.

The ﬁnal game, Trap, is undoubtably the best of the
compilation and after a simple but ship expensive charge
through an asteroid belt becomes a Zaxxon style game in
which you must zap aliens, disable lasers, collect fuel, shoot
spy eyes (if these escape they alert the dreaded polic craft) all
to collect orbs to gain a better ship to survive a harder
course.
The skill of the game (apart from surviving) is to plan
your attacks so that you take out the levels aliens ﬁrst
(there's only a set of quota of aliens per level) before blasting
the boats and lasers to get through to the end of the zone
where you have to proceed on foot, past walkways to claim
your orb. A great shoot 'em up in the ﬁnest tradition.
Trap and Who Dares Wins I I  are the games worth
considering in this compilation, and the others should be
viewed as a bonus. I f  you've got neither then it's worth a
look but if you've already got one of these think again,

and I'm hooked!
You play a highly trained helicopter pilot on a mission to
rescue your trapped buddies. Their ground bases have been
blown to bits and they are sitting ducks, out in the open as
enemy planes and other deadly aircraft swamp the sky - you
are their only hope. Fly into the invaded territory and shoot
down all aircraft (well, as many as You can) but most
importantly rescue your pals.
Your helicopter has been ﬁtted with the latest hydrolic

The background is very impressive and gives the true

ut in the far reaches of space, in the farthest Galaxy, a
huge money war is being pledged. Well, not exactly money
but space birds known as grifﬁns, You see as this bird was
acclaimed a galactic delicacy, and acquired such value it
came to be used as an extremely valuable unit of inter-
galactic currency, traded o n  the stock market o f  the
universe.
On t he moon o f  a  f a r - a r n  planet, a  gang o f
unscrupulous mercenaries have been secretly breeding the
tasty space grifﬁn and plan to ﬂood the market with them.
This would of course throw the monetry systems up in the
air, allowing them to sieze over all power.
This can not be allowed to happen so starﬂeet command

trick and anyone caught breeding them. Rut due to an error
on the communications computer the dodgy captain Rover
Armstrong was sent instead. O f  course, he was vastly
inexperienced but the task is simple enough -just capture or
destroy all the grifﬁns on the planet. The grifﬁns note his
arrival and promptly make themselves scarce, (not so easy
after all!). Captain Rover gets help from the scout ships that
drop off various supplies to help catch the birds, such
as speed. When you are nea ring the grifﬁn, press the button

and you will leap, hopefully right onto the grifﬁn back.
and then you eat him. Other goodies include the space
explosives (my favourite) when you are right near the grifﬁn
they will slow down but won't let you get too close. just
select this weapon. push the button and POW feathers ﬂy
(bee, bee!).
There El IC loads of different traps and such like and even
when ou've seen them all, this is a fabulous arcade game
combined with a fair bit of strategy.
For just over a ﬁver this game represents very good
value, nice sound ( Robb Hubard), amazing parallax
background.

cause him to %Yalk into one of the hazards :%ou have
avoided, then so much the better.
Although a  nice idea, 1 found Road Runner totally
lacking in playability on the cassette version. Each level,
although short, has to be loaded in separately from tape.
When you die, the tape has to be rewound as you start again.
Even if you take the profferred short cut to the last level you
reached in the previous game, you have to wait for all the
intermediate levels to load in one by one. If Road Runner
had to wait this long, he would have been barbecued long
since.
If you can put up with the problems of using the tape, the
game itself seems to be a competent version of the arcade
version and fans w ill n o doubt want t o  buy  a  copy.
Otherwise, it's a case of try before You buy. That's all folks.

bats and green slimy arms that try to grab you as you pass.

dangerous as contact with lava results in the immediate loss

you need to ﬂex your ﬁre button ﬁnger then load in
Terra Nova and get zapping. It's a no frills shoot 'em up in
which you have four zones to clear. In Terra Nova 'clear'
means blast everything to smithereens.
To complete the game (which is extremely unlikely) you
must blast your way through each zone three times! The ﬁrst
trip is the relatively easy one as you can ﬂy and blast away
quite happily without worrying about fuel or ammo, but in
the next two ﬂights you must collect these by destroying the
enemy dumps.
Your main hazards come in the form of alien crafts that
buzz you and space mines that you can't shoot but which
wreck you. The mines are ﬁred by ground installations that
must be destroyed to gain points and reduce the number of
mines, leaving you to dogﬁght with the aliens.
The ﬁrst zone is set in space and once you complete that,
three times. you can tackle the battles of a ground base. an
Earth like landscape and the high seas.

In other words, the game consi.-i., of a large maze and
you must wander around it collecting objects and solving
problems. As  you progress, you must relocate the nine
planets in their correct place around the sun.
Not all areas of the maze are immediately accessible to
you. Walk in
behind you, trapping you if you have not taken sufﬁcient
care over your route. Arrows point the way but their main
use is that when you stand next to them, they cause doors to
open elsewhere in the maze: causing a lot of backtracking.
As your progress further, so there are items to be collected
which are then used to remove further obstacles in your
path.
'Fhe maze is constructed of brightly coloured blocks and
designs — graphically simple but effective enough. Certain
blocks are lethal to touch but it shouldn't be too difﬁcult to
work out which ones they are as skull and crossbones
usually tend to conceal something nasty!
Lack of any sort of action is likely to limit the appeal of

I'm afraid that this is yet another example of a dreadful
licensed game. Companies pay a lot of money to use a title
like this and are obviously eager to get something onto the
market to recoup their investment asquickly as possible. All
this pressure can only squeeze one thing t h e  game, and it
shows. In Laurel and Hardy. the action is spread over too
great a  distance which makes the gameplay extremely
tedious in the extreme. Less than adequate game control and
display don't help either. The result is a poor man's Spy
versus Spy.
Perhaps if software houses took the time and money to
employ the services of a games designer and graphic artist
rather than expect the poor programmer to come up with
ideas, graphics and music as well as code everything,
licensed games might have a better reputation. With Laurel

and Hardy, as 011ie might have said. 'Here's another tine
mess.'

ave you ever played those table football games where
H
the pieces are controlled by turning handles? Well, now you
can bring the excitement into your home and onto your
computer screen at a budget price.
The game is only a two player game in which left and
right joystick pushes move the selected bar (this is the one
nearest the ball) and forward and back to kick.
The game is a best of nine goals match with the current
score displayed on the pitch and not in the oceans of room
above the table.
Budgie isn't the ﬁrst software house t o  attempt t o
computerise table football, indeed Bubblebus produced a
good version called Kick-off. This is not a good version for
two annoying reasons.
Firstly all the players look as if they standing upright but
aren't as the ball will pass under them unless you kick it. This
is, of course nonsense and spoils the game as well as stopping
the players trapping and controlling the ball and turns the
game into a kicking match. Secondly, should you score a
goal (these can sometimes be scored by kicking the ball past
the post??) your opponent may get the goal or occasionally
both of you get it!
Even if the program wasn't bugged. it just wouldn't be
worth the money even at a budget price.

I unctions and commands. F or  example, the search and
replace command 'the' will ﬁnd 'the' and 'The' but the
command Vthe' is even more powerful as it ﬁnds part
words such as 'there' and 'whether'.
Once you've created your letter, memo or article vou can
preview to see what it will look like on paper and then check
it with the impressive Spell-Right and get a word and
character count.
Spell-Right is supplied on a separate disk so you must
save your document and then load it in for checking. The
Spell-Right disk is double-sided and both must be used in
turn to check words that begin with letters between A and N
and 0 and Z. This takes a while particularly if you've added
your own dictionary to the 50.000 words that are already
checked.

Once the program has ﬁnished it highlights any words it
can't ﬁnd. These can be altered, ignored or added to another
dictionary. I f  you don't know how to spell a word you can
have another go. and have that checked or you can even get
Spell-Right to list all the similar words it can ﬁnd for you to
choose between!

Filer's Choice
Every integrated package needs a database program to store
and organise information so that it can be updated, sorted
into order and then printed out by the word processor.
A Filer's Choice database consists of records that are
created by typing on a screen and can be between 20 and 80
lines long. To create a database you simply have to type on
the screen the records you want to keep and then save them
to disk. You can then add new entries, delete records or edit
existing ones, sort the whole ﬁle into alphabetical order (to
whatever is deﬁned at ﬁeld I ) and search for a speciﬁc record
or group of records by setting greater than and less than
parameters.
Once you have the information stored in a format that's
easily edited and updated you'll want to do something with it
such as create mailing lists and print out labels and other
reports or lists. Creating a report is easy as the program
presents you with a list of the ﬁelds in each record in your ﬁle
and all you have to do is put them in the order you want them
on your form. You don't have to include all of them (indeed
a useful printout is a list of phone numbers) and you can
signal the computer to print more than one on the same line.
This report or print out can then be displayed on the screen,
saved to disk to be used with Writer's Choice or printed out
directly.

Planner's Choice
Planner's Choice is  the thir d and ﬁnal par t o f  this
application program package and features a fully ﬂedged
spreadsheet program for planning your ﬁnances and asking
those 'what ir  questions. What if VAT goes up, what if the
cost of disks doubles, what if I sell 20% more games, what
will happen to the price Mega Game 3? The answers and
many more can be posed and answered by a spreadsheet
S O FTWA R E  R E V I E W
CELL A C , 1 5  2 8 5 6 3  BY TE S  R E C A L C
J a nua r y  F e b r u a r y
The uses and applications of a word processor and a
database are obvious but w ho would use o r  need a
spreadsheet? The answer is that you don't need a multi-
million pound budget to gain from using a spreadsheet. Club
treasurer's, comparing investments o r  home and t a x
accounts are all made easier by using a spreadsheet and even
if you're planning to run your own business, a spreadsheet
printout will impress the bank manager.
Unfortunately, the spreadsheet screen looks daunting
with only a few lines that outline the cells of the programmes
work space. By using the Planner's Choice manual you'll
learn that each of these cells can contain text (a heading so
that you understand what's going on), ﬁgures and formulas
to add up the contents of other cells or perform calculations.
With these you can add up the subscriptions you've received.
deduct the heating and lighting bills and rent of your club
house and ﬁnd out how much you've got left for trips or
equipment and see whether this ﬁgure is increasing or
decreasing, in which case you'll have to increase your subs.
Similarly, a businessman can calculate proﬁts, expenses and
wages to set prices to keep the taxman at bay and be ready
for any crisis such as the Chancellor deciding to put up beer_
petrol or VAT.
By changing a single ﬁgure you can create a whole
different set o f  circumstances which the program can
recalculate in seconds giving you the new results and a jump
ahead of the opposition.
Once your spreadsheet is complete you can either save it
to disk and incorporate it into a word processor document or
print it out individually directly from Planner's Choice.
The Personal Choice Collection is a powerful trio of
packages that will put your C64 to work. There is also Cl28
versions that load automatically from disk that basically
extend the screen size fr om 40 t o 80 characters. The
collection is a little expensive at 09.95 but does contain all
you need to write documents and check the spelling, store
information and get your ﬁnances into shape. The packages
are easy t o  use and ar e supported b y  some superb
documentat ion_

commonplace within game programs.
Such messages can range from game
instructions to amiable slanders about
friends a n d  o t h e r  programmers.
Here's a routine that allows you to
scroll a message up to 255 characters
long across the top of the screen.
Drawing borders and lines, and
doing it quickly, is very important in
games writing. So. I've also presented
a routine that enables you to plot small
blocks extremely quickly at any point
on the screen_
Get It Scrolling
The r outine presented her e f o r
scrolling messages is nothing to jump
up a n d  d o w n  a n d  s hout about.
However it is a simple but effective
lay of producing your own scrolling
messages.
As usual there are three programs
associated w ith the message scroll
routine. Firstly, we have the Basic
loader, called 'MESSAG E L O AD -
ER'. This routine holds the necessary
machine code within Basic D A T A
statements. These are then PO KEd
into the correct area of memory when
the program is  RUN. T he second
listing, 'MESSAG E M / C ' ,  i s  a n
assembly version o f  the program so
that those of you interested in machine
code can see how the program works.
The t h i r d  r out ine,  ' M E S S A G E
DEMO', is  a simple demonstration
that shows the program in operation.

Producing your Own scrolling messages and plotting on
the screen.
By Tony Crowther
Using The Routine
The scrolling is extremely simple to use
and should cause you no problems. It
does require the IRQ  DAT ABASE
routine to be in memory before you
RUN. For those of you who missed the
IRQ DATABASE in the March 1987
issue o f  Your  Commodore 1 have
included it here. To use the routine you
should follow this procedure:
I) POKE 839.0
2) Clear the screen.
3) Print the message on the screen (255
characters long).
4) Type S Y S  50817, C O L O U R .
SPEED.
5) Clear the screen.
6) POKE 839. 1 to return the message
on.
The values f o r  CO LO UR are the
normal colour codes as described in
your manual.
SPEED should be between 0 and 8,
where 0 means stop and 8 is fastest.
If you are still unclear as to what you
should d o  read the example —  it
should make things clearer.
Screen Plotting
The second routine presented here
allows y o u  t o  plac e a  quarter-
character sized block, 4 x 4 pixels, at
any speciﬁed position on the screen in
any colour.
At ﬁrst glance this routine will
appear to be of  little use in arcade
programming, however it will become
invaluable when drawing borders or
lines on the screen.
YOUR COMMODORE oetober 1987

Once again three programs are
presented. T h e  ﬁr s t .  * P L O T
LOADER', is the Basic loader for the
PLOT routine. The second program,
'PLOT M / C ' ,  is the machine code
version o f  the program. As  usual a
demonstration i s  included. ' PLO T
DEMO', showing the program in use.
The syntax f o r  this  routine is  as
follows:
SYS 50616. X. Y. COLOUR
where X  is the range 0-79 and is the
horizontal co-ordinate for the dot. Y is
in the range 0-49 and is the vertical
co-ordinate of the dot.
Colour is a standard colour code (0-15).
Brought Forward
In the last gripping episode I set you a
couple o f  tasks to perform with the
routines that I had already published. I
am sure that you all managed to carry
out the speciﬁed tasks without too
many problems. Just i n  case y ou
didn't. I  hav e included here m y
versions of the programs.
The ﬁr s t  p r o g r a m  ' D E M O
EXTENSION', links together the two
sprite routines and produced ani-
mated, moving sprites. The second
routine, ' H EL I  D EMO '  moves last
month's sprite around the screen.
If you couldn't get your own sprites
moving then following these programs
through should make life easier.
REMEMBER before you RUN any
of these programs you must have the
relevant routines from my  previous
articles in memory or your computer
will crash.

A
the Editor but Pirates. the swashbuckling game of derring-
do and blood and thunder (or. in my case, thud and blunder)
from those masters of the simulation -  Microprose.
It is  the seventeenth century and like many of sour
compatriots. you decide to seek your lame and fortune on
i lie high seas. Just how your career develops is up to you.
Maybe you fancy becoming an outright pirate. plundering
anything that you can get your hands on regardless of its
country or origin. Or perhaps you would rather serve King
,ind Country (England. France. Holland Or Spain) as a
privateer: in which case you act as a sort of legalised pirate.
pros iding y
dehisions of grandeur. you can try and emulate the feats of
some of history's greatest mariners -  Francis Drake or
Items Morgan for example. although only the experienced
should apply.
Your business in the West Indies has failed and You
decide to sign up on a ship and seek alternative fortune. The
skill level you choose determines how well y our future crews
wikbehave but also how big your share of the plunder will
be. You-also get the chance to specialise in one particular
skill such as fencing. navieation, gunnery. wit and charm or
medicine. Fencing is strongly recommended for beginners.
Your ﬁrst trip as a crew member goes well and the crew
suggest getting rid ()I' the old captain and elevating you. The
dispute is settled in the time honoured way - a duel. You

win, and it's not too difﬁcult. anti .
your ﬁrst ship.
The real game starts off in a friendly port. Here you can
pick up the latest gossip, sell your plunder. recruit new crew
and visit the Governor. He will give you a quick run down
on the main political news. i.e. who you are at war with and
will invite you to go out and sink a few of the enemy's ships.
The tavern is a source of more speciﬁc gossip, e.g, which
towns have been hit by  disease, where the latest silver
deposits have been found and so on. These nuggets of
information inﬂuence your strategy as You decide which
areas to explore.
After gleaning all the information you can. you will want
to sign up a crew and set sail as quickly as possible. Although
on are provided with a map of the Spanish Main, you must
still learn the principles of navigation. Each type of ship
haat es differently

Get it wrong and you may run out of supplies and end up
with a mutinous crew.
Sooner or later. sour lookout will report a sail on the
horizon. All you know is whose waters you are in. so you will
probably want to go in closer and investigate. Chances are
that she will be Spanish (assuming of course that o  u are
playing a Brit). She may also be a prate ship. Dutch or
French.
Eager for some action, you decide to close for battle. The
two ships are displayed on the battle screen together with

iheir relative strengths. You have three basic choices in
[-Jure. You can try and sink the enemy yOU can try and ram
Iij ;y it h the intention of boarding her or y ou can run away.
I he battle develops into a cat and mouse struggle as each
s h
and lowering sails, getting square on, in order to lire a
broadside or getting close enough to board. What ship you
have is important here. A galleon may offer you a lot of
protection but you will ﬁnd that other lighter ships will be
able to run rings round you.
Obviously, if you sink a ship, you don't get too much
chance to do some plundering so the trick is to damage her
o much that she surrenders when you sail close. Failing
that. you will have to board her. A good captain always
leads from the front and you must engage the enemy captain
in a sword ﬁght. How well you do reﬂects on the morale of
the crew so it is important to hone your fencing skills.
You have a choice of three weapons - rapier. long sword
and cutlass. The cutlass does most damage but you do have
to be close to your opponent. whereas with the rapier. you
can keep your man at long range but have to hit him an
awful lot of times. Attacking moves include thrusting and
slashing at high. mid and low levels. The slash does more
damage if it connects but gives 'our  opponent a lot more
time to counter. If you win, the enemy captain goes down on
his knees and surrenders his ship to you and ofcourse, being
a gentleman, you accept. Far be it from me to tell tales but
the editor of this journal, cad that he is did insist on hitting
the enemy when they were on their knees begging for mercy.
As well as plundering a capture ship. you have the
choices o f  sinking her or  taking her along with y ou.
Obviously, the latter action is better as you can increase your
effective hold capacity and later sell the ship but make sure
that You have enough crew to man both vessels.
Ships are not your only target - you can attack towns as
ell. This involves sailing your ship close enough to the
tow n's fort before the enemy blows you out of the water.
Your men can then land and you get to ﬁght the Governor.
Alternatively. y  011 can attack a  town by  land. This
• nvoly es a completely different set of tactics. You have two
or three groups of men to control as they attempt to make
hest use o f  the mailable terrain as you lure the city's
defenders into battle.
Naturally. you will want to capitalise on your newfound
•,yealth, but remember that the crew want their share too.
Sail into a friendly port. sell your goods and divide the

plunder. This will mark the end of a particular voyage and
your crew w ill amomatically disband. T o  keep y
reputation high, it is important to have a lot of gold to give
Out so use this option sparingly.
Depending on your successes, you get promoted by the
various governors. Elevation in rank and a few acres of land
all help add to your wealth and make for a happy retirement.
You also get the chalice to chat up the Governors' daughters
with a view to ﬁnding yourself a wife.
Other quests meander through the game. Your sister
usually manages to get herself kidnapped and you have to
ﬁnd the man who did it and duel for maps leading to her
whereabouts. There are also treasure maps to be bought and
more ill-gotten gains to be found.
Not every cruise ends in success though. You may lose a
battle and be imprisoned for as long as it takes for someone
to decide that you are worth paving a ransom for. Lose a
ship through carelessness and you will be stranded on some
uncharted island until a friendly ship happens to pass by.
Eventually the passage of time and the old war wounds take
their toll and you are forced to retire. At this point, your
rating is worked Out based on treasure, land and titles
accumulated over the years.
The best thing about Pirates is that even though it is a •
game on a huge scale, it is very easy to get into -  unlike
certain other simulations. There is no need to h avi a re or all
the political implications at the beginning of the game

although you will want to later on in order to maximise your
proﬁts. The game is simplicity itself to control and there are
some n ic e  graphics i n  t h e  non-s ailing scenarios.
Documentation in  -the for m o f  a ninety page book is
excellent. My only reservation is that I am not sure how well
the cassette y ersion of the game will play as disk access is
frequent.
Pirates is a superb simulation. It is difﬁcult to think of
anything else that could have been included, Deceptively-
simple. it is only when Vou play for an extended period that
you begin to recognise the subtlety of the tactics involved.

are a  number o f packages around
which are aimed at making adventure
writing easier. The best known are
Quill and Graphic Adventure Creator.
With these, all you need to do is think
up the plot and the rest is done for you.
The main drawback w i th  these
products however, i s  th a t th e
adventures written with them tend to
have a  similar feel and you are
constrained b y  t h e  imposed
limitations of each package.
In essence an adventure is a data
base which is accessed during the
game. The tedious part is the need for
efﬁcient and rapid access of the data
held in it. This apsect will be tackled
by this kit. This will leave you more
time to work on the ﬂow of the game
and the addition of embellishments
The k i t  comprises o f  s i x
modules:
I. A location/exit module which
allows t h e  handling o f  th e
geography of the adventure.
2. A te xt module which handles
messages, location descriptions.
etc.
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
Adventure
Kit
Want to write a gripping adventure? This series will
provide a kit of machine code routines which will
simplify the procedure and enable you to develop an
individual style. We start off with the location/exit
'nodule.
3. An object module which eases such
actions as taking, dropping, eating,
drinking objects, looking and
in
4. A parser allowing the input o f
commands and the checking o f
words against a vocabulary.
5. A window module allowing the
manipulation of screen windows so
that you can erase or scroll different
text areas.
6. An interrupt module which will
build in a real time element into the
game.
Naturally you don't get something
for nothing. The machine code will
steal about 8K leaving you about 30K
for BASIC . T h e  routines w i l l .
however, give you instant access to
20K of memory for the game database.
Each module will be accompanied
with an editor allowing you to set up
the data base. However. I'l l  g o
through the setting up of an editor in
sufﬁcient detail to allow you to write
your own.
Location Exit module
All adventures need some way o f
giving you the power to move about.
This is done by using locations. Each
location may be considered to be a
room or cell linked to its neighbours
by routes. It is necessary to specify two
sets of data:
a) which exits each location has;
b) where each location leads to.
This month I will deal with the ﬁrst
set of data and cover the second set at a
later date.
Ten possible exits are available for
any given location. These are the eight
basic compass directions and up and
down. These are described in two bytes
for each location. The ﬁrst byte has a
bit allocated f o r  each compass
bearing.
North occupies bit 0, north-east
occupies b i t I  and so  on. This
information is held in a table of 256
bytes residing between 37632 and
37887 ($9300-$93FF). Location 0 uses
the ﬁrst byte in the table (37632) and
location 255 uses the last ,byte (37887).
Up and down use the ﬁrst two bits of

• of
bytes stored in a table from 37888 to
38143 (S9400-894FF). This works in
the same way as the other table.
The destination dat a occupies
rather more memory. Each location
has ten bytes reserved for  it. These
hold the number o f  the location
reached when moving in any of the ten
possible directions. I f  no such route
exists, the byte value will be zero by
default (more on that later). The table
starts at $9500 (38144) and occupies as
much memory as  required b y  the
number o f  locations used. I f  a full
complement of 256 locations is used,
the table will end at $9F00 (40704).
Location 0  uses the ﬁrst ten bytes,
location I. the next ten and so On.
The code in this module uses these
tables to provide four functions. This
routine prints the exits in any given
location on the screen. The syntax of
the command is:
SYS 36864. 1.0CNO, PRINITYPE,X,Y
LOCNO is the location number.
PRINTTYPE speciﬁes the form of the
display. Type 0 prints the exits across
the screen using commas to separate
them.
Type 1 prints the exits in a column in a
form suitable for use in a window.
X is the horizontal position of the top
left corner of the output. It is ignored
by type 0 output.
Y is the vertical position of the output.
EXITCHK
This checks whether an exit exists. if
there is not an exit, location 900 will
contain a zero. If the exit does exist, it
will contain 255. Its syntax is:
SYS 36867,LOCNO,DIRECTION
LOCNO is as before
DIRECTION speciﬁes the direction
you want to move:
0...North
I...North-east
2...East
3...South-east
4...South
5...South-west
6...West
7..,North-west
8...Up
9...Down
An example of its use would be:
1000 SYS 36867,I,N,DI
1010 IF PEEK(900)=0 THEN PRINT
"YOU CAN'T GO T HAT  WAY"
CHANGE
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
This allows you to create or remove an
exit during the game. Its syntax is:
SYS 36870,LOCNO.DIRECTION,
ACTION
LOCNO and DIRECTIO N are as
before.
ACTION speciﬁes what will happen.
A value of() closes the exit and a value
of I creates an exit. An example of its
use is:
2000 SYS 36870,3,2,1: PRINT  " A
ROCK FALL SEALS THE
PASSAGE TEST"
CHKDEST
This command checks the destination
reached i f  you were t o  move in a
speciﬁed direction. The number of the
destination is held in location 901. The
syntax of the command is:
SYS 36873,LOCNO.DIRECTION
The routine does not check whether an
exit exists, y ou must d o that. The
following code fragment assumes that
your current location is in LO  and
attempts to MO VE you in direction
DI:
100 SYS 36867,LN,DI
110 I F  PEEK( 9 0 0 ) =2 5 5 T H EN
PRINT " YO U  C AN 'T  G O  T H AT
WAY": RETURN
R ETU RN
120 SYS 36873,LO,DE LO =PEEK
(901): RETURN
The code is  provided as a normal
BASIC loader but you will no doubt
wish t o  save it as object code. For
those o f  y ou w it h  machine code
monitors, save the block from $9000 to
$92D2. The editor includes a small
saving routine which can be used for
the job. What you do is:
I) RUN the editor and select the
SAVE option.
2) When prompted for the ﬁle name,
break out of the editor with RUN
STOP/RESTORE.
3) Give the command:
SYS 870 ﬁlename,8,2,36864,37586
if you are a disk user or
SYS 870 ﬁlename,1,2,36864,37586
for cassette.
The resulting code can be loaded
directly by:
LO AD ﬁlename.8.1 o r  L O A D
ﬁlename, I , I
The editor is  menu driven and
therefore self-explanatory. A  f e w
points should, however, be made,

The initialise tables option ﬁlls the
data tables with zero bytes. Since the
destination table is o f  variable size,
you must specify the highest location
to be used. This value is used to decide
how much memory must be saved
Later. The program does not save the
number o f  locations, Y o u  m u s t
remember i t  s inc e y o u  w i l l  b e
prompted for its value when you use
the LO AD option.
The display location option lists
the destination and exit entries for the
speciﬁed location. The set up option
allows you to specify the exits and
destinations. You should set up the
exits ﬁrst. The destination portion will
then ask you to specify the destination
for each available exit.
If you plan to create an exit during
the game, use the editor to create the
exit and the destination and then use
the editor  t o  close the exit. T he
destination entry will be retained for
when you need it.
The thing to remember is that you
should p la n  everything o n  paper
before using the editor. Changing
databases once you've started work
may not always be possible. The ﬁnal
code fragment pulls  three o f  the
commands together i n  a  s imple
routine for moving about.

TIMA I
nvone who has ever played the excellent Ultima III or
even bigger and better Ultima IV will have wondered how it
all started. Playing these games is like watching a ﬁlm that's
already halfway through but now you can ﬁnd out how it all
began in this re-released version of the prequel, Ultima I,
There was once a land called Sosaria that prospered
under the rule of Lord British. Unfortunately, there was also
an evil Wizard called Mondain who grew in power until he
e%entually invaded the land with an army o f  hideous

monsters that quickly crushed all resistance. Sosaria now
desperately needs a hero to challenge the Wizard and free
the land.
If you haven't already guessed you're the hero and you
have to complete this quest on your own. As the game begins
you can deﬁne your character by assigning an extra 30
points to the existing values (ten) that decide your strength,
agility, stamina, charisma, wisdom and intelligence before
choosing whether to be a human, elf, dwarf or bobbit and if
you're a ﬁghter, thief, wizard or cleric. Once you've decided
who and what you are, you head for the great outdoors and a
familiar Ultima wilderness screen littered with towns, castles
and dungeons. Enter one of these and the screen will change
to show the rooms of the building.
R E V I E W S
I f  you hate shooting aliens and feel that
you need something more intellectual to
stimulate your grey matter then look over
this selection of games.
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987

Inside towns and castles you can buy food and drink to
keep you alive, a room to sleep oft injury and exhaustion and
shops to buy equipment and weapons to prolong your quest.
As in the subsequent Ultima games you move around,
ﬁght and cast spells by pressing single key commands that
are detailed on a quick reference guide. This is supplied in the
display game box with the disk, booklet o f  spells and
monsters, colour maps of the realm and a small bag of coins.
Ultima I  has been rewritten and speeded up for this
relaunch and is a must for Ultima adventurers, You may
ﬁnd it a little easy after III and IV but it's still a challenging
quest that will lead you to the stars (I'm not saying anymore,
you'll have to ﬁnd out the rest yourself). Coming soon
Ultima II and then V!

there is a fair chance that most of them will materialise in the
Dungeon. Hidden somewhere beneath the City of Xebec's
Demise you ﬁnd yourself in the middle of a bitter conﬂict
with evil proliferating around you. Can you survive long
enough to discover how you can turn this discord to your
advantage?
The Dungeon is  the second scenario in  Datasoft's
Alternate Reality series. It follows on from the City but you
do not need to own this game in order to play. The story is
that you have been kidnapped by an alien spacecraft. You
ﬁnd yourself in a room with only one exit which leads into an
alternate reality.
As you leave the room, a panel o f  quickly rotating
numbers freeze and your character statistics are generated.

recommended: You will not have time to judge any of the
other statistics. There are several other characteristics being
monitored that you are not told about but must discover as
you go. Moral alignment and weapon proﬁciency would
seem to be included.
As you start out, you ﬁnd yourself by a shop and
should take the opportunity to equip Your character as best
as your few silver pieces will allow with weapons. provisions
and clothes. You can haggle for better prices but don't make
too low an offer or you will be thrown out on your ear. A
club is a useful ﬁrst weapon.
As you wander down the corridors and explore rooms, it
will n o t  b e  long before y ou encounter someone o r
something. What happens next depends on who surprised
who. You can try to transact with the creature, attack it or
run away. Each of these options leads into a further menu of
choices. For example. if you choose transact, then you can
offer something such as treasure. talk your way out of a
light, trick your opponent or  just try to engage him in
normal conversation,
The 'typical encounters' range include paupers, healers
thieves. mages, trolls and goblins (who are at war), the
undead. dragons and devils. Remember that if you make a
friend somewhere, the chances are that you have made an

Doors lead off in all directions. Most open easily but
some require brute strength, a key or the ability to break an
enchantment before they yield. Just because you can't see
them doesn't mean that they are not there. There are
hundreds of secret doors and you will just have to keep
walking into walls in order to ﬁnd out where they
you could use magic.
Magic comes in many guises. If you join a guild (if you
can ﬁnd one in the ﬁrst place) you can learn the art of spell
casting, for a hefty fee of course. Treasure gleaned from
vanquished opponents often contains magical items.
Potions. wands. tomes, scrolls, trump cards. magic eyes and
horns all feature prominently.
Of course, not all treasure is good treasure. Quite a bit of
it is cursed, and in which ease you will need to repair your
guild i n  or der  t o  hav e t h e  curse removed. O ther
occupational hazards include catching diseases, being
poisoned. getting hungry, thirsty or tired or suffering from
extremes of temperature.

Although survival is your initial aim, as you progress,
you ﬁnd that there are various quests that y ou c an
undertake. A prisoner wants rescuing, a golden apple needs
delivering and you need to ﬁnd two halves of' a ring, forge
them together and then destroy the ring in the ﬁres of the
oracle.
The dungeon is displayed in 3-D with large illustrations
representing special areas such as shops. guilds, the oracle
and so on. In size, the Dungeon is a third bigger than the
City. Spread over four levels, level one is on a 6404 grid
with successive levels each being a quarter of the size of the
one above, This means that accurate mapping is essential. A
starter map is  included and i t  is  suggested that y ou
photocopy this. Certainly, you will make many mistakes. I
found whole areas that I just could not match up and it was
not a case of being only one square out either. Teleports. one
way doors and mazes only add to your problems.
The game is immensely playable, although expect to kill
off a few characters until you get your bearings. One of the
complaints levelled against t h e  c it y  w as  t h a t  dis k
management was very poor and this is something that has -
now been sorted out. My  one grumble is that the save
routine is a little clumsy. After saving, it would be nice to be
able to resume straight away rather than having to reload
the character, but I can live with that.
•Fhe description above has only touched on a few of the
features of the game. The Dungeon oozes atmosphere and as
such, must be one of the best role-playing games on the
market today. I f  the next ﬁve modules in the series are
anywhere near as good, then fans of this type of game have a
treat in store.

of three of PSS's best known games on one compilation
tape. The games are about as different in subject matter as it
is possible to get - an air battle, an assault on an island and
the defence of an entire continent.
Battle of Britain takes you back to 1940 as you try to pit
the limited resources of the RAF against the might of the
Hitler's Luftwaffe, The game can be played on three levels
ranging from a training game to a fully blown thirty day
campaign.
The display is a map of southern England and you are
responsible f o r  scrambling squadrons o f  Spitﬁres and
!hurricanes to counteract the threats of the German ﬁghters
and bombers. Not every squadron is available to you as
weather conditions play an important part of the game -
airﬁelds may be fogbound. The problem is to get a squadron
into the air, put it on a course where you think it will
intercept the enemy and then after it has attacked, direct it to

for one squadron but becomes a nightmare when you have
eighteen to control, all in real time. There is an optional
arcade sequence in which you sit in a Spitﬁre cockpit trying
to shoot marauding Messerschmidts.
Theatre Europe was the game that brought fame and
notoriety to PSS. Set in the near future, it simulates an attack
by the Eastern block against the combined forces of Nato.
The controversy was caused by the fact that you have a
nuclear strike capability, either limited or full scale. There
were howls of protest from the anti-nuclear brigade and the
people w h o  thought t h a t  a l l  wargames encouraged
bellicosity and ought to be banned. As is usual in these cases,
everyone missed the point entirely.
Whichever side you play. it soon becomes apparent that
using the nuclear option is a losing one, in so much that both
sides escalate everything it becomes goodbye world as we
know it. That said, there is still enough in this game to keep
you thinking. You must keep your troops supplied, use your
airborne forces to their best advantage and decide whether
to use chemical weapons. All this on top of 
a
 ground
battle o n a massive scale. There are seven different air
missions that you can ﬂy ranging from reconnaissance to
attacking enemy supply units.
Falklands 82 has ﬁve different levels of play. You must
decide where on the island you are going to land your forces
and then you only have a limited amount of time in which to
clear the island of Argentinian forces. Wise use of your SAS
and SBS forces for reconnoitring purposes should help you
here.
Each unit has attack and defence factors, a movement
allowance and attacking range. F or  example, a battery
cannot move very far each turn but can attack from long
range, whereas the Paras have to be next to their opponents
before committing themselves to battle. After an attack, you
may well, depending on conditions, be able to summon up
an airstrike or request naval gunﬁre to help you. Time is
limited, especially on the harder levels and the task o f
liberating all the settlements is no easy one, especially as you
don't know the disposal of the enemy forces.
All three games are very well presented and easy to
control, being by and large menu driven. Whereas they lack
the complexity of some fully blown wargames. they more
than make up for it by being very easy to get into and
retaining a high degree of playability. As such, they are
highly recommended to beginners and newcomers of this
fascinating art.

get something called an 'examine'.
I can't see any adventurer being disappointed, especially
if they enjoyed Planetfall. The packaging, which includes a

instruction dockets, just helps to create the atmosphere of

Say we want to play the note C-3. A
glance at the table reveals that the high
value frequency is an 8, and the low
value frequency is a 97. So, in order to
play that note the ﬁnal line of our
program becomes:

The second installment of our music series continues
coverage of the 64's sound chip, SID, and explains how
to play tunes on your Commodore.
By Peter Gerrard
Obviously, t h e  V-1-0 could b e
abbreviated to just V if you wanted.
To play any other note, just alter the
low and high value frequencies in line
30 (values between 0 and 255). To alter
the waveform, alter the number in line
25 (remembering to  alter the pulse
width as well i f you select a pulse
waveform), choosing between 17, 33,
65 and 129. T o  alter the ADSR
settings, ﬁddle with the values in line
20 (values between 0 and 255), and to
alter the volume ju change the value
in line 15 (values between 0 and 15
only, please, for now).
When you're satisﬁed with creating
a few simple noises or notes, we'll
travel onwards and take a look at
producing some harmonies, using all
three voices.
In Harmony
Producing notes with all three voices is
not that much more difﬁcult than
producing notes with one. Having
gone through the effort in the last
section of setting up a simple note, let
us now take a look at some simple
ground rules when operating with all
three voices.

This, unfortunately, has to be the same
for all three voices, and if the control
register is set at 15 then all three will be
pumping out their notes at maximum
volume. However, by using different
waveforms and playing notes from
different octaves, one can create the
effect o f  different volumes for  the
different voices. A  low  note played
using a triangle waveform will sound
much quieter than a high note played
using a  sawtooth waveform. f o r
example.
ADSR
These can be different for the three
voices, and it is usually a good idea to
make. use o f  this fact when playing
notes in harmony. Harmonic effects
are probably heard to their best effect
when notes  a r e  sustained f o r  a
reasonable length o f  time. rather as
one would expect on an organ, and so
in our program to follow we'll be doing
precisely that. Attack and decay rates.
however. are probably best left up to
the requirements o f  the individual
voices.
Remembering t h a t  m u s ic a l
notation refers to notes as C, D. E. F,
G, A. B and then back to C again, one
octave further up, of course!
To produce a simple chord of  C
then, we'll take the following high and
low value frequencies:
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
number by 2 than it is multiplying two
numbers and trying to extrapolate a
result from that!
So, having got the values, let's take
a look at our program, bearing in mind
that we're going to be using all three
voices, and that the control registers
that look  after each voice come in
blocks of seven, That is, if we use our
variable V=54272, we'll see that the
waveform for voice one is controlled
by register ( V+4) , for voice two by
(V+4+7 or V+11).
Waveforms
Once more we can make use of the
facilities available with the SID chip
and use different waveforms for each
of the voices. However, the white noise
waveform is not going to he an awful
lot o f  use i f  we're going t o  b e
attempting t o  produc e intr ic ate,
pleasant sounding harmonies, so for
the purpose of this exercise we'll stick
to just triangle, sawtooth or pulse.
Note Values
Fortunately all of these are worked out
for you in the Commodore 64 manual.
and as well as giving you the high value
and low  value frequencies for  each
note over some seven octaves, they
also give you the value of the note in
cycles per second. This is related to the
frequency values in  quite a  simple
fashion, but it can be of more use to us,
especially when lengthy tunes or more
Note
Low Value
High Value
Frequency
From that you can probably work out
the relationship between frequency
and high and low values. Multiply the
high value b y  256 (now therc's an
unfamiliar nuinberl)and add the result
to the low value. This gives us the
frequency value. So why are frequency
values easier to work with? Well, if we
wanted to play our chord in a higher
octave, say the next octave up the
scale, w e  w o u l d  m u l t i p l y  t h e
frequencies b y  2 :  t h i s  i s  t h e
relationship between notes in different
octaves. To go up another octave then,
we'd multiply  the frequency b y  2
again. It's a lot easier multiplying one
advanced programming methods are
encountered.
When playing in harmony, it  is
probably bes t t o  s tic k  t o  s ome
straightforward rules. O ne doesn't
have to be a Mozart to realise that C
and C  Sh a r p  w h e n  play ed i n
conjunction with D  are not going to
sound very harmonious. Consequently,
in these early
with playing some very simple chords.
Simple, but they do produce a very
pleasing result. We'll start with a very
straightforward chord, played in the
key of C, and using the notes of C, E
and G  for our three voices, and for
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
69
voice three by (V+4+7+7 or V+18).
This enables us to set up a simple FOR
NEXT loop to look after all three
voices.
The Program
As before, we'll ﬂush out the entire
SID chip contents ﬁrst before we start
by setting the variable V and turning
the volume on.
5 FOR 1=0 TO 24:POKE 54272+1,0:
NEXT
10 V=54272
15 POKE V+24,15
So far so good, and exactly the same as
before. N o w  let's  s et t h e  AD SR
sequences up for the three voices.
20 POKE V+5,9:POKE V+6,240
21 POKE V+12,9:POKE V+13,240
22 POKE V+ I9,33:POKE V+20,36
There is no great signiﬁcance to any of
those values, other than that we have
used quite a long sustain and release
for eac h o n e  N o w  t o  s et t h e
waveforms.
25 FO R 1=0 T O  2:POKE V+I*7+
0:NEXT I
26 P O K E  V+4 . 1 7 : PO KE V + 1 1
33:POKE V+18. 65
27 POKE V+I6,0:POKE V+17,255
The only difference now is that we're
using different waveforms for all three,
and that voice three is using the pulse
waveform. Finally, we need to play the
actual notes, like this:
30 POKE V+0,24:POKE V+1,2
31 POKE V+7,163:POKE V+8,2
32 POKF V+14,35:POKE V+15,3
The result is  hopefully a  pleasant
sounding chord.
From here it is but a simple matter
to play different chords in different
keys. All you'll need to do is to look up
the high and low values frequencies in
the manual, and remember that chords
tend to go in jumps of two notes at a
time. That is, something like C, E, Gas
we've played here, or D, F, A for a
chord of D. or G, B, D for a chord in
G, and so on. You are welcome, of
course, to experiment with discordant

chords, if you can have such a thing,
but remember that you might get on
very well with your neighbours at the
moment a n d  t h a t  I  w o n ' t  b e
responsible for any untoward results,
Bearing in  mind the techniques
used here (and in particular the use of a
FOR N E X T  l o o p  a n d  t h e
relationship between the three voices)
it is but a simple step to go from notes
and chords to proper tunes. There are
many ways of extracting a tune from
your Commodore 64, and in the next
installment we'll take a look at some
of the easiest methods.
Playing Tunes
Using the material that we've covered
so far, there is really only one thing
further that you need to know in order
to be able to play some tunes on your
Commodore 64 —  the notes we're
going to play.
Later on we'll be using a modiﬁed
synthesiser program to do all this for
us, but for now we'll stick to some very
simple things that most people will
either k n o w  before ty ping i n  o r
recognise when played. Having got as
far as  us ing three voices w e w ill
continue to use them, and we may as
well stick to the waveforms and ADSR
envelope shapes that we've already set
up. So, our program begins like this:
5 FOR 1=0 TO 24:POKE 54272+1,0:
NEXT
10 V=54272.
15 POKE V+24,15
20 POKE V+5,9:POKE V+6,240

:NEXT I
26 PO KE V+4,17:POKE V+11, 33:
POKE V+I8,65
27POKE V+16,0 :POKE V+I7,255
So far so good and so far, familiar,
We won't yet carry on to include the
three lines from the last section that
actually played a chord, we'll consider
what notes we are going to play ﬁrst of
all.
A f a m i l i a r  enough t u n e  t o
everybody must be the 'theme' used in
Close Encounters of the Third Kind
when the aliens and humans ﬁnally
establish some sort of communication
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
and produce a welter of sound and
lighting effects that would do justice to
an Electric Light Orchestra concert.
The ﬁve all-important notes are D, E,
C from one octave, and from an octave
further down we have C and G. The
live notes are played in that order, and
since they also have more or less the
same duration, we can concentrate on
the notes for now and worry about the
duration afterwards.
It really is  about time to forget
about h ig h  v alue a n d  l o w  v alue
frequencies, and to turn permanently
to t r ue frequency values, o r  t h e
number of cycles per second for each
particular note. For the live notes in
our Close Encounters theme, t he
frequency values are as follows:
100 DAT A 1204,1351, 1432, 536,
803
101 D AT A -1
The -1 data element in line 101 will
serve to tell the program that we've run
out o f  data and are not going to be
playing any more notes, If we add the
following lines to our main program,
we'll be able to produce a simple tune:
30 READ F:IF F=-1 THEN FOR
1=0 TO 24TOKE V-FLONEXT
LEND
31 F11=INT(F/256):FL=F-FH*256
32 FOR 1=0 TO 2
33 POKE V+I*7,FL:POKE
V+I*7+1,FEI
34 NEXT
40 GOTO 25
This, as you will soon realise, does
not produce a very sensible tune, and
we do need to introduce some form of
delay before going back to line 25 and
getting the next note, a line something
like line 35 would sufﬁce for now:
35 FOR 1+0 TO 1000:NEXT 1
A one second delay occurs between
notes. But wouldn't it be better if we
were to let the program produce the
delay for us, rather than just having a
one second delay all the time? Here's
just one way of doing that:
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
70
100 DAT A
1204.50,1351,50,1432,50,536,50,
803,100
and amending line 35 to read:
35 READ DE:FOR 1=1 TO
DE*20:NEXT I
This gives us much more control
over the duration of each of the notes,
but is still a long way from being really
satisfactory. We can only achieve this
through muc h tr ial and error, o r
removing the programming side o f
things altogether a n d  letting t h e
person running the program do the
job. I f  we had our original line 100
back again which is
100 DAT A 1204,1351 1432, 536, 803
we could insert yet another new line
35 to read:
35 GET A$:1F A$ <  >  " "THEN
35
In which case we would wait for the
person running the program to press
the space bar before proceeding on to
play the next note. However, this is still
using a l o t  o f  t h e  64's  mus ic al
capabilities, and in order to make each
voice play the note in a different key,
we would have to make something like
this:
31 FH=1NT(F/256):FL=E-FH*256
32 FOR 1=0 TO 2
33 POKE V
V+I*7+1,FH
34 NEXT I
into:
31 FOR 1=0 TO
2:F=F*2 t EFFI=INT(F/256):FL=F-
FH*256
32 REMark is now redundant
33 POKE V+I*7,FL:POKE
V+PK7+1,FTI
34 NEXT I

Each voice now plays its note in a
successively higher octave, the new
frequency value being determined by
the statement F =F *2 1 I in  line 31,
since this will give us the value Fon the
ﬁrst pass through the loop when I is
equal to zero. F*2 when 1 is equal to
one, and ﬁnally F*4 when I is equal to
two. Raising two to the power of I is a
useful shortstep t o  producing the
desired frequency.
But a l l  this  is  concerned w it h
producing s imple notes, albeit i n
different octaves. How might we go
about p r o d u c in g  a  t hr ee- par t
harmony, s t i l l  us ing o u r  Clos e
Encounters data and no more? For this
we have to try  and understand the
relationship between individual notes,
since we do not want to spend the rest
of our days working out vast numbers
of different frequency values.
Note to Note
We've already noticed that octaves are
separated by a frequency value of two.
That is, C in one octave has half the
frequency of C in the next octave, a
quarter that of C in the next octave
again, and so on. Unfortunately for us
there isn't a  convenient number o f
notes from one C to the next, since
there is only a gap of six notes between
Cs, or  seven notes (including the C
itself) in total.
A s im p le .  b u t  n o t  ent ir ely
satisfactory solution, would b e  t o
divide t he difference between t w o
octaves into sevenths, and use these
values for our chords of D. E, C, C
again and G for the Close Encounter
theme, Alas (as you'll discover if you
try it  out) this does not work out
exactly. Those little black notes have a
habit of getting in the way.
Fortunately there is a mathemat-
ical expression f o r  getting t h e
frequency of the next note up the scale.
provided you know the frequency of
the proceeding note, and it works like
this. Assume that F is the frequency of
the note, not yet converted into high
and low  values t o be PO KEd into
memory. Then, if we assign this to, say.
C. then the frequency of the note D in
the same octave is  found b y  the
expression:
FN=INT(F*2 t (1/6))
A mite complicated, but it  does
work! For example, the frequency of a
particular C in a particular octave is
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
given a s  1072 cycles per  second.
Applying this to our formular above
gives us the new frequency of' 1203.
Not exactly the value given in  the
manual (whic h is  1204) but close
enough, and those in the manual are
never meant t o  be taken as gospel
anyway.
So once more unto the breach, and
instead of spreading our three voices
over different octaves, we'll now get
them p l a y i n g  i n  h a r m o n y  b y
introducing the following changes to
the program:
31 FOR 1=0 TO 2:IF 1=0 THEN
F H = I N T ( 1
FH*256:GOT033
32 F=INT(F*2 t (21(121(1*2+1))))
33 POKE V+1*7,FL:POKE
V+I*7+ LEH
34 NEXT I
Now doesn't that look wronderfully
complicated? It's quite simple, really,
don't panic! On the ﬁrst pass through
the loop nothing untoward happens,
because we just want the orignal value
of the frequency. Second time around.
remembering that a chord of  D will
consist of the notes D, F, A, we want to
be two notes higher up. In other words,
replace the original (1/6) by  (1/3),
which, believe it or not, is what all the
rigmarole above does. O n the ﬁnal
pass through the loop we want the
frequency of the note that is four notes
up from our original 13, but since we
cannot have (1/6) replaced by (I/1.5)
we have to do everything in fractions
of 12.
The main thing is that it works.
Also a few of the variations on a theme
that can be achieved by using just ﬁve
data times. By  playing in different
octaves, or by producing chords, we
begin to get some idea of the power
behind the 64. But this isn't of course,
the only method of playing tunes on
the machine, and so for the rest of this
particular section we'll be taking a
look at one or two other examples of
tune playing. After that, well, the light
relief is over and we turn to theory in
our attempts to get the most out of the
SID chip.
Tuning up
Here's the ﬁrst of just two different
methods of playing simple tunes on the
64 from data statements, without any
guidance at all, because you should be
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987

getting familiar with the registers and
their locations and functions by now.
Play w it h  them, embellish them,
because it is only by doing that that
you'll really begin to understand the
workings of Sit),

One way of doing things: you may
(I hope) spot the 'tune' being played,
which makes me sound lik e Lionel
Blair I  suppose, but that's the only
similarity between us, I assure you!
For our  ﬁnal example, here's a
slightly different way of achieving the
odd sound effect or two:
10 V=54272
20 POKE V+24,I5
30 POKE V+5,9:POKE

V+1,0:NEXT I
90 GOTO 30
95 FOR 1=0 TO 24:POKE
54272+1.0:NEXT

Press the RUN/STOP key to get
out of this one, and then enter GOTO
95 to shut everything up.
There a r e  m a n y  w e i r d  a n d
wonderful sound effects that can be
achieved by 'mucking' about with Just
the things that we've learnt about so
far. T r y  a l t e r i n g  t h e  v a r io u s
parameters i n  t h i s ,  a n d  o t h e r
programmes, t o  see what the effect
might be.
When w e start considering the
more advanced techniques available to
us on the 64, such as ﬁltering, ring
modulation, synchronisation, not only
will we be able to start producing ever-
more wonderful effects, but we will
also be on the path to producing a true
synthesiser, involving the simulation
of different musical instruments, and
much more besides. However, before
we c a n  t a l k  a b o u t  m u s i c a l
impersonation w e need t o  k now a
great deal more about how various
work, and in particular how different
instruments produce the sound that
they do.
Consequently, in the next section,
we'll be looking in  some detail at
ADSR envelopes, and how changing
them can produce a wide variety of
different and unusual sounds and how,
combined with a selection of different
waveforms and one o r  t w o  other
parameters. we can really start t o
realise the potential of the M  and its

Attack Decay Sustain Release
In order to enhance the quality of any
musical performances that we might
achieve by using the Commodore 64.a
thorough under s tanding o f  t h e
envelope shape o f  a voice, o r  the
ADSR setting is essential. The simple
deﬁnitions that we have already given
for the phrases Attack, Decay, Sustain
and Release w ill tell us  what they
mean, but will not explain precisely
how t h e y  operate. Cons ider t h e
following program:
10 V=54272
20 POKE V+24,I5
30 POKE V+4,0:POKE V+4,33
40 POKE V+5,9:POKE V+6,0
50 POKE V+1,10:POKE V.I0
This produces a note of a certain
frequency playing using the sawtooth
w a v e f o r m ,  a n d  h a v i n g  a n
Attac k /Dec ay  s e t t in g  o f  n i n e
combined w i t h  a  Sustain/Release
setting of zero. The note, as you will
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
hear, s oon dies away t o  nothing.
However, if we alter line 40 to read:
40 POKE V+5,33:POKE V+6,49
Now the note does not immediately
die away, and indeed sounds rather
different. A more substantial program
should illustrate h o w  t he various
settings of ADSR can be combined to
produce some very different effects.
Later on, we shall be looking at the
workings o f  the two registers that
control the entire envelope shape of
the note (for voice one only, they work
in exactly the same way' for voices two
and three).

A fairly straightforward program,
but it illustrates the point. After setting
up the variable V the program then
displays the current settings of Attack,
Decay. Sustain and Release on the
screen before waiting for the user to
press a  key. Pressing the ' A '  key
increases the attack setting. D  the
decay setting. S the sustain setting and
R the release setting. Finally, pressing
W changes the waveform, should you
choose to do so.
YOUR COMMODORE octobey 1987
72
The AD SR  settings are POKEd
into place in line 80, before line 85
takes care of the waveform (and sets a
low pulse frequency and a high pulse
frequency, if required), before the note
itself is at last played by line 90.
You might care t o  add t o  the
program, s o  t h a t  different puls e
frequencies c a n  b e  selected, o r
different notes played. The changes are
not too difﬁcult, and since we've taken
the precaution o f  having our  line
numbers increase i n  steps o f  ﬁve
there's plenty of room for additonal
statements to be inserted if required.
These will probably be along the lines
of I F  AS="something o r  other "
THEN increase some variable. Not
perhaps, the mos t elegant way  o f
programming, but it  will sufﬁce for
this simple example.
Now f o r  a  f e w  w o r d s  o f
explanation. Y o u ' l l  s ee t h a t  t h e
waveforms are set to values of 1, 2. 4 or
8. By multiplying this by 16 and adding
I we arrive at our more familiar values
of 17, 33, 65 and 129.
You w ill note that the various
ADSR settings never progress beyond
16. This is because the two control
registers that look after these settings
are obviously, dual purpose ones, and
operate in this fashion.
In each case, the ﬁrst four bits of
each byte are used t o  control one
setting, the second four looking after
the ot her  settings. T o  t a k e  t h e
Attack/Decay register for now, since
the Sustain/Release one work s  i n
exactly the same way, we will see that
the maximum value o f  the Decay
setting is actually 15, coming from the
addition o f  ( 8+4+2+1) . Six teen
possible settings then, force 0 through
to 15.
It might appear that the value of
the Attac k  c an v ar y  f r o m  0  t o
(128+64+32+16) or 240, covering such
values as 48, 160, etc., on the way.
Howev er , a d d i n g  a l l  t h o s e
combinations up gives us, yes, ﬁfteen
different settings, o r  sixteen i f  you
include zero option. How much easier
it is to think of settings ranging from 0
to 15 again (rather than 0 to 240 and
obscure points inbetween) and then
mutliply the end result by 16 to arrive
at the higher value. If you check all the

possibilities through, you'll soon see
that this much neater system works
very well.
It is important to understand this
principle, because we will be using it
again when we come to some of the
other multi-purpose (not just dual,
either!) registers in the sections on ring
modulation, synchronisation a n d
ﬁltering.
Just think in terms of bits and bytes
and our earlier discussion about how a
byte is made up on an 8-bit computer.
Having heard what the AD SR
settings do, you might be wondering
how t o  go about converting these
settings into passable impersonations
of musical instruments. Well, the
Commodore 64 manual gives us some
hints such as:
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
Instrument Impersonation
Instrument Waveform Attack/Dec
Piano P u l s e

Harpsichord Sawtooth

Accordian Triangle

Do these sound like the real thing,
if y ou use the values in our  little
program given earlier? About as much
as I sound like Frank Sinatra, which is
not alot, believe me. No, there is a lot
more to impersonating musical instru-
ments than just ﬁddling about with
ADSR settings, although they arc
obviously important.
As a starting point, though, they
will have to sufﬁce, and although we'll
be taking a few more steps in the next
couple of sections. try for now to think
about the sound produced by  the
YOUR COMMODORE October 1987

instruments mentioned abov e. A
piano, for instance, produces a very
sharp note, which is sustained for a
while, a n d  t h e n  us ually  decays
away q u it e  s lowly . H o w  w o u ld
you go about setting up the ADSR
envelope for something hke that?
Well, in all these cases it is alot
easier to visualise something than it is
to try and describe it. so the following
program should be of some help when
it comes to thinking up suitable ADSR
settings.

CONCORDE
The creators of 624, a superb combat
and ﬂight simulator based on one of
World War Irs most famous aircraft are
offering the once in a lifetime
opportunity for you to win a free trip
on Concorde, the world's most famous
airliner.
By answering the simple questions
below you could win a dream trip on
the world's only supersonic passenger
aircraft ﬂying at speeds faster than the
bullet from a gun.
CONCORDE... THE FACTS
•  Concorde ﬁrst ﬂew on 2 March, 1969.
•  Concorde has carried over 800,000
passengers over 50 million miles.
•  Concorde holds the record for the
fastest passenger ﬂight London to
New York in 2 hours 56 minutes on
1 January, 1963.
• Concorde's maximum level speed is
1,367 mph.
•  Concorde carries a maximum of 128
passengers.
HOW TO ENTER
To win a supersonic ﬂight on
Concorde answer the following
four questions and then in not
more than ﬁfteen words why
you want to ﬂy faster than the
speed of sound. In the event of

thrills of ﬂight plus the exhileration of
combat in 624.
B24
From the war torn skies of World War
II emerged one legendary offensive
weapon —the 624 bomber. This superb
simulation allows you to recreate the
exploits of this great aeroplane on
single mission runs or a 19 mission
campaign to destroy oil reﬁneries in
Poletsi, Rumania.
As pilot, you control the mission ﬂight
on a bombing raid from your home
base in Italy; as group leader you
command 40 B24's on bomb runs to 14
targets deciding on when and where
to bomb depending upon weather,
plan availability, group efﬁciency and
target oil production levels. A night
and combat simulation of unparalleled
quality.

of this versatile system. it is helpful to
know a  few basic facts about the
receiver. Firs tly , w h a t  receiver is
required? The market is  open here.
with models ranging in price from 4:24
to 4;600. Regrettably the lower priced
models w i l l  n o t  f u n c t io n  w i t h
interfaces/software o f  this ty pe as
certain basic criteria are required.
Your short-wave receiver should
cover the range 1./4 - 30 MHz  and it
must have a detector to receive SSI3
(single side band) plus a CW tiller for
picking up morse. To tune to an exact
frequency. a  receiver w it h  digital
display is much more accurate.
Price Range
Having said all this, how much do you
have to pay for such a model? Looking
around a second-hand market would
be informative as there is a constant
supply and demand. Our household
model is a YAESU FRG7000 which
costs ar ound £200, second-hand.
(Remember, that short-wave listening
is a hobby within itself which users get
a gr eat deal o f  i n  
a
n
d
pleasure from.)
An acceptable receiver will set you
hack a minimum of -):150 second-hand
and should have all the above features
including the facilities to use a good
aerial and earth: the receiver used here
was worked on a long wire antenna (4(1
metres). suitably grounded to reduce
background noise.
Onto Computing

compact. plugs into the user port of the
C64. and is connected to the audio
output o n  the short wave receiver
(cables and connectors are supplied).
It has a single switch which controls
three functions: one position sets the
computer for CW reception. another
for RTTY reception and the third for
litter on/off. According to the data
you wish t o  receive, set the switch
accordingly and load the disk RX-4
program.
While the program is not lengthy. it
is extremely compact and efﬁcient in
use. All of the commands function via
a single key press. a list of which is
given in  the literature supplied. On
loading, a status line is displayed at the
bottom of the screen. Press R and this
indicates t h a t  y o u  ar e i n  R T T Y
(teletype) mode: a C press takes you to
morse reception, a n  A  press t o
AMTOR reception and a T  press to
download S S T V  ( s l o w  s c r een
television scans). The AMTOR mode
will not be discussed here as it is very
similar to RITY.
Our main options are T.R. and C.
Inasmuch as morse transmissions were
received a n d  t r a n s la t e d  w i t h
considerable facility. let's get into the
C option ﬁrst.
To do this, set the interface switch
to C W then tune into the amateur
bands  a v a i l a b l e  f o r  m o r s e
transmission, using the CNA' option on
your receiver. These bands are listed in
most short-wave handbooks and the
more successful were found to be the
3.0 - 3,150 MHz and 14.0 - 14.350 MHz
bands. T h e  s oftware c ontr olling
reception has a ﬁlter selection of 700
YOUR COMMODORE ottober 1987
75
Hz. 1360 Hz plus a ﬁlter OFF mode:
these are displayed at the bottom of the
screen and are selected with single
computer keys. There are also single
key controls for setting word speed.
For amateur MOrSC. 20 w.p.m. or 40
w.p,m, should be used (depending on
the speed o f  transmission). A  speed
setting capable of handling up to 250
w.p.m. is also available.
Let us assume that You have tuned
into a good. clear morse transmission.
At the top left-hand corner of your
screen, nothing is visible until tuning is
perfect. a t  whic h point a  ﬂashing
yellow cursor w ill appear and the
morse transmission w i l l  n o w  b e
translated to text on your screen (in
English or the appropriate language -
such conversations are regarded as
conﬁdential and may not be printed
here). You will ﬁnd the transmitter's
call-sign pr int ed o u t .  ev entually
enabling y o u  t o  loc ate h is / h e r
geographical position (with reference
to handbook).
It s hould b e  remembered t h a t
many people us e mor s e i n  a n
abbreviated for m o r  even in  coded
form: furthermore y ou are jus t as
likely t o  c atc h t h e  e n d  o f  a
conversation as the beginning. In fact,
what you pick up is a matter of trial,
error and chance!! The transmission
may be 'locked' on autotrack if need
be.
During reception. when one screen
is full, it is overwritten by subsequent
data which allows fast decoding. All
material c an b e saved t o  disk b y
pressing S -
should be followed by a single number

or letter for program identiﬁcation -
the saving process then begins.
To output t o  the Commodore
printer or  MPS 801 press P  either
directly from the screen or from saved
material. The latter is reloaded with a
D press: when tol lowed by O. data will
again b e  v i s i b l e  o n  s c r e e n .
Approximately 32K may  be stored
which is more than adequate for most
transmissions. RESTORE w ill clear
the screen but not the memory, so if
vou have a  lot  o f  rubbish coming
through initially , due t o  excessive
background noise or inaccurate tuning
you will ﬁnd that this is saved as well
within any one program - generally as
Es, I ' s  and asterisks. Should y ou
search around bands other than the
amateur ones. y ou w ill ﬁnd that
information is transmitted in fast code.
The Teletype Selection
Switch the interface to RTTY.
ON mode and press R  for software
selection. At the bottom of the screen
you will ﬁnd the RTTY deﬁnition plus,
at the lower right-hand corner. two
R E V I E W
cursors for tuning purposes. When a
station is located, a vertical black band
will oscillate across the cursors to give
very tine tuning - you are well on mark
when the lines oscillate from left to
right a t  a  r apid rate. T his  w ill,
naturally vary with the intensity of the
signal.
Once you are tuned to a station
(handbook us eful)  t h e  telety pe
message is then printed to screen. Most
of the material I picked up was either
coded o r  i n  German o r  Swedish.
Experience is  needed here to know
when and where t o get the English
transmissions (uncoded).
Pressing T  will give a full screen
picture if any SSTV (slow scan TV) is
being transmitted.
To be Recommended
This is a very dedicated hobby which
requires a great deal of patience and
computer time. Certainly the product
marketed by Technical Software will
not l e t  y o u  d o w n .  Technically'
everything functions Yrery smoothly
and the single key presses, allow for
rapid switching from mode to mode.

examining the sprites used in games.
The sprites once found can be SAVEd
to disk or  tape, LOADed back into
some f o r m  o f  sprite editor  a n d
changed at will. In this way you can
build up a library of your favourite
sprites from your favourite programs.
Getting it in
Sprite Grabber is  a  machine code
program, presented here as two Basic
Loaders. These should be typed in
using t h e  S Y N T A X  C H E C K E R
program that can be found on the
LISTINGS page.
Why two versions of the program?
It's simply that they are both located at
different addresses, in case one hap-
pens to sit in the same area of memory
as the sprites you want to grab.
When the loaders have been RUN I
suggest that you SAVE the machine
code using a monitor or one of the
following small Basic programs:
For the version a t
10 POKE 43, 0: POKE 44, 192
20 POKE 45, 198: POKE 46,35
For the version at address 16384:
10 POKE 43. 0: POKE 44,64
20 POKE 45, 70: POKE 46, 64
Then SAVE the programs with:

Want to use sprites from other programmes in your own
games? This utility makes it easy for you to ‘
save them for later use.
By J. MacDonald
SAVE "SPRITE GRABBER", X, I
...where X is I if using tape or 8 if using
disk.
The programs should be LO ADed
back to the address from where they
were SAVEd to avoid corrupting any
sprite data that may sit in the Basic
area. You do this with the following
command:
LOAD "SPRITE GRABBER", X, I
...where X is as before.
Using the program
LOAD in the game with the sprites
that y o u  wis h t o  examine. Once
LOADed and RUNning reset the
computer using a reset switch, or a
cartridge with a reset on it. LOAD the
SPRITE G RABBER program into
memory at the address of your choice
(49152 or 16384) and run the program
with:
SYS start address
...where the start address is  either
49152 o r  16384 depending o n the
version o f  the program that y ou
choose to use.
A menu will now appear on the
screen showing what the function keys
do. ' R '  and 'S
information at the bottom.
The function keys will allow the
sprite pointer t o  b e  increased o r
decreased by one, sprite colours to be

multicolour and hi-res mode and
toggling the X Y  expansion o f  the
sprite. BANK switching is achieved by
pressing numeric keys 0-3 as shown on
the screen. A t  all times the sprite
pointer, BANK and sprite address is
displayed on the screen.
If you ﬁnd a series of sprites that
you like, which might be an animation,
like a man walking, use Fl to display
the ﬁrst sprite in the series, and then
press 'R' to save the start pointer. Now
use Fl to move the sprite pointer to the
last sprite you want to save and press
'R' again to indicate the end of the
series. Pressing 'S' will now activate
the SAVE section of the program. This
will prompt you for Tape or Disk —
press the appropriate letter and you
will b e  asked f o r  a  ﬁlename (16
characters max). Your series of sprites
will now be SAVEd.
If you try to SAVE from a high to a
low address you will be notiﬁed of an
error — press any key to try again.
Sprites c a n  b e  SAVEd  f r o m
anywhere in memory, including under
the ROMs. So remember, unless you
are loading the sprites from a program
which w ill redirect them t o  a new
address, they will LOAD into the area
they originally came from —  with
possibly unforeseen results.

The 64 KERNAL supports RS232 via the user port. This interface
provides the necessary voltage conversion for direct connection
to RS232 printers, modems and other devices. It is compatible
with Easyscript and Superscript. The unit is supplied with 1 metre
of cable (add 75p per extra metre') terminated in a 25-way male
(or female') D-connector. Th e  software includes a terminal
emulator whic h supports split baud rates and auto-dial, ﬁle
transfer utilities, a menu driven port initialisation program, and a
transparent printer driver which vectors the KERNAL to redirect
device 4 printer output to the RS232 port.

L
general p r in c ip a ls  o f  p a r a lle l
communications, the terminology, and
the method that I was going to use in
the series. Als o I  included as  a n
example, a simple memory transfer
program for the C64 and BBC micro.
This month l o o k  at a more
practical application of the system. If
there are two things that are different
in the C64 and BBC Micro it is speed,
and more speciﬁcally disk speed. The
BBC Micro has one of the fastest and
cheapest disk systems on any home
micro. T he Commodore 64 on the
other hand doesn't have disk drives at
all. Oh, they may look like disk drives.
But in reality there are little hamsters
inside that disk drive shaped box, that
listen to the information coming down
the serial bus and scratch it on the
surface of the disk in shorthand.
This breed of hamster is very rare
and w a s  b r e d  s pec iﬁc ally  b y
Commodore for the task. One of the
stranger things  about t h is  breed
(Hamstradus Floppus) is that they live
on the paper envelopes that disks
usually come in. I f  you don't believe
me, count the number of disks that
you've got, then count the number of
envelopes -  see! Further pr oof is
evident when you swap disks in the
middle of a 'read or write' operation.
The miniature hamsters hammer on
the roof of the box to get you to stop.
So with these two things in mind, it
should be possible to use the BBC
Micro as  • an intelligent disk drive
interface between the C64 and the
BBC Disk Drive, all you need is some
clever software and the appropriate
transmition protocol.
There is a small Basic program in
the C64 and the main program on the
BBC Mic ro. This is  for  two main
reasons. Firstly you can load 1K of
data into a BBC Micro and then port it
onto a C64 a lot taster problems that
C64 C O M M U N I C A T I O N S
Hook-Ups
Continuing our series, we look at the possibilities of
using the BBC as an intelligent disk drive interface
between the C64 and itself,
By Mycroft Appleby
you get with Basic getting confused
with machine code. The second reason
is that this series isn't designed to give
complete solutions to problems, but
rather t o  supply the tools and the
information to do the job. For this the
code must be in Assembler format
rather than strings of hex digits, so that
you can see how it works. Most C64
assemblers are incompatible with each
other and interfere with the system to
such a degree that once the assembler
has taken a chunk out of the memory
map and written all over the pointers
you haven't a clue where you are
So the program is in the standard
BBC format assembler. The C64 boot
program is only slightly different from
the one published last month, only
locations a n d  amounts have been
changed. Some of the code on the BBC
side may also be familiar, as I used
many o f  the principals which were
discussed last month.
Starting Up
To lo a d  t h e  software in t o  b o t h
machines, ﬁrst load -
Commodore 64 and load -
the BBC Micro. Run "Boot" and then
run "Dis k ". After about 35 seconds
the code will have assembled into the
BBC, been transferred to the C64 and
then the BBC side will have been re-
assembled and initialised for the BBC.
On the BBC screen at this point
you will see a message indicating the
buffer size and a number. This is the
number o f  bytes in the •butfer and
indicates the maximum program size
you can load or save plus 256 bytes for
the header  pac k et ( w h ic h I ' v e
explained later). D o not excede this.
To increase the buffer size, most of the
error checking has been removed.
On the C64 side you should have
returned t o  the -
YOUR COMMODORE oetober 1987
82
Typing ' SYS 49152' i n  t h e  t ime
honoured w a y  w i l l  initialis e t h e
System.
At this point the vectors inside the
machine that handle the loading and
saving will have been slightly altered.
Tape and disk ( if  appropriate) will
work as normal, as will all other device
addresses except '8'. This will transfer
your pr ogr am o n t o  t h e  BBC ' s
currently selected drive in the blink of
an eye. Likewise loading with a device
number of '8' will load from the disk
into memory as normal. Verifying is
not possible however, due t o  the
'burst' transmition of the data (i.e. the
data goes back and forth in one great
chunk and it is difﬁcult to compare it
on a 'byte for byte' basis).
Alterations
If y ou have a  dis k  driv e already
attached and want to use it also, then
you can change the device number of
the BBC very simply. In the sections
'.13LODE' and '.BSAV' in the C64 half
of the program you will see that the
memory location 'device' is compared
to '&08'. This is the device number.
Change this to whatever number you
want above three (the system's choice,
not mine) and you are there. A good
choice (and one I use myself) is seven
as not a great deal seems to use this
device number.
How it works
Remember how  last month in  the
header packet of the transmitted data,
as well as where to and how long, the
packet also had a byte called 'cmd'.
Well, this is the command byte. In this
new system when the data comes
ﬂooding into the BBC, it looks at this
byte and it' it is a one it knows to save
the data. The ﬁrst 256 bytes of the data
is s p e c ia l a n d  h o l d s  v ar ious

information about the data, including
the name it is to be saved under. This is
extracted and the data is saved.
If the cmd number is two, then that
is a load request. In this case only the
256 by te header packet i s  sent,
complete w ith various information
about the program, as well as its name
again. The CM then just sits there and
waits. In this program it doesn't return
to Basic, but you can have it so you get
full Basic control right away and the
program just appears in memory when
it's ready. This system works well but
needs a  lo t  o f  care t o  operate it;
'.1loop' is the area to watch. Change
the ﬁnishing off to operate in the IRO
loop and perform a manual relink and
you are away — parallel processing at
last.
However, back to the plot. When
the BBC has found the program on
disk, it prepares a packet with a cmd of
three and sends it to the CM. The C64
knows that three means 'incoming
program d a t a '  a n d  t r e a t s  i t
accordingly.
A cmd of zero will force a memory
dump in any direction, just follow the
instructions for  last month. this is
amusing f or  swapping screens and
messages, o r  changing somebodies
character set.
Protocols
The transfer packet looks like this:

hope this system is of some use, I
can't abide my  hamster drives any
more, the BBC drive is so much faster.

dream up.

when it is listed. only a single line will

computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programmes from Your Commodore
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R,
U and N . You press RETURN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programmes from each issue on both cassette and
disk at a price of E6.00 for disk and £4.00 for cassette. None of
the documentation for the programmes is supplied with the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INFONET L TD , 5  River Park Estate, Berkhamsted,
Herts HP4 1HL.
TEL: (0447) 7661/4.
Programmes on the disk will also be supplied as totally
working versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic
Loaders thus making use of the programmes much easier.
Unfortunately at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and
Plus/4 cassettes. However programmes for these machines
will be available on the disk.
What programmes are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programmes are available on which format you will also ﬁnd
a couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.

afford the time to type it in then our software service will help you out.

versions of the program, we do not put disk-only programmes

Tech Troubles
Dear Tim,
1 have a Commodore 128 and 1571
disk drive. After  what I'v e heard
recently, just how safe is it to use the
back o f  the dis k , especially w it h
programmes like Superbase?
Raymond North, Blackpool.
Hi Raymond,
The 1571 has certainly received its fair
share o f  criticism over the past few
months. In essence, the problem with
it, is that under certain circumstances,
ﬁles that use the second side of the disk
can become trashed. This trashing will
ONLY occur under the following
speciﬁc conditions:
Either one RELative ﬁle and one
SEQuential ﬁle is  open o r  three
SEQuential ﬁles are open. Of course,
one of those ﬁles must be on side two!
What happens t o  y our  newly
opened ﬁle on side two is basically this.
After 1000 o r  so bytes have been
written to the ﬁle, corruption of data
WILL occur. The resulting ﬁle will
contain only up to seven blocks ofdata
regardless of how much was written. If
you then CO LLECT  (validate) the
disk, the block count no longer adds
up to 1328.

THER". y o u  w i l l  s ee something
curious — the ﬁle is now only two
blocks long!
This pr oblem w i l l  oc c ur w it h
Superbase, and any other application
that has more than one ﬁle open at
once. Program loading and saving is
perfectly alright. as there is only one
ﬁle open. Keeping to side one is also
perfectly safe.
There are new ROMs on the way,
but they have been held up by the
release of the new I28D. Commodore
should be able to supply them 'real
soon now'(!), so if  in doubt, hassle
them. The cost is yet to be announced.
Dear Tim,
I own an old 4032 PET and 4040 disk
drive. I recently bought a Plus /4 and
1551 disk drive. My problem is this. If 1
save a program on the PET, I can load
it on the Plus/4, but it' I save it on the
Plus/4,1 can't load it back on the PET
Can you help me?
James McHenery, Aberdeen.
Hi James,
The reason for this is that the LOAD
command behaves slightly differently
on the PET compared with the later
Commodore computers. On the Plus
/4 (or CM, Cl28 etc), when you type
LOAD ",A NY PROG", 8 the program
is loaded into memory, starting at a
place known as the 'start o f  Basic'.
This i s  t h e  plac e w her e Bas ic
programmes are stored, and it varies
from mac hine t o  mac hine. F o r
instance, on the PET it is $0401, on the
64 it is $0801, the 128 is $IC° I, and on
the Plus/4 it is $1001.
Additionally, the 128 and Plus/4

if a high resolution graphics bitmap

The important thing to grasp is
that these computers will always load
to the start of Basic, no matter where it
is T h e  P E T  L O A D  command is
different, i n  that i t  loads  t o  t he
absolute address f r o m  whic h t h e

monitor by typing SYS 4, you can see
the program using the command M

relevant portion of memory.)
In fact, LO AD "ANYPROG"8 on
the P E T  is  exactly equivalent t o
LOAD " A N  YPROG",8, I o n  t h e

Dear Tim,
am moving to America in the near
future and I  have a Commodore 64,
and want to take it with me. Because
the voltages are different. I know I will
have to buy a new power pack, but is it
alright to plug the 64 into a TV?
Keith Harrison. Kidderminster.
Hi Keith,
The short answer to your question is
no. You are correct in saying that the
mains supply is different — here we
have 240 volts a t  5 0  Hz , and i n
America, they have 110 volts at Hz.
Thus if you try to plug your 64 in, it
will not work. However, a suitable
transformer could be bought out there.
The essential problem is one of TV
standards. Even if you could get the 64
to function, American TV sets simply
do not lik e the sort o f  signals that
British TV sets thrive on. I will explain.
In Europe (except France), we use
a TV standard known as PAL (Phase
Alternate Line). This sends a little dot
of' light across the screen 625 times,
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
101
each crossing slightly below the last,
until it  reaches the bottom. This is
known as scanning, and the little dot is
called a raster. Each complete scan of
the picture i s  completed i n  1 / 5 0
second. Thus, our T V sets receive 50
complete pic tur es  i n  a  s ec ond
(actually, that is a slight simpliﬁcation,
but it will do).
In America, (and Russia) they use a
system called NTSC (North American
Television Standards Committee, or
better known as Never Twice the Same
Colour — if you've ever seen American
sit-corns you'll know why!). This only
has 525 lines in each picture, and the
pictures are transmitted 60 times per
second. T h e r e  a r e  a l s o  o t h e r
differences t o  d o  w ith things lik e
phase, but that gets complicated.
Thus, your 64 puts out 625 line
PAL and your TV will want 525 line
NTSC, and ne'er the twain shall meet.
Of course it is possible to convert one
to the other, but on a conservative
estimate, a box to do that will cost
something over ten grand. Sell your 64
and buy another out there. It's cheaper
and much less hassle!

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA101 would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-1-21 means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC4] or, exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C31
This would be achieved by holding
Easy Entry C64
CIO
Listings
Get it right ﬁrst time with our deluxe program system
for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],{C*1
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine key
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987
102
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

in a column to the left of the listing
should n o t be typed i n  with the
program. These are merely checksum
values and are there to help you get
each line right. Don't worry i f you
don't understand the hexadecimal
system, as long as you can compare
two characters on the screen with the
corresponding two characters in the

immediately because i t will be used
with most of the present and future
listings appearing  i n  Y o u r
Commodore.
At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct it and
YOUR COMMODORE october 1987

press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49152 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i th  th e  same SYS
command.
No system is foolproof but the
chances of two errors cancelling one
another out are so remote that we
believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.
So get typing!

These programs have sold thousands of
copies, and yet you won't have seen them
in the charts -  why?
We produce programs that you can really
get y o u r te e th  in t o .  P ro g ra ms like
BUSICALC a nd BUSICALC 3  which
can be used at home or in the ofﬁce to do
all sorts of calculations, forecasts and
budgets.
Programs like MIKRO ASSEMBLER and
the ZOOM monitor which make it easy to
write machine code programs. Programs
like MUSIC MASTER wh ich  turn yo u r
computer into a musical instrument. And
programs like the BLITZ compiler which
makes ordinary BASIC programs ru n
much, much faster.
We have been writin g  programs f o r
Commodore computers since 1978 and
now have hundreds of programs for the
PET. VIC 20, CBM 64, CBM 128, even the
C16 a n d  Plus/4. S o  w h y  aren't o u r
programs in the charts?
Because our programs aren't one minute
wonders, here today and gone tomorrow.
Programs we released for the 64 in 1983
are still selling -  and even more impor-
tant, the people who bought them then
are still using them.

Software should be an investment, not
money down the drain. We believe that
the more you put into a program, the
more you should get out of it, and that's
the wa y it  wo rks with  software fro m
SUPERSOFT.
The programs listed on the right represent
a small selection from our range, but you
can get a full list if you phone or write to
