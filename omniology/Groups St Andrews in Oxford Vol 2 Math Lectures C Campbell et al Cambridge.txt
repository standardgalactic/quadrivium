INTRODUCTION
Groups St Andrews 2001 in Oxford was another highly successful conference in the
continuing series. The conference, held from 5 August 2001 to 18 August 2001,
was attended by 230 mathematicians from 35 countries. The lectures and talks
were given in the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. We thank
Lady Margaret Hall, St Anne’s College, The Queen’s College and Merton College
for providing accommodation. We also acknowledge with gratitude the ﬁnancial
support of the Edinburgh and London Mathematical Societies. The Mathematical
Institute of the University of Oxford generously made lecture rooms available, and
supported the conference in various other important ways.
The organizing committee consisted of C M Campbell (University of St Andrews),
D P Groves (Merton), R P Martineau (Wadham), P M Neumann (The Queen’s
College), E F Robertson (University of St Andrews), G C Smith (University of
Bath), W B Stewart (Exeter) and G A Stoy (LMH). Administrative support was
provided by Jan Campbell and Maureen White.
The main speakers, who were invited to give a series of talks, were Marston D
E Conder (Auckland), Persi Diaconis (Stanford), Peter P P´alfy (E¨otv¨os Lor´and,
Budapest), Marcus du Sautoy (Cambridge), and Michael R Vaughan-Lee (Oxford).
As has become the tradition, all these invited speakers have written substantial
articles for these Proceedings. All papers have been subjected to a formal refereeing
process comparable to that of a major international journal. Publishing constraints
have forced the editors to exclude some very worthwhile papers, and this is of course
a matter of regret.
The Theory of Groups continues to move forward on many fronts, and twenty
years on from the announcement of the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite simple groups,
it prospers perhaps surprisingly well (rather like Mark Twain). It is a measure of
the success of this conference series and this subject that mathematical libraries
around the world are collecting the series of St Andrews Conference Proceedings.
As LATEX has become the almost universal typesetting language for mathematics,
the nuts and bolts of the editorial job are perhaps getting a little easier.
We
hope that in future even more contributors will stick faithfully to the typesetting
standard prescribed by the editors (so that these hacks will have more time to do
research in group theory, lie on beaches and so on). Fran Burstall of the University
of Bath provided typesetting counselling. It is hoped that the next conference in
this series will be held in 2005 and will be Groups St Andrews in St Andrews
(revisiting the scene of the original crime), and it is also hoped that in 2009 we will
return once more to Bath.
As these proceedings go to press, news has just arrived that one of the grand-
fathers of the subject, B H Neumann, has died. He attended the ﬁrst Groups St
Andrews conference in 1981 and some later ones in the series. Many of our commu-
nity knew him with great aﬀection – his warm smile and shoestring tie will linger
in the memory almost as long as his important contributions to mathematics.

Introduction
In this article we survey recent results on the connection between decompositions of
complete graphs which admit given automorphism groups, and some combinatorial
problems related to these groups. Although these problems are of combinatorial
nature, group theorists may ﬁnd interest in these problems as well.
Most of the results surveyed here are found in [10], [11], [12] and [14] (we do not
give proofs in this article, and the interested reader is referred to the above papers).
Some of these results extend and generalize previous results on graph labeling (see
[5] for a survey) into results related to any ﬁnite groups, and some of the results
apply known results on group sequencings. Another result applies the Z∗-Theorem
of Glaubermann.
We begin with basic deﬁnitions. By Kn (respectively, K∗
n) we denote the com-
plete undirected (respectively, directed) graph on n vertices. (Each pair of diﬀerent
vertices in K∗
n is joined by two arcs (directed edges) with opposite directions.)
Deﬁnition 1.1 Let n be a natural number and let F be a directed (res., undi-
rected) graph on m vertices, where m ≤n. The problem of determining whether
or not the edge set of K∗
n (res., Kn) can be partitioned into arc (res., edge) disjoint
subgraphs isomorphic to F will be denoted by P ∗
n(F) (res., Pn(F)). If a solution to
this problem exists, we shall say that there exists a decomposition of K∗
n (res., Kn)
into arc (res., edge) disjoint subgraphs isomorphic to F, and we shall denote this
fact F | K∗
n (res., F | Kn). If m = n, i.e. each subgraph in the decomposition is a
spanning subgraph of K∗
n (res., Kn), we shall say that F | K∗
n (res., F | Kn) is a
factorization of K∗
n (res., Kn) into factors isomorphic to F. In this case (i.e., when
m = n) we shall write brieﬂy P ∗(F) (res., P(F)) instead of P ∗
n(F) (res., Pn(F)).
Notice that a decomposition problem can always be handled as a factorization
problem, by considering a corresponding factor with added isolated vertices.
Deﬁnition 1.2 Let F be a directed (res., undirected) graph on n vertices, and
let G be a permutation group on the vertices of K∗
n (Kn). We say that K∗
n (Kn)
admits a G-transitive factorization, into factors isomorphic to F, if there exists

296
KAPLAN, LEV, RODDITY
a factorization of K∗
n (Kn) such that G acts transitively on the factors in the
factorization.
If the action of G on these factors is regular, we shall say that
the factorization is G-regular.
The problem of determining whether or not K∗
n
(Kn) admits a G-regular factorization into factors isomorphic to F is denoted
by RP ∗(G; F) (RP(G; F)). The problem of determining whether or not K∗
n (Kn)
admits any regular factorization into factors isomorphic to F is denoted by RP ∗(F)
(RP(F)).
Notice that when F is a directed (undirected) factor of K∗
n (Kn) and RP ∗(G; F)
(RP(G; F)) has a solution, then the order of G must be n(n −1)/|E(F)| (res.,
1
2n(n −1)/|E(F)|), where E(F) denotes the arc (edge) set of F.
This article is organized as follows: In Section 2 we deal with the connection
between the problems RP ∗(G; F), RP(G; F) and a certain type of labeling of the
vertices of F by the elements of G. These labelings generalize and extend well
known labeling problems by natural numbers.
In Section 3 we deal with the problem RP ∗(G; F), where F is a disjoint union
of cycles. In order to treat these problems, we apply and extend the well known
concept of group sequencing. In the particular case when the factor F consists of a
single cycle, known results on group sequencing are applied to obtain corresponding
classiﬁcation theorems.
Section 4 deals with the connection between transitive large sets of disjoint de-
compositions and group sequencings (see Section 4 for the corresponding deﬁni-
tions). In order to obtain classiﬁcation results on such large sets, we apply the
known concept of R-sequencing of groups. We deﬁne also the notion of a Frobe-
nius set, which is a set of permutations having some properties similar to Frobenius
groups. We show that the existence of such sets is equivalent to the existence of
corresponding large sets.
In Section 5 we study a special case of decompositions, the inner-transitive
Hering decompositions.
We show that the classiﬁcation of such decompositions
is equivalent to the classiﬁcation of pairs (τ, N), where N is a group and τ is an
automorphism of a special type of N, called an (n, t) automorphism (see Section
5 for the corresponding deﬁnitions). In order to obtain this equivalence, we use
Glaubermann’s Z∗Theorem [7] and a generalization of this theorem (proved by
Artemovich [3]).
For a directed (or undirected) graph H, we shall use the standard notation V (H)
and E(H) for the vertex set and arc (or edge) set of H, respectively. All groups in
this article are ﬁnite. We use the standard notation of group theory.

Regular factorization and labeling of the vertices of a graph by
group elements
When dealing with regular factorizations of the complete graph K∗
n (Deﬁnition 1.2)
two fundamental problems arise:
1. For which factors F of K∗
n does there exist a solution to RP ∗(F);
2. Classify all pairs (G, F), where G is a group and F is a factor of K∗
n, for
which RP ∗(G; F) has a solution.

GRACEFULNESS, GROUP SEQUENCINGS AND FACTORIZATIONS
297
It emerges that the above problems are closely related to a problem of a certain
labeling of the vertices of F by the elements of G, the G-graceful labeling. The
deﬁnition is as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.1 Let G be a group of order n and let H be a (not necessarily
connected) directed graph with n vertices and n −1 arcs. We say that H is G-
graceful if there exists a bijection f : V (H) →G such that G−{1} = {f(v)f(u)−1 |
(u, v) ∈E(H)}.
Notice that in Deﬁnition 2.1 all the elements of the multiset {f(v)f(u)−1 |
(u, v) ∈E(H)} are distinct. Notice also that F may have isolated vertices.
Example 2.2 The following are three simple examples of G-graceful graphs. The
corresponding G-graceful labelings are speciﬁed by the notation of the vertices.
1. Let G be the additive group Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} and let H be the following
directed graph: V (H) = {0, 1, 2, 3}, E(H) = {(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3)}.
2. Let G be the additive group Z5 and let H be the following directed graph:
V (H) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, E(H) = {(1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3), (3, 1)} (i.e., H has a unique
isolated vertex).
3. Let G be the additive group Z6 and let H be the following directed graph:
V (H) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, E(H) = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)} (i.e., H has two
isolated vertices).
The following result ([10], Theorem 3.2) clariﬁes the connection between regular
factorization problems and the notion of G-graceful graphs.
Theorem 2.3 Let G be a group of order n and let F be a directed graph with
n vertices and n −1 arcs. Then RP ∗(G; F) has a solution if and only if F is
G-graceful.
Remark 2.4 When a bijection f : V (F) →G is given for a G-graceful graph F
(like in Deﬁnition 2.1), we shall identify each vertex v of F with its image in G, i.e.,
with f(v). Thus the edges of F are some ordered pairs of elements of G. Moreover,
the distinct copies of F in the factorization F | K∗
n (whose existence is ensured by
Theorem 2.3) are given by group multiplication on the right. More precisely, the
distinct copies of F are F g, g ∈G, where (x, y) is an arc of F if and only if (xg, yg)
is an arc of F g (here x, y ∈G).
Theorem 2.3 extends a result of Rosa [16] on β-valuations and ρ-valuations.
These notions are deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.5 Let H be an undirected graph.
1. An injection f : V (H) →{0, 1, . . . , |E(H)|} is called a β-valuation (graceful
labeling) if |f(x) −f(y)| are distinct for all {x, y} ∈E(H). A graph which admits
a β-valuation is called a graceful graph.
2. An injection f : V (H) →{0, 1, . . . , 2|E(H)|} is called a ρ-valuation if {|f(x)−
f(y)| | {x, y} ∈E(H)} = {a1, a2, . . . , a|E(H)|}, where ai = i or ai = 2|E(H)|+1−i.

298
KAPLAN, LEV, RODDITY
Rosa introduced the above notions as a tool for decomposing the undirected
complete graph K2n+1 into isomorphic subgraphs on n + 1 vertices. In particular,
these notions were a tool for attacking the well known conjecture of Ringel [15]
which says:
Conjecture. Let T be any tree on n + 1 vertices. Then T | K2n+1.
Rosa proved that a tree T on n + 1 vertices has a ρ-valuation if and only if
Ringel’s conjecture holds for T. Therefore, if T has a β-valuation then T | K2n+1.
Since Rosa published his results [16], problems on graph valuations attracted a
lot of attention. An updated survey on this subject, including many references, is
found in [5].
It can be shown that the above results of Rosa are, in a sense, particular cases of
Theorem 2.3. For the result on β-valuation, the reader is referred to [10], Corollary
4.3. In order to see how the result on ρ-valuation follows from Theorem 2.3, we
shall conﬁne ourselves with the following example.
Example 2.6 Let T be the following undirected tree:
V (T) = {v0, v1, v2, v3, v4},
E(T) = {{v0, v1}, {v0, v2}, {v2, v3}, {v2, v4}}.
Notice that T has 4 edges. We shall obtain by Theorem 2.3 that T | K9 if and
only if T has a ρ-valuation. Let G = Z9, and let T ∗be the directed factor of K∗
9
obtained from T by adding 4 isolated vertices and considering the directed graph
obtained when each edge of T is replaced by two opposite arcs. Notice that T ∗has
9 vertices and 8 arcs. Consider the following Z9-graceful labeling of T ∗:
V (T ∗)
=
{0, 1, 2, . . . , 8},
E(T ∗)
=
{(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), (2, 5), (5, 2), (2, 6), (6, 2)}.
By Theorem 2.3 T ∗| K∗
9, and so it easily follows that T | K9. Furthermore,
one easily veriﬁes that the given Z9-graceful labeling of T ∗yields a corresponding
ρ-valuation of T. More generally, as in the current example, Theorem 2.3 implies
that for a tree T with n + 1 vertices, T | K2n+1 if and only if T has a ρ-valuation.
We note that Theorem 2.3 extends also another well known problem, namely the
using of diﬀerence sets for the construction of block designs. The reader is referred
to [10], Section 4.
We conclude this section with the following theorem, which enables us to treat
factorizations F ∗| K∗
n (or F | Kn), when F is an arc (edge) disjoint union of
cycles.
Such factorizations and their connection to group sequencing problems,
will be treated in the next section.
Theorem 2.7 Let F be a directed graph such that |V (F)| = |E(F)| = n, and let G
be a group of order n−1. Then RP ∗(G; F) has a solution if and only if there exists
a vertex v0 ∈V (F) of outdegree 1 and indegree 1, such that F −{v0} is G-graceful.

Regular Oberwolfach problems and group sequencings
We begin with the following deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.1 An Oberwolfach factorization of K∗
n (res., Kn) is a factorization
of K∗
n (Kn) into copies of a graph F, where F is an arc (edge) disjoint union of
directed (undirected) cycles.
Deﬁnition 3.2 Let G be a permutation group on V (K∗
n) (V (Kn)). The problem of
determining whether there exists a G-regular Oberwolfach factorization of K∗
n (Kn)
into copies isomorphic to F will be denoted ROP ∗(G; F) (ROP(G; F)). (Recall
the deﬁnition of regular factorizations given in Deﬁnition 1.2.)
The Oberwolfach factorization problem of K∗
n (or Kn) for a given F is far from
being settled. See [1] for a survey on this subject. When F consists of a single
cycle, then F is a hamiltonian cycle, and the corresponding factorization is called
a hamiltonian factorization. The existence of a hamiltonian factorization for the
undirected case (where n must be odd) is well known. The existence of a hamil-
tonian factorization for the directed case, for every n, was established by Tilson
[17].
The notion of G-regular hamiltonian factorizations is closely related to the well
known notion of group sequencing (see Theorem 3.4 below).
We give ﬁrst the
corresponding deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.3 Let G be a group of order n. A sequencing of G is a sequence
a1, a2, . . . , an of all the distinct elements of G, such that all the partial products
a1, a1a2, . . . , a1a2 · · · an are distinct (note that necessarily a1 = 1). A group having
a sequencing is called a sequenceable group.
The classiﬁcation of all the sequenceable groups is a well known problem, which
is still not settled. However, various inﬁnite families of sequenceable groups are
known. It is conjectured that all the non-abelian groups of order larger than 8 are
sequenceable (see [13], Section 5.4 for further details).
Applying Theorem 2.7, the following result can be proved (see [11], Corollary
3.1).
Theorem 3.4 Let n ≥3 and let G be a group of order n −1. Then K∗
n admits a
G-regular hamiltonian factorization if and only if G is sequenceable.
Using known results on group sequencing, we obtain (see [11], Corollary 3.2):
Corollary 3.5 Let n ≥3 and let G be a group of order n −1. Then K∗
n admits a
G-regular hamiltonian factorization if one of the following cases holds:
1. G is a solvable group with a unique element of order 2, except the case when
G is the quaternion group Q4;
2. G is a dihedral group, except the cases D3 and D4;
3. G is a dicyclic group, except the case when G is the quaternion group Q4;

300
KAPLAN, LEV, RODDITY
4. G is a non-abelian group of order pq, where p < q are odd primes such that
p has 2 as a primitive root.
We turn now to G-regular hamiltonian factorizations of the undirected graph
Kn. Notice ﬁrst that in this case n must be odd. Applying known results on group
sequencing, we obtain a full classiﬁcation, as speciﬁed in the following theorem.
Theorem 3.6 Let n ≥3 be an odd integer and let G be a group of order (n−1)/2.
Then Kn admits a G-regular hamiltonian factorization if and only if n ≡3 (mod 4).
For the proof of this theorem we applied Proposition 3.8 below. We include ﬁrst
the deﬁnition of the known concept of symmetric sequencing.
Deﬁnition 3.7 Let G be a group of order 2m with a unique element of order 2,
say z. A symmetric sequencing of G is a sequencing a0, a1, . . . , a2m−1 of G such
that am = z and am+i = a−1
m−i for 1 ≤i ≤m −1 (notice that the ﬁrst element is
denoted by a0 instead of a1).
Proposition 3.8 Let n ≥3 be an odd integer and let G be a group of order (n −
1)/2. Let G1 = ⟨z⟩× G, where z is an element of order 2, and suppose that G1 has
a symmetric sequencing. Then Kn admits a G-regular hamiltonian factorization.
Proposition 3.8 follows by Lemma 4.4 and Theorem 5.2 in [11]. For the proof of
Theorem 3.6 we applied, besides Proposition 3.8, a result of Anderson and Ihrig [2],
which asserts that every ﬁnite solvable group which has a unique element of order
2, except the quaternion group Q4, has a symmetric sequencing. For the detailed
proof (which uses also the theorem of Feit and Thompson) the reader is referred
to [11], Sections 4 and 5.
The general case of G-regular Oberwolfach factorizations was also treated in
[11]. It was shown there that the existence of G-regular Oberwolfach factorizations
is equivalent to the existence of some sequencings (called (l1, . . . , lt)-sequencings)
of the group G, which are extensions of the original notion of sequencing. These
sequencings may be used to obtain new G-regular factorizations.
We shall not
discuss further these results, and the reader is referred to [11] for details.

Transitive large sets of disjoint decompositions and group se-
quencings
The notions of large sets and transitive large sets are deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 4.1 A large set of disjoint decompositions of K∗
n (Kn) into cycles of
length k, denoted by k-LSD, is a partition of the set of all cycles of length k in K∗
n
(Kn) into disjoint decompositions of K∗
n (Kn) (i.e., no two decompositions have
a common cycle). We shall say that such a k-LSD is transitive, or H-transitive,
if there exists a permutation group H on the vertices of K∗
n (Kn) such that H is
transitive on the decompositions in the k-LSD. A transitive k-LSD will be denoted
by k-TLSD.

GRACEFULNESS, GROUP SEQUENCINGS AND FACTORIZATIONS
301
Notice that an n-LSD for K∗
n (or Kn) is a large set of disjoint hamiltonian
factorizations. This subject was treated by Bryant in [4]. In particular, it was
proved there that for each odd n ≥3 there exists a large set of disjoint hamiltonian
factorizations of Kn.
Theorem 3.4 on G-regular hamiltonian factorizations enables us to obtain a result
on an n-TLSD for K∗
n (Theorem 4.3 below). However, we need ﬁrst the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.2 Let G be a group. If one (and so, up to group isomorphism, all)
of the decompositions in a k-TLSD is G-regular, we shall say that the k-TLSD is
G-regular.
It emerges that when a regular hamiltonian factorization of K∗
n is given, or,
equivalently (see Theorem 3.4), when a sequenceable group of order n −1 is given,
we can construct a corresponding n-TLSD for K∗
n. Thus we have (see [12], Theorem
1):
Theorem 4.3 Let G be a group of order n −1, where n ≥3. Then there exists a
G-regular n-TLSD for K∗
n if and only if G is sequenceable.
Applying known results on group sequencing, we obtain (see [12], Corollary 1.1):
Corollary 4.4 There exists a regular n-TLSD for the following values of n:
1. All odd n, n ≥3;
2. All n such that n = pq + 1, where p < q are odd primes and p has 2 as a
primitive root.
For the undirected case, we have (see [12], Theorem 2):
Theorem 4.5 Let n ≥3 be an odd integer and let G be a group of order (n−1)/2.
Then there exists a G-regular n-TLSD for Kn if and only if n ≡3 (mod 4).
For each odd n, n ≥3, there exists a group G of order n −1 having a symmetric
sequencing (see Deﬁnition 3.7 and [2]; we can choose, for instance, a cyclic group).
By using this we can construct an n-TLSD for the undirected graph Kn. Thus we
obtain the following (see [12], Theorem 3).
Theorem 4.6 For each odd n, n ≥3, there exists an n-TLSD for Kn.
In [12] we have studied also n −1-LSDs, i.e. LSDs of decompositions into cycles
of size n −1 of K∗
n or Kn. Such cycles were called almost hamiltonian cycles, and
the corresponding decompositions were called almost hamiltonian decompositions.
For introducing the corresponding results, we include ﬁrst the known concept of
R-sequencing.
Deﬁnition 4.7 Let G be a group of order n. An R-sequencing of G is a sequence
a0 = 1, a1, . . . , an−1 of all the distinct elements of G, such that a0a1 · · · an−1 = 1 and
such that all the partial products a0, a0a1, . . . , a0a1 · · · an−2 are distinct. (Exactly

302
KAPLAN, LEV, RODDITY
one element of G does not occur among these partial products.) A group having
an R-sequencing is called an R-sequenceable group.
It emerges that the connection between R-sequenceable groups and regular al-
most hamiltonian decompositions is similar to the connection between sequenceable
groups and regular hamiltonian decompositions. We have (see [12], Theorem 4):
Theorem 4.8 Let n ≥4 be an integer and let G be a group of order n. Then
K∗
n has a G-regular almost hamiltonian decomposition if and only if G is R-
sequenceable.
As for almost hamiltonian regular large sets, we have the following result ([12],
Theorem 5).
Theorem 4.9 Let n be a prime power. Then there exists a regular (n −1)-TLSD
for K∗
n.
The proof of Theorem 4.9 is based on a construction which is induced by a
Frobenius group of order n(n −1), where n is a prime power. It emerges that the
concept of a Frobenius set deﬁned below is closely related to regular (n−1)-TLSDs
of K∗
n.
Deﬁnition 4.10 Let G be a regular subgroup of the symmetric group Sn and let
H be a subgroup of Sn of order n −1. We shall say that the set HG = {hg |
h ∈H, g ∈G} is a Frobenius set if every x ∈HG −{1} ﬁxes at most one letter
from {1, 2, . . . , n}. We shall call the groups G, H a kernel and a complement of the
Frobenius set, respectively.
Notice that every Frobenius group of order n(n −1), where n is a prime power,
is a Frobenius set.
We deﬁne the following.
Deﬁnition 4.11 An (n −1)-LSD of K∗
n is strongly Sn−2-transitive if for every
pair of diﬀerent vertices v1, v2 ∈V = V (K∗
n), the subgroup of Sym(V ) of all
permutations which ﬁx both v1 and v2 acts transitively (and so regularly) on the
(n −2)! decompositions in the LSD.
The following result makes clear the connection between the last two deﬁnitions.
(See Lemma 5.1 in [12].)
Proposition 4.12 Let G be a group of order n.
Then K∗
n admits a G-regular
strongly Sn−2-transitive (n −1)-LSD if and only if there exists a G-regular almost
hamiltonian decomposition of K∗
n such that ⟨h⟩G is a Frobenius set, where h is the
permutation induced by one of the cycles in the decomposition.
We conclude this section with the following two conjectures.
Conjecture. A Frobenius set with a kernel G of order n and a cyclic complement
H of order n −1 exists if and only if n is a prime power.

GRACEFULNESS, GROUP SEQUENCINGS AND FACTORIZATIONS

Clearly, the validity of this conjecture will imply:
Conjecture. There exists a G-regular strongly Sn−2-transitive (n−1)-LSD of K∗
n
if and only if n is a prime power.

Inner transitive Hering conﬁgurations
In this section we deal with inner transitive factorizations of K∗
n [14].
Deﬁnition 5.1 Let F | K∗
n be a factorization of K∗
n, where F is a disjoint union
of directed cycles and (possibly) some isolated vertices. Denote by F1, F2, . . . , Fm
all the (arc disjoint) factors in the factorization. For each factor Fi, 1 ≤i ≤m, let
σi ∈Sn be the permutation deﬁned by σi(k) = l if and only if (k, l) is an arc of
Fi. Let G be the group generated by σ1, . . . , σm. Then the factorization is inner
transitive if G permutes the factors F1, . . . , Fm transitively.
In many cases the group generated by the σis will be Sn or An, and the factor-
ization will not be inner transitive. It may be interesting, and certainly not easy,
to classify the inner transitive factorizations.
In this section we classify the inner transitive Hering conﬁgurations. A Hering
conﬁguration is a special type of factorization of K∗
n deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.2 A factorization F | K∗
n is a Hering conﬁguration of type t and
order n if the following conditiond hold:
1. The factor F is a disjoint union of (n −1)/t directed cycles of size t and one
isolated vertex;
2. any two factors in the factorization have exactly one edge (undirected arc) in
common. That is, if the common edge is {i, j}, then the arc (i, j) lies in one factor,
and the arc (j, i) lies in the second factor.
The Hering conﬁguration was introduced by Hering [9].
Since then, various
papers have been published (see [14], p. 380), which deal mainly with the problem
of classifying the pairs (n, t) for which a Hering conﬁguration of type t and order
n exists, and with the classiﬁcation of such conﬁgurations. In [14] a classiﬁcation
was given for all the pairs (n, t) for which an inner transitive Hering conﬁguration
of type t and order n exists. This classiﬁcation used a deep result in group theory
- Glaubermann’s Z∗-theorem [6] and its generalization proved by Artemovich [3].
We note that the result of Artemovich uses the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite simple
groups.
A key notion in the classiﬁcation of inner transitive Hering conﬁgurations is the
notion of (n, t)-automorphisms, deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.3 Let N be a ﬁnite group. An automorphism τ of N is an (n, t)-
automorphism of N if the following conditions hold:
1. o(τ) = t;

304
KAPLAN, LEV, RODDITY
2. [N : CN(τ i)] = n for every 1 ≤i ≤t −1;
3. (t, |N|) = 1;
4. Denote G = ⟨τ⟩N, and let K be the conjugacy class of τ in G. Then for any
distinct x, y ∈K, xy−1 does not commute with any element of K.
It emerges that every (n, t)-automorphism induces an inner transitive Hering
conﬁguration of type t and order n. We have ([14], Theorem 1):
Theorem 5.4 Let τ be an (n, t)-automorphism of a group N, where t ≥3, and
let K = {τ1, τ2, . . . , τn} be the conjugacy class of τ in the semidirect product G =
⟨τ⟩N. For each i, 1 ≤i ≤n, let Fi be the factor of K∗
n deﬁned as follows: for
vk, vl ∈V (K∗
n), (vk, vl) ∈E(K∗
n) if and only if τ −1
i
τkτi = τl. Then the Fis provide
an inner transitive Hering conﬁguration of type t and order n (with corresponding
transitive group G = ⟨τ⟩N).
Notice that Theorem 5.4 enables us to construct various Hering conﬁgurations.
Furthermore, using the Z∗-theorem (and its generalization) we can show that all
the inner transitive Hering conﬁgurations can be constructed in the way described
in 5.4. More precisely, we have the following result ([14], Theorem 3).
Theorem 5.5 Let t ≥3 be a natural number. Then any inner transitive Hering
conﬁguration of type t and order n is induced (in the sense of 5.4) by some (n, t)-
automorphism.
The above results enables us to classify all the pairs (n, t) for which an inner
transitive hering conﬁguration of type t and order n exists (these are exactly the
pairs (n, t) for which an (n, t)-automorphism exists). We conclude our brief survey
with the following (see Theorem 5 in [14]).
Theorem 5.6 Let t ≥3 be a natural number and let n = pe1
1 pe2
2 · · · per
r , where the
pis are all the distinct prime divisors of n. Then there exists an inner transitive
Hering conﬁguration of type t and order n if and only if t divides pei
i −1 for every
1 ≤i ≤r.

Abstract
We give an overview of results on the orbit structure of ﬁnite group actions with an
emphasis on abstract linear groups. The main questions considered are the number
of orbits, the number of orbit sizes and the existence of large orbits, particularly
regular orbits. Applications of such results to some important problems in group
and representation theory are also discussed, such as the k(GV )–problem and the
Taketa problem.

Introduction
Ever since the beginning of abstract group theory the study of group actions has
played a fundamental role in its development. In ﬁnite group theory this is all too
obvious in that the fundamental theorems of Sylow – without which ﬁnite group
theory would not get beyond its beginnings – are based on the study of various
group actions. Group actions capture the fact that every group can be represented
as a permutation group, and permutation groups were the ﬁrst groups to be con-
sidered when the abstract term of a group had not yet been coined.
Naturally information on the orbits induced by a group action is vital to an
understanding of the action which is why a wealth of such results is scattered
throughout the literature. Rarely however are the orbits the main focus of the
investigation, and most results on orbits are proved with applications to other
questions in mind. This shows that – as in the case of Sylow’s theorems – a result
on the orbits of a group action often is at the core of a seemingly unrelated prob-
lem. Unfortunately, however, general questions on orbits tend to be very hard to
answer and often can be solved under specialized restrictions only.
In this survey article we discuss some recent results on orbits in ﬁnite group
actions, concentrating on abstract groups and focussing on one of the most impor-
tant kinds of group actions, namely that of linear groups on ﬁnite modules. We
also describe some of the applications of these results to problems in group theory
as well as representation theory, such as the k(GV )–problem, the Taketa problem
and bounding the Fitting height in coprime group actions, and others. All this is
spiced up with a number of open problems for further research. Needless to say, in
the choice of the topics treated here we have also been guided by our own research

interests.
All groups throughout this paper are ﬁnite.

The number of orbits
Let G be a group acting on a G–module V . One of the most fundamental questions
on the orbit structure is the one for the number of orbits of G on V . Here we denote
this by r(G, V ). Of course, there is the beautiful, general and elementary Cauchy–
Frobenius orbit counting formula (also known as Burnside’s lemma) stating that
r(G, V ) =
1
|G|

g∈G
|CV (g)|
which is extremely useful in many instances.
To calculate (or at least bound)
r(G, V ) with it, however, the group action must be known very well which in gen-
eral situations is not always the case.
In the literature r(G, V ) is often studied in the setting of permutation groups.
Let G be a permutation group with a regular elementary abelian normal subgroup
V . (It is well–known that solvable primitive permutation groups always have this
structure.) Then G = HV is the semidirect product of a point stabilizer H and V ,
and r(H, V ) happens to be the rank of the permutation group.
One line of investigation on r(G, V ) is to describe (or, if possible, characterize)
group actions with given r(G, V ). For instance, if r(G, V ) = 2, then GV is a doubly
transitive permutation group, and so the structure of GV is known; solvable dou-
bly transitive permutation groups were classiﬁed by Huppert [47], and the general
case was a consequence of the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups (see e.g. [12,
Theorem 4.11 and, in particular, Table 7.3]); the aﬃne case, which is of interest
to us here, was done by Hering [46]. The cases r(G, V ) = 3 and 4 also have been
studied intensely (see [22, 23, 29, 75, 79]).
Another – for our emphasis on abstract groups more relevant – line of investi-
gation is the search for good lower bounds on r(G, V ) in terms of parameters of G
and V . A very general and elementary result useful for induction arguments is the
following
Lemma 2.1 [29] Let V be imprimitive, so that V = V1 ⊕. . . ⊕Vn, where the Vi
are permuted by G. Let H = NG(V1). Then
r(G, V ) ≥
 r(H, V ) + n −1
n

.
This lemma is best possible in the sense that if N =
n
i=1
NG(Vi) is isomorphic to
the direct product of all the NG(Vi)/CG(Vi) (i = 1, . . . , n) and G/N ∼= Sn (= the

308
KELLER
symmetric group on n letters), then equality holds.
For solvable groups, however, a lot more can be said. Dornhoﬀ[21] was the
ﬁrst to give an upper bound for |V | in terms of r(G, V ) in the case that G acts
primitively, but not semilinearly on V . Note that in case of semilinear action, i.e.,
GV ≤
∼AΓ(GF(|V |)), where AΓ(gn) := {x →axσ + b | a, b ∈GF(qn), a ̸= 0, σ ∈
Aut(GF(qn))} for any prime q, no such bound exists. Later Seager [104] sharpened
and quantiﬁed Dornhoﬀ’s result as follows:
Theorem 2.2 Let p be a prime and let G be a solvable primitive subgroup of the
linear group GL(n, p), and let V be the natural underlying vector space. Suppose
that GV is not isomorphic to a subgroup of AΓ(pn). Then
r(G, V ) >
p
n
2
12n + 1
except possibly when pn ∈{174, 194, 76, 58, 78, 138, 79, 316, 516}.
In [105] Seager generalized this to include also imprimitive actions as follows:
Theorem 2.3 Let G be a solvable group and V be a ﬁnite faithful irreducible G–
module. Then one of the following holds:
(i) |V | ≤

r(G,V )+1.43
24
1
3
c
for c = 36.435663, or
(ii) for some integers m, k with k ≤0.157 log3

r(G,V )+1.43
24
1
3

and a prime p we have
|V | = pmk and G ≤
∼Spm ≀Sk (as permutation group on V ) in its primitive action
on GF(pm)k.
For solvable groups the derived length dl(G) is one of the most important pa-
rameters to measure the group’s complexity and how far it is away from being
abelian. One naturally would expect r(G, V ) to grow rapidly with dl(G). This is
indeed the case, and Seager’s results make it easy to obtain the qualitatively best
possible bound.
Theorem 2.4 Let G be solvable and let V be a ﬁnite faithful irreducible G–module.
Then there exist universal constants C1, C2 such that
dl(G) ≤C1 log log r(G, V ) + C2.
Proof By [81, Theorem 3.12(b)] we have dl(G) ≤2 log2 dim V , and as dim V ≤
log2 |V |, we see that there exist universal constants D1, D2 such that dl(G) ≤
D1 log log |V | + D2 (∗). Now the Corollary in [105, Section 6] yields that either
dl(G) ≤7.22 + 5
2 log2 log3

r(G,V )+1.43
24


– in which case we are obviously done – or
|V | ≤r(G,V )+1.43

. But in the latter case using (∗) also implies the assertion, and
so the theorem is proved.

As an application of these results we mention that Theorem 2.2 plays an integral
role in the answer to a question of R. Brauer in the modular representation theory of
ﬁnite groups, namely, whether for k ∈IN there are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism
types of defect groups of blocks with exactly k ordinary characters. This question
(known as Brauer’s Problem 21) is a generalization of an old theorem of Landau
stating that for k ∈IN there are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes of ﬁnite
groups with exactly k conjugacy classes. Using Theorem 2.2, K¨ulshammer [70]
could answer this question in the aﬃrmative by proving
Theorem 2.5 There exists a function h : IN →IN such that if B is a block of a
solvable group with defect group D containing exactly k irreducible complex char-
acters, then |D| ≤h(k).
Later K¨ulshammer [72] extended his result to p–solvable groups by proving the
following result [71]
Theorem 2.6 Let V be a ﬁnite vector space of characteristic p, and let G be a
p–solvable semilinear group on V . If G has exactly k orbits on the corresponding
projective space, then G contains a solvable normal subgroup N such that |G/N| ≤
f(k) for some universal function f : IN →IN.
Problem: The function h and f in Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 are far from best possible.
What would more “realistic” functions look like (asymptotically)?
3
The number of orbit sizes
In the previous section we saw that the number of orbits of a group on a ﬁnite vec-
tor space tends to be large as the size and the complexity of the group increases; for
solvable groups this was particularly striking. Obviously one would expect the sizes
of the orbits to vary quite a bit, that is, if n(G, V ) = |{|vG|
 v ∈V }| denotes the
number of orbit sizes of G on V , one would expect n(G, V ) to be large in some sense.
Also, as was the case with r(G, V ), group actions with n(G, V ) very small are
of a limited structure, e.g. solvable groups acting faithfully and irreducibly on the
ﬁnite G–module V with n(G, V ) = 2 were characterized by Passman. Once again
the problem is disguised as one in permutation groups: A permutation group on
Ωis 3
2–transitive if it is transitive and all orbits of a point stabilizer on Ωwithout
that point are of the same length > 1. So studying aﬃne 3
2–transitive permutation
groups amounts to looking at linear group group actions with n(G, V ) = 2. Pass-
man [93, 94] even characterized all solvable 3
2–transitive permutation groups.
Next we ask – similarly as in Section 2 – for good lower bounds on n(G, V ) in
terms of parameters of G and V . In general it is quite delicate to prove strong
statements on n(G, V ).
This is in part because if v, w ∈V and we know |vG|

310
KELLER
and |wG|, basically nothing can be said about |(v + w)|G. The only result in this
direction in due to Yuster [127, Theorem 1.5]:
Theorem 3.1 Let H, G be groups such that H acts on G by automorphisms. Sup-
pose there exist x, y ∈G such that (|xH|, |yH|) = 1. Then
|(xy)H| = |xH| · |yH|.
Unfortunately, the hypothesis of the orbit sizes being coprime is quite special.
Still intuitively it is clear that in group actions with many orbits one would expect
many diﬀerent orbit sizes, that is, n(G, V ) should grow rapidly (not as rapidly
as r(G, V ), though) with the complexity of G. If G has an extraspecial normal
subgroup, this is indeed the case, as the following general result [61, Theorem 1.5]
shows:
Theorem 3.2 Let G be a group and V be a ﬁnite G–module over GF(p) for a
prime p. Suppose that E  G is a q–group for a prime q such that Z(E) acts ﬁxed
point freely on V . Suppose that |E| = q2m+1 for some m ≥11, and suppose that E
is extraspecial of exponent q or 4. Then
n(G, V ) ≥m −10.
The proof of this result explicitly exhibits representatives of the orbits whose
centralizers form a chain of subgroups of G, so the proof is fairly “constructive”.
An even stronger statement should be true:
Conjecture: The conclusion of Theorem 3.2 essentially remains true if E is an
arbitrary q–group of class at most 2 and of exponent q or 4.
The conjecture is unknown even for solvable groups; for groups of odd order and
q ≥5 it was proved in [61, Theorem 2.1], and this was generalized further in [62,
Lemma 1.13] to a more technical statement.
We remark that once we assume that the ﬁeld over which we work is suﬃciently
large relative to G, it is not hard to prove very strong results of this kind, because
over large ﬁelds the set {CG(v) | v ∈V } is closed under building intersections
which makes it a lot easier to show that {|CG(v)| | v ∈V } = n(G, V ) is large. In
[59, Theorem 2.5] Moret´o and Jaikin–Zapirain show the following concerning the
rank rk(G) = max{d(H) | H ≤G} (where d(H) denotes the minimum number of
generators of H).
Theorem 3.3 Let G be a group and V a faithful FG–module, where F is a ﬁeld
of order greater than the number of subgroups of G and of characteristic zero or
coprime to |G|. Then
rk(G) ≤3
2n(G, V )2 + 1
2n(G, V ) + 1.

Conjecture (Moret´o, Jaikin–Zapirain): A linear bound holds in the above
theorem.
For solvable groups we now present an analogue to Theorem 2.4. Considering
the action of the group of, say, lower triangular matrices over GF(p) on a faithful
module of coprime characteristic readily shows that in general at best we can ex-
pect a logarithmic bound for dl(G) in n(G, V ) (see [64, Example 1.6]).
For A–groups, that is, solvable groups all of whose Sylow subgroups are abelian,
Marshall [82] proved that dl(G) is bounded above by some function of n(G, V ) in
case of G acting faithfully and completely reducibly on V . The function is not
explicitly given, but is exponential. However, in [60] a much stronger bound is ob-
tained, namely, essentially dl(G) is bounded above by
log |n(G,V )|
log log |n(G,V )| which is even
stronger that logarithmic. The best bound from below obtained (by constructing
examples) is of the size

log |n(G,V )|
log log |n(G,V )|
 1
2 , so the upper bound is nearly best pos-
sible. It is not known, however, what the real bound is. (Note that these results
are not stated explicitly in [60], but only in their character theoretic version, from
which they easily follow).
The general case has ﬁnally been settled in [61, 62, 64] with the following result.
Theorem 3.4 There exist universal constants C1, C2 such that for any solvable
group G acting faithfully and irreducibly on a ﬁnite G–module V we have
dl(G) ≤C1 log n(G, V ) + C2.
The actual proof brings about log = log2, C1 = 24, C2 = 364, but these constants
certainly are not best possible. It falls into two major parts: ﬁrst, a logarithmic
bound for dl(G/F(G)) in n(G, V ), second, a logarithmic bound for dl(F(G)) in
terms of n(G, V ). The latter result has an immediate predecessor due to Isaacs
[55, Theorem 2.1] which only obtains a linear bound, but works for arbitrary (not
only solvable) groups. Its most general version reads as follows:
Theorem 3.5 Let the group G act by automorphisms on the abelian p′–group V
(where p is a prime) and write P = Op(G). Then
dl(P/CP (V )) ≤n(G, V ) + 1.
Problem: Does even a logarithmic bound hold in this general situation?
One way of improving the constants in Theorem 3.4 would be to improve the
inductive process underlying the key lemmas 1.7 and 3.21 in [62]. Both require the
existence of nine nontrivial orbits of some group on a module, but analyzing their
proofs shows that six would be suﬃcient if one could solve the following curious

312
KELLER
and purely combinatorial problem for k = 6.
Problem: Suppose that for i, j, k ∈IN we are given Mijk ⊆IN with |Mijk| = k.
Find a k ∈IN and aij = aij(k) ∈IN (i = 1, . . . , k, j ∈IN) such that the following
hold:
(1) aij ∈Mijk for i = 1, . . . , k, and j ∈IN
(2) For any i ∈{1, . . . , k} we have
(a)
ai1, . . . , ai5 are mutually distinct
(b)
aij ̸∈{ai1, ai2, ai3, ai4} for j ≥5
(3) For any 1 ≤l < m ≤k and any j ∈IN we have
{al1, . . . , alj} ̸= {am1, . . . , amj}
It is easy to see that there can be no general solutions for k = 5: If Mij5 =
{1, . . . , 5} for all i, j, then (2) and (3) contradict each other. Also, there is a gen-
eral solution for k = 9 (which is the core of [62, Lemmas 1.7 and 3.21]):
Without loss let ai1 = i for i = 1, . . . , 9, and then construct aij (j ≥2, i =
1, . . . , 9) observing (2) and such that aij ̸∈{i + 5, i + 6, i + 7, i + 8} (to be read
modulo 9) for all i. This is possible as |Mij9| = 9 for all i, j.
But it is open whether there is a solution for k = 6. In the seemingly most
restricted case that Mij6 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for all i, j one can solve the problem by
taking aij = i + j −1 (mod 6) for i = 1, . . . , 6 and j = 1, . . . , 5, and aij = ai5 for
all i and j ≥5. This is why a general solution for k = 6 should exist – but none
has been found so far.
We turn to the main application of theorems on orbit sizes for solvable groups
which is a fairly old question in the character theory of such groups.
A well–known result by K. Taketa [115] states that M–groups, that is, groups
all of whose irreducible complex characters are monomial (i.e., induced from some
linear character of a subgroup of G), are solvable and more precisely, if G is an
M–group, then dl(G) ≤|cd(G)|, where cd(G) = {χ(1) | χ ∈Irr(G)} is the set
of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of G. From this old result in
the 1970s there originated the Isaacs–Seitz–conjecture that dl(G) ≤|cd(G)| should
hold for arbitrary solvable groups, and over the time work of Isaacs [53], Berger
[2], and Gluck [33] proved the conjecture for groups of odd order and also that in
general dl(G) ≤2|cd(G)|.
While these results (proved using mostly character theoretic arguments) are quite
satisfying, early on there has been a feeling that a linear bound asymptotically may
be far too large. Studies of certain “prominent” families of p–groups (see [49], [56],
[95], and [97] rep. [41]) all gave logarithmic bounds, so that at least for p–groups a
logarithmic bound is expected. Moreover, groups with dl(G) = |cd(G)| seem to be

ORBITS IN FINITE GROUP ACTIONS
313
rare as dl(G) grows: Examples are known only up to 5 (see [50, 18.8 and §27] for
constructions of such examples), and for |cd(G)| ≤5 it has also been shown that
dl(G) ≤|cd(G)| (see [54, Theorem 12.15], [89], [30], [73], [74]). All these results
indicate that dl(G) might grow slower than linearly with |cd(G)|.
As it happens, the results on orbit sizes presented above shed some more light on
the question. Namely if V is a G–module, then so is V0 = Irr(V ), and we consider
the semidirect product GV0. By [54, Problem (6.18)] every λ ∈V0 can be extended
to its inertia group in GV , from which it can be induced to an irreducible char-
acter of GV . This shows that every orbit size of G on V0 is a complex irreducible
character degree of GV . Using this allows a translation of results on orbit sizes to
results on character degrees.
For A–groups this means that dl(G) is bounded above by a bound whose order
of magnitude is
ln |cdG|
ln ln |cdG| (see [60, Theorem 2.4]). More importantly, the character
theoretic version of Theorem 3.4 reads as follows (see [64, Corollary 2.2]):
Theorem 3.6 Let G be a solvable group. Then
dl(G/F(G)) ≤24 log2 |cd(G)| + 364.
(Observe that combining this with [58, Corollary 2.3] yields a linear bound for
dl(G) in |cd(G)| which is smaller than Gluck’s bound 2|cd(G)| for large values of
|cd(G)|.)
From Theorem 3.6 it is obvious that in general one should expect dl(G) to be
bounded logarithmically in |cd(G)|, but amazingly the case of p–groups, for which
the linear bound was proven ﬁrst (as p–groups are M–groups) and from which
the doubts about the linear bound originated, is as of yet still unsolved. To get a
general logarithmic bound, it remains to prove the following
Conjecture: There exist universal constants C1, C2 such that if G is a solvable
group, then
dl(F(G)) ≤C1 log |cd(G)| + C2.
(A linear bound can be found in [58, Corollary 2.3].)
So essentially this means that the problem has been reduced to the case of p–
groups for which it is as open as it could be. A result of Noritzsch [90] demonstrated
the bad inductive behaviour of |cd(G)| in p–groups; work of Slattery [114] shows
how hard it is to even obtain tiny improvements on the bound dl(G) ≤|cd(G)|.
As such the above conjecture presents one of the toughest challenges for group
theorists working on p–groups for the years to come.
We conclude this section by mentioning some oﬀspring of the Taketa prob-
lem. One is the “Taketa problem for modular character degrees” which asks for

314
KELLER
bounds for dl(G/Op(G)) in terms of |cdp(G)|, the number of irreducible p–Brauer
character degrees. The best bound known to date is of the order of magnitude
|cdp(G)| · log |cdp(G)| (see [64, Theorem 2.3]; cf. also [55] and [16] for related re-
sults). However, also here a logarithmic bound is expected.
A generalization of the Taketa problem is to study the set of A–invariant char-
acters if A acts on G coprimely. This setting usually involves character correspon-
dences; results along these lines have been obtained by Wolf [124], Navarro [88],
and Turull [118]. All bounds obtained on derived lengths in these papers are linear.
But also here one would expect them to be logarithmic. Other interesting varia-
tions of the Taketa problem are presented by Isaacs and Knutson in [58], where
dl(N) is bounded (for N G) in terms of the numbers of characters of G not having
N in their kernel.
4
Large orbits
One of the most important and natural goals of many studies on orbits is to estab-
lish the existence of an orbit of a certain size, and of particular interest are extreme
cases. However, there are hardly any results on the existence of very small orbits;
the only result that comes to mind is due to Berger ([2], see also [81, Section 8])
and states if V is a symplectic GF(p)G–module (with respect to some nonsingular
symplectic G–invariant form) for some odd prime p and an odd order group G,
then G has an orbit of size at most pn+1
2
, a result that is not true without the
oddness hypothesis. This result is used to prove the Isaacs–Seitz conjecture for
odd–order groups. Sometimes orbits are considered that in some sense are small.
In [81, Sections 9 and 10] linear group actions are studied where all orbits have
small (normally trivial) p–part for a prime p, and in [45] a situation is studied
where vG = vH for all v, where H is a complement to a certain normal subgroup
of G (see also [44] for an application).
On the other side, there has been a deep interest and need to examine the size
of the largest possible orbits in linear group actions for a long time, and from this
a large body of literature evolved. Obviously the size of an orbit can never exceed
|G|. An orbit of size |G| is called a regular orbit. If V is a G–module with a regular
orbit, this means that there is a v ∈V with CG(v) = 1. We remark that if V is a
faithful ﬁnite–dimensional G–module over an inﬁnite ﬁeld, then

1̸=g∈G
CV (g) ⊂V
and so always a regular orbit exists.
If G is abelian and V a completely reducible faithful G–module, it is easy to see
that there always exists a regular orbit. If G is a p–group for some prime p and V
is a ﬁnite faithful and irreducible G–module over GF(q) for a prime q with p ̸= q,
then G always has a regular orbit on V unless one of the following holds:
(i) p = 2 and q is a Mersenne prime or a Fermat prime
(ii) p is a Mersenne prime and q = 2

315
The cases (i), and (ii) are true exceptions, as can be shown by suitable examples.
It can also be shown that if G does not involve a section isomorphic to Cp≀Cp (where
Cp is the cyclic group of order p), then G has a regular orbit on V . All these results
and more are collected in [81, Section 4]; cf. also [51]. Even in the exceptional cases
there always exist large orbits. Improving former results of Passman [92], Isaacs
[57] proved the following result (and also some reﬁnements of it):
Theorem 4.1 Let G be a nontrivial p–group that acts faithfully on a group H,
where p does not divide |H|.
Then there exists an element x ∈H such that
|CG(x)| ≤

|G|
p
 1
p . In particular, |CG(x)| ≤|G|

2 .
The theorem is quite general in that H need not be a vector space, and not even
abelian. This is due to the fact, proved by Hartley and Turull [43, Lemma 2.6.2],
that if A acts by automorphisms on G with (|A|, |G|) = 1, then there exists an
abelian group G0 of squarefree exponent such that the actions of G and G0 are
permutation isomorphic. So without loss in coprime situations it always suﬃces to
consider linear group actions on G–modules.
Large orbits still exist if G is allowed to be supersolvable. Wolf [125] proved the
existence of orbits of size at least |G|
1
2 for supersolvable G acting faithfully on a
completely reducible G–module V . Isaacs asked the following:
Question: If V is a faithful G–module with (|G|, |V |) = 1 and G solvable, does
there always exist an orbit of size at least |G|
1
2 ?
Related results are concerned with regular orbits of nilpotent Hall subgroups of
groups. Espuelas ([25] or [81, Theorem 7.3]) proved that if G is solvable and V
is a ﬁnite faithful G–module and P ∈SylpG such that Op(G) = 1 and p is odd,
then P has a regular orbit on V . (For p = 2 this is also true if P is C2 ≀C2–free.)
Under some more oddness hypotheses Carlip [15] extends this result to nilpotent
Hall subgroups (see also [27] for an earlier version). A very detailed study has been
carried out by Hargraves ([42], see also [28]): If A is nilpotent and acts on the
solvable group G by automorphisms, and if V is a faithful irreducible AG–module
over a ﬁeld of characteristic not dividing |A|, then it is proved that in most cases
A has a regular orbit on V , and the exceptional cases are characterized. In later
work [5, 6, 7] this is extended to the question whether V |A contains copies of the
regular module. Other elaborations on Hargraves’ result can be found in [117], [39,
Lemma 2.6], [24] and [91, Proposition 3].
Proving the existence of regular orbits usually is done in two steps: First, prove
it in the (quasi–) primitive case. Then use an inductive argument to deal with the
imprimitive case. We therefore look at some results tailored for this strategy.
It turns out that the inductive behaviour of the existence of regular orbits is

316
KELLER
poor, but not entirely bad, at least for solvable groups. If it were good, then if G
acts faithfully and irreducibly on the ﬁnite G–module V such that V is induced
from the primitive (or quasiprimitive) module W, and H = NG(W)/CG(W) has
a regular orbit on W, we would expect to be able to conclude that also G has a
regular orbit on V . In general unfortunately this is not the case. However, if H has
s regular orbits on W for a suitable s > 1, then we often can conclude that G has s
regular orbits on V as well. For p–groups, this is demonstrated in [81, Lemma 4.6]
for s = 3, and it is also explained why s = 1 or 2 do not work. For odd order groups
the argument is shown for s = 2 in [26, Lemma 1.2]. Furthermore, for arbitrary
solvable groups the induction goes through for s = 5. This is a consequence of the
fact that if G is a primitive solvable permutation group on the set Ω, then there is
a partition of Ωinto four subsets such that only the identity stabilizes all of them
(cf. Section 6). For details we refer the reader to [126], where also a formula for
the number of regular orbits in certain wreath products is given.
It also would be interesting to have an inductive argument for the existence
of many regular orbits for nonsolvable groups. Since the solvable case is based
on the existence of small bases (resp. partitions stabilized only by the identity)
for solvable primitive permutation groups and since similar results are available in
the nonsolvable case with some exceptions, one could proceed similarly as in the
solvable case and in addition would have to handle the exceptional cases. We will
explore the concept of a base and results on it in more detail in Section 6.
In any case, induction works really well only if there are several regular orbits
which often is not the case, as there need not exist even a single one.
We now turn to results on regular orbits that can be applied if V is primitive,
thus addressing the inductive base of an inductive argument.
If G is solvable, it usually suﬃces to study quasiprimitive instead of primitive
modules. An irreducible G–module V is called quasiprimitive if VN is homogeneous
for all N G. For G this implies that all of its normal subgroups are cyclic, and such
groups have been described by P. Hall (see e.g. [48, III, 13.10]). See [81, Section 1]
for a detailed analysis in the solvable case. It turns out that the Fitting subgroup
F(G) of such groups is a central product of extraspecial groups (for various primes)
and a group T which is almost cyclic (that is, it has a normal subgroup of index at
most 2). Let e ∈IN such that e2 = |F(G)/T| is the order of the extraspecial part
modulo its center. In [81, Proposition 4.10] and [25] we ﬁnd the following result:
Theorem 4.2 Let G be solvable, and let V be a ﬁnite faithful quasiprimitive G–
module. If e > 118, or if |G| is odd and e > 1, then G has at least two regular
orbits on V .
In general groups with not–too–small normal extraspecial subgroups tend to
have regular orbits, as [61, Lemma 1.3] shows:

ORBITS IN FINITE GROUP ACTIONS
317
Theorem 4.3 Let G be a group and V be a faithful GF(q)–module for a prime q.
Suppose that E G is extraspecial of order p2m+1 such that CG(E) acts frobeniusly
on V (i.e., CG(E)V is a Frobenius group with kernel V ). If m ≥10, or if |G| is
odd and m ≥5, then G has a regular orbit on V .
The underlying principle of the proof of regular orbit theorems is to assume
that there is no regular orbit, so V ⊆

1̸=g∈G
CV (g) and |V | ≤
	
1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)| and
then use upper bounds on |CV (g)| to obtain a contradiction.
Theorem 4.3 is
no exception. Similarly, if G does not have s regular orbits on V , this leads to
|V | −(s −1)|G| ≤
	
1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)|, and so from the proof of Theorem 4.3 it becomes
clear that as we increase m, we can get as many regular orbits as we want.
In many instances, one can go beyond assuming V is primitive. A typical chain of
reductions (of a purported minimal counterexample to a theorem) is to successively
show that V can be assumed to be irreducible, primitive, scalar–primitive, tensor–
indecomposable and tensor–primitive (cf. [4, Section III]). After these reductions
the generalized Fitting subgroup F ∗(G) is either extraspecial or quasisimple, and
F ∗(G) acts absolutely irreducibly on V .
In both cases at least for large ﬁelds
regular orbit results exist. In the extraspecial case, Robinson and Thompson [103,
Theorem 8] proved:
Theorem 4.4 Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p with |F| ≥227, let G be
a group of order not divisible by p, and let V be a faithful FG–module. Suppose
further that, for some prime q, G has a normal q–subgroup Q which acts absolutely
irreducibly on V , and all of whose characteristic abelian subgroups are central.
Then G has a regular orbit on V .
In the quasisimple case, Liebeck [76] showed:
Theorem 4.5 Let p be a prime with p > 530.
Suppose that G is a group of
order not divisible by p and that V is a faithful GF(p)G–module such that G has
a quasisimple normal subgroup H which acts irreducibly on V . Then one of the
following holds:
(i) G has a regular orbit on V .
(ii) H = Ac (the alternating group on c letters), c < p, and V = {(v1, . . . , vc) | vi ∈
GF(p) for all i, and
c	
i=1
vi = 0} with coordinates permuted naturally by H.
(ii) is a real exception, as is demonstrated by examples in Liebeck’s paper. The-
orem 4.5 has been elaborated by Goodwin [37, 38] who weakened the restriction
on p considerably (see also [77] for a short survey on this).
We mention a few miscellaneous results on large orbits.
As outlined at the
beginning of this section, odd–order symplectic groups in odd characteristic have
small orbits. Espuelas [26] showed that they also have regular orbits:

318
KELLER
Theorem 4.6 Let G be a (solvable) group of odd order, p be a prime and V be
a faithful and completely reducible GF(p)G–module with respect to a nonsingular
symplectic G–invariant form. If p = 2, suppose in addition that 3 does not divide
|G|. Then G has at least two regular orbits on V .
If critical sections isomorphic to certain semilinear groups do not occur in the
odd order group G and p is a divisor of |G| with Op(G) = 1, then it is not too diﬃ-
cult to show that G has a p–regular orbit on Op′(G), that is, there is an x ∈Op′(G)
with |CG(x)| not divisible by p see [128]. In a similar vein, Manz and Wolf (see
[81, Theorem 11.4] prove the existence of arithmetically large orbits; more precisely,
they show that if G is solvable and H ≤G is such that the ﬁnite faithful irreducible
G–module V is induced from a primitive irreducible H–module W with H/CH(W)
not isomorphic to a semilinear group, then there exists a v ∈V such that |vG| is
divisible by each prime divisor p of |G| with p ≥5.
An interesting and new point of view on the problem of regular orbits is intro-
duced by Gluck and Magaard in [34]. For coprime group actions they consider the
problem of how many copies of a G–module V are needed so that G has a regular
orbit on their direct sum. For m ∈IN write mV for the direct sum of m copies of
V .
Theorem 4.7 Let G be a group and V be a faithful GF(q)G–module for a prime
power q with (|G|, q) = 1. If m ≥94, then G has at least 64 regular orbits on mV .
Most of the results presented in this section so far have not been proved for their
own sake, but to be applied to some problem in group and representation theory
as already browsing the titles of the cited literature indicates. Particularly regular
orbit theorems have found numerous applications in obvious and less obvious ways.
We take a look at some of the applications that results in this section have found.
One of the main ﬁelds of application of regular orbit theorems is a fairly old problem
having its origin in results of Dade [17] and Thompson [116]. The problem is to
bound the Fitting height h(G) of a ﬁnite solvable group by the composition length
l(A) (i.e., the number of primes of dividing |A|, counting multiplicities) of a ﬁnite
group A acting by automorphisms on G such that (|A|, |G|) = 1 and CG(A) = 1.
The problem has a long history which has been outlined in detail by A. Turull in
an expository paper [121] which is why we do not repeat it here and instead refer
to that paper for further reference. The conjecture h(G) ≤l(G) is still open in
general, but strong suﬃcient conditions have been developed which depend on the
existence of large orbits of subgroups of A on sections of G. In [120] Turull proved:
Theorem 4.8 Let A be a ﬁnite group and suppose it acts on the ﬁnite group G
with (|A|, |G|) = 1 and CG(A) = 1. (From the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups
it follows that G must be solvable in this setting.) Assume furthermore that for
every proper subgroup B of A and every B–invariant section S of G such that B
acts irreducibly on S, there is a v ∈S with CB(v) = CB(S) (i.e., B/CB(S) has a
regular orbit on S). Then h(G) ≤l(A).

ORBITS IN FINITE GROUP ACTIONS
319
In [122] Turull reﬁned this result; see also M. Pettet’s review of this work (MR98j:
20017) for an interesting discussion of it, and [123] for a new application.
For solvable A Turull proved that h(G) ≤2l(A), as follows immediately from the
following more general result [119]:
Theorem 4.9 Let A, G be ﬁnite solvable groups such that A acts on G and (|A|, |G|)
= 1. Then
h(G) ≤2l(A) + h(CG(A)).
Results on regular orbit theorems have also been applied to obtain new theorems
of Hall–Higman type (see [3] for a typical example), but going into this wide ﬁeld
would lead us too far astray.
Most other applications of results on large orbits are in the character theory of
ﬁnite groups. As indicated before, orbit sizes often can be interpreted as character
degrees, and so results on large orbits often are used to tackle problems in char-
acter theory. Typical examples are [25] or [81, Sections 14 and 17] and concern
large character degrees, p–parts of character degrees or Huppert’s ρ–σ–conjecture.
Theorem 4.3 is essential for the proof of Theorem 3.2, and Theorem 4.7 can be
translated into a result on base sizes (cf. Section 6). Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 played
a signiﬁcant role in work on the k(GV )–problem, a prominent and outstanding
problem which therefore we will discuss separately in the following section.
5
The k(GV)–problem
This problem originates from a question of Brauer in the modular representation
theory of ﬁnite groups. In 1956 Brauer [8] conjectured that if G is a ﬁnite group, p
a prime and B any p–block of G, then the number k(B) of irreducible characters
in B is bounded above by the order |D| = pd(B) of the defect group D of B, i.e.,
k(B) ≤pd(B).
This became known as Brauer’s k(B)–conjecture and so far has been proved
in full generality for d(B) ∈{0, 1, 2}. The best general bound to date is due to
Brauer and Feit [9] and states that k(B) ≤p2d(B)−2. For other results on Brauer’s
k(B)–conjecture that are not based on some solvability hypothesis see e.g. Michler’s
survey [83]. Now if one assumes the group G to be p–solvable, more can be done. In
[87] Nagao proved that for p–solvable groups Brauer’s k(B)–problem is equivalent
to what henceforth has been called the
k(GV)–problem: If the group G acts faithfully and irreducibly on the ﬁnite
G–module V and if (|G|, |V |) = 1, then the number of conjugacy classes of the
semidirect product GV is bounded above by the order of V , i.e.,
k(GV ) ≤|V |.
This infamous conjecture, as innocent as it looks, has stubbornly resisted at-
tempts to prove it for a very long time and thus over the years has attracted the

320
KELLER
attention of many mathematicians in the ﬁeld.
In 1984, Kn¨orr [66] made the ﬁrst signiﬁcant breakthrough and proved the
k(GV )–conjecture for supersolvable groups. Even more important than this ac-
tual result are the character–theoretic techniques that he developed in his inﬂu-
ential paper to tackle the problem. He showed that if the generalized character
δ(G, V ) =
|V |
|CV (g)| “contains a square”, i.e., if there is a generalized character Θ of
G such that δ ≥|Θ|2 on G and δ ≡Θ (mod p) on G, then this already implies that
k(GV ) ≤|V |. In the same paper he could prove the following:
Theorem 5.1 Suppose that the group G acts faithfully and irreducibly on the ﬁnite
G–module V of coprime characteristic. If there is a v ∈V such that CG(v) is
abelian, then k(GV ) ≤|V |.
In particular, if G has a regular orbit on V , then k(GV ) ≤|V |.
The strength of this amazing result is that it yields the wanted conclusions from
a tiny piece of information, the mere fact that the centralizer of a single v ∈V
is abelian. Also this is the place where the importance of regular orbit theorems
to a solution of the k(GV )–problem becomes obvious, although it remains a little
mysterious as to why things work this nicely as Kn¨orr’s proof is not too intuitive
to the untrained eye. This raises the following
Question: Is there a purely group theoretical proof of Theorem 5.1?
See also Lemma 5.3 below for a weaker “elementary version” of Theorem 5.1.
Most remarkably, all other signiﬁcant contributions to the solution of the k(GV )–
problem are based on Kn¨orr’s results and generalize and extend his approach. Soon
after the above result Kn¨orr (unpublished) and Gluck [32] independently proved the
k(GV )–conjecture in the case of |G| being odd (and thus automatically solvable).
Gow [40] proved the k(GV )–conjecture for self–dual V and Kn¨orr [67] in case of
the existence of a v with V |CG(v) being a permutation module, and Robinson [101]
generalized both results by solving the problem if V |CG(v) is self–dual for some v.
All these eﬀorts ultimately led to the celebrated 1996 paper [103] by Robinson and
Thompson in which they solved the problem if the characteristic p of the underlying
ﬁeld of V is large enough, more precisely, if p > 530. They extend Kn¨orr’s result
by showing the following:
Theorem 5.2 Let G be a group acting faithfully and irreducibly on the ﬁnite G–
module V such that (|G|, |V |) = 1. If there is a v ∈V such that V |CG(v) contains
a faithful and self–dual summand, then k(GV ) ≤|V |.
The proof of this theorem is based on very technical character theoretic argu-
ments. Then the k(GV )–problem is solved by verifying that the hypothesis of the
theorem is satisﬁed if p > 530. For this, the inductive procedure mentioned before

ORBITS IN FINITE GROUP ACTIONS
321
Theorem 4.4 is used, and since the existence of a regular orbit implies the hypoth-
esis of Theorem 5.2, Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 are used to settle the base cases.
Vectors v ∈V such that V |CV (g) contains a self–dual faithful submodule are
sometimes called weakly real, and if V |CG(v) is self–dual, v is called real. So The-
orem 5.2 says that the existence of weakly real vectors implies that k(GV ) ≤|V |.
The point of this is that the existence of weakly real vectors is strong enough to
yield the wanted conclusion k(GV ) ≤|V |, but it is still weak enough to be true
for all GV at least if p is suﬃciently large. And its key property is that unlike
the property k(GV ) ≤|V | it has a good inductive behaviour which makes the in-
ductive proof possible. So it is just about the “right” property to look at. Other
properties like the existence of regular orbits, which also imply k(GV ) ≤|V |, are
too strong and even for large p simply are not always satisﬁed, and correspondingly
their inductive behaviour is not good enough.
Not surprisingly, almost all further work on the k(GV )–problem focussed on
proving the existence of (weakly) real vectors for smaller primes, and in detailed
studies by Robinson [102], Goodwin [37, 38], Gluck and Magaard [35], Koehler
and Pahlings [68], Riese und Schmid [99] and Riese [98] established the existence
of real vectors for all p except for p ∈{3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19, 31}, and if G is solvable,
real vectors exist except for p ∈{3, 5, 7, 13}. So by Theorem 5.2 this solved the
k(GV )–problem for all primes diﬀerent from the exceptional primes. On the other
hand, in general as well as in the solvable case examples exist for each exceptional
prime such that even no weakly real vectors exist. Hence Theorem 5.2 cannot be
used to solve the k(GV )–problem completely in the exceptional cases, and so to
complete the solution of the k(GV )–problem these few primes have to be studied
in a case–by–case analysis. Very recently, Riese and Schmid [100] did this and were
able to give an aﬃrmative answer to the k(GV )–problem for p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 19 and
31. (The case p = 31 had also been solved previously by Gluck and Magaard [36].)
So currently the k(GV )–problem remains open only for p = 5, where Riese and
Schmid obtained k(GV ) ≤

 7
5
n · |V | with n = 1
2 dim(V ), and there is reason for
optimism that this last case will be solved fairly soon as well.
While the results obtained so far are very satisfying, there are two striking as-
pects in the development of the k(GV )–problem.
The ﬁrst one is that there are some beautiful and elementary formulas for k(GV )
in case of coprime action of G on V which are well known and fairly easy to estab-
lish, and each of them can easily be transformed into the other using the Cauchy–
Frobenius orbit counting formula. They are as follows:
If k(U) denotes the number of conjugacy classes for any group U and vi, i =
1, . . . , r(G, V ) (where r(G, V ) is as in Section 2), are representatives of the orbits

322

of G on V , then
(1)
k(GV ) =
r(G,V )

i=1
k(CG(vi)) =

|G|

v∈V
|CG(v)| k(CG(v)).
Alternatively, if gi, i = 1, . . . , k(G) are representatives of the conjugacy classes
of G, then
(2)
k(GV ) =
k(G)

i=1
r(CG(gi), CV (gi)) =
1
|G|

g∈G
|CG(g)| r(CG(g), CV (g)).
These elegant formulas look meaningful and seem to be a key to the solution
of the k(GV )–problem, but surprisingly in the development up to this point they
have hardly been used at all, except for settling easy cases such as G abelian (see
[109]) or more recently in [36] to solve the case p = 31. A closer look at the formu-
las reveals the reason for this. To calculate k(GV ) with one of the formulas, very
detailed information on the group is required, which usually is not available. And
if one estimates the terms in the sums in a trivial way, e.g. k(CG(v)) ≤|G|, then
one clearly exceeds |V |.
We remark, however, that by formula (2) in many general situations, if one
can prove the existence of a regular orbit, there is no need to apply the highly
nontrivial Theorem 5.1 to obtain the conclusion k(GV ) ≤|V |. Namely, as seen
in Section 4, instead of proving the existence of a regular orbit explicitly, most
proofs of regular orbit theorems actually prove the much stronger statement that
	
1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)| < |V |. By slightly modifying the proof (and possibly some parameter
in the hypothesis) the same proof will also yield the slightly stronger result that
	
1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)| <
1
3|V |, and then the following elementary lemma will yield the
wanted conclusion immediately:
Lemma 5.3 Let G > 1 be a group acting faithfully on the ﬁnite G–module V with
(|G|, |V |) = 1 and CV (G) = 1. If
	
1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)| < |G|−1
|G|+1 |V | =

1 −

|G|+1

|V |,
then k(GV ) ≤|V |. In particular, if
	
1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)| < 1
3|V |, then k(GV ) ≤|V |.
Proof By the Cauchy–Frobenius orbit counting formula we know that
r(G, V ) =
1
|G|

g∈G
|CV (g)|,

323
and so with formula (2) we obtain
k(GV )
=

g∈G

|G|
r(CG(g), C(V (g))
=

1̸=g∈G

|CV (g)| + |CG(g)| r(CG(g), CV (g))



Now for all g ∈G we see that
|CV (g)| + |CG(g)| r(CG(g), CV (g)) ≤(|G| + 1) |CV (g)|
and thus with the above and our hypothesis we ﬁnd that
k(GV ) ≤|V |
|G| + |G| + 1
|G|

1̸=g∈G
|CV (g)| ≤|V |
|G| + |G| −1
|G|
|V | = |V |,
as wanted.
2
So the proofs of the regular orbit theorems in Section 4 in case of coprime action
also (almost) show that k(GV ) ≤|V | in these situations in an elementary way. In
this sense Lemma 5.3 can be considered a weak version of Theorem 5.1.
The second curiosity about the k(GV )–problem are Kn¨orr’s intriguing methods
to solve it themselves. In his review of Gow’s paper Gluck called them “powerful,
but rather mysterious” (MR94i: 20020), and they remain quite mysterious – or
miraculous – even today. A more intuitive and “down–to–earth” approach to the
problem is still desirable. For weaker bounds in more general settings see e.g. [78]
and its predecessors [69].
A ﬁrst attempt towards an easier solution to the k(GV )–problem is made in [65]
where a completely new “Kn¨orr–free” approach to the problem is developed which
is far more elementary (albeit still quite technical) and mostly group theoretical. It
is based on the (bad) inductive behaviour of k(GV ) itself and makes extensive use of
formula (1) above. Thus it deals with both curiosities of the history of the problem
mentioned above. In [65] the power of the new approach is demonstrated by solving
the k(GV )–problem for solvable groups and large p. It is hoped that the new ideas
will stimulate further research on the problem. Also, the new approach makes the
fascinating k(GV )–problem accessible to a greater mathematical audience.

Orbits of permutation groups on the power set
In this last section we are concerned with permutation groups on a ﬁnite set Ωand
their action on P(Ω), the power set of Ω. Note that if for A, B ∈P(Ω) we deﬁne
A + B := (A ∪B) −(A ∩B) = (A −B) ∪(B −A),

324
KELLER
then P(Ω) with this addition becomes a GF(2)–module, and thus the action of G
on P(Ω) ﬁts within the framework of this article of studying linear group actions,
and as we will see, it has raised some interest and found important applications
in the past, some of which are related to the previously discussed topics. Clearly
the action of G on the GF(2)–module P(Ω) is faithful, but not irreducible, and
so some of the results of the previous sections also can be applied to this special
action, but often more can be said and proofs tend to be more combinatorial.
As to the number of orbits on P(Ω) , Babai and Pyber proved in [1] the following
Theorem 6.1 Let G be a permutation group on Ωwith |Ω| = n, let t ≥4 and
assume that no composition factor of G is isomorphic to Ak (the alternating group
on k letters) for any k > t. Then
r(G, P(Ω)) ≥a
n
t
for some absolute constant a > 1.
So for solvable groups we have r(G, P(Ω)) ≥a
n
4 which is no surprise in view of
Theorem 2.3. Also, combining this result with logarithmic bounds on the derived
length of a solvable group in terms of its degree (see e.g. [81, Theorem 3.9(a)])
will lead – in analogy to Theorem 2.4 – to a double logarithmic bound for dl(G)
in terms of r(G, P(Ω)). For results on the number of orbits on the k–subsets (i.e.,
subsets of cardinality k) of Ωsee e.g. [111].
We next turn to the question of the number of orbit sizes.
While for solv-
able groups it is not diﬃcult to obtain a logarithmic bound for dl(G) in terms of
n(G, P(Ω)) from Theorem 3.4, it should be possible to obtain such a result with
much better constants and signiﬁcantly less eﬀort directly. A ﬁrst step in this di-
rection is done in [62, Theorems 2.7 and 2.8], where the following general analogue
to Theorem 3.2 is proved:
Theorem 6.2 Let G be a permutation group on the ﬁnite set Ω. Let E  G be
elementary abelian of order pm for a prime p and an integer m ≥9 and suppose
that E acts semi–regularly on Ω(i.e., no element of Ωis ﬁxed by a nontrivial
element of E). Then
n(G, P(Ω)) ≥m −8.
Again, of course, we conjecture that essentially it should be possible to replace E
by an arbitrary p group of class 1 or 2 (and to drop the hypothesis of semi–regular
action). The conjecture is open in general, but has been proved in case that |G| is
odd (and thus solvable) in [63, Theorem 3], using Theorem 6.4 below.
A completely diﬀerent (mostly combinatorial) approach to the problem of orbit
sizes is presented by Mnukhin in [86]:

ORBITS IN FINITE GROUP ACTIONS
325
Theorem 6.3 Let G be a permutation group on the ﬁnite set Ω. If Σ ⊆Ωwith
|Σ| = k ≥2, then there is a ∆⊂Σ with |∆| = k −1 such that
|∆G| ≥
2
k2 |ΣG|
k−1
k .
This result, while very general, is not strong enough to allow conclusions on the
number of distinct orbit sizes. For relations between the orbits on (k −1)–sets and
orbits on k–sets see also Mnukhin’s other work (such as [84] and [85]) or work of
Siemons and Wagner [113].
As is the case for linear groups in general, also in the special case of interest in
this section large orbits are of particular interest, and so this question has been
studied intensely. For solvable groups the best possible answer is [81, Corollary
5.7]:
Theorem 6.4 Let G be a solvable permutation group on the ﬁnite set Ω. Then
there exists a ∆⊆Ωsuch that CG(∆) := {g ∈G
 ∆g = ∆} is a {2, 3}–group. If
|G| is odd, then there exists a regular orbit of G on P(Ω).
This result follows from Gluck’s characterization of primitive solvable permuta-
tion groups with no regular orbit on the power set (see [31]). Seress [107], using the
classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups, took Gluck’s work and other predecessors such
as [10] or [14] further by removing the solvability hypothesis. In particular, with
the exception of Sn, An and some other primitive permutation groups of degree
≤32, every primitive permutation group has a regular orbit on the power set. In
[129] Zhang provides a classiﬁcation of primitive solvable permutation groups that
have fewer than eight orbits on the power set.
Based on Seress’ work, Dolﬁ[19] investigated the action of a permutation group
G on the set Pn(Ω) of ordered partitions (Λ1, . . . , Λn+1) of Ωinto n+1 parts (with
possibly Λi = ∅for some of the i). (Observe that P1(Ω) may be identiﬁed with
P(Ω).) For instance, he classiﬁes the groups that have at most two regular orbits
on P2(Ω) and also the groups that have at most three regular orbits on P4(Ω).
This is used to show that for any permutation group not involving An for all n ≥5
there exists a partition of Ωinto ﬁve subsets such that only the identity stabilizes
each of these sets. For solvable groups, this result had been obtained earlier by
Seress (see [106, Theorem 1.2]), and for primitive solvable groups the result with
“four” instead of “ﬁve” is a consequence of Gluck’s result [31]. An application of
Dolﬁ’s work can be found in [20].
Related to the study of regular orbits is the study of bases. A base for a per-
mutation group on Ωis a subset B ⊆Ωsuch that only the identity ﬁxes all the
elements of B. It is often important to ﬁnd a minimal base, i.e., a base B with |B|
as small as possible. Therefore the size b(G) of a minimal base of the permutation
group G on Ωis an important parameter. It is well–known (and easy to see) that

326
KELLER
2b(G) ≤|G| ≤|Ω|b(G).
Note that if G if a permutation group on Ωwith a base B of size m, this means
that G has a regular orbit on Ωm (= the cartesian product of m copies of Ω). Even
more important for the focus of this section, it means that the setwise stabilizer of
B is a subgroup of Sm, and if m is small, this means that BG is a large (though
usually not regular) orbit of G on P(Ω).
Because of the many applications of minimal bases in various contexts, partic-
ularly computational group theory, they have attracted quite a bit of attention in
recent years, and thus their basic properties as well as recent breakthroughs in this
area have been presented in many places such as [12, Section 4.13], [18, Chapter
3], [13, Section 7], [11, Section 8], [96, Section 3] and [108, Section 5.3]. So to avoid
repetition, we refer the reader to those references and mention only a few results
here.
Seress [106] showed that for solvable primitive permutation groups G always
b(G) ≤4 and even b(G) ≤3 if |G| is odd. This result is crucial to some inductive
arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.4.
Liebeck and Shalev [80], conﬁrming a
conjecture of Cameron, prove that for some constant c, with known exceptions an
almost simple permutation group always has a base of size at most c. In the same
paper they prove:
Theorem 6.5 There is a linear function f : IN →IR such that if G is a primitive
permutation group not involving An, then b(G) ≤f(n).
We ﬁnish this section by mentioning some miscellaneous results. In [112] and
[52] Siemons, Wagner and Inglis discuss how far a primitive permutation group is
determined by its orbits on the power set, and a complete answer is obtained, not
using the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups. Furthermore in [110] it is shown
that if two groups have the same orbits on the k–subsets of Ω, they also have the
same orbits on the (k −1)–subsets of Ω.
This concludes our survey on orbits in ﬁnite group actions. While some classical
problems such as the search for regular orbits have been treated almost exhaustively
by now, it is clear that many other questions in this area are still at the beginning
of their exploration and will provide exciting challenges for the future.

Abstract
Suppose A is an abelian normal subgroup of a ﬁnitely generated group G such that
G/A is abelian and Hi(G, Z) is ﬁnitely generated for all i . We show that A is
of ﬁnite (Pr¨ufer) rank. This generalises the main result of [5] that deals with the
same problem for split extension metabelian groups.

In [5] J. R. J. Groves shows that if G is a ﬁnitely generated group, a split extension
of an abelian group A by an abelian group Q and the homology group Hi(G, Z) is
ﬁnitely generated for all i then A is of ﬁnite rank i.e. A ⊗Z Q is ﬁnite dimensional
over Q and the torsion part of A is ﬁnite. We generalise this result to the non-split
case.
Theorem A Suppose that A is a normal abelian subgroup of a ﬁnitely generated
group G such that G/A is abelian and Hi(G, Fp) is ﬁnite for all i and all primes p.
Then A is of ﬁnite (Pr¨ufer) rank.
Corollary B Suppose that A is a normal abelian subgroup of a ﬁnitely generated
group G such that G/A is abelian and Hi(G, Z) is ﬁnitely generated for all i. Then
A is of ﬁnite (Pr¨ufer) rank.
Our proofs substantially use the method and the main tools from [5]: the geo-
metric invariant for modules over ﬁnitely generated abelian groups deﬁned in [2],
Cartan’s formula for H∗(A, Fp) for abelian groups A and the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp with p
elements (in the case p = 2 the formula holds only for groups A of exponent 2) and
close examination of the LHS spectral sequence in homology. The new ingredients
are a lemma that gives suﬃcient conditions when H0(Q, Hj(A, Fp)) ﬁnite implies
that Hi(Q, Hj(A, Fp)) is ﬁnite for all i ≥0 and a generalisation of Cartan’s formula
for the homologies of abelian groups with trivial coeﬃcients F2. We note that our
proof does not require all the results and techniques from [5], for example we do
not use the results from the sections 4.3 and 5.2 in [5].

Preliminaries on homologies of abelian groups with trivial coef-
ﬁcients and on the geometric invariant for modules over ﬁnitely
generated abelian groups
The geometric invariant ΣA(Q) for a ﬁnitely generated Z[Q]-module A was ﬁrst
deﬁned in [2]. By deﬁnition
ΣA(Q) = {[χ] = R>0χ | χ ∈Hom(Q, R) \ {0}, A is ﬁnitely generated over Z[Qχ]},
Σc
A(Q) = S(Q) \ ΣA(Q)
where Qχ = {g ∈Q | χ(g) ≥0} and S(Q) = {[χ] | χ ∈Hom(Q, R) \ {0}} ≃Sn−1
where n is the torsion-free rank of Q. A is said to be m-tame if every m-point
subset of Σc
A(Q) is contained in an open half subspace of S(Q). One important
property of tameness is that whenever A is m-tame the m-fold tensor power of A
over Z is ﬁnitely generated over Z[Q] via the diagonal Q-action [1, Section 3.5].
Note that in general the converse does not hold but in the case when A is of prime
exponent, m-tameness and the ﬁnite generation (over Z[Q]) of the m-th tensor
power of A are equivalent [1, Thm 3.4].
We discuss now a result of H. Cartan [4] that will play an important role in the
proof of our main theorem. Suppose A is an abelian group. By deﬁnition Sj(pA)
is the set of the elements in the j-th tensor power of pA = {a ∈A | pa = 0} over
Fp which are invariant under the action of the symmetric group on j elements via
permutation of the factors of the j-th tensor power. Note S(pA) = ⊕i≥0 Si(pA) is
a graded algebra with multiplication given by the shuﬄe product ∗of the tensor
algebra of pA i.e.
(a1 ⊗. . . ⊗as) ∗(as+1 ⊗. . . ⊗as+k) =

σ
aσ(1) ⊗. . . ⊗aσ(s+k)
where ai ∈
pA and the sum is over all permutation σ such that σ(1) < σ(2) <
. . . < σ(s) and σ(s + 1) < . . . < σ(s + k).
In general for a commutative ring with unity k and an arbitrary group G the
homology group H∗(G, k) = ⊕i≥0Hi(G, k) does not have multiplicative structure
though the cohomology group H∗(G, k) = ⊕i≥0Hi(G, k) has one via the cup prod-
uct. Still for A abelian there is a Pontryagin product in H∗(A, k) deﬁned as the
composite:
Hi(A, k) × Hj(A, k) α
−→Hi+j(A × A, k)
β
−→Hi+j(A, k)
where α is the homology cross product and β is induced by the multiplication map
A × A →A. With the Pontryagin product H∗(A, k) becomes a strictly anticom-
mutative ring equipped with divided powers, for details see [3, Ch. 5, Section 5].
We remind the reader the axioms of divided powers. There is a family of functions
(i) : H2j(A, k) →H2ij(A, k) for all i ≥0, j ≥1 with the following properties:
1. x(0) = 1, x(1) = x
2. x(i)x(j) =
i+j
i

x(i+j)
3. (x(i))(j) = ei,jx(ij) for all i, j > 0 where ei,j = 

4. (x + y)(i) = 
j+k=i x(j)y(k)
5. For i ≥2
(xy)(i) = xiy(i) whenever x, y are even elements and deg(y) > 0,
(xy)(i) = 0 if x, y are odd elements.
Proposition 2.1 [4, Ch. 9 , Ch. 10] Suppose p is a prime and Fp is the ﬁeld with
p elements.
1. If p is odd
H∗(A, Fp) ≃(∧Fp(A/pA)) ⊗Fp S(pA),
where A/pA has weight 1 and pA has weight 2 i.e.
Hn(A, Fp) ≃⊕0≤k≤[ n
2 ](∧n−2k
Fp
(A/pA)) ⊗Fp Sk(pA).
2. If p = 2 and A is of exponent 2
H∗(A, F2) ≃S(A),
where A has weight 1 i.e.
Hn(A, F2) ≃Sn(A).
In both cases the isomorphism is a natural isomorphism of graded divided powers
algebras i.e. preserves grading, the multiplicative and the divided power structures.
Whenever possible we prefer using homologies with coeﬃcients in Fp rather than
Z. The Pontryagin product gives a natural embedding of the exterior algebra of
H1(A, Z) ≃A in H∗(A, Z) and it is an isomorphism if A is Z-torsion-free [3, Ch. 5,
Thm 6.4]. The problem is that in general this embedding does not naturally split
as in the case of coeﬃcients Fp for p odd. In [6, Thm C] some results linking the
integral homology groups of A and ﬁnite generation (over a commutative ring) of
tensor powers of A are established but they are not directly applicable to the proof
of Theorem A.

More on the homology with coeﬃcients in F2
In [3, Thm 6.6] it is stated that there is a non-natural isomorphism
H∗(A, F2) ≃∧(A/2A) ⊗S(2A)
(1)
and that the above isomorphism could be proved as in the proof of [3, Thm 6.4].
The generating space 2A = {a ∈A | 2a = 0} of the symmetric algebra comes from
a non-natural splitting of the exact sequence
0 →∧2(A/2A) →H2(A, F2) →
2A →0.
Still it is not made clear in [3] how to combine the non-naturality of (1) with the
ideas of the proof of [3, Thm 6.4] that deals with a natural description of homology
groups.

GROUPS WITH FINITELY GENERATED INTEGRAL HOMOLOGIES

In this section we show how such an isomorphism could be proved and in fact
we give a natural description of H∗(A, F2) = ⊕i≥0Hi(A, F2) in terms of a ﬁltration
with quotients isomorphic to the direct summands of (1). Naturality is important
for two purposes. First it is needed in the proof of the fact that the ﬁltration is
exhausting. Secondly in the applications considered in this paper A is endowed with
the structure of a Z[Q]-module and we are interested not only in the underlying
additive structure of the homology H∗(A, F2) but in its structure as Z[Q]-module.
As before H∗(A, F2) is equipped with strictly anticommutative Pontryagin product
and divided power structure.
Note that
H1(A, F2) ≃A/2A,
and by the exact universal coeﬃcient sequence
0 →H2(A, Z) ⊗F2 →H2(A, F2) →TorZ
1 (H1(A, Z), F2) →0.
As H2(A, Z) ≃∧2A and TorZ
1 (H1(A, Z), F2) ≃
2A = {a ∈A | 2a = 0} we have
H2(A, F2)
∧2H1(A, F2) ≃
2A.
Theorem 3.1 Let
F i(H∗(A, F2)) =

k≥0,j1+...+jt≤i
H1(A, F2)kH2(A, F2)(j1) . . . H2(A, F2)(jt),
where H2(A, F2)(j) is the subspace spanned by all elements λ(j) for λ ∈H2(A, F2).
Then ∪i≥1F i(H∗(A, F2)) is an exhausting ﬁltration of the graded algebra H∗(A, F2)
with quotients
F i(H∗(A, F2))/F i−1(H∗(A, F2)) ≃∧(A/2A) ⊗Si(2A).
(2)
Proof Note that to prove that the ﬁltration is exhausting i.e.
∪i≥1F i(H∗(A, F2)) = H∗(A, F2)
(3)
and that (2) holds it is suﬃcient to consider the following cases:
1. A is cyclic;
2. if (2) and (3) hold for the ﬁnitely generated abelian groups A1 and A2 then
(2) and (3) hold for A = A1 ⊕A2;
Then (2) and (3) hold for all ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. Finally as every
group A is the direct limit of its ﬁnitely generated subgroups and our ﬁltration
commutes with direct limits both (2) and (3) hold in general. In more details if
A = lim

2. by the deﬁnition of Pontryagin product, the fact that homology commutes

H2(Ai, F2)(jt)) ≃
H1(A, F2)kH2(A, F2)(j1) . . . H2(A, F2)(jt).
Now we show that (2) and (3) hold for A cyclic. If A is inﬁnite then Hi(A, F2) = 0
for all i ≥2 and there is nothing to prove. Now let A be cyclic of order m. Consider
the free resolution F of the trivial module Z over Z[A]
F : . . . →Z[A]en
∂n
−→Z[A]en−1
∂n−1

−→Z[A]e0
ϵ
−→Z →0
with ∂n being multiplication with 1 + t + . . . + tm−1 for n odd and multiplication
with t −1 for n even.
The Pontryagin product in H∗(A, F2) is induced by an
admissible product in F i.e. product satisfying the following
ϵ(xy) = ϵ(x)ϵ(y) and ∂(xy) = ∂(x)y + (−1)degxx∂(y).
By [3, p.119] we have
e2i = ei
2/i! , e2ie2j = (i, j)e2i+2j , e2ie2j+1 = (i, j)e2i+2j+1 , e2i+1e2j+1 = 0
For m odd, i ≥1 the homology group Hi(A, F2) has exponent dividing 2 and m,
hence is zero. If m is even F2 ⊗Z[A] F has trivial diﬀerentials and H∗(A, F2) =
H∗(F2 ⊗Z[A] F) = (∧F2e1) ⊗F2 ΓF2(e2), where ΓF2(e2) is the divided polynomial
algebra over F2 as deﬁned in [3, p.119]. Then H1(A, F2) = F2e1, H2(A, F2) = F2e2,
H2(A, F2)(j) = F2e(j)
2
= F2e2j and
F i(H∗(A, F2)) =

k≥0,j1+...+jt≤i
H1(A, F2)kH2(A, F2)(j1) . . . H2(A, F2)(jt) =

ϵ=0,1;j1+...+jt≤i
F2eϵ
1e2j1 . . . e2jt =

j≤2i+1
F2ej,
the latter equality holds as e1e2i = e2i+1 and eϵ
1e2j1 . . . e2jt = λeϵ+2j1+...+2jt for
λ ∈F2. Thus (3) follows immediately.
Finally for A cyclic of even order m we have Si(2A) = Si(F2) =⊗i F2 ≃
F2 ≃F2e2i and F (i)(H∗(A, F2))/F (i−1)(H∗(A, F2)) ≃
2i≤j≤2i+1 F2ej = F2e2i ⊕
F2e1e2i = (F2 ⊕F2e1).F2e2i ≃(∧A/2A) ⊗Si(2A). In particular (2) holds.

Now we prove that the ﬁltration is exhausting for A = A1 ⊕A2 provided the
same holds for A1 and A2. Consider the commutative diagram
(∪i≥1F i(H∗(A1, F2))) ⊗(∪i≥1F i(H∗(A2, F2)))

H∗(A, F2)
The maps α1, α2 and α are the obvious inclusions. By assumptions α1 and α2
are isomorphisms. The map
βi : ∪s≥1F s(H∗(Ai, F2)) →∪s≥1F s(H∗(A, F2))
is induced by the maps
Hj(Ai, F2) →Hj(A, F2)
for j = 1, 2 both given by the inclusion of Ai in A. The map ϕ is the inclusion given
by the K¨unneth formula and as F2 is a ﬁeld ϕ is an isomorphism. Then ϕ(α1 ⊗α2)
is an isomorphism and hence α is surjective. By construction α is injective and so
α is an isomorphism, as required. Then β1 ⊗β2 is an isomorphism too.
Claim (β1 ⊗β2)(
i+k=m F i(H∗(A1, F2)) ⊗F k(H∗(A2, F2))) = F m(H∗(A, F2))
Proof Assume x1, y1 are elements of degree one and x2, y2 are elements of degree
two. Then by the axioms of divided powers for j ≥2 the element (x2+y2+x1y1)(j)
equals

α1+α2+α3=j
x(α1)

This together with the K¨unneth formula
H2(A, F2) ≃⊕0≤i≤2Hi(A1, F2) ⊗H2−i(A2, F2)
implies that H2(A, F2)(j) is a subset of

j1=0,1;j0+j1+j2=j
H2(A1, F2)(j0)H1(A1, F2)j1H1(A2, F2)j1H2(A2, F2)(j2)
⊆∧H1(A, F2)

j0+j2≤j
H2(A1, F2)(j0)H2(A2, F2)(j2) ⊆H∗(A, F2).
This together with the deﬁnition of the ﬁltration implies
F m(H∗(A, F2)) ⊆(β1 ⊗β2)(

i+k=m
F i(H∗(A1, F2)) ⊗F k(H∗(A2, F2))).
The inverse inclusion is obvious.

By the claim and the fact that β1 ⊗β2 is an isomorphism we have
F m(H∗(A, F2))/F m−1(H∗(A, F2)) ≃
⊕i+k=mF i(H∗(A1, F2))/F i−1(H∗(A1, F2)) ⊗F k(H∗(A1, F2))/F k−1(H∗(A1, F2)).
By assumption
F i(H∗(A1, F2))/F i−1(H∗(A1, F2)) ≃∧(A1/2A1) ⊗Si(2(A1)),
F m−i(H∗(A1, F2))/F m−i−1(H∗(A1, F2)) ≃∧(A2/2A2) ⊗Sm−i(2(A2)).
Furthermore
∧(A1/2A1) ⊗∧(A2/2A2) ≃∧((A1/2A1) ⊕(A2/2A2)) = ∧(A/2A).
Finally it remains to note that for abelian groups M and N of exponent 2
⊕0≤i≤m(Si(M) ⊗Sm−i(N)) ≃Sm(M ⊕N)
and apply this for M =
2(A1), N =
2(A2), M ⊕N ≃
2A = {a ∈A | 2a = 0} to
obtain the required isomorphism
F m(H∗(A, F2))/F m−1(H∗(A, F2)) ≃(∧(A/2A)) ⊗Sm(2A).
The formula about M and N could be veriﬁed either by hand or by Proposition
2.1 (remember both M and N have exponent 2) it is transformed to a special case
of the K¨unneth formula
H∗(M, F2) ⊗H∗(N, F2) ≃H∗(M ⊕N, F2).
This completes the proof of the theorem.
2
To illustrate the above theorem we consider the case when A has exponent 2.
By Proposition 2.1
H∗(A, F2) ≃S(A).
Any symmetric element of ⊗iA is a linear combination of elements of the form
(a⊗k1

for some s ≤i, some pairwise diﬀerent elements a1, . . . , as of A where  kj = i
and ∗is the shuﬄe product. The Pontryagin product is the shuﬄe product ∗and
the divided power structure is given by
(a ⊗a)(i) = a⊗2i.
Then
a⊗k = aϵ ∗(a ⊗a)([k/2]) ∈H1(A, F2)ϵH2(A, F2)([k/2]),
where ϵ = k −2[k/2] and the element (a⊗k1

(∧H1(A, F2))H2(A, F2)([ k1

Thus
F j(H∗(A, F2)) ∩Si(A) =

Some results about homology
Lemma 4.1 Suppose Q is a ﬁnitely generated abelian group, B is a left Z[Q]-
module equipped with a ﬁnite ﬁltration of Z[Q]-submodules
B = B1 ⊃B2 ⊃. . . ⊃Bk ⊃Bk+1 = 0
such that Bj/Bj+1 is a cyclic Rj-module for some commutative Noetherian ring
Rj, Q embeds in Rj and the action of Q on Bj/Bj+1 via the embedding of Q in Rj
is the original action of Q. Suppose further that H0(Q, B) is ﬁnite. Then Hi(Q, B)
is ﬁnite for all i.
Proof To prove the lemma we induct on the length k of the ﬁltration. Assume
ﬁrst that k = 1 and so B is a cyclic R1-module and a commutative Noetherian
ring. Let F be a resolution of the trivial right module Z over Z[Q] with all modules
ﬁnitely generated. Consider the complex F ⊗Z[Q] B. Its modules could be viewed
as (right) B-modules via the multiplication in B. Note this B-action is compatible
with the diﬀerentials because B is commutative. As B is a Noetherian ring and all
modules in F ⊗Z[Q] B are ﬁnitely generated over B we deduce that all homology
groups
Hi(F ⊗Z[Q] B) ≃Hi(Q, B)
are ﬁnitely generated B-modules.
Furthermore the action of Q on Hi(Q, B) is
trivial and so Hi(Q, B) is a ﬁnitely generated module over Z ⊗Z[Q] B ≃H0(Q, B).
As by assumption H0(Q, B) is ﬁnite we are done.
If k ≥2 consider the short exact sequence of modules
0 →B2 →B →B/B2 →0.
It induces a long exact sequence in homology
. . . →Hi(Q, B2) →Hi(Q, B) →Hi(Q, B/B2) →. . .
→H1(Q, B/B2) →H0(Q, B2) →H0(Q, B) →H0(Q, B/B2) →0
As H0(Q, B) is ﬁnite H0(Q, B/B2) is ﬁnite and by induction Hi(Q, B/B2) is ﬁnite
for all i. In particular H1(Q, B/B2) is ﬁnite and hence H0(Q, B2) is ﬁnite. Again
by induction Hi(Q, B2) is ﬁnite for all i and using the long exact sequence we see
that Hi(Q, B) is ﬁnite for all i, as required.

Lemma 4.2 Suppose A is a ﬁnitely generated Z[Q]-module and for some prime p
and some j the homology group H0(Q, Hj(A, Fp)) is ﬁnite. Then Hi(Q, Hj(A, Fp))
is ﬁnite for all i.
Proof By Proposition 2.1 (for p odd) and Theorem 3.1 (for p = 2) there is a
ﬁltration of Hj(A, Fp) with quotients isomorphic to some Bα,β = ∧α(A/pA) ⊗
Sβ(pA) for α + 2β = j, α ≥0, β ≥0 and the action of Q on Hj(A, Fp) corresponds

340
KOCHLOUKOVA
to the diagonal action of Q on Bα,β. Note that Bα,β is a module over Πα ⊗Πβ,
where Πk is the invariant subring of Fp[Qk] under the action of the symmetric group
Sk that permutes the factors of Qk. The Fp-algebra Πk is ﬁnitely generated and
contains the diagonal subgroup of Qk. Then Πα ⊗Πβ is a Noetherian commutative
ring containing the diagonal subgroup of Qα+β. Finally it remains to prove that
Bα,β is ﬁnitely generated over Πα ⊗Πβ and then apply the previous lemma.
Note that ⊗kC for C = A/pA or pA is ﬁnitely generated module over Fp[Qk].
As every element f of Qk is a root of the polynomial 
σ∈Sk(x −σ(f)) ∈Πk[x] we
see that f is integral over Πk. Furthermore Fp[Qk] is a ﬁnitely generated algebra
and so Fp[Qk] is ﬁnitely generated as Πk-module. Thus ⊗kC is ﬁnitely generated
over Πk and hence Bα,β is ﬁnitely generated over Πα ⊗Πβ.

Proposition 4.3 Suppose some extension G of A by Q is ﬁnitely generated, p is
a prime and Ht(G, Fp) is ﬁnite for all t. Then Hi(Q, Ht(A, Fp)) is ﬁnite for all t
and all i.
Proof We prove the proposition by induction on t. The case t = 1 is very easy, as
H1(A, Fp) ≃A/pA and A is ﬁnitely generated over Z[Q]. Thus H0(Q, H1(A, Fp))
is ﬁnite. By Lemma 4.2 Hi(Q, H1(A, Fp)) is ﬁnite for all i.
For the inductive step assume Hi(Q, Hj(A, Fp)) is ﬁnite for all 0 ≤j ≤t−1 and
all i ≥0 and consider the ﬁrst quadrant Lyndon-Hochshild-Serre spectral sequence
for the trivial module Fp
E2
i,j = Hi(Q, Hj(A, Fp))
with diﬀerentials
dr : Er
i,j →Er
i−r,j+r−1
By induction E2
i,k is ﬁnite for 0 ≤k ≤t −1 and all i ≥0. This together with the
fact that dr has bidegree (−r, r −1) and our spectral sequence is a ﬁrst quadrant
spectral sequence, in particular E∞
0,t = Et+2
0,t , implies that
1. Es
i,k is ﬁnite for all s ≥2, 0 ≤k ≤t −1 and i ≥0;
2. E∞
0,t is ﬁnite if and only if E2
0,t is ﬁnite.
At the same time since Hi+j(G, Fp) is ﬁnite we have that E∞
i,j is ﬁnite for every
i, j. Thus E2
0,t = H0(Q, Ht(A, Fp)) is ﬁnite. Finally by Lemma 4.2 Hi(Q, Ht(A, Fp))
is ﬁnite for all i.

Proof of Theorem A
Assume that A is not of ﬁnite rank. By [5, Section 3.1] there exists a prime number p
such that A/pA is inﬁnite and A has an epimorphic image B which is a just-inﬁnite
Fp[Q]-module of exponent p. Let M be a non-trivial cyclic Fp[Q]-submodule of B
and A1 be the preimage of M in A. Then M is a just-inﬁnite cyclic Fp[Q]-module
of exponent p and A1 has ﬁnite index in A.

Lemma 5.1 There exists a normal subgroup G1 of ﬁnite index in G such that
G1 ∩A = A1. In particular Hi(G1, Fp) is ﬁnite for all i and all primes p.
Proof 1. Let π : Q →G be a section. Then G1 = A1π(Qm) is a normal subgroup
of ﬁnite index in G if [π(Qm), π(Q)] ⊆{qm−1 + qm−2 + . . . + 1 | q ∈Q}A ⊆A1.
Note that as A/A1 is ﬁnite there is m as above.
2. As G/G1 is metabelian, ﬁnite we can use induction on the order of G/G1
to show that Hi(G1, Fp) is ﬁnite and restrict to the case when G/G1 is cyclic of
prime order q. If q = p by [5, Prop.2.3] Hj(G, Fp) is ﬁnite for all j. Suppose q ̸= p.
Consider the LHS spectral sequence E2
i,j = Hi(G/G1, Hj(G1, Fp)) converging to
Hi+j(G, Fp).
For i ≥1 the exponent of E2
i,j divides p and q, hence E2
i,j = 0.
Then the spectral sequence collapses and induces an isomorphism Hj(G1, Fp) ≃
Hj(G, Fp).

Lemma 5.2 For p odd H0(Q, ∧iM) is ﬁnite for all i and for p = 2 the image of
H0(Q, ∧iM) in H0(Q, Hi(M, F2)) ≃H0(Q, Si(M)) is ﬁnite for all i.
Proof Let G1 be the group given by the previous lemma and Q1 = G1/A1. By
Lemma 5.1 Hi(G1, Fp) is ﬁnite for all i and all prime p. Hence by Proposition 4.3
H0(Q1, Hi(A1, Fp)) is ﬁnite for all p.
We consider ﬁrst the case p odd.
Indeed by Proposition 2.1 ∧i
Fp(A1/pA1) is
a direct summand of Hi(A1, Fp).
Thus the embedding of the exterior algebra
of H1(A1, Fp) ≃A1/pA1 in H∗(A1, Fp) is natural and split and compatible with
the multiplicative structure on the strictly anticommutative algebra H∗(A1, Fp).
Hence the action of Q1 on the homology group induces on the exterior algebra of
A1/pA1 the diagonal Q1-action. Then Fp⊗Fp[Q1](∧i(A1/pA1)) embeds in Fp⊗Fp[Q1]
Hi(A1, Fp). As Fp ⊗Fp[Q1] Hi(A1, Fp) is ﬁnite Fp ⊗Fp[Q1] (∧i(A1/pA1)) is ﬁnite. As
M is a surjective image of A1/pA1 we deduce that H0(Q, ∧iM) is ﬁnite.
If p = 2 consider the commutative diagram

Q and the columns are induced by the inclusions ∧iH1(C, F2) →Hi(C, F2) for
C = A1 and C = M, where wedging corresponds to the Pontryagin product. As
H0(Q, Hi(A, F2)) is ﬁnite α1 has ﬁnite image. The commutativity of the above
diagram together with the surjectivity of ϕ1 and ϕ2 imply that the image of α3 is
ﬁnite, as required.

From now on we will forget the existence of the group G and will deal only with just
-inﬁnite cyclic Z[Q]-modules M of additive exponent p with the property that for
p odd Fp ⊗Fp[Q] (∧i
ZM) is ﬁnite for all i and for p = 2 the image of F2 ⊗F2[Q] (∧i
ZM)
in F2 ⊗F2[Q] Si(M) is ﬁnite for all i. By [5, Section 5.2] there exists a series

of multiplicative subgroups of the ﬁeld of fractions K of M and a series
M = M0 ⊆M1 ⊆. . . ⊆Mt
of additive subgroups of K deﬁned by Mi = QiM with the following properties:
1. Qi+1 = Qi× < αi >;
2. there exists ri ∈Z[Qi] with (ri −αi)Mi+1 = 0;
3. Mi is fully tame for i ≥1 i.e. Mi is ni-tame as a module over Fp[Qi] where
ni is the torsion free rank of Qi.
4. The centraliser CQi(Mi) of Mi in Qi is the same as CQ0(M0).
Lemma 5.3 If p is odd and Fp ⊗Z[Qi] (∧jMi) is ﬁnite then Fp ⊗Z[Qi+1] (∧jMi+1)
is ﬁnite.
If p = 2 and the image of F2 ⊗F2[Q] (∧j
ZMi) in F2 ⊗F2[Q] Sj(Mi) is ﬁnite then the
image of F2 ⊗F2[Q] (∧j
ZMi+1) in F2 ⊗F2[Q] Sj(Mi+1) is ﬁnite.
Proof First let p be odd. Suppose f1, . . . , fs are elements of ∧j
FpMi such that
∧j
FpMi = Fpf1 + . . . + Fpfs + Aug(Fp[Qi])(∧j
FpMi),
where Aug denotes the augmentation ideal. We claim that
∧j
FpMi+1 = Fpf1 + . . . + Fpfs + Aug(Fp[Qi+1])(∧j
FpMi+1).
Let f be an element from ∧j
FpMi+1. By the construction of Mi+1 for some large
positive integer β we have αβ
i f ∈∧j
FpMi. Then
αβ
i f = z1f1 + . . . + zsfs + w
where zi ∈Fp and w ∈Aug(Fp[Qi])(∧jMi) and hence
f = α−β
i
(z1f1 + . . . + zsfs + w) ∈z1f1 + . . . + zsfs + Aug(Fp[Qi+1])(∧j

as required.
If p = 2 consider the commutative diagram
ϕi : ∧j

↓
ϕi+1 : ∧j
F2Mi+1
→
Sj(Mi+1)
where ϕi is the natural inclusion of ∧jH1(Mi, F2) in Hj(Mi, F2), the column maps
are induced by the inclusion of Mi in Mi+1. Since the image of F2 ⊗F2[Qi] ∧j
F2Mi
in F2 ⊗F2[Qi] Sj(Mi) is ﬁnite there exist elements f1, . . . , fs ∈∧j
F2Mi such that
ϕi(∧j
F2Mi) ⊆ϕi(F2f1 + . . . + F2fs) + Aug(Z[Qi])(Sj(Mi)).
An obvious modiﬁcation of the ﬁrst part of the proof gives
ϕi+1(∧j
F2Mi+1) ⊆ϕi+1(F2f1 + . . . + F2fs) + Aug(F2[Qi+1])(Sj(Mi+1))
and hence the image of F2 ⊗F2[Qi+1] ∧j
F2Mi+1 in F2 ⊗F2[Qi+1] Sj(Mi+1) is ﬁnite. 2

Thus to prove the main theorem it is suﬃcient to work with M = Mt and
Q = Qt/CQt(Mt), so we can assume that
1. M is a cyclic Fp[Q]-module and Q acts faithfully on M. Note we have dropped
the assertion that M is just-inﬁnite;
2. M is n-tame where n is the torsion free rank of Q;
3. As t could be chosen arbitrary large we can assume that n + 1 is a multiple
of the order of the torsion part of Q.
4. If p is odd Fp⊗Fp[Q]∧jM is ﬁnite for all j. If p = 2 the image of F2⊗F2[Q](∧j
ZM)
in F2 ⊗F2[Q] Sj(M) is ﬁnite for all j.
Then by [5, Proposition 4.3] conditions 1,2 and 3 imply Fp ⊗Fp[Q] (⊗n+1
Fp M) is
inﬁnite. At the same time as shown in [5, Section 5.4] the fourth property of M
together with the n-tameness of M implies that Fp ⊗Fp[Q] (⊗n+1
Fp M) is ﬁnite, a
contradiction.

Proof of Corollary B
For p prime consider the short exact sequence
0 →Hi(G, Z) ⊗Z Fp →Hi(G, Fp) →TorZ
1 (Hi−1(G, Z), Fp) →0
given by the universal coeﬃcients theorem. Note that TorZ
1 (Hi−1(G, Z), Fp) = {λ ∈
Hi−1(G, Z) | pλ = 0}. Then whenever Hi(G, Z) and Hi−1(G, Z) are ﬁnitely gener-
ated the homology group Hi(G, Fp) is ﬁnite. Now Corollary B follows immediately
from Theorem A.

Introduction
The ﬁrst geometric invariant of groups was introduced by R. Bieri and R. Strebel
for the special class of ﬁnitely generated metabelian groups [20]. Their work was
motivated by an earlier result that every ﬁnitely presented soluble group with inﬁ-
nite cyclic quotient is an ascending HNN-extension with stable letter corresponding
to a generator of the cyclic quotient and a ﬁnitely generated base [22]. It turned out
that the new geometric invariant classiﬁes the ﬁnitely presented groups in the class
of all ﬁnitely generated metabelian groups [20]. Later on the deﬁnition of Bieri-
Strebel was generalised for any ﬁnitely generated discrete group [18] and higher
dimensional homological and homotopical analogues of this invariant were intro-
duced by R. Bieri and B. Renz [19], [64]. We will discuss the precise deﬁnitions
of these invariants in the following section. They are important as they determine
the homological and homotopical types FPm and Fm of subgroups containing the
derived subgroup.
In general the geometric invariants are very hard to compute and there are very
few cases when they are calculated. One of them is the class of right angled Artin
groups [48] which gave the ﬁrst known examples of groups of type FP∞which are
not ﬁnitely presented [7]. Even in the class of metabelian groups the structure
of the geometric invariants is not completely understood.
There are two open
conjectures in the metabelian case: the FPm-Conjecture and the Σm-Conjecture.
Both are known to hold in small dimensions m = 2 [20], [16] and m = 3 when the
metabelian group in consideration is a split extension of abelian groups [42], [43].
It is somewhat surprising that even the case of metabelian groups presents such
diﬃculties.
It is interesting to note that the few successful calculations of the geometric
invariants completed by now are achieved by using mixtures of geometric with
algebraic techniques. It is quite often in this subject that the existence of a complex
with higher connectivity on which a group G acts with ”small” stabilizers and
cocompactly that gives methods for calculating the homotopy type of the groups
and its geometric invariants [25], [44], [4]. The only known construction of such a
complex in the metabelian case that works in every dimension (at the expense of
considering a special class of metabelian groups) depends on valuation trees and
valuation theoretic properties of commutative rings [4], [56].

Recently questions about the homological types of pro-p groups and Lie algebras
have been addressed in [30], [31],[51].
A characterisation of these types in the
metabelian case (in the spirit of the FPm-Conjecture) has been obtained in [57],[58]
(with the restriction in the Lie case that the considered Lie algebra is a split
extension of abelian Lie algebras), though the similar question for discrete groups
is still open. It is interesting to note that with few exceptions [32],[65] nothing
is known outside the metabelian case. The basic problem is that in the case of
metabelian Lie algebras and metabelian pro-p groups the invariants are deﬁned in
pure algebraic terms and their properties are consequences of valuation theoretic
arguments. The absence of geometric methods makes it diﬃcult to obtain results
beyond the metabelian case. Furthermore in the pro-p and Lie cases [65] the HNN-
construction does not play a vital role in the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite presentability,
contrary to the situation in the discrete case.
This essay is written with very few proofs, its aim is to give an overview of
the recent developments in the subject, especially the links via valuation theory
of the theory of discrete groups with the pro-p and Lie theory. In the last section
we discuss brieﬂy some aspects of the geometric invariants and the homological
ﬁniteness properties in the discrete case that could not get a place in the main
body of the paper due to lenght restrains.

Deﬁnitions of the geometric invariants and basic properties
Everywhere in sections 2-5 G will denote a ﬁnitely generated discrete group. For
any such group the set Hom(G, R) of the real characters of G is an abelian group
isomorphic to Rn, where n is the torsion-free rank of the abelianization of G. Two
non-trivial characters χ1 and χ2 are equivalent if they are obtained one from the
other by multiplication with a positive real number. The class R>0χ of a non-zero
character χ is denoted by [χ] and the set of all [χ] equivalence classes
S(G) = {[χ] | χ ∈Hom(G, R) \ {0}}
is identiﬁed with the unit sphere Sn−1 in Rn ≃Hom(G, R).
By deﬁnition a group G is of type FPm if there is a projective resolution (over
Z[G]) of the trivial module Z with all terms in dimension ≤m ﬁnitely generated.
For a Z[G]-module A we say that it has the homological type FPm if there is a
projective resolution of A with ﬁnitely generated modules in all dimensions ≤m.
Finally we are ready to deﬁne the homological geometric invariants Σm(G, A) for
a ﬁnitely generated Z[G]-module A. The case A = Z plays a special role in the
theory.
Σm(G, A) = {[χ] | A is of homological type FPm over Z[Gχ]},
Σm(G, A)c = S(G) \ Σm(G, A)
where Gχ≥d is the set {g | χ(g) ≥d} and Gχ is the monoid Gχ≥0.
The homological geometric invariants {Σm(G, Z)}m≥1 have homotopical coun-
terparts {Σm(G)}m≥1. The homotopical invariant Σm(G) is deﬁned only for groups

G of type Fm i.e. groups for which there is a K(G, 1)-complex Y with ﬁnite m-
skeleton. Note that the universal cover Y of Y is (m −1)-connected and G acts
cocompactly and freely on its m-skeleton. A continuous function h : Y →R is
called a χ-equivariant height function if h(vg) = h(v) + χ(g) for every point in
Y .
In case the restriction of h on every cell of Y attains its extremes on the
boundary of the cell the height function is called regular. The maximal subcom-
plex of h−1[d, +∞) is denoted by Yh≥d. By deﬁnition Σm(G) contains all classes
[χ] ∈S(G) for which there is a K(G, 1)-complex Y (depending on χ) and a χ-
equivariant height function h : Y →R such that Yh≥0 is (m −1)-connected. By
deﬁnition Σm(G)c = S(G) \ Σm(G).
There is an equivalent deﬁnition for the geometric invariant Σm(G). Consider a
ﬁxed K(G, 1)-complex Y with ﬁnite m-skeleton and its universal cover Y together
with a χ-equivariant height function h : Y →R. Then [χ] ∈Σm(G) if and only
if Yh≥0 is essentially (m −1)-connected, i.e.
exists d < 0 such that the maps
πi(Yh≥0) →πi(Yh≥d) given by inclusion are trivial for all i ≤m−1. The equivalence
between both deﬁnitions is discussed in [44, Sec.2]
At ﬁrst sight the deﬁnitions of the geometric homological invariants for A = Z
look quite diﬀerent from the deﬁnition of the geometric homotopical invariant but
this impression is false. There is a strong link between Σm(G) and Σm(G, Z) in
the way the homology and homotopy groups are related. Though the homological
invariant Σm(G, Z) is deﬁned for any ﬁnitely generated group G (this is group of
type F1) if Σm(G, Z) is non-empty then the group G is of homological type FPm
(see Lemma 5.2).
Suppose there is a (m−1)–acyclic complex X on which G acts freely and cocom-
pactly. Then [χ] ∈Σm(G, Z) if and only if for some χ-equivariant height function
h : X →R the complex Xh≥0 is essentially (m −1)-acyclic, i.e. exists d < 0 such
that the maps Hi(Yh≥0) →Hi(Yh≥d) given by inclusion are trivial for all i ≤m−1.
This gives the inclusion Σm(G) ⊆Σm(G, Z) for groups G of type Fm. A Hurewicz
type argument gives immediately
Σm(G) = Σm(G, Z) ∩Σ2(G)
for groups of type Fm and m ≥2.
Thus every problem about the geometric
invariant in dimension m ≥3 can always be reduced to its homological version
provided we know the homotopical counterpart of the problem in dimension 2.
In general the structure of the invariants can be very complicated. We state
some of the few results that hold for arbitrary group (provided that the invariant
in consideration is well-deﬁned).
Theorem 2.1 [19, Thm A and Sec.6.5] For any ﬁnitely generated group G and
any Z[G]-module A the geometric homological invariant Σm(G, A) is open in S(G).
Furthermore if G is of type Fm then Σm(G) is open in S(G).
Theorem 2.2 [19, Thm B and Sec. 6.5] Suppose G is a group of type FPm (type
Fm) and H is a subgroup of G containing the derived subgroup. Then H is of type

FPm (type Fm) if and only if
{[χ] | χ(H) = 0} ⊆Σm(G, Z) (resp. Σm(G)).

Groups acting on spaces
One of the main criteria for groups of type Fm and FPm is due to K. Brown. It
characterises the homological and homotopical types of a group via its action on a
space. In fact in [25, Thm 4] only the case of groups of type F2 (ﬁnitely presented)
is considered, the general theorem is obvious corollary of the homological part of
the theorem plus the fact that a group is of type Fm if and only if it is of type FPm
and is ﬁnitely presented.
Theorem 3.1 [25, Thm 4] [27, Prop. 1.1] Suppose G is a ﬁnitely generated group
acting on a complex X via permutation of the cells and such that X is (m −1)-
connected (acyclic), the stabilizer of any i-dimensional cell is of type Fm−i (resp.
FPm−i) and G acts cocompactly on X. Then G is of homotopical type Fm (homo-
logical type FPm).
Thus Brown’s criterion reduces the problem of ﬁnding the homotopical and ho-
mological type of a group to the construction of an appropriate complex.
The
problem is that it is really diﬃcult to ﬁnd such complexes. For ﬁnitely generated
metabelian groups G there are two outstanding conjectures that suggest when the
group is of type FPm and how to calculate Σm(G, Z).
The FPm-Conjecture A ﬁnitely generated metabelian group is of type FPm if
and only if every subset of Σ1(G)c with at most m points lies in an open hemisphere
of S(G). The latter geometric condition is called m-tameness.
The characterisation of the ﬁnitely presented metabelian groups, given in [20],
implies that metabelian groups of type FP2 are always ﬁnitely presented, i.e. F2.
This, together with the fact that a group is Fm if and only if it is FPm and ﬁnitely
presented, implies that for metabelian groups type Fm is equivalent to type FPm.
In general, this is false [7] though it is not known whether there are examples of
soluble groups of type FP2 that are not ﬁnitely presented.
The Σm-Conjecture For a ﬁnitely generated metabelian group G of type FPm
both invariants Σm(G)c and Σm(G, Z)c coincide and are equal to
[conv≤m(R>0Σ1(G)c)] = {[χ] | χ = χ1 + . . . + χm where all [χj] ∈Σ1(G)c}.
In [4] a special insight into the case of metabelian groups G of ﬁnite Pr¨ufer rank
(i.e. groups where there is an upper bound on the number of the generators for
the ﬁnitely generated subgroups) is achieved by constructing a special subcomplex
X of a ﬁnite product of trees such that G acts cocompactly on X with polycyclic
stabilizers. It turns out that if any m points in Σ1(G)c lie in an open hemisphere of
S(G) then the space X is (m−1)-connected. This combined with the above criterion

348
KOCHLOUKOVA
shows one of the directions of the FPm-Conjecture for metabelian groups of ﬁnite
Pr¨ufer rank. Later in [56] the same idea was used to prove the torsion version of
˚Aberg’s result. More precisely, suppose G is an extension 1 →A →G →Q →1
with G ﬁnitely generated, A and Q abelian such that A is torsion as abelian group
and of Krull dimension 1 as a module over Z[Q] (via conjugation). Then there
exists an ˚Aberg’s type complex with all properties described in the original ˚Aberg’s
construction. The starting point in adapting ˚Aberg’s approach for this new class of
groups is the consideration of a (very general) construction of a tree associated to a
character χ whose class [χ] is in Σ1(G)c [21, Sect.II.2.5, Sect.II.4.3] (unfortunately
[21] is not accessible by a general reader, but good places to learn about the link
between Σ1(G) and the actions of G on a tree are [38] and [28]). In the class of
groups G described above, Σ1(G)c has only ﬁnitely many points and this gives
ﬁnitely many trees on which G acts.
Then a subcomplex X of the product of
these trees can be deﬁned following ˚Aberg’s recipe. Although the ˚Aberg’s original
construction and its version in the torsion case look quite geometrical the fact that
the cell stabilizers are polycyclic is equivalent to solving a system of independent
valuation equations in Z[Q]/ann(A) and involves non-trivial commutative algebra
arguments.
There is a Σ-version of Brown’s criterion due to H. Meinert. We discuss here only
the Σ2-case, as the higher dimensional version is needed only in its homological form
[45, Sec.3.2] (remember the general philosophy that homotopy is needed only in
dimension 2, the higher dimensional cases can be substituted with their homological
counterparts).
Theorem 3.2 [44, Thm A] Suppose a group G acts on a 1-connected G-ﬁnite
2-complex X such that all vertex stabilizers are ﬁnitely presented and all edge sta-
bilizers are ﬁnitely generated. Let χ : G →R be a homomorphism and assume that
h : X →R is a χ-equivariant height function. Then [χ] ∈Σ2(G) if and only if
there is a constant d ≥0 such that the maps
πi(Xh≥0) →πi(Xh≥−d),
induced by inclusion, are trivial for i = 0, 1.
It is not diﬃcult to see that χ-equivariant height function h as above always
exists if all cell stabilizers Gσ of a cell σ are contained in the kernel of χ and if Gσ
ﬁxes the cell σ pointwise. The following result deals with the other extreme case
when none of the cell stabilizers are in the kernel of χ.
Theorem 3.3 [44, Thm B] Let a group G act on a 1-connected G-ﬁnite 2-complex
X. If χ : G →R is a homomorphism such that 0 ̸= χ |Gσ, [χ |Gσ] ∈Σ2−dim(σ)(Gσ)
for all cells σ of X, then [χ] ∈Σ2(G).
Theorems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 (together with their homological form for arbitrary
dimension [45]) imply the FPm-Conjecture and the Σm-Conjecture in the case of
metabelian groups of ﬁnite Pr¨ufer rank and their torsion analogue.

In general both conjectures are still open though the small dimensional cases are
well understood. For example both conjectures hold for m = 2 [20],[42] and for
m = 3 in case G is a split extension of abelian groups [16], [43]. Some higher dimen-
sional cases for speciﬁc metabelian groups can be found in [4], [34], [63], [54], [56].
Furthermore, the above conjectures are likely to hold only in the case of metabelian
groups. Already for constructible (nilpotent of class 2)-by-abelian groups there is
an example of a group G such that Σ2(G, Z)c = [conv≤3(R>0Σ1(G)c)] [62]. This
example turns out to be a counter example to a conjecture of Meinert that for a
constructible nilpotent-by-abelian group Σm(G, Z)c = Σ∞(G, Z)c implies that the
dimension of the span of Σ1(G)c in Hom(G, R) is at most m [46].

Finite generation of modules and m-tameness
As we will see later in this paper there is a strong link between metabelian groups
of type FPm and tensor and exterior powers of ﬁnitely generated modules A over
Z[Q] for Q a ﬁnitely generated abelian group. We view the tensor power ⊗iA as a
Z[Q]-module via the diagonal Q-action, i.e. (a1 ⊗. . . ⊗ai)q = (a1q) ⊗. . . ⊗(aiq).
This action induces a Q-action on the exterior power ∧iA. The classiﬁcation of the
modules A for which the tensor power ⊗iA is ﬁnitely generated over Q (via the
diagonal action) is given in terms of an invariant ∆v(Q, A) [15].
Let v be a ﬁxed valuation (in the sense of Bourbaki) of the image of Z in
Z[Q]/ann(A); this valuation is either trivial in the sense that its image is the
set {∞, 0} or up to multiplication is the p-adic valuation. By deﬁnition ∆v(Q, A)
contains all real characters χ of Q including the trivial character, such that χ can
be lifted to a real valuation of Z[Q]/ann(A), whose restriction to the image of Z
inside Z[Q]/ann(A) is the ﬁxed valuation v. Using methods from valuation theory
R. Bieri and J. Groves prove the following important characterization.
Theorem 4.1 [15] Suppose Q is a ﬁnitely generated abelian group and A is a
ﬁnitely generated Z[Q]-module. Then ⊗iA is not ﬁnitely generated over Z[Q] via
the diagonal action if and only if there exist characters χ1, . . . , χi in ∆v(Q, A)
for some non-negative valuation v of the image of Z in Z[Q]/ann(A) such that
χ1 + . . . + χi = 0 and at least one χj is non-zero.
The invariant ∆v(Q, A) turns out to be closely related to the invariant Σ1(G)c
for G an extension of A by Q, the type of the extension being irrelevant. This
can be seen via the bijection µ : Σ0(Q, A)c →Σ1(G)c sending [χ] to [χπ], where
π : G →Q is the canonical projection, together with the following result.
Theorem 4.2 [14] For G an extension of A by Q we have
Σ0(Q, A)c = ∪v[∆v(Q, A) \ {0}]
where the union is over all valuations v of the image of Z in Z[Q]/ann(A).
Furthermore, the above description of Σ1(G)c together with deep valuation the-
ory arguments show that Σ1(G)c has a special structure [14, Thm.E] : is a rationally

350
KOCHLOUKOVA
deﬁned spherical polyhedron, i.e. ﬁnite union of sets, each of which is ﬁnite inter-
section of ﬁnitely many closed hemispheres in S(G) deﬁned by rational points in
S(G). The rationality in this description is very important as it implies that the
rational points in Σ1(G)c form a dense subset of Σ1(G)c and in many problems
allows one to restrict to the case of rational characters i.e. characters with cyclic
image. Note that such a description does not hold outside the class of metabelian
groups. There are examples in [18, Sec.8] of ﬁnitely generated subgroups G of the
group of PL homeomorphism of the unit interval [0,1] for which Σ1(G)c has an
isolated non-discrete point.
Now we discuss how the ﬁnite generation over Z[Q] of exterior powers of a Z[Q]-
module A is linked with the integral homology of A. First we note that H∗(A, Z) =
⊕iHi(A, Z) is equipped with divided powers and with a anticommutative product
structure via the Pontryagin product. More precisely for a commutative ring k the
Pontryagin product on H∗(A, k) is the composite
H∗(A, k) ⊗H∗(A, k) →H∗(A × A, k ⊗k)
µ∗
−→H∗(A, k)
where µ : (A × A, k ⊗Z k) →(A, k) is the multiplication map and the ﬁrst map is
induced by tensoring resolutions of k over Z[A]. More details about the divided
power structure of H∗(A, k) can be found in [26, p. 124]. It is well known that
the exterior algebra of A naturally embeds in H∗(A, Z), the wedge product in the
exterior algebra corresponding to the Pontryagin product in the homology group
and the action of Q on the homology group restricted to the the exterior power
of A being the diagonal one.
In case A is Z-torsion-free this embedding is an
isomorphism [26, Ch.4, Thm 6.4]. In general it is really diﬃcult to ﬁnd a natural
description of the integral homology of A. In case of coeﬃcients Fp the integral
homology is described in [35] except for the case p = 2 and A not of exponent 2.
By deﬁnition for an abelian group B of prime exponent S(B) is the subalgebra
of all symmetric elements in the tensor algebra ⊕i≥0 ⊗i B i.e. S(B) = ⊕i≥0 Si(B)
and Si(B) is the subspace of the elements of ⊗iB invariant under the action of the
symmetric group on i elements, the symmetric group acts via permutation of the
factors of ⊗iB.
Theorem 4.3 [35, Ch.9,Ch.10] Suppose p is a prime and Fp is the ﬁeld with p
elements.
1. If p is odd
H∗(A, Fp) ≃(∧Fp(A/pA)) ⊗Fp S(Ap)
where A/pA has weight 1 and Ap has weight 2. Here Ap = {a ∈A | pa = 0}.
2. If p = 2 and A is of exponent 2
H∗(A, F2) ≃S(A)
where A has weight 1.
In both cases the isomorphism is a natural isomorphism of graded divided powers
algebras i.e. preserves grading, the multiplicative and the divided power structures.
The case p = 2 is completed in [59] where the following result is obtained

Theorem 4.4 Let A be an arbitrary abelian group. Then there is a natural ﬁltra-
tion {F i(H∗(A, F2))}i≥0 of the graded algebra H∗(A, F2) with quotients
F i(H∗(A, F2))/F i−1(H∗(A, F2)) ≃∧(A/2A) ⊗Si(A2).
In [59] Theorem 4.4 is used to answer a question raised by J. Groves in [37] :
for a ﬁnitely generated metabelian group G if the homology groups Hi(G, Z) are
ﬁnitely generated for all i ≥0 then G is of ﬁnite rank, i.e. there is natural number
d such that every ﬁnitely generated subgroup of G can be generated by d elements.
In [60] the link between tensor powers and homology of abelian groups is further
explored.
Theorem 4.5 [60] Suppose A is a ﬁnitely generated Z[G]–module, where G is
a ﬁnitely generated group with a normal subgroup H that acts nilpotently on A
and G/H is abelian. Assume furthermore that all tensor powers of A are ﬁnitely
generated over Z[G] via the diagonal G–action Then
1. Hi(A, Z) has a ﬁnite ﬁltration with factors isomorphic to Z[G]–subquotients
of some (possibly diﬀerent) tensor powers of A, where the action of G on the tensor
powers is the diagonal one;
2. for i ≥1 all tensor powers of Hi(A, Z) are ﬁnitely generated over Z[G] via the
diagonal G–action, Σ0(G, Hi(A, Z))c ⊆conv(R>0Σ0(G, A)c) and H acts nilpotently
on Hi(A, Z).
As a corollary of this result we obtain an interesting fact about sections of
constructible nilpotent-by-abelian groups.
Theorem 4.6 [60] If
[N1, N1] ⊆N2 ⊆N1 are normal nilpotent subgroups of a
constructible nilpotent–by–abelian group G then N1/N2 is a module of type FP∞
over Z[G], where G acts via conjugation, and Σ∞(G, N1/N2)c lies in an open hemi-
sphere of S(G). In particular abelian normal subgroups of G are of type FP∞as
Z[G]–modules via conjugation.

Homological methods
There are powerful homological methods that can help in determining whether
a group is of type FPm. Note that in general homology commutes with direct
limits and cohomology with direct products i.e. H∗(G, lim
−→Vj) = lim
−→H∗(G, Vj) and
Hi(G,  Vj) = 
j Hi(G, Vj). As the following criterion, due to R. Bieri, shows
when G is of type FPm the homology Hi(G, ) commutes with direct products for
i ≤m −1 and the converse is true, too. Note that as Z[G] is a free G-module we
have Hi(G, Z[G]) = TorZ[G]
i
(Z, Z[G]) = 0 for i ≥1.
Lemma 5.1 [12, Thm 1.3 + Remarks] Let G be a group and A a ﬁnitely presented
(right) module over Z[G]. Then A is of type FPm over Z[G] if and only if
TorZ[G]
i
(A,

Z[G]) = 0

KOCHLOUKOVA
for all 1 ≤i ≤m −1 and any direct product  Z[G] of arbitrary many copies of
Z[G]. In particular for A = Z and G ﬁnitely generated we obtain that G is of type
FPm if and only if Hi(G,  Z[G]) = 0 for all 1 ≤i ≤m−1 and all direct products.
Lemma 5.2 Suppose G is a ﬁnitely generated group and A is a ﬁnitely generated
(right) Z[G]-module. If Σm(G, A) ̸= ∅then A is of type FPm.
Proof Suppose [χ] ∈Σm(G, A) i.e. A is of type FPm over Z[Gχ]. Let
F : . . . →Fm
∂m
−→Fm−1
∂m−1
−→. . . →F0
∂0
−→A →0
be a projective resolution of A over Z[Gχ] with all Fi ﬁnitely generated for i ≤m
and g an element of G with χ(g) < 0. The complex Fgk with modules Figk is
a resolution of A = Agk over Z with diﬀerentials di(figk) = ∂i(fi)gk for fi ∈Fi,
i ≥0. Then the direct limit of the complexes Fgk when k goes to inﬁnity is a
projective resolution of A over Z[G] with ﬁnitely generated modules in dimension
≤m.
2
As a consequence of Lemma 5.1 it is easy to deduce a fact that is often overlooked,
a remark to it together with a proof can be found well hidden in [4, p.280].
Lemma 5.3 Let G be a group of type FPm and H be a quotient of G that splits,
i.e. G = N ⋊H for some normal subgroup N of G. Then H is of type FPm.
Proof It is easy to check that Hi(G,  Z[G]) is functorial with respect to G.
As H is a split-quotient of G we get that Hi(H,  Z[H]) is a split-quotient of
Hi(G,  Z[G]) = 0 for 1 ≤i ≤m −1.
In particular Hi(H,  Z[H]) = 0 for
1 ≤i ≤m −1 and by Lemma 5.1 H is of type FPm.
2
There is a homotopic version of the above result due to J. Alonso stating that
G ﬁnitely presented implies H ﬁnitely presented provided H is a split quotient of
G [5]. It is worth noting that the condition that the projection G →H splits is
necessary in Lemma 5.3. By [20, Thm B] metabelian quotients of ﬁnitely presented
groups without non-cyclic free subgroups are ﬁnitely presented too. But in general
quotients of ﬁnitely presented groups (resp. type FP2) are not ﬁnitely presented
(of type FP2) [2].
Now we discuss some homological corollaries of the FPm property.
Though
simple the following lemma has important applications for the structure of the
groups of type FPm.
Lemma 5.4 [30] Let G be a group of type FPm and N a normal subgroup such
that G/N is polycyclic. Then Hi(N, k) is ﬁnitely generated as a (right) module
over k[G/N] (with action induced by conjugation) for k = Z or k = Fp.
Proof Let F be a free resolution of Z over Z[G] with all modules in dimensions
≤m ﬁnitely generated. Then Hi(N, k) ≃Hi(F ⊗Z[N] k). Note that F ⊗Z[N] k is
a complex of k[G/N]-modules and in dimension i ≤m these modules are ﬁnitely

DISCRETE GROUPS, LIE ALGEBRAS AND PRO-p GROUPS
353
generated. Furthermore since G/N is polycyclic the group algebra k[G/N] is right
Noetherian and hence any subquotient of a ﬁnitely generated right k[G/N]-module
is ﬁnitely generated. In particular the homology groups Hi(F ⊗Z[N] k) are ﬁnitely
generated over k[G/N] for i ≤m.
2
Lemma 5.5 [30] Suppose 1 →A →G →Q →1 is a short exact sequence of
groups with A and Q abelian, A of prime exponent p and G of type FPm. Then
any m points in Σ1(G)c lie in an open hemisphere of S(G), i.e. G is m-tame.
Proof By the previous lemma Hi(A, Fp) is ﬁnitely generated over Fp[Q] for i ≤m.
By the results in the previous section ∧iA naturally embeds in Hi(A, Fp) and the
action of Q on the exterior power is diagonal i.e. (a1∧. . .∧ai)q = (a1q)∧. . .∧(aiq).
By [13] in the case of modules of prime exponent the ﬁnite generation of ∧iA over
Fp[Q] via the diagonal action is equivalent to the ﬁnite generation of ⊗iA over
Fp[Q] via the diagonal action. This together with Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2
completes the proof.
2
The above result has been generalised.
Using homological methods that ex-
tend the ideas introduced in [4], [63] it has been shown in [56] that whenever G
is FPm, extension of A by Q with A, Q abelian and either the extension splits
or A is Z-torsion i.e.
of ﬁnite exponent as abelian group, then G is m-tame.
The main idea is to prove that whenever G is not m-tame, m minimal with
this property, there is a special element in H0(Q′, H0(A,  Z[G])) whose image
in H0(Q′′, H0(A,  Z[G])) is non-trivial. Here Q is decomposed as Q′ × Q′′, Q′
has torsion-free rank m −1 and Q has torsion free rank n. As ﬁnitely generated
abelian groups are duality groups and by the above remark we have a non-trivial
composition map H0(Q′, E) ≃Hm−1(Q′, E) →Hm−1(Q, E) ≃Hn−m+1(Q, E) →
Hn−m+1(Q′′, E) ≃H0(Q′′, E) for E = H0(A,  Z[G]). In particular the isomor-
phism Hm−1(Q, E) ≃Hm−1(G,  Z[G]) given by the Lyndon-Horschild-Serre spec-
tral sequence is non-zero and hence G is not of type FPm, a contradiction.

Homological properties of pro-p groups
6.1
Basic properties of pro-p modules
In this section we consider only pro-p groups G, i.e. inverse limits of ﬁnite p-groups.
In the category of pro-p groups there are free pro-p groups with the usual universal
property. And ﬁnite presentability can be deﬁned as in the discrete case i.e. G
is ﬁnitely presented as a pro-p group if there is a free pro-p group F with basis a
ﬁnite set X and a ﬁnite subset R of F(X) such that G is the quotient of F by the
smallest closed normal subgroup of F that contains R. As X is ﬁnite F can be
identiﬁed with the inverse limit of all quotients F/N, where F is the free discrete
group with basis X and N is any normal subgroup of index a power of p.
In the case of pro-p groups G the analogue of the group algebra is the so
called completed group algebra Zp[[G]].
By deﬁnition it is the inverse limit of
(Z/pkZ)[G/U] of ordinary group algebras over all positive integers k and open sub-
groups U of G. Note Zp[[G]] contains the ordinary group algebra of G over Zp as

354
KOCHLOUKOVA
a dense subset and Zp[[G]] is a local compact ring; its unique (right) ideal is the
kernel of the canonical map Zp[[G]] →Fp.
Deﬁnition 6.1 A (right) pro-p Zp[[G]]–module M is an abelian pro-p group to-
gether with a continuous map M × Zp[[G]] →M, that makes M a Zp[[G]]-module
in the usual sense and whose restriction to M × Zp →M is given by the natural
action of Zp on M.
We are interested in the homological ﬁniteness properties of pro-p modules over
Zp[[G]]. Before deﬁning these properties we discuss some basic properties of the
category of pro-p Zp[[G]]-modules. As shown in [66] every pro-p Zp[[G]]–module
has a system of open neighbourhoods of 0 consisting of additive subgroups that
are invariant under the action of G. In the category of pro-p Zp[[G]]–modules all
morphisms f : A →B are continuous module homomorphisms.
Theorem 6.2 [33, 1.5] Suppose M is a (right) pro-p Zp[[G]]–module and X is a
subset of M. Then X generates M as a topological Zp[[G]]–module if and only if the
image of X generates M/M∆as a topological Zp[[G]]/∆≃Fp–module, where ∆is
the maximal right ideal of Zp[[G]]. Furthermore if ¯x1, . . . , ¯xn is a set of topological
generators of M/M∆over Fp then M is abstractly generated by x1, . . . , xn over
Zp[[G]].
In the category of the pro-p modules there are enough projectives i.e. every pro-p
Zp[[G]]–module is a quotient of a free pro-p Zp[[G]]–module (= module with free
universal property) [33]. The free pro-p Zp[[G]]–module F(X) with basis X can be
constructed as the inverse limit of L(X)/U over all abstract Zp[[G]]-submodules U
of ﬁnite index in L(X) such that U contains all but ﬁnitely many elements of X.
Here L(X) is the abstract free Zp[[G]]–module with basis X. A pro-p group G is
said to be of type FPm if the trivial Zp[[G]]–module Zp has a free resolution over
Zp[[G]] (note all diﬀerentials are morphisms in the category of pro-p modules over
Zp[[G]]) with all modules in dimensions ≤m ﬁnitely generated (topologically or
abstractly is the same by Theorem 6.2). Note that a pro-p group G is of type FP1
if and only if it is (topologically) ﬁnitely generated.
The completed tensor product plays basic role in the investigation of metabelian
pro-p groups of type FPm. By deﬁnition if A is a right and B a left pro-p Zp[[G]]–
module (possibly G = 1) the completed tensor product Aˆ⊗Zp[[G]]B is the inverse
limit A/Ui ⊗Zp[[G]] B/Vj of ordinary tensor products over all open pro-p Zp[[G]]–
submodules Ui and Vj of A and B respectively. The completed tensor product
satisﬁes a standard universal property : there is a map α : A × B →Aˆ⊗Zp[[G]]B
such that every continuous Zp[[G]]–bihomomorphic map β from A × B to a pro-p
Zp[[G]]–module factors through α. The completed n-th exterior power ˆEn
Zp[[G]](A)
or the completed n-th symmetric power ˆSn
Zp[[G]](A) can be deﬁned in a similar way
either as inverse limits of the exterior or symmetric powers or by the corresponding
universal properties.
By deﬁnition if A is a right and B is a left pro-p Zp[[G]]–module 
TorZp[[G]]
n
(A, B)
is the n–th left derived functor of T(A, B) = Aˆ⊗Zp[[G]]B.
We write ˆHn(G, A)

for the pro-p homology group 
TorZp[[G]]
n
(A, Zp). If M is a pro-p Zp[[G]]–module
of exponent p we view it as a module over Fp[[G]] = Zp[[G]]/pZp[[G]]. For such
modules the functor −ˆ⊗Fp[[G]]−deﬁned in a similar way to the completed tensor
product over Zp[[G]] coincides with −ˆ⊗Zp[[G]]−. The following theorem is crucial
for calculating homology groups in the category of pro-p groups and modules.
Theorem 6.3 [33, 4.3] Suppose G is an inverse limit of pro-p groups Gi, A is an
inverse limit of (right) pro-p Zp[[Gi]]–modules Ai. Then ˆHn(G, A) is an inverse
limit of ˆHn(Gi, Ai) over i.
Finally we note that there is a convenient criterion when a pro-p group G is of
homological type FPm. It happens precisely when the homology groups ˆHi(G, Fp)
are ﬁnite for all i ≤m. Furthermore a pro-p group is ﬁnitely presented if and only if
it is of type FP2. This shows how diﬀerently the pro-p groups behave compared to
the discrete case where ﬁnite presentability is not equivalent to the property FP2.
Furthermore by Lemma 5.4 for a discrete group H of type FPm the homology
Hi(H, Fp) is ﬁnite for all i ≤m but the converse does not hold.
6.2
Homological ﬁniteness properties of metabelian pro-p groups
Let Q be a ﬁnitely generated abelian pro-p group and T(Q) denotes the set of
continuous homomorphisms from Q to the group of units of the power series alge-
bra K[[T]], where K is the algebraic closure of Fp. Every ﬁnitely generated closed
multiplicative subgroup of 1 + TK[[T]] is a free abelian pro-p group and the con-
tinuous homomorphisms from Q to K[[T]]× have images inside 1 + TK[[T]]. Now
every element v ∈T(Q) extends to a unique (continuous) algebra homomorphism
v : Zp[[Q]] →K[[T]]. Suppose A is a non-zero ﬁnitely generated pro-p Zp[[Q]]–
module. Then the invariant of A as deﬁned in [51], [52] is
∆A(Q) = {v ∈T(Q) | Ao ⊂ker v} ∪{1}
where Ao = AnnZ[[Q]]A is the annihilator ideal of A in Zp[[Q]]. We say that A is m-
tame over Zp[[Q]] if whenever v1, . . . , vm ∈∆A(Q) have the property v1 . . . vm = 1
then v1 = . . . = vm = 1. In [52] the above invariant is called geometric, and is
associated to any pro-p extension G of A by Q. But there is little justiﬁcation
for classifying this invariant as geometric. In fact the absence of geometric idea
makes it diﬃcult to generalise this invariant to the case of an arbitrary ﬁnitely
generated pro-p group G. Still this invariant is strikingly important in the theory
of metabelian pro-p groups and as the following theorem shows plays the same role
as the Bieri-Strebel invariant Σ1(G)c in the theory of discrete groups.
Theorem 6.4 [51, sec.15],[52] If 1 →A →G →Q →1 is a short exact sequence
of pro-p groups such that G is (topologically) ﬁnitely generated, A and Q are abelian
then G is ﬁnitely presented as a pro-p group if and only if A is 2–tame over Zp[[Q]].
As shown in [51, Thm 9.2], [53] if G is a pro–p group, N a normal closed
subgroup such that the completed group algebra Fp[[G/N]] is topologically (right)

356
KOCHLOUKOVA
Noetherian (i.e. every ascending sequence of closed right ideals stabilizes), then
G is of type FPm over Zp if and only if ˆHi(N, Fp) is ﬁnitely generated as a pro-p
Fp[[G/N]]–module for all i ≤m.
Note that by [66, Prop.8.6.7] and [51, Cor.7.6] for a pro-p group H of ﬁnite
rank the completed group algebra Fp[[H]] is topologically and abstractly (right)
Noetherian. Then to classify the abelian-by-ﬁnite rank pro–p groups of type FPm
we have to understand the module structure of ˆHm(A, Fp) for (right) pro-p Zp[[H]]–
modules A, H pro-p group of ﬁnite rank. The following theorem gives a description
of the homology groups of A in terms of completed tensor products.
Corollary 6.5 [58, Cor.C] Let A be a (right) ﬁnitely generated pro-p Zp[[H]]–
module, where H is a pro-p group of ﬁnite rank. Then ˆHn(A, Fp) has a ﬁltration
of (right) Zp[[H]]–submodules with quotients that are pro-p Zp[[H]]–subquotients of
ˆHα1(A1, Fp)ˆ⊗Zp ˆHα2(A2, Fp)ˆ⊗Zp . . . ˆ⊗Zp ˆHαs(As, Fp),
where α1 + . . . + αs = n,
A has a ﬁltration B1 = A ⊃B2 = torA ⊃B3 ⊇. . . ⊇Bs ⊃Bs+1 = 0,
Aj = Bj/Bj+1, Aj has exponent p for j ≥2 and the action of H on the above
completed tensor product is the diagonal one.
In particular if the m–th tensor product ˆ⊗m
ZpA is ﬁnitely generated as a pro-p
Zp[[H]]–module via the diagonal H-action for all m ≤n then ˆHn(A, Fp) is ﬁnitely
generated as a pro-p Zp[[H]]–module (abstractly or topologically is the same).
It is interesting to note that the proof of the above result uses substantially the
Cartan’s Theorem 4.3 discussed in section 4. Corollary 6.5 together with Theo-
rem A from [58] that states that ﬁnite generation over Zp[[Q]] (via the diagonal
Q-action, Q ﬁnitely generated abelian pro-p group) of completed tensor, symmet-
ric and exterior powers of ﬁnitely generated pro-p Zp[[Q]]-module A are equivalent
imply the conjectured by J. King classiﬁcation of metabelian groups of type FPm
[51]. Note that an extra equivalent condition is included to the original hypothesis,
namely the ﬁnite generation of the symmetric powers and that the original con-
jecture contained a more restrictive form of condition 2. It required that all i–th
completed exterior powers for i ≤m, not only i = m, are ﬁnitely generated.
Theorem 6.6 [58, Thm.D] Suppose 1 →A →G →Q →1 is a short exact se-
quence of pro-p groups, G is (topologically) ﬁnitely generated, A and Q are abelian.
We view A as a (right) pro-p Zp[[Q]]–module via the action of Q given by (right)
conjugation. Then the following are equivalent:
1. G is of type FPm over Zp;
2. the completed m–th exterior tensor power of A is a ﬁnitely generated pro-p
Zp[[Q]]–module via the diagonal Q–action;
3. the completed m-th tensor power of A is a ﬁnitely generated pro-p Zp[[Q]]–
module via the diagonal Q–action;
4. the completed m–th symmetric tensor power of A is a ﬁnitely generated pro-p
Zp[[Q]]–module via the diagonal Q–action;
5. A is m–tame over Zp[[Q]].

Homological properties of Lie algebras
In this section we discuss homological ﬁniteness properties of Lie algebras L. By
deﬁnition a Lie algebra L over a ﬁeld K is of homological type FPm if the trivial
module K is of homological type FPm over the universal enveloping algebra U(L)
of L. There is a deep analogy between the group theoretic case where we study
the trivial module Z over the group algebra Z[G] and the Lie algebra case where Z
is substituted with the ﬁeld K and U(L) plays the role of the group algebra. Still
the Lie algebra case diﬀers from the group theoretic case by its lack of geometric
methods. All the results in the Lie case obtained by now depend on valuation theo-
retic arguments. Furthermore all known results for groups that have a homological
proof hold in the Lie case and there are results as the generalised FPm-Conjecture
for metabelian group [55, Conj.1] whose version for Lie algebras holds for split
extensions [57] but the same question for groups is still open.
Now we continue with a short description of the results of Bryant and Groves
that lead to the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnitely presented metabelian groups in [30],
[31]. This classiﬁcation depends on the invariant ∆(Q, A), where A is an abelian
ideal of L with abelian quotient Q = L/A. Let K[Q] be the polynomial algebra on
n commuting variables where n is the dimension of Q. For every abelian Lie algebra
L0 over a ﬁeld K the universal enveloping algebra U(L0) of L0 is isomorphic to the
symmetric algebra S(L0) of L0 i.e. S(L0) is the quotient of the tensor algebra of
L0 over K through the ideal generated by x⊗y −y ⊗x for x, y ∈L0. In particular,
K[Q] is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra U(Q) of Q. By deﬁnition
for a ﬁnitely generated K[Q]-module A
∆(Q, A) = {[χ] | χ ∈HomK(Q, K((t))), χ is extendable to a ring homomorphism
χ′ : K[Q]/Ann(A) →K((t))} ⊂HomK(Q, K((t)))/HomK(Q, K[[t]]),
where [χ] = χ+Hom(Q, K[[t]]), K is the algebraic closure of K, K((t)) is the ﬁeld
of fractions of K[[t]] and Ann(A) is the annihilator of A in K[Q]. The proof of the
following lemma was pointed out to me by J. Groves.
Lemma 7.1 Suppose 0 →V1 →V →V2 →0 is a short exact sequence of ﬁnitely
generated K[Q]–modules. Then
∆(Q, V ) = ∆(Q, V1) ∪∆(Q, V2).
Proof Observe ﬁrstly, that ∆(Q, V ) is deﬁned in terms of the annihilator of V .
More precisely, it is deﬁned in terms of the prime ideals containing the anni-
hilator, since the kernel of the extension χ′ of χ for [χ] ∈∆(Q, V ) is a prime
ideal. Thus, if Ann(V ) ⊆Ann(W), then ∆(Q, W) ⊆∆(Q, V ). More precisely, if
χ′ : K[Q]/ann(W) →K((t)) is the map showing that [χ] ∈∆(Q, W) then we can
combine this with the natural surjection K[Q]/ann(V ) →K[Q]/ann(W) to show

358
KOCHLOUKOVA
that [χ] ∈∆(Q, V ). Since the annihilator of any proper submodule or quotient
contains the annihilator of V , this shows that ∆(Q, V1) ∪∆(Q, V2) ⊆∆(Q, V ).
For the converse, suppose that I1, I2 are the annihilators of V1 and V2. Then
I1I2 annihilates V . Suppose that [χ] ∈∆(Q, V ) and that the corresponding map
induced on K[Q] is χ′ with kernel P. Then I1I2 ⊆Ann(V ) ⊆P and so, as P is
a prime ideal, I1 ⊆P or I2 ⊆P. It follows, as in the previous paragraph, that
[χ] ∈∆(Q, V1) or [χ] ∈∆(Q, V2).

The main result of [30], [31] is the following characterization of the ﬁnitely pre-
sented metabelian Lie algebras.
Theorem 7.2 Suppose L is a ﬁnitely generated Lie algebra over a ﬁeld K, A is
an abelian ideal in L with Q = L/A abelian. Then the following conditions are
equivalent:
1. L is ﬁnitely presented as a Lie algebra;
2. L is of type FP2 over K;
3.
the exterior square of A is ﬁnitely generated over K[Q] via the diagonal
adjoint action;
4. whenever [χ1], [χ2] ∈∆(Q, A) \ {[0]} we have [χ1] + [χ2] ̸= [0] i.e. ∆(Q, A)
has no non-zero antipodal elements.
We remind the reader that a module over a Lie algebra L (over a ﬁeld K) is a
module over its universal enveloping algebra U(L). We are primarily interested in
the homological ﬁniteness properties of modules B over L such that some abelian
ideal A of L with L/A abelian has the property that A acts trivially on B. This
includes the case of the trivial module K.
Theorem 7.3 [57]Suppose L is a ﬁnitely generated Lie algebra over a ﬁeld K, A
is an abelian ideal in L with Q = L/A abelian and B is a ﬁnitely generated (right)
module over the universal algebra U(Q) of Q. Then the following are equivalent:
1. B is ﬁnitely presented as a (right) module over L (i.e. as a module over the
universal algebra U(L) of L) where the action of L is via the canonical projection
π : L →Q.
2. A ⊗K B is ﬁnitely generated over the universal algebra U(Q), where U(Q)
acts via the diagonal homomorphism ∂: U(Q) →U(Q) ⊗U(Q) sending q ∈Q to
q ⊗1 + 1 ⊗q.
3. ∆(Q, A) ∩−∆(Q, B) = [0].
Theorem 7.3 together with the Bryant-Groves characterization of the ﬁnitely
presented metabelian Lie algebras implies the following surprising result.
Corollary 7.4 [57] Suppose L is a ﬁnitely generated Lie algebra over a ﬁeld with
an abelian ideal A such that Q = L/A is abelian. Then L is ﬁnitely presented as
a Lie algebra if and only if A is ﬁnitely presented as a module over the universal
algebra U(L) of L.

We ﬁnish this section with a Lie algebra version of the generalised FPm-Conjectu-
re suggested in [61, Conj.7] and [55, Conj.1]. In the Lie algebra case the Bryant-
Groves invariant ∆plays the role of the Bieri-Strebel invariant Σ1(G)c. Note the
result is known only for split extensions metabelian Lie algebras. And the group
theoretic analogue of the equivalence of 1 and 3 in the following theorem is still an
open problem.
Theorem 7.5 [57] Suppose L is a ﬁnitely generated Lie algebra over a ﬁeld K, A
is an abelian ideal in L with Q = L/A abelian and B is a ﬁnitely generated (right)
module over the universal algebra U(Q) of Q. We further assume that L is a split
extension of A by Q. Then the following are equivalent:
1. B is of type FPm over L;
2. B ⊗(⊗mA) is ﬁnitely generated over U(Q) via the diagonal map U(Q) →
⊗m+1U(Q) sending q ∈Q to 
0≤k≤m(⊗k1) ⊗q ⊗(⊗m−k1);
3. whenever [v2], . . . , [vm+1] ∈∆(Q, A), [v1] ∈∆(Q, B) and [0] = [v1] + . . . +
[vm+1] then all [vi] = [0].
The proof of the above theorem is very diﬀerent from the proof of the pro-p
version for B being the trivial Zp[[G]]-module Zp i.e. Thm 6.6. In the Lie case
it is not suﬃcient to study homology groups. The most diﬃcult part of the proof
of Theorem 7.5 is the building of resolution of B with the required homological
ﬁniteness properties.

Valuation theory : link between the Lie, pro-p and discrete cases
We have already emphasized the point that all three cases considered in this sur-
vey paper : discrete groups, pro-p groups and Lie algebras can be united (in the
metabelian case) by valuation-theoretic arguments. In this short section we will
draw the similarities and diﬀerences between these cases. Most of the arguments
have been already mentioned in the diﬀerent parts of the paper but putting them
together can give a better insight into the theory.
1. First we outline several points about the discrete case. Here G is a ﬁnitely
generated group, an extension of A by Q, A and Q both abelian.
The ﬁnite
presentability of G is equivalent to Σ1(G)c = Σ0(G, A)c not containing antipodal
elements. In general the ﬁnite presentability of G implies that H2(A, Z) is ﬁnitely
generated over Z[Q] via the diagonal action (see Lemma 5.4), but the converse
holds only in restrictive cases. Still ﬁnite generation (over Z[Q]) of the exterior
power of A is equivalent to the ﬁnite generation of the tensor square of A (over
Z[Q]) which is equivalent to the fact that for every non-negative valuation v the
invariant ∆v(Q, A) does not have antipodal non-zero characters. The proof of the
last statement is based on two facts. The ﬁrst is the direct product formula [15,
Thm 4.2]
∆v(Q1 × Q2, A1 ⊗Z A2) = ∆v(Q1, A1) × ∆v(Q2, A2)
The second is the following criterion [15, Lemma 5.1] : for a ﬁnitely generated Z[H]-
module M, T ⊆H ﬁnitely generated abelian groups, M is ﬁnitely generated over

360
KOCHLOUKOVA
Z[T] if and only if for every discrete non-negative valuation v : Z/(Z∩ann(M)) →R
we have
∆v(H, M) ∩res−1
T (0) ⊆{0}
(∗)
where resT : Hom(H, R) →Hom(T, R) is the restriction map.
2. In the case of a ﬁnitely generated Lie algebra L, an extension of abelian Lie
algebras A by Q, the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite presentability is in terms of the invariant
∆(Q, A). As already mentioned ﬁnite presentability is equivalent to ∆(Q, A) with-
out non-zero antipodal elements. At ﬁrst glance the deﬁnition of ∆(Q, A) looks
fairly complicated but it becomes natural once it is explained that the above con-
dition for non-antipodal points is equivalent to the ﬁnite generation of A⊗K A over
K[Q] via the diagonal action i.e. q ∈Q acts via multiplication with 1 ⊗q + q ⊗1
(note that the diagonal action here is quite diﬀerent from the group case). The
latter result is proved using deep valuation theoretic methods [31, Prop.3.4]. In
the Lie case there is a direct product formula too [31, Prop.3.3] and a Lie version
of (∗) [31, Prop.3.1]. Furthermore the ﬁnite generation (over K[Q]) of the tensor
square of A is equivalent to the ﬁnite generation of the exterior square of A (over
K[Q]). As in the discrete case the ﬁnite presentability of L implies immediately
that H2(A, K) ≃A ∧K A is ﬁnite generated over K[Q].
3. In the case of a ﬁnitely generated pro-p group G, an extension of abelian pro-
p groups A by Q, we have by the results of J. King that the ﬁnite presentability
of G is equivalent to the ﬁnite generation of the completed exterior square of A
over the completed group algebra Zp[[Q]]. Again the invariant introduced by J.
King has a fairly complicated deﬁnition that becomes natural once the following
results are proved. By [52, Thm.D] every just-inﬁnite compact local commuta-
tive ring of characteristic p embeds in K[[T]], where K is the algebraic closure
of Fp (remember by deﬁnition ∆A(Q) contains the characters of Q with image
in the multiplicative group of K[[T]] that can be lifted to ring homomorphism
Zp[[Q]]/Ann(A) →K[[T]]). This easily implies A is (topologically) ﬁnitely gen-
erated if and only if ∆A(Q) = {1}. As before ﬁnite generation (over Zp[[Q]] via
the diagonal action given by multiplication with q ⊗q for q ∈Q) of completed
exterior or tensor square of A are equivalent. There is pro-p version of (∗) given
in [52, Cor.2.6]. And the completed exterior power of A over Zp is isomorphic to
ˆH2(A, Zp), thus explaining the link between ﬁnite presentability of G and ﬁnite
generation of A ∧Zp A over Zp[[Q]].
By now we have discussed only similarities but in fact there are many diﬀerences,
some are outlined below.
1. Principally what distinguishes the Lie from the discrete case (via the corre-
spondence of the trivial module Z over Z[G] with the trivial module K over the
universal enveloping algebra of L) is the type of action. In the Lie case the action
of L on the exterior square of the abelian ideal A is given by multiplication with
1 ⊗q + q ⊗1 for q ∈L/A. In the discrete case the action of G on the exterior
square of the abelian normal subgroup A with abelian quotient G/ A is given by
multiplication with q ⊗q, for q ∈G/ A. The more complicated nature of the action
in the Lie case is the main culprit of the necessity to deﬁne the Lie invariant in its
present form.

DISCRETE GROUPS, LIE ALGEBRAS AND PRO-p GROUPS

2. In the discrete case it is the decomposition of a ﬁnitely presented group as an
HNN extension with ﬁnitely generated base and associated subgroups that led to
the ﬁrst deﬁnition of the geometric invariant. This decomposition gives the discrete
part of the Bieri-Strebel-Neumann result that for ﬁnitely presented groups without
free subgroups of rank two Σ1(G)c does not contain antipodal points. Though the
HNN construction has proved quite useful in the discrete case it has not given the
expected results neither in the Lie nor in the pro-p cases. By now the best result
obtained using the HNN equivalent for Lie algebras is that any ideal of codimension
1 in a ﬁnitely presented Lie algebra L, L without free subalgebras of rank 2, is itself
ﬁnitely generated as a Lie algebra [65] (in fact in [65] this result is stated only for
soluble Lie algebras but the proof uses only the absence of free Lie subalgebras of
rank 2). In the discrete case the normal subgroups of a ﬁnitely presented group
with quotients isomorphic to Z are not necessary ﬁnitely generated.

Related topics
In this section several questions are outlined, these are questions related to one
of the main topics of this survey paper - the homological ﬁniteness properties of
groups.
1. One of the basic questions in the ﬁeld is the characterisation of the ﬁnitely
presented groups in the class of all ﬁnitely generated soluble groups. Unfortunately
outside the class of metabelian groups not much is known.
There is complete
classiﬁcation in the case of nilpotent-by-abelian S arithmetic groups deﬁned over
the rationals [1] that later motivated the results in [36]. The proof of the main
result in [1] is long and complicated, and involves methods from the theory of
algebraic groups plus results for extension of Lie groups over a local ﬁeld (i.e. a
ﬁnite extension of the p-adic ﬁeld Qp) by discrete abelian group that acts on the Lie
part via topological automorphisms. For locally compact groups there are compact
versions of the homotopical and homological ﬁniteness properties that are still not
well understood [3].
For example it is not known (though it is probably true)
whether a quotient of a CPm group (CPm is the compact version of FPm) by a
CPm−1 is again of type CPm. The problem arises from the lack of homological
criterion of the type of Lemma 5.1 for locally compact groups.
Going back to the class of discrete groups we note that recently a break through
was done in [23] where the characterisation of the ﬁnitely presented abelian-by-
nilpotent groups was reduced to the case of ﬁnitely presented abelian-by-nilpotent
of class 2 groups. The latter question is still open.
Theorem 9.1 [23, Cor.1] Let G be a ﬁnitely presented group. Either
1. there is a prime p and a subgroup G1 of ﬁnite index in G such that the pro-p
completion of G1 contains a non-abelian free pro-p group
or
2. if G is any image of G with G/Fitt(G) virtually nilpotent then G/Fitt(G) is
virtually nilpotent of class at most 2.

KOCHLOUKOVA
As the following theorem shows considering ﬁnitely presented metanilpotent
(=nilpotent-by-nilpotent) groups instead of ﬁnitely presented soluble ones is not
very restrictive.
Theorem 9.2 [24, Thm A] Every ﬁnitely presented abelian-by-polycyclic group has
a metanilpotent subgroup of ﬁnite index.
Theorem 9.2 gives a negative answer to a question raised by G. Baumslag [6] of
whether every ﬁnitely generated abelian-by-polycyclic group can be embedded in
a ﬁnitely presented abelian-by-polycyclic group.
2. The idea behind the geometric invariants is to study the behaviour of closed
half subspaces of the universal coverings of K(G, 1)-space with ﬁnite m-skeleton.
There is an ∞versions of this idea i.e. study the homological and homotopical
pro-type of the neighbourhoods of ∞. It is interesting that in this case it is the
cohomology H∗(G, ZG) that decides whether a group is m-acyclic at inﬁnity i.e.
Hi(G, Z[G]) = 0 for i ≤m −1 and Hm(G, Z[G]) is torsion-free if and only if G is
m acyclic at inﬁnity [40, Cor] . More results about connectivity at inﬁnity can be
found in [29], [8], [39].
3. As stated in the introduction there are few classes of groups where the Σ-
invariants have been computed by now. One of them is the class of right angled
Artin groups [48]. The work in [48] develops the ideas introduced in [7] where the
ﬁrst example of group that is of type FP∞but not ﬁnitely presented is constructed.
More results about the geometric invariants in the case of graph product of groups
can be found in [49] and [50].
4. The Σ theory for discrete groups considered in this paper is a special case of
a more general recent study of groups acting on spaces with non-positive curvature
[9], [10], [11]. Our special case comes from the action of G on G/[G, G] ⊗Z R via
multiplication (either right or left depending on whether our group actions are
right or left). The analogy between the ﬂat case and the more general non-positive
curvature case is in the good theory of geodesics i.e. two diﬀerent geodesics that
start at the same point never meet again, there is a well-deﬁned boundary of a
CAT(0)-space and for every geodesic there is an associated Busemann function
[41]. In the general non-positive curvature case the boundary plays the role of the
unit sphere S(G).
5. In [47] the following direct product formula was suggested for groups G1 and
G2 of type Fn : [χ1, χ2] ∈Σn(G1 × G2)c if and only if either one of the characters
is 0 and for the other we have [χi] ∈Σn(Gi)c or there exist n1 + n2 = n, both
n1 and n2 positive integers, [χi] ∈Σni(Gi)c.
This formula holds for n = 1, 2
[21], [38] but in general is wrong [48, Sect.6]. Still it is not known whether the
homological counterpart holds and if not what other formula for the Σ-invariants
of direct products of groups can be suggested. In the case when G1 and G2 are
metabelian the above formula can be viewed as a corollary of the Σm-Conjecture,
thus it is quite probably true.

Abstract
In the present paper we start to study the soluble groups in which every non-
subnormal subgroup has ﬁnite special rank.

Introduction
Let G be a group, Lnon−sn(G) the set of all non-subnormal subgroups of G. If
Lnon−sn(G) = ∅then we obtain a group, every subgroup of which is subnormal.
The study of these groups was very fruitful and has brought many interesting re-
sults (see the books [12], [13], [8]). The groups G in which the set Lnon−sn(G) is
“very small” in some sense is the natural next consideration. For many domains
of Inﬁnite Group Theory “to be very small” means to satisfy some ﬁniteness con-
ditions. The ﬁrst natural ﬁniteness conditions in Group Theory were the classical
minimal and maximal conditions.
The groups with minimal condition for non-
subnormal subgroups have been considered by S. Franciosi and F. de Giovanni [1].
The groups with dual maximal condition for non-subnormal subgroups have been
studied by L.A. Kurdachenko and H. Smith [4]. The groups with maximal condi-
tion for non-subnormal subgroups is nearly allied to the groups, in which the set
Lnon−sn(G) consists only of the ﬁnitely generated subgroups. Such groups have
been considered. The results of papers [1], [4] have been extended on groups with
weak minimal and maximal condition on non-subnormal subgroups [5], [6]. The
weak minimal and maximal conditions are connected with the concept of special
rank (or Mal’tsev-Pr¨ufer rank). A group G is said to have ﬁnite special rank r if
every ﬁnitely generated subgroup of G is at most r-generator and r is the small-
est integer with this property. We will denote the special rank of a group G by
r(G). In this paper we start the study of groups G with the following condition: if
H ∈Lnon−sn(G) then H has ﬁnite (special) rank. These groups are studied in this
paper under an additional condition of solubility. The solubility is here a natural
condition, because the groups with all subgroups subnormal are soluble by a basic
theorem of W. M¨ohres [11]. On the other hand, F. Menegazzo shows, that for
each d > 1 there is a non-nilpotent group of derived length d, all of whose proper
subgroups are subnormal [10].

ALL NON-SUBNORMAL SUBGROUPS OF FINITE RANK

Lemma 1.1 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank.
(1) If H is a subgroup of G then every non-subnormal subgroup of H has ﬁnite
rank.
(2) If H is a normal subgroup of G then every non-subnormal subgroup of G/H
has ﬁnite rank.
Proof The proof is straightforward.
2
Lemma 1.2 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, H = Xλ∈ΛHλ, where each Hλ is a non-identity < g >-invariant subgroup
of ﬁnite rank. If a set {r(Hλ)|λ ∈Λ} is not bounded then < g > is subnormal in
G.
Proof Let < x >=< g > ∩H. Then Supp x = ∆is a ﬁnite subset of Λ and
(Xλ∈MHλ)∩< g >=< 1 > where M = Λ\∆is inﬁnite. There are two subsets K
and N of M such that K ∪N = M, K ∩N = ∅and both sets {r(Hλ)|λ ∈K}
and {r(Hλ)|λ ∈N} are unbounded. It follows that < g > (Xλ∈KHλ) and < g >
(Xλ∈NHλ) have inﬁnite rank, therefore these subgroups are subnormal. Thus their
intersection < g > (Xλ∈KHλ)∩< g > (Xλ∈NHλ) =< g > is subnormal ([8],
Proposition 1.1.2).
2
If G is a group then denote by B(G) the Baer radical of G, that is
B(G) = {g ∈G| < g >
is subnormal in G}.
Corollary 1.3 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
H = Xλ∈ΛHλ where Hλ is a non-trivial < g >-invariant subgroup of ﬁnite rank.
If the set {r(Hλ) | λ ∈Λ} is not bounded then H ≤B(G).
Lemma 1.4 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G. Let A be an inﬁnite < g >-invariant elementary abelian p-subgroup of G, p
a prime. If gn ∈CG(A) for some n ∈N then g ∈B(G).
Proof Let 1 ̸= a1 ∈A, A1 =< a1 ><g>. Since A is elementary abelian then
A = A1 × B1 for some subgroup B1. The set {Bx
1 | x ∈< g >} is ﬁnite, therefore
C1 = 
x∈<g> Bx
1 has ﬁnite index in A and A1 ∩C1 =< 1 >. Let a2, a3, . . . , ak
be elements of C1 with the properties < a2, . . . , ak >=< a2 > × · · · × < ak >
and k −1 > r(A1). Let A2 =< a2, . . . , ak ><g>, then A = A1A2 × B2 for some
subgroup B2 and C2 = ∩x∈<g>Bx
2 has ﬁnite index in A. With the help of similar
arguments we construct the set {An|n ∈N} of ﬁnite < g >-invariant subgroups
such that r(A1) < r(A2) < . . . < r(An) < . . .. Using the Lemma 1.2 we obtain
that g ∈B(G).
2
Corollary 1.5 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank.
If G contains an abelian periodic subgroup A of inﬁnite rank, then B(G) contains
every element of ﬁnite order. In particular, the set T of all elements of ﬁnite order
is a subgroup of G.

KURDACHENKO, SOULES
Proof We have A = Xp∈Π(G)Ap where Ap is the Sylow p-subgroup of A. If there
is a prime p such that r(Ap) is inﬁnite, then A ≤B(G) by Lemma 1.4. If r(Ap)
is ﬁnite for each p ∈Π(A) then the set {r(Ap)|p ∈Π(A)} is not bounded. Then
A ≤B(G) by Lemma 1.2. In both cases r(B(G)) is inﬁnite. The subgroup B(G)
is locally nilpotent ([8], Theorem 2.5.1). In particular, the set T of all elements of
B(G) having ﬁnite order is a (characteristic) subgroup of inﬁnite rank. Let x be an
element of ﬁnite order. By Zaitsev’s Theorem [15], T contains an < x >-invariant
abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank. Again using Lemmas 1.2, 1.4 we obtain that
x ∈B(G), that is x ∈T.
2
Corollary 1.6 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank.
If G is a locally ﬁnite group then either G is a Baer group or G has ﬁnite rank.
Proof If G contains an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank then G = B(G) by
Corollary 1.5. If every abelian subgroup of G has ﬁnite rank then G has ﬁnite rank
by Shunkov’s Theorem [14].

Let R be an integral domain, A an R - module. Put
tR(A) = {a ∈A | AnnR(a) ̸= < 0 >}
Clearly tR(A) is an R-submodule of A. It is called the R-periodic part of A.
If tR(A) = A then A is said to be an R-periodic module. If tR(A) =< 0 > then A
is R-torsion free.
Let I be an ideal of R and put
AI = {a ∈A | (a)In =< 0 >, for some n ∈N}.
Obviously AI is an R-submodule of A. It is called the I - component of A. Let
ΩI,n(A) = {a ∈A | a(In) =< 0 >}.
ΩI,n(A) is also an R-submodule of A, ΩI,n(A) ≤ΩI,n+1(A) for any n ∈N and
AI = 
n∈NΩI,n(A).
Now let R be a principal ideal domain, Spec(R) = {P | P is a maximal ideal of
R}, ΠR(A) = {P ∈Spec(R) | AP ̸=< 0 >}. It is not diﬃcult to prove that
tR(A) =

P∈ΠR(A)AP .
Let C be a simple R-module, then C ∼= R/P for some P ∈Spec(R). Denote by
CP∞the R-injective envelope of C.
The module CP∞is said to be a Pr¨ufer
P-module. As in Abelian Group Theory we can show that
CP ∞∼= lim
−→{R/P n, n ∈N}.
Furthermore, every proper R - submodule of CP ∞is isomorphic with R/P n for
some n ∈N, in particular, it is cyclic.

ALL NON-SUBNORMAL SUBGROUPS OF FINITE RANK

Let P = yR, then CP∞has a subset {an|n ∈N} of elements such that a1y = 0,
an+1y = an, n ∈N, and Cp∞∼= 
n∈N anR. As in Abelian Group Theory we can
prove that if ΩP,1(A) = C1 ⊕. . .⊕Cn where Ci is a simple R-submodule, 1 ≤i ≤n,
then AP = E1 ⊕. . . ⊕En where either Ei is a Pr¨ufer P-module or Ei ∼= R/P mi for
some mi ∈N, 1 ≤i ≤n.
Lemma 1.7 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank, g
an element of inﬁnite order, A a < g >-invariant elementary abelian p-subgroup
of G, p a prime. If A =< a ><g> for some element a ∈A then A is ﬁnite, and
hence gn ∈CG(A) for some n ∈N.
Proof We will consider A as Fp < g > - module. Then A ∼=Fp<g> Fp < g > /I
where I = AnnFp<g>(a). If we suppose that I ̸=< 0 > then Fp < g > /I is ﬁnite,
and all is proved. Therefore assume that I =< 0 >. In this case A ∼= Fp < g >.
Let q, r be the two distinct primes such that q ̸= p, r ̸= p. Then
Fp < g >= Fp < gq > ⊕Fp < gq > g ⊕. . . ⊕Fp < gq > gq−1.
It follows that A = Aq × (Aq)g × · · · × (Aq)gq−1 where Aq =< a ><gq>.
The
subgroups Aq and Ag
q are < gq >-invariant and inﬁnite, thus < gq > Aq and <
gq > (Aq)g are subgroups of inﬁnite rank. Since < gq >=< gq > Aq∩< gq > (Aq)g
then < gq > is subnormal in G ([8], Proposition 1.1.2). By the same reason < gr >
is subnormal in G. The equation < g >=< gq >< gr > yields that < g > is
subnormal ([8], Theorem 1.2.1). It follows that A < g > is nilpotent ([2], Lemma
4). Since A < g >=< a, g > then it is the periodic part of a ﬁnitely generated
nilpotent subgroup. The periodic part of ﬁnitely generated nilpotent subgroup is
ﬁnite, thus A is ﬁnite.
2
Lemma 1.8 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank, g
an element of inﬁnite order, A an elementary abelian < g >-invariant p-subgroup
of G, p a prime. If A is a Pr¨ufer P-module for some P ∈Spec(Fp < g >) then
g ∈B(G).
Proof There is an element y such that P = yFp < g >.
Let A =< an|n ∈
N > where a1y = 0, an+1y = an, n ∈N. The subgroup A1 =< a1, a2 ><g>
is < g >-invariant and ﬁnite, thus the index | < g >: C<g>(A1)| is ﬁnite. Put
< x >= C<g>(A1). We will consider A as Fp < x >-module. Since A is Fp < g >-
divisible then A is also Fp < x >-divisible. Let SocFp<x>(A) = C1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ck.
Since a1, a2 ∈CA(x) then k ≥2. As we noted above A = E1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ek where
Ei is a Pr¨ufer Qi-module for some Qi ∈Spec(Fp < x >).
The subgroups E1
and E2 are < x >-invariant and inﬁnite elementary abelian, hence < x > E1
and < x > E2 have inﬁnite rank, so both these subgroups are subnormal. Then
< x >=< x > E1∩< x > E2 is subnormal too ([8], Proposition 1.1.2]). It follows
that A < x > is nilpotent ([2], Lemma 4). But in this case there is a number
m ∈N such that xm ∈CG(A) ([2], Proposition 2). In other words, gt ∈CG(A) for
some t ∈N. Lemma 1.4 yields that g ∈B(G).

Lemma 1.9 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g an element of inﬁnite order, A an inﬁnite elementary abelian p-subgroup of G
< g >-invariant, p a prime. Then g ∈B(G).
Proof We will consider A as Fp < g >-module. Lemma 1.7 shows that this module
is periodic. Thus A = 
P∈π AP where π = ΠFp<g>(A). Assume ﬁrst that π is
inﬁnite. There are inﬁnite subsets ρ, σ of π with the following properties: ρ∩σ = ∅,
ρ ∪σ = π. The subgroups B1 = 
P∈ρ AP , B2 = 
P∈σ AP are inﬁnite, < g >-
invariant and B1 ∩B2 =< 1 >. Hence < g > B1 and < g > B2 are subnormal and
< g >=< g > B1∩< g > B2 is subnormal too ([8], Proposition 1.1.2).
Suppose now that π is ﬁnite. In this case there is P ∈π such that AP is inﬁnite.
Put C = ΩP,1(A) = ΩP,1(AP ), then C = ⊕λ∈ΛDλ where Dλ is a simple Fp < g >-
submodule, λ ∈Λ. If Λ is ﬁnite, then AP = ⊕λ∈ΛEλ where either Eλ is a Pr¨ufer
P-module or Eλ is a cyclic submodule, λ ∈Λ. Since AP is inﬁnite there is an index
k such that Ek is inﬁnite. Lemma 1.8 yields that g ∈B(G). Finally suppose that
Λ is inﬁnite. Since every Dλ ∼= Fp < g > /P. In particular, t = |Fp < g > /P|,
gs ∈CG(Dλ) for some s ≤t. Since it is true for every λ ∈Λ then gs ∈CG(C).
Again by Lemma 1.4 g ∈B(G).

Lemma 1.10 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, A, B subgroups of B(G) such that A is G-invariant and |A| = p, B is < g >
- invariant and B/A is an inﬁnite elementary abelian p-group, p a prime. Then B
contains a < g >-invariant inﬁnite elementary abelian p-subgroup.
Proof Lemmas 1.4, 1.9 yield that gA ∈B(G/A). Using the arguments of these
Lemmas, also we see that CB/A(gA) = C/A is inﬁnite. Note that C is < g >-
invariant and < C/A, gA > is abelian, that is L =< C, g > has ﬁnite derived
subgroup, in particular, L is an FC-group. Thus the centralizer of g in C has
ﬁnite index in C, and we may assume that [C, g] = 1. Let E be a maximal abelian
subgroup of C containing A. Then E is self-centralizing in C and therefore inﬁnite.
Now put U = Ω1(E), then U is an inﬁnite < g >-invariant elementary abelian p-
subgroup of L.
2
Corollary 1.11 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, A, B subgroups of B(G) such that A is a ﬁnite G-invariant p-subgroup, B
is < g >-invariant and B/A is an inﬁnite elementary abelian p-group, p a prime.
Then B contains a < g >-invariant inﬁnite elementary abelian p-subgroup.
Lemma 1.12 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, A, B subgroups of B(G) such that A is a G-invariant divisible Chernikov
p-subgroup, B is < g >-invariant and B/A is an inﬁnite elementary abelian p-
subgroup, p a prime. Then B contains an inﬁnite < g >-invariant elementary
abelian p-subgroup.
Proof Since B ≤B(G) then B is nilpotent ([7], Lemma 2.4). Since B is periodic
then A ≤ζ(B) ([12], Lemma 3.13). Therefore, for every element b ∈B we have

ALL NON-SUBNORMAL SUBGROUPS OF FINITE RANK
371
[b, B] ∼= B/CB(b). Since A ≤ζ(B) then B/CB(b) is an elementary abelian p-group.
On the other hand, [b, B] ≤A, so that [b, B] has ﬁnite rank ≤r = r(A). From
[b, B] ∼= B/CB(b) we obtain that |B/CB(b)| ≤pr.
By B. H. Neumann’s Theorem ([12], Theorem 4.35) [B, B] is ﬁnite. Since B/[B, B]
is an abelian p-group, but not Chernikov, its lower layer Ω1(B/[B, B]) = C/[B, B]
is inﬁnite. Clearly C is < g >-invariant. Now we can apply the Corollary 1.11. 2
Corollary 1.13 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, A, B subgroups of B(G) such that A is a G-invariant Chernikov p-subgroup,
B is < g >-invariant and B/A is an inﬁnite elementary abelian p-group, p a prime.
Then B contains a < g >-invariant inﬁnite elementary abelian p-subgroup.
Proposition 1.14 Let G be a soluble group whose non-subnormal subgroups have
ﬁnite rank. If G contains an abelian periodic subgroup of inﬁnite rank, then G is a
Baer group.
Proof By Corollary 1.5 the Baer radical B(G) contains every element of ﬁnite
order. Since B(G) is locally nilpotent ([8], Theorem 2.5.1) then the set T of all
elements of B(G) having ﬁnite order is a characteristic subgroup of B(G).
If
for every p ∈Π(T) the Sylow p-subgroup Tp of T has ﬁnite rank then the set
{r(Tp)|p ∈Π(T)} is not bounded. Lemma 1.2 yields that in this case G = B(G).
Now assume that there is a prime p such that Tp has inﬁnite rank. Since G is
soluble then Tp contains G-invariant subgroups A ≤B such that A has ﬁnite
rank (i.e A is a Chernikov subgroup) and B/A is an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite
rank. In particular, Ω1(B/A) = C/A is an inﬁnite elementary abelian p-group. Let
g ∈G. By Corollary 1.13 G contains a < g >-invariant inﬁnite elementary abelian
p-subgroup. By Lemmas 1.4, 1.9 g ∈B(G).
2
If g ∈G and A is a < g >-invariant abelian torsion-free subgroup then we can
consider A as a Z < g >-module.
Lemma 1.15 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g an element of inﬁnite order, A a < g >-invariant torsion-free abelian subgroup
of G. Then A is a Z < g >-periodic module.
Proof Let 1 ̸= c ∈A, C =< c ><g>.
Then C is a cyclic Z < g >-module.
Suppose that AnnZ<g>(c) =< 0 >, that is C ∼=Z<g> Z < g >.
Now we can
repeat the arguments of Lemma 1.7 and obtain that g ∈B(G). It follows that
A < g > is nilpotent ([2], Lemma 1.7).
In particular, < C, g >=< c, g > is
a ﬁnitely generated nilpotent subgroup.
In this case r(C) is ﬁnite, which is a
contradiction to the isomorphism C ∼=Z<g> Z < g >. This contradiction shows
that AnnZ<g>(c) ̸=< 0 >.

Lemma 1.16 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g an element of inﬁnite order, A a < g >-invariant torsion-free abelian subgroup
of G. If A has inﬁnite rank, then < A, g > is hypercentral.
Proof Let E = A⊗ZQ, then we can consider E as Q < g >-module. Let 1 ̸= c ∈A,
C =< c ><g>= cZ < g >, D = cQ < g >. By Lemma 1.15 AnnZ<g>(c) ̸=
< 0 >, that is AnnQ<g>(c) ̸=< 0 > . Since D ∼= Q < g > /AnnQ<g>(c) then
dimQD is ﬁnite. In other words, C has ﬁnite rank. By P. Hall’s Theorem ([13],
Corollary 1 of Lemma 9.53]) C contains a free abelian subgroup L such that C/L
is periodic with ﬁnite set Π(C/L). This means that C is a minimax subgroup. It
follows that for every ﬁnite subset {a1, a2, ..., an} of elements of A the subgroup
< a1, a2, ..., an ><g> is a minimax.
Let a1 ∈A, A1 =< a1 ><g>.
In A/A1 we choose the elements a2A1, a3A1 of
inﬁnite order such that < a2A1, a3A1 >=< a2A1 > × < a3A1 >. Put A2 =<
A1, a2, a3 ><g>, then r(A2/A1) ≥2. Using the same arguments, we can construct
an ascending chain of < g >-invariant subgroups
< 1 >= A0 ≤A1 ≤A2 ≤... ≤An ≤...
satisfying the following conditions:
(i) An is a ﬁnitely generated Z < g > - module;
(ii) r(An+1/An) ≥n + 1, n ∈N.
We have already noted that every subgroup An is minimax. By P. Hall’s Theorem
([12], Theorem 5.34) every factor An+1/An satisﬁes Max-< g >. It follows that its
periodic part is ﬁnite. Choose in A1 a free abelian subgroup C1 such that A1/C1
is periodic (and hence A1/C1 is a Chernikov group). Let p1 /∈Π(A1/C1), then
r(C1/(C1)p1) = r(C1) and C1/(C1)p1, is a Sylow p1-subgroup of A1/(C1)p1.
It
follows that A1/(A1)p1 ∼= C1/(C1)p1, in particular, r(A1/(A1)p1) = r(C1/(C1)p1) =
r(C1) = r(A1). Put B1 = (A1)p1 and now consider A2/B1. Since the periodic part
of A2/A1 is ﬁnite then the Sylow p1-subgroup S/B1 is also ﬁnite. It follows that
A2/B1 = S/B1 × U/B1. Let s = |S/B1| then (A2/B1)s is < g > - invariant and
lies in U/B1, that is (A2/B1)s ∩S/B1 =< 1 >. Put V1/B1 = (A2/B1)s . Using the
previous arguments we can choose a prime p2 ̸= p1 such that V/B1 ̸= (V/B1)p2
and r((V/B1)/(V/B1)p2) = r(V/B1) = r(A2/A1). Put B2/B1 = (V/B1)p2, then B2
is a < g >-invariant subgroup, r(V/B2) ≥2, B2 ∩A1 = B1. Furthermore A2/B2 is
a ﬁnite {p1, p2}-group and r(A2/B2) ≥2. With the help of similar arguments we
can construct an ascending series
< 1 >= B0 ≤B1 ≤B2 ≤... ≤Bn ≤...
of < g >-invariant subgroups satisfying the following conditions:
(iii) Bn ≤An, An/Bn is ﬁnite;
(iv) Bn+1 ∩An = Bn;
(v) r(An/Bn) ≥n, n ∈N.
Put E = 
n∈N An, B = 
n∈N Bn. Then E/B = 
n∈N AnB/B and AnB/B ∼=
An/(An ∩B). It is not hard to show that (iv) implies An ∩B = Bn. This means

ALL NON-SUBNORMAL SUBGROUPS OF FINITE RANK
373
that AnB/B is ﬁnite and r(AnB/B) ≥n. Consequently E/B is a periodic group
of inﬁnite rank. Lemma 1.2 yields that < gB > is subnormal. In this case < gB >
E/B is nilpotent ([2], Lemma 4). In other words, there is a number t such that
[A1,t g] ≤B. Since A1 is < g >-invariant then [A1,t g] ≤B ∩A1 = B1. Let m =
r(A1/B1). Since A1/B1 is an elementary abelian p1-subgroup then [A1,m g] ≤B1.
This is valid for every prime q /∈Π(A1/C1) = σ. Let L1 = 
q /∈σ(A1)q. We have
already noted that (A1)q ∩C1 = Cq
1, thus L1 ∩C1 = 
q /∈σ Cq
1 =< 1 >. Since A1/C1
is periodic, it follows that L1 =< 1 >.
Hence [A1,m g] =< 1 >, i.e < A1, g > is nilpotent. In particular, CA(g) ̸=< 1 > .
Using a transﬁnite induction, we can obtain that < A, g > is hypercentral.

Lemma 1.17 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g an element of inﬁnite order, A a < g >-invariant torsion-free abelian subgroup
of G. If A has inﬁnite rank, then g ∈B(G).
Proof By the previous Lemma the subgroup < A, g > is hypercentral. Let
< 1 >= Z0 ≤Z1 ≤. . . ≤Zω ≤. . . ≤Zγ = A
be the upper < g >-central series of A. It is easy to prove that every subgroup Zα is
pure in A. If we assume that γ is ﬁnite, then < A, g > is nilpotent. Every subgroup
of a nilpotent group is subnormal. Since < A, g > has inﬁnite rank, it is subnormal
and therefore < g > is also subnormal. Assume now that γ is inﬁnite. Put Z = Zω.
If r(Zn) is inﬁnite for some n ∈N, then < g > Zn is subnormal. Since < g > Zn is
nilpotent, < g > is also subnormal. Therefore we may assume that r(Zn) is ﬁnite
for every n ∈N. Choose in Z2 a ﬁnitely generated subgroup K2 such that Z2/K2
is periodic. Put C2 = (K2)<g>. Since < A, g > is hypercentral, < K2, g > is
ﬁnitely generated, thus C2 is ﬁnitely generated. If we assume that [C2, g] =< 1 >
then [Z2, g] =< 1 >, which is impossible. Thus [C2, g] ̸=< 1 >. Let π2 = {p | p
prime number such that [C2, g] ≤Cp
2}.
If we suppose that π2 is inﬁnite, then

p∈π2 Cp
2 =< 1 >. But in this case [C2, g] ≤
p∈π2 Cp
2 =< 1 >, and again we obtain
a contradiction. Hence π2 is ﬁnite. It follows that there is a prime p1 such that
(C2)p1 = E2 does not contain [C2, g]. In Z5/Z2 choose a maximal Z-independent
set of elements {z1Z2, . . . , zmZ2} and put B2/C2 =< z1C2, . . . , zmC2 ><g> . Since
< A, g > is hypercentral then B2/C2 is ﬁnitely generated. Hence there is a number
k such that C3/C2 = (B2/C2)k is torsion free. Since Z5/Z2 is a pure envelope of
C3Z2/Z2 then [C3, g, g, g] ≤Z2 ∩C3 = C2, but [C3, g, g] ̸≤C2. Let π3 = {p | p
prime number such that [C3/C2, g, g] ≤(C3/C2)p}.
Again the set π3 is ﬁnite,
therefore we may choose a prime p2 /∈π2 ∪{p1}. Let (C3/C2)p2 = D/C2. Then
C2/E2 is the periodic part of D/E2, so that D/E2 = C2/E2 × Q/E2. It follows
that E3/E2 = (D/E2)p1 ≤Q/E2, in particular, E3 ∩C2 = E2. Moreover, E3 is
< g >-invariant which does not contain [C3, g, g] and r(C3/E3) ≥3. With the help
of similar arguments we can construct two ascending series
C2 ≤C3 ≤. . . ≤Cn ≤. . .
and E2 ≤E3 ≤. . . ≤En ≤. . .
of < g >-invariant ﬁnitely generated subgroups and a set {pn| n ∈N} of primes
satisfying the following conditions:

374
KURDACHENKO, SOULES
(i) En ≤Cn, Cn/En is a ﬁnite {p1, p2, . . . , pn}-group;
(ii) r(Cn/En) ≥n;
(iii) En does not contain [Cn,n g];
(iv) En+1 ∩Cn = En, n ∈N
Put E = 
n∈N En, C = 
n∈N Cn. Then C/E = 
n∈N(Cn)E/E. By (iv) Cn ∩E =
En, so that (Cn)E/E ∼= Cn/(Cn ∩E) = Cn/En. It follows by (ii) that C/E is
a periodic group of inﬁnite rank and Π(C/E) is inﬁnite. Lemma 1.2 implies that
< gE > is subnormal in < gG, C/E >. Since C/E is abelian and < g >-invariant
then < C/E, gE > is nilpotent ([2], Lemma 1.7). However condition (iii) shows
that < C/E, gE > can not be nilpotent. This contradiction proved that γ is ﬁnite,
and we have already noted that in this case g ∈B(G).

Lemma 1.18 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g an element of ﬁnite order, A a < g > - invariant torsion-free abelian subgroup
of G. If A has inﬁnite rank, then g ∈B(G).
Proof Let 1 ̸= a1 ∈A, A1 =< a1 ><g> . Since |g| is ﬁnite then A1 is ﬁnitely
generated. Let B1 be a subgroup of A maximal with respect to A1 ∩B1 =< 1 > .
Then A/B1 is a torsion - free group of ﬁnite rank.
The set {Bx
1|x ∈< g >}
is ﬁnite.
Let {Bx
1|x ∈< g >} = {Bx1
1 , . . . , Bxm
1 }.
Put C1 = 
x∈<g> Bx
1, then
A/C1 ≤A/Bx1
1 × · · · × A/Bxm
1 . In particular, C1 is a < g >-invariant subgroup
of A with the properties: C1 ∩A1 =< 1 >, A/C1 is a torsion-free group of ﬁnite
rank. So C1 ̸=< 1 >. Now we can repeat the arguments of Lemma 1.4 and obtain
that g ∈B(G).
2
Lemma 1.19 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, and let A, B be < g >-invariant subgroups of B(G) satisfying the following
conditions: A ≤ζ(B), A has ﬁnite rank, [B, g] ≤A and B/A is an abelian group
of inﬁnite rank. Then CG(g) contains an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank.
Proof Consider the mapping φg : b−→[b, g], b ∈B. We have
(bc)φg = [bc, g] = [b, g]c[c, g] = [b, g][c, g] = bφgcφg
because A ≤ζ(B). Furthermore Kerφg = CB(g) and Imφg ≤A, so that B/CB(g)
has ﬁnite rank. This means that CB(g) has inﬁnite rank. Since CB(g) is nilpotent
then it contains an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank ([13], Corollary 2 of Theorem
6.36).
2
Corollary 1.20 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroup have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, and let A, B be < g >-invariant subgroups of B(G) satisfying the following
conditions: A ≤ζ(B), A has ﬁnite rank, B/A is an abelian group of inﬁnite rank.
Then CG(g) contains an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank.
Proof By Lemmas 1.17, 1.18 < gA > is subnormal in < gA, B/A >.
Then
< g, B > /A is nilpotent ([2], Lemma 4), that is B/A has a ﬁnite < g >-central
series. Now we can use Lemma 1.19.

ALL NON-SUBNORMAL SUBGROUPS OF FINITE RANK
375
Corollary 1.21 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank,
g ∈G, and let A, B be < g >-invariant subgroups of B(G) satisfying the following
conditions: A has ﬁnite rank, B/A is an abelian group of inﬁnite rank, and B is
nilpotent. Then CG(g) contains an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank.
Theorem 1.22 Let G be a group whose non-subnormal subgroups have ﬁnite rank.
If G is soluble then either G is a Baer group or G is a group of ﬁnite rank.
Proof Suppose that G has inﬁnite rank. By Kargapolov’s Theorem [3] G contains
an abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank. Let B = B(G), T be the periodic part of
B. If G contains an abelian periodic subgroup of inﬁnite rank then G = B(G)
by Proposition 1.14.
Therefore suppose that every periodic subgroup of G has
ﬁnite rank, i.e.
T is a subgroup of ﬁnite rank.
Since B/T is locally nilpotent
torsion-free and soluble, it has a ﬁnite series T = B0 ≤B1 ≤. . . ≤Bn = B
of G-invariant subgroups with torsion-free abelian factors. By Lemma 1.2 every
abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank lies in B(G). So there is a number m such that
Bm has ﬁnite rank but Bm+1/Bm has inﬁnite rank. Then the nth term of the upper
cent ral series of B/T, for some ﬁnite n contains Bm/T ([13], Lemma 6.37). In
particular, Bm+1/T is nilpotent. Let g ∈G. By Corollary 1.21 there is an abelian
torsion-free subgroup U/T of inﬁnite rank such that [U/T, gT] =< 1 >. Lemmas
1.17, 1.18 yield that gT ∈B(G/T), i.e G/T is Baer group. Let V/T be a free
abelian subgroup of U/T having countable rank. Since G is soluble, T has a ﬁnite
series of G - invariant subgroups < 1 >= T0 ≤T1 ≤. . . ≤Ts = T with abelian
factors. From the proof of Theorem 5 of paper [9] follows that V/Ts−1 contains
a free abelian subgroup V1/Ts−1 of countable rank such that V/V1T is periodic.
Since V1/Ts−1 is subnormal then < V1/Ts−1, T/Ts−1 > is nilpotent ([2], Lemma 4).
By Corollary 1.20 there is a free abelian subgroup V2/Ts−1 of countable rank such
that [V2/Ts−1, gTs−1] =< 1 > . Using the same arguments after ﬁnitely many steps
we obtain that CG(g) contains a free abelian subgroup of inﬁnite rank. Lemmas
1.17, 1.18 yield that g ∈B(G).
2
We remark that there are Baer groups of ﬁnite rank in which not all subgroups
are subnormal. Thus Baer groups, in which the non-subnormal subgroups have
ﬁnite rank, can have non-subnormal subgroups, and their study requires further
consideration.

Abstract
This is a survey indicating the newest results on inﬁnite-dimensional linear groups.
Let F be a ﬁeld, A - a vector space over F. The group GL(F, A) of all automor-
phisms of A and its distinct subgroups (the linear groups) are the oldest subjects of
investigation in Group Theory. Naturally, the ﬁrst step here was the investigation
of the case, when A has ﬁnite dimension over F. Under this condition every ele-
ment of GL(F, A) (a non-singular linear transformation) deﬁnes some non-singular
n × n - matrix over F where n = dimF A. Thus, for the ﬁnite-dimensional case the
theory of linear groups coincides with the theory of matrix groups. That is why
the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional linear groups is one of the best-developed theories
in algebra.
The case when dimF A is inﬁnite is totally diﬀerent. The study of this case always
requires some additional essential restrictions. The situation here is similar to that
one which appeared in the initial period of development of Inﬁnite Group Theory.
One of the very fruitful approaches is associated with the ﬁniteness conditions. It
seems very meaningful to apply it to the linear groups.
Take into consideration the following important aspect. Many problems related
to groups with ﬁniteness conditions require the study of modules over some group
rings, frequently the group rings of the type FG where F is a ﬁeld. Thus, the re-
spectively ﬁniteness conditions from groups could be transferred on the appropriate
modules.
The investigation of modules always has the following two sides. The ﬁrst one
is the study of the internal structure of a module A; the second - the study of the
structure of the group G/CG(A). The second side is especially important for many
group-theoretical applications. It is crucial to admit that the group G/CG(A) is
imbedded in GL(F, A).
A group G ≤GL(F, A) is called a ﬁnitary linear group, if for each element g ∈G
the factor-space A/CA(g) has ﬁnite dimension.
The investigation of such groups proves great eﬀectiveness of applications of the
ﬁniteness conditions to the study of linear groups. We can consider these groups
as linear analogies of FC-groups (the groups with ﬁnite conjugacy classes). The
theory of ﬁnitary linear groups develops rather intensively and became rich with
many interesting results (see, for example, a survey [10]). However, we would like

378

to focus on some other types of inﬁnite-dimensional linear groups.
The irreducible groups form the ﬁrst important type of linear groups.
A group G ≤GL(F, A) is called irreducible if every G - invariant subspace of A
either coincides with ⟨0⟩or with A.
In other words, the FG-module A is simple. Irreducible linear groups also play
an essential role in the general group theory, where they arise as automorphism
groups of abelian chief factors.
The ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible groups were studied rigorously from various
points of view. Therefore we shall not consider problems of their structure, as they
are suﬃciently illuminated in the monographs [13, 14, 9]. One of the important
research tools in this case is the classical Cliﬀord’s theorem.
For the inﬁnite-
dimensional case its analogy is not always valid. Nevertheless, the following its
weak form has been proved.
Theorem 1 [2, 15]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G an irreducible
subgroup of GL(F, A). If H is a normal subgroup of G having ﬁnite index, then
A includes a simple FH-submodule B and A = ⊕x∈SBx for some ﬁnite subset
S ⊆G.
One of the ﬁrst important results on irreducible groups is the following statement
implied by the classical Schur’s lemma.
Proposition 1 [12]. Let F be a ﬁeld, G a group, A a simple FG-module, I =
AnnFG(A).
(i) The center C/I of the factor-ring FG/I is an integral domain.
(ii) ζ(G/CG(A)) is embedded in a multiplicative group of some ﬁeld.
(iii) The periodic part of ζ(G/CG(A)) is a locally cyclic p′ - subgroup where p =
char F.
As usual, we denote the set of all primes by 0′.
The structure of an irreducible group depends on the following its numerical
characteristic.
A group G is said to have 0-rank r0(G) = r if it has a ﬁnite subnormal series
with exactly r inﬁnite cyclic factors, being the others periodic.
Note that every reﬁnement of one of these series has only r factors which are
inﬁnite cyclic; any two ﬁnite subnormal series have isomorphic reﬁnements. This
allows us to claim that 0-rank of a group is independent of the series. This numerical
invariant is also known as the torsion-free rank of G. For polycyclic-by-ﬁnite groups
the 0-rank is exactly its Hirsch number.
Proposition 2 [5].
Let F be a ﬁeld, A be a vector space over F and G be a
locally (polycyclic-by-ﬁnite) subgroup of GL(F, A) of ﬁnite 0-rank. Suppose that

ON SOME INFINITE DIMENSIONAL LINEAR GROUPS
379
the FG - module A is ﬁnitely generated and has only ﬁnitely many maximal FG-
submodules. For each element 1 ̸= z ∈ζ(G) there is a polynomial fz ∈F[X] such
that Afz(z) = ⟨0⟩.
Corollary
[5]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a locally (polycyclic-
by-ﬁnite) subgroup of GL(F, A) of ﬁnite 0-rank. Suppose that the FG-module A is
ﬁnitely generated and has only ﬁnitely many maximal FG-submodules. Then the
center ζ(G) is periodic. In particular, if G is irreducible, then ζ(G) is a locally
cyclic p′ - subgroup where p = char F.
The description of irreducible abelian groups is based on the following construc-
tion.
Let G be a group, F a ﬁeld, ¯F an algebraic ﬁeld closure of F, θ : G −→U( ¯F)
a group homomorphism, Cθ = F[Gθ]. Since all elements of Gθ are algebraic over
F, Cθ is a subﬁeld of ¯F. We can consider Cθ as a FG - module if we put c g =
c(gθ), c ∈Cθ. Also we shall designate this module by Dθ, in order to distinguish
it from the subﬁeld Cθ. It is easy to see that Dθ is a simple FG - module and
CG(Dθ) = Ker θ.
Theorem 2 Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G an abelian subgroup of
GL(F, A) having ﬁnite 0-rank. If G is irreducible, then the following assertion hold:
(i) there is a group homomorphism θ : G −→U( ¯F) where ¯F is an algebraic ﬁeld
closure of F such that an FG - module A is isomorphic with Dθ;
(ii) let θ : G −→U( ¯F) and φθ : G −→U( ¯F) are group homomorphisms; then
Dθ ∼=FG Dφ if and only if there is an F - isomorphism ρ : Cφ −→Cθ such
that θ = φρ;
(iii) the periodic part T of the group G is a locally cyclic p′-subgroup where p =
char F, and if the ﬁeld F is locally ﬁnite, then G = T.
For the case of a Chernikov group G this theorem has been proved in the paper
[3]. However, basing on the mentioned above results, it is easy to extend the proof
on the considered case. Note that the above construction shows that the conditions
of Theorem 2 are also suﬃcient.
Theorem 3 [12]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G an abelian group of
inﬁnite 0-rank, T the periodic part of G. Then G is isomorphic with an irreducible
subgroup of GL(F, A) if and only if T is a locally cyclic p′-subgroup where p =
char F.
As the following results of [6] show, the description of irreducible abelian groups
mentioned above can be extended, practically without serious changes, on the case
of the irreducible hypercentral groups.
Theorem 4 [6]. Let F be a ﬁeld, p = char F, G a hypercentral group of ﬁnite
0-rank, C = ζ(G), T the periodic part of C.
(i) If G is an irreducible subgroup of GL(F, A), then T is a locally cyclic p′-group.
Furthermore, if the ﬁeld F is locally ﬁnite, then C = T.

380
KURDACHENKO, SUBBOTIN
(ii) Conversely, if the ﬁeld F is locally ﬁnite, C = T is a locally cyclic p′-group,
then there exists a simple FG-module A such that CG(A) = ⟨1⟩(i.e. G is an
irreducible subgroup of GL(F, A)).
(iii) If F is not locally ﬁnite and T is a locally cyclic p′ - group, then there exists
a simple FG-module A such that CG(A) = ⟨1⟩( i.e.
G is an irreducible
subgroup of GL(F, A)).
Theorem 5 [6]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a hypercentral group
of inﬁnite 0-rank, C = ζ(G), T a periodic part of C. Then G is isomorphic with
an irreducible subgroup of GL(F, A) if and only if T is a locally cyclic p′ - subgroup
where p = char F.
The classes of irreducible groups, which we shall describe, are extensions of both
the class of ﬁnite groups and the class of abelian groups. One of the eﬀective ways
for obtaining such generalizations is the following general method.
Let X be a class of groups.
Then X is called a formation if it satisﬁes the
following conditions:
(F 1) if G ∈X, H a normal subgroup of G, then G/H ∈X;
(F 2) if G is a group, H1, H2 are its normal subgroups such that G/H1, G/H2 ∈X,
then G/(H1 ∩H2) ∈X.
Let G be a group, x ∈G, xG = {xg = g−1xg|g ∈G}. Clearly, CG(xG) is a
normal subgroup of G. Put XC(G) = {x ∈G|G/CG(xG) ∈X}. Since X is a
formation, XC(G) is a characteristic subgroup of G. This subgroup is called the
XC - center of the group G. A group G is said to be an XC - group or a group
with X - conjugacy classes if XC(G) = G.
If X = I is the class of all identity groups, then the class of IC-groups coincides
with the class A of all abelian groups.
If X = F is the class of all ﬁnite groups, then we obtain the famous class of
FC-groups.
And, ﬁnally, if X = C is the class of all Chernikov groups, then we obtain the
class of CC-groups, which have been introduced by Ya. D. Polovicky [11].
Our nearest aims are irreducible FC - and CC-groups.
Let G be a group.
The subgroup Soc(G) generated by all minimal normal
subgroups of G is called the socle of G. If G has no minimal normal subgroups,
then put Soc(G) = ⟨1⟩. Obviously, there is a family {Mλ|λ ∈Λ} of minimal normal
subgroups of G such that Soc(G) = Xλ∈ΛMλ . Put Λ(ab) = {λ ∈Λ|Mλ is abelian}
and Socab(G) = Xλ∈Λ(ab)Mλ.
Let G be a CC-group, then it includes a normal subgroup S satisfying the
following conditions:
(QS 1) S = Xλ∈ΛSλ where either Sλ is a minimal normal subgroup of G or Sλ is a
normal inﬁnite cyclic subgroup;
(QS 2) if H is a non-identity normal subgroup of G, then H ∩S ̸= ⟨1⟩.
This subgroup S is said to be the quasi-socle of a CC - group G and denoted by
Qsoc(G). Note that Soc(G) ≤Qsoc(G).

ON SOME INFINITE DIMENSIONAL LINEAR GROUPS
381
Theorem 6 [4]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a CC-group of ﬁnite
0-rank.
(i) Let G be an irreducible subgroup of GL(F, A). Then Socab(G) includes a
subgroup H such that CoreG(H) = ⟨1⟩and Socab(G)/H is a locally cyclic
p′-group where p = char F. Furthermore, if the ﬁeld F is locally ﬁnite, then
every quasi-socle of G coincides with its socle.
(ii) Conversely, let Socab(G) includes a subgroupH such that CoreG(H) = ⟨1⟩
and Socab(G)/H is a locally cyclic p′-group where p = char F. Besides, if
the ﬁeld F is locally ﬁnite, then every quasi-socle of G is the socle. Then there
exists a simple FG-module A such that CG(A) = ⟨1⟩(i.e. G is an irreducible
subgroup of GL(F, A)).
Theorem 7 [4]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a CC-group of
inﬁnite 0-rank. Then G is isomorphic with an irreducible subgroup of GL(F, A)
if and only if Socab(G) includes a subgroup H such that CoreG(H) = ⟨1⟩and
Socab(G)/H is a locally cyclic p′ - group where p = char F.
Note that a special case (concerns with locally soluble irreducible linear FC-
groups) of Theorems 6 and 7 has been obtained in [1].
Now we shall consider the linear groups, which are in some sense near to irre-
ducible.
If G ≤GL(A), then we can consider A as a FG-module. If G is irreducible, then
every proper FG-submodule of A is zero, in particular, it is ﬁnite-dimensional. We
will consider the subgroups G ≤GL(F, A) with the following property:
every proper FG-submodule of A is ﬁnite-dimensional.
The following two cases appear here:
(i) A includes an FG-submodule B such that dimF B is ﬁnite and A/B is a
simple FG-module of inﬁnite dimension;
(ii) every proper FG-submodule of A has ﬁnite dimension and A is the union of
its ﬁnite-dimensional FG-submodules.
The ﬁrst case is reduced to the cases of a ﬁnite-dimensional linear group and an
irreducible group. Moreover, for some types of groups this case coincides with the
irreducible case. For example, let G be a hypercentral group. If CG(B) = ⟨1⟩, then
G ≤GLn(F) where n = dimF (B). Remind that the ﬁnite-dimensional hypercentral
groups have been already described (see, for example, [14], Chapter 8). Therefore
we can assume that CG(B) = L ̸= ⟨1⟩. Let 1 ̸= x ∈L ∩ζ(G); then the mapping
φ : a −→a(x −1), a ∈A, is an FG - endomorphism. In particular, Kerφ and
Imφ are FG-submodules of A. By the selection of x, B ≤Ker φ. Since Kerφ ̸= A,
Kerφ = B, thus Imφ ∼= A/B. In other words, Imφ is a simple FG - module of
inﬁnite dimension. This means that A is a simple FG-module.
This example shows that the second case promises to be much more interesting.
Let B be a proper FG-submodule of A. If CG(B) = ⟨1⟩, then we can treat G as
a subgroup of GLn(F) where n = dimF B. We make the following deﬁnition.
Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G ≤GL(F, A). A group G is called a
quasi-irreducible if A satisﬁes the following conditions:

382
KURDACHENKO, SUBBOTIN
(QI 1) if B is a proper FG-submodule of A, then dimF B is ﬁnite;
(QI 2) A is the union of its proper FG-submodules.
(QI 3) CG(B) ̸= ⟨1⟩for every proper FG - submodule B of A.
We will say also that in this case A is a quasiﬁnite FG - module.
Clearly every quasiﬁnite module is artinian.
The ﬁrst natural step here is the description of hypercentral quasi-irreducible
linear groups and some groups that are near to them. These groups have been
considered in the paper [7]. We shall start with the main results of this paper.
Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F of countable dimension, {an|n ∈N} a
basis of A, ⟨x⟩an inﬁnite cyclic group. Deﬁne the action of x on A by the rule:
a1x = a1, an+1x = an+1 + an or a1(x −1) = 0, an+1(x −1) = an , n ∈N.
Then we can consider A as F⟨x⟩-module. It is easy to see that A is F⟨x⟩- hyper-
central, A = A(x −1) and every proper F⟨x⟩-submodule of A coincides with some
a1F + . . . + anF, n ∈N. In particular, the F⟨x⟩-module A is quasiﬁnite.
We will called this module a Pr¨ufer (x −1) - module (by analogy with a Pr¨ufer
p-group).
Theorem 8 [7]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a hypercentral sub-
group of GL(F, A). Suppose that G is a quasi-irreducible group. Then the following
assertions hold:
(i) G is abelian-by-ﬁnite;
(ii) the periodic part T of the group G is a p′ - subgroup of ﬁnite (special) rank
where p = char F;
(iii) T ∩ζ(G) is a locally cyclic subgroup.
(iv) ζ(G) contains an element x of inﬁnite order such that A = C1 ⊕. . . ⊕Cn
where Ci is a Pr¨ufer (x −1) - module, 1 ≤i ≤n.
We can treat the FC - center as a generalization of the center of a group. Starting
from the FC - center we can construct the upper FC- central series of G:
⟨1⟩= G0 ≤G1 ≤. . . Gα ≤Gα+1 ≤. . . Gγ
by the rule G1 = FC(G), Gα+1/Gα = FC(G/Gα), α < γ, FC(G/Gγ) = ⟨1⟩.
A group G is said to be FC - hypercentral if Gγ = G.
This deﬁnition implies that the class of FC - hypercentral groups is an extremely
wide extension of the class of hypercentral groups.
Theorem 9 [7]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G an FC - hyper-
central subgroup of GL(F, A). Suppose that G is a quasi-irreducible group. Then
the following assertions hold:
(i) G includes a normal abelian subgroup U of ﬁnite index;
(ii) the periodic part of U is a subgroup of ﬁnite (special) rank where p = char F;
(iii) if char F = p > 0, then Op(G) = ⟨1⟩.

ON SOME INFINITE DIMENSIONAL LINEAR GROUPS
383
(iv) U contains an element x of inﬁnite order such that A = C1 ⊕. . . ⊕Cn where
Ci is a Pr¨ufer (x −1)-module, 1 ≤i ≤n.
Now consider the dual situation. If G is an irreducible subgroup of GL(F, A),
then every non-zero FG - submodule of A coincides with A, in particular, it has
ﬁnite codimension. We consider the subgroups G ≤GL(F, A) with the following
property: every non-zero FG-submodule of A has ﬁnite codimension.
The following two cases appear here:
(i) A includes a simple FG-submodule B such that dimF (A/B) is ﬁnite;
(ii) every non-zero FG-submodule of A has ﬁnite codimension and the intersec-
tion of all these submodules is zero.
The ﬁrst case is reduced to the cases of a ﬁnite-dimensional linear group and
an irreducible group. Moreover, for some types of groups (as the quasiirreducible
groups) the ﬁrst case coincides with the irreducible case.
Let F be a ﬁeld, G a group.
An FG-module A is said to be a just inﬁnite-
dimensional, if it satisﬁes the following conditions:
(JI 1) if B is a non-zero FG-submodule of A, then dimF (A/B) is ﬁnite;
(JI 2) the intersection of all non-zero submodules of A is zero.
In particular, every just inﬁnite-dimensional FG-module A includes a non-zero
proper submodule B. If CG(A/B) = ⟨1⟩, then we can treat A as a subgroup of
GLn(F) where n = dimF (A/B). We make the following natural deﬁnition.
Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F. A group G ≤GL(F, A) is called almost
irreducible if A satisﬁes the following conditions:
(AI 1) an FG-module A is just inﬁnite-dimensional;
(AI 2) if B is a non-zero FG-submodule of A, then CG(A/B) ̸= ⟨1⟩.
Theorem 10 [8]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a hypercentral
subgroup of GL(F, A).
If G is almost irreducible, then the following assertions
hold:
(i) G is abelian-by-ﬁnite;
(ii) the periodic part T of the group G is a p′-subgroup of ﬁnite (special) rank
where p = char F;
(iii) T ∩ζ(G) is a locally cyclic subgroup.
Theorem 11 [8]. Let F be a ﬁeld, A a vector space over F, G a locally soluble
FC - hypercentral subgroup of GL(F, A). If G is a almost irreducible then
(i) G includes a normal abelian subgroup U of ﬁnite index;
(ii) the periodic part of U is a subgroup of ﬁnite (special) rank;
(iii) if char F = p > 0, then Op(G) = ⟨1⟩.
The following two statements have played an essential role in the proofs of these
two theorems above.

Proposition 3 [8]. Let F be a ﬁeld, G a group, H a normal subgroup having ﬁnite
index in G, X a transversal to H in G, A a just inﬁnite-dimensional FG-module,
CG(A) = ⟨1⟩. Then
(i) A includes an FH-submodule B, such that A/Bx is a just inﬁnite-dim-
ensional FH-module for every x ∈X;
(ii) ∩x∈XBx = ⟨0⟩, thus A is isomorphic with some FH-submodule of
⊕x∈X(A/Bx);
(iii) ∩x∈Xx−1CH(A/B)x = ⟨1⟩thus H is isomorphic with some subgroup of
Xx∈X(H/x−1CH(A/B)x).
Proposition 4 [8]. Let F be a ﬁeld, G a group, A a just inﬁnite-dimensional
FG-module, CG(A) = ⟨1⟩, x an element of inﬁnite order of ζ(G) such that A is
F⟨x⟩- torsion-free as an F⟨x⟩-module. Then F is imbedded into the ﬁeld K and
the FG-module A is imbedded into a KG-module R with the following properties:
(i) dimK R is ﬁnite;
(ii) R is a simple KG-module;
(iii) CG(R) = ⟨1⟩.

Abstract
A simple undirected graph is said to be semisymmetric if it is regular and edge-
transitive but not vertex-transitive.
This paper uses ﬁnite groups to construct
many inﬁnite families of such graphs.
1
Introduction
There is an intimate relationship between groups and graphs. For example, any
graph X gives rise to its automorphism group A := Aut(X). On the other hand,
any group G with generating set S gives rise to its Cayley graph Cay(G, S). The
main purpose of this paper is to show how groups can be used to construct examples
of semisymmetric graphs, graphs which are regular and edge-transitive but not
vertex-transitive. [Relevent deﬁnitions are given in Section 2.]
These semisymmetric graphs were ﬁrst systematically studied in 1967 by J.
Folkman [6].
For later works on semisymmetric graphs, the reader is referred
to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].
Since the known semisymmetric graphs are not many and since they have very
special symmetry properties, there is a common belief that semisymmetric graphs
are rare in number. We do not share this belief since our contruction leads to
inﬁnite classes of such graphs.
This paper is organized as follows. First we give the necessary notation, deﬁni-
tions, and concepts needed for this paper, including that of semisymmetric graphs.
In particular, we introduce the notion of co-neighbor blocks and noncontractable
graphs, and we also give the deﬁnition of a bi-lexicographic product of a graph.
Next we present a known construction of a graph from a group G and subgroups
L and R with an example which illustrates our main result. Finally we give two
types of group constructions of semisymmetric graphs.

(a) Groups G acting on sets X:
Let X be a G-set. (Unless otherwise speciﬁed, X and G are ﬁnite.) We will let xg
denote the action of the group element g ∈G on x ∈X. The G-set X is transitive
if, for any x, y ∈X, there exists g ∈G such that xg = y. The stabilizer Gx of
x ∈X consists of those elements in G which ﬁx x, that is, Gx = {g ∈G : xg = x}.
A subset B of X is called a G-block if, for any g ∈G, the sets Bg and B are
either disjoint or equal, that is, Bg ∩B = ∅or Bg = B. Note that ∅, X, and
singleton sets {x} are G-blocks. Any other G-block is said to be nontrivial.
Deﬁnition 2.1 A transitive G-set X is primitive if X contains no nontrivial G-
blocks.
The following well-known characterization of primitive G-sets will be used in our
main theorem.
Theorem 2.2 Let X be a transitive G-set. Then X is primitive if and only if, for
any x ∈X, the stabilizer Gx is a maximal subgroup of G.
(b) Graph notation
Let X denote a graph with vertex set V (X) and edge set E(X) and with auto-
morphism group A = Aut(X). We will sometimes denote such a graph by writing
X = X(V, E). Throughout this paper, X denotes a simple undirected graph, that
is, X has no loops and no multiple edges.
Given a graph X = X(V, E), we write uv for the edge in E with endpoints
u, v ∈V .
Such vertices u and v are said to be adjacent or neighbors.
Given
any vertex v ∈V , we write N(v) to denote its neighborhood, that is, its set of
neighbors. We also write deg (v) to denote the degree of v where deg (v) = |N(v)|
is the number of its neighbors.
X is called complete if any two vertices are adjacent. Kn is used to denote the
complete graph with n vertices.
X is called regular or k-regular if all vertices have the same degree k. Clearly,
the complete graph Kn is (n −1)-regular.
(c) Bipartite graphs
X = X(V, E) is bipartite if V is the disjoint union of U and W where each edge
uw has an endpoint in U and an endpoint in W. We denote such a bipartite graph
by writing X = [U, W]. We also write Km,n to denote the complete bipartite graph
X = [U, W], that is, where |U| = m and |W| = n and where each vertex in U is
adjacent to each vertex in W. Note that Kn,n is n-regular, but Km,n is not regular
when m ̸= n.
Figure 1 gives examples of three bipartite graphs. Graph (a) is not complete.
Graph (b) is the complete graph K2,3 and (c) is the complete graph K3,3.
Given a bipartite graph X = [U, W], we let A+ denote the following subgroup
of A = Aut(X):
A+ = ⟨g ∈A : Ug = U and W g = W⟩
That is, A+ consists of the automorphism of X which map U into U and W into
W. Moreover, if X is connected, then either |A : A+| = 2 or A = A+ according as
there does or does not exist an automorphism which interchanges U and W.

(d) Semisymmetric graphs
A graph X = X(V, E) is vertex-transitive if, for any two vertices u, v ∈V ,
there is an automorphism α ∈Aut(X) such that uα = v. Since an automorphism
preserves the degree of a vertex, any vertex-transitive graph must be regular.
Analagously, X = X(V, E) is edge-transitive if, for any two edges e, e′ ∈E, there
is an automorphism α ∈Aut(X) such that eα = e′.
Observe that the graph K2,3 in Figure 1(b) is edge-transitive, but it is not regular
so it is not vertex-transitive. Generally speaking, the graphs Kn and Kn,n are both
vertex and edge transitive. On the other hand, the bipartite graph Km,n, for m ̸= n,
is edge-transitive but it is neither regular nor vertex-transitive.
A bipartite graph X = [U, W] is said to be semitransitive if A+ acts (vertex)
transitively on both U and W. More generally, X = [U, W] is G-semitransitive if
G is a subgroup of A+ which acts transitively on U and W.
Deﬁnition 2.3 A graph X = X(V, E) is semisymmetric if it is regular and edge-
transitive but not vertex-transitive.
One can easily show that any semisymmetric graph must be bipartite with two
parts of equal size and it must be semitransitive. Accordingly, any example of a
semisymmetric graph must at least be a bipartite graph with two equal-size parts
and be semitransitive.
(e) Co-neighbor blocks and non-contractable graphs
Consider any graph X = X(V, E). Vertices x, x′ ∈V will be called co-neighbors if
they have the same set of neighbors, that is, if N(x) = N(x′). This is an equivalence
relation on V , and its equivalence clases will be called co-neighbor blocks of X.
The graph X = X(V, E) may be contracted to form a graph X′ = X′(V ′, E′) by
simply identifying co-neighbors. Speciﬁcally, consider any partition of each of the
co-neighbor blocks of X into cells. Then we deﬁne X′ = X′(V ′, E′) as follows:
V ′
=
{[x] : x ∈V and [x] is the cell containing x}
E′
=
{[x][y] : xy is an edge in E}
One can easily show that the graph X′ is well deﬁned. That is, if x and x′ are
co-neighbors and y and y′ are co-neighbors, then xy is an edge if and only if x′y′
is an edge. The graph X′ will be called a contraction of X.

388
LIPSCHUTZ, MING-YAO XU
We note that the adjacency matrix MX′ of X′ can be obtained from the adjacency
matrix MX of X by simply deleting identical rows (and corresponding columns)
which correspond to those vertices which are identiﬁed.
Any graph X = X(V, E) may be contracted to form a unique smallest graph
¯X = ¯X( ¯V , ¯E) by identifying all co-neighbors in X. Clearly, such a graph ¯X cannot
be contracted any further. This leads us to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.4 A graph X is said to be non-contractable if no two vertices are
co-neighbors or, equivalently, if every co-neighbor block in X has only one element.
(f) Bi-lexicographic Products
The above graph operation of contraction may be reversed. Speciﬁcally, any
graph X = X(V, E) may be expanded to form a graph X′′ = X′′(V ′′, E′′) as follows.
For each vertex x ∈X, assign a set Nx = {1, 2, ..., kx}. Then we deﬁne X′′ =
X′′(V ′′, E′′) as follows:
V ′′
=
{(x, i) : x ∈X, i ∈Nx} =

(x × Nx : x ∈X)
E′′
=
{(x, i)(y, j) : xy ∈E, i ∈Nx, j ∈Ny}
The graph X′′ will be called an expansion of X. Observe that if X′′ is an expansion
of X, then X is a contraction of X′′.
Consider now a bipartite graph X = [U, W]. Given any two positive integers
m and n, we deﬁne a particular expansion Y = X(m, n) of X as follows.
Let
Nk = {1, 2, .., k}. We assign Nm to each vertex u ∈U and we assign Nn to each
vertex w ∈W. Then Y = X(m, n) is the expansion of X deﬁned above. We note
that Y is a bipartite graph Y = [U × Nm, W × Nn], it will be called a bipartite
bi-lexicographic product of X.

Bi-coset graph
This section gives the construction with an example of a bipartite graph from a
group G and two subgroups L and R.
Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let L and R be two subgroups of G. Let D be
a union of several double cosets of R and L in G, that is, D = 
i RgiL. [We
emphasize that, in the double cosets of D, the subgroup R appears on the left and
L appears on the right.] We deﬁne a bipartite graph X = [U, W] as follows:
U = [G : L],
W = [G : R],
E(X) = {(Lg, Rdg) : g ∈G, d ∈D}
Here [G : H] denotes the set of right cosets of a subgroup H of G. This graph,
denoted by B(G, L, R; D), is called the bi-coset graph of G with respect to L, R,
and D. [It is a generalization of the concept of a Sabidussi coset graph (see [10]).]
Next we give an example of such a bi-coset graph X where D is the single coset
RL and D ̸= G.

Example 3.1 Consider the following group G, subgroups L and R, and double
coset D = RL:
G = A4, L = A3 = ⟨(123)⟩, R = {1, (12)(34)}, D = RL = L ∪(12)(34) · L
Note |G| = 12, |L| = 3, |R| = 2, |D| = 6. Also, L ∩R = 1 and so |L ∩R| = 1.
Furthermore, D ̸= G.
Figure 2 shows the bi-coset graph X = B(G, L, R; D) = [U, W]. We emphasize
that there is an edge uw in X if u = La and w = Rda where a ∈G and d ∈D.
Note that X is non-contractable since no two vertices have the same neighborhood.

Bi-coset Graph X = B(G, R, L; D) = [U, W]

LIPSCHUTZ, MING-YAO XU
The deﬁnition of the bi-coset graph X = B(G, R, L; D) does not assume that
L and R are diﬀerent subgroups of G. In the case that L = R, the cosets [G : L]
and [G : R] are still distinct sets of vertices of X, and we will use Lg and Rg to
denote diﬀerent vertices in X. If L = R = 1, then D is simply a subset of G. In
such a case, the bi-coset graph B(G, 1, 1; D) is called the bi-Cayley graph of G with
respect to D and is simply denoted by B(G, D).
Well-known basic properties of the bi-coset graph are contained in the following
two lemmas. For completeness we will prove them here.
Lemma 3.2 Let X = [U, W] = B(G, L, R; D) be a bi-coset graph of G with respect
to L, R, and D. Then:
(a) X is a well-deﬁned bipartite graph.
(b) The degree of a vertex u = Lg in U is |D|/|R| and of a vertex w = Rg in W
is |D|/|L|. Hence X is regular if and only if |L| = |R|.
(c) Aut(X) contains G and G acts transitively on U = [G : R] and on W = [G :
L] by (right) multiplication. Thus X is G-semitransitive.
(d) X is connected if and only if G is generated by D−1D.
Proof
(a) Suppose (La, Ra′) is an edge in X. Then a′a−1 = d where d ∈D.
Suppose La = Lb and Ra′ = Rb′. We need to show that (Lb, Rb′) is also an edge,
that is, that b′b−1 ∈D. We have b = la and b′ = ra′ where l ∈L and r ∈R. Then
b′b−1 = (ra′)(la)−1 = r(a′a−1)l = rdl ∈D
Thus X is well deﬁned.
(b) The degree of u = Lg is equal to the number of distinct elements in E =
{Rdg : d ∈D}. Note Rdg = Rd′g if and only if d′ = rd where r ∈R. Hence
deg (u) = |E| = |D|/|R|. Similaly, deg (w) = |D|/|R|.
(c) Group theory tells us that the right translations of G are automorphisms of
X and also Ug = U and W g = W. Thus X is G-semitransitive.
(d) X is connected if and only if each of U and W belong to a connected compo-
nent of X (since there is an edge from U to W). Also U (resp: W) is in a connected
component if and only if there is a path from L to any Lg (resp: R to any Rg′).
Suppose L, Rd1, Ld2d1, ..., Ld2s...d2d1 = Lg is such a path where di belongs to D or
D−1 according as i is odd or even. Then g ∈Ld2s...d2d1 ⊆⟨D−1D⟩. Accordingly,
G = ⟨D−1D⟩.
Conversely, suppose G ⊆⟨D−1D⟩. Let g ∈G, say g = d2s...d2d1 where di belongs
to D or D−1 according as i is odd or even. Then there is the path L, Rd1, ..., Lg
from L to Lg. Similarly, for any g′ ∈G, there is a path from R to Rg′. Thus X is
connected.
□
Lemma 3.3 Let X = B(G, R, L; D) be a bi-coset graph.
Then X is G-edge-
transitive if and only if D = RgL is a single double coset.
Proof
Suppose X is G-edge-transitive. Then, for any d, d′ ∈D, there is g ∈G
such that
(La, Rda)g = (Lb, Rd′b)

GROUPS AND SEMISYMMETRIC GRAPHS
391
Hence Lag = Lb. Thus agb−1 ∈L, say agb−1 = l. Also, Rdag = Rd′b, and so
Rdagb−1 = Rd′.
Hence Rdl = Rd′.
Thus dld′−1 ∈R, say dld′−1 = r.
Then
r−1dl = d′. Therefore, d and d′ belong to the same double coset RdL.
Conversely, suppose D is a single double coset RgL. Consider edges
(La, Rda) and (Lb, Rd′b)
Say d′ = rdl, r ∈R and l ∈L. Hence Rd′b = Rrdlb = Rdlb. Choose h = a−1lb.
Then
(La)h = Lah = La(a−1lb) = Llb = Lb
and
(Rda)h = Rdah = Rda(a−1lb) = Rdlb = Rrdlb = Rd′b
Thus X is G-edge-transitive.
□
Next we give an example to show how to construct a semisymmetric graph from
the bi-coset graph in Example 3.1.
Example 3.4 Consider the bi-coset graph X = [U, W] = B(G, R, L; D) in Exam-
ple 3.1. Choose m = 3 and n = 2 so m|L| = n|R| = 12. Form the bi-lexicographic
product Y = X(m, n) = [U ×N3, W ×N2] where each edge uw in X, corresponds to
six edges [u, i][w, j] in Y . Note ﬁrst that Y is 6-regular. Also, Y is semitransitive
and edge-transitive since X is semitransitive and edge-transitive.
Furthermore,
the co-neighbor block of each vertex [u, i] has three elements, [u, 1], [u, 2], [u, 3],
and the co-neighbor block of each vertex [w, j] has two elements, [w, 1] and [w, 2].
Thus no automorphism can map a vertex [u, i] into a vertex [w, j], so Y is not
vertex-transitive. Thus Y is a semisymmeytric graph.

Main results
Suppose G act on a graph X, that is, G is a subgroup of Aut(X). The next result is
essentially the converse of Lemma 3.2. Here Gv denotes the stabilizer of v, that is,
those elements g ∈G such that vg = v. Also, recall N(v) denotes the neighborhood
of a vertex v in X.
Proposition 4.1 Let X = [U, W] be a bipartite G-semitransitive graph. Let u ∈U
and w ∈W. Set
D = {g ∈G : wg ∈N(u)}
Let L = Gu and R = Gw. Then D is a union of double cosets of R and L in G,
and X ∼= B(G, L, R; D).
The following lemma is crucial for our purpose. The graph in Example 3.1 is an
example of this result.
Lemma 4.2 Let X = [U, W] be a non-contractable bipartite graph which is edge-
transitive and semitransitive. Assume |U| ̸= |W|. Let N = lcm(|U|, |W|) and let
m = N/|U| and n = N/|W|. Then the bi-lexicographic product Y = X(m, n) is a
semisymmetric graph.

392
LIPSCHUTZ, MING-YAO XU
Proof
Y is edge-transitive since X is edge-transitive. By hypothesis, X is non-
contractable, that is, its co-neighbor blocks have size one. Thus the co-neighbor
blocks of Y are of the form
{[u, i] : i ∈Nm} and {[w, i] : i ∈Nn}
which have diﬀerent sizes. Thus X is not vertex-transitive. On the other hand,
deg ([u, i]) = N(deg (u))/|W| = N(deg (w))/|U| = deg ([w, j])
Thus Y is regular.
□
Theorem 4.3 Let X = B(G, L, R; D) = [U, W] be a bipartite bi-coset graph of G
with respect to L, R, and D. Assume D = RgL is a single double coset. Then:
(1) X is a bipartite complete graph if and only if D = G.
(2) X is non-contractable if and only if the following conditions hold for any
x, y ∈G:
(a) For any x, y ∈G, Dx = Dy implies Lx = Ly.
(b) For any x, y ∈G, D−1x = D−1y implies Rx = Ry.
Proof
(1) The degree of a vertex of the form Lx is |D : R| and that of the form
Ry is |D : L|. Suppose D = G. Then the degree of Lx is |G : R| = |W| and that
of the form Ry is |G : L| = |U|. Thus Lx joins every right coset in W, and every
Ry joins every left coset in U. Thus X is a complete bipartite graph. Each step is
reversable, so the converse is also true.
(2a) The neighborhood of Lx follows:
N(Lx) = {Rdx : d ∈D} = {Rdlx : l ∈L}
Since D is a single double coset, the union of the neighbors of Lx is Dx. Similarly,
the union of the neighbors of Ly is Dy. Accordingly, if Lx ̸= Ly then Dx ̸= Dy
and hence Lx and Ly have diﬀerent neighborhoods.
(2b) Similarly, the union of the neighbors of Rx and Ry are, respectively, D−1x
and D−1y. Thus, if Rx ̸= Ry then Rx and Ry have diﬀerent neighborhoods.
Both conditions (2a) and (2b) imply X is non-contractable. The steps are easily
reversed, so the converse is also true.

Theorem 4.4 Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let L and R be two maximal subgroups
of G with diﬀerent orders. Let D = RL and suppose D ̸= G. Let X = [U, W] =
B(G, L, R; D) be the bipartite bi-coset graph. [Then G may be viewed as a group
acting on the set X.]
(a) X is not a complete bipartite graph.
(b) The bi-coset graph X = B(G, L, R; D) is noncontractable.
(c) Let N = lcm(|U|, |W|), and let m = N/|U| and n = N/|W|.
Then the
bi-lexicographic product Y = X(m, n) is a semisymmetric graph.

GROUPS AND SEMISYMMETRIC GRAPHS
393
Proof
(a) Since D ̸= G, X is not a complete bipartite graph by Theorem 4.3.
(b) Consider a vertex u = Lx ∈U. Let
B = {b ∈U : N(b) = N(u)}
Then B is the co-neighbor block containing Lx = u. Then, for any g ∈G, Bg
is also a co-neighbor block. Since the co-neighbor blocks form a partition, either
Bg ∩B = ∅or Bg = B. Thus the co-neighbor blocks are G-blocks where we view
G as a group acting on X. [See Section 2(a).]
Furthermore, the stabilizier Gu of any vertex u = Lx is x−1Lx and the stabilizer
Gw of any vertex w = Ry is y−1Ry. Since L and R are maximal subgroups of G, so
are the stabilizers Gu and Gw. Since X is a transitive G-set, Theorem 2.1 tells us
that X is primitive. Thus the G-blocks or, in other words, the co-neighbor blocks
of X are trivial. Thus X is noncontractable.
(c) Part (b) shows that the hypothesis of Lemma 4.2 is satisﬁed. Thus Y =
X(m, n) is a semisymmetric graph.
□
Example 4.5 Let G = Sn, the symmetric group acting on {1, 2, ..., n} with n ≥5.
Let L = Gn, the stabilizer of n. Thus L ∼= Sn−1. Let R = G{n−1,n}, the setwise
stabilizer of n −1, n. Thus R ∼= Sn−2 × S2. It is known that L and R are maximal
subgroups of G. Let D = RL. Then |D| = |R||L|/|R∩L| = 2(n−1)!. Thus D ̸= G.
By Theorem 4.4, X = B(G, L, R; D) = [U, W] is a semisymmetric graph.
(a) For n = 5, |U| = 5 and |W| = 10.
Then X has 2 × 10 = 20 vertices.
This graph was ﬁrst discovered by Folkman who proved [6] that it is the smallest
semisymmetric graph, that is, the one with the minimal number of vertices.
(b) Generally speaking, the above semisymmetric graphs X will have 2n(n −1)
vertices or n(n −1) vertices according as n is even or odd.
(c) Letting n = 4 in the above example, we get R ∼= S2×S2 which is not maximal
in G = S4. Hence we cannot use Theorem 4.4. However, X = B(S4, L, R; D) is
still a semisymmetric graph. In fact, it is the graph in Example 3.1.
Example 4.6 This is a generalization of the graph in Example 4.1. Let G = Sn,
and suppose 1 < i < j ≤n/2.
Let L = G{1,...,i}, R = G{1,...,j}, D = RL.
Again L and R are maximal subgroups of G, and D ̸= G. Thus by Theorem 4.4,
X = B(G, L, R; D) is a semisymmetric graph.
Example 4.7 Let q = ps, an odd prime power. Let G = PGL(2, q). Then G
has maximal subgroups L = D2(q−1) and R = D2(q+1), where Dk is the dihedral
group of order k.
Choose an L and R such that |L ∩R| = 4.
Let D = RL.
Then |D| = (q −1)(q + 1) whereas |G| = q(q −1)(q + 1).
Thus D ̸= G, and
X = B(G, L, R; D) gives another inﬁnite family of semisymmetric graphs.
5
Problems
We now state a number of open problems.
Example 4.5(c) shows that the maximality of L and R in G in Theorem 4.4 is
suﬃcient, but not necessary, for X = B(G, L, R; D) to be non-contractable.

Abstract
A cover for a group is a collection of proper subgroups whose union is the whole
group. We report some recent results concerning the diﬀerent covers of a ﬁnite
group.
1
Minimal covers
Let G be a group. A cover of G is a collection A = {Ai|1 ≤i ≤n} of proper
subgroups of G whose union is G. The subgroups in A are called the components
of the cover. The cover is irredundant if no proper sub-collection is also a cover.
The cover is minimal if no cover of G has fewer than n members. In this case, J. H.
E. Cohn [8] deﬁned σ(G) to be this minimal number of subgroups. It is clear that
to study σ(G), it is enough to consider covers consisting of maximal subgroups.
A number of results were proved for soluble groups. In particular it was proved
in 1997 by Tomkinson in [14] that if G is a ﬁnite noncyclic soluble group, then
σ(G) = pa + 1, where pa is the order of a particular chief factor of G. In fact, he
proves that
Theorem 1.1 [14] Let G be a ﬁnite soluble group and let H/K be the smallest chief
factor of G having more than one complement in G. Then σ(G) = |H/K| + 1.
In his paper he suggested that it might be of interest to investigate σ(G) for
families of simple groups.
In 1999, Bryce, Fedri and Serena calculated σ(G) for the groups PSL(2, q),
PGL(2, q), SL(2, q) and GL(2, q). They prove the following:
Theorem 1.2 [4] Let G be PSL(2, q), PGL(2, q), SL(2, q) and GL(2, q) and q =
4, 8 or q ≥11, then
σ(G) = q(q + 1)
2
if q is even
σ(G) = q(q + 1)
2
+ 1
if q is odd.
A similar result can be obtained for other groups with a partition. In fact if G
has a partition with n subgroups, we have σ(G) ≤n, because a partition is a cover.
In particular we can calculate σ(G) for the family of Suzuki groups.

Proposition 1.3 Let G = Sz(q) be a Suzuki group, where q = 22m+1, then we
have
σ(G) = q2(q2 + 1)
2
.
Proof Let G = Sz(q) ≤GL(4, q) be a Suzuki group, where q = 22m+1, m a positive
integer and let r = 2m+1. Then |G| = q2(q −1)(q2 + 1) and (q −r + 1)(q + r + 1) =
q2 + 1. Let U be the subgroup of the lower unitriangular matrices of G: then U
is a 2-Sylow subgroup of exponent 4 and of order q2. Let H be the subgroup of
the diagonal matrices of G.
Then H is isomorphic to the multiplicative group
of the ﬁeld, and therefore has order q −1; it is a π(q −1)-Hall subgroup of G
and it normalizes U. By Theorem 3.10, chapter XI of [10] we get that the set
Ψ = {Ug, Hg, T g
1 , T g
2 } is a partition of G, where T1 is a cyclic maximal torus of
order q + r + 1 and T2 is a cyclic maximal torus of order q −r + 1. By [15] the
only maximal subgroup of G containing Ti is Ni = NG(Ti) = Ti < ti >, with ti an
element of order 4 and |Ni : Ti| = 4, for i = 1, 2.
Let now A be a minimal cover of G with maximal components.
Since Ti is
cyclic and Ni is the only maximal subgroup containing it (for i = 1, 2), all the
conjugates of N1 and N2 must be among the components of A. Moreover N1 is
maximal, and therefore self-normalizing, so the number of distinct conjugates of
N1 is q2(q −1)(q −r + 1)/4, while the number of distinct conjugates of N2 is
q2(q −1)(q + r + 1)/4. We observe that the 2-elements are contained in the union
of the conjugates of N1. In fact there exists two conjugacy classes of elements of
order 4 and one class of elements of order 2. Moreover the elements of order 4 are
not real, that is if |x| = 4, then x−1 is not conjugate to x (see [15] ).
Since t1 is of order 4 and t1 ∈N1, then t−1
1
and t2
1 belongs to N1. Therefore the
conjugacy classes [t1], [t−1
1 ] and [t2
1] are contained in the union 
g Ng
1 . Since Ψ is
a partition, the π(q −1)-elements are contained in some conjugate of H, and none
of them can belong to N =
g Ng
1 ∪
g Ng
2 . Therefore, since Hg is cyclic, A must
contain a maximal subgroup of G containing Hg, for any g ∈G. By [15], there are
two kinds of maximal subgroups containing Hg and these are
NG(U)g = (UH)g = Bg, the Borel subgroups of G
NG(H)g = (H < t >)g, where t ̸∈U is an involution.
The only elements of G not belonging to N are the π(q −1)-elements, then
we can substitute the components NG(H)g with Bg. We therefore consider the
subgroups Bg. Since B is a Frobenius group, there are q2 conjugates of H in B
and there are q2(q2 + 1)/2 conjugates of H in G, since |NG(H)| = 2|H|.
We now want to examine the intersection of the Borel subgroup B with its
conjugates. To do this we need the following two facts (see [10] or [7])
i) B ∩Bt = H
ii) any element of G\B can be written uniquely in the form g = btu, with b ∈B
and u ∈U.
Therefore, if g ∈G\B, we have B∩Bg = Hu, where u is the unique element of U
such that g = btu. It follows that if Bg1 ̸= Bg2, then B ∩Bg1 ̸= B ∩Bg2. Therefore

ON THE COVERS OF FINITE GROUPS
397
there are q2 + (q2 −1) conjugates of H in B ∪Bg, if g ∈G \ B, and so on. If we
consider the union of n conjugates of B, this union contains n−1
i=0 (q2−i) conjugates
of H. Hence to get all the conjugates of H, we need at least q2 conjugates of B.
In fact
q2−1

i=0
(q2 −i) =
q2

i=1
i = q2(q2 + 1)
2
.
It follows that
σ(G) ≥q2 + q2(q −1)(q −r + 1)/4 + q2(q −1)(q + r + 1)/4 = q2(q2 + 1)/2.
On the other hand, the elements of G are either contained in the conjugates
of the subgroups H, T1 and T2 or are 2-elements, and therefore contained in N.
Therefore
A = {Ng
1 , Ng
2 , Bx|g ∈G, x ∈G \ B}
is a minimal cover of G.
We ﬁnally observe that any minimal cover of G is of this type: it contains N
and all except one conjugate of B.

Covers with conjugate subgroups
It is well known that a ﬁnite group G is never the set-theoretical union of the
G-conjugates of a proper subgroup H, that is the family
I = {Hig | H < G, ig ∈Inn(G)}
can never be a cover.
Brandl in [2] considers the covers
δ = {Hα : H ≤G,
α ∈Aut(G)}
and shows how some properties of H extends to G.
Praeger in [12] and [13] explores the more general covers
Φ = {Hα : α ∈A} where Inn(G) ≤A ≤Aut(G)
to study the covers of the Galois group of certain extensions of ﬁelds. She proves
that H and G must have the same composition factors. In particular there is no
such a cover, if G is a simple group.
Another way to extend the family is to consider the G-conjugates of H and
another subgroup K or the set of the G-conjugates of K.
In some cases it is
possible to cover the group G. This happens, for example, in a Frobenius group
G if H and K are respectively a complement and the kernel. In [5] two kinds of
collections of subgroups for a group G were introduced:
(∗)
δ = {Hg, K : g ∈G},
(∗∗)
δ = {Hg, Kg : g ∈G},

398
LUCIDO
where H and K are ﬁxed proper subgroups of G. If a group G is the set-theoretical
union of subgroups of the type (∗) or (∗∗), then G is said respectively (∗)-coverable
or (∗∗)-coverable and the subgroups in δ are called the components of the cover.
The characterization of the (∗)-coverable groups in [5] shows that no simple group
is (∗)-coverable. But it is easily seen that there exist simple (∗∗)-coverable groups.
In fact it can be proved the following
Theorem 2.1 i)[5] G is (∗)-coverable if and only if G is a Frobenius-Wielandt
group.
ii) [5] The alternating group An is (∗∗)-coverable if and only if 4 ≤n ≤8 and
the symmetric group Sn is (∗∗)-coverable if and only if 3 ≤n ≤6.
iii) [6] The groups PSL(n, q), PGL(n, q), SL(n, q) and GL(n, q) are (∗∗)-coverable
if and only if 2 ≤n ≤4.
In [3] the (∗∗)-covers of the Symmetric groups are applied to the algebraic number
theory.
For a ﬁnite simple group of Lie type G, it is reasonable to expect that G is
(∗∗)-coverable if and only if G has small rank.
3
Hall covers
We deﬁne a Hall cover of a ﬁnite group G as a set H = {H1, H2, . . . , Hr} of proper
Hall subgroups of G such that:
a) r
i=1 Hi = G
b) either |Hi| = |Hj| or (|Hi|, |Hj|) = 1 for i, j = 1, ..., r.
If the elements of H all have order a prime power, then H is called a Sylow cover
of G. The ﬁnite groups G with a Sylow cover have been studied independently by
G. Higman ([9]) and G. Zacher ( [16], [17]) in the case in which G is soluble, by M.
Suzuki ([15]) in the case of a simple group G and by R. Brandl ([1]) in the general
situation.
Theorem 3.1 Let G be a ﬁnite group with a Sylow cover. Then G is one of the
following
i) G is soluble and let p be a prime such that Op(G) ̸= 1. Then if p is odd,
G/Op(G) is cyclic of prime power order or a generalized quaternion group, oth-
erwise G/Op(G) is a group of order paqb with cyclic Sylow subgroups, where q =
kpa + 1 a prime.
ii) G is one of the following ﬁnite (almost) simple groups:
PSL(2, 4), PSL(2, 7), PSL(2, 8), PSL(2, 9), PSL(2, 17), PSL(3, 4), Sz(8), Sz(32),
the non split extension of PSL(2, 9).
iii) G has a nontrivial normal 2-subgroup P and G/P is isomorphic with PSL(2, 4),
PSL(2, 8), Sz(8), Sz(32). Moreover P is elementary abelian and isomorphic with
a direct sum of natural modules for G/P.

In the paper [11], Jabara and Lucido study the groups which admit a Hall cover.
They prove
Theorem 3.2 [11] Let G be a simple non abelian group, such that G admits a Hall
cover. Then G is one of the following:
PSL(2, q), PSL(3, 4), PSL(3, q) with (3, q −1) = 1,
2B2(22n+1), A7, M22.

Abstract
Groupland is a ﬂat planet where groups live in regions deﬁned by their properties,
e.g. residually ﬁnite groups, groups of diﬀerent growth types, locally graded groups,
etc. This visualizes relations of properties, and formulation of problems, such as,
for example, where do Engel groups live?
A law u(x1, ..., xn) = v(x1, ..., xn) is called positive if u, v are written without
inverses of variables. The simplest examples are xy = yx and xn+1 = x, n > 0. If a
group G satisﬁes a positive law, then the variety var(G) has a basis of positive laws
[11]. We note that groups satisfying positive laws can not contain a free non-abelian
subsemigroup, denoted by F.
In Fig.1 of Groupland we indicate the regions: of groups which have no laws,
groups with only non-positive laws, and groups satisfying positive laws.
All groups containing a free non-abelian subsemigroup F are in the right half of
Groupland. Groups in the left half do not contain F.
Fig.1, Groupland
We need the following results.
Lemma 1
(a) If a group G is nilpotent-by-(ﬁnite exponent), then G satisﬁes a positive law.
(b) If a ﬁnitely generated group G is soluble-by-ﬁnite, then either G is nilpotent-by-
ﬁnite or G contains F.
(c) If G is a ﬁnitely generated periodic residually ﬁnite group which satisﬁes a
nontrivial law, then G is ﬁnite.
Proof (a) It was shown independently in [13] and [16], that nilpotent groups satisfy
positive laws.
So if a variety Nc of c-nilpotent groups satisﬁes a positive law
u(x1, ..., xc) =v(x1, ..., xc), then a nilpotent-by-Burnside variety NcBe satisﬁes the
positive law u(xe
1, ..., xe
c)=v(xe
1, ..., xe
c).

GROUPLAND
401
(b) It is shown in [19] 4.7, that a ﬁnitely generated soluble group with no free
subsemigroup on two generators must be polycyclic.
Also by [19] 4.12, if G is
a polycyclic group, then G either has a nilpotent subgroup of ﬁnite index or G
contains a free subsemigroup on two generators. These imply (b).
(c) This result can be found in [27] IV.2.6. □
Since 1953 it was conjectured that a group satisﬁes positive laws if and only if it is
an extension of a nilpotent group by a group of ﬁnite exponent. A counterexample
was found only in 1996 [17], where it was shown that there exist groups satisfying
positive laws, which are not even (locally soluble)-by-(ﬁnite exponent). By [1], rel-
atively free groups of prime exponent ≥665 and of ﬁnite rank > 1 have exponential
growth. In Fig.2 of Groupland these groups are in the region with the small star.
We add now four more regions to the picture.
Statement 1 Fig.2 of Groupland shows the regions of:
(i) groups of polynomial growth (hatched pattern),
(ii) torsion groups of intermediate growth (a small white circle),
(iii) polycyclic groups (a small inner grey ellipse),
(iv) residually ﬁnite groups (a large dotted ellipse).
Proof (i) By results of Gromov [6], Milnor [14] and Wolf [26], a group G has poly-
nomial growth if and only if it is nilpotent-by-ﬁnite. So by Lemma 1 (a), groups
of polynomial growth satisfy positive laws.
(ii) All known ﬁnitely generated inﬁnite torsion groups of exponent zero, in partic-
ular the groups of intermediate growth, are residually ﬁnite and hence by Lemma
1 (c), they do not satisfy any law (see e.g. [1], ([15], 34.63), [5], [7], [23]).
(iii) The region of polycyclic groups is deﬁned by Lemma 1 (b). As an example
of a polycyclic group containing F we have the group G = ⟨a, b, c | [a, b] = 1, ac =
ab, bc =a2b⟩, which by ([15] 32.35) generates the whole metabelian variety A2. So
G is not nilpotent-by-ﬁnite and hence by Lemma 1 (b), it contains F.
(iv) By P. Hall, nilpotent-by-ﬁnite groups are residually ﬁnite [8], and polycyclic
groups are also residually ﬁnite ([15] 32.1). □
Fig.2, Groupland
We denote by Be the Restricted Burnside variety of exponent e, i.e. the variety
generated by all ﬁnite groups of exponent e. All groups in Be are locally ﬁnite
of exponent e. The existence of such varieties for each positive integer e follows

402
MACEDO´NSKA
from the positive solution of the Restricted Burnside Problem and relies on the
classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups (see [25]). Clearly SnBe ⊆SnBe.
Deﬁnition [2] We deﬁne an SB-group to be one lying in some product of ﬁnitely
many varieties each of which is either soluble or a Be (for varying e).
In particular the class of SB-groups contains all groups G which are soluble-by-
(locally ﬁnite of ﬁnite exponent), that is G ∈SnBe for some n, e.
Statement 2 Fig.3 of Groupland contains new regions of:
(i) SB-groups (inner horizontal ellipse),
(ii) groups which are nilpotent-by-(locally ﬁnite of ﬁnite exponent), G ∈NcBk for
some c, k (lined and hatched regions).
Proof (i) As an example of an SB-group containing F, we have a free metabelian
group of rank > 1 [13]. SB-groups without F may satisfy positive laws as, for
example, nilpotent-by-ﬁnite groups. However a cartesian product of metabelian
nilpotent groups of increasing nilpotency class need not satisfy positive laws.
(ii) It follows from [2] Thm.B, that an SB-group G satisﬁes a positive law if and
only if G is nilpotent-by-(locally ﬁnite of ﬁnite exponent). So the intersection of
regions of SB-groups and groups satisfying positive laws coincides with the region
of groups which are nilpotent-by-(locally ﬁnite of ﬁnite exponent). □

Locally Graded Groups
A group G is said to be locally graded if every nontrivial ﬁnitely generated
subgroup of G has a proper subgroup of ﬁnite index. The class of locally graded
groups contains all locally ﬁnite groups, locally soluble groups, residually ﬁnite
groups and all SB-groups.
Statement 3 Fig.4 of Groupland shows the region of the class of locally graded
groups (the region inside the dashed ellipse, including the solid ellipse.
Proof We have to check that locally graded groups which satisfy a positive law
are nilpotent-by-(locally ﬁnite of ﬁnite exponent. For ﬁnitely generated groups this
follows from Theorem A [10], and then for any group, from Theorem B (ii) [4]. □

GROUPLAND

Question In which region of Groupland do Engel groups live?
The question whether every n-Engel group is locally nilpotent dates
from 1936, when Zorn proved that a ﬁnite n-Engel group is nilpotent. Positive
answers are known for soluble Engel groups (Gruenberg, 1953), residually ﬁnite
Engel groups (Wilson, 1991), proﬁnite Engel groups (Wilson and Zelmanov, 1992),
see [3]. The problem is still open in general.
The question whether n-Engel group satisﬁes a positive law was posed
by Shirshov in 1963 [22]. He proved that 2-Engel law [[x, y], y] is equivalent to
xy2x = yx2y, and 3-Engel law is equivalent to two positive laws. Then in [12] Maj
et al. proved that every torsion-free 4-Engel group satisﬁes positive laws. In 1998
Traustason [24] proved that every 4-Engel group satisﬁes positive laws. For n > 4
the problem is open.
However in the class of locally graded groups the answer is known. It was shown
by Kim and Rhemtulla 1995 [10], that every locally graded n-Engel group is locally
nilpotent. Then by result of Burns and Medvedev 1998 [3], every locally graded
n-Engel group is contained in a variety Nc(n)Be(n) ∩Be(n)Nc(n), and hence satisﬁes
a positive law.

Abstract
In this paper, we prove the existence of injectors in any group for the class of nilpo-
tent π-groups. We also prove that in a soluble group G, the number of conjugacy
classes of G/Oπ(F(G)) is bounded by the index of an injector of this class.
1
Introduction
All groups considered are ﬁnite and if π is a set of primes, we will denote by Nπ
the class of all nilpotent π-groups. Notice that if π = {p}, it coincides with the
class of p-groups and if π = P, it coincides with the class of nilpotent groups.
Some properties of this class were analyzed by H. Bender in [1]. In this paper,
H. Bender aﬃrms that if G is a π-constrained group (C ¯G(F( ¯G)) ≤F( ¯G) where
¯G = G/Oπ′(G)), Fπ(G) denotes the set of (nilpotent) π-subgroups X of G such
that ¯XF( ¯G) is nilpotent and F∗
π(G) are the maximal elements of this set, these
families of subgroups behave like p-subgroups, since they satisfy the following:
1. If X ≤Y ∈Fπ(G) then X ∈Fπ(G).
2. If X, Y ∈Fπ(G) and Y ≤NG(X) then XY ∈Fπ(G).
3. If N ⊴G then N is a π-constrained group, Fπ(N) = Fπ(G)∩N and F∗
π(N) =
Fπ(G) ∩N.
4. F∗
π(G) is a conjugacy class of subgroups of G.
It is not diﬃcult to prove that if G is a π-constrained group then InjNπ(G) =
F∗
π(G) and hence we have the existence and conjugation of the Nπ-injectors in
π-constrained groups. Moreover we have that if G is π-constrained then
InjNπ(G) = {H | H ∈Hallπ(I) where ¯I ∈InjN ( ¯G)}
and if H is an Nπ-injector of G then ¯I is an N-injector of ¯G. Recall that if F is a
Fitting class, a subgroup I of G is a F-injector of G whenever I ∩N is a maximal
F-subgroup of N for every subnormal subgroup N of G.
An important problem in Fitting classes is to prove the existence of injectors
in any group with respect to a Fitting class F.
We ﬁnd several results which
solve this problem for certain families of Fitting classes. For instance, in [2] it is

proved that every group has nilpotent injectors and in [6], it is proved that if all F-
constrained groups have F-injectors, then all groups have F-injectors, where F is
an homomorph and Fitting class such that EZF = F. In particular, if F is a class
of quasinilpotent groups containing the class of nilpotent groups, then every group
has F-injectors. In the ﬁrst section we will prove the existence of Nπ-injectors in
any group. Now, it is clearly true that Nπ does not satisfy the property EZF = F,
so the techniques and the results of [6] do not apply.
If G is a group, k(G) will denote the number of conjugacy classes of G. In the
second section we will analize a question introduced in [5] about the bound in a
soluble group G of k(G/GF) by |G : I| where F is a Fitting class and I is an
F-injector of G. This paper shows that the answer to this question is aﬃrmative
for the classes of p-groups and nilpotent groups in Theorems A and B respectively.
In the second section we will prove that the answer is aﬃrmative for class Nπ.
2
The existence of Nπ-injectors
In this section we prove the existence of the Nπ-injectors in any ﬁnite group. For
this purpose, the following results will be useful:
Proposition 2.1 Let G be a group and π a set of primes.
If I/Oπ′(G) ∈InjNπ(G/Oπ′(G)) and H ∈Hallπ(I) then H ∈InjNπ(G).
Proof Since I/Oπ′(G) is a π-group, we have that HOπ′(G) = I.
Suppose that N ⊴⊴G satisfying H ∩N ≤L ≤N where L ∈Nπ. Then:
(H ∩N)Oπ′(G)/Oπ′(G) ≤LOπ′(G)/Oπ′(G) ≤NOπ′(G)/Oπ′(G).
We will show that (H ∩N)Oπ′(G) = I ∩NOπ′(G).
Since N ∩I ⊴⊴
I ∈Sπ′Sπ, N ∩I ∈Sπ′Sπ.
Moreover, as H ∈Hallπ(I)
and N ∩I ⊴⊴
I, H ∩N ∈Hallπ(N ∩I). From this, it follows that N ∩I =
(H ∩N)Oπ′(N ∩I).
Therefore I ∩NOπ′(G) = Oπ′(G)(N ∩I) = Oπ′(G)(H ∩N)Oπ′(N ∩I) =
Oπ′(G)(H ∩N).
Thus Oπ′(G)(H ∩N) = LOπ′(G) and then |H ∩N| = |L| and H ∩N = L.
From this, we can conclude that H ∈InjNπ(G).
2
Notice that subgroup I in the above result has π-Hall subgroups, since I is a
π-soluble group.
Lemma For any Fitting class F of groups and any group G, let E1, . . . , En be
a set of F-components such that it is invariant under conjugation by elements of
G. Let Fi ∈InjF(Ei) and put F = ⟨F1, . . . , Fn⟩. Then InjF(NG(F)) ⊆InjF(G).
(Theorem 2.1 of [7])
Theorem 2.2 If G is a group then InjNπ(G) ̸= ∅.

ON MAXIMAL NILPOTENT π-SUBGROUPS
407
Proof Suppose the theorem is false, and let G be a minimal counterexample.
If Oπ′(G) ̸= 1, there exists I/Oπ′(G) ∈InjNπ(G/Oπ′(G)) and H ∈Hallπ(I).
Using proposition 1, we obtain that H ∈InjNπ(G).
Therefore we can suppose that Oπ′(G) = 1.
Let E1, E2, . . . , Er be the components of G and let I = I1I2 . . . Ir where Ii is a
maximal Nπ-subgroup of Ei containing Oπ(F(Ei)).
If NG(I) ̸= G then, by minimality of G, we have that InjNπ(NG(I)) ̸= ∅. Then,
using the above lemma, we obtain that ∅̸= InjNπ(NG(I)) ⊆InjNπ(G).
Hence we can suppose that I ⊴G and as Ii ≤I ∩Ei ≤Ei, we have that
Ii = I ∩Ei ⊴Ei. Thus, as Oπ′(Ei) = 1, Z(Ei) is a π-group so Z(Ei) ≤Ii. From
this, Ii/Z(Ei) ⊴Ei/Z(Ei) which is simple. Thus Ii ≤Z(Ei) and then Z(Ei) is
an Nπ-maximal subgroup of Ei. Therefore Z(Ei) is a Hall π-subgroup of Ei and
Ei = Z(Ei) × Hi where Hi is a Hall π′-subgroup of Ei. Since Ei es perfect group
we can conclude that Ei = 1, 1 ≤i ≤r. Hence G is an N-constrained group
satisfying Oπ′(G) = 1, therefore G is π-constrained and then InjNπ(G) ̸= ∅, which
is a contradiction.
2
It is known that if G possesses a single conjugacy class of nilpotent injectors
then G is an N-constrained group ([6]). The analogous result for class Nπ does
not generally hold, that is, there exist groups with a single conjugacy class of Nπ-
injectors that are not π-constrained, because if we consider G = A5 and π = {2},
by Sylow’s theorem, the Nπ-injectors of G are the Sylow 2-subgroups which are
conjugate, but G/Oπ′(G) = G/O{3,5}(G) ∼= G which is not an N-constrained
group.
Recall that if G is a group, A(2, G) denotes the set of subgroups with maximum
order among the nilpotent subgroups of G with nilpotency class less or equal than
2 and NI(G) denotes the set of the maximal nilpotent subgroups of G containing
an element of A(2, G).
It is known that if G is an N-constrained group then
InjN (G) = NI(G).
Deﬁnition 2.3 If G is a group, we deﬁne Aπ(2, G) as the set of the Nπ-subgroups
of G with nilpotency class less or equal than 2.
Proposition 2.4 Let G be a π-constrained group and let A be a π-subgroup of G.
Then, the following statements are equivalent:
1. A ∈Aπ(2, G).
2. ¯A ∈A(2, ¯G).
Proof If A ∈Aπ(2, G) then ¯A ∼= A has a nilpotency class less or equal than 2.
If ¯R ∈A(2, ¯G) then, by Theorem B in [4] we obtain that ¯RF( ¯G) is nilpotent
and since ¯G is N-constrained, we have that ¯R is a π-group.
Consequently, if
H ∈Hallπ(R), R = HOπ′(G) and H ∼= ¯R ∈Nπ with a nilpotency class less or
equal than 2, then |H| ≤|A|. Hence | ¯R| = | ¯H| ≤| ¯A| and ¯A ∈A(2, ¯G).
Reciprocally, if ¯A ∈A(2, ¯G) then A ∈Nπ with nilpotency class less or equal
than 2 and if B ∈Aπ(2, G) we have ¯B has a nilpotency class less or equal than 2.
Hence | ¯B| ≤| ¯A| and thus |B| ≤|A| and A ∈Aπ(2, G).

Deﬁnition 2.5 If G is a group, we deﬁne NIπ(G) as the set of maximal nilpotent
π-subgroups of G containing an element in Aπ(2, G).
Theorem 2.6 If G is a π-constrained group then InjNπ(G) = NIπ(G).
Proof If I ∈InjNπ(G) then ¯I ∈InjN ( ¯G) and thus there exists ¯R ∈A(2, ¯G) such
that ¯R ≤¯I. If Rπ ∈Hallπ(R) then, using the above proposition, Rπ ∈Aπ(2, G)
and Rπ ≤IOπ′(G). Then, there exists g ∈G such that Rg
π ≤I and then Rg
π ∈
Aπ(2, G).
Reciprocally, let I ∈NIπ(G). Then, if A ∈Aπ(2, G) such that A ≤I we have
that ¯A ∈A(2, ¯G) and ¯A ≤¯I.
We will show that ¯I is a maximal nilpotent subgroup of ¯G. If ¯J is a maximal
nilpotent subgroup of ¯G containing ¯I, since C ¯G( ¯A) ≤¯A we have that ¯J is a π-group.
Therefore, if Jπ ∈Hallπ(J), IOπ′(G) ≤J = JπOπ′(G), so there exists g ∈J
such that I ≤Jg
π ∈Nπ and hence, by Nπ-maximality of I, we obtain that I = Jg
π
and thus |I| = |Jπ| and ¯I ≤¯J. Hence, ¯I = ¯J and ¯I contains an element of A(2, ¯G).
Consequently, ¯I is an N-injector of ¯G and then I is an Nπ-injector of G.
2
Returning to the conjugacy of maximal Nπ-subgroups in any group we obtain:
Proposition 2.7 Let N ≤G satisfying CG(N) ≤NOπ′(G).
Suppose X1, X2
are Nπ-maximal subgroups of G such that N ≤X1 ∩X2. Then X1 and X2 are
conjugate.
Proof
We have that C ¯G( ¯N) = CG(N) ≤¯N.
We shall see that ¯
Xi is a maximal nilpotent subgroup of ¯G, i = 1, 2.
Let i ∈{1, 2} and suppose ¯
Xi ≤¯J, where J is a nilpotent subgroup of ¯G. Then,
since ¯J contains ¯N satisfying C ¯G( ¯N) ≤¯N, it follows that ¯J is a π-group. Thus
there exists a π-subgroup R of J such that J = ROπ′(G).
Hence, since XiOπ′(G) ≤ROπ′(G), Xi is a π-subgroup of ROπ′(G). Thus there
exists g ∈ROπ′(G) such that Xi ≤Rg and since R ∼= J/Oπ′(G), which is a
nilpotent π-group, we have that Xi = Rg.
Thus we obtain that ¯
Xi = Rg = (ROπ′(G))g/Oπ′(G) = ¯R = ¯J.
Now C ¯G( ¯N) ≤¯N ≤¯
X1 ∩¯
X2 and using Proposition 2 in [9] there exists g ∈G
such that ¯
X1
¯g = ¯
X2. Hence X1gOπ′(G) = X2Oπ′(G) and since X1g and X2 are
Hall π-subgroups of X2Oπ′(G), there exists h ∈X2Oπ′(G) such that X1gh = X2
and ﬁnally X1 and X2 are conjugate in G.

Lemma If G is a ﬁnite group and N ⊴G then:
k(G) ≤k(G/N)k(N)
We shall see in this section that in a soluble group G, the number of conjugacy
classes of G/Oπ(F(G)) is bounded by the index in G of an Nπ-injector.
We will denote by F = Sπ′ ⋄Nπ = {G | G/Oπ′(G) ∈Nπ} which is a Fitting
homomorph. First of all, we will prove the following result:
Lemma 3.1 If G ∈F and π ⊆π(G) then:
k(G/Oπ(G)) ≤|G|π′.
Proof
We argue by induction on |G|.
If Oπ(G) ̸= 1 then G/Oπ(G) ∈F and by induction:
k(G/Oπ(G)) ≤|G/Oπ(G)|π′ = |G|π′.
Thus we can suppose that Oπ(G) = 1.
Let N be a minimal normal subgroup of G. Since G is soluble, N is an elementary
abelian p-group and p /∈π.
Let M/N = Oπ(G/N). By induction:
k((G/N)/Oπ(G/N)) ≤|G/N|π′
and thus:
k(G/M) ≤|G/N|π′.
If M < G, since M ∈F, by induction:
k(M/Oπ(M)) ≤|M|π′
but since Oπ(M) = 1 and M/N is a π-group, we obtain:
k(M) ≤|N|π′
and then, applying the above lemma, we obtain:
k(G) ≤k(G/M)k(M) ≤|G/N|π′|N|π′ = |G|π′.
Hence, we can suppose that M = G and then Oπ(G/N) = G/N. Thus G/N
is a π-group and G = NR, where N is an elementary abelian normal p-subgroup
of G and R is a nilpotent p′-subgroup of G. Therefore N is a faithful irreducible
GF(p)[R]-module and since R is supersoluble, applying a theorem of Kn¨orr (7.4 of
[8]) we obtain:
k(G) = k(NR) ≤|N| = |G|π′.

Theorem 3.2 If G is a soluble group then:
k(G/Oπ(F(G))) ≤|G : J|
where J ∈InjNπ(G).
Proof
Let F(G/Oπ′(G)) = ROπ′(G)/Oπ′(G) where R is a π-group. Since ¯J is a nilpo-
tent injector of ¯G, applying Theorem B in [5], it follows:
k(( ¯G/F( ¯G)) ≤| ¯G : ¯J|
and thus:
k(G/(ROπ′(G))) ≤|G : JOπ′(G)|.
Now, we consider M = ROπ′(G) ⊴G. Therefore we have that Oπ(M) ≤R
which is nilpotent and since Oπ(F(G)) ≤M, it follows that Oπ(M) = Oπ(F(G)).
Thus, since M ∈Sπ′ ⋄Nπ, applying the above lemma we obtain:
k(M/Oπ(M)) ≤|M|π′
and:
k(ROπ′(G)/Oπ(F(G))) ≤|Oπ′(G)|.
Since ROπ′(G)/Oπ(F(G)) ⊴G/Oπ(F(G)), if we denote G = G/Oπ(F(G)),
applying previous lemma:
k( G) ≤k( G/

(ROπ′(G)))k(

(ROπ′(G))) ≤|G : JOπ′(G)||Oπ′(G)| = |G : J|.
2
An argument like that of [5] yields:
Corollary 3.3 If G is a soluble group and θ ∈Irr(Oπ(F(G))) is G-invariant then
|Irr(G|θ)| ≤|G : J| where J ∈InjNπ(G).

Introduction
The aim of this note is to present some problems and also partial results in some
cases, mainly on characters of p-groups. (In the last section we deal with a problem
that consists in obtaining information about characters of a Sylow p-subgroup of an
arbitrary group from information about the characters of the whole group.) This
survey is far from being exhaustive. The topics included are strongly inﬂuenced
by the author’s interests in the last few years. There seems to be an increasing
interest in the character theory of p-groups and we hope that this expository paper
will encourage more research in the area. In the sixties I. M. Isaacs and D. S.
Passman [17, 18] wrote two important papers that initiated the study of the degrees
of the irreducible complex characters of ﬁnite groups (henceforth referred to as
character degrees). The study of the inﬂuence of the set of character degrees on
the structure of a group was taken up again in the eighties, in large part due to
B. Huppert and his school. In particular, this has led to several papers dealing
with the character degrees of important families of p-groups since the nineties (see
[6, 8, 12, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]). Here we are mostly concerned with character
degrees, but instead of studying particular families of p-groups, we intend to obtain
general structural properties of groups according to their character degrees. Other
problems on characters of p-groups appear in [25].
The notation is standard. All the groups considered are ﬁnite. We write cd(G)
to denote the set of character degrees of a group G, b(G) the maximum of the char-
acter degrees of G, cs(G) the set of conjugacy class sizes, and c(G) and dl(G) the
nilpotence class and derived length of G, respectively. The terms of the ascending
Fitting series of a group G will be denoted Fi(G) and the Fitting subgroup F(G).
If P is a p-group we write Ωi(P) to denote the subgroup of P generated by the
elements of order ≤pi.
2
Bounding the derived length and the nilpotence class
Taketa proved that if G is a monomial group (in particular, a p-group) then dl(G) ≤
| cd(G)|. An important problem in character theory of ﬁnite solvable groups is the
Isaacs-Seitz conjecture, which asserts that the derived length of any solvable group
G is bounded by | cd(G)|.
Despite the fact that this conjecture is not proved
yet, it is widely believed that the “right” bound for dl(G) in terms of | cd(G)|
is logarithmic.
This is the case for several families of p-groups, like the Sylow

subgroups of the symmetric groups or the Sylow p-subgroups of the general linear
groups in characteristic p.
A related problem was studied by Isaacs and Knutson in [15]. If N is a normal
subgroup of G, we write cd(G|N) to denote the set of character degrees of G whose
kernel does not contain N, i.e., the set of degrees of the irreducible characters of
G that “‘say something about N”. With this notation, they obtained bounds for
dl(N) in terms of | cd(G|N)|.
In an impressive series of papers, T. M. Keller (see [21, 22, 23]) has reduced the
problem of ﬁnding a logarithmic bound for the derived length of a solvable group in
terms of the cardinality of the set of character degrees to the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1 Let G be a solvable group. Then there exist constants C1 and C2
such that
dl(F(G)) ≤C1 log | cd(G|F(G))| + C2.
The reason for the inclusion of this conjecture in this survey is that its proof
should not be much harder than that of the following conjecture.
Conjecture 2 Let P be a p-group.
Then dl(P) is bounded logarithmically in
terms of | cd(P)|.
In other words, Keller’s work comes close to reducing to p-groups the problem
of replacing Taketa’s bound by a logarithmic one. Unfortunately, the p-group case
seems to be extremely hard.
For instance, it is not known the answer to the
following well-known question.
Question 2.1 Does there exist a p-group of derived length 4 with 4 character
degrees?
M. C. Slattery has proved that the set of degrees of such a p-group cannot be
{1, p, p2, p3} [38].
Of course, one cannot hope to obtain any bounds for the nilpotence class of
a p-group in terms of the number of character degrees.
(It is well-known that
there exist p-groups P of maximal class of arbitrarily large order with an abelian
subgroup of index p and, therefore, cd(P) = {1, p}.) However, if we ﬁx the set S of
character degrees then, sometimes, we can obtain bounds for the nilpotence class.
In the following, S denotes a ﬁnite set of powers of p containing 1. We say that S
is class bounding if there exists a constant C (depending on S) such that c(P) ≤C
for any p-group P with cd(P) = S. In 1968 Isaacs and Passman [18] proved that
if |S| = 2 then S is class bounding if and only if p does not belong to S. Later,
in 1994, Slattery [39] found sets of arbitrarily large size that are class bounding
within the class of metabelian groups. However, apart from the result of Isaacs
and Passman on sets of cardinality 2, there were no more theorems asserting that
a given set S is class bounding (or non-class-bounding) until 2001. In [16] Isaacs
and the present author proved, among other results, that if S ⊆{1, pa, . . . , p2a}
then S is class bounding. All the class bounding sets S found in that paper have
the property that p ̸∈S. In [19] Isaacs and Slattery prove that this a necessary

414

condition for a set S to be class bounding. However, an example constructed in [20]
shows that this is not a suﬃcient condition. In [20] Jaikin-Zapirain and the author
also ﬁnd more class bounding sets. We refer the reader to [16, 19] and [20] for the
detailed results and to [20] for some speciﬁc questions related to this problem.
Question 2.2 Which are the class bounding sets?
A complete answer to this question seems to be out of the scope of the known
methods. We do not know even what to conjecture. I am inclined to think that
the probability that a set is class bounding is 0, in the sense that
lim
n→∞
#{S | S
is class bounding and
max(S) ≤pn}
#{S | max(S) ≤pn}
= 0,
but there is little evidence for this.
We close this section with a question that relates the two problems discussed
here.
Question 2.3 Is it true that if cd(P) = S, |S| = 3 and p ̸∈S, then P is
metabelian?
On the one hand, an aﬃrmative answer to this question would give a new proof
of part of Theorem D of [16]. On the other hand, it would provide another situation
where Taketa’s bound is not best possible.

Minimal characters and normal subgroups
We write m(P) to denote the minimal degree of the non-linear irreducible characters
of P (for convenience, we write m(P) = 1 if P is abelian). It is well-known that this
number has a strong inﬂuence on the structure of the group P (see, for instance,
Problem 5.14 of [11] and [26]). In particular, we want to stress the inﬂuence of m(P)
in the last problem discussed in the previous section (see [20]). We introduce a new
invariant associated to any p-group. Write |G : Z(G)| = p2n+e, where e ∈{0, 1}.
We deﬁne m1(P) = n −logp m(P), i.e., m(P) = pn−m1(P).
With this notation, the groups studied in [4] are exactly those that satisfy
m1(P) = 0.
One of the main results of that paper characterizes such groups
in terms of their normal subgroups. More precisely, we prove the following. (See
Theorems B and C of [4].)
Theorem 3.1
1. Assume that e = 0. Then m1(P) = 0 if and only if P satisﬁes
the strong condition on normal subgroups.
2. Assume that e = 1. Then m1(P) = 0 if and only if P satisﬁes the weak
condition on normal subgroups.
We recall from [4] the deﬁnition of the strong (weak) condition. We say that a
p-group P satisﬁes the strong (weak) condition on normal subgroups if for every
N ⊴P, either P ′ ≤N or N ≤Z(P) (either P ′ ≤N or |NZ(P) : Z(P)| ≤p).

CHARACTERS OF p-GROUPS AND SYLOW p-SUBGROUPS
415
The proof of Theorem 3.1 requires a careful study of the groups satisfying these
properties. This analysis leads G. A. Fern´andez-Alcober and the author to group-
theoretical properties of the groups under consideration which, we think, have some
interest by themselves. For instance, in Theorem F of [4] we obtain a bound for
the index of the center of the groups with any of these properties and class ≥3.
These deﬁnitions and part of Theorem F of [4] have been generalized by Isaacs
[14]. Isaacs deﬁnes an invariant a(P) associated to any ﬁnite p-group P as follows:
a(P) = a is the minimum integer such that if N is a normal subgroup of P and
|NZ(P) : Z(P)| ≥pa then P ′ ≤N. Observe that a(P) = 0 if and only if P is
abelian, a(P) = 1 if and only if P satisﬁes the strong condition and is not abelian
and a(P) = 2 if and only if P satisﬁes the weak condition but not the strong
condition. Therefore, Theorem 3.1 says that if e = 0, then m1(P) = 0 if and only
if a(P) ≤1, while if e = 1, then m1(P) = 0 if and only if a(P) ≤2. We think that
it should be possible to generalize this result too. Our aim now is to present some
results that suggest this.
We begin by proving that if m1(P) is small then a(P) is also small.
Proposition 3.2 With the notation above, if m1(P) ≤m for some a ∈N, then
a(G) ≤2m + 1 + e.
Proof Let N be a normal subgroup of P such that P ′ ̸≤N. Since P/N is not
abelian and cd(P/N) ⊆cd(P), we have that
p2(n−m) ≤|P/N : Z(P/N)| ≤|P : NZ(P)| ≤|P : Z(P)| = p2n+e,
and it follows that |NZ(P) : Z(P)| ≤p2m+e. Therefore a(P) ≤2m + 1 + e.
2
The bound obtained here is best possible, as direct products of p-groups of
maximal class with non-trivial abelian p-groups show. This result generalizes the
easy part of Theorem 3.1. However, in this general setting the converse is not true,
as the following example shows.
Example 3.3 Let P = ⟨x, y | xpn = yp2n = 1, yx = y1+pn⟩for n ∈N. Then
P ′ = Z(P) = ⟨ypn⟩, |P : Z(P)| = p2n and N = ⟨xp, ypn+1⟩is a normal subgroup of
P such that P ′ ̸≤N and |NZ(P) : Z(P)| = pn−1. Now it is possible to prove that
a(P) = n and m1(P) = n −1.
Now we prove that if P is a group of class 2 and a(P) is small, then m1(P) is
small. We ﬁrst need a lemma, which is a generalization of [4, Theorem D]. In order
to prove it it is enough to mimic the proof of Theorem D of [4], so we will just give
a sketch of it.
Lemma 3.4 Let P be a p-group of class 2. If a(P) > 1, then exp P/Z(P) ≤pa(P).
Furthermore, if exp P/Z(P) = pa(P) then P/Z(P) ∼= Cpa(P ) × Cpa(P ) and P ′ ∼=
Cpa(P ).

416
MORET´O
Proof Let M be a maximal subgroup of P ′ and let N be a normal subgroup of P
maximal with respect to the property P ′ ∩N = M. Let K/N = Z(P/N). Since
the derived subgroup of P/N is of order p, P/K is elementary abelian. By the
choice of N, we have that K/N is cyclic, so K/NZ(P) is cyclic. Since P ′ ̸≤N,
|NZ(P) : Z(P)| ≤pa(P)−1. Now the bound for the exponent of P/Z(P) follows
from the fact that this abelian group has at least two cyclic factors of maximal
order.
If exp P/Z(P) = pa(P) the previous argument shows that P/Z(P) is a direct
product of two cyclic groups of order pa(P) and, perhaps, some cyclic factors of
smaller order. We want to prove that in fact all the cyclic factors are of order pa(P).
In this case, we can choose M = Ωa(P)−1(P ′). Let T/Z(P) = Ωa(P)−1(P/Z(P)).
Then exp[T, P] = exp T/Z(P) = pa(P)−1 and consequently [T, P] ≤M. Hence T ≤
K. We know that K/NZ(P) is cyclic and |NZ(P) : Z(P)| ≤pa(P)−1. Therefore,
|Ωa(P)−1(P/Z(P))| ≤p2a(P)−2.
It follows that P/Z(P) ∼= Cpa(P ) × Cpa(P ) and P ′ ∼= Cpa(P ).
2
The previous example shows that the bound obtained in this lemma cannot be
improved. Of course, the order of P/Z(P) cannot be bounded in terms of a(P)
when c(P) = 2.
This lemma proves that, at least, it is possible to bound the
exponent.
Theorem 3.5 Let P be a p-group of class 2. If a(P) = a > 1 then m1(P) ≤
a −1 −e.
Proof Since c(P) = 2, χ(1)2 = |P : Z(χ)| for any χ ∈Irr(P), by Theorem 2.31
of [11]. Let K = Ker χ. If χ is non-linear, then |KZ(P) : Z(P)| ≤pa−1. We also
know that Z(χ)/K is cyclic and exp P/Z(P) ≤pa−e by the previous lemma. It
follows that |Z(χ) : Z(P)| ≤p2a−1−e, so
|P : Z(χ)| ≥p2n−2a+1+2e.
Since this index is a square, we have that |P : Z(χ)| ≥p2(n−a+1+e), and we deduce
that χ(1) ≥pn−a+1+e, as we wanted to prove.
2
The bound in this theorem cannot be improved, as Example 3.3 shows. However,
I think that the hypothesis on the class can be removed.
Conjecture 3 Let P be a p-group. Then m1(P) ≤a(P)−1−e whenever a(P) > 1.

Miscellaneous questions
In the last years a number of similar results for character degrees and conjugacy
class sizes have been obtained. However, the reason for the existence of this par-
allelism, if any, is still unknown.
Isaacs [10] proved that any set of powers of
p containing 1 occurs as the set of character degrees of a p-group of class ≤2.

CHARACTERS OF p-GROUPS AND SYLOW p-SUBGROUPS
417
The analog result for conjugacy class sizes has been obtained by J. Cossey and T.
Hawkes [2]. Although it is easy to ﬁnd sets of character degrees (resp. conjugacy
class sizes) that impose restrictions on the class sizes (resp. character degrees),
Fern´andez-Alcober and the author [5] proved that there is not any relation be-
tween the cardinalities of these sets, i.e., given any two integers m and n greater
than 1, there exists a p-group with m character degrees and n conjugacy class sizes.
A complete answer to the following question, which was ﬁrst raised in [5], seems to
be very diﬃcult.
Question 4.1 Determine the pairs (A, B) of sets of powers of p containing 1 such
that there exists a p-group P with cd(P) = A and cs(P) = B.
The particular case |A| = |B| = 2 is being studied by Cossey and Hawkes [7].
We recall that a group G is normally monomial if any irreducible character
of G is induced from a linear character of a normal subgroup.
It was thought
that, perhaps, the derived length of normally monomial groups was bounded by
some constant. However, in [24] L. Kovacs and C. R. Leedham-Green constructed
normally monomial p-groups of derived length the integer part of log2(p + 1). As
far as I know, the answer to the following question is still unknown.
Question 4.2 Does there exist a function f such that if P is a normally monomial
p-group then dl(P) ≤f(p)?
A classical problem in character theory is to determine what kind of group
theoretical information can be determined from the knowledge of the character
table. For instance, R. Brauer [1] asked whether or not the derived length of a
solvable group can be read oﬀfrom the character table. This question was answered
negatively even for p-groups by S. Mattarei [29], but the following question remains
open.
Question 4.3 Do there exist p-groups P1 and P2 with the same character table
and dl(P1) ≥dl(P2) + 2?

Character degrees of Sylow p-subgroups
There are some known results that give information on the structure of a ﬁnite
group in terms of the p-parts of the irreducible complex (or Brauer) characters
(see, for instance, [27]). In this section we deal with the following problem.
Conjecture 4 Let G be a ﬁnite group and write ep(G) to denote the exponent
of the largest p-part of the irreducible complex characters of G. Then ep(P) is
bounded by some function of ep(G), where P ∈Sylp(G).
If ep(G) = 0 then P is abelian (by Ito-Michler’s theorem), so we will assume
ep(G) > 0 in the remaining. This might lead one to think that, in fact, ep(P) ≤
ep(G) but this is false even for solvable groups, as the following example of Isaacs
shows.

Example 5.1 Let V be a row vector space of dimension 3 over the ﬁnite ﬁeld with
two elements. Consider the natural action of the subgroup H of GL(3, 2) consisting
of the matrices


on V . If G = V H then e2(G) = 1 and e2(P) = 2, where P is a Sylow 2-subgroup
of G. There are similar examples for p = 3.
As far as I know, it might be true that ep(P) ≤ep(G) for p ≥5 and G solvable
and that ep(P) ≤2ep(G) for any prime and any group. This would imply that if G
is solvable then dl(P) ≤2ep(G) + 1, using Taketa’s theorem. This last inequality
is the main theorem of [9].
We are able to prove the bound ep(P) ≤ep(G) for metanilpotent groups (in
particular for supersolvable groups). However this bound does not hold for groups
of Fitting height 3 as Isaacs’ example shows. For solvable groups we obtain a bound
for ep(P) in terms of ep(G) and the Fitting height of G.
We begin with an elementary lemma.
Lemma 5.2 Let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then ep(N) ≤ep(G). In particu-
lar, if G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup P, then ep(P) ≤ep(G).
Proof This is an immediate consequence of Cliﬀord theory.
2
Theorem 5.3 Let G be a solvable group and R the smallest normal subgroup of
G such that G/R is nilpotent. Assume that R is p-nilpotent. Then ep(P) ≤ep(G)
for any P ∈Sylp(G).
Proof We may assume that PR > R (otherwise the result follows by induction
and Lemma 5.2). Since G/R is nilpotent and PR/R is a Sylow p-subgroup of G/R,
we have that PR ⊴G and, again by induction and Lemma 5.2, we may assume
that G = PR. Then G is p-nilpotent, and the result follows.
2
Corollary 5.4 Let G be a metanilpotent group and P ∈Sylp(G). Then ep(P) ≤
ep(G).
Our next aim is to bound ep(P) in terms of the Fitting height h(G) and ep(G).
The key is the following lemma, which gives a bound for the p-part of the order of
the quotient of two consecutive terms of the ascending Fitting series Fi+1(G)/Fi(G)
when Fi(G)/Fi−1(G) is a p′-group.
Lemma 5.5 Let G be a solvable group and assume that Op(G) = 1. Then
|F2(G)/F(G)|p ≤p2ep(G)−1.
Proof By Gaschutz’s theorem (see [27, Theorem 1.12]) G/F(G) acts faithfully on
the abelian group F(G)/Φ(G). Therefore it also acts faithfully on Irr(F(G)/Φ(G)).
Let P1/F(G) ∈Sylp(F2(G)/F(G)) and consider the faithful action of the p-group

CHARACTERS OF p-GROUPS AND SYLOW p-SUBGROUPS

P1/F(G) on the p′-group Irr(F(G)/Φ(G)). We may assume that |P1/F(G)| > 1.
By [13], there exists λ ∈Irr(F(G)/Φ(G)) such that |IP1/F(G)(λ)| < |P1/F(G)|1/2.
Since P1 ⊴G,
pep(G) ≥|P1/F(G) : IP1/F(G)(λ)| > |P1/F(G)|1/2
and the result follows.
2
Let G be a group such that Op(G) = 1. We deﬁne the following series
1 = P0 ◁N1 ◁P1 ◁N2 ◁P2 ◁· · · ◁G,
where Ni+1/Pi is the largest nilpotent subgroup of G/Pi and Pi/Ni is the largest
normal p-subgroup of G/Ni. Let sp(G) be the minimum integer such that G = Ns
or G = Ps. It is clear that lp(G) ≤sp(G) ≤h(G) ≤2sp(G). Observe that if there
are just two primes dividing |G|, then this series is exactly the ascending p′, p-series.
Corollary 5.6 Let G be a solvable group and P ∈Sylp(G). Then |P : Op(G)| ≤
psp(G/Op(G))(2ep(G)−1).
Proof It is enough to apply repeatedly the previous lemma.
2
Now we are ready to bound ep(P) in terms of ep(G) and sp(G).
Theorem 5.7 Let G be a solvable group and P ∈Sylp(G). Then
ep(P) ≤(2sp(G/Op(G)) + 1)ep(G) −sp(G).
Proof By Lemma 5.2, ep(Op(G)) ≤ep(G) and, by the previous corollary, |P :
Op(G)| ≤psp(G)(2ep(G)−1). Therefore
b(P) ≤|P : Op(G)|b(Op(G)) ≤psp(G)(2ep(G)−1)+ep(G)
and the result follows.
2
Corollary 5.8 Let G be a group of order paqb and P ∈Sylp(G). Then
ep(P) ≤C1ep(G) log ep(G) + C2.
Proof It is enough to observe that sp(G/Op(G)) = lp(G/Op(G)) and apply [27, p.
194] to the bound in Theorem 5.7.
2
It seems hard to ﬁnd a counterexample to the conjecture, since it would be
necessary to construct an inﬁnite family of groups with Fitting height going to
inﬁnity and at least 3 primes dividing the order of each of the groups.
There is a similar conjecture, due to G. Navarro [31].

420
MORET´O
Conjecture 5 Let G be a ﬁnite group. Then

p∈π(G)
b(Gp) ≤b(G),
where Gp is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
Despite the similar ﬂavor of these conjectures, it does not seem easy to apply
results obtained for one of them to the other.
We close by remarking that it is not diﬃcult to prove the conjugacy-class analog
of Conjecture 4 for solvable groups. (We believe that the solvability hypothesis
is not necessary, however.)
On the other hand, the analog of Conjecture 5 is
completely false even for solvable groups (see [3]).

groups’) which can be investigated by using their multiplication groups.

connection to group theory is a source of several interesting group theoretical in-
vestigations and in the following four sections we try to cover some of the major
problems in this area.
1
Introduction
Let Q be a groupoid with a neutral element e. If for any a, b ∈Q each of the
equations ax = b and ya = b has a unique solution, then we say that Q is a
loop.
For each a ∈Q we have two permutations La (left translation) and Ra
(right translation) on Q deﬁned by La(x) = ax and Ra(x) = xa for every x ∈Q.
The permutation group M(Q) generated by the set of all left and right translations
is called the multiplication group of Q. It is easy to see that M(Q) is transitive
on Q and the stabilizers of elements of Q are conjugated in M(Q). The stabilizer
of e ∈Q is denoted by I(Q) and this stabilizer is called the inner mapping group
of Q (it is interesting to observe that if Q is a group, then I(Q) is just the group
of inner automorphisms of Q). The concepts of the multiplication group and the
inner mapping group of a loop were deﬁned by Bruck [3] in 1946 in an article
where he laid the foundation of loop theory. In the present article we shall consider
various problems linked with the structure of M(Q) and I(Q) and we shall also
consider the relation between the structure of the loop Q and the corresponding
multiplication group and inner mapping group.
The ﬁrst two major problems are:
• 1) Which permutation groups are multiplication groups of loops?
• 2) Which groups are isomorphic to multiplication groups of loops?
When we investigate these two problems (and the structure of M(Q) in general),
then it is very useful to see what is happening with the inner mapping group
I(Q). When we answer the question: ”Which groups can (can not) be in the role
of I(Q)?”, we simultaneously get tools that can be used to provide answers to
problems 1) and 2).
In loop theory solvability and (central) nilpotency of loops can be deﬁned in a
way which is analogous to the way we deﬁne these notions in group theory. We
immediately have the following interesting problems here: How does the structure
of Q inﬂuence the structure of M(Q) and I(Q) and conversely: if we assume that

ON THE RELATION BETWEEN GROUP THEORY AND LOOP THEORY 423
M(Q) (or I(Q)) has a special structure, then what do we know about the structure
of Q?
The following sections are devoted to the problems mentioned before. We wish
to point out that there are several other links between loops and groups. Conway
[4], for example, has used a special loop in the construction of the Fischer-Griess
Monster and Foguel and Ungar [10], [11] have found interesting links to hyperbolic
geometries and relativistic physics. For those who are interested in the history
of loop theory we recommend the article of Pﬂugfelder [22]. This article is based
on the talk that she gave during the international loop theory conference held in
Prague in 1999.
2
Loops, groups and transversals
Loops appear in a natural way as algebraic structures on transversals of a subgroup
in a group. This observation can be traced back to the work by Baer [1]. Let Q
be a loop and denote A = {La : a ∈Q} and B = {Ra : a ∈Q}. Now the two
sets A and B are left (also right) transversals to I(Q) in M(Q). It is easy to see
that the commutator subgroup [A, B] is a subgroup of I(Q) and we say that the
transversals A and B are I(Q)-connected in M(Q). In general, if G is a group, H
is a subgroup of G and there exist two left transversals A and B to H in G such
that [A, B] ≤H, then we say that A and B are H- connected transversals in G.
The following theorem that was proved by Kepka and Niemenmaa [16] describes
the relation between multiplication groups of loops and connected transversals.
Theorem 2.1 A group G is isomorphic to the multiplication group of a loop if and
only if there exist a subgroup H satisfying HG = 1 (the core of H in G is trivial)
and H-connected transversals A and B such that G = ⟨A, B⟩.
This theorem gives us a purely group theoretical characterization of multiplica-
tion groups of loops and in recent papers it has very often been the starting point
of the investigation. From Theorem 2.1 it follows that if I(Q) is cyclic, then M(Q)
is an abelian group and, in fact, our loop Q must be an abelian group (then, of
course, I(Q) = 1). It also follows that I(Q) can not be the Pr¨ufer group Cp∞for
a prime p. Furthermore, we know that the normalizer of I(Q) in M(Q) equals the
direct product of I(Q) and Z(M(Q)). By combining these properties of I(Q) we
can show that S3, S4 and A4 are not isomorphic to the multiplication group of
a loop. This is also true for hamiltonian groups, dihedral groups and Blackburn
groups (these groups are neither hamiltonian nor abelian and the intersection of
all nonnormal subgroups is not trivial [2]). As these examples indicate, it seems
easier to prove non-existence results than to actually construct loops with given
multiplication groups. To further demonstrate this we shall now consider the situ-
ation in ﬁnite simple groups. Thus assume that Q is a ﬁnite loop such that M(Q)
is simple (and here ’simple’ means noncommutative simple). The ﬁrst crucial ob-
servation is that I(Q) is a maximal subgroup in M(Q) (see [16]). When we decide
whether a given simple group G is isomorphic to the multiplication group of a loop,
we ﬁrst have to list all the maximal subgroups of G and then we try to ﬁnd the

424
NIEMENMAA
corresponding connected transversals such that the conditions of Theorem 2.1 are
satisﬁed. By using representation theory and the centralizer ring of M(Q) (for the
details, see [13] and [25]), we get the following inequality:
| M(Q) |≤| I(Q) | ((C −1) | I(Q) | +1),
where C is the number of conjugacy classes in G. This result can be used to rule
out maximal subgroups of small order.
We can now list some nonexistence results. Vesanen ( [23] and [25]) was able
to show that PSL(2, q) is isomorphic to some M(Q) if and only if q = 9. If G is
one of the groups
1) Un(q), where n ≥6,
2) On(q), where n is odd and n ≥7, or
3) Oϵ
n(q), where n is even and n ≥7 −ϵ
acting in the set Ωof the isotropic points of the corresponding projective space,
then there exists no loop Q deﬁned in the set Ωsuch that M(Q) ≤G (for the
details, see Vesanen [26].
Finally, we list some results which are positive in the sense that some ﬁnite simple
groups are (isomorphic to) multiplication groups of loops. Drapal and Kepka [6]
showed that the alternating group A5 is not a loop group but if n ≥6 then there
exists a loop of order n such that M(Q) ∼= An.
Here we have an interesting
example: there exists a loop Q of order 15 such that M(Q) ∼= A8. This is the
only known example of a ﬁnite simple group being the multiplication group of two
loops of diﬀerent orders. A loop is called a Moufang loop if it satisﬁes the law
x(y.zy) = (xy.z)y. If Q is a ﬁnite simple nonassociative Moufang loop, then M(Q)
is a nonabelian ﬁnite simple group with triality . Liebeck proved in [14] that the
only simple groups with triality are the groups O+
8 (q) and by using this result
he was able to classify all ﬁnite simple Moufang loops: they are the ﬁnite simple
groups and the loops deﬁned by Paige [21].
Doubly transitive groups in which only the identity ﬁxes three points are called
Zassenhaus groups. In 2001 Drapal [7] managed to show that no ﬁnite loop has a
multiplication group that is a Zassenhaus group.
3
Nilpotent and solvable loops
If Q is a loop, then the centre of Q is denoted by C(Q) and a ∈C(Q) provided
that ax = xa for every x ∈Q and, in addition, a(xy) = (ax)y, (xy)a = x(ya) and
(xa)y = x(ay) for all x, y ∈Q. Clearly, the centre is an abelian group and it is
not diﬃcult to show that C(Q) and Z(M(Q)) are isomorphic. If we put C0 = 1,
C1 = C(Q) and Ci/Ci−1 = C(Q/Ci−1), then we obtain a series of normal subloops
of Q. If Cn−1 is a proper subloop of Q but Cn = Q, then we say that Q is (centrally)
nilpotent of class n.
In 1946 Bruck [3] showed that if Q is a nilpotent loop, then M(Q) is a solvable
group. He also showed that if M(Q) is a nilpotent group, then Q is a nilpotent

ON THE RELATION BETWEEN GROUP THEORY AND LOOP THEORY 425
loop. The latter result was investigated more closely by Vesanen [24] and he was
able to prove
Theorem 3.1 If M(Q) is a ﬁnite nilpotent group, then Q is a direct product of
nilpotent p-loops.
Thus a ﬁnite nilpotent group G is isomorphic to the multiplication group of a
loop if and only if its Sylow subgroups are isomorphic to multiplication groups
of loops. Here one should remember that there exist nilpotent loops which are
not direct products of p-loops and which thus have nonnilpotent (but solvable)
multiplication groups (see Bruck [3] , Chapter III).
As we pointed out in the introduction, it is also interesting to see how the
structure of I(Q) inﬂuences the structure of Q. In [17] Kepka and Niemenmaa
considered the situation that H is an abelian subgroup of a ﬁnite group G such
that there exist H-connected transversals A and B in G. If G = ⟨A, B⟩, then H
is subnormal in G. From this it follows that if Q is a ﬁnite loop such that I(Q)
is abelian, then Q is nilpotent. In [18] Niemenmaa investigated a similar situation
with a subgroup that is a dihedral 2-group. Again, it turned out that the subgroup
is subnormal and as a loop theoretical application we get: If Q is a loop such that
I(Q) is a dihedral 2-group, then Q is nilpotent.
Bruck deﬁned the solvability of loops as follows: A loop Q is solvable if it has a
series 1 = Q0 ⊆... ⊆Qn = Q, where Qi−1 is a normal subloop of Qi and Qi/Qi−1
is an abelian group (normal subloops are the kernels of loop homomorphisms). Of
course, nilpotent loops are solvable. In 1968, Glauberman [12] managed to show
that every ﬁnite Moufang loop of odd order is solvable (since the class of Moufang
loops includes the class of groups, this result generalizes the theorem of Feit and
Thompson [9] ).
In 1996, Vesanen [27] investigated the relation between solvable loops and solv-
able groups and he was able to prove
Theorem 3.2 Let Q be a ﬁnite loop. If M(Q) is a solvable group, then Q is a
solvable loop.
This result is very fundamental and deep and opens a large variety of possibil-
ities to create solvability criteria for ﬁnite loops in terms of the properties of the
inner mapping group. Hence, we are interested in those properties of I(Q) which
guarantee the solvability of M(Q).
The results by Kepka and Niemenmaa in [17] and [18] indicate that the solvability
of a loop Q follows provided that I(Q) is a ﬁnite abelian group or I(Q) is a dihedral
2-group. Therefore it is quite natural that we next turn our attention to the case
where I(Q) is a nonnilpotent dihedral group. In [5] Cs¨org¨o and Niemenmaa showed
that if Q is a loop such that | I(Q) |= 2p, where p is an odd prime, then M(Q) is
solvable. If Q is ﬁnite, then Vesanen’s result implies that Q is a solvable loop. In
2000, Myllyl¨a [15] was able to show that a ﬁnite loop Q is solvable provided that
I(Q) is a dihedral group of order 2k, where k is an odd number.
Quite recently, Drapal [8] has written an interesting paper where he considers
the case that I(Q) is a nonabelian group of order pq, where q < p are prime

426
NIEMENMAA
numbers. He shows that Q/C(Q) is a loop of order pk, where 2 ≤k ≤q and
M(Q)/Z(M(Q)) is a solvable group of order p2qk. Now it is clear that both M(Q)
and Q are solvable.
We put an end to this section by introducing the following open problems:
• Is it true that the solvability of M(Q) implies the solvability of Q (without
the condition that Q is ﬁnite)?
• If I(Q) is a nilpotent group, does it then follow that M(Q) is a solvable group
and Q is a solvable loop?
• If I(Q) is a dihedral group, does it then follow that M(Q) is a solvable group
and Q is a solvable loop?
4
Abelian inner mapping groups
The starting point here is the observation that I(Q) = 1 if and only if Q is an
abelian group. We also know that I(Q) can neither be (nontrivial) cyclic nor the
Pr¨ufer group. In [19] we managed to show that if Q is a ﬁnite loop, then I(Q) can
not be isomorphic to Cn × D, where Cn is a cyclic group of order n > 1, D is an
abelian group and gcd(n, | D |) = 1. We continued our investigations of ﬁnite loops
in [20] and it turned out that I(Q) can not be isomorphic to Cp2 × Cp, where p is a
prime number. Furthermore, if D is a ﬁnite abelian group such that D has a Sylow
p-subgroup S which is isomorphic to Cp2 ×Cp, then I(Q) can not be isomorphic to
D. By using this result we could show that certain solvable groups can not occur
as multiplication groups of loops (for the details, see section 3 in [20]). To conclude
this survey, we introduce the following problem:
• Classify those ﬁnite abelian groups which are isomorphic to inner mapping
groups of loops.

Abstract
In this survey paper we discuss some topics from the theory of subgroup lattices.
After giving a general overview, we investigate the local structure of subgroup
lattices. A major open problem asks if every ﬁnite lattice occurs as an interval in
the subgroup lattice of a ﬁnite group. Next we investigate laws that are valid in
normal subgroup lattices. Then we sketch the proof that every ﬁnite distributive
lattice is the normal subgroup lattice of a suitable ﬁnite solvable group. Finally,
we discuss how far the subgroup lattice of a direct power of a ﬁnite group can
determine the group.

Introduction
This survey paper is the written version of my four talks given at the Groups – St
Andrews 2001 in Oxford conference. I selected some topics on subgroup lattices
and normal subgroup lattices according to my personal taste and interest. These
topics, of course, cannot cover all interesting and important parts of the theory.
For a more complete overview the reader should consult the small book of Michio
Suzuki [60] from 1956 and the more recent monograph by Roland Schmidt [54].
The latter one is a thick volume of 541 pages including 384 references. So it is
clearly impossible to give a comprehensive survey here. My choice of topics was
partly guided by the review of Schmidt’s book by Ralph Freese [13].
The study of subgroup lattices has quite a long history, starting with Richard
Dedekind’s work [10] in 1877, including Ada Rottlaender’s paper [47] from 1928
and later numerous important contributions by Reinhold Baer, Øystein Ore, Ken-
kichi Iwasawa, Leonid Eﬁmovich Sadovskii, Michio Suzuki, Giovanni Zacher, Mario
Curzio, Federico Menegazzo, Roland Schmidt, Stewart Stonehewer, Giorgio Busetto,
and many-many others.
In Section 2 we will list some of the most remarkable results on subgroup lattices.
Hints to the contents of Sections 3–6 will also be given there. These later sections
are surveys of some particular topics, therefore proofs are very rarely given, and
even then, they will be quite sketchy.
The lattice formed by all subgroups of a group will be denoted by Sub(G) and will
be called the subgroup lattice of the group G. It is a complete lattice: any number of
subgroups Hi have a meet (greatest lower bound)  Hi, namely their intersection

 Hi, and a join (least upper bound)  Hi, namely the subgroup generated by all
of them together. Notice that we denote the lattice operations by ∧and ∨.
An element c ∈L in a complete lattice is called compact if
c ≤

i∈I

implies
c ≤

i∈J
ai for a ﬁnite subset J ⊆I.
It is easy to see that H ∈Sub(G) is compact if and only if H is a ﬁnitely generated
subgroup of G. A complete lattice is called algebraic if every element is a join of
compact elements. We see that subgroup lattices are always algebraic.
If the group is ﬁnite, it is a convenient way to visualize the lattice using its
Hasse diagram, where the bottom element represents the identity subgroup 1, the
top element the group itself, and between two elements of the lattice a line segment
is drawn whenever the lower subgroup is a maximal subgroup in the upper one.
An example is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Hasse diagram of Sub(A4)
Our notation is mostly standard. For H ≤G we denote by NG(H), CG(H)
the normalizer and the centralizer of H in G, respectively. The center and the
commutator subgroup of G is denoted by Z(G) and G′. The automorphism group
and the inner automorphism group are written as Aut G and Inn G. For normal
subgroups we use the notation N ◁G. The set of normal subgroups is a sublattice
in Sub(G), it will be denoted by Norm(G). Intervals in lattices will be deﬁned in
Section 2, and in subgroup lattices they will be denoted as Int[H; G]. The cyclic
group of order n will be written as Cn, the dihedral group of degree n (and order
2n) as Dn, the alternating and symmetric groups as An and Sn. Furthermore,
GF(q) will denote the q-element ﬁeld, and F × the multiplicative group of a ﬁeld
F.

Overview
We start with some simple observations concerning subgroup lattices. Since we
will mainly deal with ﬁnite groups, let us remark that the subgroup lattice Sub(G)
is ﬁnite if and only if the group G is ﬁnite. For some small lattices it is easy to
determine all groups that have the given lattice as subgroup lattice. For example,

430
P´ALFY
Sub(G) =
if and only if G is cyclic of prime order;
Sub(G) =
if and only if G is cyclic of order p2 for a prime p;
Sub(G) =
if and only if G is cyclic of order pq (with primes p ̸= q);
Sub(G) =
if and only if G is the four-element Klein group;
Sub(G) =
if and only if either G ∼= C3 × C3 or G ∼= D3.
However, there is no group G with Sub(G) =
.
So there are lattices which are subgroup lattices of inﬁnitely many, of ﬁnitely
many, of a unique, or of no group. That is, the correspondence G →Sub(G) is
neither injective, nor surjective. This fact gives rise to two questions:
1. Which groups are uniquely determined by their subgroup lattices?
2. Which lattices are subgroup lattices?
The answer to the second question is very complicated, as given by B. V. Yakovlev
[64] in 1974, based on his description of the subgroup lattices of free groups. We
would be interested rather in the local structure of subgroup lattices, that is we
would like to know what are the possible intervals in subgroup lattices. If a < b
are elements of a lattice L, by the interval Int[a; b] we mean the sublattice formed
by the intermediate elements:
Int[a; b] = {x ∈L | a ≤x ≤b}.
In Section 3 we will see that every algebraic lattice can occur as an interval in the
subgroup lattice of an inﬁnite group. For ﬁnite groups, however, it is not known
whether every ﬁnite lattice can be found as an interval in the subgroup lattice of
a suitable ﬁnite group. The main subject of Section 3 will be a survey of results
concerning this open problem.
An important line of investigations deals with groups whose subgroup lattices
satisfy certain laws. As it follows from the following basic result, there is no non-
trivial law that holds in the subgroup lattice of every group.

GROUPS AND LATTICES
431
Theorem 2.1 (Whitman [63], 1946) Every lattice is isomorphic to a sublattice of
the subgroup lattice of some group.
There is also a remarkable ﬁnite version of this embedding theorem.
Theorem 2.2 (Pudl´ak and T˚uma [46], 1980) Every ﬁnite lattice is isomorphic to
a sublattice of the subgroup lattice of some ﬁnite group.
The most familiar lattice law is the distributivity. Recall that a lattice L is called
distributive if the following equivalent conditions hold for every x, y, z ∈L:
• x ∨(y ∧z) = (x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z);
• x ∧(y ∨z) = (x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z);
• (x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z) ∧(y ∨z) = (x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z) ∨(y ∧z).
One of the nicest results in the theory of subgroup lattices characterizes those
groups which have distributive subgroup lattices.
Theorem 2.3 (Ore [37], 1937–38) The subgroup lattice Sub(G) is distributive if
and only if the group G is locally cyclic.
Recall that a group G is said to be locally cyclic, if every ﬁnitely generated
subgroup of G is cyclic. There are not too many such groups: a group G is locally
cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to a subgroup of either the additive group of
the rationals Q or of its quotient group Q/Z.
Cyclic groups can be characterized by the properties that Sub(G) is distributive
and satisﬁes the ascending chain condition (i.e., it contains no inﬁnite chain of
subgroups H1 < H2 < H3 < . . .). If n = pk1
1 · · · pkr
r , then the subgroup lattice of
the cyclic group of order n is the direct product of chains of lengths k1, . . . , kr,
independently of the primes pi.
The description of groups with modular subgroup lattices is quite complicated.
As it is well known, a lattice L is called modular if for all x, y, z ∈L
x ≥z ⇒x ∧(y ∨z) = (x ∧y) ∨z.
(In Section 4 we will give some equivalent conditions as well.) The subgroup lattices
of abelian groups are modular, as it was discovered by Richard Dedekind [10] in
1877 for the case of the subgroup lattice of the additive group of the complex
numbers. So we make the assumption that
G is nonabelian and Sub(G) is a modular lattice.
The characterization consists of several pieces.
Theorem 2.4 (Iwasawa [23], 1943) If G has elements of inﬁnite order, then the
torsion subgroup T(G) of G is abelian, G/T(G) is a torsion-free abelian group of
rank one, etc.
For the omitted details see [54, 2.4.11 Theorem].

Theorem 2.5 (Schmidt [53], 1986) If G is a torsion group, then G is a direct
product of Tarski groups, extended Tarski groups and a locally ﬁnite group, such
that elements from diﬀerent direct factors have coprime orders.
A Tarski group is an inﬁnite group in which every proper nontrivial subgroup
has prime order. Tarski groups were ﬁrst constructed by Olshanskii [35] in 1979.
An extended Tarski group is such that G/Z(G) is a Tarski group of exponent p for
some prime p, Z(G) is cyclic of order pr > 1, and for every subgroup H ≤G, either
H ≤Z(G) or H ≥Z(G) holds. The subgroup lattice of an extended Tarski group
is shown in Figure 2. Note that extended Tarski groups do exist if p is suﬃciently
large (see Olshanskii [36]).
Figure 2. The subgroup lattice of an extended Tarski group
Theorem 2.6 (Iwasawa [23], 1943) If G is a locally ﬁnite group, then G is a direct
product of P ∗-groups and locally ﬁnite p-groups, such that elements from diﬀerent
direct factors have coprime orders.
By deﬁnition, a P ∗-group is a semidirect product of an elementary abelian normal
subgroup A with a cyclic group ⟨t⟩of prime power order such that t induces a power
automorphism (tat−1 = ar with a ﬁxed r for all a ∈A) of prime order on A. In
fact, all these groups have modular subgroup lattices.
Theorem 2.7 (Iwasawa [23], 1943) If G is a locally ﬁnite p-group, then either G
is a direct product of the quaternion group with an elementary abelian 2-group, or
G contains an abelian normal subgroup A of exponent pk with cyclic quotient group
G/A of order pm and there exist an element b ∈G with G = A⟨b⟩and an integer
s (which is at least 2 if p = 2) such that s < k ≤s + m and bab−1 = a1+ps for all
a ∈A.
Again, all these groups have modular subgroup lattices.
Theorems 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 together yield a complete characterization of non-
abelian groups with modular subgroup lattices.
As we have seen, some lattice theoretic properties may correspond to some sim-
ple group theoretic ones, but sometimes the description of groups with subgroup

lattices of certain type (such as modular lattices) are awkward. Unfortunately, nice
characterisations are rather rare. We list some (maybe all) of them now.
The Jordan–Dedekind chain condition means that all maximal chains in the
lattice have the same length. Finite groups with such subgroup lattices have a
beautiful description.
Theorem 2.8 (Iwasawa [22], 1941) For a ﬁnite group G, the subgroup lattice
Sub(G) satisﬁes the Jordan–Dedekind chain condition if and only if G is super-
solvable.
A lattice L is called sectionally complemented if for every b < c ∈L there exists
a d ∈L such that b∧d = 0 (the smallest element of the lattice) and b∨d = c. This
lattice theoretic property also has a neat group theoretic counterpart.
Theorem 2.9 (Bechtell [6], 1965) For a ﬁnite group G, the subgroup lattice Sub(G)
is sectionally complemented if and only if every Sylow subgroup of G is elementary
abelian.
Sectionally complemented lattices are more general than relatively complemented
lattices, in which for every a < b < c ∈L the existence of a d ∈L with b ∧d = a
and b ∨d = c is required (see Figure 3). So here we need an additional condition.
By deﬁnition, G is a T∗-group if being a normal subgroup is a transitive relation
among the subgroups of G, that is A ◁B ◁C ≤G implies A ◁C.

Theorem 2.10 (Zacher [65], 1952) For a ﬁnite group G, the subgroup lattice
Sub(G) is relatively complemented if and only if every Sylow subgroup of G is
elementary abelian and G is a T∗-group.
We shall also investigate laws in normal subgroup lattices. One basic fact is that
Norm(G) is always modular. There are even stronger laws that hold in normal
subgroup lattices, as — for example — the arguesian law. We will deal with this
subject in Section 4.
Our main concern will be whether there exist laws that
distinguish subgroup lattices of abelian groups from normal subgroup lattices in
general.

In Section 5 we are going to show that every ﬁnite distributive lattice is the
normal subgroup lattice of a ﬁnite solvable group. It does not seem feasible to
describe which lattices can be normal subgroup lattices.
In general Sub(G) does not determine G uniquely. A lattice isomorphism be-
tween subgroup lattices Sub(G) and Sub(H) is called a projectivity. We restrict
our attention — unless stated otherwise — to ﬁnite groups. Although there are
cases when inﬁnitely many groups share the same subgroup lattice, these lattices
can be singled out easily.
Theorem 2.11 (Suzuki [59], 1951) If Sub(G) has no chain as a direct factor, then
there are only ﬁnitely many nonisomorphic groups H with Sub(H) ∼= Sub(G).
Also certain — but by far not all — properties of groups are preserved by
projectivities. Assume that Sub(G) ∼= Sub(H) for ﬁnite groups G, H.
• If G is cyclic, then H is also cyclic.
• If G is abelian, then H need not be abelian (even nilpotent).
• If G is a p-group which is neither cyclic, nor elementary abelian, then H is
also a p-group (Suzuki [59], 1951).
• If G is solvable, then H is also solvable (Suzuki [59], 1951; Zappa [67], 1951;
Schmidt [50], 1968).
• If G is simple, then H is also simple (Suzuki [59], 1951; extension to inﬁnite
groups: Zacher [66], 1982). Moreover, using the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple
groups, it follows that H ∼= G.
Without using the classiﬁcation (of course), Michio Suzuki proved a result which
will motivate our investigations in the ﬁnal Section 6.
Theorem 2.12 (Suzuki [59], 1951) If G is a ﬁnite simple group and Sub(H) ∼=
Sub(G × G), then H ∼= G × G.
We will look at the question, whether the lattice Sub(G × · · · × G) can be used
to characterize the group G.

Local stucture
In this section we are going to study the local structure of subgroup lattices, that is,
the possible intervals Int[H; K] = {X | H ≤X ≤K} in subgroup lattices Sub(G)
(where H < K ≤G). Clearly, we can restrict our attention to top intervals (what
lattice theorists call principal ﬁlters), where K = G (see Figure 4). Also, if N ◁G
with N ≤H, then obviously Int[H; G] ∼= Int[H/N; G/N], hence we may — and
will — always assume that H is core-free, i.e., 
g∈G gHg−1 = 1.
It is easy to see, that intervals in algebraic lattices are algebraic lattices them-
selves, hence every interval in a subgroup lattice is an algebraic lattice. Namely,
a subgroup X ∈Int[H; G] is a compact element of the interval if and only if it

is ﬁnitely generated over H, i.e., X = ⟨H, g1, . . . , gk⟩for a suitable ﬁnite set of
elements g1, . . . , gk ∈G.
Indeed, there is nothing more one can say about the local structure of subgroup
lattices as the following deep result of Jiˇr´ı T˚uma shows.
Theorem 3.1 (T˚uma [62], 1989) For every algebraic lattice L there exist groups
H < G such that Int[H; G] ∼= L.
It should be noted that T˚uma’s ingenious construction always yields inﬁnite
groups G, even for ﬁnite lattices L. Hence we have the following open problem.
Problem 3.2 Is it true that for every ﬁnite lattice L there exist ﬁnite groups
H < G such that Int[H; G] ∼= L ?
The problem actually originates from universal algebra, so let us make a short
detour to this area. The reader should be reminded of Graham Higman’s witty
remarks about Cohn’s Universal Algebra [19]1:
“Universal algebra is something everyone ought to know about, though nobody
should specialize in it (from which it might appear to follow that though everyone
ought to read this book, nobody should have written it). From the point of view of
the working algebraist, its main function is to remind him that there are several
levels of generality at which work can proﬁtably be done, and that, to get the best
out of a method, it is necessary to set it at the right level.”
In what follows I try to present a problem in universal algebra which had made
me think that it is worthwhile specializing in universal algebra, before I realized
that it is in fact a problem in group theory.
By an algebra A = (A; F) we mean a nonempty set A equipped with a set of
operations F, that is, each f ∈F is a map f : An(f) →A for a suitable n(f), called
the arity of f. For example, in a group we have three operations: multiplication
(binary), inverse (unary), and the identity element (considered a nullary operation
G0 →G). In a lattice we have two binary operations: join and meet. The obvious
deﬁnitions for subalgebras, homomorphisms, direct products make sense in this
general setting as well.
1I thank Πeter Neumann for calling my attention to Higman’s review.

However, for arbitrary algebras the kernel of a homomorphism ϕ : A →B cannot
be deﬁned in the way it is done in the case of groups, namely, as a preimage of a
speciﬁc element of B; not even for a homomorphism between lattices (cf. Figure 5).
Figure 5. Kernel of a lattice homomorphism
Instead, the appropriate deﬁnition of the kernel gives a binary relation
ker ϕ = {(a, a′) ∈A2 | ϕ(a) = ϕ(a′)}.
In fact, α = ker ϕ is a congruence relation, that is, an equivalence relation compat-
ible with all operations f ∈F, i.e., if f is n-ary, and a1, . . . , an, a′
1, . . . , a′
n ∈A are
such that (ai, a′
i) ∈α for all i = 1, . . . , n then

f(a1, . . . , an), f(a′
1, . . . , a′
n)

∈α.
All congruence relations of an algebra A form an algebraic lattice Con A, the
congruence lattice of A. For a group G the congruence lattice is essentially the
same as the normal subgroup lattice Norm(G). Apart from being algebraic there
is no other general property of congruence lattices as the following classical result
of universal algebra tells us.
Theorem 3.3 (Gr¨atzer and Schmidt [15], 1963) For every algebraic lattice L there
exists an algebra A such that Con A ∼= L.
If we have a group G and a subgroup H < G, then we can consider the per-
mutation representation of G on the left cosets by H as a multi-unary algebra
A = (G/H; G), where g ∈G as a unary operation sends the coset xH ∈G/H
to gxH. Now it is easy to see that the congruence lattice of this multi-unary al-
gebra, Con A ∼= Int[H; G]. So T˚uma’s Theorem 3.1 yields a new proof for the
Gr¨atzer–Schmidt Theorem.
Both of these proofs are inherently inﬁnite. Namely, the basic idea — without
going into technical details — can be summarized in the following steps, construct-
ing recursively an inﬁnite sequence of algebras (or groups) A1, A2, A3, . . . (see
Figure 6):
1. take Ai and list all the “troubles” occurring in Ai;

2. add new elements and extend the operations so that these “troubles” are
eliminated and call the extended algebra Ai+1;
3. repeat.
Finally, in A = ∞
i=1 Ai all “troubles” disappear, and it will have the required
congruence lattice.
Clearly, every ﬁnite lattice is algebraic.
Therefore, the ﬁnite version of the
congruence lattice representation problem arises naturally.
Problem 3.4 Is it true that for every ﬁnite lattice L there exists a ﬁnite algebra
A such that Con A ∼= L ?
Although arbitrary algebras are allowed here, the core of the problem is group
theoretic, as the following result shows.
Theorem 3.5 (P´alfy and Pudl´ak [42], 1980) The following are equivalent:
(i) Every ﬁnite lattice occurs as the congruence lattice of some ﬁnite algebra.
(ii) Every ﬁnite lattice occurs as an interval in the subgroup lattice of some ﬁnite
group.
Using the multi-unary algebra arising from the permutation representation of G
on the left cosets by H, it is obvious that (ii) implies (i). The point here is that the
converse is also true. Note that, in the case when both statements were false, we do
not claim that every ﬁnite lattice which is a congruence lattice of a ﬁnite algebra
is in fact an interval in the subgroup lattice of a ﬁnite group. Quite possibly, there
can be more lattices that are not intervals in subgroup lattices of ﬁnite groups,
than lattices that are not congruence lattices of ﬁnite algebras.
The “tame congruence theory” developed by David Hobby and Ralph McKenzie
[21] shows that in every ﬁnite algebra with a certain type of congruence lattice
there are some subsets (the so-called minimal sets) on which the induced algebras
are actually permutation groups with the same congruence lattice as the one of the
original algebra. Therefore, Problem 3.4 in fact belongs to group theory, not to
universal algebra.
Special attention has been given to ﬁnite lattices with the simplest structure.
These lattices Mn consist of a smallest, a greatest, and n pairwise incomparable
elements (see Figure 7).

438
P´ALFY
Figure 7. The lattice Mn
Some of these lattices are easy to represent as intervals, even as subgroup lattices.
Namely, M1 = Sub(Cp2) for any prime p; M2 = Sub(Cpq) for any pair of distinct
primes p, q; Mp+1 = Sub(Cp × Cp) for each prime p, but also this is the subgroup
lattice of any nonabelian group of order pq, where q is a prime divisor of p −1.
If n = pk + 1 for some prime p and exponent k ≥1, then it is also possible to
ﬁnd suitable intervals Int[H; G] = Mn. Namely, let V be the 2-dimensional vector
space over the Galois ﬁeld GF(pk) = F and take
G = {x →λx + v | λ ∈F ×, v ∈V },
H = {x →λx | λ ∈F ×}.
Then every intermediate subgroup H ≤K ≤G has the form
K = {x →λx + v | λ ∈F ×, v ∈U}
for a suitable subspace U ≤V , so Int[H; G] is just the lattice of subspaces of V .
For quite a while it had been conjectured that these are the only Mn’s occurring
as intervals in subgroup lattices of ﬁnite groups. However, this is not the case, as
it was ﬁrst pointed out by Walter Feit. In formulating his observation we shall use
the following notation. If p > 2 is a prime and d | (p −1)/2 then up to conjugacy
there is a unique subgroup of order pd in the alternating group Ap, which we will
denote simply by p · d.
Example 3.6 (Feit [11], 1983)
(1) M7 = Int[31 · 5, A31], the intermediate subgroups are the normalizer 31 · 15
of 31 · 5 and six subgroups isomorphic to GL5(2).
(2) M11 = Int[31 · 3, A31], the intermediate subgroups are the normalizer 31 · 15
of 31 · 3 and ten subgroups isomorphic to PSL3(5).
These examples cannot be generalized (see also [40]).
Theorem 3.7 (Basile [5], 2001) If Int[H; G] ∼= Mn with G = Sd or Ad, then either
n ≤3 or one of the following holds: n = 5, d = 13; n = 7, d = 31; n = 11, d = 31.
Much later a new series of examples was found by Andrea Lucchini.

GROUPS AND LATTICES
439
Theorem 3.8 (Lucchini [31], 1994) There exist intervals Mn in subgroup lattices
of ﬁnite groups with
n = q + 2
or
n = qt + 1
q + 1 + 1,
where q is a prime power and t is an odd prime.
At present the smallest cases for which no occurrence of Mn is known are n = 16,
23, 35, . . . . In a seminal paper Baddeley and Lucchini [2] analyse the structure of
a hypothetical group providing an example of an interval Mn with n not belonging
to the set of known values. More precisely, they make the following assumptions.
Assumptions. Let n > 50,
n /∈

q + 1, q + 2, qt + 1
q + 1 + 1
			 q a prime power, t an odd prime

,
and assume that there exist ﬁnite groups H < G such that Int[H; G] ∼= Mn.
Furthermore, let G be the smallest one among all groups with this property.
Then, by a result of Peter K¨ohler [27], G has a unique minimal normal sub-
group M, and M is nonabelian (see [42]). So M is a direct product of isomorphic
nonabelian simple groups. Let F denote one of the simple factors.
The case when M ∩H ̸= 1 was dealt with by Lucchini [32] in 1994. He proved
that in this case M itself is simple, so G is an almost simple group. So we suppose
that M ∩H = 1. We distinguish two cases, namely, whether MH = G or MH < G.
It can be shown that M is complemented in the second case as well, that is,
G = MK and M ∩K = 1 with a suitable subgroup K > H. Now G has the
structure of a twisted wreath product of F and K.
Baddeley and Lucchini derive the following properties of the ingredients of this
twisted wreath product:
• K is an almost simple group,
• H is a core-free maximal subgroup of K,
• Q = NK(F) is a core-free subgroup of K,
• K = QH,
• the homomorphism ϕ : Q →Aut F satisﬁes ϕ(Q ∩H) ≥Inn F,
• ϕ|Q∩H has no extension to any subgroup of H properly containing Q ∩H.
Furthermore, n −1 is the number of those homomorphisms ψ : Q →Aut F
for which ψ|Q∩H = ϕ|Q∩H and ˜ψ = ˜ϕ hold, where ˜ϕ denotes the composition of
ϕ with the natural homomorphism onto the outer automorphism group Out F =
Aut F/Inn F.
It should be noted, however, that no such example is known with n ≥3.
The case MH = G leads to even more complex technical conditions, which we
cannot reproduce here in full detail. We only mention that in this case H has a
unique minimal normal subgroup N, which is a direct product of isomorphic copies
of a nonabelian simple group E, and F is isomorphic to a section of E.
These reductions raise several problems about simple groups. We quote only
two of them here.

P´ALFY
Problem 3.9 (Baddeley and Lucchini [2], 1997) Describe the maximal nonabelian
simple sections of the nonabelian simple groups.
Problem 3.10 (Baddeley and Lucchini [2], 1997) Describe all pairs (F, L) where
F is a nonabelian simple group and L is a group of automorphisms of F such that
there is exactly one proper nontrivial L-invariant subgroup of F.
Another important development concerning the local structure of subgroup lat-
tices of ﬁnite groups is a recent result of Ferdinand B¨orner. He was able to reduce
Problem 3.2 to two special cases.
Theorem 3.11 (B¨orner [8], 1999) Every ﬁnite lattice is an interval in the subgroup
lattice of some ﬁnite group if and only if at least one of the following statements is
true:
(C) For every ﬁnite lattice L there exist ﬁnite groups H < G such that Int[H; G]
∼= L, with the following properties: G has a unique minimal normal subgroup M,
M ∩H = 1, MH = G, M is nonabelian, and if F denotes one of the simple direct
factors of M and Q = NH(F), then Q induces all inner automorphisms of F and
Q is core-free in H.
(D) For every ﬁnite lattice L which is generated by its coatoms (maximal ele-
ments) there exist ﬁnite groups H < G such that Int[H; G] ∼= L, where G is an
almost simple group and H is core-free in G.
The condition on the lattice in (D) is not very restrictive, as every ﬁnite lat-
tice can be embedded as an interval into a ﬁnite lattice which is generated by its
coatoms. The key of B¨orner’s tricky construction is to embed the given lattice as
an interval into a larger lattice as it is vaguely sketched in Figure 8. If this larger
lattice occurs as an interval in the subgroup lattice of a ﬁnite group, then this
group must have a very restricted structure.
Figure 8. B¨orner’s construction
Similar arguments can be found in a paper of Robert Baddeley [1]. The key words
in these investigations are quasiprimitive groups and twisted wreath products.
Let me end this section with some speculation concerning statement (C). It is
so restrictive that probably it can be proved to be false, and then the problem

GROUPS AND LATTICES
441
would be reduced to the case of almost simple groups. Then it would remain to
do a case-by-case analysis, like it has been done for the alternating and symmetric
groups by Alberto Basile (see Theorem 3.7).
Although it seems unlikely that (C) is true, but if it is, it may be proved “combi-
natorially”, without relying much on the structure of the simple group F (similarly
as in Lucchini’s construction proving Theorem 3.8).
Here we could summarize only the most important developments concerning
Problem 3.2. Some other aspects of it are discussed in more detail in [41].

Laws in normal subgroup lattices
It is well-known that normal subgroup lattices are modular. Modular lattices can
be deﬁned via a number of equivalent conditions.
The most useful form is an
implication (Horn-formula):
X ≥Z
⇒
(X ∧Y ) ∨Z = X ∧(Y ∨Z).
Since the left hand side is always smaller than or equal to the right hand side, it
can be formulated as an inequality as well:
X ≥Z
⇒
(X ∧Y ) ∨Z ≥X ∧(Y ∨Z).
The assumption X ≥Z can be eliminated by replacing Z with X∧Z, thus obtaining
the modular law:
(X ∧Y ) ∨(X ∧Z) = X ∧[Y ∨(X ∧Z)].
A characterization of modular lattices can be given by a forbidden sublattice as
well:
A lattice is modular if and only if it contains no sublattice
.
The modular law was discovered by Richard Dedekind [10] in 1877. He studied
the subgroup lattice of the additive group of complex numbers, but the proof is
clearly the same for the subgroup lattice of any abelian group. Dedekind called a
subgroup “Modul” and denoted the join of two subgroups by a + b and their meet
by a −b. So the modular law in Dedekind’s work appears in the form
(a −b) + (a −c) = a −(b + (a −c))
and its dual
(a + b) −(a + c) = a + (b −(a + c))
(see [10, p. 17]).
We will consider laws of normal subgroup lattices for various classes of groups.
Let V be a class of groups, P, Q terms in the language of lattices (i.e., elements of
the free lattice). P ≤Q is a law in the normal subgroup lattices of V if for every

442
P´ALFY
G ∈V the inequality P ≤Q holds in Norm(G) if we arbitrarily substitute normal
subgroups of G for the variables in the terms P, Q and evaluate these terms in
Norm(G). Of course, in Norm(G) the lattice operations are given by intersection
and product:
X ∧Y = X ∩Y,
X ∨Y = XY.
We will often use inequalities instead of equalities, but these are certainly equiv-
alent to each other:
P ≤Q ⇐⇒P ∨Q = Q,
P = Q ⇐⇒P ∨Q ≤P ∧Q.
There exist laws of normal subgroup lattices that are even stronger than modu-
larity. The most important one is the arguesian law introduced by Bjarni J´onsson
[24] in 1954. (The idea appeared earlier in a paper of Sch¨utzenberger [56] in 1945.)
This is a translation of Desargues’ Theorem from projective geometry into the lan-
guage of lattices. Among the several equivalent formulations we prefer the following
form:
X1 ∧{Y1 ∨[(X2 ∨Y2) ∧(X3 ∨Y3)]} ≤[(Q12 ∨Q23) ∧(Y1 ∨Y3)] ∨X3,
where Qij = (Xi ∨Xj) ∧(Yi ∨Yj).
Figure 9. Desargues’ Theorem
Consider the subspace lattice of a projective plane. There the join of two points
is the line connecting them, the meet of two lines is their intersection point. Now
if X1X2X3 and Y1Y2Y3 are triangles in a projective plane that are perspective with
respect to a point (i.e., the lines X1Y1, X2Y2, X3Y3 go through a common point)
then the left hand side of the arguesian law yields the point X1, otherwise it yields
the empty set. At the same time, the right hand side is ≥X1 if and only if the
two triangles are perspective with respect to a line (i.e., if the intersection of the
corresponding sides XiXj and YiYj are denoted by Qij, then the three points Q12,
Q13 and Q23 lie on one line). The reader is strongly advised to check this using
Figure 9. It is a tedious but dull task to show that if the arguesian law holds for the
points of the subspace lattice of a projective geometry then it holds for arbitrary

GROUPS AND LATTICES
443
substitution of elements of the lattice (see [14, p. 207]). So the arguesian law holds
in the subspace lattice of a projective plane if and only if Desargues’ Theorem is
true in the geometry. Since there are nonarguesian planes, the arguesian law is
stronger than the modular law, as the subspace lattice is always modular.
Theorem 4.1 (J´onsson [24], 1954) The arguesian law holds in the normal subgroup
lattice of every group.
In fact the arguesian law holds in every lattice consisting of permuting equiva-
lence relations. (Two equivalence relations α and β are said to permute if β ◦α =
α ◦β, where the relational product is deﬁned by
α ◦β = {(a, b) | ∃c : (a, c) ∈α, (c, b) ∈β}.
For every normal subgroup N ◁G there corresponds an equivalence relation αN =
{(a, b) | a, b ∈G, a−1b ∈N}, and αK ◦αN = αKN = αN ◦αK, since KN = NK
for normal subgroups N, K ◁G.)
Proof Let X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3 ◁G and x1 ∈X1∧{Y1∨[(X2∨Y2)∧(X3∨Y3)]} =
X1 ∩Y1[X2Y2 ∩X3Y3]. Then there exist elements xi ∈Xi, yi ∈Yi, m ∈G such
that x1 = my−1
1
(using Y1M = MY −1

) and m = x2y2 = x3y3.
So we have
x1y1 = x2y2 = x3y3, x−1

where Qij = (Xi∨Xj)∧(Yi∨Yj), each one being strictly stronger than the previous
one, that all hold in every lattice consisting of permuting equivalence relations.
Later it was proved by Ralph Freese [12] that there is no ﬁnite basis for the laws of
the class of all normal subgroup lattices. Like the modular and the arguesian laws,
the higher arguesian identities hold not only in subgroup lattices of abelian groups
(as suggested by the underlying geometry), but also in normal subgroup lattices
of arbitrary groups. Based on such experiences a positive solution of the following
problem had been expected.
Problem 4.2 (J´onsson [24], 1954; Birkhoﬀ[7, p. 179], 1967) Can one embed the
normal subgroup lattice of an arbitrary group into the subgroup lattice of an abelian
group?
Do all the laws of subgroup lattices of abelian groups hold in normal
subgroup lattices?
Another reason pointing towards a positive solution was the following observa-
tion:

Proposition 4.3 If M3 is a sublattice of Norm(G) with top element N, bottom
element M, then N/M is abelian (see Figure 10).

Figure 10. Abelian section in a normal subgroup lattice
However, together with my student Csaba Szab´o we found another lattice iden-
tity with geometric background that shows that the normal subgroup lattice of
some groups cannot be embedded into the subgroup lattice of any abelian group.
A short proof for the nonembeddability of Norm(G) for a certain group G of order
29 is given in [25].
Theorem 4.4 (P´alfy and Szab´o [44], 1995) The six-cross law
X1 ∧{Y1 ∨[(X2 ∨Y2) ∧(X3 ∨Y3) ∧(X4 ∨Y4)]} ≤
({[(P12 ∨P34) ∧(P13 ∨P24)] ∨P23} ∧{X4 ∨Y1}) ∨Y4,
where Pij = (Xi ∨Yj) ∧(Yi ∨Xj), holds in the subgroup lattice of every abelian
group but fails in the normal subgroup lattice of the free group on ﬁve generators.
Another version of this law was given in [43].
Again, our six-cross law is a lattice theoretic translation of a geometric property
(see Figure 11). Take four lines through a point, and two points Xi, Yi on each
of these lines (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). For each pair of lines deﬁne the cross point Pij as
the intersection of the lines XiYj and YiXj. We say that the six-cross theorem
holds in the projective plane, if the three lines P12P34, P13P24, and P14P23 go
through a common point. (Actually, we need a more precise deﬁnition handling
the degenerate cases as well, for example if some of the cross points coincide.
An interesting case occurs when P12 = P34, P13 = P24, P14 = P23. This is the
famous Reye-conﬁguration, see [20, §22]. For these details we refer to [44].) For a
projective geometry the six-cross theorem is equivalent to Desargues’ theorem, but
their lattice theoretic counterparts diﬀer. The six-cross law implies the arguesian
law, but the converse does not hold.
Although in the formulation of Theorem 4.4 we used a free group, actually there
exist ﬁnite quotients of the free group of rank 5 whose normal subgroup lattices
do not satisfy the six-cross law. Moreover, it is enough to consider ﬁnite nilpotent
groups, or p-groups, as the following lemma (see [34, p. 41]) shows.
Lemma 4.5 Let |G| = pk1
1 · · · pkn
n , and Pi a Sylow pi-subgroup of G for each i = 1,
. . . , n. Then Norm(G) is embedded into Norm(P1 × · · · × Pn) via N →(N ∩P1) ×
· · · × (N ∩Pn).

So if the normal subgroup lattice of a ﬁnite group does not satisfy a certain
law, then the same is true for at least one of its Sylow subgroups. If we want to
work with a group of nilpotence class 2, then we better look for 2-groups, since for
groups of odd order the following trick of Reinhold Baer yields an embedding of
the normal subgroup lattice into the subgroup lattice of an abelian group deﬁned
on the same set of elements.
Lemma 4.6 (Baer [3], 1938) If G of odd order has nilpotence class 2, then
x + y = x1/2yx1/2
(x1/2 = x(|G|+1)/2)
deﬁnes an abelian group operation.
Corollary 4.7 If G of odd order has nilpotence class 2, then Norm(G) can be
embedded into the subgroup lattice of an abelian group.
Proof Denote by G+ the abelian group deﬁned in Lemma 4.6.
Clearly every
normal subgroup of G is a subgroup of G+.
We have to check that for every
X, Y ◁G the lattice operations are the same in Norm(G) and in Sub(G+). This
is trivially true for the meet (intersection), and it is also true for the join, because
the join in Norm(G) is a common upper bound for X and Y in Sub(G+) as well,
and the order formula yields that it is indeed the least upper bound:
|X ∨Y | = |XY | = |X| · |Y |
|X ∩Y | = |X + Y |.

Therefore, we take the smallest noncommutative variety of 2-groups, namely let
V be the group variety deﬁned by x4 = 1 and x2y = yx2. (This is the variety
generated by any of the 8-element noncommutative groups.) In the (relatively)
free groups FV(r) in V with generators g1, . . . , gr the elements have a normal form
gα1
1 · · · gαr
r [g1, g2]β12[g1, g3]β13 · · · [gr−1, gr]βr−1,r
with 0 ≤αi < 4 (1 ≤i ≤r), 0 ≤βij < 2 (1 ≤i < j ≤r). Hence
|FV(r)| = 4r2r(r−1)/2 = 2(r2+3r)/2.
A tedious calculation gives that the normal subgroup lattice of G = FV(5) of
order 220 does not satisfy the six-cross law. Namely, we have to choose Xi = ⟨gi⟩G,
Yi = ⟨gig5⟩G
(i = 1, . . . , 4), where ⟨. . .⟩G denotes the generated normal subgroup.
However, the six-cross law holds in the normal subgroup lattice of every group
of odd order ([61]). Csaba Szab´o [61] exhibited a law of the subgroup lattices of
abelian groups that fails in the normal subgroup lattice of a group of order 3140.
(The calculations have been performed using GAP [55].)
For larger primes the embedding given by Lemma 4.6 can be generalized for
groups of larger nilpotence class:
Theorem 4.8 (Groves [16], 1976) If the nilpotence class of a ﬁnite p-group is less
than p, then there exists a term deﬁning an abelian group operation. Therefore, the
normal subgroup lattice of such a group can be embedded into the subgroup lattice
of an abelian group.
In fact, the formula for the abelian group operation can be obtained from
Lazard’s inversion of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀformula (see [30])
x + y = xy[x, y]−1/2[[x, y], x]1/12[[x, y], y]−1/12 · · · .
If the nilpotence class of the p-group is less than p, then this inﬁnite product can be
truncated at commutators of weight p or less, and the necessary roots in the group
exist (as the denominators are not divisible by p). It is even enough to assume
that every 3-generated subgroup has nilpotence class less than p. Is this the limit
indeed?
Problem 4.9 For every prime p ﬁnd a law of the subgroup lattices of abelian
groups that fails in the normal subgroup lattice of a ﬁnite p-group of nilpotence
class p.
We end this section by mentioning a nice result that the exponent of a group
variety can be recovered from the laws satisﬁed by the normal subgroup lattices.
Theorem 4.10 (Herrmann and Huhn [18], 1975) The law
(X1 ∨. . . ∨Xn) ∧(Y ∨Z) ≤
n
i=1
[(X1 ∨. . . ∨Xi−1 ∨Y ∨Xi+1 ∨. . . ∨Xn) ∧(Xi ∨Z)]
holds in Norm(G) for every group of exponent dividing n (i.e., ∀g ∈G : gn = 1),
but if k does not divide n then it fails in Norm(Cn+1
k
).

Distributive normal subgroup lattices
It seems to be a diﬃcult task to describe the possible normal subgroup lattices.
In Section 4 we discussed certain laws that must hold in every normal subgroup
lattice. However, these are not suﬃcient to characterize normal subgroup lattices,
since this class of lattices is not closed for sublattices, as one can easily check that
M5 is not isomorphic to the normal subgroup lattice of any group, although for
each prime number p one has Mp ∼= Norm(Cp × Cp).
In this section we have a modest goal to represent ﬁnite distributive lattices as
normal subgroup lattices.
Theorem 5.1 For every ﬁnite distributive lattice D there exists a ﬁnite group G
such that Norm(G) ∼= D.
This result has an interesting history. It was ﬁrst announced by Kuntzmann
[28] in 1947. However, his proof was in error, and it could not be corrected, since
he tried to construct a supersolvable group G for any ﬁnite distributive lattice
D.
In fact, it is not diﬃcult to show that not every ﬁnite distributive lattice
can be represented as the normal subgroup lattice of a supersolvable group (see
Figure 12). E. T. Schmidt [49, p. 101] listed Theorem 5.1 as an open problem,
noting that Kuntzmann’s proof was not correct.
Figure 12. This is not the normal subgroup lattice of any supersolvable group
Finally, Howard Silcock [57] proved the theorem in 1977.
He constructed a
suitable group G as an iterated wreath product of nonabelian simple groups.
In 1986 I gave a natural construction which yields solvable groups (see [38], [39]).
Now I am going to sketch this construction.
First recall a condition characterizing when Norm(G) is distributive. Remember
that the socle of a group is the product of its minimal normal subgroups, and
that two normal subgroups N1 and N2 are said to be G-isomorphic, if there is
an isomorphism ϕ : N1 →N2 such that ϕ(gxg−1) = gϕ(x)g−1 for all g ∈G and
x ∈N1.

Theorem 5.2 (Pazderski [45], 1987) For a ﬁnite group G the normal subgroup
lattice Norm(G) is distributive if and only if the socle of every quotient group G/N
is a direct product of pairwise non-G/N-isomorphic minimal normal subgroups.
We shall give a recursive proof of Theorem 5.1.
In the groups we are going
to construct every chief factor will be a Sylow subgroup, and so Pazderski’s cri-
terion will obviously be satisﬁed, hence the normal subgroup lattice will become
distributive.
Let us start by choosing an atom a ∈D and let a′ ∈D be a pseudocomplement
of a, that is, a′ is the largest element with a′ ∧a = 0. (By distributivity, if b∧a = 0
and c∧a = 0, then (b∨c)∧a = (b∧a)∨(c∧a) = 0∨0 = 0, so the pseudocomplement
exists.) Now by induction we can ﬁnd a group H with Norm(H) ∼= Int[a; 1]. Let us
denote by K ◁H the normal subgroup corresponding to a∨a′ at this isomorphism.
Next we choose a prime p not dividing |H|. Since in H/K no two minimal normal
subgroups are isomorphic we can invoke a result of Kochend¨orﬀer [26] from 1948
guaranteeing the existence of a faithful irreducible representation of H/K over the
p-element ﬁeld. Let us denote the underlying module by V , and let us take the
natural action of H on V with kernel K.
We claim that the semidirect product G = V H will have the required normal
subgroup lattice Norm(G) ∼= D.
By the irreducibility of the action, V is a minimal normal subgroup of G. If
N ◁G, then either N ≥V or N ∩V = 1. In the ﬁrst case N/V ◁G/V ∼= H. In
the second case N ≤CG(V ) = V × K, so N ≤K, since (|N|, |V |) = 1. Now it is
clear that Norm(G) ∼= D.
Since the subgroups of G × G containing the diagonal subgroup correspond to
the normal subgroups of G, namely they have the form HN = {(a, b) ∈G × G |
aN = bN} for N ◁G, we obtain the following corollary related to the results of
Section 3.
Corollary 5.3 For every ﬁnite distributive lattice D there exists a ﬁnite group G
such that for H = {(g, g) | g ∈G} we have Int[H; G × G] ∼= D.
A similar idea, using higher powers, can be used to turn intervals upside-down
(called the dual lattice).
Theorem 5.4 (Kurzweil [29], 1985) The class of intervals in subgroup lattices of
ﬁnite groups is closed under taking dual lattices.
Proof Let L = Int[H; G], with |G : H| = n and take an arbitrary nonabelian
simple group S. Consider the permutation representation of G on the cosets of
H and let this permutation group act on Sn by permuting the coordinates.
If
G∗= SnG and H∗= {(s, . . . , s) | s ∈S}G, then it can be checked that Int[H∗; G∗]
is isomorphic to the dual lattice of L.

Subgroup lattices of direct powers
The problem we are going to discuss in this section is motivated by the following
classical result of Michio Suzuki.
Theorem 6.1 (Suzuki [59], 1951) If G is a ﬁnite simple group and Sub(H) ∼=
Sub(G × G), then H ∼= G × G.
This result was later generalized by Roland Schmidt.
Theorem 6.2 (Schmidt [51], 1981) If G is a ﬁnite group with G′ = G, Z(G) = 1,
and Sub(H) ∼= Sub(G × G), then H ∼= G × G.
However, we cannot always expect that Sub(H) ∼= Sub(G × G) would imply
H ∼= G × G. Namely, let p be a prime and q another prime, dividing p −1. Then
for any d ≥2, Sub(Cd
p) ∼= Sub(G), where G = A⟨b⟩is a so-called P-group with
A = Cd−1
p
and b of order q acting by a power automorphism on A (bab−1 = ar,
where rq ≡1, r ̸≡1
(mod p)). Instead, we can ask the following question.
Problem 6.3 Does Sub(G×G) ∼= Sub(H×H) imply that G and H are isomorphic
groups? In other words, does the subgroup lattice of the direct square uniquely
determine the group?
Suzuki’s Theorem 6.1 shows that for simple groups this is indeed the case. On
the other end of the spectrum there are the abelian groups.
Theorem 6.4 (Luk´acs and P´alfy [33], 1986) For a ﬁnite abelian group G, if
Sub(G × G) ∼= Sub(H × H), then G and H are isomorphic.
This result follows easily from the following observation.
Theorem 6.5 (Luk´acs and P´alfy [33], 1986) Sub(G × G) is modular if and only
if G is abelian.
Nevertheless, Problem 6.3 has a negative answer. Counterexamples are provided
by the Rottlaender groups introduced by Ada Rottlaender [47] in 1928. Let p, q ≥5
be primes with q | p −1. Then there exists r ̸≡1
(mod p) such that rq ≡1
(mod p). For each λ ∈{2, . . . , q −2} we deﬁne the group
Rλ = ⟨x, y, a | xp = yp = aq = [x, y] = 1, axa−1 = xr, aya−1 = yrλ⟩.
Roland Schmidt observed the following.
Example 6.6 (Schmidt [51], 1981) Sub(Rλ × Rλ) ∼= Sub(Rµ × Rµ), but Rλ ∼= Rµ
only if λ = µ or λµ ≡1
(mod q)

450
P´ALFY
However, it can be checked that for nonisomorphic Rottlaender groups Rλ, Rµ
the third powers have nonisomorphic subgroup lattices:
Sub(Rλ × Rλ × Rλ) ̸∼= Sub(Rµ × Rµ × Rµ).
This indicated that perhaps the answer to the following question might be pos-
itive.
Problem 6.7 Does Sub(G × G × G) uniquely determine G? (That is, assuming
Sub(G × G × G) ∼= Sub(H × H × H), does it follow that G and H are isomorphic?)
Another result where third powers play a crucial role is the following one.
Theorem 6.8 (Baer [4], 1939) Let G be an abelian p-group, H an abelian group.
Assume that for each prime power pk, if G contains an element of order pk, then it
contains at least three independent elements of this order (i.e., a subgroup isomor-
phic to Cpk × Cpk × Cpk). Then every projectivity (lattice isomorphism) between
Sub(G) and Sub(H) is induced by an isomorphism between the groups G and H.
It should be noted, however, that one cannot hope to prove that every isomor-
phism between Sub(G × · · · × G) and Sub(H × · · · × H) is induced by a group
isomorphism, as the following example shows.
Example 6.9 (Schmidt [52], 1982) Let p be a prime, q and r prime divisors of
p −1, and let G be the direct product of the nonabelian groups of order pq and
pr. Then for every d ≥1, Sub(Gd) has lattice automorphisms (autoprojectivities)
that are not induced by group automorphisms.
Note that the order of elements can be recovered from Sub(G × G), and then
from the subgroup lattices of higher powers as well.
Lemma 6.10 If Sub(X) ∼= Mn, then either
(1) X ∼= Cp2 and n = 1; or
(2) X ∼= Cpq and n = 2; or
(3) X ∼= Cp × Cp and n = p + 1; or
(4) X is a nonabelian group of order pq, q | p −1 and n = p + 1.
Corollary 6.11 If P < G × G has order p, then there exists P < X0 ≤G × G
such that Int[1; X0] ∼= Mp+1 (in fact, X0 ∼= Cp × Cp), and if P < X ≤G × G is
such that Int[1; X] ∼= Mn then either n ≤2 or n ≥p + 1. Hence
p = min {n −1 | n > 2, ∃X > P : Int[1; X] ∼= Mn}.
So we can ﬁnd the order of each minimal subgroup in Sub(G×G). Furthermore,
if Int[1; H] is a chain of length k, then |H| = pk, where p is the order of the unique
minimal subgroup contained in H. Thus p-subgroups can be identiﬁed, and the
order of every subgroup can be determined.

Schmidt [54, 7.6.11 Problem] considers a closely related question.
Let ϕ :
Sub(G1 × · · · × Gn) →Sub(H) be a lattice isomorphism (projectivity), where
all direct factors G1, . . . , Gn are isomorphic to a given group G. Assume that
H = ϕ(G1) × · · · × ϕ(Gn). Does it follow that ϕ(G1) ∼= G1? Concerning this
problem there are some positive results, for example in the following cases:
• if G has a self-centralizing normal Hall subgroup (Schmidt [52], 1982);
• if G is a ﬁnite p-group and one of the the following holds:
– (a) G has nilpotence class 2, p ̸= 2, n ≥3;
– (b) G has class ≤4 and exponent p, n ≥2;
– (c) G is metabelian of exponent p, n ≥p −2 (Schenke [48], 1987).
Only after the meeting in Oxford I heard about an apparently forgotten pa-
per by Anne Penfold Street [58]2 that implicitly contains the negative solution of
Problem 6.7.
Example 6.12 (Street [58], 1968) There exist nonisomorphic groups (G, ◦) and
(G, ∗) on the same base set such that for each n ≥1 their direct powers (G, ◦)n
and (G, ∗)n have exactly the same subgroups.
Proof Let us choose prime numbers p and q subject to the following restrictions:
q ≡1
(mod 3), p ≡1
(mod 3q). Furthermore, let m have order 3 modulo p
and let n have order 3 modulo q (i.e., m3 ≡1
(mod p) and m ̸≡1
(mod p)).
Consider the group
G(m, n) = ⟨s, t, u | sp = tq = u3 = [s, t] = 1, usu−1 = sm, utu−1 = tn⟩
and denote the operation also by ◦. If we deﬁne x∗y = xy[x, y]p−1 then it turns out
that ∗is also a group operation and the group deﬁned this way is G(m2, n) which
is not isomorphic to G(m, n). Now ◦can be expressed in the same way from ∗(in
the language of universal algebra (G, ◦) and (G, ∗) are term equivalent), therefore
exactly the same subsets of the cartesian powers of the base set are closed for the
operation ◦that are closed for ∗, that is the powers of both groups have the same
subgroup lattice. For the calculations the reader is referred to [58, Example V.(i)].
2
Thus even the subgroup lattices of all powers of G are not suﬃcient to determine
the isomorphism type of G. However, it still may be true that if the subgroup
lattices of some power distinguish two groups than already the third powers do.
Problem 6.13 If Sub(G × G × G) ∼= Sub(H × H × H), does it follow that G and
H are term equivalent groups?

Abstract
An ordinary tetrahedron group is a group with a presentation of the form
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = (xy−1)f1 = (yz−1)f2 = (zx−1)f3 = 1⟩
where ei ≥2 and fi ≥2 for all i. Following Vinberg, we call groups deﬁned by a
presentation of the form
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R1(x, y)f1 = R2(y, z)f2 = R3(z, x)f3 = 1⟩,
where each Ri(a, b) is a cyclically reduced word involving both a and b, generalized
tetrahedron groups. These groups appear in many contexts, not least as subgroups
of generalized triangle groups. In this paper, we build on previous work of Coxeter,
Edjvet, Fine, Howie, Levin, Metaftsis, Roehl, Rosenberger, Stille, Thomas, Tsara-
nov and Vinberg (amongst others) to give a classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite generalized
tetrahedron groups with a cubic relator.

Introduction and preliminary results
Consider a tetrahedron in either Euclidean, spherical or hyperbolic 3-space. The
reﬂections at the faces generate a group of isometries and we consider the subgroup
consisting of the orientation-preserving isometries. This subgroup is called an or-
dinary tetrahedron group and is the obvious analogy in 3-dimensional geometry of
an ordinary triangle group.
Coxeter showed (see [2], [3], [4]) that such a group has a presentation of the form
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = (xy−1)f1 = (yz−1)f2 = (zx−1)f3 = 1⟩.
So we have:
Deﬁnition 1.1 An ordinary tetrahedron group is a group G with a presentation
of the form
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = (xy−1)f1 = (yz−1)f2 = (zx−1)f3 = 1⟩
where ei ≥2 and fi ≥2 for all i.

has positive determinant (see [2], [3], [4]). We refer to this as the Coxeter criterion.
Deﬁnition 1.2 Following Vinberg, a generalized tetrahedron group is a group G
with a presentation of the form
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R1(x, y)f1 = R2(y, z)f2 = R3(z, x)f3 = 1⟩,
with e1, e2, e3, f1, f2, f3 ≥2 and R1(x, y) a cyclically reduced word in the free
product on x, y, which involves both x and y, R2(y, z) a cyclically reduced word
in the free product on y, z, which involves both y and z, and R3(z, x) a cyclically
reduced word in the free product on z, x, which involves both z and x. Further
each Ri, i = 1, 2, 3, is not a proper power in the free product on the generators it
involves.
□
We call two such presentations of generalized tetrahedron groups equivalent if
one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations of the following
type:
1. replace a generator u of order ei by a new generator d = uk, where k is
coprime to ei, and then amend the relations accordingly;
2. apply a permutation to the generators x, y and z;
3. if S(u, v) is a cyclically reduced conjugate of R(u, v) in the free group on u
and v, then replace the relator R(u, v)fi by S(u, v)fi;
4. replace the relator R(u, v)fi by S(u, v)fi, where S(u, v) is the inverse of R(u, v)
in the free group on u and v;
5. if u is a generator of order 2, if v is a generator of order e, if k and l are
coprime to e, and if we have a relator of the form R = (uvk)2, then replace
R by (uvl)2.
It is clear that, if two presentations are equivalent, then they deﬁne isomorphic
groups.
The most general result for large exponents fi was given by Edjvet, Howie,
Rosenberger and Thomas in [5]:
Theorem 1.3 Let G be a ﬁnite generalized tetrahedron group with a presentation
of the form
℘= ⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R1(x, y)f1 = R2(y, z)f2 = R3(z, x)f3 = 1⟩,
where at least one of the fi is greater than 3. Then ℘is equivalent to a presentation
of an ordinary tetrahedron group.

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS

In this paper we will show that, if 2 ≤f1, f2, f3 ≤3, at least one of the fi
equals 3 and G is ﬁnite, then the presentation for G is either equivalent to that
for an ordinary tetrahedron group or to one of the six presentations (1)-(6) listed
below.
For the beneﬁt of the reader we will state some more results (see, for instance,
[5]). We will use the following concepts:
a) a representation ρ : G →L, where L is a linear group, is called essential if
ρ(x) has order e1, ρ(y) has order e2, ρ(z) has order e3, and ρ(Rj) has order
fj for j = 1, 2, 3;
b) a subgroup of PSL(2, C) is called non-elementary if it contains a free subgroup
of rank 2.
Theorem 1.4 Every generalized tetrahedron group admits an essential represen-
tation in PSL(2, C).
Theorem 1.5 Let G be the generalized tetrahedron group deﬁned by the presenta-
tion
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R1(x, y)f1 = R2(y, z)f2 = R3(z, x)f3 = 1⟩,
and let G1 be the generalized triangle group deﬁned by the presentation
⟨x, y | xe1 = ye2 = R1(x, y)f1 = 1⟩.
Suppose that ρ is an essential representation of G1 in PSL(2, C), that X = ρ(x)
and Y = ρ(y), and that one of the following two possibilities occurs:
1. tr[X, Y ] ̸= 2;
2. (e3, f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2, 2) and ⟨X, Y ⟩is an inﬁnite metabelian subgroup of
PSL(2, C).
Then there is an essential representation ˜ρ : G →PSL(2, C) such that ˜ρ(x) = X
and ˜ρ(y) = Y .
In particular, if ⟨X, Y ⟩is inﬁnite, then G is inﬁnite.
Corollary 1.6 Every ﬁnite generalized tetrahedron group admits an essential re-
presentation in PSL(2, C) with image D2n (n ≥2), A4, S4 or A5.
Here D2n is the dihedral group of order 2n, An the alternating group of degree n,
and Sn the symmetric group of degree n.
Theorem 1.7 Let G be the generalized tetrahedron group deﬁned by the presenta-
tion
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R1(x, y)f1 = R2(y, z)f2 = R3(z, x)f3 = 1⟩,
and suppose that e1 ≤e2 and that
R1(x, y) = xα1yβ1 . . . xαk1yβk1,
where k1 > 1 and R1(x, y) is not a proper power in the free product of the cyclic
groups generated by x and y. Assume further that one of the following holds:

458
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
1. e2 ≥4 and f1 ≥3;
2. f1 ≥4;
3. e1 ≥3 and f1 ≥3.
Then G is inﬁnite.
Theorem 1.8 A generalized tetrahedron group G(e1, e2, e3, f1, f2, f3) is inﬁnite if
1
f1 + 1
f2 + 1
f3 ≤1.
Theorem 1.9 A generalized tetrahedron group G(e1, e2, e3, f1, f2, f3) is inﬁnite if
1
e1 + 1
e2 + 1
f1 < 1.
Theorem 1.10 A generalized tetrahedron group G(e1, e2, e3, 2, 2, 2) is inﬁnite if
1
e1 + 1
e2 ≤1
2.
Theorem 1.11 (Spelling Theorem)
Let H = ⟨x, y | xp = yq = W r = 1⟩be a generalized triangle group with
W = xα1yβ1 · · · xαkyβk (0 < αi < p, 0 < βi < q),
and let
V (x, y) = xγ1yδ1 · · · xγℓyδℓ, (0 < γi < p, 0 < δi < q)
be a word that is equal to 1 in H. Then ℓ≥k · (r −1) + 1.
In the following we use the methods of Gersten and Stallings (see [16]).
If we have two subgroups A, B of a group H, then the inclusions A →H and
B →H determine a homomorphism
φ :
A ∗B −→H.
The angle (H; A, B) between A and B is deﬁned as follows:
• if φ injective, let (H; A, B) = 0;
• otherwise let (H; A, B) = π/n, where 2n is the minimal length of an element
of Ker(φ).
Remark 1.12 A generalized tetrahedron group
⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R1(x, y)f1 = R2(y, z)f2 = R3(z, x)f3 = 1⟩,
can be realized as a triangle of groups, that is as the colimit of the diagram of
groups and injective homomorphisms (see ﬁgure)

Proposition 1.14 If H is the colimit of a non-spherical triangle of groups then
H is inﬁnite.
Remark 1.15 For any representation ρ : ⟨a, b | a2p, b2q⟩→SL(2, C) we have that
the trace of ρ(W) is given by a polynomial in the traces of ρ(a), ρ(b) and ρ(ab):
fW (tr(ρ(a)), tr(ρ(b)), tr(ρ(ab))) .
The degree of the polynomial f in the third variable is at most k, that is, half the
(free product) length of W = aα1bβ1 · · · aαkbβk (see Lemma 1 in [8]). If the ﬁrst
two variables of f are ﬁxed as 2 cos(π/p) and 2 cos(π/q) respectively, then an easy
argument shows that f becomes a polynomial of degree precisely k in the single
variable tr(ρ(ab)). We refer to this as the trace polynomial of W.
Theorem 1.16 (A slight generalization of Theorem 2.26 of [13])
Let G be a generalized tetrahedron group with a presentation of the form
G = ⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R2
1(x, y) = Rf2
2 (y, z) = Rf3
3 (z, x) = 1⟩,
where (e1, e2) ̸= (2, 2), and let
G1 = ⟨x, y | xe1 = ye2 = R2
1(x, y) = 1⟩.
Assume that the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has a multiple root β. Then G is
inﬁnite.
Proof If there is an essential representation ρ : G →PSL(2, C) with ρ(G) cyclic
or inﬁnite metabelian then G is inﬁnite.
Assume now that there is no such representation. If, for some 1 ≤i ≤3, there is
an essential representation ρi : Gi →PSL(2, C) with ρi(Gi) non-elementary then G
is inﬁnite (see Theorem 1.5). Assume now that, for 1 ≤i ≤3, there is no essential
representation ρi : Gi →PSL(2, C) with ρi(Gi) non-elementary.
Without loss of generality we may assume that e1 ≤e2. G is inﬁnite if
1

ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
If (e3, f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2, 2) then G is inﬁnite if there exists an essential representation
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with ρ1(G1) cyclic or inﬁnite metabelian (see Theorem 1.5).
Assume ﬁrst that
1
e1
+ 1
e2
= 1
2, (f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2)
and there is no essential representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with ρ1(G1) cyclic
or inﬁnite metabelian. If ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) is an essential representation then
certainly ρ1(G1) is not a dihedral group. Now, if
1
e1
+ 1
e2
= 1
2 and e1 ≤e2,
then (e1, e2) = (4, 4) or (3, 6). G is inﬁnite if (e1, e2) = (3, 6) by Corollary 1.6
because here, if ρ : G →PSL(2, C) is an essential representation, then ρ(G) is
not dihedral. For (e1, e2) = (4, 4) it is possible that ρ1(G1) = S4 for an essential
representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C).
Now assume that (e1, e2) = (4, 4). Without loss of generality we may assume
that f2 ≥3 since (f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2). If e3 ≥3 then G is inﬁnite because
1
e1
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f2
< 1
if e3 ≥3. Hence let e3 = 2. Now we use Theorem 1.3, Theorem 1.11, Lemma 3.1
of [13] and the assumption that, for no 1 ≤i ≤3, there is an essential repre-
sentation ρi : Gi →PSL(2, C) with ρi(Gi) non-elementary. Therefore G is, as a
triangle of groups, non-spherical and hence inﬁnite by Proposition 1.14, unless, up
to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x4 = y4 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xδz)3 = (yγz)2 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤δ, γ < 4. Recall that the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has (at least) the
multiple root β.
If δ = 2 then G2 has an essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C) and there-
fore G is inﬁnite. If γ = 2 then we introduce the relations x2 = y2 = 1 to get
an inﬁnite factor group. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that
δ = γ = 1.
Here G is inﬁnite unless the only essential representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C)
with trρ1(x) = trρ1(y) =
√
2 is given by trρ1(xy) = 1; that is, ⟨ρ1(x), ρ1(y)⟩= S4,
and, if
R1(x, y) = xα1yβ1 · · · xαk1yβk1, 1 ≤αi, βi < 4, k1 ≥2
(up to equivalence), then the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) is just τ(t) = a·(t−1)k1
with a ̸= 0.
Recall that k1 ≥2 because the trace polynomial has a multiple root.
G is
inﬁnite if k1 ≥5 by Theorem 1.11 and Proposition 1.14.
Let
¯
R1(x, y) be the
cyclically reduced word which we get from R1(x, y) if we introduce in G1 the
relations x2 = y2 = 1 and make free reductions.
If
¯
R1(x, y) is equal to 1 or
x or y then we get an inﬁnite factor group of G. If this does not occur and if

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS
461
2 ≤k1 ≤4 then, by [11] and [12], the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) is not of the
form τ(t) = a · (t −1)k1. Hence, altogether, G is inﬁnite if 1/e1 + 1/e2 ≤1/2.
Hence we may assume that 1/e1 + 1/e2 > 1/2.
Since (e1, e2) ̸= (2, 2) we have
e1 = 2, e2 ≥3 or e1 = 3, 3 ≤e2 ≤5.
Certainly G is inﬁnite unless β = α + α−1 for some 2mth root of unity α ̸= ±1.
For the following let β always be of this form. G is inﬁnite if
e1 = 3, 3 ≤e2 ≤5 and m ≥6
by Corollary 2.4 of [5] because, if ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) is an essential representation,
then ρ1(G1) cannot be dihedral: if G were ﬁnite then G would have a factor group
¯G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = ye2 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)2 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
which is inﬁnite, a contradiction.
If e1 = 3, 3 ≤e2 ≤5 and 2 ≤m ≤5 then there is no essential representation
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with trρ1(xy) = β and ρ1(G1) cyclic or inﬁnite metabelian
because f1 = 2.
Assume now that there is an essential representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with
trρ1(xy) = β and ρ1(G1) cyclic or inﬁnite metabelian, and, without loss of gener-
ality, let ρ1(G) be inﬁnite metabelian. As pointed out above we must then have
that e1 = 2. G is inﬁnite if (e3, f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2, 2) by Theorem 1.5.
Let (e3, f2, f3) = (2, 2, 2). Assume that G has a factor group
¯G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = ye2 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)2 = (yγz)2 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤γ ≤e2. Let d = gcd(γ, e2). If d ≥2 then we introduce the relation yd = 1
and get an inﬁnite factor group of ¯G. If d = 1 then we may assume that γ = 1.
We consider the subgroup H = ⟨x, y⟩of ¯G. H has presentation
H = ⟨x, y | x2 = ye2 = R2
1(x, y) = R2
1(x−1, y−1) = 1⟩
and G is inﬁnite since ρ1 factorizes via H.
Assume now that G does not have such a factor group ¯G.
Here we use the
construction from [8] and [9].
For the construction of the extension ρ : G →PSL(2, C) of
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C)
we just may replace trρ(yz) ̸= 0 by −trρ(yz), if necessary, to get an inﬁnite image
of G in PSL(2, C). So, from now on, we may assume that there is no essential
representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with trρ1(xy) = β and ρ1(G1) cyclic or inﬁnite
metabelian. Then G is inﬁnite if m ≥6 by Theorem 2.8 and Corollary 2.4 of [5].
Now let 2 ≤m ≤5. Then we may argue as in the proof of Theorem 2.26 of [13]
(see also [10]), and we write p = e1 and q = e2. Let
λ = 2 cos kπ
p ,
µ = 2 cos lπ
q ,

462
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
where k and l are integers coprime to p and q respectively. We may choose k and l
so that both the inequalities

q

̸= β + 2
and
cos

hold.
Let γ ∈C with
(−γ + λ)(γ + µ) −2 = β.
Deﬁne matrices X, Y ∈SL(2, C[t]) by
X =


.
Then
f(t) = trXY = (−t + γ + λ)(t −γ + µ) −2 and f(2γ) = β.
Hence we get a representation
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, Λ),
Λ =
C[t]
((t −γ)2)
with ρ1(G1) inﬁnite (see [10]). By Theorem 2.25 of [13] there exists an extension
ρ : G →PSL(2, Λ), and in particular G is inﬁnite.

In the following we classify the ﬁnite generalized tetrahedron groups with a cubic
relator. At a few places we show the inﬁniteness via the abelian invariants of a
subgroup which we found by using the computer algebra system GAP [15].

Proposition 2.1 Suppose that ki ≥2 for at least one value of i. If at least two of
the fi are equal to 3, then G is inﬁnite.
Proof If f1 = f2 = f3 = 3, then G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.8. So assume now that
exactly two fi are equal to 3.
Without loss of generality we may assume that k1 ≥2 and that e1 ≤e2. If
f2 = f3 = 3, then G is inﬁnite by Proposition 3.1 of [6] and Lemma 3.1 of [13]
because G1 has a non-elementary image in PSL(2, C) or the angle at G1 is at
most π/4.
Assume now that f1 = 3. By Theorem 1.5, G is inﬁnite if e1 ≥3 or e2 ≥4 since
k1 ≥2. So let e1 = 2 and e3 = 3. If k1 ≥3 then
1
2k1 + 1 +
1
k2(f2 −1) + 1 +
1
k3(f3 −1) + 1 ≤1
7 + 1
3 + 1
2 < 1
because f2 = 3 or f3 = 3, and G is inﬁnite by Proposition 3.1 of [6]. So we may
assume that k1 = 2.
Since R1(x, y) is not a proper power we have, up to equivalence, that
R1(x, y) = xyxy2.
We choose an essential representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with
trρ1(x) = 0, trρ1(y) = 1,
and trρ1(xyxy2) = −1.
If s = trρ1(xy) it follows that s2 = 0. So 0 is a double root of τ(s) = trρ1(xyxy2)+1.
We now use, for this special case, a slight extension of Theorem 1.16. We choose
γ ∈C such that
γ2 + γ + 2 = 0.
Let I be the ideal in C[t] generated by (t −γ)2 and then let Λ = C[t]/I. As in
[10] we get an essential representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with ρ1(G1) inﬁnite.
By Theorem 2.25 of [13] there exists an extension ρ : G →PSL(2, Λ), and, in
particular, G is inﬁnite.
2
Proposition 2.2 Let ki ≥2 for at least two values of i and precisely one fi be
equal to 3. Then G is inﬁnite.
Proof Assume, without loss of generality, that k1 ≥2 and k2 ≥2.
If f3 = 3, then G is inﬁnite by Proposition 3.1 of [6] and Lemma 3.1 of [13]
because f1 = f2 = 2, and the angle at G1 is at most π/4; therefore we either have
1/4 + 1/3 + 1/3 < 1 or else that G1 has a non-elementary image in PSL(2, C).
Assume now that f1 = 3 or f2 = 3; without loss of generality, let f1 = 3. Then
f2 = f3 = 2. If G2 has a non-elementary image in PSL(2, C) then G is inﬁnite.
Otherwise the angle at G2 is at most π/4, and G is inﬁnite because
1
k1(f1 −1) + 1 + 1
4 + 1
2 ≤1
5 + 1
4 + 1
2 < 1.
This completes the proof.

Proposition 2.3 Let k1 ≥2 and f1 = 3, and suppose that G is ﬁnite. Then G is
one of the following (up to equivalence):
(1)
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z2 = (xyxyxy2)3 = (xz)2 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 2880,
(2)
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z3 = (xyxyxy2)3 = (xz)2 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 864000.
Proof Assume, without loss of generality, that e1 ≤e2.
If e1 ≥3 or e2 ≥4, then G is inﬁnite by Theorem 2.5 of [5]. So assume now that
e1 = 2 and e2 = 3. G is inﬁnite if k2 ≥2 or k3 ≥2 (see Propositions 2.1 and 2.2).
So let k2 = k3 = 1.
Since there exists no essential representation ρ : G →PSL(2, C) with cyclic
image ρ(G), we know, from [9] Theorem 7.3.2.4, that we only have to consider, up
to equivalence, the following possibilities for R1(x, y):
1. R1(x, y) = xyxy2 and
2. R1(x, y) = xyxyxy2.
If R1(x, y) = xyxy2 then, for any essential representation
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C), x →X, y →Y with trX = 0, trY = 1, trXY = 0,
the polynomial f(t) = tr(XY XY 2) + 1 = t2, where t = trXY , has 0 as a double
root, i.e. G is inﬁnite by straightforward arguments as in the proof of Proposi-
tion 2.1.
So let k2 = k3 = 1 and R1(x, y) = xyxyxy2. Introducing the relation (xy)5 = 1,
we have the factor group
¯G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = ze3 = (xy)5 = (xzδ)2 = (yzη)2 = 1⟩
of G. ¯G is inﬁnite for e3 = 4 and e3 ≥6, since there exists an essential representa-
tion ρ : ¯G →PSL(2, C) with ρ( ¯G) inﬁnite: ρ( ¯G) cannot be dihedral and, if ⟨x, y⟩
admits an essential representation ρ1 with ρ1(⟨x, y⟩) inﬁnite metabelian, we can
use Theorem 1.5. Moreover, a ﬁnite subgroup H of PSL(2, C) with H non-cyclic
or dihedral cannot contain, at the same time, an element of order 4 and an element
of order 5.
Now let e3 = 5. Then we can assume that η = 1 and δ = 1 in ¯G since ⟨x, z⟩
is dihedral.
Hence ¯G is an inﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group by the Coxeter
criterion and therefore G is inﬁnite. For 2 ≤e3 ≤3 we have, up to equivalence,
the given ﬁnite groups.
2
So we may assume, throughout the following, that k1 ≥2, f1 = 2 and that
(f2, f3) = (2, 3) or (f2, f3) = (3, 2). Further let k2 = k3 = 1. So
G = ⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = R2
1(x, y) = (xαzγ)f2 = (yβzδ)f3 = 1⟩,
with
e1, e2, e3 ≥2
R1(x, y) = xα1yβ1 · · · xαk1yβk1, k1 ≥2, 1 ≤αi, α < e1, 1 ≤βi, β < e2,

1 ≤γ, δ < e3 and (f2, f3) = (2, 3) or (f2, f3) = (3, 2).
Assume, without loss of generality, that e1 ≤e2. If k1 ≥5, then G is inﬁnite by
Theorem 1.11 and Proposition 1.14 since
1
k1 + 1 + 1
3 + 1
2 ≤1
for k1 ≥5. So let 2 ≤k1 ≤4. Since k1 ≥2 it follows that e2 ≥3.
Proposition 2.4 Let e1 = 2, e2 = 3, f1 = 2, k1 ≥2 and (f2, f3) = (2, 3) or (3, 2).
If G is ﬁnite, then G is equivalent to
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩of order 360.
Proof Assume that G is ﬁnite. For R1(x, y) we have to consider, up to equivalence,
the following four possibilities (see [1] and [11]):
1. R1(x, y) = xyxy2,
2. R1(x, y) = xyxyxy2,
3. R1(x, y) = xyxyxyxy2,
4. R1(x, y) = xyxyxy2xy2.
In cases 3 and 4 the angle at G1 is at most π/5 by Theorem 1.11 and Proposi-
tion 1.14. Actually it is at most π/6, since a relation of the form
xys1xys2 . . . xys5 = 1, 1 ≤si ≤2
cannot hold in G1 (if we set y = 1, then G1 has the factor group ⟨x | x2 = 1⟩).
Hence G is inﬁnite in cases 3 and 4.
So, assume now that case 1 or 2 holds. In case 2, the angle at G1 is again even
at most π/6.
In either case, we have, that the angle is G1 is at most π/4. As above there is
no relation of the form
xys1xys2 . . . xys5 = 1, 1 ≤si ≤2
in G1. Assume now that, in G1, a relation of the form
xys1xys2xys3xys4 = 1, 1 ≤si ≤2
holds. Without loss of generality we can assume that we have one of
a)
(xy)4 = 1,
b)
xyxyxyxy2 = 1,
c)
(xyxy2)2 = 1,
d)
xy2xy2xyxy = 1.
We remark that G1 is of order 48 (see [1]). Moreover, if ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) is an
essential representation with
x →X, y →Y, trX = 0, trY = 1,

466
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
then trXY = 0 or trXY = ±
√
2. If trXY = 0, then ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to S3,
and, if trXY = ±
√
2, then ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to S4.
Case a) is not possible, since 24 = |S4| < 48 = |G1|.
For case b) we consider X, Y with trXY =
√
2; then Y = 1, which does not
hold.
In case c) we consider X, Y with trXY = 0; then Y 2 = Y 3 = 1, so that Y = 1,
which does not hold.
Case d) is not possible, since a group ⟨x, y⟩with the relations
x2 = y3 = xy2xy2xyxy = 1
has order at most 18 (see [17]).
Hence, in total, the angle at G1 for case 2 is at most π/6 and G is inﬁnite.
There remains case 1) with R1(x, y) = xyxy2. We have, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = ze3 = (xyxy2)2 = (xzγ)f2 = (yzδ)f3 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤γ, δ < e3 and (f2, f3) = (3, 2) or (f2, f3) = (2, 3).
I) Let f2 = 3 and e3 ≥3. Then we consider the factor group
¯G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = ze3 = (xy)3 = (xzγ)3 = (yzδ)2 = 1⟩.
If e3 = 3, then ¯G is an inﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group by the Coxeter
criterion. If e3 = 4 and γ = 2 or δ = 2, then ¯G is inﬁnite, since G2 and G3
respectively have essential non-elementary images in PSL(2, C). If e3 = 4 and
γ ̸= 2 ̸= δ, then ¯G is an inﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group by the Coxeter
criterion.
Assume now that e3 = 5. We can assume that δ = 1 and that a ≤γ ≤2. For
γ = 1, ¯G is an inﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group by the Coxeter criterion;
for γ = 2, we showed that ¯G is inﬁnite by GAP.
Assume now that e3 = 6. If γ = 2, 3 or 4, then G1 has an essential non-
elementary image in PSL(2, C). So let (without loss of generality) γ = 1. If
δ = 2, 3 or 4, then G2 has an essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C). If
δ = 1 or 5, then G1 is an inﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group by the Coxeter
criterion. If e3 ≥7, then ¯G is inﬁnite, since
1
2 + 1
3 + 1
7 < 1.
II) Let f2 = 3 and e3 = 2. Then, without loss of generality,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩,
and G is ﬁnite of order 360.
III) Let f3 = 3. Hence e3 = 2, since, for e3 ≥4, we have
1
3 + 1
3 + 1
4 < 1,

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS
467
and, for e3 = 3, we have the factor group
¯G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z3 = (xy)3 = (xz)2 = (yz)3 = 1⟩
which is an inﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group by the Coxeter criterion. So,
without loss of generality,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)2 = (yz)3 = 1⟩.
Here G is inﬁnite by GAP.
This concludes the proof.

Proposition 2.5 Let e1 = e2 = 3, k1 ≥2, f1 = 2 and (f2, f3) = (2, 3) or (3, 2). If
G is ﬁnite, then G is equivalent to
⟨x, y, z | x3 = y3 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 7200.
Proof G is inﬁnite for e3 ≥3 by Theorem 2.2 of [5], since f2 = 3 or f3 = 3 and
e1 = e2 = 3. So let e3 = 2. Then, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = y3 = z2 = R1(x, y)2 = (xz)f3 = (yz)f2 = 1⟩.
If G is ﬁnite, we have, by [12] and [11], the following possibilities for R1(x, y)
(up to equivalence):
1. R1(x, y) = xyxy2,
2. R1(x, y) = xyx2y2,
3. R1(x, y) = xyxyx2y2,
4. R1(x, y) = x2y2xyxyx2y,
5. R1(x, y) = xy2x2y2xyx2y.
If R1(x, y) = xyxy2, then G is ﬁnite of order 7200 for f2 = 3 and inﬁnite for
f3 = 3 by GAP.
If R1(x, y) = xyx2y2, then G is inﬁnite by GAP (note that, by symmetry, we do
not have to distinguish between f2 = 3 and f2 = 2).
If R1(x, y) = x2y2xyxyx2y, the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has λ = 2 cos π/5
as a double root and therefore G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.16.
Suppose that R1(x, y) = xy2x2y2xyx2y. The trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has
roots 0, 1, λ = 2 cos π/5, and 1 −λ. Additionally we have a non-essential, non-
trivial representation ρ : G1 →PSL(2, C) with
x →X =

ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
If we consider this representation, we can improve the estimate of the Spelling
Theorem to ℓ≥6, i.e. the angle at G1 is at most π/6. Since
1
6 + 1
3 + 1
2 = 1,
we have that G is inﬁnite in this case.
We now consider case 3 where
G1 = ⟨x, y | x3 = y3 = (xyxyx2y2)2 = 1⟩
and we use the Gersten-Stallings method of angles. If ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) is an
essential representation with (as usual) x →X, y →Y, trX = 1, trY = 1, then the
trace polynomial has roots
trXY = 0,
trXY = λ = 2 cos π
5 ,
and trXY = 1 −λ.
For trXY = 0 we have that ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to A4 and, for trXY = λ or 1−λ,
we have that ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to A5. G1 admits a non-essential, non-trivial
representation

If we consider this representation, we can improve the estimate of Theorem 1.11 to
ℓ≥5, i.e. the angle at G1 is at most π/5. This is insuﬃcient for our purpose, and
so we consider equations of the form
(⋆)
xr1ys1xr2ys2xr3ys3xr4ys4xr5ys5 = 1,
1 ≤ri, si ≤2.
In equation (⋆) x has to appear as often as y and x2 as often as y2, since G1 admits
the above representation to Z3. Using symmetry, as well as cyclic conjugations
and inversion of words of the form in (⋆), we can restrict ourselves to the following
equations:
a)
(xy)5 = 1,
b)
(xy)4x2y2 = 1,
c)
(xy)3x2yxy2 = 1,
d)
(xy)2x2(yx)2y2 = 1,
e)
(xy)3(x2y2)2 = 1,

(xy)2x2yxy2x2y2 = 1,

xy2x2yxyx2yxy2 = 1,

xy2xyx2yx2yxy2 = 1,

xyxy2xyx2yx2y2 = 1,

(xy)2xy2x2yx2y2 = 1,

xyxy2x2yxyx2y2 = 1.

In cases a), b), d), e), f), g), h), i), k), m), o) and p) we consider X, Y with
trXY = 0 and get XY = 1 in A4, a contradiction.
In case c) (xy)3x2yxy2 = 1, we consider X and Y with trXY = λ and, after
inserting (XY )5 = 1, we get XY XY X2Y 2 = 1, which is impossible in A5, since
we have an essential representation.
In case j) xy2x2(yx)2yx2y2 = 1, we replace xyxyx2y2 by yxy2x2y2x2 and get an
equation x2y2xy2x2y = 1 in G1, which is a contradiction because the angle at G1
is at most π/5. Analogously we get the same contradiction in case q).
In case l) xy2(xy)2x2yx2y2 = 1, we replace y2xyxyx2 by xy2x2y2x2y to get
(xy)4 = 1 in G1, which does not hold. Analogously we consider case n).
In case r) xyxy2x2yxyx2y2 = 1, we again replace xyxyx2y2 by yxy2x2y2x2 and
get (xy)2 = 1 in G1, which does not hold.
So, indeed, the angle at G1 is at
most π/6. Hence G is inﬁnite, since 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1.
2
Proposition 2.6 If k1 ≥2 and e2 = 4, then G is inﬁnite.
Proof
I) Assume ﬁrst that e1 ≥3. Let f2 = 3. If e3 ≥3, then
1
e1
+ 1
e3
+ 1
3 ≤1,
and so G is inﬁnite, since k2 = 1, e2 = 4 and
⟨x, z | x3 = z3 = (xz)3 = 1⟩
has an essential cyclic, and therefore essential inﬁnite metabelian, image in
PSL(2, C).
So let e3 = 2. If the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has a multiple root, then G
is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.16. Hence G is inﬁnite if e1 ≥4 (G is inﬁnite, if G
admits an essential inﬁnite metabelian image in PSL(2, C) because f2 = 3).
So let e1 = 3. We have then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = y4 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)3 = (yβz)2 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2.
If G1 admits an essential cyclic or essential inﬁnite
metabelian image in PSL(2, C), then G is inﬁnite since f2 = 3. Introduc-
ing the relation y2 = 1, we see that G has image
¯G = ⟨¯x, ¯y, ¯z | ¯x3 = ¯y2 = ¯z2 = ¯R2
1(¯x, ¯y) = (¯x¯z)3 = (¯yβ¯z)2 = 1⟩,
where ¯R1(¯x, ¯y) is the cyclically reduced word, that we derive from R1(x, y)
after using the relation y2 = 1 and free reduction.
If ¯R1(¯x, ¯y) = 1 or ¯y, then ¯G, and hence G, is inﬁnite. If the trace polynomial
of R1(x, y) admits a multiple root then G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.16. If
G1 admits an essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C), then G is inﬁnite
by Theorem 2.2 of [5]. By [12] and [11] we only have, up to equivalence, to
consider the case R1(x, y) = xyxy−1. So we have
G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = y4 = z2 = (xyxy−1)2 = (xz)3 = (yβz)2 = 1⟩

470
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
with 1 ≤β ≤2. If β = 2, we introduce the relation y2 = 1 and get an inﬁnite
factor group of G. If β = 1, then G is inﬁnite by GAP.
Assume now that f2 = 2 and f3 = 3. If e3 ≥3, then
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
3 < 1,
and so G is inﬁnite. Assume now that e3 = 2.
If e1 ≥4 and f3 = 3, then G is inﬁnite by [12] and [11], Theorem 1.5 and
Theorem 1.16 (last, if the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has a multiple root).
Hence let e1 = 3. Then, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = y4 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)2 = (yβz)3 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2. If β = 2 then
G3 = ⟨y, z | y4 = z2 = (y2z)3 = 1⟩
admits an essential non-elementary image ⟨Z, Y ⟩in PSL(2, C) with
trZ = 0, trY =
√
2, and trY Z = −1
√
2.
Hence G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.5.
Assume now that β = 1. If G1 admits an essential cyclic or essential inﬁnite
metabelian image in PSL(2, C), then G is inﬁnite since f3 = 3. If we introduce
the relation y2 = 1 then G has image
¯G = ⟨¯x, ¯y, ¯z | ¯x3 = ¯y2 = ¯z2 = ¯R2
1(¯x, ¯y) = (¯x¯z)2 = (¯y¯z)3 = 1⟩,
where ¯R1(¯x, ¯y) is the cyclically reduced word that we derive from R1(x, y)
after using the relation y2 = 1 and free reduction.
If ¯R1(¯x, ¯y) = 1 or ¯y then ¯G, and hence G, is inﬁnite. If the trace polynomial
of R1(x, y) admits a multiple root, then G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.16. If G1
admits an essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C), then G is inﬁnite by
Theorem 1.5. By [12] and [11] we only have, up to equivalence, to consider
the case R1(x, y) = xyxy−1. Here G is inﬁnite by GAP.
So, altogether, G is inﬁnite for e1 ≥3.
II) Assume now that e1 = 2 and that f3 = 3. Analogously to I), G is inﬁnite for
e3 ≥3. So let e3 = 2, that is
G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = y4 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)2 = (yβz)3 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2. If β = 2, then G is inﬁnite as in I). So let β = 1. Introducing
the relation y2 = 1, we derive, as in I), the factor group
¯G = ⟨¯x, ¯y, ¯z | ¯x2 = ¯y2 = ¯z2 = ¯R2
1(¯x, ¯y) = (¯x¯z)2 = (¯y¯z)3 = 1⟩.
If ¯R1(¯x, ¯y) = ¯x, ¯y or 1 then ¯G, and hence G, is inﬁnite. If G has the factor
group
¯¯G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y4 = z2 = (xy)4 = (xz)2 = (yz)3 = 1⟩,

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS
471
then ¯¯G, and therefore G, is inﬁnite by the Coxeter criterion. If the trace
polynomial of R1(x, y) admits a multiple root, then G is inﬁnite by Theo-
rem 1.16. By [12] and [11] we only have to consider, up to equivalence, the
case R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3.
So let R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3. The subgroup H of index 2 in G, generated by
a = y, b = xyx, c = z and d = xzx, has presentation
⟨a, b, c | a4 = b4 = c2 = (ac)3 = (bc)3 = bab3aba3 = 1⟩
(note that cd = 1). Introducing the relations b2 = a2 = 1 to H, we get the
inﬁnite factor group
¯H = ⟨a, b, c | a2 = b2 = c2 = (ac)3 = (bc)3 = (ab)3 = 1⟩.
Hence G is inﬁnite.
III) Assume now that e1 = 2 and f2 = 3; then f3 = 2. Assume ﬁrst that e3 = 2.
Then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x3 = y4 = z2 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)2 = (yβz)2 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2. If β = 2, we introduce the relation y2 = 1 and get an inﬁnite
factor group. So let β = 1. With the same argument as in II) we have to
consider, up to equivalence, only the case R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3.
So let R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3. We consider the subgroup H of index 2 of G,
generated by a = x, b = yxy−1, c = y2, d = z and e = yzy−1. Then H has
presentation
⟨a, b, c, d, e | a2 = b2 = c2 = d2 = e2 = abcacbcab = (ad)3 = (be)3 = ecd = 1⟩.
If we introduce the relation c = 1 then we get the inﬁnite factor group
¯H = ⟨a, b, d | a2 = b2 = d2 = (ab)3 = (ad)3 = (bd)3 = 1⟩.
Hence G is inﬁnite.
So assume now that e3 ≥3. We then have
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y4 = ze3 = R2
1(x, y) = (xzγ)3 = (yβzδ)2 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2 and 1 ≤γ, β < e3.
If e3 ≥5, then G is inﬁnite because
1
4 + 1
e3
+ 1
2 < 1.
Hence let e3 = 4. If γ = 2, we consider
G2 = ⟨x, z | x2 = z4 = (xz2)3 = 1⟩.
G2 has an essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C); hence G is inﬁnite
for γ = 2. If γ = 1 or 3, we can assume (via inversion of xzγ), that γ = 1.

So let γ = 1. If β = 2 or δ = 2, we introduce the relations y2 = z2 = 1 to
get an inﬁnite factor group. Hence let β ̸= 2 ̸= δ. We can now assume that
β = 1 = δ. G3 has an essential inﬁnite metabelian image in PSL(2, C); hence
G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.5 because f2 = 3 > 2.
Assume now that e3 = 3. Up to equivalence, we have
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y4 = z3 = R2
1(x, y) = (xz)3 = (yβz)2 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2. If β = 2, then
G3 = ⟨y, z | y4 = z3 = (y2z)2 = 1⟩
has an essential non-elementary image ⟨Y, Z⟩in PSL(2, C) with
trY =
√
2,
trZ = 1 and trY Z =
1
√
2;
therefore G is inﬁnite for β = 2.
Hence let β = 1. Analogously, as in II), we have to consider, up to equivalence,
only the case R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3. We have then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y4 = z3 = (xyxyxy3)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩.
We consider the subgroup H of index 2, generated by
a = x, b = yxy−1, c = y2, d = z and e = yzy−1.
Then H has presentation
⟨a, b, c, d, e | a2 = b2 = c2 = d3 = e3 = abcacbcab = (ad)3 = (be)3 = ecd = 1⟩.
If we introduce the relation c = 1 then we get the inﬁnite factor group
¯H = ⟨a, b, d | a2 = b2 = d3 = (ab)3 = (ad)3 = (bd)3 = 1⟩.
Hence G is inﬁnite.
This completes the proof.

Proposition 2.7 If e2 = 5, k1 ≥2 and exactly one fi is equal to 3 then G is ﬁnite
if and only if, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 43200.

I) Assume that e1 = 2 and k1 ≥3. We have, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = ze3 = R1(x, y)2 = (xzγ)f2 = (yβzδ)f3 = 1⟩,
with 1 ≤β < 5, 1 ≤γ, δ < e3 and (f2, f3) = (2, 3) or (3, 2). G is inﬁnite for
e3 ≥4 because, then,
1
5 + 1
e3
+ 1
2 < 1.
So we can assume that γ = δ = 1 and 1 ≤β ≤2. If k1 ≥5 then G is inﬁnite
because
1
k1 + 1 + 1
f2
+ 1
f3
≤1.
If k1 = 4 then G admits an essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C) and
therefore G is inﬁnite (see [11]). Therefore let k1 = 3.
Then we have to consider (see [11]), up to equivalence:
1. R1(x, y) = xyxy2xy4,
2. R1(x, y) = xyxyxy4 and
3. R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3 (otherwise G is inﬁnite).
In case 3, R1(x, y) = xyxyxy3, the vertex group G1 admits an essential, cyclic
or inﬁnite metabelian, image in PSL(2, C) and hence G is inﬁnite, because
(f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2).
We can handle cases 1 and 2 at the same time.
In both cases the trace
polynomial for R1(x, y) has roots 0, λ −1 and 1 −λ, where λ = 2 cos π/5.
We consider now essential representations
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C),
x →X,
y →Y,
with
trX = 0, trY = λ = 2 cos π
5
and trXY = 0, λ −1 or 1 −λ.
If trXY = 0 then ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to D5, the dihedral group, and, if
trXY = ±(λ −1), then ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to A5.
If trXY = 0 then
trXY β = 0 for 1 ≤β ≤4. If trXY = λ −1 then trXY 2 = 1, trXY 3 = 1
and trXY 4 = λ −1. Anyway, the angle at G1 is at most π/4. We now use
the trace relations to show that the angle at G1 is, in fact, equal to π/6. We
cannot have an equation of the form
(2)
xyq1xyq2xyq3xyq4xyq5 = 1, 1 ≤qi ≤4,
in G1 because, if we introduce the relation y = 1 in G1, we get the factor
group ⟨x | x2 = 1⟩= Z2 which contradicts equation 1.
Now we have to consider equations of the form
(1)
xys1xys2xys3xys4 = 1, 1 ≤si ≤4,

474
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
in G1. If we choose X, Y with trXY = 0 we see that we must have
s1 + s3 ≡s2 + s4
mod 5.
Assume ﬁrst that si = 2 or 3 for some i with 1 ≤i ≤4. Without loss of
generality let s1 = 2. We choose X, Y with trXY = λ −1. Then trXY 2 = 1,
that is, (XY 2)3 = 1, and we get, in A5, the equation
XY s2−2XY s3XY s4−2 = 1.
This automatically gives that s2 ̸= 2 and s4 ̸= 2 if s1 = 2. If s2 = 4 then we
may argue as before to get XY s3−2XY s4−4 = 1, that is,
XY s3−2X = Y 4−s4
in A5. This holds only if s3 = 2 and s4 = 4, but then
s1 + s3 = 4 ̸≡s2 + s4 ≡3
mod 5,
a contradiction. Hence s2 ̸= 4 if s1 = 2.
Analogously we get s4 ̸= 4 if s1 = 2. Assume that s3 = 2 or 3 if s1 = 2, and,
without loss of generality, let s3 = 2. Then we get, in A5, the equation
XY s2−4XY s4−4 = 1,
which gives a contradiction. Hence s3 ̸= 2 and s3 ̸= 3 if s1 = 2, that is,
s3 = 1 or s3 = 4 if s1 = 2.
If s3 = 1 then s1 + s3 = 3 but s2 + s4 ≡1, 2 or 4 (mod 5) which gives
a contradiction.
If s3 = 4 then s1 + s3 ≡0 (mod 5) which also gives a
contradiction. Therefore we have si ̸= 2 and si ̸= 3 for all 1 ≤i ≤4 in
equation (1).
Assume now that s1 = s2 or s2 = s3 or s3 = s4 or s4 = s1. Without loss of
generality let s1 = s2 = 1. Then s3 = s4 = 1 or s3 = s4 = 4 because
s1 + s3 ≡s2 + s4
mod 5.
We cannot have s3 = s4 = 1 because then (xy)4 = 1 which gives a contradic-
tion if we choose X, Y with trXY = λ −1, that is (XY )5 = 1.
Let s3 = s4 = 4. Then we have, in G1, the equation
(xy)2(x−1y−1)2 = 1.
We choose X, Y with trXY = λ −1. But then (XY )2(X−1Y −1)2 has order
5 in A5 which gives a contradiction. Hence, we ﬁnally also have s1 ̸= s2,
s2 ̸= s3, s3 ̸= s4 and s4 ̸= s1. We know that si = 1 or 4 for all 1 ≤i ≤4.
Therefore, without loss of generality, let s1 = 1. Then we get s2 = 4, s3 = 1
and s4 = 4. But then
2 ≡s1 + s3 ̸≡s2 + s4 ≡3
mod 5.

Altogether we have that the angle at G1 is π/6. Therefore G is inﬁnite by
Proposition 3.1 of [6] because
1
6 + 1
3 + 1
3 = 1.
II) Here we assume that e1 = 2 and k1 = 2. We have, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = ze3 = R1(x, y)2 = (xzγ)f2 = (yβzδ)f3 = 1⟩,
with 1 ≤γ, δ < e3, 1 ≤β ≤4, and (f2, f3) = (2, 3) or (3, 2). Up to equivalence
we have to consider (see [11]) only R1(x, y) = xyxy2 because otherwise G is
inﬁnite.
A) Let f2 = 3. G is inﬁnite for e3 ≥4, since, in that case,
1
5 + 1
e3
+ 1
2 < 1.
So let 2 ≤e3 ≤3. We may assume that γ = δ = 1 and 1 ≤β ≤2. If
β = 1 and e3 = 3 then we introduce the relation (xy)3 = 1 and get an
inﬁnite factor group by the Coxeter criterion, and hence G is inﬁnite.
If β = 2 and e3 = 3 then G is inﬁnite by GAP. If e2 = 2 then we may
assume that β = 1 because ⟨b, c⟩is dihedral. Then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
is ﬁnite of order 43200.
B) Let f3 = 3. Now G is inﬁnite for e3 ≥3 because, in that case,
1
5 + 1
e3
+ 1
3 < 1.
So let e3 = 2. We can, up to equivalence, assume that γ = β = δ = 1.
Then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)2 = (yz)3 = 1⟩.
We can show that G is inﬁnite by GAP.
III) Assume that e1 ≥3. G is inﬁnite if e1 ≥4 because
1
5 + 1
4 + 1
2 < 1.
Hence, let e1 = 3. Analogously, as in the case e2 = 4, G is inﬁnite if e3 ≥3.
Hence let e3 = 2.
If G admits an essential representation ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C) with ρ1(G1) non-
elementary cyclic or inﬁnite metabelian, then G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.5
since f2 = 3 or f3 = 3.
So we have, up to equivalence, to consider the
following possibilities for R1(x, y) (see [12], [11]):
1. R1(x, y) = xyx2y2

476
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
2. R1(x, y) = x2yxy−1xy−1
3. R1(x, y) = x2yxy3xy−1
4. R1(x, y) = x−1yx−1y2xyxy−1
5. R1(x, y) = x−1yxyx−1y2xy−1
6. R1(x, y) = x−1y2xyx−1yxy−1
7. R1(x, y) = x−1yx−1y3xyxy−1.
In case 1 R1(x, y) = xyx2y2, we have that G is inﬁnite by GAP.
In case 7, the trace polynomial has 1 as a double root, and so G is inﬁnite
by Theorem 1.16. In addition, G has an essential non-elementary image in
PSL(2, C), and so G is inﬁnite anyway.
In cases 4, 5 and 6, the trace polynomial has roots 0, 1, λ and λ −1, where
λ = 2 cos π
5 .
G1 admits, in addition, a non-essential, non-trivial representation
ϕ : G1 →PSL(2, C),
given by
x →X =

e
πi
3
0
t
e−πi
3

,
y →Y =
 1
0
0
1
	
,
t ∈C.
If we consider this representation, we can improve the estimate of Theo-
rem 1.11 to ℓ≥6, i.e. the angle at G1 is at most π/6. Since
1
6 + 1
3 + 1
2 = 1,
G is inﬁnite in cases 4, 5 and 6 by Proposition 3.1 of [6].
In case 3, R1(x, y) = x2yxy3xy−1, the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has 1 as
a double root; hence G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.16.
We now consider case 2, R1(x, y) = x2yxy−1xy−1. We can transform
x2yxy−1xy−1
equivalently to xyxyx−1y−1. We now use the notation R1(x, y) to represent
xyxyx−1y−1 as well. The trace polynomial for xyxyx−1y−1 has roots 0, 1
and λ −1. We consider now essential representations
ρ1 : G1 →PSL(2, C),
x →X,
y →Y
with
trX = 1, trY = λ = 2 cos π
5
and trXY = 0, 1 or λ −1.
In any case ⟨X, Y ⟩is isomorphic to A5.

(i) trXY = 0. Then
trXY 2 = −1,
trXY 3 = −λ,
trXY 4 = −λ,
trX2Y = −λ,
trX2y2 = −λ,
trX2Y 3 = −1
and
trX2Y 4 = 0.
(ii) trXY = 1. Then
trXY 2 = λ −1,
trXY 3 = 0,
trXY 4 = 1 −λ,
trX2Y = 1 −λ,
trX2y2 = 0,
trX2Y 3 = λ −1
and
trX2Y 4 = 1.
(iii) trXY = λ −1. Then
trXY 2 = 0,
trXY 3 = 1 −λ,
trXY 4 = −1,
trX2Y = −1,
trX2y2 = 1 −λ,
trX2Y 3 = 0
and
trX2Y 4 = λ −1.
Anyway, the angle at G1 is at most π/4. We now use the trace relations to
show that the angle at G1 is, in fact, equal to π/6. Therefore we have to
consider equations of the form
(1)
W(x, y) := xr1ys1 . . . xr4ys4 = 1,
1 ≤ri ≤2, 1 ≤si ≤4, and
(2)
V (x, y) := xp1yq1 . . . xp5yq5 = 1,
1 ≤pj ≤2, 1 ≤qj ≤4,
and we have to show that such equations cannot hold in G1.
If we can derive an equation of the form (1) or (2) from another one of
the same form by inversion of W(x, y) or V (x, y), respectively, or by cyclic
conjugation of W ±1(x, y) or V ±1(x, y), respectively, then we have to consider
only one of the two equations. Nevertheless, the number of equations to be
considered is very large. We call a term xriysi or xpjyqj, respectively, a block
of such an equation.
If, in W(x, y) or V (x, y), a cyclic conjugate S of
R±1
1 (x, y) = (xyxyx−1y−1)±1
appears as a subword, we replace S by S−1 and get, after conjugation, an
equation of the form
xn1ym1 . . . xnkymk = 1,
1 ≤nl ≤2, 1 ≤ml ≤4,
with k ≤3 or k ≤4, respectively, i.e. an equation with fewer blocks. So
we have to examine equations of the form (1) or (2), in which each cyclic
conjugate of W ±1(x, y) or V ±1(x, y) contains no cyclic conjugate of R±1
1 (x, y)
as a subword and we have to show that such an equation cannot hold in G1.
Therefore we consider only such equations of the form (1) and (2).
If, in such an equation once ri = ri+1 or pj = pj+1, respectively, or si = si+1
or qj = qj+1, respectively, appears in a cyclic conjugate of W(x, y) or V (x, y),
then we get, by a suitable choice of X, Y ∈PSL(2, C), an equation, which
does not hold in A5 and, hence, the original equation cannot hold in G1.
Here we consider, because of the large number of possible equations, in the
following only three particular equations.
(α) xy2xy3x2y2x2y4 = 1.
Choose X, Y with trXY = 0, i.e. (XY )2 = 1 in A5.

478
ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
Then (XY 2)3 = (Y 2X2)5 = 1 in A5. Hence we get
XY 2XY 3X2Y 2X2Y 4 = Y −2X−1Y X2Y 2X2Y 4 = 1,
i.e. X2Y X2Y 2X2Y 2 = 1 and, further,
Y −1Y 2X2Y 2X2Y 2 = 1
in A5. Hence Y −1XY −2XY −2 = 1, i.e.
XY 2XY 3 = Y −2X−1Y = 1,
i.e. XY = 1 in A5, a contradiction.
(β) x2y4xy4x2yx2yxy3 = 1.
Choose X, Y with trXY = λ −1, i.e. (XY )5 = 1.
Then (XY 4)3 = (Y X2)2 = 1. Hence
X2Y 4XY 4X2Y X2Y XY 3 = XY −4X−1X2Y X2Y XY 3
= XY XY X2Y XY 3 = 1,
and hence XY XX−1Y 3 = XY 4 = 1 in A5, a contradiction.
(γ) xyxy2x2y3xy4x2y3 = 1.
Choose X, Y with trXY = 1; then (XY )3 = (XY 3)2 = 1. Hence
XY XY 3X2Y 3XY 4X2Y 3 = Y −1X−1Y 2X2Y 3XY 4X2Y 3 = 1.
Hence
X2Y 2X2Y 3XY 4X2Y 2 = 1,
so that Y XY 4X2Y 2 = 1, i.e.
XY 4X2Y 3 = 1.
Hence XY 4X−1 = Y 2 in A5, a contradiction.
The other equations with ri = ri+1, pj = pj+1, si = si+1 or qj = qj+1,
respectively, are handled analogously. The consideration of these cases is left
to the reader
Assume, now, that ri = ri+1, pj = pj+1, si = si+1 or qj = qj+1 never
appears. This shows that an equation of the form (2) cannot hold in G1:
since x3 = 1 we have necessarily that pj = pj+1 at least once (maybe after a
cyclic conjugation of V (x, y)).
We consider now an equation of the form (1) with ri ̸= ri+1 and si ̸= si+1
(modulo cyclic conjugation). Then, without loss of generality, we have that
xys1x2ys2xys3x2ys4 = 1
in G1 with 1 ≤si ≤4, s1 ̸= s2 ̸= s3 ̸= s4 ̸= s1.

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS
479
Case 1) s1 = s3 or s2 = s4. Without loss of generality we may assume that
s1 = s3.
Assume ﬁrst that s1 = s3 = 1, so
xyx2ys2xyx2ys4 = 1
in G1. We choose X, Y with trXY = 0. Then
XY X2Y s2XY X2Y s4 = Y −1XY s2Y −1XY s4 = 1,
and hence XY s2−1XY s4−1 = 1. Then, necessarily, s2 = s4 = 2.
Hence, in G1, we have that (xyx2y2)2 = 1. We choose now X, Y with
trXY = 1. Then trXY X2Y 2 = −1, i.e. XY X2Y 2 is of order 3 in A5, a
contradiction.
The cases s1 = s3 = 2, s1 = s2 = 3 and s1 = s3 = 4 are considered
analogously by examination of xy2, xy3 and y4x2, respectively.
Case 2) s1 ̸= s3 and s2 ̸= s4. Without loss of generality we may assume that
s1 = 1 or s2 = 1.
Assume ﬁrst that s1 = 1. Then we have
xyx2ys2xys3x2ys4 = 1
in G1. We choose X, Y with trXY = 0. So
XY s2XY s3X2Y s4−1 = 1.
If s3 = 4 then XY s2X2Y s4−s3−1 = 1, i.e. XY s2X2 = Y s3+1−s4 in A5, a
contradiction.
Hence s3 ̸= 4. Then s3 = 2 or s3 = 3. If s2 = 2 then s3 = 3 and
XY 2X = Y −2X−1Y −2,
and hence X−1Y X2Y 2 = 1 in A5, a contradiction.
Hence s2 ̸= 2. Then s2 = 3 or s2 = 4. If s4 = 4 then s2 = 3 and s3 = 2,
so that
XY 3XY 2X2Y 3 = 1
in A5. Since (XY 3)5 = 1 it follows that (XY 3)2 = Y −1X in A5. We
have trY −1X = λ, but (tr(XY 3)2 = λ −1 in A5, a contradiction.
Hence s4 ̸= 4. Then, necessarily, s2 = 4. If s3 = 3, then s4 = 2 and
Y XY 4 = XY 2X2 in A5, a contradiction.
Hence s3 ̸= 3. Then s3 = 2 and s4 = 3. We have the equation
XY 4XY 2X2Y 2 = 1,
i.e. XY 2X2 = Y X−1Y 3 in A5.
We have trXY 2X2 = 1 −λ, but
trY X−1Y 3 = trX−1Y 4 = 0 in A5, a contradiction.
So s1 = 1 is not possible. The case s2 = 1 is considered analogously by
examination of the equation yxys3x2ys4xys1x2 = 1. Therefore, in total,
the angle at G1 is equal to π/6, and G is inﬁnite since
1

3 + 1
2 = 1.

For this last case (where R1(x, y) = xyxyx−1y−1) we also found the inﬁniteness
of G by using GAP.
Proposition 2.8 Let e2 ≥6, k1 ≥2, with 2 ≤fi ≤3 and exactly one fi equal
to 3. Then G is inﬁnite.
Proof If f1 = 3, then G is inﬁnite, since k1 ≥2 (see [5]). Hence, let f1 = 2.
If e1 ≥3 then G is inﬁnite if
1
e1

e2
+ 1
2 < 1.
Now let 1/e1 + 1/e2 + 1/2 = 1. Then e1 = 3 and e2 = 6. If G1 admits an essential
inﬁnite metabelian image in PSL(2, C) then G is inﬁnite since f2 = 3 or f3 = 3
(see Theorem 1.5). If the trace polynomial of R1(x, y) has a multiple root then G
is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.16. Hence G is inﬁnite by Corollary 1.6 and Theorem 1.5.
Assume now that
1
e1
+ 1
e2
+ 1
2 > 1.
Then e1 = 2.
1. Let e3 ≥3.
G is inﬁnite, if e3 ≥4 and if
1

e3

f3
< 1.
Assume now that e3 = 3 and
1
e2

f3

Then f3 = 2 and f2 = 3 as well as
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
= 1.
G is now inﬁnite analogously to the case e1 = 3.
2. Let e3 = 2. Then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = ye2 = z2 = R1(x, y)2 = (xz)f2 = R3(y, z)f3 = 1⟩
with e2 ≥6 and (f2, f3) = (3, 2) or (f2, f3) = (3, 2). As above, if G1 admits
an essential inﬁnite metabelian image in PSL(2, C) or if the trace polynomial
of R1(x, y) has a multiple root, then G is inﬁnite. Hence G is inﬁnite, since
k1 ≥2 by Corollary 1.6 and Theorem 1.5.
This completes the proof.

Let at least one fi be equal to 3. If G is ﬁnite then G is equivalent to one of the
following:

⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z2 = (xyxyxy2)3 = (xz)2 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 2880,
(2)
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z3 = (xyxyxy2)3 = (xz)2 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 864000,
(3)
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 360,
(4)
⟨x, y, z | x3 = y3 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 7200,
(5)
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z2 = (xyxy2)2 = (xz)3 = (yz)2 = 1⟩
of order 43200.
Proof Let G be ﬁnite. Then fi = 3 for precisely one i ∈{1, 2, 3} by Proposition
2.1 and kj ≥2 for precisely one j ∈{1, 2, 3} by Proposition 2.2. Hence k1 ≥2
and k2 = k3 = 1. If k1 ≥2 and f1 = 3 then G is equivalent to (1) or (2) by
Proposition 2.3.
Now, let f1 = 2 and, without any loss of generality, assume that f2 = 3. The
remaining part is a case-by-case consideration which is given in Propositions 2.4,
2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8.

The Tsaranov cases
Let
G = ⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = (xαyβ)f1 = (xγzδ)f2 = (yεzη)f3 = 1⟩
with
2 ≤e1, e2, e3, f1, f2, f3 and 1 ≤α, γ < r1, 1 ≤β, ε < e2, 1 ≤δ, η < e3.
We call such a presentation a Tsaranov case. We are only interested in ﬁnite Tsara-
nov cases which are not equivalent to presentations of ﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron
groups, since those groups can be considered by the Coxeter criterion. So, in the
following, let G be a Tsaranov case which is not equivalent to a presentation of a
ﬁnite ordinary tetrahedron group.

ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
Theorem 3.1 Let G be a ﬁnite Tsaranov case, not equivalent to a presentation of
an ordinary tetrahedron group. Let 2 ≤f1, f2, f3 ≤3 and at least one fi be equal
to 3. Then G is equivalent to the following presentation:
(6)
⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z3 = (xy)3 = (xz)2 = (y2z)2 = 1⟩of order 7200.
Proof G is inﬁnite for f1 = f2 = f3 = 3, since
1
3 + 1
3 + 1
3 = 1.
So, without loss of generality, let f1 = 3 and f2 = 2 or f3 = 2. We can assume that
e1 ≤e2.
If 1/e1 + 1/e2 + 1/3 < 1, then G is inﬁnite; hence let
1
e1
+ 1
e2
+ 1
3 ≥1.
We have that e1 ≤3 (since e1 ≤e2) and we have e1 = 2 if e2 ≥4. So we can
assume that α = 1.
If β = 2 and e2 = 4, or β = 2, 3 or 4 and e2 = 6, then G1 admits an essential
non-elementary image in PSL(2, C), and therefore G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.5. So
we can assume that β = 1 too. We have then
G = ⟨x, y, z | xe1 = ye2 = ze3 = (xy)3 = (xγzδ)f2 = (yεzη)f3 = 1⟩
with
1
e1
+ 1
e2
+ 1
3 ≥1
and (f2, f3) = (2, 2), (2, 3) or (3, 2).
If e1 = 3 then e2 = 3 and G1 admits an essential inﬁnite metabelian image in
PSL(2, C), and therefore G is inﬁnite if (e3, f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2, 2) by Theorem 1.5. For
e1 = 3 = e2 and (e3, f2, f3) = (2, 2, 2), G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron
group. So we have now that e1 = 2 and, further, that γ = 1. This argument is also
valid for the case e1 = 2 and e2 = 6, i.e. if e2 = 6 then G is inﬁnite or equivalent
to an ordinary tetrahedron group. So we have that e1 = 2 and 2 ≤e2 ≤5.
I) Let e2 = 4. If
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
< 1,
then G is inﬁnite. Hence let 1/e2 + 1/e3 + 1/f3 ≥1.
A) Assume ﬁrst that ε = 2. If f3 = 3, then e3 = 2 and G3 admits an
essential non-elementary image in PSL(2, C), i.e. G is inﬁnite.
So let f3 = 2. If e3 = 3, then G3 admits an essential non-elementary
image in PSL(2, C) and therefore, G is inﬁnite. If e3 = 2, we introduce
the relation y2 = 1 to get an inﬁnite factor group of G. So let e3 = 4.
Without loss of generality 1 ≤η ≤2. If η = 2, we introduce the relation
y2 = 1 to get an inﬁnite factor group of G. So let η = 1. If δ = 2 and

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS
483
f2 = 3, then G2 admits a non-elementary image in PSL(2, C); hence G
is inﬁnite.
If δ = 2 and f2 = 2, we introduce the relations y2 = z2 = 1 to get an
inﬁnite factor group of G. So assume (without loss of generality) that
δ = 1. Then we introduce again the relations y2 = z2 = 1 to get an
inﬁnite factor group of G. So we have that ε ̸= 2.
B) Assume now that ε = 1 or 3, and so (without loss of generality) ε = 1.
If e3 = 4 and δ = 2 or η = 2, we can use the same argument as above
to see that G is inﬁnite. So assume (without loss of generality) that
δ = 1 = η if e3 = 4.
If e2 = e3 = 4 then f3 = 2, and G3 admits an essential inﬁnite
metabelian image in PSL(2, C); in particular G is inﬁnite by Theorem 1.5
since f3 = 3. So let e3 ̸= 4. Since
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
≥1
we have then that e3 ≤3, and G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron
group.
II) Let e2 ̸= 4, e3 = 4. For
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
< 1,
G is inﬁnite. So let
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
≥1.
Then, necessarily, e2 ≤3. Analogously to I), G is inﬁnite, if δ = 2 or η = 2.
So let δ ̸= 2 ̸= η. Then G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron group.
III) e2 ̸= 4 ̸= e3. If
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
< 1 or
1
e1
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
< 1,
G is inﬁnite. So assume now that
1
e2
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
≥1 and
1
e1
+ 1
e3
+ 1
f3
≥1.
A) Let e3 ≥7. Then, necessarily, e2 = f2 = f3 = 2.
If we set d := gcd(δ, e3) ≥2 and introduce the relation zd = 1, we get an
inﬁnite factor group of G. Analogously, G is inﬁnite for gcd(η, e3) ≥2. If
we have gcd(η, e3) = gcd(δ, e3) = 1, then G is equivalent to an ordinary
tetrahedron group.
B) Let e3 = 6. Here (e2, f2, f3) ̸= (2, 2, 2) is possible.
If (e2, f2, f3) = (2, 2, 2), we get, analogously to the case e3 ≥7, either
an inﬁnite factor group, or G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron
group.

ROSENBERGER, SCHEER, THOMAS
If e2 = 3, then f3 = 2, and G3 admits an essential non-elementary
image in PSL(2, C) if η = 2, 3 or 4, and G3 admits an essential inﬁnite
metabelian image if η = 1 or 5. In both cases, G is inﬁnite, since f1 = 3.
If f3 = 3 then e2 = 2 and we have, analogously, that G is inﬁnite. So
let e2 = f3 = 2 and f2 = 3. If δ = 2, 3 or 4 then G2 admits an essential
non-elementary image in PSL(2, C), and, if δ = 1 or 5, then G2 admits
an essential inﬁnite metabelian image; G is inﬁnite in both cases, since
f1 = 3.
So, in the following, let e3 ≤5.
C) e2 = 2. Then
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y2 = ze3 = (xy)3 = (xzδ)f2 = (yzη)f3 = 1⟩
with 2 ≤e3 ≤5, e3 ̸= 4 and (f2, f3) = (2, 2), (2, 3) or (3, 2).
If e3 = 2 or 3, then G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron group.
Assume now that e3 = 5. If f2 = f3 = 2, then G is equivalent to an
ordinary tetrahedron group. So let f2 = 3; then f3 = 2. We can assume
that δ = 1 (replace z with a power) and, afterwards, we can assume
that η = 1 (use the dihedral relation). So, again, G is equivalent to an
ordinary tetrahedron group.
The same holds for (f2, f3) = (2, 3).
D) Here we have
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y3 = ze3 = (xy)3 = (xzδ)f2 = (yzη)f3 = 1⟩
with
2 ≤e3 ≤5, e3 ̸= 4, 1 ≤δ, η < e3 and (f2, f3) = (2, 2), (2, 3) or (3, 2).
If 2 ≤e3 ≤3 then G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron group. So
let e3 = 5. Then f3 = 2.
If f2 = 2, then G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron group (use
the dihedral relation). So assume now that f2 = 3. We can assume that
η = 1 and e1 = 2, since 1 ≤δ ≤2. For η = δ = 1, G is inﬁnite by the
Coxeter criterion. For η = 1, δ = 2, G is inﬁnite by GAP.
E) e2 = 5. Since
1
5 + 1
e3
+ 1
f3
≥1,
we have, necessarily, that 2 ≤e3 ≤3 and f3 = 2 if e3 = 3. Then,
without loss of generality,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = ze3 = (xy)3 = (xz)f2 = (yβz)f3 = 1⟩
with 1 ≤β ≤2.
If β = 1, then G is equivalent to an ordinary tetrahedron group; so let
β = 2. Assume ﬁrst that e3 = 2. If f3 = 2, then G is equivalent to

FINITE GENERALIZED TETRAHEDRON GROUPS
485
an ordinary tetrahedron group (use the dihedral relation). Assume now
that e3 = 2, f3 = 3. Then f2 = 2 and
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z2 = (xy)3 = (xz)2 = (y2z)3 = 1⟩.
Here G is inﬁnite by GAP.
So ﬁnally assume that e3 = 3. Then f3 = 2, and we have, without loss
of generality, up to equivalence,
G = ⟨x, y, z | x2 = y5 = z3 = (xy)3 = (xz)f2 = (y2z)2 = 1⟩.
For f2 = 3, G is inﬁnite by GAP. For f2 = 2 we have the desired
presentation with order 7200.
This completes the proof.

Abstract
If G is a ﬁnite group and q is an integer such that the degree of every irreducible
character of G is a power of q, we say that G is a q-power-degree group. The aim of
this note is to solve the following problem: Which are the classical groups deﬁned
over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq (Fq2 in the unitary case) of characteristic p whose Sylow
p-subgroups are q-power-degree groups?
1
Introduction
Throughout this paper p will denote the characteristic of the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq with q
elements. It is an elementary exercise to check that the set Tn(q) of unitriangular
matrices (i. e., upper triangular matrices with ones in the diagonal) over Fq is a
Sylow p-subgroup of the full linear group GLn(q). Isaacs proved in [4] that the
degree of any irreducible character of this group is not only a power of p (as one
should expect because we are dealing with a p-group) but actually, a power of q.
For the sake of completeness we shall give later a simpliﬁed proof of this result.
Previtali [6], using techniques of Isaacs, showed that the same property holds
for the Sylow p-subgroups of other families of classical groups (symplectic, uni-
tary and orthogonal of maximal Witt index, always in odd characteristic and even
dimension). Our goal is to settle the question of which are exactly the classical
groups for which this result of Isaacs can be extended, and the answer is given in
the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1 (Main Theorem) Let G be any classical group, except symplectic
or orthogonal in even characteristic. Then the degrees of the irreducible characters
of a Sylow p-subgroup of G are powers of q. Moreover, this is not true with complete
generality in the symplectic and orthogonal cases in even characteristic.
It deserves to be noticed that the same result holds word for word if we replace
‘degrees of the irreducible characters’ by ‘conjugacy class sizes’ (see [7]).
A couple of works have appeared recently related to our theorem. For odd char-
acteristic the same result has been established by Szegedy in [8] and, for even

nol´ogica (I+D+I) of the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnolog´ıa, grant BFM2001-0180.

characteristic, the behaviour of the Sylow 2-subgroups of the symplectic and or-
thogonal groups of maximal Witt index has been clariﬁed in [1].
A direct approach to obtain the desired result via Cliﬀord theory fails (even
for the unitriangular groups) because it is not clear how to relate the structure of
the inertia groups that will arise in the analysis with the structure of the whole
group. However, this procedure is useful to see for instance, that a given number (a
power of q, of course!) is the degree of some irreducible character, which eventually
may lead to the determination of the complete set of degrees of the irreducible
characters, taking for granted that all these numbers are powers of q (see [2, 5]).
To circumvent this problem Isaacs enlarged the family of groups under consider-
ation including all the groups of the form G = 1+J, where J is a ﬁnite dimensional
nilpotent Fq-algebra. He called these groups algebra groups and he also introduced
the term q-power-degree groups for the groups whose irreducible characters have
degrees that are powers of q. What Isaacs proved is that algebra groups, as well
as certain subgroups of them, are q-power-degree groups. The subgroups we have
in mind are the so-called strong subgroups: a subgroup S ≤G = 1 + J is strong
if for any subalgebra H of J, the order of the intersection S ∩(1 + H) is a power
of q. Our main theorem will follow from the fact that the groups that appear in it
can be realized as strong subgroups of unitriangular groups.

Isaacs’s result on algebra groups
We present in this section a shortened proof of the key lemma in Isaacs’ result.
Lemma 2.1 Suppose that a group G has normal subgroups M, Hi, 1 ≤i ≤r,
such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) |G : Hi| = q for all 1 ≤i ≤r and |G : M| = q2.
(ii) The intersection of any two subgroups Hi and Hj is M and the union of all
of them is the whole G.
(iii) All subgroups Hi and M are q-power-degree groups.
Then G is also a q-power-degree group.
Proof Some immediate consequences of the hypotheses are that the number of the
subgroups Hi is r = q + 1 and
G = HiHj
for any i ̸= j.
(2.1)
Also, condition (iii) together with the fact that |Hi : M| = q imply that for any
irreducible character ϕ of M, either ϕHi is irreducible or it is the sum of the q
diﬀerent extensions of ϕ to Hi. If R is the inertia group of ϕ in G, the former case
holds when R ∩Hi = M and the latter, when Hi ⊆R. Combining this with (ii)
and (2.1), we conclude that the inertia group R must be M, one of the Hi or the
full group G.
Suppose now that χ is an irreducible character of G and ϕ is an irreducible
constituent of χM.
By Cliﬀord’s correspondence, χ = ηG for some irreducible
character η of R, the inertia group of ϕ, and χ(1) = |G : R|η(1). At this point, it

SYLOW p-SUBGROUPS OF CLASSICAL GROUPS
489
is clear that χ(1) is a power of q if R is M or one of the Hi, so we only need to
consider the case R = G.
Then we have χM = eϕ for some 1 ≤e ≤q and we’ll be done once we prove that
e = 1 or q. By restricting χ to Hi, we obtain that χ(1) = fi|G : Ri|ϕi(1), where ϕi
is an irreducible component of χHi and Ri is its inertia group. Moreover, ϕi is an
extension of ϕ, thus their degrees coincide and e = fi|G : Ri|, whence
(χHi, χHi) = f2
i |G : Ri| = efi.
Now, expanding the right hand side of the equality 1 = (χ, χ) as a sum running
over G and grouping the terms according to the decomposition of G as the disjoint
union of M and the sets Hi\M, we obtain, after some simpliﬁcations, the relation
q = −e2 + e
q+1

i=1
fi,
so q ≥−e2 + e(q + 1) and (e −q)(e −1) ≥0. Since e is between 1 and q, only the
cases e = 1 or e = q can occur, which ﬁnishes the proof.
2
Once the spadework has been done in the previous lemma, the results follow
quite straightforwardly (see [4, Sections 3 and 4] for the details).
Corollary 2.1 Algebra groups over Fq are q-power-degree groups.
Proof Induct on the order of the group, the abelian case being trivial. If G =
1 + J is not abelian, the dimension of J/J2 is at least 2. Take a subspace U with
J2 ⊆U ⊂J of codimension 2 and Hi the hyperplanes of J containing U. Then
apply the lemma with M = 1 + U and Hi = 1 + Hi.
2
Corollary 2.2 Let G be an algebra group and S ≤G a strong subgroup. Then S
is a q-power-degree group.
Proof Argue again by induction on the order of G, which can be supposed to
be non-abelian. Let M and Hi be as in the proof of the previous corollary. If
S is contained in one of the Hi, the result follows from the inductive hypothesis;
otherwise apply the lemma in S with the subgroups S ∩M and S ∩Hi.

Sylow p-subgroups of the classical groups as strong subgroups
Suppose that f : J −→1 + J is a bijection between a nilpotent algebra J and its
associated algebra group G = 1 + J and assume that f maps each subalgebra H
of J into its corresponding algebra subgroup 1 + H. Note that this condition is
not as restrictive as one might think, any polynomial bijection of the type f(u) =
1 + a1u + a2u2 + · · · + amum will do. Now, if U is a subspace of J, its image f(U)
satisﬁes that
|f(U) ∩(1 + H)| = |f(U) ∩f(H)| = |f(U ∩H)| = |U ∩H|

490
SANGRONIZ
is a power of q (U ∩H being also a subspace of J), so whenever f(U) is a subgroup
of G, it is in fact a strong subgroup.
On the other hand, almost all polynomial functions from J to 1+J are bijective:
if f is as before, the only requirement is that a1 = f′(0) ̸= 0 (this is so because any
formal power series a1x + a2x2 + · · · with a1 ̸= 0 is invertible in the ring of formal
power series). In particular, any rational function f(x) = r(x)/s(x) with s(0) ̸= 0
(which ensures it can be expanded as a power series of x) satisfying f(0) = 1 and
f′(0) ̸= 0 can be used to prove that a given subgroup of G is strong.
Now we turn to classical groups. Symplectic groups and orthogonal groups in
odd characteristic can be realized as groups of the form
GB = {X ∈GLn(q) | XBXt = B}
(here Xt is the transposed matrix of X) for suitable ﬁxed n × n matrices B. Con-
jugation by an invertible matrix P has the eﬀect of replacing B by P −1B(P −1)t,
so since Tn(q) is a Sylow p-subgroup of GLn(q), there is no loss of generality if we
assume that
TB = {X ∈Tn(q) | XBXt = B}
is a Sylow p-subgroup of GB. To see that TB is a strong subgroup of the algebra
group Tn(q) all we have to do is to ﬁnd a rational function f and a subspace TB of
the algebra Tn(q) associated to Tn(q) (that is, Tn(q) consists of the strictly upper
triangular matrices) such that TB = f(TB). Routine calculations show that, if the
characteristic is odd, we can take f to be the rational function f(x) = (1−x)/(1+x)
and
TB = {X0 ∈Tn(q) | X0B + BXt
0 = 0},
which is clearly a subspace of Tn(q). The map f is called the Cayley parametrization
of the classical group GB (see [9, Lemma 2.10A]).
Similar remarks can be made in the unitary case (in any characteristic): we ﬁx
an n × n matrix B over Fq2 and set 2GB = {X ∈GLn(q2) | XBX
t = B} (the bar
indicates the automorphism of the group GLn(q2) induced by the automorphism
of the base ﬁeld x 	→xq). Again, we can suppose that
2TB = {X ∈Tn(q2) | XBX
t = B}
is a Sylow p-subgroup of 2GB. To deﬁne f we take an element a ∈Fq2 such that
aa = a1+q = 1 and a ̸= −1 (such an element always exists, in odd characteristic
the obvious choice is a = 1). Then we set f(x) = (1 −x)/(1 + ax). One can check
that f satisﬁes the conditions required and that 2TB = f(2TB), where 2TB is the
Fq-subspace
2TB = {X0 ∈Tn(q2) | aX0B + BX
t
0 = 0}.
The following result is now clear from the preceding discussion.
Theorem 3.1 The groups TB (for q odd) and 2TB are q-power-degree groups. In
particular this happens for the Sylow p-subgroups of the classical groups (except in
the symplectic and orthogonal cases in even characteristic).

SYLOW p-SUBGROUPS OF CLASSICAL GROUPS

Classical groups in even characteristic
In [4] (see also [1]) Isaacs proved that if q is a power of 2, the Sylow 2-subgroups
of the symplectic group Sp6(q) have an irreducible character of degree q/2, so that
Theorem 3.1 can not be extended to the symplectic case when the characteristic is
2. Thus, only the orthogonal cases in characteristic 2 remain to be considered. For
a description of the structure of these groups we refer the reader to [7].
The Sylow 2-subgroups of Ω+
2n(q), the orthogonal group of maximal Witt index
and dimension 2n, can be constructed as the semidirect product G of the additive
group A of the n × n symmetric matrices with zero diagonal and the unitriangular
group Tn(q), where the action is given by aX = X−1a(X−1)t for a ∈A and
X ∈Tn(q).
Any n × n matrix m gives an irreducible character of A by means of ζm(a) =
ψ(tr(am)), where ψ: Fq −→C∗is a ﬁxed non-trivial linear character of the additive
group of the ﬁeld Fq and tr(x) gives the trace of the matrix x. In fact, all the
irreducible characters of A arise in this way. Of course, repetitions may occur, to
be more precise, ζm = ζm′ if and only if m −m′ is symmetric, that is m + mt =
m′+(m′)t. On the other hand, for X ∈Tn(q), the conjugate character (ζm)X equals
ζXtmX, thus X is in the inertia group of ζm if and only if Xt(m + mt)X = m + mt.
To simplify notation we set n = 4, although our construction works as well for
any n ≥4 (for n ≤3, the groups are q-power-degree), and we take
m =

and ζ = ζm (for a general n, just add the necessary zero rows and columns). Some
computations show that the inertia group of ζ in T4(q) is

Since I has nilpotence class 2, for any irreducible character η of I, we have η2(1) =
|I : Z(η)| (see [3, Theorem 2.31]). Now we make a suitable choice for η. The set
L = {x + x2 | x ∈Fq} is an additive subgroup of Fq of index 2, so the matrices
in Z(I) for which v + z ∈L make up a subgroup K of Z(I) of index 2 and there
exists a linear character ϕ of Z(I) with kernel K. We take η to be an irreducible
constituent of ϕI. The condition for an element X ∈I to be in the center of η is
that [X, I] ⊆Ker η, but [X, I] ⊆I′ = Z(I), so this is equivalent to [X, I] being
inside Ker ϕ = K. We conclude that a matrix like in (4.2) is in Z(η) if and only
if (x + x2)u′ + u(x′ + x′2) ∈L for all x′, u′ ∈Fq, which means that x = 0 or
1 and uL ⊆L. Note that this last condition forces u = 0 or 1: if u ̸= 0, we
can regard the map x 	→ux as an F2-linear semisimple operator of Fq, so a one
F2-dimensional invariant subspace must exist (to complement L) and this implies
u = 1. To summarize, the center of η consists of the matrices in (4.2) with u, x = 0
or 1. In particular, |Z(η)| = 4q2 and η(1) = |I : Z(η)|1/2 = q/2.
Now we use Cliﬀord theory to obtain the desired character of our group G. The
inertia group of ζ in G is the (semidirect) product R = IA and ζ has an obvious
extension ζ to R. By Gallagher’s theorem [3, Corollary 6.17], the product ηζ is an
irreducible constituent of ζR so, by Cliﬀord’s correspondence, it induces irreducibly
to G. The degree of the resulting character is |G : R|η(1) = q3/2, which is not
a power of q if q > 2. (For a general n ≥4, one obtains a character of degree
q4n−13/2.)
We ﬁnally consider the orthogonal groups Ω−
2n+2(q) of non-maximal Witt index.
A Sylow 2-subgroup G of this group can be described as follows. We take the
matrices
S =
0
1
1
0

and C =
α
0
1
α

,
where α ∈Fq is such that the polynomial αx2 + x + α is irreducible and deﬁne M
to be the set of matrices with a block decomposition of the type


In
u
a
0
I2
Sut
0
0
In

,
(4.3)
where In denotes the n×n identity matrix and u and a are blocks of size n×2 and
n × n, respectively, which satisfy the condition a + uCut ∈A (A is as before). As
one can quickly check, M is a subgroup of T2n+2(q) and A is naturally embedded
in it. The commutator of the matrices in M with blocks u, a and u′, a′ is


In
0
uSu′t + u′Sut

I2

and we deduce form this that M′ = A = Z(M). Now, conjugation by


,

on (4.3) simply replaces u by X−1u and a by X−1a(X−1)t, thus Tn(q) acts on M
and we can consider the corresponding semidirect product, which turns out to be
(isomorphic to) our group G.
Again, for the sake of simplicity, we take n = 4 although our argument can be
extended to any n ≥4. We ﬁx m, ζ and I as in the previous case. Since A is
central in M, it is clear that the inertia group of ζ in G is R = IM. We introduce
the subgroup H of M which consists of the matrices (4.3) for which the last two
rows of u are zero. Multiplication by elements in T4(q) preserves this property, so
T4(q) normalizes H, that is, H is a normal subgroup of G. If h ∈H is like in (4.3)
and X ∈I, we deﬁne
ζ(Xh) = ψ(tr(am)).
Direct computations show that ζ is a character of L = IH, which obviously extends
ζ. We put ϕ = ζR. Note that R = LM and L∩M = H, so ϕM = (ζR)M = (ζH)M.
An element y ∈M ﬁxes ζH if and only if [y, H] ⊆Ker ζ, a condition equivalent to
[y, H] ⊆Ker ζ because [y, H] ⊆A. Moreover, [y, H], viewed inside the vector space
A, is a subspace, so the last containment amounts to saying that tr([y, h]m) = 0
for all h ∈H and it follows from here that y itself is in H. We have proved that the
inertia group of ζH in M is H, whence ϕM = (ζH)M is irreducible and so is ϕ. By
Gallagher’s theorem the characters ηϕ, for η any irreducible character of R/M, are
the irreducible constituents of (ϕM)R. But, as we know, R/M ∼= I has irreducible
characters of degree q/2, so one of these constituents has degree q5/2. By inducing
it to G we obtain an irreducible character of G of degree q7/2 (irreducibility is
guaranteed by Cliﬀord’s correspondence). (For a general n ≥4, one can obtain an
irreducible character of degree q4n−9/2.)

Suppose that S acts coprimely on G. Write C = CG(S) for the ﬁxed points
subgroup and IrrS(G) for the set of S-invariant irreducible complex characters of
G. It is well known that under these hypothesis there is a natural bijection
ˆ: IrrS(G) →Irr(C) .
This map (the Glauberman-Isaacs correspondence) was constructed by G.
Glauberman (when S is solvable [2]), and by I. M. Isaacs (when S is nonsolvable,
and therefore |G| is odd). Later on T. Wolf proved in [8] that both bijections were
the same when both were deﬁned.
Now, ﬁx a prime p, and notice that S permutes the set of Brauer p-blocks of
G.
Although the Glauberman-Isaacs correspondence preserves many properties
of characters, it does not preserve S-invariant characters in the same block: if
χ, ψ ∈IrrS(G) lie in the block B, it is not necessarily true that ˆχ and ˆψ lie in
the same p-block of C (see [9] for more details). This anomalous behaviour does
not occur when S centralizes some defect group of B by a remarkable result of A.
Watanabe. In fact, she proves much more.
Theorem 0.1 (A. Watanabe) Suppose that S solvable acts coprimely on G and
let B be an S-invariant p-block of G. If S centralizes a defect group D of B, then
all Irr(B) are S-invariant and there is a block b of C with defect group D such that
{ˆχ | χ ∈Irr(B)} = Irr(b). Furthermore, χ →±ˆχ deﬁnes a perfect isometry.
(The important notion of a perfect isometry is due to M. Brou´e and we refer the
reader to [1] for the deﬁnition and main properties.)
Of course, Watanabe’s theorem left one case open: when |G| is odd (andˆis the
Isaacs correspondence). This case was proven by H. Horimoto in [3].
Another well-known character correspondence of characters was discovered by
M. Isaacs in [4]. If G is a group and q is a prime, we write Irrq′(G) for the irreducible
characters of G of degree not divisible by q.

Let Q ∈Sylq(G) and let G be a group of odd order. Isaacs proved in [4] that
there is a natural bijection
∗: Irrq′(G) →Irrq′(NG(Q))
(proving a stronger form of the McKay conjecture for groups of odd order).
Again, this correspondence does not preserve q′-degree irreducible characters
in the same p-block. However, in our new situation, we can ﬁnd the analogous
condition to Watanabe’s that guarantees that the Isaacs correspondence is a perfect
isometry. This is the result that we present in this note.
Theorem 0.2 Let B be a p-block of a group G of odd order and assume that
Irr(B) ⊆Irrq′(G). Then there is a unique p-block of NG(Q) such that {χ∗| χ ∈
Irr B} = Irr(b). The defect group of b is a defect group of B and the map χ →χ∗
is a perfect isometry.
Proof This is the main result of [6].
2
Implicit in Theorem 2, we notice the fact that if q does not divide χ(1) for all
χ ∈Irr(B), then a defect group of B normalizes a Sylow q-subgroup of G. This
result, which is highly non-trivial, is the main result of [5]. Since it is not diﬃcult
to show that if q does not divide χ(1) for some χ ∈Irr(B) and a defect group of B
normalizes a Sylow q-subgroup of G, then all Irr(B) have q′-degree we have that
the above theorem is the analogous condition to Watanabe’s in Theorem 1.

Abstract
In this article we obtain all the complex irreducible characters and the conjugacy
classes of the group PSp(4, q), where q is a power of an odd prime. 1

Introduction
The complex irreducible characters of the symplectic group Sp(4, q) with q odd
prime power , has been calculated by B. Srinivasan [3]. But character tables of [3]
have some misprints. Fortunately Professor B. Srinivasan and Dr Frank Luebeck
provided us the corrections of these misprints. Now you can see in appendix I
all of the necessary corrections. By using [3], we investigate the collection of the
conjugacy classes of the group Sp(4, q), one by one, to ﬁnd conjugacy classes of
PSp(4, q) and the size of these classes. Then, we will able to obtain the character
table of PSp(4, q).

Notation
We will use the notation of [3] throughout this paper. The symplectic group Sp(4, q)
of dimension 4 over ﬁnite ﬁelds of odd order, Fq = GF(q), is the set of all 4 × 4
matrices X which satisﬁes XJX′ = J, where
J =

The order of Sp(4, q) is q4(q2 −1)(q4 −1), where q is a power of an odd prime p,
and its center is Z = {I, −I}, where I is the identity matrix. The quotient group
Sp(4, q)/Z is called projective symplectic group. It is denoted by PSp(4, q).
Let κ be a generator of the multiplicative group of GF(q4), and let ζ = κq2−1,
θ = κq2+1, η = θq−1 and γ = θq+1. We choose a ﬁxed monomorphism from the
multiplicative group of the GF(q4) into the multiplicative group of the complex

corrections of the character table of Sp(4, q) and remarks.

numbers, and let ˜ζ, ˜θ, ˜η and ˜γ be the images of ζ, θ, η and γ respectively under
this monomorphism. Let R1 be the set of 1
4(q2 −1) distinct positive integers i, such
that all of the scalers ζi, ζ−i, ζqi and ζ−qi be distinct, and also let R2 be the set of
1
4(q−1)2 distinct positive integers i, such that all of the scalers θi, θ−i, θqi and θ−qi
be distinct. Assume T1 = {1, 2, ..., 1
2(q−3)}, T2 = {1, 2, ..., 1
2(q−1)}, αj = ˜γj +˜γ−j,
βj = ˜ηj + ˜η−j, ˜ϵ = −s(s + √sq) and ˜ϵ′ = −s(s −√sq), where s = (−1)(q−1)/2.
First we calculate conjugacy classes of PSp(4, q).
3
Conjugacy classes of PSp(4, q)
In this section we will determine the conjugacy classes of PSp(4, q). To do this we
will use conjugacy classes and character table of the group Sp(4, q). One can see
both the character table and the conjugacy classes of the group Sp(4, q) in [3]. (see
appendix I the corrected table.)
We choose a representative X of a conjugacy class A and then multiply it by
−I. Then we search to see that, −X lies in which conjugacy classes of Sp(4, q).
If both X and −X lie in A, then the canonical image of A in PSp(4, q) will form
an independent conjugacy class, where its size is half of the size of the conjugacy
class A. If X and −X lie in the distinct classes A and A′ respectively, then any
element of A′ will be the additive inverse of some element in A, and so the canonical
image of A and A′ coincide in PSp(4, q). Therefore, they make only one class, ¯A, in
PSp(4, q), where its size is the same as A. But this method does not work for any
class of Sp(4, q). For, in some classes it needs lots of work to see that −X lies in
which classes of Sp(4, q). Therefore, we have to use the character table of the group
Sp(4, q). We consider those irreducible characters of Sp(4, q), which their values in
I and −I are equal. Then these irreducible characters also will be the irreducible
characters of PSp(4, q) [ See I, page 24]. Therefore, if the values of these irreducible
characters are the same in some conjugacy classes of Sp(4, q), then the canonical
images of these classes form an independent class in PSp(4, q) and the size of this
new conjugacy class is half of the sum of the sizes of these merged classes. But,
also this method can not work for any classes in Sp(4, q). For, the existence of a
large numbers of the irreducible characters of Sp(4, q) and the n-th roots of unity
in their values is an obstacle, so we need to do more work in some classes.
Now by using above methods and notations of [3], we will obtain the conjugacy
classes of PSp(4, q). Note that we will use only one notation for a class and its
representative.
3.1
The classes A and A′
By [3], it is easy to see that, any conjugacy class A′ with any index is the additive
inverse of A with the same index. Therefore, from two classes A and A′ with the
same index , we obtain a class ¯A with the same index in PSp(4, q), where its size
is equal to the size of class A.
3.2
Collections of the classes B

498
SHAHABI, MOHTADIFAR
From the table of the conjugacy classes in [3], one can see that, the conjugacy
classes of type B have been classiﬁed with respect to their indices.
So we will
consider each of them separately.
3-2.1
Collection of the classes B1
By [3], we have
B1(i) = Diag(ζi, ζ−i, ζqi, ζ−qi); i ∈R1 & ζq2+1 = 1.
Note : In [3], the set R1 is misprinted. For, with this deﬁnition of R1, the conjugacy
classes B1(i) can not be distinct.
But, by new deﬁnition of R1(see section 2),
the classes B1(i) with i ∈R1 are distinguished by the corresponding irreducible
characters χ1(i) with i ∈R1.
It is easy to see that each conjugacy class B1(i) with i ∈R1 is determined with the
set
{±i, ±qi} mod (q2 + 1). eqno(1)
Since ζ±(q2+1)/2 = −1, if we multiply B1(i) by −I, then modulo (q2 + 1), the set
(1) is transformed to the set
{±i ∓(q2 + 1)/2, ±qi ∓(q2 + 1)/2}.
(2)
But, 1
2(q2 + 1) is odd, therefore, if i is odd(even), then −i + 1
2(q2 + 1) is even(odd).
It follows that, the elements of the classes B1(i) with i ∈R1 and i odd, and the
elements of the classes B1(i) with i ∈R1 and i even, are additive inverses of each
other. Hence their canonical images are merged in PSp(4, q). So we obtain 1
8(q2+1)
classes ¯B1(i) with i ∈R1 and i even, where their sizes are is the same as B1(i).
3-2.2
Collection of the classes B2
By [3], we have
B2(i) = Diag(θi, θ−i, θqi, θ−qi); i ∈R2 & θq2−1 = 1.
Like B1(i) each class B2(i) with i ∈R2 is determined with the set
{±i, ±qi} mod (q2 −1).
(3)
Since θ±(q2−1)/2 = −1, if we multiply B2(i) by −I, then modulo (q2 −1), the set
(3) is transformed to the set
{±i ∓(q2 −1)/2, ±qi ∓(q2 −1)/2}.
(4)
Now we consider two cases :
a) If i ∈R2 satisﬁes the following equation
i −(q2 −1)/2 ≡±qi mod (q2 −1),
(5)
then the conjugacy class B2(i) contains the additive inverse of each of its elements.
Hence the size of its canonical image ¯B2(i) is half of the size of the class B2(i).

THE CHARACTERS OF PSp(4, q)
499
The congruent equation (5) have 1
2(q −1) distinct solution in R2. If we denote this
set of solutions by R′
2, then in PSp(4, q) we have 1
2(q −1) conjugacy classes ¯B2(i)
with i ∈R′
2 such that their sizes are 1
2q4(q4 −1).
b) If i ∈R2 dose not satisfy the equation (5), then −B2(i) is another class from
the remaining class of this collection of classes.
In other word, there is a j ∈
R2 −R′
2 with j ̸= i, such that −B2(i)=B2(j). Thus, these two classes are merged
in PSp(4, q) under the canonical homomorphism. Therefore, we have 1
8(q−1)(q−3)
classes ¯B2(i), i ∈R′′ with the size q4(q4 −1), where R′′ is the set of 1
8(q −1)(q −3)
positive integers i ∈R −R′, such that all of the scalers θi, θ−i, θqi and θ−qi are
distinct, without considering their signs.
3-2.3
Collection of the classes B3
By [3], we have
B3(i, j) = Diag(γi, γ−i, γj, γ−j); γq−1 = 1, i, j ∈T1 & i < j.
Each class B3(i, j) is determined by the set
{±i, ±j} mod (q −1).
(6)
If we multiply B3(i, j) by −I, then the set (6) is transformed to the set
{±i + q −1
2
, ±j + q −1
2
},
(7)
since γ(q−1)/2 = −1. Now modulo (q-1), the set (7) will be
{±q −1
2
∓i, ±q −1
2
∓j}.
(8)
Therefore the classes B3(i, j) and −B3(i, j) are equal, if and only if 1
2(q−1)−i = j,
or if and only if 1
2(q −1) = i + j. Note that the classes B3(i, j) and B3(j, i) are
equal. For, EB3(i, j)E = B3(i, j), where
E =

0

1




.
Therefore, we have two cases :
a) For q=4k+1, the classes B3(i, j) and −B3(i, j) are equal if and only if i =
1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −5) and j = 1
2(q −1) −i. Thus each of the 1
4(q −5) classes
B3(i, j); i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −5) , j = 1
2(q −1) −i,
contains the additive inverse of each element of itself. Hence the canonical images
of these classes in PSp(4, q) form an independent class ¯B3(i, j), where its size equals
to half of the size of B3(i, j). On the other hand, in the remaining classes of the

500
SHAHABI, MOHTADIFAR
collection B3, we have the following properties. For any B3(i, j) with i+j < 1
2(q+1),
if we multiply it by −I, then we obtain the class B3(i′, j′) with i′ + j′ > 1
2(q −1)
where i′ = 1
2(q −1) −j and j′ = 1
2(q −1) −i. Hence, the canonical images of these
two classes coincide in PSp(4, q) and form a class with the same size as B3(i, j).
Consequently, from the remaining classes, we obtain
1
16(q −1)2 distinct classes
¯B3(i, j); 1 ≤i ≤q −5
4
& i < j ≤q −3
4
−i,
in PSp(4, q) with the same size as B3(i, j).
b)For q=4k+3, two classes B3(i, j) and −B3(i, j) are equal, if and only if i =
1, 2, ..., k and j = 1
2(q −1) −i. So with the similar argument as in case (a), in
PSp(4, q) we obtain k = 1
4(q −3) classes ¯B3(i, j) with the size equal to the half
of the size of B3(i, j), where i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −3) and j = 1
2(q −1) −i and also
1
16(q−3)(q−7) classes ¯B3(i, j) with the same size as B3(i, j), where 1 ≤i ≤1
4(q−7)
and i < j ≤1
4(q −3) −i.
3-2.4
Collection of the classes B4
By [3], we have
B4(i, j) = Diag(ηi, η−i, ηj, η−j); ηq+1 = 1, i, j ∈T2 & i < j.
With the similar argument as in section 3-2.2, we see that, if q = 4k+1 (q = 4k+3),
we have k = 1
4(q −1) (k = 1
4(q −3)) classes
B4(i, j); i = 1, 2, ..., k & j = 1
4(q + 1) −i,
where each class B4(i, j) contains the additive inverses of its elements.
So the
canonical images of these classes are distinct and their sizes are divided by 2. But,
from the remaining classes of this collection we obtain the following classes in
PSp(4, q). If q = 4k + 1, then, we have
1
16(q −1)(q −5) classes ¯B4(i, j); 1 ≤i ≤
1
4(q −5) and i < j ≤1
2(q −1) −i. If q = 4k + 3, then we have
1
16(q −3)2 classes
¯B4(i, j); 1 ≤i ≤1
4(q −3) and i < j < 1
2(q −1) −i, where in both cases the size of
¯B4(i, j) is the same as B4(i, j).
3-2.5
Collection of classes B5
We have,
B5(i, j) = Diag(ηi, η−i, γj, γ−j); ηq+1 = 1 = γq−1, i ∈T2 & j ∈T1
By multiplying B5(i, j) by −I, we obtain the class B5( q+1
2
−i,
q−1
2
−j). It is
easy to see that these two classes are distinct. (Note that, if equality occurs, then
i = 1
4(q −1) and j = 1
4(q −3). But, for such an i and j there is no integral solution
for q). Consequently, this collection of classes contains B5(i, j) and −B5(i, j), for
each i ∈T2 and j ∈T1. Hence, the canonical image of them coincide in PSp(4, q).
Thus, in PSp(4, q) there are a number of 1
8(q−1)(q−3) distinct classes ¯B5(i, j) with
size q4(q4 −1) where; if q = 4k + 1, then 1 ≤i ≤1
4(q −1) and 1 ≤j ≤1
2(q −3),
and if q = 4k + 3, then 1 ≤i ≤1
2(q −1) and 1 ≤j ≤1
4(q −3).

3-2.6
Collection of classes B6
By [3], we have
B6(i) = Diag(ηi, η−i, ηi, η−i); ηq+1 = 1 & ∈T2.
We determine each class B6(i) in this collection by the set
{±i} mod (q + 1).
(9)
While the class −B6(i) is determined by the set
{±q + 1
2
∓i} mod (q + 1).
(10)
We see that modulo (q + 1), the sets (9) and (10) are distinct, unless, i = 1
4(q + 1)
and q = 4k + 1. Therefore, we have two cases :
a) If q = 4k+1, then under the canonical homomorphism, the classes B6(i), i ∈T2,
will give 1
4(q −1) classes ¯B6(i), i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −1) with the sizes q3(q −1)(q2 + 1)
in PSp(4, q).
b) If q = 4k+3, then the canonical image ¯B6( q+1
4 ) of the class B6( q+1
4 ) has the size
1
2q3(q −1)(q2 + 1). Under the canonical homomorphism, from 1
2(q −3) remaining
classes, half of them merge with another half, and we obtain 1
4(q −3) classes ¯B6(i),
i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −3) with the sizes q3(q −1)(q2 + 1) in PSp(4, q).
We postpone B7(i) to be after B8(i), since in the investigation of this class and
B9(i) we use method 2.
3-2.7
Collection of the classes B8
By [3], we have
B8(i) = Diag(γi, γ−i, γi, γ−i); γq−1 = 1 & i ∈T1
By the Similar argument of B6(i) , we have :
a) If q = 4k + 1, then the classes B8( q−1
4 ) causes a class ¯B8( q−1
4 ) with the size
1
2q3(q + 1)(q2 + 1) in PSp(4, q).
From the remaining classes, we obtain classes
¯B8(i), i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −5) with the size q3(q + 1)(q2 + 1) in PSp(4, q).
b) If q = 4k + 3, then from the collection of the classes B8(i), we obtain 1
4(q −3)
classes ¯B8(i); i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −3) with the size q3(q + 1)(q2 + 1) in PSp(4, q).
3-2.8
Collection of classes B7
To investigate the situation of the canonical images of B7(i) with i ∈T2, in
PSp(4, q), we consider the values of those irreducible characters of Sp(4, q) in B7(i)
which have equal value in ±I. For, these are also irreducible character of PSp(4, q).
Again, we have two cases :
a) If q = 4k + 1, then the irreducible characters which have equal values in ±I,
also have equal values in B7(i) and B7( q+1
2 −i). For, the values of these irreducible
characters in this collection are determined by βik = ˜ηik+˜η−ik. Since η(q+1)/2 = −1,

502
SHAHABI, MOHTADIFAR
we have β( q+1
2 −i)k = (−1)kβik and in our above mentioned characters (−1)k is
cancelled. For example, the value of the irreducible character ξ′
21(k)(k is odd) in
B7(i) is equal to (−1)iβik and in B7( q+1
2
−i) is equal to (−1)
q+1
2 −iβ( q+1
2 −i)k =
(−1)
q+1
2 (−1)k(−1)iβik = (−1)iβik, since, k and 1
2(q + 1) are odd. Therefore, the
canonical images of these classes coincide in PSp(4, q). Thus, in PSp(4, q), we have
1
4(q −1) classes ¯B7(i) with the size q3(q −1)(q4 −1), where i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −1).
b) If q = 4k+3, then all of the classes B7(i) are distinguished by some of the above
mentioned irreducible characters.
For example, according to (a), the values of
ξ′
21(k) in B7(i) and B7( q+1
7 −i) are (−1)iβik and −(−1)iβik respectively. Therefore,
there are 1
2(q −1) classes ¯B7(i) with the size 1
2q3(q −1)(q4 −1) in PSp(4, q).
3-2.9
Collection of classes B9
By the similar argument of B7(i), if we consider the character table of Sp(4, q), we
can see that for any i ∈T1 the classes B9(i) and B9( q−1
2 −i) have the same values in
all of the corresponding irreducible characters of Sp(4, q), so their canonical image
coincide in PSp(4, q). Therefore,
a) If q = 4k + 1, then we obtain 1
4(q −5 classes ¯B9(i); i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −5) with
the size q3(q + 1)(q4 −1), and one class ¯B9( q−1
4 ) with the size 1
2q3(q + 1)(q4 −1) in
PSp(4, q).
b) If q = 4k + 3, then in PSp(4, q) we have q−3
2
classes ¯B9(i); i = 1, 2, ..., 1
4(q −3)
with the size q3(q + 1)(q4 −1).
3-3
Collection of the classes C and C′
By [3], it is easy to see that for any classes C1(i), i ∈T2 of the collection C1,
the classes −C1(i) are classes C′
1(j), j ∈T2 of the collection C′
1, where i and
j are not necessarily equal.
Therefore, the canonical images of the elements of
these collection of classes are merged pair wise in PSp(4, q). Therefore, from these
collection of classes, we obtain q−1
2
classes ¯C1(i), i ∈T2 with the size q3(q−1)(q2+1)
in PSp(4, q).
By the similar argument we also see that, there are the following collection of
classes classes in PSp(4, q):
{ ¯C21(i) : i ∈T2} ;
| ¯C21(i)| = q3(q −1)(q4 −1)/2
{ ¯C22(i) : i ∈T2} ;
| ¯C22(i)| = q3(q −1)(q4 −1)/2
{ ¯C3(i) : i ∈T2} ;
| ¯C3(i)| = q3(q + 1)(q2 + 1)/2
{ ¯C41(i) : i ∈T2} ;
| ¯C41(i)| = q3(q + 1)(q4 −1)/2
{ ¯C41(i) : i ∈T2} ;
| ¯C41(i)| = q3(q + 1)(q4 −1)/2
3-4
The classes D
By [3], we can see that additive inverse of each element of D1 is in D1. For, the

THE CHARACTERS OF PSp(4, q)

representative of D1 in Sp(4, q) is Diag(1, 1, −1, −1), and ED1E = −D1, where
E =

Again, by considering the character table and the conjugacy classes of Sp(4, q),
in [3], one can see that, the elements of the pair of the classes (D21, D23) and
(D22, D24) are additive inverse of each other. The irreducible characters of Sp(4, q)
corresponding to the irreducible characters of PSp(4, q), have equal values in D32
and D33, but on the classes D31 and D34 these characters are distinct.
(The
diﬀerences are in the ϵ and ϵ′ which occurs in the values of some characters. )
Therefore, the following classes also must be added to the conjugacy classes of
PSp(4, q) :
¯D1 with the size 1
2q2(q2 + 1), ¯D21 with the size 1
2q2(q4 −1), ¯D22 with the size
1
2q2(q4−1), ¯D31 with the size 1
8q2(q2−1)(q4−1), ¯D32 with the size 1
4q2(q2−1)(q4−1)
and ¯D34 with the size 1
8q2(q2 −1)(q4 −1).

Table of conjugacy classes and characters
Now by summarizing the above discussion, we can state the following theorems.
Theorem 4.1 Tables with numbers 1 and 2 state the conjugacy classes of PSp(4, q)
with their sizes for, q = 4k + 1 and q = 4k + 3 respectively.
Like [3] in the ﬁrst column of these tables, we have given as class representatives
not necessarily elements of PSp(4, q), but their canonical forms in an extension
ﬁled of GF(q), and also we use A rather than A{I, −I} .
Theorem 4.2 Tables with numbers 3 and 4 state the character table of PSp(4, q)
for, q = 4k + 1 and q = 4k + 3 respectively.
In the tables 3 and 4 the values of the characters at classes ¯A22, ¯A42, ¯C22(i),
¯C42(i), ¯D22, ¯D34,are omitted, since they can be obtained from the values at ¯A21, ¯A41,
¯C21(i), ¯C41(i), ¯D21, ¯D31 by replacing ˜ϵ by ˜ϵ′ and ˜ϵ′ by ˜ϵ respectively.
It is suﬃcient to give the values of one character from the pair {ξ21(k), ξ22(k)}. For,
the values of the others are then obtained by replacing ˜ϵ by ˜ϵ′ and ˜ϵ′ by ˜ϵ. A simi-
lar statement holds for the pairs {ξ′
21(k), ξ′
22(k)}, {ξ41(k), ξ42(k)}, {ξ′
41(k), ξ′
42(k)},
{Φ1Φ2}, {Φ3Φ4}, {Φ5Φ6}, {Φ7Φ8}, {θ1θ2}, and {θ3θ4}. The absence of entry in
the table indicates that the corresponding value is zero. In some cases it is the
negative of a character that is irreducible, and this will not be mentioned explicitly
in the tables.

Appendix
This appendix contains the conjugacy classes and the character table of Sp(4, q) for
odd q, given by B. Srinivasan [3]. In 1982 A. Przygocki found some small mistakes
(See [2]), then F. Luebeck in CHEVIE made some corrections to Przygocki’s ver-
sion. Now by using these corrections and the corrections provided us by Professor
B. Srinivasan , we state the conjugacy classes and the character table of Sp(4, q),
in the tables 5 and 6 .

Abstract
Let A be a ﬁnite group acting coprimely on a ﬁnite group G.
It was recently
discovered that the exponent of CG(A) may have strong impact over the exponent
of G. In this paper we discuss results on the exponent of a group with coprime
automorphisms, as well as some applications and open problems. No detailed proofs
are given.

Introduction
Let A be a ﬁnite group acting coprimely on a ﬁnite group G. It is well-known that
the structure of the centralizer CG(A) (the ﬁxed-point subgroup) of A has strong
inﬂuence over the structure of G.
To exemplify this we mention the following
results.
The celebrated theorem of Thompson [27] says that if A is of prime order and
CG(A) = 1, then G is nilpotent. On the other hand, any nilpotent group admitting
a ﬁxed-point-free automorphism of prime order q has nilpotency class bounded by
some function h(q) depending on q alone. This result is due to Higman [13]. The
reader can ﬁnd in [15] and [16] an account on the modern developments related to
Higman’s theorem. The next result is a consequence of the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite
simple groups [29]: If A is a group of automorphisms of G whose order is coprime
to that of G and CG(A) is nilpotent or has odd order, then G is soluble.
Once the group G is known to be soluble, there is a wealth of results bounding
the Fitting height of G in terms of the order of A and the Fitting height of CG(A).
The proofs of those results mostly use representation theory in the spirit of the
Hall-Higman work [8].
A general discussion of these methods and their use in
numerous ﬁxed-point theorems can be found in Turull [28].
It was recently discovered that the exponent of CG(A) may have strong impact
over the exponent of G.
In this paper we discuss the results on the exponent
of a group with coprime automorphisms, as well as some applications and open
problems. The proofs of results of this kind involve a number of deep ideas. In
particular, Zel’manov’s techniques that led to the solution of the restricted Burnside
problem [35] are combined with the Lubotzky-Mann theory of powerful p-groups
[20], Lazard’s criterion for a pro-p group to be p-adic analytic [19], and a theorem of
Bahturin and Zaicev on Lie algebras admitting an automorphism whose ﬁxed-point
subalgebra is PI [1]. In certain situations the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups
is required as well. No detailed proofs are presented in this survey. The interested

reader can ﬁnd the details in the original papers. Throughout the article we use
the term “{a, b, c . . .}-bounded” to mean “bounded from above by some function
depending only on the parameters a, b, c . . .”.

The elementary abelian group of automorphisms
Let q be a prime, and let A be a non-cyclic group of order q2 acting on a ﬁnite group
G. It is well-known (see [6, Theorem 6.2.4, Theorem 5.3.16]) that if G is any group
of order prime to q then G =

CG(a); a ∈A#
, where A# = A \ {1}. If, moreover,
G is a p-group then we even have G =

a∈A# CG(a). Since A normalizes some Sylow
p-subgroup of G for any p dividing |G| ([6, Theorem 6.2.4]), it is immediate that
if |CG(a)| ≤n for any a ∈A# then |G| ≤nq+1 (we use that A has exactly q + 1
cyclic subgroups). How profound is the connection between the structure of G and
that of CG(a); a ∈A#? One can show that if CG(a) has rank at most r for any
a ∈A# then the rank of G is {q, r}-bounded (see for example [7]). It is known
that if CG(a) is nilpotent for each a ∈A# then G is metanilpotent [30]. In some
situations this result holds even if G is allowed to be inﬁnite periodic [21]. The
following theorem shows that the exponents of CG(a) have strong impact on that
of G [17].
Theorem 2.1 Suppose that A is a non-cyclic group of order q2 acting on a ﬁnite
group G of coprime order, and let m be such an integer that the exponents of the
centralizers CG(a) of the non-trivial elements a ∈A# divide m. Then the exponent
of G is {m, q}-bounded.
The proof of this theorem runs as follows.
Since A normalizes some Sylow p-subgroup of G for any p dividing |G|, it is
suﬃcient to deal with the case that G is p-group and m is a p-power. We may
also assume G to be generated by d elements for some d ≤q2, since every element
g ∈G is contained in an A-invariant subgroup of G with at most q2 generators.
Let L = Lp(G) be the Lie algebra over Fp, the ﬁeld with p elements, associated
with the Lazard series of G (see [35]). The algebra L is generated by the subspace
L1 = G/Φ(G) of dimension d. We extend the ground ﬁeld of L by a primitive
qth root of unity ω, forming L = L ⊗Fp[ω]. It is clear that L is generated by
L1 = L1 ⊗Fp[ω]. The group A acts naturally on L and it is easy to see that L1 is
invariant under the action. Since A is abelian and the ground ﬁeld is now a splitting
ﬁeld for A, the space L1 decomposes into a direct sum of common eigenspaces for
A. So L1 is spanned by d common eigenvectors for A. Hence L is generated by d
common eigenvectors for A that belong to L1. With some work it can be shown
that any Lie-product of the eigenvectors is ad-nilpotent in L of {q, m}-bounded
index.
Choose a ∈A#. Since the exponent of the centralizer CG(a) of a divides m, it
follows that the identity

SHUMYATSKY
is satisﬁed in CL(a) ⊗Fp[ω] = CL(a). So the Bahturin-Zaicev theorem [1] now
says that L satisﬁes some polynomial identity which depends only on m and q.
Combined with the fact that any Lie-product of the eigenvectors is ad-nilpotent of
{q, m}-bounded index in L, this enables us to use a deep theorem of Zel’manov [35,
III(0.4)] and to conclude that L (hence L) is nilpotent of {q, m}-bounded class.
Nilpotency of Lp(G), with any given class, almost always has strong impact on
the group G. In particular, in our situation it follows that G contains a charac-
teristic powerful subgroup H of {q, m}-bounded index. Powerful p-groups were
introduced by Lubotzky and Mann in [20]: a ﬁnite p-group G is powerful if and
only if Gp ≥[G, G] for p ̸= 2 (or G4 ≥[G, G] for p = 2). Powerful p-groups have
many nice linear properties, of which we need the following: if a powerful p-group
G is generated by elements of order dividing m, then the exponent of G divides m
too (see [5, Lemma 2.2.5]). Combining this with the fact that H =

a∈A# CH(a), we
conclude that H is of exponent dividing m. This completes the proof of Theorem
2.1.
Let us now assume that A is elementary abelian of order qs with s ≥3. There
seems to hold a general principle: if a certain property of CG(a) for all a ∈A#
implies a similar property for the whole group G then the property of CG(a)′ for
all a ∈A# implies a similar property for G′ provided that the rank of A increases
by 1. The following three results (obtained in [7]) provide a good illustration for
this.
Theorem 2.2 Let m be an integer, q a prime. Let G be a ﬁnite q′-group acted
on by an elementary abelian group A of order q3. Assume that CG(a) has derived
group of order at most m for each a ∈A#. Then the order of G′ is {m, q}-bounded.
Theorem 2.3 Let m be an integer, q a prime. Let G be a ﬁnite q′-group acted
on by an elementary abelian group A of order q3. Assume that CG(a) has derived
group of rank at most m for each a ∈A#. Then the rank of G′ is {m, q}-bounded.
Theorem 2.4 Let m be an integer, q a prime. Let G be a ﬁnite q′-group acted
on by an elementary abelian group A of order q3. Assume that CG(a) has derived
group of exponent dividing m for each a ∈A#. Then the exponent of G′ is {m, q}-
bounded.
Each of the above theorems fails if |A| = q2.
Indeed, let G be a ﬁnite q′-
group admitting a non-cyclic automorphism group A of order q2 such that CG(a)
is abelian for each a ∈A#. Ward showed that G is necessarily soluble [32]. The
author proved that if G has derived length k then G′ is nilpotent of class bounded
by some function of q and k [21]. However the derived length k can be arbitrarily
large.
For instance, for any odd prime p Khukhro constructed a p-group G of
derived length bigger than log2(p −1) acted on by a four-group A such that CG(a)
is abelian for each a ∈A# [15, p. 149–150]. Thus Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.4
fail in the case |A| = q2. Direct products of such groups show that in this case
G′ can have arbitrarily large rank. So the assumption that |A| = q3 is essential in
each of the above theorems.

Recall that the proof of Theorem 2.1 reduces very easily to the case that G is a
p-group. This is no longer true for the three above theorems which reduce to the
case of p-groups using the following result.
Theorem 2.5 Let q be a prime. Let G be a ﬁnite q′-group acted on by an elemen-
tary abelian group A of order q3. Let P be an A-invariant Sylow subgroup of G.
Then P ∩G′ = ⟨P ∩CG(a)′|a ∈A#⟩.
The proof of Theorem 2.5 involves the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups. The
fact that is used is that any group of coprime automorphisms of a ﬁnite simple
group is cyclic.
Undoubtedly, Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.4 admit a common
generalization. In particular, it is hoped that the following conjecture could be
conﬁrmed along the lines of the work [7] using an appropriate analogue of Theorem
2.5.
Conjecture 2.6 Let A be an elementary abelian group of order qs with s ≥2
acting on a ﬁnite q′-group G.
1. If γs−1(CG(a)) has exponent dividing m for any a ∈A#, then γs−1(G) has
{m, q, s}-bounded exponent;
2. If, for some integer d such that 2d ≤s −1, the dth derived group of CG(a)
has exponent dividing m for any a ∈A#, then the dth derived group G(d)
has {m, q, s}-bounded exponent.
Perhaps it is somehow possible to strengthen Theorem 2.4 without enlarging the
rank of A. Let us see what can be expected in the case that A is of order q3 and
the hypothesis on CG(a) is weaker than that in Theorem 2.4. Ward showed that if
CG(a) is nilpotent for any a ∈A#, then the group G is nilpotent [31]. Recently the
author of the present paper found that there exists a function f = f(c, q) depending
only on c and q such that if, under the assumptions of Ward’s theorem, CG(a) is
nilpotent of class at most c for any a ∈A#, then the nilpotency class of G does
not exceed f, that is the nilpotency class of G is {c, q}-bounded [24]. So we have
certain grounds for suggesting the following, probably very risky, conjecture.
Conjecture 2.7 Let A be an elementary abelian group of order q3, and let f =
f(c, q) be the same function as above. Given positive integers c, m, assume A acts
on a ﬁnite q′-group G in such a way that γc+1(CG(a)) has exponent dividing m for
any a ∈A#. Then γf+1(G) has {c, m, q}-bounded exponent.
Theorem 2.1 has a number of interesting applications to proﬁnite and locally
ﬁnite groups. These will be discussed in the next two sections.

On the structure of periodic compact groups
Zel’manov proved that any periodic pro-p group is locally ﬁnite [34]. Combined
with the results of Wilson [33], this implies that any periodic compact group is
locally ﬁnite. A long-standing problem is whether any periodic compact group has

532
SHUMYATSKY
ﬁnite exponent. Theorem 2.1 is an indispensable ingredient in the proof of the
following theorem [23].
Theorem 3.1 Assume that a periodic compact group G contains an abelian sub-
group A whose centralizer in G is ﬁnite. Then G is of ﬁnite exponent.
The following result of Hartley is used in the proof of Theorem 3.1 (see [18] for
the proof of Hartley’s result).
Theorem 3.2 Assume that a ﬁnite group G is acted on by a nilpotent group A
with CG(A) = 1. Then G is soluble.
An immediate corollary of the above theorem is that if, under the hypothesis of
Theorem 3.2, N is any A-invariant normal subgroup of G then CG/N(A) = 1. This
is because A is a Carter subgroup of GA and so its image is Carter in any quotient
of GA.
Now assume the hypothesis of Theorem 3.1. Since CG(A) is ﬁnite, we can choose
a normal open subgroup H of G such that H ∩CG(A) = 1. By Theorem 3.2 H
is locally soluble. Of course, we use here that G is locally ﬁnite by the Wilson-
Zel’manov theorem. By the remark made after Theorem 3.2 CQ(A) = 1 for any
A-invariant section Q of H. A well-known result of Dade now tells us that if Q is
ﬁnite, then the Fitting height of Q is bounded by a function depending only on the
order of A [4] (obviously the hypothesis of the theorem implies that A is ﬁnite).
It follows that H has a ﬁnite series of characteristic closed subgroups, all of whose
quotients are locally nilpotent. Thus, we can assume that H is locally nilpotent.
Using a theorem of Herfort [12], the theorem can now be reduced to the case that
H is a p-subgroup of G and A is a p′-group. Arguing by induction on the order
of A we can assume that CH(B) has ﬁnite exponent for any proper subgroup B of
A. Then Theorem 2.1 shows that if G is a counter-example then A is cyclic. This
case has been handled in [23] by analyzing the structure of Lie algebras admitting
a ﬁxed-point-free automorphism of ﬁnite order.
It is worth mentioning that there is an interesting if implicit connection of results
obtained in [23] with another well-known problem. Namely, suppose a ﬁnite p-group
G admits a ﬁxed-point-free automorphism a of order n. Is the derived length of G
bounded by a function of n?
Slightly modifying some proofs in [23] one can obtain the following related result.
Theorem 3.3 Let G be a d-generated ﬁnite p-group admitting a ﬁxed-point-free
automorphism a of order n. Let b1, . . . , bs be the elements of prime order in ⟨a⟩.
Assume the exponent of CG(bi) divides m for all i ≤s. Then the derived length of
G is {d, m, n}-bounded.
Curiously, this somehow reminds the restricted Burnside problem.

On centralizers in locally ﬁnite groups
The study of centralizers is a well-established direction in the theory of locally ﬁnite
groups [10]. The idea is that if a locally ﬁnite group G contains a ﬁnite subgroup A

EXPONENT OF FINITE GROUPS WITH AUTOMORPHISMS
533
(or, equivalently, admits a ﬁnite group of automorphisms A) with CG(A) satisfying
certain conditions then the structure of G must be very special, usually close to
that of a nilpotent or soluble group. The following theorem was obtained in [25].
Theorem 4.1 Let G be a locally ﬁnite group containing a ﬁnite p-subgroup A such
that CG(A) is ﬁnite and a non-cyclic subgroup B of order p2 such that CG(b) has
ﬁnite exponent for all b ∈B#. Then G is almost locally soluble and has ﬁnite
exponent.
A group is said to almost have certain property if it contains a subgroup of ﬁnite
index with that property. The proof of the above theorem uses Theorem 2.1 as well
as the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups and the classiﬁcation of simple periodic
linear groups [2, 3, 9, 26]. The next theorem on automorphisms of ﬁnite groups is
especially helpful (its proof depends on the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups).
Theorem 4.2 Let A be a ﬁnite p-group acting on a ﬁnite group G of exponent e.
Assume |CG(A)| ≤m. Then |G : S(G)| is {|A|, e, m}-bounded.
Here S(G) denotes the soluble radical of the group G. This is the product of all
normal soluble subgroups or, equivalently, the maximal normal soluble subgroup of
G. It is a deep result of Hartley that if, under the hypothesis of Theorem 4.2, A is
cyclic, then the bound on |G : S(G)| does not depend on e (but of course depends
on |A| and m) [11]. Examples of ﬁnite simple groups having a self-centralizing four-
subgroup [6] show that if A is not cyclic the bound cannot be taken independent
of e.
It would be interesting to see what happens to Theorem 4.1 if the assumption
that CG(A) is ﬁnite is dropped. More precisely, what can be said about a locally
ﬁnite group G containing a non-cyclic subgroup B of order p2 such that CG(b) has
ﬁnite exponent for all b ∈B#? Perhaps the study of this question can be started
along the lines of the following conjecture.
Conjecture 4.3 Suppose a locally ﬁnite group G contains a non-cyclic subgroup
B of order p2 such that CG(b) has ﬁnite exponent for all b ∈B#. Then G possesses
a ﬁnite series of normal subgroups G = G1 ≥G2 ≥. . . ≥Gs = 1 all of whose
quotients are either p-groups or groups of ﬁnite exponent.
One may wonder whether Theorem 2.4 is relevant to the study of centralizers in
locally ﬁnite groups. In particular, the following conjecture looks plausible.
Conjecture 4.4 Let G be a locally ﬁnite group containing a ﬁnite p-subgroup A
such that CG(A) is ﬁnite and an elementary abelian subgroup B of order p3 such
that CG(b)′ has ﬁnite exponent for all b ∈B#. Then G is almost locally soluble
and G′ has ﬁnite exponent.
5
Exponent of a group with a single automorphism
It is easy to see that the exponent of the centralizer of a single automorphism a of a
ﬁnite group G has no impact over the exponent of G. Indeed, any abelian group of

534
SHUMYATSKY
odd order admits a ﬁxed-point-free automorphism of order two. Hence, we cannot
bound the exponent of G solely in terms of the exponent of CG(a). Thus we have
to make assumptions on orders of certain elements outside CG(a). It is well-known
that if G is a group of odd order admitting an involutory automorphism a then G
is generated by a-invariant cyclic subgroups. Hence, if G is abelian and the order
of any a-invariant cyclic subgroup divides a given number m then the exponent of
G is a divisor of m, too. The next theorem, proved in [22], shows that this can be
generalized as follows.
Theorem 5.1 Let m be a positive integer, G a ﬁnite group of odd order admitting
an involutory automorphism a such that any a-invariant cyclic subgroup of G is of
order dividing m. Then the exponent of G is bounded in terms of m.
The general scheme of the proof of Theorem 5.1 is similar to that of Theorem
2.1.
Assume now that the ﬁnite group G admits a coprime automorphism a of order
n. If n ≥3 the group G need not be generated by a-invariant cyclic subgroups. So
even if G is abelian the orders of a-invariant cyclic subgroups do not have much
eﬀect on the exponent of G.
Hence, the next theorem is, in a sense, the best
possible generalization of Theorem 5.1 to the case n ≥3.
Theorem 5.2 Let m be a positive integer, G a ﬁnite group admitting a coprime
automorphism a of order n. Assume that any a-invariant (n−1)-generated subgroup
of G is of exponent dividing m. Then the exponent of G is {m, n}-bounded.
On the other hand, if we slightly modify the language of the discussion, we
will see that Theorem 5.2 can be somewhat strengthened. Given a group G with
an automorphism a, set G−a = {x−1xa; x ∈G} and Ga = CG(a). Obviously,
Theorem 5.1 is equivalent to the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3 Let m be a positive integer, G a ﬁnite group of odd order admitting
an involutory automorphism a such that any element of Ga∪G−a is of order dividing
m. Then the exponent of G is bounded in terms of m.
It would be interesting to see whether this can be extended to the case of auto-
morphisms of order greater than two.
Problem 5.4 Let m be a positive integer, G a ﬁnite group admitting a coprime
automorphism a of order n. Assume that any element of Ga ∪G−a is of order
dividing m. Is then the exponent of G bounded in terms of m and n alone?
The next two results give partial positive answers to the above problem. Note
that Theorem 5.5 strengthens Theorem 5.2.
Theorem 5.5 Let m be a positive integer, G a ﬁnite group admitting a coprime
automorphism a of order n. Assume that any element of Ga ∪G−a is contained
in an a-invariant subgroup of exponent dividing m. Then the exponent of G is
{m, n}-bounded.

EXPONENT OF FINITE GROUPS WITH AUTOMORPHISMS
535
Theorem 5.6 Let m be a positive integer, G a ﬁnite group admitting a coprime
automorphism a of order n and a ﬁxed-point-free automorphism b of order k. As-
sume that any element of Ga ∪G−a is of order dividing m. If a and b commute,
then the exponent of G is {k, m, n}-bounded.
Hopefully, the proofs of Theorems 5.2, 5.5, 5.6 will be published in a separate
paper.

CLASSIFYING IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS
IN CHARACTERISTIC ZERO

Abstract
We discuss techniques which allow us to classify the representations of some ﬁnite
groups over non-algebraically closed ﬁelds of characteristic zero. We propose the
use of Cliﬀord classes as a convenient and eﬀective way to describe and calculate our
answers. Furthermore, we argue for the use of global, rather than local, calculations
for the classical groups.

Introduction
Given a ﬁnite group G and a ﬁeld F in characteristic zero, a basic problem is to
understand the representations of G as automorphisms of ﬁnite dimensional vector
spaces over F.
Maschke’s Theorem allows us to concentrate on the irreducible
representations of G. The use of characters is a convenient and useful way to work
with isomorphism classes of representations.
However, the computation of the
isomorphism types of irreducible representations is often diﬃcult. This problem
amounts to the calculation of the Schur index mF (χ) for each complex irreducible
character χ ∈Irr(G).
Richard Brauer contributed two important tools for the solution of these prob-
lems. First, instead of calculating the Schur indices of χ over F, for all F, one
can now calculate an element of the Brauer group [χ] over a suitable ﬁeld, and one
deduces from it all the Schur indices of χ for all ﬁelds F. Second, his Character-
ization of Characters Theorem, and related ideas, show that one could calculate
Schur indices by understanding the restriction of the character to certain solvable
subgroups, and the Schur indices of the irreducible characters of these solvable
subgroups.
Since the beginning of character theory, there has been a rightful emphasis on
the characters of the classical groups. Thanks to work of Frobenius, Schur, and
more recent results of Deligne and Lusztig and many others, we know quite a lot
about the irreducible characters of many classical groups. We know far less about
the Schur indices of these characters. In this paper, I want to discuss some new
techniques that have allowed recent progress in the calculation of Schur indices in
general, and in the calculation of Schur indices of speciﬁc families of classical groups
in particular. These techniques should also prove useful to eﬀectively investigate
further classical groups.
When trying to calculate the Schur indices of the irreducible characters of groups
such as the classical groups, one can go beyond the two fundamental contributions

of Richard Brauer mentioned above in the following ways. The ﬁrst way is suggested
by the fact that many classical groups have normal subgroups which are also of
interest. Classical groups often appear within a pair of groups G and N, where G
is a ﬁnite group and N is a normal subgroup of G, and all the groups between G
and N are of interest. Often N is quasi-simple, and G/N is uncomplicated, often
cyclic. The irreducible characters of all these groups are related by Cliﬀord theory,
and such relation is used eﬀectively when describing the characters systematically,
see for example [1]. We show that we can deﬁne a generalization of the Brauer
group of a ﬁeld, which we call the set of Cliﬀord classes Clif(G/N, F) of G/N over
F. The elements of this set allow us to eﬀectively work with all the characters of
all these groups which are related by Cliﬀord theory at once. Hence, in the same
way that the calculation of [χ] allows one to know the Schur indices of χ over every
ﬁeld F, the calculation of [[χ]] ∈Clif(G/N, K) allows us to get all the Schur indices
of χ and all the characters related to it by Cliﬀord theory over every ﬁeld.
If Brauer’s ﬁrst contribution mentioned above suggested the deﬁnition and use
of the Cliﬀord set Clif(G/N, F) to describe the Schur indices of large families of
characters over all ﬁelds, new information about classical groups suggests that we
need to supplement his second. Indeed, all indications are that Schur indices of
quasi-simple groups are substantially less complicated that Schur indices of solv-
able groups. For example, all Schur indices of quasi-simple groups that have been
calculated are at most 2, whereas the Schur indices of solvable groups can be any
positive integer. Hence, a classiﬁcation of the representations of the classical groups
over ﬁelds of characteristic zero can not be expected to rely solely on restrictions
of characters to solvable subgroups.
Indeed, the situation may be analogous to the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple
groups, where, Sylow’s Theorem not withstanding, one wants to avoid relying of
the detailed structure of the p-groups, because their structure is far more intricate
than that of the simple groups. Here, we propose to try to work as much as possi-
ble with the whole group. We suggest some global and some descent methods, that
allow us to calculate, starting from information over a larger ﬁeld, information over
smaller ones.
In this paper, we being with a review of the standard deﬁnitions and results
that allows us to treat all F at once. We then discuss the more recent method of
Cliﬀord classes, that allows us to treat certain sets of related groups G together.
We then discuss some methods to calculate the relevant invariants that rely on
global techniques. Finally, we review brieﬂy some results that can be obtained
about the classical groups using these techniques.

Roughly speaking, given G, we can treat all the ﬁelds F at once using the
following. (See Section 2, below for more details). First calculate the character
table for G, in other words, solve the problem for F = C. Next, for each χ ∈Irr(G),
calculate its ﬁeld of values Q(χ), and an element [χ] ∈Br(Q(χ)), in the Brauer
group of Q(χ).
Then, given any ﬁeld F contained in C, the characters of the
irreducible modules of G over F are exactly those obtained as follows. Take any

539
χ ∈Irr(G), we then obtain from χ a unique character χ aﬀorded by some irreducible
module for G over F. Let χ = χ1, . . . , χn be the distinct Galois conjugates of χ
over F. Let [χ]F be the projection of [χ] to an element of Br(F(χ)), and let m
be the order of [χ]F (m = mF (χ) is called the Schur index of χ over F). Then,
χ = m (χ1 + · · · + χn). The χ depend only on the Galois conjugacy class of χ,
diﬀerent Galois conjugacy classes correspond to diﬀerent irreducible representations
of G over F, and all irreducible representations of G over F aﬀord some χ as
character. Hence, using some Galois theory and some knowledge of Brauer groups,
we can reduce our computations to calculating Irr(G), and, for each χ ∈Irr(G), to
calculating [χ] ∈Br(Q(χ)). However, neither calculation is easy in general.
When G is not simple, and it has some proper non-trivial normal subgroup N,
one can use information about N and G/N to calculate the irreducible modules
for G. Over algebraically closed ﬁelds, traditional Cliﬀord Theory describes how to
do this. Over non-algebraically closed ﬁelds F, there are additional diﬃculties, in
part arising from the fact that an irreducible character of a subgroup that induces
up to an irreducible character of G may have a larger ﬁeld of values than the ﬁeld
of values of the character it induces to.
In the present paper, I want to argue that the problem of describing the irre-
ducible representations of G over a ﬁeld F of characteristic zero, in the presence
of a normal subgroup N, can proﬁtably be split into a number of distinct prob-
lems. I will give a brief overview of how the solution of all these solve the problem.
Furthermore, I will describe some of the results I have obtained recently about the
various components of the problem. In addition, I will discuss how this new method
has already successfully helped solve the problem of ﬁnding all the representations
of G over any ﬁeld F of characteristic zero for some families of classical groups.
Suppose G has a non-trivial proper normal subgroup N. Let χ ∈Irr(G), and let
ψ ∈Irr(N) be contained in the restriction of χ to N. Cliﬀord theory teaches us
that there are a number of characters of G and its subgroups that contain N that
are closely related to χ and should be studied together with χ. Our strategy is to
deﬁne a set Clif(G/N, F), which has a natural deﬁnition analogous to that of the
Brauer group, and whose elements encapsulate how to go from ψ to each of these
characters. Thus, to each χ ∈Irr(G) is associated an element [[χ]] ∈Clif(G/N, F),
which depends only on ψ, and which controls all these characters.
In this way, the problem of describing all the irreducible representations of G
over a ﬁeld F in characteristic zero, when N is a normal subgroup of G, and we
have Irr(N), can be split into three distinct problems. The ﬁrst two involving only
the group G/N, and only the last one involving the embedding of N in G.
• First, we need to compute Clif(G/N, F).
• Second, we need to compute the Cliﬀord theory of G corresponding to each
element of Clif(G/N, F), i.e., given some element of Clif(G/N, F), this tells
us exactly how to parametrize all the relevant characters, their Schur indices,
etc., and we want to make this as explicit as possible, and as easy to use as
possible.
• Third, and ﬁnally, for each ψ ∈Irr(N), we need to compute the corresponding
element of Clif(G/N, F) which, by our second step then solves our problem.

Many ﬁelds at once: Using the Brauer group
In this section, we review the deﬁnition of the Brauer group, and how it is used to
solve our problem for ﬁxed G and varying F. These classical results are the model
for our deﬁnition of Cliﬀord classes, and their use for our purposes. In fact, we can
view this section as the development we are arguing for in the case when G = N.
All deﬁnitions and results here are standard. See for example [9] for details and
proofs. Let F ⊆C be a ﬁeld. In this section, we assume that Irr(G) is available to
us.
2.1
First: Deﬁne and compute Br(F)
Deﬁnition 2.1 An algebra A over F is said to be simple if it has exactly two
two-sided ideals. It is said to be central if its center has dimension 1 over F. It
is said to be a full matrix algebra if there exists some ﬁnite dimensional F-vector
space M ̸= 0 such that A = EndF (M).
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Brauer group of F). If A and B are central simple algebras over
F, we say that A and B are equivalent if and only if there exist full matrix algebras
E and E′ such that
A ⊗E ≃B ⊗E′.
The elements of Br(F) are the equivalence classes of central simple algebras over
F. Multiplication in Br(F) is induced by the tensor product of algebras over F.
So if A and B are central simple algebras over F, denoting by [A] and [B] their
corresponding classes in Br(F), we have
[A][B] = [A ⊗B].
Remark 2.3 The number theory literature then discusses how to operate with
Br(F). Namely, it describes the elements of Br(F), its multiplication, and how
to compute the class [A] ∈Br(F) of some central simple algebra A over F. This
description is particularly eﬀective for many F’s of particular interest such as when
F is a local or global ﬁeld (e. g. Q, R, Qp and their ﬁnite extensions).
2.2
Second: Given [χ] ∈Br(Q(χ)), describe the representations
In this, the classical case, there is exactly one irreducible representation over F to be
described. Its character is obtained as follows. Extend the scalars of [χ] ∈Br(Q(χ))
to F(χ), and obtain an element [χ]F ∈Br(F(χ)). Let m be the order of [χ]F as
an element of the Brauer group. Then, the unique character of G aﬀorded by the
irreducible representation over F arising from χ ∈Irr(G) is
m (χ1 + · · · + χn) ,
where the χ1 = χ, . . . , χn are the distinct Galois conjugates of χ over F.

Third: For each χ ∈Irr(G), calculate [χ] ∈Br(Q(χ))
Let G be a ﬁnite group.
Let χ ∈Irr(G).
Then, we assign to χ the element
[χ] ∈Br(Q(χ)) as follows. We temporarily set K = Q(χ).
Theorem 2.4 There exist non-zero modules over K aﬀording as character a mul-
tiple of χ.
Let M be any one of them.
Then, EndKG(M) is a central simple
algebra over K. Furthermore, the class of EndKG(M) in Br(K) is independent of
the choice of M.
Deﬁnition 2.5 We deﬁne [χ] to be the class of EndKG(M) in Br(K), for any M
as in Theorem 2.4.
Theorem 2.4 guarantees that [χ] is well deﬁned for each χ ∈Irr(G). In this
approach, the calculation of the global [χ] becomes the focus. We discuss some
methods to explicitly calculate this invariant in Section 4.

Many groups at once: using Cliﬀord classes
In this section, we deﬁne Cliﬀord classes, and sketch their use in the solution of
our classiﬁcation of representations problem. Our basic set up is that we have a
ﬁeld F of characteristic zero, a ﬁnite group G, and a normal subgroup N of G.
We assume, furthermore, that Irr(N) is available to us. For each ψ ∈Irr(N), we
classify all the representations for each subgroup over any ﬁeld F of characteristic
zero lying above ψ.
We set ¯G = G/N. We deﬁne the set Clif( ¯G, F) of Cliﬀord classes, and we show
how this set can be used to describe all the representations of G over F. This set
was introduced in [9] for this purpose, but the name Cliﬀord classes was introduced
in [16].
3.1
First: Deﬁne and compute Clif( ¯G, F)
If algebras over F are the basic ingredients for the deﬁnition of the Brauer group, it
is ¯G-algebras over F that are the basic ingredients for the deﬁnition of the Cliﬀord
set of ¯G over F.
Deﬁnition 3.1 A ¯G-algebra A over F is said to be simple if it has exactly two
¯G-invariant two-sided ideals. It is said to be central if the centralizer of ¯G in the
center of of the algebra A has dimension 1 over F. It is said to be a trivial ¯G-algebra
if there exists some F ¯G-module M ̸= 0 such that A = EndF (M), with the natural
action of ¯G on A.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (Cliﬀord Classes of ¯G over F). If A and B are central simple ¯G-
algebras over F, we say that A and B are equivalent if and only if there exist trivial
¯G-algebras E and E′ such that
A ⊗E ≃B ⊗E′,

as ¯G-algebras. The elements of Clif( ¯G, F) are the equivalence classes of central
simple ¯G-algebras over F.
Remark 3.3 One diﬀerence with the ordinary Brauer group is that Clif( ¯G, F)
does not have a natural operation on it, and so it is simply a set.
The problem of characterizing the elements of Clif( ¯G, F) becomes more diﬃcult
as ¯G is more complicated.
Theorem 3.4 For ¯G = 1, Clif( ¯G, F) is simply the set of elements of Br(F).
This follows immediately from the deﬁnition. The case | ¯G| = 2 turns out to
be classical too. The elements of Clif(Z/2Z, F) are naturally identiﬁed with the
elements of the Brauer-Wall group of F, see for example [7] for a deﬁnition of the
Brauer-Wall group and a characterization of its elements.
Hence, the elements
of Clif(Z/2Z, F) are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of Br(F) ×
{0, 1}×F ×/(F ×)2. In [13], we obtain a more general result describing the elements
of Clif(Z/nZ, F) as follows:
Theorem 3.5 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and let G be a ﬁnite cyclic
group, with preferred generator g0. Given any triple [Z, α, b], where Z is a central
simple commutative G-algebra, α ∈F × and b ∈Br(F), we may construct (see
[13] Deﬁnition 2.6) a central simple G-algebra which we denote [Z, α, b]. Then,
for every central simple G-algebra A over F, there exists some [Z, α, b] which is
equivalent to A. In addition, two G-algebras [Z, α, b] and [Z0, α0, b0] are equivalent
if and only if both of the following hold:
1. Z ≃Z0 as G-algebras.
2. Setting I = CG(Z) = CG(Z0) and m = |I|, we have that αα−1
0
= βm for
some β ∈F × such that b = b0br(G/I, Z, β).
A central simple commutative ¯G-algebra Z can be thought of as a Galois exten-
sion of F whose Galois group is a quotient of ¯G. Furthermore, here, br(G/I, Z, β) ∈
Br(F) and b0br(G/I, Z, β) represents the product in the Brauer group Br(F). The
element br(G/I, Z, β) is constructed by a slight generalization of the usual crossed
product. It is easy to see that Theorem 3.5 implies the classical [7] characterization
of the elements of the Brauer-Wall group in the case ¯G = Z/2Z.
Further characterizations of the elements of Clif( ¯G, F) are obtained in [10, 11,
12], but the general problem remains open. The elements that correspond to char-
acters whose inertia group is all of G, however, are easily classiﬁed as follows, see
Corollary 5.4 in [11]. The relevant ¯G-algebras A are characterized by having a
one-dimensional center, Z(A) = F.
Theorem 3.6 Let ¯G be any group, and let F be any ﬁeld of characteristic zero.
Then, the equivalence classes of central simple ¯G-algebras whose center is one di-
mensional are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the elements of
H2( ¯G, F ×) × Br(F).

3.2
Second: Given [[χ]] ∈Clif( ¯G, F), describe the representations
If χ ∈Irr(G), we know that [[χ]] is suﬃcient to understand its Cliﬀord theory.
Indeed we have the following, see [9].
Theorem 3.7 Let χ ∈Irr(G), and let ψ ∈Irr(N) be contained in the restriction
of χ to N. Suppose we know [[χ]] ∈Clif( ¯G, F) (which in fact depends only on
ψ and the embedding of N in G, and not on χ itself). Then, we can use [[χ]]
to parametrize all the irreducible characters ζ of any subgroup of G that contains
N with the property that (ζN, χN)N > 0.
Furthermore, [[χ]] tells us, for each
parametrized character ζ, its relative degree ζ(1)/ψ(1), its corresponding element
[ζ] ∈Br(F(ζ)) (and hence the representations over all F), as well as the eﬀects
of restriction, induction, conjugation and even multiplication by any irreducible
character of G/N.
When ¯G is cyclic, we have an explicit and convenient description of the elements
of Clif( ¯G, F), see Theorem 3.5, above. This can be used to describe the relevant
characters and their properties explicitly. See [13] for details.
Theorem 3.8 Suppose ¯G is cyclic, and [[χ]] is the class of the ¯G-algebra [Z, α, b]
as in Theorem 3.5. Then, the parametrization and results of Theorem 3.7 can be
expressed explicitly and conveniently.
3.3
Third: For each χ ∈Irr(G), calculate [[χ]] ∈Clif(Q(χN))
Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let N be a normal subgroup of G. Let χ ∈Irr(G),
and let ψ ∈Irr(N) be contained in the restriction of χ to N. It is easy to see that
the ﬁeld of values of each character ζ as in Theorem 3.7 contains Q(χN), the ﬁeld
of values of the restriction of χ to N. We set ¯G = G/N and K = Q(χN). Then,
we assign to χ the element [[χ]] ∈Clif( ¯G, K) as follows, see [9].
Theorem 3.9 There exist non-zero modules over K aﬀording as character a char-
acter whose restriction to N is a multiple of the sum of the distinct G-conjugates
of ψ (or a rational multiple of χN). Let M be any one of them. Then, EndKN(M)
is a central simple ¯G- algebra over K. Furthermore, the class of EndKN(M) in
Clif( ¯G, K) is independent of the choice of M.
Deﬁnition 3.10 We deﬁne [[χ]] to be the class of EndKN(M) in Clif( ¯G, K), for
any M as in Theorem 3.9.
Theorem 3.9 guarantees that [[χ]] is well deﬁned for each χ ∈Irr(G), and fur-
thermore, it shows that [[χ]] depends only on the G-conjugacy class of ψ and not
on χ itself. It is convenient that this deﬁnition has no requirement that M be ir-
reducible. Indeed, if we were to assume that M is irreducible, then we would need
to know the structure of some irreducible module before starting our computation,
hence, we would need to know something about the Schur index of χ before cal-
culating [[χ]], which is certainly undesirable. Furthermore, this way the deﬁnition

544
TURULL
can easily be extended to be functorial with respect to extensions of the ground
ﬁeld.
In this approach, the calculation of the global [[χ]] becomes the focus. We discuss
some methods to explicitly calculate this invariant in Section 4.
4
Global methods
We have a multitude of solvable groups, but much fewer simple and almost simple
groups. Hence, the Classiﬁcation of Finite Simple group tries to avoid having to
deal directly with p-groups as much as possible, trying instead to work with large
subgroups of the unknown group instead.
Likewise, I think that to eﬀectively
classify the representations of the classical groups over all ﬁelds of characteristic
zero one needs to concentrate on large subgroups of the group in question. Brauer’s
Theorem implies that understanding all representations of the solvable subgroups
of the group and their embedding in the group should be enough to calculate
the Schur indices. However, the groups have a multitude of solvable subgroups,
and their Schur indices can be extremely complicated, making such an approach
impractical.
Indeed, my recent successes in eﬀectively calculating the Schur indices of all
the irreducible characters of some families of classical groups have ultimately been
based on some global reduction. The next result refers to the reduction obtained
in [8].
Theorem 4.1 Let λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λr and µ1 > µ2 > · · · > µs be strict partitions
of n1 and n2 respectively, and suppose that the union of the two partitions is a strict
partition of n = n1 + n2. Let [[λ]], [[µ]] ∈Clif(Z/2Z, Q) be the elements associated
via Deﬁnition 3.10 to the corresponding characters of the double covers of Sn1
and Sn2. Then, there is an eﬀective formula to calculate the element [[λ ∪µ]] ∈
Clif(Z/2Z, Q) corresponding to the character of the appropriate double cover of Sn.
As another example, we oﬀer the following from [14]. Further reﬁnements of this
result yield an even more explicit formula in certain cases, and this is the basis of
the calculation of the Schur indices of all the irreducible characters of the special
linear groups, see [15]. The next two results are examples of the descent method:
they provide the needed information over a smaller ﬁeld from properties of the
representation of the group over a larger ﬁeld.
Theorem 4.2 Let G be a ﬁnite group, χ ∈Irr(G) and F be a ﬁeld containing Q(χ).
Let U be a subgroup of G and θ ∈Irr(U) be such that θ(1) = 1 and (ResG
U(χ), θ) = 1.
Set K = F(θ) and set n = |Gal(K/F)|, and assume that Gal(K/F) = ⟨σ⟩is
cyclic. Assume that there exists a group H containing G as a normal subgroup,
and a character ˜χ ∈Irr(H) extending the character χ, such that F(˜χ) ∩K = F.
Assume, furthermore, that there is some element x ∈NH(U) such that, for all
u ∈U, θ(x−1ux) = σθ(u), and xn ∈U. Then, there exists some h in the coset
x−1G such that ˜χ(h) ̸= 0 and for each such h, we have
[χ] = br(K/F, σ, ˜χ(h)nθ(xn)).

CLASSIFYING IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS
545
If we are interested not only on the characters of the special linear group, but
on the characters of all the groups contained between the special linear groups and
the general linear groups, then the above theorem is not enough, because it only
calculates [χ] when what is needed is [[χ]]. In [16], we obtain some explicit global
results in view of obtaining what we need.
Theorem 4.3 Let H be a ﬁnite group, and let J be a normal subgroup of H such
that G = H/J is cyclic with generator g0. Let χ be an irreducible character of H,
and assume that F is a ﬁeld containing the values of ResH
J (χ). Then the Cliﬀord
class [[χ]] ∈Clif(F) is given by [Z, α, b] (see Theorem 3.5) as follows. Z and α0 are
easy to calculate, but we do not give the details here. Pick any β ∈F ×, we can then
set α = β|I|α0, and the corresponding b is calculated as follows. Set n = [H : I0]
and set γ to be an n-th root of βχ(j0) so that γn = βχ(j0). Take a ﬁnite Galois
extension L of F such that L ⊇F(γ) and L is a splitting ﬁeld for χ. Let M be a
module for H over L aﬀording χ. Then, the crossed product of L and S is a central
simple algebra over F, and b is simply its class in Br(F).
5
Applications to classical groups
There has been interest in the calculation of Schur indices for classical groups ever
since the important contributions of Schur himself.
Hence, we know the Schur
indices of the symmetric groups, the alternating groups, more generally the Weyl
groups. We also know the Schur indices of the sporadic simple groups, see [3, 4].
We also have a lot of partial information on the Schur indices of the groups of Lie
type, see the work of Gow [5, 6] and others.
The techniques discussed above allow us to go beyond these results, and obtain
complete classiﬁcations of the representations over every ﬁeld in some new cases.
In [8], we handle the case of the double covers of the symmetric and alternating
groups completely. Similar techniques [2] handle all the irreducible characters of
all the double covers of the Weyl groups of type Bn. In [15], we calculate the Schur
index for each irreducible character of any special linear group. I intend to calculate
explicitly the Schur index of every irreducible character of every group contained
between the general linear group and the special linear group in a forthcoming
paper.
We still do not have complete classiﬁcations for the irreducible characters of
the other classical families. Hopefully, some extension of the ideas presented here
should prove useful to solve these problems as well.

Abstract
This article is based on four lectures I gave at “Groups St. Andrews” in Oxford in
August 2001. The lectures were intended as a survey of some applications of Lie
algebra techniques to group theory, and much of the material presented here has
appeared elsewhere. But the application of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula
to Burnside groups is new.
1
The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula
The connection between groups and Lie algebras is most clearly illustrated by the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula. We show how the formula gives an isomor-
phism between the category of nilpotent Lie algebras over Q and the category of
torsion free divisible nilpotent groups. We also indicate how the formula might
be used to investigate ﬁnite p-groups. Finally, we give a new application of the
formula to the the computation of Burnside groups of prime exponent.
Let A be the free associative algebra with unity over the rationals Q which is
freely generated by non-commuting indeterminates x, y. We extend A to the ring
A of formal power series consisting of the formal sums

un,
where un is a homogeneous element of weight n in A. If a ∈A, and if the homo-
geneous component of a of weight 0 is 0, then we deﬁne
ea = 1 + a + a2
2! + a3
3! + . . .
in the usual way. The product exey ∈A can be expressed in the form 1 + u for
some u ∈A, and
exey = ev
where
v =

The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula (see, for example, Jacobson [13]) enables
us to compute the homogeneous components of v. The ﬁrst few components are
given below.

One important (and surprising) feature of this expression is that the homogeneous
components of v are all Lie elements of A (that is elements in the Lie subalgebra of
A generated by x and y with respect to the Lie product [a, b] = ab −ba). A proof
of this may be found in [32]. A similar formula holds for commutators:
[ey, ex] = ew,
where
w = [y, x] + 1
2[y, x, x] + 1
2[y, x, y] + 1
6[y, x, x, x] + 1
4[y, x, x, y] + 1
6[y, x, y, y] + . . . .
(Here [ey,ex] is the group commutator e−ye−xeyex, and w is an inﬁnite sum of Lie
elements in A.)
These formulae sometimes enable us to deﬁne a group structure on a Lie algebra.
Perhaps the simplest situation where this applies is when L is a nilpotent Lie algebra
over the rationals Q. (See [1].) We write the element v above as
v = v1 + v2 + . . . ,
where vi is a homogeneous Lie element of weight i, for i = 1, 2, . . ., and we consider
the truncated expression
v(x, y) = v1 + v2 + . . . + vc,
where c is the class of L. If a, b ∈L, then v(a, b) can be interpreted as an element
of L. We deﬁne an operation “◦” on L by setting
a ◦b = v(a, b),
for a, b ∈L. With this operation, ⟨L, ◦⟩is a torsion free nilpotent group (of class
c). Furthermore ⟨L, ◦⟩is divisible, which is to say that for every a ∈L and every
non-zero integer n there is an element b ∈L such that bn = a. Every torsion

free divisible nilpotent group arises in this way, and this connection provides an
isomorphism between the category of nilpotent Lie algebras over Q and the category
of torsion free divisible nilpotent groups. This isomorphism is known as the Mal’cev
correspondence.
The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula also provides a connection between ﬁnite
p-groups and nilpotent Lie rings (over Z) of prime power order, in the case when
the groups and Lie rings are nilpotent of class at most p −1. This is because if
n < p then the denominators of the coeﬃcients that occur in the homogeneous
component vn of v of weight n are coprime to p. We let v(x, y) be the truncated
expression
v(x, y) = v1 + v2 + . . . + vp−1.
If L is a Lie ring of order pn (so that L has characteristic pk for some k), and if L
is nilpotent of class at most p −1, then we can deﬁne a group operation “◦” on L
by setting
a ◦b = v(a, b) for a, b ∈L.
This turns L into a group of order pn, and every ﬁnite p-group of class at most p−1
arises in this way from a ﬁnite Lie ring. This appears as an exercise in Bourbaki
[2], Chapter 2, and is known as the Lazard correspondence.
One possible application of this is to the classiﬁcation of groups of order pn for
small n. Groups of order pn have class at most n −1, and so for p ≥n we can
classify groups of order pn by classifying nilpotent Lie rings of order pn.
Consider the case n = 3. The classiﬁcation of groups of order p3 is hardly a
diﬃcult problem, but I believe that it is even easier if we look at Lie rings. Clearly
the problem of classifying abelian Lie rings of any given order is precisely the same
as the problem of classifying abelian groups of that order.
So consider a non-
abelian nilpotent Lie ring L of order p3. Clearly L will be nilpotent of class 2, with
L/L2 of order p2 and L2 of order p. So L will be generated by two elements a, b
(say), L2 will be spanned by [b, a], and [b, a] will be central. Clearly p[b, a] = 0,
and pa = λ[b, a], pb = µ[b, a] for some λ, µ. So L is completely determined by the
values of λ, µ, which we may view as elements of the ﬁeld Zp.
One possibility is λ = µ = 0. On the other hand, if λ and µ are not both zero
then (interchanging a and b if necessary) we may assume that λ ̸= 0. Then, if we
replace b by λb −µa, we have pa = [b, a], pb = 0. So there are two possibilities for
L.
A slightly less trivial example is the case of groups of order p4 and class 3. Let
L be a Lie ring of order p4 which is nilpotent of class 3. Then we have |L/L2| =
p2, |L2/L3| = |L3| = p. Clearly the centralizer of L2 has index p in L, and we
choose generators a, b for L such that b centralizes L2. So L is spanned by a, b,
[b, a], [b, a, a]. And [b, a, b] = 0. Clearly [b, a, a] has order p, and pa, pb ∈L2. So
p[b, a] = [b, pa] = 0 since b centralizes L2. Let pa = λ[b, a] + µ[b, a, a], where we can
view λ, µ as elements of the ﬁeld Zp. Then
0 = p[a, a] = [pa, a] = λ[b, a, a],

550
VAUGHAN-LEE
and so λ = 0, and pa ∈L3. Similarly, since
0 = p[b, a] = [pb, a],
we see that pb ∈L3. Let pa = µ[b, a, a], pb = ν[b, a, a].
One possibility is that µ = ν = 0.
If µ ̸= 0, but ν = 0 we can replace b by µb, and then we have pa = [b, a, a],
pb = 0.
On the other hand if ν ̸= 0 then we can replace a by a −(µ/ν)b, and then
we have pa = 0, pb = ν[b, a, a].
Finally, replacing a by ka we have pa = 0,
pb = (ν/k2)[b, a, a]. So the Lie rings with pa = 0, pb = ν[b, a, a] (ν ̸= 0) fall into
two isomorphism classes, depending on whether ν is a square or not a square. (We
are assuming p is odd.)
So there are four Lie rings of order p4 which are nilpotent of class 3, and this
implies that for p ≥5 there are four groups of order p4 and class 3.
The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula has also been used to study the connec-
tion between Burnside groups of exponent p and their associated Lie rings. The
r-generator Burnside group of exponent n, B(r, n), is deﬁned to be Fr/N, where
Fr is the free group of rank r, and N is the (normal) subgroup of Fr generated by
{gn | g ∈Fr}. Clearly any r-generator group of exponent n is a homomorphic im-
age of B(r, n). Zel’manov’s solution of the restricted Burnside problem ([37],[38])
implies that B(r, n) has a largest ﬁnite quotient R(r, n). Any ﬁnite r-generator
group of exponent n is a homomorphic image of R(r, n). (The restricted Burnside
problem for prime exponent p was solved by Kostrikin [18].)
Zel’manov’s and Kostrikin’s work both rely on the connection between a group
and its associated Lie ring. The associated Lie ring of a group G is deﬁned as
follows. First we form the lower central series of G,
γ1 ≥γ2 ≥. . . ≥γi ≥. . . ,
by setting γ1 = G, and γi+1 = [γi, G] for i = 1, 2, . . .. For i = 1, 2, . . . we let
Li = γi/γi+1 and we think of Li as a Z-module. Then we let
L(G) = L1 ⊕L2 ⊕. . . ⊕Li ⊕. . . ,
as a direct sum of Z-modules.
If a ∈Li and b ∈Lj then we can write a =
gγi+1, b = hγj+1 for some g ∈γi, h ∈γj. We deﬁne the Lie product [a, b] to
be [g, h]γi+j+1 ∈Li+j, and we extend this Lie product to the whole of L(G) by
linearity. This turns L(G) into a Lie ring, the associated Lie ring of G.
Now let p be prime, and let L(r, p) denote the associated Lie ring of B(r, p). The
Lie ring L(r, p) is an r-generator Lie ring of characteristic p, and can be viewed as a
Lie algebra over Zp. Furthermore it is well known that L(r, p) satisﬁes the (p −1)-
Engel identity [x, y, y, . . . , y

fact. We will be giving an alternative proof in Section 3 of this article.) Kostrikin

is nilpotent (of bounded class). It follows that L(r, p) is nilpotent of class c (say),
and hence that any ﬁnite quotient of B(r, p) is nilpotent of class at most c. Thus
R(r, p) ∼= B(r, p)/γc+1(B(r, p)).
Furthermore, the order of R(r, p) is the same as the order of L(r, p). Clearly L(r, p)
is a homomorphic image of E(r, p), where E(r, p) is the (relatively) free r-generator
Lie algebra over Zp satisfying the (p −1)-Engel identity.
Sanov [25] used the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula to show that the class
2p−2 quotients of L(r, p) and E(r, p) are isomorphic. For many years it was hoped
that L(r, p) ∼= E(r, p), but in 1974 Wall [34] found a new identity of weight 2p −1
which holds in L(r, p), and he showed that it is not a consequence of the (p −1)-
Engel identity, at least for p = 5 and 7. Wall’s result implies that the class 2p −1
quotient of L(3, p) is a proper homomorphic image of the class 2p −1 quotient of
E(3, p) for p = 5, 7. It seems very likely that this is also the case for all p > 7. In
1985 I found a complete basis {Kn | n ≥1} for all the multilinear identities which
are satisﬁed by the associated Lie rings of groups of exponent p. (The (p−1)-Engel
identity and Wall’s identity are both consequences of these identities. See Chapter
2 of [32] for details.) If we let W(r, p) be the largest r-generator Lie algebra over
Zp satisfying all these multilinear identities, then L(r, p) is a homomorphic image
of W(r, p), which in turn is a homomorphic image of E(r, p).
There remained the hope that L(r, p) ∼= W(r, p). It has been known since 1974
that L(2, 5) = W(2, 5) = E(2, 5) (see [11]). And in 1990 I showed that L(3, 5) =
W(3, 5) (see [30]). But Eamonn O’Brien and I ([24]) have recently shown that
L(2, 7) is a proper homomorphic image of W(2, 7). Mike Newman and I ([22]) have
computed W(2, 7), and have shown that it has class 29 and dimension 20418. But
it turns out that L(2, 7) is the class 28 quotient of W(2, 7), and that L(2, 7) has
dimension 20416.
The main tool for obtaining detailed information about groups of exponent p
(and about groups of prime-power exponent pk) has been the p-quotient algo-
rithm [9], [21]. Subject to limitations of computer memory and computer time,
the p-quotient algorithm can be used to compute a consistent power-commutator
presentation (PCP) for the class c quotient of B(r, pk) for any c, r, pk. In practice
we are restricted to small values of these parameters, but consistent PCPs have
been computed for B(r, 4) (r = 2, 3, 4, 5), R(2, 5), R(3, 5) and R(2, 7). In addition
consistent PCPs have been computed for various quotients of R(2, 8) and R(2, 9).
(Groups of exponent 2 and 3 are well understood.)
A PCP for a ﬁnite p-group P consists of a set {a1, a2, . . . , an} of generators
together with n power relations

(0 ≤α1, α2, . . . , αn < p), and the collection process can be used to express the
product of two normal words as a normal word. The PCP is said to be consistent
if diﬀerent normal words represent diﬀerent elements of P, so that P has order
pn. Once a consistent PCP for R(r, pk) has been computed then the order of the
group can be read oﬀfrom the PCP, as well as other useful information such as
the nilpotency class and derived length.
Another approach has been to use the nilpotent quotient algorithm for graded
Lie rings ([10]) to compute Lie rings associated with Burnside groups. For example,
consistent product presentations for E(2, 5), E(3, 5), E(2, 7), W(3, 5), and W(2, 7)
have been computed.
(As mentioned above, W(2, 5) = E(2, 5).)
A consistent
product presentation for a graded Lie algebra L of dimension n over a ﬁeld K
consists of a basis {a1, a2, . . . , an} for L over K together with
n

relations
[aj, ai] = αi j j+1aj+1 + αi j j+2aj+2 + . . . + αi j nan
(1 ≤i < j ≤n) with αijk ∈K for j + 1 ≤k ≤n. (The coeﬃcients αijk are the
structure constants for the algebra L.) Since L(r, p) is a homomorphic image of
W(r, p) and W(r, p) is a homomorphic image of E(r, p), information about these
Lie algebras gives information about the corresponding groups R(r, p).
One reason for working with product presentations for these Lie algebras rather
than with PCPs for the groups is that the computing resources required to compute
consistent product presentations for E(r, p) or W(r, p) are considerably less than
the resources needed to compute a consistent PCP for R(r, p). For example, the
Burnside group R(2, 5) has order 534 and nilpotency class 12, and nowadays it only
takes a few seconds of computer time to verify these facts. But Kostrikin was able
to show using hand calculation that these were upper bounds for the order and
class of R(2, 5) long before computers were ﬁrst applied to the problem. Kostrikin
obtained his bounds for R(2, 5) by studying the Lie algebra E(2, 5). But it took
another 20 years before Havas, Wall and Wamsley [11] were able to show that
Kostrikin’s bounds were sharp by computing a consistent PCP for R(2, 5).
Here we investigate the possibility of using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀfor-
mula to construct a consistent PCP for R(r, p) from a consistent product presen-
tation for W(r, p). We show that a consistent PCP for the class 2p −2 quotient
of R(r, p) can be computed from a consistent product presentation for the class
2p −2 quotient of E(r, p).
We also show that, provided L(r, p) = W(r, p), a
signiﬁcant proportion of a consistent PCP for R(r, p) can be constructed from a
consistent product presentation for W(r, p). Eamonn O’Brien and I ([24]) exploited
this technique in constructing a consistent PCP for R(2, 7). Note that although
L(2, 7) ̸= W(2, 7), the class 28 quotient of L(2, 7) is isomorphic to the class 28
quotient of W(2, 7), and this was suﬃcient for our purposes.

An example
We give an example to show how a consistent product presentation for the associ-
ated Lie ring of a ﬁnite group of exponent p can be “read oﬀ” from a consistent
PCP for the group. We also show how (in some circumstances) the group PCP

can be reconstructed from the Lie ring presentation by using the Baker-Campbell-
Hausdorﬀformula. The group we consider is the class 6 quotient of B(2, 5) — let
us call it G. This group has order 514 and has a consistent PCP with generators
a1, a2, . . . , a14. The PCP has 14 power relations a5
i = 1, and 91 commutator rela-
tions. To save space we omit all “trivial” commutator relations [ai, aj] = 1. The
non-trivial commutator relations are as follows.
[a2, a1] = a3

The PCP generators a3, a4, . . . , a14 all have deﬁnitions in terms of a1 and a2. These
are given by the following table.
a3 = [a2, a1]
a4 = [a2, a1, a1]

VAUGHAN-LEE
(This is a standard feature of PCPs produced by the Canberra implementation
of the p-quotient algorithm, though for a general group some of the deﬁnitions
may involve p-th powers.) The PCP generators also all have weights, which can
be read oﬀfrom their deﬁnitions. Thus a1 and a2 have weight 1, a3 has weight
2, a4 and a5 have weight 3, a6, a7, a8 have weight 4, a9 and a10 have weight 5,
and a11, a12, a13, a14 have weight 6. For i ≤6, the generators of weight i generate
γi(G) modulo γi+1(G). If ai has weight r and aj has weight s, then ai ∈γr(G)
and aj ∈γs(G) so that [aj, ai] ∈γr+s(G). This implies that the right hand side
of the commutator relation [aj, ai] = . . . only involves generators with weight at
least r + s. Let L be the associated Lie ring of G. We obtain a consistent product
presentation for L on the same generating set a1, a2, . . . , a14 by writing all the
commutator relations from the PCP for G additively, and discarding generators
from the relation [aj, ai] = . . . which have weight greater than wt(ai)+wt(aj). Thus
the trivial commutator relations [aj, ai] = 1 from the PCP for G become trivial Lie
product relations [aj, ai] = 0, and the 23 non-trivial commutator relations from the
PCP for G become the Lie product relations
[a2, a1] = a3

In principle a consistent product presentation for the associated Lie ring of any
ﬁnite p-group can be read oﬀfrom a consistent PCP for the group. But if the
generators of the group do not have order p then its associated Lie ring need not
have characteristic p, so that its structure is more complicated than the structure
of a graded Lie algebra over Zp.

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
555
It turns out that it is possible to reverse this process and construct a consistent
PCP for our example G from a consistent product presentation for L. The point
of this is that it takes less computing resources to ﬁrst compute L, and then apply
the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula to obtain a consistent PCP for G.
We know from Sanov’s result that L is the class 6 quotient of E(2, 5).
The
nilpotent quotient algorithm for graded Lie rings can be used to compute a con-
sistent product presentation for L, and the presentation computed is identical to
that given above. It also gives deﬁnitions for the generators a3, a4, . . . , a14 identical
to the deﬁnitions given by the p-quotient algorithm for the PCP generators of G,
though of course the deﬁnitions of the generators of L are to be interpreted as Lie
products, whereas the deﬁnitions of the PCP generators of G are to be interpreted
as group commutators. We mentioned above that the commutator version of the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula gives
[ey, ex] = ew,
where
w = [y, x] + 1
2[y, x, x] + 1
2[y, x, y] + 1
6[y, x, x, x] + 1
4[y, x, x, y] + 1
6[y, x, y, y] + . . . .
Let us see how this formula enables us to obtain the group commutator relation
[a7, a1] = a2
9a2
11a2
12a13
(to take one example).
We note that a7 = [a2, a1, a1, a2], so that [a7, a1] =
[a2, a1, a1, a2, a1]. The ﬁrst thing to do is to use the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ
formula to ﬁnd an expression for [ey,ex,ex,ey,ex]. This expression can be truncated
at weight 6 (since G has class 6). Using the fact that the Lie element [y, x, y, x]
equals [y, x, x, y] we ﬁrst obtain
[ey, ex, ex] = e[y,x,x]+[y,x,x,x]+ 1
2 [y,x,x,y]+....
Then we calculate
[ey, ex, ex, ey] = e[y,x,x,y]+[y,x,x,x,y]+[y,x,x,y,y]+...,
and
[ey, ex, ex, ey, ex] = e[y,x,x,y,x]+[y,x,x,x,y,x]+[y,x,x,y,y,x]+ 1
2 [y,x,x,y,x,x]+....
We truncate this expression to
[ey, ex, ex, ey, ex] ∼e[y,x,x,y,x]+[y,x,x,x,y,x]+[y,x,x,y,y,x]+ 1
2[y,x,x,y,x,x].
If we substitute a1 for x and a2 for y in this truncated expression, and evaluate the
right hand side of the expression as ea for some a ∈L then we obtain
[ea2, ea1, ea1, ea2, ea1] ∼e2a9+2a11+a13.

556
VAUGHAN-LEE
(It is not at all clear what meaning this expression might have!) The deﬁnition of
a9 is a9 = [a2, a1, a1, a1, a2], and we similarly obtain
[ea2, ea1, ea1, ea1, ea2] ∼ea9+4a12.
Finally, a11, a12, a13 have deﬁnitions
a11 = [a2, a1, a1, a1, a2, a1]
a12 = [a2, a1, a1, a1, a2, a2]
a13 = [a2, a1, a1, a2, a2, a1]
and since they all have weight 6 we immediately obtain
[ea2, ea1, ea1, ea1, ea2, ea1] ∼ea11,
[ea2, ea1, ea1, ea1, ea2, ea2] ∼ea12,
[ea2, ea1, ea1, ea2, ea2, ea1] ∼ea13.
Let us deﬁne b1 = ea1, b2 = ea2, b3 = [b2, b1], . . ., b14 = [b2, b1, b1, b2, b2, b2], by
analogy with the deﬁnitions of a3, a4, . . . , a14. Then we have
[b7, b1] ∼e2a9+2a11+a13, b9 ∼ea9+4a12, b11 ∼ea11, b12 ∼ea12, b13 ∼ea13.
Since a9, a11, a12, a13 all commute we immediately obtain
[b7, b1] ∼b2
9b2
11b2
12b13,
which corresponds to the group commutator relation
[a7, a1] = a2
9a2
11a2
12a13
from the PCP for G.
The whole of the PCP for G can be obtained from the
product presentation for L in this way. In the next subsection we will see why this
procedure is valid.
1.2
Justiﬁcation
We let G be the class c quotient of R(r, p) (for some c less than or equal to the
class of R(r, p)), and we let L be the class c quotient of W(r, p). We make the
assumption that L is the associated Lie ring of G. We suppose that we have a
consistent product presentation for L on generators a1, a2, . . . , an.
We suppose
that each of the generators ai has a weight wt(ai) such that
1 = wt(a1) = wt(a2) = . . . = wt(ar) < wt(ar+1) ≤wt(ar+2) ≤. . . ≤wt(an) = c,
and we suppose that if i > r then ai has a deﬁnition as a left-normed Lie product of
weight wt(ai) in the generators a1, a2, . . . , ar. (The product presentations produced
by the nilpotent quotient algorithm for graded Lie rings satisfy all these conditions.)
Then G has a consistent PCP on the same generating set a1, a2, . . . , an with the

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
557
same weights, and with the same deﬁnitions for ar+1, ar+2, . . . , an. (Though as
PCP generators for G the deﬁnitions of the generators have to be read as group
commutators rather than as Lie products.) As we described above, if wt(ai) = r
and wt(aj) = s then the weight r+s part of the group commutator [aj, ai] = . . . can
be read oﬀfrom the product presentation for L. We show that if r + s ≥c −p + 2
then the procedure outlined above can be used to compute the complete group
commutator [aj, ai] = . . ..
In the example above we had c = 6, r = 2, p = 5. So in this example we can
compute the full group commutator [aj, ai] = . . . whenever r + s ≥3. But the
only commutator [aj, ai] with r + s < 3 is [a2, a1], and since the deﬁnition of a3
is a3 = [a2, a1], the full group commutator relation in this case is [a2, a1] = a3.
Thus in this example we are able to compute the complete PCP for G from the
product presentation for L. And we are able to do this even though the Lazard
correspondence between Lie rings and ﬁnite p-groups is only valid for p-groups of
class at most p −1, whereas G is a ﬁnite 5-group of class 6.
We will show that the complete PCP for G can always be computed from the
product presentation for L provided c ≤2p −2.
The ﬁrst key observation is that since G is nilpotent of class c it follows that G is
a homomorphic image of the free nilpotent of class c group of rank r, Fr,c. We let
A be the free associative algebra with 1 over Q freely generated by non-commuting
indeterminates y1, y2, . . .. Then we let I be the ideal of A generated by all products
of weight c+1 in the generators y1, y2, . . ., and we let Ac = A/I. We let xi = yi +I
for i = 1, 2, . . .. So Ac is Q-algebra, and every element of Ac can be expressed as a
polynomial in x1, x2, . . . of degree at most c, with coeﬃcients in Q. If a ∈Ac has
zero constant term then we deﬁne
ea = 1 + a + a2
2! + . . . + ac
c! .
Then ex1,ex2, . . . ,exr generate a subgroup of the group of units of Ac which we can
identify with Fr,c. We turn Ac into a Lie algebra over Q by deﬁning the Lie product
of two elements a, b ∈Ac to be [a, b] = ab−ba. The set of all Z-linear combinations
of Lie products of x1, x2, . . . , xr is the free nilpotent of class c Lie ring of rank r —
let us call this Lie ring Λr,c. The set of all Q-linear combinations of Lie products
of x1, x2, . . . , xr, QΛr,c, is the free nilpotent of class c Lie algebra over Q of rank r.
And if we let Qp be the subring of Q consisting of rationals of the form m/n with
n coprime to p, then QpΛr,c is a free nilpotent of class c Lie algebra over Qp.
The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula can be used to express products and
commutators of ex1,ex2, . . . ,exr in the form ea with a ∈Ac. Thus [ex1,ex2] = ew
where w = w2+w3+. . .+wc ∈Ac, and where wi ∈QΛr,c is homogeneous of weight
i, for i = 2, 3, . . . , c.
It is easy to see that if i ≤p then wi ∈QpΛr,c. More generally, any commutator
of weight k in ex1,ex2, . . . ,exr can be expressed in the form eu where u = uk +
uk+1 + . . . + uc, with ui ∈QΛr,c for i = k, k + 1, . . . , c. Again, it is easy to see
that if i ≤k + p −2 then ui ∈QpΛr,c. So if k ≥c −p + 2, then u ∈QpΛr,c. The
(c −p + 2)-th term of the lower central series of Fr,c, γc−p+2(Fr,c), is generated
by commutators of weight greater than or equal to c −p + 2 in ex1,ex2, . . . ,exr. It

558
VAUGHAN-LEE
follows that every element of γc−p+2(Fr,c) can be expressed in the form eu, where
u a linear combination of Lie products of weight at least c −p + 2, and where
u ∈QpΛr,c.
Recall that L is the class c quotient of W(r, p), and that L is generated by
a1, a2, . . . , ar. Also recall that G is the class c quotient of R(r, p). Since QpΛr,c is
free nilpotent of class c, there is a homomorphism π : QpΛr,c →L mapping xi to ai
for i = 1, 2, . . . , r. We let N be the subgroup of γc−p+2(Fr,c) consisting of elements
of the form eu with u ∈ker π. We show that N = γc−p+2(Fr,c)∩F p
r,c, which implies
that γc−p+2(Fr,c)/N ∼= γc−p+2(G).
We assume for the moment that N = γc−p+2(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c. There is a homomor-
phism θ from Fr,c to G mapping exi to the PCP generator ai for i = 1, 2, . . . , r. We
let bi = exi for i = 1, 2, . . . r, and if r < i ≤n and ai is deﬁned to be [ai1, ai2, . . . , aik]
then we deﬁne bi = [bi1, bi2, . . . , bik]. So biθ = ai for 1 ≤i ≤n. If k is the small-
est integer such that wt(ak) = c −p + 2 then every element of γc−p+2(G) can be
expressed uniquely as a normal word
aαk
k aαk+1
k+1 . . . aαn
n ,
and so if b ∈γc−p+2(Fr,c) then there are unique integers αk, αk+1, . . . , αn with
0 ≤αi < p such that
bN = bαk
k bαk+1
k+1 . . . bαn
n N.
The integers αk, αk+1, . . . , αn can be determined as follows. Write b = eu, with
u ∈QpΛr,c. Then uπ = 
n
r=k βrar ∈L, for some βk, βk+1, . . . , βn. We let αk = βk,
and then it is not hard to show that b−αk
k
b = ev where vπ = 
n
r=k+1 γrar ∈L, for
some γk+1, γk+2, . . . , γn. We let αk+1 = γk+1, and then b−αk+1
k+1
b−αk
k
b = ew, where
wπ = 
n
r=k+2 δrar ∈L, for some δk+2, δk+3, . . . , δn. We let αk+2 = δk+2, and so
on. In this way we eventually obtain
b−αn
n
. . . b−αk+1
k+1
b−αk
k
b = ez
for some z ∈ker π, as required.
In particular if wt(ai) + wt(aj) ≥c −p + 2 then there are unique integers
αk, αk+1, . . . , αn with 0 ≤αi < p such that
[bj, bi]N = bαk
k bαk+1
k+1 . . . bαn
n N,
and this gives the commutator relation [aj, ai] = aαk

from the PCP for
G.
It remains to show that N = γc−p+2(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c. We will prove that N ≤F p
r,c
at the end of Section 3, as an application of the theory of Lie relators. Given this
result it is quite easy to show that N = γc−p+2(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c.
Recall that N is the subgroup of γc−p+2(Fr,c) consisting of elements of the form
eu with u ∈ker π, where π : QpΛr,c →L is the homomorphism mapping xi to ai for
i = 1, 2, . . . , r. We show that if eu, ev ∈γc−p+2(Fr,c) then euN = evN if uπ = vπ.
(This is not immediately obvious since e−uev is not necessarily equal to ev−u.) So

suppose that eu, ev ∈γc−p+2(Fr,c) and that uπ = vπ. Then we can write v = u+w,
for some w ∈ker π. So e−uev = e−ueu+w = ez, where
z = −u + (u + w) + 1
2[u + w, u] + 1
12[u + w, u, u] + 1
12[u + w, u, u + w] + . . . .
Note that z ∈ker π. So euN = evN, as claimed. It follows that the index of N in
γc−p+2(Fr,c) is at most |Lc−p+2| = |γc−p+2(G)|. But
γc−p+2(G) ∼= γc−p+2(Fr,c)/(γc−p+2(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c),
and N ≤γc−p+2(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c. So N = γc−p+2(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c.

Groups of class 2p −2
Let B(r, p; 2p−2) denote the class 2p−2 quotient of B(r, p), and let E(r, p; 2p−2)
denote the class 2p−2 quotient of E(r, p). Sanov’s result implies that the associated
Lie ring of B(r, p; 2p −2) is E(r, p; 2p −2). So we can use the method described
above to construct part of a consistent PCP for B(r, p; 2p −2) from a consistent
product presentation for E(r, p; 2p −2). However we show that in this case we can
actually construct the whole of a consistent PCP for B(r, p; 2p −2).
As described above, a consistent product presentation for E(r, p; 2p−2) gives us
a set of PCP generators a1, a2, . . . , an for B(r, p; 2p −2), together with their deﬁ-
nitions and weights. It also enables us to compute the group commutator relations
[aj, ai] = . . . whenever wt(ai) + wt(aj) ≥p. But the group commutator relations
[aj, ai] = . . . where wt(ai) + wt(aj) < p can be deduced from relations which hold
in any group. This is because the number of PCP generators of B(r, p; 2p −2) of
weight at most p −1 is the same as the number of basic commutators of weight at
most p −1 in r generators. Essentially, all the commutator relations of the class
p −1 quotient of B(r, p) correspond to commutator relations which hold in free
nilpotent groups of class p −1.
To illustrate this, let us look at the class 8 quotient of R(2, 5). Here p = 5, and
the group commutator relations of weight less than 5 are
[a2, a1] = a3
[a3, a1] = a4
[a3, a2] = a5
[a4, a1] = a6
[a4, a2] = a7
[a5, a1] = a7a9a2
10a11a2
12a3
13a4
14a3
15a3
16a3
20a21
[a5, a2] = a8
All of these relations, except for the relation [a5, a1] = a7a9 . . .come from the deﬁ-
nitions of a3, a4, . . . , a8. Group commutator relations coming from deﬁnitions can
be read oﬀfrom the corresponding relations in the associated Lie ring (or read oﬀ
from the deﬁnitions). So the only commutator relation of weight at most 4 which
we need to compute is [a5, a1] = . . .. Now the deﬁnition of a5 is [a2, a1, a2], so
[a5, a1] = [a2, a1, a2, a1]. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula gives
[ey, ex, ey, ex] = e[y,x,x,y]+[y,x,x,y,x]+[y,x,y,y,x]+....

560
VAUGHAN-LEE
It also gives
[ey, ex, ex, ey] = e[y,x,x,y]+[y,x,x,x,y]+[y,x,x,y,y]+...,
and so
[ey, ex, ey, ex] = [ey, ex, ex, ey]e[y,x,x,y,x]+[y,x,y,y,x]−[y,x,x,x,y]−[y,x,x,y,y]+....
If we compute this expression as far as weight 8 (8 = 2p−2 in this case) then we can
obtain an explicit formula for [ey,ex,ey,ex] as [ey,ex,ex,ey]·b, where b is a product of
commutators of weight 5 or more in ex and ey. This formula is valid in any group
which is nilpotent of class 8, and so gives an explicit expression for [a2, a1, a2, a1]
as a product of [a2, a1, a1, a2] with a product of commutators of weight at least
5 in a1, a2. Note that [a2, a1, a1, a2] = a7. The normal form for this product of
commutators of weight at least 5 can be computed in the way described above.
In this way all the group commutator relations of B(r, p; 2p−2) can be computed
from the presentation for E(r, p; 2p −2).
1.4
R(2, 7)
Eamonn O’Brien and I used the method described above in [24] in the computation
of R(2, 7). It turns out that R(2, 7) has class 28 and order 720416. In constructing
a consistent PCP for R(2, 7) on generators a1, a2, . . . , a20416 we used the Baker-
Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula to compute all the commutators [ai, aj] with wt(ai)+
wt(aj) ≥23 from a presentation for W(2, 7).

Torsion in outer commutator varieties
The parallels between varieties of groups and varieties of Lie rings are particularly
close in the case of outer commutator varieties. Often, the associated Lie rings of
free groups in outer commutator varieties are free Lie rings in the corresponding
outer commutator varieties of Lie rings. And by studying these free Lie rings we are
sometimes able to show that the lower central factors of the free groups are torsion
free. Perhaps rather more surprisingly, we are sometimes able to use information
about these Lie rings to show that the groups are residually nilpotent.
Outer commutator varieties are varieties of groups deﬁned by a single “multi-
linear” commutator identity. Some important examples are the variety of groups
which are nilpotent of class at most c, given by the identity
[x1, x2, . . . , xc+1] = 1,
the variety of metabelian groups, given by the identity
[[x1, x2], [x3, x4]] = 1,
and the variety of groups which are soluble of derived length at most k, given by a
single commutator identity
δ(x1, x2, . . . , x2k) = 1.

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
561
More generally, an outer commutator variety is deﬁned by a single identity of the
form
[x1, x2, . . . , xn] = 1
with some arrangement of brackets. The polynilpotent variety Nc1.Nc2. . . . .Nck
is an outer commutator variety. It consists of groups G with a chain of normal
subgroups
{1} = A0 ≤A1 ≤A2 ≤. . . ≤Ak = G,
where Ai/Ai−1 is nilpotent of class at most ci for i = 1, 2, . . . , k.
In this section we describe one way in which Lie methods have been used to
investigate outer commutator varieties with the aim of showing that the free groups
in certain outer commutator varieties are torsion free and residually nilpotent. But
ﬁrst we give a brief overview of some of the results in this area.
Gruenberg [7] showed that free polynilpotent groups are residually nilpotent
in 1957. And in 1963 Smel’kin [26] proved that the lower central factors of free
polynilpotent groups are torsion free. The variety of centre-by-metabelian groups
is determined by the identity
[[x1, x2], [x3, x4], x5] = 1,
and in 1973 C.K. Gupta [8] proved that free centre-by-metabelian groups are residu-
ally nilpotent, but that they have torsion. The free groups of the variety determined
by the identity
[[x1, x2, . . . , xm], [xm+1, xm2, . . . , xm+n]] = 1
can be expressed in the form F/[γm(F), γn(F)], where F is (absolutely) free. In
1978 Kuzmin [19] showed that F/[γm(F), γn(F)] is residually nilpotent, and in 1995
Tasic and Vaughan-Lee [27] showed that F/[γm(F), γn(F)] is torsion free (for all
m, n).
The situation is more complicated with the groups F/[γj(F), γi(F), γk(F)] and
F/[γj(F), γi(F), γk(F), γl(F)] since many of these groups are residually nilpotent
and torsion free, but others (such as the centre-by-metabelian groups) have torsion.
Groves [5] has recently shown that F/[γj(F), γi(F), γk(F)] is residually nilpotent
and torsion free if i ≤j ≤2i and i ≤k ≤2i + 2j. Groves [6] has also shown that
F/[γj(F), γi(F), γk(F), γl(F)] is residually nilpotent and torsion free if i ≤j ≤2i
and j ≤k ≤l ≤i + j.
The key idea in the proofs of the results of Tasic and Vaughan-Lee and of Groves
is to show that free Lie rings in the corresponding varieties of Lie rings are torsion
free. We make use of a result of Kuzmin and Shapiro [20]. They showed that if the
corresponding relatively free Lie rings are torsion free then these Lie rings are the
associated Lie rings of the relatively free groups. And sometimes we can use this
fact to prove that the groups are residually nilpotent. We now outline this method.
Let w(x1, x2, . . . , xn) be an outer commutator word, and let w be the corre-
sponding Lie word. (Typographically, w is identical to w but w has to be read as

562
VAUGHAN-LEE
a Lie product rather than as a group commutator.) Let F be a free group, and let
G = F/w(F). Let
L = L1 ⊕L2 ⊕. . . ⊕Li ⊕. . .
be the associated Lie ring of G, as described in Section 1. We show that L satisﬁes
the Lie identity w = 0. Using the fact that w is multilinear in x1, x2, . . . , xn we
need only show that w(a1, a2, . . . , an) = 0 whenever a1, a2, . . . , an are homogeneous
elements of L. So let ai = giγji+1 ∈Lji (with gi ∈γji) for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Let
m = j1 + j2 + . . . + jn. Then
w(a1, a2, . . . , an) = w(g1, . . . , gn)γm+1 = 0.
So L satisﬁes the identity w = 0, and this implies that if Λ is a free Lie ring of the
same rank as G then L is a homomorphic image of Λ/ w(Λ).
Theorem 2.1 (Kusmin and Shapiro [20]) If Λ/ w(Λ) is torsion free then L ∼=
Λ/ w(Λ).
Proof Since w is multilinear Λ/ w(Λ) is graded: letting B = Λ/ w(Λ) we have
B = B1 ⊕B2 ⊕. . . ⊕Bi ⊕. . .
where [Bi, Bj] ≤Bi+j, and
Bm = Bm ⊕Bm+1 ⊕. . .
for all m ≥1. The homomorphism from B onto L is a graded homomorphism so
that Li = Bi/Ki for i = 1, 2, . . . (for some Ki). We need to show that Ki = {0}
for all i. Note that it is suﬃcient to prove this in the situation when F and Λ are
free of ﬁnite rank. The advantage of this is that the summands Bi and Li are then
ﬁnitely generated abelian groups.
Now we let C = B/Bi+1. So C is nilpotent of class i, and Ci = Bi. We let
M = Q ⊗Z C, and view M as a Lie algebra over the rationals Q. Clearly M is also
nilpotent of class i. Note that as an additive group C is isomorphic to the direct
summand B1 ⊕B2 ⊕. . . ⊕Bi of B, so that C is torsion free. This implies that
C ≤M.
We use the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula to turn M into a group under
◦, as described in Section 1, and it is then easy to see that M satisﬁes the group
identity w = 1.
For example, suppose
w = [[x1, x2, . . . , xm], [xm+1, . . . , xm+n]].
Let a1, a2, . . . , am+n ∈M. Then
a
=
[a1, a2, . . . , am]◦
=
[a1, a2, . . . , am]L + higher terms.

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
563
(Here we are using [, ]◦to denote commutators in the group ⟨M, ◦⟩, and [, ]L to
denote Lie products in M.) Similarly
b
=
[am+1, . . . , am+n]◦
=
[am+1, . . . , am+n]L + higher terms.
Since M satisﬁes the Lie identity w = 0, it follows that [a, b]L = 0, and hence that
[a, b]◦= 0. So M satisﬁes the group identity w = 1.
Let X be a free generating set for Λ, let Y be the image of X in C, and let
H be the subgroup of ⟨M, ◦⟩generated by Y . Since ⟨H, ◦⟩≤⟨M, ◦⟩, H satisﬁes
the group identity w = 1, and so H is a homomorphic image of G = F/w(F).
This implies that γi(H)/γi+1(H) is a homomorphic image of γi(G)/γi+1(G) = Li.
However Y generates C as a Lie ring, and C is nilpotent of class i. This implies
that γi(H)/γi+1(H) = Ci = Bi. So Bi is a homomorphic image of Li = Bi/Ki.
Since Bi and Li are ﬁnitely generated abelian groups this implies that Li = Bi and
Ki = {0}, as required.

This theorem implies that if Λ/ w(Λ) is torsion free then the lower central factors
of G are torsion free. But to deduce that G is torsion free we need to know that
G is residually nilpotent. However sometimes it is possible to deduce that G is
residually nilpotent from information about Λ/ w(Λ).
In particular, if w(Λ) is
spanned by basic commutators then G is torsion free and residually nilpotent.
Before giving a proof of this result we recall the deﬁnition of basic commutators,
and some of their properties.
Let Λ be a free Lie ring with free generators x1, x2, . . .. Then the basic commu-
tators are:
xi (i = 1, 2, . . .),
[xi, xj] (i > j),
[xi, xj, xk] (i > j ≤k),
. . . .
They are totally ordered, so that commutators of higher weight follow those of
lower weight. If c and d are basic then [c, d] is basic if
1. c > d,
2. if c = [e, f] then f ≤d.
The ﬁrst important property of basic commutators is that the basic commutators
form a basis for Λ as a free Z-module. Furthermore the basic commutators of weight
at least n form a basis for Λn as a free Z-module (so that Λn is a direct summand
of Λ. We can say even more than this: Λn is a free Lie ring with free generating
set consisting of basic commutators c such that
1. weight(c) ≥n,
2. if c = [d, e] then weight(e) < n.
Proofs of all these important facts can be found in Bahturin [1]. It is not hard
to show that (Λn)m is spanned by basic commutators. However ((Λ2)2)2 (the third
term of the derived series of Λ) is not spanned by basic commutators. Groves’s

564
VAUGHAN-LEE
results mentioned above are obtained by proving that [Λj, Λi, Λk] and [Λj, Λi, Λk, Λl]
are spanned by basic commutators under certain restrictions on i, j, k, l. On the
other hand [Λ2, Λ2, Λ] is not spanned by basic commutators.
As an easy example of the sort of argument that can be used we prove the
following lemma.
Lemma 2.2 Let i ≤j ≤2i. Then [Λj, Λi] is spanned by basic commutators.
Proof Clearly [Λj, Λi] is spanned by elements [a, b] where a and b are basic and
weight(a) ≥j, weight(b) ≥i. If weight(b) ≥j then [a, b] ∈[Λj, Λj] ≤[Λj, Λi], and
we are done since [Λj, Λj] = (Λj)2 is spanned by basic commutators. So we may
assume that a > b. If [a, b] is basic we are done. If not, a = [c, d] where c > d > b.
But then [a, b] ∈[Λi, Λi, Λi] ≤[Λj, Λi], and we are done since [Λi, Λi, Λi] = (Λi)3 is
spanned by basic commutators.
2
It is fairly easy to extend this result and show that [Λ2i+1, Λi] is spanned by
basic commutators.
But, on the other hand, [Λ6, Λ2] is not spanned by basic
commutators. The commutator [[y, x, y], [y, x, x], [y, x]] lies in [Λ6, Λ2], but when it
is expressed as a linear combination of basic commutators we obtain
[[y, x, y], [y, x, x], [y, x]]
=
[[y, x, y], [y, x], [y, x, x]] −[[y, x, x], [y, x], [y, x, y]],
and neither of [[y, x, y], [y, x], [y, x, x]], [[y, x, x], [y, x], [y, x, y]] lies in [Λ6, Λ2].
Similarly [Λ2, Λ2, Λ] is not spanned by basic commutators since
[[z, x], [y, x], x]
=
[[z, x, x], [y, x]] −[[y, x, x], [z, x]].
We also need to introduce Gorchakov’s two sided collection process ([3]). And
before doing that it helps to recall some of the key features of the Hall collection
process. In the Hall collection process we start with a positive word
w = xixj . . . xk
on the free generators x1, x2, . . . of a free group F. (It is possible to apply the Hall
collection process to words involving negative exponents, but there are diﬃculties
with this.) Initially, we scan w looking for the smallest index i such that xi occurs
in w. Suppose, for example, that this index is 1. Then we use the commutator
identity vu = uv[v, u] to move occurrences of x1 towards the left. Suppose that w
has a subword xnx1, with n > 1. Then we replace the subword xnx1 in w by the
subword x1xn[xn, x1]. This moves the occurrence of x1 towards the left, though
it lengthens w by introducing the basic commutator [xn, x1]. If we systematically
move the leftmost occurrence of x1 further to the left in this way, then we eventually
obtain a word of the form
x1c1c2 . . . ck,

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
565
where c1, c2, . . . , ck are basic (group) commutators. Note that some of the ci which
occur might be further occurrences of x1. The general step of the collection process
proceeds as follows. Suppose we have a word
u = c1c2 . . . crcr+1 . . . cs
satisfying the following conditions.
1. c1, c2, . . . , cs are basic commutators,
2. c1 ≤c2 ≤. . . ≤cr in the ordering on basic commutators,
3. cr+1, cr+2, . . . , cs ≥cr,
4. if ci = [d, e] for some i with r < i ≤s then e ≤cr.
We call c1c2 . . . cr the collected part of u, and cr+1 . . . cs the uncollected part of
u. (With the initial word w the collected part is empty, and the uncollected part
is the whole of w. After collecting one occurrence of x1 all the way to the left we
had a word x1c1c2 . . . ck with collected part x1 and uncollected part c1c2 . . . ck.) If
the uncollected part is empty then we are done, but this almost never happens.
So we assume that the uncollected part is non-empty. We scan the uncollected
part of u, looking for the least basic commutator (in the ordering on basic com-
mutators) in the sequence cr+1, . . . , cs. Suppose that the least one is c. We look
for the leftmost occurrence of c in the uncollected part of u. Suppose this is as
indicated below.
u = c1c2 . . . crcr+1 . . . cic . . . cs.
Then we “collect c”, by replacing the subword cic by the subword cci[ci, c]. (Con-
dition (4) above guarantees that [ci, c] is basic.) This gives us the word
c1c2 . . . crcr+1 . . . cci[ci, c] . . . cs
with collected part c1c2 . . . cr and uncollected part cr+1 . . . cci[ci, c] . . . cs. Continu-
ing in this way, the basic commutator c will eventually reach the left hand end of
the uncollected part:
c1c2 . . . crcd1d2 . . . dt.
We then say that this occurrence of c is fully collected, and repartition the word
into a collected part c1c2 . . . crc and an uncollected part d1d2 . . . dt. As mentioned
above, the process usually continues indeﬁnitely. But if you specify any particular
term F (k) of the derived series of F, then eventually the uncollected part will lie
in F (k), so that the original word w has been expressed in the form c1c2 . . . crz
where c1, c2, . . . , cr are basic commutators with c1 ≤c2 ≤. . . ≤cr and z ∈F (k).
Alternatively, you can specify a particular term γk(F) of the lower central series
of F, and obtain an expression for w of in the form c1c2 . . . crz where c1, c2, . . . , cr
are basic commutators with c1 ≤c2 ≤. . . ≤cr and z ∈γk(F). In this case we may
assume that wt(cr) < k, and the expression is then unique (for that value of k).
The two sided collection process handles negative exponents as well as posi-
tive exponents, and in the process basic commutators with positive exponents are
moved towards the left, and basic commutators with negative exponents are moved

566
VAUGHAN-LEE
towards the right. At an intermediate stage of the two sided process we have a
word
u = c1c2 . . . crc±1
r+1c±1
r+2 . . . c±1
s c−1
s+1c−1
s+2 . . . c−1

satisfying the following conditions.
1. c1, c2, . . . , ct are basic commutators,
2. c1 ≤c2 ≤. . . ≤cr,
3. cs+1 ≥cs+2 ≥. . . ≥ct,
4. cr+1, cr+2, . . . , cs ≥cr, cs+1,
5. if ci = [d, e] for some i with r < i ≤s then e ≤cr and e ≤cs+1.
Here c1c2 . . . cr is called the positive collected part of u, c±1
r+1c±1
r+2 . . . c±1
s
is called
the uncollected part, and c−1
s+1c−1
s+2 . . . c−1
t
is called the negative collected part. As
with the Hall collection process we scan the uncollected part looking for the least
basic commutator, c say, occurring in the sequence cr+1, cr+2, . . . , cs. If c occurs
with positive exponent we move it to the left using one of the two commutator
identities
cic
=
cci[ci, c],
c−1
i c
=
c[ci, c]−1c−1
i .
And if c occurs with negative exponent we move it to the right using one of
c−1ci
=
ci[ci, c]c−1,
c−1c−1
i
=
[ci, c]−1c−1
i c−1.
As with the Hall collection process, if we specify any particular term F (k) of the
derived series, then we eventually obtain an expression for our original word w in
the form
w = c1c2 . . . cmuc−1
m+1c−1
m+2 . . . c−1
n
for some u ∈F (k), where c1, c2, . . . , cn are basic commutators with
c1 ≤c2 ≤. . . ≤cm, cm+1 ≥cm+2 ≥. . . ≥cn.
The main advantage of the two sided process is that it handles negative exponents
eﬀectively when you are working modulo some term of the derived series of F. The
Hall process can be extended to handle negative exponents, but only modulo terms
of the lower central series of F. The main disadvantage of two sided collection is
that the expression
w = c1c2 . . . cmuc−1
m+1c−1
m+2 . . . c−1
n
is not unique.
We end this section by proving the theorem mentioned above. The argument
that follows is due to Gorchakov, and was used in Groves [5], [6].
Recall that
G = F/w(F) where F is a free group and w is an outer commutator word. We let
Λ be a free Lie ring of the same rank as F.

Theorem 2.3 If w(Λ) is spanned by basic commutators then G is torsion free and
residually nilpotent.
Proof Since w(Λ) is spanned by basic commutators it is a direct summand of Λ,
and Λ/ w(Λ) is torsion free. So, by Theorem 2.1, Λ/ w(Λ) is the associated Lie ring
of G. If we can show that G is residually nilpotent then it immediately follows that
G is torsion free.
We make use of the fact that a basic commutator c can be interpreted either as a
basic commutator in the free Lie ring Λ, or as a basic commutator in the free group
F. We make the assumption that c ∈w(Λ) (when thought of an element of Λ) if
and only if c ∈w(F) (when thought of as an element of F). There is a diﬃculty
here, since it is not clear that this is generally true! However, in applications of
this argument we determine whether or not c ∈w(Λ) by looking at the “shape” of
c (i.e. the arrangement of the brackets), and in all the applications of the argument
that I am aware of it is clear that c ∈w(Λ) if and only if c ∈w(F).
Now let g ∈∞
n=1 γn(G). We need to show that g = 1. Since G satisﬁes the outer
commutator identity w = 1, G is soluble. We suppose that G has derived length k.
We let π be the natural projection from F onto G, and we pick an element w ∈F
such that wπ = g. Then we apply the two sided collection process to w, working
modulo F (k). We obtain an expression
w = c1c2 . . . cmuc−1
m+1c−1
m+2 . . . c−1
n
for w, where
1. c1, c2, . . . , cn are basic commutators,
2. c1 ≤c2 ≤. . . ≤cm,
3. cm+1 ≥cm+2 ≥. . . ≥cn,
4. u ∈F (k).
So
g = wπ = d1d2 . . . dmd−1
m+1d−1
m+2 . . . d−1
n
where di = ciπ for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. (Note that uπ = 1 since G is soluble of derived
length k.) Now ciπ = 1 if and only if ci ∈w(F). If we delete all di such that
ci ∈w(F) from this expression for g we obtain an expression
g = di1di2 . . . dird−1
ir+1 . . . d−1
is
where 1 ≤i1 < i2 < . . . < ir ≤m < ir+1 < . . . < is ≤n, and where cij /∈w(F) for
1 ≤j ≤s.
Let t be the minimum weight of the basic commutators ci1, ci2, . . . , cis, and let
ci1, ci2, . . . , cip, and ciq, ciq+1, . . . , cis have weight t, with the remaining cij having
weight at least t + 1. Then
di1di2 . . . dipd−1
iq . . . d−1
is ∈γt+1(G).
However Theorem 2.1 implies that the images in γt(G)/γt+1(G) of the basic com-
mutators of weight t which do not lie in w(F) forms a basis for γt(G)/γt+1(G) as

568
VAUGHAN-LEE
a free Z-module. We have
di1di2 . . . dipγt+1(G) = dis . . . diqγt+1(G),
where di1, . . . dip, dis, . . . , diq are members of a basis for γt(G)/γt+1(G), and where
i1 ≤i2 ≤. . . ≤ip and is ≤. . . ≤iq. So di1di2 . . . dip = dis . . . diq = u, say.
But then

Lie relators in varieties of groups
By studying Lie relators in varieties of groups, we are able to recover useful infor-
mation about the groups themselves. Perhaps the most famous examples of this
are Kostrikin’s solution of the restricted Burnside problem for groups of prime ex-
ponent and Zel’manov’s solution of the restricted Burnside problem for groups of
prime power exponent. In Section 2 of this article we saw an application of this
method to outer commutator varieties.
Let V be a variety of groups, and let G be the free group of V with free generators
x1, x2, . . .. We form the associated Lie ring of G,
L = L1 ⊕L2 ⊕. . . ⊕Li ⊕. . .
as described in Section 1. Note that L is generated as a Lie ring by the elements
a1, a2, . . . ∈L1, where ai = xiγ2(G).
Let Λ be the free Lie ring with free generators y1, y2, . . ., and let
π : Λ →L
be the unique homomorphism which maps yi to ai for i = 1, 2, . . .. The elements of
ker π are called Lie relators of V. If u ∈Λ lies in the kernel of every homomorphism
from Λ to L, then we say that u is an identical Lie relator of V. Clearly, identical
Lie relators are Lie relators, but it was an open question for many years whether
or not all Lie relators are identical Lie relators. An alternative way of posing this
question is to ask whether or not the associated Lie ring of a relatively free group
is always relatively free. The associated Lie ring of a free group is a free Lie ring.
In Section 2 we surveyed some results which implied that the associated Lie rings
of relatively free groups in some outer commutator varieties are relatively free.
However in 1999 Groves [4] showed that the variety B4B2 has Lie relators which
are not identical Lie relators, so that the associated Lie rings of free groups in the
variety B4B2 are not relatively free. (Here B4B2 is the variety of groups which are
extensions of groups of exponent 4 by groups of exponent 2.)

Returning to our general description of Lie relators, note that Λ is a graded
algebra:
Λ = Λ1 ⊕Λ2 ⊕. . . ⊕Λi ⊕. . . ,
where Λi is spanned by Lie products of weight i in y1, y2, . . .. The homomorphism
π : Λ →L is a graded homomorphism, so that Li = Λiπ. And K = ker π is a
graded ideal of Λ:
K = K1 ⊕K2 ⊕. . . ⊕Ki ⊕. . . ,
where Ki ≤Λi. It is not hard to show that if θ : Λ →Λ is a graded homomorphism
(i.e. if Λ1θ ≤Λi for some i), then Kθ ≤K.
One way of characterizing the elements of Ki is as follows. Let F be the (abso-
lutely) free group of countably inﬁnite rank, so that the relatively free group G of
the variety V is isomorphic to F/V(F). We can identify the free Lie ring Λ with
the associated Lie ring of F, so that Λi = γi(F)/γi+1(F). With this identiﬁcation,
Ki is the kernel of the natural map from γi(F)/γi+1(F) to γi(G)/γi+1(G), and so
Ki = (γi(F) ∩V(F)) γi+1(F)/γi+1(F).
3.1
Wall’s theory of multilinear Lie relators
An element a ∈Λ is said to be multilinear in y1, y2, . . . , yn if a can be expressed in
the form

σ
ασ[y1σ, y2σ, . . . , ynσ],
where the sum ranges over the symmetric group on n letters, and where ασ ∈
Z. (We can similarly deﬁne multilinear elements in any ﬁnite subset of the free
generators of Λ.) It is well known that multilinear Lie relators of V are identical
Lie relators, and we let Kmul be the fully invariant ideal of Λ generated by the
multilinear Lie relators of V. Then Kmul ≤K. Furthermore, as an abelian group,
K/Kmul is a torsion group. More precisely, suppose that a is a Lie relator of V,
and suppose that a lies in the subalgebra of Λ generated by y1, y2, . . . , ym. Suppose
further that a has degree ni in yi for i = 1, 2, . . . , m. Then
n1! · n2! · . . . · nm! · a ∈Kmul.
To prove this, we substitute zi for yi in a for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, where zi is a sum of
ni free generators of Λ (with diﬀerent free generators in each sum). We expand
and pick out the multilinear components of the resulting expression. It is straight-
forward to show that these are all Lie relators of V. But to recover the original
relator a from these multilinear relators, we have to substitute yi for all the free
generators which occurred in the sum zi (for i = 1, 2, . . . , m) and this gives rise to
the coeﬃcient n1! · n2! · . . . · nm!.
There is a beautiful theory of the multilinear Lie relators of V, which is due
to Wall [35].
Let w = w(x1, x2, . . . , xm) be an element of the free group on
x1, x2, . . . , xm, and suppose that w = 1 is an identical (group) relation in V. We let
A be the free associative Q-algebra freely generated by the non-commuting indeter-
minates x1, x2, . . ., and we let A be the ring of formal power series over Q in these

570
VAUGHAN-LEE
indeterminates. We can think of A as being embedded in A. Then exi is a unit in
A for i = 1, 2, . . ., and the subgroup F of the group of units of A generated by ex1,
ex2, . . . is a free group (with ex1, ex2, . . . as free generators). Let (r1, r2, . . . , rm) be
an m-tuple of non-negative integers, and let
z1
=
ex1ex2 . . . exr1,
z2
=
exr1+1exr1+2 . . . exr1+r2,
. . .
zm
=
exr1+...+rm−1+1 . . . exr1+...+rm.
Now consider the element
w(z1, z2, . . . , zm) ∈A.
We let T (r1,...,rm)
w
be the multilinear component of degree 1 in each of the generators
x1, x2, . . . , xr1+...+rm in the power series expansion of w(z1, z2, . . . , zm). Note that
this multilinear element lies in A. However, if we let B be the associative subring
of A generated over Z by x1, x2, . . ., it turns out that T (r1,...,rm)
w
lies in B.
To
see this note that if we are only concerned with the multilinear component of
w(z1, z2, . . . , zm), then we can substitute 1 + xi for exi and substitute 1 −xi for
e−xi in w(z1, z2, . . . , zm) (for i = 1, 2, . . .). Then we deﬁne a Z-linear Dynkin bracket
operator
δ : B →Λ
by setting
(xixj . . . xk)δ =
 [yi, yj, . . . , yk] if i = 1,
0 otherwise.
Finally we let
t(r1,...,rm)
w
= (T (r1,...,rm)
w
)δ.
Wall proves that t(r1,...,rm)
w
is an identical Lie relator of V for every identical group
relation w = 1 of V, and for every m-tuple (r1, r2, . . . , rm) of non-negative integers.
Furthermore, he shows that if W is a basis for the identical group relations of V,
then
{t(r1,...,rm)
w
| w ∈W, r1, r2, . . . , rm ≥0}
is a basis for Kmul. (The word “basis” is somewhat misleading here, though it is
conventional in this context. A basis for a set W of identical relations is a subset
U ⊆W with the property that all the identical relations in W are consequences of
those in U. There is no requirement that the elements of U be independent in any
sense.)
Here is a proof of the fact that the elements t(r1,...,rm)
w
are Lie relators of V. For
each i = 1, 2, . . . we deﬁne a homomorphism di : A →A by
xidi
=
0,
xjdi
=
xj for j ̸= i.

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
571
Note that di induces an endomorphism sending exi to 1 on the multiplicative group
F generated by ex1, ex2, . . .. If g is an element of F we let
gDi = (gdi)−1 · g.
So gDi is in the fully invariant closure of g in F. Furthermore
gDidi = (gdidi)−1 · gdi = 1,
so gDi is in the normal closure of exi.
Now, recall our deﬁnition of w(z1, . . . , zm) above and let r = r1 + . . . + rm. Let
w∗= w(z1, . . . , zm). Then u = w∗D1D2 . . . Dr lies in the intersection of the normal
closures of ex1, ex2, . . ., exr. It follows that u can be expressed in the form
u =

σ
[ex1σ, ex2σ, . . . , exrσ]ασ mod γr+1(F),
where the product ranges over the symmetric group on r elements, and where
ασ ∈Z. Since u = 1 is an identity in V it follows immediately that

σ
ασ[y1σ, y2σ, . . . , yrσ]
is a multilinear Lie relator of V. Now if we expand u using the Baker-Campbell-
Hausdorﬀformula we see that u = ev where
v =

σ
ασ[x1σ, x2σ, . . . , xrσ] + higher terms.
It follows that the multilinear component of u is 
σ ασ[x1σ, x2σ, . . . , xrσ]. (In this
expression [, ] denotes the ring commutator in A.) It is easy to see that
(

σ
ασ[x1σ, x2σ, . . . , xrσ])δ =

σ
ασ[y1σ, y2σ, . . . , yrσ].
For example
([x1, x2])δ = (x1x2 −x2x1)δ = (x1x2)δ −(x2x1)δ = [y1, y2] −0 = [y1, y2].
So the multilinear component of w∗D1D2 . . . Dr is a Lie element a ∈B, and aδ
is a multilinear Lie relator of V. But if we expand a as a linear combination of
monomials, and if we let a′ be the sum of the monomials in a which start with x1
then aδ = a′δ. Furthermore it is not hard to see that a′ is the sum of the multilinear
terms of w∗which start with x1. So aδ = a′δ = t(r1,...,rm)
w
is a Lie relator of V.
3.2
Burnside varieties
As an illustration of Wall’s theory, consider the Burnside variety Bp consisting of
groups of exponent p. A basis for the identical relations of Bp is {xp}.
The multilinear term of (ex1)p is px1, and (px1)δ = py1. In Wall’s notation, we
have t(1)
xp = py1. So we obtain the Lie relator py1.

572
VAUGHAN-LEE
Now consider (ex1ex2 . . .exp)p. Expanding ex1ex2 . . .exp we obtain 1 + a where
a = x1 + x2 + . . . + xp + higher terms.
So, working modulo p, we have
(ex1ex2 . . . exp)p = 1 + ap.
The multilinear component of ap is

σ∈Sym(p)
x1σx2σ . . . xpσ,
and so
t(p)
xp =



σ∈Sym(p)
x1σx2σ . . . xpσ

δ =

σ∈Sym{2,3,...,p}
[y1, y2σ, . . . , ypσ].
Note that if we set y2 = y3 = . . . = yp = z in t(p)
xp then we obtain the relator
(p −1)![y1, z, z, . . . , z], which together with the Lie relator py1 implies the (p −1)-
Engel identity.
Wall’s recipe also gives Lie relators t(n)
xp for all n ≥2. These are equivalent to
the relators Kn mentioned in Section 1.
Next, consider the variety E4 ∩B5 of 4-Engel groups of exponent 5. This variety
is determined by the two group identities [x2, x1, x1, x1, x1] = 1, x5
1 = 1. I proved
that it is a locally ﬁnite variety in [33]. If we let w = [x2, x1, x1, x1, x1], then it is
not hard to see that
t(1,4)
w
=

σ∈Sym{2,3,4,5}
[y1, y2σ, y3σ, y4σ, y5σ],
t(2,4)
w
=

σ∈Sym{3,4,5,6}
[y1, y3σ, y2, y4σ, y5σ, y6σ],
t(3,4)
w
=

σ∈Sym{4,5,6,7}
[y1, y4σ, y2, y3, y5σ, y6σ, y7σ].
The group identity x5
1 gives us the Lie relator 5y1, as above. Note also that t(5)
x5 =
t(1,4)
w
. It turns out that the associated Lie rings of 4-Engel groups of exponent 5
are free Lie rings in the variety L of Lie rings determined by these 4 identical Lie
relators. It is convenient to think of L as a variety of Lie algebras over Z5.
We use a beautiful idea introduced by Graham Higman [12] in his solution of
the restricted Burnside problem for exponent 5, and consider the Lie algebra of L
with the following presentation (as an algebra in L):
L = ⟨x, a1, a2, . . . | [ai, aj] = 0 for all i, j ⟩.

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
573
It is an easy calculation to show that the ideal generated by x in L is nilpotent of
class 4. In fact L itself is nilpotent of class 6. As Higman showed, this implies that
if L is any Lie algebra in the variety L, and if x ∈L, then IdL(x) is nilpotent of
class 4. In other words, any product of elements of L is zero if it has degree 5 or
more in any one element. This means that in considering Lie relators of E4 ∩B5,
we need only consider relators which have degree 4 or less in each variable. Recall
that if a is a Lie relator of degree ni in yi for i = 1, 2, . . . , m. Then
n1! · n2! · . . . · nm! · a ∈Kmul.
Using the relator 5y1, this implies that all Lie relators in 4-Engel groups of exponent
5 are consequences of multilinear relators.
So the Lie relators of E4 ∩B5 are all consequences of
t(n)
x5 (n ≥1)
and
t(m,n)
w
(m ≥1, n ≥4).
Another result of Wall’s is that t(m,n)
w
is symmetric in its ﬁrst m variables modulo
consequences of {t(k,n)
w
| k < m}, and also symmetric in its last n variables modulo
consequences of {t(m,k)
w
| k < n}.
Similarly t(n)
x5
is symmetric in its n variables
modulo consequences of {t(k)
x5 | k < n}. Using an extension of Higman’s argument,
it is possible to show that if L is a free Lie algebra in L, and if a ∈L is multilinear
in 9 or more variables, and if a is symmetric in 4 of those variables, then a = 0.
So the Lie relators in the variety of 4-Engel groups of exponent 5 are all conse-
quences of
{t(n)
x5 | 1 ≤n < 9} ∪{t(m,n)
w
| m ≥1, n ≥4, m + n < 9)}.
It is straightforward to show that these are all consequences of the deﬁning relators
of L. So the associated Lie rings of free groups in the variety E4 ∩B5 are free Lie
algebras in the variety L.
Details of the above calculations may be found in [23], where we also show that
the free rank m Lie algebra in L has dimension n where

(Here fk is the k-th Fibonacci number.) It follows immediately that the free group
of rank m in E4 ∩B5 has order 5n.

VAUGHAN-LEE
We end this section by proving the lemma needed in Section 1. Recall that A is
the free associative algebra with 1 over Q freely generated by y1, y2, . . ., and that
Ac = A/I where I is the ideal of A generated by products of weight c + 1 in the
generators y1, y2, . . .. We let xi = yi + I for i = 1, 2, . . .. The elements ex1, . . . , exr
generate a subgroup of the group of units of Ac, which we identify with Fr,c, the
free nilpotent of class c group of rank r. We let Λr,c be the Lie subring (over Z) of
Ac generated by x1, x2, . . . , xr with respect to the Lie product [a, b] = ab −ba. So
Λr,c is the free nilpotent of class c Lie ring of rank r. Also QΛr,c is a free nilpotent
of class c Lie algebra over Q, and if we let Qp be the set of rationals of the form
m/n where n is coprime to p, then QpΛr,c is a free nilpotent of class c Lie algebra
over Qp.
Also recall that G is the class c quotient of R(r, p) so that we can identify G
with Fr,c/F p
r,c. We are assuming that if L is the associated Lie ring of G then
L is isomorphic to the class c quotient of W(r, p).
Since W(r, p) is deﬁned by
multilinear Lie relators of Bp, this implies that the Lie relators of G of weight at
most c are all consequences of multilinear Lie relators of Bp. In addition, we have
a homomorphism π : QpΛr,c →L mapping the generators x1, x2, . . . , xr of QpΛr,c
to the generators a1, a2, . . . , ar of L. The elements of ker π ∩Λr,c are Lie relators
of G (by deﬁnition).
Finally, recall that elements of γc−p+2(Fr,c) can be expressed in the form eu where
u ∈QpΛr,c, and that N is deﬁned to be the subgroup of γc−p+2(Fr,c) consisting of
elements eu with u ∈ker π.
The lemma needed in Section 1 is the following.
Lemma 3.1 N ≤F p
r,c.
Proof Let b ∈N. We need to show that b ∈F p
r,c.
If b = 1 then there is nothing to prove, and so we suppose that b ̸= 1. By
deﬁnition N ≤γc−p+2(Fr,c), and so there is an integer k with c −p + 2 ≤k ≤c
such that b ∈γk(Fr,c)\γk+1(Fr,c). We may suppose by reverse induction on k that
γk+1(Fr,c) ∩N ≤F p
r,c.
Since b ∈γk(Fr,c)\γk+1(Fr,c) we have b = eu for some u = uk + uk+1 + . . . + uc ∈
QpΛr,c, where uj is homogeneous of weight j for j = k, k + 1, . . . , c. In addition
we have uk ̸= 0, and uk ∈Λr,c. (For a proof of this well known fact see Chapter
2 of [32].) Since b ∈N, u ∈ker π, which implies that uk ∈ker π. So uk is a
Lie relator of G, which implies that there is an element ev ∈γk(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c with
v = uk + vk+1 + . . . + vc ∈QpΛr,c. The key to proving that b ∈F p
r,c is to show that
we can assume that v ∈ker π. For then ev ∈N ∩F p
r,c and e−veu ∈γk+1(Fr,c) ∩N.
By induction we have e−veu ∈F p
r,c, and hence that eu ∈F p
r,c.
So we need to show that if uk is a Lie relator of G of weight k (with k ≥c−p+2)
then we can ﬁnd ev ∈N ∩F p
r,c with v = uk + vk+1 + . . . + vc ∈QpΛr,c.
First note that this is straightforward if k < p. This is because all Lie relators
of G of weight less than p are consequences of the Lie relator px1. So if uk is a Lie
relator of G of weight k, and if k < p, then uk = pwk for some wk ∈Λr,c of weight
k. There is some element ew ∈γk(Fr,c) with w = wk + wk+1 + . . . + wc ∈QpΛr,c.

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
575
Then
(ew)p = epw ∈N ∩F p
r,c,
and we are done.
So from now on we assume that k ≥p. The advantage of this is that if k ≥p
then the restriction k ≥c −p + 2 implies that 2k > c, so that if eu, ev ∈γk(Fr,c)
then u and v commute and eu· ev = eu+v.
It is at this point that we make use of the assumption that the Lie relators of G
of weight at most c are all consequences of multilinear Lie relators of Bp.
Since we are only concerned with Lie relators of Bp of weight at most c, we can
identify them with elements of the Lie subring Λc of Ac generated by x1, x2, . . ..
Let R be the set of multilinear Lie relators of Bp. (Their form does not concern us
here.) We let S be the ideal generated by
{aθ | a ∈R, θ an endomorphism of Λc}.
First note that S is spanned by {aθ | a ∈R}, since if a = a(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈R
then [a, xn+1] ∈R.
Next let a = a(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈R, and let θ be an endomorphism of Λc. Then
aθ is a linear combination of elements a(b1, b2, . . . , bn), where b1, b2, . . . , bn are Lie
products of the generators x1, x2, . . .. Consider such an element a(b1, b2, . . . , bn),
and choose elements c1, c2, . . . , cn ∈Λc where (for i = 1, 2, . . . , n) ci is a prod-
uct of the generators with the same weight and bracketing as bi, and where the
generators occurring in ci are disjoint from those occurring in cj for i ̸= j. Then
a(c1, c2, . . . , cn) ∈R, and
a(b1, b2, . . . , bn) = a(c1, c2, . . . , cn)ϕ
where ϕ : Λc →Λc is an endomorphism mapping generators of Λc to generators.
So S is spanned by elements aϕ where a ∈R and where ϕ : Λc →Λc is an
endomorphism mapping generators of Λc to generators. Actually, if a ∈R, then
na ∈R for any n ∈Z, and so if u ∈Λr,c is a Lie relator of G of weight k for some
k ≤c, then u is a sum of elements of the form
a(xi1, xi2, . . . , xik) with a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈R, 1 ≤i1, i2, . . . , ik ≤r.
So consider a multilinear Lie relator a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) in the variety Bp of groups
of exponent p, with p ≤k ≤c. Let Fc be the subgroup of the group of units of Ac
generated by ex1, ex2, . . .. Then Fc is the free nilpotent of class c group of countably
inﬁnite rank. Since a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈R, there is an element ew ∈γk(Fc) ∩F p
c
where
w = a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) + ak+1 + . . . + ac ∈QpΛc.
Replacing ew by ewD1D2 . . . Dk (as described earlier in this section), we may sup-
pose that ew lies in the intersection of the normal closures of ex1, ex2, . . ., exk. So
we may suppose that ak+1, ak+2, . . . , ac are all linear combinations of Lie products
every one of which involves all of x1, x2, . . . , xk. Note that this, together with the

576
VAUGHAN-LEE
restriction k ≥c −p + 2, implies that aj has degree at most p −1 in any of the
variables x1, x2, . . . , xk for k + 1 ≤j ≤c.
The main step in proving Lemma 3.1 lies in showing that there is an integer n
coprime to p such that naj is a Lie relator in Bp for k + 1 ≤j ≤c. Assuming
this for the moment, we let θ be any endomorphism of Ac mapping xj to xij for
j = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then
ewθ = (ew)θ ∈γk(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c,
and
wθ = a(xi1, xi2, . . . , xik) + ak+1θ + . . . + acθ.
By our assumption, najθ is a Lie relator in Bp for k + 1 ≤j ≤c, and since p ∤n
this implies that ajθ ∈ker π. So
ewθ ∈N ∩γk(Fr,c) ∩F p
r,c.
Recall that we need to show that if uk is a Lie relator of G of weight k (with
k ≥c −p + 2) then we can ﬁnd ev ∈N ∩F p
r,c with v = uk + vk+1 + . . . + vc ∈
QpΛr,c. As we showed above, uk is a sum of elements a(xi1, xi2, . . . , xik) where
a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈R. For each a(xi1, xi2, . . . , xik) which occurs in this sum we
obtain an element ewθ, as above. The element ev that we want is the product of
the elements ewθ.
So suppose that ew ∈γk(Fc) ∩F p
c where
w = a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) + ak+1 + . . . + ac ∈QpΛc,
with a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈R. As we showed above, we may assume that ak+1, . . . , ac
are all linear combinations of Lie products every one of which involves all of
x1, . . . , xk. We need to show that there is an integer n coprime to p such that
naj is a Lie relator in Bp for k + 1 ≤j ≤c.
As an illustration of the situation, consider the element ak+1 ∈QpΛr,c. It is
homogeneous of degree k + 1, and is a linear combination of Lie products each of
which involves all of x1, x2, . . . , xk. So we can express
ak+1 = a′
k+1 + a′′
k+1,
where a′
k+1 is homogeneous of degree 1 in x1, and a′′
k+1 is homogeneous of degree
2 in x1. Let ϕ be the endomorphism of Ac mapping x1 to 2x1, and mapping xi to
xi for i > 1. Then ewϕ = eu where
u = 2a + 2a′
k+1 + 4a′′
k+1 + higher terms,
and (ew)2 = e2w where
2w = 2a + 2a′
k+1 + 2a′′
k+1 + higher terms.
So
ewϕ · e−2w = ev

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
577
where v = 2a′′
k+1+ higher terms. So ewϕ·e−2w ∈γk+1(Fc) ∩F p
c , and 2a′′
k+1 is a Lie
relator in Bp.
We need a more general argument than this to deal with all the components of
w. As we noted above, w has degree at most p −1 in x1, and all the summands in
w involve x1 at least once. So we can express w in the form
w = w1 + w2 + . . . + wp−1
where wi is homogeneous of degree i in x1 (for i = 1, 2, . . . , p −1).
For each
r = 1, 2, . . . , p −1 we let ϕr : Ac →Ac be the endomorphism mapping x1 to rx1,
and mapping xi to xi for i > 1. Then
wϕr = rw1 + r2w2 + . . . rp−1wp−1.
Now the (p −1) × (p −1) matrix with (i, j)-entry ij is non-singular, and its de-
terminant m is coprime p. Furthermore, for i = 1, 2, . . . , p −1 the element mwi
is a Z-linear combination of the elements wϕr (1 ≤r ≤p −1). As we remarked
above, our assumption that k ≥p implies that the elements wϕr commute with
each other. And so emwi is in the subgroup generated by the elements ewϕr. This
implies that
emwi ∈F p
c for i = 1, 2, . . . , p −1.
We can now repeat this argument with the generator x2. For each i (1 ≤i ≤p−1)
we write
mwi = u1 + u2 + . . . + up−1
where uj is homogeneous of degree j in x2. By considering endomorphisms of Ac
mapping x2 to rx2 for r = 1, 2, . . . , p−1 we show that there is an integer m′ coprime
to p such that
em′uj ∈F p
c for j = 1, 2, . . . , p −1.
We repeat this argument for the generators x3, x4, . . . , xk. The original element
w ∈QpΛr,c can be expressed in the form
w =

i
ui
where each summand ui is homogeneous in every generator x1, x2, . . . , xk. The
argument given above shows that there is an integer n coprime to p such that
enui ∈F p
c for all i. Since ui is homogeneous in every generator this implies that
nui ∈Λc and that nui is a Lie relator in Bp.
Returning to our original expression
a(x1, x2, . . . , xk) + ak+1 + . . . + ac
for w, we see that each summand aj is the sum of those ui which have weight j.
Since nui is a Lie relator of Bp for all i, we immediately see that naj is a Lie relator
of Bp for all j, as required.

Superalgebras
Several authors have used the representation theory of the symmetric group and
superalgebra techniques to prove that certain algebras are nilpotent. Zel’manov
[36] used these techniques in his proof that Lie algebras of characteristic zero are
nilpotent if they satisfy the n-Engel identity for any n. Zel’manov and Shestakov
[39] used them in their proof that the radical of a free alternative algebra over
a ﬁeld of characteristic zero is nilpotent. I used them in [31] to prove that if A
is an associative algebra of characteristic zero, and if a4 = 0 for all a ∈A, then
A10 = {0}. And Traustason [28] used them in his proof that 4-Engel Lie algebras
are nilpotent of class at most 7, provided their characteristic is not 2,3 or 5.
The ﬁrst author to have systematically exploited these techniques is Kemer [15],
[16]. In these two articles Kemer solved the Specht problem by proving that all va-
rieties of associative algebras of characteristic zero are ﬁnitely based. His complete
proof can be found in his book [17]. Here we give an illustration of this method,
and outline an extension of the method to computing the dimensions of certain
algebras.
A superalgebra is a Z2-graded algebra A = A0 ⊕A1, where AiAj ≤Ai+j for all
i, j ∈Z2. (Here, by an algebra we mean a vector space equipped with a bilinear
product.) An important example of a superalgebra is the Grassmann algebra, G. It
is the associative algebra with unity generated by e1, e2, . . . subject to the relations
e2
i = 0 (i = 1, 2, . . .), eiej = −ejei (i < j). So G has a basis consisting of 1, together
with the set of all products eiej . . . ek with 1 ≤i < j < . . . < k.
We can express
G = G0 ⊕G1,
where G0 is spanned by 1 together with products eiej . . . ek of even length, and
where G1 is spanned by products eiej . . . ek of odd length. So G is a superalgebra.
If g ∈G0 and h ∈G then gh = hg. But if g, h ∈G1, then gh = −hg.
If X is any algebra then X⊗G = X0⊕X1, where X0 = X⊗G0 and X1 = X⊗G1.
So X ⊗G is a superalgebra. We call X0 the even part of X ⊗G, and X1 the odd
part.
If L is a Lie algebra then L ⊗G is a Lie superalgebra. It is conventional to use
[, ] to denote the product in Lie algebras and in Lie superalgebras. If a ⊗g and
b ⊗h are elements of L ⊗G then we deﬁne
[a ⊗g, b ⊗h] = [a, b] ⊗gh,
and we extend this Lie product to the whole of L ⊗G by linearity. Note that
[b ⊗h, a ⊗g] = [b, a] ⊗hg = −[a, b] ⊗hg.
If either of g or h are even then gh = hg and so
[a ⊗g, b ⊗h] = −[b ⊗h, a ⊗g].
But if g, h are both odd then gh = −hg, and so
[a ⊗g, b ⊗h] = [b ⊗h, a ⊗g].

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY

The deﬁnition of a Lie superalgebra is as follows.
Let M = M0 ⊕M1 be a
superalgebra. Use [, ] to denote the product in M. Then M is a Lie superalgebra
if
[y, x]
=
−(−1)ij[x, y]
[z, [x, y]]
=
[z, x, y] −(−1)ij[z, y, x]
for x ∈Mi, y ∈Mj and z ∈M. Thus [y, x] = −[x, y] if either of x or y is even, but
if x and y are both odd then [x, y] = [y, x], as in the algebra L ⊗G above. In fact
the deﬁning identities for Lie superalgebras are obtained by considering the sort of
identities satisﬁed by L ⊗G when L is a Lie algebra — we make this more precise
below. In characteristic 2 we also need the additional identity [x, x] = 0 when x is
even. And if x is odd you can deduce the identity
3[x, x, x] = 0,
so in characteristic 3 you might want to add in the identity [x, x, x] = 0 for odd
elements.
We want to deﬁne the notion of varieties of superalgebras, and so we need the
notion of free superalgebras. If x1, x2, . . . are even generators and y1, y2, . . . are odd
generators then we form the free superalgebra on x1, x2, . . ., y1, y2, . . . as follows.
Let X be the free algebra with free generators x1, x2, . . ., y1, y2, . . .. As a vector
space, X has a basis consisting of all possible products of the generators, with
all possible bracketings. (Superalgebras need not be associative.) We let X0 be
the subspace of X spanned by all products of the free generators which have even
degree in the odd generators y1, y2, . . ., and we let X1 be the subspace of X spanned
by all products which have odd degree in the odd generators.
Then X = X0 ⊕X1 is a free superalgebra on x1, x2, . . ., y1, y2, . . ..
If f(x1, x2, . . . , xm, y1, y2, . . . , yn) ∈X, and if A = A0 ⊕A1 is a superalgebra,
then we say that A satisﬁes the graded identity
f(x1, x2, . . . , xm, y1, y2, . . . , yn) = 0
if f(a1, . . . , am, b1, . . . , bn) = 0 for all a1, . . . , am ∈A0 and all b1, . . . , bn ∈A1. In
other words, A satisﬁes f = 0 if f is in the kernel of every graded homomorphism
from X into A.
If S is a set of graded identities, then the variety of superalgebras determined
by S is the class of all superalgebras which satisfy the graded identities in S. If
V is a variety of ungraded algebras determined by a set of multilinear identities
then V gives rise to a variety V of superalgebras as follows. Suppose we have a
multilinear element f(x1, x2, . . . , xn) in a free algebra. (We can think of f as an
element of the ungraded subalgebra of X generated by x1, x2, . . ..) Let S be any
subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} and deﬁne z1, z2, . . . , zn ∈X by setting zi = xi if i /∈S, and
setting zi = yi if i ∈S. Pick g1, g2, . . . , gn in the Grassmann algebra G so that
g1g2 . . . gn ̸= 0, and so that gi ∈G0 if i /∈S and gi ∈G1 if i ∈S. Then in X ⊗G
f(z1 ⊗g1, z2 ⊗g2, . . . , zn ⊗gn)

580
VAUGHAN-LEE
= fS(z1, z2, . . . , zn) ⊗g1g2 . . . gn,
where fS is determined by f and the subset S. If we express f(z1, z2, . . . , zn) and
fS(z1, z2, . . . , zn) as linear combinations of (multilinear) monomials, then the ele-
ment fS(z1, z2, . . . , zn) is identical to f(z1, z2, . . . , zn), except for some sign changes.
We obtain 2n graded identities fS = 0 in this way, one for each subset S ⊆
{1, 2, . . . , n}. Note that f∅= f. However the identity f∅= 0 is thought of as a
graded identity which only involves even generators, whereas the identity f = 0 is
an ungraded identity.
If V is a variety of ungraded algebras determined by a set I of multilinear iden-
tities then V gives rise to the variety V of superalgebras determined by the set of
graded identities fS = 0 arising from identities f = 0 in I.
We now give an illustration of how the representation theory of the symmetric
group and superalgebras can be used to proved nilpotency results in varieties of
algebras. Let V be a variety of ungraded algebras over a ﬁeld K determined by
a set of multilinear identities, and suppose we want to show that algebras in V
are nilpotent.
In particular, suppose we want to show that any product of n
elements in any algebra in V is zero. Let T be the free algebra of V, with free
generators t1, t2, . . . , tn, and let M be the multilinear component of T of degree 1
in t1, t2, . . . , tn. We want to show that M = {0}.
We turn M into an KSym(n) module, letting permutations in Sym(n) permute
t1, t2, . . . , tn. For example if V is a variety of Lie algebras then M is spanned by
[t1σ, t2σ, . . . , tnσ] (σ ∈Sym(n)),
and if τ ∈Sym(n) then we deﬁne
[t1σ, t2σ, . . . , tnσ]τ = [t1στ, t2στ, . . . , tnστ].
If we express the identity in KSym(n) as a sum of orthogonal idempotents
1 =

fi,
then
M =

Mfi.
So M = {0} provided Mfi = 0 for all i.
Provided the characteristic of K is greater than n, we can use the classical theory
of representations of the symmetric group to obtain a decomposition of 1 as a sum
of primitive idempotents. The primitive idempotents of QSym(n) are described in
James and Kerber [14]: they correspond to Young tableaux. For each partition
(m1, m2, . . . , ms) of n with m1 + m2 + . . . + ms = n and m1 ≥m2 ≥. . . ≥ms > 0
we associate a Young diagram, which is an array of m boxes arranged in s rows,
with mi boxes in the i-th row. The boxes are arranged so that the j-th column of
the array consists of the j-th boxes out of the rows which have length j or more.
We obtain a Young tableau from a Young diagram by ﬁlling in the n boxes of the
diagram with 1, 2, . . . , n in some order. We then let H be the subgroup of Sym(n)
which permutes the entries within each row of the tableau, and we let V be the

LIE METHODS IN GROUP THEORY
581
subgroup of Sym(n) which permutes the entries within each column of the tableau.
We set
e =

π∈V,ρ∈H
sign(π)πρ.
Then (1/k)e is a primitive idempotent of QSym(n), for some integer k dividing n!.
Furthermore the identity element in QSym(n) can be expressed as a sum of these
primitive idempotents.
For example, let n = 9 and consider the partition (4,2,2,1).
This gives the
following Young diagram:
One possible Young tableau arising from this diagram is
1
3
5
7
2
4
6
8
9
This is a standard tableau, since the entries are ascending in each row and column.
By forming all possible standard tableaux for all possible Young diagrams we obtain
a complete set of primitive idempotents which sum to 1.
We need to introduce a diﬀerent notation to describe these idempotents. If S is
a non-empty subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} then we let
ϕ+
S =

σ∈Sym(S)
σ, ϕ−
S =

σ∈Sym(S)
sign(σ) · σ.
Then (for this tableau) 
π∈V,ρ∈H sign(π)πρ can be expressed in the form
ϕ−
{1,2,6,9}ϕ−
{3,4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7}ϕ+
{2,4}ϕ+
{6,8},
and

{1,2,6,9}ϕ−
{3,4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7}ϕ+
{2,4}ϕ+
{6,8}
is a primitive idempotent.
The relevance of all this to superalgebras is given by the following theorem from
[29], which applies when M is spanned by the multilinear elements in n generators.
Theorem 4.1 Let S1, S2, . . . , Sk be a partition of {1, 2, . . . , n} into disjoint non-
empty subsets. Let ε1, ε2, . . . , εk = ±, and let ni = |Si| for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then

where N is the multiweight (n1, n2, . . . , nk) component of the free superalgebra Z
of rank k in the variety V, where for i = 1, 2, . . . , k the i-th generator of Z is even
if εi = + and is odd if εi = −.

We want to use this theorem to prove that Mf = {0}. That is, we want to show
that
Mϕ−
{1,2,6,9}ϕ−
{3,4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7}ϕ+
{2,4}ϕ+
{6,8} = {0}.
Unfortunately the theorem does not apply directly since the subsets {1, 2, 6, 9},
{3, 4, 8}, {1, 3, 5, 7}, {2, 4}, {6, 8} are not disjoint. We circumvent this problem by
dividing the Young diagram into three disjoint strips, as shown below.

{1,3,5,7}χ
where ψ, χ ∈KSym(9), and where the subsets {1, 3, 5, 7}, {2, 6, 9}, {4, 8}, corre-
spond to the entries in the strips indicated by a, b, c above. To show that Mf = {0},
it is suﬃcient to show that
Mψϕ−
{2,6,9}ϕ−
{4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7} = 0,
and since Mψ ≤M it is suﬃcient to prove that
Mϕ−
{2,6,9}ϕ−
{4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7} = 0.
Conversely, if M = {0} then Mϕ−
{2,6,9}ϕ−
{4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7} = 0. Theorem 4.1 implies that
the dimension of Mϕ−
{2,6,9}ϕ−
{4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7} is the same as the dimension of a certain
subspace in a three generator superalgebra in the variety V. The essential idea is
that the elements of Mϕ−
{2,6,9}ϕ−
{4,8}ϕ+
{1,3,5,7} are skew symmetric in t2, t6, t9, skew
symmetric in t4, t8, and symmetric in t1, t3, t5, t7. We replace t2, t6, t9 by single odd
element, replace t4, t8 by another odd element, and replace t1, t3, t5, t7 by a single
even element. To show that Mf = {0} we only need to show that products of
weight 9 in three generator superalgebras in V are zero.
More generally, any Young diagram with 9 cells can be partioned into a maximum
of three horizontal and vertical strips. And so if products of weight 9 in three
generator superalgebras in V are zero, then Mh = {0} for all primitive idempotents
h ∈KSym(9). On the face of it, showing that M = {0} involves calculating in 9
generator algebras in V, but by using Theorem 4.1 we have reduced the problem to
calculating in three generator algebras in V. This is usually a signiﬁcant reduction.
The same ideas can be used to estimate the dimension of M when M is non-zero.
We give an example of how a slightly diﬀerent type of decomposition of the identity
into a sum of orthogonal idempotents can be used to compute dim(M) even when
the characteristic of K is less than n.
As described in Section 3, the associated Lie rings of free 4-Engel groups of
exponent 5 are free Lie algebras in the variety L of Lie algebras over Z5 determined

by the multilinear identities

σ∈Sym(4)
[x, y1σ, y2σ, y3σ, y4σ] = 0,

σ∈Sym(4)
[y1σ, x1, x2, y2σ, y3σ, y4σ] = 0,

σ∈Sym(4)
[y1σ, x1, x2, x3, y2σ, y3σ, y4σ] = 0.
In [23], Mike Newman and I found a precise formula for the orders of free 4-Engel
groups of exponent 5 by calculating the dimensions of the free Lie algebras in the
variety L. Let L be the free Lie algebra of L with free generators x1, x2, . . .. Since
L is determined by multilinear identities, L is multigraded. If we have a product
a of the free generators of L, then we assign a multiweight w = (w1, w2, . . .) to a if
a has degree wi in xi for i = 1, 2, . . .. Let Lw be the subspace of L spanned by all
products of multiweight w. Then L is the direct sum of its multiweight components
Lw as w ranges over all possible multiweights.
We computed the dimension of Lw for all w = (w1, w2, . . .) such that 
i wi ≤10.
For higher multiweights dim Lw = dim Cw, where C is the free centre-by-(3-Engel)
Lie algebra of countably inﬁnite rank. The most diﬃcult dimension to compute
was dim Lw where w = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). (Here we delete trailing zeros from
all multiweights: for example let (2,2,2,2) represent (2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, . . .).)
So let M be the multiweight (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) component of L. Turn M
into a Z5Sym(10) module, letting permutations in Sym(10) permute x1, x2, . . . , x10.
The identity in Z5Sym(10) is the sum of the 32 orthogonal idempotents
3ϕε1
{1,2}ϕε2
{3,4}ϕε3
{5,6}ϕε4
{7,8}ϕε5
{9,10}
with εi = ± for 1 ≤i ≤5. If we let f1, f2, . . . , f32 denote these idempotents then
M =
32

i=1
Mfi,
and
dim M =
32

i=1
dim(Mfi).
By symmetry, dim(Mfi) depends only on the number of minus signs in the
deﬁnition of fi. We let d0 = dim(Mfi) where i is chosen so that there are no minus
signs in the deﬁnition of fi. And we let d1 = dim(Mfi) where i is chosen so that
there is one minus sign in the deﬁnition of fi. We similarly deﬁne d2, d3, d4, d5. So
dim M = d0 + 5d1 + 10d2 + 10d3 + 5d4 + d5.
Theorem 4.1 implies that di is the dimension of the multiweight (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
component in the free superalgebra of rank 5 in the variety L, where i of the

584
VAUGHAN-LEE
generators are odd. Note that L is a variety of Lie superalgebras. Our computations
showed that
d0 = 4, d1 = 5, d2 = 7, d3 = 12, d4 = 18, d5 = 32.
So dim M = 341.
These 6 calculations in 5 generator Lie superalgebras also give us the dimensions
of certain other multiweight components of L. Let d(w) = dim Lw. Then
d(2, 2, 2, 2, 2) = d0 = 4,
d(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2) = d0 + d1 = 9,
d(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2) = d0 + 2d1 + d2 = 21,
d(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2) = d0 + 3d1 + 3d2 + d3 = 52,
d(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2) = d0 + 4d1 + 6d2 + 4d3 + d4 = 132.
So 6 calculations in 5 generator Lie superalgebras give the dimensions of 6 diﬀerent
multiweight components in 5,6,7,8,9, and 10 generator Lie algebras.

Abstract
Let M∗(q) be the unique nonassociative ﬁnite simple Moufang loop constructed over
GF(q). We prove that Aut(M∗(2)) is the Chevalley group G2(2), by extending
multiplicative automorphism of M∗(2) into linear automorphisms of the unique
split octonion algebra over GF(2).
Many of our auxiliary results apply in the
general case.
In the course of the proof we show that every element of a split
octonion algebra can be written as a sum of two elements of norm one.

Composition algebras and Paige loops
Let C be a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld k, equipped with a quadratic
form N : C −→k and a multiplicative operation ·. Following [7], we say that
C = (C, N, +, ·) is a composition algebra if (C, +, ·) is a nonassociative ring with
identity element e, N is nondegenerate, and N(u · v) = N(u)N(v) is satisﬁed for
every u, v ∈C. The bilinear form associated with N will also be denoted by N.
Recall /that N : C × C −→k is deﬁned by N(u, v) = N(u + v) −N(u) −N(v).
Write u ⊥v if N(u, v) = 0, and set u⊥= {v ∈C; u ⊥v}.
The standard 8-dimensional real Cayley algebra O constructed by the Cayley-
Dickson process (or doubling [7]) is the best known nonassociative composition
algebra. There is a remarkably compact way of constructing O that avoids the
iterative Cayley-Dickson process. As in [2], let B = {e = e0, e1, . . ., e7} be a basis
whose vectors are multiplied according to
e2
r = −1, er+7 = er, eres = −eser, er+1er+3 = er+2er+6 = er+4er+5 = er,
(1.1)
for r, s ∈{1, . . . , 7}, r ̸= s. (Alternatively, see [1, p. 122].) The norm N(u) of a
vector u = 7
i=0 aiei ∈O is given by 7
i=0 a2
i .
Importantly, all the structural constants γijk, deﬁned by ei · ej = 7
k=0 γijkek,
are equal to ±1, and therefore the construction can be imitated over any ﬁeld k.
For k = GF(q) of odd characteristic, let us denote the ensuing algebra by O(q).
When q is even, the above construction does not yield a composition algebra.
The following facts about composition algebras can be found in [7]. Every non-
trivial composition algebra C has dimension 2, 4 or 8, and we speak of a complex,
quaternion or octonion algebra, respectively. We say that C is a division algebra
if it has no zero divisors, else C is called split. There can be many non-isomorphic
octonion algebras over a given ﬁeld. Exactly one of them is guaranteed to be split.
Moreover, when k is ﬁnite, all octonion algebras over k are isomorphic (and thus
split). Let O(q) be the unique octonion algebra constructed over GF(q).

All composition algebras satisfy the so-called Moufang identities
(xy)(zx) = x((yz)x), x(y(xz)) = ((xy)x)z, x(y(zy)) = ((xy)z)y.
(1.2)
These identities are the essence of Moufang loops, undoubtedly the most inves-
tigated variety of nonassociative loops. More precisely, a quasigroup (L, ·) is a
Moufang loop if it possesses a neutral element e and satisﬁes one (and hence all) of
the Moufang identities (1.2). We refer the reader to [6] for the basic properties of
loops and Moufang loops in particular. Brieﬂy, every element x of a Moufang loop
L has a both-sided inverse x−1, and a subloop ⟨x, y, z⟩of L generated by x, y and
z is a group if and only if x, y and z associate. Speciﬁcally, every two-generated
subloop of L is a group.
Paige [5] constructed one nonassociative ﬁnite simple Moufang loop for every
ﬁnite ﬁeld GF(q).
Liebeck [3] used the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups in
order to prove that there are no other nonassociative ﬁnite simple Moufang loops.
Reﬂecting the current trend in loop theory, we will call these loops Paige loops,
and we denote the unique Paige loop constructed over GF(q) by M∗(q).
The relation between O(q) and M∗(q) is as follows. Let M(q) be the set of all
elements of O(q) of norm one. Then M(q) is a Moufang loop with center Z(M(q)) =
{e, −e}, and M(q)/Z(M(q)) is isomorphic to M∗(q). Note that M(q) = M∗(q) in
characteristic 2.
Historically, all split octonion algebras and Paige loops were constructed by Zorn
[9] and Paige without reference to doubling. Given a ﬁeld k, consider the vector
matrix algebra consisting of all vector matrices
x =
 a
α
β
b

,
where a, b ∈k, α, β ∈k3, addition is deﬁned entry-wise, and multiplication by

γ

d

=

ac + α · δ
aγ + dα −β × δ
cβ + bδ + α × γ
β · γ + bd

.
Here, α · β (resp. α × β) is the standard dot product (resp. vector product) of α
and β. Use det x = ab −α · β as a norm to obtain an octonion algebra. In fact,
this is exactly the unique split octonion algebra over k. The identity element is
e =

and, when N(x) = det x ̸= 0, we have

The purpose of this paper is to initiate the investigation of automorphism groups
of Paige loops. We will extend automorphisms of M∗(2) into automorphisms of
O(2) to prove that Aut(M∗(2)) is the exceptional Chevalley group G2(2).
We

also present several results for the general case. Since G2(q) ≤Aut(M(q)), it is
reasonable to expect that equality holds whenever q is prime. See Acknowledgement
for more details.
It is fun to watch how much information about the (boring)
additive structure of a composition algebra can be obtained from the multiplication
alone (cf. Lemma 2.4).
2
Multiplication versus addition
Perhaps the single most important feature of composition algebras is the existence
of the minimal equation (cf. [7, Prop 1.2.3]). Namely, every element x ∈C satisﬁes
x2 −N(x, e)x + N(x)e = 0.
(2.3)
Furthermore, (2.3) is the minimal equation for x when x is not a scalar multiple of
e.
Lemma 2.1 Let C be a composition algebra, x, y ∈C. Then
N(xy, y) = N(x, e)N(y).
(2.4)
When N(y) ̸= 0, we have
(xy−1)2 −N(x, y)N(y)−1xy−1 + N(xy−1)e = 0.
(2.5)
In particular,
(xy−1)2 −N(x, y)xy−1 + e = 0
(2.6)
whenever N(x) = N(y) = 1. In such a case, (xy−1)2 = −e if and only if x ⊥y.
Proof We have N(xy, y) = N(xy + y) −N(x)N(y) −N(y), and N(xy + y) =
N(x+e)N(y) = (N(x, e)+N(x)+N(e))N(y) = N(x, e)N(y)+N(x)N(y)+N(y).
Equation (2.4) follows.
Substitute xy−1 for x into (2.4) to obtain N(x, y) = N(xy−1, e)N(y).
The
minimal equation
(xy−1)2 −N(xy−1, e)xy−1 + N(xy−1)e = 0
for xy−1 can then be written as (2.5), provided N(y) ̸= 0. The rest is easy.
2
We leave the proof of the following Lemma to the reader.
Lemma 2.2 Let
x =

be an element of a composition algebra C satisfying N(x) = 1. Then
(i) x2 = e if and only if (α, β) = (0, 0) and a = b ∈{1, −1},
(ii) x2 = −e if and only if ((α, β) = (0, 0), b = a−1, and a2 = −1) or ((α, β) ̸=
(0, 0) and b = −a),

(iii) x3 = e if and only if ((α, β) = (0, 0), b = a−1, and a3 = 1) or ((α, β) ̸= (0, 0)
and b = −1 −a),
(iv) x3 = −e if and only if ((α, β) = (0, 0), b = a−1, and a3 = −1) or ((α, β) ̸=
(0, 0) and b = 1 −a).
Let us denote the multiplicative order of x by |x|.
Lemma 2.3 Let C be a composition algebra. Assume that x, y ∈C satisfy N(x) =
N(y) = 1, x ̸= y. The following conditions are equivalent:
(i) |xy−1| = 3,
(ii) (xy−1)2 + xy−1 + e = 0,
(iii) N(x, y) = −1,
(iv) N(x + y) = 1.
Proof The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) follows from the uniqueness of the minimal
equation (2.3). Condition (iii) is equivalent to (iv) since N(x) = N(y) = 1. It
suﬃces to prove the equivalence of (i) and (ii).
As (a3 −e) = (a −e)(a2 + a + e), there is nothing to prove when C has no zero
divisors. The implication (ii) ⇒(i) is obviously true in any (composition) algebra.
Let us prove (i) ⇒(ii) for a split octonion algebra C. Assume that |xy−1| = 3,
x ̸= y, and
x =
 a
α
β
b

, y =
 c
γ
δ
d

.
We prove that N(x + y) = 1. Direct computation yields N(x + y) = 2 + r + s,
where r = ad −α · δ, s = bc −β · γ. Also,
xy−1 =
 r
ε
ϕ
s

for some ε, ϕ ∈k3. Since (xy−1)3 = e, we have either ((ε, ϕ) = (0, 0), s = r−1,
and r3 = 1), or ((ε, ϕ) ̸= (0, 0), and s = −1 −r), by Lemma 2.2. If the latter
is true, we immediately get N(x + y) = 1.
Assume the former is true.
Then
r + s = r + r−1. Also, r3 = 1 implies r = 1 or r2 + r + 1 = 0. But r = 1 leads to
x = y, a contradiction. Therefore r2 + r + 1 = 0, i.e., r + r−1 = −1, and we get
N(x + y) = 1 again.
2
There is a strong relation between the additive and multiplicative structures in
composition algebras.
Lemma 2.4 Let C, x, and y be as in Lemma 2.3. Then N(x + y) = 1 if and only
if x + y = −xy−1x.
Proof The indirect implication is trivial.
Assume that N(x + y) = 1.
Then
(xy−1)2 + xy−1 + e = 0, and (xy−1)3 = e. Thus yx−1 = (xy−1)2 = −xy−1 −e.
Multiplying this equality on the right by x yields y = −xy−1x −x.

Doubling triples
Any composition algebra C can be constructed from the underlying ﬁeld k in three
steps. Proposition 1.5.1 and Lemma 1.6.1 of [7] tell us how to do it. Imitating
these results, we say that a triple (a, b, c) ∈C3 is a doubling triple if N(a) ̸= 0,
N(b) ̸= 0, N(c) ̸= 0, b ∈e⊥∩a⊥, c ∈e⊥∩a⊥∩b⊥∩(ab)⊥, a ∈e⊥(resp. a ̸∈e⊥)
and the characteristic of k is odd (resp. even). Then B = {e, a, b, ab, c, ac, bc,
(ab)c} is a basis for C.
Construction (1.1) immediately shows that there is a doubling triple with N(a) =
N(b) = N(c) = 1 when k is of odd characteristic. Such a doubling triple exists for
every split octonion algebra in even characteristic, too.
Lemma 3.1 Let k be a ﬁeld of even characteristic. Then

is a doubling triple consisting of elements of norm one.

Doubling triples can be used to induce automorphisms. By an automorphism of a
composition algebra C we mean a linear automorphism, i.e., a bijection f : C −→C
satisfying f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v), f(λu) = λf(u), and f(u · v) = f(u) · f(v) for
every u, v ∈C, λ ∈k. By [7, Thm 1.7.1 and Cor 1.7.2], every such automorphism
is an isometry (i.e., N(f(u)) = N(u)), and vice versa. Springer and Veldkamp [7,
Ch. 2] use algebraic groups to show that Aut(O(q)) is the exceptional group G2(q),
and more.
Proposition 3.2 Let (a, b, c), (a′, b′, c′) be two doubling triples of a composition
algebra C. Then there is an automorphism of C mapping (a, b, c) onto (a′, b′, c′)
if and only if N(x) = N(x′), for x = a, b, c.
Proof Let k be the underlying ﬁeld. The necessity is obvious since every auto-
morphism is an isometry. Now for the suﬃciency. Let A = ke ⊕ka, B = A ⊕Ab,
C = B ⊕Bc, and similarly for A′, B′, C′ = C. Deﬁne ψX : X −→X′ = ψX(X)
(for X = A, B, C) by
ψA(x + ya)
=
x + ya′
(x, y ∈k),
ψB(x + yb)
=
ψA(x) + ψA(y)b′
(x, y ∈A),
ψC(x + yc)
=
ψB(x) + ψB(y)c′
(x, y ∈B).
All maps ψX are clearly linear, and it is not hard to see that they are also multi-
plicative. (One has to use the assumption N(x) = N(x′).) Since a′, b′, c′ generate
C′ = C, ψC is the automorphism we are looking for.

Restrictions and Eextensions of automorphisms
The restriction of h ∈Aut(O(q)) onto the loop M(q) is a (multiplicative) auto-
morphism. Moreover, two distinct automorphisms of O(q) diﬀer on M(q), because
there is a basis for C consisting of unit vectors (cf. construction (1.1) and Lemma
3.1).
We would like to emphasize at this point how far are the metric properties of N
from our intuitive understanding of (real) norms. Theorem 4.1 is not required for
the rest of the paper, but is certainly of interest in its own right.
Theorem 4.1 Every element of a split octonion algebra C is a sum of two elements
of norm one.
Proof We identify C with the vector matrix algebra over k, where the norm is
given by the determinant. Let
x =
 a
α
β
b

be an element of C. First assume that β ̸= 0. Note that for every λ ∈k there is
γ ∈k3 such that γ · β = λ. Pick γ ∈k3 so that γ · β = a + b −ab + α · β. Then
choose δ ∈γ⊥∩α⊥̸= ∅. (As usual, α ⊥δ if and only if α · δ = 0.) This choice
guarantees that (a −1)(b −1) −(α −γ) · (β −δ) = ab −a −b + 1 −α · β + γ · β = 1.

is the desired decomposition of x into a sum of two elements of norm 1. Note that
the above procedure works even for α = 0.
Now assume that β = 0. If α ̸= 0, we use a symmetrical argument as before to
decompose x. It remains to discuss the case when α = β = 0. Then the equality

We now know that G2(q) is a subgroup of Aut(M(q)). Let us consider the exten-
sion problem. Pick an automorphism g of the (not necessarily simple) Moufang loop
M(q). The ultimate goal is to construct h ∈Aut(O(q)) such that h ↾M(q) = g.
If this can be done, we immediately conclude that Aut(M(q)) = G2(q) for every q.
We like to think of the problem as a notion “orthogonal” to Witt’s lemma. Roughly
speaking, Witt’s lemma deals with extensions of partial isometries from subspaces
onto ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces, whereas we are attempting to extend a multi-
plicative, norm-preserving map from the ﬁrst shell M(q) into an automorphism (=
isometry) of O(q). Naturally, g is not linear because M(q) is not even closed under
addition. However, the analogy with Witt’s lemma will become more apparent
once we prove that g is, in a sense, additive (cf. Proposition 7.1).

592
VOJTˇECHOVSK´Y
Lemma 4.2 Let g ∈Aut(M(q)), and let (a, b, c) be a doubling triple for O(q)
with N(a) = N(b) = N(c) = 1. Then (g(a), g(b), g(c)) is a doubling triple (with
N(g(a)) = N(g(b)) = N(g(c)) = 1).
Proof Since (a, b, c) is a doubling triple, we have b ∈e⊥∩a⊥, c ∈e⊥∩a⊥∩b⊥.
Moreover, a ∈e⊥(resp. a ̸∈e⊥) if q is odd (resp. even). By Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3,
this is equivalent to b2 = c2 = (ab−1)2 = (ac−1)2 = (bc−1)2 = ((ab)c−1)2 = −e,
and a2 = −e (resp. |a| = 3). Because g ∈Aut(M(q)), we have g(b)2 = g(c)2 =
(g(a)g(b)−1)2 = (g(a)g(c)−1)2 = (g(b)g(c)−1)2 = ((g(a)g(b))g(c)−1)2 = −e and
g(a)2 = −e (resp. |g(a)| = 3). Another application of Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3 shows
that (g(a), g(b), g(c)) is a doubling triple.
2
In particular, the mapping h = ψO(q) constructed from g and (a, b, c) by Propo-
sition 3.2 is an automorphism of O(q) satisfying ψ(x) = g(x), for x = a, b, c.
Remark 4.3 This extension h can be obtained in another way when the charac-
teristic is odd. Namely, construct O(q) as in section 1, and deﬁne h : O(q) −→O(q)
by
h(


i=0
aiei) =


i=0
aig(ei).
Obviously, h is linear. For ﬁxed i, j, only one of the 8 structural constants γijk is
nonzero, and it is equal to ±1. Using linearity of h, it is therefore easy to check
that h is multiplicative.
By the construction, h coincides with g on a basis B. However, we do not know
whether h is an extension of g. The fact that h ↾B = g ↾B does not guarantee
that h ↾M(q) = g, since B does not need to generate M(q) by multiplication.
Interestingly enough, it seems to never be the case! The key to answering these
questions is to look at the additive properties of g.

Automorphisms of ﬁnite octonion algebras
We have entered a more technical part of the paper. In this section, we construct
a family of automorphisms of O(q).
Let k = GF(q), and let Lie(q) be the three-dimensional Lie algebra k3 with
vector product × playing the role of a Lie bracket. A linear transformation f :
Lie(q) −→Lie(q) belongs to Aut(Lie(q)) if and only if f(α × β) = f(α) × f(β) is
satisﬁed for every α, β ∈k3. We say that a linear transformation f is orthogonal
if f(α) · f(β) = α · β for every α, β ∈k3.
Lemma 5.1 For a non-singular orthogonal linear transformation f : k3 −→k3,
let f : O(q) −→O(q) be the mapping

Suﬃciency is now obvious, and necessity follows by specializing the elements a, b,
c, d, α, β, γ, δ.

For a map f, let −f be the map opposite to f, i.e., (−f)(u) = −(f(u)). Also,
for a permutation π ∈S3, consider π as a linear transformation on k3 deﬁned by
π(α1, α2, α3) = (απ(1), απ(2), απ(3)).
Apparently, −S3 = {−π; π ∈S3} is a set of non-singular orthogonal linear trans-
formations.
Lemma 5.2 
−π ∈Aut(O(q)) for every π ∈S3.
Proof Let π ∈S3 be the transposition interchanging 1 and 2, and let α, β ∈k3.
Then
π(α × β) = (α3β1 −α1β3, α2β3 −α3β2, α1β2 −α2β1),
and
π(α) × π(β) = (α1β3 −α3β1, α3β2 −α2β3, α2β1 −α1β2).
Hence −π(α×β) = π(α)×π(β) = (−π)(α)×(−π)(β). Thanks to the symmetry of
S3, we have shown that −π ∈Aut(Lie(q)) for every π ∈S3. The rest follows from
Lemma 5.1.

Observe there is another automorphism when q is even:

∂

Then ∂∈Aut(O(q)) if and only if q = 2n.
Finally, we look at conjugations. Let L be a Moufang loop. For x ∈L, deﬁne the
conjugation Tx : L −→L by Tx(y) = x−1yx, where x−1yx is unambiguous thanks
to the properties of L. Not every conjugation of L is an automorphism. By [6,
Thm IV.1.6], Tx ∈Aut(L) if x3 = e. (And it is not diﬃcult to show that x3 = e is
also a necessary condition, provided L is simple.)

Transitivity of the natural action
We take advantage of the automorphisms deﬁned in section 5, and investigate the
natural action of Aut(M∗(2)) on M∗(2) = M(2). The lattice of subloops of M∗(2)
was fully described in [8]. Here, we only focus on the action of Aut(M∗(2)) on
involutions and on subgroups of M∗(2) isomorphic to V4.
Once again, identify O(2) with the vector matrix algebra.
By Lemma 2.2, M∗(2) contains only elements of order 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore,
every involution x ∈M∗(2) is of the form
 a
α
β
a

,
for some a ∈{0, 1} and α, β ∈k3. In order to linearize our notation, we write
x = [α, β] when the value of a is clear from α, β, or when it is not important; and
x = [α, β]a otherwise.
Similarly, every element x ∈M∗(2) of order 3 is of the form
 a
α
β
1 + a

.
To save space, we write x = {α, β}a.
We will sometimes leave out commas and parentheses. Thus, both 110 and (110)
stand for (1, 1, 0). The commutator of x and y will be denoted by [x, y].
Proposition 6.1 Let x = [α, β]a, y = [γ, δ]b be two involutions of M∗(2), x ̸= y.
Then:
(i) [x, y] = e if and only if |xy| = 2 if and only if ⟨x, y⟩∼= V4 if and only if
α · δ = β · γ.
(ii) [x, y] ̸= e if and only if |xy| = 3 if and only if ⟨x, y⟩∼= S3 if and only if
α · δ ̸= β · γ.
(iii) x is contained in a subgroup isomorphic to S3,
(iv) every subgroup of M∗(2) isomorphic to S3 contains an involution of the form
[ , ]0.
Proof The involution x commutes with y if and only if |xy| = 2. Since
xy =

ab + β · γ

parts (i) and (ii) follow.
Given x = [α, β]a, pick δ ∈α⊥, γ ̸∈β⊥, and choose b ∈{0, 1} so that y =
[γ, δ]b ∈M∗(2). Then ⟨x, y⟩∼= S3, and (iii) is proved.
Let G ≤M∗(2), G ∼= S3. Let x = [α, β]1, y = [γ, δ]1 ∈G, x ̸= y. Then
xy =

1 + α · δ
α + γ + β × δ
β + δ + α × γ
1 + β · γ

Since |xy| = 3, we have α · δ ̸= β · γ. In other words, α · δ + β · γ = 1. Then the
third involution xyx ∈G equals
 1 + α · δ + (α + γ) · β

=
 α · β

But α · β = 0, as det x = 1.

Lemma 6.2 Let x ∈G ≤M be an element of order 3, G ∼= S3, and M a Moufang
loop. Then Tx ∈Aut(M) permutes the involutions of G.
Proof Let G = ⟨x, y⟩∼= S3 with |y| = 2. The remaining two involutions of G are
xy and yx. Then Tx(y) = x−1yx = xy, Tx(xy) = yx, and Tx(yx) = y. This can
be seen from any presentation of G, or easily via the natural representation of S3
with x = (1, 2, 3), y = (1, 2) ∈S3.

We are going to show that Aut(M∗(2)) acts transitively on the subgroups of
M∗(2) isomorphic to C2 — the copies of C2 in M∗(2). Let
x0 = [111, 111]
be the canonical involution. For a vector α, let w(α) be the weight of α, i.e., the
number of nonzero coordinates of α.
Proposition 6.3 The group Aut(M∗(2)) acts transitively on the copies of C2 in
M∗(2).
Proof Let x = [α, β]a be an involution. We transform x into x0. By Proposition
6.1(iii), x is contained in some G ∼= S3. By Lemma 6.2 and Proposition 6.1(iv), we
may assume that a = 0.
Let r = w(α), s = w(β). Using the automorphism ∂from Lemma 5.3 we can
assume that r ≥s. We now transform x into x′ so that x′ = x0 or x′ = x1 or
⟨x′, x0⟩∼= S3 or ⟨x′, x1⟩∼= S3, where x1 = [100, 100].
If r ̸≡s
(mod 2), then ⟨x, x0⟩∼= S3, by Proposition 6.1(ii). Suppose that r ≡s.
Every permutation of coordinates can be made into an automorphism of M∗(2), by
Lemma 5.2. The involution x0 is invariant under all permutations. Since a = 0, we
must have s > 0, and thus (r, s) = (2, 2), (1, 1), (3, 1) or (3, 3). If (r, s) = (2, 2),
transform x into x′ = [110, 011], and note that ⟨x′, x1⟩∼= S3. If (r, s) = (1, 1),
transform x into x′ = x1. If (r, s) = (3, 1), transform x into x′ = [111, 001]. Once
again, ⟨x′, x1⟩∼= S3. Finally, if (r, s) = (3, 3), we have x = x′ = x0.
Now, when ⟨x′, xi⟩∼= S3 for some i ∈{0, 1}, we can permute the involutions of
⟨x′, xi⟩so that x′ is mapped onto xi, by Lemma 6.2.
It remains to show how to transform x1 into x0. For that matter, consider the
element y = {001, 101}1, and check that x0 = Ty(x1).

Let us now continue by showing that there are at most two orbits of transitivity
for copies of V4. (In fact, there are exactly two orbits but we will not need this
fact.)
Put
u0 = [000, 110],
u1 = [001, 001],
u2 = [100, 010].

Lemma 6.4 Let V4 ∼= ⟨u, v⟩≤M∗(2). There is f ∈Aut(M∗(2)) such that f(u) =
x0 and f(v) is one of the two elements u1, u2.
Proof By Proposition 6.3, we may assume that u = x0. Write v = [α, β], r = w(α),
s = w(β). We have r ≡s, else ⟨u, v⟩∼= S3. Thanks to the automorphism ∂, we may
assume that r ≤s. If (r, s) = (0, 2), transform v into u0; if (r, s) = (1, 1), into u1
or u2; if (r, s) = (1, 3), into u3 = [001, 111]; if (r, s) = (2, 2), into u4 = [110, 110]
or u5 = [011, 101].
Let v1 = {010, 110}0, v2 = {001, 101}0, and deﬁne f1 = Tv−1
2 ◦Tv1, f2 = Tv−1
1 ◦Tv2
(compose mappings from the right to the left). Then f1, f2 are automorphisms of
M∗(2), and one can check directly that f1(x0) = f2(x0) = x0. Moreover, f1(u4) =
u1, f1(u3) = u2, f1(u5) = u3, and f2(u5) = ∂(u0). Thus u4 can be transformed
into u1, and each of u0, u3, u5 into u2.

Main result
We are now ready to demonstrate that the map h : O(2) −→O(2) constructed in
section 4 is an extension of g.
Proposition 7.1 Let C be a composition algebra, and let M ⊆C be the set of
all elements of norm 1. Assume that x, y ∈M are such that x + y ∈M. Then
g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y) for every g ∈Aut(M).
Proof If x = y, we have 1 = N(x + y) = N(2x) = 4N(x) = 4. Therefore the
characteristic is 3, and g(x) + g(x) = −g(x) = g(−x) = g(x + x).
Assume that x ̸= y.
By Lemma 2.3, |xy−1| = 3, and so |g(x)g(y)−1| =
|g(xy−1)| = 3 as well.
Then N(g(x) + g(y)) = 1, again by Lemma 2.3.
Con-
sequently, we use Lemma 2.4 twice to obtain g(x) + g(y) = −g(x)g(y)−1g(x) =
g(−xy−1x) = g(x + y).

We proceed to prove by induction on the number of summands that
g(
n

i=1
xi) =
n

i=1
g(xi)
for every g ∈Aut(M∗(2)) and x1, . . ., xn ∈M∗(2) such that x1 +· · ·+xn ∈M∗(2).
Lemma 7.2 Suppose that x, y ∈M∗(2), x ̸= y, are such that none of x+e, y +e,
x + y belongs to M∗(2). Then ⟨x, y⟩∼= V4, and there are a, b ∈M∗(2) such that
a + b = e, and x + a, y + b ∈M∗(2).
Proof We have N(x + e) = 0, i.e., N(x, e) = 0 −1 −1 = 0. Then, by Lemma 2.1,
x2 = (xe−1)2 = −e = e. Similarly, y2 = (xy−1)2 = e.
Since ⟨x, y⟩∼= V4, we may assume that (x, y) = (x0, u1) or (x, y) = (x0, u2),
where x0, u1, u2 are as in Lemma 6.4. When (x, y) = (x0, u1), let a = {011, 010}1,
else put a = {110, 100}1. In both cases, let b = e −a, and verify that x + a,
y + b ∈M∗(2).

Proposition 7.3 Let x1, . . ., xn ∈M∗(2) be such that x = n
i=1 xi belongs to
M∗(2). Then
g(

i=1
xi) =

i=1
g(xi).
Proof The case n = 1 is trivial, and n = 2 is just Proposition 7.1. Assume that
n ≥3 and that the Proposition holds for all m < n. We can assume that at least
two summands xi are diﬀerent, say xn−2 ̸= xn−1. Since g(xx−1
n ) = g(x)g(xn)−1,
we can furthermore assume that xn = e. When at least one of xn−2 + e, xn−1 + e,
xn−2+xn−1 belongs to M∗(2), we are done by the induction hypothesis. Otherwise,
Lemma 7.2 applies, and there are a, b ∈M∗(2) such that a+xn−2, b+xn−1 ∈M∗(2),
and a + b = e. Therefore,
g(x)
=
g(x1 + · · · + xn−3 + (xn−2 + a) + (xn−1 + b))
=
g(x1) + · · · + g(xn−3) + g(xn−2 + a) + g(xn−1 + b)
=
g(x1) + · · · + g(xn−1) + g(a) + g(b)
=
g(x1) + · · · + g(xn−1) + g(a + b),
and we are through.

Theorem 7.4 Every automorphism of M∗(2) can be uniquely extended into an
automorphism of O(2). In particular, Aut(M∗(2)) is isomorphic to G2(2).
Proof Pick g ∈Aut(M∗(2)). Using the basic triple for O(2) from Lemma 3.1
construct an automorphism h = ψO(2) of O(2), as in Proposition 3.2. Then g, h
coincide on a basis induced by the doubling triple. Every element of M∗(2) is a
sum of some of the basis elements. Hence, by Proposition 7.3, g and h coincide on
M∗(2).
This extension is unique.
Thus Aut(M∗(2)) = Aut(O(2)), and Aut(O(2)) is
isomorphic to G2(2) by a theorem of Springer and Veldkamp.
