that ‘fake news’ had on the American electorate, 
the company hired dedicated fact-checkers in an 
attempt to minimise the number and impact  
of these types of stories. Unfortunately, those 
fact-checkers have recently come out and stated 
that, with their current level of resources,  
they’ve had minimal effect on the spread of 
blatant falsehoods across the social network — 
effectively making them little more than a PR 
ploy. Facebook, of course, has a reputation for 
trying to fix things programmatically — in other 
words, by using code wherever possible — so it’s 
perhaps no big surprise that the people it has 
hired feel under-resourced... 
It’s the users who are ultimately Facebook’s 
greatest resource, so it’s worth asking ourselves 
whether we’re getting a positive return on the 
social and mental time we’re investing. I’m of the 
opinion that, at the very least, if the social giants 
want to keep our attention, they need to stand up 
and take more responsibility for what appears  
on their networks. 
In the meantime, as with anything potentially 
dangerous, the age-old advice probably still holds 
true: use only in moderation... and definitely not 
after you’ve been drinking.  
WITH AN ESTIMATED 2.07 billion monthly 
users — or more than a quarter of the global 
population — it’s undeniable that Facebook 
wields a lot of power in today’s world. And the 
social network can be an incredibly useful tool, 
offering users a convenient way to see what 
friends and family are doing while catching up 
on important news (and not-so-important 
funny memes). But it’s also easy to spend way 
too much time on the site on in the mobile app 
— something that more and more people are 
speaking out about... even tech moguls who’ve 
made billions of dollars from the service.
In a recent interview with website The Verge 
(see tinyurl.com/tla72-parkface) tech billionaire 
Sean Parker, who created Napster and was an 
early investor in Facebook, railed against the 
company and the design tactics it employs to 
keep users hooked on the service, saying it was 
deliberately “exploiting a vulnerability in human 
psychology” through social-validation feedback 
loops. And the introduction of fake news to the 
pot makes the issue of our social-media use  
all the more important to consider.
Facebook has at least made moves in trying  
to fight the latter. In the wake of the 2016 US 
presidential election and the potential impact

The old online BBQ 
switcheroo
I recently decided to purchase a 
Weber BBQ. A website appeared in Google 
with some great offers. Unfortunately, the BBQ
never arrived. The old adage of ‘it sounds too 
good to be true’ was correct. 
Here’s what I’ve learnt from my experience: 
Never purchase anything online using a direct 
bank transfer into the vendor’s account. Write 
an email with an enquiry and see if you get a 
response. Is there an address connected to the 
website? There was in my case but a later search 
proved it was a fake. If there is a phone number,
call them. Again, there wasn’t in my case. See if 
the company name is actually registered with 
ASIC. For me, it wasn’t. If in doubt, do a Google
search on the website address. The Consumer 
Affairs website said be wary of any address that 
begins with ‘BBQ’ at this time of year. Yes, you 
guessed it... mine did.
It sure was a slick website, though. Turns out,
that’s because most of it was stolen from a
genuine vendor. This time, I’m going to a real
shop with real people and bugger the price.
The kids asked for a BBQ Christmas lunch
and that’s what they’re getting!

On passwords and 
personal security
I was reading the Editorial in the 
December issue (page 3) the other day, in 
which Dan once more explains the importance 
of having a good password and utilising the 
power of password managers. Well, you’ve 
finally convinced me to take the plunge! I had 
been doing the unthinkable for a long time — 
recycling the same password over and over, 
adding a different number here, slapping on a 
capital letter there... In my heart, I knew it was 
risky, but after receiving a suspicious email 
from my brother, I realised that, yes, I could 
get hacked, too. So I did a bit of shopping 
around and reading of your security articles 
over the past year and have decided to give 
1Password a go. I’ve set up the app on my 
iPhone and have linked it with a desktop 
version on my iMac at home. One by one,  
I’ve been adding in my current login details  
and then visiting each site or app, then 
changing my passwords to a randomised 
suggestion from 1Password. It’s taking a long 
time, yes, but it’s also strangely satisfying that 
I’m finally doing something about my terrible 
security/password habits.
If there are any readers out there who are 
afraid to take the plunge, like I was, I can assure 
you that 1Password is about as simple as it gets. 
It does take a while to set up all your login 
details, but the way I see it... Rome wasn’t built 
in a day and all that! Thanks for the tips, 
TechLife team! Keep ‘em coming!

YOUR GUIDE TO HOT NEW TECH
[ TECHLIFE #72 ]
THE XBOX ONE X is the powerful premium 
console Microsoft first promised gamers over a 
year and a half ago. It’s capable of driving games 
along at 4K HDR at 60 frames per second —  
at least on a handful of titles — and, as part of 
Microsoft’s Xbox family, it doesn’t force you to 
throw out the games you already own for new 
‘enhanced’ editions. In some cases, Xbox One 
games you might have played a year ago will 
now look absolutely stunning when fired-up on 
the One X. Those might be the only Xbox-
exclusive games you’ll be playing for a while, 
though, with few big name first-party titles 
currently on the horizon. Thankfully, all of the 
major holiday 2017 releases, including Call of 
Duty: WWII, Assassin’s Ceeed: Origins and 
Wolfenstein II, are available with One X patches.
4KING AWESOME
Beyond higher-res gaming, the console is also 
perfect for media junkies — there’s 4K Netflix 
and Stan on-board alongside a 4K app for 
YouTube, Amazon’s Prime Video app is now 
Ultra HD compatible and, when all else fails, 
there’s also a reasonably good 4K Blu-ray player 
built into the box — a feature that no other 
console maker has at the moment, and a few 
early bugs with disc playback were quickly 
fixed by Microsoft. The new console also 
supports Dolby’s Atmos audio, among other 
premium surround audio formats.
However, while you can make a strong case 
for the One X based on its specs, buying one 
right now isn’t quite an open-and-shut case. 
While powerful, sleek and wonderful, it’s 
essentially a souped-up version of the $399 
Xbox One S. The X can play certain games in 
native 4K while the S only does upscaled 4K, 
sure; but the Xbox One S arguably does 
upscaled 4K so well that you might not even be 
able to notice the difference. That said, having 
the option to choose buttery-smooth 
performance over native 4K resolutions in 
certain games, or vice versa, is something  
that we heartily endorse in console gaming 
going forward.

XBOX ONE X
[ WWW.TECHLIFE.NET ]
[ 009 ]
The One X is a fairly neat and unobtrusive 
rectangular box that’s the same size as a larger 
Blu-ray player, coated with an attractive matte- 
black colour. It’s a far cry from the bulky VHS 
player-stylings of the original Xbox One.
In terms of ports, round the back, you’ve got 
a power connector, HDMI out, HDMI in, three 
USB ports, an IR out, an optical audio port and 
an Ethernet port. The console will also not see 
the return of the original Xbox One’s Kinect 
port — if you haven’t heard, Kinect (Microsoft’s 
motion-sensing camera) is officially dead.
Controller-wise, the new machine is packing 
a new darker gamepad, which, for all intents 
and purposes, is exactly the same mechanically 
as the one that currently ships with the One S. 
SHOW ME YOUR MOVES
The console comes equipped with an eight-core 
CPU clocked at 2.3GHz, alongside 12GB of 
GDDR5 RAM. It features a GPU clocked at 
1,172MHz leaving the console with 6 teraflops 
of graphical computing power. That RAM is 
split in between the system and the GPU, 
however, so don’t go jumping on the PC Gamer 
forums to tell them how consoles have finally 
surpassed PCs in terms of value performance.
On the CPU side of things, the X is running a 
custom AMD chip with eight Jaguar CPU cores 
clocked at 2.3GHz. That’s a 76% increase 
compared to the CPU inside the original Xbox 
One and One S. 
Where the One X falters is on its hard drive 
— the small 1TB drive that comes standard  
is the only configuration Microsoft plans on 
selling for the immediate future. Consider the 
fact that all these new ‘Enhanced for Xbox One 
X’ titles use 4K image assets — Gears of War 4 
alone takes up 100GB — and you begin to 
realise that 1TB isn’t nearly enough.
If you’re a 1080p TV owner, the console will 
do something called supersampling to create 
better-looking images. The idea is that the game
renders itself in 4K thinking it’s connected to a 
4K screen, which means objects are rendered 
with four times the detail. All this data can’t be 
displayed because, at the output end, it’s still 
being shown on a 1080p TV, but the resulting 
image is one that is more detail-rich. In practice,
that means images are going to look a little bit 
sharper. FHD TV owners will still need to 
download those huge 4K assets to take 
advantage of supersampling, though.
On a true 4K HDR TV, the Xbox One X can 
really unleash its full potential. Games render at
up to native 4K, offering four times the detail of
regular 1080p. Better still, some of those games 
will have a wider array of colour options thanks
to high dynamic range (HDR) support. In our 
experience, One X games have so far offered 
price. We were wrong. When hooked up to a 
decent 4K HDR screen, it plays games at an 
astoundingly high level of detail. Throw on a 4K 
Blu-ray player with Dolby Atmos sound, and 
you’ll be treated to the best cinematic 
experience this side of movie theatre.
The Xbox One X is the pinnacle of console 
gaming. But while it has claimed the new top 
spot, its closest competitors — the PS4 Pro and 
the much cheaper Xbox One S — aren’t that far 
behind. Despite not being able to play games in 
native 4K, the latter consoles are around half the 
price and often produce images that look nearly 
as good. Their better balance between price and 
performance will make them a better pick for 
the vast majority of gamers out there.
So is an Xbox One X for you? The simplest 
question you can ask yourself is: ‘Will I 
appreciate the extra horsepower?’ If you’re the 
kind of gamer who stops to look at the scenery 
in games like The Witcher or Dragon Age,  
or a streamer who can point out a 4 frame- 
per-second difference between videos, the One 
X will be a worthwhile investment. 
But if you’re a gamer who just wants a console 
that plays great-looking games without digging 
too deep into your savings, the One S might be  
a more sensible option.  
deeper HDR settings than their PS4 Pro 
equivalents, allowing users to tweak white 
balance for better contrast.
I’D TAB THAT
The new redesigned Xbox One interface is a sort 
of mash-up of the Xbox 360 blade design and 
the Windows 10 block-and-pin-heavy design.
Like the blade design of yore, the interface is 
separated by purpose: there’s Home and Store, 
but also tabs for Community, Entertainment 
and Mixer, a Microsoft-owned Twitch 
competitor. One of its most unique features is 
turning the idea of pins — games or apps that 
you are really attached to — into full rows on 
the Home screen. This row might call attention 
to DLC, note how close you are to a particular 
achievement, or show you a highlight from 
Mixer. It’s a marked improvement. What we’re 
less appreciative of, however, is how deep 
Microsoft buries things like friends lists and 
settings. These sections are usually relegated  
to the small Xbox Help Bar.
ALL IN ALL
Coming into this review, we had some concerns 
that this premium console’s performance, 
however good, might not be able to justify its

SEARCHES FOR TV SHOWS AND 
MOVIES ON NETFLIX BEAT PIRATE 
ALTERNATIVES, SAYS GOOGLE
MORE WAYS THAN ONE TO GET YOUR 
ENTERTAINMENT.
It’s something that’s been said a lot — make 
TV shows and movies more accessible and 
piracy will reduce. To test that theory, 
Google undertook a study in one of the 
world’s hottest piracy spots, Brazil, and 
found that streaming services like Netflix 
are giving people access to interesting 
libraries on easy-to-use platforms, thus 
spreading awareness that there are 
alternatives to piracy. Netflix isn’t 
necessarily reducing piracy itself, but nine 
out of 10 users say they are “extremely 
satisfied” with the service.   [ SS ]
IF YOU’VE BEEN hanging for a hybrid fibre-coaxial NBN upgrade to your internet
connection, you’re going to have to wait a while longer — the NBN Co has announced 
that it’s temporarily putting its HFC rollout on hold while it focuses on improving “end 
user experience and retailer satisfaction.” According to the NBN Co, the purpose of its 
“new initiatives” is “aimed at raising the standard of service quality when declaring the 
hybrid coaxial-fibre as ‘ready to connect’ (RTC)”. The company has also stated that the 
changes will “also help to further improve the reliability of the network.” Of the one 
million premises that are classified as RTC for HFC, the 370,000 end users that have 
already taken the plunge will be first to see the benefits of the new initiatives, while the rest 
could end up waiting several months for the improvements. “We remain confident of 
reaching our goal of completing the build and connecting eight million Australian 
premises by 2020,” said Bill Morrow, NBN Co Chief Executive.  [ STEPHEN LAMBRECHTS ]

[BEAT THE BILL]
Aussies to ‘own’ their utility,  
banking and internet data
NEW LEGISLATION GIVES POWER TO COMPARE AND 
CONTRAST  — AND EASILY SWITCH SERVICES.
STARTING IN 2018, Australians will be able to retain usage data from their electricity, banking 
and internet providers, giving consumers more power to compare services and save money.
Called the Consumer Data Right, Aussies can also authorise government agencies to transfer 
the data to other third parties. Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, Angus 
Taylor, said in a statement, “Government is pursuing the very simple idea that the customer 
should own their own data. It is a powerful idea and a very important one. Australians have 
been missing out because it’s too hard to switch to something better. You may be able to access 
your recent banking transactions, or compare this quarter’s energy bill to the last, but it sure

NEED TO KNOW
TWO AUSTRALIAN STATES have commented on the recent ‘loot box’ trend in videogames,
and can’t agree if unseen and random rewards in games bought with real money should be 
considered to be a form of gambling. EA’s recent release, Star Wars: Battlefront II features ‘loot 
boxes’, digital treasure chests that contain rewards to be used in-game, but the contents of 
which are only revealed once you’ve spent actual money on them. While Battlefront II isn’t 
the only game to include them, it’s the most (in)famous example as the rewards can be used to 
improve your character. While speaking to Kotaku, Jarrod Wolfe of the Victorian 
Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, says that “what occurs with ‘loot boxes’ 
does constitute gambling by the definition of the Victorian Legislation,” while Robert 
Grimmond of Queensland’s Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation says “video gaming 
which provides for ‘loot boxes’ would not fall within the meaning of a gaming machine as 
defined under the Gaming Machine Act”. While the controversy rolls on, it’s clear that the 
next game to feature loot boxes will endure more scrutiny.  [ PAUL TAYLOR ]

Aiming to bulldoze net neutrality rules put

State governments unsure if ‘loot boxes’  
in games should be classiﬁed as gambling
VICTORIA AND QUEENSLAND DISAGREE ON THE MONEY-FOR-
PERKS SYSTEM.
IN A RECENT response to an official Productivity Commission, the Australian Government
endorsed the use of VPNs for Aussie consumers wanting to gain access to geoblocked media 
content, stating that doing so could help to reduce piracy. The MPAA (Motion Picture 
Association of America) has responded, firing off a stern warning against the adoption of any 
such laws and claiming that the whole proposal shows “a breathtaking lack of understanding of 
longstanding international norms and the importance of copyright to Australia’s creative 
industries”.
It’s perhaps unsurprising that Hollywood isn’t so keen on some of these laws getting passed. 
Australia is currently paying more than most other regions for its streaming content and in many 
cases is getting it much later, so circumventing geoblocks allows Australians to access movies and 
shows at the same time as other territories, and in some cases unlocks content that would 
otherwise not have been released locally.
The Australian Government thinks that giving the public “affordable access to copyright 
content in a timely manner is a key factor in preventing copyright infringement”, pointing out 
that users who do bypass geoblocking already pay for the service, but that those users would 
possibly resort to piracy if the media was legally unattainable.  [ HARRY DOMANSKI ]

INSIDE TECHLIFE
TECHLIFE IS AUSTRALIA’S most practical 
mainstream technology magazine, having 
been in print since 2012, when we launched  
as a redesigned and modernised version of 
Australian PC User. The latter was first printed
in 1990, and TechLife’s current editor has been 
working for the mag (in both its incarnations) 
for over a decade. We take that 25-year 
heritage seriously and strive to be both ethical 
and transparent in our coverage of technology
and any other topics we broach. 
Like our sister magazine, APC, we have two 
main goals here at TechLife: to track down the 
best of modern tech and to help our readers get
the most from it. We’re also an open church in
terms of platforms. We know most people 
aren’t wed to a single brand’s products and use
a variety of devices in their lives. And like you,
TechLife’s journalists want to know what’s 
good in tech — no matter what platform it 
resides on.  
UNBIASED REVIEWS 
Championing technology doesn’t mean we’re 
unrelentingly positive, however, and our other
aim at TechLife is to be as objective as possible 
in our coverage. That means identifying the 
best products from multiple perspectives — 
the best performance, best value and best

features and, ideally, the products that offer  
the best mix of these three aspects.  
As a matter of policy, reviews published  
in TechLife are not shared with product-
providers prior to print. We will contact 
vendors under certain conditions; if we have  
a problem testing a product that seems to 
indicate it may be faulty, or to invite a vendor 
to clarify how a particular feature works. If a 
TechLife reviewer has any potential conflicts  
of interest involving a brand, the review will 
always be assigned to another writer. 
LABS TESTING 
In order to make our reviews and other stories 
as unbiased as possible, TechLife strives to 
conduct rigorous, objective and scientific tests 
and benchmarks where possible. We use a 
variety of tools and programs to achieve this, 
including many freely available benchmark 
suites for assessing things like general system 
performance, gaming, media encoding and 
battery life. 
In most cases, for the benchmark results 
published in TechLife, you can assume that 
higher is better. There are certain tests that 
deviate from this rule and where the opposite 
is true; in those cases, we’ve flagged the results 
with a note explaining as such.

IMPROVE YOUR LANGUAGE LEARNING SKILLS BY DRINKING 
ALCOHOL (IN MODERATION)
Alcohol can be harmful when consumed in large quantities. However, a Dutch research team has undertaken 
a study that suggests alcohol, when taken in moderation, can actually improve your foreign language skills. 
German students were given either 250ml water or lemon and vodka drinks, then tasked with arguing a point 
in Dutch for two minutes. The students were rated on their performance by native Dutch speakers. Contrary 
to their predictions, Renner and his colleagues found that students who had drunk the alcohol were rated 
higher for their language skills and pronunciation. The reason for this unexpected result is believed to be due 
to alcohol’s ability to reduce anxiety. However, we here at TechLife would like to reiterate Renner’s own 
conclusion — the amount of alcohol is important, and drinking more will result in slurring and general 
stupidity, not a diploma in international studies.
TEXT-SHARING EVERY PROBLEM WITH FRIENDS
COULD BE MAKING YOU MORE ANXIOUS
A TOUCH OF THE FOMOS?
The condition ‘intolerance of uncertainty’ or IU, according to the Journal of Anxiety Disorders,
results from “negative beliefs about uncertainty and its implications” and may be partly
responsible for many anxiety disorders and even depression. According to experts, uncertainty
and learning how to deal with it properly is vital to our mental health. The rise of smartphones,
however, has unintentionally had a negative impact on the ability of many to manage their
FOMO (fear of missing out). Rather than allowing the brain to fully process the facts (and often
rationalise-away any paranoid thoughts), phones constantly give us the opportunity to check
whether someone has read our message or liked our post, or to instantly reply to something
before we, perhaps, entirely understand what was said. This behaviour of repeatedly seeking
reassurance via our phones, increases our overall anxiety levels over time, preventing us from
relying on ourselves.

Like your food salty but

CONSIDER EATING SPICY FOODS INSTEAD!
Consuming too much salt over the course of 
your life can increase your risk of heart disease, 
due to higher blood pressure. According to The 
Heart Foundation, we Aussies are eating too 
much of it. “Salt is used for flavouring,” the 
foundation says, so how can we reduce our salt 
intake without resorting to bland, tasteless 
foods? Well, apart from switching to fresh 
foods that are naturally low in salt (vegetables, 
nuts, meat, fruit and so on), you could also add 
a dash of sriracha or Tabasco. In a recent study 
carried out by the American Heart Association, 
researchers discovered that eating spicy food 
triggers the same parts of the brain (insular and 
orbitofrontal cortices, to be precise) that are 
triggered when the body detects salt. The 
researchers concluded that even adding in 
small amounts of spices to food instead of salt 
could result in health benefits.

MENTAL HEALTH LINKED TO RISK OF EARLY DEATH
The Canadian Medical Association Journal reports that a 60-year-long study 
discovered the risk of an early death is higher in those suffering from 
depression, and women are more susceptible. Although stigma attached to 
mental health issues has reduced, thanks to increased awareness, the trend 
continues. The study found that the risk of an early death associated with 
mental health issues was prevalent throughout the course of the entire 
study, with the risk being strongest in the years immediately following a 
breakdown. This suggests that if patients are in recovery from depression, 
the risk could well be reversed. The researchers also clarified that although 
depression is associated with factors like poor diet and exercise regimes, 
smoking and substance abuse that are detrimental to general health, they 
did not entirely explain the increased risk.
Blue lighting proven to be help relaxation 
after an argument
TAKE A DEEP BREATH... AND SIT UNDER THE BLUE LIGHT.
Science has spoken — the next time you need to de-stress after having 
an argument with someone, all you need do is find the closest room 
with blue lighting. Spanish researchers have proven, after an objective 
evaluation, that blue lighting dramatically encourages relaxation after 
short-term psychological stress (like the stress you feel when pressured 
to complete a task, or after a fight with a loved one). In the study, 
participants with high stress levels were made to lie down in a room 
with white lighting or in a room with blue. The latter was found to 
reduce bio-signals — heart rate and brain activity — much faster than 
white light. Other than finding use in clinical environments, the 
researchers hope that this information will help regular civilians “in 
daily-life context”.

Unless superior cognitive (or analytical) skills are matched with the need for

You might be wondering, like we were, why the likes of Bose — an already well-established

So what are they? The Bose sleepbuds are noise-cancelling earplugs to help you sleep next to  
a snorer, drown out the constant sound of the city or a party going on next door. These 
rechargeable earplugs emit soothing sounds (nature or “other familiar sounds”) through the 
specially-designed eartips, which come in three sizes, and you can alter the volume of your 
relaxing tones via a companion app. You can also set the sleepbuds up with a silent alarm.

IT’S BEEN ABOUT 18 months since
Amazon’s original Kindle Oasis was launched,
a premium ereader that dropped jaws with
its unconventional design — where one side
is considerably thicker than the other —
and rather outlandish price; in Australia,
buying one would set you back $449.
Amazon’s second-gen Oasis ups the ante
in numerous areas and this is a redesign that,
by and large, has definitely been worth it.
This is a premium ereader that finally feels like
it does enough to match its price tag. With an
aluminium body and a matte-finish glass
panel to cover its high-res, 7-inch E Ink display
(adding an inch over its predecessor), the new
Oasis has an almost iPad-like feel that’s both
classy and durable. It’s also the first Kindle to
include water-proofing, where it beats most
flagship smartphones with an IPX8 rating.
And yet despite those improvements,
the price is also more palatable in Australia,
dropping $60 to a slightly more reasonable
$389 for the 8GB model — although opting
for the bigger 32GB model will still set you
back $529.
The asymmetrical design, which gives you a
nice big holding area on one side of the display
and thin bezels everywhere else, is unusual-
looking, but works very well in use. Swap from
holding the Oasis in your left to right hand
(or vice versa) and the screen orientation
automatically flips around to accomodate.
The two dedicated page-turning buttons have
a satisfying and reassuringly stable click
when you press them, and that 7-inch, 300dpi
display is gorgeous, too, rendering text and
images with the same sharp and smooth
results we saw on the first Oasis.
There’s another neat new trick underneath
the Oasis’s hood, too: Audible audiobook
support. There’s a big caveat, though, in that
you can only output audio via Bluetooth —
there are no inbuilt speakers or a 3.5mm
headphone jack, so you’ll need to have a
wireless speaker or set of headphones to use it.
The Oasis isn’t the only premium reader out
there, though. Kobo’s slightly cheaper Aura
ONE offers a 7.8-inch display and the same
water-proofing, but uses a plastic body that,
while durable, lacks the premium feel of the
Oasis. The Kobo does have a couple of
capabilities that make it worth carefully
considering, however. The first is a dedicated
‘night mode’ for backlighting, which changes
the backlight tone from blue-white to orange,
which is less disruptive to sleep. The Oasis has
no such feature — you can adjust brightness,
but the colour-tone is always a neutral white.
A slight concession is Amazon has added
a new optional viewing mode, letting you
reverse convention and have white text on a
black background, which should help reduce
the amount of blue light being bounced into
your eyes.
The other main caveat with Kindle is that
you still can’t borrow library ebooks in
Australia. Our libraries use the Overdrive
system, which the Kobo range of readers
support, but Kindles do not. There’s also
no native integration with a read-it-later
service, like Kobo has with Pocket
(www.getpocket.com), although you can
email stories or use a free service like Pocket 2
Kindle to achieve this.
If you’re an existing Kindle owner that
already owns a wide selection of Amazon
ebooks and are looking for an upgrade,
the new Oasis should be a no-brainer. This is
a fantastic ereader that delivers a premium
reading experience on almost all fronts.
If you haven’t jumped on the ereader boat yet,
however, the Kobo’s Aura ONE is an equally
strong contender, albeit for different reasons.
Consider carefully.

Get psyched: Daydreaming
GO ON, DAYDREAM — IT WILL MAKE YOU SMARTER.
[ SHARMISHTA SARKAR ]
EVER CATCH YOURSELF drifting slowly but 
surely into a different world while someone’s 
having a conversation with you? Or even when 
doing dishes, or while at work? Not to worry, 
we’ve all been there and done that. But have 
you ever wondered why we have this tendency 
to drift off into a daydream, or what a 
daydream actually is?
Wikipedia defines daydreaming as “a 
short-term detachment from one’s immediate 
surroundings, during which a person’s contact 
with reality is blurred and partially substituted 
by a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, 
pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, 
imagined as coming to pass, and experienced 
while awake.” Despite the “happy thoughts” 
though, daydreaming generally has a bad rap, 
being associated with laziness and “a bad use 
of mental power,” says Dr Muireann Irish, who 
studies the neurobiology of daydreaming at 
Neuroscience Research Australia. Everyone 
does it, however, with experts suggesting about 
half our waking lives is spent daydreaming. 
That indicates an evolutionary advantage lies 
behind the act.
THE BENEFITS OF DAYDREAMING
In a world that appreciates the go-getters, 
daydreaming is frowned upon. But what few 
know is that having your head in the clouds 
can actually be good for you. There’s a few 
benefits that have even been specifically 
identified by scientific studies.
* It bolsters brain power: Mind wandering 
has been found to give the brain’s memory 
a truly terrific workout. Scientists have 
learned that people who perform simple 
tasks (like washing the dishes) while 
daydreaming are able to retain more 
information during a memorisation test. 
And the more you’re able to juggle 
daydreaming with these kinds of simple 
tasks, the better your ability to zone out 
and yet still remember details or focus on 
a more complex project. This increase in 
retention power can help provide a boost 
in general intelligence too. So the more 
you daydream while doing something, the 
sharper your mind will be.
* It boosts creativity: Many renowned 
super-intelligent and amazingly creative 
people like Albert Einstein and the Bronte 
sisters had their best ‘a-ha’ moments when 
daydreaming. Research has found that 
mentally breaking away after a complex 
creative task has been completed can, 
subsequently, boost creativity by up to 
40% when starting the next project.
* It alleviates stress: This isn’t backed by 
science, yet, but because it is essentially a 
mind-calming technique, daydreaming 
can lower blood pressure and heart rate, 
reducing stress-related symptoms.
THE DARK SIDE
Despite the obvious advantages of 
daydreaming, it’s best to err on the side of 
caution, because even though by definition 
daydreaming is about happy thoughts, it has 
been reported that some people are less happy 
when their mind has wandered. Other studies 
have flagged that people are wont to drift off 
when they’ve got the blues, so to speak, and 
this could lead to feelings of depression.
That said, the human mind is quite pliable, 
and people can be trained to think happier 
thoughts — a study conducted in the 1980s 
and published in the journal Behaviour 
Research and Therapy found that if people 
spent a fixed time (say about half an hour) 
worrying about whatever they wanted to 
worry about, they ended up spending less 
time worrying spontaneously.

DEVICES WITH NEAR-MAGICAL language-
translation capabilities are one of those tropes 
that’ve been a sci-fi staple since the original 
Star Trek’s Universal Translator — Google 
even named its first online translator ‘Babel 
fish’ after the small yellow fish from  
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy which, 
when inserted into a user’s ear canal, spat out 
alien languages in the native user’s tongue.
Well, the search giant’s now taken that homage 
to another level with its first set of Google-
branded headphones, the Pixel Buds. 
These are largish earbud-style headphones 
connected together via a braided cord and, 
unlike most of today’s in-ear headphones,  
they don’t come with detachable rubber tips  
to get the right (tight) fit for your ear. Instead, 
they’re designed to ‘hang’ in the same manner 
as regular earbuds, although the braided cord 
also has a small loop section, which is meant  
to be resized and tucked into your ear to help 
keep them in place.
While the fact that these aren’t in-ear 
monitor (or ‘canalphones’) style buds means 
they don’t isolate outside noise as well as 
others, they do deliver nice crowd-pleasing 
audio that offers a warm and phatt lower-end 
but maintains enough clarity that you don’t 
feel like you’re missing any detail.
The right bud also houses touch-sensitive 
controls, which somewhat helps justify their 
rather bulbous design. You can swipe up  
or down to change volume, tap to pause or 
resume playback, and tap twice for a Google 
Assistant-powered general info update. Lastly, 
you can tap and hold to issue commands to 
Assistant, eliminating the need to speak the 
usual “OK, Google” command phrase... 
although that doesn’t entirely remove the 
stigma attached to issuing commands to your 
phone in public.
We had a somewhat mixed experience with 
the Buds when it came to fit. While the left bud 
didn’t pose us any serious problems, we 
constantly had trouble getting the right-hand 
bud to sit properly, 
requiring a lot of 
fiddling each time  
we put it in to get 
audio projecting into 
our ear correctly. 
To its credit, Google 
has got a few things 
very right with these 
buds. The magnetic 
carry case is 
particularly excellent, 
making it quick and 
easy to both neatly 
stash the Buds away 
and get them out again; it’s also how you
charge the earbuds, and there’s a backup 
battery inside that’s good for an estimated  
24 hours of extra runtime.
So what about those real-time translation 
smarts? Well, they’re actually provided via the 
Google Translate app — and you’ll also need 
to be using a Google Pixel handset (any of  
the four available models) for this feature to 
function properly. So does it actually work? 
Well, while it’s not going to eliminate the need 
to learn a new language just yet, it will let you 
have functional, if stilted, conversations across 
40 languages. With the Google Translate app 
open, the Buds-user taps and holds the right 
bud and speaks a phrase in their native 
language, with the Translate app on your Pixel 
phone automatically translating and then 
speaking out the foreign-language equivalent 
(or as close as it can get) through your 
smartphone’s speaker. Inversely, it can also 
decode a foreign 
language spoken into 
the phone’s mic,  
and play the spoken 
translation back 
through the Pixel 
Buds. With any other 
set of earbuds, this 
feature doesn’t seem  
to work, with all audio 
blaring through the 
phone’s speaker. 
The Pixel Buds 
make translation  
a less awkward and 
more rewarding process, but nevertheless, 
they’re somewhat stilted by Google’s own 
Translate app, and the uniqueness of this 
feature is somewhat undermined by the fact 
that you need a Pixel phone to use it. That 
makes the audience for these rather narrow 
— and, frankly, there are better-sounding  
and cheaper in-ears out there (like the Jaybird 
Freedom 2’s we’ve reviewed on page 53),  
which are much easier to recommend.

WHEN WINDOWS 10 launched back in 2015,
Microsoft promised that this would be the
ultimate version of Windows that will
continue to get new features and major
updates well into the future, and it’s stayed
true to its word with the release of the Fall
Creators Update (released in our spring) —
the most recent package of new features
that’s available to download for free.
Following on from this year’s earlier
Creators Update and last year’s Anniversary
Update, the Fall Creators Update brings a wide
range of new features and tools that makes
Windows 10 even better. As the name
suggests, many of these new features are
geared towards creative pursuits, such as
editing your home videos and photos, and
exploring 3D worlds in mixed reality, but it 
also brings some more serious, behind-the-
scenes, updates that make Windows 10
even more secure.
There are loads of new and exciting features
in the Fall Creators Update, so we’ve put
together this five-page guide that explores the
biggest changes, and how they can transform
the way you use Windows 10. Of course, it’s no
good just banging on about the new features if
you aren’t able to use them, so we’ll also show
you how you download and install the Fall
Creators Update right now, without having to
wait for your computer to update itself.
The Fall Creators Update is a free update for
all Windows 10 users, and it’s been tested by
Microsoft and a range of volunteers, so you
should be able to download and install it 
without experiencing any issues.
[ INCOMING! ]
Windows 10 Fall Creators 
Update explained
THE FALL CREATORS UPDATE IS HERE!
THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.

[ WWW.TECHLIFE.NET ]
[ 021 ]
Installing the Update
THE FALL CREATORS UPDATE SHOULD MAKE YOUR WINDOWS 10 PC 
BETTER THAN EVER — HERE ARE THE STEPS YOU NEED TO TAKE 
FOR A HAPPY AND HASSLE-FREE UPGRADE.
ONE OF THE most pleasing results of 
Microsoft’s determination to make 
Windows 10 the ultimate version of its 
operating system is that you get a 
constantly evolving OS that’s continually 
getting new features for free — rather 
than having to pay for a new iteration 
every five years. It also means you don’t 
need to worry about compatibility — if 
your PC or device is able to run Windows 
10, you’ll be able to install and run the 
Fall Creators Update as well.
As with previous major updates to 
Windows 10, such as the Anniversary 
Update, Microsoft will be rolling out the 
Fall Creators Update as an automatic 
update in waves. This means that, for 
many people, you won’t need to do 
anything to get the Fall Creators Update 
— Windows 10 will quietly download it 
when you’re doing something else, then 
will inform you when the update is ready 
to be installed.
By releasing the update in waves,  
it does mean you may have to wait for the
update to appear. This isn’t necessarily  
a bad thing, since it means Microsoft’s 
servers aren’t being hammered by 
millions of users wanting to get the 
update right away. It also enables 
Microsoft to monitor the success of the 
software, and catch any bugs or issues.  
If some arise, Microsoft can get to work 
fixing those while the update rolls out.
CHANGING YOUR MIND
ONCE YOU’VE INSTALLED THE FALL CREATORS
UPDATE, YOU’RE GIVEN A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS
TO TEST OUT THE NEW FEATURES.
If, during that time, you don’t like the update, or there
are problems that prevent your PC from working,
then you can easily roll back to a previous version
of Windows 10.
To do this, go to ‘Settings > Update & security >
Recovery’ and click on ‘Get started’ under where it says
‘Go back to the previous version of Windows 10’.
A window will appear asking you why you want to revert
to a previous version. Answer the question (this helps
Microsoft improve future versions of Windows), then
click ‘No, thanks’ from the next window. This is where
you’ll be asked you if you want to check for any updates.
Click ‘Next’ on the window that follows, then ‘Next’
again, making sure you have your Windows login
details handy. Then click ‘Go back to earlier build’
and the Fall Creators Update will uninstall itself.
After the 10-day ‘trial’ period has elapsed, you won’t be able to roll back  
the Fall Creators Update — you’ll need to do a full Windows 10 reinstall instead.
If you are eager to try out the Fall Creators 
Update and don’t want to wait for the rollout 
to reach your device, we don’t blame you, and 
thankfully, there is an easy way to download 
and install the update yourself. Check out our 
step-by-step guide on the following page that 
will take you through the process.
PREPARING FOR THE UPDATE
Whether you wait for the update to reach you 
via Microsoft’s rollout, or you manually 
You’ll need to make sure you install the correct version 
of the Fall Creators Update for your processor.
FEATURE
WINDOWS 10 FALL CREATORS UPDATE EXPLAINED

[ 022 ]
download and install the Fall Creators 
Update, you should make sure that your 
device, and the important files and 
documents you store on it, are backed up 
and ready for the update. After all, this is  
a major update to your device’s operating 
system, and while it’s unlikely that anything 
will go wrong, you don’t want to put your 
irreplaceable files at risk unnecessarily.  
So the first thing you should do is make sure 
you have copies of any documents or photos 
you do not want to lose. This can be done by 
either copying the files to an external hard 
drive or USB flash drive, or by making sure 
the files are also stored on a cloud service, 
such as OneDrive, which is built into 
Windows 10, or the likes of Dropbox  
or Google Drive.
You’ll also want to make sure that your 
hard drive has enough space to download 
and install the Fall Creators Update. 
Microsoft recommends at least 16GB of 
space for the 32-bit version, and 20GB for 
the 64-bit version. Before installing the Fall 
Creators Update, you’ll need to know which 
version you’ll need. This is determined by 
whether or not your device has a 32-bit or 
64-bit processor. As a general rule, most 
modern devices will have a 64-bit processor, 
but you can double-check to be sure by 
typing “System” into the Search box on the 
Taskbar (next to the Start menu button).
In the window that appears, there should 
be a setting labelled System. From there, 
you’ll see ‘System type’ and it is here that 
Windows 10 will state whether it is 32-bit or 
64-bit. Once you know which version you’re 
using, you can follow the guide below for 
installing the Fall Creators Update.
AFTER INSTALLING THE UPDATE
Once you’ve downloaded and successfully 
installed the Windows 10 Fall Creators 
Update, you can quickly check to make sure 
you’re running the update correctly by 
opening the Start Menu and clicking on the 
Settings button (the icon which looks like  
a cog). Click System, then About at the 
bottom of the left-hand menu. Under where  
it says ‘Windows specifications’, there will  
be a number next to where it says Version. 
The Fall Creators Update is version 1709,  
so if that number, or one higher than that,  
is displayed, then the Fall Creators Update 
has been successfully installed on your PC  
or other Windows device. As with any major 
update to an operating system, there may be  
a few bugs or issues that need to be ironed out 
early in its life. In the Search box on the 
Taskbar, type in “Windows Update” and then 
select ‘Check for updates’. If there are any 
further updates available, install them,  
since they may contain fixes for any problems 
you’re experiencing or could encounter — 
another reason to back up your PC! 
01  
WINDOWS UPDATE
The easiest way to download and 
install the Fall Creators Update is to 
use the Windows Update tool. Type “Windows 
Update” in the Search box on the Taskbar, then 
select ‘Check for updates’. If The Fall Creators 
Update is ready to be installed on your machine, 
it will appear here. Click to install the update,  
and follow the onscreen instructions. Your PC  
will need to restart, so make sure any open 
documents are saved before you begin.
03  
A FRESH INSTALL
If you want a fresh install of the Fall 
Creators Update, you’ll need to download 
an ISO file with it included. This will wipe all your 
files and settings, so make sure they are backed up 
first. Go to the Download Windows 10 web page 
(tinyurl.com/tla72-discimage), and where it says 
‘Create Windows 10 installation media’, click the 
‘Download tool now’ button. You’ll need a blank 
DVD or a USB flash drive with 5GB of free space  
for the files. 
02  
UPDATE ASSISTANT
If the Fall Creators Update doesn’t appear 
in Windows Update, then it means 
Microsoft hasn’t rolled out the update to your device 
yet. Don’t worry, as Microsoft provides a tool for 
starting the upgrade manually, called the Update 
Assistant. Go to tinyurl.com/tla72-update and click 
‘Update now’ to download it, then check for the 
latest version of Windows 10. Once downloaded,  
run it, then select ‘Update Now’. The tool will  
do the rest.

THE FALL CREATORS UPDATE BRINGS MIXED REALITY, FLUENT DESIGN AND BETTER
 BATTERY LIFE TO YOUR PC — READ ON TO FIND OUT THESE FEATURES CAN HELP YOU.
NOW THAT THE Fall Creators Update has 
been downloaded and installed on your 
PC, the fun begins — checking out all  
the cool new things that Microsoft has 
included. There’s a huge amount of new 
features included in this update, so we will 
focus on the most exciting additions.
WINDOWS MIXED REALITY
Probably the most incredible feature to 
have been added to Windows 10 with the 
Fall Creators Update, Windows Mixed 
Reality has the potential to change the way 
you interact with your PC in future. 
Essentially, it enables you to use Windows 
10 and various apps in a virtual reality 
(VR) setting. A number of big name 
brands, such as ASUS, Dell, HP and 
Lenovo have already created special 
headsets for Windows Mixed Reality. 
You can explore Windows and its 
various Mixed Reality apps with the 
Mixed Reality Portal, which enables you 
to walk around a virtual home, and 
launch things from inside the home. 
Paint 3D, Microsoft’s reimagining of its
classic Paint software that was brought in
with the earlier Creators Update, has also
been given a slight revamp with the Fall 
Creators Update, and now enables you  
to create 3D artwork and view it in 3D  
in either a virtual reality setting using the
headset, or placed in the real world using 
MIXED REALITY HEADSETS
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING NEW FEATURES OF THE
FALL CREATORS UPDATE IS SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS
MIXED REALITY, AND TO COINCIDE WITH THE LAUNCH
OF THE UPDATE, A NUMBER OF BIG NAMES IN THE
COMPUTING WORLD HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR DEVICES.
For example, the Acer Windows Mixed Reality head-
mounted display (HMD) launched at $649, while the Dell
Visor can be bought for $799. Both of these prices are well
below the asking price of the HTC Vive kit ($999), and close
9
to the Oculus Rift. Other Mixed Reality headsets include the
HP Windows Mixed Reality Headset, the Lenovo Explorer,
the ASUS Windows Mixed Reality Headset and the Samsung
HMD Odyssey.
With this early support for Windows Mixed Reality from
these brands, it’s clear there’s a lot of faith in Microsoft’s
new augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) platform —
and we should see even more Mixed Reality devices become
available in the very near future.
Windows Mixed Reality mixes augmented reality and virtual reality tech to bring you a whole 
new way to interact with your PC — and gadget makers are already getting onboard.
Cortana has its own settings page now, for easy access.
augmented reality (AR). This doesn’t need 
any fancy headsets — you can simply use a 
Windows 10 laptop or tablet with a back-
facing camera. The camera captures the real 
world, while Windows 10’s Mixed Reality 
Viewer app intelligently places the 3D model 
into the real-world image displayed on the 
device’s screen. You can even move your 
device around to view the model from 
different angles.
IMPROVED EDGE BROWSER
If you use Edge, Microsoft’s default web browser 
in Windows 10, then you’re going to love the 
Creators Fall Update, since it brings a number  
of new features to the software. You can once 
again pin your favourite websites to the Taskbar 
for easy access, and the browser can handle PDF 
files and ebooks better as well, making it a very 
versatile tool. So if you have a stylus, you can 
now write on and annotate PDF and ebooks 
WINDOWS 10 FALL CREATORS UPDATE EXPLAINED

— useful if you’re using your device for 
studying, and you can also open and fill out 
PDF forms. As for ebooks, your reading 
progress is synced with your Microsoft 
account, so you can carry on from where 
you left off when you switch to another 
device! Neat.
CORTANA IS BETTER THAN EVER
Microsoft has continued to invest in 
Cortana, the virtual personal assistant  
that made her debut with the first version  
of Windows 10, and she’s now smarter —  
and more useful — than ever before. You can 
now tweak Cortana from her new section  
in the Settings app, and the virtual assistant 
can now access your photos and recognise 
certain aspects of them, thanks to machine 
learning, enabling you to use Cortana to find 
particular photos faster. She can even tag 
them for you.
You can also ask Cortana to control your 
PC, so you can say “Hey, Cortana, restart 
PC” or “Hey, Cortana, lock PC,” and she 
will do your bidding.
BETTER BATTERY LIFE
The Fall Creators Update should also help 
prolong the life of the battery of your device. 
It does this thanks to a clever new feature 
known as Power Throttling, which enables 
Windows to control your processor, putting 
it into a low-power state when it’s not doing 
anything too taxing. By dropping the power 
consumption of the CPU — Microsoft claims 
it can reduce processor usage by up to 11% 
— your battery life could see a little bit of 
improvement. 
Programs and apps that are running 
quietly in the background will have their 
processor power throttled, while programs 
that you’re currently using — and which 
need plenty of oomph to work smoothly —  
won’t be affected, so you should not see any 
nasty side effects as a result of this feature.
Power Throttling is turned on 
automatically when you set your PC to 
Battery Saver or Recommended mode  
in Windows 10. If you choose Best 
Performance, it’s disabled.
IMPROVED INTERFACE
Microsoft has been working hard on 
improving the look and feel of Windows 10, 
and you can see some of the fruits of the 
company’s labours with the Fall Creators 
Update. Known as Fluent Design, this new 
look uses transparency effects to make 
Windows 10 look better, while being easier 
to use. The Start menu has seen elements  
of Fluent Design added, and it can now  
be resized horizontally and vertically.  
The Action Centre (which appears on  
the right side of the screen) has also been 
given a new look.  
The Action Centre is now even clearer and easier to use.
01  
A NEW STORE
Remember the Windows Store,  
that had an icon on your Taskbar and 
allowed you to install Windows apps? You’ll 
notice that, with the Fall Creators Update, the 
icon is no longer there — instead, there’s a new 
icon that leads you to the Microsoft Store. Don’t 
worry, it’s essentially the same as before, it’s just 
that Microsoft has rebranded it so that it fits in 
with its non-Windows products — such as the 
Xbox One — as well.
03  
BUY FROM THE STORE
Once you’ve found what you’re looking 
for, you’ll be taken to a new page where 
you’ll see additional information. If you choose  
a game and see it is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, 
you’ll also be able to play it on your Xbox One —  
and you won’t need to pay for a second copy!  
If the app or game costs money, the price will also 
be shown. Click the Buy button and follow the 
instructions to pay for the selection and install  
the app or game on your PC. 
02  
SEARCH THE STORE
Click on the icon to open the Microsoft 
Store and you’ll see the home page.  
This lists the top apps and games for you. Clicking 
on a tile will take you to more information. You can 
also browse by category: Apps shows you the 
Windows Apps available; Games if you fancy a break 
from working. Music and Films & TV lets you buy or 
rent media. To find a particular app, game or media, 
type the name in the Search box at the top-right  
of the window.

IT CAN BE incredibly frustrating to buy a 
product or app, only to have it end up heavily
discounted a short time later. Alternatively,
if it is something you don’t need in a hurry,
waiting for a price drop or big discount can
really pay off. Manually checking prices 
yourself is extremely tedious, but fortunately
for us, there is a huge range of apps and 
websites devoted to helping consumers nab
the best deal. We’ve put them to the test, and
compiled this handy guide on using the best
of them. It should go without saying by now,
but the best site Down Under for community-
driven bargain hunting is OzBargain. 
PRODUCT PRICE DROPS
It is surprisingly hard to find a good price 
tracker, with no dedicated Australian options. 
While we were still waiting for Amazon AU  
to lauch at the time of writing this feature,  
if you’re using Amazon US or UK,  
CamelCamelCamel (camelcamelcamel.com)  
makes it easy to monitor for price drops.  
But for keeping track of prices on AU websites, 
Price Owlert (www.priceowlert.com) is by far 
the best option. The system tracks price 
changes using a smart bookmark, so works  
in any browser and no software needs to be

downloaded. It’s also totally free and works  
on most websites. To use Price Owlert, enter 
an email, then add the smart bookmark to 
your browser bar. To monitor a specific price, 
browse your online retailer of choice until  
you find a product that you want to monitor. 
Then simply highlight the price and click the 
bookmark. Owlert will grab the price and 
provide some options, such as a target price, 
for the alert. No account is needed but having 
one gives extra options to view and manage 
alerts. Of course, Owlert isn’t perfect and has  
a number of drawbacks. For a start, it can only
monitor the specific price you select, and can’t 
automatically compare prices for the product 
elsewhere. It also can only monitor the price 
for where it is displayed by default — it won’t 
work if any information (such as location) is 
needed before the price can be viewed. It also 
does not work on some websites, such as eBay. 
iOS
For Apple users, there are a number of options 
available to track the price of apps and other 
content. A great place to start is AppShopper 
(appshopper.com), which actually searches 
iOS and Mac apps. It’s easy to set up wishlists 
and alerts for price drops, as well as shop by

EBAY
Still by far the largest online marketplace in
Australia, eBay is full of bargains. While you
can’t monitor for price drops exactly,
a custom saved search can do a similar job.
Just search for the item you want, then select
the price range you are waiting for. From
there, you can save the search by clicking
the heart icon next to the number of search
results. For example, you might want a
Chromecast Ultra for $70, when the
cheapest price is $85. Simply set the
maximum price to $70 on the search then
save the search. Often, you will need to be
specific with search terms to eliminate false
results, such as charger cables and so on.
It’s also worth selecting ‘Buy It Now’ to weed
out auctions and setting a minimum price.
eBay will then send an email when a product
is listed under your target price.
A simpler option to do the same job
is Auction Sensor (auctionsensor.com),
which allows custom alerts based on price.
Handily, it can also filter by Newly Modified

for price drops. 
free apps, or ones that have had a recent price 
drop. A more in depth option is App Sliced 
(appsliced.co) which works as an alternative 
App Store experience. Going beyond just 
tracking price changes, it actually gives price 
buying advice for apps, shows pricing history 
and, of course, has price drop alerts. 
GOOGLE PLAY
While it’s possible to search by free apps, in 
general, Google Play does not make it easy to 
find cheap content. App Sales (app-sales.net) 
makes things easier, showing sales and apps 
that are newly free. To get the full benefit,  
you need to install the free app, which gives 
options for custom filters, watchlists and alerts 
so you never miss a discounted app again.  
For those who want more of a community 
focus (but no alerts), the subreddit Google Play 
Deals (reddit.com/r/googleplaydeals)  
is worth checking out. 
CREDIT CARD PRICE PROTECTION
While it doesn’t matter much for apps or other 
small purchases, it can be very frustrating 
seeing that new laptop on sale for hundreds  
of dollars cheaper than you bought it just one 
month ago. Many credit cards have a solution 
— Price Protection Insurance. In a nutshell,  
if the item purchased is available cheaper after 
your purchase, the credit card company will 
refund the difference. Depending on the credit 
card, there are loads of stipulations, such as 
time limits and maximum refunds, and some 
charge extra for the insurance. But considering 
the typical discount cycle for technology,  
a refund can easily save hundreds of dollars 
with little effort. A great place to learn more 
and compare credit card offers is at financial 
comparison site Canastar (goo.gl/B3hYNk).
FLIGHTS
Nothing is more frustrating than trying to get 
the cheapest flight, as prices can change at a 
moment’s notice and bargains often need to be 
bought very quickly before they sell out. Don’t 
forget, airlines and some price comparison 
sites track your visits with cookies, and can 
show higher prices if you keep coming back. 
To get around this, clear cookies or visit flight 
sites with a browser mode that does not save 
cookies, such as Chrome and Incognito.  
One of our favourite flight comparison sites, 
which includes alerts for great deals, is Adioso 
(adioso.com). You do need to sign up to get 
the full benefit, and make sure to delve around 
to find all the features.  
Android users after a bargain should look no further 
than AppSales, which can create custom watchlists 
and notifications for Google Play app price drops. 
AppSliced is a totally new way to browse 
the iOS app store, with a focus on finding 
and tracking the best prices. 
eBay can be hard to monitor for price

TP-Link NC260
UN UPDATE TO THE EXCELLENT NC250.
AVAILABLE FOR ABOUT $20 more ($100) 
than the NC250 (opposite), the TP-Link 
NC260 is well worth the extra cost. The 
cameras share the same 1/4-inch CMOS 
sensor, with a 1,280 x 720 resolution. But the 
NC260 increases the field of view (FOV) to 
113°, for much better coverage. Image quality 
is quite good, and it also has a microphone  
for audio recording. The camera has 802.11n 
Wi-Fi built in for easy network connectivity, 
but also sports a LAN port for a wired 
connection. The NC260 has built-in night 
vision, as well as motion and sound detection. 
The camera can be used as a standalone unit 
— sending a notification if movement is 
detected, and offering remote viewing. It also 
has a SD card slot for local recording. TP also 
has a top-notch (is somewhat simplistic) 
monitoring app that also enables two-way 
communications using a speaker built into the 
camera. Included in the package is a DC power 
extension cable, which makes it easier to install 
the camera without buying any extras. 
IP Webcam
IS THE ULTIMATE IP CAMERA APP?
IP CAMERAS CAN be bought quite cheaply, 
but still can’t compete the price of IP Webcam 
— free. Sure, you do need a spare or old 
Android phone to run it on, but even buying  
a (cheap) brand new model is still very 
affordable. More importantly, using an app 
and phone gives a much higher quality and 
powerful IP webcam. The tradeoff is ease of 
use, as the app is a bit more hands-on to get up 
and running. The resolution is limited by your 
phone’s camera, but 1080p+ is typical, and the 
app can handle motion detection and send 
alerts. You can also record to the device,  
a NAS or even cloud storage such as Dropbox. 
The app even enables two way audio and can 
integrate into other services, such as Tasker. 
Of course, there is no IR night vision mode, 
but you can remotely activate the phone’s 
torch. Thanks to the inbuilt battery, your 
webcam also keeps working through any 
power cuts. The app also has features geared 
towards baby and pet monitoring.

INCREASINGLY AFFORDABLE IP Cameras 
can be a great way to monitor your home 
and provide some extra security. But they 
also offer a host of other features, from 
checking if packages have been delivered  
to keeping an eye on kids or pets. The latest 
cameras don’t need dedicated recording 
systems — they are completely self- 
contained. Better yet, they use a tablet or 
smartphone to view and record the footage, 
and can be accessed from anywhere with  
an internet connection. The better models 
can even send you an alert when something 
suss is going on, and automatically start 
recording. Typically, they connect to your 
network with Wi-Fi, so the only cables that 
need to be run are for power. This also 
means they are easily moved around,  
or can be used by renters without having to 
permanently install anything. While there 
are loads of very expensive options, we have 
tested 10 of the most affordable IP cameras 
that will get you started for under $150.

TP-Link NC450
A HIGHER-END OPTION.
TP-LINK OFFERS A vast array of network 
cameras at very affordable prices, and available 
for just $129, the NC450 is no exception. 
Designed for indoor use, the camera has  
pan and tilt, which allows it to view 360° 
horizontally and 150° vertically. The NC450 
can be mounted on the roof or wall, or just on 
a desktop, for flexible install options. Combine 
that with a 1,280 x 720 resolution and 75-inch 
FOV, and it can easily monitor more than two 
fixed cameras. It connects to your network  
via 802.11n Wi-Fi, but also has a LAN port  
for a wired connection. The NC450 can be 
controlled via the excellent tpCamera app, 
which includes two way communications.  
It also has motion and sound sensing, and can 
send smartphone and email alerts. The camera 
isn’t limited to day use either, with built-in 
night vision with an 8m range. While footage 
can be viewed and saved remotely, the camera 
can also take up to a 128GB SD card for local 
recording. 
Uniden Guardian App  
Cam 25
FOR OUTDOOR USE.
AT THE MORE expensive end of the affordable 
range, the Cam 25 is a standalone solution. 
While its more expensive big brother includes 
pan and tilt, the App Cam 25 has a fixed, but 
weatherproof housing for mounting outside 
your house. It also includes Wi-Fi, so no need 
to run network cables. The Cam 25 connects  
to your smartphone via a fairly comprehensive 
app, so doesn’t need a NAS or other recording 
device. This makes remote viewing very easy, 
though the camera can also record to an SD 
card onboard. The camera has an inbuilt PIR 
sensor, and can send push notifications and 
email alerts if triggered. The 720p resolution  
is decent, and the camera records quite usable, 
but not outstanding footage. It also includes 
infrared LEDs for night vision, making it ideal 
to monitor a front door or garage. 
While not suited for those building a larger 
security system, the App Cam 25 (and 26)  
is a great choice for simple but effective home 
monitoring.

BUYER’S CHECKLIST
THE KEY SPECS, FEATURES AND 
TERMINOLOGY YOU NEED TO KNOW 
WHEN BUYING A WIRELESS  
SECURITY CAM
WI-FI
All the IP cameras tested include inbuilt 
Wi-Fi, but some also have wired connections 
for areas with poor signal.
RESOLUTION
A 1,280 x 720p resolution is most common  
in affordable IP cameras, and it’s best to 
avoid older 640 x 480 models.
NIGHT VISION
While not strictly necessary, IR night vision  
is very handy for security monitoring  
in the dark and is included on all but the 
cheapest cameras.
APP CONTROL
The IP cameras tested all can be controlled 
remotely via a smartphone app, and can  
be operated without any other form of 
recording device.
MOTION SENSING
The better cameras can automatically detect 
movement (and audio), and start recording, 
as well as send an alert to your phone or 
email account.
TWO WAY COMMUNICATIONS
While most of the cameras have 
microphones, the best include a speaker 
that enables two-way communications  
from the control app.
CLOUD RECORDING
Local or phone recording is fine, but being 
able to save your footage directly the cloud 
makes life a lot easier, but is not always free.
PAN AND TILT
Despite being more expensive, pan and tilt 
cameras can give a lot more coverage and 
provide excellent value for money.

D-Link DCS-932L
IS IT WORTH SAVING SOME MONEY?
BRINGING THE PRICE down to just $80,  
the D-Link DCS-932L has to make a few 
sacrifices. For a start, the resolution is lower 
than we’d like at 640 x 480, and the camera 
records at a maximum of 20fps. While it does 
record audio, the unit does not have a speaker, 
so two-way communications are not possible. 
It also doesn’t have an SD card slot, so can’t 
record video locally. On the plus side, it can be 
linked to a network via 802.11n Wi-Fi or a 
wired connection. The app is also excellent, 
and makes it easy to manage the camera and 
remotely view and record footage. The image 
quality is quite usable, but not outstanding, 
though the 4x digital zoom leaves it looking 
very pixelated. The camera can provide motion 
detection alerts, but can’t be triggered by 
sound. The 932L includes night vision,  
with a 5m range. 
For those who want to save even more 
money, the $50 DCS-930L has virtually the 
same spec, minus the night vision. 
D-Link DCS-700L
AKA, THE WI-FI BABY CAMERA JR. 
AS THE NAME suggests, the DCS-700L is 
aimed at those who want a smarter baby 
monitor. The unit links to a smartphone either 
directly, or via your home Wi-Fi, so can be 
accessed even when on the go. The camera 
itself is somewhat uninspiring, with a 640 x 
480p resolution at 30fps. Still, image quality  
is reasonable and the night vision is good 
— though trying to use the full 4x digital 
zoom is a letdown. Still, the real drawcard is 
the baby-focused features, such as a large 
speaker for better quality when using the two 
way communications. The mydlink Baby App 
is also very parent focused, compared to the 
sual security offerings, and is very easy to use. 
The camera will alert you if the baby cries or 
moves, and you can grab snapshots remotely. 
It even has a range of built-in lullabies that can 
be remotely activated, to help sooth an upset 
baby. While the camera spec itself is on the  
low side considering the price, the baby 
monitoring features make up for it. 
Jaycar Wi-Fi IP Camera
A VERSATILE OPTION.
AVAILABLE FOR $120, the Jaycar Wi-Fi 
camera has all the features needed for easy 
home or small office monitoring. It features a 
typical 1/4-inch CMOS sensor, recording at 
25fps and a 1,280 x 720p resolution. It has a 
wide 110° field of view, IR LEDs for night use, 
as well as a microphone for audio recording. 
Connectivity is via inbuilt Wi-Fi, with no 
wired option available. 
The Jaycar camera is designed to be able to 
be used as a standalone unit, linking up to a 
smartphone or Windows PC for viewing and 
control. The included app can be a touch 
fiddly, but is overall very usable. It also enables 
motion sensing with alerts if anything is 
detected. The camera has a built in speaker,  
so can be used for two way communications  
as well. You can also record video to an 
onboard SD card, for later viewing. 
While a touch fiddly to get setup, the Jaycar 
IP Camera has a solid range of features, and 
very usable image quality for the price.

Smanos IP6 HD
USING A HIGH QUALITY SENSOR.
WITH SOME SAVVY online shopping, the 
Smanos IP6 HD can be bought for around 
$110, but otherwise costs up to $200. The 
camera uses Sony 1/3-inch CMOS sensor, with 
a normal 1,280 x 720p resolution, a 110° FOV 
and the ability to record at 30fps. It connects 
via 802.11n Wi-Fi (with no wired option)  
but can also save footage to a microSD card 
(not included). It also records audio, and has  
a speaker for two-way communications.  
The camera comes with an adjustable stand, 
for easy mounting. Control is via a free 
Android or iOS app, though we found the 
setup process somewhat fiddly. 
Frustratingly, the IP6 does not have built-in 
motion detection, and instead relies on being 
part of a larger Smanos security system.  
That means for standalone use, that recording 
has to be triggered manually. Still, the camera 
has some of the best image quality of the 
models tested. Low-light performance is 
particularly good, and it has IR illumination 
for use in total darkness.
Swann ADS-446 
AFFORDABLE PAN AND TILT.
THE ADS-446 IS one of the more affordable 
pan and tilt options available, and can be 
picked up for $120 from Officeworks. It has a 
decent 1,280 x 720p resolution, can record at 
up to 30fps and includes IR night vision.  
The camera can pan through 350°, and tilt up 
to 100°, and is controlled via smartphone or 
Windows/Mac app. 
It also has a microphone for audio 
recording, but no speaker, ruling out two-way 
communications. The camera links into your 
network via Wi-Fi or a wired connection, and 
also has a mini HDMI output. The ADS-446 
has a built in movement sensor and can record 
video and send alerts when triggered — 
including if the camera is tampered with. 
Frustratingly, the inbuilt SD card slot is not 
usable, and recording can only be done to the 
Swan cloud server, where anything more than 
a day of recording costs extra.
Despite a QR code system to link it onto  
the network the ADS-446 was fiddly to set up, 
image quality is quite good. 
TP-Link NC210
A BARGAIN CAMERA.
WHAT THE TP-LINK NC210 lacks in features, 
it more than makes up for with a bargain price 
as low as $50. Just like the more expensive 
NC260, the camera uses a 1/4-inch CMOS 
sensor, with a very competitive 1,280 x 720p 
resolution and wide 113° field of view.  
The 20fps frame rate is slower than the 30 
from the higher priced competition, and there 
is no IR night vision included. It also records 
audio, but does not support two-way audio. 
The NC210 has 802.11n Wi-Fi built in,  
but drops the wired connection to save  
a little money. 
The camera works with the excellent 
tpCamera app, which makes it easy to monitor 
what’s going, as well as record video and take 
photos. It also has motion and sound detection 
built in, and can send you a notification via 
email or the app if there is an issue. You can’t 
record footage locally using an SD card,  
but the app makes it easy to save and view later 
on your smartphone.

LAUNCHED BACK IN 2006, Twitter has since 
become the go-to source for real-time 
information on anything and everything. 
Breaking news, up-to-the-minute sports 
commentary, shameless celebrities spruiking 
their latest films and/or products — all this 
and more can be found on Twitter. A place 
for diverse discussion and opinion, you can 
converse (and/or argue) with people all over 
the world about the things that interest you 
— albeit using a maximum of 280 characters. 
In addition to us ordinary humans, you’ll 
find well-known academics, musicians, 
actors, sports stars, journalists and even big 
tech luminaries. Follow this detailed guide 
and you’ll be tweeting like a pro in no time!
THE BASICS
FINDING FRIENDS: One of the first steps to 
using Twitter is finding people to follow. 
During sign up, you’ll be asked to search and 
select from a number of topics that interest 
you — Twitter will then use this information 
to recommend people to follow. Additional 
suggestions based on your twitter habits can 
be accessed by pressing the person icon  
in the top-right corner of the Explore screen. 
The app can also sync your phone’s contacts 
to find friends already on Twitter. Use the 
search tool to navigate to a person’s profile 
— each user has their own page filled with 
past tweets, replies, retweets and likes.

posted by the people you follow. Twitter’s 
emphasis is on the now, which means it’s 
highly likely you’ll see a page filled with 
entirely new tweets every time you open  
the app. This is great for ensuring you get  
the latest up-to-date info on breaking news 
and events. Twitter will first show tweets 
from the people you engage with most,  
while the ‘In case you missed it’ section 
shows popular tweets posted while you  
were away from the app. Tap on a tweet  
at any time to see comments and replies 
posted by other users.  
TWEETING: Probably the most challenging 
aspect of Twitter is finding something to 
tweet about... using a maximum of 280 
characters. Twitter’s 
focus has traditionally 
been on messages that 
can be read in a few 
short seconds. Hence, 
a limit of just 140 
characters was initially 
imposed on tweets. 
However, at the time of writing this article, 
that number was doubled to 280 characters in 
order to allow people to tweet more freely —  
political rants, here we come! Sending a tweet 
is easy — within the Home tab, press the quill 
icon in the top-right hand corner of the 
screen. You can then start typing, as well as 
add links, photos, videos, even GIFs. 
HASHTAGS: What seems to be the buzzword 
of the 21st century, hashtags are essential to 
the Twitter experience. #iphone, #avocado, 
#beyonceisthebest — these simple words  
and phrases can be used when tweeting and 
conversing with others. Like Instagram, 
hashtags help organise the many millions  
of posts made each day into different topics 
and interests. For 
example, if you were 
writing a tweet about 
this super-awesome 
magazine, then you’d 
include #techlifeau  
in your tweet.  
This means anyone 
Select a number of topics that 
interest you and Twitter will 
recommend people to follow.
Here lies a chronological 
feed of tweets posted by 
the people you follow.
Including hashtags in your 
tweet makes it easy for 
other people to find.

who searches for that hashtag can then easily 
see and respond to your tweet, even if they 
don’t know you. When composing a message, 
simply enter the hashtag symbol and begin 
typing — the app will provide a series of 
popular keywords to choose from, or just 
continue writing your own.
STEP IT UP A LEVEL
REACTIONS: If you find yourself passionately 
pounding your fist in agreement with a tweet, 
you can like it by pressing the heart icon. 
Retweeting takes it one step further, letting 
you ‘forward’ tweets to your followers. Press 
the square icon with arrows to either share or 
quote the tweet onto your profile page.
SEARCH: One function you’re likely to use 
regularly is the search feature. Located in  
the Explore tab, you’re able to search for a 
particular person, keyword or hashtag. Results
can be filtered to show only top tweets or a list 
of posts in real-time. Searches can be further 
refined by specifying whether you’re looking 
for something specific like a photo, person, 
Periscope or news story.
MOMENTS: Trying to keep up with the latest 
breaking news on Twitter can be quite 
overwhelming at times. Moments are curated 
stories covering topics popular on the 
platform. It could be a trending news story, 
international event or celebrity gossip  
(don’t judge). Each moment includes 
comments, photos and videos from a variety  
of sources. You can even create and share  
your own by tapping your profile picture  
and pressing ‘Moments’. 
TRENDING TOPICS: What’s deemed popular  
on Twitter is determined largely by the 
aforementioned hashtag. If enough people use 
a particular keyword, then it’s likely to become
a trending topic. In the Explore tab, you’ll see  
a section titled ‘Trends for you’ — this is 
organised based on who you follow and  
your location. 
PRIVACY: While many users choose to make 
their profiles public, Twitter also allows you 
to protect your tweets and make them visible 
only to the people approved to follow you. 
This can be enabled in settings. Also 
included are tools for blocking and muting 
particular users. You can even hide others’ 
tweets from your timeline that contain 
particular words.
MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS: There’s a chance you 
may have multiple Twitter accounts for 
different occasions. For example, one could 
be for following friends, while another might 
be used to anonymously remain informed  
on the whereabouts of the Kardashians  
(or so I’ve been told). Rather than repeatedly 
log in and out, Twitter allows you to quickly 
toggle between accounts. To set this up,  
tap your profile icon and press the three dots 
in the top-right corner.
GOING PRO
PUSH NOTIFICATIONS: Twitter is a powerful 
beast when it comes to the quantity of 
content produced every minute. Push 
notifications ensure you remain informed  
on the latest and greatest happenings in the 
Twittersphere when away from the app.  
Press the alarm icon on a person’s profile to 
be notified whenever they send out a tweet. 
Notifications for mentions, likes and 
retweets can also be managed in settings.
POLLS: You’re now able to create a poll others 
can vote on directly from their timeline. 
When writing a tweet, press the graph icon 
and type your question. Up to four choices 
can be included, along with how long your 
Moments are curated stories 
featuring tweets, photos and links 
coming from a variety of sources.
In the Explore tab, you’ll see a section 
listing popular topics currently being 
talked about on Twitter.
Tapping the retweet

person’s post.
You can hide tweets containing

might just want to get some more friends, learn a 
new skill, understand yourself a bit better or expand 
your horizons. The Well talks about all these things, 
as well as everyday hurdles you’d like to conquer, 
such as managing your inbox, how to sleep better 
and the odd bit of parenting advice. It’s well worth  
a listen.

THE MINDFUL KIND
www.rachaelkable.com/podcast
Mindfulness isn’t just about sitting on the grass  
in a park and thinking about what you’re feeling —  
physically and emotionally. As host Rachael Kable 
explains it, mindfulness can extend to every corner 
of your life, helping you with communication,  
coping with stress and grief, as well as motivating 
you to love yourself more and take care of that body 
of yours! If you need help setting and keeping to your
goals, Kable’s got a few tips for you.
DON’T SALT MY GAME
www.laurathomasphd.co.uk/podcast
So you’ve probably had ‘lose weight’ or ‘get fit’  
on your New Year’s resolutions before, right?  
Been there, trying that. It’s hard to get fit and 
healthy, though, when you’re pressured into picking 
up a diet and sticking to it, especially when it 
includes giving up things you love — like bread, 
noooo. Well, this podcast turns that around and 
helps you reach your goals without going crazy  
on diets and weird habits. Give it a go!

HOW TO SWITCH YOUR ANDROID PHONE 
AUDIO TO MONO, FOR LISTENING WITH 
A SINGLE EARPHONE
STAY ALERT, STAY GROOVY.
Stereo audio can be an important factor in the 
songs and podcasts you listen to, but if you  
need to listen through a single headphone (for 
increased awareness when cycling, for instance) 
you’ll be missing out on certain components  
of your music, especially with older recordings. 
Audio on Android can be turned into ‘mono’ 
mode, which combines the left and right signals 
and sends the sum to each ear so you don’t miss 
out on anything that would otherwise only play 
in one of them. First, navigate to the Accessibility 
screen in your Settings (this may be found under 
the Advanced screen) and tap the ‘Mono Audio’ 
option.  [ HD ]

YOU SEE THOSE SHOES?
NOW YOU CAN BUY THEM!
If you don’t know the name of a product,
or happen to see something you’re keen on
buying while out and about, eBay’s mobile app
now has the option to search via image
courtesy of some new AI capabilities. While in
the app, tap on the camera icon in the search
bar to bring up the viewfinder and take a snap
of the product. Crop the image to best fit the
product itself, and tap Search. The results
will vary based on the photo itself and the
precision will improve over time as the feature
gets used more. The function is only available
on iOS at the time of writing, although eBay
has stated that image search (as well as another
feature — Find It On eBay) are available on
both platforms. [ HD ]
GOOGLE’S MADE IT EASIER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PRODUCTS 
ARE COMPATIBLE WITH GOOGLE HOME
A SUPPORT PAGE HAS BEEN SET UP ONLINE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT.
If you own a Google Home (or a Home Mini), finding smarthome devices that can 
be controlled with Google Assistant can be hard, what with thousands of IoT 
products available today, and not all of them compatible with Home. To make it 
easy for customers, Google has set up a support page that lists all the 
smarthome devices that can be voice-controlled via the “OK, Google” command. 
The searchable list (tinyurl.com/tla72-homecontrol) currently has partners 
listed alphabetically, but a filter box will help you narrow down your search  
by using keywords. Searching for ‘speaker’ or ‘light’ will give you a list of partner 
devices, while the ‘Narrow by’ box comes in handy if you know the manufacturer 
of the device you’re after.  [ SS ]   
You will need to set up a free IFTTT  
(If This Then That) account for this, 
however, but that’s not too hard. Once 
you’ve logged into IFTTT, make your way 
to the Google Assistant channel and turn 
on ‘Keep a list of notes to email yourself at 
the end of the day’. Connect to your 
Google Home account, make sure the 
settings are to your liking  
and hit Save. 
The next time you want to remind 
yourself of something or want to save a 
random thought to follow through with 
later,  
just speak it out or type it into the app  
and Assistant will send you an email 
reminder at a time you’ve specified with  
a summary of the day’s titbits.  [ SS ]  
Get your daily subscriptions 
and keep tabs on your notes

A DAILY DOSE OF THE WEATHER WITH

As a Google Assistant user, you have the

poems, the weather report or even funny

frequency you wish. Setting up these 
subscriptions is easy via the “Send me XYZ 
every day” — ‘XYZ’ being whatever 
information (or entertainment) you’re after. 
Open the app, say or type out the kind of

then select ‘Yes’. Set the time you want to

If you’re someone who thinks on their feet

Most of us will never have the 
opportunity to park a Lamborghini  
in the driveway and unless you are the 
creator of Pokemon Go, AR probably 
isn’t going to help you fulfil this wish. 
But for those who’d just like to know 
what such a midlife-crisis-mobile 
would look like in your garage, then  
the iOS mobile racing game CSR 
Racing 2 is the AR app for you, allowing 
you to place the game’s fancy cars 
anywhere your smartphone camera  
can take a picure. 
After what feels like an exceptionally long 
wait, Skyrim is finally out on PSVR and 
with full two-handed, Move controller- 
integrated, weapon movement it was 
clearly worth the wait. Never again can 
VR games be accused of being just 
‘experiences’ as the 300-hour (and then 
some) title brings this expansive RPG into 
the virtual world. You have the option of 
teleporting or smooth directional 
controller locomotion giving you the 
power to experience the game in a way 
that is the most comfortable.
While RoomScan for iOS was first 
released back in 2014, a recent update 
has made the AR room measurement 
application free for the first time. If 
you’ve ever needed to check if furniture 
will fit in a space or want to know room 
dimensions for for DIY purposes, it’s 
much easier to just pull open an app 
and record the dimensions of multiple 
rooms in a way that you can easily refer 
to at any time in the future. 
If you were pitched the concept of a 
911-dispatch game for VR, you might be a 
little perplexed as to why a game that’s 
primarily reliant on audio cues would 
base itself on the visual VR platform. That 
is unless you’ve already dialed in to the 
engrossing world of Dispatch, the latest 
title from renowned virtual reality 
production company Here Be Dragons. 
The game’s minimalist art style animates 
the important information and noises you 
hear as a small town police dispatcher on a 
particularly dark night. 
BETHESDA’S SUITE OF VR titles and 
some decent sales on high-end VR 
headsets rounded out an impressive year 
of VR development. While it might not 
have met the explosive demand some 
analysts had predicted, Sony’s PlayStation 
VR shipped close to 500,000 units through 
the third quarter of 2017 and was expected 
to sell even more in the following months, 
as more big-name titles are released. 
While the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive 
shipped comparatively fewer units 
(210,000 and 160,000 respectively), it’s a 
good indication that VR is still an 
appealing area for many people. 
Meanwhile, augmented reality (AR) has 
continued to quietly tick along, finding 
unique app use cases, including a novel 
collaboration with AI from Google and 
Microsoft which uses smartphone 
cameras and visual machine learning 
systems to annotate the world around us 
for the visually impaired.

Microsoft is leading the blind with a new 
AI application. Point your smartphone 
camera at an object and the app says what it 
can see. Leaning heavily on machine 
learning, the visual processing system can 
recognise text, product barcodes, objects 
and people, and can even describe them. 
For any of the 384,000 Australians with 
low vision, this is an empowering 
application that offers a signifiacnt amount 
of independence. Currently only available 
to iOS users, there’s no word yet on when it 
will reach Android. 
Time poor professionals such as politicians 
and lawyers often outsource research in 
order to save time, but synthesizing 
important information is a complex 
process that is generally more expensive 
that most professionals can afford. Bravo to 
Charlie that is here to help! This new AI 
system is built to research details on 
companies and individuals and summarise  
it into an easy to digest report, saving sales 
representatives time rather than keep them 
working later. 
It seems that Google and Microsoft are 
falling over themselves to create the best 
AI based app for the vision impaired. 
Google announced the new AI-powered 
Google Lens back in May at the I/O 
Developers Conference, and the clever app 
has been accessible through Google 
Photos on the Pixel 2 since launch.  
Google Lens should be rolling out to the 
older Pixel phones through the Google 
Assistant in the coming weeks. 
While bots plod along, chipping away at their 
innumerable, pragmatic, time-saving 
applications, the Louis Theroux Bot is 
painstakingly generating the most amazing, 
perception-changing, fake documentary topics 
and broadcasting them to a dedicated, 40,000 
strong cohort of Twitter followers. Sure it’s a 
little flippant, but anyone with a penchant for 
the popular documentary-maker’s obscure 
subjects will appreciate the comedy in this 
topic generator’s pitch perfect amalgamations. 
Even Theroux himself has read aloud one of 
the bot’s concoctions.

Android users generally have it a lot better
than iOS users when it comes to the flexibility 
of moving files around, but it doesn’t have  
a simple alternative to Airdrop. Well, until 
now that is, because Files Go is Google’s 
answer to that Apple functionality, and 
according to the beta version we tested,  
they’re on the right track. When you boot  
the program up, you’ll find an application  
hell bent on helping you clear up hard drive 
space on your phone, but tucked away in there
is the ability to share any file — big or small 
— with a close fellow Android user via  
a Bluetooth connection that the app itself  
sets up. Of course, the person you’re either 
sending to or receiving from will need  
to install Files Go too, but it’s a simple affair, 
and given it’s from Google, it’ll sync straight 
with your remaining account without any fuss
about logging in or registering. 
The app is currently a bit on the unstable 
side — it crashed a half-dozen times during 
the half hour we used it — but once these are 
ironed out it’ll be very useful indeed.

which help you switch between periods of exercise 
and rest. With achievements to earn and plenty of 
ways to monitor your progress, it’s very easy to get

up for the subscription programme to unlock 
additional workouts and plans which suit specific 
goals like weight loss. It’s not necessarily beginner

Using CastBox is about as easy and stress-free
as podcast-finding can be. To begin with, if
you’re already using another podcasting app,
CastBox gives you the option to import your
subscriptions. The app’s search categories are
definitely easier to browse than any other
podcast app your humble reviewer has ever
encountered. If you have Android Auto and
an Amazon Echo, you can also take your tunes
to the lounge room and car. You can link your
social media accounts, and each channel and
episode allows you to leave your comments
and share. You can download episodes for
offline listening, change the order of your
next-up playlist, listen to any podcast without
even logging in, and filter your podcasts by
their download or playing status, and date.
And if you’re a budding podcaster yourself,
CastBox allows you to become a contributor
by uploading your own files or recording them
directly in the app itself! But back to its
searching ability: podcasts can be found by
searching the name of the show, episode, hosts
or even guest appearances, and if you can’t
find your podcast anywhere, you can email
CastBox to suggest they add it. It truly is the
best podcast-listening experience going
around at the moment. [ CARMEL SEALEY ]
OmniGraffle 3 is delightfully straightforward.
You drag elements called stencils to its canvas
from a built-in collection. A lot of usability is
packed into the unified navigation sidebar that
gathers document objects, layers and canvases.
It makes it easy to select objects based on their
properties. Each OmniGraffle shape, line or
symbol is endlessly adjustable through the
Inspector sidebar. OmniGraffle’s floating Tool
palette can be minimised with a tap, while tap-
and-hold triggers fullscreen mode leaving only
the canvas visible. The canvas dimensions
themselves can be flexibly extended at any
time. If you’re used to OmniGraffle on Mac,
you’ll enjoy a near-frictionless transition. This
version can import SVG images and Omni has
squeezed in a cross-platform JavaScript engine
to manipulate documents through scripts.
The Pro version, which adds extras such as
Microsoft Visio export, includes a scripting
console. There are still features we’d like to see
— a variation of the macOS version’s outliner,
which accelerates layout creation, for example.
But the Freehand tool here compensates: draw
a shape on the canvas with your finger and
OmniGraffle converts it into an object.

In the world of apps, seldom do you get a truly 
free experience. This is the case for WattPad,  
a contributor-centred story app that’s free to 
download. There’s a swathe of titles in the 
public domain, but the majority of content 
here is from authors you’ve never heard of.  
If you’re a writer, you can publish your work 
and any reader who finds your story is free to 
comment — either on the work as a whole or 
paragraph by paragraph. When reading, you 
will notice the number of little grey speech 
bubbles that populate the right-hand scrollbar. 
This gets annoying, but it’s a constant 
reminder of what the service actually is — a 
community. WattPad encourages interaction, 
and so long as the people are nice (this is the 
internet, mind — nasties lurk in every corner), 
things will remain civil. The ads that prop up 
the service can be very obtrusive, however. 
They don’t invade the chapters you’re reading, 
but they will pop up in lists and after each 
chapter you read. If you can stomach that, you 
won’t need to cough up the $9.99 per month 
Premium subscription fee. It’s a great idea and, 
undoubtedly, a useful tool for budding writers, 
but the content on offer can be very rough, 
first-draft kind of stuff, and catering mostly  
to teens.  [ CARMEL SEALEY ]

From the home-made compilation tapes of the
‘80s to today’s shared links from Apple Music  
and Spotify, one of the great joys of music is 
sharing your discoveries or favorites with others. 
SoundShare was designed to do just that, and to 
do so in a way that made sharing as easy as 
possible — it doesn’t matter if you’re on Apple 
Music and your friend is on Spotify or Deezer; 
SoundShare finds the right song in the 
appropriate service. Version 3 has two key 
improvements. First, it uses MusicKit, the iOS 11 
framework that enables deeper integration  
with Apple Music. This means apps such as 
SoundShare can access personalised playlists 
and recommendations in much the same way the 
Apple Music app does. Second, and even more 
fun, it has a Party Mode. With this mode, you can 
invite friends to collaborate on a playlist, where  
a single iOS device can handle everybody’s 
requests and send to a wired or wireless speaker 
system. It works really well, although the ability  
to let others interrupt playback with their own 
choices could be a problem if any of your friends 
are impolite and have terrible taste in tunes.  
In a nice touch, SoundShare can even stream 
Party Mode videos to Apple TV by finding them  
on YouTube. There are a couple of caveats.  
You need to have a Spotify Premium account. 
SoundShare can work only with what’s available, 
so differences between streaming services’ 
catalogues may prevent you from sharing the odd 
track between two different music services.  
The SoundShare app is a must, so Android 
owners are not able to take part either. And we 
encountered the odd bug, such as when the Invite 
option trapped us in a Contacts page. But overall 
SoundShare 3 is a clever and effective way to 
share music with friends.  [ GARY MARSHALL ]

MailChimp is mighty big in mailing list
services. If you have something to say or sell, 
it’s a great choice. That is, unless you’ve wanted 
to create email campaigns on your iPad or 
iPhone. Its iOS app hasn’t really allowed 
creating or editing email campaigns — until 
now. MailChimp on iOS has mostly been a 
place to view details of subscriber activity and 
sent campaigns. New in MailChimp 4 is the 
ability to create and edit new campaigns  
(the industry name for the emails you send). 
You can add nearly every kind of supported 
content, reorder your content ‘blocks’, change 
most formatting details, preview your work, 
and press the big red button. If your iPad is 
your primary computer, or you just need to 
change a few things while on-the-go, the 
updated app will be a big help. Note that there 
are still a handful of missing features — you 
can’t set a campaign’s web address, the auto- 
optimising tool for large images isn’t there, 
some text formatting options aren’t available, 
and neither is the Code Block. Still, this is a 
welcome update for the mailing list manager 
that better embraces the mobile future.
It’s a powerful, popular mailing list service

We’ve all been there: clearing out all your 
phone’s notifications that have piled up  
over the day, but you notice too late that 
there was one you didn’t recognise.
What was it about, and which app was  
it even from? The aptly-titled Notification 
History Log is here to put an end to the 
mystery. The standard Notification History 
screen allows you to view a list of all your 
notifications and which app they came 
from, a list that is kept on Android systems 
but is hidden by default. 
Tapping on any one of these items will 
display more detail about the notification, 
such as its priority, contents, and settings 
such as whether it will vibrate or play sounds 
when receiving that type of notification. 
There’s also an Advanced Notification 
History which will allow you to open the 
notification directly, and with the purchase 
of the Pro version, allow you to keep an 
unlimited amount of stored notifications, 
and delete them as you please.

BEST NEW APPS
This app is almost as important for what it 
represents as what it does. This is a file-
comparison app with a razor-sharp focus, 
geared towards productivity. On iPad, the app 
tries to be as proficient as its Mac version, 
although ends up coming off second-best.  
Throw a couple of TXT, DOC, HTML or code 
documents at it, and you can quickly spot 
differences in a two-up or unified view. The 
app also supports Split View, which is just as 
well, given that it lacks the text merge that’s 
part of the Mac version. With images, 
everything suddenly feels fiddly. When it 
comes to folders, import appears to be an 
issue. Drop a couple of text files into the app 
and you’re comparing them almost instantly. 
Open a couple of web archives, and the app 
appears to seize up. However, the app clearly 
indicates files that have changed or are 
unmatched, and double-tapping a file opens it 
and its twin for comparison.
There’s ambition here, not only regarding 
the app but also the iPad. Kaleidoscope is also 
a good iOS 11 citizen, usable and useful.  
Just be aware of its limitations, and be sure to 
put it through its paces during the two-week 
free trial. In all, it’s solid but occasionally 
flawed.  [ CRAIG GRANNELL ]

PROCREATE
AMAZING ART APP GETS EVEN 
MORE SHINE.
$14.99 | procreate.art
Procreate was one of the first apps to take full 
creative advantage of the iPad, and this fourth 
version confirms it’s still ahead of its rivals. It’s 
aimed squarely at artists — dabblers and pros 
— both for finished artwork and visualisation, 
where a scene or character is roughed out. This is 
a big update, with changes both above and below 
the surface. The interface is more streamlined 
than ever, with everything clearly and logically 
laid out in drop-down panels accessed from the 
top toolbar, making it easy to switch colours and 
brushes. The developers have also made clever 
use of gestures, so you can find extra settings 
with a swipe. You can undo with a two-finger tap, 
or hold your fingers down to wind back as many 
steps as you want, but there’s no way to edit 
individual strokes or effects later, or change the 
resolution of a canvas. Still, this suits the app’s 
painterly approach, which is enhanced by a new 
set of wet painting brushes. These feel real and 
interact satisfyingly with colours on the canvas. 
There’s also a Smudge mode. An iPad Pro with 
Apple’s Pencil is the ideal setup: both pressure 
and tilt are supported, and you get detailed 
control over how brushes respond. Many Pogo, 
Jot and Wacom active styluses are supported, too. 
Inevitably, you see some lag on slower iPads.
Procreate is a serious creative tool.  
At $14.99 all-in, with no in-app purchases 
required, it’s great value.   [ ADAM BANKS ] 
The latest in citizen science comes in the
form of the FrogID app, an initiative 
designed to help count and locate the 
amount of frogs residing in Australia by 
focusing on each user’s local amphibians.  
As the app’s website suggests, “frogs are a 
sign of a healthy environment, but around 
Australia frogs are declining and many are 
endangered”. 
Once you’ve registered an account,  
you can record the local frog calls in your 
area and submit them to the national frog 
count. Eventually, they’ll be identified by 
Audio DNA experts from the Australian 
Museum and you’ll get to know which  
little frogs live in your area, but more 
importantly, these experts will be able  
to get a much better understanding of 
environmental trends such as the spread  
of the pestilent cane toads or the flourishing 
of the striped marsh frog. 
As motivation to use the app, you’ll also 
be given access to an ‘explore’ tab that offers 
up plenty of detailed and interesting info  
on all the frog species that people have 
located so far. Ribbit!

WHILE FAKE OR distorted news is far from a recent occurrence,
the average consumer is now a lot more aware of its presence —
whether they care or not is another matter... If you’re part of the former 
group, then you might be interested in CivikOwl. This extension helps 
you decipher between the truthful and the not-so-truthful by letting
you know how credible a certain article’s sources are. Once you’ve
installed CivikOwl, head out into the wide world of the internet and
hunt down some news. While you’re reading, click on the little owl icon 
to check the quality of the article’s sources. You will get a ‘score’
indicating how factual that article is (N/A for breaking news or
suspected opinion pieces, Low, Medium and High) and also suggest
alternate-view or similar pieces on the same topic. Once you’ve
received your score, you’ll see a breakdown of how many unique
sources have been mentioned, how many times the article redirects to 
other articles on the same site (which CivikOwl doesn’t much like),
how many links to sources with a high standard of factual reporting,  
as well as links to sources known for having politically diverse views.
It’s a thoroughly useful tool, all in all, and will hopefully help you
escape from any echo chambers you might be trapped in.

likely to motivate you. We would have like to have had the ability to set up 
multiple countdowns, though, since a single countdown doesn’t take up the

If you find photo-editing apps a bit too complicated with all the 
filters, sliders and styles, but still see the benefit of getting your photos 
touched up a bit, then you might be interested in this service. First of 
all, upload your photo and choose which type of phone it was taken 
on. As the dataset that the neural network is relying upon was set up 
with images from only a handful of cameras, you can only choose 
between an iPhone 6, iPhone 7 and ‘Nexus 5X and other Android 
phones’. To be honest, we’re unsure to what extent your choice 
matters here (since we tried pictures from other phones not listed  
and even a DSLR, but received similar results). We tested the power  
of the AI by throwing landscapes and pictures of cats its way, and 
discovered that the best results come from images that turned out too 
dark in the original or the colour was washed out. Pop your images 
into Phancer, and the AI will get to work boosting those colours and 
crisping up the image a bit. As with all neural networks, there’s a 
learning curve involved and Phancer is still soaking up valuable data

If you or the business you’re involved with has anything to do with

decision to sign the agreement or not. You could hire a lawyer to go

an AI to do it — that’s where NDA Lynn comes into play. The service 
is a project from Dutch legal tech company JuriBlox that aims to 
automate as much of the legal process as possible, particularly when 
it comes to the recognition of repetitive (boring) and consistent (dry) 
language. To test it out, first select if you’re the recipient or deliverer 
of information (or both) and then upload your file. You can provide 
some extra information, such as the purpose of the NDA, to improve 
the analysis, but with that first question and the uploaded file, Lynn 
should be able to recommend whether or not to sign the deal. The 
process takes a few minutes, but there’s a neat little option to email 
the results, so you can carry on working elsewhere while NDA Lynn

don’t want to send them a text or leave it scribbled down somewhere  
in the house, you could instead jump on Saltify, type in your message 
(of up to 500 characters), add in an optional passphrase, set the timer

Another great feature about this service is, if you’re a Slack user,  
you can share secrets quickly and safely without even jumping into

Assassin’s Creed Origins
A SPRAWLING OPEN-WORLD EGYPT
RIDDLED WITH NUMBERS.
$99.95 | PC, PS4, XO | www.assassinscreed.com
IT’S HARD TO detect at which point in recent
gaming history numbers started to figure
heavily into anything that wasn’t a niche RPG.
Nowadays, you see numbers everywhere,
whether it’s the interminable level grind of your
average online FPS (Overwatch, Battlefield) or
in once breezy and noncommittal arcade racers
(Forza, Need For Speed). Games like Diablo
arguably perfected the “loot grind” — actually
a cyclical, alarmingly futile chase for bigger
numbers — but now it’s difficult to imagine any
blockbuster game launching without some
form of levelling attached.
And so it is with Assassin’s Creed Origins,
which has enjoyed a longer period of gestation
since Ubisoft ceased dishing them out on a
yearly basis. It’s the archetypal, modern, ‘light
RPG’ — you won’t need a spreadsheet to form 
an optimal build, but you’ll sure as hell need to 
know how to count. Unlike earlier games in the 
series, your protagonist accumulates levels,  
and loots items based on their rarity and 
various other numerical markers. And to be 
honest, these are among the only functional 
changes to the series since 2015’s Syndicate: the 
meat and potatoes of the game — the moment-
to-moment gameplay — stays much the same.
And yet, Origins is definitely among the best 
Assassin’s Creed games we’ve played. The 
ancient Egypt depicted here is gorgeous,
sprawling through deserts and oases and
ruins, taking us to the high seas and down into
the dank treasure-strewn caverns of the actual
Pyramids. Protagonist Bayek is charismatic
and as vaguely interesting as an AC main
character can be, and the tools he uses, such as
his military-drone-esque eagle, add a lot of
flavour to both exploration and tactical stealth
play. Aside from the loot grind, Origins also
sports the best combat system in the series yet,
melding the DNA of Ubisoft stablemate  
For Honor with something like Dark Souls  
or Bloodborne. It’s not as exacting and 
unforgiving as any of those, but the necessity 
to block and dodge and time your moves 
makes it a more exhilarating affair than  
the sticky auto-swipe rhythm of previous 
instalments. 
For its world, and its combat, and the sheer 
joy of being in the game, Origins is a winner. 
But there are caveats: if you’re the type to blaze 
through the main missions without a thought 
for side dishes, that’s virtually impossible here: 
main missions are levelled, meaning if your 
character is at 8 and a mission is at 11, you’ll 
pretty much fail it. Side missions are essential, 
and while occasionally great, the requirement 
to do them feels a bit pushy. But if you’re after  
a huge (to the tune of 60-odd hours) 
adventure, there’s probably nothing better out 
this season.  [ SHAUN PRESCOTT ]

THE SECOND PART in a proposed trilogy,
The New Colossus is — yet again — about long-
time series protagonist BJ Blazkowicz kicking
Nazi arse... with guns. Set in the aftermath of
the first game, which saw the Nazi regime
regrettably win World War 2, The New
Colossus spends the bulk of its time traversing
a Nazi-occupied United States. Think Philip K
Dick’s Man in the High Castle, except starring
a cast of underground revolutionaries hell bent
on toppling the sadistic fascists... with guns.
As you’d expect, the bulk of your time spent
in The New Colossus is shooting at baddies,
and that’s fine, because MachineGames’
weapons are explosive, packing a punch that
few other modern FPS games can. But much
like the first game, The New Colossus doesn’t
coddle the player, and most will find this
instalment a huge challenge compared to
contemporaries like Call of Duty or Battlefront
2’s campaign. While the marketing posits the
game as an unrelenting, cathartic Nazi killing
simulator, you’ll actually need to resort to
stealth a fair bit unless you’re supernaturally
NEED FOR SPEED: PAYBACK
GETTING A LITTLE TYRED.
$68 | PC, PX4, XO | www.ea.com
The latest iteration in EA’s Need For Speed series 
embodies something of a back-to-basics 
approach. Gone are the 2015 reboot’s online- 
only campaign and live-action cutscenes, and 
the result is a smarter and more varied arcade 
racer that finds inspiration in everything from 
Forza Horizon to Grand Theft Auto. Even so, NFS 
Payback often feels like wasted potential. 
The game places you in the shoes of three 
main characters, all seeking revenge against 
notorious local cartel ‘The House’. However, the 
story suffers from an overly abrupt introduction 
and dull cast, and it’s hard to get emotionally 
invested. In the main storyline, you’ll find 
yourself taking part in one of five entertaining 
race types: race, off-road, drag, drift or runner. 
The variety is complemented by a set of refined 
driving mechanics that improve on 2015’s game, 
particularly in terms of handling, drifting and the 
greater feeling of individuality to each vehicle. AI 
improvements are noticeable, too. Each car you 
select can be customised to your desire, and the 
range of options is broad. A major new 
introduction is Speed Cards — collectible 
performance mods that are drawn at random 
following a race victory or made purchasable 
from a tune-up shop. Many races (including 
online encounters) require highly-upgraded cars 
to achieve success, and given the cost and 
variety of Speed Cards on offer, it can take some 
laborious grinding to achieve the type of boosts 
that’ll see you compete at the highest level. 
The beautiful world offers detail and diversity 
in abundance, though. The bustling city, dusty 
desert and hilly mountains all look striking, if 
rather deserted. It all adds up to a game that 
remains a fun arcade racer at heart, but begins 
to chug when surrounding elements come into 
play. It was always going to take a mammoth 
effort to return NFS to the peak of its former 
glory, and in this case, it suffers from too many 
dents in the bodywork. [ FRASER GILBERT ]
dextrous. But its challenging nature isn’t a
negative: it makes the game more engaging
and impactful, while foregrounding the
urgency of both Blazkowicz and his
entourage’s efforts. Also, the environments
are much more richly detailed and impressive
when compared to the first game, so spending
a lot of time in a single level isn’t as draining
as it used to be.
MachineGames is a master of game
cinematography... and guns, so the studio has
not seen fit to ‘innovate’ much with this sequel
— it’s about as bread and butter as a modern
blockbuster game can be. There are new
weapon upgrades which help the player
customise their approach marginally, but all
in all, The New Colossus will appeal to anyone
who likes straightforward single-player
campaigns: a true rarity in this era of
multiplayer loot box nickel and diming.

South Park: The Fractured But Whole
DON’T GO BREAKING MY FART.
$57 | PC, PS4, XO | southpark.ubisoft.com
CALL OF DUTY: WW2
A RETURN TO FORM FOR MULTIPLAYER,  
BUT A TYPICALLY NAFF CAMPAIGN.
$99.95 | PC, PS4, XO | www.callofduty.com
After two years spent dabbling in science-
fiction and, most importantly, double-
jumping and jetpacking, Call of Duty returns 
to its historical war roots with this aptly 
named instalment. Last year’s Infinite Warfare 
was a good stab at perfecting the type of 
hi-octane, traveral-centric FPS combat 
mastered by Titanfall 2, but given the size of 
the COD series, the conservatism of its fans, 
and the sad truth that Titanfall 2 itself wasn’t 
exactly a bestseller, here we are again, in the 
trenches. It’s easy enough to hate this game 
before it’s booted up and, let’s be honest,  
the campaign, in typically linear, explosive 
COD fashion, is pretty average. Mass market 
shooter franchises can barely hope to lend 
gravity to narratives concerned with actual 
historical tragedies, and while the marketing 
for this game promised that it would —  
it emphatically does not. If you’re into trite 
war-is-noble platitudes and watching things 
explode, it might be worth a shot.
But WW2 is definitely worth picking up, 
because its multiplayer component is 
arguably the best it’s had for years — and this 
is coming from a critic who loved the sci-fi 
direction previous instalments took. While 
there’s a whole loot crate system, it doesn’t 
reach the cynical heights that Battlefront 2 
does, and all is forgiven when one starts 
blasting shotgun shells into MountainDew 
Lover_360NoScope while tossing grenades 
over the rooftops of German bunkers. 
There’s a zombies co-operative component 
as well — the usual horde mode affair —  
but if Call of Duty is really all about its PvP 
multiplayer, then Activision might not have  
to scratch this franchise off its list of priorities 
after all.   [ SHAUN PRESCOTT ]
You can alter your race, gender 
and sexuality as you go.
THE FRACTURED BUT Whole serves as the 
ultimate tutorial in gassy manipulation. 
Progressing through the returning New Kid’s 
latest adventure proves impossible without the 
aid of flatulence, which enables you to clear 
paths, inflict diabetic rage, and manipulate 
time, such is the power of your windy behind. 
The once-christened ‘Douchebag’ of 2014’s 
Stick Of Truth has evolved into ‘The Farting 
Vigilante’ — the superhero destined to 
someday receive their own Netflix series. 
We’ve missed you, South Park. 
Cartman, having grown bored with the 
kids’ previous Stick Of Truth fantasy, has opted 
instead to play superheroes with his friends, 
expectantly seeking the funds to develop his 
own movie franchise. In true South Park 
fashion, matters only escalate from there.  
But in truth, the game proves less engaging 
than its predecessor in this area, with its 
uninspiring tale getting off to a particularly 
slow start. Subsequent bouts of boredom 
remain short-lived despite this, with parodies, 
social commentary and good ol’ fashioned 
toilet humour filling the void amidst the duller 
moments. Not every joke hits the mark, but in 
the context of its length, The Fractured But 
Whole provides plenty of chuckles. 
The biggest enhancement over the series’ 
previous entry can be found on the battlefield. 
This time around, the basic combat elements 
of The Stick Of Truth make way for a more 
complex grid-based system, granting 
participants the ability to move freely within  
a certain area. This addition allows for more 
grandiose and diverse battles than before, 
where planning your next move doesn’t 
necessarily mean picking the best attack  
in your arsenal. 
Battles are complemented by a variety of 
deeper RPG elements, too. You can unlock 
multiple classes of superhero (such as cyborg, 
assassin and blaster), allowing you to mix and 
match abilities at will, while bonus-granting 
artefacts provide a customised edge in combat. 
Even the new crafting system (introduced by 
Morgan Freeman, because why not?) provides 
a welcome, if bare-bones, addition to the 
series. As a collective, the new tactical 
components work to deliver tense, 
entertaining encounters from battle to battle. 
And, of course, exploring the town of South 
Park remains a delight. The quiet mountain 
town has barely altered (for obvious reasons) 
since the first iteration, but the implementation 
of 60fps gameplay combined with minimal 
loading screens helps to retain fluidity and 
momentum throughout. It only ever loses  
its charm when you’re forced to do a lot of 
mission-required backtracking, but even then, 
there’s always something to investigate  
along the way. 
Naturally, this means it delivers a high 
degree of fan service. There’s ample 
opportunity throughout to bask in references 
to the show and enjoy in-jokes, many of which 
line the main plot itself. This will undoubtedly 
prove offputting to newcomers, but then, only 
a handful of non-fans are ever likely to dive 
headfirst into The Fractured But Whole. 
Ultimately, whichever category you align 
with, you’re guaranteed to stumble upon a 
surprisingly in-depth RPG, offering the kind 
of charming authenticity that TV tie-in games 
have long strived to achieve. Just don’t forget  
to bring a towel, mmkay?   [ FRASER GILBERT ]

Star Wars: Battlefront 2
LACKING IN THE MIDICHLORIANS DEPARTMENT...
$79 | PC, PS4, XO | www.ea.com
IF THE CAMPAIGN’S story were better and
the progression system not so irritating,
we might have really liked Battlefront 2.
Battle Points are earned and spent mid-
match to spawn as X-wings, AT-STs, jump
troopers, wookiees and all sorts of other Star
Wars combatants, including heroes and
villains like Yoda, Rey and Kylo Ren. Your
primary goal in any multiplayer mode is not
your team’s objective, it’s earning those
points so you can do some real damage.
Most of your time will be spent as a regular
trooper, though, and the basic shooting is
really more fun in the campaign, where the
focus is all on spectacle (because it definitely
wasn’t on the story). There, most enemies are
weak enough to kill in one headshot, while
in multiplayer, shields can take a beating,
making most kills feel incidental. And the
map design, though beautiful, can make for
some dull battles. In the confined spaces,
most maps eventually push both teams into
a room to defend, such as the Mos Eisley
Cantina — it’s a lot of reckless charges and
grenade spamming.
The worst thing about the Battle Points
grind is that everyone wants to spawn as Rey,
DISCOVER
GAME REVIEWS
or in Poe Dameron’s X-Wing, so everyone 
prioritises earning points over teamwork. 
DICE makes an effort to solve this: when 
playing near your squadmates, you earn you 
double Battle Points. There are Credits, a 
non-cash currency you earn by playing 
matches and achieving milestones. Credits 
can unlock loot boxes which contain 
randomised awards, including Star Cards 
— a largely dull way to upgrade your classes, 
ships, ground vehicles and heroes.   
Outside all that progression nonsense,  
the 4–5hr campaign is a pretty good time.  
Its snappy levels run through all the best  
Star Wars moments: piloting TIE fighters, 
exchanging blaster fire down too-white 
corridors, force pushing Stormtroopers...  
The dialogue can be funny and clever, but 
the larger story is erratic. Plus, there’s little 
opportunity for exploring those beautiful 
locations. There’s also a singleplayer Arcade 
mode, and Heroes vs Villains, which is a 
mess of superpowers but fun enough.

by the considerably-overpowered high elf faction 
of Caledor in the East, it’s clear that, after only  
a few hours, we’re already fighting a war on  
two fronts... but, contrary to the saying,  
in Total War: Warhammer II, fighting a war on 
two fronts is about as easy as it gets.
The initial guided gameplay teaches you 
everything from battle tactics to settlement 
management, initiating diplomacy to concealing 
assassination plots, and managing unruly 
populations to raising entire settlements,  
in a predictably Total War fashion. 
If you’ve come for the Games Workshop side 
of things, you’ll need to be prepared to play as 
something other than the diplomatic, humanlike, 
high elves — but the game’s new race list also 
features dark elves, lizardmen and skaven, 
which keep the battles chaotic and campaign 
styles unique.
Improvements to the end turn notification 
system, construction tree and the addition  
of rogue armies, make Warhammer II the  
most polished and enjoyable Total War game 
we’ve yet played.

DROPMIX IS A mobile music mixing game from developer Harmonix, 
the masterminds responsible for Rock Band, where up to four players 
can team up or duke it out to show off their DJ chops. Lay down beats, 
vocals, bass and other iconic lines from the hottest chart bangers or 
classic anthems and mix them masterfully to rack up your points. 
The product itself consists of a long plastic deck, with a cradle in one 
end to house your smartphone or tablet. Your device connects to the 
cradle via Bluetooth, and using a companion app, also acts as the 
display and audio output for the game. The deck has spaces to lay down 
five NFC-enabled playing cards, with each space representing a song 
component or combination of components. Once you lay down a card, 
the game will start playing the associated part and will automatically 
mix each of the next cards you play into the right BPM (tempo) and key, 
allowing up to five components to be mixed at any one time. Each of the 
three game modes relies on placing, stacking and removing these cards. 
The more casual Freestyle mode has no limits and is excellent for 
riding the game’s short learning curve, but is also exceptionally fun —  
we found ourselves spending far longer than we thought we would just 
grooving along in this mode. Clash mode puts you in a head-to-head 
battle against another player (or two versus two), while party mode has 
you working together to build the perfect mix.
Frankly, the concept seems a little lame when written down, but we 
were pleasantly surprised at how fun and addictive it was when we got 
our hands on it. It works well as an alternative to card and board games 
at gatherings, and is also a great ‘toy’ for younger audiences.  
While it isn’t essential, the larger display of a tablet is also definitely 
recommended. Our only major complaint is the price, which feels a 
little steep at $199, particularly considering the included 60 playing 
cards will likely need to be bumped up with the extra decks,  
which are purchased separately.

BONEGHOST THE TERRIBLE is going down! One hit to the face with 
‘revamp’ and he’s met his second death, for this is Syllablade, a mobile 
game that’s all about words... and violence against undead monsters. 
You start off with a little warrior and a sword, facing a skeleton.  
The bottom half of the screen is taken up by a 4 x 4 board of jumbled 
letters which you must use to create the longest words you can.  
Like Scrabble, each letter has a certain weight, so ‘rare’ will not be as 
powerful a word as ‘jazz’, for example. 
You get an unlimited amount of time for your go, so take as long as 
you need to think up the right words. Once you select a word, your little 
warrior will charge forward and hack at your opponent, chiselling down 
its health bar and earning you gold, which you can use to upgrade your 
gear and weapons. Unlocking items is definitely worthwhile, as 
spending the coin gives you a permanent boost to attack or health, 
regardless of whether you’re actually wearing that item. Plus, enemy 
attacks get more powerful as you progress.
If you create a word that has five or more letters, your ‘bonus tile’ 
meter begins to fill up, encouraging you to think up more complex 
words. There are levels, consisting of varying numbers of foes, and those 
levels combine into worlds, such as the graveyard or forest zones, where 
you will meet new enemies. Once you’ve filled up your bonus tile meter, 
a skull and crossbones bonus tiles appears on the board. You can use 
this tile to increase your letter count, and using it also initiates a long- 
lasting effect attack on your enemies, continually working down their 
health bars. The effect hangs around after one enemy dies, too.
There are opportunities to replay levels if you want to grind your way 
to upgrades, although your gold earnings will be reduced. You can also 
pay real money to upgrade your gear and get more gems (which give you 
health bumps, spells and so on). However, if you enjoy word games like 
this, the RPG elements make replaying levels less of an annoying grind 
and more of an actual brain challenge.   [ CARMEL SEALEY ]

WE’RE ALL GUILTY of being drawn to the
gaming equivalent of glitter. We all forget
it’s how a game plays that’s really important.
Which is just as well for Freeways, given that it
looks like it was scrawled on a wall; and yet it
has compelling foundations that place it at the
pinnacle of strategy-oriented mobile puzzlers.
The basics involve getting vehicles from A
to B, by way of road systems you quick-sketch.
Each single-screen challenge provides road
signs and buildings. Hold any of them and
coloured arrows spring forth, pointing out
where traffic needs to go; each arrow’s
thickness shows the volume of cars and bikes
that’ll be heading in that direction.
During the early levels, you get by with the
odd rotary or intersection, and feel smug when
you tap the simulation button and watch your
traffic flowing in fast-forward. Before long,
though, you end up faced with far too many
exits, and not enough space — so you make
use of the game’s ability to raise sections of
road, creating junctions that look like someone
dropped concrete spaghetti from on high.
One thing that won’t raise a smile, though,
is its resolute ‘no undo’ stance — a feature that
ensures immediacy but is infuriating when
you blunder and you have to start again.
That said, what’s a human doing designing
roads in this automated future anyway?

IF YOU BUY into Flower’s message, blooms not
only brighten up a space, they can even
conquer the ills of industrialism. The game’s
conceit is a simple one: you control the wind,
gently buffeting along first one petal and then,
as each level progresses, a veritable confetti-
shower of them. Your main aim is to brush
past the flowers growing in clusters across the
level, causing greenery to spread across the
murky landscape.
Originally released on PS3 in 2009, the
game relies on tilt controls to direct the breeze.
It feels like it ought to be a fluid, intuitive
interface, but it can be a struggle to make tight
enough turns.
These doubts are not enough to sour the
experience, though. Flower is a delight, with
your next steps always highlighted by some
clever level design. It’s impressive, given the
total lack of dialog, written prompts, or
tutorials, as you progress from spreading
pollen to activating wind turbines and
destroying the detritus of urban civilisation.
‘Experience’ is a more accurate word for
Flower than ‘game’ — you’re not chasing
points, fretting about time limits, or scattering
hit points. Instead, you float about watercolour
scenery at your own pace, accompanied by an
orchestral score. It’s worth slowing up to make
the most of Flower, since you could zoom
through it in an hour or so. [ EMMA DAVIES ]
KALIMBA HAS YOU control two characters
— one pinkish-purple, the other green —
who move at the same time along two far-
from-identical tracks. Make jumps, collect
pickups and get to the end.
It sounds simple, but trying to do it both
above and below at the same time starts to
twist your mind. That’s only the early levels,
too — new mechanics get introduced and
seem to keep coming, like switching
characters over, bumping one into a rock
so they can’t move but the other can, and
matching their colour to barriers they can pass
through if they’re the same, but that kill them
if they’re different.
The plot covers the search for parts of a
totem pole, which you reclaim by reaching
the end of levels. Deaths and missed pickups
detract from your score, and only a perfect
score nets you a golden totem pole piece.
Failure comes often, but it’s always your fault
— although the touchscreen controls,
with their usual lack of tactility and feedback,
don’t help. Getting a completely golden pole
means missing nothing and never dying —
a goal that looks out of reach when you’re
struggling to wrap your brain around
the game itself, but which gradually becomes
more attainable.

TEST BE
THE HOTTEST GEAR PRE
Sony WH-1000XM2 
ITS NAME MIGHT SOUND LIKE THE BOTTOM END OF A BARCODE, BUT SONY’S LATEST  
WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE TAKING NOISE-CANCELLING TO NEW HEIGHTS. 
THERE’S NO SHORTAGE of competition in 
the premium over-ear wireless active noise 
cancelling (ANC) headphone category, but 
Sony’s MDR-1000X from 2016 managed to 
stand out from the crowd with an exceptional 
balance of audio quality, noise-cancelling and 
ease of use. The WH-1000XM2 are their 
just-released successors, and build some novel 
noise-cancelling features onto the existing 
setup to create the most user-friendly ANC 
control scheme we’ve yet tested. 
The addition of a barometric pressure 
sensor that can determine the surrounding  
air density in order to optimise active noise- 
cancelling in an aeroplane cabin or at high 
altitudes is a small but useful addition. There’s 
the return of legacy features like a physical 
noise-cancelling button and the touch to 
communicate interface that allows you to cycle 
through ANC, audio passthrough and off 
modes quickly or immediately reduce audio 
volume and maximise ambient sounds from 
your surroundings. Sony has even attempted 
to bring the features of ANC into the everyday 
by adding a novel ‘Adaptive Sound’ setting that 
uses an accelerometer to detect when you are 
stationary, walking, running or on public 
transport and allows you to customise 
particular noise-cancelling profiles for each. 
These features are backed up by class-leading 
ANC signal processing that can be customised 
to your head size, hair style and and even 
spectacles profile for optimum performance.  
While headphones in this category are 
primarily concerned with noise cancelling, 
Sony has actually done a decent job in bringing 
high-quality audio to the table as well.  
In addition to the broadly available AptX 
high-bitrate Bluetooth Audio protocol, Sony 
has included compatibility with its new 24-bit 
LDAC Bluetooth protocol that will come 
standard on all Android Oreo devices and 
opens up lossless audio to the WH-1000XM2s. 
Sony has also included its Digital Sound 
Enhancement Engine (DSEE HX) which 
upscales compressed sound to approximate 
high-resolution audio from CD-quality files. 
Despite the impressive high-resolution 
wireless codecs, you should be aware that these 
headphones won’t offer the same quality as 
Sony’s audio focused h.Ear headphone range. 
It’s close, but not quite on par. 
Sony has clearly tuned these headphones  
for Android, offering a slightly bassier than flat 
profile with warmth through the mid range 
and clarity across higher frequencies. The 
40mm full-range drivers and Liquid Crystal 
Polymer diaphragms do a good job in 
reproducing everything from full bassy notes 
to crisp frequencies up to 40kHz. 
Battery life on the WH-1000XM2s is 30hrs 
when noise cancelling is on, allowing you to get 
through a week of workday listening without 
having to recharge and you can extend this by 
another 10 hours if you use a wired connection 
or switch off the noise cancelling. 
Coming in a minimalist black or rose gold, 
these solid 275g headphones are supported by a 
tensioned adjustable headband that evenly 
distributes weight and works alongside its soft 
leather cushions to keep the set comfortable 
during extended sessions. While much of what 
the M2s excel at are features you would expect 
from premium ANC sets, the intuitive control 
scheme, audio quality and a comfortable 
headband are hard-to-find components.  
This, plus the price, all combines to make what 
is our favourite premium noise cancelling cans 
of the year (so far).  [JOEL BURGESS]

Jaybird Freedom 2
PROVIDING FREEDOM FROM ALL THE WIRELESS IN-EAR ANNOYANCES?
WITH THE FREEDOM 2s, headphone-maker Jaybird’s gone back to the 
drawing board in an attempt to solve pretty much all of their main 
shortcomings. And the designer’s haven’t neglected sound quality 
either, despite the buds themselves being quite tiny. Yet they still sound 
great, delivering an exceptionally clean and crisp sound that’s well-
balanced and warm. There’s enough bass that you can feel it without it 
being overwhelming — the only considerable acoustic shortcoming is 
that busy music can often lose some of its definition, with midrange 
frequencies getting a bit overloaded with lots of instruments. 
It’s really usability that sets the Freedom 2’s apart, though, with a lot 
of small tweaks and improvements ultimately adding up to a great 
overall experience. A super-chirpy female voice announces what battery 
percentage you have left as soon as you turn the headphones on, and 
charging these in-ears is done by snapping a small adapter (which also 
serves as a backup-battery) onto the in-line controls. Although the buds 
only-last 3–4 hours at a charge, the pen-cap-sized adapter holds one full 
recharge. Resizing the cable that connects the buds is also simple.  
The rubber cable is woven between two small black tabs, and all that’s 
required to adjust cable length is to pull these tabs apart to shorten it,  
or pull the cable ends to make them longer. It’s as pain-free as we’ve 
experienced with wireless in-ears (well, barring completely cable-free 
models). They’re exercise ready too, with water- and sweat-resistance, 
can be comfortably worn over- or under-ear, and are very secure and 
quick to insert. Really, there’s nothing serious we can complain about 
here — this is a great set of in-ears, and our new all-round favourite.

Google Home Mini
A DOUGHNUT-SIZED SMART SPEAKER WITH PLENTY OF OOMPH.
GOOGLE HOME WAS the first AI smart speaker to officially make its 
way to Australian shores, and now it’s been followed here by its smaller 
brother, the Google Home Mini. This little marvel pretty much does 
everything the Home is capable of, thanks to the integration of Google 
Assistant, but there are some design and specification differences that 
potential purchasers of the Mini should be aware of (even beyond just 
obvious size distinctions). The Mini charges via a micro-USB cable,  
as opposed to the Home’s dedicated DC power adapter and plug.  
The other difference is in sound quality — the Home Mini has just a 
single 40mm driver for all audio output. During testing, we found that, 
at lower volumes, music was a bit anaemic, although crank the volume 
up to 70% or higher and the sound quality gets a lot better — it’s capable 
of filling a room despite the size, although it does lack the Home’s 
thumpier bottom end. The Google Home comes equipped with a 2-inch 
(50mm) driver and dual passive radiators housed in its base. We had  
the Mini sitting in a corner with the sound bouncing off the walls, and  
it could easily compete with most decent portable Bluetooth speakers  
in the market today. The only serious complaint we have with the Mini 
is around volume control, which involves tapping on the left and right 
edges of the blob, and because the exact spots aren’t marked, finding the 
physical volume controls can be a bit of a hit-and-miss.
Home Mini gives you full control over Assistant-powered features, 
like adding content to a Chromecast so you can stream movies and TV 
shows with “OK, Google”, or stream music from Spotify or YouTube 
Red. You can even link smart home accessories like lights that can then 
be voice-controlled via Google Assistant. You can still get recipes  
from the internet, catch up on the news, get a rundown on the day’s 
appointments and play the Stranger Things audio adventure game. 
Home Mini is exactly like its bigger brother, then, just with a smaller 
speaker and an even smaller price tag.  [ SHARMISHTA SARKAR ]

Tile Pro Series
A TRINKET FOR FINDING STUFF YOU’VE POTENTIALLY
LEFT BEHIND SOMEWHERE.
TILE IS A small device you can attach to or place inside an item
you want to keep track of. Its associated smartphone app can locate the
Tile, or make it play a sound for you to find. It can even help if you’re out
of range, by using its network of existing users to anonymously pinpoint
your stuff and get you happily reunited.
The Pro Series’ Sport and Style models feature an improved 60m
range, a louder speaker and waterproofing — so practically nothing can
get in the way of this device doing its job. Setup is simple, but our first
Tile unfortunately stalled during activation. The second went fine.
Locating a Tile can be spotty. It worked great at home, but failed to
alert us to a Tile we had left in a Pyrmond café for three hours, despite
hundreds of other Tile owners also being present in Sydney.
(Maybe our taste in cafés is just that unique?)
The app also insists on always-on access to your smartphone’s
location to support a feature that allows your Tile to locate the phone.
This feature means that, while you would normally be using the Tile to
locate it and whatever it’s attached you, it can actually be used in reverse
as well, if you’ve misplaced your phone. But when testing on iOS, even
though we chose the option of ‘When Using the App’ in Settings, we got
frequent prompts to choose ‘Always Allow’.
If you often lose things at home or work, then Tile is useful. But its
most attractive feature — finding lost stuff in the world — sadly fell
short for us. The bottom line for this device is that it’s promising but it
has some frustrating flaws.

Philips Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit
THE MIDDLE CHILD THAT COMBINES MOOD LIGHTING  
WITH AFFORDABILITY.
PHILIPS HUE RANGE of smart lighting systems are some of the most 
widely compatible and well-supported on the market and, in Australia, 
we’ve previously had a choice of buying either coloured bulbs or ones 
that produce a neutral white light. This new White Ambiance kit 
combines elements of both to give you a choice of tones within the soft 
white spectrum, from warm candlelight to cool blue daylight.  
So although there are no colours, you still get mood lighting and regular 
white light in the one bulb. 
The kit is comprised of two E27 LED bulbs, a Hue Bridge 
communications hub and a handy remote switch. And installation  
is as simple as screwing in the bulbs, connecting the Bridge to your 
router and setting up the Hue app. That done, light controls are at your 
fingertips or just a voice command away — the latter via Siri on Apple 
devices, or Google Assistant on Android. The kit works exceedingly 
well with both Apple’s HomeKit system and the equivalent Google 
Home environment. 
To make lighting your home easier, Hue’s new routines allow you to 
set up timers for when you want lights in different rooms to come on or 
switch off — which can even be tailored to specific tones (or ‘scenes’) 
— without constantly having to dig your phone out of your pocket.  
That can include things like bedroom lights switching on or off at the 
time you want to wake up or go to sleep, or automatically switching  
the home lights on after sunset. The location-aware routines are handier 
still, which will track your phone’s location and work the lights 
automatically as you leave home or return. 
In testing, our only real complaints were that the Ambiance bulbs 
weren’t as bright as we had hoped, and that the Google and Apple
digital assistants don’t come with the vocabulary to handle descriptions 
of various white light tones, meaning that, if you want to change a
‘scene’ or tone, it’s best done via the app. [

Canon EOS 200D
AN AFFORDABLE LITTLE DSLR PACKAGE THAT PACKS QUITE A PUNCH.
CANON HAS DESIGNED its new 200D  
camera to appeal not only to beginners —  
with a guided menu system on its vari-angle 
touchscreen display — but also to those 
looking for an easy-to-use shooter with reliable 
picture quality without the usual hefty bulk  
of most DSLRs. It’s one of the most compact 
and lightweight DSLRs available today,  
only marginally larger than its predecessor,  
the 100D.
The combination of a 24.2MP crop sensor 
(the same being employed in the very capable 
EOS 800D) and Canon’s DIGIC 7 processor 
makes the 200D capable of handling up to  
14 times more information than the outgoing 
100D, upping the light sensitivity in the new 
camera to ISO 51,200 in expanded ‘Hi’ mode 
(accessible via the menu), making the 200D’s 
low-light performance better than the 100D. 
The new processor also improves the camera’s 
autofocus (AF) performance and bumps  
the max burst speed up to 5fps (from the 4fps 
in the 100D) but video capture still only 
remains at Full HD 1080p. 
It’s great to see Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS 
AF system trickle down to the cheaper DSLRs 
— it’s previously meant forking out over $1,700 
for a higher-end model such as the Canon EOS 
80D. This sensor-based phase-detection 
autofocus system adds Servo AF tracking to 
the new camera and removes the sluggish  
Live View autofocus performance found  
in many older Canon DSLRs. The 200D, 
however, only has a rather disappointing nine 
autofocus points which are distributed in a 
diamond formation covering only a small area 
of the frame. This makes it harder to focus on 
specific points, however 49 contrast-detect 
focus points are available in Live View.
Apart from the full complement of manual 
shooting options, the Scene Intelligent Auto 
mode features a handful of Creative Filters 
alongside 11 scene modes, all of which are 
easily accessible from the mode dial. The dial 
opens up the menu system on the LCD,  
which, in turn, provides beginner-friendly 
instructions on what to do next. This Guide 
Mode can be disabled if more experienced 
users wish to stick to Canon’s traditional  
menu system. The touchscreen is extremely 
responsive, but does put a slight strain on the 
otherwise decent battery life of the camera.
Other handy additions in the 200D include 
a connectivity button to one side of the pop-up 
flash, which sets up a reasonably fast wireless 
connection with a smartphone or tablet, and  
a depth-of-field preview button found below 
the lens release. The 200D is also NFC-
enabled, so users can transfer images via 
Bluetooth as well. RAW image processing  
and conversion is available in-camera, making 
it easy to share high-res images immediately 
with friends and family. 
Canon has also made some lens aberration 
corrections on the 200D and thrown-in a time 
lapse movie mode to increase its movie-
making chops. In terms of image quality,  
we found the 200D’s colour performance  
quite reliable, and the 24MP sensor captures 
relatively noiseless images in low-light 
conditions. White balance performance  
was likewise very good, with the addition  
of the optional Ambience Priority that adds  
a warmer look to images to help retain mood 
and atmosphere. 
Although some may be put off by its 
plasticky build and lack of 4K video recording, 
there’s still plenty going for the 200D that 
makes it a serious contender in the beginner 
DSLR market. It’s a very capable and versatile 
shooter that comes paired with Canon’s 
excellent EF-S 18–55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens, 
making this one of the best kits out there to get 
anyone started on their photography journey.

Das Keyboard Prime 13
‘BASIC’ IS SOMETIMES BETTER.
WE’VE REVIEWED A few of these pro-oriented, mechanical keyboards
from Texas-based company Das Keyboard over the course of 2017, and
the Prime 13 is definitely our favourite. While Das’ boards are all quite
similar, small differences can ultimately add up to quite different usage 
experiences — and this ‘board is a perfect example of that. 
The ‘Prime’ in this board’s name is meant to imply that it focuses on 
delivering good solid basics rather than integrating fancy extras. First 
and foremost among those is, as you’d expect, a great typing experience, 
with Cherry MX Brown mechanical switches delivering reliable 
performance with subtle resistance, so you know when you’ve pressed a 
key without it having to hit bottom. 
This more basic board has ditched both the bank of media controls 
and the built-in two-port USB 3.0 hub offered in the Prime’s cousin,  
the 4 Professional — though you do still get USB passthrough, which 
requires plugging in a second USB cable.
Otherwise they are both pretty similar boards when it comes to 
shape, size and weight — the Prime is still near 1.3kg, meaning this 
beast won’t shift on your desk unless you’re deliberately trying to move 
it. The Prime does have one not-inconsequential advantage over the 
Professional — its keys are backlit by white LEDs, meaning it’s much 
easier to use in the dark, and therefore a better choice for gamers  
(or coders) who favour a dimmer environment. 
We also prefer the Prime’s braided USB cable (the Professional’s is an 
ugly rubbery plastic) and the fact that it uses standard fold-out feet to 
tilt the back of the board up, rather than the weird “shove a plastic ruler” 
affair used by the Professional. The Prime’s feet also give it a slightly 
steeper incline, which we’re all in favour of — the Professional’s angle 
was to shallow, to be honest. The fact that the Prime 13 is a good $70 
cheaper, dropping down from $250 to a more reasonable $180,  
doesn’t hurt its appeal either.  [ DAN GARDINER ]
Logitech Brio 4K Stream Edition
TOO MUCH WEBCAM, OR JUST ENOUGH?
LOGITECH’S ENGINEERS (WHO have, it must be said, been on fire 
recently) realised that they could create a 4K webcam without stopping 
to think if they should. Then its marketers slapped the word ‘stream’  
on it, despite the fact that rendering and uploading a stable 4K stream  
is beyond most PCs, internet connections and streaming hosts.  
And then its power-crazed number-crunchers decided $300 was a 
perfectly reasonable price. 
This is that dream device: a higher-resolution sensor, HDR support, 
wider angles, up to 90fps capture, and support for Windows Hello  
on board. The stand includes additional points of articulation, and a 
standard camera-mount thread, so the Brio can be attached to a tripod. 
The fact that its sensor can pull a respectable 4K image at 30fps 
shouldn’t be its major sell, though. It can certainly do that, although  
the results at full stretch are rather noisy and grainy. This is a webcam,  
as opposed to a broadcast-ready 4K camera. When you drop it down  
to more realistic resolutions, the power behind the sensor really shows; 
at 1080p 60fps, it’s crisp and smooth, and at 720p 90fps, it’s a perfectly 
acceptable streaming resolution. HDR support makes a massive 
difference to the colour depth. 
Below 4K, you can adjust the viewing angle, or use the much-
improved driver within the Logitech Gaming Software app to virtually 
pan and tilt its viewport. You’re also given a high level of control over 
brightness, saturation, white balance, and more. 
The Brio is, however, far too expensive.

MORE AND MORE Australians are ditching 
free-to-air TV and cable for streaming 
services. Netflix is still the leader, with over 
half of the market, but competitor Stan has 
around 25%. There are also loads of other 
streaming options, TV catch up services, not 
to mention content giants such as YouTube. 
And while generally very easy to use, there are
loads of ways to bring your streaming 
experience to the next level. 
Netﬂix
With a growing collection of excellent,  
self-produced TV shows, Netflix is must-have 
when streaming. Most modern TV’s include  
a Netflix app, which can be used with your 
existing remote control. But for those with  
an older TV, finding the right Netflix-capable 
media player can be a bit of chore. Our 
favourite options, such as the Roku lineup,  
are not officially sold in Australia. Apple TV is
a decent, if somewhat underdeveloped player, 
and the Chromecast is a very flexible and 
affordable option. 
THE NEED FOR SPEED
Knowing the speed of your connection and 
planning accordingly is very important with 
Netflix. For example, we rarely see 4K content 
streaming properly, even on a very fast NBN 
connection, due to other speed bottlenecks 
between our TV and the Netflix servers. 
Netflix actually has a speed test (fast.com)  
that connects to their own servers, so gives a 
more accurate idea than the more generic tests.
Make sure to test in peak times (such as  
the evening) to account for congestion.  
You need at least 5Mbps to stream in HD,  
and 25Mbps for 4K video — and that is  
per account watching. 
PROFILES, PLANS AND USERS
For $10 a month, the basic Netflix plan only 
streams SD to a single device. Upgrade to 
standard for $14 and you get HD and streaming 
to two devices, while for $18, you get 4K video 
(where available) and up to four devices watching 
at once. Being able to stream to multiple screens 
at once is a great way for a family to enjoy their 
own shows, or even share your Netflix account 
with a family member. But to improve the 
experience, make sure everyone has their own 
profile within the account. This keeps your 
recently watched list to your own shows, and 
avoids getting unwanted recommendations.  
It’s also great for parents wanting to make a 
locked-down kid’s profile. Profiles are most easily 
edited by accessing your account at Netflix.com, 
under Account. 
THUMB IT
Netflix uses a simple thumbs up and down 
system to rate content, but also learns what you 
like through your watching habits. It can be 
pretty accurate, too, but making sure to actually 
vote on everything you watch can really improve

Through the Android, iOS and Windows 10 apps, Netflix 
allows downloading of content to watch later when offline. 
Netflix has a special

the suggestions. Netflix also keeps a log of 
what you have watched, under ‘Account > My 
Profile > Viewing Activity’. It’s not just about 
looking ashamedly at your binge watching 
habits — any show can be deleted from the log.
Selecting the Rating tab on the My Activity 
page also lets you easily view, change or delete 
your previous ratings.
OFFLINE WATCHING
For those wanting to watch Netflix on their 
next plane trip, or just on the train without 
chewing up mobile data, there is a download 
option. It only works on the Netflix Android, 
iOS and Windows 10 apps, and not all content
is actually available for download. Just look for
the little down arrow (download) icon, or 
select ‘Available for Download’ from the app 
menu. You can choose the quality it’s saved at, 
and they can be selected for playback under 
My Downloads. The content has varied expiry
times once downloaded, and can be manually 
deleted by selecting Edit (top right).
OVERSEAS CONTENT
Thanks to varied licensing, Netflix content 
varies around the world, and we miss out  
on loads of great shows here in Australia.  
It’s a bit of a grey area, and against the terms 
and conditions, but it’s possible to use a VPN 
or Smart DNS service to access shows from  
a country of choice. Our favourite is getflix 
(www.getflix.com.au), which can cost as little 
as $3 a month. It has a two-week free trial as 
well, so is easy to test without any outlay. 
OTHER TIPS, TRICKS AND WEBSITES
There are some handy options hidden in the 
Netflix menu and help files, so it’s well worth 
exploring. Subtitle size, colour, font and more 
can be changed in your profile settings.  
On computer, keyboard shortcuts can make 
life easier — F enables full screen, Esc to exit 
full screen, Space pauses and plays, M mutes, 
Shift-Left or Right Arrow fast forwards  
or rewinds. In your profile, under ‘Playback 
settings’, make sure the highest video quality is
selected — you can also disable the automatic 
playing of the next episode. On the app, 
Netflix also has an option in the settings to 
help conserve data when watching on mobile 
away from Wi-Fi. 
Looking for new things to watch can be a bit
of a pain, but there are a few websites to help 
out. Justwatch.com makes it easy to search for
Netflix (and other streaming service) shows 
with a bunch of filters. Whatsonnetflix 
australia.com performs the same task, just for
Netflix AU only, and has a handy mobile app. 
Stan
With an impressive array of movies, and an 
ever growing number of TV shows, many 
streamers choose to have both Stan and 
Netflix, or alternate the two. Stan also tends  
to have the shows or movies Netflix doesn’t,  
so the two complement each other well. 
PLAYBACK
While supported on most new TVs and media 
players, as well as Android and iOS devices 
and Windows 10, Stan does have a few gaps 
when it comes to playback devices. Before you 
get started, it’s well worth checking out the 
compatibility list in the help file (goo.gl/
p1DnFe) and seeing if you device is supported. 
RATING SHOWS AND FINDING CONTENT
Unlike Netflix, Stan does not have a rating 
system and won’t recommend shows based  
on your viewing habits. For the lazy among us, 
that’s a right pain, and a little actual effort is 
needed to find new shows. Since the available 
shows are always changing, there isn’t a central 
list from Stan either — you just have to search 
and hope, or browse through the categories. 
Fortunately, third-party websites can help  
a little — JustWatch allows you to search Stan 
shows with a bunch of extra filters to help 
narrow down content. Finder.com.au and 
comparetv.com.au also have lists of Stan 
shows and movies. 
STAN PLANS
Picking the right plan is an important part of 
getting the most out of the streaming service. 
It’s kind of a complex lineup: starting at $10 a 
month lets you watch on a single screen in SD 
quality, and only downloads to one device.  
$12 a month gives you HD quality, and the 
ability to watch on three screens at a time, and 
downloads to three devices. For $15 a month, 
Stan gives up to 4K resolution, and the ability 
to watch on four screens, and download shows 
to five different devices. Stan doesn’t have a 
AFFORDABLE YET
VERSATILE WAY TO
STREAM CONTENT. 
With thousands of TV shows and movies, and some great original 
content, Netflix is by far the most popular streaming service. 
Whatsonnetflixaustralia.com helps make it easy to search for shows 
on Netflix with all sorts of filters not available through the app.

ASSISTANTS SUCH AS GOOGLE HOME,
SIRI AND CORTANA CAN BE USED TO
CONTROL YOUR MEDIA WITHOUT EVER
HAVING TO LIFT A FINGER.
If using the Windows 10 app, Cortana can be
used to control both Stan and Netflix. For
those with an Apple TV 4, Siri can also be
used with Stan and Netflix.
However, by far the easiest and most
powerful is Google Home, albeit when paired
up with a Chromecast Ultra or Chromecast
enabled TV. It works with Netflix and Stan
(and YouTube), and Google has a guide
(goo.gl/Y5Z8FB) to linking the apps to
enable control. It’s a bit buried but quite
easy — open up your Google Home app, then
the menu (three horizontal lines). Then tap
‘More settings > Videos and Photos’, find the
Netflix or Stan app, and tap the Link icon.
You do need to be specific with your voice
commands at first. For example, you have
to specify the streaming service, and
whatever your TV is named, but after that,
any commands work for the same TV.
For example, you could say, “OK, Google,
play The Good Place on Netflix on
Chromecast Ultra.” It will start playing
wherever you left off in a movie or TV series,
and you can’t specify an individual episode.
Further commands include Pause, Resume,
Stop, Next Episode or Previous Episode.
You can also use commands such as “Skip
back 10 minutes” (or forward, and any
chosen length of time), “Turn on (or off)
subtitles”, or “Change language to...”
(chosen language).

speed test service, so try an option such as 
ozspeedtest.com. Stan recommends 3Mbps 
for SD, 4.5Mbps for 720p, 7.5Mbps for 1080p 
and 15Mbps or better for 4K.    
 
PROFILES
Without a rating system, profiles are less 
useful, but still worth setting up. Profiles are 
created and managed by logging into your 
account in a web browser, and navigating  
to ‘Manage Account > Profiles’. Creating 
individual accounts allows each separate 
watcher to create their own watch lists,  
and viewing history. But more importantly, 
you can create a Kids account that has no adult
content. Alternatively, there is also an option 
to restrict an account by classification,  
with PG, M, MA15+ and R18+ options.  
When creating more than one profile, Stan 
prompts you to set a PIN, which stops anyone 
using the other accounts from accessing  
or changing the profile settings. 
OFFLINE DOWNLOADS
For watching on the go, Stan allows users to 
download content — though only to Android 
and iOS devices via the app. Individual movies
and TV shows will have a download button  
if the option is available. Download quality 
(and, therefore, file size) is set separately, in 
App Settings, while downloads are managed 
under the menu option, My Downloads.  
Other streaming  
and catch-up services
As great as streaming-only providers such as 
Netflix and Stan are, there is still loads of 
excellent content on free to air. Even better, 
most of them have online ‘catch-up’ services 
that allow you to stream the shows you missed.
Other options combine multiple channel 
catch-up services into one. Catch-up services 
don’t generally allow you to download content
for later offline viewing. Rather than a 
monthly subscription, the services are free,  
but typically include unskippable advertising. 
Depending on the service, they also can have 
limited support for older TVs or media players.
FREEVIEW
WWW.FREEVIEW.COM.AU
Combining a range of catch-up services into 
one, Freeview is one of the easiest ways to stay 
on top of content. It’s available as an iOS and 
Android app for just streaming, or through 
your recent TV or PVR for Freeview Plus  
that combines free-to-air and streaming.  
As the name suggests, it’s totally free (though 
has ads), and allows live streaming of free- 
to-air, as well as catch-up content. Using the 
app and a compatible TV with casting (or a 
Chromecast), you can watch free-to-air on 
your TV, via streaming. Freeview covers ABC,
SBS, Seven, Nine and Ten, as well as the 
associated digital channels. 
ABC IVIEW
IVIEW.ABC.NET.AU
A great way to stay ahead of ABC content, 
iview has live streaming of existing ABC 
channels, as well as other content. You can 
search for a specific program, or browse by 
category. iview is available via the web, 
Android and iOS app, some late model TVs 
and PVRs, as well as Xbox and PlayStation 
consoles. 
SBS ON DEMAND
SBS.COM.AU/ONDEMAND
With loads of classic SBS content, such as 
documentaries and foreign films, SBS On 
Demand is well worth a look. It also has some 
more mainstream content, such as Brooklyn 
Nine Nine. SBS On Demand is watchable  
via a web browser, iOS and Android app,  
as well as most late model TVs, PVRs  
and game consoles.  
PLUS7
AU.TV.YAHOO.COM/PLUS7
Channel 7’s catch-up service let’s you watch  
all your favourite free-to-air shows on the 
schedule you choose. It also has a range of 
everchanging content not available via 
free-to-air. Plus7 is totally free, but includes 
unskippable advertisements during the 
streaming. The service is available via a web 
browser, iOS and Android app, as well as most 
late model TVs, PVRs and game consoles.  
9NOW
9NOW.COM.AU
After a mandatory sign up, 9Now gives full 
access to the Channel 9 free-to-air content 
(including digital channels), as well as a range of 
other shows. It does include a recommendation 
system, and will try to target ads towards your 
interests. 9Now makes it easy to search or 
browse content, and has a decent amount of old 
classic shows available. 9Now is available via a 
web browser, some late model TV or PVR, iOS 
or Android app, Apple TV and gaming consoles. 
TENPLAY
TENPLAY.COM.AU
TENPlay covers all the Channel 10 catch-up 
content you crave, but doesn’t stream all the live 
TV channels. You don’t have to sign up to watch, 
but doing so gives a few extra personalisation 
options such as reminders. The TENPlay 
options for streaming are a little more limited 
than the competition, but include web browsers, 
some TVs, and its Android, iOS and  
Windows 10 apps.  
Get your fill of documentaries, foreign films,  
edgy content and even some mainstream media  
with the SBS On Demand service. 
Freeview combines catch-up streaming for Australian 
free-to-air TV into one easy-to-use service.

SUBSCRIPTION VIDEO ON demand has become big business  
in Australia. The launch of Netflix in 2015 drove a major increase 
in internet bandwidth consumption across the nation and played 
an influential role in the accelerated uptake of 4K TVs locally. 
While the first round of media players jumped on the initial 
opportunity, most of these are now becoming obsolete as they 
don’t output at 4K and most 4K smart TVs will have at least a 
couple of streaming services available directly on the screen. 
So what is the point of a media streaming box? Well, most TV 
manufacturers do deals to decide which streaming and catch-up 
apps will be baked directly into the screen’s OS. This annoying 
powerplay means no TV has every service and opens a space in 
the market for a single hub that gives you access to all of the local 
streaming and catch-up services in the one easy to access place. 
Sadly, the media streaming box market is plagued by similar 
conflicting desires, so whether you choose to be bound to 
Telstra’s broadband internet services by going with the Telstra 
TV 2 or you decide to get behind Foxtel’s Netflix-less media 
player, there’s no one cure-all streaming device. That said,  
one of the devices here will appeal to your particular home 
entertainment circumstance and give you access to all the 
streaming and catch-up services you desire. Since most 4K media 
streaming boxes are under $200, it’s also not a huge investment 
for those watching a lot of TV over the web. 
HOW WE TESTED
Media boxes were connected to a 4K HDR 49UH652T television and were used 
to search for and watch TV and movies. Devices were tested using various 
streaming apps including Amazon Prime, Foxtel Now, Netflix and Stan for app 
interface integration, password input and ease of program searching.  
Local catch-up services and live TV tuners were also used, where available.

Foxtel Now Box 
YOUR PERSONAL BOX OFFICE. 
THERE WERE RUMBLINGS of Foxtel launching its own physical media 
player to follow up its independent streaming venture Foxtel Now, but 
we were not prepared for the polished product it managed to sneak into 
2017. On paper, the Foxtel Now Box’s 4K 60fps output, Digital video 
tuner and Android TV-based OS is an impressive combination for 
something that costs less than $100. While we’ve been disappointed 
with the integration of some Android TVs here, the Foxtel Now Box 
(which is powered by US media streaming box the Technicolor Skipper) 
shows that there’s been a significant amount of effort put into 
developing the new user interface. Slotting in neatly with Foxtel Now’s 
existing Home, Live TV, On Demand and Kids categories, the Foxtel 
Box’s UI does a good job of displaying all of the Foxtel Now content  
you subscribe to, but it’s not totally exclusive. While it’s not as 
comprehensive as the Telstra TV, the Foxtel Now Box actually has 
access to some of the more popular media playback apps, streaming 
services and local catch-up offerings with the likes of VLC, Plex, Stan, 
Youtube, ABC iview and TenPlay all available. This connectivity buffet 
is expanded considerably through Chromecast integration, allowing 
you to cast any Chromecast-compatible app to your TV and even have 
the device respond to Google Assistant commands. On top of this, 
there’s hidden perks like live Foxtel channels for relevant streaming 
channels, smartphone remote integration which makes typing 
significantly easier and voice searching for the Google Play app store.

the first local device of this kind to include an aerial input and digital
TV tuner to let you watch local free-to-air channels. On the free-to-air
side, you have both a live TV interface for flicking through channel
descriptions while watching a show or the broader TV guide interface, 
displaying full program schedules. There’s also the catch-up element 
that includes the return of all the local catch-up services from the first 
model. The free-to-air offering combines with Foxtel Now, Netflix  
and Stan to offer an impressive smorgasbord of perfectly integrated 
streaming service apps. What is perhaps the standout feature of the 
Telstra TV 2, however, is the accompanying Android and iOS app.  
This app lets you use your phone to see the TV guide, change the 
channel, search for titles across all your subscribed services at once,  
and gives you additional remote functions, such as keyboard input and 
voice searching. The Telstra TV 2 app even has a list of recommended 
shows from all the streaming services on its home page that you can 
save to a central watchlist to remind you of what to watch later. Its only 
limitation, then, is the playback of locally stored media, which relies on 
one rudimentary file storage and playback application. Whilst you 
could use the last Telstra TV with just a free-to-set-up Telstra ID, there 
were some apps and services that were limited to Telstra Broadband 
users. This arrangement is likely to be the same on the Telstra TV 2, 
making it an excellent product for a niche market
4K 
ES STREAMING BOX IS SIRI-OUS ABOUT SEARCH. 
Apple’s latest update to its living room media hub  
n on Siri’s voice recognition to search for shows 
instead of having to labour away using the expectedly difficult 
10-foot interface controls. This works really well when looking for 
shows since Siri’s voice recognition skills have come far enough  
to get titles right almost every time, but also because the Apple TV 
is able to search across all of the connected streaming and catch-up 
services you are signed in to. Using voice recognition is a little 
trickier when it comes to login details and passwords, which 
requires you to instead use the rather cumbersome straight line 
alphabet selection interface and the directional touchpad at the top 
of the new remote. When not using it for text input, this remote feels 
sophisticated and user-friendly with most actions being a matter  
of swiping the powdery touchpad while giving you all the essential, 
volume, home, menu, play/pause and Siri buttons just below it.  
(You can also use an iPhone app, which shares the same 
functionality as the remote.) The Apple TV 4K is a little light on 
connection options offering just power, HDMI and Ethernet inputs, 
excluding the option of playing locally stored media, but you can 
still connect to a local server via Ethernet. You get a good selection 
of apps and games from the App Store including media servers like 
Plex, all the local free-to-air catch up services, Netflix and Stan. 
Foxtel Now subscribers won’t be able to connect directly, but you 
can always use AirPlay to cast from a Mac.

the addictive world of streaming TV for many and, considering
it’s price and user friendliness, it was just about the best deal for
turning your existing TV into a smart TV. Sadly, these golden years 
have all but gone with the blossoming of the local 4K TV market, 
since streaming in 4K puts a much heavier burden on your Wi-Fi 
network and many new TVs will come with their own streaming 
and catch-up service apps built in, there’s much less demand  
for a higher specced Chromecast. This dwindling intrigue is 
compounded by the addition of an Ethernet port in the base  
of the power cable that will give you the stable internet connection 
needed to get consistent 4K speeds. While we understand the need 
for it, it hardly says much for the ‘cast’ element of Chromecast  
and can be a difficult thing to set up if you’re not using a cookie 
cutter local Wi-Fi network setup at home. Continuing with the 
theme that you are the UI, navigating and casting from all your 
connected apps, it’s also not the most intuitive system for when  
you just want to vege out on the couch. The price is good enough 
that a few concessions are acceptable and Google has already done 
the legwork connecting plenty of streaming apps and catch-up 
services, but on the whole, the budget bonuses of the Chromecast 
don’t really line up with the premium experience, 4K TV 
consumers are looking for.

Laser MMC-X40
LASER’S ANDROID-BASED MEDIA STREAMING DEVICE CUTS BOTH WAYS. 
WHILE THE TRENDY tech companies are attempting to create  
the most minimalist remotes they can, Laser and its MMC-X40  
are heading in the opposite direction by using a remote that’s 
essentially just two remotes stuck together. The regular media 
playback controls, volume buttons and the selection wheel sit  
on the front side, while the underside is lined with a dual thumb-
sized QWERTY keyboard. In addition to this, Laser has included  
a magic wand feature and a home, menu and back button for a 
seamless Android-like control scheme that generally works well  
with the MMC-X40’s Android-based OS. That said, there were  
a number of instances, say while browsing Netflix, where it’s clear 
the app hasn’t been designed to work with a remote; and even though 
there are three controlling interfaces, none of them are able to scroll 
through pages easily. Because it can draw on the existing catalogue 
of Play Store apps, all the major streaming and catch-up services  
are available, as was an ample selection of media players and local file 
viewers. The unit uses an 8-core CPU with 2GB of RAM to deliver 
4K resolution at 60fps in HDR10+ colour. This video output is 
supported by up to 5.1 Dolby Digital audio output, DLNA or Screen 
Mirror casting, ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth connectivity, an SD Card slot 
and three USB ports for various flash drives. The MMC-X409 has  
a lot going for it, but much like its remote, the device feels a little like 
it’s been pieced together quickly, which, for a premium 4K media 
streaming box, isn’t ideal. 
IS THIS MEDIA STREAMER ‘THE ONE’?
TAKING THE SAME approach as Laser’s MMC-X40 (left), the MINIX 
NEO U9-H has shoehorned an Android Marshmallow-based OS into  
a near-identical hardware configuration that includes an octa-core A53 
CPU, Mali-820MP3 GPU and 2GB of DDR3 RAM. While MINIX has 
built two different media player front ends (a classically simple 10-foot 
menu system and something that looks like a phone home screen),  
both these systems use Android apps that have been designed to work 
with a touchscreen rather than a remote. While most compatibility 
issues can be skirted, not being able to browse streaming service apps 
like Netflix and Stan because there’s no controls that reliably allow you 
to scroll, is a pervasive issue. The NEO U9-H does combat this 
somewhat by having a dual-sided remote with a full letter keyboard,  
a USB dongle-connected air-mouse and Android powered voice 
recognition searching, but it feels like the added controllers don’t fully 
make up for the hindrances caused by non-customised applications. 
The Minix NEO U9-H has a generous Wi-Fi antenna that runs 
dual-band 2 x 2 MIMO for a more stable casting connection if you want 
to use DLNA or Miracast, but since it runs on an unmodified Android, 
you should be able to get all the streaming apps directly on the unit. 
Local playback is good, too, with three USB inputs, access to Plex, Kodi 
integration and the full range of downloadable Android media playback 
apps. While it definitely has a more polished interface and hardware 
look than Laser’s MMC-X40, it is plagued by the same incompatibilities 
which aren’t what you want from a premium 4K media player.

THE PLAYSTATION ISN’T JUST FOR PLAYING GAMES. 
THE NEW PLAYSTATION might not have the processing power of the 
Xbox One X, but it’s got more than enough premium components to 
be one of the most overpowered 4K media streaming hubs around. 
There is no way that you would buy one of these consoles purely for 
4K media streaming, but if you’re in the market for both, or you 
simply haven’t researched the streaming capabilities if your PS4 Pro, 
then it’s worth a quick look before you go out and buy anything.  
To the surprise of many, PlayStation decided to not make their disk 
readers compatible with the new 4K Blu-ray specification. While this 
is disappointing for movie lovers, the PS4 Pro’s media streaming 
capabilities do make up for this a little bit. The console has access to 
the Amazon Prime, Foxtel Now, Netflix and Stan streaming services, 
supplementing this with ABC iview, SBS On Demand, Plus7 and 
9Now catch-up services. On the whole, this is a pretty comprehensive 
library and the ‘Discover’ section in ‘TV and Video’ actually throws 
up a handpicked mix of popular titles from each of these content 
providers in a simple-to-browse page. In comparison to the app 
typing or voice remotes of media boxes, using a controller feels 
clunky and navigating the Amazon Prime interface is more difficult 
than it needs to be, but this is a small encumbrance compared to the 
obstructions you get from the non-tailored Android media players. 
It’d be hard to justify buying another standalone media player  
if you already have a PS4 Pro, but if you’re considering getting a 4K 
Blu-ray player, the Xbox One S (reviewed back in issue 55, page 14)  
is still the unit to beat. 
rosoft Xbox One X 
DOES MICROSOFT’S NEW CONSOLE CROSS THE STREAMS?
WHILE WE WOULDN’T recommend going out and netting yourself 
a new $650 console if you’re only interested in streaming services 
and local media playback, their broad app compatibility and regular 
software upkeep has made them ideal media hubs in the past.  
Sadly, the Xbox one X was plagued by some initial controversy over 
its poor 4K Blu-ray playback performance at launch (which has 
since been fixed by Microsoft) and when you look at the number  
of apps that were ported to the new 4K system in these early days,  
it wasn’t as comprehensive as we were hoping. While we were able  
to look at Netflix, Stan, Foxtel Go, Amazon Prime, TenPlay, Plus7, 
9Now and ABC iview on the new 4K console, it missed out on 
Foxtel Now, SBS On Demand and smaller services like Mubi.  
This incomplete offering is made up somewhat by a reasonable 
number of local file viewers and media playback apps including 
Plex, VLC and Cloud Media Player that’ll allow you to play locally 
stored movies and TV series. Under the entertainment menu,  
you get categorised trending shows and movies in the one place,  
but sadly, you can’t search across your subscribed streaming 
services using the one interface yet. While in years gone by,  
the controller was preferable to the 10-foot remotes of the top media 
streaming hubs, the increased demand in streaming has seen 
smartphone integration, facilitating keyboard typing, voice 
searching and convenient swiping control schemes to make  
the controller feel inefficient for signing in and searching.

MODERN HOME ENTERTAINMENT isn’t as simple as it used  
to be. Once upon a time, you’d buy a TV that was barely 
distinguishable from the competition, you’d use it for five, 10, 15 
or 20 years, then you’d replace it. Nowadays, much research goes 
into deciding which television is best for your home, what 
resolution it supports, whether it can stream, and whether it can 
iron your shirt for you (none do the latter yet, we’re afraid, but 
we’re sure it’s coming). One thing is consistent, though —  
the sound on modern TVs, no matter the quality of its screen,  
is almost universally crap. That physical flatness comes at a cost, 
and that cost is a lack of real estate for speakers that aren’t 
absolutely terrible.
That’s why you buy a soundbar — to ensure your home theatre 
experience isn’t like sitting in a cinema with cheap earbud 
headphones on. Soundbars are great if you’re not fussed about  
a big, multi-speaker home theatre setup, though if you wish to 
upgrade, some models can work as a component in these.  
And typically enough, there are dozens of soundbars on the 
market, so you’ll need to do a bit of research to decide whether 
they are right for your TV, right for your room, and right for your 
expectations regarding fidelity.
So without further ado, here are eight of the major models 
available on the market at present, ranging from cheap  
through to pricey.

SOUNDBARS  
ON TEST
LG SJ9
DOLBY ATMOS IN A PREMIUM BUT AFFORDABLE PACKAGE.
THIS IS ONE for the must-have-everything type — a 500w Dolby 
Atmos soundbar which is as gargantuan in size as it is in sound. 
On that note, you’ll probably want a decently large TV (wider than 
55 inches) because this thing is hefty, though seemingly against 
the odds, it can be wall-mounted. Of course, you’ll need a Dolby 
Atmos-supporting playback device, whether an Xbox One S (and 
the new X) or supported Blu-ray player, but even without taking 
advantage of that (still burgeoning and still not-widely supported) 
technology, this soundbar is probably the best on the market  
at the moment, considering the price.
Given the 5.1.2 channel configuration, you’re getting about as 
close an approximation to ‘surround sound’ as is feasible with a 
soundbar setup, and as far as lounge room immersion goes,  
the LG SJ9 holds up, well, admirably — compared to the 
competition. For real surround sound, there are a variety  
of add-ons you can purchase. 
It supports HDMI, optical and, of course, Bluetooth, and 
streaming music from a phone to this system provides a gigantic 
sound — among the best you’ll get before you stray into 
audiophile territory. For its cost, and its Atmos support, the LG 
SJ9 is this brand’s flagship for a reason.

Samsung HW-K950
AN UPMARKET, DOLBY ATMOS SUPPORTING FLAGSHIP.
SAMSUNG HAS LASHED out with the HW-K950: not only does it 
have the usual soundbar and sub-woofer bundle, but this 5.1.4 
channel home cinema setup also has two directional speakers, 
designed to sit up the back of the room. All in all, you’re dealing with 
500 watts of power here, which is, needless to say, a lot for one room. 
The sub and the soundbar itself feel massive, so be warned: this is not 
a unit for the humble. No one will think you deserve a payrise if they 
find this under your TV, and it’s very much verging into audiophile 
territory (not a bad thing).
The sub-woofer nearly knocked our modular office walls over  
[Oh, so that’s what you were doing — Sub-Ed], and the bar itself has  
a rich and balanced output. If you’ve got a spare two grand in the 
bank, you couldn’t do much better than this — our only real 
criticism is that the soundbar looks massive, but some people might 
actually prefer that.
Like the LG SJ9, this system boasts Dolby Atmos surround sound. 
Not all content supports Dolby Atmos, though platforms like the 
Xbox One S and X are capable of playing back content that features 
it. While the technology is great and we sure hope its better 
supported by content creators into the future, it’s not yet time to let 
Dolby Atmos sell you on a product. You’re better off assessing the 
HW-K950 on the usual terms for a soundbar, and in that respect,  
it’s quite exceptional. While it’s definitely not one to buy if you’re just 
after a quick fix speaker upgrade, it’s a bang-for-buck scenario if 
you’re looking for something edging towards a home theatre system.
Klipsch RSB-14
A PRESTIGE BRAND AT A PRESTIGE PRICE.
WHILE KLIPSCH DOESN’T quite have the brand power that some 
of the other brands in this round-up do (at least in Australia),  
this 2.1 channel Dolby Audio soundbar and 8-inch subwoofer 
combo boasts a robust, full-bodied cinematic sound. Like most 
soundbar packages nowadays, the RSB-14 can act as just one part of 
a multi-room speaker system via the DTS Play-Fi system (which 
supports brands including Pioneer, Onkyo and more). While it 
supports Wi-Fi functionality, accessible via the Klipsch stream app, 
it’s likely only of interest if you’re partaking in multi-room setups: 
HDMI for TV and Bluetooth for music is perfectly convenient.  
We enjoyed a pleasantly balanced sound across both film and music 
playback using Bluetooth (for music), HDMI and optical 
connections — most impressively, the bass was silky but never 
descended into crackle, playing nicely off the treble even during  
the most complex Aphex Twin tracks. 
This unit doesn’t boast anything fancy on paper: it’s a 2.1 channel 
setup and Dolby Atmos isn’t even a distant concern. Even so,  
the virtual surround sound does a good enough job of simulating 
the cinema experience. The unit boasts two three-quarter-inch  
horn-loaded textile dome tweeters with 90 x 90 Tractrix horns 
(Tractrix is Klipsch’s proprietary acoustics technology). It’s not 
cheap, but it ticks every box more than satisfactorily, and while  
it’s true that Klipsch doesn’t have the profile of your Sonys or 
Samsungs, it’s a brand generally known among people who care 
about audio fidelity.

Sony HT-NT5
SONY MID-RANGER THAT EXUDES CLASS.
ON THE LOW-TO-MID edge of the price spectrum comes this  
2.1 channel HT-NT5, which, as you’d probably expect, doesn’t 
come with Dolby Atmos support but boasts, at least, hi-res audio 
support. A factor usually in favour of Sony’s soundbars is that 
they’re classy-looking systems, and the HT-NT5 is no exception, 
with a premium-looking angular design for the soundbar and —  
by contrast — a completely inconspicuous subwoofer. The angled 
design of the soundbar also neatly solves the problem of jamming 
some powerful speakers beneath the bezel of your TV (at least,  
it does for those not planning to wall mount this thing).
This device won’t exactly blow minds with its volume, though 
it’ll definitely fill a living room and doesn’t clip at higher levels. 
Clarity appears to be the priority here, and on these terms, the 
HT-NT5 delivers a perfectly readable and never murky sonic 
spectrum which carries through to its music playback, too.  
As is pretty much the norm now, multi-room is supported,  
and you’ve got the usual array of HDMI, optical and Bluetooth 
connectivity, as well as in-built Spotify and Google Cast support, 
and Apple AirPlay. Though for Spotify and the likes, a Bluetooth 
connection to your phone is usually a lot more convenient, though 
the SongPal app is required if you’re looking to set up a multi-room 
ecosystem. 
The middle end of the soundbar market is pretty healthy by all 
indications, but this unit can stand healthily among its betters  
at this price point.

IS IT GOING TO FIT?
Make sure you measure the width 
of your TV, and its bezels, before 
shopping around — you don’t 
want your soundbar to obscure the
screen or look awkwardly huge 
below your screen.
DOES YOUR TV HAVE HDMI
PASSTHROUGH SUPPORT? 
It probably does if it’s a recent 
model, but if you want to use 
HDMI and not an optical 
connection, make sure it does 
(check for an ARC HDMI port).
SHOULD I USE HDMI OR 
OPTICAL? 
If you’ve got passthrough support,
HDMI. If you don’t, and you want 
to control your soundbar with your
TV remote, optical is the better 
and easier option. HDMI may be 
inaudibly better, fidelity wise,  
but it’ll take more wrangling.
DO I NEED BLUETOOTH? 
No, probably not, but you’d be silly
to buy a unit without this support,
if you want to use it to stream 
music from other smart devices.
WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN 2.1, 3.1 AND 5.1? 
Basically, the amount of speakers 
and/or channels you’re getting.  
2.1 is two speakers in the 
soundbar and a separate 
subwoofer. 2.0 is two speakers 
and no sub. More speakers means 
a better, albeit artificial, surround 
sound approximation, and real 
surround sound kicks in at 5.1.  
Be aware that more speakers 
doesn’t always mean better sound 
output: three speakers with  
30 watts each will push out less 
sound than two with 50.
DO I NEED DOLBY ATMOS? 
Maybe. This is new-ish audio tech 
which can approximate surround 
sound better than anything that 
came previous. Keep in mind, 
though, that you’ll need an HD 
Blu-ray player (say, an Xbox One S) 
and not all media supports it.  
If you’ve got the money, go ahead. 
For most people, it’s not quite  
a must-have yet.
CAN YOU WALL-MOUNT IT? 
Many come with all the brackets 
and bolts you’ll need, but check!

A SOLID MID-RANGER WITH A NICHE AESTHETIC.
UNLESS YOUR WHOLE home entertainment system is currently 
decked out in grey, the Jamo SB-40 doesn’t give a great first 
impression. Because, yes, it is grey, and chances are if you’re forking 
out for home cinema goods, you’re a bit of a stickler for perfection. 
But there is some charm to this staunchly European setup, not least 
its retro flair. You may not be familiar with the Jamo brand, but it 
originates in Denmark and is enduringly popular in Europe.  
It was acquired by Klipsch in 2005.
But how does the SB-40 sound? It’s a relatively inexpensive  
2.1 channel affair, but it pumps out a decently crisp sound at 120w 
(shared between the soundbar and the subwoofer), and boasts all the 
support you’d ever need (HDMI, optical and Bluetooth). At only  
40 inches wide (that’s just over a metre), it’d look great beneath 
modestly sized TVs. The wireless subwoofer, while as stylish  
(or otherwise, depending on your tastes) as the soundbar, is sleek  
and minimal. At this price range, you’re hardly getting sound  
that will impress or enrage your neighbours, but in the realm of 
mid-range budget speakers — and yes, this is ‘mid range’ budget  
by today’s standards — we were impressed by how cinematic the 
experience was, with the virtual surround sound working overtime 
to emulate a fully-fledged cinema experience. Music, even thickly 
textured bass-oriented techno, sounded satisfactory through it, too. 
Still quite niche, especially with competitors like the Sony HT-NT5. 
If given the choice between the two aesthetic preferences would
almost certainly be the de
THE SMALLEST SOUNDBAR ON THE MARKET.
OF THE UNITS which could count as ‘low budget’ in our test room, 
the Sony HT-MT300 fared the best — but only because it has a 
unique selling point. Like the Pioneer unit overpage, the HT-
MT300 also lacks HDMI compatibility, but get past that, and this 
2.1 channel bar and subwoofer package nudges slightly ahead 
simply because it offers a more compact form factor. The soundbar 
itself is 50cm wide and only 10cm deep, so not only is it cheap  
(it can be had for at least $100 cheaper than its RRP in most outlets) 
but it fills a niche that few other soundbars do. Whether you live  
in a sharehouse or on a boat, the HT-MT300 can accommodate you 
if you’re lacking in space but still don’t want to tolerate crappy  
TV speakers.
That said, the subwoofer can’t make the same boast in terms of  
its compactness, though you can hide it easily enough under your 
couch or behind furtniture. Meanwhile, the output can 
approximate distance in relation to what’s going on onscreen,  
but ‘surround sound’ isn’t even boasted here. Instead, you’re getting 
S-Force PRO Front Surround, which, if we’re honest, sounds great 
but isn’t particularly immersive in this product. 
Music playback is fine but struggles in terms of clarity at high 
volumes, but if you’re after something this compact, you’re probably 
dealing with either a small room or easily riled neighbours.  
The HT-MT3000 is a decent option if you want something small 
and powerful for this price, but don’t expect anything close  
to luxury.

WHILE YOU CAN hardly set your expectations high at this price 
range ($549 is the RRP, but this unit can be had for much less  
at major retailers), the SC-HTB688 does a commendable, albeit 
wholly unimpressive job at what it sets out to do. We’ve covered 
higher-ranged Panasonic soundbars in past round-ups and each 
have ranked among the highest in the list, but this low ranger is very 
much a meat and potatoes prospect: it’s inconspicuous in looks, thin 
but clear in sound, and while 3.1 channels indicates a decent attempt 
to emulate surround sound, you probably won’t write home about it. 
Or email home about it, even.
Optical, HDMI and Bluetooth are all supported — and as a means 
to playback music from your phone while doing the household 
chores, it’s adequate but definitely no substitute for a separate sound 
system. But on the matter of HDMI — neither of the Panasonic’s 
price range competitors tested for this round-up (the Sony HT-
MT300 and the Pioneer SBX-101) offer HDMI compatibility, so that’s 
one bonus in this unit’s favour. The subwoofer succeeds in adding 
nice heft to the overall sound, though the bar itself can occasionally 
sound ragged with especially deep bass — it can turn pulses into 
pops. But for TV and movie viewing, it’s a decent experience for this 
price range, and well worth it if you’ve got a modestly sized TV in a 
modestly sized room. If you can find it for around $300, it’d be well 
and truly worth it compared to the competition.
Pioneer SBX-101
A BUDGET OFFERING FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR A TV SPEAKER 
SUBSTITUTE.
AS THE PRICE makes abundantly clear, this is, by today’s standards, 
a budget soundbar package. Less designed for home cinema 
aficionados and more targeted towards those looking to improve  
on their TV’s crappy sound quality, this unit does the job, if simply 
boosting audio presence is what you’re after. Sure, it offers sound 
much more dynamic and immersive than your TV, but don’t expect 
to be wowwed by the SBX-101 unless you’ve been listening to  
ABC News through Apple earbuds for the last decade. It’s not just 
premium sound that you’re sacrificing if you opt for the SBX-101, 
either: you’re also missing HDMI compatibility, so get ready to use 
either optical or, if you’re really old fashioned, AUX cables.  
We didn’t test the AUX connection, but you can at least rest assured 
that it’s a satisfactory experience using optical.
200 dollary-doos is a lot of money, so we’re not advocating that 
you opt for the next bar in this round-up — the Panasonic —  
instead of this. The sound is by no means explosive but it’s by many 
measures better than what you get with your standard flatscreen 
TV. Still, if this is an investment you intend to use for years to come, 
it seems worthwhile buying something that at least boasts HDMI 
support. So the SBX-101, while decent for the price, is one we’d 
ignore unless after a very quick fix. Maybe one for the kids if they’re 
barking mad for better sound quality? Whatever the case, without 
Sony’s form factor selling point with the HT-MT300, the lack of 
HDMI hurts the SBX-101.

EVERY NIGHT, MILLIONS of us connect our 
phones back up to mains power, recharging 
batteries exhausted through a day of videos,  
social media, games and the occasional phone call 
or two. But increasingly, smartphones are being 
seen in research circles as the great untapped 
source of latent computing power. There are 
concerns over rates of smartphone addiction,  
but from a research perspective, the cure for a 
range of conditions and diseases from HIV to 
Alzheimer’s could literally be in your hands.
YOUR SMARTPHONE IS A COMPUTER
We’ve been saying it for years — smartphones are 
powerful computers capable of doing far more than 
we often give them credit for. But their portable 
nature makes them ripe for adoption in a range of 
personal-health initiatives and research that help us 
both collectively and individually. Smartphones are 
increasingly being seen as a broad-based solution 
for everything from data gathering to diagnostic
tool to collaboratively calculating massive
mathematical problems that may unlock the
answers to cancer and other diseases.
DREAMLAB
One of the latest examples of this idea of
‘distributed data mining’ comes from the Garvan
Institute of Medical Research and the Vodafone
Foundation. DreamLab is an iOS and Android app
that works while you sleep. As you charge your
phone overnight, the app taps into the Garvan
Institute’s cloud servers to retrieve data for
processing, calculating patient DNA profiles to
better understand cancer. All data is anonymised
before it’s downloaded to your device, but with
some 26 million calculations to perform and each
one taking around 5–10 minutes to execute on a
mid-range smartphone, it’s the sort of task where
the more computing devices you can throw at it,
the better. As soon as you pull the phone off charge,
the app goes into ‘suspend’ mode, preserving your
phone’s battery life for the day ahead. Currently,
DreamLab has two projects — Project Decode and
Project Genetic Profile. Project Decode looks at
solving breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic
cancers, while Project Genetic Profile aims to find
the answers to brain, lung, melanoma and sarcoma
(soft-tissue) cancers.
It’s not the first time smartphones have been
drafted into the distributed fight against disease.
The University of California, Berkeley, created the
BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing) app for Windows, Mac OS X
and Linux back in 2002, with a simplified version
released for Android devices in 2008. Today,
BOINC is available on Google Play for distributed
projects including Rosetta@Home, which studies
a range of diseases such as HIV, cancer and
Alzheimer’s.
Even older is Folding@Home, launched by
Stanford University back in 2000. Originally for

the PC, it’s now available on Android, powered
by Japanese tech giant Sony and recently made
open source.
However, the difference with DreamLab is
that the Garvan Institute has teamed up with
Vodafone Foundation — that means Vodafone
Australia users who download and run the
DreamLab app and use their mobile connection
to transfer DreamLab data will do so data-free.
RUNNING DREAMLAB ON A PC
Thinking about ways to boost processing speed,
we wondered whether you could also run the
DreamLab app using Android-x86, an
open-source version of Google’s Android
operating system for Intel-processor based
systems. We first tried installing Android-
x86/6.0-r3 (Marshmallow) as a virtual machine
inside Oracle’s VirtualBox virtualisation app.
While Android-x86 works and DreamLab
installs, the DreamLab app is designed to keep
tabs of your device’s CPU temperature and
won’t run if the temp is too high or can’t be
detected. And with no CPU temp data relayed 
to Android-x86 through VirtualBox, 
DreamLab gets no data and won’t run.
However, we did find an alternative. It will run
on Android-x86, when Android-x86 itself is
installed on actual hardware. You can find out
more and download the Marshmallow/6.0-r3
version from the Android-x86 website
(android-x86.org). It’s best installed on a spare
system with a spare empty hard drive or solid-
state drive that you can devote fully to Android.
How to install Android-x86 is beyond the scope
of this story (we cover this occasionally in our
sister publication, APC), but we had DreamLab
running successfully on an old Intel-powered
dual-core Compaq Presario CQ42 laptop with
a spare 64GB solid state drive and Android-
x86/6.0-r3 operating system. Note the
DreamLab app does consume available CPU
performance, so PC-based systems will need
adequate cooling.
Regardless, if you have any Android-powered
devices with at least Android 4.4/KitKat or later,
plus a decent Wi-Fi-connected download quota
if you’re not on Vodafone, this looks to be a very
worthwhile way to do your bit (or bits) for 
cancer research.
CANCER CONTROVERSY
Our phones can participate in distributed
analysis tasks like DreamLab and Folding@
Home, but what if your phone could instantly
diagnose those funny-looking moles on your
skin and tell you whether or not they’re
cancerous? While smartphones have no trouble
with traditional mathematical problem-solving,
there have been numerous attempts to use them 
to handle more complex and specific health
issues such as mental health or detection of
melanoma (skin cancer).
For a number of years, researchers have been
trying to develop a non-invasive method to
correctly detect skin cancer using only images
captured via a smartphone’s camera. But
according to one study from 2013, some of
those early efforts achieved ‘highly variable’
accuracy and that “three of four smartphone
applications [tested] incorrectly classified 30% 
or more melanomas as un-concerning”.
But by early 2017, scientists at Stanford
University had developed a technique using AI,
testing it against 21 dermatologists trained to
identify skin cancers. According to the report
in the journal Nature, the computer algorithm
achieved the same accuracy as the experts.
The technique involves machine-learning tech
from Google that creates a formula based on a
library of some 130,000 skin-lesion images.
The algorithm uses data mining methods to test
new images against that formula and makes a
diagnosis. The researchers say the algorithm
exists on computers at Stanford University,
but hope to make a smartphone version in  
the not-too-distant future.
MENTAL HEALTH APPS
When it comes to treating mental health, there’s
no shortage of apps available. But there’s also
no shortage of debate about their benefits.
Research conducted by Monash University,
the University of Canberra and University of
Melbourne published in 2016 reported many

evidence proving their efficacy. Despite this,  
a new study from 2017 in the journal World 
Psychiatry involving 22 selected apps trialled  
on some 3,400 participants found that 
"smartphone devices are a promising self-
management tool for [treating] depression".
Yet, with so many mental health apps 
available, Mark Larsen, Research Fellow at the 
Black Dog Institute and University of New 
South Wales, says users should consider four 
things when searching for a suitable mental 
health app. One, don’t just look at the ratings 
— popularity doesn’t necessarily equal quality. 
Two, who developed the app — do they have 
experience in mental health? Three, what’s the 
privacy policy — what happens to the data the 
app records? And finally, evidence-based 
research — is there evidence the app is effective?
TIME FOR A DIGITAL DETOX?
There are growing concerns that smartphones 
could be as much a source of issues as they are 
part of the solution. Internet addiction has been
a topic of psychology research for the last two 
decades, but in recent years, there’s been a 
growing focus on smartphone addiction, 
particularly amongst teens and children. There’s
seemingly a constant flow of reports of young 
people displaying addictive behaviour to 
phones, with one rehabilitation clinic director 
telling a UK conference in mid-2017 that giving
a child a smartphone was like giving them a 
gram of cocaine. 
In 2013, a Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS)
was proposed by researchers in South Korea, 
built on the Korean internet addiction scale or 
‘K-Scale’. According to 2016 figures from the 
US-based Pew Research Center, South Korea 
has the highest penetration globally for 
smartphone ownership at 88%, followed by 
Australia on 77%.
Not surprisingly, there’s been considerable 
growth recently in the ‘digital detox’ movement,
of users seeking to cut back on digital screens 
for a period of time, anywhere between 24 
hours to a month. The Australian Parents 
Council initiated a ‘digital detox month’ in 
September 2017 to help families set healthy 
boundaries for digital screen use. 
This also comes on the back of the Australian
Psychological Society’s 2015 Stress & Wellbeing
Survey finding that 60% of teens "feel brain 
burnout from constant connectivity to social 
media". If you needed further encouragement 
for taking a digital holiday, research released in 
June 2017 conducted by the University of Texas,
Austin, found that just the presence of a phone 
was enough to significantly dull the cognitive 
performance of study participants, even if the 
phone was switched off.

HEALTHY EATING
The signs appear to be more encouraging for 
other allied-health areas. The Good Tucker app,
developed by Uncle Jimmy Thumbs Up aims  
to help indigenous young people make healthy 
food choices when shopping. The app has two 
modes — barcode scanning that returns a 
simple thumbs-up/sideways/down health 
rating, plus a non-packaged food database. 
NON-INVASIVE GLUCOSE-MONITORING
Patients with Type I or II diabetes have to 
regularly monitor their blood glucose levels. 
Epic Health (www.epichealth.io) recently 
announced the development of a non-invasive 
glucose-monitoring solution in the form of an 
app. The Epic Health app is undergoing trials 
with 2,100 participants. According to the 
company, it utilises the smartphone’s camera to
snap pictures of blood flow through your finger.
Those images are then whisked away for 
processing and the glucose reading is returned 
back to the user. At time of writing, there were 
no details on when the app will be available.
HEART-RATE MONITORING
There are a number of apps on the respective 
[ 075 ]
app stores that attempt to monitor heart-rate. 
Going by forum comments, some users seem 
sceptical of the concept, but the technique is 
very similar to ‘pulse oximetry’. The heart-rate 
measurement process essentially involves 
holding your finger against the phone camera 
lens while the on-board LED shines light on 
your finger. The phone camera identifies in real 
time the tiny but measurable changes in 
reflected light to record your pulse rate, which 
the app displays on-screen. However, some 
users report varying rates of accuracy with 
some app/phone combinations, so it’s 
important to investigate before you buy, but also 
to not rely on these apps alone — if in doubt, 
always seek medical advice. 
Genuine pulse-oximetry, by contrast, uses 
red and infrared light to measure oxygen levels 
in your red blood cells. 
THE FUTURE IS COMING
With billions of smartphones in circulation, it’s 
not surprising to find them being pressed into 
service, as researchers mine increasing amounts 
of data to find the elusive answers to curing 
cancer. Despite a lack of supporting research  
in early app examples, recent studies are now 
showing smartphones also have potential in 
helping users with mental health issues. 
However, concerns over the rise of smartphone 
addiction are not only seeing increased focus  
in research, but a growing appetite of users for 
‘digital detoxing’, putting down screens to 
unplug and change usage habits. 
So could it be that the best thing to do with 
your smartphone is leave it on charge for a 
couple of days and let it run DreamLab?  
No doubt, the Garvan Institute wouldn’t mind, 
but research is beginning to show that a little 
down time may be good for you as well. Still,  
as health-treatment costs continue to soar,  
the smartphone looks set to play a greater role 
in improving health outcomes. 
It may well be that the secret to your future 
health is in the palm of your hand.

IF THERE’S ONE thing that elicits thoughts of the future,  
it’s artificial intelligence (AI). But AI is already changing our lives  
in more ways than you might think, such as stopping violence and 
flying our planes.
Driverless cars might hog the headlines, but in June 2017, Boeing 
tested an autonomous plane that could take off, cruise and land with 
little human input. Whether a self-flying cockpit would be trusted  
by the public is another matter, but most are already comfortable 
with autopilot technology, so who knows where this may go.
A company out in the US called ShotSpotter, meanwhile, has been 
looking at using acoustic sensors to pinpoint the location of gunfire 
during a shooting or crime. Machine learning confirms that a gun 
produced the sound and then counts how many there are, telling 
police what to expect.
These are just some of the many ways AI might change our lives  
in the coming years.
WHAT IF WE could stop diseases before they spread? That’s the 
goal of Microsoft’s Project Premonition, which hopes to prevent 
epidemics like the Zika virus from taking countless lives.  
The idea is to use mosquitoes as the ultimate field biologists.  
By setting up specialised traps in hot spot areas, mosquitoes  
will be captured and then studied, analysing what viruses —  
if any— they are carrying. Ultimately, the team hopes to use 
drones to identify hotspots.
The traps have smart compartments equipped with infrared 
laser beams. When the flutter of a mosquito’s wing is detected, 
the compartment automatically shuts its door, trapping the 
mosquito for later study. An algorithm can then determine  
the species by scanning the bug, taking into account the time  
of day and the amount of light available, before the data is then 
transmitted to researchers. It’s hoped this can be used to spot 
outbreaks before they spread.

WHAT IF YOU could access the internet anywhere in the world? 
That’s the idea behind Project Loon, Google’s ambitious project  
run by its secretive X branch to create a global web. The plan is  
to use high-altitude balloons 20 kilometres up to transmit Wi-Fi  
to the ground, bringing connectivity to the remaining portions  
of the world that aren’t currently online.
Filled with helium, the balloons are about 15 metres across. 
Beneath them hangs a small box that enables the Wi-Fi signal to be 
transmitted to the ground. Running on solar power, the balloons 
can stay aloft for up to 200 days. It’s not yet clear when the service 
might come online, although a pending patent dispute may delay 
efforts somewhat. Originally planning to build hundreds, Google 
now says it can bring the system online with just dozens, using 
machine learning to direct the balloons to certain areas.
IT MIGHT SOUND like an episode of Black Mirror, but researchers 
have begun using insect-sized drones to pollinate flowers in place  
of bees. The idea is not necessarily to replace bees but to compliment 
them as agricultural needs increase.
Researchers at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial 
Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan unveiled the drones in early 
2017, which use a special ionic gel to attach onto pollen. The team 
flew drones that dangled bristles made of horse hair (like a bee’s 
fuzzy exterior) laden with this gel. In tests on Japanese lilies,  
the team found the drones were able to successfully begin the 
process of seed production.
The research still has a long way to go, but the potential benefits 
are plain to see. While we shouldn’t turn a blind eye to bee decline, 
this research provides a promising back-up as needs increase.

A NUMBER OF breakthroughs in battery technology could lead  
to ones that are longer-lasting and charge faster. In July 2017, a team

by using ‘molecular pulleys’ to increase lifetime. These held silicon 
inside the battery’s anode in place, allowing it to remain 98% 
effective even after hundreds of cycles.
In 2015, meanwhile, Samsung unveiled a new rapid-charging 
technology that could recharge a phone in minutes. They used 
synthesised organic molecules inside their batteries to achieve the

SMOG IS A serious issue in cities across the globe, threatening  
the health of many people. But steps are underway to tackle it using 
some innovative new technologies that can pull it out of the air.
One such idea is the Vertical Forest project in Milan. This pair of 
residential towers hosts 20,000 trees and plants to absorb nearly 20,000 
kilograms of carbon dioxide every year and turn it into oxygen.  
The trees can also keep the temperatures of buildings down and filter 
out dust particles from traffic. Specialised aerial arborists scale the 
buildings to keep the plants and trees fed and watered.
Similar projects have since sprung up in China (the Liuzhou Forest 
City), Canada and elsewhere. While one would hope the problem

these at least offer another solution.

PLASTIC WASTE IS a huge problem, taking centuries to degrade  
when discarded in landfills. Biodegradable plastics, however, could be  
a lifesaver. Using materials that break down in much shorter periods  
of time, the wastage problem could be dramatically reduced.
One idea comes from researchers at Harvard, who created a bioplastic
from a substance found in shrimp shells. The substance is chitosan,  
a form of a polymer called chitin that’s responsible for the hardiness of 
shrimp shells. It is the second most abundant organic material on Earth,
so there’s no short supply. It breaks down in just weeks, leaving behind 
nutrients that can support plant growth.
Another idea comes from the Indonesian company Avani, who have

10 INVENTIONS TO CHANGE THE WORLD
HOT SOLAR CELLS DON’T 
JUST ABSORB LIGHT, 
THEY ABSORB HEAT, TOO.
WHILE SOLAR POWER is becoming increasingly widespread, one 
problem is that solar cells are not that efficient, being able to convert 
only around 32% of incoming sunlight into electricity. However,  
that could all change with hot solar cells, which could double  
the efficiency.
The idea is not just to absorb light but to absorb heat too. So-called 
thermophotovoltaics have been around for a while, but in 2016,  
a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
worked out how to boost their efficiency. They made the spectrum of 
the incoming light more useful for the solar cell, first by converting  
it into heat and then back into light. This is the first design to absorb 
more energy than a standard solar cell. The technology may still  
be a decade away, but the potential benefits are enormous.

The urine will pass into

out of the hollow 
membrane fibres.

The water vapour will 
condense to liquid and

You can access your shared media libraries 
from another computer, iPhone or Android 
device by installing Kodi on there. Once done, 
navigate to ‘Service Settings > UPnP/DLNA’  
on there and flick the ‘Allow remote control  
via UPnP’ to gain access.
Next, you need to physically add the shared 
content to your client device — from the home 
page, select your target library and enter the 
files section. Click ‘Add videos...’ followed by 
Browse, UPnP devices and select your PC.  
Click OK twice.
You can now access your shared media 
libraries — they won’t show up on the main 
screen; instead, select Movies and click  
‘Enter files section’ to manually browse your 
libraries using the same navigation tools as 
found in Kodi itself.

Getting the best 
Wi-Fi connection
We use a couple of Wi-Fi access points to 
deliver good signal coverage throughout our 
house and garden. How should we configure 
them to ensure our devices always get the best 
wireless connections?
[ RACHEL STELMACH ]
Ian Sleightholm replies: In theory, you should 
set up each with a unique name and password, 
so that, in the event of problems, they are easier 
to identify. However, some devices don’t simply 
connect according to the best signal, but first 
and foremost according to the priority list of 
access points, and so may well opt for a weaker 
signal if that connection happens to be at  
the top of the list. You can use this to your 
advantage by giving your access points identical 
names and passwords. They’ll still have unique

Share your Kodi
media libraries
I enjoyed your Kodi add-ons tutorial from 
issue 66 (page 98), but I’d like to be able to 
share my media directly from Kodi without 
having to use another program such as Plex. 
What must I do?
[ GERRY BUKOWSKI ]
Nick Peers replies: Good as it is, Kodi simply 
doesn’t provide as slick a user experience as Plex 
or Emby, but its DLNA-compatible server is 
widely accessible from a range of other devices. 
Here’s how you set it up...
Open Kodi and click the Settings button
followed by Service Settings. Select ‘UPnP/
DLNA’ in the left navigation pane, then flick
hare
es.
[ 084 ]
the ‘Share my libraries’ switch to ‘On’ to sh

You’ll need to add the video to your client 
device by navigating to ‘Add Videos…> Browse

IP addresses, and will automatically configure
themselves to operate on different wireless
channels. When your device then tries to
connect, it’ll give both the access points equal
priority, and should choose the one with the
better signal. This should, in turn, ensure you
get the fastest speed and a more reliable
connection. If you then have a wireless problem
and need to work out which access point is
causing the problems, you’ll have to rename it
until that’s fixed. One other important
matter is that you must ensure the common
password is long, impossible to guess, and
robust. Unless you’re in a remote location, it’s
wise to turn off guest access to reduce the risk
of anyone breaking into your network.
 
[ HARDWARE ]
Laptop wiping worry
I’m about to remove my laptop 
hard drive, connect it to my desktop and wipe 
the drive before returning it to the laptop for a 
brand-new Windows install. But I’ve realised 
that, when I put back the drive, there will be 
no OEM partition on the drive containing 
laptop drivers to recognise the optical drive or 
USB ports, and there’s no laptop drivers disc. 
How would I install these drivers to ensure 
they would recognise the Windows install disc
when I boot?
[ GERALD GIBSON ]
Nick Peers replies: Your laptop’s ability to boot
from a DVD or USB drive is not linked to the 
currently installed OS system. It’s handled by 
your PC’s BIOS or UEFI. You can test this now 
with your Windows bootable USB flash drive. 
Restart your laptop with the drive plugged in 
and it will do one of three things: automatically 
boot to the recovery media; offer you the option 
of pressing any key to boot from the recovery 
media; or boot back into Windows as normal.  
If it goes straight to Windows, restart your 
laptop again, but look for a message that flashes
up on first boot inviting you to press a key to 
access a boot menu — such as F11 — or enter 
the BIOS/UEFI configuration tool — typically 
Del or F2. If the boot menu option is presented 
to you, press the key and a boot menu will 
appear — check to see whether your USB drive 
is listed; if it is, select it and then press Enter  
to boot from it. If it isn’t, check that the 
configuration tool you’re using supports USB 
booting — if it does, make sure that the USB 
drive is listed. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to burn  
a Windows 10 install DVD using the Media 
Creation Tool, and then boot from that.

Has VLC hijacked my
music ﬁles?
I’m a little concerned, because I’ve just checked
my collection of MP3 files and they’ve been 
changed to a VLC format, and I’m not sure 
why.  [ DAN EVANS ]
Cat Ellis replies: Don’t worry, Dan — what 
this suggests is that the VLC Media Player app 
has become the default player for your MP3 
files. If you go to ‘Start > Settings > Apps > 
Default apps’, you may see it listed as the default
music player. Click the icon and choose a 
different player from those installed.
If you simply wanted to change the default 
app for MP3 files, open File Explorer, locate a 
file and choose ‘Open with > Choose another 
app’. Tick ‘Always use this app to open .mp3 
files’, then select your desired app and click OK.

Remove unwanted 
photo metadata
What’s the quickest way to remove all the 
metadata from a large collection of photos  
so I can burn a DVD slideshow?
[ TREVOR HAWKER ]
Nick Peers replies: Metadata can be found  
in a number of different file types including 
photos, and you might want to remove such 
data for privacy reasons (as it may contain 
personal information). Windows includes a
metadata removal tool.
01
Access removal tool: Browse to a folder 
using File Explorer, then select all of the 
files that share the same file type (such as JPG). 
Right-click them and choose Properties. Switch to
the Details tab and click ‘Remove Properties and 
Personal Information’.
02
Remove all metadata: You can also 
create separate copies of the files with all 
the metadata removed from them — useful if 
you’re sharing with others or uploading to social 
media. Simply leave ‘Create a copy with all
possible properties removed’ and click OK.
03
Selectively remove: Alternatively,  
you can choose ‘Remove the following 
properties from this file’ if you want to wipe the 
data from the original files. Click Select All to 
remove all metadata, or selectively tick the fields
that you wish to remove. Click OK to wipe them.
04
Select from multiple folders: Want to 
select multiple files of the same type from 
different folders? Browse to the top-most folder in 
File Explorer, then type the name of the file type 
(such as .doc) into the Search box. Hit Enter to 
quickly generate a list of relevant files.

Calendar doesn’t 
print my way
I am using the latest version of Windows 10, 
but I am having a problem with the Calendar 
app. On my desktop screen, I see lovely solid 
colours (as selected) for each event, but when I 
try to print out a copy of my calendar, all I get 
is a box and no solid colour. Can you please 
help?  [ TONY LAWRENCE ]
Nick Odantzis replies: This sounds like you’re 
referring to the built-in Calendar app, Tony. 
Sadly, it’s very much deliberate behaviour on 
the part of the app — presumably to save toner 
and ink and provide clarity. There’s no setting  
to switch this off, so you’ll need to hunt for an 
alternative Calendar app that gives you control 
over the printout. 
Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a freebie that 
offered this level of customisation. eM Client 
(www.emclient.com) pulls the same trick as 
Calendar, while Thunderbird (mzl.la/2tbUH7j) 
prints in a different way. Instead search the 
Windows Store for ‘One Calendar’, which 
recently added printing support, and which 
prints using solid colours as you require.  
You can try it for free, but printing requires 
upgrading to the Pro version for $7.45.

Pro tips for 
Windows’  
File Explorer
DISCOVER NEW WAYS TO VIEW, EDIT 
AND ARRANGE FILES AND FOLDERS ON 
YOUR PC WITH THESE TIPS AND TRICKS
[ ROB MEAD-GREEN ]
WHATEVER YOU DO in Windows 10, chances are you’re 
going to use the File Explorer at some point. It’s the graphical 
user interface (GUI) that enables you to find, edit, copy, delete 
and organise your files. And in Windows 10, it carries a myriad 
of useful features that enable you to do more with ease —  
from taking a sneak peek at the contents of files without 
actually opening them, to changing the default file and  
folder views. 
The quickest way to access File Explorer is to click the 
dedicated shortcut in the taskbar. You can also open it using 
‘Win-E’, by clicking its option in the Start menu (just above 
Settings), or by asking Windows 10’s helpful virtual personal 
assistant, Cortana. 
In this tutorial, we’re going to explain the tips, tricks and 
customisation secrets that can help you master File Explorer.  
So let’s crack on, shall we?
01  
REVEAL THE RIBBON
You may not be able to see the Ribbon when you first open a File 
Explorer window. If that’s the case, either click on the down arrow on 
the right side of the window, or press ‘Ctrl-F1’. You should now see four tabs:  
File, Home, Share and View. Select View to reveal the different ways you can 
change how a File Explorer windows contents are displayed.
02  
CHANGE THE VIEW
Under ‘View > Layout’, you’ll see a range of options, including  
Large Icons, Small Icons and so on. Mouse over each one to see how it 
changes the way contents are displayed. To make each change more permanent, 
click the option you want to use. Now if you close the window, then reopen it again, 
you will see the change you have made has stuck. You can change the view  
at any time.

01
QUICK ACCESS
Click any item here to quickly jump 
to the relevant folder. Some items, such as the 
Documents and Pictures folders, are here by 
default, but you can easily add your own 
shortcuts.
02
MAIN WINDOW
The files and folders in the currently 
selected location. Select ‘Ribbon > View’ to 
change the way these items are displayed —
in a list, as small icons or something else.
03

The four tabs — File, Home, Share

and on File Explorer itself.
04
PREVIEW PANE
Enable this option to get a preview  
of a file without having to open the relevant 
application. Works best with pictures  
and video.
05
CHANGE VIEW
You can switch between content list 
and large thumbnail views in File Explorer 
by selecting the relevant button — left for 
content list, right for large thumbnail.
06
SEARCH
Quickly find any item by typing  
what you’re looking for into the Search box. 
You can also search your computer using 
Cortana, of course.
03  
TAKE A SNEAK PEEK
Head to ‘View > Panes’ and click ‘Preview Pane’. You’ll now see  
a preview of the currently selected file or files (useful for pictures  
and video) without having to open it in a compatible application. You can resize 
the Preview Pane for a closer look by clicking and dragging the grey border  
to the left (the cursor will change to a double-arrow). Double-click to open the file
in the relevant app.
04  
SEE MORE DETAILS
If you want to know more about a file, go to ‘View > Panes’ and select 
the Details Pane. This reveals further info, including EXIF data in any 
photos. As you mouse over some of the details, you’ll see a grey outline appear 
around them. This means you can edit them. Double-click to change the current 
selection. You can add titles, tags, star ratings and other info right in  
File Explorer.

OTHER FILE EXPLORER OPTIONS
While you can select multiple files and folders by clicking and 
dragging or Ctrl-clicking, there is another option. Go to ‘View >  
Show/hide’ and select and check the ‘Item check boxes’ option. Every item  
will now have its own check box, making it easy to select them quickly.  
This section also lets you to show or hide file extensions and show or hide 
individual files and folders.
05  
SORT YOUR STUFF
By default, File Explorer displays items in alphabetical order. 
To change this go to ‘View > Current View’ and click ‘Sort By’ to reveal
a drop-down menu. You can view items by name, date, tags or any one of seven 
other options, as well as in ascending or descending order — handy if you’re 
trying to find the latest version or are trying to save space by weeding out  
the largest ones.
07  
CUSTOMISE YOUR COLUMNS
Another way to get at-a-glance info is to customise the columns File 
Explorer shows. In ‘Layout > Details and Current View > Group views’, 
you’ll see default columns, but you can change these. Go to ‘Current View >  
Add Columns’ and select Choose Columns. A Choose Details window appears.  
You can now choose the columns you want to see. Click OK once done.
10  
CUSTOMISE QUICK ACCESS
If you regularly access certain items, Quick Access can help.  
It enables you to pin them to its menu, which sits in File Explorer’s 
sidebar. Select the Quick Access menu itself and you will see your favourites  
on top with recent files below. To add an item to Quick Access, select it, then go 
to ‘Home > Pin to Quick Access’. To remove it, right-click it and select ‘Unpin from 
Quick Access’.  
06  
FORM A GROUP
You can also sort files and folders into groups. Again, this is handy for 
identifying certain kinds of file, such as any images you have tagged. 
To do that, go to ‘View > Current View > Group by’, then choose from your options. 
You’ll see the window layout change to reflect your selection. If you select by  
File Type, for example, you’ll see files are listed under File Type headings.
08  
SHARE FILES AND FOLDERS
File Explorer makes sharing easy. Go to ‘Ribbon > Share > Send > Share’ 
to upload files to apps and services such as Mail and Facebook. Select 
‘Send > Zip’ to compress them, or use the options in the next column to print, fax 
or burn them to disc. To share items on a network, select ‘Share With > Specific 
people...’, then choose your options from the window that opens.

MASTER IOS 11’S ACCESSIBILITY TOOLS
[ IOS ]
Master iOS 11’s accessibility tools
ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES ARE FOR EVERYONE WITH AN iPAD OR iPHONE.
[ CRAIG GRANNELL ]
ACCESSIBILITY IS SOMETHING many people 
consider an add-on for those with specific 
assistive needs. A well-known example is 
screen reading software, baked into Macs  
and iOS devices to help anyone with a visual 
impairment. But modern accessibility’s aim  
is to cater for everyone, whatever their specific 
needs. So iOS 11 includes settings to benefit 
people who have hearing or motor 
impairment, too, and issues such as vestibular 
disorders.
Chances are that if you don’t have any  
such concerns, you skip past the Accessibility 
section of Settings entirely. That would be a 
shame, because ideas and concepts geared 
towards easing device use for a subset of 
people can often benefit a much wider 
audience. And that’s what this tutorial  
is all about — highlighting accessibility 
controls that can be a boon for anyone  
who uses an iPad or an iPhone, whether you 
have a specific impairment or not. 
We start with three handy-to-have  
controls in the ‘Display & Brightness’  
section of Settings, before delving into the 
Accessibility section proper. 
01  
ADJUST DISPLAY ZOOM
Want content bigger on your iPhone 
Plus? In ‘Display & Brightness’, 
scroll down to View and tap Standard. In the 
Display Zoom page, you can preview Standard 
and Zoomed modes. Select Zoomed,  
tap Set and confirm to restart.
03  
MAKE TEXT BOLDER
The option below Text Size (or Larger 
Text in Accessibility) is Bold Text.  
This emboldens text throughout iOS, including 
app names and interface buttons. Unlike Text 
Size, it requires you restart your iPhone  
to apply the changes.
02  
INCREASE TEXT SIZE
You can alternatively adjust text 
alone. In Text Size (or ‘Settings > 
General > Accessibility > Larger Text’), drag the 
slider. In apps that support dynamic type,  
such as Mail and Facebook, text size will grow 
accordingly (or shrink, if you wish).

USE SMART INVERT
In ‘General > Accessibility > Display 
Accommodations’, you could 
always invert colours; but Smart Invert now 
reverses interface colours but not media.  
Alas, while it works for Photos, it doesn’t work 
for images in Safari.
07  
READ OUT A SELECTION
Use the Speaking Rate slider to 
preview how fast the OS will talk. 
Then switch to another app, select some text 
and tap Speak. Note how the current sentence 
is underlined, and words are highlighted as 
they are spoken. 
10  
TYPE TO SIRI
If you want to use Siri somewhere 
you have to be quiet, turn on 
‘General > Accessibility > Siri > Type to Siri’. 
When Siri is activated, you now type in your 
query. Note, however, that this entirely 
overrides voice input functionality.
06  
TURN ON SPEECH
Few people use speech on macOS,  
but it’s great for proofing your written 
documents. We suspect even fewer realise iOS  
is capable of the same. Go to ‘General > 
Accessibility > Speech’, and turn on Speak 
Selection to get started.
09  
REDUCE MOTION
Had your fill of iOS 11’s dizzying 
animations, such as folder zooms,  
and the app switcher? Most of them can be stilled 
by turning on Reduce Motion in ‘General > 
Accessibility’. Auto-playing Messages effects  
are toggled separately.
12  
TURN ON MONO AUDIO
Listening out for someone? Want to 
use just one earbud, keeping the other 
ear free, without missing half your stereo track? 
Use ‘General > Accessibility > Mono Audio’ to mix 
the left and right channels into a mono signal 
sent to both channels.  
05  
AUTO-BRIGHTNESS
The iOS auto-brightness toggle used 
to be in Display & Brightness.  
Apple now thinks you should leave it on, so has 
hidden it. If you ‘think different’, you can now 
find it in ‘General > Accessibility > Display 
Accommodations’.
08  
INCREASE CONTRAST

PERFORMANCE TIPS AND TRICKS TO KEEP YOUR DEVICE RUNNING SMOOTHLY.
[ LINDSAY HANDMER] 
BUYING THE LATEST wizz-bang 
smartphone is very satisfying, but older 
hardware can keep on trucking for a long 
time. However, inevitably, a clog of apps, 
updates (or lack thereof) or other issues can 
slow your device to a crawl. To help out,  
we’ve put together a guide to finding and 
eliminating any performance bottlenecks. 
Our instructions are based around a Nexus 
6P running Android 8, so your menus  
might be slightly different. 
FINDING THE ISSUE
The hard part is knowing exactly what has 
caused your phone to go from buttery 
smooth to laggy and annoying. Sometimes, 
it is obvious — if the change is very sudden 
after installing a particular app or update,  
for instance. But normally, it’s a combination 
of factors that can be very frustrating to 
troubleshoot. It’s worth noting that full 
RAM on Android is a good thing (it helps 
commonly used apps load faster) and task 
killer apps are best avoided. A good starting 
point is to check battery usage — rogue apps 
often use excess power.
If you do spot an app 
that is using an 
excessive amount  
of battery usage, try 
uninstalling it and 
seeing if performance 
improves. Another 
resource hog can be 
widgets — remove  
any you don’t use,  
or disable them 
temporarily to see if performance changes. 
Check the update history and try removing  
a recent update if possible, or install a newer 
update if there is one available. It’s also worth 
doing a Google search with your problem 
and phone model, as it might be a common 
issue that someone else has already solved. 
After uninstalling apps or making any 
changes, make sure to reboot so your phone 
starts fresh. 
CHECK PERFORMANCE AND 
RUNNING APPS
Most apps sleep in the background when not 
in active use, but 
some stay awake 
and can keep using 
resources. This can 
be a tricky problem 
to solve, and the 
easiest way is with  
a third party app. 
We recommend 
Greenify  
(goo.gl/LSsNw), 
which can be used to identify misbehaving 
apps, and to force them to sleep when not  
in use. For more in depth data, the free app 
Trepn Profiler (goo.gl/d7Seif) gives real 
time readouts of performance metrics,  
such as CPU use. 
CLEAR CACHE AND APP DATA
Apps store all sorts of data for later 
reference, which normally helps speed 
things up and avoid unnecessary 
downloads. But sometimes, an app can  
end up with something in the cache that 
causes it to act a bit screwy or create lag. 
Clearing the cache wipes that data, but does 
not get rid of any app data such as saved 
logins or game progress. Clearing the cache 
varies depending on Android version, so 
Google it to make sure, but it’s usually in 
‘Settings > Storage’. In Android 8.0, clearing 
the cached data is only possible app by app, 
under ‘Settings > Apps & notifications’,  
then by selecting an app, and hitting 
Storage. If a particular app is the problem, 
selecting to clear app data will wipe it back 
to a fresh state, just as if it was uninstalled 
and reinstalled. For more in depth data,  
Trepn Profiler gives real time readouts of 
performance metrics, such as CPU use. 
DELETE UNNECESSARY APPS AND FILES
That old notepad app you haven’t used  
in a year is unlikely to contribute much  
to your smartphone’s performance issues, 
but is still worth clearing out. The same goes 
for old download files, as well as photos  
and videos that are packed up elsewhere.  
To see what is using most of your space, 
head to ‘Settings > Storage’ and get rid of 
AS PHONES AGE, ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS 
BATTERY LIFE. IT’S AN EASY 
FIX IF THE BATTERY IS 
REMOVEABLE, BUT DON’T 
RULE IT OUT OTHERWISE. 
REPLACEMENT BATTERIES 
CAN BE QUITE CHEAP ONLINE.
Greenify gives you total control over 
background apps and can ensure they 
sleep properly, improving performance. 
Trepn is a powerful performance analysing 
app that can help track down rogue apps 
that are using too many resources.

everything you no longer need. A little bit 
here, and a little there might add up to a 
noticeable difference.
DEVELOPER OPTIONS
While not usually necessary, hidden in 
Developer Mode is an option that can help 
an older device feel a lot snappier. Activating 
Developer Mode varies phone to phone, but 
generally, it’s something similar to ‘Settings 
> About’, then tapping on the build number 
until Developer Mode activates. Under the 
settings menu, there should be an extra 
Developer options menu. Scrolling down, 
there should be three entries for Animation 
Scales — these control how fast things like 
menus pop up. Changing all three from 1x 
to 0.5x can help give a snappier feel on an 
older phone, or turn them off completely  
to further reduce lag, albeit at the expense  
of looks. Many third-party launcher apps 
(such as Nova Launcher) also allow user 
adjustment of animation scales.   
HARDWARE UPGRADES
As phones age, one of the biggest problems 
is battery life. It’s an easy fix if the battery is 
removeable, but don’t rule it out otherwise. 
Replacement batteries can be quite cheap 
online (try eBay, eBay.com.au) and websites 
such as iFixit (ifixit.com) have excellent 
guides for most major phones. Otherwise, 
check your local phone repair business — 
many can replace a battery surprisingly 
cheaply. For those with performance 
issues, thermal throttling can be to blame, 
so try ditching a thick case and seeing  
if there is an improvement. 
Many Android phones include a 
microSD card slot, and adding some extra 
storage is a good way to make an older 
device a lot more usable.  
FULL RESET
For hard-to-troubleshoot issues, the solution 
is often a full factory reset. While it might 
seem kind of drastic, it’s actually a fairly 
quick and painless process. The very 
important first step is to ensure everything  
is backed up — check ‘Settings > System’ 
and make sure Backup is turned on. Keep in 
mind that Android does not automatically 
backup call logs and SMS — try App Backup 
Restore – Transfer (goo.gl/TPpw3) for a full 
solution. Your previously installed apps will 
be reinstalled, so make sure to remove any 
you don’t use anymore before the factory 
reset. Once backed up, to perform a reset, 
head to ‘Settings > System > Reset’ and 
select ‘Factory Reset’. Make sure your phone 
is plugged in, and everything should be 
restored back to the default settings.  
You will then have to sign back into your 
Google account, and either let it restore  
your apps, or use your third-party backup 
prepared earlier. For those who want an even 
fresher start, during the setup process, 
select to not have your previous settings  
and apps restored. 
FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN 
EVEN FRESHER START, 
DURING THE SETUP PROCESS, 
SELECT TO NOT HAVE YOUR 
PREVIOUS SETTINGS AND 
APPS RESTORED.
Often clearing the cache can 
help bring a misbehaving app 
back into line. 
Reducing the animation scales in 
Developer Mode can help make an 
older device feel a bit faster.
Checking your battery usage statistics 
can help track down a problem app that 
is hogging system resources. 
If all else fails, a factory reset can solve a lot  
of problems, but make sure to back up  
all your data first.

A LOOK AT THE BEST FINGER-CLICKIN’ GOOD TEXT ADVENTURES 
YOU CAN PLAY IN YOUR BROWSER.
[ NATHAN TAYLOR ]
YOU ARE LIKELY to be eaten by a grue.  
If that phrase means anything to you,  
then this month’s column is for you!  
We’ve previously talked about the huge 
variety of retro arcade and console games 
you can stream to you PC using just a web 
browser, but there was a major category  
we left out: interactive fiction, also known 
as text adventures.
For old-timer gamers, text adventures 
were once the bee’s knees. Usually, they 
had no graphics at all: you would get text 
descriptions of locations and events, and 
just typed what you wanted you character 
to do and hoped that the language parser 
could understand you. They were awesome, 
and frustrating, and often insanely 
difficult.
There is still a notable community of 
interactive fiction developers around today, 
and a lot of the older games have also made 
the transition to web-based applications. 
So this month, we’re going to take a dive 
into that world and look at where to find 
some of the best text adventures you can 
play online right now.
HOW TO START THE GAMES
Today, most text adventures are not 
developed or released as executable files 
that you can just run. They are typically 
released in a format such as TADS (Text 
Adventure Development System), Z-Code 
(for Infocom games) or Hugo that requires 
an interpreter to play.
So to play a game, you need to load it 
into an interpreter. There are a number 
available on the web, but the one we find 
the most reliable can be found at  
iplayif.com.
But going to iplayif.com just by itself 
won’t do anything except give you a link  
to the Interactive Fiction Database.  
You have to ask it to play a particular game. 
And to do that, you type into the browser 
address bar: http://iplayif.com/ 
?story=addressofstory
...where ‘addressofstory’ is the web 
address of the interactive fiction file.
For example, a Z-code version of Zork 
can be found at: 
http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/
games/zcode/zdungeon.z5
Now, if you take this URL and feed it to 
iplayif.com like so:
http://iplayif.com/?story=http://www.
ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/
zdungeon.z5
...then you’ll see Zork start to play in your 
browser. Cool, huh?
Of course, it’s easier to just go to 
pre-made links rather than make your own. 
And that’s where the aforementioned 
ZORK
iplayif.com/?story=http://www.ifarchive.org/
if-archive/games/zcode/zdungeon.z5
The most famous of all of the text adventure games, 
it’s the one that most people know and reference 
when talking about IF. Thanks to a promotional push
by Activision for a newer Zork game a few years 
back, Zorks 1 through 3 are in the public domain.
For those who never experienced it, Zork is a fantasy
game that takes you through a dungeon where the 
goal is to find as many treasures as possible.  
OK, that description doesn’t really do justice to its 
awesome weirdness and offbeat humour — you just 
have to try it for yourself.
THE DREAMHOLD
eblong.com/zarf/zweb/dreamhold
A fantasy story that’s perfect for beginners,  
The Dreamhold is one of the IF stories most 
recommended by experienced IF gamers. It actually 
has tips and help systems if you get stuck, and the 
story is one of the most compelling and well written 
we’ve seen.
FIVE TITLES TO START WITH
THE WORLD OF INTERACTIVE 
FICTION IS A BIG ONE, SO HERE 
ARE FIVE TITLES TO GET YOU 
STARTED:
Zork playing through iplayif.com
Interactive Fiction Database comes into 
play. It’s a huge database of interactive 
fiction, new and old.
Head to ifdb.tads.org in your browser  
to visit it. There are thousands of interactive 
fiction titles hosted and linked from here, 
and it includes web links to online players 
like iplayif.com as well.
Finding stuff can be unwieldy if you 
don’t have a specific title you’re after.  
We’d start with ‘Browse lists’ and look for 
the Top 100 list. Of course, if you know

what you’re after, you can just type the 
name of the game in the search bar  
(we should note that the site does not host 
copyrighted content, so if you’re looking for 
most of Infocom’s catalogue, for example, 
you’ll have to look for another site).
Once you find a title you’re interested in, 
click on it. You’ll see on the top right that 
there will be a Play On-line link. Click on 
that link and it will take you to iplayif.com 
or a similar site with the link already filled 
in for you.
NAMELESS QUEST
iplayif.com/?story=http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/
games/zcode/nameless.z8
A fun Dungeons and Dragons-like experience  
that doesn’t take itself at all seriously, Nameless 
Quest even starts out with a joke about Bulletin 
Board Systems and goes from there. (It may appear 
to have crashed when it starts — just keep pressing 
keys and it will work.)
LOST PIG
iplayif.com/?story=http://www.ifarchive.org/
if-archive/games/zcode/LostPig.z8
A lot of interactive fiction comprises of either fantasy
or Lovecraftian horror stories, but Lost Pig is 
something a little different. Technically, it’s still 
fantasy — you play as an orc who has lost his pig  
— but the weirdness and humour set it apart.  
It supports all kinds of strange actions and odd 
verbs, and being a more recent title, it has a more 
powerful interpreter than many of the older 
adventures.
THE PAWN
msmemorial.if-legends.org/msa2/msa2.html
OK, this one is mostly for people looking for a 
nostalgia kick. Magnetic Scrolls’ The Pawn and its 
sequels were revolutionary in their day because of 
the gorgeous graphics that went along with the text. 
As text adventures, they’re often torturously difficult 
and punishing, but if you don’t mind that, then there 
are also plenty of cool moments as well.  
PLAYING ON PC AND MOBILE
PERHAPS YOU’D RATHER PLAY LOCALLY 
THAN ON A WEBSITE.
On PC we like Gargoyle (ccxvii.net/
(
gargoyle), and if you want to try playing on
e
mobile you can use Son of Hunky Punk on
Google Play. With these apps, you download
the interactive fiction file to the local drive,
then start the interpreter and open the file.
Gargoyle on PC running Zork.
HOW YOU PLAY INTERACTIVE FICTION
INTERACTIVE FICTION IS PLAYED BY TYPING IN COMMANDS. YOU TELL THE GAME WHAT 
YOU WANT YOUR CHARACTER TO DO.
The simplest type of command is VERB-OBJECT. For example: “take sword”, “open door”,
“hit troll”, “examine book”, “go north”. Most of the commands you’ll issue will be of this type.
You can include conjunctions and possibly adjectives and prepositions as well if you like: “hit the
troll”, “examine the dusty book”, “go through the door”.
Next, there are the more complex VERB-SUBJECT-OBJECT commands. These usually work too:
“hit the troll with the sword”, “put the batteries in the flashlight” and so on.
Usually, sentences more complex than this will be unable to be interpreted. Obviously, the
vocabulary is limited as well, so a lot of things you try will get an “I don’t understand” response.
Don’t worry — you’ll get a vibe for the language soon enough.
Finally, there are special game commands, like “Quit” (to end the game), “Undo” (to take back
the last thing you did) and “Save” and “Restore” (to save the state or return to a saved game).
On iplayif.com, the Save command does something special. You’ll see when you type it that the
web address in the browser changes. Bookmark this address, and when you return later, it will
resume at the point you left off.

HOW AD SERVICES WATCH YOU (AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT)
[ PRIVACY AND SECURITY ]
How online ad services watch 
you (and what to do about it)
AD SERVICES ARE GATHERING MASSIVE AMOUNTS 
OF INFORMATION ON YOU. IT’S TIME TO STOP THEM.
[ NATHAN TAYLOR ]
IT’S NO REVELATION to note that the 
amount of information that ad services gather 
on internet users and mobile phone users  
is astronomical. Depending on your privacy 
settings, they can monitor which sites you 
visit, what mobile apps you use and any ads 
you might tap on. They can often track your 
location and movements and get a surprisingly
complete picture of all your online activity.
It’s not just the ad companies that can do this.
Using the interfaces 
provided by those ad 
companies, individuals
and companies have 
the means to track you 
quite comprehensively.
Just this year, a report 
from the University  
of Washington called 
‘Exploring ADINT: 
Using Ad Targeting  
for Surveillance on a 
Budget’ showed that 
with just US$1,000 
anybody can use targeted ads “to track the
locations of targeted individuals as they move 
from home, to work and to other sensitive 
locations. We find that we can target ads to 
users of specific applications and at specific 
locations.”
It’s scary stuff, and it’s probably time that  
you took action to stop the ad networks from 
tracking you.
HOW YOU GET TRACKED
The thing about online advertising is that it’s 
surprisingly concentrated. While you likely 
use hundreds or thousands of different 
websites and mobile apps, those sites and apps 
commonly rely on a handful of online ad 
services to deliver ads. 
When you visit a website with a banner ad, 
that site is usually not actually serving up the ad
itself. Instead it’s just making space on the page,
and then reaching out 
to a third-party ad 
server like DoubleClick
and asking it to fill  
that gap with an ad. 
Suddenly, your PC is 
communicating with 
DoubleClick, and the 
ad service can upload a
cookie to your browser.
Then you go to a 
different site. It also  
has a DoubleClick ad 
embedded. Having 
placed a cookie on your computer on the first 
site, now DoubleClick knows that it’s the same 
person visiting both sites. As you move about, 
from site to site with DoubleClick ads 
embedded, the company can get a pretty 
complete record of your online movements.
The same applies to mobile ads. The ads 
embedded in your free mobile apps aren’t built 
into the app — they’re typically served by one  
of the major ad networks. Although they can’t 
upload cookies, they can use a thing called 
mobile advertising IDs (MAIDs) to individually 
identify phones to which they’re uploading ads. 
Your phone gives them a unique identifier, 
nominally so that they can deliver targeted ads 
customised to you. That ID, however, can also 
be used by the ad services to track which apps 
you’re using and at what times.
HOW TO DEAL WITH AD TRACKING
So how do you stop all this from going on? 
Start with these steps:
01
DISABLE THIRD-PARTY COOKIES
The first thing to do is turn off 
third-party cookies in your browser, which 
prevents embedded ads from uploading 
cookies to your device.
* In Safari, they’re disabled by default.
* In Firefox, you have to go to ‘Options > 
Privacy’ and select ‘Use custom settings for 
Turn off personalised ads on your 
Google account.
Enable ‘Limit Ad Tracking’ on your iOS device to 
stop advertisers from monitoring what you click.
WHEN YOU VISIT A WEBSITE
 WITH A BANNER AD, THAT 
SITE IS USUALLY NOT 
ACTUALLY SERVING UP THE AD 
ITSELF. INSTEAD IT’S JUST 
MAKING SPACE ON THE PAGE,
 AND THEN REACHING OUT TO 
A THIRD-PARTY AD SERVER 
LIKE DOUBLECLICK AND 
ASKING IT TO FILL THAT 
GAP WITH AN AD.

03
INSTALL AN AD BLOCKER
Ad blockers prevent your browser from
communicating with online ad servers at all.
We’re a little squeamish about them because
we understand that websites (including our
own sister publications) need money to
operate, but as long as ad services continue
to monitor user activity, they’re a useful tool
against them. Right now our top pick is uBlock
Origin (www.ublock.org).
04
TURN OFF GOOGLE ADVERTISING ID
Now we come to the stuff that affects 
mobile advertising. On Android devices,  
it’s called the Google Advertising ID. The 
Advertising ID is kind of like a browser cookie 
— if cookies applied to all mobile activity and 
not just web browsing. It allows advertisers to 
individually identify devices and use that to 
track ad-related activity on that device. 
For example, if you tap on an ad in a mobile 
app, that mobile app can send your device’s 
unique Advertising ID up to the advertiser.  
That advertiser can then use that information, 
along with the device’s history of other clicks to 
build a customer profile of you: what you’ll click 
on, what apps you’ve used and so on.
We should note that the Advertising ID  
does not specifically identify you by name. It’s an 
anonymous code — just a string of random 
numbers and letters that serve to provide a 
persistent identity for your device. Of course,  
it’s not a huge leap for an advertiser to link an 
Advertising ID with an individual, especially  
if you make online purchases.
To turn it off, go to your Android device and 
find the Google Settings app in your App Drawer 
or the Google settings menu in Settings (tip for 
Samsung TouchWiz users: it’s found under 
Applications). Under Services, tap on Ads,  
then select the switch to ‘Opt out of Ads 
Personalisation’. Also tap on ‘Reset advertising 
ID’. Doing this resets your ID and prevents it 
from being sent in the future.
While we’re at it, go to adssettings.google.com 
in a browser and click the switch to ‘Turn off Ads 
Personalisation’ for your whole Google account. 
This will only apply to ads delivered by Google —  
including its AdMob (that’s the ads embedded  
in many Android apps) and AdSense  
(ads embedded in websites).
05
TURN OFF APPLE IDFA.
iOS has a very similar system to 
Android’s Advertising ID. On iOS, it’s called  
the Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), and it 
works on the same principle the Google 
Advertising ID — a unique device identifier  
that apps and sites can use to build a history  
of advertising-related activity.
We recommend you turn it off by going to 
‘Settings > Privacy’ on your iOS device and 
tapping on Advertising. Enable the toggle  
for ‘Limit Ad Tracking’, and then tap on  
‘Reset Advertising Identifier’ to delete your 
existing profile.
With that done, the amount of information 
that your mobile sends to advertising companies 
should be much reduced. And that can only be  
a net positive for your online privacy.

* In Edge, go to ‘Options > Settings > 
Advanced Settings’ and select the option  
to ‘Block on Third Party Cookies’ under the 
Cookies section.
* In Chrome go to ‘Settings > Advanced > 
Privacy and Security/Content Settings > 
Cookies’ to find the switch to turn off 
third-party cookies.
02
INSTALL A FILTERING TOOL
There are browser add-ons that will 
block third-party tracking cookies, analytics 
tools and other things that can potentially be 
used to track you online (such as Facebook 
and Twitter widgets that dial back to their 
home servers).
The best of these are Disconnect  
(disconnect.me) and Ghostery (ghostery.com), 
which strip tracking elements out of websites, 
preventing them from dialling home to track 
your online activity.  
Turn off Ads personalisation in Google.
 Ads are everywhere. And they’re watching you.
Given that Google is the world’s largest provider of online ads,  
it not surprisingly buries Chrome’s third-party cookies option deep, 
deep in the settings. But it’s there, and you should switch it off.
Disconnect is something we can’t recommend 
enough.

GETTING TO KNOW POWERLINE NETWORKING
WE’VE TALKED A lot in this column about
how you can use range extenders and mesh
networks to get Wi-Fi to reach the far corners
of your home. But there’s another great
technology available for getting better home
coverage: powerline networking, aka
HomePlug AV, aka IEEE 1901.
As the name implies, powerline networking
uses your home’s electrical wires to get data
from one point to another. Because it’s using
physical wires, it’s less susceptible to
contention and interference than Wi-Fi,
and in most cases, it will provide better
and more reliable performance. It’s a great
alternative to running Ethernet cabling
through your house, and is extremely easy
to set up.
WHAT IT’S GOOD FOR
Powerline networking provides a stable
point-to-point network connection, similar
to Ethernet. It can be used to connect wired
devices in remote corners of your house.
If you have a game console out in the granny
flat, for example, it might be better to connect
it with a powerline adapter than try to force
the Wi-Fi signal to reach it.
It’s also very commonly used for bridging
wireless access points. Wireless extenders and
most mesh networks have a problem: when
they retransmit wireless signals, they’re
competing with themselves for airtime.
That can lead to some serious performance
issues. And then there’s the fact that they need
to be carefully placed so that each wireless
node can talk to each other reliably.
Using powerline adapters to connect your
mesh or access points with each other solves
both of those problems. We’ve often noted that
the ideal wireless setup is a mesh network with
the mesh points connected to each other with
physical cables — powerline is one way
you can achieve that.
HOW YOU SET IT UP
Powerline adapters are typically sold

in pre-configured pairs. You just plug each 
into a wall socket somewhere in your house 
and they will form a data link between them. 
Then you have to connect them to the rest of 
your network. Typically, each adapter will have 
an Ethernet port. Using an Ethernet cable, you 
connect this to either a user device like a PC, 
or to a networking router, switch or access 
point. All the devices connected to one 
HOW HOMEPLUG
TECHNOLOGY WORKS
Much the same way that DSL uses spare
bandwidth on your phone lines, powerline
networking uses spare bandwidth on your
home’s copper electrical cables. Electrical
signals operate at 50Hz, but that leaves a lot
of space for other signals to be carried at
different frequencies. Newer models also
use a technique that employs all three wires
(live, neutral and earth) to provide more
bandwidth.

FIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW 
ABOUT POWERLINE NETWORKING
THERE ARE MULTIPLE SPEEDS AVAILABLE:
There have been several generations of powerline 
products, with ever increasing speeds. The current 
fastest speeds available are from the latest 
HomePlug AV2 standard, and go up to 1,200Mbps. 
You should look for an adapter that reaches these 
speeds.
SPEEDS CAN VARY BETWEEN HOMES:
Much like Wi-Fi, actual speeds with powerline are 
considerably lower than the theoretical speed.  
How much lower depends entirely on your home 
electrical cabling. The length of cable between  
the power points, the quality of the cables,  
EM interference and a host of other factors will 
determine the actual speed of the connection. 
Unfortunately, how well it will work for you is a little 
bit of a lottery. Barring a call out to an electrician  
to test the quality of your power wiring, all you can 
really do is plug in and hope for the best.
That said, you will typically get better speeds 
than Wi-Fi at a given range. What’s more, powerline 
speeds tend to be very stable. Where Wi-Fi signals 
can fluctuate wildly (which can be painful for 
streaming video or online gaming), powerline 
connection speeds tend to be quite consistent.
 
Speeds currently go up to 1,200Mbps. 
This is also known as HomePlug AV1200.
The TP-Link TL-WPA7510 and 
Netgear PowerLINE 1000 + 
WiFi are powerline kits  
that have wireless access 
points built in.

to all of the devices connected to the others.
Usually, you don’t even have to configure
anything.
HomePlug AV does allow you to add 
additional adapters to the network, as well as 
change the security password. The security 
password is a common code, a bit like a Wi-Fi 
password, that encrypts communications 
between adapters, as well as identifies the 
network that they’re attached to. Usually, 
passwords and additional devices are added 
using an app or web console, just like a router.
We should note that, given how common  
it is to use powerline as a way of connecting 
Wi-Fi access points and mesh points, some 
vendors have also started selling integrated 
powerline and Wi-Fi devices. These devices 
serve as both powerline adapters and wireless 
access points, providing everything you need 
to create a second wireless network in your 
home and bridge it back to your main 
network.
IT IS SECURE:
You may be worried that other people might be able 
to intercept your signals, especially if you live in  
an apartment block with shared electrical wiring. 
Don’t worry — HomePlug AV signals are encrypted 
with 128-bit AES. Even if somebody could tap into 
your electrical wiring, they still wouldn’t be able  
to read the data.
On top of that, your data won’t be ‘broadcast’ 
onto the greater electrical grid. As soon as it hits a 
transformer (like the one just outside your house), 
the signal will be scrambled and lost.
AVOID SURGE PROTECTORS:
A powerline adapter needs to be plugged directly 
into a wall socket. If you plug it into a power board 
with a surge protector, that surge protector will likely 
interfere with the signal, reducing speeds or 
blocking it entirely.
Unfortunately, that means that powerline 
adapters are themselves often vulnerable to surges, 
and we’ve seen several burn out over the years. 
Thankfully, most products have become better  
at protecting themselves from major surges.
BRAND COMPATIBILITY CAN BE SHAKY:
Technically, any device that conforms to the 
HomePlug spec should be able to talk with any other 
HomePlug device, so theoretically, you could have 
adapters from different brands. In practice,  
that’s a bad idea. There are several makers  
of powerline chips, and those chips don’t always 
play nice. It’s best to stick to one brand for  
the best compatibility and speed. 
Surge protectors 
will mess up your 
powerline signals.

BLEND MODE CATEGORIES
WITH SO MANY BLEND MODES TO CHOOSE FROM,
IT HELPS TO THINK OF THEM AS DISTINCT SETS...
The Blend Mode list is divided into six categories. The first
section contains Normal and Dissolve [1]. The next holds
the Darken blend modes [2]. Each of these five will have
the effect of darkening down an image. Below this is the
Lighten set [3], which — you’ve guessed it — all have a
lightening effect.
Next is the Overlay set [4]. These seven modes both
lighten and darken at the same time, creating contrast
in different ways. Below this is the Difference set [5] —
five modes that have an inverting effect on pixels. Finally, the HSL modes [6]
in the bottom section blend based on either colour or luminance values.
Here we’ve made three copies of our city layer: the top one is set to Difference [7],
the middle to Screen [8] and the bottom is flipped vertically and set to Screen [9].

EXPERT TIP
PHOTOSHOP ANATOMY
BLEND TEXTURES
A simple texture blended using the Overlay 
or Soft Light mode can work wonders over 
your photos by giving them a weathered, 
aged look. It helps to build up a texture 
library, so head out with your camera and 
capture the textures all around you — we’ve 
been using the same old battered baking 
tray textures for years, to great effect.
OPACITY OR FILL?
Most Blend modes will 
behave in the same way 
whether you adjust the Fill  
or Opacity of the layer, but a 
select few are different.  
Color Burn, Linear Burn,  
Color Dodge, Linear Dodge 
(Add), Vivid Light, Linear 
Light, Hard Mix and Difference 
all give a varying effect at 
50% Fill than 50% opacity. 
Experiment to see how  
each works.
BRUSH BLEND MODES
Several tools, including the Brush tool, feature 
a mode dropdown similar to layer Blend modes,  
but they affect how the tool applies paint.  
For example, if we set the Brush tool to the Color 
Blend mode, it will apply colour but won’t affect 
detail. The Brush tool offers two unique modes: 
Behind lets you apply paint to transparent pixels, 
and Clear works like an eraser.
WHAT ARE BLEND MODES?
Blend modes work by blending pixels on the
selected layer with those below. They each
employ a different algorithm that uses the
brightness or colour values of individual 
pixels to come up with a new effect. With 27
modes, it’s not always clear which Blend
mode will give you the best results, 
so experimentation is key.
ADJUSTMENT LAYERS
Blend modes can be used in 
combination with Adjustment 
Layers for all kinds of tricks. 
For example, if you add a 
Black and White Adjustment 
Layer and set it to Luminosity, 
instead of getting a black- 
and-white effect, you instead 
gain the ability to alter the 
brightness of the six colour 
ranges on offer.
LIGHTEN AND SCREEN, 
DARKEN AND MULTIPLY
These four blend modes can be hugely 
useful when compositing images. Lighten 
only allows brighter pixels to show, while 
Screen multiplies the brightness values  
(in the same way a traditional double 
exposure would). Darken and Multiply do  
the opposite for a darkening effect.

MASTER YOUR DSLR: IN-CAMERA PROCESSING
QUITE A LOT of things happen very quickly 
when you press the shutter release button on 
your camera. The light reflected off the subject 
is captured by the lens and fed to the image 
sensor, where it’s recorded as an analogue 
electrical signal then turned into digital data 
by the analogue/digital converter.
All of this typically happens in a fraction  
of a second, but it’s really just the start of the 
process of creating an image. Before the file 
ends up being temporarily stored in the 
camera’s buffer prior to being written to the 
memory card, the massive amount of data 
created for each image you shoot has to be 
crunched. Digital processing that’s carried out 
at this stage includes adjustment of the white 
balance, colours and contrast, along with lens 
corrections, noise reduction and sharpening. 
How — or rather when — these adjustments 
are applied depends on the file format selected 
on the camera. In the case of JPEGs or TIFFs, 
they’re applied to the image before it’s finally 
compressed to create a smaller file size (in the 
case of a JPEG) and saved to the memory card. 
If you’re recording images as raw files, the 
processing data is saved as part of the file  
but not applied.
JPEG PREVIEW
The processing effects will 
be reflected in the playback 
image — or in real-time

WHITE BALANCE
Leaving this in Auto mode can 
deliver strange results under 
artificial light or in cloudy 
conditions. Instead, choose a 
preset or dial in a ‘K’ value to 
remove a colour cast — or to add 
one for creative effect.

Your camera will have a range  
of picture processing presets, 
including Landscape (above), 
Portrait and Monochrome.  
These offer different mixes of 
saturation, tone and sharpness, 
although they can be tweaked.
Automatic or manual?
WHEN SHOULD YOU GET INVOLVED WITH MAKING ADJUSTMENTS?
There are many situations where it pays to roll up 
your sleeves (or take off your gloves, at least)  
and dive into your camera’s menu to fine-tune  
the image processing options. Leaving everything 
in the automatic and ‘standard’ settings will work 
up to a point, but when lighting conditions get 
tricky or you just want to try a creative treatment, 
there’s no substitute for a bit of manual 
intervention.
Some of the default settings can be an acquired 
taste, too. For example, you might find that your 
camera has what’s known broadly as a ‘lighting 
optimiser’. Look for the ALO (Auto Lighting 
Optimizer) option on Canon cameras or D-Lighting 
on Nikon. These modes are designed to expand 
the dynamic range by revealing more detail  
in shadow areas without losing detail in the 
highlights. You may find that out of the box,  
the effect is too strong, in which case, you can  
tone it down or switch if off entirely.

Stick with sRGB if you’ll be

WHICH SETTINGS MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO RECORDING RAW FILES?

FINAL IMAGE

FINAL IMAGE 
ON HARD 
DRIVE
A raw file is often referred to as a digital negative, 
as it enables you to produce a range of different 
JPEG ‘prints’ while leaving the original image 
untouched. There are some aspects you have to get 
right in-camera when recording in raw, but in terms 
of image processing, you could leave everything set 
to automatic and just fine-tune the result later in 
software if you so wish. As highlighted earlier, 
there are some creative and technical reasons  
why you might not want to do this.
Getting it right in-camera can also save you time 
later. When you open a raw file in your camera’s 
proprietary raw software, such as Canon’s Digital 
Photo Professional or Nikon’s Capture NX-D,  
it’s initially decoded according to the image 
processing data that’s been saved as part of the 
raw file, so it will be displayed with the white 
balance, picture style and other settings dialled in 
on the camera at the time it was taken.

camera when raw files let you do it later in the 
comfort of your own home?
Well, for a start, you’ll probably want a more 
accurate preview of the image. The image you 
see displayed on the rear screen of a DSLR 
during playback and Live View, and in the 
viewfinder of a camera equipped with an 
electronic viewfinder, is actually a JPEG 
preview that’s based on the image processing 
settings made on the camera.
This is the case even if you shoot raw, 
although the file that ultimately ends up  
on the memory card still contains all that raw 
sensor information.
This JPEG preview is a useful creative tool. 
For instance, you can get a feel for how an 
image will stack up in black and white, while 
still recording the colour data in the raw file 
that can be used for a more sophisticated 
mono conversion later.
There are also technical considerations:  
the exposure histogram you see on the 
camera’s screen is based on the JPEG preview, 
and will reflect any changes you make to the 
picture style or white balance. You’re unlikely 
to get an accurate reflection of the raw file  
if you have a devil-may-care approach to 
in-camera image processing.  
At this stage, a raw file is not an image at all: 
rather a data file that contains the raw binary 
code from the camera’s image sensor. To 
convert this info into a viewable image format 
such as a JPEG, the raw data first needs to be 
decoded. This is normally done using raw 
processing software on a computer, but some 
cameras enable you to convert a raw file stored 
on the memory card too. All images start out 
as raw image data; it’s just that, in the case of  
a JPEG or a TIFF, the camera automatically 
carries out the image adjustments for you.
So why would you bother altering settings 
like white balance and sharpness in the

TAKING IMAGE PROCESSING 
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY 
PROCESSING PARAMETERS THAT 
CAN BE CHANGED AFTER THE EVENT 
WITH A RAW FILE — AND, IN SOME 
CASES, FINE-TUNED EVEN WITH  
A JPEG — THE FUNDAMENTAL 
EXPOSURE SETTINGS OF APERTURE, 
SHUTTER SPEED AND ISO, ALONG 
WITH THE FOCUS DISTANCE,  
ARE FIXED AT THE POINT  
THAT A PHOTO IS TAKEN.
In recent years, camera manufacturers 
have started to turn this idea on its 
head. Founded in 2006, California-
based Lytro released its first ‘light field’
camera in 2012. This device enabled  
an image to be refocused after it had 
been shot. While an intriguing idea  
on paper, the first camera was 
hampered by cost, very low-res images 
and quirky handling.
The Lytro Illum (right) followed  
in 2014, offering a bigger zoom and  
an articulated screen, although at 4MP, 
the processed JPEGs are still small.
GOING MAINSTREAM 
Lytro might be viewed as a novelty,  
but mainstream manufacturers are  
also experimenting with this idea.  
Take Canon, whose Dual Pixel RAW file 
format introduced on the EOS 5D Mark 
IV enables the focus to be shifted very 
slightly (we’re talking eyelashes to 
eyeball in a portrait) after the shot  
has been taken.

RIDICULOUS TECH
Unprecedented Yashica Y35 Camera
THE NEW OLD CAMERA.
www.yashica.com
Remember those old cameras you had to wind after taking each photo? While some may
get a tingle of nostalgia at the thought, few of us would want to go back to those days.
Cameras have come a long way, so why would you want to buy a camera that was worse
than the one you have, say, in your phone? Yashica thinks looking ‘faulty’ is charming, tells
the story better and captures the ‘moment’ rather than the image, unlike most digital
cameras. Questionable logic, especially in a world ruled by filters in photo-editing apps.
Apart from the unnecessary winder ‘feature’ on the Y35, the camera also comes with
cartridges of fake film which allow you to take photos in different fixed settings. When you
pop in the black-and-white ISO 400 cartridge, you are limited to taking just black-and-
whites, meaning you have to carry the different cartridges around with you. On top of that,
it apparently feels quite plasticky and cheap. What are the advantages of this camera again?
PRECISION BAKEWARE
MONITOR YOUR BAKING TEMPERATURES.
www.geappliances.com
There are a lot of ‘problems’ that arise when cooking 
— setting the temperature on your oven to what the 
recipe says isn’t exactly one of them. If you’ve got  
a recipe that’s correct, and you’re following said 
recipe, then your ginger cake shouldn’t end up 
becoming a hard black rock. However, GE Appliances 
— a company with a vast array of kitchen appliances 
and accessories available — has designed a smart 
cake tin that connects to a smartphone app to help 
you monitor your cooking. At the concept stage  
at present, the cake tin keeps an eye on the 
temperature, letting you get on with something else, 
and will apparently notify you through the app when 
the cake is done. What is the world coming to?  
Will we soon need an app-connected hair clip to 
notify us when our hair is 100% dry? Or perhaps we’ll 
need a smart peg to sit on our clotheslines to tell us 
when our clothes are dry?! [You’ve covered that one 
already. — Ed] Merlin’s beard...!
NISSIN’S OTOHIKO
THE SLURP-CANCELLING RAMEN FORK.
store.nissin.com/jp/products/product/1003843
Humans apparently find slurping noises so offensive 
that, instead of teaching those slurping barbarians 
how to eat without making those ungodly sounds —  
a smack to the bottom should do it — Nissin has 
invented a special fork to cancel out the slurps.  
Now, this Japanese company is an instant noodles 
maker, so if there’s a noodle-eating problem,  
you bet your broth they know about it. So for only 
$180, you too can have an app-connected ramen  
fork that emits a sound to mask the sound of your 
shameful sipping. However, there is an elephant  
in the room… How exactly is one supposed to  
drink their broth with a fork? Nissin, we need  
a spoon version, pronto!

There are a lot of weird things on the above site, so if you were going to type in that url,
please don’t do it at work. Just as a heads up, the Vibrating Panties are probably the safest
thing to look at on this site. Marketed as the “greatest ever gift for your girlfriend”, you may
think this is just a kinky toy for the bedroom. However, the creators claim this is perfect
for those long and boring commutes, those long and boring shifts at work, and those long
and boring nights looking after “your poor little monkey with the flu”. It comes with
a washable cover and a remote so partners can control the action from 5–10m away,
and we really don’t want to continue talking about it... We’re blushing here.
