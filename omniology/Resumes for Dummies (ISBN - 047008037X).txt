careers columnist crack the Dummies code — and again and again, ten books

Author’s Acknowledgments
Any book is a collaborative effort and I owe applause to a variety of people
who guided me through a challenging process. Please clap your hands
together and give enormous recognition to these individuals:
Kathryn Kraemer Troutman, whose firm, The Resume Place, Inc. (www.
resume-place.com), created the 48 sample resumes in this book. Troutman
and her team, led by Sarah Blazucki, produced groundbreaking illustrations
that topped my high expectations.
James M. Lemke, the world’s greatest technical reviewer whose cutting-edge
knowledge is indispensable to my work. Jim’s globe-trotting job keeps him
awake and online in airports around the world.
John S. Gill, a college student and my technical associate who knows every-
thing I don’t about conducting computer analysis, and who gets my vote for
Most Likely to Succeed at whatever he goes after.
Traci Cumbay, this book’s talented, conscientious and insightful project
editor pulled excellent rabbits out of sometimes so-so hats. A strong editor’s
focused oversight on an ambitious work makes all the difference.
Kelly James, a high school student and my editorial associate whose eagle-
eyes never met a typo she invited to stick around, and who provided helpful
online research assistance.
Gail Ross, my literary agent-attorney and friend who continues to help me
find new chapters to write about.
Robert N. Weinreb, M.D. and J. Rigby Slight, M.D., eminent vision authori-
ties who kept my eyes alive all the way to the finish line.
And cartloads of thanks to the following very special experts for a wide range
of editorial contributions:
Richard H. Beatty
Paul Hawkinson
Tony Beshara
Ron Krannich, Ph.D.
Joel Cheesman
Kay Luo
Gerry Crispin
Mark Mehler
Jason Goldberg
John Sumser

Introduction
W
hen the editors and I first talked about updating this book from the
4th edition, which was published four years ago, we were thinking,
well, “revision.”
The result, after six intense months of research and writing, is quite different.
Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition, is about 85 percent new content, and all
the sample resumes in Chapters 11 to 14 are new.
Necessity was the engine driving the radical makeover. From reinvented
recruiting technology, to unmanageable millions of resumes choking employer
databases, to government mandates in the name of diversity fairness, a sea
change has occurred in the recruiting space over the past several years.
All this change demands a fresh look at how you write and market your
resumes. A minor revision just wouldn’t cut it; you deserve to know the ropes
and rules for a New Era in recruiting and job finding.
About This Book
Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition, is a playbook showing you how to tap the
power of amazing new technology to write and use your resumes in search of
a good job.
Technology came to resumes in the early part of a time period — roughly
1994 to 2005 — now called Web 1.0. In 1995, when writing the debut edition of
this work, I explained that resumes were being scanned and read by job com-
puters, and — imagine this — transmitted over the Internet! The fasten-your-
seatbelt bumps and wonders happening in Web 1.0 were nothing less than a
revolution in the traditional employment process.
Fast forward to right now. Refasten your seat belts and expect surprise after
surprise as Web 2.0 replaces Web 1.0. What we’re dealing with today is a kind
of revolution of a revolution.

The second Web phase is again bulldozing the traditional job market with an
array of ambitious ideas and software aimed at solving recruiting-industry
problems and meeting the needs of employers. But a number of develop-
ments lighten the load for job seekers, adding high-octane fuel for successful
searches. What’s the big difference between the first and second Web
phases?
Web 1.0 is characterized by static, rigid formats and job boards. Web 2.0
moves toward richer, more interactive resources (see Chapter 3).
The advancing technology of Web 2.0 is why Resumes For Dummies, 
5th Edition, pinpoints the best ways to distribute your resume, as well as
create it.
There’s one more notable difference between the beginning days of Web 1.0
and Web 2.0: In Web 1.0, everyone wanted to know how to get on the Web; in
Web 2.0, everyone wants to know how to get noticed on the Web.
In these pages I tell you how to get noticed by creating an OnTarget resume
(see Chapter 1) and distributing it wisely.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book, I’ve established the following conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses. 
 Sidebars, which are shaded boxes of text, consist of information that’s
interesting but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the
topic.
Further, in the sample resumes throughout the book, I substitute a reminder
to add the relevant dates in your resume with the word “dates” enclosed in
editorial brackets — [dates] — instead of actual years to keep your attention
focused on key resume concepts. 
Watch out also for the numbering system I use in the sample resumes in
Chapter 1 and Chapters 11 to 14. I put cross-matching numbers there to guide
you through important aspects of each resume, but you don’t want to stick
numbers in yours.

Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Foolish Assumptions
I assume you picked up this book for one of the following reasons:
 You’ve never written a resume and want an experienced, friendly hand
on your shoulder.
 You have written a resume — it got you where you are today — and you
want to do better next time.
 You like where you are today but want more from life than blooming
where you’re planted. To move to the next level, your experience tells
you that it’s time for a resume makeover.
 You need a new resume for that great job you heard about but worry that
too many competitors will submit virtually the same cookie-cutter docu-
ment pirated from somewhere. To stop looking like a human photocopy
machine, you want to understand resume writing from the ground up.
 You’ve heard about sweeping technology-based changes in the way
people and jobs find each other. A realist, you know that technology
can’t be uninvented. You want to be sure your resume is in sync with the
very latest updates.
I further assume that you are someone who likes information that cuts to the
chase, sometimes with a smile.
How This Book Is Organized
Getting through the job interview door depends on much more than just being
a great candidate. This book takes you through everything you need to know
about creating your best resumes, getting them into the right hands, and land-
ing interviews. Here’s where you can find all the legs of the adventure.
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes 
in a New Era Job Market
This part covers the Web 2.0 changes that are streaming into recruiting
offices. You can also review here the technology of the 1990s still in use. 
Plus, here’s where you discover how to move your OnTarget resumes to the
right eyes.

Introduction

Part II: Resume Basics That 
Wow ’Em Every Time
Format, content, words, design, savvy handling of special considerations and
problems — all these factors impact the quality of your resume. Find out how
best to highlight your good points and downplay the not-so-good ones here.
And how to do it all with grace, clarity, and readable style.
Part III: Bringing It All Together: 
Sample OnTarget Resumes
What does an OnTarget resume look like? Turn to this part to find out. Here
you get to take a long look at resumes that make use of the strategies I
describe in this book. I show you resumes from new grads and baby boomers,
from nurses and business analysts, and from people who’ve moved straight
up in a career and those who’ve had a few stumbles. I also show you some
startling resume makeovers.
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. 
What to Do Now
Because of intense competition for better jobs (which especially affects mid-
career and baby-boomer candidates), the follow-up tips of earlier times may
be too tentative to be effective. This part includes creative new moves that
keep you from waiting all alone by your cell phone for calls that never come.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In these short chapters, I give you quick bits of information on yet more
resume topics. I offer guidance on proving your resume claims, avoiding
unnecessary mistakes, choosing professional resume help, recognizing the
big peeves of recruiters, and, finally, using a resume checklist that won’t take
half a day to complete.

Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies signature icons are the little round pictures you see in the mar-
gins of the book. I use them to laser-guide your attention to key bits of infor-
mation. Here’s a list of the icons you find in this book and what they mean.
This icon directs your attention to techniques that cause readers to lavish
praise and respect on your resume and then move it to the “you betcha” file.
No move achieves the resume–interview connection every single time. This
icon reminds you to think through an issue and try to make the best choice
for your situation.
Some points in these pages are so useful that I hope you’ll keep them in mind
as you read. I make a big deal out of these ideas with this icon.
Advice and information that can spark a difference in the outcome of your
resume-led job search are flagged with this icon.
Watch out for deep waters filled with things that bite. This icon signals there
could be trouble ahead if you don’t make a good decision.
Where to Go from Here
Most For Dummies books are set up so that you can flip to the section of the
book that meets your present needs. You can do that in this book, too. I tell
you where to find the information you might need when I refer to a concept,
and I define terms as they arise to enable you to feel at home no matter
where you open the book.
But this book breaks new ground in resume creation and distribution. To get
ahead and stay ahead, start by reading Chapters 1 through 4. They provide
the foundation you need to come through a Web 2.0 job search with the inter-
view invitations that lead to employment offers.
P.S. The good news is that you need not be a techie to make sense out of Web
2.0 innovations and to bend them to your will as a job seeker. Using a new e-
tool is like owning a stylish automobile: You don’t have to know how to repair
its engine to get ooohs and ahhhs as you drive it smartly down the street.

 Fighting back when technology isn’t your friend and your resumes go missing 
H
ey there! Is your job search stalling out after you submit a resume but
before you are offered an interview?
If your answer is yes, this book can open significant new insights for you with
a quick update on how to thrive in a landscape where recruiting processes
have turned digital but resume practices are stuck in analog.
In a New Era, the Targeted 
Resume Rules
Job seekers, brace yourselves. Trolling the job market is getting trickier and
requires more effort than the last time you baited your resume hook. Even if
you were job hunting fairly recently, resumes and related techniques that
were revolutionary in the savvy job seeker’s toolkit a mere dozen years ago
are headed for history. The all-purpose resume is at the top of the list of job
search tools gliding to irrelevance or extinction.
You probably have an all-purpose resume lying around in a desk drawer
somewhere. What you and legions of job seekers everywhere like about the
all-purpose resume is that it casts a wide net to snag the attention of many
employers — and it saves time for those of us who are too busy getting
through the day to keep writing different resumes for different jobs. I appreci-
ate that. But, sorry to say, your one-size-fits-all work of art is obsolete, and
it’s going to get lost in more and more recruiting black holes.

The all-purpose, or generic, resume is being replaced by the targeted resume
(which I refer to in this book as OnTarget), a resume that is tailor-made for a
specific employment goal.
An OnTarget resume is a marketing tool that convinces the reader your work
will benefit a specific employer and that you should make the cut of candi-
dates invited in for a closer look. An OnTarget resume
 Addresses a given opportunity, making it easy to see how your qualifica-
tions are a close match to a job’s requirements.
 Uses powerful words to persuade and clean design to attract interest.
 Plays up strengths and downplays any factor that undermines your bid
for an interview.
In previous editions of this book, I said that when you want to be picked out
of a crowd and invited to a job interview, nothing beats a perfect or near-
perfect match between a job order and your resume. What was solid advice
in earlier years has become critical advice in this New Era. I repeat: Targeting
your resume for each job is becoming necessary, not just smart.
Hurried along and killed off by technology advances, the demise of the generic
resume is driven by two factors: the pull of market forces and the push of gov-
ernment mandate. I explain both factors in the next two segments.
Market Forces Zap Unqualified Resumes 
The word got out, slowly at first. And then — whoosh! — millions of job seekers
found out how easy it is to instantly put a resume in the hands of employers
across the country as well as across town.
Post and pray became the job seekers’ mantra as they learned how to manipu-
late online resumes and click them into the digital world as quickly as fast-
shuffling dealers lay down cards at casino poker tables. 
10
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 
Of friends and resumes
“The number one way to use your OnTarget
resume is to find a friend to walk it into the hiring
manager’s or recruiter’s office with the friend’s
stamp of approval,” advises Mark Mehler,
cofounder and principal of CareerXroads and a
long-time Internet job-hunting expert. He says
his firm’s annual survey of how people get hired
at major corporations shows that one out of
three openings is filled this way.

The resume rush began back in the first phase of the World Wide Web, which
retroactively is termed Web 1.0, a time frame of about 1994 to 2005.
But the Net’s resume sludge got yuckier and more frustrating as commercial
resume-blasting services appeared on the scene. Almost overnight, it
seemed, anyone willing to pay the price could splatter resume confetti every-
where an online address could be found.
The consequences of resume spamming for employers were staggering:
Despite their use of the Web 1.0 era’s best recruiting selection software,
employers were overrun with unsolicited, disorganized generic resumes con-
taining everything but the kitchen sink.
And what about the job seekers who sent all those all-purpose, unstructured
resumes? They were left to wonder in disappointment why they never got a
callback.
It’s all in the numbers. A job advertised by a major company in the era before
Web 1.0 might have attracted hundreds or even thousands of responses, but
the same ad posted online creates a feeding frenzy of many thousands of
resumes. A few super-sized companies report that they receive millions of
11
Chapter 1: The All-Purpose Resume Is So Five Minutes Ago
Are resumes outdated?
Every few years for as long as I can remember,
an employment “thought leader” announces
that resumes are old hat and unnecessary,
advising that you, as a job seeker, forgo
resumes and talk your way into an interview.
The problem with this advice is that it’s 
impractical — it doesn’t work for most people.
Very few of us are extroverted and glib enough
to carry the entire weight of an employ-
ment marketing presentation without support-
ing materials before or during face-to-face
meetings.
Now a new resume attack has surfaced. This
time it turns on technology. Industry consultants
observe that companies are weary of sifting
through too many resumes and instead will 
substitute structured e-profiles, screening
questions via the Web, and assessment instru-
ments (tests) in deciding who gets offered a job
interview. 
As my crystal ball is in the repair shop, I don’t
know whether, when, or how widely technology
will erase resumes. But this is what I believe:
At some point in a hunt for better employment,
everyone needs market-driven job search com-
munications. That is, everyone needs a resume
or something very much like a resume that tells
the buyer (employer) such critical facts as
these:
 Why you are an excellent match for the job
 What skills you bring to the organization
 Why you are worth the money you hope to
earn
 Your capacity for doing the work better than
other candidates
 Your ability to solve company or industry
problems

unsolicited resumes each year. No wonder the Web is falling-down-drunk with
billions of resumes that overwhelm both technology and eyeballs. No wonder
employment databases are hammered with such mismatches as sales clerks
and sports trainers applying for jobs as scientists and senior managers, and
vice versa.
Fast-forward to 2005 when digital curtains went up on a second Internet
phase. It’s called Web 2.0, a term suggesting a host of new ideas and amazing
software that has leapt onto the world recruiting stage. Web 2.0 is fueled by
the desire of companies to eliminate resume fatigue and, at the same time, to
ace out the competition in acquiring top talent. And, of course, employers
universally want to do it better-faster-cheaper.
Briefly, the Web-based services of Web 2.0 are characterized by their move-
ment away from static, rigid Web sites merely listing jobs and links to apply
for them and toward richer, more interactive and socially inclusive methods.
(To read more about Web 2.0 services, check out Chapters 2 and 3.)
As employers hope to use Web 2.0 solutions to dry out the resume deluge
created by Web 1.0 innovation, job seekers have updated aspirations as well. 
In Web 1.0, job seekers wanted to know how to get on the Internet. In Web 2.0,
job seekers want to know how to get noticed on the Internet.
Market forces, the term describing the interaction of supply and demand that
shapes a market economy, are pulling companies toward targeted resumes by
rewarding them with less unnecessary work to wade through. And market
forces are pulling job seekers toward targeted resumes by showing them how
to get noticed on the Internet.
Game-Changing Government Rules 
Impact Resumes
As market forces pull toward targeted resumes, the federal government pushes.
The government didn’t set out to establish resume targeting as a newly
essential job-market skill. But that’s what happened as a result of the govern-
ment’s official guidelines mandated in 2006 by the Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the agency established to track the diversity
hiring record of those applying for positions with federal contractors.
The rationale for the government’s interest in employment practices is that
federal tax dollars should not support discrimination in the workplace. The
agency’s new guidelines are intended to encourage hiring fairness toward
those who work for federal contractors. Accurate record keeping is required
for gender, race, and ethnicity. (Strangely, age isn’t included in the OFCCP
12
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

protected classes.) While the diversity issue was already in place before
2006, it effectively was on the back burner and probably would have stayed
there except that the Internet came along and made it so easy for everyone to
apply for every job under the sun.
How likely are you to be covered by the new OFCCP rules? Perhaps more
likely than you think. It’s surprising how many businesses are subject to “fed-
eral contractors or subcontractors” mandates. Estimates range from a con-
servative 20,000 companies in the United States to nearly 200,000 facilities
and companies worldwide, of which half are reported to be construction
firms. One in five American workers is thought to be employed by federal
contractors. (Official government figures aren’t available at this writing but
may be in the future following the establishment of a federal contractor data-
base required by 2006 legislation.)
Even if you postal mail, fax, or hand deliver your resume to someone at a
friend’s backyard barbeque and never, ever send it online, you still may be
classified as an Internet applicant if the contractor accepts some applications
for a specific position via the Internet; all applicants for that position must
now be considered Internet applicants, according to the rules.
The OFCCP action to deal with Internet record keeping started with a ques-
tion: Who is an “Internet applicant” and who is a looky-lou? 
Why does anyone care? Think about it this way: If 50,000 individuals send a
contractor unsolicited and unqualified resumes, should those people, for
diversity counts, be considered applicants? The OFCCP says no. The agency
believes that their inclusion would muddy the database used for official
audits and lawsuits based on bias claims. 
Using a transportation metaphor, the OFCCP guidelines identify people who
should be counted as Internet applicants because they have a specific desti-
nation in mind and drive straight for that destination. By contrast, people
who should not be counted aimlessly cruise traffic-jammed streets hoping to
get lucky and find an acceptable destination. Policy makers insist that the
government must know who is and who isn’t an Internet applicant to mea-
sure hiring fairness when dealing with the otherwise unmanageable hoards of
online resumes.
Gain competitive advantage as you distribute your resumes by bearing in
mind the official criteria for your being validated as an Internet applicant:
 You express your interest for a particular position.
 The employer considers you for employment in a particular position.
 You have the basic qualifications for the particular position.
 Prior to receiving a job offer for the particular position, you don’t drop
out of consideration for the job — by taking other employment, for
example, or saying you’re no longer interested in the particular position.
13
Chapter 1: The All-Purpose Resume Is So Five Minutes Ago

Navigating the regulations
Because the OFCCP rules are new to most of us, the following recommenda-
tions for resume success with federal contractors are crucial. Most of the tips
come from CareerXroads (www.careerxroads.com) co-founder and princi-
pal Gerry Crispin, who is way out in front on Internet applicant expertise.
Crispin advises that you
 Follow the company’s instructions. Do exactly as the company instructs
you on how to apply. One way to make it easy for employers to consider
you for a specific job is to clone a portion of the job description to your
resume for each job you target.
 Clearly spell out your matching qualifications. Make a list of basic
requirements and check item by item to be sure you have included your
qualification for each one. If you’re missing a requirement-qualification
match, your resume will gather dust unless no one else qualifies and the
company is desperate. ( I talk more about matching qualifications to
requirements in the section “Three Steps to Writing a Targeted Resume,”
and illustrate targeting throughout sample resumes in Chapters 11 to 14.)
 Send multiple resumes to the same company. Monitor your preferred
company’s Web sites and submit a new targeted resume for each posi-
tion that interests you.
 Keep your resume current. Do you remember the classic tip to stay at
the top of a list of candidates by changing a word or two in your resume
14
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 
To clone or not to clone: Mirroring ad language
Must you use the exact words in the job ad?
Two schools of thought exist on this question.
Some authorities advise that you should state
your qualifications in the identical language
used in the ad to which you respond. The ditto
contingent points out that computer selection
software awards rating points to a resume
based on how closely your words mirror those
in the job ad: Get closer to the ad, get more
points.
Others disagree, saying that modern recruiting
software is sophisticated enough to grasp your
qualifications even though you use synonyms
and related terms and not the exact same
words.
Career advisers won’t have a definitive answer
on the same words-or-synonym question until
enough time has passed to give us more expe-
rience with the new OFCCP mandate.
I agree with the latter view — that synonyms
and related terms are acceptable — and largely
have taken that approach in this book. But if
you’re worried that a company is using older,
limited software, go with the ditto school. The
important thing is to play matchmaker with each
resume you submit.

and reposting to job boards frequently? Well, that tip is alive and well.
“OFCCP rules allow companies to pick a random pool of applicants by
searching the job boards for ‘most recent’ qualified applicants,” Crispin
observes. “In those cases, no one will even look at a resume that is more
than two or three weeks old.”
Sign of the times
Although there are enough federal contractor jobs to justify your paying
attention to the OFCCP guidelines, the new rules appear to be spreading into
job search quarters across America, starting at the largest companies, says
Gerry Crispin, whose CareerXroads consulting firm arranges scholarly con-
ferences where staffing professionals at major corporations share their best
practices.
Additionally, the buzz among recruiting-industry insiders is that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission will soon extend similar, if not identi-
cal, guidelines to all U.S. companies with more than 50 employees. Whether
the EEOC drops the other diversity-protection shoe in the near future or not,
Crispin believes the targeted resume is gaining mainstream status in the
United States.
“More and more companies are accepting the OFCCP definition of Internet
applicants — individuals who continue to express interest, who are being
considered for a specific position, and who meet the position’s basic qualifi-
cations,” Crispin says. “The move toward targeted resumes ensures that job
seekers who willy-nilly apply for every job that is even close will be wasting
their time.”
Three Steps to Writing 
a Targeted Resume
When you begin to think seriously about greener grass, the race is on! You
already need 36-hour days to accomplish all the responsibilities you carry on
your shoulders. And then you see a job that you hope has your name on it
but can’t carve out the time to write from scratch a targeted resume that will
show an employer why you’re the one to interview.
Your answer is to begin building a core resume before the pressure hits,
using it as a base to spin off targeted editions when you must move quickly.
Constructing a targeted resume is easier when you follow this game plan.
15
Chapter 1: The All-Purpose Resume Is So Five Minutes Ago

Step 1: Prepare your core resume
Probe your memory to jot down every factor in your background that you
could use to customize a resume, from experience, competencies, and skills
to education. This is your working model, a resume you will never submit to
an employer but a rich well you will draw from time and time again. Use as
many pages as you need. (To get pointers on content, go to Chapter 6.)
Step 2: Research requirements of job
If you’re responding to a specific advertised job, jot down the requirements
that the ad lists. Don’t confuse the job duties and the stated requirements.
Deal first with the requirements and then see how you can show experience
or education that matches the most important job duties.
When you’re not responding to a specific advertised job but are posting your
resume in an online database, attempt to attract interest in your candidacy
by researching the most commonly requested qualifications for a given occu-
pation or career field. You can do this by studying many job ads.
Step 3: Customize each spinoff resume
After compiling the requirements you must satisfy in a tailor-made resume,
scour your core resume to see whether you can add secondary items men-
tioned in the ad that further improve your chances and start writing.
Resume professional Kathryn Troutman suggests a way to cut down on your
time and effort customizing each resume. Constructing a two-page resume,
customize the first page and, whenever possible, keep the second page the
same each time. Freezing the second page isn’t always possible, Troutman
says, but the concept is a good starting point.
Sample Core Resume and Spinoffs
Look over the following examples for Lauren L. Simpson created by Resume-
Place.com CEO Kathryn Troutman. (For privacy reasons, names and other
identifying data have been changed.) You’ll see how attention to details can
make all the difference in getting your resume noticed, first by computers
and then by humans.

The back story on Lauren L. Simpson
Lauren grew up on the Mid-Atlantic seaboard (Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and
Northern Virginia). After graduating from high school, Lauren worked for a year
as an administrative assistant at a health insurance company in Northern
Virginia. Deciding she didn’t want to continue in administrative work, Lauren
landed a job as a sales associate at a nationwide women’s wear chain.
Lauren was good at retailing, and after six months the clothing chain offered
her a managerial traineeship at one of the chain’s stores in Texas. Once there,
Lauren enrolled in the retailing program of a well-regarded school of business
at the state university. While working and studying, Lauren was promoted to
assistant manager.
After graduation from college, another retailer recruited Lauren, who spent
several years at the new company. Although successful there, Lauren had a
change of mind and began to feel that she’d gotten off on the wrong foot.
Retailing isn’t really what she wants to do for the rest of her life and she’s
looking around for another way to learn a livelihood.
Although going back to school and retooling for another career field is an
option Lauren is considering, she isn’t anxious to incur student debt. Before
doing that, she’s checking out how she can adapt her hard-earned education
to related but different types of work.
Lauren’s core resume 
Using a reverse chronological time frame (see Chapter 5), Lauren writes a

Chapter 1: The All-Purpose Resume Is So Five Minutes Ago

To illustrate the concept of targeting, I have added numbers and cross-
matched them between the cosmetic company’s requirements and Lauren’s
qualifications. The numbers on this sample resume are for illustration pur-
poses only. Do not put numbers on your own actual resumes.
Here’s how Lauren addresses each of the cosmetics company’s requirements:
 Requirement 1 shows up in the skills summary and under management
duties at LouAnn’s.
 Requirement 2 is addressed by her merchandising coordinator duty at
Brilliant Buyers Inc.
 Requirement 3 appears as a management skill at LouAnn’s.
 Requirement 4 is met under the education segment. Note that Lauren
spells out her retail merchandising studies because the salon job
requires a familiarity with what retail customers will buy.
 Requirement 5 is noted in two places. The first is a subhead titled
“Customer Relationship Management” at LouAnn’s. The second is also at
LouAnn’s, within the accomplishments segment.
Lauren purposely did not include certain information, such as her job right
after high school as an administrative assistant at a health insurance com-
pany because it isn’t relevant to the position she seeks.
Lauren’s spinoff resume B
Lauren took note of an online job posting for a marketing position advertised by
a health insurance company. She printed out the job posting, which included
the basic qualifications, and echoed the posting in her objective, almost word
for word. (The basic qualifications are described in a mission statement in the
box atop spinoff resume B; see Figure 1-3.) Lauren takes care to address each of
the health insurance company’s requirements in her targeted resume.
To illustrate the concept of targeting, I have added numbers and cross-
matched them between the health insurance company’s requirements and
Lauren’s qualifications. The numbers on this sample resume are for illustra-
tion purposes only. Don’t put numbers on your own actual resumes.
Here’s how Lauren address the requirements from the ad placed by the
health insurance company:
 Lauren meets requirement 1 in the education segment. Because the
health insurance marketing job is not on the retail level, Lauren selects a
few different facts from her core resume than those she chose for Spinoff
Resume A. Lauren truthfully writes that she has a business degree and
doesn’t mention retail merchandising, a study that is within the school
of business she attended.

If during an interview Lauren is asked about her studies in retail merchan-
dising, Lauren will finesse the issue, briefly pointing out the plus factors in
learning retail merchandising, and then moving onto her marketing and
business coursework and her experience-based accomplishments.
 Lauren responds to requirement 2 with her marketing experience at
Brilliant Buyers.
 Requirement 3, knowledge of the health care industry, was more difficult
to match than the other requirements but Lauren puts on her game face
and reaches back to the health insurance company she worked for right
after high school.
 Lauren addresses requirement 4 in her opening summary of qualifica-
tions. A reading of her resume backs up her claims regarding leadership
in a collaborative environment.
In a New Era, the OnTarget Resume
Brings You So Up to Date
The pace of globalization today is faster and more sweeping than at any time
in world history, says Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
In a recent speech before Federal Reserve leaders, the central banking chief
went on to explain that few lands are left out of the globalization of the
planet: “The emergence of China, India, and the former communist-bloc coun-
tries implies that the greater part of the Earth’s population is now engaged, at
least potentially, in the global economy.”
Few argue Bernanke’s conclusion — even if they don’t like it. But another
aspect of globalization not often mentioned is that in economic terms, capital
(money) is chasing cheap labor all over the globe: Jobs are shipped to low-
wage countries and educated and skilled workers migrate to developed
nations with good jobs on offer.
The pursuit of cheap labor creates growing worldwide competition and
directly impacts your resume — now and in the years ahead.
Never forget the resume–job interview connection. To nab one of the better
jobs and to move up the rewards chain, your targeted resume has to attract a
decision maker who will invite you to an interview to further explain how you
will give that employer precisely what his or her organization says it wants
and needs to succeed.

When technology fails: The human antidote
The job market is made up of A-list candidates
and B-list candidates (and many candidates
who are perceived to be further down the
alphabetic scale).
If you’re a seasoned worker, have you ever
noticed that A-list candidates are typically
younger than you and have recently done the
very job the employer is trying to fill?
On the other hand, when you’re a rookie, does it
seem as though those on the A-list are typically
older than you and have recently done the very
job the employer is trying to fill? 
The definition of frustration is when you are
treated like an ant at a picnic because you’re
not perceived as an A- or B-list candidate.
Unfortunately, your exclusion rate from inter-
view offers may be high when the employer
uses online recruiting tools.
An answer to your dilemma: When technology
kicks you to the curb, consider back-to-the-
future strategies that are most advantageous to
you. Play on your turf. Get personal:
 Develop your own job leads by doing sub-
stantial research and targeting your resume
for a direct application.
 Network to a referral-chain, asking each of
20 or more people whom you call daily:
“Who else should I be talking to?”
 Follow up on job ads, but to diffuse the
crushing competition attempt to figure out
who the hiring manager is and contact that
decision maker directly (see Chapter 2). You
can even write a resume letter (see Chap-
ter 5) to that person, but do not mention the
job ad. Your approach is that you’ve been
researching companies where your excel-
lent qualifications might be a good fit. Even
if this “happy coincidence” causes the
hiring manager to send your resume to 
the HR department, now it arrives from 
an important executive and will likely be
examined.
 Remember that the vast majority of jobs are
found in small businesses. Many aren’t yet
using modern job-search tools and will
value your person-to-person approach.

To accomplish this custom-fit hiring, make your self-marketing document an
OnTarget resume that convinces a single employer that your value proposi-
tion (a buzzword meaning reason for hire) is a perfect fit for the job, not a
maybe fit for the job.
That is, meet as many of the employer’s requirements as you truthfully can.
Admittedly, doing so isn’t a walk on the beach. Expect to do some head
scratching and creative thinking from time to time in a world growing not
only more global but more complex as the clock ticks.

New Quick Ways to Find 
the Right Jobs
In This Chapter
 Using new gorilla job search engines
 Revisiting vigorous job boards 
 Reviewing media job ads 
 Going directly to company Web sites
T
his book shows you how to master the New Era art of peppering each
resume with persuasive marketing facts that target a job’s requirements.
Chapter 1 explains why the matchup between job requirements and your
qualifications has become critical and occupies much of this work. But your
efforts will go down the drain if you can’t put your marketing facts before
people who can hire you.
The Internet makes it easier than ever to uncover hoards of job opportuni-
ties; the trick is to find the right ones for you. In this chapter, I discuss the
online tools you can use to reach the right eyes without stumbling around
and wasting time. First, examine the really new tools and then take an
updated look at familiar resources.
One important note: The history of the past decade proves that recruiting
technology can turn on a dime. That’s why I cover this chapter’s online job-
hunt destinations as a digest, using relatively few examples to illustrate the
concepts you want to know.

The Young Giants: Vertical 
Job Search Engines
Vertical search engines — also called verticals or VJSEs or aggregators — are
the job seeker’s new best friends, and they’re changing the online recruit-
ment game in dramatic ways. You can think of VJSEs as “Google for jobs.”
That is, the verticals work like Google or other search engines, except they
search only for job listings.
Verticals represent the next level in job search and they have arrived in the
nick of time for harried job seekers who can use the services without cost.
In days of yore (before early 2005), you could grow old and gray wasting
weeks trudging through job listing after job listing on various job boards. 
One informed guesstimate says there are 50,000 job boards around the world!
By contrast to this crowded cybermart where you board-hop from one site 
to another and on and on, the cutting-edge job verticals offer one-stop job
shopping.
Modern day hunter-gatherers, the verticals do the collection work for you,
making it possible to go to one place and see virtually all the jobs that fit
your personal criteria on the Internet. They give you the options to slice and
dice your search results, based on what you want, such as full or part time,
large companies or small, and so forth. And they reveal when each job was
posted. Some verticals even show you where the jobs are clustered on a map.
How do the verticals do it? Specialized search engines scrape (crawl) the
Web to find and haul in job content. That is, they use automated programs
(software) called spiders or robots. The ’bots go sleuthing on the Web, compil-
ing a vast array of listings from newspaper classified ads, job boards, corpo-
rate sites, and industry associations.
The verticals also receive online feeds (direct communications) from job
boards that want their listings included in a VJSE’s inventory of jobs. 
Based on the keywords you supply, you can bring all relevant listings to your
computer in one search by using a vertical job search site.
The vertical sites usually don’t engage in job transactions themselves but
pass users along to the source of the information. The verticals can point you
to specialty job boards you’ve never heard of but that are opportunity rich
for your occupation or industry.
30
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

While it’s true that some of the material that vertical engines come up with
also appears on large search engines (such as Google, Yahoo, MSN, or
Ask.com), the general-purpose engines lack the vertical engines’ relevancy
(the degree to which a job matches what you specified, or the ability to filter
(sort out unwanted search results).
By contrast, job seekers using VJSEs can filter search results using a wealth
of criteria. You may, for example, want to look at jobs at companies with
annual revenues of more than $100 million, or within 25 miles of a ZIP code,
or only those jobs based on another criterion that you choose.
The biggest potential fly in the VJSE soup is what could happen when the
new vertical giants do not have contractual agreements with the original pub-
lishers of job ads. Some verticals are attempting to index and post for free all
the job openings in the universe, including those that employers paid to
place on job boards, in print, and through other media. Whether potential
legal squabbles eventually cut into your one-stop convenience by shrinking
the number of job postings you can shop on a VJSE is unknown. But for now
and the foreseeable future, vertical job search sites are the hot new blood-
hounds to help you sniff out the jobs you want.
31
Chapter 2: New Quick Ways to Find the Right Jobs
Four signs of hot verticals
Even though VJSEs are gifts from the technol-
ogy gods who know how busy you are, they’re
not all created the same. Whether you experi-
ment with one vertical at a time, or arrange for
relevant job listings to your computer from sev-
eral verticals simultaneously and watch them
compete for jobs that match your criteria, bear
in mind the four basic requirements for a great
experience. They are:
 A search-and-match technology that works
correctly
 Wide coverage of available jobs with dates
of postings
 Easy-to-use delivery options (e-mail or RSS
feeds; see Chapter 3)
 Tools for saving and managing saved
searches
I don’t comment on how verticals score on each
criterion because, like auto model redesigns,
each year brings changes for the young verti-
cals. Judge for yourself. You may be able to get
expert comments from the Job Search Engine
Guide (www.rmwilsonconsulting.type
pad.com), as well as Joel Cheesman’s blog
(www.cheezhead.com).

Using a vertical: The generic basics
While each vertical search engine includes specific instructions on the best
way to use it, you can expect certain basic information to apply across the
board. Here are the general steps you’re likely to follow when using a vertical
search engine:
1. Create a personal account.
Register with one or several verticals. Many job listings will appear on
all the verticals because, with exceptions, they pull their inventory from
the same places.
2. Decide how to receive the jobs.
You may prefer daily or weekly job alerts. Or you may choose an RSS
(real simple syndication) feed (Chapter 3) to have job ads sent as they
are posted directly to your computer or handheld device. 
3. Set preferences.
Use the preferences setting to select the jobs you want to show on your
results page. You may select to show results based only on location (ZIP
codes) or timeliness, for example.
4. Become familiar with related options on the vertical site.
Options vary by vertical but may include such extras as a map of the
job’s location, salary market information, company research, or poten-
tial contacts inside the target company.
5. Narrow your search. Drill down through the job listings to be as specific
as possible to get to the jobs you want. 
Quality — not quantity — counts most. Look for freshness of the listing
and those jobs that are relevant to your preferences. Search on skills,
interests, and location.
6. Track and save your searches.
Each vertical allows you to save your searches on its site. Doing so
enables you to manage the most current and desirable listings.
7. Upgrade to advanced search, if you need it.
If you’re drowning in job listings or seem to be missing the mark, try
using the vertical’s advanced search feature. You can search by such cri-
teria as keywords, words in job title, company, type of job, and location.
Alison Doyle’s book, The About.com Guide to Job Searching: Tools and Tactics
to Help You Get the Job You Want (Adams Media, 2006) provides more infor-
mation on using vertical job search engines to scout job leads.

Meet the verticals
Here’s a thumbnail sketch of each of the best-known verticals, those that
offer the most amenities and draw from thousands of sources. Expect the
details of any or all of these sites to change from time to time.
SimplyHired.com
Simply Hired is an award-winning site that says it’s building the largest online
database of jobs on the planet and recently announced more than five million
job listings indexed from large and small job boards, newspaper and classi-
fied listings, government and association Web sites, and company Web sites.
The site’s personable founders are dog lovers who enjoy a good joke: The site
once ran a contest for the best true I-was-fired tale on its sister site, Simply
Fired (www.simplyfired.com). Dog owners can search for jobs at dog-
friendly companies all over the country and find a job that welcomes best
four-pawed friends in the office. But if that doesn’t make you barking happy,
the company offers a host of other filters including family- and minority-
friendly employers.
What about the power of who-you-know? Simply Hired’s business network
partner LinkedIn offers a referral job network that aims to connect job appli-
cants with hiring managers. Simply Hired’s “Who Do I Know” button displays
after each job listing to help you discover whether you have an “inside friend”
whom you can tap for referrals or information. The service has a similar part-
nership with the social networking site, MySpace (careers.myspace.com).
The result is a splashy pairing of business or social networking with vertical
search.
On Simply Hired, you can save and simultaneously post a resume on a
number of carefully chosen job sites. Additionally, you can use any computer
to visit your account. 
Indeed.com
In one simple search, Indeed gives job seekers free access to millions of jobs
from thousands of Web sites. All the job listings from major job boards, news-
paper classifieds, associations, and company career pages are included .
The company says that more than one million new jobs are added weekly. 
To keep your opportunities fresh, Indeed automatically removes all jobs after
30 days.
33
Chapter 2: New Quick Ways to Find the Right Jobs

With the familiar look and feel of general search engines, the popular Indeed
makes it easy to drill down by keyword and location to jobs that fit your
requirements. You can quick-search from the Indeed home page. Just type
keywords into the “What” box describing the kind of job you want, and enter
a city, state or ZIP code in the “Where” box. Then click the “Find Jobs” button
or hit the Enter key on your keyboard. 
You can put search results on your plate in several different ways. For exam-
ple, you can
 View results ranked by relevance (how close the job comes to what 
you want).
 View results ranked by date, with newest jobs appearing first.
 View results by distance of your potential commute to work.
Indeed’s “Advanced Job Search” allows for more sophisticated filtering: You
can specify exact phrases, exclude jobs that contain certain keywords,
exclude jobs from recruiters, and limit results to jobs published today or
within the last week.
There’s more. When you want to research a company, investigate salaries for
that kind of job, see who you may know at the company through networking
sites like LinkedIn and Ryze, or view the job’s location on Google maps, click
on the “more actions” link next to each job search result.
Jobster.com
The hip, youth-oriented Jobster site seems headed toward cyberwall-to-
cyberwall coverage of online recruiting functions — from gathering employee
referrals to social networking. More than a leading vertical online recruiting
service, Jobster lets users search for jobs either nationwide or within a par-
ticular region from its massive inventory of jobs.
For instance, a job seeker curious about the working environment at a partic-
ular company may be able to read spirited postings from people who already
work there in a Jobster-run workers’ online social network (see Chapter 3).
Additionally, you can receive two types of e-mail alerts, which you can cus-
tomize to your job interests and delivery preference. Job alerts give you a
heads-up about new jobs on the Internet that match your interests. Insider
alerts notify you about new jobs that you can be referred to (by someone you
know inside the hiring company) and be recommended for by Jobster. It’s
kind of like getting prequalified for a mortgage when buying a house.
You don’t need to submit a resume through Jobster’s system but if you do,
remember that it handles only plain text (ASCII) versions.
34
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

Receiving a Jobster e-mail gives you a direct connection to a company’s
hiring team, and that helps you stand out from others.
GetTheJob.com
GetTheJob.com gathers job postings from more than 150,000 corporate Web
sites and presents them to job seekers in a searchable database. At this writ-
ing, the site holds about 2.3 million job listings. The inventory of job open-
ings is directly collected only from companies that are hiring; no third-party
recruiters are allowed to post openings. The database of jobs represents the
hidden (or hard-to-find) job market because 50 percent to 60 percent of the
postings can’t be found on commercial job boards.
35
Chapter 2: New Quick Ways to Find the Right Jobs
Where are verticals headed?
“Verticals are going gangbusters,” says search
engine expert Joel Cheesman. The head of
HRSEO, a search engine optimization firm spe-
cializing in recruitment, and the author of
Cheezhead, an award-winning blog about
online search, Cheesman thinks that informa-
tion overload has created the right environment
for vertical search to thrive. A veteran recruit-
ment-industry authority, Cheesman answers my
questions.
Why are we so hooked on search engines?
The human brain has to digest between 3,000
and 10,000 ad messages every day, according
to various studies. Makes your eyes glaze over,
doesn’t it? The rise in acclaim of search engines
like Google is due, in large part, to helping
people cut through the tremendous clutter.
Simply stated, search engines help people find
what they want when they want it. Figure out a
few keywords for your specific need and
Google is typically there with a good answer.
When did verticals come along to create spe-
cific categories?
Although an early model of job verticals first
turned up in 1997 to help users search for 
specific information categories, such as
images, news, or even product information, the
extension of using ever more sophisticated
search to find jobs was a natural development
and makes a lot of sense.
Although not an entirely new phenomenon,
sites that send out spiders to aggregate job con-
tent from sites like CareerBuilder, association
portals, and corporate Web sites have gained
momentum just in the past few years.
How about breaking-news developments?
The vertical job search game looks to stay hot
for the foreseeable future. As of this writing,
Monster is beta testing a vertical offering under
its FlipDog brand. Net-Temps, a stalwart in the
staffing industry, has launched a vertical named
Searchjobs.com.
If success breeds competition, the current land-
scape of vertical job search will show robust
growth. As the great 20th Century comedian
Jimmy Durante often sang: “Everybody wants
to get inna de act.”

GetTheJob’s “Direct Connect” technology links job seekers to each posting
on the hiring company’s Web site. This allows you to read the entire job
description and deadhead for the job, without middle-people standing in
your way.
Another reason to pounce on GetTheJob.com is that it’s free of Internet job
scams and “too good to be true” hype about jobs that don’t really exist.
GetTheJob.com is a newcomer in the ranks of job search verticals, but its
operators say the company is hot on the trail of some new features that will
“vastly improve” the job-seeker experience.
Yahoo! HotJobs 
In addition to providing advertised job listings on the Yahoo! HotJobs site
(hotjobs.yahoo.com), the company uses its sophisticated search technology
to crawl the Internet. It offers job seekers listings from other employer and
job-related sites. This means you can inspect jobs in both employer-paid and
crawled job listings — all at no cost to you.
Besides actively searching for jobs, you can upload your resume so that
employers can find you when they search the company’s database for 
candidates.
Additionally, you can sign up for personal job search agents where you enter
your job criteria, such as industry, location, experience level, salary, and so
forth. You receive new job postings that match your criteria e-mailed to you
directly when a suitable job is in the database. Yahoo! HotJobs also has tools
to help you find a job and also manage your career — everything from a job
recommendation engine to a salary calculator to advice on networking and
interviewing.
Job Boards Rising
Since 1994, when job boards effectively began operating in the then new
recruiting terrain, it has seemed as though another one appears daily, leading
one observer to announce: “Holy resume, Batman — another job board
launches!” Today, as noted earlier in this chapter, estimates put the number
of job boards operating globally as high as 50,000.
36
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

If you’ve been in the job market during the past 15 years or so, you probably
know that a job board is a Web site where you can look for a job. Employers
pay job boards to post their open positions. Job seekers typically view their
jobs for free.
You can apply through a job board for specific positions, or you can post
your resume in the board’s resume database. When you mouse aboard a job
board, you can search for job listings by career field, occupation, job title,
location, and job detail keywords. The emphasis is on local job markets
because most people won’t move for a job unless they have little choice.
Job boards have not been frozen in time. They often add user-friendly
enhancements, including privacy-sensitive features and fast-forward match-
ing of job situation and job seeker.
You find job boards in two basic flavors:
 General job boards, such as CareerBuilder and Monster, cover all kinds
of jobs.
 Specialty (or niche) job boards cover a specific group of jobs, according
to factors like industry (EducationAmerica.net), geography (Atlanta
Recruiter.com) or job-seeker qualifications (MBACareers.com).
Job boards are established hunting grounds for vertical job search engines.
You can, of course, skip the verticals if you prefer and go straight to a job
board. Many people do.
Finding job boards
The only constant in Internet job search is change, but I want to give you a
sense of where to find some high-traffic job boards. As of this writing, the fol-
lowing are the top three sites (according to traffic) in six commonly sought
categories.

ings, which are published monthly.

Using job board resources
The most comprehensive, searchable listing of job boards is published online
by AIRS, a respected training and technology company that helps recruiters
round up candidates.
Revised annually, the listing is called AIRS Job Board and Recruiting
Technology Directory. It is available for downloading to anyone for free, says
AIRS chief executive officer Chris Forman. The total number of job boards
listed is in the thousands, and the directory runs about 100 pages. Each
year’s edition appears at the end of the previous year.
This valuable resource includes job sites for virtually every niche and is orga-
nized in a “yellow pages” style: employment hubs, industry, business func-
tion, government, financial services, healthcare, diversity, technical, college
and alumni, and contractors, both part time and hourly. Find the directory at
www.airsdirectory.com.
The Guide to Internet Job Searching, 2006–2007 edition, by Margaret F. Dikel
and Frances E. Roehm (McGraw-Hill, 2006), is a terrific book that includes the
listing of some 700 job boards and career information sites, compiled and
checked by two pros who have specialized in online job search since it was
invented in the early 1990s. The sites are divided by topic and job area. The
book also includes basic information on how to search online.
Additionally, you can Google to locate specific job boards, using relevant
search terms, such as “job board marketing Nashville” to find a job board in
the Nashville, Tennessee, area that specializes in marketing jobs.

Job Central National Labor Exchange (www.jobcentral.com) is in a class
by itself — a nonprofit Web site owned by 200 major employers through their
membership in Direct Employers Association. JobCentral’s search engine
takes you directly to the careers page of member corporations advertising
open jobs you may spy and want to make a run at.
The Continuing Power of Newspapers
“The dead tree industry is done for and all the job ads are online.”
I’ve seen and heard versions of that requiem for classified print ads in news-
papers and in specialized publications during the past dozen years or so. The
truth is, it’s not true.
39
Chapter 2: New Quick Ways to Find the Right Jobs
Watch out for the black hole at major job boards
Recruiter Mary Nurrenbrock doesn’t sugarcoat
it when describing her view of the practice of
responding to jobs advertised on the major job
boards:
“When you respond to openings directly
through job boards, your resume usually ends
up in a black hole, a passive database. If you’re
responding right from the board, it’s going to HR.
Bad move. These guys are up to their eyeballs
and usually don’t even really know what the
hiring manager is looking for. That is, if the HR
person even sees the resume in the passive
database.
“You need to get to the hiring manager, not HR.
How? When you visit a job board and see a job
that looks like it’s a fit (you notice I didn’t say that
it looks interesting), go to that company’s Web
site and get a name. Most of the corporate sites
have profiles. Get the name of the VP Marketing,
CEO, CMO — whomever the open position is
likely to report to.
“Figuring out the address isn’t hard. Look under
the press releases where you’ll usually find a
company contact e-mail address. Use the same
format — john_doe@, john.doe@, jdoe@ — to
send your resume. If it bounces back, try a dif-
ferent format. If that doesn’t work, try to wran-
gle the address from the company receptionist.
If all else fails, snail mail it.
“What usually happens next is that the hiring
manager sends your resume to HR. But we’re
trying to avoid that, right? No, we’re trying to
avoid the black hole. Now the HR person is look-
ing at a resume that came to her from an inter-
nal source. Big difference!”

As breathless — and later debunked — press releases from online recruiting
vendors roll into my message box, I am reminded of the joke about the
tabloid editor’s instant message to his on-the-spot reporter: “Send all details.
Never mind facts.”
Speaking of facts, job ads certainly are trending online, especially with read-
ers under 35. There’s no debate about that. And my guess is that online
recruiting usage will break even with print or slightly overtake it within the
next couple of years.
But here’s the rest of the story
The latest (December 2005; updates are expected to be issued annually) reli-
able study says that newspaper job ads are still licking the new digital kids on
the block.
The study, issued by The Conference Board (a major business research orga-
nization), reports that despite the proliferation of online job boards, three out
of four job seekers still use newspapers to look for jobs.
The Internet was not far behind, with three out of five job seekers using the ’Net.
In other words, 75 percent of U.S. job seekers are turning the pages with a red
Sharpie in hand, while 60 percent of job seekers are firing up their computers
with a mouse at the ready.
Conventional wisdom contends that print classified advertising is valuable
mainly for hourly and lower-wage jobs. That point, too, is addressed by The
Conference Board study, which states that newspapers are still the most
common method of looking for a job in three of the four major regions across
the United States (The Western region is the exception), and in all but the top
income group (households with incomes of $50,000 and over).
More than 75 percent in the highest group reported using the Internet in their
job search, while roughly 70 percent used newspapers. Those with house-
hold incomes below $25,000 were more likely to search newspapers (80 per-
cent) than the Internet (50 percent).
The net result of The Conference Board finding is that job seekers are work-
ing both sides of the media market. “Job seekers are combining newspaper
ads and checking Internet job postings as part of their job search efforts,”
according to The Conference Board’s research director, Linda Barrington. 
“It is a minority that only uses the Internet.”
40
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

A new wind is blowing on newspapers
Even that minority may be reading online job postings that began life as a
print newspaper job ad. Most help-wanted sections have found second
homes online, so that you can search for jobs in the touch-and-feel comfort of
the pages in your own familiar newspaper or on your favorite newspaper’s
Web site. Moreover, employers who advertise with print ads often request
that you send your resume online to them.
Job finding has become too complex and too challenging to ignore either
medium. As I explain in Chapter 1, you’re hunting in a New Era.
Search success is based not on where you find a job opening but on whether
your responding resume sparks an interview, and what happens during that
interview.
Hunting on Company Web Sites
No one has hard numbers on the number of company (also called corporate)
Web sites today; suffice it to say there are so many you can’t possible look at
all of them for your job hunt (see GetTheJob.com and other vertical job
search engines in the segment above).
Critics accuse many corporate Web sites of being dated. Old school. Flat. Dull.
So what? Does having the latest and greatest matter when you’re hopping on a
company Web site to see whether it offers a job you want? One viewpoint: A
company with a modern Web site is likely to offer other innovations as well,
such as new equipment and state-of-the-art training. Another viewpoint: It
makes little difference whether a company site looks and functions like a relic;
the big question is, does it inventory the kinds of job you want?
Whichever viewpoint you adopt, here are things to bear in mind about sub-
mitting your resume through a corporate Web site.
Unlike general job sites, such as Monster.com and Career Builder, the uni-
verse of company Web sites is decentralized. Unless you’re using a vertical
job search engine, exploring that universe is time consuming. You can easily
spend two hours taking the measure of just a couple of corporate career
sites, picking up details you should know to maximize opportunity.
As you scan a company site, back up to the home page and click to press
releases, annual report, and general areas for any edge you can use to
enhance your application when you move to the careers area.
41
Chapter 2: New Quick Ways to Find the Right Jobs

Susan Joyce, the talent behind Job-Hunt.org, reminds you: “In addition to vis-
iting the employer’s Web site to see what the company does, also check the
company out on Yahoo Finance, BusinessWire.com, Hoover’s, and so forth to
discover the latest news about the employer’s industry. Don’t be the last
person hired before layoffs begin.”
When you reach the careers area and begin submitting your resume in
earnest, remember to pay close attention to each requirement of the position
and customize your resume to show that your qualifications are a bull’s eye
for those requirements. 
Don’t bother sending a hard copy to the company’s human resources depart-
ment; it’s unnecessary and will likely be tossed. You can, of course, send a
hard copy to a hiring manager, as Mary Nurrenbrock discusses in the sidebar
in this chapter, “Watch out for the black hole at major job boards.”
Pay attention to specific instructions on each company’s site. And don’t be
surprised if you’re asked to take online pre-employment tests or respond to
screening questions.
Some corporate sites won’t accept anonymous candidates who cloak their
identity. Some candidates use anonymous resumes to maintain their privacy
and stay out of trouble with their current employer. An anonymous resume is
stripped of the resume subject’s name and contact information. Former
employers may not be identified by name but described generically (ABC
Tools becomes Mid-Sized Tool Company, for instance). Anonymous resumes
are distributed by job sites or third-party employment services but employ-
ers often consider them to be too much trouble to bother with.
If you aren’t comfortable or experienced in applying through corporate Web
sites, visit a few of the best-of-the-best company sites for job seekers, as deter-
mined for 2006 by consultants Gerry Crispin and Mark Mehler, principals of
CareerXroads.com. Crispin and Mehler are definitive authorities on Fortune
500 recruiting practices. Each year they review corporate sites’ ability to
“target, engage, inform, and respect the job seeker.”

Seeking and Finding Is Easier than Ever
As you launch your job-finding campaign, I recommend that you start with
vertical job search engines as a destination for your OnTarget resumes; if you
don’t seem to be scoring winners, add general and niche job boards, as well
as company Web sites.
As modern tools assist your job hunt, be glad that you can find job leads
today much faster than ever before. But while the Web is indisputably the
engine driving change in the job market, Southern California career coach
Mark James (www.hireconsultant.com) puts its value for most people in
perspective:
A recipe for unemployment: Click and send, cross your fingers, and hope the
phone rings. A recipe for employment: Press a full-bore campaign that includes
human networking and researching job leads from all media.

W
eb 2.0 technologies — the new matchmakers in the job market — are
adding opportunities for you to connect with employers. (I explain
Web 2.0 and its forerunner, Web 1.0, in Chapter 1.)
Web 2.0 sites are online services you visit to make something happen, usually
with other people. The new wave of start-up hubs typically depends not on
traditional top-down communication from the site’s management but on
bottom-up data flow from you and me and, well, everyone who wants to con-
tribute content. Techies refer to the new services by the geeky phrase “user-
contributed content.”
You probably recognize the names of some recently popular everyone-is-
smarter-than-anyone ventures. From the youth-attracting hangout at
MySpace to the video-sharing site YouTube to the grass-roots online encyclo-
pedia Wikipedia, they all encourage interconnection and input. Jump on in;
the cyber-water’s fine, they say. The services provide the technology, and the
rest of us provide the substance.

These Web 2.0 services are finding their way into the job world. Many are
free, drawing an income stream from ads; others charge fees. You can check
out ways to use your resumes to snag interviews on any of them. The only
way to understand this newfangled stuff is to use it. With a little practice, it’s
easy.
Whether you’re a job seeker with a streak of ambition a mile wide or a person
who just wants to go with the flow but keep an escape hatch handy if your
job starts to sink, now’s the time to bone up on the rudiments of how tech-
nology can serve you in the job market.
I describe the following carousel of job search tools with a broad brush
because technology at the leading edge changes rapidly. Some observers 
estimate the average lifespan for much current technology is about 24
months. Whatever the time frame of change, its warp speed renders many
details quickly obsolete in a book. Not only does technology move forward,
but companies using it come and go.
This chapter is intended to inform you, not to serve as a short-lived directory
of Web 2.0 services. Instead, these pages are designed to start you off well by
pointing you in newer directions.
Note that I describe the following Web 2.0 technologies separately for clarity,
but in practice, they often work side by side or join together. For example,
the job search site Jobster (www.jobster.com) has gathered together most
Web 2.0 features that you can imagine under its umbrella. Simply Hired
(www.simplyhired.com), Indeed (www.indeed.com), and JobCentral
National Labor Exchange (www.jobcentral.com) are additional examples
of sites that combine a number of Web 2.0 technologies described in this
chapter.
What follows is a nonexhaustive list of nuggets from the Web 2.0 world.
Online Employee Referral
You’ve probably heard this adage: Birds of a feather flock together. The
recruiting industry translates that to mean good people tend to know other
good people. In a nutshell, that’s the central argument behind online
employee referral services.
Because employers tend to rely on referrals as a way to spot great candi-
dates, job seekers can increase their odds of being interviewed and hired by
getting employees and other “connectors” (individuals who bring people
together) to sing their praises.
46
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

What it is
An online referral service is an e-mail job distribution method paid for by
employers. As a job seeker, an online employee referral service helps you
identify which of your contacts may know people at the companies where
you want to work. A referral service may also help you request a direct refer-
ral to some employers’ hiring teams. And the service may enable you to keep
tabs on jobs that you can get referred for via the people you know and the
people they know.
A number of services pay a fee to referrers — company employees or trusted
outsiders acting as amateur recruiters — when a hire is made. The typical fee
is $500 to $3,000 or more. The size of the reward varies widely but generally
is a much smaller fee than the 20 to 30 percent of the new hire’s first-year
salary paid to professional third-party recruiters. Some online recruiting ser-
vices pay no fees to referrers.
The industry leaders, according to the Electronic Recruiting News in Email
publisher John Sumser, are Jobster (www.jobster.com) and H3
(www.h3.com), both of which are free for job seekers.
“Lots of companies and organizations have an internal (private label) online
referral program,” Sumser says. “Associations, trade groups, and other
shared interest organizations also have them.”
Getting started
Get out your Christmas-card list and directories of any group of which you’re
a member — alumni, church, professional organization, environmental
activist group, bowling league, and so forth. Familiarize yourself with online
recruiting services that refer people to companies. Read the site’s FAQ
(Frequently Asked Questions) and follow directions.
The basic process of getting inside the loop of a referral system works like
this:
1. When you spot a company where you’d like to work, check your per-
sonal contact lists for the name of anyone you know who works at that
company. Ask your contact for a referral to the job. 
2. After you have been referred, you can inquire about jobs, refer your
friends, and get alerts by e-mail about jobs that interest you.
47
Chapter 3: Spotlight Your Resume in a Web 2.0 World

Finding more info
Online employee referral programs often work in tandem with online social
networking technology. The programs themselves are the best information
source.
Online Social Networking
How do you feel about posting your persona on an e-billboard for virtually
anyone to see? (Yes, social networking services insist that passwords and
other privacy guards are in place, but they’re far from foolproof.)
Job seekers and employers worldwide are beginning to take a page from
youth-oriented MySpace (www.myspace.com), Facebook (www.facebook.
com), and other social nets as they turn to business-oriented services where
people post career profiles and recruiters search for prospective employees.
What it is
Online networking services offer you help in three ways:
 Enabling you to locate contacts, who, working inside a company you
covet, are a potential source of referrals, names of managers, tips on
company culture, hiring mode, and other useful information. You may
have to hop from one person’s profile to another to another and so forth
until you reach your objective.
 Helping find managers in a company to whom you can send your unso-

 Introducing you to recruiters, who can see your profile in a virtual net-
working service and contact you.
LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) is the best known of the business-oriented
virtual networks. Others with a business focus include Jobster’s (www.
jobster.com) network, Ryze (www.ryze.com), Ecademy (www.ecademy.
com), and ExecuNet (www.exeunet.com).

Eons (www.eons.com) is a virtual network for Americans aged 50 plus, with
a broad content that sometimes includes job suggestions. Classmates.com
(www.classmates.com) is more for “that old gang of mine” connections but
sports a work-and-career section where you can look for acquaintances by
company. Zoominfo (www.zoominfo.com) is not a virtual network, but can
deliver some of the same results for job seekers in that it is a search engine
for discovering people, companies, and relationships.
Some sites are free of charge; others charge fees for contacting other mem-
bers and certain other services. A few are fee only.
Indiscreet postings on a social network can mean really big trouble for job
seekers. Many employers review profiles on social networking sites when
considering candidates for jobs. Surprisingly, the hard lessons learned aren’t
always acquired by the young and the wireless flouting photos from drunken
parties, stories of sexual escapades, profanity-laced comments, and similar
projections of less-than-businesslike behavior.
Experienced professionals old enough to know better can make unintended
strategy errors too. A California woman called in sick so that she could join
friends on a rafting trip. The woman’s job hit the fan when her boss, checking
entries on the boss’s teen-aged daughter’s vertical network, stumbled across
a dated photo of the fibbing professional employee enjoying white-water fun
on the very day she was supposedly ill. Big oops.
The safest bet is to assume future employers will read everything you post,
including extreme political or religious views and rants on any controversial
topic. Here’s an easy guideline to stay out of job market trouble: Treat every
online profile with the respect you give a resume.
Getting started
Think about online networking as comfortable connectivity. Instead of deal-
ing with faceless strangers whom you wouldn’t know if you tripped over
them, you deal with individuals you now or soon will know, and whose faces
you can see and identify.
The essential process to hook up with an online social network follows this
pattern:
1. Someone who’s already in the network invites you to join. You may also
be able to join without an invite — most virtual networks also let users
join on their own.
49
Chapter 3: Spotlight Your Resume in a Web 2.0 World

2. After selecting a virtual network that appears to include your kind of
people, register, create a password and fill in a career profile. (For pri-
vacy and safety, do not include your street address in your profile.)
3. Explore the range of other network members who have registered with
the service.
4. Make contacts as appropriate to your job search.

The job referral sites themselves are your best source of additional 
information.

Does your online profile do more harm than good?
Employers want to hire people whose qualifica-
tions are a good fit for the job’s requirements.
Recruiters often try to “source” these candi-
dates from scratch by identifying relevant can-
didates through online social networks and
blogs.
The bright side to online profile sourcing is 
that the more information in your profile and 
the more sites where it’s posted, the more
recruiters who can find you and the more they
can know about you to incite their interest.
The dark side to online profile sourcing is that
you risk typecasting yourself if you are a person
who could be considered for several different
career roles (school admissions officer, health
plan coordinator, computer sales representa-
tive, and so on.) Pigeonholing yourself limits the
range of your opportunities.
In another scenario, employers are willing to
spend time checking you out online only if
they’re already very interested because of a
referral, or successful interview, or well-done
resume. An inappropriate fact on a canned pro-
file could cause reconsideration of your value.
Put your best face forward
A problem with some profiles is the tendency to
share insider stuff that seems okay when you’re
speaking to friends but may not be perceived
favorably by potential employers. One job
seeker wrote that she rides a motorcycle with
her husband, which could raise questions about
risk taking and health insurance costs. Her rev-
elation would have been positive had she been
applying for a job marketing Hogs or as a stunt
double, but, alas, she wanted to be a court
reporter.
Another job seeker led off his profile with the
news that he is a cancer survivor. Health insur-
ance costs? Reliable attendance? Longevity on
the job?
The litmus test for revealing personal data in an
online profile is the same as that for a resume:
Does including this information enhance my
perceived qualifications for the type of job I
seek? If not, out it goes! Image is everything.
Remember the workplace is not a confessional.
Celebrate marketable abilities, skip private
spice, and gag motormouth tendencies. 

Blogs
Blogs are more plentiful than bubbles in champagne. Millions and millions of
them effervesce around the globe — and even from outer space. In 2006, the
space tourist and American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari wrote of every-
day life on the International Space Station, commenting in her blog that space
smells like a “burned almond cookie.”
Earlier blogs (Web logs in the 1990s) were online personal journals filled with
trivia and aimless reflections of a blogger’s day. It’s an understatement to say
that times have changed — and at broadband speed.
The usefulness of blogs to job seekers is gathering attention — and, some
say, momentum — helped along by the morphing of those early personal
journals into sleek Web sites that showcase content posted by one or several
authors, and which welcome comments from visitors on these posts. A small
but growing number of employment-related blogs are capturing audience and
advertising to become media stars and influences in the job market. 
What it is
You can write blogs today that show your expertise in any career field.
Although rare, one woman went a step further and blogged her way into a
job. Carolynn Duncan, hearing about a job opening from a friend, created a
blog specifically to convince the hiring executive at Provo Labs Consulting in
Provo, Utah, that she was the right person for the job. She called her blog
“Why Provo Labs Wants to Hire Carolynn Duncan” and posted it on Blogger
(www.blogger.com). After reading her words and calling her in for an inter-
view, the hiring executive offered Duncan the position, adding “I often scour a
candidate’s resume, e-mail address, and Web site for anything resembling a
blog.”
Company blogs are not quite as common as crab grass but plenty of them are
up and running. At Microsoft, for instance, employees write blogs about
topics pertinent to their work; now Microsoft is using those blogs to develop
a dialogue with potential hires. An example is Heather Hamilton’s blog,
“Marketing and Finance at Microsoft” (blogs.msdn.com/heatherleigh).
The vast majority of Americans won’t create a blog but will settle for reading
blogs and perhaps making a comment now and then. Researchers for the
trade publication Advertising Age say that about 35 million workers in the
United States visit blogs and spend an average of 40 minutes a day reading
them (office goof-off time?). The researchers speculate that one out of four
blog visits could be considered job related.
51
Chapter 3: Spotlight Your Resume in a Web 2.0 World

Blogs are the ultimate Web insider’s clubhouse. They attract loyal, everyday
readers who hold an avid interest in a blog’s topic. Recruiters understand
that to hire the right people, you have to go where the right people hang out.
That’s why recruiters cruise career-field-related blogs, looking for top talent
in a specific occupation — or for experts who can steer them to top talent. 
In a recent development, job ads are beginning to appear on blogs. Joel
Cheesman (www.cheezhead.com), a leading consultant in online recruiting
technology, agrees that niche targeting by employers through blogs is grow-
ing: “Blogs are exceptional ways for employers to reach the eyeballs of top
talent to fill their job openings,” Cheesman says. “As a result, an increasing
number of blogs are providing the ability to post jobs. We’re at the start of
the blog niche targeting trend.”
The nascent blog-meets-job-board move is beginning in the information tech-
nology sector, which is where traditional boards also started. A couple of
examples of blogs with jobs as this book went to press: Crunchboard
(www.crunchboard.com) and 37Signals (www.37signals.com).
Getting started
Finding blogs that you want to read regularly takes a bit of shopping around.
Try these suggestions to kick off your hunt:
1. Find the right blogs for you. One option is to use your browser. Enter a
topic and add “blog” to the search term. For example, “employment
blog” brings up a zillion possibilities, from George’s Employment Blawg
(www.employmentblawg.com) and Labor Employment Law Blog
(www.laboremploymentlawblog.com) to The Self-Employed Business
Owners Blog (www.passionforbusiness.com/blogs) and
Employment Digest (www.employmentdigest.com).
Don’t forget to look for blogs in your career field. For instance, searching
for “nurse blog” results in a long roster of nursing blogs. One, Med
Blogopathy (www.mediblogopathy.blogspot.com) is packed with
more human interest text than jobs but the site is a good place to get the
feel for content and the types of comments you eventually may want to
make.
You can also turn to a blog search engine for blogs, such as Search4Blogs
(www.search4blogs.com).
2. When you find a blog you like, check out the site’s blogroll (links of blogs
on similar topics). George’s Employment Blawg, for example, lists sev-
eral pages of other employment and recruiting blogs. The same is true
for Med Blogopathy.
52
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

3. Time manage your chosen blogs by reading from a free news aggregator,
such as Bloglines (www.bloglines.com). Once you’ve registered and
selected the blogs you want to track, you can quickly monitor what’s
been posted since you last read them because new information appears
in boldface. If you’re tracking only one or two blogs, you can skip the
news aggregator.
To establish your own blog, find a host site that offers free service for begin-
ning bloggers — such as Blogger (www.blogger.com), BlogEasy (www.blog
easy.com), or Typepad (www.typepad.com) — and start writing.

Really Simple Syndication (RSS)
The evolution of technology that is designed to give you a heads-up when a
job you want becomes available reminds me of the difference between peri-
odic television network news programming and all-news cable television.
Instead of having to watch the news at 6 p.m. or 11 p.m., you can watch late-
breaking news on your timetable 24/7.
Familiar free online job search agents at major job boards periodically send
you e-mail alerts about jobs that meet your specific search criteria. But the
modern and also free Really Simple Syndication (RSS) technology whisks live
feeds to your computer or handheld devices around the clock with the latest
jobs from thousands of employers and job sites. 
What it is
RSS is a rapidly growing platform for the immediate distribution of online
content, in this case, job postings.
How does RSS beat the older e-mail job agents? Three ways: efficiency, rele-
vance, and timeliness. Here’s how it works:
 Sending RSS job feeds to your RSS reader prevents e-mail job alerts from
clogging your in-box.
53
Chapter 3: Spotlight Your Resume in a Web 2.0 World

 RSS feeds are said to more closely target your stated requirements. Like
an advanced search, you get a closer match to what you want. For exam-
ple, if you’re an accountant and you want a job in Milwaukee, an e-mail
search agent might return everything with the term “accountant” or its
variations, such as accounting for lost automobiles in Milwaukee. RSS
job feeds are programmed to mirror your wishes. 
RSS job feeds are a wonderful way to get the first word when a new job
is posted. And the feeds can be programmed to also include breaking
news in industry concerns, information that could put you at the head of
the line in job interviews.
Getting started
How do you read RSS feeds? You can receive RSS feeds in a few different
ways. You can download a news reader program, many of which are free; use
your Web browser to search for “free newsreader program.” Alternatively,
some browsers and Web sites offer similar news-reader ability already built
in. Vertical job search engines described in Chapter 2 give simple instruc-
tions on how to add their live job feeds to your computer or mobile devices.
And if you’re really unsure, again use your Web browser to search for “install
an RSS reader.”

Instant Messaging
And you thought instant messaging (IM) was just for those under arthritic
age. The quicker-than-e-mail alternative for online communication is moving
rapidly to mainstream America. A recent online post from Ray Geide, the pub-
lisher of the free online newsletter “Ray’s Computer Tips,” says his wife intro-
duced him to IM when he was on a trip to Russia. “She didn’t want to put up
with the slowness of sending e-mails back and forth,” Geide says.
54
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

“With instant messaging, we could see when the other was on the Internet
and communicate back and forth in real time,” Geide explains. “It was like
talking on the telephone except that instead of talking we typed and instead
of using telephones we used our computers connected to the Internet. As
talking on a telephone happens in real time, so instant messaging happens in
real time. As soon as the person you are messaging with types a message and
sends it, you see it and can respond by sending a message back which that
person sees at that time.”
What it is
Instant messaging services are yet another new tool you can use to receive
real-time or near real-time job postings. An IM service allows you to send
messages and resumes to any of the people on your buddy list or contact list
(the IM version of an address book), as long as that person is online.
Examples of IM messages you might send to your buddy list include these:
 I’m looking for a sales job. Not retail. Here’s resume. Can anyone push it
around?
 I’m trying to get hired in accounting by XYZ corp. Know anyone inside who
could walk my resume to HR or acct. mgr?
 Have you seen any great job postings for insurance claims adjusters? 
Pls advise.
 Hey, 300 pals, who’ll rehearse me for big job interview?
 Who just interviewed for job you don’t want? Maybe I do. Try me.
Posting a profile online creates privacy issues, but if you want to do so and to
use IM in your job campaign, you need to add your IM information to your
job search account at job sites and social or business networks and job refer-
ral services that support the technology.
Alison Doyle, About.com (www.about.com) job searching guide, cautions
you to adopt a professional-sounding IM screen name. If you’ve already got a
goofy IM screen name (like nocrapola, 60isnew40, or girlgonewild), set up a
new IM account used only for job searching with a no-nonsense moniker.
Hacking is a dark side of computer security problems of worms, viruses, and
other Internet ills that already plague e-mail. The number of “poisoned”
instant messages is exploding, in part because of trust expectations.
55
Chapter 3: Spotlight Your Resume in a Web 2.0 World

Although smart computer users know not to open suspicious e-mail, they’re
more trusting of a message sent from someone on their IM buddy list.
Solution: Install antivirus software designed specifically for IM programs.
Getting started
Ready, aim, download an instant messaging program like this:
1. Choose one or more from the biggest players in the free public IM
space.
Working from most prominent down, they are
• AOL Instant Messenger (www.aim.com)
• MSN Messenger (get.live.com)
• Yahoo! Messenger (messenger.yahoo.com)
• ICQ (www.icq.com)
• Google Talk (talk.google.com)
• Internet Relay Chat (www.mirc.com)
The more technically minded IMer who wants to be in several IM spaces
at once can use free or inexpensive software, such as Trillian (www.
ceruleanstudios.com) or Gaim (gaim.sourceforge.net) to help
you keep it all straight.
2. Add buddies to your buddy list. For job search purposes, the more the
merrier.
3. Begin chatting away and building your network.

Podcasts
As a job seeker, you can use a podcast the same way you can use a blog to
spotlight your achievements and experience — to differentiate yourself from
those with whom you are competing.
56
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

“Just having a podcast will set you apart from others and positions you as
being on the cutting edge,” says communications strategist Catherine Kaputa,
author of U R a Brand!: How Smart People Brand Themselves for Business
Success (Davies-Black, 2006). “You can turn an industry presentation, talk or
panel discussion into a podcast to underscore your leadership and presenta-
tion skills.”
Podcasting isn’t yet mainstream, but based on reports that podcast feeds
increased tenfold in six months in 2006, they may be headed in that direction.
If you want to try podcasting as a way to get noticed in a Web 2.0 world,
Kaputa recommends that for the highest impact, you do it while podcasting
is still novel.
What it is
Podcasting is a way to distribute audio and video feeds (information or music
over the Internet), rather than text alone. To make a podcast, you need a
computer, microphone, Internet access and recording software, such as
Roxio Easy Media Creator (www.roxio.com) or Audacity (audacity.
sourceforge.net) a free audio editor.
To listen to a podcast on a mobile device (iPod, Blackberry, MP3 player, or
cell phone) or a computer, you need Internet access.
An employer may use a podcast as a recruiting tool to help spread a branding
message that explains why the company is a good place to work and to bol-
ster communications with candidates the company hopes one day to hire.
When a podcast is offered on a Web site, the sponsors make it easy for you
with an invitation to “sign up here” and click.
Getting started
You can find a tutorial on How do I make a podcast?” on Boutell.com (www.
boutell.com/newfaq/creating/makepodcast.html). Or, if you’re the
sort of person who’d rather make reservations than dinner, consider using
the commercial Feedburner service (www.feedburner.com/fb/a/

Web 2.0 Is a Work in Progress
“Web 2.0: The New Guy at Work” shouts a headline in a recent BusinessWeek
article. The article’s subhead continues the thought with a powerful claim:
“As they seep into corporate offices, Web Services will change how you do
business.” Take that to include how you do resume business.
The capsules of Web services in this chapter describe those that are first out
of the gate, but others are standing by, not yet slick enough to make a run for
the winner’s circle.
As a single example of advances that, at this writing, are not quite ready for
prime time, mobile job search is a promising technology under development.
Imagine seeing a text message of “Job match! We have a job for you.” as you
check your mobile phone while at the mall, watching your kid’s baseball
game or even walking along the seashore. Mobile job search technology can
deliver job search result summaries to mobile phones and other handheld
devices. But for now, the technology doesn’t allow candidates to apply for a
position with a handheld device. Instead, candidates must use e-mail to
respond to a job alert or to send a new resume. Those challenges will be
worked out, probably in the near future.
Technology is always evolving. Stay tuned, and make it work for you.
It never hurts to make friends with nerds and geeks.

Familiar Search Tools That 
Haven’t Gone Away
In This Chapter:
 Revisiting scannable resumes and fax machines
 Eyeing fading plain text versus handsome resumes
 Foiling identity theft and coping with spam filters
 Understanding online screening techniques
N
ot all Web technology tools have held up under the rigors of time and
progress. 
Certain familiar, day-to-day job search tools — job boards and company Web
sites, for instance — retain star status in determining where to send your
resumes. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of job boards and company Web
sites.)
The handsome and fully formatted word-processed resume is another earlier
tool that remains on job seekers’ hit parade. The handsome resume reap-
peared about five years ago as an improvement to the drab plain text (ASCII)
resume that was in vogue during the 1990s when it was the only form that
older computer-scanning technology could electronically read.
But other search tools from the 1990s — such as scannable and plain text
resumes — are showing their age. 
In this chapter, I examine the current state of selected first-born electronic
technology tools used in the job market — and give you the lowdown on how
they can shape your employment chances.

Scannable Resumes: Same as Ever
A scannable resume is a resume that a recipient, usually a clerk in an employ-
ment office, scans into a computer as an image. Because computers read
resumes differently than people do, you have to follow certain inconvenient
rules, which I describe in this section, to be fairly sure that your scannable
resume will be read as you intended. 
A scannable resume may start life as a paper resume that you can postal
mail, hand deliver, or fax on a fax machine; the employer uses a scanning
machine to enter a hard copy resume into a candidate database. More often
these days, you create a scannable resume on your computer and e-mail it to
an employer, who electronically enters it directly into a database.
After an employer has your scannable resume, computer software extracts
from it a summary of basic information, pulling out factors like your name,
contact information, skills, work history, years of experience, and education.
Scanned resumes and their extracted summaries sleep peacefully until an HR
specialist or recruiter searches the summaries by keywords to retrieve candi-
dates who match the requirements of a job opening. The technology ranks
candidates, from the most qualified to the least qualified. The relevant
resumes get a wake-up call and pop to the recruiting screen, where human
eyes take over the recruiting tasks.
The once-desirable scannable resumes are on their way out, joining MS DOS
(operating software) in computer museums. Recruiters now prefer the newer
intake systems that allow resumes to travel smoothly online and move
straight into an electronic resume-management database without the need to
conform to scanning rules.
Even so, don’t trash your scannable resume just yet. If an employer or job
site directs you to send a resume that can be scanned, do it. And do it well,
so that your resume doesn’t go AWOL in a database. Take the following steps
to prevent scanning errors from putting you on the sidelines:
 Use type that’s clear and readable. Don’t use a condensed typeface.
White space separates letters; no space smushes them together. Letters
must be distinctively clear with crisp, unbroken edges. Avoid arty, deco-
rative typefaces.
 Avoid these bad-scan elements:
• Italics or script 
• Underlining
• Reverse printing (white letters on a black field)
• Shadows or shading
• Hollow bullets (they read like the letter o)
60
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

• Number signs (#) for bullets (the computer may read it as a phone
number)
• Boxes (computers try to read them like letters)
• Two-column formats or designs that look like newspapers
• Symbols, such as a logo
• Vertical lines (computers read them like the letter l)
• Vertical dates (use horizontal dates: 2006–2010)
 Feel free to use larger fonts for section headings and your name. A font
size of 14 to 16 points is good. Larger headings look better on the elec-
tronic image of your resume when humans read it (which they don’t
always do). I recommend you format the body of your resume in a 12-
point font size, the section headings in 14-point, and the name in 16-point.
 Do keep your scannable resume simple in design and straightforward.
Recruiters call this approach “plain vanilla,” and they like it because it
doesn’t confuse computers.
 Do send your paper resume without staples. Paper clips are okay.
Follow this tip for all resumes that you mail or hand deliver because sta-
ples are a pain to pull out before feeding a scanner one page at a time.
Plain Text Resumes: A Long Last Gasp
The plain text resume (also known as an ASCII resume) is an online document
constructed without formatting in plain text file format. It is most often sent
by e-mail, but can be sent by fax, postal mail, or courier.
The main characteristic about this resume is its looks (or lack of same). It’s
so ugly only a computer could love it. See Figure 4-1 for an example of a plain
text resume.
61
Chapter 4: Familiar Search Tools That Haven’t Gone Away
The old/new fax trick
Sometimes you may find it advantageous to go
back to the future when your online resumes
never seem to result in a callback. If you can
learn the name and fax number of the hiring
manager for a job you want, try sending the
manager your scannable resume by fax. 
Sending scannable resumes by postal mail is
another option, especially effective with older,
conservative managers and company owners.

Plain Text Resume
62
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

Although plain text resumes are heading into the sunset, until the recruiting
world is totally living large with handsomely formatted e-resumes, you may
be stuck with the plain-Jane look. So here’s the drill. Create your resume in
your favorite word-processing program, save it, and then convert it to plain
text (ASCII) like this: 
1. Click Edit →Select All.
2. Click Edit →Copy.
3. Open notepad. To get there click Start →Programs →Accessories →
Notepad.
4. Click Edit →Paste.
5. Turn on the “Word-wrap” feature in the “Format” drop-down menu.
6. Save the resume as “yourname.txt” (for example, “JohnGill.txt”).
Don’t forget to spell check before you save your resume as an ASCII file.
Because your resume now has ASCII for brains, it won’t recognize the format-
ting commands that your word-processing program uses. 
Don’t use any characters that aren’t on your keyboard, such as “smart
quotes” (those tasteful, curly quotation marks that you see in this book) or
mathematical symbols. They don’t convert correctly, and your resume will
need fumigating to rid itself of squiggles and capital U’s.
You know that you’re off in the wrong direction if you have to change the
preferences setting in your word processor or otherwise go to a lot of trouble
to get a certain character to print. Remember that you can use dashes and
asterisks (they’re on the keyboard), but you can’t use bullets (they’re not on
the keyboard).
Although you can’t use bullets, bold, or underlined text in a plain text docu-
ment, you can use plus signs (+) at the beginning of lines to draw attention to
part of your document. You can also use a series of dashes to separate sec-
tions and capital letters to substitute for boldface. When you don’t know
what else to use to sharpen your ASCII effort, you can always turn to Old
Reliable — white space.
Be on guard against other common ASCII landmines:
 Typeface/fonts: You can’t control the typeface or font size in your ASCII
resume. The text appears in the typeface and size that the recipient’s
computer is set for. This means that boldface, italics, or different font
sizes don’t appear in the online plain text version. Use all caps for words
that need special emphasis.
63
Chapter 4: Familiar Search Tools That Haven’t Gone Away

 Word wrap: Don’t use the word wrap feature when writing your resume
because it will look as weird as a serial letter E running vertically down a
page. Odd-looking word wrapping is one of the cardinal sins of online
resumes. Set your margins at 0 and 65, or set the right margin at 6.5
inches. Then end each line after 65 characters with hard carriage returns
(press the Enter key) to insert line breaks.
 Proportional typefaces: Don’t use proportional typefaces that have dif-
ferent widths for different characters (such as Times Roman). Instead,
use a fixed-width typeface (such as Courier) so that you have a true 65-
character line. For example, if you compose and send your resume in
Courier 12 and it’s received in the Arial typeface, it should still work well
with most e-mail programs, surviving transport with a close resem-
blance to the original line length.
 Tabs: Don’t use tabs; they get wiped out in the conversion to ASCII. Use
your spacebar instead.
 Alignment: Your ASCII resume is automatically left-justified. If you need
to indent a line or center a heading, use the spacebar.
 Page numbers: Omit page numbers. You can’t be certain where the page
breaks will fall, and your name and page number could end up halfway
south on a page.
When you send your ASCII resume, paste it with a cover note (a very brief
cover letter) into the body of your e-mail.
E-Forms: Fill in the Blankety-Blanks
The e-form is just a shorter version of the plain text resume, and you usually
find it on company Web sites. The company encourages you to apply by set-
ting your plain text into designated fields of the forms on the site.
The e-form is almost like an application form, except that it lacks the legal
document status an application form acquires when you sign it, certifying
that all facts are true.
Follow the on-screen instructions given by each employer to cut and paste
the requested information into the site’s template. You’re basically just filling
in the blanks with your contact information that’s supplemented by data
lifted from your plain text resume.
64
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

Remember that e-forms can’t spell check, so cutting and pasting your resume
into the e-form body, instead of typing it in manually, is your best bet. Because
you spell checked your resume before converting it to ASCII (of course you
did!), at least you know that everything is likely to be spelled correctly.
Virtually all company Web sites now encourage you to apply online through
their applicant portals. You’re asked to fill out an online form, upload, or cut
and paste your resume. Most companies ask you to answer demographic
questions about race, gender, and so forth as a way of collecting data for the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). You aren’t required to
include this information to be considered for employment. Nevertheless,
women and minorities are well advised to oblige the demographics request.
What if you’re a white male? Your call.
E-forms work well for job seekers in high-demand occupations, such as nurs-
ing, but they don’t work so well for job seekers who need to document moti-
vation, good attitude, and other personal characteristics and achievements
that computers don’t search for. When you rely on an e-form to get an
employer’s attention, you’re playing 100 percent on the employer’s turf.

The subject line online
Whether you’re sending a scannable, plain text,
or handsome word-processed resume online,
the subject line of your e-mail can bring you
front and center to a recruiter’s attention.
 When you respond to an advertised job, use
the job title. If none is listed, use the refer-
ence number.
 When you send an unsolicited resume,
write a short “sales” headline. For example:
Bilingual teacher, soc studies/6 yrs’ exp. Or,
Programmer, experienced, top skills: Java,
C++.
Never just say Bilingual teacher
or
Programmer. Sell yourself! Keep rewriting
until you’ve crammed as many sales points
as possible into your “marquee.”
Should you show a “cc” for “copy sent” on your
resume? If you’re e-mailing a hiring manager
(such as the accounting manager), copy the
human resources department manager; that
saves the hiring manager from having to for-
ward your resume to human resources and is
more likely to result in your landing in the com-
pany’s resume database to be considered for
any number of jobs.

Yippee! The Fully Designed, 
Handsome Resume Is Back!
Before electronic and online resumes came along, the good-looking paper
resume was the gold standard. The best sported a number of compelling
embellishments: attractive formatting, appealing typefaces and fonts, bold-
faced headings, italics, bullets, and underlining. The embellishments, taste-
fully done, were refreshing to read until technology all but killed them off
more than a decade ago in favor of the electronically correct but truly blah
plain text resumes I describe in the section “Plain Text Resumes: A Long 
Last Gasp.”
The handsome resume was wonderful and was sorely missed by resume read-
ers who grew bleary-eyed looking at pure text the whole long day.
That’s in the past. Smart technology has brought back the good-lookers we
gave up in the ’90s to make sure our resumes arrived intact over the Internet.
Now you can usually attach your resume as a fully formatted, handsome dog
of a document in a word-processing program, usually MS Word or
WordPerfect. Check out Chapter 8 to find out how to make yours good-
looking enough to be voted the Resume with Which You Are Most Likely to
Succeed.

Ed’s attachment etiquette
Ed Struzik knows what recruiters want. Struzik,
president of BEKS Data Services, Inc. (www.
beksdata.com), speaks from the vantage
point of a dozen years’ experience in providing
outsourced resume-processing services and
applicant-tracking system consulting to numer-
ous Fortune 100 companies. Here are a few pit-
falls he says resume senders need to avoid
when e-mailing attachments:
 Do not attach EXE files. An Executable file
could contain a virus, and no one will
chance having the hard drive or network
infected.
 Do not attach ZIP files. Who’s to say the ZIP
file doesn’t contain an infected Executable?
And besides, can your resume be so large
that you have to ZIP it?
 Do not attach password-protected docu-
ments. How would you expect someone or
something to open it without the password?

From Identity Theft to Recruiter Turnoff:
Why Resume Blasting Is a Bad Idea
Resume blasting services (also jokingly known as resume spamming ser-
vices) advertise their willingness to save you time and trouble by “blasting”
your resume to thousands of recruiters and hiring managers all over the
Internet — for a fee, of course. The pitches are tempting, but should you avail
yourself of this miraculous service? Just say no! Resume blasting can bring
you big trouble, from making identity theft easier for crooks, to irritating your
boss, to making you an “untouchable” for recruiters. 
Privacy and identity theft problems
Concerning identity theft issues, privacy expert Pam Dixon advises being cau-
tious with your resume’s information. On her nonprofit World Privacy Forum
(www.worldprivacyforum.org), she continually updates a must-read
report titled “Job Seeker’s Guide to Resumes: Twelve Resume Posting Truths.”
Truth Number One says this: “If you’re going to post a resume online, post
your resume privately. Most job sites offer anonymous posting that lets you
mask your contact information and e-mail address when you post a resume.
67
Chapter 4: Familiar Search Tools That Haven’t Gone Away
Stop and ask directions
Although scannable and plain text resumes are
headed the way of carbon paper, and the vast
majority of resume readers prefer to cast their
eyes on the handsome resume, make a reality
check. You job hunt in a time of transitioning
technology, including an explosion of filters that
will not accept word attachments. The attach-
ments are refused as a way to avoid viruses and
to keep out spam (including resume spam).
This means that you can never be 100 percent
sure what technology is being used where you
want to send your resume. The solution is to ask
by telephone or by e-mail the company human
resource department or the company recep-
tionist the following question:
I want to be sure I’m using your preferred
technology to submit my resume. Can I
send it as an attachment, say in MS Word
or WordPerfect?
Alternatively, if you don’t have a clue, you can
send your resume within the body of your e-mail
as plain text and also attach it as a word-
processed document.

This resume posting option allows you to decide who sees your real informa-
tion, such as your home address. Masking this information is perhaps the
single most important step job seekers who want to post a resume online can
take to protect themselves.”
Is Pam Dixon overreacting? No. The media has been full of horror stories of
identity theft for some years. 
Admittedly, merely being careful about releasing your resume information
online won’t keep you safe from identity theft in these days when the guard
rails on privacy are coming down in so many ways in so many places. But do
be stingy with your private information. 
Identity theft may be the worst-case scenario, but it isn’t the only life-altering
problem that can arise when you put your business on e-street.
Risks in your workplace
Use a resume-blasting service while you’re employed, and you might lose
your current job. “Many employers do search for their employees’ resumes in
job site resume databases and search engines,” explains Susan Joyce, CEO of
Job-Hunt.org, who tracks the privacy issue.
68
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 
Get your resume past spam gatekeepers
You may not know whether your resume
becomes cyber-litter because a spam or virus
filter deletes it unread. Susan Joyce, who oper-
ates Job-Hunt.org (www.job-hunt.org)
offers these tips for getting your resume where
you want it to go:
 Do send e-mail to only one company at a
time. If your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
suspects you’re sending out a battalion of
messages, its computers may kill your work.
On the receiving end, filters may see a large
number of addressees as incoming spam
and eliminate your resume.
 Do look at the junk mail you get and avoid
using subject lines with exclamation points,
all capitals, or spam buzzwords, such as
“free,” “trial,” “cash,” or “great offer.” Even
appropriate phrases like “increased sales
$10,000 a month,” can trigger spam filters,
thanks to junk pitches such as “Make
$10,000 a month from home working part
time.” When you’re in doubt, try spelling out
dollar amounts.
 Don’t use too many numbers in your e-mail
address, such as jobseeker12635@yahoo.
com. Filter software may think the numbers
are a spammer’s tracking code.
 Send your resume to yourself and see
whether it lands in your junk filter bin. One
software expert runs every resume and
cover note through three spam filters on his
computer before e-mailing them.

“When employees’ resumes are found grazing in someone else’s pasture
before noon,” says CareerXroads’ Mark Mehler, who consults with countless
company managers, “they may be on the street by the end of that same day.”
Overexposure to recruiters
One more reason not to spread your resume all over the map: When you’re
targeting the fast track to the best jobs, nothing beats being brought to an
employer’s notice by an important third person — and an independent
recruiter qualifies as an important third person.
Employers are becoming resistant to paying independent recruiters big fees
to search the Web when they theoretically can save money by hiring in-house
corporate recruiters to do it. That’s why recruiting agencies need fresh inven-
tory that employers can’t find elsewhere. If you want a third-party recruiter
to represent you, think carefully before pinning cyber-wings on your resume.
In addition to losing control of your resume, its wide availability can cause
squabbles among contingency recruiters over who should be paid for finding
you. An employer caught in the conflict of receiving a resume from multiple
sources, including internal resume databases, will often pass over a potential
employee rather than become involved in deciding which source, if any,
should be paid.
Online Screening Keeps On Keepin’ On
Your OnTarget resume may never be read if an employer’s online screening
program decides in advance that you aren’t qualified for the position’s 
stated — or unstated — requirements. In essence, screening software has the
first word about who is admitted for a closer look and who isn’t.
Online screening is an automated process of creating a blueprint of known
requirements for a given job and then collecting information from each appli-
cant in a standardized manner to see whether the applicant matches the
blueprint. The outcomes are sent to recruiters and hiring managers.
Online screening is known by various terms — prescreening and pre-employment
screening, to mention two. By any name, the purpose of online screening is to
verify that you are, in fact, a good fit for the position and that you haven’t lied
about your background. Employers use online screening tools (tests, assess-
ment instruments, questionnaires, and so forth) to reduce and sort appli-
cants against criteria and competencies that are important to their
organizations.
69
Chapter 4: Familiar Search Tools That Haven’t Gone Away

If you apply online through major job sites or many company Web site career
portals, you may be asked to respond yes or no to job-related questions,
such as:
 Do you have the required college degree?
 Do you have experience with (specific job requirement)?
 Are you willing to relocate?
 Do you have two or more years’ experience managing a corporate com-
munications department?
 Is your salary requirement between $55,000–$60,000/year?
Answering “no” to any of these kinds of questions disqualifies you for the
listed position, an automated decision that helps the recruiters thin the herd
of resumes more quickly but that could be a distinct disadvantage to you, the
job searcher. (Without human interaction, you may not show enough of the
stated qualifications, but you may have compensatory qualifications that a
machine won’t allow you to communicate.)
On the other hand, professionals in shortage categories will benefit by a
quick response, such as nursing. Example: Are you an RN? If the answer is
“yes,” the immediate response, according to a recruiter’s joke, is “When can
you start?”
Sample components of online screening
The following examples of online screening aren’t exhaustive, but they are
illustrations of the most commonly encountered upfront filtering techniques.
 Basic evaluation: The system automatically evaluates the match
between a resume’s content (job seeker’s qualifications) and a job’s
requirement and ranks the most qualified resumes at the top.
 Skills and knowledge testing: The system uses tests that require appli-
cants to prove their knowledge and skills in a specific area of expertise.
Online skills and knowledge testing is especially prevalent in information
technology jobs where dealing with given computer programs is basic to
job performance. Like the old-time typing tests in an HR office, there’s
nothing subjective about this type of quiz: You know the answers, or 
you don’t.
 Personality assessment: Attempts to measure work-related personality
traits to predict job success is one of the more controversial types of
online testing. Dr. Wendell Williams, a leading testing expert based in the
Atlanta area, says that personality tests expressly designed for hiring 
are in a totally different league than tests designed to measure things
like communication style or personality type: “Job-related personality
70
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 

testing is highly job specific and tends to change with both task and
job,” he says. “If you are taking a generic personality test, a good rule is
to either pick answers that fall in the middle of the scale or ones you
think best fit the job description. This is not deception. Employers rarely
conduct studies of personality test scores versus job performance and
so it really does not make much difference.”
 Behavioral assessment: The system asks questions aimed at uncovering
your past experience applying core competencies the organization
requires (such as fostering teamwork, managing change) and position-
specific competencies (such as persuasion for sales, attention to detail
for accountants). I further describe competencies in Chapter 6.
 Managerial assessments: The system presents applicants with typical
managerial scenarios and asks them to react. Proponents say that man-
agerial assessments are effective for predicting performance on compe-
tencies, such as interpersonal skills, business acumen, and decision
making. Dr. Williams identifies the many forms these assessments can
take:
• In-basket exercises where the applicant is given an in-basket full of
problems and told to solve them.
• Analysis case studies where the applicant is asked to read a prob-
lem and recommend a solution.
• Planning case studies where the applicant is asked to read about a
problem and recommend a step-by-step solution.
• Interaction simulations where the applicant is asked to work out a
problem with a skilled role player.
• Presentation exercises where the applicant is asked to prepare,
deliver, and defend a presentation.
• Integrity tests measure your honesty with a series of questions.
You can probably spot the best answers without too much trouble.
Pros and cons of online screening
Here’s a snapshot of the advantages and disadvantages of online screening,
from the job seeker’s perspective:
 Advantages: In theory, a perfect online screening is totally job-based
and fair to all people with equal skills. Your resume would survive the
first cut based only on your ability to do well in the job. You also are
screened out of consideration for any job you may not be able to do,
saving yourself stress and keeping your track record free of false starts.
 Disadvantages: The creation of an online process is vulnerable to
human misjudgment; I’m still looking for an example of the perfect
online screening system. Moreover, you have no chance to “make up”
71
Chapter 4: Familiar Search Tools That Haven’t Gone Away

missing competencies or skills. (An analogy: You can read music, but
you don’t know how to play a specific song. You can learn it quickly, but
there’s no space to write “quick learner.”)
Can your resume be turned away?
What if you get low grades on answering the screening questions — can the
employer’s system tell you to take your resume and get lost? No, not legally.
Anyone can leave a resume, but if they don’t pass the screening, the resume
will be ranked at the bottom of the list in the database. 
The bottom line is that if you don’t score well in screening questions, your
resume will be exiled to an electronic no-hire zone even if it isn’t physically
turned away.
Match Your Resumes to the Jobs
Part I covers new Web 2.0 and surviving Web 1.0 online job search tools.
Knowing both the latest and the traditional methods is critical to move your
resumes along cyberways and byways that lead to interview offers. 
But never forget that to get past software filters, your resumes must spell out
your qualifications for the jobs’ requirements. If you’re parking your resumes
in an online database rather than responding to a specific job ad, make sure
they specify that you possess the most commonly requested requirements in
a given career field.
72
Part I: Pitching Your Resumes in a New Era Job Market 
Level playing field for salaries
When employers demand your salary require-
ments before they’ll schedule an interview, you
are at a disadvantage in negotiating strength.
But with hundreds of Web sites broadcasting
the compensation information supplied by a trio
of salary calculator services — Salary.com
(www.salary.com), Salary Expert (www.
salaryexpert.com), and PayScale (www.
payscale.com) — the tables are turning.
You can, with a few clicks, get a free ball-
park estimate of your market worth. For a fee
under $100, you can order a detailed report from
these salary-calculator services that pinpoint
your market value. Now, you become a more
informed and more equal partner in the negoti-
ation. If your market rate is $75,000/year and you
answer the question earlier in this section “Is
your salary requirement between $55,000 and
$60,000 per year?” you can answer “no” and
keep looking.

“Telling It” Mutes; “Selling It” Sings
Pretend you’re in the market for replacement windows in your home. Which
of the following two messages would better tweak your interest in taking a
closer look at the company?

The Turner Group has been in existence replacing windows for 30+ years at
the same easy-to-find showroom. We offer 25 different models and window
sizes — a choice to fit every home and budget.
The Turner Group has been assisting homeowners to protect their home
values with 25 models of high-quality replacement windows at discount
prices — and in all sizes — since the mid-1970s.
The first statement is an example of telling it; the message is “look at us!” The
second statement is an example of selling it, and its message is “here’s what
we can do for you.”
OnTarget resumes don’t tell it — they sell it! Dry, dull descriptions of what
you did on a job is as boring as video of a friend’s childhood birthday parties.
Instill excitement! List your background facts but make sure you position
them as end-user (employer) benefits.
One way to sell your value and your benefits to an employer who has the
power to hire you is to get specific. Communicate the importance of what
you’ve done by using details — numbers, names, achievements, outcomes,
volume of sales or savings, and size of contracts, for example.
Remember, when you sell it, you breathe life into a rigid, dreary, boring, and
generally coma-inducing document. Here are several examples of the sell-it

Other chapters of this book clue you in on more techniques of approaching
your resume with a sell-it mindset, the starting gate of today’s high-stakes
resume derby. In the classic film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Butch
Cassidy tells Sundance: “You have vision but the rest of the world wears 
bifocals.” Help employers see not only what you were responsible for but
how well you did it and why it mattered.
Focus Your Resume
Too many jobs in your background threaten your focus. Unfocused is an ugly
word in job-search circles, one that indicates you lack commitment, that
you’re perpetually at a fork in the road. It’s a reason not to hire you.
When your resume looks as though it will collapse under the weight of a
mishmash of jobs unconnected to your present target, eliminate your previ-
ous trivial pursuits. Group the consequential jobs under a heading that 
says Relevant Work Experience Summary. What if this approach solves one
problem — the busy resume — but creates another, such as a huge, gaping
black hole where you removed inconsequential jobs? Create a second work
history section that covers those holes, labeling it Other Experience. Fig-
ure 5-1 shows an example.
Dealing with an unfocused career pattern on paper is easier when it’s done
under the banner of a temporary service company. The treatment in this case
lists the temporary services company as the employer. You choose one job
title that covers most of your assignments. Under that umbrella title, identify
specific assignments. Give the dates in years next to the temporary services
firm, skipping dates for each assignment. Figure 5-2 shows an example.
What if you work for several temporary services at the same time? The
simple answer is that you use the same technique of dating your work his-
tory for the temporary service firms, not for the individual assignments. This
dating technique is a statement of fact; you legally are an employee of the
temporary services firm, not of the company that pays for your temporary
services.
When excess jobs or focus isn’t a problem, you may choose an alternative
presentation for a series of short-term jobs, as I show you in Chapter 4. The
alternative doesn’t mention the staffing firm(s) but only the names of the
companies where you worked.

Resume Formats Make a Difference
Resume format refers not to the design or look of your resume but to how you
organize and emphasize your information. Different format styles flatter dif-
ferent histories.
At root, formats come in three family trees: 
 The reverse chronological lists all employment and education, beginning
with the most recent and working backward.
 The skills-based functional shouts what you can do instead of relaying
what you’ve done and where you did it.
 The hybrid or combination is a marriage of both formats.
Note: The narrative format is an outdated chronological format that starts
with the oldest facts and works forward to the newest facts. A pretentious
variation of the narrative format uses the third person as though you were
writing a biography. I don’t bother to even discuss them, and I strongly sug-
gest that you don’t use either one.
These basic styles have spawned a variety of other formats, the best known
of which are these:
 Professional
 Academic curriculum vitae
 International curriculum vitae
Table 5-1 gives you a breakdown of which format to use when.

The following sections explore each type of resume format so that you can
choose the style best for you and your skills.
Reverse Chronological Format
The reverse chronological (RC) format, shown in Figure 5-3, is straightforward:
It cites your employments from the most recent back, showing dates as well
as employers and educational institutions (college, vocational-technical
schools, and career-oriented programs and courses). You accent a steady
work history with a clear pattern of upward or lateral mobility.
Strengths and weaknesses
Check to see whether the reverse chronological resume’s strengths are
yours:
 This upfront format is by far the most popular with employers and
recruiters because it is so, well, upfront.
 RC links employment dates, underscoring continuity. The weight of your
experience confirms that you’re a specialist in a specific career field
(social service or technology, for example).
 RC positions you for the next upward career step.
 As the most traditional of formats, RC fits traditional industries (such as
banking, education, and accounting).
81
Chapter 5: Creating Your Best Resume

Take the weaknesses of the reverse chronological format into account: 
 When your previous job titles are substantially different from your target
position, this format doesn’t support your objective. Without careful
management, the RC reveals everything, including inconsequential jobs
and negative factors.
 RC can spotlight periods of unemployment or brief job tenure.
 Without careful management, RC reveals your age.
 Without careful management, RC may suggest that you were plateaued
in a job too long.
Who should use this format and
who should think twice
Use the reverse chronological if you fall into any of these categories:
 You have a steady school and work record reflecting constant growth or
lateral movement.
 Your most recent employer is a respected name in the industry, and the
name may ease your entry into a new position.
 Your most recent job titles are impressive stepping stones.
 You’re a savvy writer who knows how to manage potential negative fac-
tors, such as inconsequential jobs, too few jobs, too many temporary
jobs, too many years at the same job, or too many years of age.
Think twice about using the RC under these circumstances:
 You have a lean employment history. Listing a stray student job or two is
not persuasive, even when you open with superb educational creden-
tials enhanced with internships and co-op experiences.
With careful attention, you can do a credible job on an RC by extracting
from your extracurricular activities every shred of skills, which you pre-
sent as abilities to do work with extraordinary commitment and a head
for quick learning.
 You have work-history or employability problems — gaps, demotions,
stagnation in a single position, job hopping (four jobs in three years, for
example), reentering the workforce after a break to raise a family.
Exercise very careful management to truthfully modify stark realities.
However, you may find that other formats can serve you better.

Chapter 5: Creating Your Best Resume

Creating a reverse chronological resume
To create an OnTarget RC resume, remember to
 Focus on areas of specific relevance to your target position.
 List all pertinent places you’ve worked, including for each the name of the
employer and the city in which you worked, the years you were there,
your title, your responsibilities, and your measurable achievements.
To handle problems such as unrelated experience, you can group unrelated
jobs in a second work history section under a heading of Other Experience,
or Previous Experience, or Related Experience. I tell you more about handling
special circumstances in Chapter 9.
Functional Format
The functional format, shown in Figure 5-4, is a resume of ability-focused
topics — portable skills or functional areas. It ignores chronological order. 
In its purest form, the functional style omits dates, employers, and job 
titles. But, employers don’t like it when you leave out the particulars, so con-
temporary functional resumes list employers, job titles, and sometimes even
dates — but still downplay this information by briefly listing it at the bottom
of the resume. The functional format is oriented toward what the job seeker
can do for the employer instead of narrating history.
Strengths and weaknesses
The following are the strengths of the functional format:
 A functional resume directs a reader’s eyes to what you want him or her
to notice. It helps a reader visualize what you can do instead of when
and where you learned to do it. Functional resumes salute the future
rather than embalm the past.
 The functional format — written after researching the target company —
serves up the precise functions or skills that the employer wants. It’s
like saying, “You want budget control and turnaround skills — I have
budget control and turnaround skills.” The skills sell is a magnet to
reader eyes!
84
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

 It uses unpaid and nonwork experience to your best advantage.
 It allows you to eliminate or subordinate work history that doesn’t sup-
port your current objective.
Weaknesses of the functional format include the following:
 Because recruiters and employers are more accustomed to RC formats,
departing from the norm may raise suspicion that you’re not the cream
of the crop of applicants. Readers may assume that you’re trying to hide
inadequate experience, educational deficits, or who knows what.
 Functional styles may leave unclear which skills grew from which jobs or
experiences.
 This style doesn’t make a clear career path obvious.
 This format doesn’t maximize recent coups in the job market.
Who should use this format and
who should think twice
This resume is heaven-sent for career changers, new graduates, ex-military
personnel, seasoned aces, and individuals with multitrack job histories,
work-history gaps, or special-issue problems.
Job seekers with blue-ribbon backgrounds and managers and professionals
who are often tapped by executive recruiters should avoid this format.
Creating a functional resume
Choose areas of expertise acquired during the course of your career, includ-
ing education and unpaid activities. These areas become skill and functional
headings, which vary by the target position or career field. Note any achieve-
ments below each heading. A few examples of headings are: Management,
Sales, Budget Control, Cost Cutting, Project Implementation, and Turnaround
Successes.
List the headings in the order of importance and follow each heading with a
series of short statements of your skills (shown in Figure 5-4). Turn your
statements into power hitters with measurable achievements.

Hybrid Format
The hybrid, a combination of reverse chronological and functional formats,
satisfies demands for timelines as well as showcases your marketable skills
and impressive accomplishments. Many people find the hybrid to be the
most attractive of all formats.
Essentially, in a hybrid, a functional summary tops a reverse chronological
presentation of dates, employers, and capsules of each position’s duties.
Figure 5-5 gives you a template for this format.
Strengths and weaknesses
A hybrid format combines the strengths of both the reverse chronological
and functional formats, so check out those earlier sections. Its weakness is
that, like a functional resume, it departs from the straightforward reverse
chronological format that a very conservative employer may prefer.
Who should use this format and 
who should think twice
The hybrid is a wise choice for rookies, ex-military personnel, seasoned aces,
those with job history gaps or a multitrack job history, and individuals with
special-issue problems.
The hybrid style is similar to the contemporary functional format — so much
so that making a case for distinction is sometimes difficult.
Career changers or job seekers needing more appropriate formats, such as
the functional, should skip the hybrid.
Creating a hybrid resume
Build a functional format of ability-focused topics and add employment 
documentation — employers, locations, dates, and duties.

Professional Format
A professional format, also called a professional vitae or professional CV is
slightly long winded (say, three to five pages) but factual. It emphasizes pro-
fessional qualifications and activities. This format, shown in Figure 5-6, is
essentially a shortened academic curriculum vitae.
Strengths and weaknesses
The professional resume is mandatory for certain kinds of positions; your
choice is whether to send this type or go all the way and send an academic
curriculum vitae.
But be aware that professional resumes are reviewed under a microscope;
every deficiency stands out. Adding a portfolio that shows your experience-
based work skills may compensate for missing chunks of formal require-
ments. Just make sure that any unsolicited samples you send are high quality
and need no explanation.
Who should use this format and 
who should think twice
Professionals in medicine, science, and law should use this format. Also use it
when common sense of convention makes it the logical choice, as when
you’re applying for a leadership civil service appointment in government.
For most nonprofessionals, especially managers, the professional format is
tedious.
Creating a professional resume
Begin with education, professional training, and an objective. Follow with a
summary of the main points you want the reader to absorb. Follow that infor-
mation with details of your professional experience and accomplishments.

Follow the template in Figure 5-6, paying attention to accomplishments. Just
because you present yourself in a low-key, authoritative manner doesn’t
mean that you can forget to say how good you are.
Academic Curriculum Vitae
The academic curriculum vitae (CV) is a comprehensive biographical state-
ment, typically three to ten pages, emphasizing professional qualifications
and activities. A CV of six to eight pages, ten at the most, is recommended for
a veteran professional; two to four pages is appropriate for a young profes-
sional just starting out (see the “Professional Format” section earlier in this
chapter).
If your CV is more than four pages long, show mercy and save eyesight by
attaching an executive summary page to the top. An executive summary gives
a brief overview of your qualifications and experience.
Among various possible organizations, the template in Figure 5-7 (a variation
of the hybrid format but with exhaustive coverage) illustrates a lineup of
your contact information, objective, qualifications summary, skills summary,
and professional background.
Strengths and weaknesses
A CV presents all the best of you, which is good, but for people with aging
eyes, a CV may be too reading-intensive. More important, weaknesses in any
area of your professional credentials are relatively easy to spot.
Who should use this format 
and who should think twice
Anyone working in a PhD-driven environment, such as higher education,
think tanks, science, and elite research and development groups needs to use
this format.
Anyone who can avoid using it should do so.

credentials, dissertation title, fields in which comprehensive examinations
were passed, full citations of publications and presentations, awards, discov-
eries, inventions, patents, seminar leadership, foreign languages, courses
taught — whatever is valued in your field.
International Curriculum Vitae Format
The international CV is not the same document as an academic CV. Think of
an international CV as a six- to eight-page excruciatingly detailed resume
(Figure 5-8 gives you a template). Although it solicits private information
that’s outlawed in the United States, such as your health status, the interna-
tional CV is favored in some nations as a kind of global ticket to employment.
The international CV is usually a reverse chronological format that includes
your contact information, qualifications summary, professional background,
education, and personal information. Some European countries prefer the
chronological format, which lists education and work experience from the
farthest back to the present.
Americans should remember that when working overseas for a native
employer, they are not protected by Equal Employment Opportunity laws.
Strengths and weaknesses
International employment experts say that if you don’t use this format, for-
eign recruiters may think you’re hiding something. But keep in mind that the
international CV format intrudes into private areas of your life.
Who should use this format and 
who should think twice
Use this format if you’re seeking an overseas job and don’t object to revealing
information that may subject you to discriminatory hiring practices.
Individuals who feel strongly about invasions of privacy or fear or identity
theft or who aren’t willing to be rejected out of hand because of gender, 
religion, race, age, or marital status should avoid this format.

Of course, if you want an overseas job and you don’t use this format, you
may be out of luck unless you’re working through an American recruiter. The
recruiter can interpret your concerns and negotiate for a bare minimum of
personal information. Nationals of countries other than the United States can
also use this technique.
Creating an international curriculum vitae
Formality prevails with the international CV. England has a suggested CV
form, which is more like the American resume than not.
 If you’re applying in a non-English-speaking country, have your CV trans-
lated into the appropriate foreign language. Send both the English and
the native-language version.
 Unless it’s untrue, mention in the personal section that you have excel-
lent health.
 Suggest by appropriate hobbies and personal interests that you’ll easily
adapt to an overseas environment.
 If you’re submitting your international CV on paper, handwrite the cover
letter that goes with it — Europeans use handwriting analysis as a
screening device. If your handwriting is iffy, enclose a word-processed
version as well.
In addition, make sure that your cover letter shows a sincere desire to be in
the country of choice.
Other Resume Presentations
A few adventuresome job seekers are using newer resume formats, develop-
ing distribution technology and imaginative styles of communication. Take a
quick look at possibilities that can’t be classified as mainstream methods but
may be just the vehicle you need to find the job you want.
Variations on a theme
Among mutations of the three basic formats (reverse chronological, func-
tional, and hybrid) are the following.
97
Chapter 5: Creating Your Best Resume

Accomplishment format
A variation of the hybrid resume, the accomplishment format shows both
qualifications and accomplishments. One sequencing frequently used by
executives in mobile industries — such as advertising, communications, and
publishing — data starts with name and contact information, followed by an
objective. This is followed by bullet points under headings of qualifications,
skills, and accomplishments. The resume concludes with professional experi-
ence and education.
The accomplishment format is a popular favorite of job seekers returning to
payroll status after a period of self-employment.
Linear format
A linear format flows one line at a time. It relates achievements, winning
moves, and star points in short, quick spurts and is designed to attract and
tease the eyes of busy readers (which means most businesspeople). The
linear hallmarks: very little detail, super attention to sizzle (hyped but prov-
able achievements), not much depth, and lots and lots of white space. The
linear format doesn’t use an objective but opens with a skills summary. It
showcases a robust career progression and in a skilled writer’s hands can be
very effective.
Keyword format
All formats should be heavily sprinkled with keywords — nouns identifying
your qualifications that employers use to search resume databases (see
Chapter 7).
Until the turn of the century, keyword resume formats were popular. This
format placed a profile of keywords (really a skills summary) at the top of a
document. The keywords were front-loaded because the resume-reading 
software of the time could absorb only a fixed amount of information, and
resume writers wanted to get their keyword licks in before the software hit 
its limit. Today the software has much improved and can pick up keywords
anywhere in a resume. (See Chapter 7 to find out about keywords.)
When you use industry abbreviations (for example, “ROI”), spell out the term
at least once in your resume. Even though many systems are smarter than
they used to be, a lot of older technology products out there won’t “get it”
unless you spell out “return on investment.”
98
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Resume letters
When you’re doing a targeted mailing campaign, a resume letter attracts
attention because it reads more like a story than a document. The resume
letter is a combination of cover letter and resume; often it is two pages. It typ-
ically opens with a variation of the question: “Are you looking for a profes-
sional who can leap high buildings in a single bound?” A resume letter
opening might look a little something like this:
Should you be in the market for an accomplished, congenial senior human
resources specialist who has earned an excellent reputation for successful
HR technology acquisition analysis and management, this letter will be of
interest to you.
The letter continues on to give a basic overview of a job seeker’s strengths,
including previous employers, achievements, skills and competencies, as
they would apply to the recipient company.
Even though you’ll use postal mail to send a resume letter and have no way
of knowing whether you fall under Internet Candidate rules (see Chapter 1),
take care to discover the key qualifications most often required for the posi-
tion you seek. Targeting is a no-lose strategy even for cold mailings.
Your strengths message may be in paragraph form or in bulleted statements.
The resume letter format can be especially useful for a professional with an
abundance of experience. But don’t substitute a resume letter when you’re
responding to a job advertisement that asks for a resume. The employer calls
the shots.
One of the most amazing placements I’ve ever heard about was the case of
the chemist who at age 50 left the profession to take a fling dealing cards at 
a casino. Five years later, at age 55, he wanted to return to the chemistry
workplace. A cold mailing of a well-written resume letter to owners of small
chemical companies turned up a caretaker CEO job while the owner took an
extended two-year trip out of the country. 
Portfolios
Samples of your work, gathered in a portfolio, have long been valuable to
fields such as design, graphics, photography, architecture, advertising, public
relations, marketing, education, and contracting.
99
Chapter 5: Creating Your Best Resume

Often, you deliver your portfolio as part of the job interview. Some highly
motivated job seekers include a brief version of a career portfolio when send-
ing their resumes, although recruiters say that they want fewer, not more,
resume parts to deal with. If you must include work samples to back up your
claims, send only a few of your very best. The portfolio is a showcase for doc-
umenting a far more complete picture of what you offer employers than is pos-
sible with a resume of one or two pages. Getting recruiters to read it is the
problem. When you determine that a portfolio is your best bet, take it to job
interviews. Put your portfolio in a three-ring binder with a table of contents
and tabs separating its various parts. Mix and match the following categories:
 Career goals (if you’re a new graduate or career changer): A brief state-
ment of less than one page is plenty.
 Your resume: Use a fully formatted version in MS Word.
 Samples of your work: Include easily understandable examples of prob-
lem solving and competencies.
 Proof of performance: Insert awards, honors, testimonials and letters of
commendation, and flattering performance reviews. Don’t forget to add
praise from employers, people who reported to you, and customers.
 Proof of recognition: Here’s where you attach certifications, transcripts,
degrees, licenses, and printed material listing you as the leader of semi-
nars and workshops. Omit those that you merely attended unless the
attendance proves something.
 Military connections: The U.S. military provides exceptionally good
training, and many employers know it. List military records, awards, and
badges.
Make at least two copies of your portfolio in case potential employers decide
to hold on to your samples or fail to return them.
Your portfolio should document only the skills that you want to apply on a
job. Begin by identifying those skills, and then determine which materials
prove your claims of competency.
Video resumes
A video resume (or video podcast) actually is a canned video interview in
which a candidate speaks about her qualifications, goals, and strengths.
Employers shy away from video resumes because they fear a candidate’s
image and sound could bring discrimination charges against them by old,
minority, fat, or ugly candidates. 
100
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Web resumes
Web resumes (or e-portfolio or HTML resumes) are electronic documents that
you post on a personal Web site. The format may simply display credentials,
or it may go glamorous with links to sound and graphics of your work sam-
ples. Job seekers in cutting-edge technology fields, theater, marketing, and
design are attracted to the presentation.
Multimedia resumes
Multimedia resumes are similar to Web resumes, but they’re on a disk that
can be sent by postal mail. An attention-getting novelty in the 1990s, they’re
rarely used today.
Choose What Works for You
The big closing question to ask yourself when you’ve settled on a format is:
Does this format maximize my qualifications for the job I want?
If the format you’ve chosen doesn’t promote your top qualifications, take
another look at the choices in this chapter to select a format that helps you
paint a sparkling self-portrait.

qualifications (see Chapter 1), what your resume says is mission-critical.
The Parts of Your Resume
To make your contents easy to access, organize the facts into various cate-
gories. Here are the essential parts that make up a resume:
 Contact information
 Objective or summary statement
 Education and training
 Experience

 Skills
 Competencies
 Activities
 Organizations
 Honors and awards
You may also include:
 Licenses
 Work samples
 Testimonials
To increase the likelihood that your resume will position you for an interview,
take the time to understand the purpose of the different resume parts, which
I explain in the following sections.
No more than you want to carry around 30 pounds of extra weight do you
want fat in your resume — family, early education, favorite things, and so
forth. Trim it! The rule for including data on a resume is simple: If the data
doesn’t support your objective to be invited for an interview, leave it out.
Leading with Contact Information
Include on your resume the following information, in the following order:
 Name: No matter which format you choose, place your name first on
your resume. If your name isn’t first, a job computer may mistake
Excellent Sales Representative for your name and file you away as Ms.
Representative. You may want to display your name in slightly larger
type than the rest of the contact information and in boldface.
 Mailing address: Some resume advisers say the need to give a street
address is no longer valid. The theory is that stating city and state is
adequate in view of today’s concerns about personal privacy and iden-
tity theft. At first thought, the omission of a street address seems rea-
sonable. Why not save the space for information that markets you?
Not so fast. This book’s technical reviewer, Jim Lemke, points out that 
if you apply to a company career site and are asked to upload or paste
your resume in a window, the odds are 99 percent that you’re being
entered into an applicant tracking system, also called a candidate 
104
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

management system or applicant management system. By any name, an
ATS is a software application designed to help a company recruit
employees more efficiently. At minimum, an ATS usually includes fea-
tures to post job openings online, screen resumes, acknowledge receipt
of resumes, and generate interview requests by e-mail to potential hires.
ATS systems check your e-mail address and sometimes your physical
address to look for duplicates. If you leave off your physical address, the
system may not accept your resume, or if it does, you may not receive
an acknowledgment if the company sends acknowledgment communica-
tions by postal mail.
Unless there’s a reason to hide your physical location, which you could
do with a mail box address, continue to give a street name with the unit
number, city, state, and zip code.
If you’re a college student or member of the military who’ll be returning
home, give both addresses, labeled Current Address and Permanent
Address. You can add operational dates for each address, but don’t
forget to delete a date after it’s passed. Otherwise, you look like a prod-
uct whose shelf date has passed.
 Valid telephone number: Use a personal phone number, including the
area code, where you can be reached or where the recruiter can leave a
message.
Don’t allow children to answer this line. Don’t record a clever 
message — play it straight. If you must share a telephone with kids,
emphasize the need for them to answer the phone professionally and to
keep their calls short. In addition to — or instead of — a landline, give
your mobile (cell) telephone number.
 Other contact media: Also give your e-mail address, and, if you have
one, your Web page address.
What about using company resources? Should you ever use your employer’s
e-mail address or letterhead? Many employers see an employee’s use of com-
pany resources to find another job as small-time theft.
In certain situations, however, you can use your company’s help. For exam-
ple, when a company is downsizing, it’s expected to provide resource sup-
port for outplacement. Contract employment is another exception: When
you’re ending the project for which you were hired, your employer may
encourage you to use company resources. Indicate permission to use them in
your resume’s cover letter: The project for which I was hired is finishing ahead
of schedule; my grateful employer is cooperating in my new search.
105
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference

Is it okay to list your work telephone number on your resume? In a decade
when employers have been tossing workers out without remorse, it’s a tough
world and you need speedy communications. The practical answer is to list
your work number if you have a direct line and voice mail or a mobile phone.
To show that you’re an ethical person, limit calls to a couple minutes — just
long enough to arrange a meeting or an evening callback. Avoid the issue by
carrying your personal mobile phone to work and calling back on breaks.
Hooking the Reader with 
a Summary or Objective
Your OnTarget resume needs a hook to grab attention. The hook immediately
follows your name and contact information and is expressed as an objective
or as a summary.
A summary is known by many names. Among the most popular are skills
summary, highlights summary, asset statement, power summary, career high-
lights, career summary, career profile, career focus, summary of qualifica-
tions, and accomplishments profile.
The two types of hooks — objective and summary — differ in emphasis. 
The objective is self-centered, stating what you want; the summary is work-
centered, stating what you offer. Sometimes the job objective and summary
are combined. Here are examples of the various approaches:
Objective: Assistant to Executive
Summary: Over 14 years of progressively responsible office support
experience, including superior computer skills, with an earned reputation
for priority-setting and teamwork.
And here’s how an unlabeled combined objective and summary might look:
Assistant to Executive, to keep operations under firmer control, using
computer skills, contemporary office procedures, and pleasant manner
with people.
However you fashion it, the hook tells the recruiter what you want to do and/
or what you’re qualified to do.
Debate rages among career pros over the topic of objective versus summary.
 Objective backers say that readers don’t want to slog through a docu-
ment, trying to guess the type of position you want and how you’d fit
into the organization.
106
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

 Summary advocates argue that a thumbnail sketch of your skills and
other competencies allows your qualifications to be evaluated for jobs
you may not know about specifically, or offers an easy way to itemize
your matching qualifications for a specific job’s requirements. This
factor is a serious consideration in a New Era of resume database
searches.
Focus (Chapter 5) will speed your resume to the eyes of people who can 
hire you, whether you style it as a job objective or as a summary — or as an
unlabeled combination of both.
Choosing an objective
Your objective states what you want to do and the direction in which you’re
heading. It gives immediate focus to your resume and is the hub around
which all the other information in your document relates.
When to use an objective
The time is right to use an objective under these conditions:
 You know the position being offered; make that job title your job 
objective.
 You have a greatly diversified background that may perplex some
employers.
 You’re a new graduate, a career changer, a service member exiting the
military, a member of the clergy switching to the secular job market, an
educator seeking another career field, or a homemaker reentering the
paid workforce. A job objective says what you’re looking for.
Advantages of an objective
Most studies show that employers prefer objectives for quick identification
purposes. They like to see the name of their job openings at the top of a
resume. Because you cite those qualifying achievements that support your
objective and forget random experiences, the finished product (when done
well) shows that you and the desired job appear to be a well-matched pair.
If you’re responding to an advertised job, remember to match the basic quali-
fications it requires in the body of your resume (Chapter 1) even if the job
seeks a “window pane technician” and your objective says “window pane
technician.” An objective that echoes the job title in the job ad is merely a
first step in showing that you’re a great match.
107
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference

Disadvantages of an objective
Ideally, you will write a customized resume for each position (or career field)
for which you apply. You may even write a customized resume for each posi-
tion for which you apply at the same company. The downside to a narrow job
objective is that you may not be considered by the same employer for other
open positions that you didn’t know about. But if the objective is too broadly
focused, your objective statement becomes meaningless.
Opting for a summary
If you choose to begin your resume with a summary, you can still target it to
specific positions with the mix of strengths, skills, accomplishments, and
other background elements that you include.
When to use a summary
The time is right to use a summary under these conditions:
 You’re a person with widely applicable skills. Recruiters especially like a
skills summary atop a reverse chronological resume because it lets them
creatively consider you for jobs that you may not know exist.
 You’re in a career field with pathways to multiple occupations or indus-
tries (an administrative assistant, for example).
108
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
Being objective about objectives
The debate over job objective or a variant of a
skills summary continues unabated. I overheard
these snatches of recruiters’ opinions at a
recruiting forum.
 “By including their desired job title in the
online objective statement, job seekers
increase the chances that their resume will
match an employer’s search string.”
 “I prefer to see ‘Career Summary’ in place
of ‘Objective’. If the objective doesn’t match
an employer’s idea of the job, the resume
will probably be discarded. By putting a
one-paragraph ‘commercial’ as the very
first thing the employer sees, you know that
an overview of your qualifications is read.”
 “As an in-house [corporate] recruiter, any
resume I receive without an objective tells
me the applicant is either a desperate jack-
of-all trades who will take any job offered,
or has not thought about his career enough
to know what he wants. Both are huge red
flags. I think an objective is essential.”
 “We advise candidates to leave off the
objective or we may remove it before send-
ing to a client. Use the objective space to
include more information on accomplish-
ments and experience.”

 You know that your resume is headed to an e-database. Because you
want to be considered for multiple related positions — which may have
the same or similar requirements — you try to design your summary
broadly enough to accomplish this goal without sounding as though
you’re a jack-of-all-trades.
109
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference
Soar with a summary
Accomplishments are the patron saints of
OnTarget resumes. Part III contains sample
resumes that illustrate a variety of effective sum-
maries. But here’s a quick peek at a top-rated
summary by Jan Melnik in Executive’s Pocket
Guide to ROI Resumes and Job Search by
Louise Kursmrak and Jan Melnik (JIST
Publishing).
Senior Marketing Executive
Providing Consistent Market Leadership to Leverage Exceptional Marketing & Sales Results
Outstanding record of highly focused, strategic marketing and sales leadership. Exceptional 
executive-leadership skills with talent for establishing and communicating vision, developing 
strategy, executing tactical plans, and motivating and empowering teams and individuals to achieve 
remarkable, sustainable results.
Demonstrated Strengths...
•  Profit & Performance Improvement  
•  Sales & Marketing Strategy/Execution
•  New Business Development
•  Team Leadership/Motivation
•  Collaboration/Teamwork
•  Customer/Channel Expertise
•  Strategic Planning
•  Results Orientation
•  Brand Repositioning
• Achieved rapid speed-to-market in successful product launches through hands-on leadership 
 
of brand and product development, strategic planning, packaging, marketing, and innovative 
 
distribution channels.
• Reputation for consistently creating value and delivering strong sales results.
• Precision focus on identifying and capitalizing on new business opportunities to generate 
 
profitable and sustainable growth.
A summary typically contains the three to five
skills and competencies — sometimes more —
that best support your job aspiration. The data in
your statement need not be proven with exam-
ples in this brief section; for now it stands alone
as assertions. In effect, you’re saying, “Here’s
who I am. Here’s what I can do for you.” The sum-
mary is a tease, encouraging the reader to hang
in there for proof of what the opening claims.
An exciting summary can revive a fading job
achievement. Suppose you have an achieve-
ment that took place four or five years ago and is
now needed to qualify you for a job. In a focused
summary, the golden oldie achievement still sells
for you as though it happened yesterday.

Advantages of a summary
Recruiters believe that what you’re prepared to do next should be pretty evi-
dent from what you’ve already done. Another argument is premised on psy-
chology: Employers aren’t known for being overly concerned with what you
want from them until they’re sure of what you can do for them.
Summaries offer an easy way to identify the qualifications you have that
match a particular job’s requirements. Or identify qualifications that position
you for related positions unknown to you in a given career field.
Disadvantages of a summary
A summary doesn’t explicitly say what you want and why the employer
would want you. The summary resume can backfire if it claims everything
from soup to nuts yet misses the targets identified by employers for specific
positions.
Making Education, Experience, Skills,
and Competencies Work for You
When you begin drafting your core resume (see Chapter 1), carefully con-
sider the following four categories of essential information.
Education
List your highest degree first — type of degree, major, college name, and date
awarded.
110
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
What’s first — education or experience?
The general rule in resume writing is to lead
with your most qualifying factor.
With certain exceptions (such as law, where
your choice of alma mater can dog you through-
out life), lead off with experience when you’ve
been in the workforce for at least one year.
When you’re loaded with experience but low on
credentials, list your school days at the end —
and perhaps even omit them entirely if you
didn’t graduate.

 New graduates give far more detail on course work than do graduates
who’ve held at least one post-graduation job for one year or more.
 Omit high school or prep school if you have a college degree.
 If you have a vocational-technical school certificate or diploma that
required less than a year to obtain, list your high school as well.
 Note continuing education, including seminars related to your work.
 If you fall short of the mark on the job’s educational requirements, try to
compensate by expanding the continuing education section. Give the list
a name, such as Professional Development Highlights, and list every
impressive course, seminar, workshop, and conference that you’ve
attended.
Experience
Describe — with quantified achievements — your present and previous posi-
tions in reverse chronological order. Include specific job titles, company
names and locations, and dates of employment. Show progression and pro-
motions within an organization, especially if you’ve been with one employer
for eons.
Consider using more than one Experience heading. Try headings such as
Accounting and Finance-Related Experience, General Business Experience, and
Healthcare and Administration Experience. Doing so is yet another way of 
reinforcing your qualifications for the job you seek.
Skills
Skills today are the heart and soul of job finding and, as such, encompass a
variety of experiences. These are skills:
Collaborating, editing, fundraising, interviewing, managing, blogging
(Internet), researching, systematizing, teaching
And these are skills:
Administering social programs, analyzing insurance facts, advising home-
less people, allocating forestry resources, desktop publishing, coordinat-
ing association events, designing home furnishing ads, marine expedition
problem-solving, writing police reports, updating Web sites
111
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference

And these are also skills:
Dependable, sense of humor, commitment, leadership, persistence, crisis-
resilient, adaptable, quick, results-driven
And these are still more skills:
Brochures, Java, five years, 100% quota, telemarketing, senior manage-
ment, spreadsheet, MBA, major accounting firm. Skills used to be thought
of in the classic meaning of general and industry-specific abilities.
Recruiting industry professionals expand the term to include personal
characteristics as well as past employers, special knowledge, achieve-
ments, and products.
A skill, in job-search terms, is any identifiable ability or fact that employers
value and will pay for. That means that “five years” is a skill, just as “word
processing” is a skill; employers pay for experience.
Where do skills belong on your resume? Everywhere. Season every statement
with skills. Skills are indispensable. Whether you use an e-resume or a tradi-
tional paper resume, you must name your skills or be left behind.
What’s the easiest way to name your skills? You can ask at a library for books
with comprehensive skills information suitable for adults, such as Career
Success: A Step-By-Step Workbook for Students, Job Seekers and Lifelong
Learners, by Urban Whitaker (O’Brien and Whitaker Publishers). Additionally,
you can use Google (www.google.com) to find free online presentations of
skills. Search on terms such as transferable skills checklist, job skills list, and
uncovering your skills.
112
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
Top accomplishments
The accomplishments that most interest employ-
ers include:
 Increased revenues
 Saved money
 Increased efficiency
 Cut overhead
 Increased sales
 Improved workplace safety
 Purchasing accomplishments
 New products/new lines
 Improved record-keeping process
 Increased productivity
 Successful advertising campaign
 Effective budgeting

Skills are one part of the concept of competencies, which I discuss next.
Competencies
Controversy swirls around the concept of competency-based hiring models
used in employee selection.
A competency-based approach is a method that focuses on the skills and tal-
ents needed to be able to perform a particular task to a certain standard. The
method uses a series of assessment tools (tests) that identify not only the
technical skills a candidate possesses, but the candidate’s behavioral compe-
tencies as well. Competency-based models can be broken down into two 
categories:
 Work-based competencies. These include the job-specific characteris-
tics, skills, and abilities, such as fluency in the Spanish language or the
ability to work with Microsoft Word.
 Behavior-based competencies. These are personal characteristics, such
as interpersonal skills, attitudes, and motivation.
Although competency-based hiring models became popular in the United
States a decade ago, they are in use chiefly by larger, sophisticated employ-
ers. Not everyone is on board with the same concept. In fact, competencies
are known by a variety of terms, such as key characteristics that it takes to be
successful, success factors, attributes, and so on. 
Viewpoints also differ about whether the competency-based hiring model has
crashed and burned and is headed behind yesterday’s hill along with no-
longer-popular concepts, such as quality circles. One noted employment
researcher says, “Almost every major competency project we have witnessed
has ended in failure, usually right around the three-year mark at a cost of mil-
lions of dollars.”
Other employment experts say that’s crazy Mark Twain talk — the author
famously said, “The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”
Competency advocates insist that key characteristics live and thrive. As one
recruiting leader said: “Look at evidence all around us. Read a few job listings
on major job boards and you’ll see that most companies still reference spe-
cific behavioral competencies as being important to job success and to the
selection of high-performing candidates.”
113
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference

My take: If you’re aiming for a job with a large employer, bone up on compe-
tency policy at each company. You can call the company’s human resource
department and ask, “Do you use a competencies model in recruiting?” If so,
ask whether you can obtain a lexicon of the company’s core competencies and
the role competencies for the target position. Sometimes, the HR specialist
will reveal the competencies and sometimes not. But you’re missing a bet if
you don’t ask.
If the company uses the competencies model, note your measurable accom-
plishments, and then add your personal behavioral competencies that made
them possible.
A few examples of core competencies 
A competency is a set of characteristics that produces superior performance.
It includes knowledge, the things we know. It includes skills, the things we
can do. It includes attitudes, how we do things. Each of us has multiple com-
petencies; each job requires multiple competencies.
Competencies do not come in a handy-dandy, one-size-fits-all package. They
vary from industry to industry, and from company to company.
The following very simple illustration of four competencies illustrates those a
company might use for a technical sales representative.
114
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
Competencies vs. keywords
Don’t confuse competencies with typical key-
words employers use to search through data-
bases for suitable candidates. Developing
competencies for your target position and field
(Chapter 1) makes sense because it concen-
trates your mind on the position you seek.
Competencies statements don’t make good key-
words, and the company won’t uncover your
resume based on your behavioral competen-
cies. So why do it? Accomplishment and skill
keywords initially snag the interviewer’s atten-
tion, but when he or she keeps reading and sees
that you’ve also included competencies state-
ments, the interviewer will note that there’s no
moss hanging from your hair and that you
understand the competency model. This sophis-
tication will be a plus for interviewing purposes.

Where can you find lists of more competencies? In addition to company Web
sites and books (Competency-Based Resumes (2005) and Competency-Based
Interviews (2006), both by Robin Keesler and Linda Strasburg; Career Press),
look at competitors’ job ads and professional association Web sites.
Including competencies in your resumes
Most good resumes focus on knowledge, skills, and accomplishments. They
only hint at competencies required to do the work. To capture behavioral
competencies on a resume, you must show how your accomplishments con-
firm your competencies. Or to turn it around, you must show how your com-
petencies made it possible for you to rack up home runs.
116
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
Competencies in the animal kingdom
Animals have core competencies, too. Consider
the story of the cat that thought it was a squir-
rel and applied for employment on the food 
production line at a huge acorn silo. The silo
management thought that, based on its ability 
to leap from tree to tree, the cat would do 
an equally good job as the squirrels on its 
workforce.
Unfortunately, that assumption didn’t prove true.
Management hadn’t factored into the hiring
decision the knowledge and behavioral compo-
nents of the cat’s competency package.
At first, the cat dazzled management with its
spectacular leaps, branch-to-branch, tree-to-
tree. But the cat’s productivity rating soon
began to plummet. The cat that thought it was a
squirrel brought home only a few acorns a week
and was just exhausted at the end of each day.
Puzzled, management investigated, watching
the cat for a full week.
What management discovered was that you
could put into a thimble the cat’s knowledge of
acorn gathering. The cat spent most of its day
swiping at nimble-winged birds that kept flying
away from the cat’s enthusiastic pounces.
Outmaneuvered, weary, and desperate, the cat
did its best to gather the paltry few acorns it
could find in the few minutes before quitting
time. Clearly, the cat lacked natural ability to
gather acorns, and its behavior rankled bird
lovers throughout management.
Too bad, management said, issuing the cat a
pink slip. The cat just doesn’t have the native
“nut-gathering tree smarts” that squirrels use
by instinct to do a bang-up job of squirreling
away a winter’s feast. And as for behavior, man-
agement explained that it wanted a high pro-
ducer, not an avian predator.
Coworker squirrels, watching from the side-
lines, wondered whether the feline’s compe-
tency failure in acorning while leaping may
have inspired the familiar phrase, “What a cat
don’t know, a cat don’t know.”

To connect your behaviors with your accomplishments, you might say:
Product development: Created new midmarket segment supporting an
annual growth rate of 20% in a flat industry, demonstrating high energy and
business acumen.
In the above example, the verb “demonstrating” connects the accomplish-
ment (Created new mid-market segment supporting an annual growth rate of
20% in a flat industry) with competencies (high energy and business
acumen). Other verbs you can use to bridge the two types of information
include:
 Confirming
 Displaying
 Exhibiting
 Illustrating
 Manifesting
 Proving
 Revealing
 Verifying
Gaining Extra Points
You covered the meat and potatoes of your resume content. What can you
add that will strengthen your image? You could, for instance, draw from your
activities to show that you’ve got the right stuff. John Gill of Carlsbad,
California, paid his own expenses to spend his college spring break building
houses for the poor in Mexico. That act of sacrifice shows Gill’s character,
that he goes out of his way to do important things for others. That’s good
resume content. 
What’s in your diary and how will it strengthen your image? Here are a few
thoughts on the nitty-gritty of buffing your image.
Activities
Activities can be anything from hobbies and sports to campus extracurricu-
lar participation. The trick is to analyze how each activity is relevant to the
target job; discuss skills, knowledge, or other competencies developed; and
list all achievements. Make sure that this section doesn’t become meaning-
less filler.
117
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference

In addition, avoid potentially controversial activities: Stating that you’re a
moose hunter won’t endear you to animal-loving recruiters. If you’ve been
able to research the reader and have found that you two have a common
interest, list it on your resume so that it can become an icebreaker topic
during an interview.
Organizations
Give yourself even more credentials with professional and civic affiliations.
Mention all important offices held. Relate these affiliations to your reader in
terms of marketable skills, knowledge, and achievements. A high profile in
the community is particularly important for sales jobs.
Just as you should be careful about which activities you identify, so too
should you be sensitive to booby traps in organization memberships:
 Listing too many organizations may make the reader wonder when you’d
have time to do the job.
 Noting that you belong to one minority group organization may work in
your favor, but reporting your membership in five minority group organi-
zations may raise red flags. The recruiter may worry that you’re a trou-
ble-making activist.
 And, of course, you know better than to list your membership in reli-
gious or political organizations (unless you’re applying for a job that
requires such membership). They don’t apply to your ability to do the
job, and some readers may use them to keep you out of the running.
Honors and awards
List most of the achievements for which you were recognized. If the achieve-
ment had zero to do with work or doesn’t show you in a professional light,
don’t take up white space with it; for example, you probably wouldn’t list a
Chili Cook-Off award unless you’re applying for a job as a chef.
Licenses and samples of your work
If you’re in the legal, certified accounting, engineering, or medical profession,
add to your resume the appropriate license, certifications, and other identifi-
cations required for the position. For a professional resume or CV, you may
also list descriptions or titles of specific work that you’ve done or include
samples of your work along with your resume. If asked to include samples of
your work, be selective about what you send.
118
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Testimonials
After citing an achievement, you can follow up with a short, flattering quote
from your boss or a client:
 For an information systems technician: Bob Boss told the entire office
that “I am thrilled that Charlie Pitman cut Internet access and telephone
costs by 80% [date].”
 For a sales rep at a copy shop. “Jennifer Robertson’s resourcefulness in
getting inside the SoapSuds account and expanding it by 15% after
others had tried for months is truly impressive,” said Barbara Boss, my
direct supervisor in [date].
Testimonials work, or advertisers wouldn’t spend billions of dollars to use
them. Be sure to check with your source before adding a quote to your
resume.
Shaping Your Content 
on Application Forms
Application forms (paper or online) aren’t resume content, but they’re kiss-
ing cousins. Filling out these forms requires a shift in what you say because
you have to sign them, making the application form a legal document. Lies can
come back to bite you. Stick to the facts as you follow these rules: 
 If you can, take the application home where you won’t be rushed and
can spend adequate time polishing your application to get it just right.
Photocopy the application form before you begin in case you find errors
on the original (or spill coffee on it) and need a clean copy.
 Verify all dates of employment and salaries to the letter.
 Enter the full name and last known address of former employers. If
former employers are no longer available, don’t substitute coworkers.
 If asked for salary history, give your base salary (or add commission and
bonuses), omitting benefits.
 Give a complete employment history in months and years, including
trivial three-week jobs that you wisely left off the resume. If you don’t
tell the whole story, you leave a loophole of withholding information
that later can be used against you if the employer decides that you’re
excess.
 Unless you have a condition directly affecting your ability to do the job
for which you’re applying, you need not elaborate on any disability.
119
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference

 Divulge any criminal record unless your records are sealed; consult a
lawyer about the possibility of expungement before job hunting.
 Be honest about having collected unemployment benefits (but remem-
ber that repeaters are frowned on); if you’re caught lying about it later,
practice your farewell speech.
 Autograph the application; you’ve been honest — why worry?
Content to Omit: Your Salary Story
Never mention salary on your resume. Period.
Sometimes a job ad asks for your salary history or salary requirements.
Realize that revealing dollar figures in advance puts you at a disadvantage.
This is especially true if you’ve been working for low pay — or if you’ve been
paid above market.
In addition to job ads, profile forms on job Web sites and online personal
agent programs almost always ask for your salary information. If you decide
to participate, state your expectations in a range ($xxx to $xxx), and include
the value of all perks (benefits, bonuses), not just salary, in your salary 
history.
When you choose to disclose your salary history or requirements online,
make a distinction between general information forms and formal signed
applications (legal documents). Include benefits (total compensation) on gen-
eral information forms, but omit benefits on formal signed applications that
ask for “salary history.”
Make sure you do these two things before you provide salary information:
 Research the market rate for someone with your skills and experience.
Start with the Web sites Salary.com (www.salary.com), Salary Expert
(www.salaryexpert.com), and PayScale (www.payscale.com).
 Find out why the smart money advises against being too quick to pipe
up with hard figures on the money you’ve made and the money you
want. What can you expect in return for revealing salary information, job
unseen? You get a chance to name your price and hope you find takers,
many of whom will want to talk your price down. Get advice by reading
articles by Jack Chapman on JobStar (www.jobstar.org). Absorb all
you can — salary negotiation is as complex as buying a house.

Exception to my salary silence advice: Tell recruiters with whom you have a
serious interest in working how much you’ve earned and how much it will
cost an employer to hire you. Otherwise, know that recruiters don’t want to
waste time playing games and are likely to fold up their interest and wave
goodbye.
Accomplishments Are Your Content Aces
Chapter 5 speaks of selling, not telling, your worth. Citing your earned
accomplishments and achievements are how you make that happen. To cap-
ture the best job, you know that you can’t simply add the latest job descrip-
tion and recalculate the same old resume with updated data. 
Focus on your best content and present it forcefully. Because you have very
few words to work with, choose precisely the correct words; Chapter 7 takes
you to the word desk. Don’t rush the construction of your resume: If you
build it right, the interviews will come.
121
Chapter 6: Content Makes the OnTarget Difference
Putting your content in online resume builders
How much do the free online resume builders
offered at virtually all substantial job boards and
some company Web sites help you “sell to it
rather than tell it?”
Many automated resume builders benefit 
the recruiting side of the employment industry,
not the job-seeking side. Their builder soft-
ware, aiming for efficiency, tries to standardize
data — to compare apples to apples. Such
builder software limits you to a synopsis of bare
bones information. That is, they offer space for
the essentials — your contact information, last
three jobs, and education, for example. But they
may not provide space for humanizing experi-
ences, such as volunteerism, honors, and
awards. 
If you use specific resume builder software pro-
gram to construct your online resume, notice
whether it (a) favors the recruiter, or (b) sur-
prise!, favors the job seeker.
If you want to use an online resume builder with
a job board or a company Web site, remember
to think for yourself and not assume the tech-
nology will bring to light your most marketable
qualities, which this book shows you how to
emphasize.

ords: How powerful they are. It doesn’t take many of them to change
the world: The Lord’s Prayer has 66 words, Lincoln’s Gettysburg
address numbers just 286 words, and the U.S. Declaration of Independence
contains but 1,322 words.
Winston Churchill needed only two words to bind Russia to the Iron Curtain.
A brief four words memorialized Martin Luther King’s vision: I have a dream.
And in a single sentence, John F. Kennedy set the challenge for a generation:
Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.
Words are powerful — big words like motherland and environmentalism and
small words like peace and war or dawn, family, hope, love, and home.
Words are pegs to hang your qualifications on. Words are the power that lifts
you above the faceless crowd and sets you in Good Fortune’s way. The right
words can change your life.
Begin your hunt for the right words to build an OnTarget resume, from action
verbs and keyword nouns, to grammar and spelling tips.
Wow words are action verbs describing your strengths: improve, upgrade,
schedule. Keywords are usually nouns demonstrating essential skills: technol-
ogy transfers, PhD organic chemistry, multinational marketing. A smattering of
both can make your resume stand up and sing. An absence of either can
make your resume sit down and shut up.

Wow Words Can Bring Good News
Use power-play verbs to communicate your abilities and accomplishments. 
A punch-zip delivery keeps these achievement-oriented verbs campaigning
for you. The important thing is to choose words of substance and power that
zero in on your abilities and achievements.
Try not to use the same word twice on your resume — the thesaurus in a
word-processing program can give you more possibilities.

The last word on Wow words: Little words never devalue a big idea.
Keywords Are Key to Finding You
Recruiters and employers use keywords to search and retrieve e-resumes in
databases for available positions. “Keywords are what employers search for
when trying to fill a position: the essential hard skills and knowledge needed
to do the job,” explains this book’s technical reviewer, James M. Lemke.
Keywords are chiefly nouns and short phrases. That’s your take-home mes-
sage. But once in a while, keywords can be adjectives and action verbs.
Employers choose their own list of keywords — that’s why no list is universal.
131
Chapter 7: Wow Words Work Wonders

In computerized job searches, keywords describe not only your knowledge
base and skills but also such things as well-known companies, big-name col-
leges and universities, degrees, licensure, and professional affiliations.
Keywords identify your experience and education in these categories:
 Skills
 Technical and professional areas of expertise
 Achievements
 Professional licenses and certifications
 Other distinguishing features of your work history
 Prestigious schools or former employers
Employers identify keywords, often including industry jargon, that they think
represent essential qualifications necessary for high performance in a given
position. They specify those keywords when they search a resume database.
Rather than stopping with action verbs, connect your achievements. You
managed what? You organized what? You developed what? Job computers
look for the whats, and the whats are usually nouns.
The new emphasis on defining Internet applicants (see Chapter 1) which
requires that job seekers offer each job qualification listed for a specific posi-
tion, makes it more important than ever to use the qualifying keywords.
Otherwise, you’ll be overlooked for that particular job.
Keywords are arbitrary and specific to the employer and each employer
search. So the keywords (qualifications) in each job ad are the place to start
as you customize your resume for the position. But you need to make edu-
cated guesses when you’re responding not to advertised jobs but merely
warehousing your resume online. The following lists provide a few examples
of keywords for selected career fields and industries.
Keywords for administration/management
administrative processes
facilities management
bachelor’s degree
front office operations
back office operations

Where to Find Keywords
How can you find keywords for your occupation or career field? Use a high-
lighter to pluck keywords from these resources.
 Online and printed help-wanted ads: Highlight the job skills, competen-
cies, experience, education, and other nouns that employers ask for.
 Job descriptions: Ask employers for them, check at libraries for books
or software with job descriptions, or search online. To find them online,
just enter such terms as “job descriptions” or “job descriptions trainer”
or “job descriptions electrical engineer” on a search engine, such as
Google (www.google.com).
 The Occupational Outlook Handbook and Dictionary of Occupational
Titles (both published by the U.S. Department of Labor): Both books are
at schools and libraries; the Handbook is online at www.bls.gov/oco.
 Your core resume: Look through to highlight nouns that identify job
skills, competencies, experience, and education.
 Trade magazine news stories: Text about your career field or occupa-
tion should be ripe with keywords.
 Online or printed annual reports of companies in your field: The com-
pany descriptions of key personnel and departmental achievements
should offer strong keyword clues.
 Programs for industry conferences and events: Speaker topics address
current industry issues, a rich source of keywords.
 Internet search engine: Plug in a targeted company’s name and search
the site that comes up. Look closely at the careers portal and read cur-
rent press releases.
You can also use Internet search engines to scout out industry-specific
directories, glossaries, and dictionaries.
135
Chapter 7: Wow Words Work Wonders

Get a Grip on Grammar
Resume language differs from normal speech in several ways. In general, keep
the language tight and the tone professional, avoiding the following:
 First-person pronouns (I, we): Your name is at the top of each resume
page, so the recruiter knows it’s about you. Eliminate first-person pro-
nouns. Also, don’t use third-person pronouns (he, she) when referring to
yourself — the narrative technique makes you seem pompous. Simply
start with a verb.
 Articles (the, a, an): Articles crowd sentences and don’t clarify meaning.
Substitute retrained staff for retrained the staff.
 Helping verbs (have, had, may, might): Helping verbs weaken claims
and credibility — implying that your time has passed and portraying
you as a job-hunting weakling. Say managed instead of have managed.
136
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
Mining for keywords in job descriptions
The excerpts below of two job descriptions
posted on Business.com (www.business.
com; search on job descriptions) illustrate how
you can find keywords almost everywhere. In
these examples, the keywords are italicized.
Auto Dismantler:
 Knowledge of proper operation of lifts, fork-
lifts, torches, power wrenches, etc.
 Knowledge of warehouse, core, and stack
locations.
 Skill to move vehicles without damaging
vehicle, other vehicles or personnel.
 Skill to remove body and mechanical parts
without damage to part, self, or others.
 Ability to read a Dismantler report and
assess stock levels.
 Ability to accurately assess condition of
parts to be inventoried.
Budget Assistant:
 Reviews monthly expense statements,
monitors monthly expenditures, and gathers
supporting documentation for supervisor
review and approval.
 Performs basic arithmetic operations to cal-
culate and/or verify expense totals and
account balances.
 Operates computer to enter data into
spreadsheet and/or database. Types rou-
tine correspondence and reports.
 Operates office equipment such as photo-
copier, fax machine, and calculator.

 “Being” verbs (am, is, are, was, were): Being verbs suggest a state of
existence rather than a state of motion. Try monitored requisitions
instead of requisitions were monitored. The active voice gives a stronger,
more confident delivery.
 Shifts in tense: Use the present tense for a job you’re still in and the past
tense for jobs you’ve left. But, among the jobs you’ve left, don’t switch
back and forth between tenses. Another big mistake: dating a job as
though you’re still employed (2008–Present) and then describing it in
the past tense.
 Complex sentences: Unless you keep your sentences lean and clean,
readers won’t take time to decipher them. Process this mind-stumper:
Reduced hospital costs by 67% by creating a patient-independence pro-
gram, where they make their own beds, and as noted by hospital finance
department, costs of nails and wood totaled $300 less per patient than
work hours of maintenance staff.
Eliminate complex sentences by dividing ideas into sentences of their
own and getting rid of extraneous details:
Reduced hospital costs by 67%. Originated patient independence program
that decreased per-patient expense by $300 each.
 Overwriting: Use your own voice; don’t say expeditious when you want
to say swift.
 Abbreviations: Abbreviations are informal and not universal — even
when they’re career-specific. Use Internet instead of Net.
The exception is industry jargon — use it, especially in digital resumes.
Knowledge and use of industry jargon adds to your credibility to be able
to correctly and casually use terms common to the industry in which
you’re seeking employment.
A Few Words about Spelling
What is the name of a resume self-defense manual for job seekers? The 
dictionary! 
Of all the reasons causing recruiters and hiring managers to shoot down
resumes, carelessness with spelling, grammar, and choice of words rank
close to the top. Even when the real reason for rejection is bias or something
else entirely, as in “I just don’t like that dude,” the use of misspelled words is
a convenient justification. Who can quarrel with the adage “Garbage in,
garbage out”?
137
Chapter 7: Wow Words Work Wonders

Employers especially recoil from impaired spelling when the job seeker
botches the interviewer’s or the organization’s name. (You can Google your
way to the company’s Web site to spell the organization’s name; you can 
call to confirm the spelling of the interviewer’s name.) Here’s the take-away
message:
Know thy computer spell checker. Know thy dictionary, in print or online at
dictionary.com. And know a human being who can carefully proofread your
resumes to pick up grammar mistakes or misused words.

Words Sell Your Story
Remember, when your words speak for you, you need to be sure to use words
that everyone can understand and that relate to the job at hand. Value your
words. Each one is a tool to your future.
139
Chapter 7: Wow Words Work Wonders
Avoid poison words
Recruiters advise staying away from the fol-
lowing words on your resume:
 Responsibilities included: Make your
resume 
accomplishment-driven, 
not
responsibilities-driven. Job-descriptions
language tells, not sells, in a resume.
 Salary: Money talk doesn’t belong on a
resume, period. Spilling your financial
beans limits your options because you 
may be priced too high or too low, If you
absolutely must deal with salary history or
salary requirements before the interview,
discuss dollars in a cover letter.
 Fired: Don’t let this word slip into your
resume if you want it to escape being lost in
a database. Laid-off or reduction in force
generally aren’t good terms either, but you
can use them when circumstances make it
sound as though you were fired. A lay-off or
a reduction in force implies the action was
no fault of yours, but fired suggests that you
screwed up. The basic rule: Don’t state why
you left a position; save the explanation for
an interview.
 References 
available 
upon 
request:
References are assumed. Save the space
for more important information.
 Social Security number: Never make your-
self vulnerable in this era of identity theft.
The exception to this rule is when you apply
for a federal government position; in that
case, you’re required to submit your SSN.
 Assisted with, worked with, helped with:
Did you really just assist or help someone
else? Were you standing by watching
someone else do the work? Use action
verbs to describe how you contributed to
each achievement.
 Also: The word is unnecessary. (for exam-
ple, Manage budget of $1 million. Also
interface with consultants.) Write tightly.
Eliminate also, an, the, and and wherever
you can. Use the saved space to pack more
punch, and the resume won’t lose meaning.

Refine Your Design 
for Great Looks
In This Chapter
 Keeping paper resumes clean-cut
 Considering design factors in digital resumes
 Giving your qualifications room to breathe
 Unstuffing an overstuffed resume
G
ood design is always about more than simply looking good. Good
resume design means making your document both appealing and acces-
sible for prospective employers. Making it relevant. Making it feel right for
the job you seek and appropriate for someone in your shoes. There’s no
reason why handsome physical design cannot be — and every reason why it
should be — applied to the resume information so important to your journey
ahead.
As I mention in Chapter 4, most modern recruiting software can now handle
fully formatted resumes in a word-processing attachment (usually MS Word
or Corel WordPerfect). This means that all the design tips for paper resumes
in this chapter work fine for attached online resumes. 
Although handsome resumes are back in vogue, there will be times when it is
still necessary to send your word-processed resume in plain text, also called
ASCII. In fact, you may as well create an ASCII version at the start of your job
search and store it on your computer. Doing so allows you to conveniently
and repeatedly copy and paste it, without reformatting each time.
You will, of course, still need to make the customizing changes to the position
or career field now effectively required by market forces and government
rules (see Chapter 1). For ASCII tips, see Chapter 4.

Resumes That Resonate
Although the market is moving away from paper resumes toward digital
resumes, tree-and-ink products will be around for the foreseeable future — if
for no other reason than for distribution at career fairs, for circulation
throughout your network, and to bring to job interviews. Here are sugges-
tions on how to make the first cut in the employment screening process.
Word processing
Use a computer equipped with word-processing software to produce your
resume. Typewritten copies are still okay, but it’s hard to produce clean,
crisp copy on a typewriter.
Printing
Today’s standard is a sharp-looking resume printed on a laser or inkjet
printer. Old-fashioned dot matrix printers lack the ability to crank out high-
quality work.
Paper selection
In a digital era, how good should your paper be? Although you’re using paper
only for hand-to-hand delivery, the standards haven’t changed. For profes-
sional, technical, managerial, and executive jobs, the stock for a paper
resume should be quality paper that contains rag content of perhaps 25 per-
cent, as well as a watermark (a faint image ingrained in the paper). For lower-
level positions, any decent-looking paper will do.
What color should you choose? Stick to white or off-white, eggshell, or the
palest of gray. Print on only one side of the sheet.
What about theme papers — musical notes for musicians, tree leaves for
environmental jobs, and the like? Although the use of theme paper for
resumes has grown over the past decade, my preference is for plain stock
unless you’re in a highly creative field. Most employers still prefer the no-
frills look in paper.
142
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Consistency, consistency, consistency
Make reading easy on employers by deciding on a style and sticking to it. You
detract from your words — and your image — when you do the following
things:
 Mix differently spaced tabs and indentations.
 Make a habit of mixing bullet styles. You can mix bullets and checkmarks
if the result is tasteful and doesn’t look cluttered.
 Use different spacing between lines. Keep your line spaces the same
between headings and the body text for each data point. You’re going for
a finished look, which means no fanciful visual additions.
When three’s not a crowd
Certain groupings are just more pleasing to the eye, so many resume pros use
the rule of threes: three skills groups, three accomplishments, three sen-
tences on a topic, and so forth. A grouping of five is also attractive. 
But avoiding even numbers is not a hard-and-fast rule — groups of two and
four are equally acceptable. Look for examples of odd-number groupings in
the sample resumes in Part III. Ask a friend with artistic good taste to look at
your final draft and give you a review of your design technique.
Come on, break it up!
How often have you tried to read a solid block of text and given up because it
makes you want to run for the eye drops? Employers and recruiters reading
resume after resume also space out on dense text, especially in small type.
The answer is to break it up, to segment your data points in related groups.

Open spaces
White space is the master graphic attention-getter; it makes recruiters want
to read a resume. Too often, job seekers hearing that they must not exceed
one page (untrue), try to cram too much information in too little space.
144
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

A ratio of about one-quarter white space to text is about right. Line spacing
between items is vital. Although some resume pros advise that you right-
justify the text (aligning it down the right side of the page), there’s no hard-
and-fast rule on whether it’s best to leave the right-hand margins ragged or
justified. I prefer ragged margins because right justification creates awkward
white spaces.
Whichever you choose, be clear that an overcrowded page almost guarantees
that your resume won’t be read by younger recruiters and hiring managers
who grew up in an age of television and quick-reading stories in newspapers,
magazines, and Web content. And older eyes won’t take the wear and tear of
too many words jammed into a small space. 
Typefaces and fonts
A typeface is a family of characters — letters, numbers and symbols. A font is
a specific size of a typeface. For example, Helvetica is a typeface; Helvetica
10-point bold, Helvetica 12-point bold, and Helvetica 14-point bold are three
different fonts.
No more than two typefaces should appear on one resume, but if you don’t
have an eye for good design, stick to one typeface. Times New Roman, Arial,
Verdana, or Helvetica used alone is a fine choice for your resume.
If you want to mix two typefaces, I like Helvetica for the headings and Times
New Roman for the text and lesser headings. Printing your name in small cap-
ital letters can be pleasing. Using larger type (12, 14, or 16 pt.) or boldface for
headings can give them necessary prominence. Use italics sparingly; you
don’t want to overdo emphasis, and italicized words lose readability in
blocks of text.
Professional resume writers use many tricks of the trade to put more infor-
mation in a resume without making it seem overstuffed. They condense type,
use a smaller-size font, and manipulate vertical spacing. Most amateur
resume writers don’t want to get into this depth of detail, but if you do, a
good resource is Susan Britton Whitcomb’s Resume Magic: Trade Secrets 
of a Professional Resume Writer (JIST Publishing).

Chapter 8: Refine Your Design for Great Looks

A few more tips on appearance
When wrapping up the fair face of your resume, bear these factors in mind:
 Your name and contact information can be flush left, centered, or flush
right. Look at examples in Chapter 12.
 Important information jumps in the recruiter’s face when set off by 
bullets, asterisks, and dashes.
 Typos and spelling errors are attention killers. They are seen as careless-
ness or as a lack of professionalism. Even when your resume is a cus-
tomized point-by-point match for the job being filled, a spelling mistake
or poor grammar impacts its overall impression and may well sink your
chances.
Use your computer’s spell-check feature, read your finished resume
carefully, and ask a friend who is a good proofreader to read it also.
 Don’t staple together a two- or three-page resume or put it in a folder or
plastic insert. The resume may be photocopied and distributed, or it
may be — gasp, shades of old technology! — scanned into a database.
To minimize the risk of a page becoming an orphan, put a simple header
or footer atop each page after the first with your name and page number.
In a multiple-page resume, you may want to indicate the total number of
pages (for example, Page 1 of 2).
Choosing between Two Resume Layouts
Using a simple, cleanly designed layout is fundamental. It may be the differ-
ence between your resume being read or passed over. 
Take a look at what I mean: Figure 8-1 shows you the before version of the
resume of Bruce Begovic, who holds a new master’s degree in biology. It’s
nothing but a “design dump” in which Bruce’s data is merely unloaded onto a
single page without giving thought to layout refinements. Pass the eyewash!
Bruce’s after version, Figure 8-2, opens up the design structure, adds balance
and expands the resume into one-and-a-half pages. It is simple, makes use of a
smart typeface, and limits boldface, all of which permits emphasis on the
really important qualifications for his biotech career field: education, lab
experience, research experience, teaching experience, and an excellent grad-
uate GPA.

Which version would you rather read — the tight one-pager, or the clean,
open design on the two-pager?
Design That Gets the Word Out
Because you’re counting on your resume to get you through the interview
door, pay attention to its appearance as well as its content. Readers should
easily and quickly grasp your targeted resume’s elements that show you’re a
strong match for the job. If you’re choosing between “easily read” or “overde-
signed,” go for easily read.
As a busy recruiter says: “The resume design makes a great deal of differ-
ence. Most of us don’t have time to search through a resume looking for
information. If it’s not easy to spot, the resume will go into the ‘do not call’
pile. The better the design of the resume, the more likely we are to interview.”

Changing Phases
In This Chapter
 Recent graduates: How to start your career well
 Baby boomers: How to successfully continue your career
 Returning military members: How to get back in civilian clover
 Upscale and federal hopefuls: A few pointers on how to ace moves to new turf
A
t several points in the flow of your life, you’re likely to find yourself in a
“just passing through” stage where you’re temporarily required to come
up with new solutions to employment roadblocks. At such stages, you’re 
temporarily required to think differently about how to put your best foot 
forward. 
Often the techniques you’ve used before — or that you may use in the 
future — just aren’t delivering the goods for you in this life phase. When you
hit a passages wall, step back and ask yourself, “How can I fix this problem
for this particular stage in my life?”
In changing from one style of life or workplace to another, refresh your
resumes with strategies and techniques that will ease the transition. When
faced with a new situation, remind yourself to sell solutions, not histories.
This chapter shows you how to do just that and tackles the passages issue
for three main times of transition: recent graduates, baby boomers, and
returning military members. I briefly touch on two other related situations:
aspiring to move into or within the executive ranks, and aiming to enter or
leave federal employment.

Scoring Big as a Recent Graduate
If you’ve just walked the cap-and-gown line, here’s a primer on the strengths
and weaknesses packaged with your individual situation.
Quick take: Rookie strengths
As a recent graduate, you have three main selling points and various minor
ones:
 You’re energetic and fired up to tackle assigned tasks. With no kids,
you’re more likely to smile when asked to work long hours than are
older employees who have family obligations. 
 You’re more current in technical skills than older competitors.
 You’re available for the right price. You cost much less than what an
older, experienced person expects. Maybe half as much.
Throw in assertions that you are a fast learner, are untarnished by earlier
workplace habits that may be anathema to new employers, and that, as a
rookie, you are prime material to be developed in concert with a prospective
employer’s viewpoints. Provide real-life examples of each claim or you’ll be
devalued as a windbag who has merely memorized slick talking points.
Quick take: Rookie soft spots
Weaknesses you have to wrestle include the stereotyping by employers of
recent graduates as inept greenhorns who can’t find their butts with both
hands. In fact, multiple and recent surveys raise the decibel level on what
many employers have long suspected or complained about: Most college stu-
dents lack marketable skills.
One respectable study (American Institutes for Research) conducted in 2006
alleges that more than half of students at four-year schools and more than 
75 percent at two-year colleges lack the skills to perform complex literacy
tasks. Yikes! What can you do to offset this image of gross incompetence?
If you have a grade point average (GPA) above 3.5, or have worked as a tutor,
emphasize that fact on your resume and at the top of job interviews. You are
trying to create the “halo” effect; that is, if one big first-impression factor is
perceived as being good, an assumption is made that other factors must be
good as well.
152
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

If your GPA is poor or marginal, omit it from your resume but bring it up
midway in a job interview. Instead, show that you had to work to pay for your
school and living expenses. And explain that you devoted much time to “real
life” experiences, such as leadership in campus organizations for jobs work-
ing with people. Ideally, you also can show that your grades in your major are
excellent, and that your GPA rose as you learned better study habits.
Tips for recent graduates
Times and resumes have changed since your older pals graduated. As I
explain in Chapter 1, start by writing a multiple-page core resume that
includes familiar requirements for your career field. If popular requirements
include A, B, C, and D, be sure your core resume reflects your qualifications
in A, B, C, and D. This source document is your wellspring for cranking out
shorter and targeted marketing communications.
Customize your spinoff resumes for replying to specific job ads. And, if logi-
cal, customize your spinoff resumes for posting in resume databases; if
you’re a marketing graduate, for example, you might choose to match differ-
ent requirements for a resume database for the chemical industry than a
resume database for the healthcare industry. You can handle the matching of
requirements with your qualifications in your opening skills summary
(Chapter 6) and throughout your resume.
Keep the following resume boosters in mind, as well.
Beef up your sales pitch
Thicken your work experience by including all unpaid positions — intern-
ships, special projects, and volunteer jobs. List them in chronological order
in your Work Experience section. Statements like these are powerful agents
on your resume:
Sales: Sold $1,200 worth of tickets to college arts festival
Counseling: Advised 16 freshman students as peer counselor
Public Policy Coordination: Coordinator for student petition drive to save
California Cougar from sports hunting, gaining 2,000 signatures in 35 days
Highlight the work experience most relevant to your intended future. If you
have at least one year of full-time professional experience, place education
after experience — unless your education is changing your career path.
153
Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

Clarify your aim
Make your objective clear if you use an objective statement. Don’t use a lofty
statement of the absurd, like this one:
I’m seeking a challenging position that will allow me to actualize my talents
in saving the world, with good potential for professional growth and pay
commensurate with my ability.
Instead, cut to the chase, like this:
Research position in urban planning field in Chicago area.
You can add a summary, too, as I show you in Chapter 6.
Ditch unhelpful information
Don’t enclose your resume in a report cover or bulky package or attach
school transcripts or letters of recommendation, unless they’re requested.
Include an activity only if it reveals skills, competencies, accomplishments,
results, or other qualifications to support your intended job. Omit high
school data unless it adds a unique fact to the total impression that you’re
creating.
What about the laundry list of your college courses — do they earn their
keep on your resume? No, unless the course work is unusual or you have
little to say without them.
Data-mine your college experience
Need a job? Get experience! Need experience? Get a job! This predicament
has frustrated new graduates since the continents broke apart.
Having nothing but education to work with makes for a difficult resume sce-
nario. Only dedicated job research and customizing each resume gives you a
chance of producing a persuasive product. Perhaps you overlooked some-
thing; even child-sitting or pet-sitting offers experience in accepting responsi-
bility and demonstrates reliability.
Consider the following factors in identifying the experience and skills you
garnered in college and matching the information with the job you hope to
land:
 Work: Internships, summer jobs, part-time jobs, campus jobs, entrepre-
neurial jobs, temporary work, and volunteer work
 Sports: Proven ability to achieve goals in a team environment
154
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

 Awards and honors
 Research papers and projects
 Campus leadership
 Grade Point Average (GPA): If it’s 3.0 or above; otherwise, omit it (some
advisers set the GPA floor at 3.5).
 Technical skills and software facility
Concerning student jobs, one technique to make the most of your experience
is to separate your jobs into fragments and explain them. For example, don’t
say that your job title was “office help” or “office clerk” and stop there.
Divide the job into such functions as telephone reception, telephone sales,
contract negotiations, purchasing, inventory, staff training, computer applica-
tion training, Web design, public speaking, and written communications.
Describe each one in terms of your accomplishments and their outcomes.
If an exhaustive search of your hobbies, campus activities, or community ser-
vice turns up absolutely nothing worth putting on your resume, your educa-
tion must carry the entire weight of candidacy for employment. Milk it dry, as
the example in Figure 9-1 suggests.
Gaffes common to new graduates
New graduates are more likely than experienced job seekers to make the fol-
lowing mistakes.
Falling short of image standards
If you present a paper resume flawed with little printing errors, or an online
resume blemished with unwrapped lines of type that seem to run on for
miles, you flunk.
Omitting heavy-hitter points
You distinguish yourself by creating an opening summary that calls to mind
an image of your unique selling points. Use categories described in “Data-
mine your college experience” stated earlier in this section. For example: As
team captain, used strong influencing skills and tremendous personal energy.
Got marketplace experience through multiple Internships and 6 student jobs,
including tutoring. GPA 3.8 despite heavy course load. Keep your summary
brief — three to four achievements is plenty.

Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Overcompensating with gimmicky language
Don’t tart up your resume to compensate for a lack of qualifications. Avoid
using exotically original language, such as “eyelinered genius,” a term used
by a business graduate applying for an entry-level marketing position in the
cosmetics industry. The term may be colorful, but charm communicates
better in the interview.
Making employers guess
Employers hate it when they’re asked to decipher your intent. Merely pre-
senting your declared major and transcript excerpts is not enough to kick off
a productive job search. Add either an objective to your resume and/or a
skills summary directed at a specific career field.
Leveling the experience field
Your resume is no place to give every job equal billing. Many rookie resumes
are little more than rote listings of previous jobs — subpoena server, TV
satellite dish sales representative, waiter, landscape helper, and computer
coach, for example. Separate your jobs into an A list and a B list. The A list
contains the jobs that relate to what you want to do next, even if you have to
stretch them to make a connection. Briefly mention jobs on the B list in a sec-
tion called Other Experience or Other Jobs.
Stopping with bare bones
Some rookies look at a sheet of paper and then at their embarrassing, bedrag-
gled collection of jobs in their paid-experience stew. Desperate to get any-
thing written, they settle for name, rank, and serial number (employer, job
title, and dates of employment).
The solution is to pull in all experience, including volunteer and part-time
gigs. Sit, think, think some more, and add all your relevant competencies and
skills pointing in the direction in which you hope to thumb a ride. One strat-
egy is to sign up for a postgraduate internship. Speak with your college’s
career counselors or internship counselors about this possibility.
Still stymied? Look online for sample resume ideas; try www.collegegrad.
com.
Hiding hot information
Data entombed is data forgotten. Employers remember best the information
you give first in a resume, not the data folded into the middle. Decide what
your selling points are and pack that punch upfront. Ask three friends to 
read your resume and immediately tell you what they remember about it.
157
Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

Highlighting the immaterial
Featuring the wrong skills and knowledge acquired on each job is an error
that many first-time resume writers make. Suppose you want to be a multime-
dia producer and one of your work experience citations is your three years of
effort for campus student theatrical productions. You painted scenery, sold
tickets, and designed sets. It’s the experience in designing sets that helps
qualify you for multimedia producer, not painting scenery or selling tickets.
Cloak yourself in the skills that help employers imagine you playing a role in
their company.
Ignoring employers’ needs
Even the smartest new graduates, who may have survived research chal-
lenges as rigorous as uncovering the body language of ancient French cave
dwellers, make this mistake. They forget to find out what employers want
from new hires. Your college career center can sprinkle your search path with
gems of wisdom in reading employers’ wish lists.
Writing boastfully
Appearing too arrogant about your talents can cause employers to question
your ability to learn as a junior team member. Even when you’re just trying to
compensate for your inexperience, avoid terminology that comes across as
contrived or blatantly self-important. If you’re not sure, ask older friends to
describe the kind of person they think your resume represents.
Grabbing Good Jobs as a Baby Boomer
If you’re on the shady side of 50 (maybe even 40 in today’s world), it’s point-
less to debate whether or not age discrimination lives. It does. Society contin-
ues to wink at age bias. My readers daily attest to that fact. In this section, 
I don’t discuss legal remedies or self-employment. Instead, I show you how to
do all within your power to beat off pesky bias and display your excellent
qualifications on your resume.
First, a primer on the pluses and minuses of being a boomer job seeker.
Quick take: Boomer strengths
You have at least five main selling points and a slew of minor ones:
158
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

 You have more knowledge and greater wisdom than you did when you
were half your age. Your judgment is a valuable commodity. You could
easily save an employer substantial “mistake dollars” because you’ve
seen most situations play out in some form over the course of your
learning lifetime. You have the common sense that comes with experi-
encing life. You won’t rush into hasty or rash decisions.
 You’re dependable. You won’t take off for frivolous reasons. Employers
can rely on you showing up and doing the job as expected. You’re more
grateful for a good job than younger workers. You show your apprecia-
tion with a strong work ethic. Your work history shows that your word is
your bond.
 You’re motivated to be flexible and adaptable. You may value working
less than a full-time schedule. You can adapt to the changing needs of a
business.
 You may be able to work for less money than your competition. Your
kids are grown and your expenses are down.
 You see the big picture in dealing with people. You’ve had years to dis-
cover what makes them tick. You know from firsthand experience the
quality of customer service consumers expect and appreciate.
Other positive characteristics you have acquired as time kept on going by
include the following: You’ve acquired a taste for team playing because
you’ve seen how all hands can work collectively for the good of a business.
Unlike mountain-climbing younger employees, you won’t skip out for a flashy
opportunity when you’ve got a bird in hand — you’re happy to be working
and you’ve seen enough of the dot-com bubbles to last a lifetime.
Quick take: Boomer soft spots
The notion that older people have had their day and should make room for
the next generation is deeply ingrained, say researchers. The stereotype is
that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks and that all mature workers are
alike in their abilities to learn, perform, energize, remember, and deal with
change in a new kind of world.
Here is a selection of prevalent myths about workers of a certain age, 
followed by the realities you should try to reflect in your resume:
 “Older workers can’t or won’t learn new skills.” A smart, well-executed
resume proves this bit of conventional wisdom wrong, as it certainly is:
The over-50 crowd is the fastest growing group of Internet users. Use
technical terms on your resume if appropriate. Mention new skills
recently acquired. Studies show only negligible loss of cognitive function
of people under 70.
159
Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

 “Training older workers is a lost investment because they won’t be
around for long.” The life of a new technology for which workers are
trained often won’t last as long as the work life of an employee over 50.
Find ways to tell employers that you
• Are committed to doing quality work
• Can get along with co-workers and younger bosses
• Have strong skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic
• Are someone who can be counted on in a crisis
• Are willing to be flexible about doing different tasks
 “Benefit and accident costs are higher for older workers.” According
to a study by the AARP organization, older workers take fewer sick days
per year than do other age groups because they have fewer acute illness
and sporadic sick days. Although it’s true that individual older workers’
health, disability, and life insurance costs do rise slowly with age, they
are offset by lower costs because of fewer dependents.
Overall, fringe benefit costs stay the same as a percentage of salary for all age
groups. Older workers take fewer risks in accident-prone situations and sta-
tistically have lower accident rates than other age groups. Handling this on a
resume is tricky but you could say, if true: “Robust health; no dependents
other than spouse.”
Tips for baby boomers
Perhaps you’ve heard the baby boomer generation’s battle cry: 70 is the new
50? Okay, then 60 is the new 40! And 50 is the new 30! Take the attitude to
heart in your resume. In addition to what it says, a clean, young-looking
resume design is a shield against age bias.
To forestall age discrimination, tailor your resume to make yourself look like
a well-qualified candidate — not a well-preserved one — by using the follow-
ing tips.
Match your target job description
Find or write job descriptions of your target occupations. If you like your cur-
rent field and are leaving involuntarily because it’s disappearing from under
your feet, start with job descriptions in closely related jobs. Compare require-
ments of related jobs with your transferable skills profile. If you don’t like
your current field, forget I mentioned it.
160
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

To identify occupations closely related to your current field, check a library
copy of the Occupational Outlook Handbook published by the U.S. Department
of Labor. Or, read it online at www.bls.gov/oco.
Knowing what you have to offer gets you up off your knees, out of the past,
and into the future; it enables you to write a resume that readers will respect,
by saying, “This is what I can do for you that will add to your productivity,
efficiency, or effectiveness. Not to mention a little bump on the bottom line.”
Shorten your resume
The general guideline is “Go back no more than 15 years.” But if that doesn’t
work for the job you seek, one answer is to create a functional resume where
you emphasize your relevant skills in detail toward the top of the resume and
downplay overly impressive titles that might intimidate younger employers.
For example, Senior Vice President, Sales becomes Sales Executive.
Focus your resume
For emphasis, I’ll repeat that: Focus your resume (see Chapter 6). Concentrate
on highlighting your two most recent or most relevant jobs. Don’t attempt to
give equal attention to each of your past jobs. If your job experience has been
diverse, your resume may look like a job-hopping tale of unrelated job after
unrelated job.
Show that you’re a tower of strength
Give examples of how you solved problems, recovered expenses, and learned
to compensate for weaknesses in your working environment. Emphasize how
quickly such adjustments occurred. Gray heads who’ve survived a few fallen
skies are valuable assets in difficult times.
Demonstrate political correctness
This is especially important for positions that have contact with the public.
Show that you’re familiar with contemporary values by using politically cor-
rect terms wherever appropriate. Examples include diversity, cross-cultural,
mainstream, multiethnic, and people with disabilities (never handicapped), and
women (not girls or gals).
Distribute your resume online
Doing so helps dispel any ideas that you’re over the hill. See Part I for more
on digital resumes.

Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

Murder ancient education dates
Of course, the absence of dates sends a signal: This is a geezer who read a
resume book. But at least it shows that you have sufficient faculties left to
read the book and play the game.
Trim your resume to fighting weight
For very experienced professionals, sorting out the most powerful resume
points can be difficult. It’s like being a gifted child — so many choices, and
you’re good at all of them! You know what they say, though: The longer the
cruise, the older the passengers.
Use appropriate headings
If you’re using freelance, hobby, or volunteer experience, use the heading
Work Experience and list it first, unless you have changed your focus through
education. Then, begin with the heading Education. To refine this heading,
substitute target-job-related education, such as Accounting Education or
Healthcare Education. Your employment history follows.
What do you do with all the experience that was great in your old job but
means zero where you want to go? Lump it together at the end of your
resume under Other Experience or Earlier Experience. Shrink it to positions,
titles, employers, and/or degrees and educational institutions. If extraneous
experience is older than five years, squash it entirely.
Taking a lower-level job
When you’re willing to step down from your previous level of work, the first
thing to know is don’t try to do it with a resume. Do it by a personal first con-
tact where you get a chance to color your positioning in the best hue, and to
defuse intuitive rejection. Tell your story before recruiters and, employers
can say they don’t want to hear it.
Positioning your status counts. You aren’t a manager lowering yourself by
looking for a much less responsible job. You’re a career changer exploring
new fields:
In the past decade, I’ve put in very long hours and exceeded expectations in
jobs in the same industry. I realized I’m a doer who needs new mountains to
climb. I have too much to give to the business world to ride on autopilot the
rest of my life. I want to check out other ways I can make a contribution in a
different career field, hopefully at your company.
162
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Go directly to the hiring manager and explain your reasoned willingness to
accept lower compensation:
I have a great work attitude and excellent judgment. Show me a new task,
and I get it right away. I understand, of course, that the trade-off in moving
into your industry is less pay and responsibility.
When you’ve opened the door, hand over your resume. Write a hybrid
resume (detailed in Chapter 5) with heavy emphasis on the functional part.
You need breathing room to shape your resume in a way that spotlights your
transferable skills as they pertain to the job you seek, such as talent for work-
ing with numbers, reliability, and good attendance record, as well as fast-
learning ability.
When you’re a major seeking a minor position, emphasize that, sometimes,
good people need new chapters in their lives.
Gaffes common to boomers
When you have a long job history, you’re more likely to need updates on the
following issues.
Choosing the wrong focus
Choosing the wrong focus is a problem shared with new graduates who fail to
elaborate on those jobs that best address the hoped-for next job. Like the
real estate adage that the operating principle is location, location, location,
the operating principle for the better jobs is target, target, target.
163
Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases
Show skills as they apply to new position
Making a career change? As you list your skills,
competencies, education, and experience, lead
with the information relevant to the new posi-
tion and then list the other data. You have to
quickly convince the employer that you have the
ability to handle the position.
Assume an engineer wants to move into sales.
The resume should mention things like “client
liaison,” “preparing presentations for meet-
ings,” and “strong communications skills.”
You may begin by writing: “Used a strong tech-
nical background and excellent communica-
tions skills in a sales role.” Then continue to
speak of your ability to provide good technical
advice in a business relationship.
Writing that you “enjoy learning” is a coin with
two sides; the employer may see you as flexible
in your desire to further your education, or, con-
versely, make a negative judgment that you
don’t have the skills right now to hit the ground
running.

Using old resume standards
Many baby boomers, still working on last decade’s calendar, have an out-
dated concept of what a resume should be. An office neighbor recently
expressed surprise when I told him to leave out his personal information,
which once was standard fare on resumes.
“Oh, I thought personal information was supposed to humanize you,” the sea-
soned ace said. Busy employers and job computers don’t care that you’re a
par golfer or play tennis; this kind of personal bonding information comes
out at the interview.
Lacking a summary
Because of the extensiveness of your experience, your resume may be
unwieldy without a summary. Suppose you’re fed up living as a city slicker
and want to move to a small town where agribusiness is dominant. Your
objective may take only one line — “Wish to work as internal auditor in 
the farm equipment industry.” Follow that statement with a one- or two-
paragraph summary of why you’re qualified. Think of a summary as a sales-
person’s hook. It describes some of your special skills, your familiarity with
the target industry, and your top achievements.
164
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
Presenting short-term work on your resume
Baby boomers may find that they’re doing work
for a specific company but are being paid
through a temporary staffing firm or other inter-
mediary and be unsure about how to report the
information on their resumes. You don’t have to
list the middleman firm. Note only the compa-
nies for which the work was performed. Here’s
a brief template:
Company A, Company B, Company C
[date] to
present
For Company A, Name of Department/Division
As job title, performed:
 achievement
 achievement
 achievement
For Company B, Name of Department/Division
As job title, implemented:
 achievement
 achievement
 achievement
For Company C, Name of Department/Division
As job title, credited with:
 achievement
 achievement
 achievement
P.S. If your job titles are extreme — insignificant
or overly exalted — don’t bold them.

Revealing age negatively
Don’t blurt out your age. Start with ageless — you can always move to senior.
Do not put old education first on your resume (unless you’re a professional
educator). Avoid listing jobs with dates older than 10 or 15 years. If you must
include dusty jobs, de-emphasize the dates or omit them. You can summarize
old jobs under a heading of “Prior to 20XX” and avoid being too specific.
Alternatively, you can include all jobs under functional headings. Try not to
describe older jobs in detail.
Appearing low-tech
Seasoned aces who do not have computers still type resumes; others with
computers have old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Their resumes are often
stopped at the door. Today’s readers like crisp, attractive layouts that only a
computer and laser printer can create. Trade a dinner or two for resume ser-
vices from a friend, use a computer free at a library, rent a computer by the
hour at a copy center, or pay a professional to do your resume.
Not supplementing a high school education
If your highest education attainment is high school, don’t forget to mention
any continuing education, including seminars and workshops related to your
work — if it applies to what you want to do next.
Winning Interviews as a New Civilian
If you’re trading in military life for your first civilian gig, be sure to sign up for
the invaluable Transition Assistance Program (TAP), the three-day class that
helps active-duty personnel write resumes and prepare for interviews.
Experts say that a lot of young military retirees overlook TAP. As executive
search consultant Mike Dodd commented to Newsweek magazine: “[They’re
thinking] ‘I’m a gun fighter. I’m going to go out into the world and do great
things. I don’t care about resumes.’” Dead wrong.
Unless you’re partial to the school of hard knocks and reality bites, pay atten-
tion to this section. In it, I show you how best to present your military experi-
ence as you look for a civilian job.

Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

Quick take: Transitioning 
military strengths
You’ve got a chest full of selling points. Here are six super marks of merit:
 You have exceptionally good training. Military schools are recognized to
be superior institutions, and you’ve shown that you are trainable.
 You have substantial real-life experience. You may have things like high-
tech skills and leadership skills that you acquired at an early age and
that are not typically available to the civilian workforce. Maybe you man-
aged a troop and even advanced to a position responsible for policymak-
ing and strategic planning.
 You know how to be a team player and show up on time. You perform
well under pressure. You know how to accomplish assignments in a
structured organization.
 You may have experience with a direct fit to the civilian job market:
operations management, supply chain procurement, human resource
management, systems administration, or financial planning.
 You have a strong work ethic to get it right the first time.
 You’re flexible and able to quickly adapt to changing situations.
Quick take: Transitioning 
military soft spots
Communication is the biggest reason recruiters or hiring managers overlook
well-qualified military candidates, say career coaches who specialize in tran-
sitioning from military to civilian jobs. They just don’t get what your resume
says when you speak military-ese, not civilian-ese.
The military-talk habit is hard to shake. A news report describes an incident
involving a former soldier named Perkins who was transitioning to civilian
life after a 20-year hitch. Applying to a staffing company, Perkins spelled out
his last name in military alphabetic code: Papa-Eco-Romeo-Kilo-India-
November-Sierra.
The problems resulting from noncommunication when you use military-
ese (also called milspeak) on your resume are discussed in more detail later
in the section “Get the message about milspeak.”
166
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

When finished writing your resume, put it through the civilian translation
wringer by asking friends and neighbors who know not a whit about things
military to read it and see whether they understand what you’re talking
about.
Admittedly, some employers do hold a stigmatized stereotype of military 
service members as being rough, tough, rigid, and hard-headed types whose
idea of leadership is command and control. A resume won’t do much to alter
that perception, but if it’s well done will help get you inside an interview
room where your pleasing personality may be able to reverse false, precon-
ceived notions.
Tips for new civilians
Many employers do appreciate vets as employees and will give you prefer-
ence above a comparable nonvet competitor. The federal government awards
five to ten extra points beyond a passing score to veterans — good news if
you’re applying for a government position.
Government contractors hire a lot of former military members. That’s why
it’s especially important when preparing your resume to factor in the new
federal requirements in online recruiting processes designed to promote
equal employment procedures. Federal contractors must play by the rules
set by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP).
These rules favor customizing your resume for the position you’re targeting.
Specialty job boards, such as www.militarystars.com, now publicize the
fact that their online candidate databases meet the standards of the federal
compliance mandates announced in 2006 by the Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs. The new rules are a little tricky to understand, so turn
to Chapter 1 for particulars on how the new OFCCP mandates affect you. 
Here are other resume pointers to boost your cause.
Advertise what you’re selling
Avoid building your resume around your military rank or title. Instead,
emphasize the qualifications you bring to the employer.
Consider your best format
A hybrid resume (Chapter 5) is a good choice, say many career coaches who
work with transitioning military, because it features competencies and skills
in professional categories, rather than chronological history by rank or job
title. But this doesn’t mean a reverse chronological resume format can’t be
used to your advantage.
167
Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

If you’re working with a third-party recruiter, do as the recruiter — who is
carrying your immediate future in his or her hands — advises.
Zero in on job fairs
Job fairs are one of the most potent employment avenues for service mem-
bers and veterans to meet employers, network and even be interviewed on
the spot. The classified pages of your Sunday newspaper may carry big ads
announcing fairs; some are aimed at attracting transitioning military, espe-
cially individuals who have current top-secret clearances.
Check out the Web sites in the “Visit key Web sites” section in this chapter to
track military transition fairs.
Protect your identity from theft
Your Social Security number is the key to the vault for identity thieves.
Unfortunately, the military has been slow to give up its open and widespread
use of Social Security numbers for even routine transactions at commissaries
and base libraries. And then there’s the matter of the 2006 theft from the
Veteran’s Administration of records on almost everyone who has served in
the military since 1975.
Unless you’re applying for a federal job, which does require your Social
Security number, keep it off your resume, cover letter, or application form. 
If you suspect your data has been compromised, ward off identity theft by
monitoring your credit reports and putting a fraud alert or a freeze on your
credit accounts. The California Office of Privacy Protection’s Web site (www.
privacy.ca.gov) offers detailed information about the mechanics of com-
bating identity theft.
Be a resource collector
You deserve entire books dedicated to your special needs when transitioning
from military to civilian life, and luckily, good ones are available. Here are my
five picks:

Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases
Hey Uncle Sam — how about a job?
If you’ve ever thought about looking into a fed-
eral job, time’s wasting. Uncle Sam’s 1.7 million
civilian workforce averages 20,000 vacancies
every day. Benefits are handsome: great health
insurance, decent retirement plans, and flex-
ible leave. Annual pay raises — often 3 to 4 
percent — are automatic. You may not even
have to relocate. Although Washington holds
the mother lode of federal jobs, they exist 
as well in locales across America and even
overseas.
The number-one best way to spot a federal job
that may interest you is to land online at the offi-
cial USA Web site: usajobs.gov. You can
even search by salary. For instance, on a recent
day there were 11 jobs in Chicago in a pay range
of $35,000 to $45,000. A few examples:
Financial accounts technician, Veteran’s
Administration
Supervisory Contact Representative, State
Department
Adjudication officer, Homeland Security,
Citizenship & Immigration Services
Federal resumes are different
1. Federal resumes tend to be longer and
require information not typically found on a pri-
vate-sector resume, including: Social Security
number; citizenship; veteran’s information;
employers’ names and contact data; supervi-
sors’ names and phones; ending pay for jobs;
and hours worked per week.
2. Federal language is more bureaucratic 
than private-sector documents. Here’s how a
private-industry example is translated into 
government-speak:
Private industry: Prepare all levels of cor-
respondence, reports, and other docu-
ments. Make consumer-smart travel
arrangements for senior managers.
Government: Prepare a wide variety of
recurring and nonrecurring correspon-
dence, reports, and other documents. Make
travel arrangements, such as scheduling
transportation, making reservations, and
preparing travel orders and vouchers,
based on general travel intentions, known
preferences of traveler, and in accordance
with appropriate travel regulations.
Read the federal vacancy announcements
(recruitment advertisements) carefully to get it
right, and pay special attention to the qualifica-
tions and KSA (knowledge-skills-abilities)
requirements.
Find a specialist
For federal job employment help, my recom-
mendation is Kathryn Troutman. Widely
regarded as the go-to guru for job seekers
hoping to outmarket and outcommunicate the
competition for federal hiring, Troutman has

Get the message about milspeak
Bill Gaul, himself an Army veteran, is president and CEO of The Landmark
Destiny Group (www.destinygroup.com), a job board with a lot of benefits
for transitioning military members. A long-time expert on the military transi-
tioning job market, Gaul answers questions about demilitarizing your resume.
Q: Can you give an example of what you call milspeak?
A: An Army colonel’s resume we were recently sent read: “As commanding
officer of a 500-person organization, I was responsible for the health, morale,
and welfare of all personnel.” Health, morale and welfare? Just think of the
incredible range of skills and experience completely overlooked in that mils-
peak phrase. Far-reaching accomplishments and important responsibilities
are whitewashed into boilerplate terms that mean nothing to a civilian hiring
manager.
For example, digging into “health, morale, and welfare,” we found “policy
development, human resource management, budget planning and administra-
tion, process improvement, operations management, and staff development.”
Q: What’s the deal with job titles?
A: Many military job titles are ambiguous. Some are misleading. For example,
a Navy fire control technician does not put out fires but operates and main-
tains electronic weapons targeting systems.
Translate your job title without misleading the employer:
170
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

 Mess cook (food service specialist)
 Fire control technician (electronic weapons systems technician)
 Motor pool specialist (automotive maintenance technician)
 Provost marshal (law enforcement officer)
 Quartermaster (supply clerk)
Q: What about when your specific work experience doesn’t closely relate
to the job you’re applying for?
A: You can list your organizational position instead of your job title. An E-5
Marine Corps embassy guard applying for a management position in the
security industry listed his job title as “facility supervisor.” He then added
the details of his experience within the body of his resume. This drew read-
ers further into his resume because it represented more of a fit than someone
who kept people in proper lines applying for visas.
Q: Aren’t most military members in combat-related jobs?
A: Yes, and that can be a problem, trying to relate the job you’ve had to the
job you want, unless you’re applying for law enforcement positions. But for
the straight combat MOS (military occupational specialty) — infantry, tank
gunner, reconnaissance Marine, and the like — there are several options to
choose from:
List your relative position in an organization — “unit supervisor” instead of
“platoon sergeant” as your title.
Your work in collateral duties may be the key. A platoon sergeant seeking a
position in staff development and training, based on duty as a training NCO
(noncommissioned officer), could list training supervisor as her title. The
dates listed must accurately reflect the time you spent in the specific collat-
eral duties, of course. As you know, it is often the case that you will have
more than one collateral duty while performing a key role for an organization.
Q: How should you list your level of authority?
A: Omit references to rank or grade like “NCO, “petty officer,” and “sergeant.”
Unless an employer has military experience, these terms won’t communicate
your relative position within an organization. Instead, list civilianized equiva-
lents appropriate to your level of authority:
 Safety Warrant Officer OSHA (coordinator)
 Training NCO (training supervisor)
 Barracks sergeant (property manager)
171
Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases

Q: What about education and training?
A: Many courses and schools leave recruiters wondering exactly what you
trained for because the course titles can be esoteric and arcane. The rule is
this: List your training in a way that will provide immediately apparent sup-
port for your job objective.
If the name of a school or course doesn’t communicate exactly what was
taught there, modify it because you are trying to inform, not mystify. You are
trying to demilitarize the language to help resume reviewers understand the
nature of your military training.
These examples illustrate:
 SNAP II Maintenance School (Honeywell Computer Server Maintenance
School)
 NALCOMIS Training (Automated Maintenance and Material Control
System Training)
 Mess Management School (Food Service Management School)
 NCO Leadership Training (Leadership and Management Training)
Q: Is that all there is to civilianizing a military background?
A: Not quite. To help resume reviewers understand the depth of your train-
ing, list the number of classroom hours you studied. To determine the
number of hours, multiply the number of course days by 8, or the number of
weeks by 40. If you completed the course within the last 10 years, list the
competition date. If the course is older, leave off the date. Here are two 
examples:
 Leadership and Management Training, 3/07 (160 hours)
 Leadership and Management Training (160 hours)
Changing Course with 
an OnTarget Resume
You’re on the way to finding your new place in the world. Whether your new
place turns out to be a stopover or a long-term occupational address, smooth
your passage with effective traveling papers — that is, a core resume from
which you spin off targeted resumes.
172
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Keep polishing your work until your traveling papers are excellent. As famed
economist and author John Kenneth Galbraith said about the need to keep
writing until you get it right: “. . . there are days when the result is so bad that
no fewer than five revisions are required. In contrast, when I’m greatly
inspired, only four revisions are needed.”
Reflect on the stakes for your efforts to move along. By writing your transi-
tional OnTarget resume, you’re more than the author of your traveling 
papers — you’re the author of your life.

Chapter 9: Passages: Resumes for Your Life’s Changing Phases
Resumes going up to the top floor
Whether you’re seeking an executive position
as a move up from middle management or are
already in the executive league looking for
greener pastures, distinguish between the two
categories as you prepare your resume. That’s
the word from noted executive coach Dilip
Saraf (7keys.org).
Job seekers who are breaking out of middle
management levels should focus a resume on
technical successes — leading teams and
working across functional boundaries, Saraf
advises. He explains that job seekers already in
the executive space should focus on the four
functions of managing: leading, planning, orga-
nizing, and setting up controls.
If you have an eye on the top levels of the 
workforce — preferably at C-level (as in chief
executive officer or chief financial officer), this
book is useful to learn state-of-the-art resume
moves. But you do need additional coaching to
prepare high-end executive resumes, a spe-
cialized job market.
Arguably, the number-one authority on upscale
resumes is John Lucht, author of the classic
Rites of Passage at $100,000 to $1 Million+, pub-
lished by Viceroy. Lucht’s Executive Job-
Changing Workbook is a gold-standard guide 
to top-floor resumes. There’s more: Lucht’s
RiteSite.com is an excellent subscription
Web site for executives. Another upscale book
getting rave reviews is Executive’s Pocket
Guide to ROI Resumes and Job Search, by

hances are that not everything in your career history is a plus. 
Minuses — either fact or perception — like your age (be it a little or a
big number) and experience (whether too much or not enough) need special
care to keep them from setting off alarm bells. It’s always better to anticipate
factors in your background that could screen you out of the running and do
what you can to minimize them.
Nobody’s perfect. But rarely are we jammed up against problems so severe
that they can not be solved in some way. Careful resume management is a
good start.
Here are some ideas on how to turn lemons into lemonade.

Too Much Experience
Not only is inappropriate experience — too much or too little — often the
real reason that you’re turned down, but it’s also too frequently a cover story
for rejections that are really based on any factor from bias to bad breath.
Too many qualifications or ageism?
A reader writes that his qualifications for a training position are superior but
too ample. He explains:
Preoccupation with age seems to be the pattern. I’m rarely called for an
interview; when I call after sending a resume in response to an ad or a net-
working contact, I’m told I’m too experienced for the position — that I seem
to be overqualified. How can I keep my resume from looking like lavender
and old lace?
Ageism often is the subtext in the overqualified objection. Deal with it by lim-
iting your work history to the most recent positions you’ve held that target
the job opening. To avoid seeming too old or too highly paid, limit your
related experience to about 15 years for a managerial job and to about 10
years for a technical job. 
What about all your other experience? Leave it in your memory bank. Or if
you believe that the older work history adds to your value as a candidate,
you can describe it under a heading of Other Experience and briefly present it
without dates. Figure 10-1 is an example of a resume that shows recent expe-
rience only.
The recent-experience-only treatment doesn’t work every time, but give it a
try — it shows that you’re not stuck in a time warp, and it’s a better tactic
than advertising your age as one that qualifies you for carbon dating.
If the employer is notorious for hiring only young draft horses, rethink your
direction. Try to submit your resume to employers who can take advantage
of your expertise, such as a new or expanding company operating in unfamil-
iar territory.
What if the overqualified objection is just that and not a veil for age discrimi-
nation? The employer legitimately may be concerned that when something
better comes along, you’ll set a sprint record for shortest time on the job.

On the other hand, another version of rejection based on too many qualifica-
tions or ageism occurs when a candidate who qualifies for AARP membership
wants to kick back a bit and work at less demanding, lower-paying work. The
employer questions the applicant’s true intent — why would an older engi-
neer want a technician’s job? — and consequently doesn’t bother to inter-
view a candidate she suspects of seeking any port in a storm.
When you really prefer to take life easier physically or to have more time to
yourself, spell it out in your resume’s objective. Writing this kind of statement
is tricky. You risk coming across as worn-out goods, ready to relax and listen
to babbling brooks while you collect a paycheck. When you explain your
desire to back off an overly stressful workload, balance your words with a
counterstatement reflecting your energy and commitment:
Energetic and work-focused but no longer enjoy frenzied managerial 
responsibility; seek a challenging nonmanagerial position.
Too much experience in one job
A reader writes:
I’ve stayed in my current and only job too long. When my company cut 
thousands of workers, we received outplacement classes. I was told that job
overstayers are perceived as lacking ambition, uninterested in learning new
things, and too narrowly focused. What can I do about this?
Here are several strategies for meeting this issue head-on.
Divide your job into modules
Show that you successfully moved up and up, meeting new challenges and
accepting ever more responsibility. Divide your job into realistic segments,
which you label as Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and so on. Describe each level as
a separate position, just as you would if the levels had been different posi-
tions within the same company or with different employers. If your job titles
changed as you moved up, your writing task is a lot easier.
Deal honestly with job titles
If your job title never changed, should you just make up job titles? No. The
only truthful way to inaugurate fictional job titles is to parenthetically intro-
duce them as “equivalent to . . . .” Suppose that you’re an accountant and
have been in the same job for 25 years. Your segments might be titled like
this:
178
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

 Level 3 (equivalent to supervising accountant)
 Level 2 (equivalent to senior accountant)
 Level 1 (equivalent to accountant)
To mitigate the lack of being knighted with increasingly senior job titles, fill
your resume with references to your continuous salary increases and
bonuses and the range of job skills you mastered.
Tackle deadly perceptions head-on
Diminish any perception that you became fat and lazy while staying in the
same job too long by specifically describing clockless workdays: “Worked
past 5 p.m. at least once a week throughout employment.”
Derail the perception that you don’t want to learn new things by being specific
in describing learning adventures: “Attended six semesters of word-processing
technologies; currently enrolled in adult education program to master latest
software.”
Discount the perception that you’re narrowly focused by explaining that
although your employment address didn’t change, professionally speaking,
you’re widely traveled in outside seminars, professional associations, and
reading.
Highlight the issue
In a departure from the normal practice of omitting from your resumes rea-
sons for leaving a job, consider indicating why you’re making a change after
all this time.
Neutralize the issue burning in every employer’s mind: “Why now? Why after
all these years are you on the market? Kicked out? Burned out?” If the ques-
tion isn’t asked, that doesn’t mean it isn’t hanging out in the recruiter’s mind.
Even though you may be seen as a moss-backed antique, reveal yourself as
interested in current developments by adding this kind of phrase in your
objective:
Focusing on companies and organizations with contemporary viewpoints
In an even more pioneering move to solve the same problem, create a whole
new section at the tail of your resume headed “Bright Future,” with a state-
ment along the lines of this one:
Layoffs springing from a new management structure give me the welcomed
opportunity to accept new challenges and freshen my work life.

Too Long Gone: For Women Only
The reentering woman still has it tough. Usually, Mom’s the one who puts her
career on hold to meet family responsibilities. When she tries to reenter the
job market, by choice or economic necessity, she feels as though she’s been
living on another planet. A reader writes:
Employers don’t want to hire women if they’ve been mothers and out of 
the market for more than a year or two. Hey, ya know, for the last ten years,
I’ve worked my tail off! Don’t they understand that? Doesn’t intelligence,
willingness to work hard, creativity, attention to detail, drive, efficiency,
grace under pressure, initiative, leadership, persistence, resourcefulness,
responsibility, teamwork, and a sense of humor mean anything these days?
Every characteristic that this reader mentions is still a hot ticket in the job
market, but the burden is on Mom to interpret these virtues as marketable
skills:
 Grace under pressure, for example, translates to crisis manager, a valu-
able person when the electricity fails in a computer-driven office.
 Resourcefulness translates to office manager, who is able to ward off
crank calls from credit collection agencies.
 A sense of humor translates to data communications manager, who
joshes a sleepy technical whiz into reporting for work at 2 a.m. for emer-
gency repair of a busted satellite hovering over Europe.
You can’t, of course, claim those job titles on your resume, but you can make
equivalency statements: Like a crisis manager, I’ve had front-lines experience
handling such problems as electrical failures, including computer crashes.
If you’re a returning woman, use the tips in the following sections to develop
a great resume that connects what you can do with what an employer wants
done. Figure 10-2 gives you an example of how it might come together.

Don’t let too little experience kick you to the curb
When a job posting calls for a specific number
of years of experience — say, three years’
experience and you come up short with only
two years’ experience — but you know you 
can do the job, the basic technique is to work
with what you’ve got. Dissect your two years’
experience, and then add a statement in paren-
theses that says: (skills acquired equivalent to
three years’ experience). The expansion tech-
nique won’t work every time, but it’s worth the
gamble.

Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems

Sift through your past
Identify transferable skills that you gained in volunteer, civic, hobby, and
domestic work. Scout for adult and continuing education experiences, both
on campus and in nontraditional settings.
Reexamine the informative Web sites you’ve used, the educational television
programs that you’ve watched, and the news magazines that you’ve moni-
tored. Go to the library and read business magazines and trade journals, or
online if the ones you want are available without subscription.
Use professional terms
In recounting civic and volunteer work, avoid the weak verbs: worked with or
did this or that. Instead say collaborated with or implemented. The use of pro-
fessional words can help de-emphasize informal training or work experience.
Chapter 7 lists words to jog your memory.
Professionalizing your domestic experience is a tightrope walk: Ignoring it
leaves you looking like a missing person, yet you can’t be pretentious or
naive. Housewife dates you; family caretaker sounds more modern and better
describes your role. Refer to home management to minimize gaps in time
spent as a homemaker. 
Fill the home management period with transferable skills relevant to the 
targeted position. Examples range from time management (developing the
ability to do more with less time) to budgeting experience (developing a
sophisticated understanding of priority allocation of financial resources).
Other examples include using the telephone in drumming up support for a
favorite charity (developing confidence and a businesslike telephone tech-
nique) and leadership positions in the PTA (developing a sense of authority
and the ability to guide others).
Know the score
Gender bias lives, and, of course, you should omit all information that the
employer isn’t entitled to, including your age, marital status, physical condi-
tion, number and ages of children, and husband’s name. Even though the law
is on your side, in today’s interview-rationed job market, why drag in facts on
your resume that could stir up bias? Your resume’s job is to open interview
doors.
When you’ve been out of the job market for some years, you have to work
harder and smarter to show that you’re a hot hire. To help in your quest,
seek out seminars and services offered to reentering women.

Job Seekers with Disabilities
Millions of job seekers are protected by the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA), which makes it illegal for an employer to refuse to hire (or to 
discriminate against) a person simply because that person has one or more
disabilities.
ADA protection covers a wide spectrum of disabilities, including acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), alcoholism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, emotional illness,
epilepsy, hearing and speech disorders, heart disorders, learning disabilities
(such as dyslexia), mental retardation, muscular dystrophy, and visual
impairments. The Act does not cover conditions that impose short-term 
limitations, such as pregnancy or broken bones.
Generally, the ADA forbids employers that have more than 15 employees
from doing the following:
183
Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems
Selected home-based skills
Don’t overlook skills that you may have acquired
inside the home. Here are a few examples of
occupations in which they can be used. This
illustration assumes that you lack formal cre-
dentials for professional-level work. If you do
have the credentials, upgrade the examples to
the appropriate job level.
 Juggling schedules:
Paraprofessional
assistant to business executives or physi-
cians, small service business operator, dis-
patching staff of technicians
 Peer counseling: Human resources depart-
ment employee benefits assistant, sub-
stance abuse program manager
 Arranging social events: Party shop man-
ager, nonprofit organization fundraiser, art
gallery employee
 Conflict resolution: Administrative assis-
tant, customer service representative,
school secretary
 Problem-solving: Any job
 Decorating: Interior decorator, interior
fabric shop salesperson
 Nursing: Medical or dental office assistant
 Solid purchasing judgment: Purchasing
agent, merchandiser
 Planning trips, relocations: Travel agent,
corporate employee relocation coordinator
 Communicating: Any job
 Shaping budgets: Office manager, depart-
ment head, accounting clerk
 Maximizing interior spaces: Commercial-
office real estate agent, business furniture
store operator

 Discriminating on the basis of any physical or mental disability
 Asking job applicants questions about their past or current medical 
conditions
 Requiring applicants to take pre-employment medical exams
The ADA requires that an employer make reasonable accommodations for
qualified individuals who have disabilities, unless doing so would cause the
employer “undue hardship.” The undue hardship provision is still open to
interpretation by the courts.
If you have a disability that you believe is covered by the ADA, familiarize
yourself with the law’s specifics. The U.S. Department of Justice’s ADA home
page can be found at ada.gov. For even more information, call your member
of Congress, visit your library, or obtain free comprehensive ADA guides and
supporting materials from the splendid Web site maintained by the Job
Accommodation Network (janweb.icdi.wvu.edu).
Deciding whether to disclose a disability
Do not disclose your disability on your resume. Remember, your objective is
to get an interview. Save disclosure until a better time, if at all. Here are a
couple of guidelines for deciding when and whether to disclose a disability:
 If your disability is visible, the best time to disclose it is after the inter-
view has been set and you telephone to confirm the arrangements. Pass
the message in an offhanded manner: “Because I use a wheelchair for
mobility, can you suggest which entrance to your building would be the
most convenient?” Alternatively, you may want to reserve disclosure for
the interview.
 If your disability is not visible, such as mental illness or epilepsy, you
need not disclose it unless you’ll need special accommodations. Even
then, you can hold the disclosure until the negotiating stage once you’ve
received a potential job offer.
No matter what you decide to do, be confident, unapologetic, unimpaired,
and attitude-positive.
Explaining gaps in work history
What can you do about gaps in your work history caused by disability? In
years past, you may have been able to obscure the issue. No longer. New
computer databases make it easy for suspicious employers to research your
medical history. And with health insurance costs so high, they may do
exactly that.
184
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

If your illness-related job history has so many gaps that it looks like a hockey
player’s teeth, I’ve never heard a better suggestion than writing “Illness and
Recovery” next to the dates. It’s honest, and the “recovery” part says, “I’m
back and ready to work!”
If you have too many episodes of “missing teeth,” your work history will 
look less shaky in a functional format, discussed in Chapter 5. Online resume
discussion groups, which you can find through the Job Accommodation
Network (janweb.icdi.wvu.edu), can serve as further sources of guidance
on this difficult issue.
Asking for special equipment
If you need adaptive equipment, such as a special kind of telephone, I wouldn’t
mention it — even if the equipment is inexpensive or you’re willing to buy it
yourself. Instead, stick with the “time-release capsule” method of sharing
information: Dribble out those revelations that may stifle interest in hiring you
only when necessary. Never lose sight of your objective: to get an interview.
When Demotion Strikes
Kevin Allen (not his real name) was the district manager of five stores in a
chain when he was demoted to manager of a single store. The higher-ups
were sending him a message — they hoped he’d quit so that they could avoid
awarding a severance package of benefits. Kevin ignored the message,
retained a lawyer, kept his job, and started a job hunt after hours.
He finessed his resume by listing all the positions he had held in the chain,
leaving out dates of when each started and stopped:
Demoting Store Chain, Big City
District Manager, 5 stores
Store Manager, Windy City
Store Assistant Manager, Sunny City
Store Clerk, Sunny City
Throwing all of Kevin’s titles into one big pot seemed a clever idea, but it
didn’t work for him. After a year of searching, Kevin got interviews, yes, but
at every single face-to-face meeting, he was nailed with the same question:
“Why were you demoted?” The interviewers’ attitudes seemed accusatory, as
if they’d been misled. Kevin failed to answer the question satisfactorily and
didn’t receive a single offer during a year’s search. How did all the potential
employers find out the truth?
185
Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems

Among obvious explanations: (A) Kevin worked in a “village” industry where
people know each other and gossip. (B) Employers ordered credit checks on
him; credit checks show employment details. (C) Employers authorized back-
ground checks. 
No one knows what really happened, but in hindsight, Kevin may have done
better had he accepted the message that the chain wanted him out, negoti-
ated a favorable severance package that included good references, and quit
immediately while his true title was that of district manager.
After two humiliating years of demotion status, Kevin took action by “cross-
ing the Rubicon,” an ancient Roman phrase that universities have adapted. It
refers to those who seek a new beginning by returning to college for a law or
business degree. Kevin enrolled in law school. (A happy ending: Twelve years
later, Kevin is a happily employed attorney.)
In cases like Kevin’s, a strategy that’s forthright but doesn’t flash your demo-
tion in neon lights may work better than trying to cover up the demotion.
Combine only two titles together, followed quickly by your accomplishments
and strengths, as shown in Figure 10-3.
No matter how well you handle your resume entry, the reference of the
demoting employer may ultimately end your chances of landing a new job
that you want. In trying to mend fences, you may appeal to the demoting
employer’s fairness or go for guilt. Point out how hard you worked and how
loyal you’ve been. Find reasons why your performance record was flawed.
Ask for the commitment of a favorable reference and a downplaying of the
demotion. If fairness or guilt appeals are denied, see an employment lawyer
about sending the demoting employer, on law-firm letterhead, a warning
against libel or slander.
[dates] Demoting Company Name

186
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

The basic way to handle demotions throughout the job-hunting process is
akin to how you handle being fired: by accentuating the positive contribu-
tions and results for which you are responsible. But being demoted is trickier
to handle than being fired. Being fired no longer automatically suggests 
personal failure — but being demoted does.
Gaps in Your Record
Periods of unemployment leave black holes in your work history. Should you
(A) fill them with positive expressions such as family obligations, (B) fill them
with less positive but true words such as unemployed, or (C) show the gap
without comment?
Choosing B, unemployed, is dreary. Forget that! Choosing C, leave-it-blank-and-
say-nothing, often works — you just hope that it isn’t noticed. My choice,
however, is A: Tell the truth about what you were doing but sugarcoat it in a
dignified, positive way. A few examples: independent study, foreign travel,
career renewal through study and assessment.
An info-blizzard of tips has been published on how to repair resume holes.
Unless you were building an underground tunnel to smuggle drugs, the prin-
ciples are simple:
 Present the time gap as a positive event.
 Detail why it made you a better worker — not a better person, but a
better worker with more favorable characteristics, polished skills, and
mature understanding, all of which you’re dying to contribute to your
new employer.
How can these principles be applied? Take the case of a student who
dropped out of college to play in a band and do odd jobs for four years
before coming back to finish his biology degree and look for a job. The stu-
dent knows that employers may perceive him as uncommitted. In the resume,
he should treat the band years like any other job: Describe the skills that
were polished as a band leader. Identify instances of problem-solving, team-
work, leadership, and budgeting.
You do the real problem-solving in the cover letter that accompanies such a
resume. You might say something like this:
After completing two years of undergraduate study, it was necessary for me
to work to continue my education. Using my talents as a musician, I orga-
nized a band and after four years was able to continue my education. I
matured and learned much about the real world and confirmed that an edu-
cation is extremely important in fulfilling my career goals.
187
Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems

The chief mistake people make is assuming that a positive explanation won’t
sell. Instead, they fudge dates from legitimate jobs to cover the black holes.
You may get away with it in the beginning. But ultimately, you’ll be asked to
sign a formal application — a legal document. When a company wishes to
chop staff without paying severance benefits, the first thing that happens is
an intense investigation of the company’s database of application forms.
People who lied on their applications can be sent out into the mean streets
with nothing but their current paychecks on their backs.
Lying isn’t worth the risk — it’s a mistake.
Another method of papering-over glaring gaps is to include all your work
under “Work History” and cite unpaid and volunteer work as well as paid
jobs.
Suppose that you’ve been unemployed for the past year. That’s a new 
black hole. Some advisers suggest the old dodge of allowing the recruiter to
misperceive the open-ended date of employment for your last job: “2008–” 
as though you meant “2008@ndPresent.” The open-ender solution often
works — until you run into a reader who thinks that it’s way too calculating.
Black holes are less obvious in a functional format, which I discuss in
Chapter 5. In this final analysis, if you can’t find a positive explanation for a
black hole, say nothing.
If you possess a not-so-pristine past, stick with small employers who proba-
bly won’t check every date on your resume.
188
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 
The consultant/entrepreneur gap
Professional and managerial job seekers are
routinely advised to explain black holes by
saying that they were consultants or that they
owned small businesses. Not everyone can be
a consultant, and there’s substantial risk in the
small-business explanation.
If it should happen to be true that you were a
consultant, name your clients and give a glim-
mer of the contributions you made to each. If
you really had a small business, remember:
Employers worry that you’ll be too independent
to do things their way or that you’ll stay just long
enough to learn their business and go into com-
petition against them.
Strategic antidotes: Search for a business
owner who is within eyeshot of retirement and
wouldn’t mind your continuing the business and
paying him or her a monthly pension.
Resume antidotes: Describe yourself as “man-
ager,” not “CEO” or “president,” and if you have
time, rename your business something other
than your own name: “River’s End Associates,
Inc.,” not “Theresa K. Bronz, Inc.”

Too Many Layoffs That Aren’t Your Fault
Hard to believe, but good workers sometimes experience one layoff after
another. One of my readers wrote that he’d experienced four no-fault sever-
ances within seven years.
When you’ve been to the chopping block a few too many times, explain the
circumstances after each listing of the company name:
Carol Interiors (company closed doors) . . . Salamander Furnishings 
(multirounds of downsizings) . . . Brandon Fine Furniture (company relo-
cated out of town) . . . Kelly Fixture Co. (plant sold and moved overseas).
Offering brief explanations takes the blame from your shoulders — but I sup-
pose that a cynic could think that you’re a jinx.
Explaining Mergers and Acquisitions
A reader writes: 
Upon graduating from college, I went to work for Company A. Several years
later, Company A was acquired by Company B. More years passed, and
Company B was acquired by Company C. Eventually, Company C merged
with Company D, and as a result, after ten years with the four companies, I
was laid off.
My question is how best to handle this work history on my resume? I worked
for four different corporate entities, with four different names, without ever
changing jobs. Do I list all four on my resume? Or just the last one?
Always try to show an upward track record — that you acquired new knowl-
edge and skills, and just didn’t just do the same thing over and over each
year. And, you don’t want the reader to assume that you worked for only one
company that laid you off after a decade.
Taking these two factors into consideration, can you show correlation
between your job titles and responsibilities with the changes in ownership? 
If yes, identify all four owners:
Job title, Company D (formerly Company C), years
Job title, Company C (formerly Company B), years
Job title, Company B (formerly Company A), years
Job title, Company A, years
189
Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems

If you can’t show an upward track record that correlates with changes in
ownership, just use the current owner name with a short explanation:
Job title, Company D, years
(Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, the entities for which 
I have worked since college graduation were known as Company A,
Company B, and Company C.)
The reason for naming every entity is perception. Background and credit
checks will turn up those company names, and if your resume doesn’t men-
tion them, it sends up a red flag for your potential employer!
Here a Job, There a Job, 
Everywhere a Job, Job
I once interviewed a man who had held 185 jobs over the course of his 20-
year career, encompassing everything from dishwasher to circus clown and
from truck driver to nursing aide. He wrote to me, not requesting resume
advice, but to complain that a potential employer had the nerve to call him a
job hopper!
Talk about an antiquated term: In the 21st century, the notion of job hopping
is as far out of a reality circle as the concepts of job security, company loy-
alty, and a guaranteed company pension. The Great American Dumping
Machine will continue to sack people who sometimes have to take virtually
any job they can to survive.
Adding insult to injury, some employers cling to a double standard — hiring
and firing employees like commodities, then looking with disfavor on appli-
cants who have had a glut of jobs by circumstance, not by choice.
Overcoming a job-hopping image
Even when it wasn’t at your initiative, holding five or more jobs in ten years
can brand you as a job hopper. The fact that you’re out of work now under-
scores that impression. Even employers who are guilty of round after round
of employee dismissals instinctively flinch at candidates they perceive to be
hopping around.
Take pains to reverse that disapproval. When you draft your resume, post a
list of negative perceptions on your desk; when you’re finished writing, com-
pare your resume with the list. Offer information that changes negative per-
ceptions of you as a job hopper. The following list identifies perceptions
employers often have of a job hopper and ways to counter them.

Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems
Omit interview-killer data
The best way to handle some land mines on
your resume is to ignore them. Generally,
revealing negative information on a resume is a
mistake. Save troublemaking information for the
all-important job interview, where you have a
fighting chance to explain your side of things.
Stay away from these topics when constructing
a resume:
 Firings, demotions, forced resignations, and
early termination of contracts
 Personal differences with co-workers or
supervisors
 Bankruptcy, tax evasion, or credit problems
 Criminal convictions or lawsuits
 Homelessness
 Illnesses from which you have now 
recovered
 Disabilities that do not prevent you from
performing the essential functions of the
job, with or without some form of accom-
modation
Should you ever give reasons for leaving a job?
Almost never. In most instances, resume silence
in the face of interview-killing facts is still the
strategy of choice. But the time has come to
rethink at least one special issue: losing a job.
Now that jobs are shed like so many autumn
leaves, losing a job is no longer viewed as a
case of personal failure. It may be to your
advantage to state on your resume why you left
your last position, assuming that it was not
because of poor work performance on your
part. If you were downsized out, the recruiter
may appreciate your straightforward statement,
“Job eliminated in downsizing.”
A related circumstance is when it may appear
that you were fired (job tanked quickly, for
instance) but you really were not fired, or the
employer agreed to say you were laid off, it is
acceptable to add “Layoff” after the date of
employment — 3/2008 to 5/23/2009 (Layoff).
But remember, if you elect to say why you lost
one job, for consistency, you have to say why
you left all your jobs — such as for greater
opportunity or advancement.

 A fast learner: Give examples of how your skills aren’t company-specific
and you rapidly adjust to new environments.
 A high achiever: Show favored skills much courted by headhunters, and
at end of each job mention, put “Recruited for advanced position.”
 A quick adapter: Mention examples of agreeable flexibility in adjusting
to new ideas, technology, and position requirements.
 A relationship builder: List praise from co-workers for commitment to
team success.
If your current joblessness comes after a background that a quick-change
artist would admire, use your resume to prepare the way to acceptance.
Emphasize project completion and career progression, using years not
months. If you still have trouble landing interviews, use positive statements
in your cover letter to tackle your history.
Cleaning out your job closet
Large numbers of people have to write resumes that explain holding too
many jobs in too short a time. The harsh realities of business may force you
to detour from a single career path to alternative tracks where you can
acquire new skills and experiences, even if they’re not skills and experiences
of choice. If so, you need serious creative (but truthful) writing to keep your
resume focused on the work history that is relevant for the next job sought.
Use these workarounds when you find that you have too many jobs in your
history:
 Start by referring to your diversified or skills-building background.
 Use a functional or hybrid resume format (see Chapter 5) and present
only your experience relevant to the job you seek.
 Alternatively, you can list jobs relating to the position you now seek first
under “Relevant Work Experience” and cluster the nonrelevant jobs
under “Other Good Work Experience.”
 Express your work history in years, not months and years.
When Substance Abuse Is the Problem
Substance abuse is a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If
you’re recovered from the addiction, you’re entitled to all the Act’s protec-
tions. If you’re still abusing a substance, such as alcohol or illegal narcotics,
you’re not covered by the Act. Don’t disclose previous substance abuse on
your resume.
192
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Cover gaps in your work history with the Illness and Recovery statement (see
the “Job Seekers with Disabilities” section earlier in this chapter) or simply
don’t address the issue at all. 
Be careful when deciding which information you put on a job application —
remember that it’s a legal form and that lies can come back to haunt you (see
the “Gaps in Your Record” section earlier in this chapter).
If you were ever arrested for smoking pot or being intoxicated — even once
in your life — the fact may surface to damage your employment chances.
Asking about arrest records is illegal, but a few private database companies
don’t let that stop them — they compile electronic databases of such arrest
information and sell them to any employer who will buy.
Avoid mentioning booze or drugs, be careful about application forms, and be
honest at interviews — if you have recovered or if the experience was a brief
fling or two.
If you’re still held prisoner by a chronic, destructive, or debilitating overuse
of a chemical substance that interferes with your life or employment, no
resume tweaks will benefit you. Get help for your addiction.
A Bad Credit Rap
Job seekers who won’t be handling money are surprised that employers may
routinely check credit records. Credit histories — called consumer reports —
hold much more than payment history. A consumer report contains data
from names of previous employers and residential stability to divorces and
estimated prior earnings.
Employers are wary of hiring people awash in debt because they fear that
stress will impact job performance or that you have inadequate management
skills or even that you may have sticky fingers with the company’s funds.
Consumer reports have serious implications for students who graduate with
sky-high education loans and credit card balances, especially if they or their
families have missed payments. Divorced individuals may have interview-
killing credit problems caused by the split-up and never know why their
resumes aren’t delivering interviews.
Among consumer protections against unfair credit treatment is the require-
ment that employers must get your permission in a stand-alone document to
check your credit (Fair Credit Reporting Act) — no blending the request into
fine print in the employment application.
193
Chapter 10: Successful Solutions to Resume Problems

After an employer receives a report on you — but before any adverse action
is taken, such as rejecting your application for a job — the employer must
give you a free copy of the report with related legal documents. Receiving a
copy of the documents gives you a chance to correct mistakes and clean up
your credit record if you can.
Background checks are even more invasive than credit reports. They include
records for driving infractions, court and incarceration histories, workers’
compensation, medical histories, drug testing, and more. For details, visit
The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (privacyrights.org — search on
Background Checks).
Ex-Offenders Job Hunting
Each year nearly 650,000 individuals leave state and local prisons for the free
world. Another 11 million individuals yearly circulate in and out of American
jails and detention centers at the city and county levels. If you’re one of these
people, this book can help you — especially when it comes to meeting the
new need to customize your resume to a job or to the career field (described
in Chapter 1) — but you need specialized help of the type that I describe at
the end of this section.
Know that negative information 
is dangerous
Always remember that the purpose of your resume is to get a job interview.
Your resume is not the place to confess your sins, accentuate your weak-
nesses, or lie about yourself. Make sure your resume is future-oriented and
employer-centered. Use your resume to clearly communicate to employers
what it is that you can do for them. Issues concerning your criminal record
are best dealt with during the job interview.
Avoid the chronological format
The reverse chronological format (Chapter 5) is not your friend. This format,
with its ordering of employers and dates, tends to point up the two major
weaknesses of ex-offenders — limited work experience and major employ-
ment time gaps. Instead, choose a functional or hybrid combination format
(Chapter 5) that emphasizes your qualifications as they relate to the job you
seek — skills, competencies. and personal qualities.
194
Part II: Resume Basics That Wow ’Em Every Time 

Present your prison experience 
in nonprison terms
If you acquired education, training, and work experience in prison, be careful
how you list that experience on your resume. Instead of saying that you
worked at “Kentucky State Prison,” say you worked for the “State of Kentucky.”
Both statements are truthful, but the first statement immediately raises a red
flag that can prematurely screen you out before you get an interview.
Get help with your resume and job search
Unless you have strong analytical and writing skills, reach out for help from a
local nonprofit group that functions to assist ex-offenders in writing resumes
and finding jobs.
You also can hire a professional resume writer; find one at any of these three
organizations: parw.com, prwra.com, or nrwaweb.com. To check out other
re-entry resources in all 50 states, jump online to this gateway site: hire

tion related to ex-offenders is offered on exoffenderreentry.com.

Need encouragement? Michael Jordan, widely considered to be the greatest
player in the history of basketball, has a few words to say about the very
kinds of obstacles you may face in creating a great resume on your way to a
job interview:
Obstacles don’t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don’t turn around
and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.

N
o skeletons in your work history? No problems? If you’re as perfect as
they come, this is your kind of chapter. The sample resumes here
reflect the job market by type of expertise and work skills being recruited or
offered.
A box atop each sample resume contains a mission statement — that is, what
the job seeker aims to accomplish, which usually is a better job. The mission
statement also includes the requirements for a specific position — or a sum-
mary of the typically requested requirements for an occupation or career
field. You may be surprised that the requirements have numbers. And that
the numbers are cross-matched to qualifications in the resume. Does this
mean you are supposed to put numbers on your resumes as these samples
show? The answer is: No! No! A thousand times no!
The cross-matched numbers between a job’s requirements and the candi-
date’s qualifications shown here are for just for illustration, not for your actual
resumes.
These samples are intended to laser your attention to requirement-and-
qualification matching, the single most important factor in causing your 
candidacy to get noticed in an online swarm of resumes.

Chapter 12
A Sampling of OnTarget Resumes
by Experience Level and Age
H
ave reason to think that you have too much experience — or not
enough — to rack up the job offers you want? Or that you’re too 
young — or too old? Or that even when you’re barely out of your mid-40s 
(a kid, really), you’re stuck in low gear? The sample resumes in this chapter
show techniques aimed at downplaying negative perceptions about your
experience or your age.
A box atop each sample resume contains a mission statement — that is, what
the job seeker aims to accomplish, which usually is a better job. The mission
statement also includes the requirements for a specific position — or a sum-
mary of the typically requested requirements for an occupation or career
field. You may be surprised that the requirements have numbers. And that
the numbers are cross-matched to qualifications in the resume. Does this
mean you are supposed to put numbers on your resumes as these samples
show? The answer is: No! No! A thousand times no!
The cross-matched numbers between a job’s requirements and the candi-
date’s qualifications shown here are just for illustration, not for your actual
resumes.
These samples are intended to laser your attention to requirement-and-
qualification matching, the single most important factor in causing your 
candidacy to get noticed in an online swarm of resumes.

just that by deftly handling your special circumstances.
A box atop each sample resume contains a mission statement — that is, what
the job seeker aims to accomplish, which usually is a better job. The mission
statement also includes the requirements for a specific position — or a sum-
mary of the typically requested requirements for an occupation or career
field. You may be surprised that the requirements have numbers. And that
the numbers are cross-matched to qualifications in the resume. Does this
mean you are supposed to put numbers on your resumes as these samples
show? The answer is: No! No! A thousand times no!
The cross-matched numbers between a job’s requirements and the candi-
date’s qualifications shown here are just for illustration, not for your actual
resumes.
These samples are intended to laser your attention to requirement-and-
qualification matching, the single most important factor in causing your 
candidacy to get noticed in an online swarm of resumes.

A Sampling of Extreme 
Resume Makeovers
E
ach of five before-and-after sets of resumes in this chapter makes a spe-
cific point: bare-bones quick notes don’t make the sale; attention wan-
ders with too much (unusable) information; persuasive information grabs
attention; credibility grows when focus meets accomplishments; and white
space encourages readability.
A box atop each resume in this chapter contains a mission statement — that
is, what the job seeker aims to accomplish, which usually is a better job. The
mission statement also includes the requirements for a specific position — or
a summary of the typically requested requirements for an occupation or
career field. You may be surprised that the requirements have numbers. And
that the numbers are cross-matched to the qualifications in the resume. Does
this mean you are supposed to put numbers on your resumes as these sam-
ples show? No! No! A thousand times no!
The cross-matched numbers between a job’s requirements and the candi-
date’s qualifications shown here are just for illustration, not for your actual
resumes.
The samples are intended to laser your attention to requirement-and-
qualification matching, the single most important factor in causing your 
candidacy to get noticed in an online swarm of resumes.

Part IV
You’ve Sent 
Your Wow. What
to Do Now

In this part . . .
You’ve sent off your OnTarget resumes; is it time to sit
back and wait for the calls to start pouring in?
Hardly. Following up is an important part of getting the
interview, and in this part, I show you how to keep your
information safe, how to prepare your references to high-
light your assets, and how to be politely insistent about
getting your resumes read.

Chapter 15
References Safeguard 
Your Resume
In This Chapter
 Acknowledging the power of a lackluster reference
 Managing references to back up claims on your resume
 The care and feeding of your reference folder
 Overcoming toxic references that kill your resume efforts
A
nd just like that, the job offer goes missing. The one you thought was in
the bag. Chances are, if the job itself wasn’t cancelled or a background
check didn’t knock you out of the offer, you can blame your references for
shooting you down.
Although verifiable statistics are elusive, I’ve come across several startling
small-scale reference-checking surveys. The surveys assert that 50 to 64 
percent of all recommenders rate their subjects as mediocre to poor! Upon
reflection, I think the assessment could well be true. That’s because the man-
agement of references is the last frontier to be recognized as an activity vital
to promising career development.
The Harm Caused by a So-So Reference
A reference doesn’t have to be a broadside to sink your ship. A few of the
many subtle ways to wreck your chances include such seemingly innocuous
comments from reference givers as these:
 Oh, is she still working in this field?
 He gave my name as a reference?
 I can’t go into detail but she’s not eligible for rehire.
 (Long pause, followed by a disgusted tone of voice) Oh yes; I do 
remember him.

282
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 
Sometimes reference givers use the avoidance dodge — they simply don’t
return calls asking about your performance. (Employers aren’t legally
required to provide references.)
A little foresight on your part can help ensure that your references aren’t
wrecking your job search.
References are power hitters in the hiring process because they provide vali-
dation of your claims to be a superior performer and candidate.
We tend to view good references as entitlements, merely assuming they’ll be
there when we need them if we’ve done good work. Sorry, but that’s yester-
year’s thinking. Today’s thinking is more like “Trust, but verify.”
Managing your references — or, reference management — is a key factor in
managing your career. As a job search tool, reference management seems to
have soared to a new height during the past five years or so. There are sev-
eral reasons: the globalization of employment, a churning job market, and
increasingly risk-adverse employers who want to be assured again and again
that they’re making the right choices.
References aren’t resumes, but they are the subject of a chapter in this book
because as guardians that backstop resumes, references have become deal
breakers if not handled correctly. And after all the hard work on your
OnTarget resume, you don’t want that to happen, right?
Seven Things You Should Do 
about References
Now is a good time to rethink references and to consider how they hurt your
chances when they’re negative, or modest, or even positive but not con-
cretely connected to your aspirations. These pointers show you how to make
sure others sing your praises.
Ban references from your resume
Create a second document filled with the names, correct telephone numbers,
and addresses of references. Supply this sheet only when a potential
employer requests it. Don’t burn out your references by allowing too many
casual callers access to their names and contact information. Employers
typically don’t spend the time and money to check references until after
you’re interviewed and are on the short list of potential hires.

Sending reference letters with a resume to recruiters is not a good move,
advises Jim Lemke, this book’s technical reviewer. Recruiters are likely to
assume the letters are either bogus or written by close friends. Including a
reference letter with your initial submittal may make you seem desperate
(and that’s not good).
Expect employers to check references
In times gone by, employers didn’t always bother to check references. The
majority check now. Small employers still may not, but midsized and large
companies, afraid of making a hiring mistake, are taking aim on your past.
Rules vary slightly in different states, but employers can legally investigate
not only references but an applicant’s credit history, record of criminal con-
victions (not arrests), moving violations and accidents, performance at previ-
ous jobs, and workers’ compensation claims. Your state labor agency may
post the rules for your state on its Web site. If not, call the agency or consult
with a reference librarian.
When it’s no secret that you’re going to leave your current job, ask your com-
pany’s human resource specialist what the exact company policy is for pro-
viding references. You may find it’s essentially job title and employment
verification dates, and perhaps salary confirmation and whether you’re 
eligible for rehire.
You may discover that your company is outsourcing reference information to
private companies that charge a fee to prospective employers for your refer-
ence information. If that’s your company’s policy, try to get your work history
in writing before you leave your job, which will save a prospective employer
money, time, and irritation.
Choose references with thought
List references who have direct knowledge of your job performance. If neces-
sary, go beyond your immediate supervisor and include past or present co-
workers, subordinates, customers, suppliers, members of trade associations,
or anyone else who can praise your work. Don’t use relatives or friends for
personal references; they have no direct knowledge of your performance on
the job. (Exception: some job seekers, such as ex-offenders, may require per-
sonal references.)
What’s a good way to line up references? Skip this technique if you are doing
a secret search, but if it’s out in the open you can ask your boss whether he
or she will give you a good reference. Ask for particulars regarding how your
283
Chapter 15: References Safeguard Your Resume

boss sees your accomplishments, competencies, skills, strengths, and weak-
nesses. If your boss squirms and mumbles, you’re probably a sitting duck for
a less-than-glowing recommendation.
Checking out co-workers, you can say: “Terry Ann, I am beginning a job
search. Do you feel you know me well enough to provide a reference com-
menting on my skills in budget management?” If Terry Ann declines, it’s a
blessing in disguise to find out before giving her name as a recommender.
With the exception of your immediate boss, never — never — list a reference
until you have gained that person’s permission to do so.
Make a dry run: Have a brave buddy call your references to make certain that
no sly naysayers are hiding behind friendly faces.
Help references help you
Providing recommenders with your resume is standard operating procedure.
Go further: Write a short script of likely questions with a summary of persua-
sion points under each question.
In addition to general good words about your industriousness, creativity, and
leadership, focus on the industry. If you’re applying at a financial institution,
suggest that your references dwell on trustworthiness, conservatism, and
good judgment. If you’re applying at a high-tech company that has propri-
etary software and inventions, ask your references to stress your ethics and
loyalty.
Send a brief e-mail to recommenders identifying the qualifications you high-
lighted when you customized your resume for a given position (see Chapter 1).
Say “I hope you can work that qualification in if you have an opening.”
Although you don’t want to wear out your welcome and become a pest, try to
keep in touch with your references. Let them know how you’re doing. Take
them to coffee or lunch occasionally.
Cover your bases with a reference folder
A letter of recommendation isn’t particularly effective, but it is better than
nothing in cases where a company disappears, your boss dies, or the refer-
ence is difficult to reach. Begin now to collect praise in a reference folder,
also called a reference dossier. Routinely arrange for a reference letter when
you leave a job, as well as copies of your evaluation reports, and place them
in the folder.
284
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 

You can’t assume recommenders will come up with the points and words you
need, so you may have to draft the letters and statements yourself. Try to
have each reference cover a different qualification with some overlap for
emphasis. Tactfully offer to draft the letter to save your recommender time.
What else goes in your reference folder? Acclaimed Boston resume writer
Louise Kursmark recommends a page or two of endorsements — the quoted
actual words of several reference givers. 
“Each testimonial consists of about eight lines within quotation marks,”
Kursmark says, “topped by a headline lauding an achievement — ‘Trusted
Manager Driving Results through Better Consumer Communication.’ Each
statement is signed with the name, title, and company of the recommender.”
Use the endorsement sheets as follow-ups to your resume to gain an inter-
view, or to leave behind as reminders at interviews.
285
Chapter 15: References Safeguard Your Resume
Writing the recommendation
What do you say in a recommendation letter?
The reference giver verifies an individual’s
experience, affirms competence, and adds
credibility. A strong reference letter typically
does some combination of the following:
 Introduces the recommender, explaining
the recommender’s basis of knowledge for
the reference
 Confirms dates and job title(s)
 Identifies competencies, skills, and other
qualifications that make the individual an
ideal candidate for a potential employer
 Describes performance and attitude
 Highlights one or more exceptional qualities
with an example
Here’s an excerpt of an example highlighting an
exceptional quality I received in a letter from a
Toronto, Canada, reader:
Jane was able to develop her assertiveness
skills under my supervision. When she first
came into the department as a payroll clerk, she
was not as assertive as was necessary in deal-
ing with the other departments when they were
late submitting time cards and payroll informa-
tion. After taking an assertiveness course and
developing great self-confidence, Jane was
able to develop her conflict resolution skills and
she was promoted twice in the accounting
department before leaving the company to take
a manager’s position elsewhere. I highly rec-
ommend her for her willingness to work on
areas in which she needed improvement.
The above example — plainspoken and warmly
sincere — praises a quality of interest to all
employers: willing worker takes steps to
improve job performance.

Stamp out bad references
If you were axed or pressed to resign, or if you told your boss what you
thought of him and quit, move immediately to damage-control alertness.
Even if you were cool enough to obtain a letter of reference before you left,
you absolutely must try to neutralize the reference.
286
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 
A script to neutralize a damaging reference
Katie worked 18 months at a small company,
where she received consistently good write-
ups from the owner, but was fired by Jenny, a
supervisor who was jealous of Katie’s positive
relationship with the company owner. Katie’s
friend made some calls and verified that Jenny
was lying to prospective employers and telling
them that Katie didn’t do her job and wasn’t a
good employee. What should Katie do to
improve her reference from Jenny?
Tony Beshara’s inspired answer
Enter Tony Beshara, a top-flight placement and
recruiting professional in Dallas, who gave
Katie this terrific advice:
Katie should call Jenny, speaking in a very calm,
nonthreatening tone, saying that she under-
stands a bad reference is being given and that
the reference is closing doors to employment.
Katie nicely, but firmly, tells Jenny that this has
to stop.
If Jenny is unresponsive or won’t come to the
phone or return a voicemail — which is very
likely — Katie should write a letter to Jenny with
the same message and send a copy of it to the
owner of the company. Katie doesn’t have to
threaten litigation in the letter because any
business manager with common sense will read
between the lines that Katie’s next step is 
to sue.
Katie’s goal is not a total reversal of the nega-
tive evaluation but to obtain a neutral (but not
mediocre) reference from the ex-employer.
Additionally, Katie should call the owner and
explain the situation, saying that she doesn’t
want to cause any problems but wants to be
able to go to work. She should ask the owner to
be the one to provide future references since he
has first-hand knowledge of her work and she’s
only asking that he tell the truth. Katie should
remind the owner that she had been at the com-
pany for a year and a half, had a good track
record, good reviews, and until the particular
run-in with Jenny, everything had been smooth.
If she can’t get the owner on the phone, Katie
should write him a letter saying the same 
thing. The last thing the owner of a small com-
pany wants is a lawsuit over an employment
reference.
When all efforts fail
If every effort Katie makes fails, and she is dead
certain of an upcoming bad reference, Beshara
suggests she say to interviewers: “I do have
excellent references with every previous
employer. My last supervisor’s personality was
very difficult. I believe she will not give me a
glowing reference. Others in the company will
testify to my diligence and work ethic. I will pro-
vide those names and numbers. So if you check
references with my previous employer, please
check all of the people I was associated with
there.”
As a last resort, Beshara recommends that
Katie offer to work on a temporary basis for 90
days to prove herself, a willingness that along
with collateral good references, communicates
a brand of commitment that’s hard to resist.

Appeal to a sense of fair play or guilt. Sometimes, just saying that you’re
sorry and you hope that the employer won’t keep you from earning a living
will be enough. Sometimes it won’t.
When you’ve tried and failed to overcome a bad reference, you have three
options:
 Drown the poor reference in large numbers of favorable references.
 Find a lawyer who, for $200 or so, will write a letter threatening legal
action for libel or slander to the person who is giving you a bad rap. This
approach is surprisingly effective.
 Continue your job hunt, concentrating on small firms that may not check
references or that may be more inclined to take a chance on someone.
Thank everyone
When your job search is finished, remember your manners: Thank the people
who were willing to help you. Not only is it common courtesy but you never
know when you’ll need them again.
Finding References without Shedding
Your Cloak of Secrecy
You know that it’s smart to snare a new job before hanging it up at your cur-
rent position. But the Catch-22 is that you can’t give as references your boss
or other managers at your current company or your secrecy jig’s up.
You have two options for getting references while keeping your job search
under wraps: 
 Use the names of former supervisors at other companies, preferably
people you have kept in touch with and tipped off in advance about your
search as well as reliable contacts from professional organizations.
Don’t give the names of co-workers or current suppliers or vendors: You
can’t be sure they won’t inadvertently let slip that you’re on the market,
or even purposely curry favor with your management by whispering in
the boss’s ear.
287
Chapter 15: References Safeguard Your Resume

 Emphasize to prospective employers that your job search is confiden-
tial. When an offer looks eminent, say that upon receiving a signed offer
letter, you will be pleased to have the prospective employer check with
your current management and that if you don’t stack up as expected,
you understand the job offer is null and void.
Allow Enough Time for Skillful 
Reference Management
In this time-starved world, busy people may take longer than you expect to
come to your aid in perfecting a quality reference tool. When the timeline
between your request for a reference and the giver’s follow-through seems
stretched beyond endurance, it helps to remember that you give the tardy
reference a higher priority than does the recommender. A much higher 
priority.
Allow yourself plenty of lead time to drum up reference deliveries from
people who like you and would like to cheer you onward and upward, but,
well, it’s a busy life.
288
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 

Chapter 16
Twisting in the Wind? Follow Up!
In This Chapter
 Following up after sending your resume 
 Handling voicemail like a pro
 Punching through screens to talk to the boss
 Adapting sales techniques that really work
 Applying the Follow-Up Matrix to best use your time
You submitted your resume describing how you qualify for a targeted
position. It’s a work of art, a wow! Or so you thought. Four weeks have
passed and the silence is deafening. Except for an automated response of
receipt, you’ve heard nothing. Doesn’t anyone care? You do. The problem is,
you care more than the employer does.
I know that because I haven’t heard from a single employer complaining
about a lack of resumes. But the most-asked question I receive these days is
this one:
My online resumes have gone missing; what can I do about it?
The quick answer, assuming you didn’t set up your resume’s journey with
networking or employee referrals in advance (see Chapter 3), is to learn the
ropes of resume postsubmission and to follow up in ways you never had to
think about before.
Job-hunting dynamics have dramatically changed over the past half-dozen
years or so. Driven by the pull of market forces, and the push of government
rules, and made possible by advancing technology (as I explain in Chapter 1),
employers are having a hard time dealing with the zillions of resumes floating
around the Internet.
The old advice of a decade ago, including my own, is outdated. Forget about
amateurish messages that so politely ask someone who doesn’t know you to
call you back. Those were Clark Kent days. For job seekers, this is the
Superman age.

290
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 
This is the time to leap tall buildings doing battle for the job interviews you
want. This is the time to learn hard-hitting new tactics to turn the tide in your
favor. This is the time to get very serious about using resume follow-up as a
critical job search tool.
But, you ask, in an age where time is rationed, isn’t solid follow-up a time-
eating monster? Well, yes, it can be. Bird-dogging all of your resumes is time
consuming. That’s why, later in this chapter, I present a new time-saving tool
that you can use to selectively choose which resumes to chase and which to
relegate to second- and third-string opportunities.
Are you tough? Disciplined? Ready to charge ahead? If so, this chapter is for
you. In it, I suggest advanced tactics to reach out and snag interviews while
your competition stands slack-jawed at the side of the road watching you
make connections.
Why Follow-Up Efforts 
Are Essential Today
When employers and recruiters don’t see the benefits of spending time talk-
ing with you, they become masters of the game of “catch me if you can.” Even
if you do manage to talk your way through assistants and get managers on
the phone, they may be evasive, even brusque. Despite the risks of rude
receptions, learning the art of following up for something you want can be
one of the smartest things you ever do for the following reasons:
 Lightning strikes. Sometimes a hiring manager, who has been meaning
to fill a position but has been too busy putting out fires, responds favor-
ably to the candidate who happens to call on a day when the manager
has time to exhale. It’s a bit of the luck of the draw.
 Persistence produces. Some employers wait to judge which candidates
have the most followthrough by how well they follow up. This “test”
applies not only to sales but to other endeavors where a prized compe-
tence is the ability to “stay on top of things.”
 Control empowers. By learning and adapting the successful strategies
crack sales professionals use to set an appointment, you dramatically
reduce the amount of frustration, letdown, and low self-esteem you
could be feeling because you’re taking charge and doing everything you
can do.
The vast majority of employers — as many as eight of ten who use applicant
tracking systems (see Chapter 6) — send out an automatic response to your
application. The response says you’ll be contacted if you match a job opening.

The automatic response rate of independent recruiters is unclear, but if
you’re a potential candidate for a job opening they’re trying to fill, a recruiter
will call you fairly quickly; if not, you may get an autoresponse or no
response.
If you get a canned response, you won’t look like a quiz-show winner if you
call to ask a transparent question, “Did you receive my resume?” Duh.
Instead, say some version of the following script:
1. When an autoresponse message tells you that your resume has been
received, call the person to whom you sent it (usually a human
resources specialist) and ask what happened to it:
Was my resume a match for an open position? Was my resume
passed onto a hiring manager? Can you tell me which manager?
2. If you find out the name of the hiring manager, try to contact that man-
ager, because that’s who will quarterback the decision to hire you or not
hire you. (See Chapter 2 for more about how to reach the hiring man-
ager.) If you were referred by someone, such as an employee in another
department, use the following type of question:
My name is Kelly Novak and I’m calling you because Henry
Johannsen in engineering, who recommended that I send you my
resume, says that you intend to hire a top-of-the-line planner as
soon as possible. I’ve been able to design plans that were quickly
approved by the California Coastal Commission. Would you like to
talk with me before I leave on a scheduled vacation?
And if you don’t have a name to throw around, try a question like
this one:
I’ve had strong interest from another employer, which prompts me to
ask whether you had planned to contact me within the week? Your
company has a good reputation and I’d like to meet with you before
making other commitments. Does this week work for you?
Questions to Ask Yourself 
Before Following Up
When you’re uncertain about how to make employers and recruiters hear
what you’re saying and offer you an interview, plan your follow-up campaign
in advance. These questions and answers can help you fill in the blanks.
291
Chapter 16: Twisting in the Wind? Follow Up!

Should I phone or e-mail my follow-up?
Resume blasting rarely gets interviews. E-mail pitches rarely get interviews.
Most search experts agree with Jeffrey E. Christian, CEO of Christian &
Timers, a prominent executive search firm headquartered in Cleveland.
Christian explains that you shouldn’t spend time hiding behind technology
like e-mail and instead do three things: Call, call, and call. “The old-fashioned
personal call is the new way to go these days,” Christian advises.
You may argue with that judgment, noting that you lose your nerve and don’t
come across as accomplished and confident and so you should stick with
e-mail. You think some “shy” people just can’t sell themselves on the phone
even if they can sell other things.
You may be right. Telemarketing yourself is tough stuff. So is getting yourself
recognized on the Internet. You probably need help from others in overcom-
ing telephonophobia.
You might gather several jobless friends and practice on each other. Or go
way out and take a temp job as a telemarketer to become somewhat desensi-
tized to rejection after rejection. You may never become really comfortable
pitching yourself, but at least you won’t faint or fold when you’re told to “get
off this phone and never call me again!”
The consensus of specialists in job search and sales is that human voices are
more persuasive than e-mail messages. E-mail can, however, pave the way for
your phone call. You might address a hiring manager and say:
My proven background in supply chain management looks like a good fit for
your advertised requirements and my qualifications for the assistant man-
ager position. I’m unsure whether you’re at the interview phase yet but I
would be delighted to answer any preliminary questions you may have. I’ll
call you tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
What if the ad says “no phone calls”?
Call and call again. You’ll get your share of hang-ups and rude responses
(“Can’t you read, you cluck?”), but you’ll also get some positive responses.
When you’re told to bug off, be ready with an immediate hook that grabs
attention:
I understand you don’t want to be swamped with unqualified candidates, but
that’s not me. My team cut inventory losses by 30 percent in nine months. I
was a key team member and I’m ready to make similar savings happen for
you. My accomplishments and future value to your company are much too
good to pass up. Can we talk sometime this week?
292
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 

Your challenge is to prepare a memorable, brief statement — a sound bite —
designed to melt a hiring manager’s frosty no-calls defense shield. Promise
good things but avoid specifics until you’re interviewed.
If you’re stonewalled by a gatekeeper — administrative assistant or HR 
specialist — with a no-calls defense shield, you can modify your response to
push for an interview or a good time to call back. More likely, you’re going to
have to skirt the gatekeeper by calling before and after the workday hours
when screeners aren’t so likely to be answering the phone.
What is the most powerful opening 
statement I can make?
The most powerful message to launch your call is to immediately mention
the name of someone who referred you, someone who the hiring manager
cares about. This may be a company executive, company employee, client,
fellow professional, family member, lodge brother, and so on.
Jim Lemke, this book’s technical reviewer, says that the second most power-
ful statement is to start out by mentioning that you’re currently working for
or recently left the employment of a major competitor.
What are other compelling 
opening statements?
Your accomplishments and results in past jobs or endeavors are what give
your pitch a critical edge. Here are several examples:
In my current position, I led a team to develop new sales strategies which
this year boosted each store’s sales by $90,000 per month.
I was vice president of the campus economics club – second in leadership
for 45 members. Our competitive project, which I chaired, was rated tops in
a national competition.
When my employer’s offshored customer service experiment failed, the
department was recalled to Florida. I put in place a new process to handle
complaints that boosted customer satisfaction by 45 percent.
After making your accomplishment opening statement, follow with a request
to meet face to face: “If you’re interested in knowing more about that, can we
schedule a time when I could come in for a short talk?”
293
Chapter 16: Twisting in the Wind? Follow Up!

How much information can I find out 
from a central phone operator?
If the company you’re calling employs a central phone operator or reception-
ist, you may get lucky and find out the very information you need from that
individual to follow up on your resume.
One road block: Companies sometimes slam on an information freeze that
forbids releasing the names of their employees. The companies train people
who answer phones to conform to the no-loose-lips policy. (Read the next
question for some ideas on how to counter an information freeze.)
In many offices, the central phone operator is a welcoming individual who’s
probably treated like a robot and will buy into an approach that recognizes
her or his inner human being. Be friendly, and then say something like this:
I’m sure the incoming calls keep you hopping, so please put me on hold
when you find it necessary. Please tell me, who is the manager for the new
product marketing department? Oh thank you. I appreciate your help. And
could you also tell me who the manager reports to? Thanks a billion.
If you’re bonding with the central phone operator — you may be the only real
conversation the operator has in a long day of fielding call after call — go for
broke. Ask for the manager’s secretary’s name, best time to call, how to pro-
nounce the manager’s name and does the manager work early, late, or week-
ends. Aim to uncover your target’s direct telephone number — or his
extension number, from which you can figure out the direct line.
Now you can use the old top-down approach: Call the manager’s boss, who
will probably refer you to the manager. But now when you call the manager
you say you’ve been referred by his boss, which will get you more respect.
What are some tips to get past 
screeners, a.k.a. gatekeepers?
Start with a charm offensive on every gatekeeper you encounter. Leave con-
frontational behavior to amateurs. Think of gatekeepers as human toggle
switches that either pass you on to your target or off to oblivion.
Try the following phone techniques that have been worked out by legions of
successful salespeople and recruiters since the telephone was invented:
 Name identification: When you don’t know who the hiring decision-
maker is, start easy by just asking a receptionist: “I’m trying to locate
your company’s sales manager for Western Ohio. Who is that, please?”
294
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 

If the decision-maker’s name is protected like a national security asset
and you know the easily found extension for the sales department 
(ext. 123), call related extensions (121, 122, 124, and 125) and say to
anyone who answers, “Oh gee, I was trying to call the sales manager.” An
employee untrained in the use of no-loose-lips scripts may tell you what
you seek.
 Readiness alert: Be prepared with your elevator speech (30-second
summary of who you are and your selling points for the target jobs) in
case the sales manager answers one of your calls.
Breaking through digital walls is easier when you realize that gatekeep-
ing scripts don’t vary much; almost all require your name, company, and
purpose of call before the gatekeeper decides what to do with you.
 Ideal screen buster: The best tip is sailing in on the wings of a mutual
acquaintance: “This is John Jason. Tim Pitman, a fellow professional of
your boss, thinks your boss and I should talk.” If coattail wings aren’t
available, throw a curve ball into the gatekeeper’s script and take charge
of the conversation. Do it by interrupting her script. Sound confident.
Use first names.
You: Good morning. To whom am I speaking?
Gatekeeper: This is Lois.
You: Lois, good morning. This is John Jason calling for David.
Effect: You interrupted the script! The gatekeeper may assume you
work in the company or are an approved vendor and pass you on.
295
Chapter 16: Twisting in the Wind? Follow Up!
What’s behind the no-loose-lips policies?
Reasons central phone operators are trained
not to give out employee names range from
concerns about employee privacy to concerns
about employees wasting time on nonproduc-
tive phone calls. The most colorful reason is
aimed at preventing competitors from raiding a
company’s best talent.
Here’s the inside story: Some recruiters have
made an art form of spinning fictional tall tales.
The tales are deceptions fed to receptionists to
pry out names of skilled employees whom the
recruiters wish to pirate for their own clients.
The fiction is called “pretexting” or “rusing.”
The pretexts can be wild and barely believable
but are delivered with seeming sincerity. For
example, a recruiter calls a receptionist and
begins the ruse:
One of your nuclear engineers left me a
message that he said was urgent but 
my daughter wrote it down in invisible ink
and I could read only part of it — Bob or Bill
Something — before the dog lapped it up —
big vet bill — and I wonder whether you
can think who it might be? Who in your
nuclear engineering department could have
called me?
Recruiters who’ve gone “rusing” in the past tell
me it works more often than you might think.

When you suspect a first-name-only approach is too cheeky for the situa-
tion, modify: “Can I speak to David (small pause), David Wintergate?” If
the gatekeeper asks you to repeat who is calling, use the same formula:
“John (small pause), John Jason.” The implication is that you know each
other.
But what if the gatekeeper is super diligent and wants chapter-and-verse
detail on your call’s purpose? Try this:
Lois, I appreciate why you’re asking that question. You see, my call
involves confidentiality concerning my mastery of a business process
in which David has expressed a current interest. I believe that needs
to start with David and we can move forward from there. Please con-
nect me. Thank you. (Say “thank you” often.)
 New good buddy: By being friendly, sincere, warm, and humorous, and
asking for help, you may convert the gatekeeper to an ally.
When asked for your company connection; say:
I’m calling as an individual today.
When asked why you’re calling, skip phony reasons like “It’s a personal
matter.” That wheeze falls on deaf ears. Instead, research pays:
I understand that your boss has a mandate to cut costs. I’ve had seri-
ous experience with cost trimming, saving 10 percent and more. I
think he’d get value in speaking with me for a few minutes. I need
your help in arranging to speak to David.
The “I’m here to help” approach allows the gatekeeper to present you as
a solution to the hiring manager’s problem, not as a pesky job hunter.
Similar to the patter you use with a central phone operator or reception-
ist, encourage your newfound mentor/coach to name the best and worst
times to call, how to pronounce the boss’s name if it’s unusual, and for
the boss’s e-mail address. You’re building rapport.
Send the gatekeeper a note of appreciation, or perhaps an e-card from a
commercial online greeting card service. 
What can I do if I keep getting 
booted to voicemail? 
When you can’t break through voicemail, leave a short message showing
upbeat interest, not desperation — and a time when you will call back.
My name is Maureen Farmer, and I’m calling you because I’ve successfully
outgrown my job, and you have a reputation for running a progressive
department. I think you have my resume. If you like what you see, can we
talk? I’ll call you tomorrow morning at 11:30 to set a convenient time.
296
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 

Pronounce your name clearly and say your telephone number at a moderate
pace. Give the hiring manager a chance to write it down without replaying the
message. Otherwise, the manager hears a “garbledrushofwords” and decides
“Idon’thavetimeforthis, and moves on.
How often should you call? Some very smart experts suggest calling every
five to ten days until you’re threatened with arrest if you call again. But busy
employers insist that — unless you’re in sales or another field requiring a
demonstration of persistence — after you’re certain your resume was
received, call one to two weeks later, and then no more than once every three
to four weeks.
Although you don’t want to become a pest, the volume of resumes in the New
Era job market is turned up beyond rock-concert level. If your decision is
between not being a pest or being ignored, tilt toward more follow-up.
Following up by phone is your most effective tool, but you can, from time to
time, substitute contacts by sending notes or e-mail with additional facts
about your qualifications, ideas to solve a problem you know the company is
facing, a news clipping of mutual interest, or just an expression of our contin-
uing interest in working for the company and the manager.
Is your telephone number blocked from caller ID? Two dozen hang-ups make
you look decidedly uncool.
Why shouldn’t I leave a message asking
the target to call me back?
Because “They’re not going to do it,” says sales expert George R. Walther,
author of Heat Up Your Cold Calls (Kaplan Publishing, 2005). Speaking from
the sales trenches, Walther explains that when you wash out on your first
voicemail call, it’s a big mistake to leave your name and number and ask
employers to call you back. Instead leave a very brief message indicating that
you will call again at a specific time. You may have to make a dozen calls
before connecting, each time again giving a time frame for your next call. The
trick, Walther observes, is to
 Set a specific time and keep your word, which makes you look like a reli-
able person.
 Use phrases that prevent the target from feeling “guilty” for missing your
call after call. (“Please don’t feel bad about missing my call. Afternoons
may be better for you . . .”)
Find a hook for each time you call back. Here are examples from executive
search firm guru Jeffrey Christian, who says it’s a good idea to make each
message cite a different accomplishment:
297
Chapter 16: Twisting in the Wind? Follow Up!

 Monday: Sorry I missed you; I’ll try again Wednesday afternoon. I’m
hoping to meet and go into detail about my sales channel strategy,
which could work very well for you.
 Wednesday: Too bad we missed connecting today. I’ll get back to you
tomorrow to explain how I worked the lost-customer database and
reclaimed 38 percent of them as paying customers. Until tomorrow, 
then . . .
 Thursday: You undoubtedly have your plate full, which is why you need
to meet with me — I’m persistent and I follow through. I’ll get back with
you next week. I want to help.
How can I keep track of all my calls,
e-mails, and contacts as I follow up?
You can fall back on the usual suspects: notebooks, card files, Excel, or
another computer spreadsheet program.
Alternatively, you can use a new Web-based program called JibberJobber
(www.jibberjobber.com), which at this writing is free. JibberJobber allows
you to enter information about your job search and not have to worry about
how to set up or design the organizational system. You have to play around
with it a little to get started, but you need not be technically minded.
When is it time to throw in 
the towel and move on?
Suppose you do reach the hiring manager but just can’t close the interview
invitation. Salvage something of your time and effort. Ask the “Who should I
call?” question. Does the manager, whom we’ll name Buz Shore, know anyone
at another good company who might gain by talking with you? You begin that
call with a referral: “Buz Shore over at Top Ship suggested we might meet for
a discussion of mutual benefit.”
Or suppose you never reach the hiring manager despite your dedicated
effort. When is it time to say I’ve done all I can do and I’ll explore other
opportunities?
I asked Tony Beshara that question. Beshara is the author of The Job Search
Solution (AMACOM Books, 2006). A dynamo, Beshara runs Babich and
Associates, one of America’s most successful job placement firms, and has
years of experience in working follow-up campaigns.
298
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 

Answering the question about when it’s time to give up and pursue other
opportunities, Beshara shared his rule of thumb: “I move on after about 15
calls spread out over two months.”
Monitoring Your Follow-up Efforts
When you’ve sent out a boatload of resumes and are hardly, if ever, contacted
for a job interview, you know it’s time to power up your follow-up.
Now the big question becomes how much time you should spend on each
follow-up mission. You could make a trip to Mars faster than you could chase
after all your resume submissions. You may even be thinking that the old
80/20 rule, which says only 20 percent of your job search activities produce
80 percent of results, applies to resume follow-up.
Frankly, I don’t know whether the 80/20 rule has any merit here. But I am sure
you should be selective about the efforts you make for each resume submis-
sion. Here’s an idea.
Figure 16-1 shows a Resume Follow-Up Matrix. It’s a tool you can use to make
objective and comparative judgments about which resume submissions offer
you the biggest returns for your time investments.
The Matrix, which was created by James M. Lemke, this book’s technical
reviewer, and John S. Gill, my technical associate, allows a simple, easy com-
parison of jobs for which you’ve thrown your hat in the ring. It spotlights the
most promising jobs for you personally that you should pursue quickly, and
tags the less promising jobs that can wait until you have time on your hands.
Using the Follow-Up Matrix
The Follow-Up Matrix is divided into six main factors. The factors are divided
into five value levels ranging from 0 to 4 (see the Values Key). The values are
based on the presumed quality of the position for which the resume was 
submitted.
You won’t have all the information for each category. You may have to make
some educated guesses. But if you follow the New Era strategy of customizing
your resume to each position, you’ll have more than normal research at your
fingertips.
The values inserted in each category of the Matrix are subjective. If you dis-
agree with the examples, substitute your preferences to reflect your views
about what’s hot and what’s not about any new position.
299
Chapter 16: Twisting in the Wind? Follow Up!

Figure 16-1: The Resume Follow-Up Matrix.
Additionally, you can change the point values in any category to suit yourself.
If, for example, avoiding commuter stress is overwhelmingly important to
you and you’re willing to accept less in every other factor (like pay and train-
ing) for a job that’s ten minutes from your residence, add 5 to 10 points to the
neighborhood job.
Factors on the Follow-Up Matrix
The following are some considerations that you may want to keep in mind
when mulling over your options.
 Fit: How well do your qualifications align with the position’s stated
requirements? For example, if there are six requirements, how many can
you match with qualifications?

 Company/Industry: Does the employer’s focus reflect your own inter-

 Salary/Benefits: Does the compensation package, if revealed, fit within
your desired range? When you can’t find out, award average points. Visit
www.salary.com to get an idea of what the position should pay. Does
the company pay college tuition?
 Training: Working with a progressive company that has the latest tech-
nology and generous training opportunities helps keep your skills up to
date and marketable.
 Location: In your area, the time, stress, and expense of commuting are
factors. If you must move to another section of the country, consider
relocation (relo) costs and who pays them, as well as the availability of
housing and transportation, and the quality of schools, recreational
facilities, and lifestyle.
 Personal Factors: Figure out what counts most with you and switch the
values to conform to those things. Working mothers might choose to
keep “Telecommuting and Life/Work Fit” as the top value. Baby boomers
might value “flexible hours or part-time work.” It’s your call.
If you sent a resume for a job that you give 4 points in each of the six cate-
gories, that’s 24 points and you should run, not walk, to follow up on that
winner. By contrast, if you sent a resume for a position that you give only 1
point in each of the six categories, depending on what else is on your plate at
the time, you may want to exert a minimum of effort to follow up on that
loser.

Fast-Tracking Your Successful Follow-Up
Although following up does take an investment of your time, it need not suck
all the oxygen from your life’s free hours. The Resume Follow-Up Matrix
encourages smart time management while reminding you that good things no
longer come to he or she who waits.
Often the wait is longer than you expect. Many people think the hiring cycle
is about 30 to 45 days, when the actual figure is closer to 90 to 120 days, say
veteran job placement experts. 
Any number of things delay decisive employment action: The first choice
candidate backs out, employers change their priorities while dealing with a
crisis, management freezes budgets, hiring managers go on vacation, or
rumors surface of an impending merger, to name a few.
Job seekers who diligently follow up resume submissions sometimes dis-
cover that on their fifth or sixth call to a target company, seven or eight
weeks later, that the company’s interviewing process has risen from the dead
and given new emphasis. There you are, metaphorically speaking: on the
right street corner at the right time when the right bus comes along — and
you get on the bus.

S
o you’ve sent out your resumes and been tapped for an interview. Now
it’s merely a matter of the where and when. At this point, nothing can
monkey-wrench your meeting. Or can it? The inconvenient answer is “yes.”
Countless factors that are beyond your control — such as a sudden budget
crunch that kills the position — can derail your home-stretch run for promis-
ing interviews.
Fortunately, most of the accidents waiting to happen are small things you can
control. Unfortunately, even small missteps can have a big bad impact. To
make sure you don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, here are five illus-
trations of developments where little things mean a lot to your future.
When Your Job Conflicts 
with an Interview Date
You’re employed, with a hectic job, which is one reason you want to make a
getaway. A recruiter contacts you with an interesting interview request to
meet with a hiring manager. The problem is the manager wants to meet with
you during a busy work day.

306
Part IV: You’ve Sent Your Wow. What To Do Now 
If you have no vacation or other leave time available and you’ve replaced
every tooth in your mouth, your best option is to frame your proposal for a
night or weekend meeting in terms of your honorable work ethic:
I am excited about meeting with Harry Lucas but, in good conscience, I can’t
cheat my current company and take a work day off to do so right now.
My management is counting on me to complete a company-wide inventory
all next week. When I sent you my resume as a candidate for your open
technical service position, I knew that I am probably a close match for the
job. Your position requires A, B, and C. And, as you noted on my resume,
I have a dozen highly productive years’ experience in A, B, and C. Can we
possibly set up an early evening meeting, say Tuesday or Wednesday?
Should an emergency arise at your present job requiring you to change an
interview time, use the same approach — you’re a conscientious employee
and never let your team down. Just remember, rescheduling an interview
once is risky; twice is fatal.
Face-to-Face Beats Ear-to-Ear
Telephone interviews are screening interviews to find out whether you’re
worth the investment of time that a regular interview requires. You aren’t
going to be hired for a good job until you get in the same room with a person
who has the authority to hire you. That’s why even in a formal telephone
interview with a screener you should keep pushing for a face-to-face interview.
One way to earn a face-to-face interview is to hold back on a few key ques-
tions to give the decision-maker a reason to see you. Decide in advance
which likely important questions you’ll use to leverage a meeting with a
hiring authority, who typically is the manager to whom you would report. You
might say something like this in response to a question:
With my skills in management, it’s one that I feel I can’t adequately answer
over the telephone. Can we set up a meeting so that I can better explain
how my qualifications dovetail with your stated requirements? I’m free on
Tuesday morning. Is that a good time for you?
Whenever possible, avoid answering employment questions on a mobile
phone; they have a propensity for audio mishaps. (“Can you hear me now?”)
Say you’ll call right back on a landline.

Going Overboard on Ardor 
Can Cost You Money
Accepting an interview invitation is cause for celebration. But when you’re
making the interview arrangements, be friendly and agreeable, warm and
pleasant, but show a little restraint. Exhibiting thrilled, puppy-dog excitement
and face-licking gratitude can plant the idea that you’re desperate and willing
to accept below-market-rate pay, as well as raise doubts about why you’re
desperate for new employment. Set up the interview appointment as though
you’re looking forward to it but not because you “need” the job.
Zeal and youthful enthusiasm work well for young graduates but not so well
for job seekers over the age of 25. It’s a negotiation issue.
When the Interview Is Out of Town 
If a company contacts you and requires an out-of-town interview, the com-
pany should pick up the tab.
If you made the contact, the issue is murkier. A cool way to find out who will
pay travel costs for you to travel for a company-site interview is to finesse
the question. Here are two examples:
Should I contact your company’s travel department or do you use an outside
travel agent?
Will your company be making the travel arrangements for me?
If you’re on your own for travel costs, your decision may be difficult. It helps
if the interviewing location is in a pleasant spot and you can combine your
trip with a little vacation (ask your tax adviser if the travel is deductible).
If you’re a starving college senior or a new graduate, you can get away with
pleading poverty, saying you’d love to come see them in a city far away but
that you spent your last dime getting the quality education that qualifies you
as a candidate for employment by the target company.
Schools and nonprofit organizations may have a policy requiring all candi-
dates to pay their own interview travel expense. Don’t reject the interview
invitation outright; accept it. You can always cancel later.

Chapter 17: Almost Got the Interview Date? Read This First

Take stock of your situation and determine whether you can make the trip
work: Do you have a friend or family member who will welcome you as a
guest? Can you get a cheap flight? Can you double (or triple) up and inter-
view with other prospective employers in the area?
Making the Most of Your Moment
You seem to be the candidate of the hour: Four companies are requesting
your presence for an interview — all in the same week! What a happy
dilemma, you say.
And it is, particularly because you can put yourself in the best position 
possible — and get a little interviewing practice — if you utilize the following
strategy:
1. Review the Resume Follow-Up Matrix in Chapter 16.
2. Rank the four companies from one to four, with one being your top
pick.
3. Interview with numbers three and four first, and one and two last.
Not only will you be in interviewing mode by the time you talk with your top
picks, but companies number three and four may make you an offer that you
can use to leverage a quicker decision by your top choice.
Prioritize and set up your interviews quickly. If you don’t move fast enough to
schedule an interview, an employer who’s impatient to fill the position may
make a choice before seeing you. It’s unlikely, but possible.
Little Things Do Mean a Lot
When the interview you want is within grabbing distance, you’ll have other
issues to address and choices to make — some of which may seem insignifi-
cant. Try not to ignore the small stuff. It can come back to bite you.

 Not pussyfooting around about what you’re applying for
 Finding success in the 5 percent rule
T
hink your resume could sparkle with a few tweaks? Here are ten easy
fixes to power up to OnTarget status.
Match Your Resume to the Job
To dart past job software filters, a resume must closely meet the require-
ments in the job description. If you know what company recruiters are look-
ing for, make sure you put it in the top quarter of your resume. If instead
you’re posting your resume in databanks, research the career field for typical
requirements and include those that apply to you.
Use Bulleted Style for Easy Reading
Using one- or two-liners opens up your resume with white space, making it
more appealing to read. Professional advertising copywriters know that big
blocks of text suffocate readers. Let your words breathe!
Discover Art of Lost Articles
Although using articles — “a,” “an,” and “the” — in your resume isn’t wrong,
try deleting them for a crisper and snappier end result. Recruiters and
employers expect to read resumes in compact phrases, not fully developed
sentences.

The first person “I” is another word that your resume doesn’t need. Look at
the following examples:
With Articles
Without Articles

based waxes and polishes.
waxes and polishes.
I worked as the only administrative 
Worked as only administrative 
person on a large construction site.
person on large construction site.
Sell, Don’t Tell
Forget sticking to the old naming-your-previous-responsibilities routine.
Merely listing “Responsible for XYZ” doesn’t assure the recruiter that you
met your responsibility or that the result of your efforts was worth the
money someone paid you.
By contrast, read over your resume and make sure you have answered that
pesky “So what?” question, which is lying in ambush for each bit of informa-
tion you mention. Try to imagine what’s running through a recruiter’s mind
when you relate that you were responsible for XYZ: So what? Who cares?
What’s in it for me? Anticipate those questions and answer them before a
recruiter has a chance to toss your resume. (Chapter 5 discusses this advice
in more detail.)
Show Off Your Assets
Recruiters are wild about snaring the cream of the crop. If you’re in the top 5
percent of any significant group (graduation, sales, attendance record, perfor-
mance ratings) make sure that fact appears prominently on your resume.
Make Sure Your Words 
Play Well Together
Old wisdom: Use a lot of action verbs to perk up reading interest in resumes
(see Chapter 7). Later wisdom: Cash in some of the action verbs for nouns,
the keywords that ward off anonymity in sleeping resume databases. 
New wisdom: Use both nouns and verbs.
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Just don’t mix noun and verb phrases in the same resume section. The fol-
lowing example explains.
Highlights:
• Founded start-up, achieving positive cash flow and real profits in the
first year. [verb]
• President of point-of-sale products. [noun]
• Proven ability for representation of high technology products. [noun]
• Consistently achieved highest profit in 45-year-old company history.
[verb]
Change the noun statements to be consistent with the verb statements:
• Served as president of point-of-sale products.
• Proved ability to represent high-technology products.
Writing instructors call this agreeable notion parallel construction.
Reach Out with Strength
Highlight the qualifications and past job activities that speak to the kind of
job you want and the skills you want to use. If, for instance, you want to tran-
sition from military training to civilian training, remain riveted to your train-
ing skills without diluting your message by mentioning your ability to use
several simple computer programs. 
Don’t muddle your resume’s message with minor skills or skills you no longer
wish to use; stay on message.
Trash a Wimpy Objective
Imagine an actor striding onto a stage, stopping, and then standing there like
a log addressing the audience: “I came to find out what you can do for me.”
Not exactly a curtain raiser — any more than beginning your resume with
simply awful objective statements like: “Seeking a chance for advancement,”
or “where my skills will be utilized.”
317
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Improve Your Resume

Retire trite messages like this one: “To obtain a responsible job with “chal-
lenging and rewarding duties.” Does someone out there really want an irre-
sponsible position? One that’s dull and unrewarding?
Be an editor! Draw a line through wussy wording that leaves everyone won-
dering whether you’re a washout. Your statement can be simple, yet effective:
“Management position in finance where more than ten years’ experience will
strengthen the bottom line.”
Check the Horse’s Mouth
Pick up the phone and call the HR department where you want to work and
are about to submit your resume. Ask: “Before I send you my resume online, 
I want to get the facts. Do you accept MS Word attachments, store them as
formatted documents, and route them to line managers as images?”
If the answer is yes, wrap fish in that ugly ASCII plain text resume and throw it
away, reveling in the fact that you’ll get to send the attractive version of your
resume. If the answer is no, well, good try in this era of transition. After all,
ugly is still better than unreadable.
Erase the “Leave-Outs”
Eliminate clutter by removing useless information that doesn’t support rea-
sons you’re a qualified candidate. Here’s a short list of the worst offenders:
 “References available on request.” Listing the actual references on your
resume is even worse.
 Your Social Security number or driver’s license number.
 The date your resume was prepared.
 Your company’s telephone number.
 Your high school or grammar school if you’re a college graduate.
 Dates you spent involved in college extracurricular activities.
 Dates you were involved with professional or civic organizations unless
using them to fill in gaps or add heft to your claims.
 Names of (human) past employers; put these on your reference sheet
with contact information.

Chapter 20
Ten Tips on Choosing Professional
Resume Help
In This Chapter
 Selecting a professional resume writer
 Checking out the goods
 Shopping for price quotes
T
o use a professional resume writer or not? That is the question.
“No!” answers one recruiter, “I don’t recommend professional services. Write
your own. Interviewers have certain expectations from the resume. When a
professional writer creates an overblown image that you can’t live up to, the
interview crashes because the interviewer feels she’s been fooled. That
wastes everyone’s time, including yours.”
“Yes!” Another career counselor disagrees: “Seldom would I recommend that
job seekers write their own resumes, regardless of their intelligence or writ-
ing ability. They lack objectivity. They often spin their wheels focusing on the
wrong things, either over- or underreacting to their experiences.”
These two opinions differ because effectively packaging yourself on paper is
not a naturally acquired ability but a skill you purposely set out to learn.
I come down on the side of the second counselor’s opinion — use a pro to
write your resume, if you wish. You should, however, organize your own
material to present to the professional writer just as you organize your taxes
to hand over to an accountant. The reason is simple: Organizing your infor-
mation primes your mind for job interviews.

In an age of personalization — personal financial advisers, personal trainers,
personal tax preparers, personal career coaches — why not a personal
resume pro? Prime candidates for resume services are first-time resume writ-
ers, people with a checkerboard history, and people who haven’t thought
about resumes in years. Follow these tips to choose a personal resume pro
wisely.
Choose a Resume Writing Service, 
Not a Clerical Service
Many clerical services do a nice job of word processing your resume for a fair
price of $100 or more. A clerical service is a useful option if that’s all you
need.
But most people need much more, and clerical services are in a different
business from professional resume writing services. Clerical services sell such
clerical processes as keyboarding and printing. Resume firms sell specialized
knowledge in fluently articulating what you want to do and the evidence that
proves you can do it.
A resume pro knows a great deal about the business of marketing you to
employers, has the latest trends and buzzwords on tap, and coaches you
through potholes in your history.
Ask Around for a Great Resume Pro
After you’ve decided to use a resume professional, your next step is finding a
winner. The best way to do so is to get a referral, either from a satisfied cus-
tomer or from someone in the business — a local career center consultant,
recruiter, employment agency consultant, or outplacement consultant.
If you’re being laid off, inquire within your corporate human resource depart-
ment. These people often know who’s doing the best work.
The fact that a resume firm has been in business for a long time and has done
thousands of resumes is no guarantee of competence — but it’s a sign that
some customers must like what they do and have spread the word. The
acceptance of major credit cards is another indicator of stability.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Request a Free Initial Consultation
Request a free, brief, get-acquainted meeting in person or on the phone.
Speak not to the boss or a sales representative, but to the writer. The same
firm can have good and poor writers. Ask the writer what general strategy
she’ll use to deal with your specific problems. If you don’t hear a responsible
answer, keep looking.
A responsible answer does not imply discussion of the specifics of how your
resume will be handled. Much like people shop retail stores to look at the
merchandise and then order from a discount catalog, people shop profes-
sional resume services to pick writers’ brains and then write their own
resumes. Resume pros caught on to this move and developed laryngitis.
Moreover, it is irresponsible for a resume pro to go into detail about how
your resume will be handled until she knows more about you. You want to
know the general approach — the kinds of strategies discussed in this book.
Watch Out for Overuse of Forms
Most resume pros ask you to fill out a lengthy, detailed form — much like the
one new patients fill out in a doctor’s office. The form is a good start, but it’s
far from enough. Eliminate the firms that don’t offer dialogue with the writer.
The resume pro should interview you to discover your unique experience
and strengths. You and the resume pro are colleagues, sharing a task.
The problem with form dependency is you may merely get back your own
language prettied up in a glitzy format. That’s not what you want a resume
pro to do for you.
Look for a Fair Price
Prices vary by locale, but expect to pay between $150 and $1,000 for most
resumes. Executive resumes may range from $500 to $1,600.
If you’re using a two-page resume, you can probably pay for a core resume
and customize only the first page for each different job, while retaining the
second page across your search. You may have to pay extra for a few cus-
tomizations of your core resume to see how it’s done.
321
Chapter 20: Ten Tips on Choosing Professional Resume Help

Never pay by the page — longer isn’t better. Find out the rate for branching
out from a core resume to create a targeted resume specifically for an individ-
ual employer or occupation. Other questions to ask include:
 Can I get a volume discount for several resumes targeted in different
directions?
 What’s the charge for minor alterations?
 What’s the charge for an update two years later?
 What’s the cost for extra copies?
Don’t be persuaded by an offer of, say, 100 copies for a discount price. Even if
it seems like a bargain, you may want to make changes long before your
inventory is gone. Beware also of a resume professional who gives lifetime
free updating — it’s unrealistic to expect quality work when the professional
isn’t being paid.
Check Out Samples
Ask the resume pro to show you samples of his resumes. Look not only at
content but at production values. Choose a resume pro who has invested in
state-of-the-art technology: a good computer and a laser printer. You judge
the quality of the content, layout, word processing, paper, and printing.
Take Aim
For maximum impact, target each resume you send out to a specific
employer or career field. Look for a resume pro who understands this con-
cept. You need a resume that has “you” written all over it — your theme, your
focus, and your measurable achievements — all matched to a career field you
want. Skip over those who sell the same cookie-cutter resume over and over.
Avoid resume pros who offer assembly-line presentations, virtually indistin-
guishable from thousands of others created by the service. Ignore resume
pros who plug your information into a fill-in-the-blanks standard form, gar-
nished with prefab statements. Double ignore those who try to cover the
sameness of their work by printing out resumes on 11 x 17-inch parchment
paper and folding them into a pretentious brief. Employers use these
resumes for kindling.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Also, be careful of the pro who caters to you instead of to your target audi-
ence. A heavyweight resume pro warned me that some resume services cater
to their customers, not their customers’ customers — with fancy brochures,
excessive color, and whimsical paper.
Consider a Certified Resume Writer
Resume writers who belong to resume-certifying organizations are likely to
stay up to date in resume effectiveness; some earn continuing education
units (CEUs). Here are the “big three” certifying organizations:
 The Professional Association of Resume Writers & Career Counselors
(www.parw.com) is a for-profit organization. It was the first in the
resume-writing industry to certify professionals who meet the required
criteria of experience and examination. Those who become certified are
allowed to use the title Certified Professional Resume Writer (CPRW)
after their names.
 Career Directors International (www.careerdirectors.com) is a 
for-profit organization. While the newest of the “big three” resume-
certifying organizations, it’s well regarded in the industry. Career
Directors International offers four levels of resume certification:
Certified Advanced Resume Writer (CARW), Certified Expert Resume
Writer (CERW), Certified Master Resume Writer (CMRW), and certified
Federal Resume Writer (CFRW).
 The National Resume Writers’ Association (www.nrwa.com) is a not-
for-profit organization. It started as a spin-off of PARW but is now totally
independent. Those who become certified through this group are
allowed to use the title Nationally Certified Resume Writer (NCRW) after
their names. Visit the organization’s Web site to locate members who are
well qualified to write your resume.
Visit the Web sites of the above organizations to locate members who are
well qualified to write your resume — no matter where you live. You can
reside thousands of miles away from the resume writer and still get a great
product.
Remember That Design Counts
Review pointers in Chapter 9 to recall how a professional resume is supposed
to look. You’d be amazed at how “borax” and junky the products are that I get
as spam from resume mills. Your resume must look professional.
323
Chapter 20: Ten Tips on Choosing Professional Resume Help

Know That a Poor Resume Is No Bargain
Appreciate the hidden costs of a poor resume: A hack job can cost you good
job interviews. When the finished product is in your hands, you should be
able to say:
 This is an OnTarget resume — it looks great and makes me look great!
 This resume doesn’t leave out qualifications that are targeted to the jobs
I’m after.
 I like reading my resume; it won’t put the recruiter to sleep.

Ten Pet Peeves of Recruiters
In This Chapter
 Reading recruiters’ inside talk
 Recognizing irksome resume flaws
 Knowing when to overrule recruiters
C
heck out what recruiters write when they think no “civilians” (job seek-
ers) are reading. Both third-party (independent) recruiters and inside
corporate recruiters share their thoughts freely on various Internet forums.
Here are ten categories of transgressions that various e-recruiters cite as
making them grumpy. Some categories contain comments from different
recruiters. I report them anonymously to protect their privacy. My comments
conclude each category.
Resume-Free Pitches
I bristle at applicants who e-mail me a general question, “Do you have any
technical positions open in Kansas City?” instead of a resume.
Spare yourself a nonanswer for a nonresume. Attach a resume to your 
question.
Major Mismatches
I find it extremely annoying when people send resumes without reading our
job posting. If we advertise for a pizza chef, a bike mechanic is just as likely
to self-nominate himself for the job, leaving us to figure it out. We don’t have
time for goose chasing.

Our management positions require a background in a certain industry plus
experience. We get responses from people with one year of experience and
no management background. We get resumes that claim their experience is
ideal or that they read the position and found it to fit their skills exactly,
when in reality they have none of the experience detailed in the job posting.
We advertised for a telecommunications consultant with call center 
experience and received a resume of someone with experience in movie
production and no experience in anything we look for. I am sure applicants
would have a more positive outcome if they applied for positions that are
relevant to their experience, although I doubt this will ever change.
Some job seekers, particularly in technical fields, operate on the lottery
theory and scatter resumes everywhere. A number of job seekers adhere to
the old-school 80 percent strategy (if you fit 80 percent of the job’s require-
ments, give it a go) or believe that if you can manage one thing, you can
manage anything.
Others seek ways to apply viable transferable skills to new environments
and, failing to make a strong enough case, are rejected because some
recruiters are too inexperienced, overworked, or insular to recognize the
legitimacy of transitioning skills.
Still other job seekers just don’t get it and waste everyone’s time in applying
for jobs for which they’re dramatically unqualified.
Solution: The targeted resume. (See Chapter 1.)
E-Stalking
One applicant e-mailed his resume and a few days later sent another, saying
he was waiting for a response. I replied that we would contact him if we are
interested. A few days later, and once a week for a few months, he sent
e-mails that said only, “Still waiting.” Creepy.
I would like to tell job seekers to send only one resume. If someone is
“open” to all appropriate positions, just say so!
Checking back periodically works best if you send new information of interest
to the recruiter. You may send a relevant news article with a brief “In case
you missed this” note, adding that you continue to look forward to the right
timing for an interview.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Saying that you’re available for any appropriate position carries the risk that
you’ll be seen as too much of a generalist and expert at nothing, or desper-
ate. If you do it, define the field — “appropriate in the accounting field” or
“appropriate in the retail financial field,” for example.
The technical reviewer for this book, HR expert Jim Lemke, says that stuffing
the recruitment box with your resumes may become moot:
“Most applicant tracking systems that companies are using now require job
seekers to create a login ID before permitting job seekers to attach a resume.
After the job seeker logs into the company career site, he or she can easily
modify a current resume, save multiple versions, and apply to multiple posi-
tions with the click of the mouse.
“The job seeker may still be required to answer specific questions before a
resume can be submitted for a specific job. If the questions are answered 
correctly (according to the company’s standards), the recruiter or hiring
manager is notified by e-mail that a new qualified resume is available for
review. If the applicant doesn’t pass the litmus test for qualification, the
applicant’s resume stays in the company’s database and is searched on for
future openings.
“It doesn’t stop the persistent applicant from sending additional resumes or
e-mail or making phone calls. The trick is not to become a pest.”
327
Chapter 21: Ten Pet Peeves of Recruiters
Censor before sending your complaint
This is the true story of what can happen when
you give into feelings of stress, frustration, irri-
tation, and anger and call it like you see it. The
following is an actual e-mail letter to a major
defense contractor that employs tens of thou-
sands of people:
To Whom It May Concern:
In response to the job openings posted at your
Web site, I have applied for numerous jobs
(probably over 100 different positions) by send-
ing my resume to you along with e-mails during
the last 4 to 5 weeks. I am extremely disap-
pointed by the way my online job applica-
tions have been handled by [company name
withheld].
The recruiter who handled the complaint
replies:
“This person was interviewed at a job fair and
told that if he qualified for any positions, we
would notify him. He then submitted 111 actual
resumes for more than 40 different career posi-
tions. I have never met anyone who could qual-
ify for that many positions. This individual
doesn’t get it. We now have removed him from
all job searches in our company.”
Talk about target resume overkill!

Caps and Taps and Typos
My sore spot is receiving e-mails with no use of capitalization whatsoever,
or with some words mysteriously capitalized and those that should be capi-
talized (proper names, beginning of a sentence) in lowercase.
For heaven’s sake, use spell check. A neat resume will always be my prefer-
ence over one that is not.
Every single book or article on resume writing I’ve ever seen recommends
impeccable work. It would be a crying shame to put together a well-
researched resume only to have it discarded because of misspellings and
typos throughout the text.
Too Much Information
I give bad marks to people who think that sending their resume multiple
times will increase their chance of getting a call for an interview. It won’t.
I dislike it when the applicant puts several addresses in the “to” e-mail box
and mass mails the resume. This unprofessional shortcut looks like no care
is taken in applying to each individual position.
Another practice to avoid is postal mailing a hard copy of your e-mailed
resume. Carry hard copies to an interview, but don’t mail or fax an additional
copy because doing so is unnecessary. As for e-mailing your resume, not only
is it disrespectful to mass mail your resume addressed to multiple names, but
it’s no one’s business but your own where you’re applying for work.
Moreover, as the sea change of target resumes sweeps across the job market,
the old-school “blast” style mailings (one-size-fits-all) stand little chance of
delivering you into an interview room.
Date Grate
What annoys me is when job seekers send resumes and don’t specify start
and end dates for jobs. As if this won’t be at the top of my list to ask in an
interview and a reference check — if they get to the interview process at all.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Two old dodges don’t fly with me: (1) Trying to hide a resume gap by listing
employment dates at the end of the summaries rather than in the left-hand
margin and (2) substituting the number of years at a company for the real
dates.
Reporters are taught to put the most important facts at the lead of a story.
Using the same theory of first things first, list your experience in this order:
title of position, name and locale of employer, and dates of employment.
Dates of employment don’t have to be placed in the left margin. The right
margin is perfectly acceptable and even preferred by some resume experts.
Guess Who
It’s a pain when I get incomplete resumes and cover letters without contact
information. We have offices in several countries and a hotmail.com
address doesn’t suffice.
A pet peeve of mine is receiving resumes without the current employer 
listed — “confidential” resumes. I can understand this treatment for Web job
site postings but when sending a resume to a specific employer, the current
employer should be identified.
As for the first comment, you can add to the “hotmail.com” (or other free
mailbox established for a job search) a post office box and a dedicated tele-
phone answering machine. That combination will protect your privacy but
make it easy for a recruiter to contact you.
As for the second comment, you can use a generic description of your cur-
rent position and skills, noting that you’ll reveal the current employer’s name
in a job interview. I urge caution in fully revealing your identity and personal
workplace information on the Internet.
File Style
I can’t imagine why, but some people have to be told to submit a resume as
a normal attachment in a common program (Word, WordPerfect, Notepad,
and so forth). I have received two-page Word documents as zip files! I have
the software to handle zips, but many people do not.
Zip files are for documents the size of Connecticut, not resumes or CVs. No
one wants to bother unzipping.
329
Chapter 21: Ten Pet Peeves of Recruiters

Useless and Uninformative
I grow peevish when forced to read through fluff that does not relate to a
workforce position. It doesn’t matter to anyone in my office that you were
the local beauty queen. It doesn’t matter to anyone in my office that when
you are 35, out of college, and have held several jobs that you attended a
prestigious prep school as a teenager. It doesn’t matter to anyone in my
office that your wife is the vice president of a well-known company.
Another thing that bugs me is the use of fancy graphics and poems on
resumes.
Stick to information related to your ability to do the job for which you are
applying.
Probable Prevarication
I hate wasting my time on resumes from people who claim to have attended
a school they never saw the inside of and to have worked for a company
that they didn’t.
Lying about a point of fact easily proved or disproved is riskier than ever in
today’s era of fact-checking background investigations.
Recruiters and employers are getting wise to lies and are turning fib finding
into a big business. The Society for Human Resource Management, a member-
ship organization, says the number of third-party screeners has exploded in
the past ten years into a $2 billion industry because 96 percent of businesses
now conduct some sort of background check on job applicants. Some compa-
nies even conduct checks upon promotion.
Despite the glib assurances from some that you must inflate your resume or
be put at a disadvantage because “everybody’s doing it,” tall tales court trou-
ble, as a number of high-placed executives have discovered on their way out
the door.
Employers often assume that those who cheat on resumes and job applica-
tions also cheat in school and in life.

Chapter 22
Your Ten-Point Resume Checklist
In This Chapter
 Making sure your resume matches up with specific job qualifications
 Using a fire hose on tacky resume errors
 Standing back for a fresh look at the impression you’re making
 Trusting your resume skills but verifying overall results
B
efore going public with your resume, give it a final walk-through. Check
the box in front of each item only when your resume meets OnTarget
standards. Give yourself 10 points for each checkmark. If you don’t get a
score of 100, go back to your keyboard and try again.
Tit for Tat
❏You remember the new drive to customize resumes by matching your
qualifications (skills, education) with the specific positions of a job, or
by matching your qualifications with the expected qualifications in a
career field.
If you write a two-page resume, you remember to customize the first
page, even if you do not customize the second page. (Chapter 1 dis-
cusses the customizing requirement and why it’s now important.)
Format and Style
❏You select the best format for your situation.
For example, reverse chronological when staying in the same field, or
functional when changing fields. (Chapter 5 covers resume formats.)

Focus and Image
❏You say what you want to do and why you should be interviewed to
do it.
You let your resume “rest” for a day or so, and then look at it with fresh
eyes. You consider its overall impression. What kind of “brand” do you
project? Your resume has a theme. You present yourself as focused —
not merely desperate to accept just any job. 
Achievements and Skills
❏You relate your skills to the skills needed for the job.
You cite at least one achievement for each skill. You measure by using
numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts for each achievement. You
measure any statement you can. You highlight results, not just 
responsibilities.
Language and Expressions
❏You make the most of your word choices.
You use adequate keywords (nouns) to make your resume searchable.
You use action verbs to put vitality in your resume. You eliminate words
that don’t directly support your bid for the job you want, as well as such
meaningless words and phrases as “References available.” You use
industry jargon where appropriate, but you translate acronyms, techni-
cal jargon, or military lingo into easy-to-understand English. (Chapter 7
reviews word usage.)
Content and Omissions
❏Your content supports your objective.
You begin with either a skills summery or a job objective. Next, you state
your experience. You begin with your education only if you’re a new
graduate with virtually no experience, or if your target job is related to
education and training. You don’t list personal information that isn’t
related to the job you seek, such as marital status, number of children,
or height. (For a refresher on content, see Chapter 6)
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Length and Common Sense
❏You use a length that makes sense for the amount of information
you’re presenting.
You limit your resume to one or two pages if you’re lightly experienced,
or two or three pages if you’re substantially experienced. These page
counts are only guidelines; your resume can be longer if necessary to
put your qualifications in the best light. Additionally, your resume can
exceed three pages if it’s a professional resume or a CV (curriculum
vitae). Remember: Don’t jam pack a jumble of text on one page; doing so
makes your resume too difficult to read.
Appearance: Online Attached
and Paper Resumes
❏Your resume is a real looker.
Your e-resume in a fully formatted Word document (or equivalent) looks
much like a fully formatted paper resume. You use an open layout with
white space, minimum one-inch margins, headings in bold typeface or
capital letters, bullets, and other low-key graphic elements that make
your resume look professional (see Chapter 8). Your paper resume is
printed on white or eggshell paper, both for a business impression and
because it may be scanned into a database.
Sticky Points and Sugarcoating
❏You thoughtfully handle all problem areas, such as grouping irrele-
vant jobs, long-ago, part-time, and temporary jobs.
You account for all the gaps in the time frame of your resume. You scour
your resume for possible hidden negatives and eliminate them as
described in Chapter 10.
333
Chapter 22: Your Ten-Point Resume Checklist

Proofreading and More Proofreading
❏Your resume contains no typos, no grammar disasters — no errors of
any kind
You not only use your computer’s spell-checker, but you also double-
check (and triple-check) it. You ask others to carefully read it. Typos are
hot buttons to many employers — two goofs and you’re gone.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Tap the Power of OnTarget Resumes
Most jobseekers don’t understand the phenomenon of how the second gust
of innovative winds, called Web 2.0, is changing the way the Internet is con-
necting people with jobs.
That’s why — after reading this book— you’re ahead of your competition in
understanding the variety of changes, including
 Employers’ demands for dead-on matches of job requirements and your
qualifications.
 Social networking and employee referral systems you can use.
 Blogs that carry targeted job ads for your interests and skill sets.
 RSS (Real Simple Syndication) feeds that sprint job openings to you
immediately as they’re posted.
 Vertical job search engines that attempt to collect for you every job
opening in the universe.
Get a leg up by starting now at the beginning of a New Era in job search.
Plunge into writing your OnTarget core resume sooner rather than later. You
can’t meet today’s job market challenges relying on resume strategies from
the past century.
All best wishes for you,
