About the Author
Erica holds a BA in Communications and an MBA in International Management
from Thunderbird. She’s frequently tapped to lecture at the University of
Nevada in Reno and the University of Phoenix in Reno on management
and planning topics. She hosts workshops and has spoken at conferences
nationwide.
As one of the developers of MyStrategicPlan, Erica has stripped strategic
planning of its fate as a static document. With her online strategic planning
system, any organization, regardless of size and budget, can build a plan in a
matter of weeks (or even days). Once completed, the online system actually
helps organizations execute the plan instead of just shoving it on a shelf. 
MyStrategicPlan is just one of several services offered by Erica’s company,
M3 Planning. M3 also does onsite strategic planning facilitation and retreats
as well as market research consulting. Over the last several years, M3 has
developed and reviewed hundreds of strategic plans for organizations across
the country.
In addition to Strategic Planning For Dummies, Erica has co-authored Strategic
Planning Made Easy: A Practical Guide to Growth and Profitability, and contributes
regular columns to local, regional, and national business publications.
When Erica is not lecturing, writing, or planning, she’s alternately kayaking,
backcountry skiing, rock climbing, biking, running, or bagging peaks around
the Western Hemisphere with her husband Gregor.
Erica always enjoy hearing from her readers. If you have questions about
your strategic planning or if you have a success story to share, please

Author’s Acknowledgments
My sincere thanks and appreciation goes out to everyone who had a hand
in putting this book together. The journey was an amazingly wonderful and
enlightening experience, and I am grateful for the remarkable opportunity to
author this book. I must recognize a few specific people.
To my book brain trust, who provided ideas, recommendations, and sugges-
tions at every turn — thank you for making this book as good as it could be.
I want to specifically thank Carol McClelland, Tim Gallan, Michael Lewis,
Carrie Burchfield, technical editor Ann Bastianelli, and Jan King for all your help.
I would also like to thank the graphics and layout teams at Wiley Publishing
who made this book come to life and the marketing teams who brought this
book to business owners and managers everywhere. And a special thanks to
Howard Putnam, author of The Winds of Turbulence, for his kind words.
To our strategic planning clients, who’ve all contributed to this book through
their examples, questions, suggestions, and experiences — thank you for the
opportunity to work with your organizations. Working with you is a pleasure
and gift to everyone at my company.
Thank you to my great friends for sticking by my side even when I was buried
in my writing. You’re a continual source of encouragement. Special thanks go
out to my friends and colleagues who gave me creative inspiration when I got
stuck, specifically Greg Fine, Michael-Anne Hougland, and Chris Champagne.
To my family, who’s the best family in the world, thank you for supporting me
in everything I do. My brothers Ryan and Brett, you provided needed distrac-
tions in between my deadlines. Grandma and Grandpa Olsen (aka G & G), you
instilled the entrepreneurial spirit in our family; to you I am eternally grateful.
Aunt Marlene, you’re an amazing mentor; thank you for sharing your knowl-
edge and wisdom with me. Mom, you’re a one-of-a-kind business partner and
mentor; thank you for taking care of the business and our clients when I was
facing looming deadlines. Dad, you added needed clarifications, answers, and
content ideas whenever I needed them; thank you for dropping everything to
help me. You are as much the author of this book as I am. You’re the best.
Most importantly, I want to thank my husband, Gregor. Your unfailing support
for everything I do doesn’t go unnoticed. I couldn’t accomplish any of what I
do without you.

Introduction
B
asically, you have two choices when it comes to running your organiza-
tion: Be intentional about the path your organization follows or turn on
autopilot. Turning on autopilot is kind of like hopping in your Hummer, turn-
ing on the satellite navigation system, and following the directions from your
home to Las Vegas. Computers aren’t the best at making decisions, so you
may get to Las Vegas eventually, but are you going to Las Vegas, New Mexico,
or Las Vegas, Nevada. If you plot your course before you set off, you’re a lot
more likely to get to your destination.
Many people deliberately plan their personal lives, but when it comes to
business, they don’t take the same approach. If you’re running your organiza-
tion without a plan, you’re just using the navigation system. This concept
may seem rudimentary, but the facts state that 90 percent of businesses are
running without a plan. Ninety percent is hoping that the navigation system
doesn’t fail. But because you’re reading this book, you’re ready to run the
show, and you’re close to joining the elite ten percent that know a strategic
plan is important. 
About This Book
This book is about getting from Point A to Point B more effectively and effi-
ciently and having more fun along the way. Part of that journey is the strategy
and part of it is the planning, development, and execution. 
Strategic planning isn’t about taking on additional work; it’s about taking all
those numerous daily decisions and making them part of an integrated
process. Whether you want to be more effective and efficient or you want to
make more money, have a bigger community impact, or move your company
from good to great, this book is for you! No more thinking that strategic plan-
ning is daunting. This book makes the process easy, straightforward, reward-
ing, and fun. Did I already mention that it’s fun?
Strategic Planning For Dummies brings everything business owners, executive
directors, or managers need to take their organizations to the next phase of
business growth. The book presents a practical set of strategic planning tools
and guides you through an integrated strategic planning process. Each part

contains relevant content, real-world examples, and useful worksheets.
Discover how strategic planning is the key element to your growth through
this no nonsense approach.
Strategic planning is a subject that has been overcomplicated by jargon, 
competing semantics, and consultants of the world (me included!). In reality,
strategic planning is a business concept that’s useful to all businesses and
organizations, no matter its size or resources. Strategic planning is incor-
rectly positioned as a tool only available to big businesses. With the help of a
practical and realistic approach to strategic planning, Strategic Planning For
Dummies helps you reap the benefits of strategic planning, whether you’re a
big boy or a small fish. 
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make concepts
consistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.
Some Web addresses may break across two lines of text. If that happens,
know that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to
indicate the break. So, when typing these addresses into your Web
browsers, type exactly what you see in this book, pretending as though
the line break doesn’t exist.
 New terms appear in italic type and are closely followed by a definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps.
 The text in gray boxes, what the Dummies folks refer to as sidebars, is
optional reading. I use sidebars to go off on tangents or present extended
examples. You can skip them if you want. 
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you, my reader:
 You’re a decision maker. You hold the position of business owner, man-
ager, executive director, department head, or team/group leader.
 You can influence change in your organization. Whether you have the
final say, you have a strong enough position to influence the course of
your business.
2
Strategic Planning For Dummies 

 You want to see your organization grow! Growth is different for every
organization. But the underlying premise is you want your organization
to do more.
 You can see the edges of your strategy, but you need to fill in the detail.
Most organizations know what general direction they’re headed in, but
they need to turn the generalities into specifics.
 You have a plan, but it’s sitting on the shelf gathering dust. Or you have
a plan, but it’s half-way completed. 
 You want to get everyone on the same page. I hear this phrase with
almost every client I work with, so I assume this applies to you too.
The need to get your whole company focused and pulling in the same
direction is a great motivator to do strategic planning. 
Although all these assumptions may not apply to you, am I at least close?
I wish I could predict the future of your business, but alas, I haven’t been
granted that power. A strategic plan helps to take out the uncertainty and
allows you to shape the future you want. And I’m here to help you with your
steps along the way. 
How This Book Is Organized
Strategic Planning For Dummies is divided into five parts. A quick review of
the Table of Contents and the following description of the parts gives you a
solid overview of the entire book. If you want information about a particular
topic, the Index can also help you locate it.
Part I: Laying the Foundation 
for Your Strategic Plan
The chapters in this part are packed full of who, what, how, and why you
should care. You look at a number of concepts in this part:
 The strategic planning process
 Who should be involved
 How long the process takes
 How you facilitate a strategic planning process
 When the right time for planning is 
3
Introduction

 The differences between business plans and strategic plans
 When your organization shouldn’t embark on strategic planning 
If you’re looking to convince your boss or team members about the impor-
tance of strategic planning, look no further than Chapter 2. 
Part II: Looking Backward 
to Move Forward
Hold on a second. Don’t move past this part too quickly. I know you want to.
Whether your organization has been around for two years or 200 years, you
have important knowledge to build your strategic plan on. I like to call that
knowledge tribal knowledge. Chapter 4 asks you to bring that tribal knowl-
edge into the forefront of your planning. Chapter 5 digs into the hard subject
of what you do best and is about identifying, developing, and sustaining your
organization’s competitive advantage. Additionally, Part II provides you with
advice on making sure that the foundation of your business is solid. Chap-
ter 6 includes a discussion about mission, vision, and values. 
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation
Part III focuses on collecting information that’s critical for your strategic deci-
sion making. Organizations can’t plan without gathering the right data, so
Chapter 7 looks at internal data collection and analysis; and Chapters 8 and 9
extend past your business to external data collection on the environmental,
customer, industry, and competitive levels. A set of tools is provided for syn-
thesizing the data so it’s more useful in strategic decision making. 
Part IV: Moving Your Organization 
into the Future
The main reason you need to do strategic planning is to look into and plan for
the future. In this part, you determine how you grow by looking at the differ-
ent types of value-creating strategies as well as the more specific strategies
surrounding growth, integration, and diversification. Most importantly, you
identify and evaluate opportunities and then select a strategy to move in that
direction. 
4
Strategic Planning For Dummies 

Part V: Creating and Making 
the Most of Your Plan
No matter how good the plan, if it sits on the shelf, it’s going to be useless.
In this part, you put all the elements of the plan together in an organized
fashion. You develop strategic objectives, goals and tactics, and scorecards.
After your plan is organized, you assess the financial viability of the plan, how
to communicate the plan, methods to hold people accountable, and how to
adapt the plan to an ever-changing environment. This part provides a wealth
of information about strategy execution and performance management.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Need some quick tips, a shot in the arm, or just a good laugh? The Part of
Tens is a collection of hints, reminders, observations, and warnings about
what to do and not to do. These chapters focus on giving you a quick set of
guidelines for three key areas: facilitating strategy meetings, getting your plan
done, and executing the strategy. 
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, icons appear in the left margins to alert you to special
information.
When you see this icon, the text includes an example of how the idea is used
in other organizations — big and small.
This symbol marks an important truth that’s worth repeating. Taking note of
these ideas can help you make progress with your strategic plan.
The information next to the tip icon always includes a helpful hint to keep
your strategic plan moving forward as smoothly as possible. Whether the
tips are time savers or step savers, these hints help you move forward.
Any information next to this icon is something you want to be wary about.
Watch your step when you see a Warning. The information can include mis-
takes made by others that you can learn from or moments where you have to
weigh the cost of doing one thing over another. 
5
Introduction

This symbol indicates a concept or work area where the outcome goes into
your strategic plan. 
Are you an experienced strategic planner? If so, these icons are for you. 
Take your planning to the next level by employing the ideas highlighted with
this icon. 
Where to Go from Here 
This book is as much about strategy development and execution as it is
about the plan itself. If you want to spend time on strategy development, go
to Parts II, III, and IV. On the other hand, if you just want to put your plan
together, go to Parts I and V.
Another approach to tackling this book is to consider your own thinking and
education style. What gets you excited? How do you like to think? 
 Big picture thinkers: You may love Chapters 5, 6, and 10 because they
focus on what’s possible and are future oriented. 
 Analytical minds: Chapters 4, 7, 8, 9, and 15 are for those of you who
always look at the what ifs. These chapters look at how to use data from
your internal and external environments to develop a list of possible
strategies. 
 Detail-oriented folks: If you’re thinking, “How are we going to do this?”
then head to Chapters 13 and 14 to put the pieces together. 
 Social butterflies, team builders, and crowd pleasers: Check out Chap-
ters 2, 3, and 19 for ideas to build consensus and get everyone’s input.
However you approach your plan, I recommend you start a strategy note-
book to capture your thoughts as you move through your planning process.
I guarantee you’ll stumble across a section of text or an idea that you don’t
want to lose, so if you jot it down in your notebook, you won’t have to go
back and find it. In several places, I refer to the notebook as a place to work
through some actions and exercises. 
Regardless of how you find your way around Strategic Planning For Dummies,
I’m sure that you can develop a strategic plan that fits your team’s approach
and organization’s style. Please share your stories, experiences, vision, and
successes with me and other readers on my blog at www.mystrategicplan.

Part I
Laying the
Foundation for Your
Strategic Plan

In this part . . . 
H
aving a strategic plan is the best way to bring focus
and direction to your organization. The chapters in
this part make you a strategic planning convert. In this
part, you discover what strategic planning is and why it’s
important. You also dive into the steps of the strategic
planning process, including who should be involved along
the way.

Chapter 1
What Is Strategic 
Planning Anyhow?
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what a strategic plan is
 Checking out the key parts of a strategic plan
 Getting the most out of your strategic planning process
 Heeding the warnings about your strategic planning process
W
hat will your business be like in three years? Do you have a roadmap
to get from today to your envisioned tomorrow? Will you be a few
steps closer to realizing your vision by next year? No one can predict the
future. But if you don’t change anything, the future won’t be any different
than the past.
One sure-fire way to impact your company’s future (and profitability) is to
dust off a timeless tool — the strategic plan — and intentionally drive your
organization forward. No one strategic model fits all organizations, but the
planning process includes certain basic elements that all businesses can use
to explore their vision, goals, and next steps of an effective strategic plan.
A good strategic plan achieves the following:
 Reflects the values of the organization
 Inspires change and revision in products and target markets
 Clearly defines the criteria for achieving success
 Assists everyone in daily decision making
No one can predict the future. But effective leaders aren’t sitting around and
waiting for it to happen either. They’re anticipating what lies ahead. Managers
and business owners aren’t waiting for their competitors to swoop in and put

them out of business. Instead, they’re using their strategic plans to get ahead 
of the game. So it’s odd to think that many people avoid strategic planning
because they consider it complex, costly, and time-intensive. Most of the time
the plan is shelved before it’s implemented, even knowing the fact that some
other company can invade your market!
But strategic planning doesn’t have to be mysterious, complicated, or time-
consuming. In fact, it should be quick, simple, and easily executed. And
strategic planning isn’t just something you cross of your list of to-dos — you
must create a culture of strategic thinking, so your strategic planning doesn’t
become an annual retreat but, instead, a part of daily decision making.
Clearing Up the Confusion 
about Strategic Planning
Many people are confused by the terms strategy, strategic plan, and strategic
planning. Well, I am here to help you get a clear picture. For the moment,
forget what you’ve heard about this subject. I promise that strategic planning
makes a huge difference to your organization both tangibly and intangibly, so
keep reading!
What is strategy?
Strategy means consciously choosing to be clear about your company’s direc-
tion in relation to what’s happening in the dynamic environment. With this
knowledge, you’re in a much better position to respond proactively to the
changing environment.
The fine points of strategy are as follows:
 Establishes unique value proposition compared to your competitors
 Executed through operations that provide different and tailored value 
to customers
 Identifies clear tradeoffs and clarifies what not to do
 Focuses on activities that fit together and reinforce each other
 Drives continual improvement within the organization and moves it
toward its vision
10
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Knowing what strategy is can also be explained by looking at what strategy is
not. Dr. Michael Porter, the leading strategy guru and professor at Harvard,
had this to say at the 2006 World Business Forum in Chicago. Strategy is not
 Best practice improvement
 Execution
 Aspirations
 A vision
 Learning
 Agility
 Flexibility
 Innovation
 The Internet (or any technology)
 Downsizing
 Restructuring
 Mergers/Consolidation
 Alliances/Partnering
 Outsourcing
11
Chapter 1: What Is Strategic Planning Anyhow?
Surprising strategic-planning stats
Consider the following statistics from the
Balanced Scorecard Collaborative (covered in
Chapter 12):
 95 percent of a typical workforce doesn’t
understand its organization’s strategy.
 90 percent of organizations fail to execute
their strategies successfully.
 86 percent of executive teams spend 
less than one hour per month discussing
strategy.
 60 percent of organizations don’t link strat-
egy to budgeting.
So what’s the upshot of these surprising revela-
tions? Strategic planning matters to the life of
your business.

What is a strategic plan?
Simply put, a strategic plan is the formalized roadmap that describes how
your company executes the chosen strategy. A plan spells out where an orga-
nization is going over the next year or more and how it’s going to get there.
Typically, the plan is organization-wide or focused on a major function such
as a division or a department. A strategic plan is a management tool that
serves the purpose of helping an organization do a better job, because a plan
focuses the energy, resources, and time of everyone in the organization in the
same direction.
So, you may be thinking, “Hey I’ve got this great book on business plans, so
I’ll just use that to form my strategic plan.” But be aware that strategic plans
and business plans aren’t the same concepts.
A strategic plan
 Is for established businesses and business owners who are serious
about growth
 Helps build your competitive advantage
 Communicates your strategy to staff
 Prioritizes your financial needs
 Provides focus and direction to move from plan to action
A business plan, on the other hand,
 Is for new businesses, projects, or entrepreneurs who are serious about
starting up a business
 Helps define the purpose of your business
 Helps plan human resources and operational needs
 Is critical if you’re seeking funding
 Assesses business opportunities
 Provides structure to ideas
What is the strategic planning process?
In order to create your strategic plan, you have to go through the strategic
planning process. The planning process typically includes several major
activities or steps. People often have different names for these major 
12
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

activities. They may even conduct them in a different order. Strategic plan-
ning often includes use of several key terms as well. See Chapter 3 for specific
guidelines and checklists to help you with your process.
Don’t be concerned about finding the perfect way to conduct a strategic plan-
ning process. (Perfection doesn’t really exist, does it?) Modify the informa-
tion in this book to fit with your organization’s culture and timing.
What are the big planning pitfalls?
Strategic planning can yield less than desirable results if you end up in one of
the possible pitfalls. To prevent that from happening, here’s a list of the most
common traps to avoid:
 Relying on bad information or no information: A plan is only as good
as the information on which it’s based. Too often, teams rely on untested
assumptions or hunches, erecting their plans on an unsteady foundation.
Chapters 7, 8, and 9 cover collecting good information for your plan.
 Ignoring what your planning process reveals: Planning isn’t magic: You
can’t always get what you want. The planning process includes research
and investigation. Your investigation may yield results that tell you not
to go in a certain direction. Don’t ignore that information!
 Being unrealistic about your ability to plan: Put planning in its place
and time. It takes time and effort to plan well. Some companies want the
results but aren’t willing or able to make the investment. Be realistic
about what you can invest. Find a way to plan that suits your available
resources, which include your time, energy, and money. Chapter 3 helps
you decide what kind of planning process to embark on.
 Planning for planning sake: Planning can become a substitute for
action. Don’t plan so much that you ignore the execution. Well-laid plans
take time to implement. And results take time to yield an outcome.
Chapter 14 is all about action.
 Get your house in order first: Planning can reveal that your house isn’t
in order. When an organization pauses to plan, issues that have been
buried or put on the backburner come to the forefront and can easily
derail your planning efforts. Make sure that your company is in order
and that there are no major conflicts before you embark on strategizing.
Chapter 3 and 7 help you to identify if you have any organizational
issues that will derail your planning.
 Don’t copy and paste: It’s easy to fall into the trap of copying the best
practices of a company similar to yours. Although employing best 
13
Chapter 1: What Is Strategic Planning Anyhow?

practices from your industry is important, other organizations’ experi-
ences aren’t relevant to your own. Organizations are unique, complex,
and diverse. You need to find your own path instead of following a
cookie-cutter approach.
What are the components 
of a strategic plan?
There are several different frameworks to think about and use while you’re
developing your strategic plan. Think of the frameworks as different lenses
through which to view the strategic planning process. You don’t always look
through two or three lenses at once. Normally you use one at a time, and
often you may not know that you’re using certain frameworks that are
embedded in your process. If you’re trying to explain to your planning team
how pieces of the puzzle fit together, first you must understand the following
components of the strategic plan:
 Strategy and culture: Your organization’s culture is made up of people,
processes, experiences, ideas, and attitudes. Your strategy is where your
organization is headed, what path it takes, and how it gets there. You
can’t have strategy without culture or vice versa. Your culture is like
your house, and if it’s not in order, the best strategy in the world can’t
take your company anywhere.
 Internal and external: Similar to the strategy and culture framework
(previous bullet), you have an internal and external framework. The
strategy is external. You gather information from your customers, com-
petitors, industry, and environment to identify your opportunities and
threats. Through employee surveys, board assessments, and financial
statements, you identify your company’s strengths and weaknesses,
which are internal.
 The Balanced Scorecard perspectives: The Balanced Scorecard is a
framework used to develop goals and objectives in four areas (instead 
of departments): financial, customers, internal business processes, and
people. The financial, internal business processes, and people areas are
internal. The customer area is external. Chapter 12 elaborates on this
framework and the Balanced Scorecard.
 Market focus: Growth comes from focusing on your customers and
delivering superior value to them consistently year after year. Built into
your strategic plan is a market-focus framework because of how critical
this is to your organizational growth.
14
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

 Where are we now? Where are we going? How will we get there?:
Because it’s easy to confuse how all the elements of a plan come
together and where they go, this framework is a simple, yet clear way of
looking at the whole plan. This framework is explained in Chapter 3.
What are the most frequently asked
strategic planning questions?
Strategic planning can create a ton of questions. You’re not alone if you have
a long list. The following sections cover the answers to the most commonly
asked questions.
Who uses strategic plans?
Everyone — or at least every company and organization that wants to be 
successful. Companies in every industry, in every part of the country, and in
most of the Fortune 500 use strategic plans. Organizations within the non-
profit, government, and small to big business sectors also have strategic
plans. See Chapter 3 for statistics for how widely strategic planning is used 
as a management tool.
Does every strategic plan include the same elements?
A strategic plan should include many elements:
 A mission statement and vision statement
 A description of the company’s long-term goals and objectives
 Strategies the company plans to use to achieve general goals and 
objectives
 Action plans to implement the goals and objectives
The strategic plan may also identify external factors that can affect achieve-
ment of long-term goals. Plans may vary in detail and scope (depending on
how big the organization is), but for the most part, a strategic plan includes
the basic elements listed above.
Just exactly what is strategic planning?
The term strategic planning refers to a coordinated and systematic process
for developing a plan for the overall direction of your endeavor for the pur-
pose of optimizing future potential. For a profit-making business, this process
involves many questions:
15
Chapter 1: What Is Strategic Planning Anyhow?

 What is the mission and purpose of the business?
 Where do we want to take the business?
 What do we sell currently? What could we sell in the future?
 To whom shall we sell it?
 What do we do that is unique?
 How shall we beat or avoid competition?
The central purpose of this process is to ensure that the course and direction
is well thought out, sound, and appropriate. In addition, the process provides
reassurance that the limited resources of the enterprise (time and capital)
are sharply focused in support of that course and direction. The process
encompasses both strategy formulation and implementation.
What is the difference between strategic 
planning and long-range planning?
The major difference between strategic planning and long-range planning is in
emphasis. Long-range planning is generally considered to mean the develop-
ment of a plan of action to accomplish a goal or set of goals over a period of
several years. The major assumption in long range planning is that current
knowledge about future conditions is sufficiently reliable to enable the devel-
opment of these plans. Because the environment is assumed to be predictable,
the emphasis is on the articulation of internally focused plans to accomplish
agreed-on goals.
The major assumption in strategic planning, however, is that an organization
must be responsive to a dynamic, changing environment. Therefore, the
emphasis in strategic planning is on understanding how the environment is
changing and will change and on developing organizational decisions that 
are responsive to these changes.
Does every company need a strategic plan?
Every endeavor or enterprise already has a strategy. These range from some
vague sense of the desires of the owner to massive, overly sophisticated
master plans. So the question shouldn’t be whether every company needs a
strategy but instead whether the company’s strategy needs to be well thought
out, sound, appropriate, and do-able. The answer is yes.
We are highly successful already, so why should we plan?
Success is strong evidence that a company has had a sound and appropriate
strategy. Note the past tense. There’s absolutely no guarantee that yester-
day’s sound and appropriate strategy will continue to be successful in the
future. Indeed, there’s great danger in assuming so without adequate study.
16
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Can a smaller company afford the time for strategic planning?
Experience shows that the top management team devotes approximately 2 
to 4 percent of its time to practical strategic planning. In reality, structured
strategic planning isn’t something more to do; it’s a better way of doing some-
thing already being done. Indeed, in the long run, you save time.
But understand, strategic planning can become a time trap. You can become
caught in a long slog of planning if you get too mired down in the details.
From the outset, you need to establish that the plan is a living document and
that it is not written in stone. By doing that, you can avoid strategic planning
becoming a time trap.
Why plan in a world that’s highly uncertain?
Your efforts in forward planning can become pointless if you fear that the
plan may be overwhelmed by unanticipated events and developments.
Uncertainty is, indeed, a major problem in forward planning. However, the
greater the uncertainty, the greater the need for good strategic planning
because you want to try to be ready for the unknown.
How can we be confident that our planning will be successful?
Even in the presence of a structured strategic planning process, it’s quite
possible to formulate unsound, inappropriate strategies and/or to fail at
implementation. But this book helps you avoid these many pitfalls. Strategic
planning is worth the effort because it helps you run your organization
better. You can be confident that the information and best practices outlined
in this book result in a successful strategic planning process. I promise!
What is strategic thinking?
Strategic thinking means asking yourself, “Are we doing the right thing?”
It requires three major components:
 Purpose or end vision
 Understanding the environment, particularly of the competition affect-
ing and/or blocking achievement of these ends
 Creativity in developing effective responses to the competitive forces
The Strategic Plan’s Key Elements
A company’s strategic plan is the game plan that management uses for posi-
tioning the company in its chosen market arena, competing successfully, sat-
isfying customers, and achieving good business performance. Most business
17
Chapter 1: What Is Strategic Planning Anyhow?

owners and executives have countless excuses for not having a formal strate-
gic plan. I’ve heard everything from “We’re too new,” to “We’re not big
enough,” to “We’ve never had one; why start now?”
If these excuses sound familiar, check this out: Studies indicate that roughly
90 percent of all businesses lack a strategic plan. Of those that have a plan,
only 10 percent actually implement it. So, if you’re part of the 90 percent, ask
yourself these questions:
 Can your company be more focused?
 Can you be more effective?
 Can your employees be more efficient?
 Can your company be more successful?
I’m guessing that the majority of you answered yes to all the above. And
that’s okay, so in the following sections, I help you understand how each part
of a strategic plan can change how you answer the above questions.
Vision: Bringing things into focus
You get what you focus on. Everyone knows this, but most companies are
busy tending to the urgent problems of the day and not focusing on key long-
term issues. Unless your staff can focus on a common vision, the company
can go nowhere. A strategic plan helps direct energy and guide staff toward a
shared goal in an ever-changing world.
Orit Gadiesh, chairman of Bain & Co., says, “In the current environment, com-
panies can’t afford not to have a set of guiding principles — a vision that 
communicates true north to the entire organization.” Can your company be
more focused? Yes, and to help find your true north check out Chapter 6.
Mission, goals, and objectives:
Empowering employees
The mission statement, goals, and objectives are the roadmap in a strategic
plan to empower your employees to be more effective (and you too, for that
matter). Don’t let these elements be just a paragraph on the break room wall
or bullet points in a memo; let them shine as primary guidelines for leading
the organization to higher levels of performance. They provide the framework
for independent decisions and actions initiated by departments, managers,
18
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

and employees into a coordinated, company-wide game plan. Head to
Chapter 6 for more info on developing your mission and Chapter 12 for 
developing your roadmap.
Strategy: Explaining the how
After the mission, goals, and objectives are clear, (see previous section)
establish how you’re going to achieve those items. A strategy provides the
vehicle and answers the question “How are we going to get there with the
resources we have?” A good strategy focuses on efficiency through:
 Achieving performance targets
 Out-performing your competition
 Achieving sustainable competitive advantage
 Growing your revenue and maintaining or shrinking your expenses
 Satisfying customers
 Respond to changing market conditions
Basically, strategies keep your whole company acting together while strength-
ening the company’s long-term competitive position in the marketplace. See
Chapter 14 for more info on helping your employees be more efficient.
Execution and evaluation: 
Ensuring success
A strategic plan is a living, dynamic document. It drives your business and
must be integrated into every fiber of your organization, so every employee
is helping to move the company in the same direction.
All the best missions and strategies in the world are a waste of time if they
aren’t implemented. To be truly successful, the plan can’t gather dust on the
bookshelf. You know what shelf I’m talking about. If you ran the white glove
over the shelf, you’d find layer upon layer of dust. You really should clean
more often.
No, strategic planning success isn’t about cleaning, it’s about keeping the
plan active so that it doesn’t gather that proverbial dust. Know what your
end result looks like and where your milestones should be. Plan your near
term actions and evaluate your progress each quarter. Are you where you

Chapter 1: What Is Strategic Planning Anyhow?

thought you’d be if you had been on target? Or, if you’re off target, how far
are you off? The course correction to put you back on track becomes your
next action plan.
When your company has a clear plan and acts accordingly to the plan, you’re
going to go from where you are, to where you want to go, therefore ensuring
your success! Check out Chapter 14 for more on this topic.
Tips for Better Strategic Planning
Before you get too far into your strategic planning process, check out the tips
below — your quick guide to getting the most out of your strategic planning
process:
 Pull together a diverse, yet appropriate, group of people to make up
your planning team. Diversity leads to a better strategy. Bring together
a small core team — between six and ten people — of leaders and man-
agers who represent every area of the company.
 Allow time for big picture, strategic thinking. We tend to try to squeeze
strategic planning discussions in between putting out fires and going on
a much needed vacation. But to create a strategic plan, your team needs
time to think big. Do whatever it takes to allow that time for big-picture
thinking (including taking your team off-site).
 Get full commitment from key people in your organization. You can’t
do it alone. If your team doesn’t buy into the planning process and the
resulting strategic plan, you’re dead in the water.
 Allow for open and free discussion regardless of each person’s posi-
tion within the organization. (This tip includes you — the CEO.) Don’t
lead the planning sessions. Hire an outside facilitator, someone who
doesn’t have any stake in your success. When you do, people wonder
whether you’re trying to lead them down the path you wanted all along.
Encourage active participation, but don’t let any one person dominate
the session.
 Think about execution before you start. It doesn’t matter how good the
plan is if it isn’t executed. See Chapter 14 for more on this topic.
 Use a facilitator, if your budget allows. Hire a trained professional who
has no emotional investment in the outcome of the plan. An impartial
third party can concentrate on the process instead of the end result and
can ask the tough questions that others may fear to ask.
20
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

 Make your plan actionable. To have any chance at implementation, the
plan must clearly articulate goals, action steps, responsibilities, account-
abilities, and specific deadlines. And everyone must understand the plan
and their role in it.
 Don’t write your plan in stone. Good strategic plans are fluid, not rigid
and unbending. They allow you to adapt to changes in the marketplace.
Don’t be afraid to change your plan as necessary.
 Clearly articulate next steps after every session. Before closing the
strategic planning session, clearly explain what comes next and who’s
responsible for what. When you walk out of the room, everyone must fully
understand what they’re responsible for and when to meet deadlines.
 Make strategy a habit, not just a retreat. Review the strategic plan 
for performance achievement no less than quarterly and as often as
monthly or weekly. Focus on accountability for results and have clear
and compelling consequences for unapproved missed deadlines.
Warning Signs That You Need This Book
Planning for the future is important but very few businesses actually do it.
Instead of listing the benefits of business planning and strategic planning 
(see Chapter 2 for those), the following list of warning signs can tell you that
you need a new strategy for your strategic planning process:
 Someone asks where your business will be in one year, and you don’t
have an answer. You ask your partners or management team the same
question, and you hear wildly different answers.
 You have some idea where you want to go in the next year, but you don’t
have any idea what you’re going to do to make next year a reality.
 Your company won’t hit its revenue goals this year. Although there 
can be many reasons for the shortfall, you’re not sure how to grow the
top line.
 There are inconsistencies in your brochure, Web site, sales collateral,
and so on. You can’t understand the content. More importantly, neither
can anyone else. You find that when you explain your business to a
potential client, you tell different stories about how you provide value.
 You’re ignoring your competition. You don’t know who your number one
competitor is and what they’re doing, who their clients are, what prod-
ucts they offer, their pricing, or key message points. When your cus-
tomers ask you to explain why your company is different, you don’t 
have a good response.
21
Chapter 1: What Is Strategic Planning Anyhow?

 Everything on your to-do list is a priority. You don’t know where your
time is best spent.
 Friends and colleagues can’t refer you because they aren’t sure exactly
what value your business provides and to whom. They often ask, “What
is it you do again?”
 You’re presented with a business opportunity, and you are unsure how
to evaluate whether it’s something your company should pursue. In fact,
you normally pursue all opportunities for fear you may miss the big one.
 You enjoy what you do, but you aren’t passionate about your business.
You’d quit everything and follow that passion tomorrow if you could.
 Your business development consists largely of attending networking
events, but you spend most of your time talking to people you know. You
rely solely on word-of-mouth for new customers.
 You don’t know why your customers buy from you. The majority contin-
ues to do business with your company, but you’re not sure what keeps
them coming back. You’ve never really asked.
 You find your clients contracting with other companies for services 
you provide. When asked, they say they didn’t know you offered those
services.
 You ask your employees what success looks like, and they don’t have a
consistent answer. And your incentive plan doesn’t synch up with per-
formance expectations.
 You complain when your customers call because you just don’t have
time to talk to them. And you notice your staff complaining too.
 You don’t do market research or solicit customer feedback because you
(think you) know your market. You’ve been in the industry for years and
you know customers’ need and wants.
 You determine your pricing by looking at your competitor’s prices and
discounting slightly. All your prices are based on your competitors’
offerings.
 You can’t articulate what your company does best, but it’s a good point
of discussion at a cocktail party.
 You’re asked why you’re in business, and your only response is profit.
Do any of these statements sound familiar? If so, it’s time to get serious about
your business and get focused. Having a strategic plan and a succinct strat-
egy brings clarity and focus to your organization. It ensures that your time,
resources, and actions aren’t wasted. If every part of your organization isn’t
pointed in the same direction, you can end up going in circles and frustrating
yourself and your employees. Why not get strategic now and make it your
most successful year ever?

Why Strategic Planning 
Impacts Your Growth
In This Chapter
 Discovering why strategic planning is a leading management tool
 Avoiding failures by making plans
 Leading by example with good strategic goals
 Achieving better results with your strategic plan
 Starting your strategic goals today
S
uccess isn’t a matter of chance but rather a matter of choice. This concept
really encapsulates why it’s important to have a clear strategic direction
and strategic plan. Business success isn’t going to happen by accident. You
must look into the future and create a plan for wherever it is you’re trying to
go. Forget about failure rates and all that garbage. If you aren’t intentional
about the direction of your business or department, you aren’t likely to get
there.
This chapter gives you many reasons why you should care about strategic
planning. If you or your boss need convincing, the statistics as well as the
intangibles are covered in the sections that follow. A peek at what high-growth
organizations are doing can show you how planning impacts your growth.
Reason #1: Strategic Planning Is 
the Leading Management Tool
Over the past dozen years, you may have witnessed an explosion in the use
of management tools and techniques — everything from Six Sigma to bench-
marking. Keeping up with the latest and greatest, as well as deciding which

tools to put to work, is a key part of every leader’s job. But it’s tough to pick
the winners from the losers. As new tools appear every year, others seem to
drop off the radar screen. Unfortunately there’s no Consumer Reports for
management tools, so choosing and using tools can become a risky and
potentially expensive gamble, leaving many leaders stymied.
In 1993, Bain & Co., a leading management consulting company, launched a
multi-year research project to get the facts about management tools and
trends. The objective of the study was to provide managers with information
to identify and integrate tools that improve bottom-line results as well as
understand their strategic challenges and priorities.
Bain has assembled a database that now includes 7,283 businesses from more
than 70 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and
Latin America. The Bain & Company’s 2005 Management Tools survey received
surveys from a broad range of international executives. To qualify for inclusion
in the study, a tool had to be relevant to senior management, topical as evi-
denced by coverage in the business press, and measurable.
The results? Out of all the tools used, 79 percent of respondents use strategic
planning. In fact, strategic planning is a long-time favorite tool, having been
used by more than half of companies in every survey since Bain started this
project. Not surprisingly, the most popular tools are the ones that create the
highest satisfaction ratings. Respondents were most satisfied with strategic
planning out of all 25 tools. See Figure 2-1 for details.

So what does this study tell us? That year after year, strategic planning is
used by companies worldwide with very high satisfaction rates. Strategic
planning isn’t just a management fad likely to blow away. For more informa-
tion on this study, check out the following Web site: www.bain.com/
management_tools/home.asp.
Reason #2: Failing to Plan 
Is Planning to Fail
If organizations fail to anticipate or prepare for fundamental changes, they
may lose valuable lead time and momentum to combat them. These funda-
mental elements of business are customer expectations, employee morale,
regulatory requirements, competitive pressures, and economic changes, 
and they’re always in flux. Many times businesses achieve a level of success
and then stall. Strategic planning helps you to avoid the stall and get off the
plateau you find yourself on. Accidental success is dangerous. Succeeding
without a plan is possible, and plenty of examples exist of businesses that
have achieved financial success without a plan. If you’re one of them, con-
sider yourself lucky, but ask yourself this question: Could you have grown
and become even more successful if you’d organized a little bit better? I’m
willing to bet your answer is yes.
Another danger is that the lack of a strategic plan negatively impacts the atti-
tude of an organization’s team. Employees who see aimlessness within an orga-
nization have no sense of a greater purpose. People need a reason to come 
to work everyday (besides the paycheck). Lack of direction results in morale
problems because, as far as your employees are concerned, the future is uncer-
tain, unpredictable, and out of control. These depressing conclusions can only
be seen as a threat to employment, which negatively impact productivity.
To avoid these dangers, you need to get rid of the naysayers (including possi-
bly yourself). Questioning the value of strategic planning is normal because
planning can be intense and costly, but if the attitude that planning isn’t nec-
essary becomes part of your corporate culture, it can prove deadly. So look
out for the warning signs of indifference:
 Short-term thinking
 Leadership indifference
 Deeply entrenched traditional perspectives
25
Chapter 2: Why Strategic Planning Impacts Your Growth

 Complacency of stakeholders
 Confusion among the employees
 Lack of unity
In the rest of the chapter, you discover why strategic planning can help you
navigate troubled waters. If you don’t have the problems listed above in your
organization but need more proof or ammunition to get those around you
to see the benefits of planning, you also find the backup you need in the next
sections.
Reason #3: The Best of the Best Do It
High-performance organizations have fundamental differences that set them
apart from other organizations. Anecdotally, these companies are better than
their competitors at everything they do. They work more diligently and inces-
santly to improve faster than their competitors.
There are tons of studies out there that dig into the hows and whys of compa-
nies that are ahead of the pack. But instead of getting lost in the details and
differences of these studies, take a look at the basics.
At the end of the day, high-performance organizations accomplish extraordi-
nary results, and they do it with ordinary people. If you keep waiting for
extraordinary people to come along and make things happen, you’re going to
wait a long time. Instead, your goal should be to transform your organization
in such a way that your people are capable of delivering high performance
every minute and every hour of every day.
What makes great companies great
Becoming the best at something is often achieved by modeling the behaviors
of winners and putting those behaviors into practice. Here are the character-
istics of a high-performance company:
 Has a purpose that focuses the energy of all its members (typically, that
purpose is to be the best there is or ever was)
 Simultaneously and continuously maximizes the self-interests of all its
stakeholders
 Outperforms all others (by any measure) not because of what propels it,
but in spite of any and all obstacles that impede it
26
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

 Makes it possible for ordinary people to perform in an extraordinary
fashion
 Transforms its people into owners of the organization’s destiny
 Is a healthy organization committed to being great, no matter what it takes
 Knows that the execution is more important than the strategy
Whereas a strategic plan is the means, growth and high-performance are the
end to those means.
An example of a high-performance company is a mid-sized graphics and print
shop in Georgia. The owner attributes the company’s success, which was rec-
ognized as one of the best in the industry, to the employees’ dedication to the
mission. Its mission includes total focus on customer solutions. According to
the owner, the employees practice the mission, not just preach it. To support
that action, the company enables all employees to be responsible and account-
able for serving its customers. Not to mention that the employees are proud
of their work and take rightful ownership of their accomplishments. To that
point, they perform extraordinary work.
What are successful CEOs 
spending their time on?
Have you ever wondered what the guy next door is doing all day? Or, more
interestingly, what are growing organizations’ CEOs spending their time on?
If you could just be a fly on the wall in the offices of some of the Inc. 500 CEOs,
I bet you’d discover quite a bit about what it takes to grow an organization.
The Inc. 500, produced by Inc. magazine annually, comprises the top CEOs of
the business world. To be eligible for Inc. 500, companies have to be indepen-
dent and privately held, have grown from at least $200,000 in net sales in 
Year One to $2 million by Year Five. In summary, they’re the fastest growing
privately-held organizations in the United States today. The majority of the
Inc. 500 CEOs spend an average of 60 hours a week a building their business.
(This should be a relief to you if you’re putting in such long hours and often
think you’re all alone.)
Although these CEOs are characterized as hard-working, they’re not worka-
holics because they set goals first and take action second. Most importantly,
they take the time to reward themselves and others based on the achievement
of the goals and action. Workaholics, on the other hand, usually take action
first, set goals second, and don’t necessarily celebrate successes. If you’re one
of those workaholics out there, consider the strategic planning process as a
way to help you to set goals and focus on actions you can celebrate.
27
Chapter 2: Why Strategic Planning Impacts Your Growth

The Inc. 500 CEOs regularly spend 50 to 90 percent of their time on strategy
and business development. Obviously an organization isn’t going to be a
high-growth organization if time isn’t spent on both active strategy and busi-
ness development. Granted, 50 to 90 percent is quite a large margin, but it
gives you an idea of how these 500 CEOs spend their time. Take a look at how
you’re spending your time each day, and figure out what it really takes to be
part of a high-growth company.
Reason #4: You Get Better 
Results (I Promise)
Everyone wants better results, right? Those results can be to earn more
money, to use resources better, to create a more effective and efficient team,
to improve your work/life balance, and so on. And strategic planning helps.
The benefits to strategic planning are both intangible and show hard bottom-
line ROI.
The day-to-day impact
Every day your work impacts aspects of your business. In the next sections,
you discover the true day-to-day impact of having a strategic plan in place.
Spend more time on high impact, high-growth activities
High impact, high growth activities are where you want to spend as much
time as possible. With these maneuvers, you spend less time spinning your
wheels. Think back on the past month. Were there any projects or activities
you were part of directly or indirectly that didn’t actually move the organiza-
tion forward because they were dead end opportunities? I bet there were. 
Get rid of this dead weight as fast as possible!
Identify true opportunities versus false starts
If you know what you’re best at and where you want to go, you can more
quickly identify true opportunities versus false starts. You want to pursue
true opportunities and quickly throw out false starts. Strategic planning
helps you to put the boundaries on your business. When you ignore extrane-
ous distractions, you use your resources more effectively and more quickly
to grow your organization.
28
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Adapt quickly
The ability to adapt quickly is the name of the game in today’s business cli-
mate. When everyone on your team is on the same page and is pulling in the
same direction, you can easily absorb shifts, make changes, and innovate on
the fly. If there’s no clear direction in your strategic plan, your team may not
know how and what to adapt to.
Be proactive instead of reactive
Being in a reactionary mode all of the time puts you one (or more) steps
behind your competition. Make sure that your strategic plan maps out pro-
active choices to propel your company forward.
A complaint that I hear from a lot of clients is that they feel like they’re always
trying to catch up. If you’re out of breath, stop running and get ahead of the
change curve. If you have a strategic plan in place and you’re working on key
strategic activities, you have a little bit more time to think about how to take
advantage of market movement instead of always reacting to what’s going on
your environment.
Achieve your vision for success
You started your organization for a reason. You likely have a vision for your
business. You want to achieve your vision for success. You have to specifi-
cally figure out how you’re going to get there. Having a strategic plan makes
success intentional.
Increase employee commitment
Strategic planning increases employee commitment — especially in this tight
labor market, helping your employees see the vision that you have for suc-
cess and growth helps you work toward that goal.
The bottom line impact
As business owners, you care about what falls to the bottom line. I do too. A
major reason my company focuses on strategic planning is because it does
make a financial difference. To verify this, in 2004, we conducted a research
study of strategic planning and strategy execution of 280 firms in the United
States. The bulleted list below provides the results of that study and explains
what you can expect to achieve as well. (Note: To the reader who needs talk-
ing points to convince his or her management that strategic planning is prof-
itable, this section is for you.)
29
Chapter 2: Why Strategic Planning Impacts Your Growth

 Impact on sales volume:
• Of those firms whose top management had a high commitment to
execute strategic planning, 80 percent reported that their sales
volume increased during that year.
• Of the firms whose top management had a lower commitment
(average or below) to execute strategic planning, only 59 percent
reported that their sales volume had increased during the year.
• From another perspective, firms whose top management had a
high commitment reported 12 percent greater increase in sales
volume than did those with a lower commitment.
 Impact on net income:
• Of the firms whose top management had a high commitment to
execute strategic planning, 33 percent reported that their net
income had increased during the year.
• Of those whose top management had a lower commitment (aver-
age or below) to execute strategic planning, only 19 percent
reported that their net income had increased during the year.
• From another perspective, firms whose top management had a
high commitment reported 11 percent better net income than did
those with a lower commitment.
 The role of being proactive:
• Of the organizations whose top management was proactive, 78 per-
cent reported that their sales volume had increased during the year.
• By contrast of those who were more reactive, only 60 percent
reported that their sales volume had increased during the year.
If you compare these stats to the Inc. 500 growth organizations (covered in
“What are successful CEOs spending their time on?”), you notice that these fig-
ures aren’t actually that high. Many of the Inc. 500 companies realized 100 to
200 percent growth over five years. However, the percentage increases listed
above are in addition to the growth you’re already projecting. Therefore, strate-
gic planning helps you either make up part of your growth expectations or it’s
an addition to your projections.
Your new bottom line
To get you excited about strategic planning before you start, why not calcu-
late your new bottom line? With the quick formula taken from the results of
the research above, you can see the potential impact you can expect.
30
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-3 provide you with a worksheet to calculate how prof-
itable strategic planning can be to your business. Figure 2-2 looks at sales
volume or revenue, and Figure 2-3 deals with net income. Note that these calcu-
lations can’t be added together because they’re mutually exclusive. Adding
them together is like double counting. If you’re a not-for-profit, this information
applies to how much greater utilization of your resources you can expect.
ABC Company is provided as an example in these figures. Use your own sales
volume, anticipated growth rate, and net income to determine the impact of
strategic planning on your organization.
Putting Planning into Action Today
Successful strategic planning is as much about picking the right time as it is
about developing the right strategy. Not ready to embark on a strategic plan
quite yet? I understand. How about sticking your toe in the waters of strate-
gic planning instead of diving in head first?

Chapter 2: Why Strategic Planning Impacts Your Growth

One way to start slowly is to forget about all the detailed strategies, goals,
objectives, and so on necessary to put a plan together. Instead, pick one
activity that’s essential to moving the company strategically forward and put
it into action. In the next sections, I’ve provided activities to get your plan
going. Pick one and implement it.
Drive the organization with big vision
Growth requires thinking big and then executing like crazy. Success is ten
percent inspiration and 90 percent persistence. But that ten percent is criti-
cal, otherwise the 90 percent is lost, aimless, and unproductive. Don’t lose
sight of the big ticket items while you’re focusing on the small goals. That
way, you head in the right direction to meet your goals. Chapter 6 provides
tons of examples of big visions and helps you to develop yours.
Establish big goals
Every organization sets goals, but sometimes they aren’t big, and sometimes
they’re not written down! A big vision is achieved through accomplishing big
objectives and goals. That’s all execution really is – your organization’s abil-
ity to achieve goals. An example of a big goal is to be the best, number one,
or leader in your industry. A small goal is to sell a set dollar volume in goods
and services. Here a few best practices to help you establish big goals that
get results:
1. Objectives and goals must be understood.
Everyone needs to understand how the people contribute to and impact
the goals.
2. The goals must be measurable and actionable by appointing someone
responsible and having a due date.
Review regularly and hold people accountable.
3. Create a culture that makes people feel responsible for not missing a
deadline.
That’s all there is to it — it doesn’t have to be complicated, confusing, or
time consuming.
32
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Celebrate wins
Publicly share big accomplishments, milestones, project completions, and
revenue goals. This sharing drives growth in two ways:
 It motivates the people driving those accomplishments to press on.
 Success and profit sharing breeds confidence, fueling enthusiasm for 
further growth.
Everyone wants to be appreciated, and you may fall into the routine of
dwelling on what you’ve failed to achieve instead of celebrating the small
wins. By rejoicing in the achievements of your employees and the achieve-
ments of your plan, you create an atmosphere with a feeling that you’re in
this together.
Seek out new ideas
Invite left and right-brained people into your organization to create a com-
plete brain trust of skills and competencies. Your left-brained folks bring the
analytical perspective to the table. They think of things like analyzing data 
for discoveries and exploring parallel industries for new methods. The right-
brained people focus a bit more on creativity and can invent creative solu-
tions, challenge the status quo, find hidden connections, and see new models.
The sharing of ideas can have a huge impact on your business. Take these
instances for example:
 Henry Ford couldn’t have grown faster than everyone else had he not
borrowed the division of labor manufacturing line concept from a meat
packing plant.
 Walgreens couldn’t have grown as fast as they did had they not changed
their approach to increased convenience instead of big store, big ticket
items.
 Southwest couldn’t have grown had they not reinvented airline service
by putting its employees first, which drastically improved customer 
service.
Challenge conventional wisdom to solve your customers’ issues and pains
with non-traditional approaches.
33
Chapter 2: Why Strategic Planning Impacts Your Growth

Ignore distractions
In tandem with new ideas, you must focus! Focusing is a never-ending strug-
gle for entrepreneurs — too many ideas, too few resources. But you must
ignore distractions, so you won’t derail your plan.
In an increasingly competitive environment, growth comes from being great at
one thing at a time. Succeed at one thing that you know customers need. That
takes focus on the customer and focus on what you choose to do better than
anybody. Use your vision as a filter to keep out distractions. If the activity isn’t
in line with your big goals, even if it’s a good idea, table it and move on.
Empower through ownership
Taking ownership is similar to accountability. Entrepreneurs like to build and
own their work. They are achievement-oriented and take pride in results.
Empower your people by assigning ownership. Recognition is the number
one motivator. You can unleash powerful output by clearly defining roles and
responsibilities. Give ownership of key business metrics. Then give that indi-
vidual or team the autonomy and authority to drive that revenue past the
forecast!
Neutralize negativity
If you want your company to be successful, you have to squash the negative
attitudes throughout the entire employee network. Have the attitude that
there’s no such thing as trying, only doing. That attitude can bring sustain-
able growth to your company.
Hang signs around your office that say, “What do we need to make it?” not
“Are we going to make it?” Have answers ready for how you can make it.
Remember to be realistic because most growth companies don’t grow quickly
without sustaining some damage. Consider how to avoid road blocks and
road bumps along the way.
Be passionate
If you’re motivated and excited about what you’re doing, people will follow
and your organization will grow because positive attitudes and energy are
contagious. Having and showing passion about your work may be the most
important elements because there’s true spirit behind growth.

makes it less confusing is understanding how all the parts of a plan work
together.
Planning doesn’t have a set rule book, so no common language exists. People
refer to objectives as goals and to goals as objectives. Mission gets confused
with vision and no one seems to know where strategies actually fit in. Then
you have indicators, measures, metrics, targets . . . 
This chapter (or book for that matter) won’t stop the debate between seman-
tic differences. But in this chapter, you do look at the elements of a strategic
plan, understand the planning process itself, assess if you’re ready to begin,
and discover how to spot the pitfalls inherent in the process.

The Elements of a Strategic Plan
Not to oversimplify the planning process, but by placing all the parts of a
plan into three areas, you can clearly see how the pieces fit together. The
three pieces of the puzzle are
 Where are we now?
 Where are we going?
 How will we get there?
Each part has certain elements to show you how and where things fit it. For a
visual on this discussion, see Figure 3-1. 
Here’s an outline of a typical strategic plan:
 Mission statement: To define the organization’s core purpose. Why do
we exist? 
 Vision statement: To explain where you are headed, your future state.
To formulate a picture of what your organization’s future makeup will be
and where the organization is headed. What will our organization look
like in 5 to 10 years from now?
 Values statement or guiding principals: To clarify what you stand for
and believe in.

Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

 SWOT: To assess the particular strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats that are strategically important to your organization. (You
may or may not choose to include your SWOT in your strategic plan but
as supporting documentation.)
 Competitive advantage: To define what you are best at. What can your
organization potentially do better than any other organization?
 Strategic objectives: To connect your mission to your vision. Strategic
objectives are long-term, continuous strategic areas that get you moving
from your mission to achieving your vision. What are the key activities
that you need to perform in order to achieve your vision?
 Strategies: To establish a guide that matches your organization’s strengths
with market opportunities to position your organization in the mind of
the customer. Does your strategy match your strengths with how you
will provide value and be perceived by your customers?
 Short-term goals/priorities/initiatives: To set goals that converts the
strategic objectives into specific performance targets. Effective goals
clearly state what, when, how, who and are specifically measurable.
What are the 1- to 3-year goals you are trying to achieve to get to your
strategic objectives?
 Action items/plans: To set specific actions plans that lead to implement-
ing your goals. Are your action items comprehensive enough to achieve
your goals?
 Scorecard: To measure and manage your strategic plan. What are the
key performance measures you can track in order to monitor if you are
achieving your goals?
 Financial assessment: To determine if your strategic plan makes finan-
cial sense. Do the estimated revenue projections exceed your estimated
expenses?
But what matters most is having a strategy and therefore a strategic plan that
is effective. An effective plan and execution require several elements:
 Purpose-driven: A plan based on a mission and a real, true competitive
advantage is key. Without it, what is the point of the plan or the organization?
 Integrated: Each element supports the next. No objectives that are dis-
connected from goals and no strategies that sit all alone.
 Systematic: Don’t think of the plan as one big document. Instead, give it
life by breaking into executable parts.
 Dynamic: Not a static document, but a living document.
37
Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

 Holistic: All areas of organization are included. Don’t plan based on
departments first because you risk limiting your thinking. Plan by think-
ing about the organization as a whole entity and then implement on a
department by department basis.
 Understandable: Everyone gets it. If anyone, from the top of the organi-
zation to the bottom, does not understand the plan or how they fit in, it
won’t work.
 Realistic: You can implement it. Don’t over-plan. Make sure you have the
resources to support the goals you decide to focus on.
Where are we now?
As you think about where your organization is now, you want to look at your
foundational elements (mission and value) to make sure there has not been a
change. More than likely, you will not revise these two areas very often. Then
you want to look at your current position or your strategic position, which is
where you look at what is happening internally and externally to determine
how you need to shift and change Here are your foundational elements:
 Mission statement: The mission describes your organization’s purpose —
the purpose for which you were founded and why you exist. Some mis-
sion statements include the business of the organization. Others explain
what products or services they produce or customers they serve.
Does your mission statement say what you do? Why does your organiza-
tion exist? See Chapter 6 for more information about creating your mission.
 Values and/or guiding principles: This clarifies what you stand for and
believe in. Values guide the organization in its daily business.
What are the core values and beliefs of your company? What values and
beliefs guide your daily interactions? What are you and your people
really committed to? See Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of values
and principles.
 SWOT: SWOT is an acronym that stand for strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats. These elements are crucial in assessing your
strategic position with your organization. You want to build on your
company’s strengths; shore up the weaknesses; capitalize on the oppor-
tunities; and recognize the threats. See Chapters 7 through 10 for more
info on SWOT.
38
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Where are we going?
The elements of the question Where are we going? help you answer other
questions, such as, What will my organization look like in the future? Where
are we headed? What is the future I want to create for my company? Because
the future is hard to predict, you can have fun imagining what it may look
like. The following elements help you define the future for your business:
 Sustainable competitive advantage: Sustainable competitive advantage
explains what you are best at compared to your competitors. Each com-
pany strives to create an advantage that continues to be competitive
over the time. What can you be best at? What is your uniqueness? What
can your organization potentially do better than any other organization?
See Chapter 5 for more on advantages.
 Vision statement: Your vision is formulating a picture of what your 
organization’s future makeup will be and where the organization is
headed. What will your organization look like 5 to 10 years from now?
See Chapter 6 for info on refining your vision.
How will we get there?
Knowing how you’ll reach your vision is the meat of your strategic plan, 
but it’s also the most time consuming. The reason it takes so much time to
develop is because there are a number of routes from your current position
to your vision. Picking the right one determines how quickly or slowly you
get to your final destination.
The parts of your plan that lay out your roadmap are as follows:
 Strategic objectives: Strategic objectives are long-term, continuous
strategic areas that help you connect your mission to your vision.
Holistic objectives encompass four areas: financial, customer, opera-
tional, and people. What are the key activities that you need to perform
in order to achieve your vision? See Chapter 12 for more info.
 Strategy: Strategy establishes a way to match your organization’s
strengths with market opportunities so that your organization comes 
to mind when your customer has a need. This section explains how you
travel to your final destination. Does your strategy match your strengths
in a way that provides value to your customers? Does it build an organi-
zational reputation and recognizable industry position? See Chapter 10
for info on different strategies.
39
Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

 Short-term goals/priorities/initiatives: Short-term goals convert your the
strategic objectives into specific performance targets. You can use goals,
priorities, or initiatives interchangeably. In this book, I use goals to define
short-term action. Effective goals clearly state what you want to accom-
plish, when you want to accomplish it, how you’re going to do it, and
who’s going to be responsible. Each goal should be specific and measur-
able. What are the one- to three-year-goals you’re trying to achieve to
reach your vision? What are your specific, measurable, and realistic tar-
gets of accomplishment? See Chapter 12 for info on goal setting.
 Action items: Action items are plans that set specific actions that lead to
implementing your goals. They include start and end dates and appointing
a person responsible. Are your action items comprehensive enough to
achieve your goals? Head to Chapter 13 for a discussion on action items.
 Scorecard: A scorecard measures and manages your strategic plan.
What are the key performance indicators you need to track to monitor
whether you’re achieving your mission? Pick five to ten goal related
measures you can use to track the progress of your plan and plug them
into your scorecard. For help with scorecards, head to Chapter 14.
 Execution: In executing the plan, identify issues that surround who man-
ages and monitors the plan and how the plan is communicated and sup-
ported. How committed are you to implementing the plan to move your
organization forward? Will you commit money, resources, and time to
support the plan? See Chapter 14 to put your plan to work.
Before You Start, Are You Ready?
If you’re embarking on this strategic planning journey for the first time, it’s
wise to assess if you’re ready before you start. Successful strategic planning
and implementation require a keen understanding of how well your organiza-
tion can adapt to this new process. Introducing it at the right time is key to
successful adoption.
Assessing your readiness
This is the point in your planning where it is critical to be brutally honest with
yourself. Companies that jump into planning because they assume they are
ready will likely fail somewhere mid-plan and derail the whole process. You
can avoid this completely by honestly answering the questions in Figure 3-2.
These are the key areas for you to assess your readiness.
40
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Ideally, you want to answer all the questions with a “yes.” But that may not
be possible. In my opinion, one of the most important questions is, do you
want to grow? If your organization doesn’t want to grow, strategic planning
isn’t going to be very effective. At the end of the assessment, decide whether
strategic planning is a go or no go. If your decision is a no go, make a quick
action plan to solve the problem where you determined your company is not
ready. If your decision is a go, you should feel confident that your organiza-
tion can move through the planning process, barring any unforeseen circum-
stances that might pop up.
Knowing the right climate for planning
Strategic planning is doomed to failure when certain circumstances aren’t in
place. If you’re aware of what you need to make the process work well, you’re
more likely to be successful. If you’re in the middle of a planning process, review

The Step-by-Step Strategic Planning
Process and Timeframe
To put a plan together, you need a system in place to help you achieve the
end result. In a disciplined mode, the process requires a focus and pattern to
stay on track and be productive. Planners take a critical, unbiased look at
what has worked before and what hasn’t. Gather info from any past planning
experiences and use this section to help you run a smooth planning process.
No two companies are alike, and no two strategic planning processes will be
the same. In this section, you find the steps to create your strategic plan. You
may move through these steps in one day or over the course of a year. No
matter how it works for your company, remember that the process is contin-
uous, not linear. Figure 3-3 illustrates the how planning is a continuous
process.
42
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Establishing your strategic 
planning process
You will also want to develop a strategic planning process for your company
that is continuous and cyclical. The speed and frequency at which you move
through the process is up to you. Some organizations do it quickly and regu-
larly, others on an annual or bi-annual basis.
Here’s an overview of the strategic planning process to get you started:
1. Get ready.
Identify specific issues and choices the process needs to address; clarify
roles, create a planning committee, develop an organization profile, and
identify the information that must be collected to help make sound deci-
sions. For tips on these processes, see “Before You Start, Are You Ready?”
in this chapter.

Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

Reach a consensus on why the organization exists; determine its pri-
mary business, identify your values, and create an image of what suc-
cess looks like. For tips on these processes, see Chapter 6.
3. Review your strategic position.
Gather up-to-date information on internal strengths and weaknesses and
external opportunities and threats so you can develop an understanding
of critical issues. Use the SWOT tool to organize your information (see
SWOT info in Chapters 7, 8, and 9).
4. Agree on priorities.
Identify the broad approaches (strategies) for addressing critical issues
and the results to be sought (long-term and short-term objectives and
goals). See Chapter 12 for info on these approaches. Then you and your
team can agree on key priorities.
5. Organize the plan.
Put the pieces together into one coherent document that is practical,
can be implemented, and easily managed and monitored. (See Chapters
13 and 14.)
6. Identify your next actions.
After the plan is together in one cohesive document (Step 5), determine
what actions to take next for each team, individual, and department.
(Flip to Chapter 14.)
7. Roll-out the plan.
Communicate the plan across the organization so everyone knows the
game plan. For tips on getting the word out, see Chapter 14.
8. Hold everyone accountable.
Monitor your plan by reporting performance metrics at monthly or quar-
terly strategy staff meetings. Keep track of all measures by regularly
updating the organization’s scorecard (scorecards are covered in
Chapter 14). Hold people accountable for making sure organizational
activities are happening. Link these processes to incentive compensa-
tion if possible. Evaluate performance and what is happening. Make cor-
rections based on key measurements. Manage activities to drive future
results. Some of these ideas are covered in the next section, “Making
strategy a habit, not an event.”
Use Figure 3-4 to guide your strategic planning process. It’s a checklist to help
as you develop your plan.

Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

Making strategy a habit, not an event
The purpose of strategic planning is to help organizations make good deci-
sions. If the planning process only happens once a year, planning then becomes
a barrier to good decision making instead of a catalyst. The point is to stop
thinking of strategic planning as an annual event. Instead, consider embed-
ding the strategic planning process into the culture and day-to-day activities
of your company.
Holding meetings helps focus your goals on accomplishing the organization’s
top priorities and accelerating the growth of the organization. Although the
meeting rhythm structure is relatively simple, it requires a high degree of 
discipline.
Each of the meetings listed in the following sections correspond with Figure
3-5, which helps explain what part of the strategic planning process you’re
involved in.
Annual strategic planning retreat
The meeting rhythm should begin with an annual strategic planning session
of at least two days in length. Ideally, you should hold this retreat at an offsite
location. Although this isn’t necessary, it does help shut out distractions.
During this session, the team reviews how well they’re executing their busi-
ness strategies and achieving the targets they set. The review process goes
as follows:
1. Start with a review of the mission, vision, and values.
Make sure that these statements are current and still relevant to your
organization.
2. Assess the long-term business assumptions and conduct a traditional
SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis.
This step provides a current understanding of the marketplace and the
true capabilities of your organization. (SWOT analyses are covered in
Chapters 7, 8, and 9.)
3. Identify the long-term strategic objectives.
Quite often these stay the same for several years, with just a few modifi-
cations. Your strategic objectives are the big mileposts on the way to
your vision.
4. Set short-term goals and action items if possible.
46
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

Normally the team does not spend time in the details; instead, assign a goal
to a team member who can then flesh out how it will get accomplished.
5. As the manager of the strategic plan, collect all of the work completed
in this session and compile it into a final document.
Distribute copies of the compiled document, so everyone knows what
they’re responsible for achieving.
This annual session takes you through the entire strategic planning process
explained in Figure 3-4 from Steps 1 to 7.
Quarterly planning update
At these standalone meetings, which last anywhere from two hours to half a
work day, the team assesses these issues and items:
 Any changes in their operating environment
 How well they accomplished their goals to date
 A scorecard report
 What modifications may need to be made to goals
The primary question at these sessions is, “Based on what we know today,
what are the most important and impactful items that the organization needs
to accomplish in the next quarter to achieve its annual priorities and targets
and move closer to attaining its envisioned future?”
The strategic plan manager should update the strategic plan and distribute
the revised plan accordingly.
The quarterly sessions take your team quickly through Step 3 of the strategic
planning process, but the majority of the time is spent on Steps 4 through 8
of the process in Figure 3-4.
Monthly strategy meetings
During these meetings, which should last from 30 to 60 minutes, key team
members report on the progress they have made towards goals they are
responsible for, including reporting on metrics in the scorecard they have
been assigned. The agenda should include 10 to 15 minutes to work on one
specific topic, or on one of the quarter’s priorities where decisions need to
be made. Once defined, the topic should be carried to conclusion. Do not
waste time debating several different topics that cannot be brought to con-
clusion. See Chapter 14 for a guide on how to run these meetings.
47
Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

Monthly strategy meetings focus on Steps 6 and 8 of the process. If modifica-
tions to the plan need to be made, the plan manager can revisit Steps 5 and 7. 
Making your process go smoothly
Strategic planning is a process that you want to flow smoothly, but I’ve had to
face the facts: When I plan for a smooth ride, it never goes that way. Something
always throws a wrench in the plan: It’s an unpredictable process. Fresh ideas
at an afternoon meeting may change decisions made earlier in the day.
But I don’t want you to get frustrated, so I’ve included a few tips to help your
process move along with less uncertainty:
 Think about execution before you start planning. A strategic plan that
sits on the shelf is a colossal waste of time and energy (of which no one
has extra to give away!). Outline your ideas on how you see the plan being
implemented. Even better, talk to your key employees and get everyone’s
buy-in on executing the plan before you actually put the plan together.
Consider reading Chapter 14, which focuses on execution.
 Determine if you want a top-down or bottom-up planning process.
• A top-down approach involves the board and executive team setting
the vision and long-term goals and the staff developing the short-
term goals and actions.
• A bottom-up approach works with the staff developing the whole
plan and submitting it to the board and executives for approval.
Normally, organizations end up somewhere between these two extremes.
What is important is deciding who takes the first pass at developing the
vision and long-term goals because these are the guidelines for the rest
of the plan.
 Commit to a schedule. Set a very specific deadline for when the plan
needs to be completed. Additionally, set the schedule for ongoing strat-
egy meetings and reporting.
Use a large desk calendar to map out the whole year as you embark on
the planning process.
 Make everyone feel included. Everyone probably won’t have a seat at
your strategic table, so openly communicate who’s involved in what
step of the process and why. Explain how everyone’s input is being
solicited and how it’s being used.
 Celebrate success. No matter what you do or where you are in your
strategic planning agenda, end your planning days on a high note. Do
48
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

something fun such as play a quick game, run through a fun exercise, or
go out to dinner.
I can’t say this enough because there never seems to be enough time to
have fun. Never let your strategic planning sessions end on a low note
where everyone is feeling overworked and brain dead.
 Don’t over-plan. One of the biggest mistakes in strategic planning is
becoming overly ambitious and overwhelming the company with the
amount of work that needs to get done. When you’re done putting your
plan together, put it away and come back to it a week later. Make sure it
still makes sense and you haven’t planned the company into oblivion.
Selecting Your Planning Team
The values and vision of your organization are embedded in the strategic
framework. As a result, involving the whole organization in at least part of the
planning process is vital. Although everyone can’t be involved in every part
of the process, they do all play a role. In the following sections, I give you
some guidelines for the different people in your organization and who should
be involved when.
Getting everyone involved
Yes, you want everyone involved (at certain times). The next few sections
show you how do it in a way that isn’t a recipe for a disaster.
The role of the CEO
The CEO naturally assumes a prominent role on the planning team, setting
the vision, driving that vision, and enforcing results. If strategic planning isn’t
the CEO’s passion, it will never happen. Only the CEO has the force to drasti-
cally change the company’s alignment. However, during the strategy develop-
ment part of the planning process, the CEO should remain in the background
so that other members’ ideas can emerge.
The visibility of the CEO in the strategic planning process can’t be overem-
phasized. The CEO should attend as many planning sessions as possible —
the annual, quarterly, and monthly meetings.
49
Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

The planning team members
The planning team’s ideal size is 9 to 15 members with an outside facilitator
and an internal coordinator. Planning team members should represent differ-
ent segments of the company — not just the top-level employees such as the
vice presidents, division and department heads, and other executive level
managers who report to the CEO. A team consisting of operating, marketing,
and sales personnel brings balance when it comes to considering internal
and external needs.
Search out key players from your employees, board members, and top man-
agement who can help you strategize. Figure out how to get them involved. If
some can’t take part in person, share early drafts of the plan with them and
get their feedback as the process continues. Make sure you tap your big pic-
ture thinkers as well as get a diverse set of perspectives.
Everyone else, regardless of position
Employees who have a chance to contribute feel they’re making a difference.
It’s exciting to be part of the strategic planning process, so make sure that
everyone has this opportunity. Employees always have different perceptions
from top management on how the business is run. I promise that you’ll be
amazed at the outstanding ideas that come from your employees. To help
ensure planning success, the team must solicit their opinions in a confiden-
tial, risk-free atmosphere.
Try out these ideas to gather employee information:
 Small group meetings. If you have an open and honest company culture,
small groups are a good way to get input from your staff. The benefit to
bringing groups together is synergy that results from the discussion and
brainstorms.
 Anonymous surveys. Online anonymous surveys allow every employee
to voice his or her own opinion, without being influenced by others.
 Assessments. There are numerous staff assessments available that eval-
uate everything from satisfaction to specific actions and strategies. See
Chapters 7, 8, and 9 for more on these tools.
Nonemployees
Also consider the input of people who don’t work for your company. These
folks include customers and suppliers; they frequently have unique insights
into your business. Customers can identify problems the plan should address
and may have ideas about how to improve overall effectiveness. Suppliers
can offer alternatives to operational problems that hinder delivery of prod-
ucts or services to customers.
50
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

The Strategic Plan Manager
The CEO must appoint a respected member of the staff to champion the
strategic plan. The Strategic Plan Manager’s responsibility is to keep the
process moving forward, monitor progress, and alert decision makers if 
the company strays off strategy or off performance.
Although this position may add responsibility to a current staff member, 
managing the strategic plan is critical to the organization’s success. Appoint
someone who’s seeking additional responsibility and is looking to move up in
the organization. It’s a fabulous leadership development opportunity.
Determining who’s involved when
The question often arises, Who should be involved at what stage in the plan-
ning process? Running a strategic planning process democratically is not the
best way to go. Set expectations before you jump into the process so no one
feels blind-sided or left out.
Figure 3-5 maps the different stages of the planning process to the different
groups of people who should be involved. Note: This chart should be used as
a guide to develop your own planning team.
As you can see in Figure 3-5, the CEO and Strategic Plan Manager are involved
in just about every step of the process. Other groups take part where needed.
Going It Alone or Hiring a Facilitator
In an age of facilitators, organizational leaders, and planners for everything
under the sun, hiring a helper doesn’t come cheap. You need to consider
three costs to your company for strategic planning:
 First, you have the value of your participants’ time — more precious
than ever in this time-starved world.
 Second, you have the cost of any facility rental, AV equipment, travel,
food, and lodging.
 Finally, you have the opportunity cost if, following your meeting, plans
and decisions aren’t carried out or your team’s behavior doesn’t change
for the better.

Add these actual and figural costs up, and it’s easy to see how strategic plan-
ning represents a real investment. One way to maximize your investment is to
engage the services of a professional facilitator. Obviously, not every meeting
calls for a facilitator, but your annual retreat probably could use one.
In the following sections, you look at how to run planning sessions yourself
as well as how and when to hire a facilitator.
Running the planning sessions yourself
For any planning sessions that you choose to run yourself, there are some
best practices that you should follow — having a clear agenda, requiring par-
ticipants to come prepared, starting and ending on time, and managing the
conversation in the room.

Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

To run strategic planning sessions, you probably want to gather a set of facili-
tation techniques for different parts of the process. There are a number of dif-
ferent facilitation exercises and methods available to you. Some of my
favorite include the following sources:
 Best Practices for Facilitation: This source is the second in The
Grove’s Facilitation Guide Series and is a user-friendly manual of 176
field-tested group practices. The resource should prove invaluable to
facilitators, managers, team leaders, and consultants looking for facilita-
tion alternatives such as virtual team work, graphic templates, agenda
design, and group decision making. You can purchase the book at www.
grove.com/store/mf_books.html.
 www.iaf-world.org: This Web site from The International Association
of Facilitators (IAF) is the recognized source for credible and valuable
professional help for practicing facilitators. On this site, you find tons of
resources related to the facilitation of best practices.
 www.postit.com: The 3M Post-It Note Web site provides immediate
access to sticky notes of all sizes. A strategic planning meeting without
sticky notes is like an ice cream sundae without the cherry. You can do
it, but it might be boring (and not taste as good — the cherry, not the
post-its)! In all seriousness, the use of sticky notes can help you gain
consensus quickly, keep important ideas and topics posted on poster-
board sized notes, and allow for quick brainstorming.
Using a facilitator
A facilitator brings a fresh perspective to the process. He/she keeps the dis-
cussion on track and encourages all team members to act as equals. An out-
side facilitator levels the playing field between CEO and team members. In an
atmosphere of informality, team members can address any issue within the
organization without fear of unjust reprisal. The CEO should be involved
when appropriate for his/her leadership, knowledge, and guidance.
Finding a good one
Facilitation is different from public speaking or training. It’s not about having
solid content, good platform skills, or an understanding of adult learning
principles. Instead, facilitation involves working with groups of people in the
moment. The job requires being tuned in at all times to what’s happening and
being able to suspend or change the process accordingly.
53
Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

When selecting a professional to guide your session, look for the following
characteristics:
 An understanding of organizational issues (industry knowledge isn’t 
necessary).
 Superb communications skills.
 Can offer insight and empathy while conducting themselves with author-
ity and credibility.
 Experience in running strategic planning processes.
 Conflict management skills and confidence about handling conflict.
 Able to help you clarify your outcomes and a commitment to helping
you reach your desired outcomes.
 Honesty and fairness. (Don’t look for total objectivity. Anyone worth
using has opinions; you just want him or her to make a clear distinction
between opinions and facts.)
 Understanding of group process theory — A good facilitator is able to
apply concepts such as leadership, group norms, team development,
systems theory, dialogue, and experiential learning to the design and
facilitation of your meeting.
 Logic, self-discipline, and the ability to operate systematically.
 A style that suits your organization.
By using an experienced facilitator in the right situations, you almost cer-
tainly accomplish more in your meetings, delve deeper into critical issues,
and then resolve them. Equally important, participants leave with positive
feelings, stronger cohesiveness, a sense of accomplishment, and a renewed
belief in the team.
Deciding whether a facilitator is a good idea
So just when should you use a facilitator? Check out the following important
instances to enlist a facilitator:
 When you want to participate yourself: Most of the time, it’s not possi-
ble to facilitate and participate at the same time. Some people can do it
effectively, but most can’t. If you’re the boss, forget it. You can’t effec-
tively facilitate because people still react to you as their superior.
 When you need to address sensitive issues, including conflict: An out-
sider’s perspective can diffuse heated exchanges and channel intense
emotions into constructive problem solving. Consider solving the con-
flict just with the involved parties and bringing the rest of the team
together after the problem has been resolved.
54
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

 When your team is stuck: A skilled facilitator uses sensitivity to raise to
the group issues that are being avoided and to point out dysfunctional
behaviors that are being denied. The aid of the helper in this scenario
gets the team moving to a new level of functioning.
 When your group must deal with complex issues and a variety of
viewpoints: A seasoned facilitator brings a wealth of group processes
and activities to scope issues, generate options, make decisions and
build consensus.
Futurecasting: Visualizing the Future
In order to make the most of your planning effort, you need to put your
strategic thinking hat on and envision the future. Companies spend a lot of
time predicting what sales will be like in the future, but little time actually
thinking about the factors that impact that future. These factors include
 Underlying dynamics
 The sweeping trajectory of new competition
 The way customers evolve
 The collision course one industry may be on with another
Consider starting off your annual strategic planning retreat by futurecasting —
the practice of trying to envision your company’s future. Really push your
team to think about what will be happening in five or ten years.
A strategic plan is as much about the planning as it is about the strategizing.
Futurecasting helps you really push your big picture thinking to develop a
strategic plan that’s truly, well, strategic.
Getting into the right frame 
of mind for futurecasting
Unfortunately, most people can’t just jump mentally from now to the future. A
mind-bending exercise can help your team get their creative juices flowing.
Ask your team the following questions in a group setting. Read the answers
after everyone has responded in an open setting. (Note: Some may have
heard this before, so ask those already wise-ones to stay quiet.)
55
Chapter 3: Getting Set Up for Successful Planning

 How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator? The correct answer: Open
the refrigerator, put the giraffe in, and close the door. This question tests
whether you tend to do simple things in an overly complicated way.
 How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator? Wrong answer: Open
the refrigerator, put in the elephant, and close the refrigerator. Correct
answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant,
and close the door. This tests your ability to think through the repercus-
sions of your actions.
 The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals attend
except one. Which animal doesn’t attend? Correct answer: The ele-
phant. The elephant is in the refrigerator, remember? This tests your
memory.
 There is a river you must cross. But it’s inhabited by crocodiles. How
do you manage it? Correct answer: You swim across. Why? All the croc-
odiles are attending the animal conference. This tests whether you learn
quickly from your mistakes.
According to Accenture Consulting, around 90 percent of the professionals
they tested got all questions wrong. But many preschoolers got several cor-
rect answers. Accenture Consulting says this conclusively disproves the
theory that most professionals have the brains of a four-year-old.
Leaving your assumptions at the door
You’re dead in the water if you let your assumptions take over strategic 
thinking. Ask your team to think about how they solved the brainteaser in 
the previous section. Relating to that problem, how would they answer these
questions:
 What assumptions have you made?
 What rules have you assumed?
 How do your own perceptions influence the world you inhabit?
 How do you see the world and how is your view different from that of
other people? What advantages and disadvantages are there of each way
of thinking?
With those thoughts in mind, how can you and your team think differently?
How would your team answer these questions when imagining the problem
from someone else’s angle? Have your team think about the following ideas
as they relate to a different viewpoint:
56
Part I: Laying the Foundation for Your Strategic Plan 

 What happens in other countries/cultures/companies?
 How can you change the situation to make a solution work?
 Visit or read about other people’s lives and try to understand why they
think in the way they do. (Maybe not the animal kingdom!)
Working a strategic thinking exercise
It’s time to apply strategic thinking to your business. Have your team try to
answer the following scenario:
What will your company look like and how will they compete in the year
2015? What trends do you need to consider in your planning?
Ask your team to come up with a list of ideas, statements, or activities to
describe how the world looks in these five areas:
 Economically
 Socially
 Politically
 Technologically
 Ecologically
With these lists on the wall, consider which trends apply to your business.
Use this information as you’re developing goals and objectives for your
strategic plan:
 How can this trend influence our current customers?
 How can it influence our current core business?
 How can it create new customers?
 Who are the potential customers?
 What are our competitors doing about this trend?
 How fast is this trend developing? What accelerates it or slows it down?
 What are the risks of committing to this trend? What are the rewards?

In this part . . . 
A
great strategic plan is based on your organization’s
core, which encompasses your purpose, mission,
values, and competitive advantage. You may have devel-
oped your core during your years (or months) of operation,
but in this part, you take what you already know about
your company, customers, market, and competitors and
develop stage one of your strategic plan. You review the
last year to determine what went well and what could’ve
gone better, and then you develop or revise your mission,
vision, and values. You also examine your competitive
advantage to establish what your organization does that’s
unique and better than the rest.

D
idn’t you always hate it when your mom (or grandma) would say, “Back
in my day. . . .” Yeah, yeah, I know. You walked everyday to school
uphill both ways in a perpetual snowstorm. God bless her for trying to share
her past, but it always seemed so trying. The future’s much more exciting
than the past. The future is where the action is. It’s moving. It’s shaking. It’s
sexy and bright. The past just slows us down. It’s like getting stuck in
molasses or running underwater. Or is it?
Learning from your past can save hours and hundreds of dollars spent on
fruitless activities. Ignoring your past can be very costly because you aren’t
adding to your knowledge base. Instead, you’re just continually trying new
things. By taking a good look at your past performance, you can move 
faster into the future by avoiding roadblocks and pitfalls you’ve already
encountered.
In this chapter, you look at your past performance. You don’t have to spend
too much time wandering down memory lane, but taking a few hours by 
yourself or with your team to work through the exercises in this chapter 
may pay high rewards in the future. With a better understanding of what 
happened last year and the years before that, you’re able to catapult your
company’s growth by developing a strategic plan based on your operating
history.

Reviewing What Happened Last Year
Because you’re not a new organization, you’ve accumulated invaluable infor-
mation about your past activities, customers, employees, and financials that
can help prevent do-overs. Tap into that invaluable resource to review last
year’s performance.
As a first step in your strategic planning process, use the questions in the 
following section to guide your review of last year. Conduct the review either
individually, by requesting that employees respond to the set of questions
from the list below, or facilitate the discussion in a regularly scheduled staff
meeting. You can add this information to your SWOT, which is covered in
Chapter 9, or use it simply as a standalone exercise.
When you have identified your successes and failures, look at what goals 
and objectives continue into this planning year. Create a notes page labeled
“Goals and Objectives” and start a list of potential items you want to include
in this year’s plan based on your lessons from the past.
Recognizing what you achieved
Everyone wants to feel successful and recognized for a job well done, but it’s
human nature to brush by achievements. By listing what you achieved last
year as an organization, you help motivate and inspire your team to work
smarter and harder in the coming year. Additionally, why not try to replicate
what did work well last year? Here are some questions to get the conversa-
tion started:
 What goals did we achieve? Why?
 What hurdles or challenges did we overcome? How?
 What new customers did we acquire? How?
 Who joined our team?
 What were the bottom-line results we achieved? (Also see the end of this
chapter for more discussion of this area.)
 What projects were successful? Why?
List your successes on a white board or big sticky note and leave them
posted for a few weeks. Ask your employees to add to them as they see fit.
This lets your team know that last year’s achievements were important. 
Dig into the hows and whys of your actions to make the list as specific as
62
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

possible. When you have your list, use it to guide your planning efforts in the
coming year. You can add the achievements to your list of strengths in your
SWOT (see Chapter 7).
Understanding why you failed
Success and failure are like peanut butter and jelly. It seems like you can’t
have one without the other. More than likely, you didn’t achieve everything
you expected to last year. Even more to the point, you may have a goal or a
project that rolls over from one year to the next. You’ve identified it as impor-
tant, but you can’t seem to move the ball down the field. Now is the time to
figure out why. 
As with your successes (previous section), use the following questions to
identify last year’s failures and determine what you need to do this year to
prevent a repeat performance. 
 What lessons did we learn last year?
 What decisions would we have changed in the past year?
 What goals or projects did we not accomplish? Why?
 What roadblocks or hurdles do we keep stumbling into? Why?
 What challenges did we fail to meet over the past few years? Why?
Use the responses to these questions to fill out the weaknesses section of
your SWOT (see Chapter 7).
Eliminating pesky problems
If you’ve identified a problem or a roadblock that just won’t go away, it’s time
to do something about it. Every organization experiences two types of prob-
lems: gremlins, or small annoyances; and monsters, which are big, scary,
strategic issues. Tackling gremlins is easy because they’re quick to extermi-
nate. They’re identifiable and solvable. Monsters, on the other hand, are
often so big that it’s easier to ignore than confront them. If monsters aren’t
dealt with, they can eventually be the undoing of an organization.
If you have either gremlins or monsters, here’s a quick problem solving
process:
63
Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

1. Define the problem.
This part is both the most obvious and hardest of this exercise. Resist
reacting to what you and your team think the problem is. Instead, work to
understand what the problem is. Write down a clear problem statement.
2. Determine the causes of the problem.
Dig into the why of the problem. Get input from your team to help iden-
tify the causes. Write the cause of the problem by answering who, what,
why, when, and where.
3. Identify alternative solutions to the problem.
Brainstorm for solutions to the problem. List everything that’s suggested
or comes to mind.
4. Select the best solution.
Which solution is the most likely to solve the problem for the long term?
Do you have the time and money to execute the solution?
5. Put an action plan together.
Develop a quick action plan to implement the best solution. What needs
to happen in the next 30, 60, and 90 days? Remember a solution that
someone is “just going to try harder” isn’t going to solve the problem.
6. Verify if the problem has been eliminated.
Check back after the action plan has been completed. Is the problem
resolved? Take away lessons for the future. What changes can be made
to avoid this type of problem in the future?
The above procedure can be done as part of your strategic planning process
or on an as-needed basis.
Evaluating Your Products and Services
By looking at the financial performance of your products and services over
the past several years and matching it up with market attractiveness, you can
identify which products and services to use to grow. Every organization has a
portfolio of products or services that it offers to its customers. That portfolio
needs to be managed just like your personal investment portfolio. In the finan-
cial world, you buy and sell stocks and bonds to yield the highest return.
When an investment is no longer generating a positive return, you ask your
investment advisor to sell it and find something else that’s performing with 
a better return.
64
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Managing your product/service portfolio is no different. Although you proba-
bly don’t have as many products or services as you do stocks or bonds and
you’re likely to move slower between deciding when to buy or sell, the princi-
ple is the same. You want to invest in products and services that are doing
well and divest the ones that aren’t.
Without a doubt, every company has one or more products or services that
are losing money. (Although you may be an exception to the rule, this tends
to happen more often than not.) The big issue is that most businesses don’t
know which of their products and services are winners and which ones are
losers.
The primary reason for not being able to figure out the difference is that the
monthly financial reports are consolidated. They don’t shed light on how
each product in your portfolio is performing. You want to be sure that you’re
selling a product or service for less than it costs to produce it, which is called
your gross profit. To get to beyond your gross profit, you have to dig deeper
into your numbers.
Picking the winners
Determine the period of time before you start. You may choose to look at 
last year’s performance, but that may not provide you with enough history.
If possible, look at how each product and service has performed over the
past three years.
Before you start on this exercise, remember that some products or services
may still need to prove themselves and others may be integral to another
item in your portfolio. And some clients generate enough revenue that they
help even out work flow. So while you assess the profitability of each product
or service, pay attention to how it interacts with the rest of your portfolio.
In some instances, it may be enough for the product just to contribute to
overhead costs.
Open up a new Excel spreadsheet and determine your winners and losers by
following these steps:
1. Create a column for every primary product or service (or client) you
provide across the top of the spreadsheet.
Start with Column B.
2. In Column A, down the left side of the spreadsheet, label the first line
Sales, and then list all the expenses directly related to producing the
product or service (also called cost of goods sold), and then label the
next line Gross Profit.
65
Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

Then in the expenses, you can include all the components of selling and
marketing each of your products or services such as advertising, mar-
keting, commissions, royalties, and so on.
3. Fill in each line on the schedule for each product or service.
This may take some digging as some numbers may not be readily avail-
able. If you can’t find the number, make an educated guess. Make sure
that when you add up the columns, you end up with numbers that agree
with your income statement.
4. Add up all the expense lines and subtract this sum from your sales
line to determine the gross profit for each product you sell.
You might be shocked to find a lot more of your products, services, or
clients have a negative or smaller gross profit than you thought.
5. Repeat this process for each of the past three years.
Add the gross profit lines for each product and year together. Use a 
separate spreadsheet for each year.
6. Identify which products, services, and clients are winners and which
are losers.
The larger the gross profit, the bigger a winner it is.
Service companies may want to evaluate your service lines, as well as your
clients. Which of your larger clients are profitable or winners and which are
losers? Follow the same steps above to make this determination.
Dumping the losers
Consider eliminating those products or services that are losing money or
firing clients that are losers (not losers themselves, but those who aren’t
making you money). Take a look at how much money you could immediately
put to the bottom line by not engaging in activities that are losing money.
Don’t forget that some products may experience seasonality issues and some
may be complementary products/services. Evaluate your findings with your
specific business issues in mind.
Another option is considering raising the prices of products, charging higher
service fees, or increasing rates to your clients. Alternatively, you can run
through the problem solving activity in the previous section to determine if
there’s a way to make the losers profitable. The key isn’t to get caught up in
trying to save something just because you or your staff like it or because you
think you should be able to make money. Know when to cut your losses.
66
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Putting Your Portfolio Together 
(In the Matrix)
After you’ve determined which products or services make money and which
ones take money (see previous section), evaluate which ones to invest in by
looking at how attractive the market is.
A widely used tool for conducting a portfolio analysis is the General Electric
Matrix, developed by the consulting company McKinsey and Company. (Don’t
worry, Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne aren’t are going to make you
swallow any colored pills.) The GE Matrix provides a framework that works with
your products and services as listed in the previous section. The framework
looks at your portfolio based on the strengths of each product/service and
its market attractiveness. Check out Figure 4-1 to see the framework.

Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

Evaluating market attractiveness 
and business strength
The purpose of using the GE Matrix is to fit your products/services in one of
the nine boxes (as shown in Figure 4-1).
Determining what factors make a market attractive and what are product
and/or service strengths can be difficult to pin down. A healthy dose of intu-
ition is also helpful when determining where to place your products and 
services in the matrix. Based on where these items fall, you can use the rec-
ommendations listed below to help guide your planning efforts.
Factors that affect market attractiveness
Although any assessment of market attractiveness is necessarily subjective,
there are several factors that can help determine attractiveness. Use your
knowledge and best judgment to determine market attractiveness. Here are
some key factors that may help:
 Market size
 Market growth
 Pricing trends
 Intensity of the competition
 Overall risk in the industry
 Opportunity to differentiate products and services
The more attractive the item, the higher up you place it on the vertical axis of
the GE Matrix. The less attractive, the lower it’s plotted.
Factors that affect business strength
A key business strength is product/service profitability. Start with the analy-
sis from the sections on sorting out the winners from the losers. The more
profitable, the stronger the product or service. But profitability isn’t every-
thing. Here are some other factors to consider as you plot your products and
services on the GE Matrix:
 Product or service uniqueness
 Brand recognition
 Market share
 Customer loyalty
 Relative cost position (cost structure compared with competitors)
68
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

 Production capacity
 Distribution strength
 Record of innovations
Determine the business strength of each product or service. The stronger it
is, the further to the left you place it on the horizontal axis. The weaker it is,
the further to the right it’s plotted.
Creating your own matrix
After looking at business strength and market attractiveness (see “Evaluating
market attractiveness and business strength” earlier in the chapter), you can
put together your own matrix similar to Figure 4-1 and arrange every primary
product or service somewhere in the nine boxes. Based on where each product
or service falls, the guidelines below help develop goals for your strategic plan.
Here are the options that relate to each of the numbered boxes:
 Grow and invest
• Focus your resources and efforts on maintaining and growing 
products/services in this box.
• Work on improving some of your weaknesses and strengthen your
strengths.
 Selective investment
• Products/services in these boxes are either in a highly attractive
market or capitalize on a business strength.
• Modify your activities to eliminate weaknesses.
• Keep these products/services and concentrate any investments in
promising areas with limited risks.
• Build on the competitive position you’ve managed to secure.
• Invest in areas that build on this advantage and that help you
move products/services in this box to Box #1.
 Harvest and divest
• Focus on maximizing your profits while reducing costs.
• Limit your investment in products/services in this box.
• You may want to divest any products/services in this box.
• Cut costs and don’t invest.

Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

List the goals you develop from this exercise on the note page labeled Goals
and Objectives.
Looking at Your Financial Performance
The financial health of your organization is critical to your corporate growth.
Therefore, evaluating your financial situation is part of your strategic plan-
ning process. Want to know how your business is really doing? Evaluate your
financial performance by looking beyond the numbers on your balance sheet
and income statement. By themselves, these statements are informative, but
not nearly as informative as the relationships between the numbers.
Understanding the financial 
dynamics of your business
Instead of evaluating your past financial statements, analyze the financial
ratios. Financial ratios are derived from pulling two numbers from your finan-
cial statements and dividing one by another. By doing this, you create a ratio
that eliminates any problems of comparing one company to another. With
ratios, you take out any size difference so you can compare apples to apples.
Additionally, you can compare your ratios to your industry averages to 
determine if you’re doing well.
Dealing with financials statements and numbers can be daunting. But don’t
worry. You don’t need to track and monitor everything, just key numbers that
help you understand the financial dynamics of your business. When tracked
and measured regularly, these key financial ratios allow you to
 Get a more accurate understanding of your company’s financial 
performance
 Compare performance against the prior year, current budget, and your
industry as a whole
 Establish benchmarks to see where you’re going and how you’re doing
To make interpretation and management of these ratios easy, I have grouped
them into four categories: liquidity, risk, profitability, and productivity. In the
next four sections, a fictional company, Wacky Widgets, is used to illustrate
the ratios. Don’t worry if your numbers aren’t as large as Wacky Widget’s are.
It’s not the size of the numbers, but the ratios, that count.
70
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Checking your liquidity
Of primary importance to all organizations is the ability to pay their bills on
time every month. The difference between your current assets (those you
intend to convert to cash within a year) and your current liabilities (the oblig-
ations you have to pay within a year) is your liquidity. Your liquidity is the
safety net that protects you from a financial crisis. Here are ratios you need
to look at:
 Current ratio: The current ratio looks out over a 12-month time horizon
and measures the cash available to meet current liabilities. The current
ratio is determined by looking at your balance sheet and dividing cur-
rent assets by current liabilities.
With $300,230 in current assets and $200,100 in current liabilities, Wacky
Widgets’ current ratio is 1.5, which means that for every dollar of obliga-
tion due in the next 12 months, the company expects to have $1.50 to
meet those obligations. You should shoot for a ratio of about 2.0.
 Quick ratio: The quick ratio is a tighter test of your ability to pay your
bills. It uses assets that convert to cash within 60 to 90 days rather than
12 months, typically involving only cash and current receivables.
Wacky Widgets has $271,000 in cash and receivables. Dividing by $200,100
(current liabilities) yields a quick ratio of 1.35. For every dollar in obliga-
tions, the company has $1.35 in quick cash to meet them. You want your
quick ratio to be above a 1.0.
For Wacky, the current ratio may raise a little concern because it’s less than
2.0, but with a quick current ratio exceeding 1.0, they have a reasonable cash
position.
Gauging your risk levels
The mix of your debt and equity indicates your risk level. Although there 
are other ratios that fall into this group, your debt-to-equity is the key to fig-
uring your risk of how leveraged you are or aren’t.
Debt-to-equity ratio says a lot about the general financial structure of your
company. This ratio measures the relationship of liabilities, or other 
people’s money, in the business to the owners’ or shareholders’ money in 
the business. Often, banks are the largest component of other people’s
money and watch this ratio very closely, hoping to see plenty of equity to
support the debt. To calculate debt-to-equity, you divide total liabilities by
owner equity.
71
Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

Wacky Widgets has $110,000 in total liabilities and $389,000 in owner equity,
for a debt-to-equity ratio of .28. In other words, for every dollar Wacky Widget
owners have put into their business, other people have put in 28 cents. “Other
people” would feel fairly safe with a cushion as comfortable as this, meaning
the company isn’t over leveraged. Companies should be concerned when lia-
bilities outweigh equity. That said, every industry has a debt-to-equity ratio
that’s considered acceptable because some businesses require higher capital
investment than others.
Monitoring your profitability
Profitability ratios tell you how well you measure up when it comes to creat-
ing financial value for your company. Although net profit is your bottom line,
profitability is what you’re aiming for year after year. In the previous section,
you looked at gross profit by product or service. Here you look at the prof-
itability of your company as a whole, which includes net profit margin and
return on equity (ROE):
 Net profit margin: Net profit margin is calculated by dividing gross sales
into net profit. If your net profit margin is low compared to your indus-
try, that means your prices are lower and your costs are too high. You
aren’t efficient. Lower margins are acceptable if they lead to greater
sales, more market share, or investing in the future. But make sure they
don’t go too low. High margins are typically never a bad thing. Watch
this ratio each year and use your industry average as a gauge to monitor
your performance.
 Return on equity (ROE): ROE measures how much profit comes back to
the owners for their investment. This ratio is calculated by dividing net
profit by the owner’s equity investment.
Wacky Widgets has a net profit of $65,000 and gross sales of $778,000 for a
pre-tax profit margin of 8.3 percent. In other words, the company is making
8.3 cents on every dollar. The owners of Wacky Widgets have an equity invest-
ment of $294,000 in the company, so with a net profit of $65,000, their ROE is
22 percent. This means that the owners make almost 22 cents on every dollar
invested in the company as equity. A 20 percent ROE is a reasonable return
for risking $294,000.
Measuring your productivity
The ratios in this section give you a good picture of how productive your
company is in using its assets to generate profit. Ratios in this group should
be benchmarked against your industry to determine how well you’re per-
forming and where you might find areas of improvement.
72
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Check out these ratios:
 Sales-to-assets: Sales to assets measures how productive your assets are.
Look at what you’ve invested in to generate sales and how productive
those investments are. This ratio is calculated by dividing gross sales by
total assets.
Our fictional toy company has gross sales of $778,000 and total assets of
$1,120,000, for a sales-to-assets ratio of .69. This means that for every
dollar the company invests in assets, it generates 69 cents in sales. This
might be considered a rather inefficient use of assets. The management
of Wacky should launch an investigation: possible reasons include too
much production capacity or old assets. Outsource production and sell
assets.
 Return on assets (ROA): ROA is another measure of how profitable the
company assets are, and you calculate ROA by dividing net profit by
total assets.
With a net profit of $65,000 and total assets of $1,120,000, Wacky Widgets’
ROA is 5.8 percent. This means the company makes almost six cents of
net profit for every dollar invested in assets. This ratio should be inter-
preted in light of the overall risk, and in this instance, the owners of
Wacky might consider putting the money in a CD and collecting the
interest instead of assuming risk with so little return.
 Inventory turnover: Inventory turnover measures how many times you
sell what’s on your shelves and/or in your warehouse (in the case of a
service company, inventory is time). Turnover is calculated by dividing
cost of goods sold by the cost of the inventory.
Wacky Widgets has a $423,000 cost of goods sold and $115,000 of inven-
tory, for an inventory turnover ratio of 3.67. Dividing 365 days by 3.67
indicates it takes 99 days for Wacky Widgets to sell everything in the
warehouse. The faster inventory turns, the less it costs and the more
efficient operations are. A smart business owner strives to keep inven-
tory turning faster than his/her industry peers.
 Receivable turnover: This is the ratio of the number of times that
accounts receivable amount is collected throughout the year. A high
accounts receivable turnover ratio indicates a tight credit policy. A low
or declining accounts receivable turnover ratio indicates a collection
problem, part of which may be due to bad debts. To determine the col-
lection time on accounts receivable, divide total sales by accounts
receivable.
Wacky Widgets has gross sales of $778,000 and $178,000 in receivables,
for a ratio of 4.3 times a year. After dividing this into 365 days, it takes
Wacky Widgets 84 days to collect its receivables. This number should 
be closer to 45 to 60 days.
73
Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

 Accounts payable turnover: This ratio shows how many times in one
accounting period the company turns over (repays) its accounts payable
to creditors. A higher number indicates either that the business has
decided to hold on to its money longer or that it is having greater diffi-
culty paying creditors. A lower number indicates the company is paying
is creditors quickly. To calculate the accounts payable ratio, divide the
cost of goods sold by accounts payable.
Accounts payable (A/P) turnover for Wacky Widgets are $49,000, with
cost of goods sold totaling $423,000, for an A/P ratio of 8.6 times a year.
So Wacky Widgets pays its vendors, suppliers, and others about once
every six weeks. This isn’t bad, but wouldn’t you want to be paid in
30 days? Thirty days is what you should be shooting for. So Wacky
should strive to pay its vendors promptly.
Sorting out three-year trends
Armed with information about how to calculate financial ratios (see “Looking
at Your Financial Performance” earlier in this chapter), you want to set up a
spreadsheet that shows financial trends ideally for the past few years. If you
don’t have complete financial data, put together ratios for the years that you
do have information on. Follow these steps to get started:
1. Set up a spreadsheet that lists financial ratios down the left-hand side
and the three years across the top.
2. Calculate each ratio for each year based on the formulas provided in
the previous sections.
3. Label the furthest column to the right (the one after the most current
year) “Benchmark.”
4. Enter the benchmark number based on the few recommended levels
provided above, your desired targets, or industry benchmarks.
5. Identify which ratios are performing above or below the benchmark.
6. Determine possible corrective action and list your ideas on the note
page entitled “Goals and Objectives.”
Trailing your numbers over 12 months
You need a dynamic way to look at your performance month after month
because you’d like to see if your growing or shrinking. The Trailing 12 Months
(T12M) chart, developed by Kraig Kramers — founder of CEO Tools — can
74
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

help you track your annual total each month. T12M charts graphically tell
you whether you’re improving or slipping.
Take a look at both Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-3. Figure 4-2 is an ordinary monthly
chart. This type of chart is often misleading and shows little other than season-
ality. On the other hand, Figure 4-3 (a T12M) shows a true trendline on sales,
gross profits, or whatever key data you use these charts to track.

Chapter 4: Taking Lessons from the Past

Here’s how to create your T12M:
1. Open a new spreadsheet in Excel.
Label Column A Month/Year; Column B Monthly Sales; and Column C 
TTM Sales.
2. In Column A, list the months in chronological order, starting with the
oldest date first.
Label January 2005 as J-05, February 2005 as F-05, and so on.
3. In Column B, enter the monthly sales for each corresponding month.
In the J-05 column, enter your January sales. In the F-05 column, enter
your February sales, and so on.
4. In Column C, add the first month’s sales to the second month’s sales in
the same row next to the second month’s sales.
Move down one row, add the sum above it (the first two month) to the
sales in month 3. This is a simple 12-month sum that moves forward one
month (and down one row) at a time. You’re adding the current month
to the running total in the row above.
5. In Excel, select Insert➪Chart from the drop-down menu.
Use the line chart to graph Column C. You should see a trendline going
up or down similar to that in Figure 4-3.
6. Evaluate your T12M chart.
If it’s going up month to month, that indicates positive performance. If it’s
going down, that means you’re performing worse than in previous months.
For additional information on the tool, check out Kraig Kramers’ Web site
www.ceotools.com, where you can print out a version with a full explana-
tion. (Click New Tools Catalog, scroll down to Trailing 12-Month Chart, and
click the PDF symbol to bring it up on your screen and print it out.)
By watching your T12M month to month, you can immediately see if and
when you need to take corrective action. If your trendline is moving upward,
that means keep on doing what you’re doing — growing!
Evaluating your numbers
Evaluating your ratios against those in your industry provides an objective
look at how you’re performing. It helps you to determine how other compa-
nies similar to yours are doing. When you have industry numbers to compare
your company to, you can see if you are performing better than or worse
76
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

than other companies similar to yours. With that information, you can take
corrective action or keep on doing what you are doing.

Focusing on What You Do Best
In This Chapter
 Determining unique strengths that are the basis for your strategic plan
 Identifying what activities are core to your company’s growth
 Knowing what activities set you apart from your competition
 Figuring out how to develop and sustain your competitive advantages
B
usinesspeople and laymen alike throw around the term competitive
advantage like it’s the most common word in the English language. 
Not only is it widely overused, but also it’s widely misunderstood. You aren’t
alone if you’ve ever wondered what a competitive advantage really is and
what you do with it. Your competitive advantage is what you, your company,
or your department does better than anyone else. It’s what makes you unique,
and it’s why you’re in business, and more importantly, why your business
continues to prosper over time.
Think of your competitive advantage as your organization’s DNA — a collec-
tion of genes and attributes that makes you unique. When you are capitalizing
on your uniqueness, you are healthy, fit, and successful. When you aren’t,
you feel uncomfortable, slow, and are exerting more effort than you should.
Not only do I strive in this chapter to clear up any confusion you may feel,
but I also help you uncover your competitive advantage and show you how
to use the advantage in your planning process and business growth.
Knowing Your Competitive Advantage
What’s the number-one attribute Warren Buffet, arguably one of the most suc-
cessful investors in the world, looks for in a company? “Sustainable competitive
advantage,” he told an interviewer. If one of the most successful businessmen of
today puts this at the top of his list, you should too. So what is it exactly?

Your competitive advantage is what you, your company, or your department
does better than anyone else. It is what makes you unique. The sustainable
part refers to your ability to continue to do those activities over a long period
of time. And yes, you can have more than one advantage and you can develop
advantages as well. You don’t have to possess them all at this moment.
I can’t emphasize the importance of understanding your competitive advan-
tage enough. When you really have it nailed down, it helps you and your staff
recognize the following:
 Which opportunities to pursue and which to pass by
 Where to allocate resources and where to cut back
 How to do what you already do well, better
 Know the difference between an opportunity and a distraction
 When to outsource (to another department or externally) and when to
keep it in house
Your competitive advantage(s) is the foundation, the cornerstone of your
strategic plan. Throughout your planning process, you evaluate every part of
your plan to determine whether it supports or detracts from your competi-
tive advantage. In the process, you discover what draws customers to buy
the product or service from you instead of the competition.
Knowing how to define your competitive advantage is the first step toward
applying it to your organization. Ninety-five percent of all companies don’t 
know their competitive advantages, let alone how to use them to communicate 
a compelling reason to choose their product or service. If Buffet examined your
company, would he find what he’s looking for? You find out in the sections 
to come.
The 30-second competitive 
advantage challenge
Here’s a 30-second test to determine if you know your competitive advantage.
A test already? I know; you feel like you’re in school again, don’t you? Don’t
worry — it won’t hurt. Ready?
I meet you at a local networking event and you introduce yourself.
“Hi, I’m Bob Jones with ABC Company.”
“Hi Bob. Nice to meet you. Tell me a little about your company. What is
your company best at?”
. . . 29, 30. Time’s up!
80
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Could you answer my question in less than 30 seconds, succinctly and with
clarity? If yes, go ahead and skip to Chapter 6. If not, don’t worry, you’re in
good company. Honestly, this question is hard to answer; a majority of busi-
nesses are also trying to figure out what they do best. Try to narrow your
focus more than you’re comfortable with. By the end of this chapter (if you
read the whole thing), you should be able to share your competitive advan-
tage with confidence and shout it from the rooftops.
What competitive advantage isn’t
Often starting with what something isn’t is easiest. So your competitive
advantage isn’t a list of your strengths. (Not to down play strengths because
they’re important too — especially in Chapter 7.) But if your competitive
advantage list only comprises strengths, it’s not very competitive now, is it?
You have to be better than your competitors in order to have a competitive
advantage.
A management team from a mid-sized financial services group reported that
its competitive advantages included the following:
 Good reputation in the community
 Skilled staff
 Outstanding team and well-respected leader
 Knowledgeable
 Strong client list and loyalty
 Flexible and responsive
Blah, blah, blah. You’ve heard all this before and so have I. Couldn’t you say
this about almost any professional service firm? This list shows you why bul-
leting your strengths isn’t what comprises your competitive advantage. This
is a list of strengths.
What competitive advantage is
A competitive advantage is something you do that is unique. To compete, you
must have a unique advantage. If you peek at the list in the previous section,
you notice that it’s not a list of unique qualities — basically anyone in busi-
ness today needs to achieve that level of competency just to be in the game.
81
Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best

Specifically, a competitive advantage comes from leveraging a company’s
unique skills and resources to implement a strategy that competitors cannot
implement as effectively or copy.
When the financial services firm went through the exercises that are
described in the next section, “Uncovering Your Advantages,” they uncov-
ered their competitive advantages. Here is what they came up with:
 Ranked in top 10 percent of money managers who beat Standard &
Poor’s nationally
 Fastest-growing American Funds money manager in ‘00, ‘01, ‘02
 Only firm ever featured by American Funds in its advisory newsletter
That’s more like it! Wow! Doesn’t that say a lot more about the competitive
advantage than a good reputation and a skilled staff? This transition is the
one you need to make when explaining the competitive advantage of your
organization or department.
Here are a few more examples from businesspeople who answered the ques-
tion, “What is my company best at?”:
 Sandy, owner of an interior design firm, determined she was best at
increasing developers’ sales ratio by 35 percent and was the only design
team chosen by the top 10 luxury developers in the state.
 A clothing manufacturer named Joe said he was the best at wearable
clothing because “our clothes fly off the racks.”
 The emergency service division of a county in Washington is the best at
providing disaster management and response and recovery efforts for
all agencies within its service territory because of its skilled people and
emergency response equipment.
The remaining sections of the chapter focus on helping you identify and artic-
ulate your competitive advantage.
Why having a competitive 
advantage is so important
Although you can put together a strategic plan without a clear understanding
of your competitive advantage, you’d be missing the boat. Your goals, strategic
82
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

objectives, and action plans tend to change and shift over time. Your competi-
tive advantages, after you’ve identified them, endure and grow stronger. Other
elements of your plan tend to morph. But what makes your company unique is
that your competitive advantages stay constant.
Founding your strategic plan on the basis of your competitive advantages is
the most important thing you can do as a leader of your business or depart-
ment. The leading organizations in this world have a razor sharp understand-
ing of their competitive advantage. Everything they do builds and nurtures
their DNA. You don’t have to be a Fortune 100 company to be that effective.
Uncovering Your Advantages
No company or department can be all things to all people. Some businesses
try and quickly realize that they are spending time and resources on activi-
ties that are not profitable.
What are the sources of your success? What makes your company or depart-
ment unique? Is your success tied to your ability to innovate new products or
services? Or to your ability to respond quickly? Or to your brand and commu-
nity reputation? Or to the creative power of your marketing and sales depart-
ment? It is likely there are many sources that can contribute to your success.
Ultimately, you know what makes your company unique. You live it day in and
day out. However, for your uniqueness to be useful in strategic planning, you
need to state what you know to be absolutely true about your company. Your
list of competitive advantages should make someone say, “Wow, I want to do
business with you.” To get your list of wows, you need to look at your busi-
ness from different perspectives.
Be brutally honest — your insights can be instrumental in moving your com-
pany to the next level. Think about this process of uncovering your unique-
ness like an exercise in genetic exploration. You know there are unique genes
in your department or company. So go find them.
What’s your distinct purpose?
Your organization exists for a very specific reason, and most likely its pur-
pose is different than any other company out there. Companies are founded
83
Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best

for reasons as varied as something to do during retirement to making the
world a better place. Unfortunately, sometimes business owners lose sight of
why they started their business. If that’s you, here are a few questions to con-
sider in determining your purpose:
 Why did I start my business?
 What business am I really in?
 Why does my business exist?
To jump-start your thinking, here are some examples of distinct purposes
from organizations large and small:
 To solve the growing diabetes crisis
 To capitalize on a real estate growth trend
 To work for myself
 To provide quality window and door products better than anyone else
 To make fitness a way of life for everyone by making it fun, easy, and
accessible
 To make my community a better place to live, work, and recreate
through publicly accessible open space
 To provide people with a great place to work
 To be the perfect clown
An excellent way to uncover the purpose of your business from a different
perspective is to talk with your employees. What do they think the distinct
purpose of your organization is? Use the questionnaire in Figure 5-1 to obtain
feedback from all your key staff members. Use your staff members’ responses
to uncover your competitive advantage. You may be amazed at the insightful
comments you receive back from your team. Consider filling out the ques-
tionnaire yourself because that might also surprise you! 
How do you make money?
If I asked you how you make money, more than likely you’d reply by explain-
ing the types and number of products or services you sell. Although your
answer is technically correct, I want you to look at your revenue generation
from a different perspective. For the moment, resist looking at your income
statement. Hey, I said resist! Put that paper down! No peeking.

Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best

Instead of looking at the old income statements, you’re going to gain new
insight into what really drives your profit. Think about your revenue in terms
of profit per X. Here are some examples:
 Profit per customer or client
 Profit per customer visit
 Profit per employee
 Profit per household
 Profit per product or service
 Profit per product or service line
 Profit per region
 Profit per billable hour
You may be tempted to look at the above list and decide that several of these
are your profit engines. The challenge, however, is to determine which one is
actually the best revenue driver for your business. That is to say, they may all
bring money into the business, but one will have the biggest impact. Looking
at your revenue generation from this perspective is just like panning for gold.
You do not need to change your activities, but you might need to look at your
pan from a different angle to see the nugget.
Your profit engine is unique to your business. Below is a list of attributes that
make up a good profit engine. Use this list as well as the examples above to
identify yours.
 Broad measure: A good profit engine is broader than a typical financial
metric such as number of products sold or number of customers per day.
 Customer focused: It should add to the customer experience and
increase your customer focus. For example, by looking at your services
from your customers’ eyes, you may realize that instead of profit per
product or service, your profit engine is profit per customer.
 Improves resource sharing: You only have so much time, money, and
resources. If you can share your resources, you’re increasing their use
and your company’s output. For example, a consultant only has so many
hours in the day. Instead of looking at profit per hour, she could look at
profit per client. Even further, if this consultant has a special methodol-
ogy she uses in her consulting, her profit engine may be profit per number
of uses (books, speaking, training other consultants, licensing, and so on).

How does this relate to uncovering your competitive advantages? The follow-
ing sidebar, “Pegging profitability” provides an example.
Evaluating your business, consider what one measure drives your revenue.

Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best
Pegging profitability
Sam, the owner of a chain of regional retail
auto parts stores, thought his focus should be
on profit per store. Although the profitability of
a particular location is crucial, it’s not the only
variable that counts. As a result of understand-
ing what makes a good profit engine (as
explained in the section “How do you make
money?”), he discovered that looking at the
profit per customer is an even better measure
of profitability. Now instead of stores compet-
ing, they collaborate.
Sam now provides a far superior customer
experience than his competitors because stores
are not fighting for customers. Customers get
appointments quicker and their cars are repaired
faster. Also, Sam can share assets, such as
people and parts, between all the stores. Sam’s
improved customer experience is a new-found
competitive advantage. His scope of services
is not matched by any of his competitors.
Strategic planning is often about doing what
you’re already doing but tweaking it slightly. In
this case, you can see how looking at prof-
itability by customer instead of store can be a
competitive advantage. The retail store now
makes decisions that support the customer
being the profit center instead of the store.
Having a single focus on profitability can help
hone your attention when trying to identify your
key areas of uniqueness.

Why do customers buy from you?
Nothing in business ever happens if money doesn’t exchange hands. More
than likely, your organization has been around for several years because it
provides a product or service that people want or need. Ideally, you’re per-
forming some market research and asking your current customers why they
use your services. But I bet you have a general sense of what it is that drives
people to buy from you. Here are some questions to ask yourself to deter-
mine what is bringing customers through your door:
 How do you help your customers? What need do you meet?
 Are your clients referring your business? Why or why not?
 If you are being referred, what part of your business do your customers
talk about?
 What area of your business is growing? What product or service line
sees the most action in terms of sales?
Even better than answering these questions yourself is asking your cus-
tomers to answer the questions, if you both have time. Pick your top ten
accounts and ask them to respond to the questionnaire in Figure 5-3. Anony-
mous responses yield the best results, so ask a colleague or an intern to
make the calls on your behalf.
Similar responses from different customers to the questions on the form in
Figure 5-3 guide the development of your competitive advantage in Figure 5-4
later in this chapter.
Pinpointing Your Competitive Advantage
Now that you have asked everyone who is important to your business to
define your competitive advantage, it is time to summarize the findings and
pinpoint your areas of uniqueness. Look at the responses to the question-
naires from both your employees and customers as well as your own answers
to the questions from the previous three sections.
In your strategy notebook, capture the common themes or ideas from your
customers, employees, and yourself. Use a separate page for each one of
these perspectives. Collect these thoughts from Figures 5-1 and 5-3.

Perusing a few examples
Learning from others can be helpful in identifying your own competitive
advantage. Check out the following two examples to see how these organiza-
tions define their uniqueness.
Pershing General Hospital is a 125 bed, primary-care facility located in a rural
area with no other hospitals within 50 miles. Because the organization oper-
ates with almost zero competition, it doesn’t need to focus on how to beat
out other hospitals. However, it does need to decide what services to offer
with its limited governmental funding. By offering services that are based on
its competitive advantages, it can maximize the funding it does receive. Here
is what Pershing’s employees and customers said the hospital does the best:
 Provides the one-and-only, high-quality emergency, primary care, and
retail pharmacy within its service area
 Staffs the hospital with personnel that have superior knowledge to sup-
port efficient operations
 Offers the best care possible by maintaining its full staff of highly-
experienced nurses
Surfrider Foundation is a grassroots, non-profit, environmental organization
that works to protect the oceans, waves, and beaches. With 60 chapters and
40,000 members nationwide, the foundation achieves its purpose through
membership dues and grant funding. As with the proceeding example, the
Foundation must focus on its competitive advantages to maintain its funding
and be effective. Here are the themes from the employee and customer 
questionnaires:
 Defined focus on environmental issues that relate to the ocean and only
the ocean
 Committed people who are extremely passionate about protecting the
ocean
 Dedicated to maintaining a bipartisanship view to foster broad-based
support
Stating your competitive 
advantage succinctly
Go back to the fictitious networking event in this chapter in the section “The
30-second competitive advantage challenge.” You needed to be able to

Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

answer what your company was best at in 30 seconds. Here’s a second
chance. Look at Figure 5-4 where your findings are summarized; use the 
formula from that figure to put your list of unique activities into a succinct
statement or bulleted points.
Putting your advantage to the test
It isn’t enough just to have an advantage over your competitors. For your
business to be great, it needs to be sustainable and able to endure the test of
time. You have to be able to combat today’s fierce market forces and uncer-
tainty. Do you want to know why? I’ll tell you.
Think about the graveyard of businesses from the dot-com era. Many of these
companies didn’t pass the sustainability test. You don’t want your company
to be a distant memory. In fact, you probably want it to live on past your
time. And if you’re a department manager, you probably want to see your
department continue on instead of being restructured.

Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best

Here are the cold hard facts:
 Roughly 70 percent of all new products/services can be duplicated
within one year
 60 to 90 percent of process improvements (learning) eventually diffuses
to competitors.
You need to make sure that your competitive advantage is something that’s
long-lasting and not easy to duplicate. So how do you know when you’ve
developed a sustainable competitive advantage? You need criteria to help
you gauge your success. Take a look at the measures below to see if you’re 
on the right track:
 Consistent difference: Customers must see a consistent difference
between your product/service and those of your competitors. This dif-
ference needs to be obvious to your customers and it must influence
their purchasing decision.
 Difficult to imitate: Your competitive advantage must be difficult to imi-
tate. You want to have an advantage that your competition can’t easily
duplicate or don’t understand how to copy. Often this comes in the form
of people, proprietary knowledge within your organization, or business
processes that are behind the scenes.
 Constantly improved: The first two bulleted items in this list must
create activities that can be constantly improved, nurtured, and worked
at to maintain an edge over your competition. The comparison of Wal-
Mart over Kmart is a great example of how one continued to improve its
supply chain management and purchasing whereas the other didn’t.
Unfortunately for Kmart, it lost its edge because it didn’t constantly
improve. Wal-Mart invests in ever-refining its product selection and
processes.
Use the form in Figure 5-5 to quickly evaluate if your advantage withstands
the test of time. The more responses to the right-hand side of the form, the
better, but don’t worry if you don’t pass each one. Think about how you can
add to your competitive advantage to make it even more sustainable. When
you develop goals in Chapter 12, take action to shore up any areas that may
concern you.
92
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Breaking away from the pack
Developing competitive advantages isn’t always easy or straightforward. For
many, a competitive advantage is developed by nurturing a strength over
time. This process turns the activity or intangible asset into something that’s
difficult to copy. If you have a strength where you can break away from your
competition, it’s worth spending your energy and resources to develop it fur-
ther. Here are some great ways to break away from the pack:
 Consistency: One of the hardest and one of the best advantages is the
ability to deliver the same product or service time after time after time.
To do so, a company must have rock solid processes that deliver consis-
tency no matter what.
Think about Starbucks. Everyone says you can get the same cup of coffee
in San Francisco as you can in Chang Mai, Thailand, and it’s true (I had to
find out)! Starbucks delivers high-quality service with consistency time
after time, which is an amazing core competency. In the product world,
this tends to be easier, but in the service world, people are involved
every step of the way. And by our nature, businesses are inconsistent.
Putting consistency into your delivery can be a solid core competency.
TESTING YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Will your customers see a consistent, superior difference between your
product/service and those of your competitors?
No difference --------------------------------- Huge difference
How difficult will it be for competitors to imitate your advantages?
Not difficult --------------------------------- Very difficult
Can your company constantly improve?
Little improvement --------------------------------- Extensive improvement
Figure 5-5:
Putting your
advantage
to the test.

Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best

 Brand development: Growing and developing your brand over time can
be a core competency worth more than all the past years’ marketing
budgets combined. Developing your brand happens by reinforcing your
image in the marketplace through everything you do.
Think Kleenex. You don’t say “Hand me a soft facial tissue”; you say,
“Hand me a Kleenex” even if the brand is something else. Coke is similar.
Many people refer to all soda products as Coke. Those brands have
become the product type they represent.
 Depth of knowledge: Consider how much knowledge you gain in your
business year after year. I like to call it tribal knowledge. The longer
you’re in business, the more that tribal knowledge grows. But it only
feeds on itself if you capture your experiences in a systematic way. Just
as employees can be a key strength, they can also be a key weakness if
they move on without leaving the knowledge with the tribe.
 Continued innovation and improvement: Some organizations excel at
innovation whereas others struggle. Innovation is the ability to develop
products and services that your market wants better and faster than
your competitors.
Intuit, with its Quicken and QuickBooks products, is a company that fos-
ters continuous improvement based on customer feedback. Improve-
ment for improvement’s sake is a black hole. Quicken product sales
show how this core competency can be worth the time it takes to
develop it.
 Longevity: The pure staying power of a company over time can be a tes-
tament to its strength. It’s hard to nurture longevity, but it’s something
that can be leveraged if you have it. Family businesses are great exam-
ples of firms that can use their market history as a core competency.
Using Your Advantages Now
Focusing on your competitive advantages can have a tremendous impact on
your business. If you only have time to work on one part of the planning
process, I recommend spending time to formulate your competitive advan-
tage. By knowing what you’re best at, you can focus on what matters for suc-
cess and profitability.
You don’t have to wait until your strategic plan is complete to put your 
competitive advantages to work for you. Because your list of advantages 
are probably things you’re already doing, you can start doing them better or
even start talking about them to raise the level of awareness in and outside of
your company.
94

Implementing your advantages
Here are some quick uses of your advantages that you can implement today:
 Use your competitive advantages in your marketing material. Turn it
into a tagline. Use it in a press release. Add it to your corporate About
Us page on your Web site.
 Communicate the advantage daily. Include your competitive advantage
in your signature line on your e-mail. Add a line in your voicemail mes-
sage or your automated voice attendant.
 Tell your employees. Post it in common area. Add it to your internal blog.
 Refine it by obtaining feedback from your customers. Ask a few of your
best clients if they agree with your list of advantages. Improve or add to
it based on their responses.
 Make it better. Develop a handful of 30-day actions that you and your
staff can start working on to make your competitive advantages even
stronger.
Measuring your advantages
Now that you’ve got it, why not try to find a way to quantify your most impor-
tant competitive advantage and promote that quality about your company?
Do you have the metrics that matter and support monitoring your unique-
ness? Find a way to support your claim through numbers that you can use to
answer, “Why us?” Establishing a measurement based on a core element of
your business elevates the importance in your organization and helps you
monitor whether you’re sustaining the advantage or letting it slip.
Industry data can be helpful in identifying how to quantify your competitive
advantage. Referral statistics and retention rates offer other opportunities.
Here are other places to look:
 Inventory turns
 Delivery times
 Return rates
 Satisfaction rates
 Guarantees
 Terms
 Referral rates
95
Chapter 5: Focusing on What You Do Best

Putting your advantages in your plan
Your strategic plan needs to include a section that states your competitive
advantage. But you can also include it in full or parts of it in other areas of
your plan. Here are a few ideas:
 Include the intent of your competitive advantage in your mission state-
ment. (Check out Chapter 6 for mission statements.)
 Use the information you collected from your customers and employees
to start the list of your strengths and weaknesses (Chapter 7).
 Develop long-term goals that make your competitive advantage sustain-
able (Chapter 13).
 Include measures to monitor your competitive advantage.

AOL’s advantage: Make it personal
Remember back in the early 1990’s, when
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were spring-
ing up everywhere? If you bought a computer
from a major manufacturer in those early days
of Windows, odds were that you also got up to
three separate trial ISP accounts preloaded on
your computer at the factory. I got CompuServe,
Prodigy, and America Online preloaded in 1993.
Years later, America Online is now the biggest
ISP. Prodigy and Compuserve are virtually
unheard of anymore. How did America Online
win the war? The folks at AOL understood two
key things customers valued at that time:
 Personalization of accounts: A person
could get an e-mail address like joesmith@
aol.com from AOL, whereas Prodigy
assigned him the e-mail address JS12345@
prodigy.com, and CompuServe assigned
56789@compuserve.com. As a cus-
tomer, I want my name if I can get it, or
something else that is personally meaning-
ful to me, like a personalized license plate. If
you could get a personalized plate from the
DMV at no extra charge, would you do it?
Most people would.
 Fewer rules: AOL has fewer rules govern-
ing the virtual community of chat rooms and
bulletin boards. People could pretty much
talk about whatever they wanted to in
cyberspace within AOL, whereas Compu-
Serve and Prodigy had more restrictions on
that kind of activity. Naturally the virtual
community growth was viral, multiplying
their user base tenfold.
Over time, most people picked AOL over the
competition. AOL went for customization and
personalization against the bigger, more well-
funded competition. That’s using competitive
advantage to dominate your space, to grow, and
to become successful!

Most importantly, you use your competitive advantages as a yardstick for every
part of your strategic plan. Chapter 14 asks you to evaluate your strategic plan
based on how well each section supports your competitive advantages.
Thinking about what you do best helps you build the strongest foundation
possible for your business. When you’re looking at your list of competitive
advantages, be careful that your strategies do nothing to weaken your com-
pany’s competitive advantage or take away from the key capabilities that got
you where you are. Remember, now that you’ve identified your DNA, every-
thing should grow from these cells.

W
hile on vacation, a businessman bought fish from an old fisherman
every day. One day he arrived to find the fisherman docking his boat
at noon. “Is something wrong?” he asked. A smile wrinkled the seller’s leath-
ery face. “By no means. All is well.” “Then why are you docking your boat so
early?” asked the businessman.
“So I can go to my house, sit on my porch, and sip tea with my wife,” the fish-
erman replied. The man of commerce objected. “But the day is still young.
You can still fish.” “No need to,” the fisherman said. “I’ve made enough
money for today.”
“Enough? Absurd. You should keep working.” The spry old man stopped and
stared at his well-dressed visitor. “And why should I keep working?”
“To sell more fish.”
“And why sell more fish?”
“Because the more fish you sell, the more money you make. The more money
you make, the richer you are. The richer you are, the more boats you can
buy. The more boats you buy, the more fisherman sell your fish, and the

richer you become. And when you have enough, you can stop working, sell
your boats, stay home, and sit on the porch with your wife and drink tea.”
The fisherman smiled. “I can do that today. I guess I have enough.”
This story, which you’ve probably heard in a variety of versions, quickly
explains the importance of having a clear mission, vision, and set of corpo-
rate values. Knowing why you’re doing what your doing (your mission),
where you’re trying to go (your vision), and how you’re going to go about it
(your values), are the glue that hold an organization together. You preserve
these elements, while your strategies and goals change and flex with the
market. You may modify your mission, vision, or values, but the intent stays
unchanged. So just like the fisherman, you too will have complete clarity
when making critical business decisions that impact your future.
Your mission, vision, and values can sound abstract, esoteric, and downright
fluffy to a lot of people, especially those who are burning to move forward
with a real-world project. These people don’t want to hang back conceptualiz-
ing about people’s wishes and dreams. Don’t let being pragmatic get in the
way of this important stage of building a strong foundation of consensus for
your organization. If you don’t take the time to articulate mission, values, and
vision on the front end, you may pay for it later when you’re trying to write
goals and objectives without a crystal clear strategic direction.
In this chapter, you develop and revise your mission, vision, and values state-
ments. Take a look at your strategic foundation by using the framework in

Assessing Your Mission
A mission statement is a statement of the company’s purpose or its fundamen-
tal reason for existing. The statement spotlights what business a company is
presently in and the customer needs it’s presently striving to meet. To build 
a solid foundation for a successful business, it’s essential to have a written,
clear, concise, and consistent mission statement. This statement should
simply explain who you are and why you exist.
The mission statement of Olsen & Associates Public Relations is “Dedicated
to improving and optimizing public perceptions on behalf of our clients.” If
the company doesn’t live up to this mission, it has no reason to exist.
Elements of an effective mission statement
Your mission statement serves as a guide for day-to-day operations and as
the foundation for future decision-making. Make sure that your statement
includes the following criteria:
 Focuses on satisfying customer needs: Focus the business on satisfying
customer needs instead of spotlighting your product or service.
 Based on your core competencies: Base your mission on a competitively
superior internal strength or resource that your company performs well
in comparison to your competitors.
McDonald’s core competency is providing low-cost food and fast service
to large groups of customers.
 Motivates and inspires employee commitment: Your mission statement
should be motivating. Don’t base it on making more sales or profits but
on employees’ significant work and how the mission contributes to
people’s lives.
 Realistic and clear: Avoid making the mission too narrow or too broad.
A mission needs to contain a purpose that’s realistic to avoid “mission
creep.” Many organizations can go off on tangents that aren’t core to
their purpose and are unrealistic because their mission isn’t clearly
defined.
 Specific, short, sharply focused, and memorable: Write a precise state-
ment of purpose that describes the essence of the business in words
your employees and customers can remember you by.
101
Chapter 6: Refining Your Mission, Vision, and Values

When thinking of a length for your mission, make sure that it can fit on 
a T-shirt. The International Red Cross’s mission is “To serve the most
vulnerable.”
 Clear and easily understood: Develop and write your mission statement
so that you can quickly and briefly tell people you meet at a party or on
airplanes why your company exists. If you keep that concept in mind,
your statement can automatically be short and comprehensible. Make
sure to give your company team a profoundly simple focus for every-
thing it does as a business.
 Says what the company wants to be remembered for: In the end, a mis-
sion statement leaves a lasting impression. How do you want the world
to think of you? Your statement can provide simple insight into why you
do business.
Evaluating your current mission statement
Many mission statements are works in progress. Others have been handed
down over the years to the point that they’ve lost their relevance. If you have
a mission statement, it may be time to dust it off or give it a polishing for
updates or total overhauls. Generally, if five years have gone by and you
haven’t even touched your mission statement, it’s definitely time for review-
ing, fine-tuning, or even rewriting your mission statement.
Sit down with your senior staff or management team and evaluate your cur-
rent mission by using Figure 6-1. Collect everyone’s thoughts and sugges-
tions, but the final decision on how to change the mission is the CEOs. If you
do decide to change it, leave the wordsmithing to one person.
The worst thing for your planning effort is to have a mission statement that is
meaningless to your staff and other stakeholders. Use Figure 6-1 to evaluate
the effectiveness of your existing mission statement.
Writing a new mission statement
You’ve determined the need for a new mission statement. It’s okay; I’m here to
help you start from scratch or even revise the one you currently have. The
three components in the list below can help you craft your mission statement.

Examples of world-class mission statements
Mission statements are as varied as organiza-
tions. Some meet all the effective criteria listed
above and others deviate completely. Here are
a handful of mission statements to get your cre-
ative juices flowing.
 3M: To solve unsolved problems innovatively.
 The Elephant Sanctuary: A natural-habitat
refuge where sick, old, and needy elephants
can once again walk the earth in peace and
dignity.
 Fannie Mae: To strengthen the social fabric
by democratizing home ownership.
 Google: To organize the world’s information
and make it universally accessible and
useful.
 LCJ Marketing Source: To make your com-
pany stand out in the crowd.
 Marine Stewardship Council: To safeguard
the world’s seafood supply by promoting the
best environmental choices.
 Marriott Hotel: To make people who are
away from home feel they are among friends
and really wanted.
 Merck: To provide society with superior
products and services by developing inno-
vations and solutions that improve the qual-
ity of life and satisfy customer needs, and to
provide employees with meaningful work and
advancement opportunities, and investors
with a superior rate of return.
 New Jersey Section of the American Water
Works Association (NJAWWA): Dedicated
to the promotion of public health and wel-
fare in the provision of drinking water of
unquestionable quality and sufficient quan-
tity. NJAWWA must be proactive and effec-
tive in advancing the technology, science,
management, and government policies rel-
ative to the stewardship of water.
 Rotary International: To support its member
clubs in fulfilling the Object of Rotary by:
Fostering unity among member clubs;
Strengthening and expanding Rotary around
the world; Communicating worldwide the
work of Rotary; and Providing a system of
international administration.
 Small Business Technology Solutions: To
provide small businesses the functionality
of big business, within a small business
budget.
 Sony: To experience the sheer joy of advanc-
ing and applying technology for the benefit
of the public.
 Southwest Airlines: To provide the highest
quality of customer service delivered with a
sense of warmth, friendliness, individual
pride, and company spirit.
 Sun Microsystems: To solve complex net-
work computing problems for governments,
enterprises, and service providers.
 University of Phoenix: To educate working
adults to develop the knowledge and skills
that enable them to achieve their profes-
sional goals, improve the productivity of
their organizations, and provide leadership
and service to their communities.

Consider answering these questions from your customers’ perspective and
you’ll instantly see an improvement in your responses.
 What is the purpose of our business?
 What activity are we going to do to accomplish our purpose?
 What do we intend to accomplish on behalf of our customers? Or who
benefits from our work?
Follow these steps below to create your mission statement:
1. Collect ideas and opinions (either through a group meeting or an indi-
vidual survey) of your senior staff and key employees about the orga-
nization’s mission.
Ask for responses and input specifically on the three questions listed
above. If you hold a meeting, just brainstorm and allow everyone’s ideas
to be collected.
2. Collate and synthesize the responses, looking for similar themes.
Develop several different versions of a draft mission statement.
Consider using present tense language so the statement reflects what
you are and not what you aspire to become.
3. Evaluate the different drafts against the checklist in Figure 6-1.

Keep the ones that meet the guidelines in the figure and throw out the
others.
4. Circulate the draft statements and ask for feedback.
Have the staff vote on their favorite version.
5. Select the best one and make sure every employee receives a copy.
If you’re developing the mission statement as part of your strategic plan,
consider waiting to communicate the new mission statement until the
plan is finished.
The organization’s purpose and its final mission statement shouldn’t be
developed by a committee. Use the process above to solicit ideas and input,
but ultimately senior management and leaders set the strategic foundation
for an organization. It’s really not a democratic process.
Don’t get stuck on this part of your process. If need be, develop a mission
statement or a revised statement that’s dubbed as a work in progress or a
draft. Many organizations get caught up in developing the most perfect state-
ment possible. This thought process misses the reason for a mission state-
ment in the first place. While you can use your statement in your marketing
collateral or with customers (so you may want to spell- and grammar-check
it), the mission statement’s primary usage is to clearly state the purpose of
your organization to your employees and other stakeholders. Sometimes it
takes years to perfect the statement for public usage. In the meantime, you
have a team that understands why they come to work everyday.
Evaluating Your Organizational Values
Values are enduring, passionate, and distinctive core beliefs. They’re guiding
principles that never change. Values are why you do what you do and what
you stand for. Values are deeply held convictions, priorities, and underlying
assumptions that influence your attitudes and behaviors. They have intrinsic
value and importance to those inside the organization. Your core values are
part of your strategic foundation.
More and more companies are articulating the core beliefs and values under-
lying their business activities. Strong values account for why some compa-
nies gain a reputation for such strategic traits as leadership, product
innovation, dedication to superior craftsmanship, being a good company to
work for, and total customer satisfaction. A company’s values can dominate
the kind of strategic moves it considers or rejects. When values and beliefs
are deeply ingrained and widely shared by managers and employees, they
become a way of life within the company, and they mold company strategy.
They’re also called guiding principles.
105
Chapter 6: Refining Your Mission, Vision, and Values

Herb Kelleher, former CEO of Southwest Airlines, speaks about core values:
“We always felt that people should be treated right as a matter of morality.
Then, incidentally, that turned out to be good business, too. But it didn’t
really start as a strategy. It began with us thinking about what is the right
thing to do in a business context. We said we want to really take care of these
people, we want to honor them, and we love them as individuals. Now that

On the beaches of Normandy
Although World War II historians often point out
that the superior Air Forces of the Allies were
instrumental in securing Allied victory during
the D-Day invasion, many often miss the impor-
tance of the philosophical and operational dif-
ferences between the Allied and Axis forces
and commands. The German Army was the
finest fighting army on the planet. They knew an
attack was coming. They were prepared. Their
veteran troops were up against mostly green
Allied troops that had never seen combat. Why
did the Allies prevail?
One of the most overwhelming factors of Allied
victory during the Normandy invasion was that
every Allied soldier knew his mission and was
empowered to act in support of that mission, no
matter what happened. So even when troops
landed on the wrong portion of a beach, or air
dropped in the wrong landing zone, Allied
forces re-organized themselves spontaneously.
They led themselves, under the most extreme
conditions, often with no contact with higher
command or local leadership to direct their
efforts.
The German High Command was rigid, where
initiative was punished. On the other hand, the
Allied High Command was flexible, where ini-
tiative was encouraged.
The Allied Commanders pushed the mission to
the lowest possible levels within the organiza-
tion, to ensure that there was alignment and
integration of the efforts of the differing divi-
sions of personnel. From the highest ranking
officer to the lowest ranking soldier, everyone
knew the big picture and their part in it.
Conversely, the German commanders commu-
nicated through key channels and key leaders.
When things didn’t go as planned, often the
Axis troops hesitated and waited for orders
from higher command. With communications
disrupted and leaders absent or arguing with
each other about the proper response to the
invasion, the Axis powers were paralyzed. The
Allied foothold on the continent prevailed and
grew.
Obviously, the stakes aren’t as high in the busi-
ness world as they are in war time. However,
the extreme conditions of warfare often illus-
trate the best examples of successful organi-
zational philosophies and operational processes.
Modern businesses follow many practices first
perfected within the military. The entire con-
cept of an organizational mission statement has
its roots in military history. CEOs, COOs, and
company presidents often take the time to craft
an organizational mission statement, often with
the help and input of their direct reports.
However, having a mission statement and having
it understood by and mean something to the rank
and file are two separate things. How integrated
and understood is yourcompany’s mission state-
ment to the people that matter the most?

induces the kind of reciprocal trust and diligent effort that made us success-
ful. But the motivation wasn’t strategy, it was core values.”
Elements of effective organizational values
Developing core values can be tricky because you’re transferring something
that’s very personal into a group and business setting. As you’re working
toward developing a values statement for your organization, beware of the
personal and emotional connection most of your team members have with
creating the values statement.
Here are some guidelines:
 One word isn’t enough to convey the real meaning of a value. Create
phrases, but not paragraphs.
 Make these values specific, not generic. More than one word is needed
to define specificity.
 Some values-driven language may be part of your mission statement.
That’s fine, but consider not repeating what you’ve covered elsewhere.
 Values need to be shared. While you don’t need consensus from everyone
in your organization, you do need agreement from senior management.
 Keep the list of values to between five and seven. They need to be
memorable to your staff, so having a few statements is better than
having so many that nobody remembers any.
To illustrate these guidelines in action, look at Herman Miller, an innovative
furniture company.
 Rather than using the word excellence, Herman Miller chose the word
performance, and explained what that means this way: “It isn’t a choice,
it’s about everyone performing at his or her own best; we measure it; it
enriches our lives and brings value.”
 Rather than using the word teamwork, Herman Miller uses the word
inclusiveness, and describes it this way: “To succeed as a company, we
must include all the expressions of human talent and potential . . . when
we are truly inclusive, we go beyond toleration to understanding all the
qualities that make people who they are, that make us unique, and most
important, that unite us.”

Developing or updating your 
organizational values
You don’t set or establish core values. You discover them. The exercise in
this section helps you focus on discovering shared values within your organi-
zation by starting with individual’s values and moving up to the organization.
You can use this exercise to update your current values statement or develop
a new one. Focus this exercise on answering three questions:
 What are the core values and beliefs of our company?
 What values and beliefs guide our daily interactions?
 What are we really committed to?
Evaluate your values using Figure 6-2. Because your values are a key founda-
tional element to your company and strategic plan, you want to be doubly
sure they’re the right ones. 
Here are the steps to developing your organizational values statement:
1. Solicit a list of five to seven core values from each of your key staff
members and senior management team.
Identifying Authentic Core Values
Yes
If you were to start a new company, would this core value be
part of its foundation?
Do you believe that employees who do not share this value
should continue to be part of your company?
Do you demonstrate this core value in your leadership?
If you could do anything in the world, would you continue to
apply this core value to your productive activities?
Are you willing to stand by this value no matter what the
cost – for example, lost clients or lost revenue?
Will you continue to stand by and hold this value no matter
what happens in the competitive environment?
Would you sell your company before giving up this core value?
Do you apply this core value in your personal activities?
No

statement.
108
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Ask each person to provide the list of values to you individually through
a survey or e-mail by answering the questions above. Unlike with the
mission and vision exercises, values are best solicited individually
instead of in a group to begin with. Request that they explain each value
they provide.
2. Merge the lists provided by combining values that are listed more
than once.
The purpose here is to develop a draft list of values. You may have more
than five to seven at this time.
3. Bring the group together to discuss the list of values.
Ask people to comment on what is listed. Revise and modify until you
have generated a final values statement.
4. After you have your list of organizational values, use Figure 6-2 to
evaluate each value for effectiveness.
You can do this as a group or individually.
5. Put the finishing touches on the values statement and communicate
across the company.
See the next section for ideas on how to use your values statement today.
Need some ideas to get started on discovering your organizational values? See
Figure 6-3 for a bunch of words that you can use to stimulate those gray cells.
Give a copy to your values team to help them generate their individual list.
Acting on your organizational values
Developing a set of values is one thing, living by them is something com-
pletely different. Having a values statement that’s all talk and no commitment
undermines your leadership and the management team’s credibility. Here are
some ways to bring your organizational values to life:
 Communication: Send a letter to every employee; develop a brochure;
visit every office to personally explain the values; post the values in a
public area.
 Training: Develop short training sessions about the different value
topics. If that sounds like a lot of work, consider holding a brown bag
lunch focused on one of the values. Allow an open discussion about
what it means to act on and live by each value.
 Reinforcement: Engrain your values through performance reviews, in
your goal statements, and in your everyday language.
109
Chapter 6: Refining Your Mission, Vision, and Values

 Rewards/Recognition: Host contests to give employees a fun reason to
discover and integrate the values.
 Hiring: Use your values statement as a guide in your hiring process.
Structure interview questions around each one of your values to ensure
that you’re bringing people into your company who align with your cor-
porate culture.
 Alignment: Look at your values and figure out specific ways to align daily
activities with the values. For example, if one of your values is innova-
tion, then install a system to reward innovation. If customer satisfaction
is a value, then set a policy of 100 percent money back guarantee.

Visioning: Focusing in on Your North Star
Forming a strategic vision should provide long-term direction, delineate what
kind of enterprise the company is trying to become, and infuse the organiza-
tion with a sense of purposeful action. Vision serves as a unifying focal point
for everyone in the organization — like a North star. In fact, your vision state-
ment needs to be something you can achieve at some point in the future.
Visions are also referred to as big, hairy, audacious goals or BHAGs.
A vision statement can be as far reaching as 100 years or as short as five years.
Some people think if you aren’t planning for 20 years in the future, you’re being
too short-sighted. Others say that the world is changing too quickly to plan
more than a few years out. Either way, your vision statement needs to work for
your company and the industry you operate in. I recommend developing a
vision statement that’s far reaching but attainable. If you attain it in a shorter
amount of time, congratulations! But if you don’t push your thinking out far
enough, you find yourself being too tactical in your strategic planning.
Your vision should include
 A vision statement: A short, concise statement of your organization’s
future state.
 A vivid description: A long list of words and phrases that describe what
that future state is like.
Because the items in the above bulleted list go hand-in-hand, you can
develop them simultaneously.
Here are two examples of visions or BHAGs that were very lofty at the time
they were established:
 We will put a man on the moon before the end of the decade and bring
him back (President John F. Kennedy).
 A computer on every desk and in every home using great software as an
empowering tool (Microsoft).
These two statements don’t sound so crazy now, do they?
Elements of an effective vision statement
Your vision statement needs to incorporate many elements. The following list
contains elements that you can include in an effective vision statement (you
111
Chapter 6: Refining Your Mission, Vision, and Values

don’t have to use every one, but keep them in mind when you’re writing or
evaluating):
 Audacious: Represents a dream that’s beyond what you think is possi-
ble. It represents the mountaintop your company is striving to reach.
Visioning takes you out beyond your present reality.
 Capitalizes on core competencies: Builds on your company’s core com-
petencies. It builds on what you’ve already established: company his-
tory, customer base, strengths, and unique capabilities, resources, and
assets.
 Futurecasting: Provides a picture of what your business looks like in the
future.
 Inspiring: Engaging language that inspires. It creates a vivid image in
people’s heads that provokes emotion and excitement. It creates enthu-
siasm and poses a challenge.
 Motivating: Clarifies the direction in which your organization needs to
move and keeps everyone pushing forward to reach it.
 Purpose-driven: Gives employees a larger sense of purpose, so they see
themselves as building a cathedral instead of laying stones.
Imagining your future — vividly
The vivid description in your vision needs to be just that: vivid. You should
include a list of ideas, phrases, adjectives, and so forth that thoroughly
explain what it’s like to achieve the vision statement. Try to imagine your
organization when you reach your vision. Your vivid description explains
what it feels like. Your description should be vibrant and engaging and
should translate the vision from words into pictures that people can carry
around in their heads.
Here are some helpful questions to develop a vivid description of your vision:
 What does your company look like? How many employees do you have?
Where are you located? How many offices are at this location? What is
the office environment like?
 Who is on the staff? What are their skills, degrees, and areas of exper-
tise? How does everyone work together? What is the culture like?
 Who are your clients? How many customers do you have?
112
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

 What type of projects are you working on? How many products or ser-
vices are you selling?
 What is your industry, business community, or media saying about your
company? What are the headlines? What publications or TV stations are
you featured on? What awards have you won?
Updating your vision statement 
and vivid description
Updating or creating a new vision statement can be one of the most exciting
parts of strategic planning. Creating your vision statement can be achieved in
a fashion similar to that of creating your mission and values statements.
113
Chapter 6: Refining Your Mission, Vision, and Values
Examples of big, hairy, audacious 
vision statements
Because it’s always fun (and educational) to see
what other organizations are aiming for, here is
a variety of vision statements:
 BearingPoint: To be the world’s most influ-
ential and respected business advisor and
systems integrator.
 Chemtura: To be the world’s best specialty
chemicals company.
 DuPont: To be the world’s most dynamic sci-
ence company, creating sustainable solu-
tions essential to a better, safer, and
healthier life for people everywhere.
 Health Care for All: All people in our state
will have access to quality healthcare,
regardless of ability to pay.
 Heinz: To be the world’s premier food com-
pany, offering nutritious, superior tasting
foods to people everywhere.
 M3 Planning: To start a strategy revolution.
 McDonald’s: To dominate the global food-
service industry.
 Novo Nordisk: To be the world’s leading dia-
betes care company.
 Pershing General Hospital: To be the
provider of first choice for our community
and a leader in rural healthcare for Nevada.
 Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic: For
all people to have equal access to the
printed word.
 Visa: A world in which buyers and sellers
can conduct commerce anywhere, any-
time, and in any way they choose.

Follow these steps to create your vision:
1. Gather your senior staff and key employees together for a one- to two-
hour meeting.
Visioning is best done in a group setting. If your group is bigger than five
people, break up into small groups of three to five to allow everyone to
have a voice in the process.
2. Generate a list of ideas and phrases based on the responses to these
three questions:
• What will our organization look like five to ten years from now?
• What does success look like?
• What are we aspiring to achieve?
Allow the group to brainstorm, even if some of the ideas are totally wacky.
3. Ask the group to pair up ideas that have similar themes.
Identify the ideas that most closely resemble the vision for the organization.
4. Ask one or two people to develop a draft vision statement based on
the condensed list of ideas.
The vision statement should be short and use verbs phrases that are
forward-looking such as to be.
5. Ask another one or two people to generate the vivid description based
on all of the themes identified.
When developing the vivid description, use the future tense, such as
“We will . . .”
6. Bring the vision statement and vivid description back to the group.
Revise until you have something everyone agrees on.
7. Evaluate the vision statement against the mission and values statements.
Make sure they all connect.
Envisioning your personal future
Because your personal life and your business life are intertwined, you should
have a BHAG that runs in tandem with your corporate vision statement. This
statement is called the Owner’s Vision Statement and isn’t necessarily shared
with your employees but is developed specifically to develop a single focus
point for all equity shareholders.
114
Part II: Looking Backward to Move Forward 

Many small businesses don’t have owner’s visions because their founders
haven’t looked at life outside of business ownership. An owner’s vision, even
though it may seem far out, is imperative for anyone who’s founded or pur-
chased a business.
An owner’s vision answers the question “What is my endgame?” In other
words, where do you see yourself in the business three, five, or ten years
from now? If you’re looking to sell the business, turn to Chapter 17 for the
discussion about business valuation and exit strategies.
Take out a note page and label it Owner’s Vision Statement. List your ideas
about your end game. Consider when you plan on exiting, how to exit, how
much return you want to see and so on. Add a note to revise this list after
reading Chapter 17 on exit strategies.
Finalizing Your Strategic Foundation
All the elements of your strategic foundation — competitive advantage, mis-
sion, values, vision, and vivid description — should work together. Remember
these are the elements of your organization that don’t change, or at least they
don’t change significantly. Your strategies, goals, objectives, and actions
change based on market conditions, but they’re always built on your strate-
gic foundation.
Bring all of these elements together in a strategic foundation sheet like the
examples shown in Figure 6-4 and Figure 6-5. This sheet is an excellent docu-
ment to include in a new employee packet, post in the break room, hand out
to every employee, and use in strategy meetings. It’s exciting! It gives every-
one a bigger sense of purpose and an understanding of what your organiza-
tion is all about.

Sizing Up Your
Current Situation

In this part . . . 
S
trategic planning is as much about planning and exe-
cution as it is about decision making. Good decision
making comes from collecting the right data on which to
base your decisions. In this part, you figure out what inter-
nal and external information to collect and analyze to
assess your business and its capabilities. You also take a
peek at your company through the eyes of your customers.

Chapter 7
Assessing Your Business 
and Its Capabilities
In This Chapter
 Summarizing your strengths and weaknesses
 Evaluating how to hire, develop, and retain your best and brightest employees
 Checking out your capabilities and resources and linking them together
 Assessing your profit margins
I
magine you’re setting out on a road trip. You hop on MapQuest or open up
the AAA roadmap to select the quickest route from your home to your des-
tination. With your trip plan in mind, you consult your friend because he trav-
eled that road before. After you’re feeling good about your route, you check
your resources against your trip plan to make sure that you have enough time
and gas to get there. Then, you assess your VW bus to ensure that it’s in work-
ing condition and that your CD carrier (or iPod) is full of great music. You
pack your bags and invite two friends because they’re fun to have around.
Sound familiar? This situation may sound too methodical, but more than
likely, you went through all those steps before you headed out on the road
(even if you were driving a beater bus!). Mapping a strategic plan is just the
same: Your company needs a roadmap or plan to make the strategic plan
work. This chapter focuses on your bus. More specifically, this chapter takes
a look at the following points:
 How does being on your bus feel? How it feels on the “bus” is your
company culture — teamwork, leadership, climate for action.
 Are the right people on your bus and in the right seats? Are you keep-
ing them there? The bus passengers are your employees who represent
their skills and capabilities, too.

 What type of bus are you driving? The type of “bus” you drive indicates
your operations — lean and mean or clunky and slow.
 Does your bus run with the right amount so there is something left-
over for your shareholders? This is your profit margin, which indicates
how well you used your resources to get to where you wanted to go.
Using the road trip analogy helps explain the unexplainable in strategic plan-
ning. Understanding how your company’s resources, capabilities, and processes
are used to grow the organization is critical to successfully executing your
strategy and growing your company. Often, pinpointing all the things that
need to come together to move a company forward is difficult.
This chapter focuses on assessing your company’s strengths and weaknesses
that define where you stand today. Later, you use this information to guide
the goals and objectives in your strategic plan.
Identifying Your Strengths 
and Weaknesses
To move from where you are today to where you want to go, you have to
determine your strategic position, where you stand today. It’s kind of like
taking your bus into a mechanic for the annual tune-up. You get an assess-
ment of what’s working, what’s not, the things you need to fix, and the things
that can wait.
In this chapter and Chapters 8 and 9, you perform an annual tune-up of your
business with the help of a trusted business planning tool: the SWOT. SWOT
stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. The four
quadrants in Figure 7-1 help you focus on the key factors that define your
strategic position.
Your focus in this chapter is on your company’s strengths and weaknesses;
Chapter 8 looks at your strengths and weakness too, but through the eyes of
your customers. In Chapter 9, you focus on identifying your opportunities
and threats. You see the SWOT again in Chapter 12 when you develop your
company’s goals and objectives based on this information.
By breaking down your internal environment into capabilities, resources, and
processes, you have a place to start assessing your company. Without these
categories, the task can seem a little daunting. This format ensures that you’re
looking at your strengths and weaknesses holistically, instead of approaching
them haphazardly. (To complete the full SWOT analysis, turn to Chapter 9.)
122
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

Your organization’s strengths encompass everything your company does well,
including capabilities, skills, and resources you can leverage and draw on to
execute plans and actions in your company. Weaknesses, conversely, encom-
pass everything that’s holding your company back from achieving your goals
or serving your customers. Check out the questionnaires in Figure 7-2 and
Figure 7-3 for a quick survey of your company’s strengths and weaknesses.
Now it’s time to dig a little deeper to get more specific about each area. Each
section of this chapter is likely to give you insights and ideas about your
strengths and weaknesses. To capture all your thoughts and keep them in
order, draw a horizontal line across the middle of a sheet of notebook paper.
Label the top section Strengths and the bottom section Weaknesses. For
instance, jot down thoughts about your effective customer relationship
processes under Strengths and problems with employee retention under
Weaknesses.
As you answer the questionnaires and track your ideas throughout this chap-
ter, you have a good starting point to summarize and add to your key
strengths and weaknesses. (Remember, these ideas can become the basis for
goals in your strategic plan.) You can then translate those thoughts into a
grid like Figure 7-1. After you read through this chapter, you should have
enough thoughts to fill in the two left-side quadrants on the grid. Consider

Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

this a running list of thoughts about your strategic position as you move
through the rest of Part III. You complete your full SWOT at the end of
Chapter 9.
Assessing Your Capabilities
The first phase of identifying your strengths and weaknesses is looking at
your capabilities or intangible assets (intangible means incapable of being
realized or defined). These assets point to why organizations are good or not
good at identifying and leveraging people, culture, and knowledge.
By breaking down your capabilities into certain areas, you can start to define
your strengths and weaknesses. After they’re defined, align them with the
strategic direction you want to go. You need people with the skills and knowl-
edge who are motivated and resourceful to make your strategic plan a reality.
Otherwise, you just have a bunch of good ideas on a piece of paper.
Human capital: Having the right 
people in the right seats
How many times have you heard “Our employees are our most important
asset”? And how often do you feel like your company (or any company for
that matter) backs up that statement? The time has come where big and

124
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

small businesses alike no longer pay lip service to this statement. The trend
is to spend more time and money on recruiting absolutely the best people.
No matter how busy you are, it’s always better to hire no one than to hire the
wrong person.
After you have the right people on your bus, making sure that they’re in the
right seats means they have the skills and abilities to do their jobs. Just
hiring them without training and development is like buying a house and
doing nothing to maintain or improve it. You’re letting your asset go to waste.
After you get the right people in the right seats, you want to keep them there.
Nothing is more harmful and costly than losing good people. Harmful because
knowledge walks out the door, and costly because you have to train someone
else. So, hiring the best people is good, but hiring the best people and making
sure that they’re developed with the right skills and abilities is better.
In the following list, evaluate how well you do these management tasks:
 Hiring: Only you can answer whether your current hiring process yields
good results. Every company has its own unique approach to evaluating
potential employees — personality tests, rounds of interviews, special
questions. No one way is superior to another. What really matters is get-
ting the right people on board. But a great way to see quick results in your
company, if you’re having employee problems, is to hire slow and fire fast.
 Developing: How effective is your training and development program?
Do your employees have the best tools and work environment to do
their jobs? You may have a formalized program, but, again, what really
matters is that your employees are doing their best work and achieving
their fullest potential. If employees really are your most important asset,
you need to develop them to realize the full value of your investment.
Training and development needs to be linked directly to improvement at
work. Make sure that you’re training for the capabilities that your organi-
zation needs to move forward. I’m constantly amazed at how many train-
ing programs aren’t linked to the overall strategy. For example, if you
want to improve your productivity, send your employees to a time man-
agement workshop instead of a teambuilding ropes course.
 Retaining: The words employee retention hit most business owners in
the gut. Managing people can be a hard concept for some people, and
retention seems to be the perceived outcome of poor management
(which isn’t necessarily the case because employees leave for numerous
reasons unrelated to their jobs). Nevertheless, do you know the number
one reason people leave their jobs? Not feeling appreciated by their
boss. Employees need to feel appreciated, challenged, and fairly
rewarded to stick around.
125
Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

How is your retention rate? Because you have invested a significant
amount of time and money into your employees, retaining them
becomes imperative. Otherwise, you let your most valued asset walk 
out the door.
Obviously the outcome of not performing these management tasks well is a
high turnover rate. However, you don’t want to wait until people leave to
make improvements. You can evaluate these three areas through employee
surveys, exit interviews, bringing in an HR consultant, and also by monitoring
overall employee satisfaction.
GoDaddy.com, the number one Internet domain registrar in the world, is
known for putting its money where it really matters. No $5,000 office chairs
or $10,000 conference tables. Founder Bob Parsons invests in the two assets
that contribute to profitability: people and technology. Although he focuses
on keeping costs down, Parsons doesn’t scrimp on employee incentives. He
gives away televisions, trips, motorcycles, a car, and even a year’s rent or
mortgage. Why? Because as his call centers grow, he wants them to be a fun
place to work. When his people are having fun, his customers are happy
because they get to talk to happy employees. When his customers are happy,
production and sales go up.
Organizational capital: Getting a 
feeling for your corporate culture
The second phase in the assessment of your company capabilities is review-
ing its organizational capital. Now that you have people on your bus and in
the right seats, answer the following questions:
 How does it feel to be on your bus? (How is your work environment?)
 Do you and your employees like coming to work?
 Is everyone getting along?
 Is someone driving the bus? (Who’s running the show?)
 What is your organizational culture like?
Organizations are made up of people, and the people determine what goes on
at work. At the end of the day, every person is responsible for how the work
gets done and how the organization functions.
126
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

Structure, teamwork, management, and leadership dictate how it feels to be
working in your business environment. Evaluate your organizational capital
by looking at the following areas:
 Structure: Structure does serve a purpose — to have an efficient flow 
of information for action and decision making. Normally, organizational
charts look like a bunch of departments cobbled together because busi-
nesses grow and morph over time. Is your organization structured to
allow everyone to operate effectively?
 Leadership: Leadership is the art of getting people to do what you want
because they want to. Leadership comes in many styles and flavors, but
the end result is the same. Leaders are responsible for setting the vision
and the strategy. How is your leadership?
 Management: Managers are responsible for making sure that the work
gets done and that employees are performing at their peak level. In your
company, the lines between leaders and managers may be blurred. Your
leaders may be managers and your managers may be leaders. Either
way, both are just as important in keeping your bus moving down the
road. Is your management team successfully getting the work done and
helping your employees achieve their fullest potential?
 Teamwork: How do you build a great team? Numerous theories exist
that can easily fill the rest of this book. But nothing gets done in busi-
ness, except maybe answering the phone, without teamwork. For your
evaluation, ask yourself if the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
Are your people achieving more together than apart?
Each of these areas has industries built around it. If you are looking to dig
into improving one or more of them, look to an outside consulting firm or
training course that focuses on the discipline specifically.
Patagonia — an environmentally-conscious, highly innovative outdoor cloth-
ing company — is notorious for its enviable culture. Under founder Yvon
Chouinard’s leadership, the company has reached $240 million in annual
sales. The business continues to maintain a complete and total commitment
to environmentalism as well as blending work and play. At times, profitability
takes a lower priority than upholding the corporate values The corporate cul-
ture emanates from the top through Chouinard’s philosophy and leadership
style. His thoughts are consistently supported by managers, teams, employee
internship programs, and the company’s lack of cubicles. Surfing at lunch-
time or taking major customers skiing is part of Patagonia’s business and 
its culture.

Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

Knowledge capital: Knowing 
what you already know
The third phase in the assessment of your company capabilities is reviewing
its knowledge capital. The institutional or tribal knowledge, as I like to call it,
is one of those management fads that come and go. But regardless of what
may be hip in the business traditions of today, creating and maintaining an
efficient knowledge management system to share information companywide
seems like common sense.
Most companies don’t maintain and retain knowledge very well because, by
some estimates, up to 70 percent of what employees do is nothing more than
reinventing what their organization had discovered previously. And why do
you want your people wasting time figuring out what someone else in the
company has already discovered? Information is an intangible asset that can
be a significant competitive advantage if you can harness it.
At its simplest form, managing your tribal knowledge is figuring out a way to
capture everything your organization knows and then creating an easy way
for everyone in the company to access and share that knowledge. Here’s an
easy process to make improvements in the area of knowledge capital:
1. Identify what information is actually knowledge.
Information is a lot of data put into context. Knowledge is information
that has been processed and identified as continually useful to the orga-
nization. Knowledge must contribute to your competitive advantage.
Identify what are the key areas of knowledge that make your company
run. Think about your core processes, customer service, vendor rela-
tionships, client relationships and so on. Think about what would
happen if your key employees left. What knowledge do they have that
you need to capture?
2. Capture the knowledge.
You want to translate the knowledge from your employee to a place
where the information can be stored and “backed up.” Capturing knowl-
edge can be achieved through exit interviews, standardizing processes,
successfully using customer relationships management (CRM) systems
with complete customer profiles, job shadowing, and so on. By capturing
the knowledge, you’re formally bringing what’s in someone’s head into
your business — permanently.
3. Share your findings.
I know, I know, there is too much information in this world already. I
agree! Everyone is on information overload. But your tribal knowledge is
128
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

the type of information that should make everyone’s job easier. Figure
out ways to share the knowledge in five-minute debriefings at your staff
meeting, a company blog, or a training manual for new hires.
4. Use the knowledge.
Now that you have leverage, make sure that you use it. Put the knowl-
edge into practice by cross training current employees, educating new
employees if it is within their functional area, and add to the knowledge
base continually. If you’ve done the other three steps correctly, you
should see an improvement in overall productivity.
Identify one or two ways to tackle knowledge management this year. Develop
a one-year and a three-year goal for your strategic plan. Knowledge disap-
pearance has been a problem throughout time, and what makes the situation
more severe today is that the knowledge that’s being lost is more complex,
abstract, and difficult to create than ever before. More than likely, knowledge
management is an area that can use some improvement in your company.
You want to protect the information that your company thrives on.
But don’t just listen to me. Listen to one of the most successful entrepre-
neurs: Bill Gates. “The most meaningful way to differentiate your company
from your competition, the best way to put distance between yourself and
the crowd, is to do an outstanding job with information. How you gather,
manage, and use information determines whether you win or lose.”
Examining Your Resources
After your capabilities are sufficiently understood, the next step in the SWOT
process is looking at your resources. (Refer to Figure 7-1 if needed.) Resources
are defined as any physical or quantifiable asset that your organization uses
to bring revenue into your business. These assets are defined as tangible.
Some assets, such as your brand, are intangible but still have a quantifiable
value to your company, just like your long-standing customer relationships.
From a strategic perspective, you need to look at what tangible assets you
have versus what you need to achieve your strategic plan. You may need to
come back to this section after you’ve developed more of your plan. But
taking stock of where you are now can be helpful in your planning process.
Specifically, you need to look at
 What tangible assets you have in your company right now that allow you
to produce your product or service
 What tangible assets you need to continue to provide and exceed your
current service levels
129
Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

Create a page entitled Resources. List the assets you have (strengths), the
assets you need (weaknesses), and the assets you desire. Consider coming
back to this page when you’re further along in your plan development.
To help identify your business resources, group them under the following 
categories:
 Financial resources: These resources include all the items available to
finance or pay for your strategic decisions. Existing resources include
cash balances, lines of credit, other loans, owner’s equity, and credit
agreements with your vendors. 
 Physical resources: Your physical resources include everything you
have and use to deliver your products and services. These resources
also include
• Production facilities, which may include buildings, plants, machinery,
capacity, investment and maintenance, quality, and organization of
your production processes.
• Information technology (IT), which includes systems, computers,
and critical software in use in the organization and also encom-
passes integration with customers and suppliers.
 Intangible resources: Your intangible resources are everything that you
can’t touch or feel but that you know has value to your business. These
sources include
• Goodwill: The difference between the value of your tangible assets
and the actual market value of your business.
• Reputation: Your standing in your community and your industry.
• Brands: Your standing and awareness in the marketplace.
• Intellectual property: When you’re managing your knowledge, you
actually turn a capability into a resource. This also includes
patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
Process: Connecting Your Capabilities
and Resources
The next step in the SWOT analysis is looking at the processes (see Figure 7-1).
Are you cruising down the road smoothly, or is your bus coughing and 
sputtering along, barely making it to the next service station? More than
likely, your company is somewhere between these two extremes. And you
130
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

probably go back and forth between states of high and low performance. It’s
time to open up the hood of your bus and find out what’s going on in there. 
In this section, you’re looking at the processes that connect your intangible
assets to your tangible assets to produce an outcome, which is a current
product or service, a new product, customer service, or development and
maintenance of relationships with partners and governmental agencies.
When evaluating your internal processes, they need to pass the efficiency/
effectiveness test.
 Efficiency is doing things right. Are your processes producing the end
result you desire?
 Effectiveness is doing right things. Are you involved in the processes
you should be involved in? If not, this is a potential area for outsourcing.
By reviewing your internal processes, you find some that are operating at full
efficiency and others that are barely hanging on. Do you have some processes
that continually have problems? Are there others that are working just per-
fectly? Just like with intangible assets, your processes break down into gen-
eral business areas. Complete the questionnaire in Figure 7-3 to grasp a
better understanding of operational, customer, relationship, and innovation
processes. These processes are also described further in the sections below.

Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

Operational processes
Operations produce and deliver the goods and services to customers. These
processes encompass managing your creation of customer value.
Service companies may be tempted to think that processes aren’t managed in
this area, but consider how your service is delivered. It doesn’t happen by
magic. You take specific steps to deliver what you do: These are your opera-
tional processes. Because strategic planning is about improving the status
quo, looking at how to improve operations is the key.
Operations management covers four typical processes:
 Developing and sustaining supplier or vendor relationships: Bringing
raw material and goods into your company is a set of processes that
feed into how you produce products and services. Do you effectively
manage your supplier relationships to ensure that you obtain the total
lowest cost of the products and services you buy? Are you efficiently
sourcing, moving, storing, and inspecting the raw materials you use?
 Producing products and services: At the heart of your operational
processes is the production of your product and service. Are you effi-
cient at production, thereby lowering production costs and increasing
your asset utilization? Are you effectively producing your product with
minimal scrap, error rates, or returns?
 Delivering the product or service to your customer: Just like with man-
aging your suppliers, you also have processes that manage your distrib-
ution. Are you efficiently delivering your products or services to your
customers? Are you effective at reaching your customers through your
distribution channels?
 Managing operating risk: Not all companies have direct operating risk,
but most all are exposed to some kind of risk associated with market
fluctuations. Processes in this area deal with effectively and efficiently
reducing costs associated with capital costs and taxes.
Erlach Computer Consulting, a small technology service company, improved
the one key operational process that nearly doubled the company’s revenue in
one year. The process? Time tracking. Yes, the process may sound simple, but
for Erlach, time is the company’s inventory, product, and distribution medium.
Starting from the top, management required every employee to track his or her
time down to the 15 minute increment. The company was doing this previously,
but not with 100 percent compliance. Now that the time is captured, Erlach can
account and bill for previously unbilled time. Not only were the employees
more conscious of their work day, but clients were also correctly charged for
the services they received.
132
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

Customer management processes
Customer management processes cut across all your customers — current
and new. In evaluating your performance, written or unwritten, your organiza-
tion goes through the following processes when acquiring and serving your
customers:
 Selecting customers: Are you identifying the right customers whose prob-
lems you can solve? (Chapter 11 helps you to identify your key customers.)
 Acquiring customers: A quick way to evaluate this process is to look at
your customer conversion rate. How many prospects are you turning
into customers? How effective is your marketing strategy? Is your mes-
sage the right one, and does it hit the right people at the right time?
 Retaining customers: Assuming that you’ve landed the right customers
and are able to deliver what you promised, your customers should be
sticking with you. While you are acquiring new customers, you still want
to take care of the old ones. Word of mouth is also important here. When
your customers are highly satisfied, they tell their friends.
 Building relationships with your customers: Are you growing your rela-
tionships with your customers or are they stagnant? You can measure
this success by seeing if your customers are buying more from you year
after year.
Scandinavian Airlines realizes the importance of managing its customers’
relationships by breaking down customer relationship management processes
to their most basic, uncomplicated level. Jan Carlzon, CEO, says “Last year,
each of our 10 million customers came in contact with approximately five SAS
employees, and this contact lasted an average of 15 seconds each time. Those
50 million ‘moments of truth’ are the moments that ultimately determine
whether SAS succeeds or fails as a company.”
Relationship management processes
Organizations don’t operate in an isolated pool with just their employees and
their customers. Instead, every company and department has relationships
with the communities they operate in, governmental agencies, and partners
such as other companies, industry associations, and maybe even competi-
tors. Your company may need to manage relationships with all or a few of
these entities because everyone is a piece of the bigger picture.
133
Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

These relationships breakdown into the following areas and processes:
 Environmental stewardship: If your company impacts the environment,
how effective are you at managing your resource consumption, water
and air emissions, waste disposal, and overall environmental impact?
 Employee well-being and compliance: How is your employee health
and safety performance? Are you efficiently taking care of your employ-
ees to minimize any safety accidents or repetitive stress injuries?
 Community contributions: Are you investing in your community through
nonprofit organizations or other community programs? Small organiza-
tions tend to take a hit-or-miss approach to this, meaning that they don’t
consistently contribute to an ongoing charity. Consider the time and
energy savings with a consistent community outreach program.
 Alliance management: Are you efficiently taking care of the organiza-
tions you work with? Do you have a consistent approach to managing
these critical relationships? Are you effective with your alliance? In
other words, are you working with the right ones?
Maximizing profits is just part of running a big business, according to John
Mackey, CEO and cofounder of Whole Foods — the nation’s leading natural
and organic grocery chain with $4.7 billion in annual sales. He feels there is a
larger trend toward businesses having a greater responsibility in society.
Employees, customers, and shareholders all want their businesses to be
good corporate citizens. Mackey believes that profits and being a good citi-
zen go hand-in-hand. He puts his money where his mouth is, with 5 percent of
annual net profits going toward charitable causes as well as numerous com-
munity programs.
Innovation processes
The fourth part of reviewing your processes involves taking a look at your
creativity. If you’re not innovating, you’re dead. (At least that seems to be the
general consensus of the business community, but I have yet to see anyone
keel over!) Without innovation, anyone can imitate what you’re offering after
a period of time. Also, business gets pretty boring if you have the same old
stuff. Busting out of the old mold keeps things exciting and employees
engaged. Here are the four procedures necessary to make innovation part of
your business:
 Identify market opportunities for new products or services. How 
effective are you at anticipating customer needs and uncovering new
opportunities?
134
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

 Manage the ideas in your innovation pipeline. Are you effectively
choosing the right products and services to potentially move into full
development?
 Design and develop the new products and services that are worthy
and that leverage your capabilities. Are you efficiently moving products
and services through the development stages by reducing time and
costs? Or do new products languish until they become stale?
 Bring the new products and services to market. Are you efficiently get-
ting your new product or service in front of your current customers?
Do they know about all the offerings you have?
How do you know if you’re efficient and effective at innovating in general? Your
new products and services sell. That’s the metric for all the above processes.
“Pound for pound, the most innovate company in America is W.L. Gore &
Associates,” according to Fast Company, a well-respected monthly business
publication. W.L. Gore is known for its premier brand Gore-Tex, as well as
other innovative solutions for the electronics, medical, and fabric industries.
How do they do it? They operate on five key philosophies that dictate how
the company is run:
 Small teams: With small groups, the company is able to respond and
innovate quickly.
 No rank: Instead of a rigid chain of command, which can delay decision
making, the company eliminated rank. All employees are equal.
 Everyone can lead: Without rank, it gives every employee the opportu-
nity to be a leader.
 Take the long view. Great innovations can sometimes take years, not
months. By recognizing this, the company does not demand results for
quarterly shareholder reports.
 Celebrate failure: Success requires failure. By celebrating failure, the
company encourages employees to test every new idea because you
never know which one might be a runaway success.
Other process areas
Other process areas are important and support the previously discussed
processes. They neither stand on their own, nor do they exist without a
process that tangibly produces results. However, highlighting the following
three supporting areas make every organization run a whole lot smoother.
Please quickly review Figure 7-1 for perspective on these items.
135
Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

Technology
Technology in and of itself isn’t a strategy. Virtually everyone has access to
the same technology, so technology can’t give you a competitive advantage.
What you do with your technology is a different story. Figure out if it makes
you faster or slower. Technology should be a tool to make every other
process in your company run smoothly and more efficiently (if selected and
implemented correctly). To evaluate your IT, here are two quick questions:
 Do your IT systems improve the overall operational efficiency of your
organization?
 Does the technology platform let employees take the best care of your
customers?
Not to oversimplify systems and decisions, which can be very complicated,
but instead of getting caught up in the details, these questions help you look
at the big picture. What is the strategic decision you need to make in order to
improve either your top or your bottom line? IT should be regarded as any
other expense instead of a cost center. Is your IT yielding a return-on-investment
(ROI)?
Communication
Another big topic that plagues every organization (and every relationship) is
communication. If you could get this right, you could retire tomorrow. That’s
unlikely to happen, though, so the success of your strategic plan rests on
your ability to communicate the plan to your employees. While you’re assess-
ing your internal operations, assessing your communication methodology is
an important area to review, too. As with the other areas in this section, good
communication supports your core processes.
Some of the best corporate leaders in the world can tell you that you can’t
over-communicate. No one ever complains about being too informed. As with
your strategic plan and any other critical initiative in your organization,
 Make sure that your employees hear and understand your message com-
pletely. Having three key points works the best.
 Communicate the key message points again.
 Repeat the message over and over again in different settings so every-
one knows and is completely clear on your points.
Productivity
Improve productivity happens when you work smarter with the resources that
you have or get the same results in less time. Being busy isn’t necessarily being
136
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

productive. Aren’t you all busy? Who’s not? And you may feel productive, but
you’re only productive if you’re producing results that move the company for-
ward. High-value activities — those that are directly related to getting and ser-
vicing your business — are the ones that contribute to bottom-line results.
Here are some examples of high-value activities:
 Making sales calls
 Writing proposals
 Producing your product or service
 Serving your customers
 Managing your employees who deliver your products and services
 Communicating with your clients
Think about how much time you deal with e-mails that have nothing to do
with customer communication. Like spam. According to Nucleus Research,
the average employee receives 13.3 spam messages each day. Spam costs
U.S. corporations on average $845 per employee per year. Multiple that by
the number of people in your company who have desk jobs. Ouch!
E-mail is a low-value activity. What a great way to waste time feeling produc-
tive. If you spend a total of two hours out of an eight-hour workday on e-mail,
that’s 25 percent of your time. Unless that 25 percent of your time is produc-
ing at least 25 percent of your total income, it’s a low-value activity. Now
granted, e-mail can be a time-saver. But it’s only a high-value activity when
you’re communicating with your customers.
Chris is a sole proprietor who owns Amplitude, an organizational assessment
and employee training company. In a day where she isn’t doing a full training
session, she may write a proposal, go to lunch with a contact from a network-
ing event, make some prospect calls, pay her bills, and organize her files. All
these activities are important, yet only writing the proposal and making
prospect calls directly brings in business. Chris’ productivity improvement
comes in making more prospecting calls and spending less time paying bills.
In fact, she recently hired an assistant with the extra money she makes from
one additional sale.
Checking Your Profit Margins
Are you ready to make more money in your business? Who isn’t? Even if
you’re running a nonprofit or government agency, you’re always looking at
improving your profit margins. Your margins tell you how much is left over
137
Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

after you’ve paid your direct expenses. It is how much gas is left in the tank
when you arrive at your destination. So what’s the secret to making more
money? Stop doing things that lose money. Now, before you roll your eyes,
don’t overlook the simplicity of this statement.
Here’s a classic example of losing money: A mid-sized business-to-business
software company realized that every dollar of revenue generated from its
marketing campaigns cost the business about $1.20. Result: The marketing
campaign is costing more than it’s worth ($1.00–$1.20). Attributing marketing
dollars directly to the sales generated can be a rude awakening.
Ready for some ideas on how to improve your margins? As you read through
this list of ideas to follow, keep adding to your list of strengths and weak-
nesses on that notebook page.
Identifying cash creators
Here are some quick cash creators that yield lasting results in a short time:
 Do an expense shakedown. Take time at least once a year to scrutinize
each and every company expense. Remember that old habits die hard.
Evaluate your travel expenses, telecommunication expenses, insurance
costs, subscriptions, and so on. If the expense doesn’t contribute to
your company’s profitability, eliminate it. You’re just about guaranteed
to find areas in which costs can be reduced or cut out entirely.
 Clip coupons. Okay, not exactly coupons, but find good deals on busi-
ness services. Everyone from Costco to Microsoft is catering to the
small- to mid-sized business market. Make those companies win your
business by comparison shopping. This idea is great when you’re talking
telephone or cellular phone plans, suppliers, or even interest rates on
company credit cards.
 Increase your prices. Not everyone can do this. But if you can back up
your price increase by better products, service, and quality, you’re likely
to keep all your customers. Most people are accustomed to the idea of
getting what they pay for. (I have heard the advice of increasing your
prices 10 percent per month until you lose 10 percent of your business.
Then stop. You might try it again when you improve your products and
services. The concept is interesting and it may have some value for your
business.)
 Be clear about your payment terms. From the get-go, institute a consis-
tent and firm payment process. Most customers appreciate your profes-
sional approach if the way you do business is clear.
138
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

You may consider letting your clients make payments over time, but the
costs of having customers who pay late is significant, not only on the
cash side but also on time spent on collections.
 Ask for more business. Do your current and past clients know about all
the services you offer? Not only should you educate your customers
annually about what you offer, but also ask for more business. Chances
are, you’ll get it. In Chapter 8, you discover more on this subject.
Detecting cash drains
Check out the following ways to detect cash drains and improve your margins:
 Fire “loser” customers. Remember that you’re in business to make
money. Customers that are costing you money need to be evaluated. The
reality is that some customers aren’t worth having, even though you
spent time and money getting them. Examples of these type of cus-
tomers include
• Those who take up too much of your time compared with the prof-
its they generate
• Those who consistently fail to pay on time
• Those who always want more but don’t want to pay more
 Market wisely. No matter what, marketing can be expensive. Whether
you’re spending money on a TV campaign or paying your employee’s
salary while she attends a networking event, you need to make sure that
your marketing dollars are well spent. With marketing dollars, you need
a tangible ROI. If your marketing strategy can’t justify the cost, replace
the plan with something better or stop what you’re doing and save the
money until you can figure out a better solution.
 Break even. Another common cash drain for service firms is inadver-
tently charging a lower billable rate than your hourly breakeven rate.
The breakeven rate is the cost per hour to keep your doors open. If
you’re selling your time, which is your inventory, for less than your cost
of overhead, you have a negative profit margin.
 Keep a “Because we’ve always done it that way” list. Do you ever wonder
why you do something a certain way? If the answer is, “Because we’ve
always done it that way,” you may have found a time-and-money-waster
in your business. If you find yourself saying “Because we’ve always
done it that way,” about a process, put the process on the list to be 
evaluated.
139
Chapter 7: Assessing Your Business and Its Capabilities

One of the biggest culprits is producing reports. Check to make sure that
the reports you produce are actually being used. Look for other areas
where changes can be made or that can be completely eliminated in
order to save money.

Seeing Your Business Through
Your Customers’ Eyes
In This Chapter
 Determining your most valuable customers and why they’re your customers
 Selecting customer-focus measurements for your strategic plan
 Evaluating the key activities that provide value to your customers
 Pinpointing specific goals to kick your value up a notch
T
he best thing about your business are your customers. You have a group
of people who like what you sell, find your product or service valuable,
and give you money in exchange for a bundle of benefits. Seeing your busi-
ness through your customers’ eyes is one of the best ways to uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of your organization.
When you neglect your customers, you tend to assume that you know them,
what they want, and that they’ll continue to buy from you. Businesspeople
come up various reasons to neglect their customers (intentionally or not):
 It takes too much time.
 It’s too expensive to do customer research.
 You’re scared to hear what your customers really think.
 You don’t have time to implement customer recommendations.
 Your sales are up, so customers must be happy.
In this chapter, you discover some easy ways to get past these excuses to
uncover your current customers’ needs and wants as well as creating cus-
tomers for a lifetime. Odds are you could be conducting more business with
your existing customers by looking at your operations through their perspec-
tives. Armed with this information, you can make strategic decisions that
raise your worth in the eyes of those customers who’re most valuable.

Getting to Know Your Most 
Valuable Customers
Not everything in this world is created equal, and neither are your cus-
tomers. Most companies lose about 25 percent of their customers every year
for a variety of reasons. What is important, is to recognize that you’ll lose
customers, yet it’s common business knowledge that it’s substantially cheaper
to maintain existing clients instead of acquiring new ones. With this in mind,
organizations get trapped in a continuous cycle of trying to fill a leaky cus-
tomer bucket.
There are two reasons for leaks:
 Businesses spend a disproportionate amount of money trying to keep all
of their customers happy.
 Businesses try to hold on to every customer, which isn’t statistically
possible, while constantly seeking new customers and neglecting their
best customers.
How can you can stop your customer bucket from leaking? The key is to
focus your time and money on the 75 percent of the customers who’re likely
to stay with you.
Do you need more convincing to keep your current customers happy? Check
out these statistics from The Center for Customer Focus that just may per-
suade you:
 For every one complaint there are 26 silent or dissatisfied customers.
 Your buyers aren’t complaining; they’re just not buying from you.
 Sixty-three percent of silent customers will switch suppliers.
 Unsatisfied customers will express their dissatisfaction to at least nine
other people.
 Roughly 65 percent of customers are dissatisfied because of the feeling
of indifference (everything from a bad attitude to not returning an e-mail)
by someone at the company.
 Your loyal customers will tell three other people about how great you are.
If you take the previous list of statistics into account, you just eliminated
25 percent of your most valued customers. Only 75 percent remain, which
142
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

could be thousands of customers, depending on the size of your organization.
The process of building relationships with all of your constituents and seeing
your business from their perspective can be daunting. But don’t worry, you
can make one more cut before you identify your most valued customers.
The 80/20 customer
Many businesspeople have heard about the 80/20 rule, which states that about
80 percent of company sales come from about 20 percent of its customers. Also
known as the Pareto principle, this rule was named after the Italian economist
Vilfredo Pareto who observed in 1906 that 20 percent of the Italian population
owned 80 percent of Italy’s wealth. Looking further, he noticed that 20 percent
of the pea pods in his garden accounted for 80 percent of his pea crop each
year. You can chalk this up to coincidence or sheer luck, but either way, Pareto
applied this rule to pretty much everything in his life.
Of course it can be argued that the 80/20 rule is totally hypothetical, but
when it comes to business, this simple hypothesis can help you identify who
your most profitable customers are.
Here’s how to find your 80/20 customer:
1. Determine your total sales for last year or last quarter.
2. Run a report of total sales by each customer or account.
3. Identify the individual customers that account for the biggest percent-
age of your sales by dividing the total customer purchase into total
sales for the period.
These remaining customers are your best few. They’re the ones that trust
you, enjoy your products and services, and are most likely to buy from you
again and again. According the Howard Hyden, founder of The Center for
Customer Focus, your existing customer base is five times more likely to buy
from you than go to an unknown company. Did you know that these 20 per-
cent who’ve purchased from you once will buy from you again? What’s the
catch? You have to ask them! One-fifth of your customer base is just waiting
for you to follow-up with them and offer them something new. Talk about
leaving money on the table!
These customers aren’t only the key to your growth, but also the “lifetime
value” of your business.
143
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

Determining the lifetime 
value of your customer
Just how valuable are your customers? A calculation called “The Lifetime
Value of a Customer” translates value into hard dollars. The outcome of this
calculation represents a relatively accurate estimate of your customer’s value
to your company over the lifetime of that customer’s business.
The following calculation doesn’t determine profit, but instead the overall
customer value that could eventually be realized in the best-case scenario
that a customer stays with you forever.
Find out for yourself just how much money each of your customers is worth
to you. Use Figure 8-1 along with the following instructions to calculate your
customers’ merit:
1. What is the average sale or amount of money a customer spends per
month?
Add up your total dollar sales for a year and divide that by the total
number of sales transactions you completed. I recommend using the
average sales of your 80/20 customer.
2. How many times a year does an average customer buy from you?
Estimate the frequency of purchase of a normal customer. A typical gro-
cery store customer probably shops 52 times per year. A consulting
company may only do one project per year for an average client.
3. What is the expected number of years a customer will use your ser-
vices or buy your products?
The expected number of years is very unique to each company. Think
about how long you anticipate maintaining relationships with the major-
ity of your customers. This configuration will give you a good number to
work with.
4. How many people per year does your average customer tell about
your company?
You may have to make a guess here. It’s probably between 3 and 12. Gener-
ally, the better your customer service, the higher this number will be.
5. What percentage of these people actually become customers?
The average is usually between 20 and 70 percent. This is a pretty large
range, so pick a percentage that you feel comfortable with given your
industry.
144
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

6. What is the lifetime value of your average customer?
Use the formula listed in Figure 8-1 to calculate the lifetime value of your
customers with and without the impact of referrals.
Take a look at how Strategic Essentials, a personal coaching business, applies
this calculation: If each coaching session is $150 and the average customer
has two sessions a month, gross sales per customer is $3,600 per year.
Estimating that a customer stays with a personal coach on an average of 
five years, the lifetime value of this customer, before referrals, is $18,000.
Customers that see results from personal coaching will more than likely tell
their friends. The power of positive word-of-mouth magnifies the value of
each customer. Conservatively estimating that each customer tells four
people, and 50 percent of those referrals, or two people, become customers,
the gross sales from referrals is $36,000. Therefore, the total lifetime value of
a customer is $54,000 (the gross sales per customer plus gross sales from
referrals). Wow! Doesn’t that change the importance of a $150 per hour
client?
Whether your lifetime value figure is three figures, six figures, or more, pro-
ducing a concrete dollar figure gives you a tangible point around which to
design customer strategies. Starting today, build the following ideas into 
your strategic plan and into your daily activities:

 Step up satisfaction. Now that you can see in cold, hard cash the impor-
tance of customer satisfaction, you want to step up the level of customer
contentment. Satisfied customers lead to loyal customers, and loyal cus-
tomers lead to referring customers.
 Support the customers who refer business to you. The impact of positive
word-of-mouth has a multiplying effect in the lifetime value calculation
and also in the marketplace.
 Hang your Lifetime Value of a Customer number in your breakroom.
Make sure that everyone understands the value of your customers. Keep
this number in mind when you’re dealing with disgruntled customers or
prioritizing your daily activities.
 Cut out any activity that signals indifference to your customers. These
activities send your clients packing. You know indifference when you’re
on the receiving end. Examples include sitting on hold for longer than
you want to, delayed replies to e-mails or voicemails, lack of follow-
through, and general carelessness.
Digging into Why Your Customers 
Are Your Customers
It’s time to uncover why your customers buy products from your company or
use your services. If you ask companies what they sell and then turn around
and survey their customers to ask what they buy, it’s usually not the same
thing. Generally speaking, your customers will give you a different answer or
express it in a different way. Quickly query a handful of your customers to
see it this holds true for your organization. Here is what to ask:
146
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 
Other departments are your customers too
As a department manager, you rely on other
departments and groups to get your job done.
Thinking about those other departments as
customers can help if you need to move from
single department thinking to cross-depart-
mental thinking. Besides, departments are
always resource constrained. If you grease the
skids of your relationships with other depart-
ments by thinking about how you provide value
to them, you’ll be able to see better uses of
company resources. Maybe you can’t find
money in your budget to implement a new order
tracking system, but with the IT department’s
help, showing them the value, you can work
cooperatively to benefit everyone. Taking a
customer approach to working with other
departments can often turn poor relations
around. Ultimately, you should be doing things
that are good for your department, your com-
pany, and your internal customers.

 Who buys?
 What do they buy?
 Why do they buy?
 When do they buy?
 How do they buy?
Take Netflix, an online DVD rental service, for example. Employees might say
that they sell a service that allows customers to check out and return DVD
rentals through the mail. Conversely, customers would say that they’re buying
convenience. In order to see your business through the eyes of your most
valuable customers, you have to understand what your customers think
they’re really buying from you. You have to think like your customers.
Answers to these questions can be found in information and feedback all
around you. Some of that information is easy to obtain and some takes a bit
more work. The following sections provide you with a list of methods you can
use to find out why your customers are your customers.
Satisfaction by the numbers
Measurements and metrics abound in our companies today. Customer-focused
metrics are a quick way to determine customer satisfaction. You can bench-
mark these metrics off industry standards, but more than likely, you know
what you want these numbers to be for your company. Are you hitting or
missing the mark? Which metrics are the most important to your customers?
Customer-focused metrics are numbers about activities that are important to
your customers. You can measure a lot of different parts of your business;
some of the data is meaningful and some is garbage. But if you want to see
your business through your customers’ eyes, track the items that they care
about. Here are some ideas to get your wheels turning. Customer-focused
metrics are very company-specific. Ask yourself, what do your customers
care about? Make sure you are measuring it.
 Volume by customer or client: Track customer sales by dollars or 
units per month and see if your 80/20 customers are starting to order
less frequently.
 Growth by customers or clients: Customers may be growing signifi-
cantly, but you need to also watch if the number of orders from them is
increasing. If it’s not, you may be missing a valuable growth opportunity.
147
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

 Referral rate: This number is the most important for the growth of your
company. If your customers are referring you, they’re happy. If they aren’t,
you have a problem.
 Time to respond to customer questions and inquires: How long does it
take you to respond to a customer request? Studies show the longer the
inquiry remains unanswered, the cooler the lead gets by 1 percent each
day. Response time is a big indicator of indifference.
 System-up time: This factor measures the percentage of time a com-
pany’s equipment or technology systems are up and running to serve
your customers. If the product or service is unreliable, it reduces the
value in the customers’ eyes.
 On-time delivery: If your product doesn’t get to the customer when he
expects it, the value of your product is diminished.
 Error rate: How many mistakes are made when entering customer
orders or delivering completed projects? Tracking your error rate is a
good indicator of customer satisfaction. If your error rate goes up, likely
your customer satisfaction is going down. Clearly you don’t want that to
happen.
 Returns/rejects/do-overs: This indicator focuses on how many products
or projects come back to you. Obviously is you have to fix a problem
project or a defective product, it costs your company time and money.
And you probably have an unhappy customer.
 Overall satisfaction: If you collect customer satisfaction data, make sure
to monitor it regularly.
Look how you’re doing in each of these areas compared with where you want
to be. This difference gives you a glimpse of your company’s strengths and
weaknesses. Determine which customer-focused key indicators you want
your business to measure and quantify, and then establish a baseline of cur-
rent performance, and set goals to increase performance in these critical
areas. You can obtain your measures through your internal data sources such
as customer surveys, CRM systems, fulfillment systems, and so on. If you
don’t have a source for a metric you want to track, ask an employee to track
it for you until you can set up a system to automate it.
Most organizations know what performance they want to achieve for specific
metrics. However, if you are looking for outside validation, check out your
industry association. Such associations usually have industry benchmarks.

Obtaining feedback without 
using a survey
Spending tons of money and months collecting customer feedback can be too
overwhelming and cost prohibitive for many companies. But still, obtaining
feedback is crucial for the ongoing success of your company. You can easily
retrieve information during the normal course of your business day.
Here’s a list of easy ways to obtain feedback from your customers without
using a standalone survey:
 At the point of purchase: There’s no time like the present,. Ask for 
feedback at the moment when the transaction takes place. This can be
face-to-face, on the phone, or over live chat. Customers might not be as
honest at this point, but ask a question that is not directly related to the
employee and you are more likely to get better answers.
 Order forms and invoices: Include a comments box on your forms and
include a business reply envelope for your customers to send back
the information.
 Online: Add a “Tell us what you think” link (preferably in the header or
footer) on every page of your Web site.
 Sales reps: Set up a easy way for your reps to feed information back into
your organization such as through an internal discussion board or intranet
that reps access.
 Newsletters: If you send one out, include a question or two. Newsletters
can be great tools to find out timely customer information. Instead of
asking service questions, consider asking about their industry or busi-
ness climate. Make sure to only ask one, at most two, questions.
 Telephone: Make sure that your voicemail tells customers how to give
you feedback.
 Comment cards: Include comment cards inside your shipments.
 Support calls: Your technical and customer service reps hear tons of
information from your customers. Set up a general system to collect the
feedback these employees hear every day.
Consider Lexus, the luxury car manufacturer. Management requires that
every employee, from the top to the bottom, interview ten customers every
month. By doing so, the company creates a culture that regularly puts cus-
tomer information in the hands of every employee.
149
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

Spend time talking to your customers
When all else fails, ask your customers why they buy from you! Ask these
questions of your 80/20 customers:
 What are we doing that’s great? What is working?
 What isn’t working and needs improvement?
 What else would you like to see from our company? What else could we
do to make your life easier?
 If we ceased to exist, what would you do? What would you be giving up?
 If a friend was in search of <fill in your type of company>, would you
refer us? Why or why not?
Sam Walton, of Wal-Mart, reportedly spent five days every month interacting
with customers in his stores. This amount of dedicated time kept him close
to and in touch with his customers needs and wants. Although I doubt his
customer attention was the only reason for Wal-Mart’s runaway success, it
surely played a big part.
Gathering feedback from a variety of sources results in an objective, compre-
hensive picture of who your customers are, what they want, and what they
value. However, collecting the information is only half of the equation. Ensure
that everyone in the company knows what customers are thinking by sharing
customer feedback through the organization. By spreading the news, every-
one will start to make better, more informed decisions. For your strategic
plan, you can use the information you collected over the years to make calcu-
lated decisions that have broader implications.
Uncovering How You Deliver 
Value to Your Customers
For many owners and department managers, focus represents the biggest
roadblock to corporate growth. It’s not exactly a lack of focus; it’s more the
tendency to unintentionally focus on the wrong things. Because strategic
planning is about focusing on the right things, keep your customers’ values in
the forefront of your planning efforts. Your company is operating in its sweet
spot when you’re focused on
150
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

 What you’re good at doing
 What you like doing
 What the market values you for doing
Connecting the dots between these three elements is critical because organi-
zations can easily lose focus on what their customers and the market truly
value.
Unfortunately, the term “value” is one of those undefined and vague business
concepts that sounds good and important but isn’t easy to get your arms
around. When the benefits of a product or service outweigh the costs, you
have value. Value makes something sweeter, better, stronger, faster. You can
have pancakes without syrup, but what’s the point? Value is the icing on the
cake. The result of providing superior value is wildly satisfied customers who
keep coming back again and again and bring their friends.
Home Depot not only has the best selection on all home improvement prod-
ucts, but also it offers know-how through free classes or on its online resource
center. These processes and extras add value and create extremely loyal 
customers.
Unlocking the value chain
One of the best ways to understand value in your organization is to construct
a value chain. A value chain is a way to look at your processes through your
customers eyes.
A value chain is defined as
 A tool to dissect your organization into core and supporting activities
 A holistic look at your organization and how departments work with
other departments
 A way to prioritize resources and activities based on your customer
needs
 A method to see each and every way you interact with or “touch” your
customers through your organization.
You can’t get to true customer satisfaction that leads to ultimate loyalty if
you don’t have an understanding of your processes from the patrons’ per-
spective. And the value chain is the best way to see how your internal
process impacts customer loyalty.
151
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

A value chain comprises primary and secondary activities. The links in the
chain help you to better understand at what point in your processes you’re
adding value to the customer’s product or service.
The primary activities in your value chain are activities that are directly con-
cerned with creating and delivering your product or service. These activities
are as follows:
 Research and development: Activities such as developing technology,
researching product ideas, and finding suppliers and vendors that relate
to what goes into the development of a product or service
 Operations: Activities related to production, assembly, packaging, qual-
ity assurance
 Distribution and delivery: Activities associated with getting the prod-
uct or service to the customer
152
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 
Printing up a superior customer experience
When a weekly community newspaper ana-
lyzed its value chain, the publisher realized that
several of its supporting activities detracted
from the overall customer experience. For
example
 In the general administration area, the news-
paper’s invoices only offered one method of
payment, when there were actually three
ways to pay. The publisher immediately
revised the invoices to include all options.
The cost to the company was next to nothing
as they were computer-generated. Decrease
in delinquent accounts: 40 percent.
 In the human resource management area,
the organization’s high turnover rate made
customers question the viability of the
newspaper. The publisher instituted a more
rigorous hiring process that included a
third-party skills and personality assess-
ment to make sure that the right people
were “on the bus.”
 In the area of technology, the newspaper
didn’t have an online renewal form. This
feature was quickly added, which allowed
subscribers to maintain their subscriptions
with a click of their mouse instead of call-
ing, faxing, or snail mailing in their renewal
forms.
Don’t these changes seem obvious and straight-
forward? It’s easier to see the errors of others
or after someone points them out to you. Well,
it wasn’t until the publisher used the value chain
that he realized where the links were broken.
The organization’s core product is highly
regarded in the community, but the supporting
activities were hindering business growth.

 Marketing and sales: Activities such as advertising, sales force efforts,
promotion, and dealer and distributor support that relate to reaching
the customer
 Servicing: Activities associated with after-sales support and assistance
to buyers
The secondary activities in your value chain support and strengthen your
company’s primary activities. These activities aren’t directly involved in pro-
duction but may increase your effectiveness. These processes include
 General administration: General management, finance, accounting, and
legal
 Human resource management: Recruitment, hiring, training, develop-
ment, and compensation
 Technology and systems: Technology systems and telecommunication
systems
 Procurement: Purchasing raw materials and supplies and services
It’s rare for a business to undertake all of these activities. For example, an
employment agency doesn’t have any raw materials, so the procurement area
is unutilized.
Developing your value chain
By developing your company’s or department’s value chain, you’ll be able to
see where you’re adding and delivering value to your customers and where
you aren’t. This addition is a great way to uncover areas that need improve-
ment in your operations, in your delivery, and in the coordination between
departments.
You can develop your value chain by using the framework illustrated in
Figure 8-2. Break up your activities into primary and secondary activities
and only list the ones that are key to your business.
1. Break down your organization into its key primary areas using the
framework in Figure 8-2.
Revise the headings to fit your company. List the areas in order from the
first good idea to the finished product or service.
2. List your key supporting or secondary areas.
As with your primary areas, revise the headings in the form to fit your
company.
153
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

3. List one or two key activities for each of the primary areas.
For each area that your company undertakes that adds value, think
about it from your customer’s perspective.
4. List one or two key activities for each of the supporting areas.
It can be more difficult to see how these activities contribute to the end
product or service. But look critically and think about how an area such
as administration can have an impact on your value chain.
5. Review each area of your completed framework.
Are there any links missing in the chain? Are there places where you
aren’t adding value that you could? Where could your value chain be
stronger? Use answers to these questions to develop goals for your
strategic plan.

Kicking Your Value Up a Notch
Take out you big-strategy guns and kick it up a notch. To increase your value,
you need to create something that is better or different than your competi-
tors. By constructing your value chain, you now know what you can do in
specific areas to improve. In this section, you find out how to have a company-
or department-wide approach to providing a unique mix of products and/or
services to your customers. By having an organization-wide strategy or value-
creating strategies, you can consistently provide a product or service that is
better than your competition.
Below are three generally accepted organization-wide strategies. Each of the
items in italics are explained in greater detail in the following section.
 Providing the lowest cost through operational excellence
 Providing the best products or services through continued innovation
 Providing complete customer solutions through intimately knowing their
needs and wants
In case you’re tempted to execute all three, think again. That’s called being
stuck in the middle or riding the fence. Executing a stuck in the middle strat-
egy is like being in the middle seat of a five-seat row on a 747. You don’t know
whether to crawl over the mom with her sleeping baby to the right or over
the guy with his laptop to the left. It’s not a good place to be! Companies that
find themselves in this position usually end up in a financial crisis or reorga-
nization. That said, this doesn’t mean you don’t do the other activities well.
You just don’t focus on them as much as the ones that are central to creating
value for your customers.
A value-creating strategy should be selected for each target customer group
that you serve. For smaller organizations or departments, select one strategy
for your whole company. Managing multiple value propositions can be nearly
impossible.
Selecting your organization-wide strategy really comes down to determining
what your customers value the most about what you’re providing them. The
low prices? Your cutting-edge products? Your ability to deliver a service that
fits their needs exactly? Take a look at each option to see which strategy is
the best fit for your company.
155
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

Creating value through 
excellent operations
Creating value through excellent operations focuses on appealing to a broad
spectrum of customers based on being the overall low-cost provider of a
product or service because of the company’s focus on efficiency. The com-
pany implementing this strategy provides superior value to their customers
by offering them lowest total cost.
An operationally excellent value proposition sounds something like this:
“We offer products and services that are always consistent, on-time, and
low in cost.” Check out these goals if you’re executing this strategy:
 To continually offer the most attractive prices
 To purchase and source from the lowest-cost suppliers
 To offer excellent and consistent quality
 To ensure that our company has a good product or service selection
 To make buying from our company easy and fast
To reach your goals, you need to master your operational processes. This
process includes monitoring outstanding supply chain management, super
efficient operations to control costs, cycle time and quality, and inventory
management.
Paul’s Plumbing, a plumbing, heating, and air conditioning company, creates
outstanding value through a real-time data system. All of the company’s techni-
cians have powerful handheld data systems that allow them to accept service
orders, respond to them, and close them all in one smooth process. Through
this data system, the company cuts down its operational costs by reducing
drive time, service order data entry, and error rates due to lost orders and
billing costs. The company’s customer satisfaction has soared because most
service orders are responded to on the same day as requested, there’s little sur-
prise in the final bill, and the company’s prices are the lowest across the board.
Other companies that continue to offer the best buy or lowest cost through their
excellent internal operations include Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines, Dell, and Ikea.
Creating value through innovation
This strategy concentrates on creating a unique, innovative product or ser-
vice line. A company implementing this strategy provides superior value by
156
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

offering its customers a continuous stream of innovative products or ser-
vices. It seeks to identify emerging opportunities and continuously strives to
develop and deliver new products and services.
A product and/or service leadership value proposition sounds something like
this: “We offer products and services that expand existing boundaries past
what was thought possible.” To execute this strategy, your goals may look
something like the following:
 To strive to be first-to-market with new products, services, or functionality
 To always produce leading-edge products and services that exceed the
performance of competing products
 To maintain higher prices than competitors because of the superior
product
 To reach new customer groups
You need to master your innovation processes and develop an innovation
culture to reach your goals. These steps include a pipeline full of new ideas, a
conversion rate of ideas to production, excellent and quick product develop-
ment processes, and marketing and sales departments that can bring the
product to market quickly.
Instead of studying Spanish by going to classes or hiring a tutor, students in
Guatemala learned from Spanish tutors through Speak Shop, a Web-based
application that allows video and voice conferencing. The company was first
to market with this innovative method to connect students and tutors in their
homes or at work. To maintain its first-mover position, the company continues
to add functionality such as quizzes, lesson plans, curriculum, and discussion
boards to enhance its core product.
Additional companies that are always on the cutting edge of their industries
include Intel, Mercedes, Sony, and Salesforce.com.
Creating value through knowing 
your customers
Creating value through really knowing your customers concentrates on a
narrow market segment by a deep understanding of its customer and their per-
ception of the value of the product or service offered. A company implement-
ing this strategy provides superior value by tailoring its products or services to
match exactly the needs of targeted customers. It specializes in satisfying
unique customer needs through an intimate knowledge of the customers.
157
Chapter 8: Seeing Your Business Through Customers’ Eyes

A customer intimacy value proposition sounds something like this: “We pro-
vide the best total solution to our customers because we make a practice of
know exactly what they need.” Try to fashion your goals around the exam-
ples below:
 To ensure that our customers feel like we understand them by continu-
ally engaging in market research and responding to it
 To provide customized products and services to meet their needs
 To stress exceptional customer service
 To install and effectively use a customer relationship management
system
 To offer and sell a complete solution (selling multiple and bundled prod-
ucts and services)
Develop a customer-focused culture to attain these marks. These procedures
include offering as many products and services that your customers are look-
ing to you to provide — meaning that you completely solve the problem or
need that your customers have.
A rapid software development company develops tools for online collabora-
tion. Based on customer feedback, the company develops additional tools
and online applications specifically to meet the needs of their growing client

in a Dynamic Environment
In This Chapter
 Classifying opportunities for and threats to your operating business
 Capitalizing on opportunities in your operating environment
 Predicting your industry shifts
 Sizing up your competition
 Rounding out your SWOT analysis
You’re headed down your strategy road with a bus that is primed and
tuned. It’s time to look out the windows and check out what is going on
around you. How’s the landscape? Is it breathtaking or gray? What’s happen-
ing with the weather and how is the condition of the road? All of these factors
influence how smoothly you travel down your path to success.
Assume there are several storms brewing on the horizon. Three to be exact.
Each one of them is a little further away from the next. The closer the storm,
the more potential impact it will have on your trip. The ones furthest out may
or may not impact you, but you keep on eye on them nevertheless. The land-
scape your company operates in is exactly the same. If you are the bus or at
the center, there are three influences on your business. Starting with the
outer ring of Figure 9-1, they are
 Your operating environment
 Your industry, which includes your competitors
 Your market

Some external influences or factors have more direct impact on your busi-
ness than others. Others just take a little longer to get there. By looking at
your landscape in four areas, you won’t miss anything that might be hiding
on the horizon.
The success or failure of your organization depends not only on your internal
capabilities and resources (strengths and weaknesses, discussed in Chapter 7),
but also on things that happen outside of your control (opportunities and
threats). All of the information in this chapter helps you identify the forces,
issues, trends, and events that can positively or negatively impact your business.
What possibilities do you see on the horizon and where are the minefields?
In this chapter, you identify potential opportunities and threats that may
impact on your business. You discover some of the larger trends likely to
impact all businesses over the next ten years as well as how to spot the ones
not covered. Lastly, you bring all the pieces of your SWOT together to create
a complete picture of your company’s strategic position.

Identifying Opportunities and Threats
When responding to opportunities and threats in your environment, you
need to react proactively rather than reactively. Being ready for what ifs can
help you determine your strategic position. Figure 9-2 illustrates how these
elements fit into your SWOT (also covered in Chapters 7 and 8).
You need to take a quick pulse of your company’s opportunities and threats
to assess your external situation. To do so, investigate the various areas
listed in Figure 9-2 to get more specific about what is happening in your oper-
ating environment.
After you assess your situation, check out Figure 9-3. The questionnaire can
help start your list of opportunities and threats if you’re having trouble get-
ting going.

Don’t forget to ask for help — getting objective input from others helps you
see parts you may have missed. The section “Finishing Your SWOT Analysis”
later in this chapter gives you ideas about how to proceed, too. Additionally,
use Figure 9-4 to spark some ideas.
To capture all your thoughts and keep them in order, create a note page with
a line horizontally in the middle. Label the top section Opportunities and the
bottom section Threats. Jot down thoughts about a new market under the
opportunities section and ideas on a competitor’s action under Threats. 
(I use this same notation in other chapters when referring to notes.)

Seeing the Future
How much time do you spend thinking about your company’s future? Chances
are, not much. For the most part, putting out fires and taking care of the day-
to-day tasks consume most of your time. But to be strategic in your business,
you must discover how to spot future opportunities and threats as soon as
possible. Yes, you do need to identify the immediate forces at work, but you
also want to think about and plan for the future operating environment and
industry trends. The value lies in anticipating change before it happens, instead
of mindlessly reacting to whatever comes at you next.
What changes should you be thinking about? Answering these questions
should get you started:
 Who will your customers be five years from now?
 How will you reach these customers?
 Do you regularly improve your product quality and customer satisfaction?
 What is your company’s status as a trendsetter within your industry?
 Are you aware of new competitive threats on the horizon?
 Are you focused on catching up to the competition or on innovations in
the marketplace?
 Is management flexible enough to alter your business model as necessary?
 How does your approach to forward thinking compare to your competition?
Your answers to these broad-reaching questions can tell you a lot about who
you are today and what may need to change within your business. The response
can also give you a better sense of the type of resources you need to commit
to reaching your organization’s future. Make sure to push the boundaries.
Think about each area in this chapter in terms of the present but also how it
affects you five or even ten years down the road.
Finding Opportunities in Your 
Operating Environment
No one has a crystal ball into the future, but certain trends appear to be in
the making, and are worth considering now. Although it’s sometimes difficult
to know how environmental forces are going to impact your business, they
163
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

really do matter. Like the weather – you are subconsciously aware of the
force, but it’s not until a big storm comes that you really pay attention. The
important part, like everything in strategic planning, is to figure out which
trends matter to your business. Huge successes can come from being aware
of environmental forces, as you will see in this section.
Your operating environment is influenced by several general areas. These
areas summarize the external environment every organization operates in.
Refer back to Figure 9-1 to get a clear picture of influences in your operating
environment.
Remember your operating environment is the outside circle influencing your
business. Some of these trends and issues may even appear to come and go
in slow motion. You may not need to watch them religiously, but having an
eye on them could be the key to your company’s boom — or bust. Also, some
of these issues may seem ridiculous to you or doomsdayish, but what’s
ridiculous to you, someone else may be experiencing.
In the next several sections, you discover many opportunities in your operat-
ing environment.
Identifying your economic indicators
Movements and shifts in the economy affect consumer purchasing power and
spending patterns. The state of the United States and world economies can
be either an opportunity or a threat for any business depending if your com-
pany improves and declines with the economy (real estate) or if the opposite
happens (price of gold). Economic indicators can be frustrating to watch
because it seems as though today’s news contradicts yesterday’s report.
Nevertheless, the economy is probably one of the biggest influences on your
business.
There are many economic indicators that affect businesses. These areas may
not be of the utmost importance for every business, but consider this list of
common economic indicators:
 Overall economic growth or by industry
 Interest rates
 Government spending
 Changes in employment policies and minimum wage
 Housing costs
164
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

 Exchange rates, which impact demand from overseas customers
 Availability of capital
 Consumer confidence
Even outside trends tend to impact economic indicators. Some of these areas
are out of our control and are likely to be huge factors over the next ten
years. Check and see if you can identify any opportunities or threats for your
business in the list below:
 Increasing price of oil: The general consensus is that the era of cheap
oil is probably over.
 Shrinking middle class: Rich people are getting richer; the number of
people in the middle class is shrinking, and the underclass is growing
and getting poorer. The result: A larger gap between rich and poor.
 Increasing natural disasters: The possibility of more natural disasters is
a growing concern. These occurrences not only take a human toll but
also upset local and national economies.
 Decreasing birth rate: Some of the world’s most powerful economies,
Europe and Japan, are losing people faster than they’re replacing them.
The U.S. is barely hanging on. This means fewer consumers with the
money to spend. The implications of this consumer shortage may play
out over the next 10 to 20 years.
World Prep sells 30 different types of survival kits, which include items such as
thermal blankets, hand warmers, water, and food bars. The company was per-
fectly positioned to make a profit when natural disasters such as the tsunami,
hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the earthquakes in Iran occurred in 2004 and
2005. In business for six years, World Prep grossed $1.6 million in 2005.
Watching important social shifts
Cultural and societal shifts are probably the hardest to spot because the
result of these forces affect a society’s general attitudes, preferences, tastes,
and beliefs. Catching, or even better, predicting, a social trend can be a home
run for your business. Think about the low-carb craze, the reinvention of
coffee as a lifestyle, digital music, outsourcing, offshoring, and so on.
Social indicators include issues such as
 Labor availability and types
 Lifestyle changes such as working from home or single households
165
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

 Attitudes about work and leisure
 Education
 Health
 Fashion and fads
 Business model changes
 Living conditions
Here’s what to watch for or capitalize on:
 Giving power to customers: Customers have the ability to dictate 
product quality, price, service, and delivery standards to retailers 
and manufacturers.
 Changing the face of a career: Tomorrow’s employee makes more
career changes, works a shorter time in each position, demands more
independence, and requires greater retraining. More than 45 million
people currently work from home.
 Becoming more and more beautiful: America’s obsession with looking
beautiful is growing. Products and services around gene therapy ($6.5
billion market in five years), dietary supplements ($16 billion in 2004),
and cosmetic procedures (one of every 25 people in 2004) are bound to
keep growing at a stratospheric pace.
Staying on top of technology trends
Many people believe that the revolutionary impact technology has had on
products, processes, and communication systems has just begun. New tech-
nologies and processes continue to change the way organizations operate
daily. The problem for most companies is evaluating which advances are
truly opportunities and which are distracting.
Failure to monitor and address advances may negatively impact your finan-
cial position in the market. Areas to watch include government spending on
technology, big new discoveries or products, speed of technology transfer,
and changes in business processes as a result of technology.
Here are some trends over the next ten years that may be opportunities or
threats to your business:
 Embedding the Internet in every part of our lives: Internet technologies
make it easier to have strategic partnerships; put the customer more in
control of the buying process; reduce the costs of customer service; offer
166
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

new ways to recruit, train, and retain employees; and provide new commu-
nication tools.
 Growth of robots: Robots and other automation-based technologies
handle most repetitive tasks.
 More open source programs. Open source software — where the pro-
gramming code that runs the application is accessible to anyone — is
expected to grab more than 20 percent of the world-wide software
market in five years. The estimated cost to software makers is $100 bil-
lion in revenue, according to the Gartner Group.
With more than 63 million Americans expected to be hooked up to broad-
band by 2008, companies large and small are making serious money by doing
everything from working virtually, to offering online services, to distributing
anything that is digital. Skype, the world’s fastest growing Internet telephony
provider, was sold to eBay for $2.6 billion. Why the large price tag? It boasted
more than 54 million customers worldwide using its service, virtually free.
Monitoring political winds
Keeping tabs on your government’s policies and legislation on business
related issues is crucial. Decisions made at the federal, state, and local level
can have significant impact on how you do business. For example, new taxes
can cut into already thinning margins, or cuts can improve them. Or changes
in labor laws can impact how you handle your employees.
Naturally, legislative threats or opportunities can occur on the local, state,
and national levels. Monitoring the political winds includes taxes, interna-
tional trade regulations, consumer protection, environmental policies, the
pro- or anti- business attitude of the president, and the biggie — healthcare
legislation.
Here’s what is blowing in over the next ten years:
 Increasing costs of healthcare: Government policies regarding health-
care coverage are important for business owners to monitor. Right now,
benefits are estimated to be 40 percent of compensation costs and
healthcare costs are clearly on the rise. This burden is big for busi-
nesses, especially if you’re watching your margins.
 Increasing security measures: How the government deals with the secu-
rity issue isn’t going to be solved anytime soon. From wiretapping to
hellish airport lines, our lives continue to be invaded for our protection.
167
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

The CEO of Verified Identify Pass Inc. took one look at the current security sit-
uation and saw a major opportunity. He created the Clear Card, which is a one-
stop clearance card with data including a set of fingerprints, iris scan, and a
Transportation Security Administration threat assessment. With this card, the
owner can easily pass through any private security checkpoint — like the air-
port. Currently, the company is beta testing its product at several airports.
Flexing with demographic movements
Futurists say that you can’t understand the future without demographics.
Knowing what is going on with demographic changes and movements helps
you plan for the demand for your company’s products and services as well
as labor issues. For instance, sometimes seemingly unexplainable lulls or
growth spurts, especially in the retail and restaurant industries, can be
explained by understanding the changes in the demographics.
Here are the big movements that may impact every business in the United
States:
 Labor shortage: The lack of highly-skilled people is a growing concern.
Knowledgeable workers are going to be increasingly in demand.
 Graying of America: Right now, the baby boomer generation represents
a market of about 36 million people. In five years, the 65+ population will
be growing faster than the population as a whole. Opportunities abound
for businesses working on producing products and services to meet the
needs of older consumers.
 Increasing diversity: Minorities, primarily of Latin American and Asian
descent, will make up one-third of the U.S. population in ten years. Right
now, one in every seven people is Hispanic. In ten years, one in every
four people in the U.S. will be Hispanic.
 Greater economic achievement by women: By 2016, three million more
women can be attending college than men. Education is connected with
economic status, therefore women will gain more influence, purchasing
power, and leadership.
Senior Insight Inc., a small Denver-based company, is poised to help the Baby
Boomers through their later years. The company developed a software pack-
age for assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and adult daycare. Unlike a
traditional hospital, these facilities need patient records that any caregiver
can access for daily instructions on eating, bathing, exercise, and medica-
tions. Senior Insight’s system is built specifically around long-term care.
Revenues have doubled over the past two years and the company knows this
is just the beginning.
168
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

Going global
Globalization, or doing business with companies and customers around the
world, is increasing as quickly as the Internet is growing. The impact of glob-
alization has been felt in every part of our businesses and our lives. These
trends stand on their own because of the magnitude of the opportunities or
threats that they pose.
Here’s what can change the global landscape over the next ten years:
 Shift of labor: Money and jobs are still flowing into India at a rapid rate.
The National Academy of Sciences stated that India graduated 200,000
engineers in 2004 versus 20,000 in the U.S.
 Growth of China: The sheer might of the Chinese economy may force
every business to rethink its approach. The World Economic Forum pre-
dicts that China will become the second-largest global economy by 2020.
 Terrorism on the rise: Society can’t be lulled into thinking that terror-
ism efforts won’t increase. It is here to stay. The business opportunity
lies in providing security services and products. The threat lies in pro-
tecting your assets: physical, financial, and human.
Growing natural
All the government legislation doesn’t hold a candle to the impact businesses
are having on environmental progress. The resources, constraints, overpopu-
lation, and pollution are just a few of the trends driving environmental prod-
ucts, services, and business practices. The big change in the trend is that the
environmental services are now becoming profitable.
Here’s what’s growing:
 Shortage of raw materials and development of new materials: With the
cost of oil on the rise, demand for non petro-chemical-based materials is
increasing. Same goes for other natural resources.
 Increasing population: By 2050, the global population is estimated to
reach 9.2 billion people.
 Environmental sustainability: Huge opportunities exist with reusing,
recycling, and creating biodegradable products. Clean energy is boom-
ing with solar cells, wind turbines, and eliminating preventable energy
loss.
169
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

Leave it to DuPont to develop a product to replace plastic. Its newest product
is called Sorona, a corn-based version of plastic. DuPont clearly identified the
growing threat of high oil prices, and turned it into an opportunity by creat-
ing a solution. Sorona, referred to as the new nylon, is expected to hit the
streets in a few years and could soon be in everything from underwear to
carpet.
Monitoring Your Industry
An industry is a group of companies that sell products or services that are
close substitutes of each other, such as the furniture industry, the car indus-
try, or the financial services industry. Knowing the type of industry you’re
competing in helps you predict changes, movements, or shifts that may
impact your business. It’s also helpful to know how competitive your indus-
try is because some are more cutthroat than others.
What industry does your company operate in? You can most easily identify it
by answering the question, “If customers were to purchase elsewhere, what are
all the potential options that exist?”
Classify the different types of companies you identify with in small groups
until you have a big enough circle to define the entire set. For the most part,
identifying your industry is intuitive, but sometimes the nets aren’t cast wide
enough. For example, a charter sailing company isn’t in the cruise industry.
Instead, the company is swimming in a bigger pond called the travel and
tourism industry.
In an effort to understand the dynamic nature of an industry, you can break
any industry into five components or forces: new competitors, substitute
products, power of suppliers, power of buyers, and competitive rivalry.
These five forces impact every industry in some form or fashion and deter-
mine your industry’s attractiveness and long-run profitability. Each force is
discussed in the next sections.
Looming new competitors
Obviously, the more companies swimming in the same pond, competing for
the same customers, the more competitive the industry. Often some com-
petition is better than none. But if it’s easy for someone to jump into your
industry (for example, restaurants, online services, advertising agencies, and
so on), the threat of new competitors is very high. Conversely, if big startup
170
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

costs and regulatory hurdles have to be crossed —like the construction, 
airline, and manufacturing industries — your may not feel as threatened.
The barriers that exist determine how big of a threat this force is.
Key barriers include
 Economies of scale (when more units of a good or a service can be pro-
duced on a larger scale, yet with, on average, less input costs, economies
of scale are achieved)
 The size of the capital or investment requirements
 The ease or difficulty of switching from one company to another
 The ability to access distribution channels
 The likelihood of retaliation by existing companies
The number of companies developing and selling Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) systems seems to grow every year. Companies in this
space include Salesforce.com, Siebel, ACT, Microsoft with its Business
Contact Manager, Intuit, and Oracle. As more and more companies join the
party, the current players see the threat of new competitors increasing.
The entry barriers are relatively low except one: the difficulty for customers
to move from one platform to another. In fact, anyone who’s implemented a
CRM system knows that the biggest challenge is getting people within the
company to adopt the new system. Moving around from one platform to
another is a time-consuming process and can kill your business. Because this
barrier is so high, the threat of new competitors to established companies is
slightly diminished. The opportunity for the established companies is to grab
as much market share as quickly as possible.
Threatening substitute products
With the continual flux of technologies and the speed of development, the
threat of a substitute products taking the place of yours is greater than ever
before. Substitute products can be an area of opportunity or an area of threat
depending on when you catch wind of the change. If you’re on top of it, you
could produce the new product. If you’re behind the change curve, you may
likely see a decline in demand. The probability that customers will move to a
new product or service is based on three areas:
 The customer’s willingness to change
 The price and performance of the new product
 The cost to switch
171
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

The popularity of satellite radio has exploded over the past several years,
with the two main companies, XM Radio and Sirius, grabbing market share as
fast as possible. With more and more consumers tuning into satellites instead
of radio tuners, traditional radio stations are finding their listener base
declining rapidly. Who knows the ultimate fate of AM and FM, but media com-
panies are scrambling to reposition themselves because a substitute product
is whisking its customers away.
Bargaining power of suppliers
Suppliers or vendors are any company that provides raw materials, compo-
nents, or services into your industry. The amount of control your suppliers
have over the price of goods you purchase dictates whether this area is an
opportunity or threat. The more suppliers, the less control any one company
can have over controlling your costs. The power of your suppliers is high
when any of the following factors exist:
 Few suppliers and many buyers
 Similar products or services but with higher value or cost
 Suppliers or vendors threaten to integrate forward (like Nike opening its
own retail stores called Niketown)
 Your industry isn’t a key customer group for the supplier
AT&T sells many of its telecommunication services through independent
sales agents. This distribution channel has facilitated the growth of many
small telecommunications consulting companies that resell AT&T products.
The commission earned off these products was a primary source of revenue
for these agents’ businesses. AT&T is one of only a few suppliers of tele-
phony. Because of this fact, losing one of the only suppliers was a huge threat
to these companies. And AT&T took advantage of that power by terminating
many agent contracts and bringing the accounts in-house. This action was
completely legal but destroyed many agents’ businesses.
Bargaining power of buyers
The power of buyers can be summed up in one word – Wal-Mart. Because
10 cents of every consumer dollar is spent at Wal-Mart, any company in the
consumer goods industry must contend with the force of its buying power.
Buyers in this analysis are anyone who creates demand in your industry.
The power of buyers is great when any of the following factors exist:
172
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

 Many sellers, few buyers
 Buyers threaten to integrate backwards (a computer manufacturer
deciding to produce semiconductors or another component they would
normally purchase)
 Your industry’s products are standardized with little differentiation
between competing products
 Your industry isn’t a key supplying group for the buyers
Duking it out with your competitors
The rivalry or intensity at which you compete against your competition can
move and change over time as the dynamics of the industry change. Competitive
rivalry is an opportunity or a threat depending on how you handle it.
Do you recognize the intensity of the competition and are positioning your-
self accordingly? Or are you feeling the pressures, but don’t know where
they’re coming from? The following aspects have an effect on whether you
feel the pressure of your industry more or less:
 The structure of the competition: Rivalry is greater when there are
many small companies and less when there’s a clear market leader.
 Growth objectives: Rivalry is greater when everyone is focused on growth
(like biotech) and less when the industry is mature (like publishing).
 Exit barriers: If leave an industry is expensive or difficult, rivalries tend
to be higher.
 Degree of differentiation: This factor is present in industries where
products are commodities. Commodities are products and services that
have no obvious differences and companies compete on price (like com-
puters, steel, and so on). Rivalry is higher than when competitors can
differentiate their products.
 The structure of the industry costs: In industries that have high fixed
costs (like manufacturing), competitors tend to cut prices to fill unused
manufacturing capacity, which leads to higher rivalry.
Analyzing Your Competition
It’s easy to swing from one extreme to another when it comes to analyzing your
competition. Some organizations don’t worry about what their competitors are
173
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

doing and just charge ahead. Others track every move and assess how to react.
You want to fall somewhere in the middle.
The reason to even do a competitive analysis is to assess the opportunities
and threats that may occur from those organizations competing for the same
business you are. You need to have an understanding of what your competi-
tors are or aren’t offering your potential customers. Here are a few other key
ways a competitive analysis fits into strategic planning:
 To help you assess whether your competitive advantage is really an
advantage. Your competitive advantage, by its definition, means you
have an advantage over your competition. (Flip to Chapter 5 for more
on competitive advantage.) If you don’t know your competitors well
enough, you won’t know if you really are better than they are in the
areas you’ve isolated as your competitive advantages.
 To understand what your competitor’s current and future strategies
are so you can plan accordingly. You don’t want to being crafting the
same strategy as they are or you won’t be successful. Remember, you
want to be unique in the value you provide to your customers.
 To provide information that will help you evaluate your strategic deci-
sions against what your competitors may or may not be doing. It’s nice
not to make decisions in a vacuum. By looking at what your competitors
are and aren’t doing, you might find out if you are missing something
they have already identified. Or, conversely, if you are on to a trend that
they haven’t noticed, you might need to move faster.
The process of gathering competitive intelligence is like putting together a
big puzzle. Each piece individually may not seem that interesting, but when
all of the pieces are put together, you have a complete and useful picture. In
the same vein, if you don’t have enough information, the picture will be
incomplete.
Before conducting your competitive analysis, decide your basis of compari-
son. In other words, are you doing the analysis on a product or service? A
product or service line? Or on the company as a whole?
Identifying your competitors
If you’re gearing up for a big athletic competition, your training regimen is
directly proportional to who you’re competing against. You really don’t want
to work harder than you have to, right? Well, it’s the same thing for your busi-
ness. Certainly, if you’re running a for-profit business, you’re competing to
win. If you’re a nonprofit or a department head, you’re competing for scare
174
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

resources, usually funding. In all cases, you need to know who you’re trying
to beat so you can position yourself properly.
The clearest way to identify your competitors is to figure out if you weren’t
around, who would supply your customers to fill their needs and what cus-
tomer would buy to solve their problem?
Competitors come in three flavors, as discussed in the next sections.
Direct competitors
These companies are the ones you need to find out the most about because
they’re your fiercest competitors. When customers are making purchasing
decisions, their products or services always end up on the short list. With
this group, you’re vying for the same customer dollar. More than likely, you
have three or four companies that fall into this category.
Indirect competitors
These companies offer alternative products and services than your offering.
Usually, you don’t worry about these companies too much, but you should
keep tabs on what they’re up to. Sometimes an indirect competitor can
become a direct competitor.
Substitutes or new entrants
While conducting your competitive analysis, determine if there are substitute
products or potential new entrants. A substitute product is anything that
delivers the same set of benefits to your customers as you do, but is not a
competing product. For example, DVD rental is a substitute service to cable
TV. There could be new companies or entrants coming on the scene that
might change your industry completely, such as satellite radio has done to
the radio industry.
Don’t restrict your thinking only to companies similar to your own. Consider
firms outside of the realm of possibility such as those who compete in the
industry from a corporate strategic viewpoint. When contemplating the
future, it’s necessary to envision any number of possibilities.
Gathering competitive intelligence
In the past, it was often difficult to collect data on your competitors. Today’s
overabundance of information makes this important analysis much easier.
Not only can it be done legally and ethically, but also there are a plethora of
sources available to you. Check out Table 9-1 for a list of sources.

The sources for our competitive analysis are broken into three groups –
online, physical, and undercover. Information online is the easiest to secure,
followed by physical, and then undercover.
Isolating what you really need to know
Undoubtedly there are some things you probably know or someone knows
about your competitors. You really don’t need to know about the CEO’s
favorite lunch spot or the receptionist’s name.
Here’s what you do care about:
 What is the profile of your competitors? Who are they? What products/
services do they sell? How many employees are in the company? See
Table 9-2 for more ideas.
 What are the company’s strengths and weaknesses?
 What are their competitive advantages?
 What are their strategies and objectives? Where are they headed and
how are they going to get there?
176
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

Take the time to formalize what you know and what you want to know in writ-
ing. With this list in mind, you can more easily sort out what’s important from
what’s unimportant when you conduct your competitive analysis. You can
also make a small SWOT grid for each of your competitors (see Figure 9-2 at
the beginning of this chapter for an example of a SWOT grid). See Table 9-2
below for more specifics on what you need to know about your competitors.

After you collect data on your competition (see the previous section), what
do you do with it? Follow these steps for weeding out the info:
1. Narrow down your playing field if at all possible.
Look closely at your three top competitors.
2. Determine what your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses are.
The factors can be customer service, pricing, quality, operations,
resources, personnel, and so on. Develop a good understanding of likely
changes your competitors might make in the near future.
3. List the strengths and weaknesses that are an opportunity or a threat
to your company.
177
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

Add your thoughts to your list of opportunities and threats you started
at the beginning of the chapter. You will use this information to develop
strategies, strategic objectives, and goals in Chapter 12.
If you find your competitors are lacking or missing some obvious opportuni-
ties, this opening is a perfect chance for your business to fill the void. To do
so, you need to figure out the best strategy. Review the different strategies
listed in Chapter 8 for ways to differentiate yourself from your competition.
Your competitive analysis guides you to select the one that gives you an edge
on your competition.
Analyzing Your Market
Referring back to Figure 9-1 in the beginning of the chapter, your market is
the ring that is the closest to your company. Trends, changes, and shifts that
occur in your market likely have the biggest impact on your company. Your
market is a group of customers that you can easily identify who respond to
your products or services in similar ways. Your offering satisfies the needs
and wants of the whole group.
You need to have a complete picture of your company; it’s important to take
a high-level look at your market. Based on the information you have available
today, you can quickly determine the opportunities and threats that exist in
your markets by following a few steps:
1. List the three to five main markets you compete in. Also list one or
two that are new potential markets.
2. For each market, determine if it is growing, shrinking, or staying
the same.
3. Determine the size of each market.
4. Determine if serving the market presents an opportunity or if the
market is not worth focusing on.
5. Summarize the markets you want to focus on in your opportunities
section of your SWOT.
Don’t worry about being exhaustive in your list because this can cripple your
planning effort. You need to have enough information to feel comfortable
with making decisions based on what you’ve collected. If you don’t feel com-
fortable with the information you have available today, select one or two
items to research further.
178
Part III: Sizing Up Your Current Situation 

Summarizing Your Opportunities 
and Threats
Opportunities and threats are external factors, forces that you don’t control but
can take advantage of if appropriate. For example, an opportunity may be that
the rising number of Hispanic consumers could lead to an increased demand for
your product if your company is positioned correctly. A threat might be the pro-
liferation of technology is making a current product obsolete.
If you answered the questionnaires in the previous sections, you have a good
starting point to summarize and add to your key opportunities and threats.
You can translate those thoughts into a grid like Figure 9-2. Right now you
have developed thoughts to fill in the two right-hand quadrants on the grid.
Finishing Your SWOT Analysis
If you’ve been working through the last three chapters and collected all of the
data I’ve discussed, it’s time to make some sense of your list by organizing it
in a SWOT format. Remember, the purpose of a SWOT is to help produce a
good fit between your company’s resources and capabilities and your exter-
nal environment.
Your SWOT analysis is a balance sheet of your strategic position right now. In
the analysis, you bring together all your internal factors, strengths, and weak-
nesses, as well as your external factors, opportunities, and threats. Strengths
and weaknesses are factors that you can control and affect. These are identi-
fied in Chapters 7 and 8. Opportunities and threats, which are identified in
this chapter, are outside of your control; you can either try to take advantage
of them or try to minimize them. Follow these steps to complete your SWOT
analysis grid:
1. Construct a grid with four quadrants.
See Figure 9-2 for help.
2. Review your list of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
you developed over the last three chapters.
Condense similar factors. Eliminate the ones that are nonessential. You
want to be able to see a clear picture of your strategic position. If there
are too many factors, it is impossible to draw any conclusions.
3. Place your company’s strengths and weaknesses in the left-hand boxes.
179
Chapter 9: Assessing Your Strategic Position in a Dynamic Environment

Make sure to include only the factors that are internal and controllable.
4. Place your opportunities and threats in the right-hand boxes.
Make sure to include only the factors that are external and out of your
direct control.
Before you move on, consider pulling in other people to get an objective 
perspective of your opportunities and threats. Here are a few approaches to
consider:
 Hold a SWOT meeting. Bring in your key employees and managers to
help you complete your SWOT. You can either facilitate the meeting by
asking them to think about the areas explained earlier in this chapter, or
you can have a free brainstorming session. At the end, get your groups
to come to a consensus as to what the top five strengths, weakness,
opportunities, and threats are. You can use this to guide your short-term
goal development for your strategic plan.
 Form a SWOT team. Pull together a group of employees and outsiders,
such as advisors or industry experts, to do a SWOT analysis. Ask this team
to pull in ideas not only through talking to co-workers but also to see what
you may be missing by assessing the competition and your industry.
 Go stealth. Not everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas in front of
a group, especially if the opinion isn’t a widely shared one. Develop a
Web-based survey, such as Zoomrang or Survey Monkey, with open-
ended questions about the strengths and weaknesses of your company.
Make sure that the survey is anonymous and that everyone knows it. I
do this with all my clients, and the information people provide is invalu-
able. You couldn’t pay a consultant enough to give you the same ideas.
A well-thought out SWOT helps you weigh factors against each other to deter-
mine what your company should do and when you should do it. In Part IV,
you take action on your SWOT analysis by developing goals and objectives
around your findings. In the meantime, if you want to take action now, here is
how to use your SWOT today:
 Build on your strengths.
 Shore up your weaknesses.
 Capitalize on your opportunities.
 Recognize your threats.
Change is the only constant in business. Therefore assessing your strategic
position is as dynamic as the environment you operate in. Know that your
SWOT just captures a moment in time, like your balance sheet. Take this tool
out every time you go into your strategic planning cycle. I promise, it never
gets rusty.

Moving Your

In this part . . . 
U
ndoubtedly (or at least I hope) opportunities for
your organization abound. More often than not, you
have more to do than you have time to do it. In order to
move your organization into the future, you need to select
the right opportunities and the right strategy to go with
them. In this part, you identify, evaluate, prioritize, and
execute against your opportunities. You determine how to
grow and establish your strategic priorities. I also provide
a chapter on finding new customers.

A
t the end of the day, what’s every business trying to do? Grow. More cus-
tomers, more sales, positive cash flow, larger deal sizes, higher volume,
more billable hours, justification for higher prices, and so on. Ask any hard-
working entrepreneur what he or she is working on and you’re bound to hear
a comment related to growth. Growth is why you’re in business — to build or
create something bigger than yourselves. Because if you’re not growing,
you’re shrinking.
With that said, you don’t want to focus on growth for growth’s sake because
growth is just the means to an end. Your desire to grow must match up with
your vision for your organization. Rapid growth, incremental growth, or main-
taining your current position require specific strategies.
In this chapter, you discover the different paths for growth strategies. You
understand how to travel in more than one direction to find partners and
acquire others. Lastly, you look at how to evaluate the different growth
strategies against each other to get a clear picture of your strategic choices.
Strategizing How to Grow
Successful growth stems from matching up your strengths and weaknesses
with the opportunities that exist in your business environment. Your growth
strategy is the way in which you position your company to exploit your

184
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 
strengths and opportunities and mitigate your weaknesses and threats. By
strategizing how to grow, you’re actively deciding how to connect your mis-
sion with your vision (see Chapter 6 for more on missions and visions). Your
growth strategy answers the question: How do we get there?
Keep these key points on growth in mind as you move through this chapter:
 Growth begins with your customers in mind.
 Growth focuses on opportunities.
 Growth looks forward by learning from the past.
 Everyone can grow.
Growth comes from either leveraging your market knowledge or leveraging
your product knowledge. Figure 10-1 illustrates how you can leverage your
market and/or product knowledge to create four different strategies:
 Market penetration
 Product development
 Market development
 Innovation
In Part III of this book, you identify your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats. If you’ve covered that information, use it to guide your strategy
selection in this chapter.

Market penetration
The most common growth strategy is to focus on what you do best by
emphasizing your current products in your current markets. This strategy is
also called the concentrated growth strategy because you’re thoroughly devel-
oping and exploiting your knowledge and expertise in a specific market with
known products.
How do you grow if you’re doing what you’re already doing now? Here’s how:
 Increase present customers’ rate of use: You achieve this goal by
• Increasing the size of purchase
• Maximizing the rate of product obsolescence
• Finding new uses for your product
• Advertising other uses
• Offering incentives for increased use
 Attracting your competitors’ customers: You lure customers away from
your competitors by establishing differentiation between yourself and
them, increasing advertising efforts, or cutting your prices. Look at
Chapter 5 to find ways to differentiate yourself from other companies.
 Attract nonusers to buy your products: This process can be done by
offering trial uses of your products, adjusting the price up or down, and
promoting other uses to attract these customers (check out the follow-
ing Example icon for details).
Think about Arm & Hammer Baking Soda. You could easily argue that it’s not
the most exciting product; in fact, it’s almost boring. Agree? It’s white powder
in a box, but the company dominates the market as the number one baking
soda for cooking year after year. But with such a large market share, you may
be wondering how the company grows by using its current products. It finds a
new use for an existing product. The company launched a year-long marketing
campaign promoting the use of baking soda as a refrigerator deodorizer, which
resulted in a 57 percent increase in sales! Arm & Hammer has not stopped
there. Check out the company’s Web site at http://armhammer.com for a
timeline of how it continues to reinvent uses for its core product.
Product development
If you have a good understanding of your market, another way to leverage
your knowledge is to develop new products and services to meet this
market’s needs. If you hear the term product development, you may think
185
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

about brand new products, but that’s not necessarily the case. Executing a
product development strategy can happen by adding more value to your
existing product through features, upselling, or cross selling. The best thing
about this strategy is you’ve already established yourself in your current
markets and you know what your customers want. You have the distribution
channels, and you know how to reach them.
Consider the following questions if you’re thinking about expanding your
product line or developing new products:
 Will your customer benefit from the added value or new feature? Are
they asking for additions to the current product line?
 Do potential manufacturing, marketing, and distribution cost efficiencies
exist from an expanded product line? Can you share current costs
across the new products or services?
 Can your current assets, brand, marketing, and distribution be used with
the new product?
 Do you have the skills and capabilities to develop and produce the prod-
ucts proposed?
After you’ve given product development some consideration, and you’ve
decided to proceed full steam ahead, here’s how to develop new products
and services to meet your market’s needs:
 Add new features or services by extending your current products. For
example, cell phone companies add on media packages for text messag-
ing, additional ring tones, and Internet access. Here are a few ways to
extend your current offering:
• Adapt (to other ideas and developments)
• Modify (change color, motion, sound, odor, form, shape)
• Magnify (more for a higher price, stronger, longer, extra value)
• Reduce (smaller, trial version, shorter, lighter)
• Substitute (other ingredients, processes, power)
• Combine (other options, products, ideas, assortments)
 Develop additional models and sizes of your current products. For
example, the iPod expanded to the iPod mini and the iPod nano.
 Develop totally new products. In this case, you usually leverage your
brand recognition. Some good examples of this development are Gerber
producing baby clothes and a CPA firm expanding from tax work into
financial planning.
186
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

Just because you’re successful with your current products in a market, doesn’t
guarantee success with new ones. The classic failed product development
strategy was New Coke, which Coke introduced in the ‘80s as a replacement 
for Coke. Coke assumed that its customers would gravitate toward a newly-
developed formula only to realize, too late, that its cola drinkers were fiercely
loyal to the traditional flavor. Needless to say, the new product fizzled.
Nowadays, it seems like Coke tries to introduce new products along with
existing products, even if they overlap (like Coke Zero and Diet Coke — both
diet sodas, but one isn’t replacing the other). The lesson here is don’t trash
what’s been working just fine when trying something new.
Market development
You can grow by leveraging your product knowledge to reach new customers.
More than likely, you have spent time and money developing your product
and service offering. Assuming you’re happy with your current offering,
extending it into new markets is a logical next step. This is aptly called a
market development strategy. If, in Chapter 9, you identified potential new
markets as opportunities, use these strategies to reach them.
Here are some quick considerations to make before executing a market devel-
opment strategy:
 Is the market attractive? (To really answer this question, I recommend
some form of market research to validate your gut feeling.)
 Are you willing to commit the required time and resources to reach this
new market?
 Can your business be adapted to the new market?
 Will you maintain your current competitive advantage in this new
market?
In the next two sections, I cover the two types of market development 
strategies.
Expanding geographically
When you’re thinking about expanding, first think about where you want to
cultivate new business. You have options: other regions, nationally, or interna-
tionally. Geographical expansion works well for a company that wants to
expand its service territory because it needs a physical location to serve its
customers. Clearly your ability to expand is subject to your ability to finance
such as expansion. See “Executing Your Growth Strategy” later in this chapter.
187
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

Many of the big boys of business, including McDonalds, Wal-Mart, and Home
Depot, have exported their operations to other countries. On a smaller scale,
many microbreweries have opened up new locations in various metro areas
and airports in the United States as a way to expand their geographical reach.
Reaching into new market segments
You can also grow by reaching a completely new set of customers or market
segments. This area is such a popular growth strategy because you leverage
the products and services you already have developed. (Flip to Chapter 11
for the entire story on new market segments.)
Examples of this strategy abound, such as Bayer aspirin now being sold not
just for aches and pains, but also for heart attack prevention if taken daily.
Something totally new
Sometimes you just need to bust out and try something new — like learning
the polka. Or if you are a tobacco firm, buying a packaged-food company; a
cola firm entering the water business; or a chemical company going into the
spa supply business. All these moves, except the polka of course, are exam-
ples of diversification. (The polka would be diversifying your dance portfolio,
but that’s another book all together.) Diversification is entering new markets
with new products. Refer back to Figure 10-1 for how this strategy relates to
the others.
You can also refer to diversification as innovation. Many companies appreci-
ate the need to be innovative, but few use it as a way of relating to their mar-
kets. Fundamentally, this strategy is about creating new products, with new
product life cycles, making the existing ones obsolete. By doing so, firms
launch new products that are developed not just for current customers but
for new ones, too.
To execute this strategy, you usually manage a merger, an acquisition, or a
completely new business venture. See “Executing Your Growth Strategy” later
in this chapter. Well known, highly innovative companies include Intel,
Google, DuPont, and all of the pharmaceutical companies.
A company’s diversification strategy can be either related or unrelated to
their original business. Related diversification seems to make more sense than
unrelated because the company isn’t sharing assets, skills, or capabilities.
But there are many successful companies such as Tyco and GE that continue
to buy unrelated businesses.
188
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

Check out the next two sections for more information. Figure 10-2 also sum-
marizes the reasons for related and unrelated diversification.
Related diversification
In related diversification, there’s a strategic fit between the new venture and
the existing company. You capitalize on the strengths or competitive advan-
tage you’ve already established to make this strategy work.
Richard Branson, famous for his company Virgin, has more than 300 compa-
nies that carry the Virgin name: Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Mobile, and Virgin
Galactic — his most recent venture into space travel — are just a few exam-
ples. This related diversification strategy works because all the companies
share the brand, marketing, public relations, and corporate knowledge.
Unrelated diversification
Unrelated diversification has nothing to do with leveraging your current busi-
ness strengths or weaknesses. It’s more about not putting all your eggs in one
basket. For example, an investor diversifying his financial portfolio to protect
against losses. Many entrepreneurs execute this strategy unknowingly by
becoming involved in multiple, unrelated businesses.
Hypothetically, say the owner of a local IT consulting company also decided
to take over a failing sandwich shop because he always wanted to be in the
restaurant business. Clearly these two businesses are unrelated. But by acci-
dent, the business owner is executing a diversification strategy. He is now in
the IT industry and the dining industry.
Sharing skills and competencies
Leveraging a brand name
Using a shared marketing skills and knowledge
Using sales and distribution capacity
Exchanging manufacturing skills and know-how
Access to research and development and new
product capabilities
Realizing economies of scale
Interest to the owner or executives
Reducing risk by operating in various markets
and product lines

Executing Your Growth Strategy
The preceding section lays out different growth strategies. Now you need to
evaluate which path you want to take. But in order to choose a path, you
must also decide how to execute the strategy.
By matching up your growth strategies with your strengths, weaknesses, and
opportunities, you can determine which ones to pursue. The next sections
cover the pros and cons of doing it yourself, developing partners, and grow-
ing through others.
Going it alone
The most obvious and straightforward approach to implementing your
growth strategy is doing it yourself. Most of the time, companies choose to
190
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 
Growing up (and down)
Another potential way to grow is through verti-
cal integration — moving up and down your
supply chain. You can integrate forward by set-
ting up operations closer to your customer, such
as a clothing company opening up retail stores.
Or you can integrate backward, moving closer
to your raw material source such as the clothing
company opening a manufacturing plant.
Although these strategies are less common that
the others, they do have some benefits:
 Direct access to supply and demand:
Eliminating the middleman in both direc-
tions is forward and backward integration.
Getting direct access to your vendors and
customers can be a huge benefit for many
businesses.
For example, many of the auto manufactur-
ers moved forward by investing in the big car
rental firms. Many companies seek back-
ward integration because there is no source
for a component they need. For example,
when refrigerated warehouses were
needed by meat packers, they built them.
 Better control over the quality or availabil-
ity of the product or service. Many times,
manufacturers need specialized raw mate-
rial that is a key component in the end prod-
uct. To gain better quality control and
eliminate the risk of not being able to
acquire the product, the company buys the
vendor. This is backward integration.
So Sony could guarantee content for its
products, 
the 
company 
purchased
Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures, and
CBS Records.
 Entry into a potentially attractive business
area.
Manufacturers continually fight
margin pressures. The best way to get con-
trol is to go directly to customers instead of
through retailers, also known as forward
integration.
Companies like Nike have been successful
in this area, whereas a company such as
Universal Pictures hasn’t.

enter new markets or develop new products by providing the necessary capi-
tal, equipment, people, and other assets themselves to get the job done. But
choices come with consequences — in this case, list your pros and cons.
The pros of doing it yourself can include
 Having more control: You hold all the strings in this scenario. You don’t
have to wait for the other company to make decisions or take actions.
 Reaping greater rewards: All the revenue and profit is kept in your 
business.
 Saving more money: You realize all of the cost savings through
economies of scale (spreading costs out across products and services)
and shared resources (sharing assets across product and service lines).
Going it alone also comes with some drawbacks:
 Limited resources: Everyone has limited time and money, which
restricts the number of strategies that can be pursued at the same time
 Lack of skills: You may not have the skills and capabilities within your
company to execute the strategy successfully.
 Greater risk: Of course, with all the rewards, comes all the risk. Your
neck is on the line if your strategy bombs.
More than likely, doing it yourself may come down to the money. You aren’t
able to finance the entire endeavor on your own. If you want some sugges-
tions on how to help pay for growth, flip to Chapter 14. You can also check
out Raising Capital For Dummies (Wiley) by Joseph W. Bartlett and Peter
Economy (yeah, that’s really his last name!).
Video Gaming Technologies (VGT), named the fastest growing small company
by Inc. Magazine in 2005, made it to the top through its own business model
and focusing on a single market. VGT produces touchscreen gaming machines
and leases them to Indian casinos in Oklahoma. Yep, just Oklahoma. Since
landing its first games in casinos in 2001, the company’s growth has skyrock-
eted to a total of 9,720 percent, nearly reaching $100 million in revenue in
2004. VGT has captured 30 percent of the Oklahoma market and plans to con-
tinue its growth by taking its products to China and South America.
Playing well with others: 
Developing partners
As you evaluate the different growth options against your resources, you may
discover that you come up short – like the money. You have the vision, but
you don’t have what it takes to get the job done. That’s when you should
check out strategic partnerships as a growth option.
191
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

Strategic partnerships are also known as strategic alliances, joint ventures,
licensing, franchising, and private labeling, and I use the terms interchange-
ably. In this section, I use the words strategic partnership to mean any type of
agreement that results in a synergy between two cooperating organizations
resulting in the sum of their efforts being greater than the parts.
Alliances between companies are incredibly popular in today’s business cli-
mate because, when done correctly, they enable you to take advantage of
more market opportunities. Alliances require less capital, are more respon-
sive to the market, and spread the associated risks.
A Booz Allen Hamilton study provides CEOs with statistics that can’t be
ignored:
 For nearly ten years, strategic alliances of the world’s top 2,000 compa-
nies have consistently produced an average annual return on investment
of nearly 17 percent. This is a 50 percent higher ROI than their non-
alliance activities produce.
 The percentage of annual revenue that the 1,000 largest U.S. companies
earned from alliances grew to 35 percent by 2002.
A strategic partnership allows both organizations to realize their respective
growth goals while sharing resources and profits from success. The key is
leveraging your own company’s strengths while shoring up your weaknesses
with your partner’s strength.
Identifying the types of strategic partnerships
Strategic partnerships come in as many flavors and colors as there are busi-
nesses in this world: Some are conventional and unconventional; some strate-
gic, some transactional; some done on a hand shake and others with
a100-page contract.
To make sense of the variety of strategic partner arrangements, see Figure 10-3.
Notice the vertical continuum represents the length of the commitment — from
shorter term to longer term — between the partners. The horizontal contin-

Knowing when to buddy up
The value of a strategic partnership lies in the growth it offers companies
who are strong in one area but not another. In other words, partnerships
must be mutually beneficial. But how do you know when to consider partner-
ing as a viable growth option? Explore the following reasons for joining forces

Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

 Increased market reach: Through partners, you can expand your
market reach by selling your products and services into their markets.
You can also realize broader geographic expansion.
 Faster product development: By combining forces, partners can share
areas of expertise, defray the typically high costs of product research
and development, improve quality, and hopefully realize a higher return.
 Purchased access to a customer base: Your partner may have customer
relationships with larger accounts you’re seeking access to.
 Facilitated international trade: Partnering opens up new markets and
export opportunities on a global scale. Inexperienced partners can
quickly gain knowledge, skills, and sales expertise of an experienced
export partner.
 Gained access to needed technology: You may be able to gain quicker
and faster access to technology than if you built it yourself.
 Enhanced purchasing power: Partnering with other firms to purchase
raw materials, distribution, and other goods and services can result in
substantial savings for an individual organization because you buy
larger volumes and can negotiate better prices. Typically, the more you
buy, the better the price.
 Shared marketing: Partnering to pool market research knowledge, cus-
tomer databases, campaign dollars, and other promotional expenses can
be a huge reduction in expenses for businesses. The key is to partner
with a company that truly meets the needs of your customer base. (See
“Determining who to buddy up with” later in the chapter).
 Shared logistics, distribution, and operations: Economies of scale can
be realized if two companies partner to coordinate product management
from contract to delivery.
 Shared administrative/human resources: This area is slightly more dif-
ficult to share, but it’s possible. Human resource knowledge, expertise,
and even staff can be shared because as the labor shortage grows, this
may become a competitive advantage for those companies that can
effectively share human resources.
The main rationale for setting up a strategic partnership is that by sharing
resources, you can execute your plans more quickly, cheaply, and with better
quality.
Defining how to buddy up: The Partnership Criteria Sheet
If you’ve decided that partnering is the way you want to achieve your growth
(or part of your plan), you need to define clearly what the partnership looks
like and how you will go about structuring it. With as many details as possi-
ble, put together a one-sheet document, called a Partnership Criteria Sheet,
that answers the following questions:
194
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

 What is the goal of the partnership for your company? (See the list of
reasons to set up a partnership in the previous section.)
 Will a partnership fill a goal better than in-house development or 
acquisition?
 What type of partnership are you looking for? What length of time and
what level of shared resources? (Refer back to Figure 10-3 if needed.)
 What resources does the partnership require? Is your business able and
willing to deliver those resources?
 What resources does the partner need to deliver?
 How should you divide partnership ownership? (Who owns what?)
 What value do the partnership’s proposed products or services bring to
your customers?
 How will the partnership be measured and how will it be managed?
 What are the specific revenue goals or cost savings you expect to realize?
Use the Partnership Criteria Sheet to help you evaluate potential partners as
well as develop the deal when it comes time. The sheet helps you and your
team focus on putting together the right partnership for the right reasons.
Determining who to buddy up with
Chances are, you already have a general idea of who you should be partner-
ing with. The best candidates are those whose assets, experience, customer
base, and distribution best support your weaknesses.
Start by looking at your supply chain — from development all the way to the
end user, and especially the businesses involved in transporting your prod-
uct to market. Also look at other companies that reach the same market you
do or markets that you want to tap into.
After scanning the possibilities, come up with a list of three or four likely can-
didates that meet the criteria listed on your Partnership Criteria Sheet. And
then follow these steps:
1. Do your homework.
What are the candidate organization’s key strengths, market position,
and financial status? Try to find out how this organization has behaved
in the past toward vendors, customers, and in alliances with other orga-
nizations. A great place to start is the Dun and Bradstreet directory of
businesses (http://dnb.com).
195
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

2. Estimate the profitability of the partnership.
Determine if the estimated partnership profits justify the investment in
developing the alliance. Put together a small financial projection of just
this partnership. See Chapter 13 for guidance on how to put together
projections.
If you’re unprepared or lack initiative — no matter how good the potential
partner or deal — a strategic partnership can blow up, wasting everyone’s
time and resources. Before you seal any deals with your new partner, make
sure to avoid the hidden pitfalls of partnerships:
 Lack of trust between the two parties
 Moving too fast into the agreement
 Lack of buy-in from senior management in both organizations
 Failure by one or both partners to clearly articulate the alliance’s “value
proposition” to managers or employees
 Failure to define who owns what
 Getting bogged down in bureaucracy in one of the two companies
 Lack of consistent, regular communication
 Failure to establish the exit clause before the partnership starts making
money or goes south
Combining forces: Mergers 
and acquisitions
A popular and legitimate growth strategy is through a merger or acquisition.
A merger is combining two separate businesses into a single new business,
whereas an acquisition occurs when one company purchases the assets and
majority ownership of the other company. According to Securities Data
Corporation, mergers and acquisitions (M&As) grew 15 percent from 2004
to 2005.
Seasoned business folks say that true mergers don’t exist. In nearly every sit-
uation, there’s an acquirer and an acquiree, where the acquirer maintains
majority control. See Figure 10-3 for a visual on how M&As relate to the part-
nering continuum. Because this is a large topic, I only provide key considera-
tions about M&As as a growth option. Therefore, we only look at the deal
from the acquiring company side.
196
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

Although M&As are growing in popularity, so is their failure rate. According
to Mastering the Merger: Four Critical Decisions that Make or Break the Deal by
David Harding and Sam Rovit, 60 to 70 percent of acquisitions fail. To make
matters worse, about 90 percent of all acquired businesses lose market
share. Given the high failure rate, it’s imperative that all of your i’s are dotted
and t’s are crossed and double-checked before making an acquisition.
Keeping your motivations clear
What makes a good acquisition deal? At the end of the day, a good acquisi-
tion improves your income statement and balance sheet within two to three
years. If you think it may take longer, you don’t have a good deal.
197
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore
Partnering through franchising
Franchising is exploding in popularity as a way
to grow your business potential very quickly.
Franchising is a partnership of sorts between
the two parties because they’re sharing assets
for a mutually beneficial outcome. You can
license your intellectual property to wanna-be
business owners in exchange for their cash in
the form of a franchise fee. The benefit to the
franchisor is to expand through quick access to
capital and human resources. The benefit to the
franchisee is the ability to buy a proven busi-
ness model with no time or money needed for
research and development.
Want a good example of franchising? Great
Harvest Bakery has successfully opened 206
franchises nationwide with an unusually loose
model. The company encourages entrepre-
neurial spirit and open communication between
storeowners, who enjoy the freedom to run their
businesses their way. In fact, the Uniform
Franchise Offering reads: “Anything not
expressly prohibited is allowed.” Because the
company is privately held, financial information
isn’t available, but its continued growth, with 13
stores expected to open this year, is an indica-
tor that the company developed a very suc-
cessful partnership model.
Wonder why you wouldn’t want to franchise?
Check out Jamba Juice, the maker of fruit-juice
smoothies. They backed away from franchising
as a growth strategy specifically because of the
inability to control product quality. At the time
the company was making the critical decision
about how to grow, founder Kirk Perron decided
that consistency in location, store design, in-
store merchandise, and smoothie ingredients
was what would lure repeat customers. By fran-
chising, Jamba Juice didn’t have the ability to
monitor the quality so important to the com-
pany’s distinctiveness. Opening wholly-owned
stores funded by a handful of big name venture
capitalist proved a winning strategy for the
company. The company now has 500 stores
nationwide with net sales of $300 million in 2005.

Before making any M&A deals, ask yourself the following questions (if you
can’t answer yes to all of them, you’re not likely to grow):
 Will the acquisition increase profit?
 Will the acquisition improve the balance sheet?
 Is the risk level acceptable for all stakeholders?
It’s easy to lose sight of the end goal by getting caught up in the trivial details
of the deal. Ultimately closing the deal is only half the battle. A successful
acquisition yields the returns you anticipated on purchase. Not until you real-
ize those profits can you say your acquisition was successful.
Weighing the pros and cons
If M&As were never successful, they wouldn’t be so popular. Clearly there are
plenty of companies acquiring successfully, so pros do exist in mergers and
acquisitions. Here are a few:
 Expanding your markets: Overnight you can acquire new products, ser-
vices, and customers for your current lines of business in your same
market or even new markets. Additionally, you may acquire new distrib-
ution channels and vendor relationships.
Oracle’s $10 billion buyout of PeopleSoft yielded new customers, 
services, and thousands of new distribution outlets for the high-tech
company.
 Acquiring people, systems, technology, equipment, intellectual prop-
erty, or processes: If you can’t build it, buy it. A huge benefit to an
acquisition is the rapid ability to have new operations up and running
quickly.
 Acquisitions may also improve your economies of scale: Microsoft and
Google continually purchase smaller companies as a way to expand
their product portfolios and spread their assets out over more revenue
sources.
 Reducing expenses: You can generate more money with less overhead
when you trim out some of the excess details.
Any of the auto manufacturers’ mergers, such Ford’s purchase of Volvo,
are an example of reducing expenses through an acquisition.
 Eliminating competition: If you can’t beat them, buy them.
HP’s purchase of Compaq is a good example.
198
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

Oh, did you really think that I would have a pros list without the cons?
Following right behind the list of pros are the cons:
 Having a cultural mismatch: Don’t underestimate the importance of 
cultural harmony. Shared beliefs, values, goals, and business models
ensure the culture is complementary to yours.
 Overvaluing expense savings: Many companies think they can signifi-
cantly decrease expenses by consolidating functions like sales, adminis-
tration, and service into one location. However, your acquiree’s
competitive advantage may well be a function of these field functions.
If you go through with the consolidation, you risk losing that benefit.
 Misreading your customers: Will your customers really buy the prod-
ucts or services you assume are complementary to your own? Do they
need or want the acquiree’s products or services? If you misunderstand
your customers, you may end up with two completely different cus-
tomer groups and unrelated product lines — an expensive and unwieldy
proposition.
 Underestimating customer retention: Any time you acquire, you’re
likely to lose some of the acquiree’s customers. Don’t automatically
assume that sales will continue at the same level after the purchase as
they were before it.
 Misreading the company: You’re trying to understand the operations of
a business that’s been around for 10 or 20 years (or more or less) in a
matter of a few weeks or months. Even when you buy a company similar
to yours, you can never know everything about it before you make your
decision.
Using M&As to grow
Ultimately, the primary reason for considering an acquisition is the desire
or need for quick and substantial growth. No matter what the secondary 
reasons — expanding into another geographical area, acquiring systems and
assets, or obtaining new products or new distribution channels — M&As still
comes down speed. If you want to grow incrementally, an M&A isn’t for you.
To determine whether an M&A may help you realize your growth goals,
answer these three questions:
 What are the different ways you could grow your business?
 Is an acquisition the best way to achieve that growth? Do any of the
other alternatives meet your needs? (Check out “Playing well with
others: Developing partners,” for more info on alternatives.)
 What other strategic goals will the acquisition help you accomplish?
199
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

Improve your chances of success by integrating these tips into your acquisition
strategy:
 Understand how you reach the goal of your M&A. Figure out what part
of the M&A drives the growth you’re looking for. Different areas such as
customers, costs, and processes can all be factors. If you haven’t
defined your goals, you can’t begin to execute an effective acquisition
campaign.
 Never risk the stability of your company on the acquisition. Make sure
that you’re never risking more than you can afford to lose if the pur-
chase doesn’t work out.
 Only buy profitable companies. Sick companies are almost always
more difficult to fix than expected. Of course, companies that have obvi-
ous areas for improvement that you can pinpoint are perfect acquisition
targets.
 Don’t set your acquisition strategy up to fail. Put your best people in
charge and fund it accordingly.
200
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 
Outsourcing your outsourcing
Outsourcing is here to stay because of the
numerous environmental pressures companies
are dealing with. Basically, why keep non-core
functions in-house when you can get them
cheaper overseas? The problems arise when
companies have tried to put this into practice.
It’s not as easy as it sounds, so outsourcing bro-
kers and consultants should be used. This new
crop of companies is helping organizations of all
types locate, contract, and manage their out-
sourced projects.
For example, Business Health Services needed
to either cut costs or cut jobs. One area for cost
cutting was reducing its costs to transcribe
doctor’s notes and other medical documents. At
the time, the company was paying 16 cents a
word, but through the help of an outsourcing
broker, it was able to locate a vendor in India
who would do it for 11 cents. Add on the 25 per-
cent premium that the broker gets, and the com-
pany now only pays 11.5 cents a word — a
$7,000 per month savings.
Is outsourcing in your future? Here are some
guidelines to determine whether outsourcing is
the right move for your company:
 You need a higher level of expertise than
you currently have, or you only need that
expertise periodically.
 You have a set of activities or functions that
need rapid change.
 Departments or functions are performing
subpar when compared to others in your
company.
 Outsourcing is cheaper without a decrease
in quality.
 You need better performance but lack the
resources to do it yourself.
 You have a non-core area that’s giving you
a headache.
Check out the National Association of Software
and Service Companies (www.nasscom.org),
India’s trade group, for help with outsourcing.

In 2004, FedEx purchased Kinko’s for $2.4 billion with its main goal of attract-
ing more customers in smaller and mid-sized companies as well as fending off
competitors. The 1,200 Kinko’s stores give FedEx a direct line into business-
people who work out of their home or own small businesses. FedEx can also
target on-the-road employees. Additionally, the acquisition provides a much
stronger distribution channel than FedEx had previously.
Evaluating What Path to Take
If you’ve read through most of this chapter and are now familiar with the dif-
ferent growth strategies and the approaches to implementing them, now it’s
time to figure out what to do and how to do it.
The best way to visually see your strategic choices is by creating a
Product/Market Grid. By developing this grid, you can prioritize and sort
your options. See Figure 10-4 for help in developing your grid, and then follow
these steps:
1. In Excel or Word, create a table that lists all your current and poten-
tial products down the left-hand column and all your current and pro-
posed markets across the top.
Refer Figure 10-4 for an example of the layout.
2. Estimate the demand for your current and new products in each of
the markets by filling in the cells different shades of grey.
For example, if there’s a potential high demand for the product, shade
the cell dark gray. If there’s low demand, fill the cell with light grey.
3. Based on your demand estimations, select your growth strategy.
Look at whether you’re leveraging your product or your market knowl-
edge in each market. For example, in the column titled Current Market #1,
there’s high demand for the two current products and one new one. To
increase sales for the new product, the company will continue to serve
the market by executing a product development strategy.
4. Decide how to execute the growth strategy.
You need to base this decision on your knowledge and judgment of the
resources you have to execute each strategy. Will you do it yourself, find
a partner, or acquire a business? (See previous sections in this chapter
on these endeavors.)
5. Prioritize each group based on which is the best opportunity for your
company.
Use this information to guide the development of your Customer Goals
and Objectives in Chapter 13.
201
Chapter 10: Growth: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore

Basing your project demand on market research and past sales is the best
way to construct this grid. Because this isn’t always available, do your best
to fill in the grid because it provides you with a good idea of how likely one
strategy is compared to the others. If you have the time, jump online, talk to
your sales people, or hire a market research firm to get the real data to fill in
your Product/Market Grid.
Keep your Product/Market Grid handy. You use it again in Chapter 13 to
develop your goals and objectives in your strategic plan.

Chapter 11
Finding New Customers
In This Chapter
 Investigating new customer markets and picking the best ones
 Writing position statements
 Keeping a focus on the market
 Deciding how to reach your new customers
E
very business wants to find new customers. It’s like asking if you want to
make more money. Of course you do! There are two ways to grow your
top line: Increase sales from your existing customers (see Chapter 8) or gen-
erate sales from new ones (this chapter).
Finding new customers is the role of marketing. When you sift through all the
semantics, misused business lingo, and fuzzy concepts, marketing is really
pretty simple: Identify who you want to sell to; figure out how to get those
people to notice you; and when they do, get them to buy from you. If it is this
simple, why does marketing continue to be confusing? Mainly because most
people make it too complicated. At the end of the day, nothing matters until
there’s a sale. And the only person who can make that decision is the cus-
tomer. As management guru Peter Drucker says, “The purpose of a business
is to create a customer.” Period.
The primary reason marketing campaigns fail is because customers weren’t
offered something they wanted, needed, or valued. The components of a 
campaign — your product, its price, the advertising, sales channels, your
salespeople, customer service — can contribute to the failure. But ultimately,
the problem comes down to the fact that the customer wasn’t satisfied.
This chapter focuses on marketing planning elements, which are part of your
strategic plan. Additionally, the chapter helps you create a market-focused
organization. In Chapter 10, you may have selected either market develop-
ment or market penetration as potential growth strategies. If so, implement-
ing either of these requires reaching new markets. This chapter also explains
how to give those strategies life.

Researching New Markets
Good market research ensures that you don’t spend a lot of money on mar-
keting campaigns that customers don’t jibe with or new products that they
won’t pay for. To be effective, organizations need good information about
their customers’ needs, wants, and characteristics. Generally, if the result of
your decision impacts the customer, you should ask the customer for input
into your decision before you make it.
Market research is an entire discipline, which is too overwhelming to cover in
depth here. Instead, this section focuses on how to conduct market research
for the purpose of making strategic decisions about which target markets to
enter. Those markets result in actions within your strategic plan.
Identifying your information needs
Before beginning any research effort, clearly state your information needs.
Undoubtedly there may be some holes and unknowns about new markets you
want to pursue, but you also want to have a better idea of how attractive the
potential target market is and if it identifies with the need you’re trying to solve.
Ask yourself the following questions about each market you’re considering:
 What market am I trying to serve? How big is my market in terms of
number of customers, units sold, or dollar volume?
 Are there obvious segments in my market?
 What are the overall trends and developments in my industry?
 What is the rate of market growth or shrinkage over time? Are there any
differences in market growth by time of year?
 How big are my competitors? What companies have what portions of the
market?
 What products or services do my competitors offer? How do they differ
from mine?
 How does competitors’ pricing compare with mine?
 What marketing strategies and tactics does the competition use and to
what degree of success?
 What are the key factors for success in the market I’m trying to serve?
Are there any specific media outlets that reach this market directly?
 How do customers perceive the problem the offering is intended to
solve? How serious do they believe the problem is? What benefits of the
proposed offering would be of most importance to them?
204
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

 How do customers solve the problem today?
 What costs do customers incur now to solve the problem?
It’s a pretty long list, I know. But don’t feel overwhelmed. You don’t need to
answer all these questions. Just focus on these key steps in processing your
answers:
1. Use the questions listed above to help identify what specific informa-
tion you need about potential new markets.
2. Then clearly state these needs in one or two objectives.
3. Use these objectives to guide your research efforts.
4. If the information you locate doesn’t achieve the stated objectives, file
that info somewhere else or delete it.
Locating information sources
You know your information needs, but now you’ve got to go out and find the
answers.
Doing market research can be like pulling on a never-ending spool of thread.
Sometimes you reach the end of your search and sometimes you don’t. At
some point you need to decide if you’ve collected enough information to
make a strategic decision about which markets to pursue. Weigh the cost of
perfect information against the risk of a less-than-perfect decision.
The following subsections provide a list of potential sources. I admit that the
sources aren’t exhaustive, but I do cover the most popular research sources
available. Some of the sources are free, while others are quite expensive. I
always evaluate the cost of research against the “cost” of decision. Or, in
other words, how much insurance do you need or want to buy?
Internal company information
You may be amazed how much information you have stored in your company
databases, customer relationship management systems, employees, vendors,
and distributors. Before you spend any time surfing databases or spend any
money on a research study, start with your internal company information.
Look for data that answers the questions in the earlier section “Identifying
your information needs.”
Secondary data
Information or data that’s already compiled, such as reports, statistics, and
white papers, is considered secondary data. To get a general understanding of
the market and to begin to develop customer profiles, you can easily tap into
secondary sources. Here is a list of some of the best:

Want to get more specific in your secondary research efforts? The University
of California Berkley Library publishes a guide entitled Finding Information on
the Internet: A Tutorial. Check out this free resource at www.lib.berkeley.
edu/TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/Strategies.html.
Primary data
If you have a specific research question, want to evaluate a specific need, or
want test market a product, you may need to go directly to the information
source: your customer. This research is called primary research. You may also
need to conduct primary research if you can’t locate a critical piece of infor-
mation through secondary sources. Primary research includes surveys via
e-mail, phone, direct mail, in-depth interviews, focus groups, usability testing,
and direct observation.
You can conduct primary research yourself or hire an outside market research
agency. Check out the GreenBook directory — www.greenbook.org — for a
list of market research agencies.
Defining Your Target Markets
Think about your market as if you’re someone who’s interested in buying
your product or service. You might have some luck reaching some of them
with a widespread approach. But wouldn’t a more targeted approach be more
effective? In order to use this approach, you have to aim at a clear target,
which is your ideal market. To create a target, you need to be able to take a
sea of customers and group, or segment, them. You can do this by creating
groups of customers based on similarities. This is a target market.
The goal of creating target markets is targeting specific customers that have
similar needs and wants with the same message, products, and pricing and
through the same distribution channels. When done correctly, your target
market responds similarly to your marketing efforts.
Here is an example. Look at two 24-Hour Fitness customers:
Tim is a health nut. Working out is his life. He typically uses the facilities
five times a week. He’s on a program established by his personal trainer
and has referred two people to the gym this year already.
Sheila, on the other hand, hasn’t set foot in the gym since she joined six

Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

Membership renewal fees for both Tim and Sheila are due next month. If
24-Hour Fitness uses the same strategy to encourage Tim and Sheila to
renew, their tactics may fail. Tim already understands the value and is a
satisfied customer. However, Sheila needs substantially more communica-
tion to see the benefit. The company may likely lose her.
Clearly, utilizing the same marketing campaign in the examples above causes
a decrease in potential sales and profitability. The same is true with your
approaches in the real world. Therefore, a more targeted approach to sales
and marketing is needed. In the following sections, I show you how to take
that approach.
Dividing up your market into groups
What’s the best way to divide your large customer base? Find a variable that
splits the market into actionable groups.
Most companies first make a product, then figure out who to sell it to. The
focus is on the product and not on what the customer wants to buy. By flip-
ping your thinking around, you first look at what customer needs you’re
trying to satisfy, and then which products fit that need. This process helps
isolate customer groups and make educated decisions on which segments
offer the most attractive opportunities.
Choosing a variable or a base is like selecting what type of knife to use when
preparing dinner. A serrated knife is preferable for cutting bread; a paring
knife for halving cherry tomatoes; and a chef’s knife for dicing an onion. They
each have their own specialty. Different knives produce different results. The
knife is analogous to the segmentation variable, not the segment itself. You
slice and dice markets by using different variables until you come up with the
segmentation of your customers that makes the most sense. For example,
you can segment a consumer market by product/service benefits sought,
demographic variables, geographic variables, psychographic variables, or
behavioral variables. But you can’t use all of them at the same time, or you’ll
end up with a market of one.
Segmenting can be confusing and more difficult than it needs to be.
Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to segment your market. It requires
creativity. Take a shot at creating segments that makes sense to you and your
business situation. You can always revise your segments at a later date.
The following two sections describe your selection process.
Benefits
Benefit segmentation is based on dividing customers based on their needs.
This process is also called needs-based segmentation. Simply put, you’re
208
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

trying to solve a need for a customer. Why not group all of the customers that
have the same need together?
Some marketers argue that this is the only way to segment a market because
people differ only when it comes to paying you for your product based on the
benefits your product provides. However, this type of segmentation may not
work for your organization, or it may not be as straightforward. Researching
your market (check out the info in “Researching New Markets” in this chapter
for help) can provide some insight on how you can segment based on benefits.
Netflix, an online, home-delivery DVD rental service, divides its customers
into three groups based on needs. Group one needs the convenience pro-
vided by free home delivery. Group two consists of film buffs who want to be
able to access any movie possible. Group three wants the benefit of cheap
rentals. They are the bargain hunters who want to watch a bunch of movies
for less than $20 per month.
Descriptors
Descriptors are customer characteristics that are significant enough to divide
your market. You don’t use all the descriptors together, but you may use one
or two together from the list below:
 Demographic: Grouping customers by age, income level, gender, family
size, religion, race, nationality, primary language, and so on.
 Geographic: Grouping customers by area such as regions of the country
or state and urban/rural.
 Psychographic: Grouping customers into cultural clusters, social sets,
lifestyle, and personality type.
 Decision makers: Grouping customers based on who decides to pur-
chase your product.
 Behavioral: Grouping customers by product usage (light, medium,
heavy users), brand loyalty (none, medium, high), and type of user.
 Distribution: Grouping customers based on where they go to purchase
your product such as in-store, online, or through the catalog.
E*Trade, an online brokerage and bank company, segments its markets in
two ways:
 The company looked at behavioral descriptors such as usage. It found a
large customer segment of day traders who wanted inexpensive and fast
trades. E*Trade developed quick-trade products and bulk pricing to
serve this market.
 The company looked at demographic descriptors, specifically income.
Through market research, the company discovered that the group of
people with $5,000 to $50,000 to invest was a fast growing segment that
was underserved.
209
Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

Through these descriptors E*Trade developed tools to enable the company
to profitably serve these customers.
Begin a new notes page for each target customer segment. You may have just
a few or you may have a lot. Don’t worry about that for now: You can refine
your list later. Give each customer group a name and use this to label your
page. Then write down the segmentation base. Did you segment by needs?
What is the need? If you segmented by descriptors, what were they? Use
Figure 11-3 as a guide to guide your notes page structure as you work through
the rest of this chapter.
Visualizing your target customer
To visual your ideal customer you want to create a customer profile or
detailed description of your target customer. Specifically, you want your pro-
file to be so descriptive that you can visualize shaking your customer’s hand.
To do this, you need to know your customers’ characteristics because know-
ing them is beneficial in developing consumer customer profiles. Be inter-
ested in their likes, dislikes, needs, wants, birthdays, anniversaries, styles,
titles, beliefs, behaviors, perspectives, politics, dreams, shoe size . . . and the
list goes on. (Okay, I was just kidding about shoe size.)
Check out this list of generic consumer and business characteristics:
 Consumer characteristics
• Demographics: Age, generation, gender, income, family size, life
cycle, occupation, education, religion, race, ethnicity, social class,
health
• Geographic: World region, county, state, city, climate, density
• Lifestyle: Innovators, thinkers, achievers, experiencers, believers,
strivers, makers, survivors
• Personality: Compulsive, gregarious, authoritarian, ambitious
• Usage: Occasions, benefits sought, user status, usage rate, loyalty
status
 Business characteristics
• Demographic: Industry, company size, location
• Environmental: Economic developments, supply conditions, tech-
nological change, political and regulatory developments, competi-
tive developments, culture and customs
210
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

• Purchasing approaches: Location of the purchasing function, deci-
sion making structure, nature of existing relationships, general pur-
chasing and payment policies, purchasing criteria
• Situational factors: Sense of urgency, need product/service for a
specific application, potential size of order
• Personal characteristics: Buyer-seller similarity, attitudes toward
risk, loyalty
Create a customer profile that requires you visualize your customers with 
100 percent clarity. Table 11-1 presents examples of good and bad customer
profiles.

For each one of your target customer groups, begin to list their needs and
wants. Think about behaviors, motivations, and potential benefits sought.
Then begin to list characteristics. If you have a consumer product or service,
the major types of characteristics are demographic, geographic, lifestyle, and
usage. If you have a business-to-business product or service, the major types
of characteristics are demographic, environmental, operating variables, pur-
chasing approaches, situational factors, and personal characteristics. If you
have specific companies that you’re targeting, write down their names and
main contact information.
More than likely, you need to obtain additional information about these target
customer groups in order to complete your profile. If so, use the profiles to
guide your market research efforts, as explained in the previous section.

Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

Targeting the Most Attractive Markets
Choosing which target markets to pursue can be challenging because you
may want to target all segments, especially those that are growing and
appear very profitable, but resist the temptation. Most businesses can’t pos-
sibly serve all identified target markets (or at least not well). Try to choose
between one and three new markets to target at any given time.
Additionally, you want to make sure that your company doesn’t enter into
segments that you can’t support or don’t have the resources to provide
excellent customer service. You want to focus your energies on the most
attractive segments.
212
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 
The best example: Anthropologie, 
a nationwide retail store
“A female about 30 to 45 years old, college or
post-graduate education, married with kids or
in a committed relationship, professional or ex-
professional, annual household income of
$150,000 to $200,000. She’s well-read and well-
traveled. She’s very aware — she gets our ref-
erences, whether it’s to a town in Europe or to a
book or a movie. She’s urban-minded. She’s into
cooking, gardening, and wine. She has a natural
curiosity about the world. She’s relatively fit. Her
identity is a tangle of connections to activities,
places, interests, values, and aspirations. She’s
a yoga-practicing filmmaker with an organic
garden, a collection of antique musical instru-
ments, and an abiding interest in Chinese culture.
The Anthropologie customer is affluent but not
materialistic. She’s focused on building a nest
but hankers for exotic travel. She’d like to be a
domestic but has no problem cutting corners
(she prefers the luscious excess of British cook-
ing sensation Nigella Lawson to the measured
perfection of Martha Stewart). She’s in tune with
trends, but she’s a confident individualist when it
comes to style. She lives in the suburbs but
would never consider herself a suburbanite.”
Can you visualize Anthropologie’s customers?
Without a doubt! Now don’t worry if your cus-
tomer profile isn’t this specific. In fact, it proba-
bly won’t be. Not everyone in this company’s
market exhibits all of these traits; that would be
too narrow. Nevertheless, this example illus-
trates the power behind really, truly knowing
your customers. You can immediately see how
this profile helps the company select which
products to carry in the store, what messages
to use in its advertising campaigns, how to price
the merchandise, and what type of customer
service drives repeat business.

Defining an attractive segment
If you only identified two or three new markets in total, verify that you’ve
identified the most attractive target markets. Use the following checklist to
evaluate the attractiveness of each potential segment:
 Competitors: Look at your competitor analysis (Chapter 9 covers this
topic in more detail). Are you better than the competition? Are they get-
ting better or worse at meeting the needs of customers in this segment?
 Company resources: Do you have the right strengths to compete in this
segment? Do you have weaknesses that need to be improved and are
they fixable? In Chapter 7, you can review your company’s strengths and
weaknesses. Look at the culture of your organization. Is it consistent
with serving this segment?
 Segment size: The sales potential of the segment, in terms of number of
units of your product that can be sold or number of customers served,
is important in making a segment attractive. Is it big enough to bother
with? To find out, use the market research resource provided in the sec-
tion “Locating Information Sources.” Remember, size is relative. What
may be too small to one company may be huge to another. Evaluate
where the segment is big enough based on your requirements.
 Segment growth rate: You want to enter market segments that are grow-
ing and not shrinking. While this may seem obvious, many companies
enter markets that are shrinking. Ideally, you should create a market
strategy that allows you to serve a market for a good length of time,
recouping marketing expenses and any product/service modifications.
To reduce the risk of losing money when entering a new market, find one
that is growing, not shrinking.
 Segment profitability: You need to know if focusing on this customer
group is feasible. A segment’s profitability is important in making a seg-
ment attractive. Knowing how profitable is profitable is only subject to
your company’s requirements. You can estimate revenue for one year
with a simple formula:
Number of customers × average sale per customer × number of
sales per customer per year = revenue.
To determine profit from the segment, subtract the estimated costs
associated with producing the product or service and reaching the seg-
ment. (See Chapter 13 for more details.)
 Segment accessibility: It’s possible to identify a very attractive segment,
but there’s no cost effective way to reach them. An attractive segment
requires that you can reach this group through clear communication
channels. To reach them, you first have to find them. A good indicator of
segment accessibility is how easy or hard it is to dig up information in
your market research efforts.
213
Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

 Segment differentiation: Uniqueness is a characteristic of an attractive
segment. Will this group respond to product and service offerings differ-
ently than other groups you have identified? If not, consider combining
two segments. Segment differentiation tends to be obvious. You either
see a clear difference or you don’t. But you may need to additionally
research or test-market your product or promotional message to make
sure.
Evaluating your target customer groups
Choices, choices, choices. It’s hard to narrow down options, especially when
they all look good. Figure 11-1 provides an excellent tool to help you evaluate
how well each group stacks up against the other. You can use this tool to
eliminate markets as well as to prioritize them. To use the tool, follow these
steps:
1. In Figure 11-1 or on a separate notes page, write in the name of each
segment across the top of the paper.
2. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 3 (excellent), rate each segment against the
market attractiveness criteria on the left-hand side.
3. Add up each column.
4. Focus on the segments with the highest total score.
Take the segments with the highest total score and use them in Chapter 12 to
develop your strategic goals/priorities for the coming year or years.
How do you stack up against the competition?
How are your company resources positioned to
meet the needs of this segment?
What is the size of this segment?
What is the growth potential of this segment?
What is the profitability of this segment?
How accessible is this segment?
Will this group respond differently from other
groups to product and service offerings?

Standing Out from the Crowd: Your
Positioning Statement
You’ve determined who you want to market to, what their needs and wants
are, and that they, as a group, are attractive enough to get your interest. Now
you just have to get their attention! Here’s a great analogy about how to get
your customers’ attention:
“Cows, after you’ve seen them for a while, are boring. They may be per-
fect cows, attractive cows, cows with a great personality, cows lit by a
beautiful light, but they’re still boring. A purple cow, though: Now, that
would really stand out. The essence of the purple cow is that it would be
remarkable. Something remarkable is worth talking about, worth paying
attention to,” writes Seth Godin, author of Purple Cow (Portfolio
Hardcover).
The world isn’t only full of boring stuff (like brown cows), but it’s also full of
thousands of competitors, which is why so few people pay attention to what
you’re trying to communicate and sell. If in doubt, measure the level of
market noise in your industry by typing in your business description into
Google to see how many companies are doing the same thing you are.
(Strategic planning returns 70 million results!)
Godin’s analogy is simply a visual representation of an age-old marketing con-
cept called positioning. Positioning is the space your product/service occu-
pies in the mind of your customers. No matter what, companies consciously
or subconsciously influence their position in the customer’s mind. You may
or may not be positioned the way you want to be. You may also just be a
brown cow — invisible and boring. Extremely well positioned products or
services become nouns or verbs such as Kleenex and Google.
To get customers and potential customers to pay attention, you must clearly
position yourself in your customers’ mind. To do so, you need a positioning
statement that guides all your marketing efforts directed at the target cus-
tomer group. It’s the core message you want to deliver in every medium and
everything you do.
In the next few sections, I discuss position statements and how to make
yours really shine!
215
Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

Writing your positioning statements
The purpose of writing a positioning statement is to ensure that all of your
marketing activities for a customer groups are consistent and clear. (And it
saves you tons of time in the long run.) Initially, focus on writing a positioning
statement that’s only used internally. In the future, you may end up using it
for other purposes such as in your marketing collateral. But if you throw that
into the mix the first go around, crafting a statement that makes sense may
be more difficult. Ready to jump in?
To write your positioning statements, follow these steps:
1. Select the target customer group you want to focus on.
2. Develop a list of needs your customer group has that you intend to
meet (if not already included in your customer profile).
3. List your product/service’s benefits that uniquely meet these needs.
4. Use the lists of customer needs and product/service benefits to finish
this sentence: When this customer group thinks of my product or
service, I want them to think __________________.
5. Evaluate your positioning statement by making sure it’s simple, clear,
and consistent.
6. Get the word out to everyone by consistently communicating your
positioning message in everything your company does for this cus-
tomer group.
Don’t forget: The customer himself does the real positioning by paying atten-
tion and deciding to buy your product/service. What you do have control
over is assessing what positions exist in the customer’s mind and then deter-
mining which of those you have the best chance of occupying and defending
based on your own strengths.
Perusing examples of 
positioning statements
Sometimes a positioning statement sounds like a tag line or a slogan. That’s
fine, but remember that the purpose of a positioning statement isn’t to be
cute. Instead its purpose is to help guide all your activities associated with a
specific target customer group. You can turn it into a marketing message in
the future.

If you need some inspiration, read through these positioning statements from
large and small companies:
 Mercedes-Benz: Engineered like no other car in the world.
 Wharton Business School: The only business school that trains man-
agers who are global, cross-functional, good leaders, and leveraged by
technology.
 BMW: The ultimate driving machine.
 Southwest Airlines: The short-haul, no-frills, and low-priced airline.
 Midwest Express: All the creature comforts and calm, refined air service
at competitive prices.
 Avis: We are only Number 2, so we try harder!
 Famous Footwear: The value shoe store for families.
 Miller Lite: The only beer with superior taste and low caloric content.
 The Heidel House Resort: The place to reconnect with loved ones.
 Northern Nevada Business Weekly: The only source for local business
news.
Reaching Your New Target Markets
No matter whether you’re targeting 18- to 34-year-old high-income males or
65- to 85-year-old fixed income retirees, you’ve got to reach them effectively
and efficiently. That means finding the right balance of marketing tools and
program elements to create and deliver the right product or service to con-
sumers at the right price, right location, right time, and with the right fea-
tures and attributes.
The Four Ps: Neither a soul 
band nor a legume
At this stage, you want to bring in your marketing mix. The marketing mix, or
the Four Ps — promotion, place, product, price — are the combination of
actions you have to serve your target market.
Think of each P as a leg on a chair. If they don’t all support each other, the
chair falls over. The same thing is true for your marketing mix. Each element
needs to support the other. If there are inconsistencies, your customers will
notice.
217
Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

One of the main keys to the success of any marketing program is creating
a marketing mix that is 100 percent relevant and resonates with your target
market. The following sections cover all four Ps and how they fit into the
market.
Product
Your marketing mix is based on and built off your products and/or services.
Products are defined as anything that’s capable of satisfying customer needs.
Make sure that you have a product or service that is geared toward the need
of your target market.
Price
Make sure that your price is within the budget of your target market to create
that marketing mix that your customers desire. From the customer’s perspec-
tive, price is the monetary expression of value, and that value is enjoyed by
customers. Therefore, value equals benefits minus price. This P is one of the
easiest Ps to change. But remember that price really is the only place that
actually directly determines revenue generation.
Promotion
It’s not enough to just have a good product at a good price. These benefits
have to be communicated to the customer. Gear your promotional messaging
to solve the problems that customers encounter.
There are hundreds of ways to communicate with your customer and more
are being added every day. (Even manhole covers have logos on them!) The
high-level channels include advertising, direct marketing, personal selling,
sales promotion, and public relations.
Place
This P is also known as distribution. Ensure that your distribution efforts are
seen by your target market. Place determines where customers can buy or
receive your products and services. For product companies, this refers to all
of the locations a customer can find your merchandise, such as resellers’
stores, the company’s own stores, a catalogue, ecommerce Web site, or a
reseller’s Web site. For service companies, this P is often thought of in terms
of convenience. How easy is it for a customer to buy services from you? For
example, a dry cleaning service increased convenience by centrally locating
its operations, offering a delivery and pick-up service, and partnering with
several tailors in town.

Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

Estella’s Exotic Escapes specializes in high-end, hard-to-find vacation pack-
ages. However, half of the packages she offers include mega-chain hotels in
places like Cancun and Kona. Her prices are geared toward a large budget
and her ads are in publications that have a subscription base of senior citi-
zens. Do you see the “marketing mix” chair falling over? The “legs” of the
chair don’t support each other. Clearly, this example is over exaggerated, but
you always want to make sure that your marketing mix has a message that
works together.
The cycle of (product) life
From a strategic perspective, looking at where your product or service is in
its life cycle helps determine actions in each of the Four Ps related to your
target customer groups (see the previous section for info on the Four Ps).
The four product-life cycle phases are
 Introduction: This phase provides a period of slow growth with nonexis-
tent profits (because of the extensive promotional costs). Examples:
Third-generation mobile phones, e-conferencing, iris-based personal
identity cards.
 Growth: Growth is a period of rapid market acceptance and developing
profits. Examples: MP3 players, e-mail, breathable synthetic fabrics,
smart cards.
 Maturity: This phase is a period of slow growth, level profits, and
increasing marketing expenditures to defend the product’s position
against competitors. Examples: Personal computers, faxes, cotton 
t-shirts, credit cards.
 Decline: Decline is a period of falling sales and profits. Examples:
Handwritten letters, check books, CD players.
Figure 11-2 provides an example to help you develop actions for each of the
Four Ps depending on where your product is in the product-life cycle. For
each target customer group, follow these steps:
1. Determine your marketing goal for the target customer group.
Flip to Chapter 12 for guidance on writing goals.
2. Determine what phase of the product-life cycle your product or ser-
vice is in.
Use information in the section above, “The cycle of (product) life,” to
determine where your product or service is in its life.
219
Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

3. Develop an action plan that addresses product, price, promotion, 
distribution.
Use the information in Chapter 13 to develop an action plan that supports the
goal you developed for this target customer group.
You may not need to take a specific action for each of the Four Ps. But write
down what’s happening so you can ensure the marketing mix works cohesively.
Staying Market-Focused
The process of researching, segmenting, targeting, and reaching new cus-
tomers doesn’t need to be something you do only when you’re focused on
finding new customers. In fact, world class companies have made it a habit to
be market-focused. Being market-focused means taking marketing activities
out of just the marketing department and away from initiatives. In fact, world-
class companies have made it a habit to be market-focused. It means making
marketing part of everyone’s job.

Gathering relevant information
The key to being market-focused is continuously gathering relevant informa-
tion about your customers and your market. Most likely, you already gather a
significant amount of customer information in meetings and discussions with
customers and distributors, from sales reports, through databases, and so on.
When you gather this info, you have to do something with it. Take these tips
to heart about your info:
 Start collecting the info in a systematic fashion by making a group mar-
keting storage unit such as a physical filing cabinet or a file on your com-
pany server.
 Scan the environment for information about government regulation and
policies, technological changes, competitors and their activities, and
future industry trends. Continual environmental scanning allows you to
stay proactive, taking advantage of shifts as they happen, instead of
being reactive, and scrambling to keep up.
Sources for info include trade publications, industry events, and your
local network. Consider doing this scan quarterly or semi-annually.
Sharing what you know
When you get a bunch of information, what are your going to do with it? The
information you gather should be regularly compiled in a usable form and
then shared with employees in various ways. These sharing avenues can
include
 Informal meetings
 Customer and market databases
 Staff meetings
 Company newsletters
 Brown-bag lunches
 Forums
 Internal message postings
 Company blogs
Intelligence needs to be communicated clearly, continuously, and appropri-
ately so that your staff can strategically respond to the needs of the market.
221
Chapter 11: Finding New Customers

Responding to what you’ve discovered
Responding to your market is critical to being market-focused. You can gener-
ate information and communicate it internally, but unless you respond to
market needs, nothing gets accomplished. Your company should be driven by
 An understanding of what your customers want
 The knowledge of how to meet the customers’ needs
 The delivery of the product or service customers want
Many of you reading this may already be doing most of these activities. Great
job! If you aren’t, it’s okay. Take some action to formalize your process.
Studies show that companies that link these activities together achieve
greater levels of performance when compared to their competitors. A com-
pany that increases its market focus by ten percent can see a growth of
between 17 and 20 percent in overall performance.

assessment tool: www.m3planning.com/survey.
Putting It All Together: Organizing
Customer Information
Businesses that succeed do so by creating and keeping customers. Because
marketing plays the key role of making that happen, it has a large part in set-
ting the strategic direction of the organization. But unlike the other sections
of your plan, the marketing section starts with a target customer group
instead of a goal. Figure 11-3 is an example of how to organize your customer
profile information.
You can use the marketing portion of your strategic plan to develop a com-
plete marketing plan, which would include more detail about your markets
and your action plans to reach them. However, smaller organizations often
choose to just have one plan, a strategic plan, that covers your intended mar-
keting actions.

ongratulations! If you’ve been working through this book from beginning
to end, you’ve made it halfway through the strategic planning process.
Right about now, it’s common to feel like the process is a little out of control.
This occurs primarily because you have collected so much information,
input, and feedback that sorting through it all seems impossible. It can feel
disorienting. So step back and review what you’re doing. Strategic planning
answers where you are now, where you’re going, and how you’re getting
there.
Visualize a famous bridge such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge,
or Tower Bridge. All bridges have two primary support pillars and span in
between the two, allowing one part of land to be connected with another. One
of these pillars explains where you are now — your mission, your values,
your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The pillar on the far
side represents where you are going — your vision. And how you get there is
the span or the road in between — your strategic objectives, goals, and
action plans.
Now because the span between the two pillars is quite long, in order to
bridge the gap, you need long-term strategic objectives and short-term goals.
How you build the bridge is your strategy. You can have a different strategy
for each section of the bridge. You can have a consistent strategy for the
whole thing, it doesn’t matter. But think about the strategy as the how, and
the goals and strategic objectives as the what.

The critical part of this analogy is that in order for the bridge to function
properly, every element has to support the other or it collapses. So as you
look at the ideas you generated in the previous chapters, some of them help
connect the two pillars and some of them are probably outliers.
Use the following process to develop your road, which connects your mission
to your vision:
 Evaluate all the strategic priorities generated by assessing your strategic
position.
 Develop a “short list” of internal and external strategic priorities.
 Create strategic objectives (three to five years).
 Create short-term goals (one year).
 Develop action plans based on the goals (next 90 days).
 Establish who’s responsible for carrying out the goals.
 Agree on how and when to measure progress.
In this chapter, you’re going to evaluate your strategic opportunities, priori-
ties, and goals. I use the words opportunity, choice, alternative, ideas, possibili-
ties, thoughts, and actions to mean anything that you’re considering acting on
and including in your strategic plan. So keep that in mind as you read.
Evaluating All Your Opportunities
Being strategic is about making choices. Strategic choice is about making
subjective decisions based on goal information. To do so, you first generate a
list of all feasible alternatives. That means everything. Don’t be shy — put
down all your thoughts about potential opportunities for your organization.
In Chapters 7 through 11, you cast your net out wide to determine the actions
to take based on your current strategic position. In fact, it probably feels a
little messy right now. If you worked through each of the previous chapters,
more than likely you have pages of notes that list ideas, possible goals, sug-
gested actions, to-dos, and some short-term and some long-term strategic
objectives. (A long list of ideas and actions isn’t necessary.)
226
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

Identifying opportunities from 
your SWOT analysis
The snapshot of your strategic position is captured in your SWOT analysis
(from Chapter 9). By itself, a SWOT isn’t actionable. By matching up factors
from one quadrant with factors in another quadrant, you can start to identify
potential actions based on the SWOT analysis.
The point of matching up internal factors with external factors is to identify a
fit between organizational strengths and market opportunities. In other
words, what opportunities can you take advantage of, based on what you’ve
already got to work with? Also, by matching weaknesses up with opportuni-
ties or threats, you may see some compelling pairs that are worth pursuing.
In this exercise, get creative! Put all your ideas down, even if they seem
ridiculous. Allow yourself and your team to brainstorm. You can pull it back
down to Earth at the end of the exercise. See Figure 12-1 for a visual.
To develop a variety of choices, work through these steps with yourself or
your team:
1. Pull out your SWOT analysis from Chapter 9 (if you’ve completed that
already).
No SWOT? Then pull one together for this exercise or jump to the next
section.

Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

2. On a white board or a big piece of paper, draw a matrix similar to
Figure 12-1.
If you have a lot of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, or threats, you
don’t have to rewrite them all in the matrix boxes, just work from a
handout.
3. In the box labeled SO Alternatives, match internal strengths with
external opportunities.
4. In the box labeled WO Alternatives, match internal weaknesses with
external opportunities.
5. In the box labeled ST Alternatives, match internal strengths with
external threats.
6. In the box labeled WT Alternatives, match internal weaknesses with
external threats.
7. Review all four quadrants and highlight the choices that look the most
promising.
8. Use the items you highlighted as a source of potential actions when
developing your priorities in the section, “Creating a short list of 
priorities.”
Here are some generic examples of how this exercise works:
 Strong reputation (strength) + Market growth in a neighboring commu-
nity (opportunity) = Expanded operations in new market
 High cost structure in a specific product line (weakness) + Arrival of new
technology that would reduce supply chain overhead (opportunity) =
Improved operations through technology investment
 Cost advantages through proprietary knowledge (strength) + Primary
industry is in decline (threat) = Entering new industry that leverages
cost advantages
 Poor employee morale (weakness) + Tight labor market (threat) =
Development of an improved employee benefits package
Sorting through your other opportunities
In addition to your SWOT analysis, throughout the strategic planning
process, you’ve kept ideas and notes (I hope) about possible actions to
include in your strategic plan. But in case your ideas aren’t all in one place,
use the following list to gather your thoughts about your current strategic
position:
228
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

 Last year’s incomplete goals and actions (Chapter 4)
 Improvements, modifications, enhancements to current products and
services (Chapter 4)
 Improvements to operational process (Chapter 7)
 Enhancements to capabilities and resources (Chapter 7)
 Action to eliminate cash drains and improve cash creators (Chapter 7)
 Ideas to improve current customer value, retention, and loyalty 
(Chapter 8)
 Opportunities and threats in the environment, industry, and market
(Chapter 9)
 Entering new markets and serving new customer groups (Chapter 11)
Look at these different lists and eliminate anything that’s unrealistic, unim-
portant, and excessive. Create a list of choices that are truly important to
your organization right now. As with the previous exercise, use this list as a
source of potential actions in the section “Create a short list of priorities.”
Choosing the Best Opportunities
This section brings you to the scary part of strategic planning. Why? Because
people are terrified of making the wrong choice. If you worked through the
previous section, you have some lists of choices, but you can’t do everything,
so it’s elimination time. Know that every other business owner, executive
director, and department manager has come to the same place as you are
right now. Although there are never guarantees in business, this section
helps you develop your own guidelines to assure that you make the right
choices. But at the end of the day, you have to make a decision.
First off, know that there are four reasons people put off making decisions:
 They don’t have enough data.
 They may have too much data to decipher.
 They don’t know that a decision is required.
 People are afraid of losing their job.
The one concept that most business owners, executives, and managers forget
is that the lack of a decision results in more derailments of the mission than
any other cause.
229
Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

Developing your own rules
In my work, clients often ask for a tried and true method to evaluate all the
strategic choices that are in front of them. Unfortunately, in my experience, I
haven’t found such a fail-safe method. What does work is establishing a set of
parameters or rules that are specific and unique to your operating environ-
ment. Use these rules to judge any and all strategic choices that come up.
Clearly in the strategic planning process, you seek out options and choices.
But such decisions occur regularly outside of strategic planning. By establish-
ing a set of rules, you can quickly evaluate whether an opportunity is really
an opportunity or a distraction. Develop a set of rules and use it as a litmus
test. If the opportunity doesn’t pass the test, it’s out.
Here are some categories of rules:
 Priority rule: With this rule, you prioritize some opportunities over
others based on their connection to reaching your vision. Set a rule to
require that all opportunities must help you reach your vision.
 Timing rule: This financial rule helps you prioritize opportunities based
on how much money you want to see returned within what time period.
Pull in your finance or accounting people to help you establish this one.
 Boundary rule: This rule says that every opportunity is evaluated
based on whether it’s within your mission. Set a rule to require that the
opportunity aligns with the organization’s core mission and values.
 How-to rule: Develop a rule that requires you to sketch out how to
implement the opportunity if you took advantage of it before jumping in.
If you can’t clearly define an action plan for the opportunity, you know
that trying to execute it will go poorly.
Sorting out internal and external priorities
Grouping priorities helps you compare like things when making trade-offs.
For example, choosing between investing in new technology or hiring a new
person are both expense decisions with similar outcomes, whereas choosing
between entering a new market or implementing a succession plan aren’t
directly related. So at this point, you want to divide your choices into two
groups — those that have internal implications and those that have external
implications.
230
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

How do you decide what’s internal and what’s external?
 Internal priorities include everything related to productivity improve-
ment such as employees, training, operations, technology, efficiencies,
research and development, and anything else that deals with the inter-
nal operations of your organization.
 External priorities include everything that’s related to revenue genera-
tion such as entering new target markets, developing new products, and
partnering with other organizations.
The quickest and easiest way to sort through your list is to highlight internal
priorities one color and external priorities another color.
Creating a short list of priorities
Creating a short list is the last part of synthesizing all your options down to
the select few for your strategic plan. Ideally, you want to have between three
and five internal and external priorities. If you have too many, you may lose
focus and your plan may become too big. More than likely, your lists contain
a dozen or so priorities, so it’s time to eliminate some more.
After you’ve sorted out your internal and external opportunities (see the pre-
vious section), start comparing your priorities to figure out which to take off
first. Remember to compare only opportunities that are directly competing
(external to external and internal to internal). You make this comparison
because you need to make some trade-offs. Making equitable trade-offs
requires comparing apples to apples. Internal priorities are competing with
other internal priorities, and external priorities are competing against other
external priorities.
If you have a hard time limiting your priorities, make a someday list. This list
contains priorities that are important and that you’ll get to some day. If there
are still too many options, use the paired comparison analysis that follows.
The paired comparison analysis helps you limit or prioritize your opportuni-
ties. (You can see how to set up this tool in Figures 12-2 and 12-3.) This analy-
sis helps you set priorities when there are multiple demands on the same
resources — your time and money. The paired comparison analysis isolates
choices and removes some subjectivity.
Use the tool to compare each option with each other option — one at a time.
Here’s the step-by-step guide to use this tool:
231
Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

1. Use your pared-down list of opportunities, and draw up a grid with
each option in both a row and a column header.
Assign a letter to each option.
2. Block out cells on the table where you’re going to be comparing an
option with itself.
There is never a difference in these cells. Normally you block out the
diagonal running from the top left to the bottom right.
3. Block out cells on where you’ll duplicate a comparison.
These cells are below the diagonal. See Figure 12-2 and copy the layout.
4. Within the remaining cells, compare the option in the row with the
one in the column.
For each cell, decide which of the two options is more important. Write
down the letter of the more important option in the cell, and score the
difference in importance from 0 (equal importance) to 3 (much more
important).
5. Consolidate the results by adding up the total of all the values for
each of the options.
Convert these values into a percentage of the total score to determine
rank of importance.
Chad’s Chimps, a small, local construction company, is looking at a variety of
expansion options described in Figure 12-3. With limited resources and bond-
ing capacity, the company can only pursue one opportunity at a time. The
opportunities include the following:
Opportunity #1
(A)
Opportunity #2
(B)
Opportunity #3

Opportunity #4

Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

 Expanding into new markets by opening satellite offices
 Buying a concrete company
 Establishing an exclusive partnership with a civil engineering company
 Expanding service line to include custom homes and remodels
Company executives compare the opportunities. First they write down the
letter of the most important option, and then they score their difference in
importance. For example, when comparing expanding into a new market (A)
with buying a concrete company (B), the executives chose A over B. Then
they decided that expanding into a new market was two times more impor-
tant than buying a concrete company. Therefore, in that cell they wrote in
A,2. They went through the same process for each comparison, then added
up the A, B, C, and D values and converted each into a percentage as follows:
 A = 6 (46 percent)
 B = 0 (0 percent)
 C = 3 (23 percent)
 D = 4 (31 percent)
Expanding into a new market is the most important opportunity (A), followed
by expanding the current service line (D). Buying a concrete company is the
least important and may come up when the other opportunities have been
realized. You can see how the comparison allows each opportunity to be
evaluated against the others as well as show the difference in importance
between each one.

Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

Balancing Out Your Strategic Priorities
Often, business owners and executives fall prey to the allure of setting too
many financial goals. Or, their goals are exclusively financial. This detracts
from the other reasons you’re in business, such as employing people, con-
tributing to their communities, or providing a needed product or service.
Enter the Balanced Scorecard.
The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is an excellent management tool that ensures
you have a holistic and balanced strategy as well as a way to track performance
over time to assess if goals are being met. I introduce the Balanced Scorecard in
this chapter to help you write goals in the four key areas that all organizations
must excel in to succeed. Then if you head to Chapter 14, you develop the rest
of your scorecard — specifically, how to track your measures and targets.
To have a balanced and holistic strategy, organizations must have goals that
feed off each other. These perspectives are described below:
 Financial or mission: When you provide value to your customers, you
achieve your financial or mission goals.
 Customer: If you want to generate additional revenue, you need to pro-
vide value to your customers.
 Internal and operational process: In order to provide value to your cus-
tomers, you must have internal business process to create that value.
 Employee (centering on learning and innovation): And in order for
your business processes to function, you need people who are skilled
and knowledgeable.
Tammy’s Tantalizing Tacos top line financial goal is to increase the revenue
by 10 percent annually. How will she achieve her financial goal? Sell more
tacos. In order to sell more tacos, she must provide great customer service.
And what does she need to do to deliver great customer service? Have effi-
cient processes that deliver food quickly. To excel at quick food delivery, she
has to have well-trained employees.
234
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 
The scorecard of success
The BSC was introduced by Robert Kaplan, a
Harvard Business School professor, and David
Norton, the founder and president of Balanced
Scorecard Collaborative, Inc., in the early 1990s
as a new way to work with business strategy.
Today, over half of the Fortune 1,000 companies
in North America are using the Balanced
Scorecard, which has become the hallmark of
a well-run organization. Many organizations say
the scorecard is the foundation of their mea-
surement and management systems.

For each perspective, develop at least one long-term strategic objective but
no more than five. If you develop too many at the beginning, your plan may
become unwieldy. Look at your short-list of external and internal priorities
you developed in the previous section. Note which priorities fall where. If
you’re short in any area, consider developing additional priorities to have a
balanced strategy.
Financial priorities: If we succeed, how
will we look to our shareholders?
Goals in the financial area come in two flavors: revenue generation and pro-
ductivity improvement. A solid strategic plan has one goal in each of these
activities. The financial perspective contains priorities that explain how your
company looks to shareholders, which are usually owners and investors. By
serving your customer well, you increase your revenue generation. By
improving your internal business process, you enhance productivity
improvement. Your financial goals may include the following:
 Revenue generation
• To increase revenue by 10 percent annually
• To increase gross profit by 10 percent annually
• To increase sales by 10 percent annually
 Productivity improvement
• To decrease expenses by 5 percent
• To increase net profit by 10 percent
• To improve overall efficiency as measured by output over a period
of time
• To improve overall productivity (doing more with what you have)
Customer priorities: How do we provide
value to our customers?
Customer priorities support the financial goals. These goals focus on meeting
the needs of the customer through products and services. All of your exter-
nal goals fall into this category. Crafting new customer and current customer
goals is a good way to structure this section. Some important long-term
strategic objectives for valuing your customers include
235
Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

 New customer goals
• Introduce existing products into a new market.
• Introduce new products to new and existing markets.
• Anticipate future customer needs through customer feedback.
• Expand sales to the global marketplace.
 Current customer goals
• Expand sales to existing customers.
• Increase customer retention.
• Increase customer loyalty.
• Cross sell existing products/services to current clients.
• Achieve and maintain outstanding customer service.
• Develop and use a customer database.
• Anticipate future customer needs through customer feedback.
Internal priorities: To satisfy our customers, 
in what processes must we excel?
Internal business process goals serve several purposes: Support the cus-
tomer and financial goals; focus on administrative processes that have an
impact on creating customer value and satisfaction; and focus on internal
management activities and operational functions needed to support the prod-
ucts and services. Look at your list of internal priorities for this section. In
Chapter 7, you find all the areas of organization you must look at in order to
succeed. You may glean some additional ideas from that chapter. Here are
some long-term strategic objectives to prioritize your internal goals:
 Acquire enhanced CRM data mining capabilities.
 Improve internal processes.
 Increase efficiencies through the use of wireless or virtual technology.
 Increase community outreach.
 Develop and implement a promotional plan to drive increased business.
 Establish one new strategic alliance annually.
 Improve internal communications.
236
Part IV: Moving Your Organization into the Future 

 Redirect or restructure available resources.
 Improve distributor and supplier relationships.
 Improve marketing, advertising, and public relations.
 Capitalize on physical facilities (location, capacity, and so on).
 Improve organizational structure.
Employee priorities: How must our 
organization grow and improve?
Employee priorities drive everything else in your plan. Without your team,
you don’t have an organization. These goals focus on developing people,
increasing the company’s knowledge base, improving through innovation,
and discovering best practices. Check out Chapter 7 for additional informa-
tion on employee priorities. Work on these long-term strategic objectives
with your employees:
 Continually discover and adopt current best practices.
 Align incentives and rewards with employee performance.
 Employ professionals who create success for customers.
 Develop a broad set of skills useful for customer support.
 Develop a team who understands strategy.
 Transfer knowledge from your leading-edge clients.
 Continually develop a set of best practices in your industry and your
clients’ industries.
 Improve labor relations, human resource development, and training.
Turning Priorities into Strategies,
Objectives, and Goals
This area is probably the most widely debated part of strategic planning.
Having goals, objectives, and strategies are great, but knowing how they all
work together (if in fact they do) and if you need them all is another story. I
suggest ignoring the semantics and focusing on establishing a time frame.
What matters is having a combination of long-term and short-term markers to
keep your organization moving in the right direction. Think of the following
hierarchy to demystify the terms of your priorities:
237
Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

 Core Values: Your guiding principles that rarely change and that you to
stick to no matter what vision you’re pursuing
 Mission: The underlying reason why you’re in business in the first place
 Vision: The big, hairy, bold goal you’re headed for, and the thing con-
cept that everything your company does is focused on
 Strategy: The guiding statement that explains how you get to your vision
 Three-year strategic objectives: Intermediate goals that are broad and
continuous, that you achieve on the way to your vision, and that explain
the activities you need to be in to achieve your vision
 One-year goals: One-year markers that support your long-term strategic
objectives
 Action items: Items that explain who and the when
Figure 12-4 illustrates how to use the four balanced scorecard perspectives
as well as how strategies, goals, and objectives fit together.

Strategizing how to reach your vision
Your strategies are the general methods you intend to use to reach your
vision. Although strategies are embedded in all elements of your strategic
plans, consider listing the top one to two strategies or long-term activities
your company needs to pursue in order to achieve its vision.
A strategy is like an umbrella. It’s a general statement(s) that guides and
covers a set of activities. You can develop strategies for your whole organiza-
tion, a department, a specific set of activities, or a guiding statement for a
year. No matter what the level, strategies answer the question of how you do
something.
To write strategies, answer the following questions:
 What initiatives do we need to pursue?
 How will we achieve our vision?
Here are a few sample strategies:
 Starbucks’ strategy is to build the brand one cup at a time, based on
three key ingredients: the quality of the coffee, their retail stores, and
selective brand extensions.
 Erlach Computer Consulting’s strategy for 2008 is to lay the foundation
for growth.
 The Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada’s strategy is to
move toward economic development and to increase the base of compa-
nies contributing to the region’s measurable quality of life to ensure
long-term vitality of the community.
Writing your long-term strategic objectives
Strategic objectives are the general areas in which your effort is directed to
drive your mission and vision. With strategic objectives, the company moves
from motive to action. They define what an organization is intending to
accomplish both programmatically and organizationally. Strategic objectives
are broad categories — non-measurable and continuous.
To help you write your strategic objectives, think about your answers to the
following questions:
 What areas do you need to be involved in to accomplish your mission?
 In what areas will you continue being actively involved in for the next
five years?
239
Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

Making your short-term goals SMART
Realistic goals ought to serve as a tool for stretching a company to reach its
full potential; this means setting them high enough to be challenging to ener-
gize the company and its strategy. Short-term goals are immediate mileposts
on your way to your vision. Think about achieving them in a one-year time-
frame. With goals, the company converts the mission, vision, and long-term
strategic objectives into performance targets.
For effective goals to function as yardsticks for tracking a company’s perfor-
mance and progress, they must state how much of what kind of performance
and by when it is to be accomplished. They must be relevant, aggressive yet
achievable, and be stated in measurable or quantifiable terms. Think SMART
when you create your goals:
 Specific: Goals need to be specific. Try to answer the questions of How
much and What kind with each goal you write.
 Measurable: Goals must be stated in quantifiable terms, or otherwise
they’re only good intentions. Measurable goals facilitate management
planning, implementation, and control. (See the section below for more
on measuring your goals.)
 Attainable: Goals must provide a stretch that inspires people to aim
higher. Goals must be achievable, or they’re a set-up for failure. Set goals
you know you, your company, and employees can realistically reach.
 Responsible person: Goals must be assigned to a person or a depart-
ment. But just because a person is assigned to a goal doesn’t mean that
she’s solely responsible for its achievement. See Chapter 14 for ideas on
how to hold your team accountable for goal achievement.
 Time specific: With reference to time, your goals must include a timeline
of when your goals should be accomplished.
Pegging Your Measures
Goals are desired outcomes. The progress toward attaining an goal is gauged
by one or more measures. There are causal relationships between goals —
one action causes another outcome. Because you have established SMART
goals, it is easier to pull out or delineate the measures you need to track.
Measures are the indicators of how a business is performing relative to its
goals. For every goal, you should track one, maybe two, measures that tell
you how you’re progressing toward achieving the desired outcome. Measures
are quantifiable performance statements, and they must follow certain 
guidelines:

 Relevant to the goal and strategy
 Placed in context of a target to be reached in an identified time frame
 Capable of being tracked period after period
 Owned by the person who’s responsible for the goal
Sometimes the measures are obvious, like number of new customers. Other
times, they can be very hard to come up with. If you’re stumped, ask yourself
some of the following questions:
 What causes this goal to occur?
 What causes increased sales?
 What causes operations to improve?
 What causes an increase in market share?
 What causes customer satisfaction?
 What causes employee satisfaction?
See Figure 12-5 for a list of possible measures.

Chapter 12: Establishing Your Strategic Priorities

By creating good solid measures, you’ve established the first step in develop-
ing your scorecard (see Chapter 14 for more scorecard info). Your corporate
scorecard is a tool to help you monitor the progress of your business and
your strategic plan. A scorecard consists of two pieces for every goal:
 Measures: This measurement is an explanation (word text) of what you
want to achieve. These indicate whether the overall strategy has been
accomplished. This is an end point.
 Targets: These quantify (numeric) the outcome measures. Target mea-
sures are the specific numbers you need to hit in order to achieve your
goal and can be expressed in weekly, monthly, or annual figures.
Determining measures can be tough work. Don’t agonize over finding the best
measure. Start with the most obvious and easiest to collect. As you work with
your plan over the next several years, you can refine your measures.

Creating and
Making the Most
of Your Plan

In this part . . . 
T
his part is the heart of the work on your strategic
plan. You put your plan together in a cohesive, clear
document, and then you move to executing the plan.
You read about everything from how to empower your
employees to holding effective strategy meetings. I also
cover contingency planning — what to do if your plan fails
and you need to head to Plan B. If you run a governmental
agency, nonprofit organization, small business, or a
department, this is the part for you.

Putting Your Plan Together
In This Chapter
 Developing action plans for your short-term goals
 Assessing the financial viability of your strategic plan
 Getting the money for your plan
 Mapping out your strategy
 Writing, reviewing, and finalizing your plan
You’ve arrived! If you’re at this chapter in sequence, you’ve reached the
point where you can actually put your strategic plan together and give
your plan life. You’ve developed your business strategy and you have a clear
roadmap designed to reach your vision. You’ve identified what you’re best at
(Chapter 5), refined your mission, vision, and values (Chapter 6), sized up
your internal and external environment (Chapters 7, 8, and 9), determined
your growth strategies (Chapter 10), selected new markets to reach (Chapter
11), and established your strategic objectives and goals (Chapter 12). The
next step (this chapter) is to put all these elements together and put your
plan in action.
Before your plan is complete, you develop action plans and complete a finan-
cial assessment. Also in this chapter, you create a strategy map, which really
is your roadmap to your vision!
Assembling Your Strategic Plan
With all the work you’ve done up to this point, it’s time to put it together in
one comprehensive document. This may seem tedious, but I guarantee
there’s someone on your staff who loves this type of detail work. Seek that
person out to collate everything you have done to date. If you don’t have
such a person, brew up a big pot of coffee and get to work!

Here’s why this part of the job is so important:
 The strategic direction becomes clear. Without bringing everything
together in one document, your plan is just a bunch of different parts.
When the parts become whole, you clearly see how you can reach your
vision.
 Ideas become action. Up until now, you’ve developed and collected a
bunch of great ideas. By formalizing them into a plan, you can develop
action plans and assess the financial viability of your choices.
 Gaps are identified. With everything in one place, stand back and evalu-
ate your plan. Does it make sense? Are your goals supporting one
another? Have you missed anything?
If you’ve kept your notes in your strategy notebook (explained in the
Introduction), bringing everything together should go quickly. Don’t forget to
bring together the ideas and input from your team that you’ve been soliciting
throughout the planning process. If you didn’t use a strategy notebook, here
are the main topics to reference:
 Competitive advantage: Chapter 5
 Mission, vision, values: Chapter 6
 Long-term strategies: Chapter 12
 Strategic objectives: Chapter 12
 SWOT analysis: Chapters 7, 8, 9
 Customer profiles: Chapter 11
 Three-year and one-year goals: Chapters 10, 11, 12
 Action plan: Chapter 13
 Financial projections: Chapter 13
Please note that a strategic plan isn’t like a business plan because the strate-
gic plan document is primarily for your internal use. It’s not a sales piece for
outside critique (except in the case of seeking financing), so you don’t need
any extra verbiage or fluff. Just make sure that the text looks nice and is easy
to read. Consider adding your logo to the header or footer and formatting it
so it looks professional.
More than likely you have some ideas, goals, and considerations that aren’t
part of this plan, but you don’t want to lose them. Create a “Someday List” or
file. Put all your extra information in this file for your next strategic planning
session.
In addition to using the chapters referenced in the preceding list, tailor your
strategic plan to your business by incorporating the ideas in Chapters 17 and
18, depending on your business type.

Getting Down to Business 
and Taking Action
By the time company managers get to the action planning part of strategic
planning, many are tired and worn out from all the work leading up to this
point. But don’t stop yet! Setting action items and to-dos for each short-term
goal is essential, and now it’s time to connect those goals with people, dead-
lines, and costs.
You are developing an action plan for each goal. An action plan explains
who’s going to do what, by when, and in what order for the organization to
reach its goals. The design and implementation of the action planning depend
on the nature and needs of the organization.
Although this may seem like a monumental task, here are a few ways to sim-
plify the process:
 List the concrete steps or to-dos that you need to accomplish in order
to achieve your goals. You don’t need to list every single action item for
each goal — that might take all year.
 Focus on identifying large to-dos that warrant discussion at a team
level. Stay away from big items that are so big that you don’t know
where to start.
 Identify all the actions that need to occur in the next 90 days.
Continue this same process every 90 days until the goal is achieved.
To develop your action plan, take a look at these approaches:
 The group approach: With your strategic planning team or a group of
staff members who are impacted by the goal, you can identify the next
actions for each short-term goal. The benefit of working in a group is the
ability to generate a lot of ideas about how best to achieve the goal. The
drawback is action planning in a group setting can take a long time.
 The individual approach: Because every short-term goal is assigned to
a person or department, you can have each party develop action items
for the goal he or she is responsible for. Then reconvene as a group and
discuss each action plan. The benefit to this approach is speed and per-
sonal buy-in. The drawback is you may miss out on group ideas.
247
Chapter 13: Putting Your Plan Together

For every short-term goal, identify the following items. These items are listed
in logical order and flow to make it easy to develop each one:
 Action item or to-do: Start the sentence with a verb to show the action
that’s being done. After all the action items are listed, order them based
on priority.
 Person or department responsible: If there’s shared responsibility,
make one person the lead.
 Start and end dates: Start dates are important because they allow you
to see the duration of an action. Without the start date, you won’t know
if you are behind schedule until the end date passes. When establishing
an end date, commit to the deadline.
 Expense: Identify an estimated expense if applicable.
 Progress or current status: Use this gauge to indicate what percentage
of the action item is complete or to explain what’s happening with the
action item right now. Update this field regularly for reporting and track-
ing purposes.
See Figure 13-1 for visual representation. Also see Figure 12-4 in Chapter 12
for an expanded version of this figure.
Don’t worry about writing action items for your financial goals. All your finan-
cial goals are achieved through the rest of the goals in your plan. For exam-
ple, increasing sales by 10 percent is a function of marketing and sales
reaching new customers or selling more to existing customers.
Ensuring Your Plan Makes Cents
After you’ve completed your goals and actions, assess the financial viability
of your strategic plan. While your action items and goals are fresh in your
mind, estimate the costs associated with the implementation of each item.

Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

All the best-laid strategic plans are subject to time and money. In this section,
you look at the estimated expenses and the potential revenue. This review
helps you make decisions about when to implement certain action items and
whether your cash outlay generates the required revenue to meet your finan-
cial goals. As with every business, budgets are never big enough to do every-
thing you want to do.
A business can be considered a financial success when it
 Stays in the black and turns a profit
 Has a healthy balance sheet (See Chapter 4 on ratios)
 Generates good cash flow
 Produces a good return on investment (ROI) for its shareholders
Attaining financial success, starts with a financial assessment that’s based on
historical record and future projections. By looking at the past to help plan
and predict the future, you can gain much better control over your com-
pany’s financial performance. A good financial plan gives you a detailed pic-
ture of the financial health of your business and the viability of your strategic
plan. It also helps you know if you’re getting off track during implementation
so you can take action before anything serious occurs — like running out of
cash.
To conduct a financial assessment of your strategic plan, take the following
steps:
1. Estimate revenue and expenses.
2. Conduct a contribution analysis to determine if your strategies posi-
tively contribute to the bottom line.
3. Combine all your numbers in a one-year and three-year financial 
projection.
The cold reality is you’re in business to make money. If you’re not making a
return on your investment, at some point, you don’t have a business; you
have an expensive hobby. Ouch! That hurts, I know, but it’s the truth. If you
don’t believe this, skip this section. But if you do, your financial assessment
concludes with an analysis on your ROI. After all, there’s no sense in imple-
menting a plan if it won’t yield the desired return.
As an owner, you’re either investing in or drawing out of your business. If
you’re investing for growth, you ought to have a clearly defined payback
period and strategic plan to get you through it as fast as possible. Your pay-
back period needs to match up with your owner’s vision (see Chapter 6 for
more info). Business owners often plan for growth without considering how
long it takes to get a payback or developing the action plans to get there.
249
Chapter 13: Putting Your Plan Together

By looking at how quickly you’ll get paid back for your investment, it forces
you to answer the question if you’re comfortable with the time period. If it is
too long and too big of an investment, don’t invest. Revise your strategic plan
by removing some goals and action items until you develop a plan you can
live with. Remember, the plan works for you — you don’t work for the plan.
Estimating revenue and expenses
Expense and revenue estimating is an imperfect science. However, it’s meant
to give you an idea of the additional cash outlay required to implement each
area of your plan and the revenue you can expect to generate. In the previous
exercises, you identified potential expenses for action items as well as poten-
tial revenue for each target market group in Chapter 11. Here you combine that
information with your current operations to get a complete financial picture.
It’s important to identify large expenses that might prohibit implementation.
Revenue
An easy approach for estimating potential revenue is by each target customer
group (see Chapter 11 for information on finding new customers). Ideally,
your market research gives you a rough idea of how much you can anticipate
generating. Use the following formula to determine estimated revenue.
Multiply the number of customers by the average sale per customer by
the number of sales per customer per year. That equals your estimated
revenue per year.
Expenses
List expenses associated with any goal or action in the plan that aren’t part of
your normal operating expenses. Additionally, estimate your current operat-
ing expenses by forecasting each item based on how it increases to accom-
modate for the expected growth.
Contributing to the bottom line
Just because a market looks attractive, doesn’t always mean that you can
serve it profitably. Before your creative folks start churning out cool ads, do a
quick contribution analysis. A contribution analysis determines whether a par-
ticular target customer group contributes to the overall financial well-being
of the company. In other words, is this customer group profitable?
This analysis provides you with a projection of whether your strategy gener-
ates revenues in excess of expenses. If the contribution analysis determines
that the dollar investment in the strategy required to reach this target customer
250
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

group can’t be justified, rethink and adjust customer goals and financial
goals. Use Figure 13-2 as a guide to conduct this analysis for each of your
target customer groups. Eliminate the groups that don’t positively contribute
to the bottom line. Those that do are used in your financial projections in the
next step, covered in the next section.
Projecting out your financial future
By putting all your revenue and expense numbers together and projecting
them out over three years, you can see in black and white how successful
your business can be. Projecting also allows you to grow the business with-
out running out of cash. Growth in sales always incurs additional cash
requirements to generate and support the additional revenues. When used
properly, financial projections help you determine what additional assets are
needed to support your increased sales and what impact that has on your
balance sheet. In other words, the plan indicates how much additional debt
or equity you need to stay afloat.
Estimated Revenue
(Number of customers x average sale per customer x
number of sales per customer per year)
Minus Action Item Expenses
(Expenses from action items associated directly
with this target customer group.)
Minus Other Direct Expenses
(You may have other action item expenses required
to reach this customer group.)
Gross Profit
(Subtract cost of goods sold from estimated revenue)
$379,800 – $10,000 =
$369,800
$50 x $100 x 2 =
$10,000
100 x $1,899 x 2 =
$379,800
Contribution to Bottom Line
Minus Cost of Goods Sold
(Cost of goods sold =  Unit cost x number of sales
per customer per year.  If you are a service
company, there may not be a cost of goods sold.)
$10,000 + $100,000 =
$110,000

Chapter 13: Putting Your Plan Together

All commonly-used financial and accounting system packages come with
functions to create financial projections. Use these tools to create your finan-
cial projections by plugging in assumptions based on your strategic plan. If
your system doesn’t allow for projections, create an Excel document similar
to Figure 13-3 and Figure 13-4.
Your financial projections include forecasting out all three of your financial
statements. Produce projections by month for year one and then by year for
the next two years. Follow these steps:
1. Project the income statement.
Use the estimated revenue for each target market group that you deter-
mined in the section “Estimating Revenue and Expenses.” Plug in the
expenses and operating expenses as well, and use all three figures to
determine your net profit (hopefully) or loss. See Figure 13-3.
2. Project the balance sheet.
As sales go up, so do other areas of the business — variable assets
(accounts receivable, inventory and equipment), variable liabilities
(accounts payable and accrued expenses) and (hopefully) net income.
If your net income plus the increase in variable liabilities equals or
exceeds the increase in variable assets, the company has the resources
to finance itself. If not, you must bring in additional debt or equity. Use
your current balance sheet to determine the various asset and liability
accounts in your business.
3. Project cash flows.
Using the information in Steps 1 and 2, project how these numbers
impact your cash flow, paying special attention to how much new debt
or equity you need to inject into the business and when to inject it. See
Figure 13-4.
Like much of the work you’ve done up until now, creating financial projec-
tions isn’t an easy task. But don’t skip this exercise or you miss an important
part of developing a sound strategy.
Undoubtedly, one of your financial goals is to increase your sales and prof-
itability. After you’ve completed your projections, even if they’re rough,
double-check to make sure that your goals match up with your numbers. The
financials tell you what goals to keep and what to cut. Keep the goals with a
positive story. Revised the ones with a negative ending.

Securing Funds for Your Strategic Plan
Did your financial assessment determine that you need outside investing to
finance your strategic plan and your resulting growth? Before you dash off to
the bank, review the tips in the following sections.
Find the correct financing product
When most business people think about financing, they immediately go to
bankers or venture capitalists. But in today’s capital markets, there’s a wide
variety of lending alternatives. You want to get the right financing product for
your specific capital needs. In order to meet your capital needs, first follow
these important steps:
 Do your research. Take the time to discover the many different types of
financing available in today’s capital markets. Identify the type of lender
that fits your industry, company, and financing needs, and then focus
your efforts in that area. Identify about 100 lenders and work your way
down to a final short list.
 Be 100 percent certain about your financing needs. Make sure that
your financial projections are accurate and not a wild guess. You want to
know the exact framework of your financing needs before approaching
the capital markets for financial assistance.

Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

 Get outside help. The money spent to hire an experienced professional
who can help craft your financial projections and find the right type of
financing pays for itself. If you want to go it alone, have someone else
review your finances and challenge your assumptions.
Minimize your risk
Growth carries enough risk on its own. Don’t add to it by jumping into the
wrong type of financing. You want to minimize risk through several different
avenues:
 Look for lenders willing to structure flexible agreements. Normally,
you won’t find major banks that are willing to structure flexible agree-
ments. Typically, state or local banks are going to be more willing to
work with you because they are smaller and are more relationship-
oriented. Because of their local emphasis, they are more likely to work
with you to structure a flexible deal. But be aware that you have to
knock on a lot of doors to find the agreement that works for you. Don’t
be disheartened by the first no.
 Avoid agreements filled with restrictive covenants. Covenants are
additional causes in the contract to protect the bank and limit the busi-
ness and some of its activities. For example, if your strategic plan has to
do with launching a new product line and you are seeking financing to
get it off the ground, the bank may restrict the loan to just the launch,
which means you can’t use the money for anything else. If another
opportunity comes along, you might be stuck. Some covenants are also
written to require that you maintain the same staff or personal for the
life of the loan. Clearly, this could be a problem with staff turnover and
other life changes.
 Build in a cushion in case things go wrong. A cushion is a compensat-
ing balance, which is borrowing slightly more than you need and keep-
ing it in a rainy day account. A compensating balance is a good business
practice and can protect you from seasonality, economic swings, and
other changes to the business climate.
 Don’t take out a second lien on your house, give any kind of personal
guarantee, or give up control of your company. Many financing trans-
actions require you to give up some equity in exchange for the money.
Some equity is okay, but if you have to give up majority control to grow
your company, don’t do the deal. Obviously, if you give up control, you
are no longer the owner of your business. The best way to avoid giving
up control is to create competition for your deal, meaning find more
than one financing opportunity.
255
Chapter 13: Putting Your Plan Together

 Never give away opportunities to protect yourself. Try to ensure that
whatever collateral is securing the loan is all the bank gets to satisfy the
loan in case of a default. You don’t want to find yourself in a situation
where the bank is taking other assets to satisfy the lending agreement.
 Make sure your strategic plan is bulletproof. Put together a strategic
plan that describes everything you’ll do in the next five years. Make it
clear and compelling so lenders can understand it, react to it in a short
period of time, and make a proposal to you. Additionally, everything in
your plan has to add up. Your projected increase in sales, for example,
needs to be supported by good market research and an action plan sup-
porting that assumption.
Adjust your lending agreement
When lending institutions create loan packages, they typically discount your
performance projections and increase their compensation through additional
fees or equity. In most cases, you can’t avoid this discounting because
lenders need some way to protect themselves. However, you can negotiate a
performance clause that adjusts the terms should you achieve your objec-
tives in the agreement.
When you first walk in to the bank, you have no track record and no standing.
However, after several months or years, you establish a solid track record
proving you’re a good risk. You want the opportunity to adjust your lending
agreement after you’ve proven yourself because you want to decrease the
cost of the loan as the perceived risk level decreases. If your lender refuses to
consider this option, shop around for a different lender.
Think big
Plan your borrowing based on your company’s potential, not on your current
capital position. Project how much you need to grow the company to its full
potential and strive to get the best financing with the least risk, the least dilu-
tion, and fairest transaction terms.
A few great resources to locate additional information about the 
complicated world of financing include www.businessfinance.com and
www.vfinance.com.

Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Evaluating Your Strategic Plan
Now that your plan is all together in one place, it’s time to step back and eval-
uate. Did you create the strategy you intended to create? More than likely,
you and your team have put a lot of time into the document you now have in
front of you. Put it away for a week and don’t look at it. No peeking! After
working on this document for months, it’s easy to get so close to the plan
that you miss obvious flaws (called the not-seeing-the-forest-for-the-trees 
syndrome).
When you pick your plan back up, reread it and answer these questions:
 Does your plan connect your mission to your vision? Make sure all of
your goals and strategies align with your vision and supporting your
mission. If there are outliers, modify or delete them. You want all of your
energy focused on reaching your vision.
 Is your plan realistic? Overplanning is a common problem. Consider
pushing some deadlines out further than you originally anticipated.
 Is your plan integrated? Make sure that all the elements of your plan
support each other. (See “Visualizing your plan with a strategy map,”
later in this chapter for information on developing a strategy map to
help answer this question.)
 Is your plan balanced? You developed your plan using the Balanced
Scorecard Framework introduced in Chapter 12. Make sure that you
have a good balance between financial, customer, internal business
process, and employee and learning goals.
 Is the plan complete? Identify any holes in your plan or potential activi-
ties that are unsupported.
 Is the document clear? It’s easy to write down an action item or a goal
that makes sense in the moment, but making sure that the action makes
sense in six months is crucial. Make sure every statement is explicit so
everyone knows what’s intended.
Visualizing your plan with a strategy map
Seeing your whole strategic plan — the relationships and dependencies —
can be difficult, but it’s necessary to make sure that your company sees the
big picture. Unlike financial plans, with income statements, balance sheets,
and cash flow statements, there are no common or uniform elements for
describing a company’s strategic plan. That’s where a strategy map may
come in handy.
257
Chapter 13: Putting Your Plan Together

The creators of the Balanced Scorecard created the idea of a strategy map.
Strategy maps aren’t tools for creating strategy; they only describe strategies.
A strategy map has several purposes:
 To evaluate and make visually explicit the organization’s perspectives,
strategic objectives, and goals
 To visualize the fundamental relationships between each goal
 To connect employee learning and internal processes to customer value
and financial goals
A benefit of strategy maps is everyone from the top of the ranks to the
bottom can see how they fit into the company. In fact, you can color code the
different goals by the department that’s responsible to show how each
department fits into the overall direction. See Figure 13-5 for an example of a
strategy map and how to read it and evaluate your strategy. You’re looking
for linkages and interdependences. If you have an unsupported goal, it won’t
be achieved. You should be able to draw at least one arrow between one goal
and the next.
Look at Figure 13-5 as you read the example below. This company can estab-
lish the link between high profits and improved sales training as follows:
 If we improve our technical and service skills by sending our staff to
continued education classes at least once a year, our staff continues to
be highly trained.
 If our staff is highly trained, they become problem solvers instead of
order takers.
 If they’re problem solvers, we’re increasing the perceived value for ser-
vices provided by regularly adding value to our customers.
 If we continue to add value to the services we provide, revenue
increases through improved sales.
Every goal doesn’t need to link to every other goal. But you do need to make
sure that there are no outliers. For example, if your goal is to increase overall
efficiencies, but you don’t list a goal for time management or productivity
training or improving your internal process, you won’t increase efficiency.
Naturally, just stating something doesn’t mean that it happens.

Mapping your strategy
Creating a strategy map is more art than science. Of course, strategies are as
individual as companies, so you can modify the guidelines to map your strat-
egy. As you try to map your strategy, check out Figure 13-5 — it provides a
great framework.
Create your strategy map on a piece of paper and sticky notes first, and then
transferring the notes into a Word document, using the draw toolbar or a
graphic layout program. Use the steps below as a guide to create your map,
but don’t feel you have to follow them exactly.
1. Write your vision statement at the top of the page.
2. Draw four horizontal rectangles — one for each of the four perspec-
tives of your organization: financial, customer, internal business
processes, and employee learning — stacked on top of each other
underneath your vision.
3. Place your three-year goals in the top area of each perspective the
objective is associated with.
Space the goals out so you have enough room for the next step.
4. Put your one-year goals on individual sticky notes or in circles under-
neath each associated three-year goal.
Make sure that the one-year goal supports the three-year goal that it’s
under. If not, move it to where it does fit.
5. After all the goals are on your map, draw arrows between the goals to
indicate the cause and effect relationship between them.
A great way to start this is to look at your financial goal and ask what
causes the goal to happen. Go through this type of questioning for each
goal except in the area of employee learning because everything stems
from your employees.
6. Take a hard look at your strategy map to make sure that there are no
unsupported goals and that they are all integrated.
Congratulations! You now have a strategy map for your organization.
Making Your Plan a Living Document
The bane of any and all strategic plans is that they sit on a shelf and collect
dust. Don’t entomb your outstanding business strategy in a three-ring binder.
Make your plan a living document by using parts of the plan for different
audiences. Your audiences may include, but aren’t limited to, your board,
260
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

management team, employees, and banks. You also have different functions
in your organization that need different pieces to the plan. For example, a
department only needs the goals and action plans assigned to it. The same is
true for individuals. Here is a list of different ways to break up your plan to
make it a living document:
 The complete version: This document has everything and anything you
developed in your strategic planning process. (Yes, the kitchen sink too!)
This includes all the parts listed in the section “Assembling Your
Strategic Plan,” plus all the support material you collected such as
market research, employee assessments, customer surveys, and so on.
Keep all information in one centralized location so you can pull from it
in your next planning sessions.
 The board version: The board version is best suited for boards and
includes just the high-level stuff such as the mission, vision, values,
strategic objectives, and goals. Exclude the measures, responsible per-
sons, action plans, and so on.
 The bank version: Banks want a complete strategic plan as well as a nar-
rative description and hard numbers. This version should include
• A complete set of financial projections
• A one-page executive summary
• Bios of key management and staff
• A list of key customers or accounts
• An explanation of financing needs with supporting assumptions
 The management version: A management version of your strategic plan
should be your scorecard. Your scorecard periodically tracks the key
performance indicators. As the key performance indicators are tied to
goals, your management knows whether you’re on strategy. Use those
tracking numbers to produce charts and graphs that quickly provide
executives with a dashboard of your performance.
 The communication version: Strategic planning is as much about articu-
lating a strategic direction as it is getting your staff pulling in the same
direction. Communicate your strategic plan through your strategy map.
Post the map in the breakroom or another common area so people are
continually reminded of the corporate direction.
 The department version: For department managers to implement their
portion of the strategic plan, the corporate plan needs to be translated
to a department plan. See Chapter 14 for more information.
 The individual version: Like with the department mangers, individuals
need to know exactly what they’re responsible for so they can act
accordingly. Creating an individual action sheet, which lists an
employee’s goals and action items, is a great implementation tool. You
can use the same sheet as a reporting tool for employees to keep man-
agers informed on their progress.
261
Chapter 13: Putting Your Plan Together

You probably don’t need all these versions, and you may have some special
versions based on your company’s needs. Either way, you can see how much
easier implementing your plan is when employees have the information they
need to execute. By creating these different versions, you won’t see your plan
collecting dust!
As you make use of various sections of the document, make sure that you
don’t end up with a set of independent strategic plans. Always make sure that
all versions point back to the master document. MyStrategicPlan.com was
created by my company to avoid just the issue of versioning and to make it
easier to implement a plan by giving people in your organization the parts of
the plan they are responsible for.

How to avoid going broke
A recent survey found that 54 percent of all
companies filing for bankruptcy are experienc-
ing record sales levels in the days and weeks
before closing their doors. In most cases, these
companies are on a positive growth curve in all
areas of their business: hiring new people, gen-
erating new business, and ramping up with sup-
pliers. What happened? They ran out of cash.
Take the Tour de Nez, a small local cycling race.
It was started 13 years ago by Tim Healion,
owner of Reno’s first coffeehouse Deux Gros
Nez, to celebrate the restaurant’s anniversary.
Over the years, the event has grown from a
bunch of revelers riding bikes to a pro cycling
event with eight different races. With the
growth also came the pre-event expenses.
Although Tim was experiencing national recog-
nition and wild success, the financial viability of
the race became more and more dire. For a
while, the coffeehouse profits were used to
finance cash shortfalls. But eventually, the
event’s cash demands became even too much
to finance internally. The result? Tim narrowly
avoiding going broke this year through some big
sponsorship sales. But next year presents the
same issues again. His accounts payables con-
tinually outpace his accounts receivable, no
matter how successful the event is.
How do you avoid growing broke? Protect your
balance sheet at all costs. Most businesses
owners get caught up in the income statement
showing growth in sales. But it’s easy to over-
look how this growth impacts the balance
sheet. Most of the cash in the business is actu-
ally generated and consumed on the balance
sheet (by buying inventory, carrying receiv-
ables, paying off creditors, and buying fixed
assets). Therefore, any time sales go up, it has
an immediate and direct impact on both cash
flow and the balance sheet. Understanding
these relationships holds the key to surviving
rapid sales growth.

I
mplementation is the process that turns strategies and plans into actions
in order to accomplish strategic objectives and goals. Implementing your
strategic plan is as important, or even more important, than your strategy.
The critical actions move a strategic plan from a document that sits on the
shelf to actions that drive business growth. Sadly, the majority of companies
who have strategic plans fail to implement them. According to a Fortune
cover story in 1999, nine out of ten organizations fail to implement their
strategic plan for many reasons:
 60 percent of organizations don’t link strategy to budgeting
 75 percent of organizations don’t link employee incentives to strategy
 86 percent of business owners and managers spend less than one hour
per month discussing strategy
 95 percent of a typical workforce doesn’t understand their organization’s
strategy.
A strategic plan provides a business with the roadmap it needs to pursue a
specific strategic direction and set of performance goals, deliver customer
value, and be successful. However, this is just a plan; it doesn’t guarantee
that the desired performance is reached any more than having a roadmap
guarantees the traveler arrives at the desired destination.
In this chapter, you look at how to set up successful implementation, hold
your team accountable, and create a process to monitor and adapt your plan.

Getting Ready for Implementation
For those businesses that have a plan in place, wasting time and energy on
the planning process and then not implementing the plan is very discourag-
ing. Although the topic of implementation may not be the most exciting thing
to talk about, it’s a fundamental business practice that’s critical for any strat-
egy to take hold. The strategic plan addresses the what and why of activities,
but implementation addresses the who, where, when, and how. The fact is
that both are critical to success. In fact, companies can gain competitive
advantage through implementation if done effectively.
In the following sections, you discover how to get support for your complete
implementation plan and how to avoid some common mistakes.
Avoiding the pitfalls
In this section, I’ve provided you with a list of lessons I learned the hard way.
Because you want your plan to succeed, heed the advice here and stay away
from the pitfalls of implementing your strategic plan.
Here are the most common reasons strategic plans fail:
 Lack of ownership: The most common reason a plan fails is lack of own-
ership. If people don’t have a stake and responsibility in the plan, it’ll be
business as usual for all but a frustrated few.
 Lack of communication: The plan doesn’t get communicated to employ-
ees, and they don’t understand how they contribute.
 Getting mired in the day-to-day: Owners and managers, consumed by
daily operating problems, lose sight of long-term goals.
 Out of the ordinary: The plan is treated as something separate and
removed from the management process.
 An overwhelming plan: The goals and actions generated in the strate-
gic planning session are too numerous because the team failed to make
tough choices to eliminate non-critical actions. Employees don’t know
where to begin.
 A meaningless plan: The vision, mission, and value statements are
viewed as fluff and not supported by actions or don’t have employee
buy-in.
 Annual strategy: Strategy is only discussed at yearly weekend retreats.
 Not considering implementation: Implementation isn’t discussed in the
strategic planning process. The planning document is seen as an end in
itself.
264
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

 No progress report: There’s no method to track progress, and the plan
only measures what’s easy, not what’s important. No one feels any for-
ward momentum.
 No accountability: Accountability and high visibility help drive change.
This means that each measure, objective, data source, and initiative
must have an owner.
 Lack of empowerment: Although accountability may provide strong
motivation for improving performance, employees must also have the
authority, responsibility, and tools necessary to impact relevant mea-
sures. Otherwise, they may resist involvement and ownership.
It’s easier to avoid pitfalls when they’re clearly identified. Now that you know
what they are, you’re more likely to jump right over them!
Covering all your bases
As a business owner, executive, or department manager, your job entails
making sure you’re set up for a successful implementation. Before you start
this process, evaluate your strategic plan and how you may implement it by
answering a few questions to keep yourself in check. Take a moment to hon-
estly answer the following questions:
 How committed are you to implementing the plan to move your com-
pany forward?
 How do you plan to communicate the plan throughout the company?
 Are there sufficient people who have a buy-in to drive the plan forward?
 How are you going to motivate your people?
 Have you identified internal processes that are key to driving the plan
forward?
 Are you going to commit money, resources, and time to support
the plan?
 What are the roadblocks to implementing and supporting the plan?
 How will you take available resources and achieve maximum results
with them?
You don’t need to have the perfect answers to all these questions right now,
but just make sure that you’ve given all the questions equal consideration.
You don’t want to look back six months from now, and wish you had identified
some big issues that are now threatening your success. If you’ve identified
some red flags, assess if they’re huge obstacles or small ones. If they’re big,
get them out of the way before you implement, even if it means pushing your
timeline out for awhile.
265
Chapter 14: Putting Your Plan to Work

Making sure you have the support
Often overlooked are the five key components necessary to support imple-
mentation: people, resources, structure, systems, and culture. All compo-
nents must be in place in order to move from creating the plan to activating
the plan.
All hands on deck: People
The first stage of implementing your plan is to make sure to have the right
people on board. The right people include those folks with required compe-
tencies and skills that are needed to support the plan. In the months follow-
ing the planning process, expand employee skills through training,
recruitment, or new hires to include new competencies required by the
strategic plan.
Show me the money: Resources
You need to have sufficient funds and enough time to support implementa-
tion. Often, true costs are underestimated or not identified. True costs can
include a realistic time commitment from staff to achieve a goal, a clear iden-
tification of expenses associated with a tactic, or unexpected cost overruns
by a vendor. Additionally, employees must have enough time to implement
what may be additional activities that they aren’t currently performing.
If you build it, they will come: Structure
Set your structure of management and appropriate lines of authority, and
have clear, open lines of communication with your employees. A plan owner
and regular strategy meetings are the two easiest ways to put a structure in
place. Meetings to review the progress should be scheduled monthly or quar-
terly, depending on the level of activity and time frame of the plan.
Plug it in, turn it on: Systems
Both management and technology systems help track the progress of the
plan and make it faster to adapt to changes. As part of the system, build mile-
stones into the plan that must be achieved within a specific time frame. A
scorecard is one tool used by many organizations that incorporates progress
tracking and milestones. See the section “Keeping Score of Your Progress”
later in this chapter for info on how to create a scorecard for your company.
Make yourself at home: Culture
Create an environment that connects employees to the organization’s mis-
sion and that makes them feel comfortable. To reinforce the importance of
focusing on strategy and vision, reward success. Develop some creative posi-
tive and negative consequences for achieving or not achieving the strategy.
The rewards may be big or small, as long as they lift the strategy above the
day-to-day so people make it a priority.
266
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Determining your plan of attack
Implementing your plan includes several different pieces. Implementing a
plan can sometimes feel like it needs another plan of its own. But you don’t
need to go to that extent because I’ve done it for you! Use the steps below as
your base implementation plan. Modify it to make it your own timeline and fit
your organization’s culture and structure. What follows is a set of comprehen-
sive implementation steps:
1. Finalize your strategic plan after obtaining input from all invested
parties.
2. Align your budget to annual goals based on your financial assessment,
especially if you’re funding the plan.
3. Produce the various versions of your plan for each group (see
Chapter 13 for ideas on how to use different parts of your plan for
employees, management, and your board).
4. Establish your scorecard system for tracking and monitoring your
plan (see section “Keeping Score of Your Progress” later in this 
chapter).
5. Establish your performance management and reward system.
6. Roll out your plan to the whole organization (see “Rolling out the
plan” below for roll-out ideas).
7. Build all department annual plans around the corporate plan (see
Chapter 16 for more departmental information).
8. Set up monthly strategy meetings with established reporting to moni-
tor your progress.
9. Set up annual strategic review dates, including new assessments and a
large group meeting for an annual plan review.
Communicate, Communicate,
Communicate
Good communication unlocks many organizational mysteries, so it’s not sur-
prising that communicating your business strategy is critical to your success.
When the owner, executives, and managers continually demonstrate the link
between strategy and specific business decisions, staff members are encour-
aged to think strategically as well. After the initial goal setting process is
complete, devise a plan for communicating those goals. Your communication
plan falls into these three categories, which are explained in the sections
below:
267
Chapter 14: Putting Your Plan to Work

 Don’t wait until the plan is close to completion to start talking about
it. Obtain feedback and get buy-in from employees early on in the
process. By facilitating upfront communication, you head off any resis-
tance later on.
 Roll out the plan when you feel it is as close as it’ll be to completion.
Consistently communicate the plan to everyone in the organization.
 Continue to communicate how the execution of your plan is going.
This keeps the plan top of mind and everyone committed to achieving
the goals.
In a recent budgeting process in Washoe County, Nevada, one of the county
commissioners required that every budget request support the organiza-
tion’s strategic priorities. Now that’s top level commitment! All the depart-
ments quickly figured out to match their initiatives up with the strategy.
Making sure everyone buys in
Don’t assume that individuals will automatically buy in to your plan. What
may seem clear to the planning team may not be clear to those not as
involved in the strategy development. Give employees an opportunity to get
involved on the back end of the process by setting up a feedback mechanism
such as a brown-bag lunch, a suggestion box, or one-on-one meetings, so they
have a chance to respond as well.
By gathering and responding to feedback, you facilitate employee buy-in and
build a broader understanding of the organization’s goals and objectives. If
you don’t get people to buy into the plan, the plan may ultimately fail. You
can also take it a step further and share the strategic plan with other stake-
holders like investors, customers, alliance partners, vendors, and so on. An
open approach can generate more helpful ideas and suggestions about the
future of your business.
Rolling out the plan
Rolling out your plan can range anywhere from a big high-profile campaign to
a low-key announcement. Whatever you decide to do, make sure that every-
one in your organization is informed. Certain groups of stakeholders may get
complete copies of the plan, including background material in appendixes,
whereas other groups may receive only the body of the plan without its
appendixes.
268
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Here are a few tips for involving people in your plan and having a successful
rollout:
 Consider an annual state of the union message where the finalized plan
and vision are rolled out to the entire organization.
 Make the announcement exciting and get everyone engaged!
 Every board member and executive needs a full copy of the plan.
 Distribute all of the plan, or at the very least the highlights, to everyone
in the organization.
 Post your one-page plan or strategy map in a break area or another
common area.
 Consider giving each employee a card with the mission, vision, and
values statements printed on it.
 Incorporate your strategic plan into the orientation process for new
board members and employees.
 Include portions of the plan in policies and procedures, including the
employee manual.
 Provide copies of the plan for key partners such as funders/investors,
business coaches, vendors/suppliers, and so on.
Continuing communication
Launching goals with a major rollout isn’t enough. Goals must be visible, and
repeated, to keep the commitment alive. Why not have some fun with your
ongoing communication? There are plenty of creative ways to keep your
employees up to speed on the status of the plan. Taking it one step further,
you can reinforce goals without coming across as a nag by adding humor,
inspiring quotes, and customized encouragement to the messages. You can’t
say “thank you” enough: Keep that in mind when goals are attained.
Here are just a few ways to ensure ongoing communication:
 In monthly e-mail messages
 At “surprise” coffee breaks
 On computers as screen savers
 In envelopes with paychecks
 In company newsletters or e-letters
269
Chapter 14: Putting Your Plan to Work

 On the bulletin board in a common area
 Through your company blog
 Through your intranet
One client of mine dedicates a whole room to ongoing communication,
dubbed the war room. The room includes anything and everything about the
company’s strategy. On one wall is a timeline with sticky notes that display
all the different goals and their deadlines. Another wall contains charts and
graphs of the company’s key performance indicators from the scorecard. And
yet another wall contains space for brainstorming and contributing to key
strategic issues at hand. The wall also contains an area for capturing items
that are hard to measure such as innovative ideas, customer complaints and
compliments, and employee training schedules. The room is updated
monthly, and anyone in the organization can walk in and see what’s happen-
ing with the business.
Holding People Accountable 
(Including Yourself)
Accountability is key to successful implementation — hands down. If you and
your team don’t have to report to anyone on your progress, the plan may find
itself further and further down your to-do list or at the bottom of your stacks
of paper. You don’t need an elaborate accountability system, but you do need
something.
One of the most important pieces to successful implementation is you. In
addition to your strategic plan manager (covered in the next section), find
someone to hold you accountable — a business coach, an executive group, a
colleague, an outside consultant, or anyone else who’s outside of your busi-
ness who advises you.
Don’t forget to discuss the consequences for non-performance with your
team. Just like rewards, consequences are critical in any action plan. Often,
the consequences are removal from the team that’s working on the goals.
Peer pressure creates such an intense expectation of performance that it
causes action, so hold monthly strategy meetings where everyone has to
publicly report on their progress. If you had to give a report in front of your
peers, you’d have your act together, right? Just the thought of humiliating
yourself in front of the team for non-performance may make you sick to your
stomach.
270
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

In the next few sections, you find out about appointing a strategic plan man-
ager, paying for performance, and coaching for success. All of these ideas
have been tested, and they really work.
Appointing a strategic plan manager
Charge a key staff member with the responsibility of overseeing implementa-
tion of most aspects of the strategic plan. This person is the strategic plan
manager or engineer. This individual makes sure that processes are running
on schedule and monitors other staff who are responsible for meeting specific
goals. He is also responsible for providing monthly reports and facilitating
your strategy meetings. In my experience, without a manager, all the good
ideas in the world won’t go anywhere.
Feel like you need to find a taskmaster? You’ve got it! A strategic plan man-
ager’s job description should read like this:
 The individual needs to have enough respect in the organization to keep
you and everyone else on top of their responsibilities.
 The manager understands the strategic planning process and the strate-
gic plan itself.
 The manager has a good understanding of the business or organization.
Ideally, this person has the ability to get along with everyone.
 This person has good attention to detail and is deadline-oriented.
Oh, and by the way, the manager can’t be you — the business owner or 
executive. You have enough other stuff to worry about.
Paying for performance
A common trend in compensation plans is to pay for performance. No doubt
about it; people pay attention when it comes to their own pocket books.
Linking performance to short-term goals and action items in your strategic
plan is a natural connection. Performance-based compensation is a huge way
to structure performance plans. Check out Inc. Magazine’s compensation
guide at www.inc.com/guides/hr for ideas on compensation.
Although linking pay to performance is a good way to ensure your plan gets
implemented, it’s not the only factor. For additional ideas, check out the side-
bar at the end of this chapter, “Creating a strategy-focused organization.”
271
Chapter 14: Putting Your Plan to Work

Here are some best practices to make your incentive plan as successful as
possible:
 Tie incentives to corporate results, team results, and individual perfor-
mance, where appropriate.
 Fit the compensation plan in with your core values and culture.
 Simplify a complicated plan so everyone, regardless of education level,
can understand it.
 Communicate your incentive plan as much as possible.
 Involve employees in the process by sending out an employee survey
before you structure your plan to see what they’re looking for.
 Shell out incentives in the form of cash, time off, company perks, group
outings, and so on. Don’t be tightfisted: Outstanding results can come
from a history of outstanding rewards.
 Get your employees energized about the incentive plan by making the
plan exciting and motivational.
 Share financial and business plans with employees and provide educa-
tion if they don’t understand financial issues.
 Don’t expect attitudes and behaviors to change overnight: Implementing
an incentive program involves a long-term process, not a one-time event.
Remember the purpose of incentive plans is to change behavior and move
your whole organization as a team toward your vision. Make sure that your
incentive plans clearly link performance to business goals. That link exists to
ensure that you reward only those behaviors that lead to accomplishing your
business goals.
Coaching for achievement
Think about your favorite Olympic athlete. Do you think the athlete’s goal is
foremost on her mind every day? You bet it is. That’s why it’s your job and
your manager’s job to act as a coach to get Olympic-level performances out
of all your people.
In addition to focusing on the goal, Olympic athletes are incredibly disci-
plined. Implementing goals that were set months ago is no different. It
requires that same level of commitment and discipline.

Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

This is where you and your managers need to lead rather than fight fires and
do detail work. By acting as a coach, use the strategic plan as your frame-
work to guide your team to high performance. What do coaches do?
 Encourage: Everyone needs to feel like they’re doing a good job and are
appreciated for their hard work. Coaches say encouraging words to their
team to keep them motivated and engaged.
 Support: Without the right skills and resources for the job, no amount of
prodding and pushing will get it done. Coaches support their teams by
making sure they have the training, knowledge, and ability to complete
the task.
 Yell at the right time: Just like athletic coaches know when to yell, man-
agers need to know when to “push” their team when they need it. A
good coach knows when performance is lagging and when to turn on the
pressure.
 Bring out the best: Seeing the strengths and weaknesses of your team
allows you to bring out the best in your staff. Coaches know how to
make you the best you can be.
 Monitor performance: Keeping track of how everyone is performing is
another trait of a good coach. With your SMART goals (covered
in Chapter 12), you can assist your employee in creating an action 
plan if it isn’t already established and keep them on the path toward
achieving it. Meet with the employee regularly to discuss the status of
goal accomplishment.
Coach your team when there are setbacks or roadblocks. Coach your team
for success by recognizing and rewarding employees for achievements.
Keeping Score of Your Progress
To help monitor your strategic plan, one of the best tools around is the
Balanced Scorecard (introduced in Chapter 12). Keep in mind that the score-
card is to be used as both a measurement and management tool to assist in
fulfilling your company’s vision. Think of it as an instrument panel guiding
your company toward achieving an integrated single strategy. With it, you
can actively track progress toward your goals. You can use it to make your
company more strategy-focused and deliver demonstrable performance that
is aligned with your vision and mission. Note that the scorecard uses the
term measures to refer to numbers that you track regularly. These are also
known as key performance indicators and metrics.
273
Chapter 14: Putting Your Plan to Work

Building your scorecard
Although scorecards are very effective, they can also be daunting. For your
first crack at this, consider just building your scorecard for high-priority
goals. Identify the top seven to ten goals and associated measures that are
most important to your company this year. Then follow these steps to build
your scorecard. In the following years, consider building a scorecard that
monitors all of your goals:
1. Identify the right measures.
Most of your short-term goals should have measures associated with
each one. You build your scorecard off of these measures. But just
because you picked a measure to track a goal doesn’t mean that it’s a
good measure. Work with the measures for several months. If you see
that some are meaningless or to hard to track, dump them and find new
ones. See Chapter 12 for examples.
2. Establish increments that mesh with the targets.
In addition to getting the right measures, make sure to get the right time
frame and size of measures. For example, if you’re target is a ten percent
increase in sales over the year, break the target down to a monthly
number. For ease of tracking, try to use the same increments for all your
measures. If you’re reporting monthly, use monthly measures.
3. Identify the data source.
Clearly identify where the monthly number is coming from and who’s
responsible for reporting on it. Without easy access to numbers, you
find yourself doing a ton of extra busy work. If you can’t get access to a
data source or there’s no data source, find a new measure.
4. Input numbers monthly.
Enter numbers every month for each measure. Use the Year to Date
column to track your running progress. This column should add up or
average all the months entered to date.
5. See the big picture.
The primary purpose of key indicators is to give you a big-picture look
at the business with a relatively small amount of information. If you
aren’t seeing the big picture, change the measures. A great way to get a
visual is to produce a chart or graph for each measure.
6. Take action.
Taking action means doing it in a timely manner. The whole point of
using a scorecard is to make adjustments to the business now and on
time, before it’s too late. Your strategy meetings should easily facilitate
this process.
274
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

The easiest way to build your scorecard is to use the framework from Figure
14-1 in an Excel spreadsheet. Make it part of the strategic plan manager’s job
to provide a monthly scorecard report. See the next section, “Using a score-
card to measure progress,” for a streamlined reporting process.
Using a scorecard to measure progress
Using your scorecard should be a step-by-step process in your organization.
The following list provides steps in the process for using your card (If you
don’t have multiple departments, ignore the department references):
1. Provide each department or individual with their respective 
scorecards.
2. On a monthly basis, have each individual or department collect its
data based on the specific measurement for each goal.
3. Have each department or individual summarize the data collected for
each measurement on their department or corporate scorecard.
4. Direct any questions to the strategic plan manager.
5. Have each department or individual submit individual scorecards to
the strategic plan manager for the month.
6. Have the strategic plan manager update the overall organizational
scorecard with the numbers from the department or individual 
scorecards.
7. Have each strategic plan manager report the status of the overall
organizational and department scorecards at the monthly strategy
meeting, or have each department head report the status on his own.

Holding effective strategy meetings
A monthly strategy staff meeting is critical to making the numbers and
achieving company strategic goals. The meeting gives the company the 
ability to manage the activities that drive future results and to hold people
accountable for making sure those activities happen. By using the key mea-
surements, you can make key course corrections each month. And if top
management attends the meeting each week, their presence creates visibility
and recognition for the people getting things done. They also know that
senior management is regularly paying attention to their actions.
So you’re holding these meetings and they need to be effective, but how do
you make your meetings more effective? Check out the following tips:
 Schedule the monthly strategy meetings on the same day and at the
same time each month.
 Invite individuals or heads of each department.
 Make the meeting mandatory — no exceptions.
 The meeting should last no more than 30 minutes.
 Start and end on time and stay on task with an agenda.
Your meetings are designed for individuals and department heads to give a
quick report on where they stand in regards to the measurements identified
on their scorecard. Restrict the meeting to reporting on measurements and
nothing else, so you can stay on task and remain within the 30-minute time
limit. By following this process, everyone on the management team knows
exactly where the company stands in terms of key measurements.
If problems arise, convene a separate task force team meeting immediately
afterwards. Task force team meetings should last no more than 30 minutes,
too, and include only those people who are directly responsible for the mea-
surements or those who can contribute to resolving the problem. The pri-
mary purpose of this meeting is to brainstorm ideas and give the appropriate
department heads some fresh thinking on how to approach the problem.
Everyone puts their best ideas on the table and the manager in charge goes
back and decides which ideas to implement. The following month the depart-
ment head reports back to the task force team on the actions they took to
resolve the issue.

Keeping Your Plan Working for You
A strategic plan needs to be adaptive to survive changing or unanticipated
conditions. A business that develops and executes a strategic plan gains sig-
nificantly from the experience, and starting with a working model and achiev-
ing a tangible plan can be more successful for your business than having no
plan at all.
Over the life of a strategic plan, a company’s vision and mission often remain
the same, but its goals and objectives probably need to be revised.
Depending on the industry, some businesses can maintain a strategic plan for
a year or longer, whereas others have to respond to market changes more fre-
quently. Move ahead with the plan as established, but be prepared to let go
and switch strategies as necessary. Corrective actions need to be taken
quickly to compensate for the dynamic business environment most busi-
nesses operate within. In today’s ever-changing business environment, who
has the time to stop and figure things out? No one. You adapt on the fly and
so should your plan.
Change: The only constant
Two caterpillars are conversing and a beautiful butterfly floats by.
One caterpillar turns and says to the other,
“You’ll never get me up on one of those butterfly things.”
277
Chapter 14: Putting Your Plan to Work
How ‘bout some reports to go with that scorecard?
For the past two years, a large manufacturing
company has used a process whereby each
department head turns in a one-page monthly
summary linked to the comprehensive corpo-
rate strategy. These summaries include the
department scorecard and reports of perfor-
mance on strategy. The reports also explain
how well the company’s progressing with the
defined action plans, what obstacles exist, and
what can be improved.
At a monthly meeting, the company starts by
defining a series of actionable items based on
the monthly reports. From there, action plans
are developed and reported back on the one-
page summary reports.
The CEO feels the benefits are usually quite sub-
stantial. After all, when action items are consis-
tently elevated, department heads know they’re
responsible for implementing the items as effi-
ciently as possible (that’s called work peer pres-
sure). The department heads appreciate this
process because it raises the bar for everyone
and keeps their staff focused on the right things.

What a powerful, and fun, parable about change. Change, even though we
often resist it, is inevitable. In fact, your strategic planning process may trig-
ger changes in your own organization, either in terms of the work done or in
the internal structuring of the work. No matter how you present it, people
struggle with change. They may need help accepting and adapting positively
to the changes, though. That’s where you come in.
Determining which changes require action and which require monitoring is
the responsibility of you and your management team. When change is
needed, take the following steps:
1. Make sure everyone understands the change and why it’s necessary.
Even if people have been part of the strategic planning process, they
may need the implications of decisions explained to them afterwards.
2. Respond to people’s ideas and feelings.
Let them express their concerns and respond to them. If you can’t agree,
at least be sympathetic about the feelings that are generated by change.
3. Develop a planned process of change.
Share the process with everyone in the organization or project, so
people know what to expect and when to expect it.

Learning Center online at www.change-management.com.
Adapting your plan as necessary
Never lose sight of the fact that strategic plans are guidelines not rules. It’s
fine to deviate from your plan, but you need to understand why you make a
course correction. Figure 14-2 gives a visual decision map to help you deter-
mine whether you need to adapt your plan.
Every three months or so, evaluate the plan implementation by asking these
key questions:
 Will the goals be achieved within the time frame of the plan? If not, why?
 Should the deadlines be modified? (Before you modify deadlines, figure
out why you’re behind schedule.)
 Are the goals and action items still realistic?
 Should the company’s focus be changed to put more focus on achieving
the goals?
278
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

 Should the goals be changed? (Be careful about making these changes —
know why efforts aren’t achieving the goals before changing the goals.)
 What can be gathered from this adaptation to improve future planning
activities?
Adapt your plan according. Always keep copies of past plans and include an
updated date in the footer of the document.
Remember that implementation is the most difficult part of the planning
process. No one factor listed above makes or breaks the successful imple-
mentation of the strategic plan. However, when these areas are considered
and acted on, the chances for successful implementation are greatly
improved. Most importantly, a business that has a strategic plan and imple-
ments it is ahead of 90 percent of the companies who have no plan at all.

Creating a strategy-focused organization
Organizations that are strategy-focused are
more effective with their resources, have higher
employee retention, and make more money
because they serve their markets better than
their counterparts. And they stay in business
longer because they proactively respond to the
environment around them. Want to create a cul-
ture that’s strategy-focused? Here’s a hit list of
ideas gathered from a bunch of different orga-
nizations to help create the organization:
 Be a strategic leader. Lead by example and
prioritize your strategic plan over everything
else. Stay committed.
 Cut out the jargon. Make sure everyone in
your organization really understands the plan.
 Hang your one-page strategic plan in the
break room or another central location.
 Involve your staff in the final development
of the plan. Ask for and use employee ideas.
 Create a “champion” or owner for every goal
and action. Make strategy everyone’s job.
 Ask your employees to create the action
items to support their assigned goals.
 Review the plan with management or the
group.
 Align the organization with the strategy.
 Use a scorecard to monitor progress
monthly.
 Schedule regular updates. Hold a monthly
meeting, one-on-one with the team leaders,
where you only discuss strategy. Hold a
quarterly full staff strategy meeting to report
on the progress.
 Challenge underlying assumptions. Revisit
and refine the strategic plan three months
from now.
 Hold yourself accountable through a mentor,
personal coach, or business organization.
 Link strategy to performance.
 Continually scan your environment to iden-
tify changes that may impact your strategy.
 Reward success! Throw a party when sig-
nificant goals are reached.

Chapter 15
Contingency Planning: Your Plan B
In This Chapter
 Identifying potential risks and threats facing your business
 Planning for business continuity
 Stepping into the future with scenario planning
You’re surrounded by circumstances and choices every day, and you
need to be ready. Readiness isn’t just about disaster preparedness; it’s
about being ready for opportunity, as well as adversity. Readiness is a lifestyle,
and any organization needs to prepare for all those little things that can go
wrong and that seem to add up when the time is right.
The first step to getting ready is focusing on what you want and then creating
a mental picture of what fulfills that desire. But a real barrier is procrastina-
tion. People often feel overwhelmed by trying to think of everything. Stop.
Take a breath. If you’re procrastinating, understand that worry is the source.
So ask yourself, “What is it about this task that concerns me?” and then 
make a list.
All the strategic planning in the world isn’t enough unless you have contin-
gencies in place. This chapter helps you identify what to prepare for when
business doesn’t go as planned. You’re not only preparing for unexpected
threats but also trying to foresee unanticipated opportunities. In the follow-
ing sections, you look at the risks of doing business and two types of contin-
gency planning — continuity planning and scenario planning — that help you
minimize your risks.
Facing Up to Real Business Risks
Conducting business in today’s world almost always involves some type of
risk. Consumer trends and habits change; new competitors enter the market;
external factors can create obstacles. In your planning, risk is best defined as

how you perceive the likelihood of suffering a loss. The perception of the
impact of a particular risk varies from person to person: A particular risk
may seem trivial to one person but catastrophic to another.
As you plan for your future, risk analysis and risk management can help you
make plans to better maneuver around obstacles. Assessing risks in advance
allows you to determine the most cost-effective strategies to handle each
type of risk.
Although this section may seem doomsdayish, don’t shy away from it. You’ve
put a lot of time, energy, and money into your business. Keeping it out of
harm’s way is just another step in the process.
Identifying common risks and 
threats you might face
The first stage of a risk analysis is identifying threats facing you in your inter-
nal and external environments that can interrupt business as usual.
I the next two sections, you identify potential threats to your company.
Review the lists and mark the threats that apply to your business. Get others
involved in your risk assessment; they may have a different perspective: You
can never have too many people looking out for the health of your business.
Potential threats to your business
Potential threats include, but aren’t limited to, the following:
 Economic woes: A downturn in the economy or cycles in consumer
spending threaten business as usual depending on how sensitive your
business is to changes in economic conditions.
 Financial issues: These issues can include business failure, poor 
budgeting, or unexpected expenses, which are all internal financial 
risks. Additionally, external financial risks include the state of the stock
market, interest rates, and unemployment and are more difficult to con-
trol, but can have a huge impact on the financial state of an organization.
 Lack of processes: Internal processes and systems pose a risk from fail-
ures of accountability and controls, organization, and fraud. Consumer
fraud and employee fraud are two of the biggest risks to businesses.
 Legal or regulatory action: Changes in the political environment affect
businesses through tax policies, public opinion, consumer confidence,
282
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

government policies, and foreign relations. Any of these changes may
result in unforeseen legal action.
 People issues: Losing key people due to illness, resignation, maternity
leave, and death are common threats to businesses. Anyone who’s lost a
key employee can relate to the difficulty of recovering from the loss of
the knowledge that leaves with that employee.
 Tarnished reputation: Your image in the market is important to create a
solid customer base. Unfortunately, confidence in a company can be hurt
by the loss of a business partner or employee confidence or damage to
one’s reputation in the market. A tarnished reputation can be a risk that
takes years and years of undoing and unraveling.
 Telecommunication, computer, or key equipment failure: Disruption of
daily tasks can be caused by an electrical outage, a shortage of supplies,
slow operational processes, loss of access to essential assets like your
digital files, and failures in distribution.
A small, but busy, independent travel agency found out the hard way what
can happen when standard telecommunications systems go out. During the
month of January, which is the high season for this industry, the systems
failed due to cut power lines. Road crews were resurfacing a street and cut a
supply cable, which shut down the power for three days. The company relies
on these systems to confirm prices, check availability of hotels and flights,
and complete currency exchange transactions for its customers. As a result,
the travel agency lost a considerable amount of business to competitor agen-
cies, including one key business contract. Customer loyalty and repeat busi-
ness are very important in what is now an extremely competitive business.
The company suffered from negative customer experiences and lost its most
profitable customer. If the travel agency was able to set up its office remotely,
the company would’ve been up and running again with only a short delay.
Instead, this outage cost the company thousands of dollars.
In another example, a small local optometry clinic was defrauded when an
employee was buying designer sunglasses and reselling them on eBay. The
employee was ordering sunglasses on company purchase orders that weren’t
recorded and then stealing the shipments before anyone saw them. The 
lack of an internal purchasing system with the proper controls allowed this
employee to defraud the clinic of $50,000.
Disaster planning
Disasters are another form of risk all businesses need to pay close attention
to. Events like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and
other global disasters make you assess how such unexpected events affect
your business.
283
Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B

The following adversities are just a few of the misfortunes that can occur,
from some of the biggest to the smallest:
 Natural disasters: Hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, or fires can all
bring your thriving business to a halt. Even if you’re not in a hurricane-,
earthquake-, tornado-, or fire-prone area, don’t underestimate the power
of storms. Summer storms can cause flooding and wind and hail damage,
and winter storms may cause pipes to burst from freezing conditions.
 Terrorist attacks: As much as you hate to think about this, those busi-
nesses located in big cities realize that terrorists are a real threat.
Although most small businesses aren’t concerned with being directly
targeted by terrorists, it’s important to consider how a terrorist attack
affects operations.
 Theft or vandalism: If someone deliberately crashes your computer sys-
tems or steals CD-ROMs with vital client information, the criminal activ-
ity not only affects the cost of the equipment but also the information
stored on its hard drive and the time you spent collecting those records.
 Fire: Different from natural disaster fires, office fires are a real risk that
can leave your business paralyzed from the loss of equipment and busi-
ness records and digital files at the very least.
 Loss of power: Many businesses rely on power. Think about how you
use electricity. Are there ways your business can continue to function
without power? What primary functions do you want to maintain during
a power outage?
 IT system failure: Businesses are increasingly dependent on computers.
Consider the potential effects of computer viruses, attacks by hackers,
or system failures on productivity.
 Outbreak of disease or infection: Depending on your type of business,
an outbreak of an infectious disease among your staff, in your premises,
or among your livestock can present serious health and safety risks.
Assessing the impact of your risks
Now that you’ve identified the potential threats to your business (see
“Identifying common risks and threats you might face” in the previous sec-
tion), it’s time to determine how big those threats really are. Ask yourself
three questions:
 What are the odds that each particular threat may occur?
 How frequently can each threat pose a problem?
 How may the threat impact my business?
284
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Follow the steps below to assess your risks and to get started thinking about
how to manage those risks:
1. List all the potential risks to your business you identified in the previ-
ous section.
Your organization may face some unique risks that you don’t want to
overlook. If you’re stumped, ask your employees as well as other col-
leagues in your industry.
2. Rate the probability of each particular threat occurring on a scale
from high to low.
By rating them, you eliminate the ones that are unlikely. For example,
you may decide to do nothing about a low-probability disaster for your
area, like an earthquake if you live in Indiana. You know its effects can 
be disastrous, but given the fact that it’s unlikely to occur, it’s better to
focus your efforts on other threats.
3. Look at the risks that you rated highest or the most likely to occur.
Determine the possible impact of one of these disasters on your business
and assign a monetary value. For example, how much would it cost you if
your computer equipment was stolen or damaged? If a key employee left,
how would that impact your business?
4. Review the list of risks with monetary values assigned to them.
Select the three that have the biggest impact on your businesses.
Taking action to manage the real risks
After you’ve evaluated the risks you may encounter, and they’ve been priori-
tized (see the previous two sections), you can start to look at ways to manage
them. As you evaluate potential solutions, consider a cost-benefit analysis.
You may find in some cases it’s better to play the odds than to incur the cost
of managing the risk. There are numerous ways of managing risks:
 Utilize your current assets: Find ways to use existing resources to offset
risk. These methods could be as simple as improving existing methods
and systems, reallocating responsibilities, or improving accountability
and internal controls.
 Invest in new assets: You may have identified some risks that can be
managed through the purchase of new assets. For example, if the cost of
an electrical outage to your business is substantial, you could store files
off-site where employees can access them through home computers. If a
285
Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B

natural disaster, such as a flood, is a big threat, you could move your
offices to higher ground. Naturally these actions may not be simple, 
but you may find that diminishing the risk is better than the liability.
 Develop continuity planning: You may decide to accept a risk, but
choose to develop a plan to minimize its effects if this happens. A good
continuity plan allows you to take action immediately if you find yourself
in a crisis management situation. Check out “Keeping Your Business
Humming Along No Matter What: Continuity Planning” in the next section.
For further reading, check out Disaster Planning and Recovery: A Guide for
Facility Professionals (Wiley) by Alan M. Levitt.
Keeping Your Business Humming Along
No Matter What: Continuity Planning
Whew! You might be worn out by all the planning, planning, and more plan-
ning discussed earlier in this chapter. But don’t worry. Business continuity
planning just brings it all together. It’s about making sure that your business
doesn’t stop running and minimizing the impact for your employees, cus-
tomers, and your reputation if it does. I’ve given you the basics to ensure 
that your business keeps on humming.
Your continuity plan can be a one-page section at the end of your strategic
plan or it can stand on its own. It’s nice to incorporate continuity planning
into your strategic planning process because a good continuity plan should
change as rapidly as your environment changes. Revising it at least once a
year is a good idea. Being prepared with a plan helps you better navigate
your business through a variety of circumstances.
Throughout history, companies have failed simply because they’ve failed 
to plan for the bad times. When FTD’s computer system failed just before
Mother’s Day several years ago, the flower distribution company didn’t have
a backup plan. Management was surprised by the disruption and lost a ton of
orders. In another instance, when the electricity failed just before the high-
profile Preakness horse race, all-important last-minute bets couldn’t be
entered into the computer system.
You don’t want disaster to strike your business. So continuity planning is a
great way to prepare your business for an unpredictable future. And trust 
me — you’ll sleep better at night knowing that you have a backup plan in
place for the unknown.
286
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Just the basics, ensuring you’re covered
Don’t get overwhelmed by your continuity plan by diving too deep into the
details. Keep it simple and follow the basics. As shown in Figure 15-1, your
continuity plan can be a checklist for each of the sections below. Indicate
how often and who’s responsible for the tasks in each area. The following
sections are the absolute necessities your plan must cover to avoid panic in
the presence of a threat.
Back up your data
Always have a backup when handling records and data. There’s nothing
worse than informing a client you were careless enough to lose his personal
information. Here are a few tips to take care of your info:
 Establish an off-site server to store records. Select a remote location
with a replica of your primary computer system with all the important
programs, updates, and documentation. It’s absolutely essential that
this system be checked at least every quarter to ensure that the backup
of all important company information actually runs on the off-site
system.
 Install anti-virus software. Although everyone knows this is important,
we rarely associate anti-virus software with ensuring the longevity of our
data. Running anti-virus software is just as important as storing your
records off site.
Data is backed up
Current contact information is available
in a hard copy format
List of alternative suppliers and buyers

Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B

 Ensure that the right maintenance agreements are in place. You want
to make sure that your off-site server is being maintained correctly. A
good maintenance agreement protects you, ensures daily backups, and
provides regular software updates and patches.
Many IT companies provide service packages, which include regularly back-
ing up your data off site on a secure server.
Keep a hard copy of current contact information
Make sure that you update your contact information (including e-mail and fax
numbers) quarterly and that you have a copy of that info for the following
groups of folks:
 All customers
 All employees
 All suppliers and vendors
 Insurance agents, including copies of policies and policy numbers
Know your alternative suppliers and buyers
Consider how dependent you are on your suppliers and buyers. What are
your alternative options if something in your supply chain goes down? For
example, if you’re in a distribution business, do you have an alternative way
to ship your products? What would you do if you still had the ability to ship
but no access to your office? Think about cultivating relationships with 
other suppliers and buyers out of your area and theirs. Additionally, keep 
an off-site list in case you need to contact them and you can’t access your
premises.
Secure your premises
Keep up regular maintenance on fire and burglar alarm systems and review
safety guidelines for electricity and gas use. Think about an alternate location
to call home base in the event of an emergency. For example, you may sug-
gest an arrangement with another local business to share premises temporar-
ily if a disaster affected either of you. You can also use a business continuity
supplier, which can make alternative premises available on short notice. You
can find a supplier online in bigger metros. Businesses in smaller markets
most likely don’t have this option available.
Business continuity suppliers can be expensive. By planning in advance, you
give yourself the opportunity to evaluate more cost-effective options.
288
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Maintain your equipment or machinery
If your business requires particular equipment in order to function, look into
available maintenance plans to ensure the quickest service. You know what
machinery is vital to your operation. Do all that you can to avoid downtime
for any piece of equipment that makes or breaks your production.
Cross train employees on important tasks
Because a fully-functioning staff is critical to most everyone’s business in
times of emergency, don’t depend on only a select few. If the knowledge of a
skill or process is in the head of one or two people, what do you do in a time
of emergency or even if they both go on vacation at the same time? Provide
cross-training for employees on various tasks and processes. If cross-training
feels too overwhelming, invest in training temporary cover from a recruit-
ment agency.
Stay current with your insurance
Insurance is a necessity in any effective risk-management strategy. Go through
all the potential threats your business could face and consider what types 
of insurance might be offered to offset some of the risk. If you have a major
loss, your insurance coverage is there to back you up and help rebuild your
company.

Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B
The flu brings down a company
A medium-sized management consulting firm
discovered how important it is to have a conti-
nuity plan that details how to react when key
employees are unavailable. One of its directors
came down with a rare, but horrible, strain of
the flu. Unfortunately, before he was diagnosed,
he came into work feeling ill. As soon as the
doctor diagnosed him, the director was advised
to immediately inform anyone with whom he’d
been in contact with over the past three days 
of the infection. Due to the nature of this partic-
ular strain of the flu, the CEO of the company 
was forced to quarantine and send home key
team members who’d been in contact with the
director.
Temporary employees were bought in to cover
essential work requirements, but they weren’t
trained to access the key systems needed to
keep various important projects moving forward.
Consequently, many projects were delayed and
the company missed several key deadlines.
Cross-training or systems manuals could’ve
eliminated some elements of this crisis.

Communicate the plan to key employees
Compile a list of everyone who knows where the continuity information is
located and make sure that the site is accessible to other employees. Think
about how you’re going to get your employees to the remote location in the
event of an emergency and how you can communicate instructions to them.
Do you need walkie talkies, two-way radios, or cell phones for emergency
purposes only?
Have a way for employees to work from home
Coming into the office isn’t always practical or safe if your business is in a
state of emergency. A great way to ensure that your business keeps running is
to step up your office for remote access. That way, your employees can keep
working from home, and everyone feels safe, sound, and productive.
Getting more specific
If you’re ready to move beyond the basic continuity plan, follow the steps
below to be better prepared. Knock off the items that pertain to you and get
to the rest when you have time:
 Create a detailed plan for the immediate actions to be taken and col-
lect the resources you need to implement that plan. The first hour fol-
lowing an emergency is often the most critical. Being prepared for that
first hour can minimize the impact of a disaster.
 Ensure that all employees are aware of what they have to do and
where to find the resources they need to perform their jobs. Can 
additional staff training be beneficial in an emergency?
 Create checklists arranged around the plan to ensure all steps are fol-
lowed. In an emergency situation, some people lose focus; a checklist
can help your staff be more thorough and calm.
 Compile a list of contacts you’re likely to have to notify in an emer-
gency. Your list can include emergency services, insurance providers,
local authorities, legal counsel, customers, suppliers, utility companies,
and neighboring businesses. It’s also worth including details of service
providers such as glaziers, locksmiths, plumbers, electricians, and IT
specialists. Having contact information ready can save time and makes
certain you remember to call everyone.
 Include maps of your premises to help emergency services. These
maps show fire escapes, sprinklers, and other safety equipment.
290
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

 Determine who the company spokesperson is to handle questions
from the media. Ideally, you would identify your CEO or another person
in a leadership position who’s always the media contact, no matter
what. Ask yourself who’s best equipped to handle questions and main-
tain a positive outlook. Appoint that person as well as a back-up person.
Inform stakeholders such as staff, customers, and suppliers that they
should direct media questions to the appointed person.
 Make sure that you have hard copies of your business continuity plan.
Store these copies safely at your home, with your bank, and with other
key members of the staff.
 Update your plan regularly. As changes occur, take a moment to make a
note in your plan. For example, moving locations may necessitate reeval-
uating your entire plan immediately.
 Schedule regular tests of your plan. Testing can make a difference in an
actual emergency and may give you peace of mind that everything can
run smoothly in times of emergency.
The U.S. government provides even more detailed information about continu-
ity planning for businesses at www.ready.gov. You have access to addi-
tional detailed emergency planning information and checklists.
Scenario Planning: What If . . . ?
Scenario planning is a way of simplifying a complex future by providing you
the opportunity to ask the “what if” questions and to rehearse how you 
may respond should a certain event or trend happen in the future. Scenario 
planning is a subset of strategic planning. Basic strategic planning tends to
address the incidents of the day, such as the decision to increase staff because
of a projected influx in sales. But scenario planning looks at what might
happen tomorrow. It’s focused on understanding what the future looks like.
Scenario planning was first developed and used by the U.S. Air Force during
World War II. The planning method gained acknowledgement in the business
world when Shell Oil utilized scenario planning techniques to predict the oil
crisis of the 1970s.
For organizations, scenario planning provides an invaluable opportunity to
have a strategic discussion around key drivers and critical uncertainties in
your operating environment. With scenario planning, you’re imagining not
just one, but a variety of future possibilities.
291
Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B

The scenarios you develop serve two purposes:
 To manage risks where you can “test” your strategies’ possible futures:
By understanding how the strategies perform in each of the scenarios,
you can make modifications to resolve potential weaknesses or highlight
the need for contingency plans.
 To generate creativity and spark new ideas: The scenarios often high-
light ideas previously thought too outlandish or combine things in ways
that lead to new conclusions. Scenarios can provide an organization
with an invaluable insight for new directions.
You don’t always have time to do scenario planning in your traditional strate-
gic planning process. But for those of you who are just tuning up your plan,
consider doing a scenario analysis to push the bounds of your thinking. You
never know what you might come up with!
Through scenario analysis you develop several different paths your company
can take given a variety of environmental changes. You can look at small envi-
ronmental changes or big ones. The following sections guide you through
doing either one.
Considering the smaller what ifs . . .
Although driving forces may present an array of opportunities and threats,
there are a number of smaller scenarios that hit closer to home — the what
ifs. Calling these smaller scenarios is a bit of a misnomer because when they
happen, they can happen quickly and with devastating consequences, so
they don’t seem too small. When you run through your potential scenarios —
in the next section — make sure to include at least one or two of the follow-
ing variables in your mix:
 What if sales are flat this year or if sales decline by 20 or 30 percent?
 What if sales increase rapidly, such as 25 percent or more?
 What if accounts receivable collections slow by 30 days?
 What if banks increase interest rates by several percentage points?
 What if our biggest customer goes out of business or if we lose our
biggest client?
 What if our competitors actively pursue our accounts?
292
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

 What if we have a major public relations crisis such as a bad product or
a lawsuit?
 What if we find out that important information from our company found
its way into the hands of our competitors?
Thinking about the big what ifs . . .
The most significant trends likely to affect the larger world are those forces
that are the big what ifs — the driving forces. These cases tend to push your
thinking and are usually classified as the big unknowns. The forces generally
come in four flavors:
 Social dynamics: This area includes specific demographic issues such
as how influential youth might be in ten years; and softer issues of
values, lifestyle, demand, or political energy, such as people getting
bored with online chatting.
 Economic issues: Macroeconomic trends and forces shape the economy
as a whole. How does the price of crude oil impact the cost of running
your business? Microeconomic dynamics are also a factor — what 
might your competitors do? How does the very structure of the industry
change? And within the company itself, will you be able to find the skilled
employees you need?
 Political issues: You may need to handle electoral concerns such as
who’s going to be the next president. Legislative changes can affect tax
policies, and regulatory issues can include figuring out what to do if
Microsoft were to go under.
 Technological issues: In this category, you deal with direct access such
as how high-bandwidth wireless affects land-line telephones; enabling
technologies such as nanotechnology bringing in the next chip revolu-
tion; and indirect technology, such as biotech evolving past medicine
into mainstream full-body entertainment.
Identifying which of the big what ifs might impact your firm is the key to sce-
nario planning for these forces. Some of these may seem farfetched, whereas
others are quite a bit more likely.
The goal in scenario planning isn’t to create one specific future. Instead, by
drawing attention to key drivers and exploring how they push the future in
different directions, planners create an array of possibilities resulting in the
ability to make crucial decisions today.
293
Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B

Stepping into your future
Ready to step into your future? Below is a guide to run scenarios with your
team. But first, how many scenarios should you develop? Ideally, you develop
scenarios for the situations that you’re most likely to face. Three to five is a
good number to push you and your team’s limits.
Unfortunately, developing a few plans can be expensive, complex, and time-
consuming. But don’t get bogged down in the number. Decide to run a hand-
ful and have fun!
Here are the steps to running your own scenario planning:
1. Define a timeframe for each scenario.
Some events may occur in 20 years, some in two. But you can’t work
with indefinite, open-ended scenarios.
2. Establish the primary variable in your scenarios.
Use the questions listed in the previous sections to determine your vari-
ables. Alternatively, you can use current and future trends outside of the
company. Assess ways in which these trends may present opportunities
or threats to your business. Check out Chapter 9 for a list of current and
future trends.
3. Clearly articulate the scenario with a problem statement.
On a white board, write down “What if _____?” and fill in the blank. For
example — what if we lose our biggest client, resulting in a 50 percent
decrease in revenue? Or what if a public relations scandal ruins our rep-
utation or brand image?
4. Create a compelling headline or working title for the scenario.
Something like “ABC Company Takes Its Production In-House” or
“Partner in Company X Sued Over Malpractice” can work.
5. Flesh out the details of the scenario.
Clarify exactly the situation your company would be in.
6. Develop options for action if the scenario in Step 5 should occur.
These options make up what are called robust strategies, which are
designed to work regardless of how the future turns out.
If you run several scenarios, a range of choices that identify potential threats
and opportunities may come up. Many of these choices otherwise go unno-
ticed if you focus obsessively on your organization’s present-day situation.

Chapter 15: Contingency Planning: Your Plan B
Create your doomsday kit
Only you know what types of threats or disas-
ters your business faces. Define your doomsday
and think about what you can do to lessen the
impact. Gather the supplies you may need in
one place to save yourself valuable time during
an emergency. Here’s a list of items to consider
for your doomsday kit:
 A copy of your continuity plan — remember
to store copies in multiple locations
 Contact numbers (which should be in your
continuity plan)
 Map of the premises with detailed informa-
tion about fuse boxes, gas lines, water
pipes, and so on
 Extra keys
 Flashlights
 Battery powered radio
 Extra batteries (replace every six months)
 Supplies to operate without a functional
computer such as a laptop with a spare bat-
tery, battery powered calculator, carbon
copy receipts, sales tax chart, and credit
card imprinting machine
 Supplies for stranded employees such as
water, non-perishable food, and blankets
 Backup personal items, especially medica-
tions (have employees keep them in their
desks or handbag)
 First aid kit

Planning Considerations 
for Entrepreneurs and 
Department Managers
In This Chapter
 Establishing an exit strategy for business owners
 Discovering how to cascade goals throughout an organization
 Watching out for departmental planning pitfalls
O
ne size doesn’t fit all when it comes to strategic planning. You can easily
pick and choose the pieces of strategic planning that apply to your com-
pany (as presented in the previous chapters). However, there are a few cases
that deserve special attention: entrepreneurs and department/division/group
managers.
Business owners have the unique responsibility of determining the strategic
direction of an organization based on their personal endgame — the final
result they want out of their business. An endgame can be anything from 
continual cash flow, to a business sale, to more time off. Whatever it is, the
endgame is the personal vision of the business owner (see Chapter 6). Multi-
department or multi-tiered organizations must drive the strategic direction
down to every level of the company. This process is easy when there are only
a handful of employees. But when you have many departments or divisions
or numerous locations, planning becomes more complicated.
This chapter is intended to be an addendum to rest of the book. Although
everything presented in the previous chapters is completely applicable, this
chapter takes planning one step future for entrepreneurs and department
managers.

In this chapter, you determine the value of your company and how to plan for
your company’s survival after you leave. You also discover how to cascade
goals throughout your organization, whether you have one level or ten.
Planning Issues for Entrepreneurs
Although publicly-traded companies get all the media limelight, roughly 90
percent of the businesses in the United States are privately held. As a busi-
ness owner, you have some special considerations in your planning efforts:
 How will your business continue when you exit stage left?
 How do you establish the value or projected value of your business?
Although you may not want to think about some of these topics today, each
of these topics influences the strategic direction of your company. Many
owners have a difficult time thinking about life after their company. However,
your endgame is arguably the most important part of your strategic planning
effort. Although you may not share your ideas with your staff, you want to
have a clear plan for your departure.
Take a few moments to consider the legacy you want your business to leave.
Will it continue on indefinitely or pass to your children or employees? Do you
plan on cashing out or will it just cease to exist? Many entrepreneurs aren’t
clear about what their businesses look like without them, so they leave their
exit strategy to chance instead of intention. Bottom line: The ownership of
the business will be transferred at some point with or without you. Your
death or other unforeseen life changes may force the transfer, but through
careful planning, you can leave a legacy of how you want to business to run.
The upcoming sections help you put the finishing touches on your strategic
plan in the case of your absence. Take the self-assessment in Figure 16-1 to
see where you are with your exit planning.
Ensuring your business continues after you
The fact that you’ll leave your business at some point is a given. If you’ve
been ignoring this point, you’re not alone. People start and run businesses
for numerous reasons, and so much energy goes into that process that most
owners never really consider how it may end. Of course, the reason most
business owners avoid this entire discussion is because it’s not the most
inspiring topic. Nevertheless, setting a clear exit strategy is imperative to
ensure that your years of hard work pay off in the end.
298
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Planning an exit strategy shouldn’t begin when you decide to sell your com-
pany. Knowing your options and a few best practices can make this task seem
less intimidating. Check out the following sections on how to make the impor-
tant transition.
Planning for transition
The best time to start planning the exit strategy is when your venture is
launched or purchased. Any number of front-end decisions and strategies can
have long-term impact on the operations.
Self-Assessment for Exit Planning
Rate your exit planning activities against best practices.  Remember to be completely
honest in this assessment because the beneficiary of good planning is you.  Use the
following scoring of 1 to 5, where: 1 = serious problem area; 2 = area needs major
improvement; 3 = acceptable but could use some improvement; 4 = only needs minimal
attention; 5 = solid effort, well done.
Action
I have determined when I want to exit my business or I know how to determine
the appropriate time.
I have a written exit/succession plan.
I understand there are two major considerations in exit planning – personal
interests in regards to management activities and financial interests as an
owner.
I have assembled a group of valued consultants/professionals to advise me in
this planning process.
I know the current value of my business.
I have determined what the value needs to be at the point of transfer to achieve
my financial goals.
If I have decided to transfer the business rather than sell it, appropriate
successor(s) have been identified.
I have a plan in place to appropriately train and equip my successor(s).
I have identified a board of advisors and written a “management letter” for my
spouse in the event of my untimely demise.
I have determined my purpose in life beyond the business in anticipation of
having a fulfilled life in retirement.
I include my spouse in exit planning and purpose planning.
If you average less than threes on the eleven questions, you have a significant amount of
work to accomplish today.

Chapter 16: Planning Considerations for Entrepreneurs . . .

The first phase of your transition is called exit planning — directing how to
transfer the business when you leave. Exit planning is a key part of your orga-
nization’s strategic direction because it dictates how you set up your busi-
ness for the long run. Of the four different ways to exit your business, each
one requires a unique strategy. The second phase is succession planning,
which involves determining who runs the business when you depart.
There are basically four ways to exit your business:
 Transfer ownership to a family member
 Sell to employees or other owners
 Sell to a third party
 Liquidate
Consider drafting your own personal vision statement for your business,
which includes your exit strategy. This doesn’t need to be shared with your
staff, but it can guide the strategic growth of your organization.
Considerations for exiting your business
No matter whether you’re considering an outright sale or deciding to groom
another person to lead the business, you have some critical considerations
to ponder to start developing your exit strategy:
300
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 
The end is inevitable
Studies show that a majority of business
owners are in denial or just postponing the
inevitable. Here are a few reasons why you
don’t want to be part of the majority:
 Only about a quarter of businesses with less
than $200 million in sales have a formal
exit/succession plan.
 A study of more than 5,000 franchised busi-
nesses showed that only 24 percent were
sold and 76 percent essentially closed their
doors with some possibly being liquidated.
 A survey of thousands of business owners
concluded that most misjudged the value of
their business by 50 percent or more. In
some cases, this amounted to a difference
of a million dollars.
 Without a reasonable plan developed, the
owner will undoubtedly receive a much
smaller financial return than anticipated.
 A strategic buyer generally pays a higher
price than a financial buyer. Seeking a
strategic buyer can require research and
extra time.
 Most family businesses need to increase
profits or grow by at least 15 percent to
cover the cost of transition.

 Timing: When is the right time? Timing has an impact on the quantity
and quality of buyers. You need to decide when the right time is based
on your business life cycle. Ideally you’ll exit when you’re on the top,
not on the downward slide.
 Value: What is an objective sale value or price for your company?
Business owners are often unpleasantly surprised at the low value an
outside entity places on their business. Get an outside valuation so you
won’t be surprised when you’re ready to exit.
 Succession or sale: What is the appropriate selection process or training
sequence to prepare for a smooth transition? The next section,
“Preparing for a smooth exit,” discusses the elements of finding the right
person to take over.
 Income tax considerations: Uncle Sam’s cut can play a bigger role that
you might like. Maximizing value requires reducing income taxes as
much as possible. Talk to your CPA about the best way to do this.
 Separate self (management) from the investment: How will you sepa-
rate yourself from the value of the business? You want the investment to
stand alone, without your involvement. To do all these things, you need
to slowly pass clients, relationships, and responsibility to other em-
ployees in your firm. Often, businesses have branded their last name
into the business name. It’s important to figure out if you can eliminate
that tie.
 Purpose beyond business: What are you going to do after the transfer?
Don’t wait until after the sale or exit to answer this question. Have a plan
for what you’ll do without your current daily activities. For some of you,
this may be very easy; for others, it may not. Take care of yourself just
as you’re taking care of your employees during this time of transition.
Preparing for a smooth exit
After you’ve determined how you can exit the business, succession planning
helps you determine who runs your business after its transfer. (This is rele-
vant for all exit strategies except liquidation.) While you still have ownership
and control, this time is crucial to add your input. No one knows the business
better than you, so take advantage of your current situation and aid a suc-
cessful succession.
To make sure the succession goes smoothly, update or establish your strate-
gic plan so it can be used as the guide for the person who takes over. This
guide helps maintain financial stability and future growth of the company.
You want your successor to flourish because undoubtedly your financial
future is intertwined with your business’s future success. Therefore, take ade-
quate time to develop a complete strategic plan so your successors have a
steering wheel to guide the business safely through the competitive market-
place. Follow these steps to help you develop a succession plan:
301
Chapter 16: Planning Considerations for Entrepreneurs . . .

1. Write a job description for your successor(s).
You know the requirements of the position that you’ll be vacating better
than anyone. Make a list of everything that you do with details. Then ask
your direct reports to comment and add to it.
2. Develop a training program for your successors(s).
You know the needed skills and knowledge to be competent in your cur-
rent position. Consider having your successor shadow you in your job,
make an assistant CEO/leadership position, or create a management
training program. All of these options or combinations of them achieve
the goal of giving your successors the tools they need to do your job.
3. Formalize and communicate the plan to all interested parties.
No matter who you appoint to take over or whoever your successor is,
someone may get hurt feelings. There may be disgruntled family mem-
bers or employees. If you communicate your plan with detailed explana-
tions, people may better understand why you made the decisions that
you did. Time can resolve sensitive issues. Make sure to also create all
necessary legal documents to protect your business decisions.
4. Create a management letter for your spouse (or significant other).
In the event of an untimely transfer, your spouse (if you have one) needs
to know how you want to handle the situation, what your current goals
are, who can be trusted and relied on in the current management team,
and who can compose a dependable board of advisors. Write out a state-
ment including all these factors.
If you don’t have a spouse, you should still craft a management letter
because you need to explain how you want your to transfer your 
business.
In either situation, provide a copy of your management letter to your
spouse or most trusted confidant as well as your corporate attorney.
Consider putting this letter in a safe deposit box as well. The most
important point of this letter is to ensure that your intentions are upheld
in case you aren’t there to oversee the transfer.
Gathering additional resources
You should assemble a group of trusted advisors to help protect your assets
and future desires. When taking all considerations to heart, developing suffi-
cient responses and eventually setting a solid strategy can be easier with out-
side expertise and resources.

Few business owners are fortunate enough to sell their company when its
value is at an all-time high. Even fewer owners who’ve sold their companies
will ever know how or whether they could’ve achieved a higher price.

Inspired by success
In case you don’t think selling your business is
likely or even possible, here are examples of
some entrepreneurial companies who’ve sold
their businesses (I hope you’re inspired by their
success):
 Catalytica Pharmaceuticals:
A 1,700-
employee, Mountain View, California-based
pharmaceutical outsourcer that made the
world’s supply of such drugs as AZT and
Wellbutrin. The company was founded in
1993 and was sold to DSM of Holland for
$800 million in 2000.
 MLMReporter.com: Founded in 2000, this
company, which sells online marketing 
programs and systems, was sold two years
later to KMT Media for just under $250,000
in April 2002.
 PayPal: An online payment service based in
San Jose was sold to eBay three years after
it was founded for $1.5 billion in stock in
June 2002.
 MySpace: A social networking Web site
(the fourth most popular English language
Web site as of May 2006), was sold to media
giant News Corp for $580 million in 2006
three years after it was founded.

Check out the following sections for information on how to determine your
business’s value.
Establishing a value
Many factors can pique a buyer’s interest — strong management, quality
products, proven processes — but earnings will always be key. Historical,
verifiable, and sustainable earnings that increase year-over-year are most
attractive to perspective buyers. With that in mind, understanding how your
business achieves the highest possible earnings becomes the roadmap to
your strategic planning process.
The process begins by measuring how well your business is currently man-
aged in comparison with other similar businesses that have recently sold. For
example, when comparing two recently sold companies in your industry with
similar revenue, you might find that Company A sold for a multiple of 3.5
times earnings while Company B sold for a multiple of 4.9 times earnings.
Further analysis might uncover major differences in such factors as ratio of
earnings, salaries, or cost of goods sold in relation to revenue.

More planning tips for business owners
In addition to valuing your business and 
thinking about an exit strategy, here are some
additional planning tips for privately-held 
companies:
 Engage all your employees. Don’t leave
anyone out of the planning process
because in a smaller organization you run
the risk of alienating some people. Although
you may not think it’s appropriate to include
everyone on staff, how will it look if every-
one but two or three members aren’t
included? Find ways to engage everyone in
the process.
 Recognize your constraints. As the owner,
you probably have grand ideas and big
plans. But remember not to overwhelm your
staff by thinking too big or grandiose.
Recognize your constraints and create a
realistic strategic plan.
 Have a clear vision. Being crystal clear
about what the owners want to achieve is
critical to the success of any privately-held
business. Do you want to grow or stay
small? If you want to grow, by how much
(see the preceding valuation discussion)?
What future do you want to create for your
business? It’s really important for you to be
clear about your owner’s vision. Because if
you’re fuzzy on your vision, it will never
materialize.
 Just do it! I know this slogan can be
overused, but it fits perfectly here. It seems
like setting aside time for planning in
smaller organizations is hard because you
don’t have a person who can dedicate their
time to strategic planning. Take the time to
make strategy part of your culture. After the
effects of executing your strategic plan are
felt, you’ll realize that you didn’t have time
not to do it. I promise!

Determining your value
The comprehensive approach to determining your value is to conduct a busi-
ness valuation that includes market comparisons. First determine what your
revenue or net profit needs to be to make your organization worth selling.
Then have an analyst or valuation specialist research the market.
Several major databases exist via subscription: Done Deals, Biz Comps, IBA
Market Data. Business owners can also get valuations from accounting, con-
sulting, and investment banking firms.
The quick, less scientific way to determine your value is to look up sales 
of similar companies online. Inc.com’s Web site provides a free valuation
service: www.inc.com/valuation. Any angle you choose, make sure to
include in your owner’s vision the dollar value for which you’re shooting to
sell your business. (See Chapter 6 for more information on an owner’s
vision.)
Armed with the valuation results, identify areas you need to fine-tune and
improve to create increased earnings and, ultimately, a higher price when
selling your business.
Planning Concerns for Department Heads
Organizations that execute with excellence focus on a handful of clear goals
and align the focus of every department and employee to those few goals.
Take FranklinCovey Co. and Harris Interactive as examples. They conducted a
study to test the gap between goal setting and the actual achievement of
those goals in various companies. With more than 11,000 respondents, the
results shed some light on issues around planning for organizations with 
multiple levels and departments. Here’s what the study found:
 Lack of clarity: Only one in six workers think their organization sets
clear goals and fewer than half say they understand what their compa-
nies are trying to achieve. Flip back to Chapter 14 for solutions to this
issue.
 Wasting time on non-critical tasks: By their own account, respondents
spend only 49 percent of their time on crucial organizational goals. One
hour out of three is spent on urgent but irrelevant tasks, such as check-
ing e-mail. One hour in five is wasted dealing with pointless bureaucracy
issues such as politicking and attending unproductive meetings. By
having a strategic plan that everyone buys into and understands, you
can increase time spent on the crucial aspects of your organization.

 No accountability: Only about 50 percent of all respondents said that
they feel accountable for performance. They’re rarely, if ever, called on
to report progress. Chapter 14 also addresses this problem.
 No line of sight between organizational goals and work: Only 20 per-
cent of people has clearly defined work goals and 10 percent clearly
understands how work relates to the organization’s top priorities.
The next section addresses how to get alignment throughout an organization,
no matter what the size.
Cascading corporate goals 
to department goals
Cascading goals means breaking down the corporate goals into a set of
smaller goals that are relevant to each department. A simple way to think
about this process is to think about goals spilling over a cliff like a waterfall.
Goals must spread throughout an entire organization in order to be executed,
as Figure 16-2 shows.
The department goals describe what each unit needs to achieve. These goals
are then broken down further until individuals in the unit have their own 
performance goals. In this way, progress throughout the organization is 
measurable.
Cascading goals isn’t an easy or fast process. Be prepared to meet resistance
in getting people to get on board. Some may need specific training because
they don’t know how to develop goals and others may need coaching to
enhance their performance.

Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Follow these steps to cascade goals in your organization:
1. Select a person to be in charge of managing the cascading process.
If you’ve appointed a strategic plan manager, he’s the ideal person for
the job.
2. Create a grid like Figure 16-3.
The grid lists all the corporate goals on the left-hand side and all depart-
ments horizontally across the top.
3. Identify which departments are responsible for each goal.
Some goals may require two or more departments.
4. Ask each department head or manager to develop department spe-
cific goals to support the corporate goals they’ve been assigned.
See Figure 16-4 for an example. Managers should ask these questions:
What must we, as a team, do to support that the corporate goals? What
must I do to support my team’s goals?
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4.
This process cascades the goals down to as many levels as you choose,
including individual players.
The planning team should ensure that the department level goals achieve the
corporate goal after all department goals are completed. Review Chapter 14
for information on communication goals, holding everyone accountable, and
tips on execution.

When goals cascade successfully, the results can be dramatic because you
get alignment across the entire organization. All the executives at the same
level need to agree on how they support the CEO’s vision and what they can
do to minimize conflict. Cascading goals creates constancy of focus, which
gets everybody thinking about their contribution and how they are the foun-
dation for the corporate goals.
Avoiding landmines in 
departmental planning
Some organizations are more political, departmentalized, controversial, or
dysfunctional than others. And it’s helpful to know if you’re headed into a
minefield before you take your first step. But don’t despair! Your planning
efforts can still be wildly successful.
In the next sections, I cover potential barriers to your planning, so avoiding
these pitfalls (if you can) prevents your planning efforts from blowing up.
Limited budget and resources
If you lead a department, often there are externally imposed resource and
operational constraints that severely hinder your ability to plan and act
autonomously. For example, your budget may be so constrained because
you’re a cost center that even lining up training for your people to develop
staff may not be possible. You’re allowed to budget for operational overhead
only, and you’re only allowed to go off what was done in the past.

If this is your situation, get creative. Be a change agent. Rework your depart-
mental budget, buddy up with other departments, develop a non-expense
option to implement your plan, or start your political positioning to get
around your roadblocks.
Technology seems to always be a resource constraint and roadblock. For
example, the shipping department may not be able to explain why they need
$3 million for a new shipping system, while the legacy system continues to
age and create operational drag. The current system still seems to work and
job gets done. The fact that a new system is needed has to be defended early
and often. For many groups, getting something like this is a multi-year politi-
cal battle.

Cascading goals at Giant Eagle
Schuster-Zingheim and Associates, Inc. (www.
schuster-zingheim.com) is a consulting
firm that works with hundreds of clients to align
corporate goals with employee performance.
The company customizes pay and total rewards
programs to engage the workforce and make
them stakeholders in creating organizational
success. Here’s an example of how cascading
goals worked for one of their clients:
Giant Eagle is a market-dominant East Coast
grocery chain that employs 30,000 mostly-
unionized retail grocery workers. Jack Flanagan
(then 
executive 
vice 
president, 
Retail
Operations) believed that for the company to
improve on key dimensions, including customer
satisfaction, the unionized workforce had to
become stakeholders in the success of the
stores in which they worked — they had to
share in the financial performance of the store
as measured in terms of customer satisfaction,
store sales performance, and controllable cost.
Giant Eagle’s chairman and president joined
Flanagan and other executives to develop an
incentive strategy with the goal of aligning
unionized employees with key measures of suc-
cess at the store level. Measures of customer
satisfaction, sales, and cost were selected as
paramount. In the past, differences in store per-
formance hadn’t impacted how store employees
were paid — they weren’t stakeholders in the
success of the store, and their rewards weren’t
tied to how an individual store or the Giant Eagle
company as a whole performed. The strategy
called for the design of an incentive plan that
focused performance on key goals. Although
Giant Eagle is able to measure nearly all
aspects of store performance, a commitment
was made to add measurement tools if they
were needed to make the incentive plan more
viable.
The design team devised a way to more effec-
tively gather and apply customer input at the
individual store level and developed operational
measures to ensure a positive cost/benefit rela-
tionship between dollars expended on incen-
tives and value added to the store. When the
incentive paid off, both employees and the store
gained measurably.
The result was an incentive plan based on 
individual store goals or key performance mea-
sures. Measures and goals were communi-
cated throughout the stores, and a monthly
check was paid based on goal achievement.

Alliances and coalitions
Because of resource constraints (see previous section), you must often ally
with other groups and departments to get anything long-term done. You may
not think that group work is a barrier, but it is because your goals may not
align with the other department’s goals.
To create buy-in, there’s often compromise or a co-mingling of goals and
resources. Think of it like going on vacation alone, versus going on vacation
with another family. The competing expectations and agendas often muddy
the water and you end up having a different trip, which often happens to
departments that are forced to work together because they can’t act alone.
Conflicting missions
Department missions often clash with other department missions. At the
operational level, planning happens in individual groups, whereas organization-
wide strategic planning often happens only at an executive level and rarely 
at an operational level. So there’s a huge gap between the folks on the top
and the people near the work. Within a system, these groups do whatever
they want, and they do it without awareness of the larger whole. The exact
opposite happens at the executive level. They plan at a 100,000 foot level, but
have no idea how to actually execute anything or track progress. Successful
organizational leaders have to live in that demilitarized zone between.
People handling
People are the most important resource in the plan. People add a tremendous
amount of value to the equation, but they can also be the biggest obstacle to
achieving your goals.
You’ll never be able to do anything alone, so you have to think about others,
cater to others, and so on. So sharpen your people handling skills in all
aspects in order to prosper strategically. See Chapter 14 about coaching for
achievement.
Departmental identity
You must be able to know your department’s value and identify it for your
stakeholders. It may be different depending on the audience. In the organiza-
tional environment, it is the little things that matter. Letting another group
use your conference room, or your color printer, or your laminator, or your
trucks with a lift-gate result in the right words being whispered in the right
ears at meetings you’re not invited to. Know what you have to trade and offer.
310
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Also, know what you have that someone else may find valuable. They can go
directly to your chain of command and ask for something that causes you a
panic and a loss of resources as you struggle to fulfill a last minute request.
Anticipate their need and desire and incorporate it into your plan. You simply
must understand what outsiders find valuable about you and your organiza-
tion, or you become a leaf in the wind.
Metrics, metrics, metrics
When you’re always asking and pitching for everything you want on a strate-
gic level, you must build in the time, resources, and processes to track every-
thing. Measurements can be an extremely crucial tool to getting you what
you want. You must be able to prove worth or protection from something
that can get you off track at all times. That means you have the data and the
fancy reports on tap. You can say, “Gee, boss, we’d like to help you, but we’re
already overcommitted by 23 percent. In fact, I’d like more people. So if you
can get me the staffing I need, maybe I can take this extra thing on.” Hand
over a fact sheet that explains it in black and white.

Chapter 17
Planning for the Social Sectors
In This Chapter
 Shifting from a profit focus to a resource focus
 Involving your board in strategic planning
 Understanding governmental planning
 Thinking about competition in nonprofits
S
trategic planning in social sectors, specifically defined as the govern-
ment and nonprofit organizations, is becoming more and more common
for several reasons:
 The communities in which we live and work are increasingly complex.
 Social issues are more difficult, more interrelated, and more critical to
solve.
 Community leaders and executive directors are being asked to be 
more accountable for the performance of their organizations and 
communities.
 As change accelerates, managers need proven management approaches,
often borrowed from the private sector, to help them be more effective
with their resources.
That said, many not-for-profit and governmental organizations have been
crafting strategic plans far longer than the business community. Best prac-
tices from this field have been adopted by private organizations and visa
versa. Many of you may not be running a nonprofit or governmental entity,
but you may sit on several boards or committees. This chapter can help you
be a better board member by understanding your role in strategic planning.
This chapter is intended to be a supplement to rest of the book. Although 
the majority of ideas and concepts presented in the previous chapters are
applicable, a few modifications are necessary for effective social sector
strategic planning.

Moving from Profit to Sustainability
Clearly the big difference between for-profits and nonprofits and governments
is that pesky little word profit. Social-sector organizations are mission-driven,
not profit-driven. So instead of the bottom line being strictly money —
although that’s necessary to keep the doors open — the real reason for 
these organization’s existence is public service.
Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, just published a supplement to his book
that talks about how social sector organizations should think about their eco-
nomic engine not in terms of profit but in terms of resources. Collins says,
“The critical question isn’t ‘How much money do we make?’ but ‘How can we
develop a sustainable resource engine to deliver superior performance rela-
tive to our mission?’”
Based on Collins’s research of hundreds of social sector companies, the
resource engine has three components, which can be developed into goals 
in the Balanced Scorecard areas in Chapter 12:
 Time: How well does your organization attract staff and volunteers to
contribute their efforts at normally lower than market wages? Think
about developing goals in areas of people and learning.
 Money: How stable and sustainable is your cash flow? In the Balanced
Scorecard areas, this is covered in the customer perspective. Do you
have solid programs that deliver to keep your cash flowing?
 Brand: How effective are you at developing relationships and emotion-
ally connecting with potential supporters? Managing your brand is part
of the operational area.
With these components, you can develop revenue goals to create an effective
resource engine. (See Chapter 12 on goal writing.) And these types of goals
make more sense to your staff and board, instead of talking about profit.
Getting Your Board on Board 
the Planning Effort
Your organization’s governing or policy board plays an important part in
your strategic planning efforts. The degree of influence boards have varies
from nonprofit to government organizations. But in some form or fashion,
314
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

these appointed or elected members are responsible for defining the organi-
zation’s purpose and mission, articulating the strategic priorities for the plan-
ning year, and monitoring the execution of the plan.
The role of the policy board
So just what is the role of the policy board, board of directors, board of
county commissioners, the city council, and so on, then?
Effective policy board members should do the following:
 Focus their attention on their policy-making role and stay out of the 
day-to-day
 Establish a clear set of priorities for the organization
 Hold the staff accountable for achieving the established priorities through
regular meetings and tying budget requests to the strategic plan
 Listen and acknowledge staff recommendations regarding the execution
of the plan
 Concentrate their resources on being more effective at policy making
Being tight on the ends 
and loose on the means
Being tight on the ends involves building a strong commitment and under-
standing of objectives and goals of your organization and its board. Although
the objectives and goals are written in ink, create the action items in pencil.
Allow those who are responsible for the goals — that is, your board — to
develop their own methods to best achieve the goals. Hence, loose on 
the means.
Many strategic planning experts have recognized the importance of flexibility
and authority in the implementation of a strategic plan. Those people involved
in the implementation process need to have enough flexibility and authority
to be creative and responsive to new developments — without having to
reconstruct an entire strategic plan. Flexibility is important as adjustments
are necessary when planning for an uncertain future. An organization’s objec-
tives and goals are much less likely and far more difficult to change than the
programs and activities planned to achieve them.
315
Chapter 17: Planning for the Social Sectors

An organization’s goal is to increase new customers by ten percent this
month. In order to achieve this goal, corporate headquarters created a sales
promotion as an action item. The local employees realized there was a major
conflicting event in their community that would hinder the success of their
promotion. Clearly those responsible for implementing the promotion needed
to adjust the program plan without changing the original goal. Among their
options are an extended promotion or a new date altogether.
Planning for Governmental Entities
Governmental planning reaches further than business planning because most
plans — whether community cultural plans, regional tourism plans, county
plans, or neighborhood development plans — exist outside the realm of any
single agency. Therefore, successful planning requires enough authority and
resources to assure the plans’ intentions are fulfilled. Basically, the majority
of for-profit planning takes a single entity approach instead of a community
or regional scale approach. When you’re planning for a single organization,
boundaries, authority, and responsibilities are well defined. When the plan-
ning scale is expanded beyond individual organizations to include a commu-
nity, different methods are required.
The next section highlights the key areas where planning for the governmen-
tal entities is different than private sector planning.
Recognizing how governmental 
planning works
Because governmental entities operate as monopolies in most cases, have
elected boards that change every four to six years, and provide services that
are legislated instead of based on market demand, these organizations must
recognize how these factors affect their planning. The following sections con-
tain my advice for how to accommodate some factors that affect governmen-
tal strategic planning.
Leadership
Leaders must win internal and external support for strategic planning. Often
the agency that initiates a plan deliberately seeks community leaders outside
its own organization to head the planning. This strategy helps demonstrate
that the planning is intended to benefit the whole community. Cross-agency
cooperation requires leadership and dedication to get the plan completed
and executed.
316
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Governing board
A broadly representative steering committee of between 10 and 15 members
should be created to oversee the planning. This committee is your governing
board. In governmental planning, it’s common for a few initiators to identify a
larger group of community leaders to form a temporary steering committee.
This brings more authority and resources to the planning table. Additionally,
you can form cross-agency or departmental task forces around key priorities
or goals to help facilitate the implementation. Both the steering committee
and the task forces help cut across agency and departmental lines.
Power and politics
Power and political conflict can be volatile enough to derail planning from its
course. Here are a few examples:
 A regional cultural tourism plan can run up against agencies with com-
peting interests.
 Culture-war based political agendas can erupt in public planning.
 Public-sector initiatives too closely associated with one mayor or county
commission can be dismantled by their successors.
 Even an uncontroversial issue like arts education can evoke conflict
when competitive grants for implementation are at stake.
There are no simple remedies for these conflicts except to be alert for power
issues and try to sidestep the politics before getting embroiled in it. Wise
planners don’t assume that all people have the same interests. Proactive
planners identify potential political power bases and get buy-in at the begin-
ning of the process by recognizing the different interests.
Values and culture
An organization’s culture tends to be more homogeneous than not. Members
of an organization, although potentially diverse, have much in common aris-
ing from their voluntary association with the group. They share many values,
and if they didn’t, they wouldn’t join and stay as staff or volunteers.
Cities, counties, and communities, on the other hand, are more diverse than
most private or nonprofit organizations. A plan for a varied community must
respectfully accommodate those differences if the resulting recommendations
are to be taken seriously. Use assessments that reach people in neighbor-
hoods, job sites, and churches, which represent a community more authenti-
cally than one where consensus depends on those who speak up at a public
hearing in city hall. Be genuinely inclusive.
317
Chapter 17: Planning for the Social Sectors

Administrative systems
Community-wide planners may need to create the administrative systems
that sustain their work. Often the absence of a dependable means of commu-
nication or a system for monitoring the development and execution of a
strategic plan can derail the process. Setup good, clear administrative sys-
tems that keep everyone appraised of the process as well as the results from
their hard work.
Community involvement
Successful governmental plans consider the community to be the con-
stituents on whose behalf the plans are made. Here are a few suggestions:
 Do a community-wide survey or assessment.
 Get your various citizen groups involved in developing your plan.
 Hold community-wide workshops.
 Provide numerous methods for community input such as an online
forum, a discussion board, a primary point of contact, or hotline.
After all, governmental plans are undertaken to fulfill a community need.

Envisioning a bright future
The Minnesota Community Development Joint
Powers Board conducted an extensive commu-
nity survey that resulted in the 2000 Ely Area
Visioning and Land Use Study. Every year, the
board updates the visioning document and uses
the goals from the study as the framework for
its agenda each month.
According to board members, the visioning doc-
ument set out the big picture of how people want
change and development to happen in the
region. After the visioning document was cre-
ated, action items were established that groups
can work together to accomplish. Those action
items are the building blocks to help the area
accomplish the larger goals set out in the vision-
ing statement.
The Ely Area Vision 2000 document looked at
several parts of the community, including edu-
cational, transportation, environmental, and eco-
nomic development goals.
Here are just a few of the area successes:
 Achievement of resurfacing and better
maintenance of area roads
 Secured federal funding for highway
improvements
 Increase communication between the 
Ely Airport and joint powers board to share
the costs of a local match for airport
improvements

Central control of implementation
Central control of a governmental entity plan’s implementation can be quite
difficult. Assuring action on the policy and program plans that characterize
most governmental and community-based organizations can hit roadblocks if
execution isn’t centralized. Centralized control can be achieved by appoint-
ing one or two people within the organization to monitor the execution of the
plan. Everyone in the organization needs to know who’s acting in an over-
sight capacity to move the plan along. With central control, implementation
is more consistent and smooth because problems can be addressed and
solved more quickly.
Getting advice for governmental planning
Here are some tips to help planning in your agency or community:
 Identify specific agencies charged with implementation of clear out-
comes. This only works if named agencies participate in the planning.
 Identify a single, coordinating entity charged with overseeing implemen-
tation. In some cases, the coordinating agency or group is created to
implement the plan.
319

Additional resources for governmental entities
Tons of great resources exist for governmental
strategic planning that can be very helpful in
your planning efforts. Here are just a few rec-
ommendations:
 International City/County Management
Association: This organization is the profes-
sional and educational organization for chief
appointed managers, administrators, and
assistants in cities, towns, counties, and
regional entities throughout the world. On its
Web site, you find a resource library with
outstanding articles on numerous topics 
relevant to the public-sector, including
strategic planning. Some articles are open
whereas others require membership. Check
out the site at www.icma.org.
 Good to Great and the Social Sectors: Why
Business Thinking Is Not the Answer: This
book was published in 2005 by Jim Collins as
a supplement to his popular book Good to
Great. You can also find free articles, pod-
casts, and exercises on his resource-rich
Web site at www.jimcollins.com.
 Internet searches: If you want to see some
examples of governmental strategic plans,
simply use the search term strategic plan in
Google or your favorite search engine. The
search returns numerous agency strategic
plans in the first several results pages.

 Involve respected and representative community and business leaders
in your process.
 Reconvene the planning steering committee periodically to monitor
implementation progress. The expectation of a public accounting for
results can be a powerful incentive to act.
 Plan for the municipality or county to commission a formal evaluation of
the plan two to five years after publication.
 Widely distribute a well-designed plan. Describe goals in general terms
and actively encourage individual groups and agencies to fulfill the plan
as it serves their interests.
Planning for Nonprofit Organizations
Nonprofit staff are often uncomfortable discussing competitiveness or
resource allocation — not because they don’t understand these ideas, but
because they like concentrating on the people they help through their work
instead of these concepts. Unlike for-profit businesses, which compete for
customers and whose very survival depends on providing services or prod-
ucts to satisfied, paying clients, many nonprofit organizations operate in a
non-market, or grants/memberships, economy — one in which services may
not be commercially viable.
Competition is now being introduced into the nonprofit sector. Lack of com-
petition had left little incentive for nonprofit organizations to improve their
services or operations. There was no internal drive to assess whether the
needs of clients or member requests were being met, or to examine the cost-
effectiveness or quality of services being provided. Without the threat of
competition, nonprofit organizations did little to improve their business
processes. So with a growing number of nonprofit organizations offering simi-
lar services, stakeholders want to ensure that the organization is providing
optimal results for the resources they have been given.
Nonprofits are finding that success only increases the number of competitors
entering the field to compete for grants. Growing competition in the nonprofit
market has made grant money and membership contributions scarce, even
as need and demand increase.
Today nonprofit organizations find themselves competing for a small pool of
resources. In order to compete more effectively, today’s executive directors are
required to understand their competitors, rethink their business processes,
create a sustainable competitive advantage, and to increase collaboration,
where appropriate.
320
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 

Redefining competition with the Matrix
(but without Keanu Reeves)
To maximize resources and funding, organizations need to focus on what
they do best and outsource the rest. Easy to say, right? That concept is
harder to do in practice. The MacMillan Matrix, a tool developed by Wharton
School of Business professor Ian MacMillan, was specifically designed to
tackle this task.
The Matrix can help you discover the program areas that are most needed in
your community and that you’re in the best position to provide. The Matrix is
based on the following assumptions:
 Nonprofits should avoid duplicating services to ensure that limited
resources are used well and quality of service is maximized.
 Nonprofits should focus on a limited number of high-quality services,
instead of providing many mediocre services.
 Nonprofits should collaborate so that a continuum of service can be pro-
vided with each partner focusing on specific pieces.
The Matrix therefore helps organizations think about some very pragmatic
questions:
 Are we the best organization to provide this service?
 Is competition good for our clients?
 Are we spreading ourselves too thin, without the capacity to sustain 
ourselves?
 Should we work cooperatively with another organization to provide 
services?
Here is the step-by-step process to apply this Matrix to your organization:
1. Assess each of your programs in relation to the four criteria in the
next four sections; each is placed in the MacMillan Matrix.
For example, a program that’s a good fit is deemed attractive and strong
competitively, but if there’s a high alternative coverage, you would
assign it to Aggressive Competition.
2. Evaluate which programs are worth competing for aggressively and
which ones should be divested.
Critically look at your programs to determine which ones to keep and
which ones to eliminate.
321
Chapter 17: Planning for the Social Sectors

3. Identify whether you have any programs that are a good fit with your
mission.
These programs should have few competitive alternatives, and your
organization’s offering should be very strong. MacMillan refers to these
programs as the Soul of the Agency and describes them as difficult busi-
ness but essential to the members.
A detailed overview of the model can be downloaded at The Forbes Group
Web site (www.forbes.com). The report is free although site registration is
required.
Using the MacMillan Matrix is a fairly straightforward process of assessing
each current (or prospective) program according to four criteria (covered in
the next sections). See Figure 17-1.
#1: Alignment with mission
Services and programs that belong or fit within an organization are in align-
ment with the mission or a good fit. Criteria for a good fit include
 Supports the purpose and mission of the organization
 Draws on existing skills in the organization
 Shares resources and coordinate activities with programs

#2: Program attractiveness
Program attractiveness is the degree to which a program is attractive to the
organization from an economic perspective, such as whether the program
easily attracts resources. Here’s a list of criteria that makes a program 
attractive:
 High appeal to groups capable of providing current and future support
and stable funding
 Need from a large client base and low resistance to program
 Appeal to volunteers
 Measurable, reportable program results
 Able to discontinue with relative ease, if necessary
 Intended to promote the self-sufficiency or self-rehabilitation of
client base
#3: Alternative coverage
Alternative coverage is the number of other organizations that deliver a simi-
lar program to similar constituents. If there are no other large, or very few
small, comparable programs being provided in the same region, the program
is classified as low coverage. Otherwise, the coverage is high.
#4: Competitive position
Competitive position is the degree to which the organization has a stronger
capability and potential to deliver the program than other agencies. Most
programs can’t be classified as being in a strong competitive position unless
they have some clear basis for declaring superiority over all competitors in
that program category. Criteria for a strong competitive position include
 Good location and delivery system
 Large pool of loyal clients, communities, or support groups
 Past success of securing funding and ability to raise funds, particularly
for this type of program
 Superior track record (or image) of service delivery
 Better quality service or service delivery than competitors with the
most cost effective delivery of service
 Superiority of technical skills and organizational skills needed for the
program
 Ability to conduct needed research into the program and properly moni-
tor program performance
323
Chapter 17: Planning for the Social Sectors

Five years ago, there was little funding for case management by AIDS Service
Organizations. Unwilling to let clients fend for themselves in getting the help
they needed, many organizations devoted staff time to this service. At the
time, this was a soul of the agency program. These days, this program is more
attractive (fundable), although there’s also growing alternative coverage.
Therefore, organizations in a strong position to serve the clients well, with
cultural competence and program expertise, should aggressively compete.
Those in a weak competitive position should get out of the business.
Specific strategies for nonprofits
Listed below are several strategies applicable to both the organizational and
program levels, adapted from Philip Kotler’s Strategic Marketing for Nonprofit
Organizations. This list helps generate ideas and goals about how your orga-
nization can reach its vision. As you review this list, take note of what strate-
gies you’re employing or ones that you could be.
 Surplus maximization: An organization runs in a manner that increases
the amount of resources on hand. Usually this strategy is adopted to
accumulate resources for expansion or growth.
324
Part V: Creating and Making the Most of Your Plan 
Additional resources for nonprofits
As all executive directors know, the nonprofit
world shares information freely and openly.
Here is a list of a few resources that help non-
profits with their strategic planning:
 Strategic Planning for Nonprofit Organiza-
tions: A Practical Guide and Workbook:
This resource was written by Michael
Allison and Jude Kaye and is outstanding
for nonprofit planners because it provides a
comprehensive set of worksheets for all
aspects of nonprofit planning.
 Compass Point’s Nonprofit Genie: This
resource provides free information about
nonprofit topics including strategic planning.
Check them out online at the following site:
www.compasspoint.com/askgenie.
 Alliance for Nonprofit Management: This
group is a professional association of indi-
viduals and organizations devoted to improv-
ing the management and governance
capacity of nonprofits and to assist nonprof-
its in fulfilling their mission. The association’s
Web site has a host of free resources dedi-
cated to nonprofit management. Visit www.
allianceonline.org.

 Revenue maximization: An organization manages itself to generate the
highest possible revenues, perhaps in an effort to establish a reputation
or critical mass.
 Usage maximization: Organizations work to serve the highest number of
users of their services. This strategy can be used to position the organi-
zation or program for funding or budgetary purposes.
 Usage targeting: An organization provides services in a manner that
encourages serving a specific number or type of constituents. This strat-
egy is used to address unmet needs of specific populations or to cover
the costs associated with providing services.
 Full cost recovery: An organization manages its programs and services
so that it financially breaks even, providing as much service as the
finances allow. Many nonprofits adopt this strategy in an effort to pro-
vide services without entering fiscal crisis.
 Partial cost recovery: Organization operate with a chronic deficit every
year, providing services that are critical and can’t be provided at a
breakeven level of costs (for example, mass transit or the post office).
These organizations rely on public and private foundations, individuals,
and governments to cover the annual deficit.
 Budget maximization: An organization maximizes the size of its staff,
services, and operating expenditures regardless of revenue/cost levels.
Organizations that are concerned with reputation and the impact of
trimming services or infrastructure on that reputation employ this 
strategy.
 Producer satisfaction maximization: An organization operates toward a
goal of satisfying the personal/professional needs of a founder, staff, or
board of directors instead of the established needs of external clients
and customers.
 Fees for service: An organization provides services to clients for a fee.
The fee is typically below market rates and doesn’t cover the full cost of
providing the services.
 Retrenchment strategies: An organization emphasizes efforts to reduce
internal costs to offset the potential or real loss of revenues or grant
monies. Examples include increasing staff workloads, increasing use of
part-time or volunteer staff, eliminating services or programs, or reduc-
ing non-fixed expenses such as training or supplies.
Whew! Is that it? I’m sure you’ll have all of these in place by tomorrow! In all
seriousness, pick one or two strategies that you think could be the most
effective in your organization and use them to develop the basis of your
strategic plan.

Scouting out the new future for girls
The Girl Scouts of America is in the throes of
what’s arguably one of the biggest transforma-
tions in a nonprofit organization ever and pro-
vides a great example of an approach to
planning. Girl Scouts was founded in 1912, and
although 2012 may seem far away, that’s the
organization’s 100th anniversary. Because of
this milestone, the leaders decided to scrutinize
how they serve girls, how they recruit and use
the dedicated service of volunteers, how they
attract donors, and how they govern them-
selves. The executives keenly realized that the
lives of girls are changing, and so the Girl
Scouts too must change.
In June 2004, Girl Scout leadership enlisted the
services of Willie Pietersen, a professor of the
Practice of Management at Columbia Business
School, to help the Girl Scouts develop a strat-
egy to ensure their future success and growth.
After identifying the Girls Scouts’ strengths,
challenges, and imperatives for success, they
zeroed in on five strategic priorities that now
represent the organization’s focus:
 Program Model and Pathways: Building the
best-integrated personal leadership devel-
opment model that defines activities and
outcomes, differentiated by age level, for
girls 5-17, and offers flexible pathways for
participation
 Volunteerism: Developing a nimble, state-
of-the-art model of volunteerism that mobi-
lizes a variety of volunteers committed to
the Girl Scout mission
 Brand: Transforming the Girl Scout image
with a compelling, contemporary brand
 Funding: Substantially increasing con-
tributed income to fund a vibrant Girl Scout
organization
 Organizational Structure and Governance:
Creating an efficient and effective organi-
zational structure and democratic gover-
nance system
With these strategic priorities in place, the next
step was implementing this major shift. The
solution was to form six Gap Teams comprised
of a variety of Girl Scout members from all
levels, functions, and geographic regions of the
organization. The Gap Teams are charged with
identifying the transformations needed to move
Girl Scouts from the organization it is now to the
organization it can become. This organizational
transformation is expected to continue through
2008. The result is expected to be an improved
organization to serve the changing needs of
girls and provide a new direction for the future
of the Girl Scouts.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
E
very For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. This part
neatly sections off important things to know in groups
of ten. In this part, you discover ten ways to keep your
strategic plan off the shelf and dust free. You also uncover
some pitfalls of strategic planning and ways to ruin your
strategic planning meeting. Lastly, I give you ten shortcuts
to getting your plan done.

Chapter 18
Ten Ways to Keep Your Strategic
Plan from Hitting the Shelf
In This Chapter
 Making your strategic plan a living document
 Avoiding a strategic plan that gathers dust
M
ore often than not, life and day-to-day operations take over a well-
intentioned strategic plan implementation. If the strategic plan is one
more thing everyone has to do, it begins to feel like a burden instead of being
exciting. By embedding your strategic planning into daily operations, com-
pleting items on your strategic plan becomes natural instead of something
extra or something you pull off the bookshelf and review only when you
happen to remember it’s there. This chapter covers ten quick ways to keep
your strategic plan from landing on the shelf and collecting dust.
Getting Everyone Involved from the Start
Make your organization’s plan everyone’s plan. Start by involving everyone
on your staff from the start of the plan. If you only look to the folks at the top
of your company, you’re making a recipe for failure, because employees at all
levels aren’t only a wealth of information, but also they’re the implementers
of your plan. You need them to feel part of the planning process, even if they
don’t have a seat at the table.
As you read the chapters in this book, you find references to group exercises
and employee feedback. Use this info to help develop a strategic plan that
everyone feels part of, and assign every staff member a goal or objective.
Then everyone has direct responsibility for achieving a piece of the organiza-
tion’s strategy.

Deleting the Fluff
The sure death of a strategic plan is entombing it in hundreds of pages of
text. Less is more. Delete the nonessential text that just clutters up the page.
What are the essentials of your plan? See Chapter 1, which outlines the major
pieces of your plan.
My Web site, www.mystrategicplan.com, provides a good example of a
strategic plan that does not have any fluff.
Your strategic plan isn’t a business plan. Your strategic plan is a guide and a
roadmap that tells how to get from where you are to where you want to be.
Every part of your plan has a role in clearly defining that journey. Unlike a
business plan, you’re not explaining your business to the reader. You, your
staff, and board are the readers of the plan. It’s not a sales piece. It’s an
action piece.
Appointing a Strategy Engineer
Appoint someone (other than yourself) to be the go-to person for the strate-
gic plan. Anoint him or her as the strategy engineer who’s responsible for
 Keeping track of your progress through the use of a scorecard (see
Chapter 14)
 Getting updates from managers and staff on goals, objectives, and 
action plans
 Organizing meetings and communications about the strategic plan
Creating a Strategic Plan Poster
By putting your strategic plan on one huge page, you keep your strategic plan
from even touching the shelf (unless, of course, you have a really big shelf).
Yes, you need back-up documentation, which can be in that three-ring binder
on a shelf, but put the key parts of your strategic plan on one page. Blow the
page up at your local print shop and hang it in your breakroom or common
area. The poster helps keep everyone focused on your organization’s strate-
gic direction.
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Hooking Achievement into Incentives
Everyone likes to be rewarded for a job well done. Dangling a carrot out there
for successfully implementing your strategic plan is a sure way to get some
action. Incentives take all different shapes and colors. The green kind (ahem,
money) is always welcome, but you can develop all sorts of creative perks.
By paying for performance, you elevate the importance of your strategic
plan. See Chapter 14 for additional considerations.
Using a KISS
When all else fails — Keep It Simple, Stupid. (Sorry, I don’t like calling anyone
stupid, but that’s what the last S of KISS stands for.) For your strategic plan to
be implemented, everyone in your organization has to understand it. Failing
prey to big business lingo and confusing jargon diminishes the effectiveness
of your plan. It’s really easy to develop a confusing strategic plan, so resist
the urge.
Holding a Monthly Strategy Meeting
Groan . . . another meeting? Well, yes and no. Replace one of your regularly
scheduled staff meetings with a strategy meeting. Meetings about strategy
can be exciting and people want to be involved. The purpose of the meeting
is to discuss the status of your plan. Cross off what’s been completed.
Troubleshoot if something isn’t happening. Make changes where needed.
If your meetings are boring, spice them up a bit. Ask each employee to report
on one or two accomplishments. Limit everyone’s report to one minute (have
someone keep time). For people who are having an issue or problem where
they need help, ask them to list it on the board. Spend 10 to 15 minutes as a
group working to solve the issue. Remember, the issues need to be related to
the strategic plan; otherwise, they should be discussed at another time. Don’t
let the meetings run over; keep them to a set time.
You may be surprised at the enthusiasm and effectiveness of this type of
meeting. People like to talk about strategy. It’s exciting! It’s also exciting to
accomplish important initiatives. See Chapter 14 for more info about how to
hold effective strategy meetings.
331
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Your Strategic Plan from Hitting the Shelf

Using a Scorecard
Keeping your plan alive requires constant communication, which can seem
like too big of a task and may just fall to the wayside. But if your staff doesn’t
know where they stand, it’s impossible to keep implementing your plan. Some
people like to play ignorant and ignorance is bliss.
Use a scorecard to keep everyone in the loop. A scorecard provides a quick
snapshot of who’s contributing and who isn’t. The scorecard allows you to
track the progress of each goal by listing the status of the goal each month.
Ideally, you’ve developed goals that are measurable. With measurable goals,
you have numbers associated with the status of each goal every month.
Think about your scorecard as your one-page progress report of every goal in
your plan. Turn the scorecard into charts and graphs, and you have a quick
visual that communicates your progress and is fun to look at! The scorecard
may also help with employees holding each other accountable for each other’s
part in meeting the strategic plan. Chapter 14 explains scorecards in detail.
Leading by Example
Be a purposeful leader and your people will follow. There’s no better way to
keep your plan alive than through your leadership. Your complete and total
commitment is critical to the success of your plan. If you pull back, even just
a little, it gives everyone a license to slack off. So talk about your organiza-
tion’s strategy regularly. Use it in conversations with clients, customers, and
board members. Ask questions of your staff about its progress — is it work-
ing or not? When making budget decisions, point back to your plan. Does the
budget fit into your plan?
Celebrating Your Success — 
Whenever You Feel Like It
Too often you’re so focused on tomorrow’s tasks that you forget to recognize
today’s successes. Don’t wait until the end of the year to recognize achieve-
ment. Celebrate small successes along the way! Did you achieve a big goal?
Have a pizza party. Take the staff to lunch. Give everyone the day off. Go on a
fun outing. No matter how big or small, by celebrating success along the way
you keep everyone excited, engaged, and motivated to keep working.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Ruin Your Strategic
Planning Meeting
In This Chapter
 Improving the success of your planning meetings
 Avoiding typical pitfalls of strategic planning meetings
T
he three words strategic planning retreat provoke reactions anywhere
from sheer exuberance to ducking for cover. In many organizations,
retreats have a bad reputation because it’s easy to step into one of the many
planning pitfalls. Holding effective meetings can be tough, and if you add a lot
of brainpower mixed with personal agendas, and you can have a recipe for
disaster. That’s why so many strategic planning meetings are unsuccessful.
The sections in this chapter focus on the ten guaranteed ways to ruin your
next meeting.
Refusing to Use a Facilitator
If you were having a party for 100 of your closest friends, assuming money
was no object, would you cook for all of them or hire a caterer? More than
likely, you’d hire a caterer. Not because you’re incapable of whipping up
potato salad, burgers, and homemade fries, but because it’s more fun to sit
back, relax, and enjoy the party. Besides, a caterer is trained and paid to
make sure that everything goes smoothly. Why take on the extra stress?
A strategic planning meeting is no different. You or someone else in your
organization are more than capable of running the meeting, but it’s not the
best approach. By hiring a facilitator, you can be fully engaged in the strategy
and planning and leave meeting process and structure to someone else.
Furthermore, hiring a facilitator is better because he or she can remain
totally impartial.

Make sure to find a facilitator who understands and runs strategic planning
meetings regularly. You want someone who can keep the meeting on task and
guide the process so you achieve the desired outcome of a strategic plan.
Outline the process:
 Sit down with the facilitator prior to the meeting. 
 Make sure he fully understands what success looks like to you. 
 Clearly explain your desired outcome, what business you are in, the
strategic issues you’re facing, and the dynamics of your team.
The best way to find a facilitator is through referrals. Tap into your business
associates or your business networks for their contacts. Check out Chapter 3
for a list of what to look for in a good facilitator.
Neglecting to Conduct Any Research
Before the Meeting
Picture this: You pick a date or series of dates for your strategic planning
meetings, and the next thing you know, it’s tomorrow. You get so caught up 
in the day-to-day operations that you don’t have time to think strategically
about your business. And it’s necessary to think strategically in order to set
up your strategic planning meeting effectively.
If you neglect to conduct research before the meeting, you get into your ses-
sion and realize you don’t have the information you need in order to make
sound strategic decisions. The only way to have a solid strategic plan is to
incorporate information about your external environment and your internal
operations. The chapters in Part III help you identify the types of data and
information you need to research for your strategic planning effort.
Some research is better than none. So if you find yourself in a pinch the day
before or the day of the meeting, do what you can to get data about your 
customers’ needs, your competitors’ actions, and your employees’ opinions.
Inviting Everyone
The old cliché that too many cooks spoil the broth couldn’t be closer to the
truth. Although it’s imperative that key employees have a voice in planning,
not everyone has to literally be at the meeting table. Too many people in the
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

room can lead to chaos and confusion, resulting in a strategic plan by com-
mittee instead of through educated decisions and leadership.
If you have a lot of people who want to participate in the process, include
them in a couple of different ways:
 Collect employees’ thoughts and opinions via an employee survey.
Check out Chapter 5 for an example of an employee survey used for
strategic planning. Also in that chapter, you find a set of actions to take
with the information you collected.
 Hold a series of meetings. Perhaps the first and last meetings are with
your senior management team and a couple meetings in between are
with key employees and staff. In either case, you’ve collected ideas and
opinions that are valuable to developing your plan, but you’ve reserved
the right to make the final decisions about what actions you take.
Groups of between 10 to 15 are the ideal size for strategic planning meetings.
If you have more people than that, you can always break up into small teams.
Holding an Annual Retreat
Huh? Isn’t this section about holding strategic planning retreats? Yes, it is.
But one common thought process in strategic planning is that you have to
hold a retreat. Setting aside a couple of days in an off-site location where
everyone gathers in their sweatshirt and jeans drinking cocoa is a typical
vision of a strategic planning meeting. Oftentimes a retreat is an annual event
and all strategic decision making is reserved for that occasion.
Strategic planning should be a habit, not an event. Hold your strategy meet-
ings regularly (more than once a year) to realize enhanced performance. With
that said, annual retreats are okay, but make sure that they aren’t your only
meetings of the year. See Chapter 14 for more discussion on this topic.
Getting through the Agenda 
No Matter What
Strategic planning is hard work. It takes a lot of mental energy to pull all the
pieces of the puzzle together, see the future, make strategic decisions, and
organize the plan usefully. At every strategic planning meeting I’ve facilitated,
335
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Ruin Your Strategic Planning Meeting

people are mentally exhausted by the end. Getting through the agenda is usu-
ally what it takes to have a completed plan. However, sometimes it’s just not
possible to get it all done.
Have an agenda so everyone knows the structure of the day, but don’t be so
rigid that you stick to it no matter what. Remember to loosen up, have some
fun, and take breaks. If you don’t get through everything, plan another meet-
ing or assign tasks for the outstanding items.
Forgetting to Explain the Process
A good facilitator makes sure to explain the strategic planning process and
the expected outcome of the meeting from the get-go. Most people think they
know how to develop a strategic plan, but that doesn’t mean that they truly
can do it. Naturally you don’t want to insult anyone’s intelligence, but do take
the time to review the different terms used in strategic planning and each
step of the process. By making sure that everyone starts on the same page,
you eliminate any confusion that may derail your meeting.
Assuming Everyone Thinks Like You
Of course, everyone thinks like you do, right? As a good leader, you know
that’s not the case. Unfortunately sometimes you forget what’s obvious and
end up structuring a meeting based on your own preferences. In reality, it’s
pretty hard to step into other people’s shoes and ways of thinking. But in
strategic planning, you want everyone in the room engaged.
To get everyone engaged, make sure to secure a comfortable environment.
People feel the most comfortable when they’re operating in their own 
thinking preference. Do you see any of your team members in the following
descriptions?
 Some people enjoy big picture thinking. These people get fired up 
talking about the mission, vision, and long-term strategies of the 
organization.
 Some people find big picture discussions frustrating. They’d rather get
down to business. This group wants to know what you’re going to do
this year, who’s going to do it, and when it’s going to be done. These
people are your goal setters and action planners.
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Another group wants to analyze all possible options before making a
decision. This group wants to feel completely comfortable with the
direction selected. These analyzers are great at synthesizing data from
the SWOT and developing your SWOT. To some people, this tactic may
feel like the discussion is going in circles.
 The last group of people want to make sure that all opinions are included.
They’re the ones who don’t want to move on until everyone in the room
has voiced their ideas. This group is your meeting minders. They make
sure everyone is buying into the plan that’s being developed.
You may not have all thinking types in your planning session, but by acknowl-
edging that not everyone is going to be comfortable in all aspects of the 
planning process, you can structure the meeting and manage the discussion
accordingly. To do so, first ask your employees which of the four thinking
types they most closely identify with. Then explain which part of your agenda
addresses each thinking type. In the preceding list, I indicate a part of the
planning process where each type can shine.
Ignoring the Elephant in the Room
Would you like to see a strategic planning meeting go down in flames? Forge
ahead, even though you know you have some staff issues. If any key staff
member is upset or has an outstanding problem, your strategic planning
meeting may be disrupted. That person may sit in the meeting like a brood-
ing elephant and finally blow his top and get the meeting off course.
The best way to handle staff concerns is to have a one-on-one discussion
with every person who will be attending the strategic planning session. Give
your employee the opportunity to voice issues or concerns privately. Make
sure that you clarify that your intent is to clear up any problems that may
inhibit full participation during the strategy session.
Ending on a Low Note
You did it! You successfully made it all the way through your strategic plan-
ning meeting. You accomplished everything you intended. You have the key
pieces of your strategic plan in place. You’re feeling great. Everyone is slowly
packing up their stuff and heading out the door, but you sense a feeling of
exhaustion and maybe a little anxiety. You’re wondering why.
337
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Ruin Your Strategic Planning Meeting

What just happened is that you unintentionally ended your strategic planning
meeting on a low note. In most cases, you have more to cover in your meet-
ing than you have time for. You end up rushing the last part of the meeting to
get it all done. I recommend, no matter where you are in your agenda, struc-
turing the last half-hour of the meeting to end on a high note by getting every-
one excited about the new strategic direction.
The best way to get people jazzed about the plan is to have them visualize suc-
cess. What does success look like? Help your team feel successful by living the
future today. Ask your team to draw a picture of what the company may look
like if you achieve your strategic plan. How many employees? What is the office
like? Where are you located? Who are your customers? What’s the media
saying? And so on. Then have them explain their vision to the group. After the
drawings and explanations are over, tell your staff members to hang their cre-
ations at their desks to remind them of the plan and their part in it. That way,
everyone leaves the planning session feeling successful instead of overworked.
Overlooking Life After the Meeting
The absolute worst thing you can do is continue business as usual, as if there
never was a strategic planning meeting. Not only have you wasted everyone’s
time and your money, but also getting people to participate in the future is
next to impossible.
Committing time and resources to implementing the plan is almost more
important than the plan itself. Don’t underestimate how much effort it takes
to get the plan moving. Here are a few tips:
 Within a week after your strategic planning meeting, send out a timeline
that contains the next steps and deadlines for completing the plan. Make
sure to communicate this timeline to everyone in your organization so
your employees know what’s happening with the process.
 Do not, under any circumstance, cancel the next meeting in your plan-
ning or implementation process. As the leader, you’re responsible for
setting the example that the strategic plan is important. Canceling a
meeting signifies it isn’t important.
 Send out the strategic plan on the deadline you set, regardless if it’s
complete. You reinforce the importance of the plan.
 Post a visible result of the planning session in a common area. Items to
post include your mission, vision, and values statements or a poster of
your strategic plan.
Flip back to Chapter 14 for more ideas on how to implement your plan.

Ten Shortcuts to Getting 
Your Plan Done
In This Chapter
 Moving your plan to completion
 Steering clear of common roadblocks
C
ompleting your strategic plan is on your to-do list, right? But is it slip-
ping lower and lower down the list? I know that feeling. And don’t worry,
you’re not alone! In fact, I would wager that everyone reading this book is
struggling with the same problem. Completing your strategic plan is arguably
one of the most important things you have to do, so this chapter has a list of
shortcuts to help you scratch your plan off your list. Some of these shortcuts
work together, whereas others contradict one another. Use the ones that
work for you and ignore the rest.
Focus on Your Top Five
Identify the top five strategic issues facing your organization right now. Write
these down, along with what you need to do in the next 90 days to start
achieving each one.
Although it’s important to have a written strategic plan that includes your
mission, vision, values, strategic objectives, goals, and actions, sometimes
that’s just too big of a mountain to climb. By identifying the five most impor-
tant things you want to accomplish over the next few years, you bring focus
and direction to your organization. You start taking baby steps toward your
goal instead of waiting until you have a full plan together to start acting.

Remember That Something 
Is Better than Nothing
If you’ve made it partially through your plan, but can’t seem to complete it,
remember that something is better than nothing. Instead of beating yourself
up for not having a plan that’s 100 percent complete, just work with what you
have. The majority of organizations don’t even have a written plan, so the
fact that you have a partially completed one puts you a step above the rest.
Each year your plan can grow and change:
 The first year: You embark on strategic planning, and the resulting plan
is sufficient, but not as robust as you like. Why? Primarily because you
end up spending a fair bit of time developing your mission, vision,
values, and competitive advantage. By the time you get to strategic
objectives, goals, and action plans, you’re ready to be done planning.
Write down a few objectives, goals, and actions. Make them more robust
in year two.
 The second year: The plan is substantially better than the previous one
because you’re clear on where you are and where you’re headed. This
year you can spend the majority of your effort on objectives, goals, and
action plans.
 The third year: The strategic plan is truly a complete picture of the orga-
nization’s strategic direction. With two years under your belt, you know
what works and doesn’t work for your company. Your plan becomes the
living document that’s a true representation of your company because
you’ve refined your process and your strategy.
With this in mind, put something down on paper and start working with it,
even though you know it isn’t as good as it could be. Over the course of a few
years and working with an ever-evolving strategic plan, you can develop a
plan that meets your expectations. See Chapter 14 for ideas on working
through your implementation process and how your plan can evolve.
Start Implementing Soon Because 
No Plan Is Ever Complete
Your strategic plan is a work in progress. Even for those businesses that have
been planning year after year, no plan is ever complete — there’s always
more that you could do. But don’t fall into the trap that you need a complete
plan before you start implementing it or you may be waiting forever. See
Chapter 14 for ideas on implementation.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The reason your plan can’t ever be complete is because business situations
are constantly in flux. Just when you think you’ve got everything nailed
down, something in your environment changes. Recognize the dynamic
atmosphere you operate in and know that your plan can’t be stagnant either.
Because of this fact, your plan is about 90 percent done at all times, and give
yourself permission to believe that’s good enough.
Eat the Elephant One Bite at a Time
Thinking about strategic planning can be like trying to eat an elephant — it’s
so big, you don’t know where to start. Instead of diving in, back away until
you feel brave enough to tackle the beast. Consider eating the elephant one
bite at a time, instead of swallowing it whole.
Use this analogy to tackle your strategic plan. Break your planning down into
to realistic chunks so the tasks feel doable, and complete one part of your
plan each week. Use the outline in Chapter 3 as a guide. By doing so, you can
finish your plan in eight to ten weeks!
Knock Your Plan Out in One Day
If you’re more of a marathon runner and less of a sprinter, consider knocking
your plan out in one day. Lock the doors. Turn off the phones. Ignore your
e-mail. Pull your team together for one long strategy session. And don’t leave
the room until the plan is done.
A couple of things can make this process go more smoothly:
 Have a clear agenda and a timekeeper. Move on to the next item when
the time allotted is up.
 Come prepared with your internal and external analysis data and
research. Ideally, have everyone read the material ahead of time.
 Appoint a person to organize the plan based on the work completed.
This person should also take complete notes of the session for reference
after the strategy session.
 Take a break every one and a half to two hours. Make sure that you’re
in a place that’s easy to get outside for some fresh air.
 Have a lot of snack foods and order in a good lunch. Everyone likes to
munch.

Chapter 20: Ten Shortcuts to Getting Your Plan Done

 Plan some fun games. You can only work so hard for so long, so reward
your team by having fun during the day or a nice outing afterwards. You
can build games into the strategic planning process. See the end of
Chapter 3 for some ideas. Because your time is compressed, make sure
to limit any games to 15 to 20 minutes.
Get Out of Town
For some people, shutting out the world can only happen when you leave
town. If you’re in this group of folks, block out a few days at your favorite 
getaway and get out of Dodge. Changing your surroundings helps free up
your mind to think more broadly about your organization and its strategic
direction.
Escaping with your whole team may not be practical; so if it isn’t, take the
time yourself to work on at least your mission, vision, values, and strategic
objectives. After these elements are fleshed out, you can work with your staff
to hammer out short-term goals and action items.
Outsource It
It’s amazing how much you can accomplish in a short amount of time when
you have others helping you. Enlist your business coach, a strategic planning
consultant, or another advisor that you contract with to be responsible for
the major portions of completing your plan. Schedule meetings every two
weeks where you talk about each element of your plan, and, by the end of a
few months, you’ll have a completed plan.
The trick is to have your consultant or business coach create your strategic
plan based on your meetings. So after each meeting, he or she completes
another section of your plan based on your conversations. The person you
outsource to isn’t responsible for coming up with all the information.
Leave Perfection to the Accountants
You hire accountants to be perfect when they handle your books. You don’t
need to be such a perfectionist when you set out to complete your strategic
plan. Your plan can be missing some sections or lacking dates, measures, and
maybe even some goals. Some minor details may not be complete, but take a
deep breath; it’s okay. Your plan can still serve the purpose of providing
focus and direction to your organization.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If you’d like your plan to be as complete as possible, use estimates or best
guesses to fill in certain sections. Then come back to the plan in a few weeks
to fill in any major gaps.
Get Everyone to Pitch In
Your team is one of your most valuable assets. Managers have a tendency to
go it alone, thinking that the task at hand is only theirs to conquer. But with
your strategic plan, don’t think you need to put it together yourself. Get your
employees to help develop the guts of your plan. Ask every team member to
take a strategic objective and develop goals, measurements, targets, dead-
lines, and action plans (where relevant) for their objective. See Chapter 13 
for guidance.
Splitting the work up seems like less of a burden on you and also gets your
staff involved. If you’re worried about the end result, set the stage correctly
so your team understands that the final plan is reviewed and modified 
by you.
Just Do It
Sometimes getting your plan done just requires a little push. So here is your
push! Oh, sorry. Did that hurt? Get committed and finish your plan so you
can start reaping the rewards of having a solid, intentional strategic direction
for your organization. I promise you won’t regret the time you spend on
strategic planning. You’ll realize the benefits for years to come. So, borrow
some encouragement from that famous shoe slogan, and just do it!
