PREFACE
The tenth edition of ELECTRICITY 3 has been updated to provide more topics and concepts 
to  better reflect the current workplace. At the same time, the text has retained the features and 
style of previous editions that have made it so popular.
The text introduces the concepts of power generation and distribution. The material 
is broken down into short segments that concentrate on specific concepts or applications of 
particular types of equipment. The detailed explanations are written in easy-to-understand 
language and concisely present the needed information. Many illustrations and photographs 
help provide  technical understanding and real-world references. This type of explanation and 
application better prepares the student to perform effectively on the job in installing, trouble-
shooting, repairing, and servicing electrical power generation and delivery.
The knowledge obtained in this book permits the student to progress further in the study 
of electrical systems. The study of electricity and the application of electrical products are con-
tinually changing. The electrical industry constantly introduces new and improved devices and 
material that lead to changes in installation and operation of equipment. Electrical codes also 
change to reflect industry needs. It is essential that students continue to learn and update their 
knowledge of current procedures and practices.
The text is easy to read and the units have been grouped by general subject areas. 
Summaries in each unit restate the most important topics of the unit. Summaries of unit group-
ings provide reviews of topical areas.
Each unit begins with the learning objectives. An Achievement Review at the end of each unit 
provides an opportunity for readers to check their understanding of the material in small increments 
before proceeding. The problems in the text sometimes require the use of simple algebra. Students 
should be familiar with the math before trying to solve the equations. It is also essential that readers 
have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of electrical circuits and basic electrical concepts.
It is recommended that the most recent edition of the National Electrical Code® 
(published by the National Fire Protection Association [NFPA]) be available for reference and 
use as the learner uses this text. Application of state and local codes and regulations should also 
be consulted when making actual installations.
Features of the tenth edition include the addition of a unit on alternative power sources 
which include wind-powered generation, hydrogen fuel cells, microturbine generation,

and solar photovoltaic power production. These alternative forms of power supplies are 
described and then linked to the National Electrical Code®, where applicable, to enhance the 
understanding of where and how these sources are used. An alternate form for a UPS system 
is described, to be used for short duration operation in place of battery backup systems.
Other features include
• Organization of topics into related topics and associated concepts
• Updated photos and artwork to reflect current equipment and practices
• Content updated to the most recent electrical code
• Additional information on generation systems
• Coverage of transformers and connections
• Summaries and Achievement Reviews at the end of each unit
An Instructor Guide for ELECTRICITY 3 is available. The guide includes the answers 
to the Achievement Reviews and Summary Reviews and additional test questions. Instructors 
may use these questions to devise tests to evaluate student learning.

ELECTRICAL SAFETY
Working on electrical systems can be dangerous. If you are working on live exposed conduc-
tive paths and the voltage is over 50 volts to ground, the potential for electrocution exists. The 
potential for arc burns or explosions also exists when working on live electrical systems. The 
United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specific guidelines 
to follow when working on live equipment. The OSHA documents that primarily affect practic-
ing electrical workers are found in the OSHA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 29–1910. 
The regulations have many subparts that specify requirements whether you are doing electrical 
construction or electrical maintenance. In addition to OSHA, the National Electrical Code® 
refers to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) document 70E. This NFPA document 
was developed by the organization that develops the National Electrical Code® (NEC®). 
NFPA 70E correlates the requirements of OSHA and interprets them for use by electri-
cal personnel. The 70E document is considered a consensus standard, which means governing 
agencies may adopt or consent to use it as a standard. NFPA 70E and OSHA standards are very 
similar in intent; 70E interprets the standards in application-related terms. NFPA 70E provides 
guidelines on safe work practices, information on how to determine arc flash boundaries, and 
guides on what personal protective equipment (PPE) to use in various situations. 
YOUR SAFETY IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. Although agencies and organizations try 
to provide guidelines and practices to follow, it is up to you to be as safe as possible in your work 
responsibilities. If at all possible, disconnect power from all the circuits with which you will 
come in contact. You must check for the presence of electrical energy, and then you must lock 
out the system to prevent accidental re-energization. The term “Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO)” 
is often used to ensure that you place your personal lock on a disconnection point and then tag 
it with your name to identify that you are working on the circuit. No one should remove your 
lock without your knowledge and consent. 
There are cases when you will work on systems that are energized. OSHA requires that 
you have a thorough knowledge of the precautions and procedures to follow. You must have 
documented training and verification that you are knowledgeable of the dangers involved, you 
know the precautionary techniques to use, you are aware of the electrocution hazards, and you

understand the hazards of arc flash. You must wear appropriate PPE that has been determined 
adequate to protect you from the inherent hazards. The PPE includes specifications for the 
proper clothing and hand and face protection as well as properly rated tools. You must use 
meters and test gear that accurately test for conditions that are present. You must have a plan 
to follow if an accident occurs and you need help. There are rules for the number of people who 
need to be present and there are rules for entering a confined space. Be aware of underground 
installations and the need for fresh air to breathe. If the environment is hazardous, for example, 
if gas vapors, dust, or fiber material are present, take further precautions as required. 
Arc flash is a danger that is present as you work on live equipment, even if you do not 
physically touch the conductors with your hands. Electrocution or severe shock may result in 
contact with the live conductors, but the arc causes damage without contact. The arc that can 
occur between live parts, or live parts and a grounded surface, releases a great deal of thermal 
energy. The arc produces magnetic energy and air pressure energy known as the blast. This 
energy can knock you down or knock the air from your lungs. This same blast creates noise 
that can damage your hearing. The light produced from the arc may damage your eyesight. The 
amount of energy that may affect you depends on the type of fault, the amount of short-circuit 
current available at the arc, the voltage available, and your proximity to the fault. The arc heat 
energy is rated in calories, and the protective clothing you wear must meet or exceed the num-
ber of calories present in a possible arc. Your hands must be protected from accidental contact 
by using gloves that meet or exceed the voltage rating of the circuit. See the figure showing 
 voltage-rated gloves with leather protection. Your tools must be marked with the voltage rating 
for the circuit. Voltage-rated tools are pictured in the accompanying figure.

A DC generator changes mechanical energy into electrical energy. It furnishes electrical 
energy only when driven at a definite speed by some form of prime mover, such as a diesel 
engine or a steam turbine.
DC generators are used principally in electrical systems for mobile equipment. They are 
also used in power plants supplying DC power for factories and in certain railway systems. DC 
power is used extensively in communication systems and for battery charging and electroplating 
operations. The generation of electromotive force (EMF) is described in detail in Electricity 1.
In a DC generator, the output voltage is a DC voltage, even though alternating current 
(AC) is generated in the generator coils. In other words, one of the output terminals is always 
negative (−), and the other output terminal is always positive (+). The external circuit is the 
load connected to the generator. It receives current from the negative terminal of the generator 
and returns it to the positive terminal of the generator.
DC GENERATOR COMPONENTS
The essential parts of a DC generator are shown in Figures 1–1 and 1–2. The member that 
spins is called the rotor. The rotor is a cylindrical, laminated iron core that is mechanically 
coupled to the drive shaft of the generator. An armature winding is embedded in the slots on 
FIGURE 1–1 Compound generator fields with commutating poles.

the surface of the rotor. The armature windings have voltage induced into them as the rotor 
spins past the field poles.
The armature is the component of the generator that has the voltage (EMF) induced 
into it. The internal circuit of the generator supplies electrons to the negative output terminal 
of the generator and creates a deficit of electrons at the positive terminal of the generator. The 
electrons are drawn from the load back to the positive terminal of the generator. The armature 
is composed of coils of copper conductors that are terminated at the commutator segments. The 
commutator segments and the connection to the sliding carbon brushes provide the mechani-
cal rectification needed to convert the induced alternating-current EMF within the armature to 
the direct-current EMF at the carbon brush connections to the load.
A commutator consists of a series of copper segments that are insulated from one another 
and the shaft. The commutator turns with the shaft and the armature windings. The com-
mutator is used to change the AC voltage induced in the armature windings to DC voltage at 
the generator output terminals. Carbon brushes pressing against the commutator segments 
connect the current to the external load circuit.
The armature windings generate voltage by cutting a magnetic field as the armature 
rotates. This magnetic field is established by electromagnets mounted around the periphery 
of the generator. The electromagnets, called field poles, are arranged in a definite sequence of 
magnetic polarity; that is, each pole has a magnetic polarity opposite to that of the field poles

adjacent to it. Electrical current for the generator field circuit is usually obtained from the 
generator itself.
When a generator supplies a current to a load, the current passes through the armature 
conductors too. As this current passes through the armature conductors, it creates a magnetic 
field around the armature windings. This magnetic field creates a magnetic influence in the 
rotor—a counter torque—that opposes the direction in which the rotor is being driven. This 
is called the “motor effect” of the generator. Figure 1–3 shows that the magnetic field created 
opposes the driving force. The larger the load current through the generator, the larger the 
counter torque produced. This is the reason that a generator takes more mechanical power to 
drive a heavy current load than a light current load.

Armature Reaction
The armature field flux also reacts against the main field flux and tends to distort it. One result 
of this undesirable condition, known as armature reaction, is excessive sparking at the brushes 
on the commutator. To counteract this effect, commutating poles are often inserted between 
the main field poles, as shown in Figure 1–1. These commutating poles, also called interpoles, 
are energized by windings placed in series with the output (load) circuit of the generator. 
Because of this arrangement, armature reaction, which tends to increase with load current, is 
counteracted by the effects of the load current passing through the interpoles.

Armature reaction, appearing as excessive brush sparking under load, also can be partially 
corrected by shifting the brushes from their neutral position in the direction of rotation.
Large DC generators have the brushes assembled so that they can be shifted to the posi-
tion of minimum sparking. When the brushes are not movable, the generator manufacturer 
inserts other design features to minimize the effects of armature reaction.
Because the magnetic field is distorted by the magnetic action of the armature current in 
the rotating armature, the neutral plane of the motor is shifted, and the brushes are no longer 
at the exact center of the magnetic plane. This reaction to the armature current causes the 
sparking of the brushes. If the load current were always constant, the brushes could be shifted 
in the direction of rotation until the sparking stops. If the load current is constantly chang-
ing, interpole windings are inserted and connected in series with the load to counteract the 
shifted magnetic field and, in effect, bend it back to its original physical position. When the 
DC generator is large enough, interpoles are insufficient to counteract the effects of the shift in 
the neutral plane. Compensating windings are then wound into the pole faces and connected 
in series with the output current to help move the neutral magnetic plane back to the original 
physical location.
Another effect of armature reaction is the reduction of the output voltage. As the magnetic 
field of the rotor (armature) increases because of increased load current, the magnetic field of 
the rotor tends to cancel some of the magnetic field strength of the main field. This canceling 
effect tends to decrease the voltage output of the generator.
Brush Polarity
The output terminals of a generator, as with other DC power units, have electrical polarity. 
In the case of generators, the term brush polarity is used to distinguish between the electrical 
polarity of the brushes, either positive or negative, and the magnetic polarity, either north or 
south, of the field poles.
Brush polarity markings are often omitted, but the electrician can easily determine 
electrical polarity by connecting a voltmeter across the output leads of the generator. Many 
automotive and aircraft generators are constructed with either the positive or negative brushes 
grounded to the frame of the generator. It is very important to maintain the polarity as speci-
fied by the manufacturer. Additional information on brush polarity is given after the effects of 
residual magnetism in the field circuit are considered.
Field Supply
The magnetic field of a generator is established by a set of electromagnets (field poles). 
The current required by the field circuit may be supplied from a separate DC supply. If this is 
the case, the generator is said to have a separately excited field. The majority of generators, how-
ever, are self-excited, and the current for the field is supplied by the generator itself.

OUTPUT VOLTAGE CONTROL
Because the induced voltage into the armature depends on the rate at which the magnetic lines 
of force are cut per second, it is possible to vary the output voltage by controlling either the 
speed of the prime mover or the strength of the magnetic field. In all but a few instances, the 
output voltage is controlled by varying the field current in the field circuit.
The flux density in the magnetic field poles depends on the field current. As a result, the 
field strength and voltage output of the generator continue to increase with an increase of field 
current until magnetic saturation of the field poles occurs. Any additional increase in voltage 
output after this point must be obtained by an increase in speed of the rotating armature.
GENERATOR RATINGS
Generator ratings as specified by the manufacturer shall be found on the nameplate of the 
machine. The manufacturer generally specifies the kilowatt output, current, terminal volt-
age, and speed of the generator. For large generators, the ambient temperature is also given. 
See NEC Article 445.11.
ROTATION
A separately excited generator develops voltage for either direction of rotation. This is not true, 
however, for self-excited units; they develop voltage in one direction only. (See explanation in 
Unit 3.) The standard direction of rotation for DC generators is clockwise when looking at the 
end of the generator opposite the drive shaft (this is usually the commutator end).

REGULATION
The voltage regulation of a generator is one of its important characteristics. Different types of 
generators have different voltage regulation characteristics.
Figure 1–6 shows the action of the voltage at the terminals of a generator for different 
values of the load current. The drop in terminal voltage is caused by the loss in voltage due to 
(1) the internal resistance of the armature circuit, including the brush contacts, and (2) armature 
reaction. The curve at (a) is the normal curve for a shunt generator. An ideal condition is shown 
in (b), where the voltage remains constant with load current. Curve (c) illustrates a generator 
with very poor regulation in that the output voltage drops off considerably as the load current 
increases. A rising characteristic, curve (d), is obtained by using a cumulative compound-wound 
generator (see Unit 4).

SUMMARY
DC generators are used to provide direct current to specific loads. The armature, mounted on 
the rotor, is driven through the magnetic poles developed by the electromagnetic fields. AC 
voltage is actually induced into the armature and then mechanically rectified by the commuta-
tor and brush assembly. Brush polarity is established in a self-excited generator by the magnetic 
polarity of the poles and the direction of rotation. Voltage output is determined by the speed of 
rotation and the strength of the magnetic field.

The separately excited DC generator has few commercial applications, but knowledge of 
its operations is an excellent background for understanding other types of generators.
Using a separate source of DC power, S1 is closed, as in Figure 2–1. As DC current flows 
through the coil of wire wound around the iron core, a magnetic field is produced. The amount 
of field current is controlled by the resistance of the field winding and the variable resistor, 
known as the field rheostat. By adjusting the field current, the strength of the magnetic field is 
controlled. The field flux, or magnetic strength of the magnetic poles, is increased as the field 
current is increased until magnetic saturation occurs. Saturation of the magnetic field means that 
no more magnetic flux can be produced even with an increase in field current. The magnetic 
polarity of the field poles is controlled by the direction of the DC field current and the direction 
of the wound coils.

The output voltage of the generator is developed as an induced voltage in the armature 
conductors. This induced voltage appears at the brushes, and the generator output terminals 
designated as A1 and A2 in Figure 2–1.
To more fully understand the direction of induced voltage, use the left-hand rule for gen-
eration, shown in Figure 6–2 in Unit 6. In this figure, the thumb represents the thrust or the 
direction of the armature movement. The first finger represents the flux direction of the main 
magnetic field, and the center finger represents the current flow resulting in the armature con-
ductors. Note that by changing the direction of rotation or the direction of the main field flux, 
the direction of the resultant current flow is reversed.
The output voltage is directly proportional to the speed of the rotation and the strength 
of the magnetic field. As the speed of the rotor is increased, the output voltage also increases.

There is, however, a limit to the safe operating speed of the rotor before physical damage occurs. 
Likewise, the output voltage can be controlled up to a point by adjusting the field current.
BRUSH POLARITY
When the armature is driven in either direction, an electrical polarity is established at the gen-
erator output terminals and at the brushes. If the machine is stopped and then driven in the 
opposite direction, the field flux is cut in the opposite direction and the brush polarity changes, 
as shown in Figure 2–2(A).

If the direction of rotation is not changed and the field current is reversed, the same effect 
is obtained; that is, if the armature conductors maintain a rotation in one direction and field 
flux is established in the opposite direction, then the brush polarity also changes, as shown in 
Figure 2–2(B).
As a result, the brush polarity in a separately excited generator can be changed by revers-
ing the rotation of the armature or the direction of the field current. However, if both the 
armature direction and the direction of the field current change, the brush polarity remains the 
same (unchanged).
OUTPUT VOLTAGE
The magnitude of the voltage depends on the rate at which the flux is cut. In a separately excited 
generator, an output voltage increase is proportional to an increase in the armature speed. The 
upper limit of the voltage is determined by the permissible mechanical speed and the insulation 
qualities of the armature and the commutator.
The output voltage of a separately excited generator can be varied by adjusting the speed 
of the armature rotation or the field current. A change in speed always results in a corresponding

change in output voltage. An increase in field current increases the output voltage only if the field 
poles are not saturated. Field control of the output voltage is accomplished by varying the total 
resistance of the field circuit with a field rheostat, as shown in Figure 2–1. Increasing the resis-
tance reduces the field current and reduces output voltage. Decreasing the resistance increases 
the output voltage.
RESIDUAL VOLTAGE
If the field circuit is opened at S1 (Figure 2–1) the field current becomes zero. A small amount 
of magnetic flux called residual flux remains, which is caused by residual magnetism left in 
the field poles. The small voltage generated when the armature cuts this flux is called residual 
voltage. Brush polarity remains the same when the field current is zero because the residual 
flux has the same direction as the original flux. If the armature is rotated in the opposite direc-
tion, the same residual voltage is obtained at the same speed, but the brush polarity reverses. 
If the field circuit is closed momentarily with the battery connections reversed, the residual flux 
reverses and the brush polarity reverses.
SUMMARY
Generation of DC voltage depends on three factors: a magnetic field, motion, and conductors. 
Separately excited generators use a separate DC voltage to control the source of field excitation. 
By increasing the field current, field flux can be increased. By controlling the direction of field 
current through the coils, the magnetic polarity is established.
Output voltage level is controlled by the speed of the rotating armature and strength of 
the magnetic field. The polarity of the output voltage is controlled by the direction of rotation 
of the armature and the direction of the magnetic field.

Most DC generators of the shunt type are self-excited. A generator is called a shunt 
generator when its field circuit is connected in parallel with the armature and load. Within the 
field circuit itself, a four-pole winding may be connected in series, parallel, or series-parallel. 
The circuit arrangement of the field windings does not affect the classification of the genera-
tor because the field windings as a group are connected in parallel with the armature and load.
VOLTAGE BUILDUP
Figure 3–1 shows the schematic diagram of a self-excited shunt generator. Voltage control is 
obtained with a field rheostat. Unlike the separately excited generator, there is no current in 
the field circuit when the armature is motionless. Because a small amount of residual magne-
tism is present in the field poles, a weak residual voltage is induced in the armature as soon 
as the armature is rotated. This residual voltage produces a weak current in the field circuit. 
If this current is in the proper direction, an increase in magnetic strength occurs with a corre-
sponding increase in voltage output. The increased voltage output, in turn, increases the field 
current and the field flux, which again increases the voltage output. As a result of this action, 
the output voltage builds up, increasing field current to the field poles. After the poles are 
established, the voltage remains at a constant level unless the speed of the armature rotation 
is changed.

If the direction of armature rotation is reversed at start-up, the brush polarity also is 
reversed. The residual voltage now produces a field current that weakens the residual magne-
tism, and the generator voltage fails to build up. Therefore, a self-excited machine develops its 
operating voltage for one direction of armature rotation only. The load switch for the generator 
may be closed when the desired voltage is reached.

LOSS AND RENEWAL OF RESIDUAL MAGNETISM
A shunt generator may not develop its rated operating voltage if the residual magnetism is lost. 
The residual flux may be renewed by momentarily connecting a low-voltage DC source across 
the field circuit. Several methods can be used to renew the residual magnetism. This process is 
called “flashing the field.”
Method 1
 
1. Disconnect the field circuit leads from the brushes.
 
2. Momentarily connect a storage battery or low-voltage DC source to the field 
circuit leads. To maintain the desired brush polarity, connect the positive terminal 
of the battery to the field lead normally attached to the positive generator brush.
Method 2
 
1. If it is inconvenient to detach the field leads and the brush assembly can be 
reached, lift either the positive or the negative brush and insert a piece of heavy, 
dry paper between the brush and the commutator segments.
 
2. Momentarily connect a battery to the output leads. With the brush lifted, 
current passes through the field circuit only. (To maintain the original brush 
polarity, connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive generator 
output terminal.)
 
3. Remove the paper under the brush before restarting the generator.
Method 3
 
1. If it can be done readily, disconnect the generator from its prime mover.
 
2. Restore the residual field by momentarily connecting a battery to the generator 
output leads. Because the field circuit is connected across the output leads, the 
current renews the magnetic field.
Caution: If the armature is not free to rotate, damage to the armature assembly may 
occur.
When the battery voltage is high enough in Method 3, the generator armature rotates as a 
motor. The rotation produced does not contribute to restoring the residual flux. However, this 
effect, called motorizing, is useful because it is a rough check of the overall generator operation. 
That is, the armature should rotate freely if the voltage applied is a sizable fraction of the rated 
output voltage, with the direction of armature rotation opposite to the proper direction of rota-
tion for a generator. Be sure to use a reduced voltage for large motors.

Brush Polarity
To maintain the original brush polarity when renewing the residual magnetism, the electri-
cal polarities of the output leads and the exciting battery must be matched. In other words, 
the positive terminal of the battery must be connected to the positive output terminal of the 
generator, and the negative battery terminal must be connected to the negative generator 
terminal.
The motorizing test should never be used for restoring residual flux if the generator 
armature is mechanically engaged to the prime mover and cannot rotate freely. A strong current 
through the motionless armature sets up a powerful magnetic field on the armature core. This 
magnetic field may overpower and reverse the main field flux, causing a reversal of the brush 
polarity when the generator is restarted. If there is any doubt as to whether the armature can be 
disconnected completely from the prime mover, it is preferable to isolate and energize the field 
circuit only, either by lifting the brushes or disconnecting the field leads.
CRITICAL FIELD RESISTANCE
A shunt generator may fail to reach its operating voltage even though its residual magnetic field 
is satisfactory. This failure may be due to excessive resistance in the field circuit. Any generator 
has critical field resistance. The presence of resistance in the field circuit in excess of this critical 
value causes the generator to fail to build up to its rated operating voltage.
Because field rheostats are used to control the voltage output at rated speed, it is impor-
tant to reduce the resistance of the field rheostat to a minimum value before investigating other 
possible faults in the event of failure to develop rated voltage. Be sure a complete circuit exists 
from the field through the field resistance.
BRUSH CONTACT RESISTANCE
Contact resistance at the brushes is another reason for the failure of the generator to develop 
its operating voltage. Because the field circuit is completed through the armature, any resistance 
introduced at this point is effectively in the field circuit. Additional pressure applied to the 
brushes may indicate trouble from this source.
Improper connection of the field circuit leads at the brushes is also a cause of failure 
to build up rated voltage. An improper connection can be discovered by reversing these 
leads.
If there is insufficient pressure of the brushes riding on the commutator, the electrical 
connection is poor and the increased resistance causes too low a voltage to be available to the 
main field. Increasing pressure may alleviate such a high-resistance connection. To check for 
proper contact pressure, use a simple resistance test. With the power off, measure the resistance 
from the rotor segment to the associated brush pigtail with normal pressure applied. The read-
ing should be very low ohms. If increasing pressure of the brush to the commutator significantly

reduces the ohm value, then brush pressure may be a problem. Either replace the brushes with 
brushes that are not worn down or increase the spring pressure behind the brush.
ROTATION
When a DC shunt generator is used in special applications, it may be necessary for the arma-
ture to rotate in a direction opposite to that specified by the manufacturer. To develop voltage 
buildup in these instances, the field circuit leads at the brushes must be reversed.
RATINGS
Shunt generators are rated for speed, voltage, and current. Generators used in aircraft and 
automobiles operate through a wide range of speeds but must maintain a constant load voltage. 
Voltage regulators that automatically change field resistance are used.
Generators designed for operation at a constant rated speed must not be operated above 
this value unless the field circuit is protected from the effects of excessive current by current-
limiting devices.
OUTPUT VOLTAGE CONTROL
Field rheostats are used to control the voltage output of shunt generators. At a given speed, the 
rheostat can be used only to bring the output voltage to values below the rated voltage obtain-
able without a field control. Values above the normal rated voltage can be obtained only by 
operating the generator above normal speed.
VOLTAGE REGULATION
The terms voltage regulation and voltage control are often confused. Voltage control refers to 
intentional changes in the terminal voltage made by manual or automatic regulating equipment, 
such as a field rheostat.
Voltage regulation refers to automatic changes in the terminal voltage due to reactions 
within the generator as the load current changes.
Voltage regulation is defined as the percent difference between the voltage output when 
there is no electrical load (E@NL) and the terminal voltage is at full-rated current capacity 
(E@FL). The formula used to determine the percent of voltage regulation follows:
% regulation
=
× 100
E@NL – E@FL
E@FL
For example, it is inherent in the design of a shunt generator for the output voltage to 
fall off as the load increases if there is no change in field resistance. (See Unit 4.) If the drop is 
severe, the generator is said to have poor voltage regulation.

SUMMARY
A self-excited shunt generator has the field coils and the field rheostat shunted across the 
armature connections. If residual magnetism is left in the field iron, then spinning the armature 
will produce residual voltage. This residual voltage is normally enough to begin the generation 
process. If there is not enough residual voltage, then the residual magnetism must be rees-
tablished. Self-excited generators must have the field polarity correctly established and the 
armature spinning in the proper direction to develop output voltage. The output voltage can 
be controlled by adding or removing resistance to the shunt field circuit.

The voltage regulation of a generator is an important factor in deciding the type of load 
to which the generator should be connected. For lighting loads, a constant terminal voltage 
should be maintained when the load current increases. A simple shunt generator can only do 
this if expensive regulating equipment is also used.
Generators designed to maintain a constant voltage within reasonable load limits may 
have a double winding in the field circuit (Figures 4–1 and 4–2). The second winding is wound 
on top of, or adjacent to, the main winding. This second winding is called the series winding to 
distinguish it from the main shunt winding. The series winding has fewer turns than the shunt 
winding. Because the series winding is connected in series with the armature and load, it carries 
the full-load current; therefore, it is heavier gauge wire than the shunt field. A generator with 
such a double-field winding is called a compound-wound generator.

Figures 4–1 and 4–2 show the basic circuits of two ways to connect a compound-wound 
generator: the long shunt and the short shunt. In the short shunt circuit (Figure 4–1), the main 
shunt field is connected directly across the brushes; in the long shunt circuit (Figure 4–2), 
the shunt field is connected across the combination of the armature and the series field. The 
operating characteristics of these circuits are similar, but the short shunt is preferred because 
the shunt field remains more constant and is not affected by changes caused by the series field 
current.

COMPOUND FIELD WINDINGS
Two important details of the compound-wound generator must be considered: (1) the relative 
direction of the currents through both windings of a particular field pole, and (2) the magnetic 
effects that these currents can produce.
The series and shunt windings of a single pole of a compound-wound generator are shown 
in Figure 4–3. Winding (A) is the series winding through which the load current passes; wind-
ing (B) is the normal shunt winding. If the load current is in the direction shown in Figure 4–3, 
the magnetizing force of the series winding (A) will aid the shunt winding (B) and increase the 
strength of the magnetic field because the current in the shunt winding is not normally strong 
enough to saturate the core. If the load current through the series winding is in the direction 
opposite to that shown in Figure 4–3, its effect will be to weaken the magnetic field.
When the series winding is connected to aid the shunt winding, the generator is called a 
cumulative compound-wound generator; if the series winding is connected to oppose the mag-
netic shunt field, it is called a differential compound-wound generator.
The action of two fields in changing the flux density can be used to improve the volt-
age regulation of a normal shunt generator. As stated in Unit 1, as a load is applied in the shunt 
generator, the output voltage falls because of internal resistance, armature reaction, and the 
reduction of voltage applied to the field circuit. If the field strength can be automatically 
increased in proportion to load current as it increases, the output voltage can be maintained at a 
constant level. This is the objective in adding the series winding to the compound generator.

As the load current increases in a cumulative-compound–connected generator, the load 
current passes through the series winding and increases the field flux. The additional voltage 
induced by cutting this flux compensates for the voltage loss due to armature resistance, armature 
reaction, and lower shunt field voltage. By adjusting how much current flows through the series 
winding, the output voltage can be more closely controlled. In fact, the output voltage could rise due 
to the increase in load current passing through the series field, thereby aiding the shunt field flux.
The number of turns in the series field helps determine the degree of compounding 
achieved. A large number of turns in the series winding produces overcompounding (a voltage 
increase at full load as compared to the output voltage at no load). A small number of series 
turns produces a reduced voltage at full load. This effect is called undercompounding.
Flat compound generators have the same voltage output at no load and full load. In indus-
try, this type of generator is used where the distance between the generator and the load is short 
and line resistance is minimal. Overcompounding generators are used when the transmission 
distance is long, as in traction service, and the voltage at the end of the line must remain fairly 
constant.
A comparison of the voltage regulation of a shunt generator and a compound generator 
for both cumulative and differential connections is shown in Figure 4–4.

OUTPUT VOLTAGE CONTROL
The rated voltage of a compound generator operating at rated speed is set by adjusting the field 
rheostat. Because the compounding effect of the series field changes with speed, it is important 
to operate a compound generator at its rated speed.
Variation of Compounding
In general, compound-wound generators are designed by the manufacturer to have an over-
compounding effect. The amount of compounding can be changed to any desired value by 
using a diverter rheostat across the series field. In Figure 4–5, a diverter rheostat (R) is con-
nected in shunt (parallel) with the series winding. If the resistance of the diverter is set at a 
high value, the load current passes through the series winding to produce a maximum com-
pounding effect. If the diverter is set at its minimum value, no load current passes through the 
series winding, and the generator acts like a normal shunt generator. By adjusting the rheostat 
to intermediate values, any degree of compounding within these limits can be obtained. Flat 
compounding results when “no-load” voltage is equal to “full-load” voltage.

SUMMARY
Compound-wound generators use a series field connected in series with the load to react to 
current load changes. It is connected to aid the shunt field or to oppose the shunt field. In most 
DC generators, the series field is connected so that the magnetic field produced aids the shunt 
field flux. This connection is called a cumulative connection. The degree of compounding can 
be controlled by a diverter rheostat. If the series field is connected so that the resultant flux 
opposes the shunt field flux, then the output voltage drops dramatically with an increase in 
current draw, and the generator is differentially connected.

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF AC GENERATION
Some basic principles are used in the generation of AC (alternating current) voltage. The 
major source of electrical power is provided by electromagnetic generation. This method uses 
the principle of moving a magnetic field past an electrical conductor, which induces a voltage 
in the conductor and creates a resultant current flow to an electrical load. For electromagnetic 
induction-type generators, the following three factors are needed for induction:
• The presence of a magnetic field
• An available electrical conductor
• Relative motion between the conductor and the magnetic field
In Figure 6–1, the magnetic field is moved past the stationary conductor. As the mag-
netic field moves past the conductor, the magnetic lines of force, called flux, pass through the 
conductor or cut the conductor. The equation associated with Faraday’s law states that if 
10 million lines of magnetic flux cut through a conductor in 1 second, then 1 volt is induced into 
the conductor. Assuming the electron flow theory is used (where electron current flow moves 
from negative to positive), then the left-hand rule for generators is used, as shown in Figure 6–2. 
The resultant current flow to the electrical load is toward you. If the direction of motion is 
reversed, the resultant direction of electron flow is reversed. Likewise, if the magnetic field 
is reversed and the direction of motion is constant, then the resultant electron flow is reversed.

magnetic fields and in different directions. As the conductor passes directly under the center 
of the magnetic field pole, the flux is the most dense and the induced voltage is greatest. This 
condition creates the most induced EMF (electromotive force) and produces the peak of the 
AC waveform. As the conductor moves parallel to the lines of flux, no cutting action takes place 
and no voltage is induced. This represents the zero voltage point of the AC waveform. If you 
multiply the sine of the angle that the conductor moves from the horizontal starting point (0°) 
times the maximum induced voltage in the conductor, you can plot a graph of each induced 
voltage level at each angular position. The graph is a sinewave representation of the induced 
voltage representing the induced AC voltage (see Figure 6–3).

of the waveform are produced. This is called 60 cycles per second or 60 hertz (Hz). Revolution 
of the conductor is 60 revolutions per second, or 3600 revolutions per minute.
Stationary Armature
Another method is most often used to generate a sinewave. This method spins a magnetic 
field inside a looped conductor. The looped conductor multiplies the effects of the magnetic 
field cutting just one conductor. Figure 6–4 illustrates a method of generation referred to as a 
stationary-armature, rotating-field type generator. In this case, the magnetic field moves past 
the conductors, cutting through them and inducing a voltage into the stationary conductors. 
The waveform on the conductors is still the same AC sinewave because the magnetic field is 
moving past the conductors with varied strength in relative positions.

When a generator is used to produce a single sinewave output, it is referred to as a single-
phase generator. It is only designed to produce a single sinewave of AC output voltage.
Frequency is a term used to describe how often or how frequently a complete AC wave-
form is produced. The frequency of a generator that produces 60 complete sinewave cycles in 
1 second is 60 Hz. The formula used to determine the frequency of the generated waveform is
=
Frequency
120
RPM × number of poles
Frequency is measured in hertz, or cycles per second.
RPM is the speed of the rotating member, either the conductor or the magnetic field.
Number of poles is the number of magnetic poles of the magnetic field (in this example, 
two poles).
The number 120 is a constant used to convert RPM to revolutions per second, and pairs 
of magnetic poles to number of poles used in the formula.

Single-Phase Generator Maintenance
Maintaining single-phase generators is relatively simple from the electrical standpoint. 
Most of the problems that occur are from the prime mover, or the engine input, that 
drives the generator. The maintenance of the generator itself depends on the actual style 
of generator. The generator is either a stationary field or a stationary armature. The points 
to remember on the generation side are (1) a magnetic field must be present; (2) motion 
between the field and the conductors of the armature must exist; and (3) the output 
electrical power must be connected to the load. Therefore, these three factors should be 
checked if the generator does not have correct output. (See more details on three-phase 
generators in Unit 11.)
Single-Phase and Three-Phase Generation
Single-phase power systems are used extensively, but large power generation systems typi-
cally generate three phases at a time. This is used to supply three distinct sinewaves to a 
power system. (See Unit 7.) The three waveforms or three phases can be used to supply 
three-phase motors, or the power needs can be split up to provide three separate single-
phase systems.
SUMMARY
The main method of generation is through electromagnetic induction. Either a magnetic field 
is moved past the stationary conductor, or the conductor is moved through the magnetic field. 
As the density of the magnetic flux is greater at the center of the magnetic field, there is more 
induced EMF, and a peak value of voltage is produced. As the relative direction of motion 
between the conductor and the magnetic field changes, the direction of the induced EMF 
changes. The number of complete sinewaves produced in a generator per second is referred to 
as the frequency and is measured in hertz (Hz).

Almost all power transmission uses the three-phase system. In the three-phase system, 
electrical energy originates from an alternator that has three main windings placed 120° apart. 
A minimum of three wires is used to transmit the energy generated.
A polyphase system, therefore, is the proper combination of two or more single-phase 
systems. In their order of usage, the most common types of polyphase systems follow:
• three phase (used for power transmission)
• six phase (used for power rectification)
• two phase (used for power rectification)

shows a three-phase generator in a utility power-generating station.

The advantages of three-phase systems apply to both the generation and transmission of elec-
trical energy.

cycle for a one-cylinder engine. Similarly, a three-phase generator induces voltage in three 
windings per turn, rather than in just the one winding of a single-phase generator. In addi-
tion, the generator actually is smaller in physical dimensions than a single-phase generator 
of the same rating. Three-phase generation produces energy more smoothly than single-
phase generation and provides for more economical use of space within the frame of the 
machine.
GENERATION OF THREE-PHASE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Figure 7–3 shows the arrangement of the windings in a simple three-phase AC generator. The 
coils are spaced 120 electrical degrees apart. The voltage diagram shows the relationship of the 
instantaneous voltages as the rotating field poles turn in the direction indicated.
Three-Phase Winding Connections
The internal winding connections shown in Figure 7–4 for a three-phase generator are arranged 
so that any of three or four wires may be brought out. That is, three-phase windings may 
be connected either in the star (wye) pattern (Figure 7–5), or the delta pattern (Figure 7–6).

SIX-PHASE CONNECTIONS
Six-phase power is usually applied to power rectifiers. The AC six-phase supply is converted 
from a three-phase power line by a bank of three transformers connected for six-phase on 
the secondary side of the line transformer. The double-wye, six-phase connection shown in 
Figure 7–7 is one method of obtaining six-phase power. The lines are brought out at the outer 
ends of the windings. The points (1-2-3-4-5-6) are displaced 60 electrical degrees apart from 
one another.

Transmission Using Transformers
Three-phase transmission saves material, installation time, and maintenance costs. A three-
phase, 4-wire wye system can provide three 120-volt lighting circuit lines, three 208-volt single-
phase circuits, and one 208-volt, 3-phase power line over four wires.
MEASUREMENT OF THREE-PHASE POWER
Three-phase power may be measured using either the two-wattmeter method or a polyphase 
wattmeter.
Two-Wattmeter Method (Using Blondel’s Theorem)
Blondel’s theorem paraphrased states: that a power system of N conductors can be measured 
by N-1 watt measuring elements. A three wire three-phase system would need two wattmeter 
measurement elements. The reversing switches of both wattmeters must be set in the same 
direction. If one meter shows a negative reading, reverse the corresponding switch so that a 
positive reading is seen on the scale. If the switches are set in opposite directions, the lower 
reading is assumed to be negative.
If the power factor (PF) is 100%, W1 = W2, then WT = W1 + W2.
If the PF is greater than 50% and less than 100%, then W1 and W2 are unequal. WT = 
W1 + W2. (WT = Total power.)
If the PF is 50%, one meter reads 0 and WT = W − 0.
If the PF is less than 50%, one meter has a negative reading and WT = W1 − W2.
Note: The two-wattmeter method cannot be used in an unbalanced three-phase, four-
wire system. See Figure 7–9 for the two-wattmeter connection. There is a method for measur-
ing single-phase, 3-wire power system using a single element. A single meter can be used to 
measure the three-wire system if the voltage is balanced between each hot and the neutral. This 
is referred to as the 2S meter.

Polyphase Wattmeter Method
The connections of a polyphase wattmeter used to measure three-phase power are shown in 
Figure 7–10. In the polyphase wattmeter, the torque produced by two current coils and two volt-
age coils causes the pointer to deflect and indicate total watts in the circuit in one instrument.

Three-phase equipment is designed to operate as a balanced load. A three-phase circuit 
containing a combination of single- and three-phase loads is very seldom balanced. A polyphase 
wattmeter must be used for the measurement of power in an unbalanced circuit. See Figure 7–11

tive), VA (volt-amperes), and so forth.

SUMMARY
Polyphase refers to any electrical system that has more than one waveform present. Typically, 
three sinewaves are produced by commercial generation equipment. These three sinewaves are 
separated by 120 electrical degrees. The generator coils may be connected either in the wye 
pattern or the delta pattern. Other connections such as the six-phase and the two-phase are also 
possible. Measurement of three-phase power can be accomplished by using a two-wattmeter 
method and the appropriate formulas, or by using the correctly connected polyphase wattmeter.

The star, or wye, connection is particularly suited for the distribution of power and light-
ing where one three-phase transmission line supplies the energy. All three transformers in the 
wye bank can supply single-phase loads as well as a three-phase load. The wye system also pro-
vides a grounded neutral with equal voltage between each phase wire and the neutral.
The two standard voltage patterns available from the four-wire wye system in the United 
States are 120/208 and 277/480. The 120/208-volt wye system is most commonly used for 
small industrial plants, office buildings, stores, and small school buildings. In these applications, 
the main electrical need is for 120-volt lighting and equipment circuits, and only a moderate 
amount of 208-volt three-phase power load. The 277/480-volt wye system is mainly used for 
large commercial buildings and industrial plants where there is a higher demand for power at 
480 volts, three phase, and lighting at 277 volts, single phase.
The types of three-phase systems are named for the diagram shape of the transformer 
secondary winding connections. The wye, or star, system, as shown in Figure 8–1, is shaped 
like the letter Y. The wye, or star, connections are made by tying together the ends of the 
three transformer windings, labeled X2, and bringing this termination out as the neutral wire. 
The remaining three unidentified conductors of the four-wire, three-phase system, labeled on 
the figure as A, B, C, are tied to the three X1 ends, respectively. Alternators are connected in the 
same manner as shown in Figure 8–2.
VOLTAGE RELATIONS
The voltage reading across any pair of line wires of a balanced three-phase wye connection is 
equal to the vector sum of the two-phase windings connected in series across the pair of lines.
For example, if the phase winding voltage is 120 volts, the line voltage is 208 volts.
ELine = 1.73 × 120 = 208 V

The voltage from any line to a grounded neutral is the phase winding voltage and is usu-
ally called the phase voltage. Phase is represented by the Greek letter phi (ϕ).
Figure 8–1 illustrates the relationship between the voltage in a wye or star system. 
The line-to-line voltage is the vector sum of the individual coil voltages. The coil voltage is 
the voltage generated by an individual phase coil, either in a generator or a coil winding in a 
 transformer. By connecting them into a wye pattern, the voltages add vectorially. Because the 
sinewaves are 120° apart in each phase, the two phases are not added arithmetically. Figure 8–1 
shows the vector addition of two 120-volt phase voltages added together to get a resultant line 
voltage of 207.8, or a nominal 208 volts line to line. The same relation exists in other wye con-
nections. Phase voltage multiplied by the constant 1.73 yields the line voltage. In a 277/480-
volt wye system, the same relation exists. The phase voltage, 277 volts, multiplied by 1.73 yields 
the line voltage of 480 volts nominal.
Another common factor is used when working with three-phase voltages. When convert-
ing from line voltage to phase voltage, divide the line voltage by 1.73 to get the phase voltage. 
For example, 480 volts line to line divided by 1.73 yields 277 volts nominal. Another common 
factor is the inverse of 1.73 (0.58), which allows the electrician to multiply the line-to-line volt-
age by 0.58 to obtain phase voltage. It is an easier factor to use for approximating the phase 
values in a quick calculation.

CURRENT RELATIONS
The line current is the same as the phase current in a wye connection because each phase wind-
ing is connected in series with its corresponding line wire (Figure 8–2). Remember that current 
in a series circuit is the same throughout all parts of the circuit.
ILine (IL) = IPhase (Iϕ)
To calculate the current in the common conductor of a three-phase, four-wire wye system, 
we must examine how the currents combine from all three-phase wires. To analyze a balanced 
condition, consider that the common conductor carries the imbalance of the three-phase, or hot, 
conductors. If the three phases are equal, as in supplying a three-phase motor, the neutral current 
is the imbalance of the three-phase conductors. In this case, there is no imbalance and the neutral 
current is zero. The formula used to find the neutral current in a three-phase wye system is
I neutral = wA2 + B2 + C2 − AB − AC − BC
You can quickly tell what the neutral current is if all the phase currents are equal. For 
instance, if they are all 10 A, then
I neutral = w102 + 102 + 102 − 100 − 100 − 100 = 0 amps
To find the neutral current in a three-phase system when the phases are not equal, we use 
the same formula and perform a calculation. If the phase currents are different, such as A phase 
is 5 A, B phase is 10 A, and C phase is 12 A, then the formula is
I neutral = w52 + 102 + 122 − 50 − 60 − 120 = 6.25 A
Another combination may exist when dealing with three-phase power and single-phase 
devices. If you use two of the three phases of a four-wire wye and the neutral to operate a single-
phase load, then the same formula is used to find the actual current in the neutral. This situation 
is not the same as a single-phase power source with two hots and a neutral conductor. In the 
single-phase situation, the neutral carries only the imbalance of the two hots. In the three-phase 
wye situation, the neutral formula must be used. For instance, if two hot conductors of a three-
phase system each provide 10 A, then the neutral formula is
I neutral = w102 + 102 + 02 − 100 − 0 − 0 = 10 A
The neutral carries the same as the hot conductors. If the hots carry different values, the 
formula must be used to calculate the neutral current.

POWER RELATIONS
The power formula used for three-phase, wye-connected systems is the same as that used 
for the delta-connected system. The relationship of the current and voltage is taken into 
account. The three-phase apparent power for a three-phase system can be calculated by find-
ing the individual-phase apparent power and multiplying by 3 for the power of a balanced 
three-phase system. Phase current × phase voltage × 3 yields the three-phase apparent power 
measured in volt-amps. When using the line voltage values to find three-phase power, the 
phase voltage has already been increased by a factor of 1.73 to get the line voltage. Another 
multiplying factor of 1.73 must be used to equal the same product found when using the 
three single phases in the power calculations. Therefore, the formula for three-phase appar-
ent power is line voltage × line current × 1.73, which yields the same apparent power answer 
as previously calculated.
3-phase apparent power: line voltage × line current × 1.73 = 3-phase volt-amps
To calculate three-phase true power, which is measured in watts, the power factor of the 
AC system must be known. As discussed previously, the power factor is a factor multiplier to 
the apparent power of an AC system that yields the true power in watts. As a reminder, power 
factor is the cosine of the phase angle that is established between the voltage and the current 
in an AC system that is not totally resistive in nature. To find the true power of a three-phase 
power system, the additional power factor is used as follows:
3-phase true power: line voltage × line current × 1.73 × power factor = 3-phase watt s
APPLICATION
Typical applications of three-phase, wye-connected systems use voltage ratings of 120/208, 
where the 120 designates the single-phase voltage, line to neutral, and the 208 volts designates 
the line-to-line voltage. The 208-volt, three-phase voltage is used in commercial applications 
for three-phase motors. Another common voltage in the United States is 277/480-volt systems. 
The 277-volt designation is the single-phase line to neutral and is used extensively for commer-
cial lighting applications. The 480-volt value is the line-to-line voltage and is used extensively 
as three-phase commercial power to buildings.
A four-wire transmission line usually originates from a transformer bank or a generator 
connected in wye. Both lighting and power circuits are connected to the four-wire system. Four 
circuits are served by four wires.

WYE CONNECTION OF TRANSFORMER WINDINGS
A bank of three transformers can be connected in wye, delta, or other 3-, 6-, 12-, or 18-phase 
arrangements. Figure 8–3 shows a conventional method of connecting three transformers in 
a three-phase wye arrangement. Compare this with Figure 8–2. (Note that X2 of each coil is

SUMMARY
One method of connecting three-phase coils is to connect them into a pattern that sche-
matically resembles the letter Y. This pattern of connection is referred to as the wye or the star 
connection. In the wye connection, the waveforms are 120° apart and there are three distinct

sinewaves. The resultant voltage, obtained by connecting these single phases together, is to 
increase the line-to-line voltage by a factor of 1.73. In this pattern, the line voltage is 1.73 times 
the phase voltage, but the line current is the same as the phase current. Three-phase volt-amp 
capacity is calculated as follows:
Line E × Line I × 1.73

The delta connection, like the wye connection, is used to connect alternators, motors, and 
transformers. Delta is a Greek letter, which is shaped like a triangle (Δ). The delta connection 
takes its name from this symbol because of its triangular appearance. The schematic diagram 
of the winding connection of an alternator or secondary transformer bank shows the windings 
that are actually spaced 120 electrical degrees apart (Figure 9–1).

To make a delta connection, connect the beginning of one phase to the end of the next phase 
until the last and final connection is to be closed. Do not complete the delta connection until the 
voltage is measured across the last two ends (see C2−A1 in Figure 9–2).

Test for Completion of the Delta Connection
If the voltmeter reads zero across C2−A1, the circuit may be closed (Figure 9–2). If the 
voltmeter reads twice the voltage of the phase winding, reverse any phase and retest. If a 
potential remains across C2−A1, reverse a second phase and make a final voltage test before 
completing the delta connection. The phase windings must have potentials 120 electrical 
degrees apart.
VOLTAGE RELATIONS
The voltage measured across any pair of line wires of a balanced three-phase delta connection 
is equal to the voltage measured across the phase winding (see Figure 9–1).
ELine = EPhase
CURRENT RELATIONS
Trace any line, such as line A in Figure 9–1, back to the connection point of phases C and A in 
a closed delta. The current in line A is supplied by phases A and C at the point of connection in 
the AC generator. Phases A and C are out of phase by 120°. The line current, therefore, is the 
vector addition of the two phase currents. In a balanced circuit, the phase currents are equal. 
The line current is determined by the following formula:
ILine = w3 × IPhase or 1.73 × IPhase
For example, if the phase current in each winding of a generator or transformer is 
10 amperes, the line current is equal to 1.73 × 10 = 17.3 amperes.
ILine = 1.73 × 10 = 17.3 amperes
In a four-wire delta connection, the neutral currents are calculated differently than in a 
wye system. Because the neutral is positioned as a midpoint of a one-phase winding, the current 
in the neutral is calculated the same way as the current in a single-phase system where there 
are two hot conductors and the neutral carries the imbalanced current. For instance, if the two-
phase conductors on either side of the neutral are equal currents of single-phase load values, the 
neutral current is zero. The formula is
|A phase − C phase|single phase condition = Neutral current

● Example:  If the A phase is 20 A and the C phase is 15 A, then the neutral is 5 A. If using 
all three phases in the delta, subtract the balanced three-phase currents from 
the values for the A and C phases. The neutral connection current is still the 
imbalance between the remaining currents in the A phase and C phase.
● Example:  If there is single-phase and three-phase load on a delta four-wire system, and 
phase A has 30 A, phase B has 10 A, and phase C has 16 A, we could assume 
the three-phase load is 10 A. Then subtract the 10 amps of three-phase current 
from all phase values to yield A − 20 A, B − 0 A, and C − 6 A. The formula for 
the neutral current is:
|A phase − C phase|single phase condition = Neutral current
Therefore, |20 − 6|single phase condition = 14 A of neutral current.
APPLICATION
The delta connection may be used as the source of a three-wire transmission line or distribu-
tion system. The three-wire delta system is used when three-phase power on three conductors 
is required.
In summary, the following statements are true of the three-phase delta connection:
ELine = EPhase
ILine = 1.73 × IPhase
DELTA CONNECTION OF TRANSFORMERS
Figure 9–3 shows the delta secondary connection of a bank of transformers.
FOUR-WIRE DELTA CONNECTION
A transformer secondary can also be connected as a four-wire delta secondary. In this pattern 
(see Figure 9–4), one of the transformer secondary windings has a connection point brought 
out, creating a fourth wire connection. This point is at the midpoint of the winding and is 
referred to as the center tap. This yields a voltage that is half of the single-phase voltage. The 
connection point to the center tap is normally grounded. This connection is typically on the 
B phase, so the voltage from line leads A or C to the center tap is half the full transformer sec-
ondary. The voltage to the line wire B is actually 1.73 × the center-tapped voltage. As a typical 
application, the transformer secondary might be a 240-volt, three-phase delta  connection,

which means 240-volt phase to phase. From line wire A to B to C, the voltage you would mea-
sure would be 240 volts. From A or C to the grounded center tap would measure 120 volts, and 
the voltage from B to the grounded center tap would be 208 volts. This is officially known as 
“the phase with the higher voltage to ground.” See Unit 20 for connections and applications.
SUMMARY
A common method of connection for coils of a three-phase system is the delta connection. This 
connection pattern gets its name from the way the schematic representation of the connection 
represents the Greek letter delta (Δ). In this pattern, the three-phase coils are connected so that 
the line voltage is the same as the coil or phase voltage. However, the line current is the vector 
sum of the coil currents and is determined by multiplying the phase current by 1.73. The three-
phase volt-amp capacity of the delta-connected, three-phase system is calculated as follows:
Line E × Line I × 1.73

An alternator is a machine designed to generate alternating current (AC). This machine 
is the major electrical unit in power plants.
The alternator converts the mechanical energy of a prime mover, such as a diesel engine, 
steam turbine, or water turbine, to electrical energy. Another prime mover that has become 
increasingly important in the generation of electricity is the power of wind (see Unit 15).
THREE-PHASE VOLTAGES
Three phase is the most common polyphase electrical system. Poly means more than one. It is, 
in this instance, a system having three distinct voltages that are out of step with one another. 
There are 120 electrical degrees between each voltage sine waveform. Figure 11–1 shows sin-
ewave relationships taken on an electrical oscillograph instrument trace. This display shows the 
voltage relationships of the three-phases, 120 electrical degrees apart. This can be taken at any 
point in a three-phase system. The three phases are generated by placing each phase coil in the 
alternator 120° apart, mechanically. A rotating DC magnetic field then cuts each phase coil in 
succession, inducing a voltage in each armature coil. Armatures are the electrical components 
of the AC generator that have voltage induced into them. Armatures may be either the rotating 
piece of the alternator or the stationary component of the alternator. These armature coils may 
be connected internally or externally in a delta or a wye (star) connection. Rotating fields are 
more commonly used than stationary fields because generating large amounts of current would 
require larger sizes of conductors and iron to rotate. Therefore, it is more practical to make the 
armature stationary and rotate the magnetic field.

ALTERNATOR TYPES
Two principal types of synchronous alternators are (1) the rotating-armature alternator and 
(2) the rotating-field alternator.
Figure 11–3 illustrates an alternator with a stationary field, a revolving armature, and the 
elementary wiring symbol for a three-phase alternator. The armature consists of the windings 
into which current is induced. The magnetic field for this type of alternator is established by 
a set of stationary field poles mounted on the periphery of the alternator frame. The field flux 
created by these poles is cut by conductors inserted in slots on the surface of the rotating arma-
ture. The armature conductors are arranged in a circuit that terminates in slip rings. Alternating 
current induced in the armature circuit is fed to the load circuit by carbon brushes that make 
contact with the slip rings.
The rotating-armature alternator generally is used for low-power installations. The fact 
that the load current must be conducted from the machine through a sliding contact at the slip 
rings poses many design problems at higher values of load current and voltage. One alternator 
design has semiconductor rectifier diodes installed on the exciter field, thus eliminating the

brushes and slip rings for the revolving field alternator (see the section called “Brushless Exciters 
with Solid-State Voltage Control”).
ROTATING-FIELD ALTERNATORS
Rotating-field alternators are used extensively because of the ease with which a high-voltage 
or high-current load can be connected to the alternator. The load connections do not need 
to draw power from the armature through brushes riding on slip rings. In this alternator, 
the output power is taken from the stationary armature through solid electrical connections. 
The armature is the stationary component of the generator, and the DC field is connected to 
the rotating field. The field windings in large generators are typically smaller than the armature 
windings. Therefore, the field has less mass and weight to rotate and can be supplied with a 
relatively small amount of DC to generate a relatively large amount of AC in the armature.
FIELD EXCITATION
DC must be used in the electromagnetic field circuit of an alternator. As a result, all types of 
alternators must be supplied with field current from a DC source, except for small perma-
nent magnet fields. The DC source may be a DC generator operated on the same shaft as 
the alternator. In this case, the DC generator is called an exciter, shown on the self-excited 
synchronous alternator in Figure 11–4(A). The circuit diagram for this alternator is shown in 
Figure 11–4(B). In installations where a number of alternators require excitation power, this 
power is supplied by a DC generator driven by a separate prime mover. The output terminals of 
this generator connect to a DC exciter bus from which other alternators receive their excitation 
power by means of brushes and slip rings for the rotating-field type of alternator.

FIELD DISCHARGE CIRCUIT
A field discharge switch is used in the excitation circuit of an alternator. This switch eliminates 
the potential danger to personnel and equipment resulting from the high inductive voltage cre-
ated when the DC field circuit is opened.
Figure 11–5 illustrates the connections for the field circuit of a separately excited alter-
nator. With the discharge switch closed, the field circuit is energized, and the field discharge 
switch functions as a normal double-pole, single-throw switch.
FIGURE 11–5 Field discharge switch.
© Cengage Learning 2014
The discharge switch shown in Figure 11–5 has an auxiliary switch blade at A in addition 
to the normal blades at C and D (Figure 11–5).
When you want to open the field circuit, the following actions must take place.
• Before the main switch contacts open, switch blade A meets contact B and thus provides 
a second path for the current through the field discharge resistor.
• When the main switch contacts C-D open (shown in Figure 11–6), high inductive volt-
age is created in the field coils by the collapsing magnetic field.
• The high voltage is dissipated by sending a current through the field discharge resistor.

This procedure eliminates the possibility of damage to the insulation of the field windings 
as well as danger to anyone opening the circuit using a standard double-pole switch. A field 
discharge circuit is used with all types of separately excited alternators.
FREQUENCY
The frequency of an alternator is a direct function of (a) the speed of rotation of the armature 
or the field and (b) the number of poles in the field circuit. The frequency commonly used 
in the United States is 60 cycles per second, or 60 Hz. Power companies are particularly con-
cerned with maintaining a constant frequency for their energy output because many devices 
depend on a constant value of frequency. This constant value is achieved by sensitive control 
of the prime mover speed, driving the alternator.
If the number of field poles in a given alternator is known, then it is possible to determine 
the speed required to produce a desired frequency. One cycle of voltage is generated each 
time an armature conductor passes across two field poles of opposite magnetic polarity. The 
frequency in cycles per second, or hertz, is the number of pairs of poles passed by the conduc-
tor in a second. Because the speed of rotating machinery is given in revolutions per minute 
(r/min), the speed in revolutions per second is obtained by dividing the speed (r/min) by 60. 
In a two-pole alternator the frequency is

frequency can be obtained:

If a two-pole alternator is to be operated at a frequency of 60 Hz, the correct speed is 
obtained from the formula RPM = (120 × f)/p:
The two preceding examples illustrate the previous statement that the frequency of an 
alternator is a direct function of the speed of rotation and the number of poles in the alternator 
field circuit.
VOLTAGE CONTROL
The voltage output of an alternator increases as the speed of rotation accelerates, thus increas-
ing the lines of force cut per second. If the field excitation increases, the magnetic fields are 
increased to the point of magnetic saturation of the field poles. Increasing the magnetic field 
strength increases output voltage.
For practical purposes, an alternator must be operated at a constant speed to maintain a 
fixed frequency. Thus, the only feasible method of controlling the voltage output is to vary the 
field excitation.
Field controls are used to vary the resistance of the total field circuit. This variation of 
resistance, in turn, changes the value of field current [Figure 11–4(B)].
• A low value of field current results in less flux and less induced voltage at a given speed.
• A high field current results in greater field flux and a higher induced voltage at a given speed.
• The value of flux at which the field poles saturate determines the maximum voltage 
obtainable at a fixed speed and frequency.
STATOR WINDINGS
Figure 11–7 illustrates the stator (stationary or nonmoving) windings of a rotating-field, three-
phase alternator. The three-phase armature windings are embedded 120° from one another 
in the slots of a laminated steel core that is clamped securely to the alternator frame. Output 
leads from the stator emerge from the bottom of the stator and connect directly to the load 
circuit. Slip rings and brushes are not required in a stationary winding of this type. As a result, 
higher values of output voltage and current are possible. Standard values of voltage output for 
a rotating-field alternator are as high as 13,800 volts.

ROTATING FIELD
The rotating portion of a rotating-field alternator consists of field poles mounted on a shaft 
that is driven by the prime mover. The magnetic flux established by the rotating field poles cuts 
across the conductors of the stator winding to produce the induced output voltage of the stator.
The following comparison can be made between the rotating-armature alternator and 
the rotating-field alternator. In the rotating-armature alternator, the armature conductors cut 
the flux established by stationary field poles. For the rotating-field alternator, the motionless 
conductors of the stator winding are cut by the flux established by rotating field poles. In each 
case, an induced voltage is generated.

a spider. Each of the field poles is bolted to the spider. The field poles may be dovetailed to

the spider in some alternators to provide a better support for the poles against the effects of 
centrifugal force.
Figure 11–9 shows a nonsalient rotor. This type of rotor has a smooth cylindrical surface. 
The field poles (usually two or four) do not protrude above this smooth surface. Nonsalient 
rotors are used to decrease windage losses on high-speed alternators, improve balance, and 
reduce noise.

FIGURE 11–9 Alternator rotor, nonsalient-field type.
Power Supply for Rotor
The field windings of both salient and nonsalient rotors require DC power. Slip rings and 
brushes are used to feed the current to the windings at a potential of 100 to 250 volts DC. 
The brushes and rings are easily maintained because of the low values of field current 
encountered.
TERMINAL MARKINGS
A standard system of marking leads for field circuits has been established by ANSI (American 
National Standards Institute). The field leads for both alternators and generators are indicated 
by the markings F1 and F2. In addition, the F1 lead always connects to the positive bus of the 
DC source. (See Figures 11–5 and 11–6.)
ALTERNATOR REGULATION
Regardless of the type of generator or alternator used in a system, the terminal output voltage 
of the machine varies with any change in the load current. The impedance of the windings and 
the power factor of the load circuit both influence the regulation of an alternator. An increase in 
load current in a pure resistive load circuit causes a decrease in output voltage. A voltage drop of 
approximately 10% is common when going from a condition of no load to full load in a typical 
alternator without voltage regulation controls.

U N I T  1 1   T H R E E - P H A S E  A LT E R N AT O R S
For an inductive load, an increase in load current causes a greater voltage drop than is 
obtained with a pure resistive load. A load with a low value of lagging power factor produces a 
large drop in output voltage.
A capacitive load circuit produces the opposite effect. In other words, the output voltage 
rises above the no-load value with an increase in load current and is high at a low value of lead-
ing power factor.
AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE CONTROL
Unlike DC generators, alternators cannot be compounded to alter the voltage-load charac-
teristic. Moreover, output voltage variations are more likely to be severe because of changes 
in the load power factor. As a result, automatic voltage regulators generally are used with 
alternators.
Automatic voltage regulators change the alternator field current to compensate for 
any increase or decrease in the load voltage. A controller is used to increase or decrease the 
field current through the field circuit. As the AC line voltage falls, the field controller causes 
an increase in the flux and thus increases the induced voltage. An increase in the AC line 
voltage causes the controller to decrease the field current, flux, and induced voltage. Power 
companies stabilize line voltage by using a type of varying ratio transformer as a voltage 
regulator.
BRUSHLESS EXCITERS WITH SOLID-STATE VOLTAGE 
CONTROL
The permanent magnet generator (Figure 11–10) supplies high-frequency AC power input 
to the voltage regulator. Voltage and reactive current feedback information is provided to 
the regulator from potential and current transformers. Using these feedback signals and a 
reference point established by setting the voltage adjusting rheostat, the voltage regulator 
(which has a transfer switch allowing the operator to select automatic regulator control or 
manual control) provides a controlled DC output. The DC is fed to the field of the rotating 
exciter; the three-phase, high-frequency AC output is then rectified by a full-wave bridge. 
This rectified signal is applied to the main generator field. Fully rated, parallel, solid-state 
diodes with indicating fuses are provided to permit full-load generation with a diode (recti-
fier) out of service. The use of a stroboscope light permits the indicating fuses to be viewed 
during operation to determine whether a diode has failed. Figure 11–11 shows a cutaway 
view of a brushless exciter. Figure 11–12 shows the rotating components of a brushless 
excitation system.

GENERATOR TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
Test the insulation resistance of the generator at initial start-up and periodically track the insu-
lation values.
Procedure for Testing Insulation Resistance
Disconnect all related components that have circuits connected to the generator windings. 
This includes the automatic voltage regulator and any diodes on the rotor. If the generator 
has resistive temperature detectors (RTDs), disconnect or isolate them from the wind-
ings circuit. Use a megohmmeter to measure the resistance of the winding insulation. The 
measurements are made from winding to winding to make sure there is no electrical path

between the coil windings. Also, the measurements are taken from the coils to the grounded 
frame to check for insulation breakdown. The resistance of the insulation varies over time 
and may change if the windings are damp or in high humidity. However, the ratings should 
stay above 1.0 megohms to be considered sufficient insulation. An original reading of 100 
megohms is typical when the machine is manufactured at the factory. If the generator arrives 
and the first readings are less than 1.0 megohm, the generator may have been damaged in 
shipment or the winding may be wet.
One method to dry the winding is to run the generator unloaded and with no field excita-
tion. Run the generator for 30 minutes to allow the heat and ventilation of a running generator 
to dry the windings. Another method used to dry the windings and raise the insulation resis-
tance (IR) is to open all venting covers and blow warm air over the damp windings. Be careful 
not to overheat the windings and actually burn the insulation. Continue checking the IR value 
as the windings dry out.
A third, more risky process is to actually have the generator generate a small voltage 
and current. This should be done only if other methods are not suitable. The process is to 
short the output terminals though a shorting conductor, large enough to handle the full-load 
current output of the generator. Disconnect the normal DC excitation leads and connect a 
separate DC source of adjustable low current at 24 VDC. Start the generator and then apply 
a very small excitation current. Very carefully increase the small excitation until the current 
being monitored at the output is at approximately 80% of the full-load current rating of the 
generator. A drying out curve as in Figure 11–13 should result if you take readings of the IR 
every 30 minutes.

SUMMARY
Three-phase alternators are similar to single-phase alternators in that they can generate electri-
cal power through electromagnetic means. The rotating-field alternator is most common in 
large generating facilities. In electromechanical generation, a magnetic field is turned inside the 
housing that holds the circuit conductors. The speed of the rotating field is determined by the 
desired output frequency. The output voltage of a single generator is controlled by the strength 
of the spinning electromagnet. By adjusting the amount of DC supplied to the spinning electro-
magnetic field, the level of AC output voltage can be controlled. Some generation systems do not 
connect DC power to the rotor using brushes and slip rings; instead, they use a system called a 
brushless exciter that supplies DC to the rotor through electromagnetic induction and rectifiers.

ENGINE-DRIVEN GENERATING SETS
Diesel, gasoline, or natural gas engine-driven generators are most commonly used to provide 
another source of emergency or standby power when normal utility power fails. Turbine power 
generator sets are also used in this application.
Sturdy, diesel-engine–powered generators are still popular in standby power systems. The 
use of hybrid systems using natural energy, such as the wind and the sun, is growing dramati-
cally; they are not used for emergency or standby power sources. Although diesel generators will 
not become obsolete for on-site electrical power, a need exists for alternate sources, as the role of 
the diesel-engine generator changes from a primary energy source to part of a combined source.
Most engine-driven generator sets are rated from a few hundred watts to several hundred 
kilowatts, although units rated as high as 3000 kW have been successfully applied. Multiple 
units, with some working in parallel, are becoming more commonly used to increase generating 
capacity. Controls may be manual, or automatic, depending on their application.
Transfer Switches
Elementary transfer switches are typically classified as “break before make” switching actions. 
The connection to the normal source of supply is broken before the connection is made to the 
emergency source. This action is intended to prevent the emergency generator from supply-
ing power to the normal utility source. Likewise, as the switch transfers back to normal, the 
emergency source connection is broken before the main power is reconnected. This process is 
referred to as open transition. This open transition is all right for many loads, as the automatic 
transfer takes less than 10 cycles or one-sixth of a second.
Closed transition is needed with some loads. In this situation, when the load is to be 
transferred back to the normal source, a synchronizing action must occur to synchronize the 
two sources so they can both be connected at the same time. The time that both sources are 
connected is very short, as short as 100 milliseconds, but the transfer is made without inter-
rupting the power to the load as it transfers back to normal. The first transfer, from normal to 
emergency, is still open transition.
Another variation on the transfer of load is referred to as soft loading, meaning the load is 
added gradually, or softly, to the auxiliary generator to enable loading of the on-site generation 
to meet the needs. Different modes of operation allow the soft loading to gradually transfer the 
load to the on-site generator to help reduce demand from the utility. The on-site generator can 
be used for cogeneration to sell power back to the utility and the load on the generator can be 
adjusted or programmed to stay constant to supply on-site demand as well as sell surplus power 
to the utility. This type of transfer is designed to have two sources connected simultaneously 
and the electrical load shifts from one to the other in a smooth, predictable fashion.
Depending on where the on-site generator is located, inside the building or separate from 
the building, the transfer switch can be located to efficiently serve the main normal power and 
the generator power feeds. This means that the switch may be located outdoors in an enclosure

suited for the need or it may be installed indoors in a suitable enclosure. Figure 12–1 shows an 
automatic transfer switch.
An elementary diagram of a typical automatic transfer switch is shown in Figure 12–2. 
(The figure does not include engine starting and other controls.)
When the normal supply on the left side is energized, current flows from L1 through the 
time-delay coil (TD) and back to L2. After a predetermined setting of time delay in closing 
contact, the relay R coil becomes energized. Contact R then closes, and energizes the N coil. 
Power contacts N then close, supplying the load from the normal or preferred source. When the 
R coil is energized, it also opens the normally closed R contact interlock in the E coil emergency 
circuit. This safe action ensures that each power supply operates independently of the other.
When the normal power fails, all coils on the left, or normal supply side, become deener-
gized. Relay contact R drops to its normally closed position in the E (emergency coil) circuit. 
Coil E is then energized, which closes the E power contacts feeding the load from an emergency 
electrical supply.
The time delay action helps to ensure that the normal service does not supply the load 
intermittently with the emergency supply. In other words, the switch waits a preset time until 
the normal supply is firmly established, before the load is reconnected to normal.

EMERGENCY SYSTEMS
Applicable NEC and local code rules are considered when an on-site generator is selected. 
These rules differ, depending on whether the generating set is to function as a power source 
in a health care facility, such as a hospital, a standby power system, or as an emergency 
system.
On-site generator systems generally are installed wherever great numbers of people 
gather, and where artificial lighting is required, such as in hotels, theaters, sports arenas, hospi-
tals, and similar institutions. In addition to lighting, emergency systems supply loads that are 
essential to life and safety. Such installations include fire pumps, ventilation, refrigeration, and 
signaling systems. (Refer to Article 700 of the NEC.)
Optional Standby Power Generation Systems
Optional standby power generation systems include alternate power systems for applications 
such as heating, refrigeration, data processing, or communication systems where interruption 
of normal power would cause human discomfort or damage to a product in manufacturing, but 
where life and safety do not depend on the system. (Refer to Article 702 of the NEC.)
UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLIES
Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) are used as power systems to supply critical electronic 
equipment, including electronic computer and data processing equipment as described in 
Article 645—Information Technology Equipment of the NEC.

The basic system includes an electronic section that takes the normal line power and 
converts it to DC power to act as a battery charger. The system has a set of batteries that are 
constantly being charged. These batteries are also connected to an electronic inverter system to 
change the DC battery power back to normal AC power to supply an AC load. The concept is 
to constantly have battery power connected and available to provide a standard level of power 
to the electronic equipment at all times. The battery system is sized to provide the needed 
volt-amp capacity to the system for a specified period of time. The UPS system also provides 
protection from low-voltage conditions (brown-outs) and momentary surges or power deliv-
ery failures. These systems can provide continuous, filtered, and regulated power to sensitive 
equipment. The systems themselves can be sized to provide for a few computers or to supply 
hundreds of computers or other essential equipment. Figure 12–3 shows UPS control panels. 
If the UPS system is large and requires a bank of batteries to supply the uninterruptible power, 
the batteries must be installed according to NEC Article 480.

system indicates current status.

Health Care Facilities
Health care facilities are governed by several NEC rules concerning power sources, emergency 
systems, and essential electrical systems. In particular, refer to NEC Article 517. Article 700 
refers to emergency systems, and Article 701 refers to legally required standby systems.
Figure 12–4 shows a diesel-driven emergency power system consisting of four 450 kW 
electric generating sets. The system is electronically synchronized to deliver 1.8 million watts 
of emergency power for a hospital. Each unit can also be operated independently of the other 
units. Figure 12–5 shows the digital control panel for an alternator.

LEGALLY REQUIRED STANDBY SYSTEMS
NEC Article 701 states that legally required standby power systems are those systems required 
by municipal, state, federal, or other codes or a government agency having jurisdiction. In the 
event of failure of the normal power source, these systems are intended to take over automatical-
ly. Legally required standby power systems are installed to serve such loads as communication 
systems, ventilation and smoke removal systems, sewage disposal, and rescue and firefighting 
equipment, among others. These systems must be installed within the guidelines of the authority 
having jurisdiction.
COGENERATING PLANTS
Cogeneration is being used to help reduce the cost of purchasing power from a local utility. 
Many forms of cogeneration are available. Some use the concept of recovering the energy from 
some manufacturing process to drive electrical generators on site.
Some cogenerating plants are diesel-powered electric generators that are designed to 
recapture and use the waste heat from both their exhaust and cooling systems. Figure 12–6 
shows a standby generator with transfer switch and controller cabinet.

U N I T  1 2   E N G I N E - D R I V E N  G E N E R AT I N G  S E T S
Although cogenerating plants are not a new concept, they are now being used to combat 
rising prices charged by public utility companies for power generation. The nation’s largest man-
ufacturers of diesel engines provide competition for the electric utility companies in the United 
States. As a result, these manufacturers have been concentrating on selling cogenerating plants.
Alongside cogeneration of electrical power is the deregulation of the electrical utility 
monopoly. This deregulation of the power generation and delivery system allows many power 
producers to supply power to the national power grid. In turn, customers can select the power 
producer that can supply the cheapest and most reliable power. In some cases, this means that 
power producers are many states distant and the local utility system provides the conductors to 
deliver the power. Many customers are installing their own on-site power generation to ensure 
that their own power supply is not interrupted because of system overloads or other problems.
Equipped with cogenerating plants, energy users may not have to rely on public utilities 
because users can make their own electricity at a lower cost and provide heating and cooling 
for their buildings.
Various technical methods have been devised for using cogenerating plants. However, 
they all capitalize on the fact that the generation of electricity wastes about twice as much 
energy in the form of heat as the amount of energy that can be generated as electricity. Steam 
heat, as a waste byproduct of manufacturing processes, is now harnessed and used to turn steam 
turbine electric alternators. This electricity, when not needed, may be sold to the public utility 
that services the plant.
As the energy-saving application of cogeneration results in greater demand for electri-
cal work, there are more jobs for electricians. It also should create a particular need for power 
generator operators with the skills to install, operate, and maintain cogenerating equipment.
SUMMARY
When the normal source of electrical power is interrupted, businesses and other organizations 
may require immediate restoration of power to continue critical operations or to sustain life 
and safe conditions. Several methods can be used to provide power, and different criteria deter-
mine which system is required or the best to use. Use the National Electrical Code to determine 
which system is appropriate to install. In addition to required systems, large power consumers 
may generate their own power on site as part of money-saving activities. This cogeneration is 
often used to reduce the amount of energy purchased from the utility or to supply the high-
energy peaks in a facility to reduce demand charges by the utility.

WHEN TO PARALLEL ALTERNATORS
Alternators are paralleled for the same reasons that make it necessary to parallel DC generators. 
Two alternators are paralleled whenever the power demand of the load circuit is greater than 
the power output of a single alternator.
When DC generators are paralleled, the output voltage and electrical polarity of the 
machines must be matched with the voltage and polarity of the line. Similar matching is 
required when alternators are paralleled. However, the matching of alternator polarity to that of 
the line presents problems not encountered when matching DC generator and line polarities. 
The output voltage of an alternator is continuously changing in both magnitude and polarity 
at a definite frequency. Thus, when two alternators are paralleled, not only must the rate of 
the rise and fall of voltage in both alternators be equal, but the rise and fall of voltage in one 
machine must be exactly in step with the rise and fall of voltage in the other machine. When two 
alternators are in step, they are said to be in synchronism. Alternators cannot be paralleled until 
their voltages, frequencies, and instantaneous polarities are nearly equal.
Figure 13–1 shows a comparison of the voltage curves of one of the phases of two three-
phase generators operating independently but at different frequencies. The voltage curves must 
be in synchronism before paralleling machines.

 generators running at diﬀ erent frequencies.

The output voltage of an alternator can be controlled by varying the strength of the direct 
current in the field circuit of the alternator. A field current control can be used to vary the DC 
current. Because the frequency of an alternator varies directly with speed changes, you must be 
able to control the speed of at least one alternator in an installation containing two machines.
ACHIEVING SYNCHRONIZATION
To synchronize AC generators, several important factors must be checked:
• The phase rotation of both generator systems must be the same. Check this with lights, 
as described later, or use a phase rotation meter to determine ABC or ACB rotation.
• The AC voltages of both generators should be equal. In practice, the voltage of the 
incoming generator is usually slightly higher than that of the other operating generator.

• The frequencies of the incoming generators must match when synchronized. In practice, 
the frequency of the incoming generator is 1 to 2 Hz higher than that of the on-line 
 generator. This can be observed with lights or by using a synchroscope.
The speed and output voltage of the incoming generator are slightly higher to prevent it 
from becoming a load to the system when it is connected.
Two methods of synchronization using lights are described next.
Three Dark Method
This section describes the method of synchronizing two alternators using the three dark 
method. Figure 13–2 illustrates a circuit used to parallel two three-phase alternators. Alternator 
G2 is connected to the load circuit. Alternator G1 is to be paralleled with alternator G2. Three 
lamps rated at double the output voltage to the load are connected between alternator G1 and 
the load circuit as shown. When both machines are operating, one of two effects are observed:

• The three lamps light and go out in unison at a rate that depends on the difference in 
frequency between the two alternators.
• The three lamps light and go out at a rate that depends on the difference in frequency 
between the two machines, but not in unison. In this case, the machines are not 
 connected in the proper phase sequence and are said to be out of phase. To correct this, 
you need to interchange any two leads to alternator G1. The machines are not paral-
leled until all lamps light and go out in unison. The lamp method is shown for greater 
 simplicity of operation.
By making slight adjustments in the speed of alternator G1, the frequency of the machines 
can be equalized so that the synchronizing lamps light and go out at the lowest possible rate.

When the three lamps are out, the instantaneous electrical polarity of the three leads from G1 
is the same as that of G2. At this instant, the voltage of G1 is equal to and in phase with that of 
G2. Now the paralleling switch can be closed so that both alternators supply power to the load. 
The two alternators are in synchronism, according to the three dark method.
The three dark method has certain disadvantages and is seldom used. A large voltage 
may be present across an incandescent lamp even though it is dark (burned out). As a result, 
it is possible to close the paralleling connection while there is still a large voltage and phase 
 difference between the machines. For small capacity machines operating at low speed, the 
phase difference may not affect the operation of the machines. However, when large capacity 
units having low armature reactance operate at high speed, a considerable amount of damage 
may result if there is a large phase difference when you attempt to parallel the units.
Two Bright, One Dark Method
Another method of synchronizing alternators is the two bright, one dark method. In this method, 
any two connections from the synchronizing lamps are crossed after the alternators are con-
nected and tested for the proper phase rotation. (The alternators are tested by the three dark 
method.) Figure 13–3(A) shows the connections for establishing the proper phase rotation by 
the three dark method. Figure 13–3(B) shows the lamp connections required to synchronize 
the alternator by the two bright, one dark method.

When the alternators are synchronized, lamps 1 and 2 are bright and lamp 3 is dark. 
Because two of the lamps are becoming brighter as one is dimming, it is easier to determine the 
moment when the paralleling switch can be closed. Furthermore, by observing the sequence 
of lamp brightness, you can tell whether the speed of the alternator being synchronized is too 
slow or too fast.

Synchroscope
A synchroscope is recommended for synchronizing two alternators because it accurately 
shows the exact instant of synchronism (Figure 13–4). The pointer rotates clockwise when 
an incoming alternator is running fast and counterclockwise when an incoming alternator 
is running slow. When the pointer is stationary, pointing upward, the alternators are syn-
chronized. Because the synchroscope is connected across one phase only, it cannot be used 
safely until the alternators have been tested and connected together for the proper phase 
rotation. Synchronizing lamps or other means must be used to determine the phase rota-
tion. In commercial applications, the alternator connections to a three-phase bus through 
a paralleling switch are permanent. This means that continuous tests for phase rotation are

not necessary. As a result, a synchroscope is the only instrument required to detect when 
the alternators are synchronized and to parallel them. However, a set of lights is often used 
as a double-check system.
Prime Movers
In industrial applications, alternators are driven by various types of prime movers such as steam 
turbines, water turbines, and internal combustion engines. For applications on ships, alterna-
tors often are driven by DC motors. Regardless of how alternators are driven, speed variation 
is a factor in paralleling the machines. Thus, the electrician should have a basic knowledge of 
speed governors and other speed-regulating devices. This text, however, does not detail the 
operation of these mechanical devices.
PARALLELING ALTERNATORS
Because apprentices are likely to be required to parallel alternators driven by DC motors 
sometime in their instruction, the following steps outline the procedure for paralleling these 
machines. Figure 13–5 illustrates a typical circuit for paralleling two three-phase alternators.
Procedure
 
1. Set the field rheostat (R2) of alternator G2 to the maximum resistance position.
 
2. Knowing the number of field poles in alternator G2, determine the speed required 
to generate the desired frequency.
 
3. Energize the prime mover to bring alternator G2 up to the required speed.
 
4. Set Switch S3 to read the AC voltage across one phase of G2. Adjust field rheostat 
R2 until the output voltage is equal to the rated voltage of the load circuit.
 
5. Close the load switch and switch S4 to feed the load circuit. Readjust the speed 
of the prime mover to maintain the predetermined speed required for the desired 
frequency.
 
6. Readjust R2 to obtain the rated AC voltage of the load circuit.
 
7. Energize the prime mover to drive the second alternator, G1. Adjust the speed of 
the alternator to the approximate value required to match the frequencies of the 
alternators.
 
8. Set switch S3 to measure the AC voltage across one phase of G1. Adjust field 
 rheostat R1 until the AC voltage is equal at either position of switch S3. The 
 voltage output of both alternators is now equal.

9. (Phase Rotation.) With paralleling switch S2 open, close switch S1. The three sets 
of lamps across the terminals of the open switch respond in one of two ways:
 
 
a. The three lamps brighten and then dim in unison.
 
 
b.  Two lamps brighten in unison as the remaining lamp dims. Then the two bright 
lamps dim as the dark lamp brightens.
 
10. If the lamps respond as in 9(a), the alternators are connected for the proper 
phase rotation. The operator then may proceed to step 12 in synchronizing the 
alternators.
 
11. If the lamps respond as in 9(b), the alternators are not in the proper phase 
 rotation. To correct the condition, interchange any two alternator leads at the 
 terminals of switch S2. All three lamps should dim together and brighten together. 
No attempt to parallel the alternators should be made until the lamps respond in 
this manner.
 
12. The three lamp sets flicker (dim and brighten) at a rate equal to the frequency 
 difference between the two alternators. Adjust the speed control of prime mover 
Ml to make the lamps flicker at the lowest possible rate.
 
13. Interchange two lamp set leads (not alternator leads) at the terminals of switch 
S2 so that the alternators can be synchronized using the two bright, one dark 
method.
 
14. Again adjust the field rheostat of alternator G1 until both alternators have the same 
output voltage as measured at either position of the voltmeter switch S3.
 
15. With one hand on switch S2, watch the lamps. Close the switch at the exact instant 
that two lamps are at their brightest and the other lamp is out. This operation 
shunts out the synchronizing lamps and parallels the alternators.
 
16. Ammeters I1 and I2 indicate the amount of load current carried by each alternator. 
If the load circuit has a unity power factor, then the sum of the ammeter readings 
should equal the reading of the ammeter in the load circuit.
 
17. Note that a change in the field excitation of either alternator does not apprecia-
bly change the amount of current supplied to the system. Such a change in field 
excitation does, however, affect the power factor of the specific alternator. The 
field rheostat of each machine should be adjusted to the highest power factor as 
indicated by the lowest value of current from the individual machine. Increasing 
or decreasing the mechanical power to either alternator increases or decreases 
the load current of that machine. As a result, the division of the load between the 
alternators can be changed by slight changes in the alternator speed.

Speed versus Load Characteristics
Two alternators operating in parallel must have the same frequency and the same terminal 
 voltage. In addition, the prime movers of the parallel alternators must have similar drooping 
speed load characteristics. For steam-, diesel-, water-, or gas-driven prime movers, the speed 
load characteristic depends on adjustments of a mechanical speed control governor. These 
adjustments determine the division of load for two alternators operating in parallel. For this 
reason, the kilowatt load delivered by two alternators in parallel cannot be divided in any 
desired proportion by varying the DC field excitation of either machine.
Two alternators properly connected in parallel operate in stable equilibrium. If one alter-
nator attempts to pull out of synchronism, a current is created that circulates between both 
alternators. This current increases the speed of the lagging machine and retards the leading 
machine, thus preventing the machines from pulling out of synchronism.
REVERSE POWER
If, for any reason, one machine is allowed to slow to a point where the other machine is taking 
all the electrical load, the zero load generator then goes to a negative value, or “reverse power.” 
This generator has now become a motor. This situation is of particular concern where the 
machine’s protective scheme has not been designed to operate properly in the motoring situ-
ation. In such conditions, reverse-current relays are usually employed to trip the generator on 
detection of reverse power flow.
Results of Motorization of a Generator
If a generator loses prime mover power, it acts as a motor with a DC field on the rotor. The 
DC field causes the rotor to try and follow the AC field in the same direction as before. If 
the mechanical drag on the rotor is heavy, it will fall behind and “slip poles,” inducing a large 
voltage into the rotor; this can cause insulation breakdown of the windings, flashover at the 
brushes, and violent shaking of the generator mountings.
If a generator loses DC excitation to the rotor it does not generate, but the prime mover 
power still turns the rotor. Now the generator acts as a motor running at no load.
SUMMARY
In many cases, the parallel operation of alternators is essential to provide needed power and 
to maintain electrical power during peak loads or when removing an alternator from service 
for maintenance. The requirements for paralleling are (1) the phase rotation of the generated 
voltage must be the same, (2) the voltage at the paralleling point must be the same, and (3) 
the frequencies of the generators must match. Lamps and synchroscopes are often used to aid 
in the paralleling procedure. If a generator loses output power, it must be removed from the 
electrical power system, or serious consequences could result.

This unit presents the control panel and equipment for a three-phase, 2400-volt alterna-
tor. The circuits and connections covered in detail are the direct-current field circuit and all 
control equipment; the alternating-current, three-phase output circuit with associated switch-
gear; and the connections for the instruments and instrument transformers used in a common 
installation.
DIRECT-CURRENT CIRCUIT FOR FIELD EXCITATION
When alternators are connected so that they are separately excited, a DC bus must be used to 
deliver the DC power for field excitation to multiple generators. This system is used so that if 
one alternator fails, other alternators may still use the DC bus for excitation. In this case, the DC 
bus is connected to each of the alternators supplying power to the system. Each generator con-
trol panel has individual controls to monitor and adjust the DC power taken from the bus and 
delivered to the alternator’s field. In this way, each alternator’s output voltage can be controlled 
and the power factor of the output power can be adjusted by the field control. In some genera-
tion systems, switches open and close the DC power to the field. If there are manual switches, 
the switch must contain some method of discharging the DC field as it is opened. If there is no 
system for discharging the field, the DC field that collapses in the field coil generates very high 
voltages in the field coil (inductive kick concept) and the field windings may be destroyed. In 
some generator systems, a large diode system is installed to prevent field discharge damage. 
Under a normal connection, the diode is reverse biased and does not conduct. In the event of 
the magnetic field collapse, the diode becomes forward biased and conducts current back to the 
winding, reduces the inductive kick effect, and prevents field breakdown.
Figure 14–1 illustrates the connections required for the separately excited field circuit of 
an alternator. Note that when the field discharge switch is open, the auxiliary blade closes to 
complete a path through the field discharge resistor. Thus, any inductive voltage in the alterna-
tor field is discharged through the field discharge resistor to prevent damage. The field rheostat 
is connected so that it is not in the discharge circuit.
ALTERNATOR OUTPUT CIRCUIT
The alternator in the installation described in this unit is rated at 2400 volts, three phase. The 
three-phase, 2400-volt output of the alternator is fed to the switchboard through a three-wire, 
high-voltage lead cable in galvanized rigid conduit. The three conductors are fed through an oil-
type circuit breaker, current transformers, and disconnect switches to the three-phase bus bars. 
An oil-type circuit breaker (switch) is used because of the relatively high voltage of the alterna-
tor. As the contacts of this switch open, any arc is immediately quenched in insulating oil.
Figure 14–2 illustrates an electrically operated oil switch (circuit breaker). Note that each 
of the three sets of contactors is mounted in a separate cell or tank that is filled with an insulat-
ing oil. The three sets of contactors thus open and close in oil. The figure also shows a contactor

assembly for one pole of a three-pole oil switch. Note the closing coil and the trip coils. The 
closing coil is relatively large and has a very fast positive action; the trip coil is smaller in size. 
The trip coil actuates a trip latch that causes the oil switch contactors to open.
The control circuit for the oil switch in most alternator installations is connected to a DC 
source such as a bank of batteries. If there is a complete failure of the AC power, the oil switch 
can still be operated from the DC source, as is true of other emergency circuits.
A small switch handle located on the switchboard is used to actuate the control circuit. 
Two indicating lamps also are mounted on the switchboard. One of the indicating lamps is 
green and is on when the oil switch is open. The second indicating lamp is red and is on when 
the oil switch is closed. The red lamp normally is located directly above the control switch 
handle, and the green lamp is located below the switch handle.
Figure 14–3 shows the schematic connection diagram of the control circuit for the oil 
switch. When the oil switch is in the open, or off, position, the green pilot lamp is on. Note that

and closes its contacts to establish a path through the DC closing coil. The three main sets of oil 
switch contacts also change at this time. When the main closing relay is energized, the normally 
closed M contacts open. In addition, the green pilot lamp circuit opens, and the two normally 
open M contacts close. The red indicating lamp is now on. When the on button is released, the 
oil switch remains in the on position because it is secured by a mechanical latch mechanism.
When the off button is pressed, the DC trip coil is energized to trip the latch mechanism. 
The oil switch contacts thus open to the off position. As a result, the red indicating lamp goes 
out, and the green indicating lamp lights.
The control handle and indicating lamps for an oil switch generally are mounted on the 
switchboard. The oil switch itself, however, is usually located separately from the switchboard 
room.
Current transformers are used to step down the current in the output leads of the alter-
nator to a value that can be used in instrument circuits. Step-down current transformers also 
insulate the low-voltage instrument circuit from the high-current primary circuit. The second-
ary current rating of a current transformer is 5 amperes (see Unit 23). The current rating of 
the primary winding of the transformer must be high enough to handle the maximum current 
delivered by the alternator.
The alternator output leads feed from the current transformers to disconnect switches 
and then to the three-phase bus bars. A disconnect switch is a form of knife switch that is 
opened with a switch stick while exposed to air. The disconnect switches are operated only 
after the alternator oil switch is opened. The operator must wear rubber gloves when using an 
approved switch stick to open the disconnect switches. Never open disconnect switches under 
load—this is the purpose of the oil switch. It is designed to interrupt the arc without damage 
to the switch blade.
In most alternator installations, the three-phase bus bars are energized constantly. 
Because the disconnect switches disconnect the oil switch and the alternator from the bus bars, 
the alternator can be shut down and the disconnect switches opened to permit maintenance 
work on the oil switch under safe conditions. When the alternator requires maintenance or 
repair work, the disconnect switches are pulled to the off position even though the oil switch 
is open. The reason for this precaution is that the insulating oil in the oil switch may have 
become carbonized. The carbonized oil can act as a partial conductor, resulting in a feedback 
from the live 2400-volt bus bars through the oil switch and carbonized oil to the alternator 
terminals. Remember that the disconnect switches and the oil switch must be open when any 
maintenance or repair work is to be done on AC generators. The generators should also be 
shut down.
Figure 14–4 is a wiring diagram of typical alternator connections to the three-phase 
bus bars.
The three bus bars for the AC output of the alternator are mounted on insulators 
because the bus bars have a potential difference of 2400 volts between them. It is important

that the proper air gap be maintained between the three bus bars and that adequate clearance 
be  provided between the bus bars and the ceiling and side walls of the room. Barriers shall be 
placed in all service switchboards to isolate the service bus bars and terminals from the remain-
der of the switchboard.
Large generators are constructed in two styles. One style uses a separate exciter DC 
generator and feeds the DC excitation field into the alternator rotor through brushes and 
slip rings. Because the field current and voltage are relatively low compared to the output

of the alternator, brushes and slip rings work well. The other style of large generation 
equipment uses a brushless exciter style to supply DC to the rotor. Either method is effec-
tive and accomplishes the same task—to provide a DC field to the rotating field of the AC 
generator.
To adjust the field and provide the desired output voltage, the output voltage levels must 
be monitored. In the brush-type rotor connection, the AC is monitored at the output, and a DC 
field of a small DC separately excited generator is controlled. As the output voltage drops, the 
DC field is increased. This small DC generator, called an amplydine, supplies the DC field to a 
larger DC exciter generator. The second generator then supplies DC to the alternator’s field. 
This process allows for stages of amplification of the DC field. A small change in output AC 
affects the DC field to the amplydine that feeds the second stage of amplification for the DC to 
the alternator field. A small control voltage at the amplydine level is used to control the large 
DC to the rotor of the generator.
Brushless exciters are discussed in Unit 11. The concept is to use a small amount of con-
trollable DC, and then amplify it and feed it to the alternator field. This process uses semicon-
ductors to change induced AC into DC on the rotor. Figure 14–5 shows a block diagram of the 
two styles of field control.
ALTERNATOR COOLING
The electrical current flowing in the alternators through conductors produces heat in the 
coils because of I2 R losses. This heat must be removed from the alternator to maintain 
operations. For most small alternators, the windings are air cooled by a fan on the rotor that 
pushes air through slots in the armature winding core. If the alternators are indoors, means 
must be provided to vent the heat as the generators run. In large utility generators, air cool-
ing is not enough. In these circumstances, hydrogen is used for cooling the alternator core. 
Using hydrogen for cooling has the advantage of being less dense than air so that it reduces 
the windage losses in the alternator cooling process. Hydrogen also absorbs and removes 
more heat than air, which provides more efficient cooling. This hydrogen system is normally 
passed around the output voltage bus as well, to provide cooling for the output conductors 
of the alternator.
INSTRUMENT CIRCUITS
The voltage to the potential coils of instruments mounted on the switchboard should not 
exceed 120 to 125 volts. The voltage coils of wattmeters, watt-hour meters, and voltmeters 
usually are designed for a maximum voltage of 150 volts. Because the three-phase output of 
the alternator is 2400 volts, two instrument potential transformers connected in open delta 
are required to step down the voltage to 120 volts, three phase (see Unit 23). The potential 
transformers are small in size because the load on the low-voltage secondary is very small. Each

Figure 14–6, the load on the secondary of the transformer consists of the potential coils of the 
kilowatt meter and the voltmeter. The instrument potential transformers are rated at 2400 
volts on the high-voltage side and 120 volts on the low-voltage side. The low voltage at the

and repairs to the instruments.
The current coils of the measuring instruments mounted on switchboards are rated at a 
maximum current capacity of 5 amperes. In Figure 14–6, each of the two current coils of the 
three-phase kilowatt meter is connected in series with the proper current  transformer.

Figure 14–6 shows a wiring diagram for most of the instruments and instrument trans-
formers described. The current in the secondary of current transformer circuits is never in 
excess of 5 amperes. Therefore, either 14 or 12 AWG wire is used on the rear of the switchboard.
For most permanent switchboard installations, the scale readings on the instruments 
are graduated to include the voltage and current transformer multipliers. This means that any 
error made by the switchboard operator in applying instrument multipliers is automatically 
e liminated.
Two instruments not shown in the wiring diagram in Figure 14–6 are the voltmeter and the 
synchroscope. In typical installations, several alternators may be operating in parallel. Each alterna-
tor has a separate panel, and these panels are mounted next to one another to make up a complete 
switchboard. One voltmeter and one synchroscope are then mounted on a movable panel located 
at the end of the switchboard. The position of this panel can be adjusted so that the voltmeter and 
synchroscope are visible from any one of the generator control panels. A voltmeter switch located 
on each generator panel gives the operator a means of connecting the voltmeter to measure the 
voltage output of any alternator. In addition, special synchronizing switches permit the use of one 
synchroscope to synchronize any one of several alternators to the three-phase system.
Figure 14–7 shows the circuit connections for the voltmeter and synchroscope. Figure 14-6 
indicates that the voltmeter switch has three positions. The voltmeter can be connected across 
any one of the three voltages of an alternator. If the voltage of a second alternator must be 
measured, the voltmeter switch is turned to the off position. The switch handle or key is then 
removed and inserted in the voltmeter switch of the second AC generator. Again, the switch 
may be turned to any one of the three voltage positions. Thus, one voltmeter can be used to 
measure the three voltages of each of several AC generators controlled through the switchboard.
A synchroscope switch is mounted on each alternator panel. When the switch handle is 
turned to the incoming position, the synchroscope is connected to the secondary voltage of 
one phase of an alternator being synchronized with the AC system. The synchroscope switch 
of a second alternator, which is already paralleled with the three-phase system, is connected to 
the run position. Thus, one coil winding of the synchroscope is energized from the running bus 
bars. The other winding of the synchroscope is energized from the incoming bus bars. With 
these connections, the synchroscope indicates the extent that the incoming machine is out of 
phase. When the incoming alternator is in phase with the three-phase system and the alternator 
voltage is equal to that of the bus bars, the control switch can be turned to the on position. As a 
result, the oil switch contactors close, and the alternator is paralleled with the bus bars. The oil 
circuit breaker is used to connect and disconnect the alternator when it is running under load. 
This ensures safe operation and prolongs switch contact life.
Many of the meters on generators are now in digital format. This allows the user to more 
precisely determine the exact currents and voltages being produced. The use of these meters 
is still supplemented by the synchroscope to verify the exact point of synchronism if manual 
paralleling of the alternators is needed.

switch. The field switch must operate to supply DC to the magnetic field and also provide for 
the disconnection and magnetic field discharge. The output power of a generator with higher 
generated voltages may be through a switch designed to quench the arc when  disconnecting. 
One such switch is the oil-type circuit breaker. These switches have arc control systems 
designed for the rated voltage and current. The load-break switch is often held by a latching 
control circuit so that the breaker stays closed without power consumption. Instrument circuits 
are used to monitor the electrical functions of the alternators and provide feedback for voltage 
regulation and current monitoring.

POWER SOURCES
Wind, fuel cells, microturbine, solar photovoltaic power, and flywheel reserve power are all 
alternate sources of electric power. These systems are relatively small sources compared 
to coal or nuclear plants. They produce much less power than a hydroelectric generating 
station and often less than oil-fired steam generation or diesel peaking plants. These small 
generation methods are often used to reduce the demand on the power grid that is normally 
supplied from utility power stations. Sometimes these sources are used in remote locations 
where the power grid is weak or nonexistent. Very often these sources are used to power 
 specific applications, reduce the power needs from the utility, or supplement the utility 
 supply capacity.
Wind Power
As more energy sources are sought, the trend is to convert other sources of energy (such as 
wind) to electric power and then distribute the electricity to where it is needed.
Wind-powered generators are becoming increasing popular for sources of power with 
no direct charge for the source of energy. Unlike the workhorses of commercial generation, 
such as coal and nuclear power, where the procurement, transportation, storage, and waste 
are problems that must be dealt with, wind is free of these drawbacks. The third major 
source of power (after coal and nuclear power) is water or hydroelectric generation, in 
which the resource is free and available as long as it rains. Hydroelectric power generation 
requires a source of water supply, a topography with a large vertical drop for falling water, 
and storage of the potential energy behind hydroelectric dams, which creates its own sets 
of problems.
Generating Power from Wind
The commercial generation of power derived from the wind is a simple concept, but the tech-
nology has improved greatly in the recent past, making it more feasible for economical produc-
tion. Wind-generation “farms” are built after careful studies indicate that enough consistent 
wind is available to make an investment in the towers, turbines, generators, and transformers 
needed to provide power for the power grid. These “farms” have many towers lined up like 
“crops” to harvest the wind.
Wind power has the benefits of cheap, renewable energy, and no waste or storage 
problems. The drawback is, of course, that the wind must blow to produce electricity. In 
many parts of the world and in the United States, some regions have significant wind power 
available on a consistent basis, which makes them good candidates for wind-powered gen-
eration. For the most part, these systems supplement the base load generators providing 
energy locally or to the power grid as “extra” electric power, so the base load can reduce its 
power output.

Wind Technology
Because wind-powered generators come in many different sizes and therefore capacities, the 
 production and uses of the power vary. Large-scale non–wind-generating stations, such as utility 
producers, typically use synchronous generators where the generator speed can be easily con-
trolled. The electrical wind-generation industry cannot count on consistent wind speed to turn 
the generators at precise speeds. (See Figure 15–1 for large wind generation.) Most wind genera-
tors have minimum and maximum operating speeds and therefore maximum and minimum wind 
speed curves for operation. Below these speeds, the generator does not produce enough useful 
power and is taken off line. As seen in the figure, there is a maximum wind speed that produces use-
ful power. As the wind speed exceeds the upper level, the generator wind turbine may be damaged, 
and the turbine is shut down and the blades locked to prevent damage to the blades or the rotor.

control will use direct-drive mode and may be either fixed-speed or variable-speed control. 
With direct drive and fixed speed, the wind turns the turbine, which spins the generator, or a 
speed converter gearbox is used to produce sync speed. The turbine has controls to try to keep 
the speed consistent, and the speed converted is used to hold the output speed steady (see 
Figure 15–2). There is investigation and research being conducted in second-generation high-
temperature superconductivity (HTS) super conductors that do not have to be super cooled. 
These conductors may lead to larger and more effective use of direct-drive wind-generation 
systems. The output of the generator is connected to the output transformer and then to the 
grid. (See Figure 15–3.) Designs have been used to match the speed and frequency concerns 
but this is a challenging problem.

In direct-drive, variable-speed mode the generator is allowed to run at various speed 
and the output voltage and frequency is allowed to fluctuate. The output of the generator is fed 
to a rectifier assembly and then to an inverter to produce the desired voltage and frequency to 
the output grid. The conversion process can be expensive for large machines. See Figure 15–4.

Currently, a large portion of large wind generation is provided by asynchronous or 
induction generators. An induction generator works by the common principle of spinning 
a magnetic field within a stationary stator. If the stator is connected to an AC source of the 
grid, the stator magnetic field spins at a synchronous speed dictated by the stator frequency. 
If the rotor has a mechanical input and spins at the same speed as the stator field, no volt-
age is induced into the rotor. If the rotor spins inside the stator at greater than synchronous 
speed, then the rotor works as a rotating field generator and has induced voltage into the 
stator. If the rotor spins slower than synchronous speed, the machine acts like a motor 
and current is inducted through induction into the rotor and consumes power from the 
grid. At this point, the wind generator must be disconnected to avoid being a load to the

Refer to Figure 15–5 as a graph 
of the speed of an induction gen-
erator and torque, which can cre-
ate a generating effect. As the wind 
speed increases, driving the rotor 
faster than synchronous speed, 
the rotor torques also increases 
and the generator does more work 
therefore generating more electri-
cal power, which creates a counter 
torque (see Unit 6, “Single-Phase 
AC Generation Principles”), slow-
ing the actual speed of the rotor, 
which helps regulate the speed of the rotor. The output frequency of the stator, tied to the 
grid, stays at the grid frequency. This is the concept used in induction generators.
Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG)
A wound-rotor motor–type of machine can be used a generator. (See information on wound-
rotor motors in Electricity 4.) In wound-rotor motors there are connections to the stator (per-
manent connections), and there are connections to the windings of the rotor through slip rings 
(rotating connections). Compared to a synchronous generator, the DFIG can have a wider 
range of rotor speeds—up to 10% over synchronous speed. At the lower speed range, the DFIG 
can still generate power where a synchronous generator cannot. This extended speed range is 
accomplished by more control on the DFIG and is at a higher cost, but is economical because 
of the overall power production range. By making connections to the rotor, the rotor current 
and induced voltage occurs when the rotor spins faster than the synchronous speed of the sta-
tor, which is connected to a 60 Hz grid system. For instance, if the stator frequency is 60 Hz 
and it is a four-pole, three-phase machine, the synchronous speed of the rotating field is 1800 
rpm. If the rotor spins at the same speed, no voltage is induced. If the rotor spins faster, then 
magnetic induction takes place and a voltage is induced into the rotor windings as if it were a

rotating armature machine. Connect the rotor windings to a load, and the output of the rotor 
can be used. Typically the rotor output voltage is rectified and then inverted to the desired load 
frequency and voltage.
If the rotor is connected to an AC supply, the output of the rotor may be negated or 
canceled by a counter-electromotive force CEMF (opposite voltage) that, in effect, opposes 
the rotor output and creates a zero current output total. At this point, no voltage is produced 
or induced into the stator. By increasing the rotor CEMF, the spinning rotor induces back into 
the stator of the wound-rotor motor. Because the rotor current produces a field that is inducing 
into the stator, the synchronous frequency of the stator is slightly reduced. However, the stator 
is still connected to a power grid and still produces power at the new lower frequency. This pro-
cess of feeding both the stator and the rotor of the wound-rotor–type machine creates a doubly 
fed induction generator. At rotor speeds below sync speed, the rotor takes some power from the 
grid and uses it as excitation, as is seen in a rotating armature–type generator. The rotor torque 
produced by the wind power continues to generate electricity.
If the generators are asynchronous, then the control mode may be squirrel-cage mode, 
variable slip mode, or variable slip with DFIG mode.
The variable slip with the DFIG needs more complex control. This type of generation 
produces a majority of the output power (about two-thirds) from the stator and a smaller 
amount (one-third) from the rotor. The stator can be connected to the grid through transform-
ers to match the voltage, but the rotor voltage and frequency must be rectified and inverted to 
match the grid. See Figure 15–6.

Small Wind Systems
For small wind turbine systems—generating up to and including 100 kW—the systems are less 
complicated and are covered in NEC Article 694. The majority of these small systems are direct-
drive, permanent magnet induction generators. These generators generally have a maximum 
voltage of 600 volts when connected to one- or two-family dwellings. They may have higher 
output if they comply with Part IX of Article 694. Any live parts over 150 volts to ground must 
only be accessible to qualified persons when the system is energized. The nacelle is the enclo-
sure for the turbine and alternator. Where installing the tower and support structure, follow the 
requirements in Article 690.4.
Article 694.12 determines circuit sizes based on current. The turbine output circuit cur-
rents are based on the maximum power output the generator is designed to produce. As most 
of these generators produce a varying output voltage and frequency, the generator output is 
fed to a rectifier system that converts the AC to a DC supply. The output of the rectifier is 
then fed to an inverter (much like the process for VFDs), and the inverter output is tied to 
an output system. The circuit ampacity of the output of the inverter shall be based on the 
continuous output current rating. If the system is a stand-alone (not connected to a grid), 
the input current to the inverter shall be that current that the inverter can use to supply an 
output at the lowest input voltage. The current values obtained shall be considered continu-
ous currents. The conductors for the system shall be sized to carry 125% of the currents, as 
calculated above.
Article 694.18 refers to stand-alone systems. The premises wiring system designed to 
supply a premises shall have the same requirement as if it were supplied by a typical service. 
The supply side of the stand-alone service can be modified by NEC 694.18(A–D). The inverter 
output is allowed to supply less than the full calculated load on a disconnect. The inverter sup-
ply must not be less than the largest single utilization load on the system. The size of the circuit 
conductors between the inverter and the structure disconnect shall be based on the rating of 
the inverter output. The output can feed just 120 volts to a structure if following the guideline 
of Article 394.18C.
Wind-generation systems often have storage systems, meaning batteries. If the differ-
ent power systems are interconnected—having a utility feed and power from the wind—
then, according to NEC Article 694.50, all points of interconnection must be marked at an 
accessible location at the disconnecting means with voltage and current ratings. Plaques 
must also indicate the location of both energy system disconnects. If the wind generation 
is interactive, then the inverter is tied to the utility grid. These inverters must be listed 
as identified to be interactive, which means they will automatically disconnect the wind 
 system from the utility line if the utility has no power. As required, the frequency and 
 voltage levels must be the same as the grid, and the power must be synchronized as the 
power is reconnected.

Battery storage is used to supply power to the premises when no wind is blowing. 
These batteries typically require charging controllers to help regulate battery charging. See 
NEC Article 694.75 for alternatives. A diversion charge controller is used to either charge the 
 batteries or supply the load. It is required to protect the battery system from overcharging. The 
charging power can be sent to the batteries to bring them to full charge, and then the energy 
above that which is needed is “dumped” or diverted. These controllers were sometimes referred 
to as dump controllers now called diversion controllers. The excess energy was either used to 
heat water, run lights, or for some other nonessential function. Now we say that we divert the 
energy to another function. According to the Code, you need two reliable loads to divert to, but 
these loads cannot be the utility connection. These alternative energy systems are continually 
 changing and are going through technical and regulatory revisions.
Fuel Cells
Fuel cells generate electrical power through a chemical reaction. Fuel cells are becoming 
more abundant and more economical as an alternative energy solution. Recently, more heav-
ily populated states in the Northeast and the Western United States have been using fuel cell 
power production to provide temporary standby power. In the event of power grid failure by 
storm or accident, the power is restored to cell towers and essential communication points 
by using local fuel cell power production. Fuel cells have been used for years for small-scale 
electrical power needs and have been used in vehicles ranging from the space shuttle to city 
buses, trucks, and passenger cars. Different types of fuel cells exist that produce DC electric 
power by using different types of electrolytes and different compositions of cathode and 
anode.
The basic concept of all fuel cells is the same in that they use hydrogen as a fuel. 
Hydrogen is plentiful but needs to be processed for fuel cell use. As hydrogen enters the fuel 
cell at the anode, a chemical reaction occurs that pulls the electron away from the hydrogen 
atom. These stripped electrons are the electron current source for the external electrical 
circuit. The positive hydrogen ions are now in the electrolyte (see Figure 15–7). Another 
resource that is needed to complete the chemical reaction is oxygen, which enters the cathode. 
The oxygen is taken from the surrounding air. As the electrons return from the electric circuit, 
they recombine with the hydrogen ions and the oxygen atoms to create H2O, or water. The 
waste from this reaction is water, which is sent down a drain. The other byproduct of the reac-
tion is heat. This heat is often captured and used for other needs such as water heating or space 
heating, or even cooling using absorption-type chillers, making the fuel cell very efficient. The 
process of using the electrical DC output for customer use usually requires that the power be 
inverted through an electronic system much like the frequency-producing components of a 
variable frequency drive. See Figure 15–8 for an operating fuel cell producing 5 kW of power 
for a customer site.

Types of Fuel Cells
Different types of fuel cells have specific advantages and disadvantages. Alkaline fuel cells 
use potassium hydroxide in water as the electrolyte. They are about 70% efficient and oper-
ate at about 300–400° Fahrenheit (149–204°C). These cells have small electrical outputs, 
from 300 W to 1000 kW; however, they need pure hydrogen fuel and pure oxygen, and 
have expensive platinum electrodes. Molten carbonate fuel cells use high-temperature salts 
for an electrolyte and can leak. These fuel cells are 60–80% efficient and can produce up to 
2 mW. They use an inexpensive nickel electrode. The major drawback is the high heat of 
approximately 1200°F (649°C). Because it takes time to reach operating temperature, the 
cell is best used for continuous load under supervision because of the high heat. Phosphoric 
acid cells have a lower operating temperature—300–400°F (149–204°C)—and have an 
efficiency of about 60%. The electrolyte is phosphoric acid, which allows the cell to use less 
concentrated fuels and comes in sizes from 200 kW to 11 mW. Proton exchange membrane 
(PEM) fuel cells are about 45% efficient and operate at about 174°F (79°C). The electro-
lyte is a solid membrane that does not leak, which makes PEMs suitable for mobile units 
between 50 W and 200 kW. The hydrogen fuel must be purified and the electrodes are 
expensive platinum.
NEC Article 692 Fuel Cell Systems
Article 692.2 provides the definitions needed to determine the NEC requirements for fuel cell 
installations. Because fuel cells are often supplementary power sources, the Code requires that 
a permanent plaque or directory that lists all the power sources be established at each ser-
vice location. Article 692.4(C) states that fuel cell systems shall only be installed by qualified 
 persons. The fuel cell must be evaluated and listed for the intended purpose, and the listed cur-
rent on the nameplate shall be the circuit current rating. The feeder conductors that connect 
the fuel cell to the premises wiring must be sized on the nameplate or the rating of the integral 
overcurrent protection on the fuel cell.
Article 692.10(C) states that a fuel cell that is a stand-alone, meaning that the system pro-
vides power independently of an electrical distribution network, and that only supplies a single-
phase, 120/240-volt panel board with 120 volts, where there are no 240-volt loads, must be 
 posted with a sign that warns that no multiwire branch circuits can be attached. NEC Chapter 3—
Wiring Methods are permitted to be used with the fuel cell installations as well as any specific 
equipment listed for fuel cells. Article 692.41(B) dictates how to ground systems that are not 
“stand-alone” systems.
When the fuel cell is used to feed power back to a supply grid, the fuel cell must be able to 
detect when the utility power is lost. If the supply is lost, the fuel cell must not feed power back 
to the supply grid. This is a safety feature for utility line workers who would assume the power 
is off and do not want power to backfeed on to their lines.

Microturbine
Microturbines are another source of local power that can be used for stand-alone power at a site 
or as cogeneration that is supplied back to a power grid. As the name implies, microturbines are 
generators driven by mechanical turbines that are small scale compared to the large commercial 
generators. The microturbine consists of a system with a compressor, a combustor, a turbine, 
and a permanent magnet generator. The turbine is designed to spin at a very high speed: 
96,000 RPM. This turns the rotor with a mounted two-pole permanent magnet inside the fixed 
armature. The generator actually produces a variable frequency, up to 1600 Hz AC output volt-
age, which is rectified and fed to a DC bus section of the output. The power is then inverted 
through an IGBET inverter to produce a typical output of three-phase, 480-volt, 60 Hz output. 
Microturbines are typically 30–60 kW each, so larger loads would need two or more systems 
connected via paralleling gear.
Microturbines are meant to run continuously for up to a year, then are removed from 
service for minor maintenance, and then restarted. These systems are designed to run on “air 
bearings,” so there is very little friction and no need for bearing replacement or lubrication, or 
coolants. They can be fueled by natural gas, propane, diesel, or kerosene. They can even use 
“waste gas” as a fuel. Waste gas may be methane from sewage treatment, landfill venting, agri-
cultural digesters, and so forth.
Solar Photovoltaic
Solar photovoltaic systems have become more popular as photovoltaic (PV) cells have 
become more efficient and costs have been reduced. Many individual cells are connected 
together to make up PV modules or panels. As the panels are assembled, the individual cells 
may be connected in series, which raises the voltage of the panel (series circuit rules). The 
individual cells may also be connected in parallel, which raises the total current of the panel, 
but not the voltage (parallel circuit rules). The panels are typically rated by output watts 
and the output voltage and current at nominal values. (See Figure 15–9 for an example.) A 
system of panels assembled into systems to collect sunlight and create electricity is called 
an array.

The actual photovoltaic cells are of three main types. The first type, consisting of single 
crystalline, multicrystalline, or amorphous-type silicon cells, is about 15% efficient. The second 
type of cell is produced as a polycrystalline thin film, which is about 10% efficient, with copper 
indium gallium di-selenide (CIGS) or cadmium telluride (CdTe). A third type is thin film sili-
con with gallium arsenide. Each type of cell has its own advantages and disadvantages. For all 
photocells, the efficiency of conversion falls as the temperature rises. This has been improved 
by the development of newer cells, such as heterojunction intrinsic thin film (HIT) by Sanyo, 
which have high efficiency at higher temperatures. Cells typically produce low voltage—about 
0.5 volt and between 1 and 6 amps.
As panels are assembled, the number and type of cells determine the output of the panels. 
The typical output voltages are between 12 and 60 volts. The output currents vary according to 
the number of panels connected. NEC Article 690.7 refers to the maximum photovoltaic system 
voltage for open circuit voltage, which is highest at no current draw. In reference to the system 
temperature, the lowest expected ambient temperature produces the highest output voltage. 
If the type of cell is crystalline or multicrystalline, then a correction factor must be applied to 
the open circuit voltage if the ambient temperatures are expected to be below 77°F (25°C). As 
noted in the NEC article, if the ambient temperature is below –40°F (–40°C), or if other cell 
materials are used, then the manufacturer’s instructions should be followed. The voltages thus 
obtained should be used for the voltage ratings of PV connecting cables. The current ratings 
of these same cables is determined by the sum of the individual panel’s short circuit (0 volts) 
output current that is connected in parallel.
The PV system includes the power controllers, or inverters, with arrays or subarrays. An 
array is an assembly of mounted panels with a support structure that may be either permanent 
or a moveable system that tracks the sunlight for optimum amount of direct sunlight during the 
day. These arrays may be monopole, meaning they have one set of power leads, one positive 
and one negative. They may also be bipolar arrays, which have two output leads. One lead is 
positive to a common point, or ground reference, and the other lead is negative with respect 
to the common lead. These arrays or subarrays have to be connected in a component called a 
combiner box in order to provide the desired power for the inverters or other system compo-
nents. As the name implies, the arrays or panels are combined to create a single supply of power. 
NEC Article 690.4 provides rules for installation of the PV systems, which state that PV conduc-
tors and non-PV system conductors must not be contained in the same raceway, or they must 
be separated by a partition in a box, cable tray, or gutter. Photovoltaic system conductors must 
be grouped and labeled as per Article 690.4 B(1–4). If the output voltage of monopole subar-
rays exceeds the voltage as part of a bipolar system, then the leads from the monopole arrays 
must be kept separated until they are connected to the inverter.
Another component of the PV systems is the inverter, which is used to bring the DC 
voltage produced by the PV array to a useable AC voltage with the desired frequency by using 
electronics, much like a variable frequency drive (VFD). The term string inverter refers only to

the method of connecting the panels in strings or series, to increase the voltage of the system 
without increasing the current. The voltage may be up to 800 VDC. A string of arrays can be 
connected in series to a combiner box and to an inverter (string inverter), using a smaller wire 
size and keeping the voltage high to deliver large amounts of power. Another type of inverter is 
a central inverter. In this case, a single inverter, rather than several smaller inverters, is used to 
create AC voltage. These may be used on larger power systems or may be a more economical 
method for a particular system design. (See Figures 15–10[A] and 10[B]). Inverters are often 
used as utility interactive devices, meaning that the inverter connects the local PV generation 
system to the utility in order to sell power to the serving utility. The name used is grid interac-
tive inverter. When the power that is sold to the utility is sold at the same rate as the power 
that is bought from the utility, the term used is net metering. Some utilities have net metering 
agreements, and some buy power from the local producer at a different rate from what they 
charge for the grid power. In either case, the grid interactive inverter has to synchronize with 
the utility before the connection is completed so that the power supplied to the grid matches 
the grid requirements. If the utility system loses power, the premises generation cannot remain 
connected to continue supplying power to the utility grid. This is a dangerous situation, as util-
ity workers are working under the assumption that their system is deenergized, and they would

battery voltage must not exceed 50 volts, or a total of 24 batteries at 2 volts per cell. The system 
inverter may also act as a battery-charging controller.
Micro-Hydro Generators
Another alternate source of electrical energy is the use of small electrical generators that use 
the force of flowing water to provide the mechanical energy needed to spin the rotor. The 
concept is to generate small amounts of power by directing water to these generators from 
moving streams, or even from moving water such as tidal pools, or from moving boats. These 
small generators are used to provide supplementary power to remote locations or additional 
power without the need for fuels. There are three basic types of turbines currently designed for 
different applications.
The impulse style uses a “spinner”-type propeller where the water is channeled to the 
propeller and strikes it to cause the mechanical force. This system works well if there is vertical 
drop, or “head,” of 20 feet or more, but requires little water volume. Another style of micro-
turbines is a reaction-style turbine. With this style, there must be a large flow of water directed 
to the impellor, but it does not need much head. It can be installed in a moving stream. The 
third style is a submersible impeller that takes advantage of a fast-moving stream or is used 
over the side of a moving boat. All these systems are designed to charge batteries at typically 
12 to 24 VDC. The batteries are part of a storage system that can receive power from multiple 
sources. The output is then connected to inverters to provide the system voltage desired.
UPS Using Flywheel Technology
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is used where there cannot be an interruption to the 
power supply. (See UPS battery systems in Unit 12.) At least one manufacturer has incor-
porated the physics of momentum into a power generation system. This system is called the 
battery-free uninterruptible power system (BF-UPS).
This alternative energy storage system uses the concept of stored energy in the inertia 
of a spinning flywheel. During normal power supply to a facility, the BF-UPS allows a large 
flywheel to spin at a constant speed. The flywheel is constantly spinning on high quality bear-
ing, so the energy needed to maintain momentum in the flywheel is minimal. In the event of a 
line disturbance or a power failure, the spinning flywheel gives up its energy to keep an integral 
generator running with no interruption of power. The flywheel is sized to provide up to 2 min-
utes of full power before the flywheel begins to slow down. This is usually enough time to start 
a standby generator and bring it up to synchronization speed to pick up the load. A side benefit 
of the flywheel system is that it can actually supply the DC starting power the generator needs, 
so there are no failed batteries for the load power or the generator starting system. There is no 
battery charging or battery maintenance, so the environmental considerations are eliminated. 
Because no batteries are required, much less floor space is dedicated to this type of UPS.

The drawback of the system is that it is usually sized to provide load power for a short duration, 
just enough to get a traditional generator operating.
The installation of this system has the same parameters as a normal standby/UPS system 
but without the need for batteries.
SEPARATELY DERIVED SYSTEMS
Although separately derived systems are not alternative energy, they are a separate source of 
power that is derived within a customer’s premises. Separately derived systems sometimes 
cause confusion when you are dealing with the rules and regulations of the National Electrical 
Code. The term is meant to indicate that a new source of electrical power is now available at a 
premises. The source of power can be a transformer that is located within a building or on the 
property of the building owner and is not a utility transformer. It can be a generator that is used 
for emergency stand-by, or extra power that can be connected to the buildings electrical system.
A definition paraphrased from the NEC indicates that it is a premises wiring system whose 
power is derived from a source other than the electric service. The separately derived system 
shall have no direct (electrical) connection from the circuit conductors from one system to the 
circuit conductors of another system, including the neutral conductor. Only the connections 
that are permitted are the connections through the earth, metal enclosures, metal raceways, or 
equipment grounding conductors.
This definition determines the connections made and the requirements for grounding and 
bonding of the separate systems. The idea that a transformer within a building is actually a sepa-
rate source of power to the transformer’s load is the key to this concept. The power from the 
secondary of this transformer is derived from the primary but is through magnetic circuitry and 
not through electrical connections. Therefore, the secondary of the transformer has no electri-
cal references for phase or neutrals, as does the primary. It is a separate electrical system only 
linked through magnetics in the transformer. See Figure 15–13 for an isolation  transformer. 
A style of transformer connection that does not provide this isolation and is not a separately 
derived system is an autotransformer used to step up or step down a voltage for small varia-
tions. A transformer used to step a voltage from 208 to 
230 volts often uses a connection called a boost auto-
transformer. In this pattern, the circuit conductors, 
especially the grounded neutral conductor, is connected 
between the primary and the secondary, and therefore 
this does not fit the definition of a separately derived 
system. See Figure 15–14 for an autotransformer con-
nection. Once you have decided that the transformer 
is a separate system, then the secondary connections 
to feeders and branch circuits are treated in much the 
same way as a new service within the building.

Much of the treatment of the separately 
derived system is concentrated in the grounding 
and bonding requirements of the “derived” power 
system. NEC Article 250.28 refers to the main 
bonding jumper and the system bonding jumper. 
NEC Article 250.30 refers to the grounding require-
ments. This article states that the systems must 
comply with various parts of the article if they 
are to be grounded systems, and with other parts 
if they are to be ungrounded systems. Generally, 
the main bonding jumper and the system bonding 
jumpers are to be sized from Table 250.66 based on 
the size of the largest ungrounded conductor. (See 
Figure 15–15 for location of the bonding jumper.)

separate system as outlined in Article 250.30. One such provision is the application of a “supply-
side bonding jumper,” as detailed in 250.30(A)(2). This supply side refers to the secondary of 
the derived source. This is in fact the supply side of the new system that has its power source 
derived through the transformer. As is the case of a utility service feed, the system is grounded 
through a grounding electrode system. Here too for separately derived systems, the supply 
needs to be grounded to reestablish the ground point—for grounded systems. There are eight 
provisions in Article 250.30(A) for grounding these derived grounded systems in the NEC. 
There are three provisions in Article 250.30(B) for bonding and grounding separately derived 
systems that are to remain ungrounded. Article 250.32(B)(2) refers to buildings or structures 
that are supplied by feeders or branch circuits that are supplied by a separately derived system 
that is grounded. Article 250.32(C)(1–2) are used for separately derived systems that are sup-
plying an ungrounded system.
As noted earlier, an on-premises generator may be considered a separately derived system, 
depending on how it is connected to the existing system. An informational note under NEC 
Article 250.30 confirms that a generator that is connected to the service-supplied system that has a 
neutral or grounded conductor solidly 
connected from the generator is not 
considered a separately derived system 
because it does have a common circuit 
conductor between the original and 
the additional system. This would be 
the case if a three-phase generator were 
to be connected to a premises wiring 
system through a three-pole transfer 
switch. If that same generator were 
connected through a four-pole transfer 
switch, then the grounded conductor 
would not be solidly  connected, and 
the generator is a separately derived 
system. See Figure  15–16 for three-
pole and four-pole transfer switches. If 
the generator is not separately derived 
and is permanently installed, then 
Article 250.35(B) is used to determine 
grounding requirements. If the gen-
erator is really a separately derived 
system, then the same rules apply that 
were used for the transformer-supplied 
system. Article 250.34 is used if the gen-
erator is portable or vehicle mounted.

SUMMARY
Besides the usual sources of electrical power from the utility power grid, there are alternate 
sources for spot supply or remote supply of electricity. UPS battery systems and engine-driven 
generating sets were discussed in Unit 12, but other unique systems are now becoming more 
popular and are more cost effective than before. Each system has its own benefits and drawbacks, 
but each of these alternative systems other than microturbines, does not burn fossil fuels or  create 
the emission problems of other fuels. Nuclear fuel does not create the air pollution problems, but 
has a lot of other inherent problems. Hydroelectric generation has a different set of problems, 
such as it can only be produced with the correct topographical conditions. Because these alter-
native sources are small-scale production, they are typically for local use. However, wind power 
can be used for small-scale electrical generation or for large-scale utility grade generation and can 
be tied to the power grid to help meet the need for power production on a regional basis. Solar 
power is also a production technique that can be used for local small-scale production; it is cov-
ered by the NEC for premises wiring and is also being used as a large-scale production technique 
on solar farms.

Large amounts of alternating-current energy may be generated at a convenient voltage 
using steam, nuclear, winf or water power. Transformers are used first to increase this energy 
to a high voltage for transmission over many miles of transmission wires, and then to decrease 
this voltage to values that are conve-
nient and safe for use by the consumer.
ELEMENTS OF 
TRANSFORMERS
A transformer consists of two or 
more conductor windings placed on 
the same iron core magnetic path, as 
shown in Figure 17–2.
Laminated Core
The iron core of a transformer is made 
up of sheets of rolled iron. This iron is 
treated so that it has a high magnetic 
conducting quality (high permeabil-
ity) throughout the length of the core. 
It is neither efficient nor economically feasible to generate large quantities of direct-current 
electrical energy. The invention of the transformer was a milestone in the development of 
the electrical industry. The transformer increases or decreases the voltage of large quantities 
of alternating-current energy efficiently, safely, and conveniently. A large power distribution 
 station is shown in Figure 17–1.

Windings
A basic transformer has two windings: the primary winding and the secondary winding. The 
primary winding is the coil that receives the energy. It is formed, wound, and fitted over the iron 
core. The secondary winding is the coil that provides the energy from the transformer to the load 
at a transformed or changed (increased or decreased) voltage.
Transformers by definition are used to transfer (transform) energy from one AC system 
to another by electromagnetic means. They do not change the amount of power significantly; 
only minor wattage losses occur in the transformer. If the transformer increases the voltage 
from primary to secondary, it is called a step-up transformer. If it decreases the voltage from 
primary to secondary, it is called a step-down transformer. Some transformers do not change the 
voltage level but only isolate the primary power source from the secondary power source. This 
type of transformer is known as an isolation transformer.
The secondary voltage is dependent on the following:
• voltage of the primary
• number of turns of the transformer looped wire on the primary winding
• number of turns of the transformer looped wire on the secondary winding
Permeability describes the ease with which a material conducts magnetic lines of force. The 
iron also has a high ohmic resistance across the plates (through the thickness of the core). It is 
necessary to laminate the iron sheets (Figure 17–3) to reduce hysteresis and eddy currents that 
cause heating of the core.

Certain core-type transformers have the primary and secondary wire coils wound on sep-
arate legs of the core [see Figure 17–2(A)]. The primary and secondary wire coils can also be 
wound on top of one another, as shown in Figure 17–2(B). Winding in this manner improves 
transformer efficiency and conserves energy. When stating the transformer ratio, the primary is 
the first factor of the ratio. This indicates which winding, high or low, is connected to the power 
source. A transformer that has twice as many primary winding loops compared to the number 
of secondary windings has a 2:1 ratio.

As shown in Figure 17–4, three major types of construction for transformer cores are core, 
shell, and cross (or H).
Core Type
In a core transformer, the primary winding is on one leg of the transformer and the secondary 
winding is on the other leg. A more efficient type of core construction is the shell, in which the 
core is surrounded by a shell of iron [Figure 17–4(A) and (B)].

Shell Type
The shell or double-window core transformer [Figure 17–4(C)] is probably used most fre-
quently in electrical work. In terms of energy conservation, this transformer design operates at 
98% or higher efficiency.

Cross, or H, Type
The cross, or H, core is also called the modified shell type [Figure 17–4(D)]. The coils are sur-
rounded by four core legs. The cross type is really a combination of two shell cores set at right 
angles to each other. The windings are located over the center core, which is four times the area of 
each of the outside legs. This type of core is very compact and can be cooled easily. It is used for 
large power transformers where voltage drop and cost must be kept to a minimum. These units 
are usually immersed in oil for high-insulation properties and effective cooling. Another method 
of cooling the transformers is by forced air. Transformers should never be immersed in water 
for cooling. Accidental flooding, such as in underground transformer vaults, should be pumped.
ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF TRANSFORMER OPERATION
According to Lenz’s law, a voltage is induced in a coil whenever the coil current is increased or 
decreased. This induced voltage is always in such a direction as to oppose the force  producing 
it. Called induction, this action is illustrated by arranging two loops of wire, as shown in 
Figure 17–5.
Note in Figure 17–5 the progressive enlargement of the magnetic field about one side of 
each loop as the current builds up. The strength of the magnetic field increases as the electrical 
current through the conductor increases from the power source. Figure 17–5 also shows the 
field pattern during the period that the current decreases.

Figure 17–5 uses the left-hand rule for con-
ductors. Grasp the conductor in your left hand 
with your thumb extended in the direction of the 
electron flow. Your fingers indicate the direction 
of the magnetic flux. The flux expands outward 
from the conductor as the current flow increases, 
and contracts toward the conductor center as the 
current flow diminishes.
As the current builds up to its maximum value, 
the circular magnetic lines around the wire move 
outward from the wire. This outward movement of 
magnetic lines of force cuts across the conductor of 
the second loop. As a result, an EMF is induced and 
current circulates in the loop, as indicated on the 
galvanometer located above the conductor.
When the current reaches its steady state in 
the first circuit, the flux is stationary, and no volt-
age is induced in the circuit. The galvanometer 
indicates zero current.
When the battery circuit is opened, current 
falls to zero and the flux collapses. The collapsing 
flux cuts through the second circuit and again 
induces an EMF. The second induced current has a direction opposite to that of the first 
induced current, as indicated by the galvanometer needle. The final stage shows a steady state 
with no field and no induced current. This action is automatic with AC applied.
The loops of wire may be replaced by two concentric coils (loops with many turns) to 
form a transformer. Figure 17–6 shows a transformer that has a primary winding, an iron core, 
and a secondary winding. When a changing or alternating current is delivered to the primary 
winding, the changing primary current produces a changing magnetic field in the iron core. 
This changing field cuts through the secondary coil and thus induces a voltage; the value 
depends on the number of conductors in the secondary coil cut by the magnetic lines. This 
is called mutual inductance. Commercial transformers generally have fixed cores that provide 
complete magnetic circuits for efficient operation where there is little flux leakage and high 
mutual induction.
VOLTAGE RATIO
According to Lenz’s law, 1 volt is induced when 100,000,000 magnetic lines of force are cut 
in 1 second. The primary winding of a transformer supplies the magnetic field for the core.

induced voltage that is proportional to the number of conductors cut by the primary flux of 
the core.
The shell transformer type shown in Figure 17–6 is designed to reduce the voltage of the 
power supply. In Figure 17–6,
Np = number of turns in the primary winding
 
Ns = number of turns in the secondary winding
 
Ip = current in the primary winding
 
Is = current in the secondary winding
Assume that NP = 100 turns
 
         Ns = 50 turns
 
                     Esupply = 100 volts, 60 hertz
The alternating supply voltage (100 V) produces a current in the primary that mag-
netizes the core with an alternating flux. (According to Lenz’s law, a counter EMF is 
induced in the primary winding. This counter EMF is called self-inductance and opposes 
the impressed voltage.) Because the secondary winding is on the same core as the primary 
winding, only 50 volts is induced in the secondary, as only half as many conductors are cut 
by the magnetic field.

The ratio of 2 to 1 indicates that the transformer is a step-down transformer that reduces 
the voltage of the power supply. Transformers either step up or step down the supply voltage.
Refer to Figure 17–7 for the following example. The primary winding of a transformer 
has 100 turns, and the secondary has 400 turns. An EMF of 120 volts is applied to the primary.

CURRENT RATIO
The current ratio in a transformer is the inverse of the ratio for voltage transformation. The 
transformer does not create power and is not designed to consume power. The input power 
should be very close to the output power. Therefore, if the volt-amps input equals the volt-
amps output and the voltage level must be increased, the current level must be decreased. The 
voltage ratio and the current ratio are inversely proportional.
If the load current of the transformer shown in Figure 17–7 is 12 amperes, the primary 
current must be such that the product of the number of turns and the value of the current 
(ampere-turns primary) equals the value of the ampere-turns secondary.

Check of Solution for Current
Ep × Ip = Es × Is ; 120 V × 48 A = 5670 VA ; 480 V × 12 A = 5670 VA
The current ratio is an inverse ratio; that is, the greater the number of turns, the less 
the current for a given load. Practical estimates of primary or secondary currents are made by 
assuming that transformers are 100% efficient.
For example, assume that
VA input = VA output
 
or
  Primary volt-amps = Secondary volt-amps
 
or

The greater the current, the larger the size of the wire leads on the transformer. From this 
information, you can usually determine the high- and low-voltage sides.
Higher voltage = lower current, and therefore smaller wire size
Lower voltage = higher current, and therefore larger wire size
● Example:  A machine tool being relocated has a disconnected control transformer. The 
nameplate is illegible due to corrosion. The motor power circuit is 480 volts. 
The motor controller operates on 120 volts of control. Which is the primary 
and secondary of the control transformer? The higher voltage has the smaller 
wire size. Therefore, the smaller wire leads are to be connected to the 480 volts.
The use of an ohmmeter can also tell you which winding has the greater resistance. By 
measuring each winding, you find that the greater the resistance, the higher the voltage connec-
tion, because it has more turns of smaller wire. Remember, primary refers to the supply side of 
the transformer. Secondary refers to the load side (Figure 17–8).

SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OR SYMBOL
A step-up transformer is usually shown in schematic form, as illustrated in Figure 17–8. The 
ratio of turns, primary to secondary, is not usually listed. This figure could be a step-up or step-
down symbol representation.
PRIMARY LOADING WITH SECONDARY LOADING
The current in the secondary controls the current in the primary. When the secondary circuit 
is complete by placing a load across it, the secondary EMF causes a current to flow. This builds 
up a magnetic field in opposition to the primary field. This opposing, or demagnetizing, action 
reduces the effective field of the primary flux, which in turn reduces the primary CEMF, thereby 
permitting current to flow in the primary. The greater the current flow in the secondary, the 
greater the field produced by the secondary. This results in a reduced primary field; hence, a 
reduced primary CEMF is produced. This condition permits greater current flow in the pri-
mary. This entire process repeats itself whenever there is any change in the value of the current 
in the secondary circuit. A transformer adjusts itself readily to any normal change in secondary 
load. However, if a direct short is placed across the secondary, the abnormally large amount of 
current flowing causes the primary current to rise in a like manner, resulting in damage to, or 
complete burn-out of, the transformer if it is not protected properly.

In general, transformer efficiency is about 97%. Only 3% of the total wattage at the 
 secondary winding is lost through the transformation. The loss in wattage is due to core losses 
and copper losses.
The core loss is the result of hysteresis (magnetic friction) and eddy currents (induced 
currents) in the iron core.
The copper loss is power lost in the copper wire of the windings (I2R). Therefore, taking 
these losses into consideration,

SUMMARY
Transformers are very useful in delivering the exact voltage needed by customers. DC cannot be 
easily changed from one voltage level to another. There are no true DC transformers. AC can 
be increased or decreased easily through the electromagnetic coupling of the transformer coils. 
Transformers can be used to (1) step up the voltage, (2) step down the voltage, or (3) simply 
isolate the transformer primary system from the transformer secondary system.

A single-phase transformer usually has a core and at least two coils. The single-phase auto-
transformer has only one coil. The specifications for single-phase transformers vary greatly, and 
the applications of these transformers are unlimited.
THE DOUBLE-WOUND TRANSFORMER (ISOLATING 
AND INSULATING)
The double-wound transformer has a primary winding and a secondary winding. These wind-
ings are independently isolated and insulated from each other. A shielded winding transformer, on 
the other hand, is designed with a metallic shield between the primary and secondary windings, 
providing a safety factor by grounding. This prevents accidental contact between the windings 
under fault conditions. The illustrations in Unit 17 show a double-wound transformer. The coils 
of double-wound transformers may be connected in several different arrangements.
Figure 18–1 shows popular arrangements of single-phase transformer windings. Shown 
in Figure 18–1(A), two single coils are used for specific step-down or step-up applications, 
including bell-ringing transformers, neon transformers, and component transformers for com-
mercial equipment, such as automatic machines, switchgear, and other devices. Multiple coil 
primary and secondary windings, shown in Figure 18–1(B), are used in distribution transform-
ers where dual voltage ratings are desired. Arrangements for voltage ratings of 2400//120/240 
or 240/480//120/240 are common.

Double-wound transformers separate or insulate the high transmission voltages from the 
typical consumer voltages of 115/230/460. The NEC requires this type of transformer in all 
distribution circuits except those circuits assigned to autotransformers. Here, as in the Code, 
the voltage considered shall be that at which the circuit operates, except for the examples given.
Polarity
A 460/115/230 transformer may be connected for two ratios: 460/115 or 460/230. To 
obtain the 460/115 ratio, the secondary coils are connected in parallel; the 460/230 ratio

is achieved by connecting the secondary coils in series. To complete these connections, the 
polarity of the leads must be determined.
Figure 18–2 shows how the transformer secondary series and parallel coil connections are 
made. Note that instead of polarity indications such as (+, −), the coil leads are identified here 
by S (start) and F (finish), or by 1 (start) and 2 (finish), as in H1, H2, X1, and X2 in Figure 18–3.

The beginning or ending of a transformer coil is usually indicated by a tab placed on the 
lead by the technician in charge of the winding process. When the transformer is assembled, 
other markings often replace the original ones. Before final inspection, a polarity test must be 
made to be certain that the leads are marked correctly.
IDENTIFYING AN UNMARKED TRANSFORMER
Installed transformers often have missing or disfigured tabs. Every time a transformer is to be 
reconnected following repairs or for other reasons, the polarity of the leads must be checked.
Figures 18–3 and 18–4 illustrate two systems of marking polarity. In conventional usage, 
polarity refers to the induced voltage vector relationships of the transformer leads as they are 
brought outside of the tank. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standardized 
the location of these leads to obtain additive and subtractive polarity conditions. All high-
voltage leads brought outside the case are marked H1, H2, and so forth, whereas the low-voltage 
leads are marked X1 and X2. The H1 lead is located on the left side when facing the low-voltage 
leads. H1 and X1 have the same electrical polarity at the same instant of time.
Subtractive Polarity. The tank diagram in Figure 18–3 shows the relationship of the 
induced voltages in the primary and secondary windings for the subtractive polarity condition. 
Transformers connected in this manner have the H1 and X1 leads located directly opposite 
each other. If H1 and X1 are connected together [as shown in Figure 18–5(A)], the voltage 
measured between H2 and X2 is less than the primary voltage. The induced voltage opposes

the supply voltage and thus causes the secondary induced voltage to be subtracted from the 
primary voltage.
Additive Polarity. The tank diagram in Figure 18–4 shows the voltage relationship of 
the induced voltages for the additive polarity connection. When H1 and X2 are connected, the 
voltage across H2 and X1 is greater than the primary voltage. The measured voltages add up to 
the sum of the primary and secondary voltages, as shown in Figure 18–5(B).
Transformers that are rated up to 200 kVA (kilovolt-amperes) and have the value of 
the high-voltage winding equal to 8660 volts or less are additive. All other transformers are 
subtractive.
Test for P olarity. Transformer coils often must be connected in series or parallel, as 
in Figure 18–6. For these situations, the polarity of a transformer or any secondary coil can 
be found by making the connections shown in Figure 18–5(A) and (B). Connect the adja-
cent left, high- and low-voltage outlet leads facing the low-voltage side of the transformer.

Apply a low-voltage supply to the primary and note the voltage between the adjacent right-
hand, high- and low-voltage terminals.
• For subtractive polarity, the voltmeter reading (V) is less than the applied voltage. 
The voltage is the difference between the primary and secondary voltages, Ep − Es 
[Figure 18–5(A)].
• For additive polarity, the voltmeter reading (V) is greater than the applied voltage. The 
voltage is the sum of the primary and secondary voltages, Ep + Es [Figure 18–5(B)].
If the test shown in Figure 18–5(B) indicates additive polarity, the secondary leads inside 
the tank must be reversed at the bottom of the bushings to obtain a true subtractive polarity. 
If the transformer requires all additive polarity and the test indicates subtractive, reverse the 
secondary lead markers so that X2 is located opposite H1.

In all transformers, the H terminals are always the high-voltage terminals. The X termi-
nals are always the low-voltage terminals. Either the H or X terminals can be designated as the 
primary or the secondary, depending on which is the source and which is the load and whether 
the transformer is used as a step-up or step-down transformer.
SINGLE-PHASE TRANSFORMER CONNECTIONS
Series Connection
If a 460/115/230-volt, single-phase transformer is to be connected to obtain 460/230 volts, the 
two secondary coils must be connected in series. The beginning and ending of each coil must be 
joined, as shown in Figure 18–6(A). The “start” of each coil is identified by an odd-numbered 
subscript.
Note: If the voltage is zero across X1−X4 after the series connections are complete, the 
coils are opposing each other (the polarity of one coil is reversed). To correct this situation, 
reverse one coil, and then reconnect and recheck the polarity.
Parallel Connection
To obtain 460/115 volts, the two secondary coils must be connected in parallel, as shown in 
Figure 18–6(B). The polarity of each coil must be correct before making this connection. The 
parallel connection of two coils of opposite polarity results in a short circuit and internal dam-
age to the transformer.

Note: An indirect polarity check can be made by completing the series connection and 
noting the total voltage. As noted previously, zero voltage indicates opposite polarities. Reverse 
one coil to remedy the condition and then recheck overall polarity. Retag leads if necessary.
PARALLEL OPERATION OF SINGLE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS
Single-phase distribution transformers can be connected in parallel only if the voltage and 
percent impedance ratings of the transformers are identical. This information is found on the 
nameplates of large transformers. It is recommended that this rule be followed when making 
permanent parallel connections of all transformers.
TRANSFORMER PRIMARY TAPS
Taps are nothing more than alternative terminals that can be connected to more closely match 
the primary supply voltage. These taps are arranged in increments of 2.5% or 5% of the primary 
nominal voltage rating of the transformer (Figure 18–7). This provides a job-site adjustment to 
ensure that the transformer primary matches the supply voltage. The secondary then produces 
the desired secondary voltage.

The voltage received from the power utility may be low or high. Because the transformer 
is a fixed voltage device, the output voltage is always in direct proportion to the input voltage. If 
the ratio is 2:1 and the supply voltage is 480 volts, the output is 240 volts. If the primary voltage 
is 438 volts, the secondary is only 219 volts.
High and low voltages can have serious effects on different connected loads. Therefore, 
care must be taken to deliver a voltage as close as possible to the desired primary so that the 
 secondary voltage matches the equipment nameplate voltages. Consistently high and low

 voltage problems can be solved by connecting the proper primary taps (Figure 18–8). If the 
voltage fluctuates consistently, tap changing is not the solution. A voltage-regulating trans-
former is needed.
REGULATION
A slight voltage drop at the secondary terminals from no load to full load, called regulation, is 
caused by resistance and reactance drops in the windings. Regulation is expressed as a percentage. 
Regulation of constant potential transformers is about 1–5% at the secondary terminals, as follows:
=
× 100  
full load E
no load E − full load E
% E regulation
● Example:  The secondary voltage of a transformer rises from 220 to 228 volts when the 
rated load is removed. What is the regulation of the transformer?

AUTOTRANSFORMER
Transformers with only one winding are called autotransformers. In an autotransformer, a part 
of the winding is common to both primary and secondary circuits. This is the most efficient 
type of transformer because a portion of one winding carries the difference between the 
primary and secondary currents. Figure 18–9 shows the current distribution in an autotrans-
former used in a typical lighting application. The disadvantage of an autotransformer is the fact 
that the use of only one winding makes it impossible to insulate the low-voltage section from 
the high-voltage distribution line. If the low-voltage winding opens when stepping down the 
voltage, the full-line voltage appears across the load. Autotransformers are used in some motor 
starters to reduce current draw from the line. See Figure 18–10 for an autotransformer motor 
starter.

According to the 2011 National Electrical Code® Article 450, autotransformers rated 
at 600 volts or less shall have an individual overcurrent device connected in series with the 
ungrounded input conductor. If the primary current is less than 9 amps, the overcurrent rating 
shall not be more than 125% of the rated primary current. If the primary current is 9 amps or 
more, the overcurrent value can be the next standard larger size over 125%. An overcurrent 
device shall not be installed in series with the shunt winding (common winding to primary 
and secondary), with one exception noted.

DRY AND LIQUID-FILLED TRANSFORMERS
Dry transformers are used extensively for indoor installations. These transformers are cooled 
by air and are not encased in heavy tanks such as those required for liquid-filled transformers. 
Dry transformers are used for bell-ringing circuits, current and potential transformers, welding 
transformers, and almost all transformers used on portable or small industrial equipment, or for 
separately derived systems within a facility.
Liquid-filled transformers consist of the core and coils immersed in a tank of oil or other 
insulating liquid. Oil cooling is approximately 15 times more effective than air cooling. Many 
distribution transformers designed for outdoor installation are liquid filled.
METHODS OF COOLING
The method selected to cool a transformer must not only maintain a sufficiently low average 
temperature but must also prevent an excessive temperature rise in any portion of the trans-
formers. In other words, the cooling medium must prevent the formation of “hot spots.” For this 
FIGURE 18–10 Autotransformer used for 
motor-starting duty.

reason, the working parts of the transformer are usually immersed in a high grade of insulating 
oil. Because the oil must be free of any moisture, the oil must be filtered to remove moisture as 
necessary. The electrical insulating value of the oil is checked periodically.
Duct lines are arranged within the transformer to provide for the free circulation of oil 
through the core and coils. The warmer and thus lighter oil rises to the top of the steel tank. 
The transformer core and windings are placed near the bottom of the tank. The cooler and 
heavier oil settles to the bottom of the tank. This natural circulation provides for better cooling 
(Figure 18–11).
FIGURE 18–11 An oil-filled power transformer with radiators.
© Cengage Learning 2014
Forced Cooling
Several methods of removing heat from a transformer involve forced cooling. Cooling is 
achieved by using pumps to force the circulation of the oil or liquid by forcing the circulation 
of air past the oil-filled radiators (Figure 18–12) or by immersing water-containing coils in the 
oil. Cold water circulating in the coils removes the heat stored in the oil. Figure 18–13 shows 
internal construction of an oil-filled transformer. Forced air movement by the use of fans is a 
common practice. Fans are generally controlled by thermostats (Figure 18–14).

APPLICATION
Single-phase transformers are suitable for use in a wide variety of applications, as shown by the 
examples in Figures 18–15, 18–16, 18–17, and 18–18.
Distribution transformers are usually oil filled and mounted on poles, in vaults, or in 
manholes.
Compensator starters are tapped autotransformers used for starting induction motors.
Instrument transformers, such as potential and current transformers, are made in indoor, 
outdoor, and portable styles used for metering.
Welding transformers provide a very low voltage to arc welding electrodes. Movable 
 secondaries provide the varying voltage and current characteristics required.
Constant-current transformers are used for series street lighting where the current must be 
held constant with a varying voltage. The secondary is movable.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Although there are no moving parts in a transformer, some maintenance procedures must be 
performed. For a general overhaul of an operating transformer or when an internal inspection 
is to be made, the transformer must be deenergized. Do not assume that the transformer is 
 disconnected or rely on someone else to disconnect it; always check the transformer yourself. 
You must be sure that the fuses are pulled open or out and that the switch or circuit breaker is 
open on both the primary and secondary sides. After the transformer is disconnected, the wind-
ings should be grounded to discharge any capacitive energy stored in the equipment. This step 
also protects you while you are at work. Grounding is accomplished with a device commonly 
known as a “short and ground.” This is a flexible cable with clamps on both ends. The ground 
end is clamped first, and then, using a hook stick, the other end is touched to the conductor. 
Do this with each leg on the primary and secondary sides. The phases are then shorted together 
and grounded for your protection.
The tank pressure should be relieved. This may be done by bleeding a valve or plug above 
the oil level. Any gas in the tank must be replaced with fresh air before a person enters the tank. 
The absence of oxygen in a tank causes asphyxiation quickly and without warning. A second 
person should be on duty outside the transformer as a safety precaution whenever someone 
must enter the transformer. Be sure to follow Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) rules on hazardous entry and restricted work space. All tools should have safety 
cords attached, with the other end tightly secured. All pockets in clothing should be emptied. 
Nothing must be allowed to fall into the tank. Great care must be exercised to prevent contact-
ing or coming close to the electrical conductors and other live parts of the transformer unless 
it is known that the transformer has been deenergized. The tank and cooling radiators should 
not be touched until it is determined that they are adequately grounded (for both new and old 
installations).
SUMMARY
Single-phase transformers are used in a variety of applications. To connect them correctly, the 
electrician must know how the AC polarities are established at the transformer leads. Because 
the internal windings of the transformer are often not accessible, polarity checks must be made 
on the external leads. The transformer leads are marked according to the standards for additive 
or subtractive polarity. If the lead markings are not apparent or the voltages expected are not 
obtained, then the polarity must be tested. If the lead markings are known, the transformer coils 
may be connected in series or parallel to yield the desired voltage. Autotransformer connections 
or tap-changing transformers may be used to bring the voltage within the desired range. Much 
of a transformer’s capability to operate satisfactorily depends on the capability to dissipate the 
heat produced in the windings. Many methods are used to dissipate this heat and keep the trans-
former from overheating and being destroyed.

Most homes are wired for three-wire service. Because electric ranges and clothes dryers 
are designed for three-wire operation, any home to be provided with these appliances must 
have three-wire service. The three wires terminate in the residence at the load center panel so 
that most individual circuits carried through the house are at 120 volts, thus eliminating the 
dangers with 240-volt circuits.
The double-wound transformer is used as the source for three-wire secondary distribu-
tion. One of the important advantages of a transformer is its capability to provide a three-wire 
circuit from the low-voltage secondary. A step-down transformer with a 2400/240/120-volt 
rating is commonly used in residential installations.
The advantages of using three-wire service in general distribution systems include (1) a 
reduction in the cost of main feeders and subfeeders, (2) the provision of 120-volt service for 
normal lighting circuits and 240-volt service for power and motor loads, and (3) the conserva-
tion of electrical energy by reducing wattage loss in transmission.
Figure 19–1 is a schematic of a typical three-wire system. The secondary coils are connected 
in series, and each coil is rated at 120 volts. The junction N between the two secondary coils is 
usually grounded. This precaution provides some protection to a person who may come into 
contact accidentally with a transformer that has faulty insulation. The line wire carried from this 
junction (N) to the several loads is known as the neutral or grounded conductor. The neutral wire 
generally carries less current than wires L1 and L2, except when the load is on one side only, that 
is, L1 to N or L2 to N. The 240-volt motor load does not affect the current flowing in the neutral 
wire. The neutral is carried through the system as an unfused or switched conductor. If the neutral 
opens, and the loads in the 120-volt circuits are greatly unbalanced, then these 120-volt circuits 
are subjected to approximately 240 volts. The neutral is designed to carry not only the unbalanced 
current in the two 120-volt circuits, but also the entire load on any one side should all the load 
on the other side be cut off completely. This latter situation can occur if a fuse or circuit breaker 
suddenly opens either line. Figure 19–1 shows the current distribution for the loads indicated.

OPEN NEUTRAL
As an example to show what occurs when the neutral of a three-wire system opens, assume that 
the lighting load in Figure 19–1 is a pure resistive load.
Thus, the group of four lamps has a resistance of  
=
= 4.8 ohms,

 and the group 
of two lamps has a resistance of  
=
= 8 ohms.

With the neutral open, these two groups combine as a series circuit with a resistance of 
12.8 ohms connected across 240 volts. The current flow through this series circuit follows:
=
= 18.75 amperes

Then, according to the laws for a series circuit, the voltage across the 8-ohm group (two 
lamps) is equal to
I × R = 18.75 × 8 = 150 volts
and the voltage across the 4.6-ohm group (four lamps) is equal to
I × R = 18.75 × 4.8 = 90 volts
(Remember that in a series circuit, the highest voltage appears across the highest value of 
resistance.) The two lamps would probably burn out with this open neutral.
Sample Problem
Referring to Figure 19–1, assume that the upper 120-volt load is 25 amperes, the lower load 
is 15 amperes, and the motor load is 30 amperes. If the power factor in all cases is unity (1), 
calculate the current
 
1. in line 1a,
 
2. in line 2b, and
 
3. in the neutral line N.
In addition, determine the power delivered
 
4. by transformer coil 1N,
 
5. by transformer coil 2N, and
 
6. by the primary coil.
Finally, calculate the current
 
7. in the primary coil.

The distribution transformers used in industrial plants or network substations for three-
wire secondary systems are usually mounted on poles (Figure 19–2) or in transformer vaults. 
This type of transformer is equipped with three low-voltage bushings and the series connection 
is made inside the tank. The lower lines constitute the secondary three-wire systems.

ECONOMICS OF THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM 
FOR FEEDERS AND BRANCH CIRCUITS
Using the three-wire system of the previous problem as an example, the total load transmitted 
over the three wires is 1500 W, or 1.5 kW, at a power factor of 100%. It is assumed that the 
motor load is provided with power factor correction. If single conductor-type TW wire is used 
from the transformer to the load, the following sizes are required:
Line 1 (55 amperes): No. 6 TW
Neutral (0.70 × 55 = 38.5): No. 8 TW
Line 2 (55 amperes): No. 6 TW
Although No. 8 TW wire is the actual size permitted for the neutral, a substitution of a 
No. 6 TW wire can be made so that three 6 lines are provided to simplify the installation.
If a two-wire distribution system is used for the same load, the total current is 
11,500/120  = 96 amperes. Two AWG 1 lines are required. If the transmission distance is 
100 feet, then a comparison can be made of the weights of copper wire required for the two 
systems.
Three-Wire System
For a No. 6 TW line, the weight per 100 feet = 11.5 lb. Therefore, for three No. 6 TW lines, 
the total weight = 3 × 11.5 = 34.5 lb.
Two-Wire System
For a TW 1 line, the weight per 100 feet = 33 lb. For two 1 lines, the total weight = 2 × 33 = 
66 lb. Therefore, for the same load, the three-wire system uses less copper (66 − 34.5 = 
31.5 lb less) than the two-wire system.
A similar conclusion can be reached by consulting a manufacturer’s price list and noting 
the lower prices for smaller conductors. The copper losses in the line are also considerably less 
for a three-wire system for several reasons: the motor power is transmitted at a higher voltage 
requiring less current for a given load; the neutral carries no current when the two lighting 
circuits are balanced; and the copper losses are much less because less wire and current are 
required. These line losses are of two types: (1) voltage drop (IR) and (2) wattage loss (I2R).
SUMMARY
The three-wire, single-phase system is the most common residential electrical service. The 
three wires constitute a single phase of AC delivered to the home. The transformer secondary 
coil is tapped at the center point and grounded at that point to establish a ground reference. 
The power can then be divided into two 120-volt supplies and can also be used as a 240-volt 
single phase for higher power consumption appliances. Care must be taken to solidly ground 
the neutral center-tapped point because an open neutral conductor can cause severe damage.

Most electrical energy is generated by three-phase, alternating-current generators. Three-
phase systems are used to transmit and distribute the generated electrical energy. The voltage 
on three-phase systems often must be transformed, either from a higher value to a lower value 
or from a lower value to a higher value.
Voltage transformation on three-phase systems can be obtained with the use of three 
single-phase transformers (Figure 20–1). These transformers can be connected in several ways 
to obtain the desired voltage values.
A possible connection pattern that the electrician is often required to use for the three 
single-phase transformers is the closed-delta connection.
Another connection pattern that is commonly used is the open-delta, or V, connection 
that requires only two transformers to transform voltage on a three-phase system.
CLOSED-DELTA CONNECTION
When three single-phase coils are connected so that each coil end is connected to the beginning 
of another coil, a simple closed-delta system is formed (Figure 20–2).

When the three coils are marked Coil A, Coil B, and Coil C, the end of each of the three 
coils is marked with the letter O. The beginnings of the coils are marked A, B, and C. Note that 
each coil end is connected to another coil beginning. Each of the three junction points ties to a 
line lead feeding a three-phase system.
If three single-phase transformers are to be used to step down 2400 volts, three phase to 
240 volts, three phase, a closed-delta connection is used. Each of the three transformers is rated 
at 2400 volts on the high-voltage side and 240 volts on the low-voltage side (Figure 20–3).

CONNECTING THE DELTA
The transformer leads on the high-voltage side of each single-phase transformer are marked 
H1 and H2. The leads on the low-voltage side of each single-phase transformer are marked X1 
and X2.
To connect the high-voltage primary windings in the closed-delta pattern to a three-phase 
source, the three windings are connected as follows: In making the connection, the end of one

primary winding is connected to the beginning of the next primary winding. In Figure 20–3, H1 
is the beginning of each coil and H2 is the end of each coil. Thus, each primary winding end H2 
is connected to the beginning H1 of another primary winding. A three-phase line wire is also 
connected at each junction point H1–H2. Note that the primary winding of each transformer is 
connected directly across the line voltage. This means that delta-connected transformers must 
be wound for the full-line voltage. In Figure 20–3, each of the three line voltages is 2400 volts, 
and the primary winding of each transformer is also rated at 2400 volts. After the high-voltage 
primary connections are made, the three-phase, 2400-volt input may be energized. It is not 
necessary to make polarity tests on the input side.
The next step is to connect the low-voltage output or secondary windings in the closed-
delta pattern. The secondary winding leads are marked X1 for the beginning of each coil and X2 
for the end of each coil. In making the connections on the secondary, the following procedure 
must be followed:
 
1. Check to see that the voltage output of each of the three transformers is 240 volts.
 
2.  With primary power off, connect the end of one secondary winding with the 
beginning of another secondary winding (Figure 20–4).

When you reapply the primary power, the voltage across the open ends shown in 
Figure 20–4 should be the same as the output of each transformer, or 240 volts. If one of the 
transformers has its secondary winding connections reversed, the voltage across the open ends 
is 1.73 × 240 = 415 volts.
Figure 20–5 illustrates an incorrect connection that must be changed so that it is the same 
as the connection shown in Figure 20–4.

Figure 20–6 illustrates the correct connections for the secondary coil of the third trans-
former. The voltage across the last two open ends should be zero if all the transformers are 
connected as shown. If the voltage is zero across the last two open ends, they may be connected 
together. A line lead is then connected at each of the three junction points X1−X2. These three 
wires are the 240-volt, three-phase output. Note that each of the three line voltages and each of 
the three transformer output voltages is equal to 240 volts.

When the secondary winding of the third transformer is reversed, the voltage across the 
last two open leads would be 240 + 240 = 480 volts.
Figure 20–7 illustrates the incorrect connection that results in a reading of 480 volts. The 
connections on the third transformer secondary must be reversed.

Caution: Never complete the last connection if there is a voltage difference greater than 
zero. If the connections are correct, this potential difference is zero. Observe safety precautions. 
Deenergize the primary while making connections.
When three transformers are connected with their primary windings in delta and their 
secondary windings in delta, the total connection is called a delta-delta (Δ-Δ) connection. The 
first delta symbol indicates the connection method of the primary windings, and the second 
delta symbol shows how the secondary windings are connected. When two or three single-
phase transformers are used to step down or step up voltage on a three-phase system, the group 
is called a transformer bank.
Figure 20–8 is another way of showing the closed-delta connection first illustrated in 
Figure 20–3. By tracing through the connection, it can be seen that the high-voltage and low-
voltage windings are all connected in the closed-delta pattern. This type of transformer diagram 
is often used by the electrician.
VOLTAGE AND CURRENT
In any closed-delta transformer connection, two important facts must be kept in mind.
• The line voltage and the voltage across the transformer windings are the same. 
A study of any delta connection shows that each transformer coil is connected directly 
across two line leads; therefore, the line voltage and the transformer coil voltage must 
be the same.
• The line current is greater than the coil current in a delta-connected transformer bank. 
The line current is equal to 1.73 × coil current. A study of a closed-delta transformer 
connection shows that each line lead is fed by two transformer coil currents that are out 
of phase and thus cannot be added directly by simple arithmetic.

In the arrangement shown in Figure 20–9, the coil current in each transformer second-
ary is 10 amperes. The line current, however, is 1.73 × 10, or 17.3 amperes. Because the coil 
currents are out of phase, the total current is not 10 + 10, or 20, amperes. Rather, the total 
current is a resultant current in a balanced closed-delta system and is equal to 1.73 × coil cur-
rent (1.73 equals the square root of 3).
Three single-phase transformers of the same kVA capacity are used in almost all delta-
delta connected transformer banks used to supply balanced three-phase industrial loads. For 
example, if the industrial load consists of three-phase motors, the current in each line wire is 
balanced. To determine the total kVA capacity of the entire delta-delta connected transformer 
bank, add the three transformer kVA ratings. Thus, if each transformer is rated at 50 kVA, the 
total three-phase kVA is 50 + 50 + 50 = 150 kVA.

POWER AND LIGHTING SERVICE FROM A DELTA-DELTA 
CONNECTED TRANSFORMER BANK
A delta-delta connected transformer bank, with one transformer secondary center tapped, may 
be used to feed two types of load: (1) a 240-volt, three-phase industrial power load and (2) a 
120/240-volt, single-phase, three-wire lighting load.
The single-phase transformer that is to supply the single-phase, three-wire lighting load 
is usually larger in size than the other two transformers in the bank. This takes care of the 
additional lighting load placed here. A tap must be brought out from the midpoint of the 240-
volt, low-voltage winding so that the 120/240-volt, single-phase, three-wire service can be 
obtained. Many transformers are designed with the low-voltage side consisting of two 120-volt 
windings. These windings can be connected in series for 240 volts, in parallel for 120 volts, or 
in series and center tapped, with the tap brought out to give 120/240-volt, three-wire, single-
phase power.
Figure 20–10 illustrates three single-phase transformers connected as a delta-delta trans-
former bank. Each transformer has two 120-volt, low-voltage windings. These 120-volt wind-
ings are connected in series to give a total output voltage of 240 volts for each transformer. 
The connection scheme for the high-voltage input or primary windings is closed delta. The 
low-voltage output or secondary windings are also connected in the closed-delta pattern to

give three-phase, 240-volt service for the industrial power load. Note in Figure 20–10 that the 
middle transformer is feeding the single-phase, three-wire, 120/240-volt lighting load. This 
center transformer has a middle tap on the secondary (output) side to give 120/240-volt ser-
vice. Also note that this tap feeds to the grounded neutral wire. Figure 20–11 shows a one-line 
diagram representation.
The three-phase, 240-volt industrial power system is also connected to the transformer 
bank shown in Figure 20–11. A check of the connections shows that both lines A and C of 
the three-phase, 240-volt system have 120 volts to ground. Line B, however, has 208 volts to 
ground (120 × 1.73 = 208). This situation is called the high phase, or the NEC refers to this 
conductor as the phase with the higher voltage to ground.
Article 110.15 of the NEC requires that the phase be marked orange in color. Article 
408.3(E) requires that the B phase be designated as the phase with the higher voltage to ground 
and be placed in the middle in a switchboard or panelboard unless this is an addition to an exist-
ing installation with other arrangements.

Caution: The high-phase situation can be a serious hazard to human life as well as to 
any 120-volt equipment connected improperly between the high phase and neutral. See NEC 
Article 408.3(F) for marking a panel with a high leg.
Note that for ungrounded circuits, the greatest voltage between the given conductor and 
any other conductor of the circuit is considered the voltage to ground.
OPEN-DELTA, OR V, CONNECTION
A three-phase transformation of energy is possible using only two transformers. This con-
nection arrangement is called the open-delta, or V, connection. The open-delta connection is 
often used in an emergency when one of the three transformers in a delta-delta bank becomes 
defective. When it is imperative that a consumer’s three-phase power supply be restored as 
soon as possible, the defective transformer can be cut out of service, using the open-delta 
arrangement.
The following example shows how the open-delta connection can be used in an emer-
gency. Three 50 kVA transformers, each rated at 2400 volts on the high-voltage winding and 
240 volts on the low-voltage winding, are connected in a delta-delta bank (Figure 20–12). 
This closed-delta bank is used to step down a 2400-volt, three-phase input to a 240-volt, three-
phase output to supply an industrial consumer. Suddenly, the three-phase power service is 
 interrupted because lightning strikes and damages one of the transformers. The service must 
be restored immediately. This situation is shown in Figure 20–13.

Transformer 3 is the defective 
transformer. If all the leads of the dam-
aged transformer are disconnected, 
the closed-delta bank automatically 
becomes an open-delta transformer 
bank.
The schematic diagram of this 
open-delta connection is shown in 
Figure 20–14. Note that with the one 
transformer removed, the triangular 
coil arrangement is open on one side. 
Because the schematic diagram resem-
bles the letter V, this arrangement is 
also called the V connection.
Although it appears that the 
total kVA of the open-delta bank 
should be two-thirds that of a closed-
delta bank, the actual kVA rating of 
an open-delta bank is only 58% of the 
capacity of a closed-delta bank. The 
reason for this is that the currents of 
the two transformers in the open-
delta connection are out of phase, 
resulting in the total available capac-
ity of the open-delta bank being only 
58% instead of 66.7%.
In the open-delta example, three 
50 kVA transformers are connected in 
a delta-delta bank. This gives a total kVA capacity of 50 + 50 + 50 = 150 kVA for the closed-
delta bank. When one transformer is disconnected, the transformer bank changes to an open-
delta configuration, and the total kVA capacity now is only 58% of the original closed-delta 
capacity.
150 × 0.58 = 87 kVA
In some situations, an open-delta bank of transformers is installed initially. The third 
transformer is added when the increase in industrial power load on the transformer bank war-
rants the addition. When the third transformer is added to the bank, a closed-delta bank is 
formed.

When two transformers are installed in an open-delta configuration, the total bank capac-
ity can be found by the use of the following procedure:
 
1. Add the two individual transformer kVA ratings. (For the problem given, the 
single-phase transformers are rated at 50 kVA.)
50 + 50 = 100 kVA

2. Multiply the total kVA value by 86.5%. This gives the total kVA capacity of the 
open-delta transformer bank.
100 × 86.5% = 87 kVA
Therefore, an open-delta bank has a kVA capacity of 58% of the capacity of a closed-
delta bank: 150 KVA × .58 is the same total KVA as 865 × 100 KVA. Both calculations yield 
approximately 87 KVA.
Another way to explain the reduced percentages of output kVA is to use the rated voltages 
and currents. In an open-delta pattern, there is no vector addition of the current at the junc-
tion point; the line current is equal to the coil current. Just as in the closed-delta pattern, the 
open-delta voltage at the lines is the same as the coil voltages. The results can be seen in the 
following example: If each of the transformers are rated at 50 kVA and the secondary voltages 
are 240 volts, then the coil current of each transformer is 50,000/240 = 208 A. In an open-
delta pattern, Line I equals Coil I and Line E equals Coil E. The three-phase capacity of two 
transformers connected open delta is
Line E × Line I × 1.73 = 86.5 kVA
240 V × 208 A × 1.73 = ~ 86.5 kVA
This is the same as 86.55% of the two kVA added. This is also the same as 58% of the original 
150 kVA or 1.73 times the single 50 kVA.
THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS WITH PRIMARY TAPS
Some plant distribution transformers are preassembled and wired at the factory into a three-
phase bank in a single enclosure or as a single unit. These assemblies consist of three single-
phase transformers in one enclosure, usually the dry, air-cooled type. Some have primary tap 
terminals so that the supply voltage can be matched more closely (Figure 20–15). The electri-
cian must make the adjustment on the job until the primary of the transformer matches the 
measured supply voltage. The secondary then produces the desired voltage to achieve a closer 
match of the equipment nameplate voltages. Utilities do not always supply the desired precise 
voltages. There may also be a voltage drop within the plant so that the utility supply voltage is 
not actually available at the transformer.
When using taps on a three-phase transformer or bank of transformers, it is important 
that the same taps on each of the three primaries be connected in the same position on each

coil. (See the “Transformer Primary Taps” section in Unit 18.) The following problems may 
result if the taps are not connected properly:
• The output voltage on each of the three secondary voltages is not the same. This pro-
duces high unbalanced currents that causes overheating of induction motors.
• An undesirable circulating current creates a “false load” condition if the transformer is 
connected delta-delta.
Taps are used for consistently high or low voltages. They are not used with voltages that 
fluctuate or vary frequently.
SUMMARY
Single-phase transformers are often used to create various patterns to supply three-phase loads. 
One pattern is the closed-delta pattern. In this pattern, the line voltage is the same as the phase 
voltage, but the current on the lines is 1.73 times the coil current. Be sure the coil leads are 
marked correctly, and double-check the connection procedures before energizing the delta 
transformer bank.
Single-phase transformers can be connected in an open-delta pattern to provide a reduced 
capacity power supply to a system if one of the phase transformers fails. Single-phase trans-
formers connected in the closed- or the open-delta pattern do not need to be the same kVA 
rating. Often, one transformer is larger if the system is to supply three-phase delta and some

the transformer, primary taps may be needed to bring the transformer secondary voltage back

Voltage transformation on three-phase systems 
can also be accomplished using wye- connected, single-
phase transformers (Figure 21–1). To avoid errors when 
wye connecting single-phase transformers, a systematic 
 method of making the connections should be used. The 
electrician should know the basic voltage and current 
relationships common to this type of connection.
FUNDAMENTAL WYE CONNECTION
A simple wye system is formed by  arranging three 
 single-phase coils so that one end  of each coil is 
 connected at a common point (Figure  21–2). Note 
that when these connections are shown in a schematic 
diagram, they resemble the letter Y (written as “wye”). 
This configuration is also sometimes known as a “star” 
connection.
As an example, Figure 21–3 shows the wye-wye 
connection of three single-phase transformers to step 
down a three-phase input of 4152 volts to a three-phase 
output of 208 volts. Each transformer must be voltage 
rated for its applications. The H2 leads or primary wind-
ing ends of the transformer are connected together. The 
beginning or H1 lead of each transformer is connected to 
one of the three line leads.

Two of the primary windings are connected across each pair of line wires. Each trans-
former primary winding is rated at 2400 volts, and the actual voltage applied to each of these 
three windings is 2400 volts. Note that the potential across each pair of line leads is 4152 volts 
and not the 2400 + 2400 = 4800 volts that might be expected because of the connection of 
two coils (this voltage is referred to as a nominal 4160 V).
The value of 4152 volts arises from the fact that the voltage applied to each of the primary 
windings is out of phase with the voltages applied to the other primary windings. As a result, 
these winding voltages cannot be added directly to obtain the line voltage. Rather, the line 
voltage is equal to 1.73 × coil voltage. Therefore, for the input side of the transformer bank in 
Figure 21–3 where the voltage on the primary winding of each transformer is 2400 volts,
Line voltage = 1.73 × coil voltage
= 1.73 × 2400
= 4152 volts
If the coil voltage must be checked and the line voltage is known, the same value of 1.73 
can be used. For this situation, the coil voltage is obtained by dividing the line voltage by 1.73.

 of the line voltage 
applied to each of the three transformer windings. After the high-voltage primary connections 
are completed, the three-phase, 4152-volt input may be energized. It is not necessary to make 
any polarity tests on the input (primary) side.
POLARITY TEST FOR UNMARKED AND NEW 
TRANSFORMERS
The next step is to connect the low-voltage output (secondary) windings in wye (Figure 21–3). 
Follow this procedure when making the secondary connections:
 
1. Check to see that the voltage output of 
each of the three transformers is 120 volts 
(for this example).
  
Caution: Deenergize all circuits before 
making connections.
 
2. Connect the X2 ends of two low-voltage 
secondary windings.
Figure 21–4 illustrates two secondary coils with 
the X2 coil ends connected. The voltage across the 
open ends should be 1.73 × 120 = 208 volts. 
However, if the leads on one transformer are reversed, 
the voltage across the open ends will be 120 volts.
Figure 21–5 illustrates two transformers con-
nected incorrectly. The voltage across the open ends 
is only 120 volts. If the leads of transformer 2 are 
reversed, the connections will be correct, and the volt-
age across the open ends will be 208 volts.
 
3. Connect the X2 lead of the low-voltage 
secondary winding of transformer 3 with 
the X2 leads of the other two transformers.
The proper wye connection of the low-voltage 
secondary windings of the three single-phase trans-
formers is shown in Figure 21–6. The voltage across 
each pair of open ends should be 1.73 × 120 = 
208 volts. If the voltage across the open ends is cor-
rect, then the line leads feeding to the three-phase, 
208-volt secondary system may be connected.

Figure 21–7 illustrates the secondary windings connected in wye with the line leads prop-

Whenever single-phase transformers are connected in wye, the following current and 
voltage relationships are true:
• The line voltage is equal to 1.73 × winding voltage.
• The line current and the winding current are equal.
The wye-wye connection scheme is satisfactory as long as the load on the secondary side 
is generally balanced. The wye-wye connection is unsatisfactory in situations where the second-
ary load becomes greatly unbalanced. An unbalanced load results in a serious unbalance in the 
three output voltages of the transformer bank.
THREE-PHASE, FOUR-WIRE WYE CONNECTION
Voltage unbalancing in the secondary of the transformer bank can be nearly eliminated if a 
fourth wire (neutral wire) is used. This neutral wire connects between the source and the neu-
tral point on the primary side of the transformer bank.
In the connection diagram (Figure 21–8), a three-phase, four-wire system is used to 
feed the three-phase, high-voltage input to the transformer bank. The grounded neutral wire 
is connected to the common point where all three high-voltage primary winding ends or H2 
leads connect. The voltage from the neutral to any one of the three line wires is 2400 volts. 
Each high-voltage winding is connected between the neutral and one of the three line loads. 
Therefore, 2400 volts is applied to each of the three high-voltage primary windings. The volt-
age across the three line leads is 1.73 × 2400 volts, or 4152 volts. The neutral wire maintains a 
relatively constant voltage across each of the high-voltage primary windings, even though the

load is unbalanced. Because the neutral wire is grounded, it helps protect the three high-voltage 
primary windings from lightning surges.
A three-phase, four-wire system also feeds from the low-voltage secondary side of the 
transformer bank to the load. Each low-voltage secondary winding is connected between 
the secondary grounded neutral and one of the three line leads. As on the primary side, the 
 grounded neutral helps protect the low-voltage secondary windings from lightning surges.
The voltage output of each secondary winding is 120 volts. The voltage between the neutral 
and any one of the three line leads on the secondary side is 120 volts, as shown in Figure 21–8. The 
voltage across the three line leads is 1.73 × 120 = 208 volts. Thus, by using a three-phase, four-
wire secondary, two voltages are available for different types of loads: 208 volts, three phase, for 
industrial power loads such as three-phase motors, and 120 volts, single phase, for lighting loads.
Many single-phase transformers are designed so that the low-voltage side consists of two 
120-volt windings. These two windings can be connected in series for 240 volts or in parallel 
for 120 volts.
Figure 21–9 shows three single-phase transformers connected as a wye-wye bank. Each 
transformer has two 120-volt, low-voltage windings. For each single-phase transformer, the low-
voltage coils are connected in parallel to give a voltage output of 120 volts. Note in Figure 21–9 
that the secondary output windings of the three transformers are connected in wye. This three-
phase, four-wire secondary system provides two different types of service:
• three-phase, 208-volt service for motor loads
• single-phase, 120-volt service for lighting loads
The 120/208-volt wye system is commonly used in schools, stores, and offices. Another 
popular system for large installations is the 480/277-volt wye system. In many modern instal-
lations, 480-volt systems are desired for large motor loads such as supermarkets, large retail 
stores, manufacturing facilities, and so on. By utilizing a four-wire, wye secondary pattern, the 
voltage on the secondary is 277 volts to ground and 480 volts between lines. Many luminaires 
are designed for a 277-volt, single-phase line to ground, known as a grounded neutral conduc-
tor operation. Some applications of this system include
• motors connected to 480 volts (phase to phase)
• fluorescent luminaires connected to 277 volts (phase to neutral)
• 120-volt outlets, incandescent lamps, and appliances connected to 120-volt circuits sup-
plied from single-phase, 480/120/240-volt transformers or three-phase, 480/208Y/120-
volt transformers. These separate transformers are connected to the 480-volt feeders for 
the primary source.
Three single-phase transformers of the same kilovolt-ampere capacity are used in most 
wye-wye connected transformer banks. The total kilovolt-ampere capacity of a wye-wye 
connected bank is found by adding the individual kVA ratings of the transformer. If each 
transformer is rated at 25 kVA, then the total kVA is 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 kVA.

If one transformer becomes defective, it must be replaced before the transformer bank 
can be re-energized. A wye-wye connected transformer bank cannot be reconnected in an 
emergency situation by using only two single-phase transformers, such as in the open-delta 
system. Three-phase capacity can also be calculated by using the line voltages and line current: 
3-phase KVA = Line E × Line I × 1.73.
SUMMARY
Single-phase transformers can be connected in a wye pattern to achieve the desired three-phase 
and single-phase voltages required by many commercial customers. By connecting the single 
phases in a wye pattern, the line voltages can be increased by a factor of 1.73 times the coil volt-
age. This increased level of voltage is often desirable to reduce the line current drawn by a load. 
By increasing the voltage, the current will be less for a specific wattage load. Be sure to check 
all transformer polarities, and check the final connections for a solid ground if using the three-
phase, four-wire wye-connected system.

Five commonly used methods of connecting transformer coils to form three-phase trans-
former banks are delta-delta, open-delta, wye-wye, delta-wye, and wye-delta connections. The 
delta-delta, open-delta, and wye-wye connections are described in previous units.
This unit covers the delta-wye and wye-delta connections by explaining the current and 
voltage relationships for each of these methods of three-phase transformation and providing 
examples of several applications for each connection method.
STEP-DOWN APPLICATION FOR DELTA-WYE 
TRANSFORMER BANK
Assume that electrical energy must be transformed from a 2400-volt, three-phase, three-wire 
input to a 120/208-volt, three-phase, four-wire output. Each of the three single-phase trans-
formers is rated at 20 kVA, with 2400 volts on the high-voltage windings and 120 or 240 volts 
on the low-voltage windings.
The primary windings of the three single-phase transformers are delta connected. The 
line voltage of the three-phase, three-wire primary input is 2400 volts. Remember that the line 
voltage and the coil voltage are the same in a delta connection. As a result, the voltage across 
each of the primary coil windings is also 2400 volts.
Figure 22–1 illustrates the connections for the delta-wye transformer bank in this exam-
ple. Each transformer has two 120-volt, low-voltage windings that are connected in parallel to 
give a voltage output of 120 volts for each single-phase transformer. The secondary connec-
tions show that the output windings of the three transformers are connected in wye. Two types 
of service are available as a result of the three-phase, four-wire secondary system:
• three-phase, 208-volt service for motor loads
• single-phase, 120-volt service for lighting loads
The primary or input side of the bank in Figure 22–1 is delta connected. Therefore, for 
the primary side of the delta bank, the following are true:
• The line voltage and the coil voltage are the same.
• The line current is equal to 1.73 × coil current. Coil current = 20 kVA/2400 = 8.33 A, 
and line current is 1.73 × 8.33 = 14.4 A.
The secondary or output side of this transformer bank is wye connected. For the 
 secondary, the following are true:
• The line voltage is equal to 1.73 × coil voltage. Coil voltage is 120 V × 1.73 = line 
 voltage of 208 V.
• The line current and the coil current are equal.  Line current is 20 kVA/120 V = 166.6 A.
The three single-phase transformers used in a delta-wye connection have the same kVA 
capacity. The transformers in this example are each rated at 20 kVA. The total kVA capacity 
of a delta-wye transformer bank is determined by adding the three kVA ratings. Because each

transformer is rated at 20 kVA, the total delta-wye bank capacity is 60 kVA.  The total KVA of 
the bank can always be found by 1.73 × Line E × Line I.
If one transformer becomes defective, it must be replaced before the bank can be 
 re-energized. In an emergency situation, a delta-wye connected transformer bank cannot be 
reconnected using only two transformers.
In the delta-wye connection illustrated in Figure 22–1, the three single-phase transformers 
are connected to obtain additive polarity. However, the transformers that are used in an installation 
may have either additive or subtractive polarity. The polarity of each transformer must be checked. 
Then, if the basic rules for making delta connections and wye connections are followed, the electri-
cian should have no difficulty in making standard three-phase transformer bank connections.

STEP-UP APPLICATION FOR DELTA-WYE 
TRANSFORMER BANK
The delta-wye transformer bank is well adapted for stepping up voltages. The input voltage is 
stepped up by the transformer ratio and is then increased further by the voltage relationship for 
a wye connection: line voltage = 1.73 × coil voltages. In addition, the insulation requirements 
for the secondaries are reduced. This is an important advantage when very high voltages are 
used on the secondary side.
A delta-wye transformer bank used to step up the voltage at a generating station is illus-
trated in Figure 22–2. The high-voltage output is connected to three-phase transmission lines. 
These transmission lines deliver the electrical energy to municipal and industrial consumers 
who may be miles away from the generating station.

Transformer ratio refers to the actual ratio of transformer coil primary to secondary 
v oltage. Transformation ratio refers to the ratio of primary line voltage to secondary line voltage. 
In transformers that have different primary and secondary patterns, this distinction is impor-
tant. In delta-wye, the transformer ratio may be 1 to 5, but the transformation ratio is 1 to 8.65.
As shown in Figure 22–2, the AC generators deliver energy to the generating station bus 
bars at a three-phase potential of 13,800 volts. The primary windings of the three single-phase 
transformers are each rated at 13,800 volts. These primary windings are connected in delta to 
the generating station bus bars; therefore, each primary coil winding has 13,800 volts applied 
to it. The transformers have a step-up ratio of 1 to 5. As a result, the voltage output of the sec-
ondary of each single-phase transformer is 5 × 13,800 = 69,000 volts. Figure 22–2 shows that 
the three secondary windings are connected in wye. Each high-voltage secondary winding is 
connected between the secondary neutral and one of the three line leads. The voltage between 
the neutral and any one of the three line leads is the same as the secondary coil voltage, or 
69,000 volts. The voltage across the three line leads is 1.73 × 69,000 = 119,370 volts. The 
grounded neutral wire on the high-voltage secondary output must be used to obtain balanced 
three-phase voltages even though the load current may be unbalanced. Not only is this neutral 
wire  grounded at the transformer bank, it is also grounded at periodic intervals on the transmis-
sion line. As a result, it protects the three high-voltage secondary windings of the single-phase 
transformers from possible damage due to lightning surges.
WYE-DELTA TRANSFORMER BANK
A transformer bank connected in wye-delta is the type most often used to step down relatively 
high transmission line voltages (60,900 volts or more) at the consumer’s location. Two reasons 
for selecting this type of transformer bank are that the three-phase voltage is decreased by the 
transformer ratio multiplied by the factor 1.73, and the insulation requirements for the high-
voltage primary windings are reduced.
As an example, assume that it is necessary to step down a three-phase 60,900-volt input 
to a three-phase, 4400-volt output (Figure 22–3). The primary windings are connected in wye 
to a three-phase, four-wire transmission line. The three-line voltages are 60,900 volts each 
between phase conductors, and the voltage from each line wire to the grounded neutral is 
35,200 volts ( 60,900 )
 1.73
.
Each of the three single-phase transformers is rated at 1000 kVA, with 35,200 volts on the 
high-voltage side and 4400 volts on the low-voltage side. The voltage ratio of each transformer 
is 8 to 1.
Figure 22–3 shows that the secondary windings are connected in delta, resulting in a line 
voltage of 4400 volts on the three-phase, three-wire secondary system feeding to the load.
The total kVA capacity of a wye-delta transformer bank is determined by adding the kVA 
rating of each single-phase transformer in the bank. For the bank in Figure 22–3, the total kVA 
capacity is equal to 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000 kVA.

OPEN-WYE–OPEN-DELTA TRANSFORMER
A variation of the wye-delta transformer pattern is the open-wye–open-delta transformer 
connection. Another name for this connection is the wye-delta with one transformer missing. 
This is sometimes used to deliver small amounts of three-phase power to a secondary load and 
deliver larger amounts of single-phase power to the secondary load.
The connections are made to a three-phase system, but with only two single-phase trans-
formers in the bank. The primary winding is connected as in Figure 22–4 to two of the three 
phase conductors, and the common point is connected to the grounded neutral point. The volt-
age on the primary is fed from two of the phases of a three-phase system so the waveforms are 
120° out of phase. Because the primary windings are really across the line voltage and the two 
primary coils are essentially equal values and in series, the voltage splits equally between the 
two coils. In Figure 22–4, it would be 240 V per coil. If we use transformers rated at 2400 VA, 
transformer 1 will have 10 amps of primary current at 240 V. Likewise, transformer 2 will have 
10 A of primary current. The currents add at the neutral to become 17.3 amps, or 1.73 times

the phase current, flowing in the neutral conductor. This large current in the neutral can create 
problems. The conductor must be sized for the higher current (1.73 × the phase current), and 
it tends to cause imbalance in the phase voltages.
The secondary coils are connected in the open-delta pattern with one transformer’s cen-
ter tap connection being grounded. We now have a three-phase secondary with three-phase 
line voltage and single-phase voltage available. This is a true three-phase, four-wire secondary.
Calculations for the open delta are the same as for other open-delta connections. The 
line voltage of the three-phase system is the coil voltage (in Figure 22–4, it is 240 V). The line 
current is the same as the phase current (in Figure 22–4, it is 10 A). Three-phase power is 
E(line) × I (line) × 1.73 = 3-phase power. For example, 240 × 10 × 1.73 = 4152 VA. The 
primary calculations are not the same as for a completed wye. The primary uses phase voltage as 
the voltage of the source; the current from the lines is the same as the coil current. The formula 
then is voltage (coil) × current (line) × 1.73 = 3-phase power. For example, in Figure 22–4, 
240 V × 10 A × 1.73 = 4152 VA.
You will notice that the three-phase capacity of the bank is less than the two transformer 
kVAs added together. For example, if two 2400 VA transformers were added together arithmet-
ically, it would be 4800 VA. However, the transformer bank’s total VA of two 2400 VA trans-
formers’ capacity is only 4152 VA. Because one transformer is missing, the total capacity of 
each transformer is not used, and the total capacity of the bank is 86.5% of the arithmetic sum.
This pattern is used to supply a significant single-phase load and a light three-phase 
load. In that application, the two transformers are not the same kVA rating. The center tapped 
transformer would be sized to deliver the three-phase load plus the additional kVA of the single-
phase load.

THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS
Voltages on three-phase systems may be transformed using three-phase transformers. The core 
of a three-phase transformer is made with three legs. A primary and a secondary winding of 
one phase are placed on each of the three legs. These transformers may be connected in delta-
delta, wye-wye, delta-wye, or wye-delta. The connections are made inside the transformer case. 
For delta-delta connections, three high-voltage and three low-voltage leads are brought out. 
Four leads are brought out when any wye-connected windings are used. This fourth lead is 
necessary for the neutral wire connection.
The three-phase transformer occupies less space than three single-phase transform-
ers because the windings can be placed on one core in the three-phase transformer case 
(Figure 22–5). The efficiency of a three-phase transformer is higher than the overall efficiency 
of three single-phase transformers connected in a three-phase bank.
However, there is one disadvantage to the use of a three-phase transformer. If one of the 
phase windings becomes defective, the entire three-phase unit must be taken out of service. If a 
single-phase transformer in a three-phase bank becomes defective, it can be replaced quickly. 
The resultant power interruption is brief. For this reason, many transformer installations con-
sist of banks of three single-phase transformers. Figure 22–6 shows a three-phase single unit 
transformer in operation.

SUMMARY
Transformers need not be connected in the same pattern on the primary and the s econdary. 
Depending on the desired voltage level and level of step-up (increase) or step-down (decrease), 
the patterns may change. The two most popular patterns are the wye and delta. To get the great-
est step-up, the transformation ratio is best if the primary is connected delta and the secondary 
is connected wye. Likewise, to get the largest decrease in voltage, the ratio of transformation is 
the greatest if the primary is connected wye and the secondary is connected delta. Remember 
that the current ratios are the inverse of the voltage ratios.

Instrument transformers are used to measure and control AC circuits. Direct measure-
ment of high voltage or heavy currents involves large and expensive instruments, relays, and 
other circuit components of many designs. Using instrument transformers, however, makes it 
possible to use relatively small and inexpensive instruments and control devices of standard-
ized designs. Instrument transformers also protect the operator, the measuring devices, and the 
control equipment from the dangers of high voltage. The use of instrument transformers results 
in increased safety, accuracy, and convenience.
There are two distinct classes of instrument transformers: the instrument potential trans-
former and the instrument current transformer. (The word instrument is usually omitted for 
brevity.)
POTENTIAL TRANSFORMERS
The potential transformer operates on the same principle as a power or distribution transformer. 
The main difference is that the capacity of a potential transformer is small compared to that of 
power transformers. Potential transformers have ratings from 100 to 500 volt-amperes (VA). 
The low-voltage side is usually wound for 115 or 120 volts. The load on the low-voltage side 
usually consists of the potential coils of various instruments but may also include the potential 
coils of relays and other control equipment. In general, the load is relatively light, and it is not 
necessary to have potential transformers with a capacity greater than 100 to 500 volt-amperes.
The high-voltage primary winding of a potential transformer has the same voltage rating 
as the primary circuit. When it is necessary to measure the voltage of a 4600-volt, single-phase 
line, the primary of the potential transformer would be rated at 4600 volts, and the low-voltage 
secondary would be rated at 115 volts. The ratio between the primary and secondary  windings is
= 1
40
115
4600
A voltmeter connected across the secondary of the potential transformer indicates a value of 
115 volts. To determine the actual voltage on the high-voltage circuit, the instrument reading of 
115 volts must be multiplied by 40 (115 × 40 = 4600 volts). In most cases, the voltmeter is cali-
brated to indicate the actual value of voltage on the primary side. As a result, the operator is not 
required to apply the multiplier to the instrument reading, and the possibility of errors is reduced.
Figure 23–1 illustrates the connections for a potential transformer with a 4600-volt pri-
mary input and a 115-volt output to the voltmeter. This potential transformer has subtractive 
polarity. (All instrument potential transformers now manufactured have subtractive polarity.) 
One of the secondary leads of the transformer in Figure 23–1 is grounded to eliminate high-
voltage hazards.
Potential transformers have highly accurate ratios between the primary and secondary 
voltage values; generally the error is less than 0.5%. Power transformers are not designed for 
highly accurate voltage transformation.

CURRENT TRANSFORMERS
Current transformers are used so that ammeters and the current coils of other instruments and 
relays need not be connected directly to high-current lines. In other words, these instruments 
and relays are insulated from high currents. Current transformers also step down the current to 
a known ratio. The use of current transformers means that relatively small and accurate instru-
ments, relays, and control devices of standardized design can be used in circuits.
The current transformer has separate primary and secondary windings. The primary 
winding, which may consist of a few turns of heavy wire wound on a laminated iron core, is 
connected in series with one of the line wires. The secondary winding consists of a greater 
number of turns of a smaller size of wire. The primary and secondary windings are wound on 
the same core.
The current rating of the primary winding of a current transformer is determined by the 
maximum value of the load current. The secondary winding is rated at 5 amperes regardless of 
the current rating of the primary windings.
For example, assume that the current rating of the primary winding of a current trans-
former is 100 amperes. The primary winding has three turns, and the secondary winding has 
60 turns. The secondary winding has the standard current rating of 5 amperes; therefore, the 
ratio between the primary and secondary currents is 100/5, or 20 to 1. The primary current 
is 20 times greater than the secondary current. Because the secondary winding has 60 turns 
and the primary winding has 3 turns, the secondary winding has 20 times as many turns as the

primary winding. For a current transformer, then, the ratio of primary to secondary currents is 
inversely proportional to the ratio of primary to secondary turns.
In Figure 23–2, a current transformer is used to step down current in a 4600-volt, single-
phase circuit. The current transformer is rated at 100 to 5 amperes, and the ratio of current 
step-down is 20 to 1. In other words, there are 20 amperes in the primary winding for each 
ampere in the secondary winding. If the ammeter at the secondary indicates 4 amperes, the 
actual current in the primary is 20 times this value, or 80 amperes.
The current transformer in Figure 23–2 has polarity markings in that the two high-voltage 
primary leads are marked H1 and H2, and the secondary leads are marked X1 and X2. When 
H1 is instantaneously positive, X1 is positive at the same moment. Some current transformer 
manufacturers mark only the H1 and X1 leads or use polarity marks. Polarity marks can be any 
similar marks that are placed on the H1 lead and the X1 lead. Common marks are Xs, dots, or 
squares. When connecting current transformers in circuits, the H1 lead is connected to the line 
lead feeding from the source, and the H2 lead is connected to the line lead feeding to the load.
The secondary leads are connected directly to the ammeter. Note that one of the second-
ary leads is grounded as a safety precaution to eliminate high-voltage hazards.
Caution: The secondary circuit of a transformer should never be opened when there is 
current in the primary winding. If the secondary circuit is opened when there is current in the 
primary winding, then the entire primary current is an exciting current that induces a high volt-
age in the secondary winding. This voltage can be high enough to endanger human life.
Individuals working with current transformers must check that the secondary winding cir-
cuit path is closed. At times, it may be necessary to disconnect the secondary instrument circuit 
when there is current in the primary winding. For example, the metering circuit may require 
rewiring, or other repairs may be needed. To protect a worker, a small short-circuiting switch is 
connected into the circuit at the secondary terminals of the current transformer. This switch is 
closed when the instrument circuit must be disconnected for repairs or rewiring.

Current transformers have very 
accurate ratios between the primary and 
 secondary current values: The error of 
most  modern current transformers is less 
than 0.5%.
When the primary winding has a large 
current rating, it may consist of a straight 
conductor passing through the center of 
a hollow metal core. The secondary wind-
ing is wound on the core. This assembly is 
called a bar-type current transformer. The 
name is derived from the construction of 
the primary, which actually is a straight copper bus bar. All standard current transformers with 
ratings of 1000 amperes or more are bar-type transformers. Some current transformers with 
lower ratings may also be of the bar type. Figure 23–3 shows a bar-type current transformer.
In window-type current transformers, the primary passes through an opening in the 
transformer windings. The primary of the transformer is the line conductor, much like the bar 
forms the primary in the bar-type current transformer. The shape of the transformer resembles 
a donut. Therefore, this type of current transformer (CT) is often referred to as a “donut.”
Figure 23–4 shows a clamp-on ammeter that uses the concept of a window-type current 
transformer. By opening the clamp and then closing it around the current-carrying conductor, 
the current in the conductor is measured on the meter.

INSTRUMENT TRANSFORMERS IN A SINGLE-PHASE CIRCUIT
Figure 23–5 illustrates an instrument load connected through instrument transformers to 
a single-phase, high-voltage line. The instruments include a voltmeter, an ammeter, and 
a wattmeter. The potential transformer is rated at 4600 to 115 volts; the current trans-
former is rated at 50 to 5 amperes. The potential coils of the voltmeter and the wattme-
ter are connected in parallel across the low-voltage output of the potential transformer. 
Therefore, the voltage across the potential coils of each of these instruments is the same. 
The current coils of the ammeter and the wattmeter are connected in series across the 
secondary output of the current transformer. As a result, the current in the current coils 
of both instruments is the same. Note that the secondary of each instrument transformer 
is grounded to provide protection from high-voltage hazards, as provided in Article 250 
Part IX of the NEC.
The voltmeter in Figure 23–5 reads 112.5 volts, the ammeter reads 4 amperes, and 
the  wattmeter reads 450 watts. To find the primary voltage, primary current, primary 
power,  apparent power in the primary circuit, and the power factor, the following procedures

In DC instruments needed to monitor large values of DC, another type of system is 
needed. Because it is not possible to use standard transformers to change DC levels, instrument 
shunts are used to develop the smaller values needed for DC monitoring equipment. In effect, 
these DC shunts are high-power, low-resistance resistors that are placed in line with the DC 
power. They typically have connection points that are used to connect to meters. The resistance 
of the shunt is designed so that when full line current flows through the resistive material, it will 
develop 50  millivolts across the resistance and therefore the meter movement. (See the DC 
meter in Figure 23–6.)
INSTRUMENT TRANSFORMERS ON THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
Three-Phase, Three-Wire System
On a three-phase, three-wire system, two potential transformers of the same rating and two 
current transformers of the same rating are necessary. It is common practice in three-phase 
metering to interconnect the secondary circuits. That is, the connections are made so that one 
wire or device conducts the combined currents of two transformers in different phases.
The low-voltage instrument connections for a three-phase, three-wire system are shown 
in Figure 23–7. Note that the two potential transformers are connected in open delta to the 
4600-volt, three-phase line. This results in three secondary-voltage values of 115 volts each. 
The two current transformers are connected so that the primary of one transformer is in series 
with line A, and the primary winding of the second transformer is in series with line C.
Note that three ammeters are used in the low-voltage secondary circuit. This  wiring 
system is satisfactory on a three-phase, three-wire system, and all three ammeters give

a ccurate  readings. Other instruments that can be used in this circuit include a three-phase 
 wattmeter, a three-phase watt-hour meter, and a three-phase power factor meter. When 
three-phase instruments are connected in the secondary circuits, these instruments must be 
connected correctly so that the proper phase relationships are maintained. If this precaution 
is not observed, the instrument readings will be incorrect. In checking the connections for this 
three-phase, three-wire metering system, note that the interconnected potential and current 
secondaries are both grounded to provide protection from high-voltage hazards.

Figure 23–8 illustrates the secondary metering connections for a 2400/4152-volt, three-phase, 
four-wire system. The three potential transformers are connected in wye to give a three-phase 
output of three secondary voltages of 120 volts to neutral. Three 50- to 5-ampere current trans-
formers are used in the three line conductors. Three ammeters are used in the interconnected 
secondary circuit. Both the interconnected potential and the current secondaries are grounded 
to protect against possible high-voltage hazards.

SUMMARY
Instrument transformers are specifically designed to transform voltage and current in very 
precise ratios. Potential transformers are used to transform high voltages to usable values of 
115 or 120 volts for use by standard instruments. Current transformers are used to transform 
large values of AC down to a 5-amp level so that the secondary current can be used by standard 
instruments. DC levels are typically reduced to a usable level through the use of shunts. The 
shunt has a primary-load current rating, and the meter is then connected across the shunt. The 
meter is designed to operate at 50 millivolts.

Three-phase transformer units are designed to be installed as a complete unit. Instead 
of installing three individual transformers and field connecting them into the desired pattern, 
a transformer (preassembled as a unit) is used. The transformer windings are assembled on a 
common core, and the appropriate leads are brought out. There are usually three high-voltage 
leads marked H1−H2−H3. The secondary leads would be marked X1−X2−X3. In three-phase 
transformers, the phase rotation or phase sequence between the primary and the secondary is 
critical.
All phase windings within the transformer normally have the same relative polar-
ity. This means that if the transformer connection is a subtractive polarity, then the other 
phase connections would also be subtractive. However, the three-phase polarity depends 
on how the leads are brought out to the secondary terminals. Terminal markings alone do 
not indicate all the relationships between primary and secondary. Three-phase transformers 
should have a voltage vector diagram to show the angular phase displacement between the 
primary and the secondary and also the phase-sequence order. Figure 24–1 shows a volt-
age vector diagram for a three-phase transformer connected delta to delta. The American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines the angular displacement as the angle between 
H1-N and X1-N, where N is the neutral point in the vector diagram. In Figure 24–1, the 
displacement is 0°. This means that the relationship of primary phase sequence is H1, H2, 
H3, and the secondary phase rotation is X1, X2, X3. The same delta-delta configuration of 
a three-phase transformer may have an 
angular displacement of 180°. In this case, 
the vector diagram would appear as shown 
in Figure  24–2. The difference is in the 
internal connection of the secondary coils. 
These changes in secondary connections 
can be seen in the coil connection dia-
grams of Figures 24–1 and 24–2.
Most three-phase, dry-type distri-
bution transformers are connected as a 
primary delta connection. The secondary 
can be connected as a wye or a delta, and 
the leads brought out to the connection 
terminals. If the pattern is a delta-delta 
pattern, the displacement may be 0° or 
180°. If the secondary pattern is a wye, 
the angular displacement is typically 30°. 
Figure 24–3 illustrates what a delta-wye 
pattern may look like. Figure 24–4 shows 
FIGURE 24–1 Internal connections determine 
0° angular displacement.

PARALLELING THREE-
PHASE TRANSFORMERS
Knowing the voltage vectors allows you 
to properly parallel three-phase transform-
ers for increased load capacity. It is only 
necessary to connect the similarly marked 
high- and low-voltage terminals if the trans-
formers have the same voltage ratio, the 
same percent impedance, and the same 
angular displacement.
If the transformers are delta-wye or 
wye-delta, the angular displacement is 30°. 
When paralleling three-phase transformer 
units, only transformers with the same displacement should be connected. The only way to 
change the angular displacement is to reconnect the internal leads of the individual coils.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Because three-phase transformers are wound on the same core, the efficiency of transforma-
tion is higher, with less flux leakage than three single-phase units. Typically the cost is less for 
a three-phase unit compared to the same capacity system using three single-phase units. The 
disadvantage of a single unit housing a polyphase transformer is that if one coil fails, the entire 
transformer must be replaced, rather than just one transformer phase.
SUMMARY
Three-phase transformers are easier to install in transformer installations because all the 
internal connections are done. The same NEC regulations apply for three single-phase or for 
one polyphase transformer installation. Care must be taken when connecting multiple three-
phase transformers to supply a load. The connection pattern and the phase displacement must 
be considered. Three-phase transformers are more efficient in the transformation of power 
because of the common core and winding system. The disadvantage of the three-phase unit 
transformer is that if one phase fails, the whole transformer must be replaced.

Article 450 of the NEC covers the minimum requirements of the installation of electrical 
wiring and equipment within public or private buildings and their premises.
TRANSFORMER LOCATION
The location of transformers is of prime concern. Most electrical codes and power companies 
state that transformers and transformer vaults must be readily accessible to qualified personnel 
for inspection and maintenance. The codes also contain specific sections covering oil-insulated, 
askarel-insulated, other dielectric fluid–insulated, and dry-type transformers as well as trans-
former vaults. Dry-type transformers installed outdoors should have weatherproof enclosures.
TRANSFORMER OVERCURRENT PROTECTION
The NEC provides information on the overcurrent protection required for transformers and 
transformer banks as well as the maximum overcurrent protection allowed on a transformer 
primary.
Figure 25–1 illustrates where transformer primary protection is located.

For a transformer of 600 volts or less, overcurrent protection is permitted, as seen in 
Table 450.3(B) of the NEC.
Each transformer with a primary or secondary rated at 600 volts or less shall have overcur-
rent protection corresponding to the following conditions:
 
1. If there is protection of the primary conductors only and the primary current is 
less than 2 amps, the overcurrent protection must not exceed 300% of the primary

current. If the primary current is between 2 and 9 amps, the overcurrent protec-
tion must not exceed 167% of the primary current. If the current is 9 amps or 
more, the overcurrent is to be 125% of the current or the next higher standard size 
of fuse or circuit breaker.
 
2. If there is primary and secondary overcurrent protection, then generally 250% 
can be used for the primary protection rating. (See Note 3, Table 450.3(B) in the 
NEC.) The secondary will have 167% protection for less than 9 amps or 125% pro-
tection for 9 amps or more.
Each transformer with a primary or secondary rated at over 600 volts shall have overcur-
rent protection according to the following conditions:
 
1. In any location, if the primary is over 600 volts and the transformer impedance is 
not over 6%, use a primary fuse at 300% or a circuit breaker at 600%. If the trans-
former has an impedance over 6% but not more than 10%, the fuse is still 300%, 
but the circuit-breaker protection is reduced to 400%.
 
2. If secondary protection is required, as when used for separately derived systems, 
use Table 450.3(A) of the NEC, including the notes for reference. This section of 
the table refers to the secondary voltages. If the secondary is still over 600 volts, 
use circuit breakers or fuses at 225% to 300%. If the secondary is less than 
600 volts, then a fuse or circuit breaker is 125% or 250%.
The Code requires that instrument potential transformers have primary fuses if installed 
indoors or enclosed. Generally, these instrument transformers are protected by a fuse of 15 A 
or less.
SECONDARY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TRANSFORMERS
The Code Article 450.6 defines a secondary tie as a circuit operating at 600 volts or less between 
phases. This circuit connects two power sources or power supply points such as the secondaries 
of two transformers.
When transformer secondaries are tied together to improve load performance, several 
provisions must be followed. If the transformers are connected as in Figure 25–2, Article 
450.6(B) of the Code is used. When the secondaries are tied, the transformers themselves must 
be protected by a secondary fuse rated at not more than 250% of the secondary rated current. 
In addition to this protection, there must be an automatic circuit breaker operated by a reverse 
current relay that is set to open the breaker at not more than the secondary current of the trans-
former. Then the transformer tie is sized and protected as described next.
A secondary tie circuit should have overcurrent protection at each end except in situations 
as described in 450.6(A) of the Code. A tie connection between two transformer secondaries is

end and no load taps are in the tie connections. The tap conductor ampacity must be greater

However, when load taps are made in the tie circuit between transformers, the minimum

The following overload protective devices used for the tie connection with load taps are 
acceptable:
• limiting devices consisting of fusible-link cable connectors (limiters)
• automatic circuit breakers
If the voltage exceeds a value specified in the Code Article 450.6(A)(5), the tie conductors 
must have a switch at each end of the tie circuit. When these switches are open, the limiters and 
tie conductors are deenergized. These switches shall be not less than the current rating of the 
tie conductors. Further, these switches shall be capable of opening their rated current.
PARALLEL OPERATION OF TRANSFORMERS
Transformers may be operated in parallel and protected as a unit if their electrical character-
istics are similar. These electrical characteristics include the voltage ratio and the percentage 
impedance. When transformers have similar electrical characteristics, they divide the load in 
proportion to their kVA rating. See Article 450.7.

GUARDING TRANSFORMERS
Appropriate provisions must be made to minimize the possibility of damage to transformers 
from external causes. This is particularly important if the transformers are located where they 
are exposed to mechanical damage.
Dry-type transformers must be provided with a noncombustible moisture-resistant case 
or enclosure that provides reasonable protection against the accidental insertion of foreign 
objects. They also should have weatherproof enclosures when installed outdoors. The trans-
former installation must conform with the NEC requirements of Article 450.8, provisions for 
guarding live parts.
The operating voltage of exposed live parts of transformers must be marked by warning 
signs or visible markings. These markings or signs are to be mounted in unobstructed positions 
on the equipment and structure.
GROUNDING
The NEC requires that the metal cases and tanks of transformers be grounded. Further, all 
noncurrent-carrying metal parts of transformer installations and structures, including fences, 
are also to be grounded and bonded. This grounding must be done in the manner prescribed 
by NEC Article 450.10, which refers to Parts V, VI, and VII of Article 250, in order to minimize 
any voltage hazard that may be caused by insulation failures or static conditions.
TRANSFORMER NAMEPLATE DATA
According to the Code Article 450.11, each transformer shall be provided with a nameplate, and 
the nameplate must include the following information:
 
a. manufacturer’s name
 
b. rated kVA capacity
 
c. frequency in hertz
 
d. primary and secondary voltages
 
e. amount of insulating liquid and type used
 
f. temperature class of insulation in dry-type transformers
 
g. impedance (25 kVA and higher)
 
h. required clearances for transformers with vented openings
The NEC requires that the manufacturer’s name (a) be on the nameplate to establish 
reliability and conformance to standard transformer designs. The full-load kVA (b) of the 
transformer is provided rather than the full-load wattage because the power factor of the 
load is not known by the manufacturer. It is more accurate to specify the kVA and allow

the system designer to make the right application for the transformer. The frequency in 
hertz (c) is used to allow the proper magnetic effects to ensure accurate transformation of 
the rated values. The primary and secondary voltages (d) are given at full-load values, that 
is, when the transformer is operating at full kVA capacity. The amount of insulating liquid 
(e) is a necessary value when installing liquid-filled transformers. If the transformer should 
rupture, the liquid must be contained by a capture system. It is essential to know how much 
liquid must be contained in the event of a spill. In all dry-type transformers, the insulation 
class (f) must be listed, which is an indication of the temperature that may be encountered 
while the transformer is operating. This value indicates how and where the dry transformer 
can be mounted and installed and its proximity to flammable materials. On transformers 
25 kVA and larger, the impedance rating (g) must be listed. The impedance is an indication 
of how much opposition the transformer offers to AC current. It is used to calculate the short 
circuit–current ratings that a transformer can deliver to the load when a short circuit occurs 
on the secondary side of the transformer. The last requirement on the nameplate is the clear-
ance distance (h) required for transformers with vented openings for heat dissipation. Again, 
this aids the electrician when installing the transformer to maintain the proper distance from 
flammable materials.
TRANSFORMER DISCONNECTING MEANS
Transformers are required to have a disconnecting means located in sight from the trans-
former or in a remote location if the transformer is other than a class 2 or class 3 transformer. 
According to NEC Article 450.14, the disconnect in a remote location must be lockable, and the 
disconnect location must be marked on the transformer.
DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMERS INSTALLED INDOORS
Dry-type transformers are used extensively for indoor installations. These transformers are 
cooled by air. They are not encased in the steel tanks required for oil-filled transformers. For 
protection, dry-type transformers are enclosed in sheet metal cases with openings to allow air 
to circulate.
The NEC article 450.21 specifies that dry-type transformers of a 112 1/2 kVA rating or 
less must have a separation of 12 in. from any combustible material; however, there are Code 
conditions and exceptions.
Some transformers of more than a 112 1/2 kVA rating must be installed in a transformer 
room with fire-resistant construction or must be installed in a transformer vault. Transformers 
with Class 155 insulation (80°C [27°F] temperature rise) need not be installed in a transformer 
vault provided they are separated from combustible material by the horizontal and vertical 
dimensions as specified in the Code. Any dry-type transformer rated at more than 35,000 volts 
must be installed in a transformer vault.

ASKAREL-INSULATED TRANSFORMERS INSTALLED INDOORS
The windings of some transformers are cooled and insulated by a synthetic, nonflammable 
liquid called askarel. Askarel, when decomposed by an electric arc, produces only nonexplosive 
gases.
The Code specifies that askarel-insulated transformers over 25 kVA must be furnished 
with a pressure-relief vent. If this type of transformer is installed in a poorly ventilated area, it 
must be furnished with some method of absorbing gases that may be generated by arcing inside 
the case. The pressure relief vent may be connected to a flue that carries the gases outside the 
building or vault.
Any askarel-insulated transformer rated over 35,000 volts must be installed in a vault.
OIL-INSULATED TRANSFORMERS INSTALLED INDOORS
Many transformers are cooled and insulated with a special insulating oil. The fire hazard 
potential of oil-insulated transformers is greater than that of askarel-insulated transformers. 
Therefore, the Code requirements are more exacting for oil-insulated transformers. See NEC 
Article 450.26.
OIL-INSULATED TRANSFORMERS INSTALLED OUTDOORS
The NEC article 450.27 requires that combustible buildings, door and window openings, and 
fire escapes must be safeguarded from fires originating in oil-insulated transformers. Such 
protection may be provided by effective space separation or by erecting a fire-resistant barrier 
between the transformer bank and the areas requiring protection or by providing an automatic 
fire suppression system.
In addition, the Code requires that some means be installed to contain the transformer oil 
from a ruptured transformer tank. Such a precaution applies to a transformer installation adja-
cent to a building where an oil explosion can result in a fire hazard without this preventive mea-
sure. See Figures 25–5 and 25–6 for examples of oil-insulated transformers installed outdoors.
PROVISIONS FOR TRANSFORMER VAULTS
The Code regulations cover all essential details for vaults used for transformer installations, 
including the arrangement, construction, and ventilation of the vaults. See NEC Article 450, 
Part III.
AUTOTRANSFORMERS
Code specifications are provided for the use of autotransformers for lighting circuits. Recall that 
an autotransformer does not have separate primary and secondary windings. It consists of only 
one winding on an iron core. Part of the single winding of the autotransformer is common to 
both the primary and secondary circuits.

The Code limits the use of an autotransformer when feeding branch circuits because of 
the interconnection of the primary and secondary windings. The autotransformer may be used 
only where the identified ground wire of the load circuit is connected solidly to the grounded 
wire of the source (NEC 210.9). An exception to this rule is when a circuit without grounded 
conductors is used.
Figure 25–7 illustrates an autotransformer connected to a lighting load. Note that the 
grounded wire is carried through the entire system.
An alternate use of an autotransformer for lighting circuits is shown in Figure 25–8. This 
circuit also follows Code regulations, as the identified ground wire is carried through the entire 
system.

Figure 25–9 illustrates an application for an autotransformer that is not approved by 
the Code. Here, the single-phase, 230-volt input to the autotransformer is obtained from a 
three-phase, 230-volt source. The use of a mid-tap on the autotransformer makes available a 
single-phase, three-wire system for a lighting load. However, if the grounded wire is not solidly 
connected through the entire system, this circuit will not meet Code regulations. The type of 
installation shown in Figure 25–9 is unsafe, particularly if an accidental ground condition devel-
ops on the three-phase system.
Buck and Boost Transformers
“Buck” and “boost” transformers are forms of autotransformer connections. Transformers that 
are field connected as an autotransformer are covered in Article 450.4(B).

The boost transformer is used to increase the supply voltage slightly. A typical application 
of a boost transformer connection is to increase the line voltage from a 208 volts source to be 
used with a 230 volts–rated machine. To do this, the line voltage only needs to be increased 
22 volts. Rather than try to find an isolation-type transformer with a 208 volts primary and a 
230 volts secondary, a simple transformer designed for boosting the voltage 22 volts is used.

The boost transformer, or buck transformer, is a smaller, more economical solution than a full-
size, fully rated primary and secondary. Typical values of added voltage (boost) or subtracted 
voltage (buck) are secondaries of 12/24, 16/32, 24/48. The primaries are generally dual-
voltage rated as are the secondaries. By connecting the transformer as in Figure 25–10(A), the 
primary is rated for 120/240, but only 208 volts are available. Therefore, the primary voltage 
on each winding is one-half the total voltage, or 104 volts. This boost transformer is a 10:1 ratio 
(primary to secondary), so the secondary windings rated for 12/24 V each develop 10.4 volts. 
The primary windings are in series, and the secondary windings are in series. The secondary 
voltage is added to the primary voltage for a total of 228.8 volts, or nearly the 320 volts that was 
desired. The method of connecting a boost transformer is to connect X1 to H4. The supply lines 
are connected to H1 and H4, and the output connections are taken from H1 and X4. Notice that 
one line, H1, is common to both input and output, creating an autotransformer pattern.

Remember the instantaneous polarity of 
the H1 lead is where current enters the primary 
winding or the negative polarity, and X1 is where 
current leaves the secondary winding at the same 
instant, the negative polarity. By assigning electri-
cal polarities (instantaneous values) to the leads 
and connecting them as if they were batteries, 
you can see that the voltages add together to yield 
an increased voltage.
To reduce the line voltage, you must “buck” 
the voltage. Use the same transformer, but recon-
nect the leads for bucking the applied voltage. 
Typically, this is used to reduce the voltage from 
230 to 208 volts for equipment needs. The trans-
formers are connected as in Figure 25–10(B), to 
have the secondary voltage oppose, or buck, the 
supply voltage. Notice that H4 is connected to X4. 
Again, if you assign instantaneous negative polarities to H1 and X1, you can see that the small 
secondary voltage is in opposition to the primary voltage. Subtract the secondary voltage from 
the primary voltage to get output values.
By using dual-voltage primaries and dual-voltage secondaries, you can make a variety of 
buck or boost voltages. Buck and boost transformers are rated in kVA. The load kVA deter-
mines the transformer used.
NEC Article 450.4(B) states that a transformer field connected as an autotransformer, 
as is the case with boost transformers, shall be identified for use at the higher voltage. A 
transformer rated for boost or buck is designed for the higher voltage. Article 210.9 refers 
to branch circuits derived from autotransformers and first states that the autotransformer 
shall be supplied with a grounded conductor. The exceptions to Article 210.9 allow us 
to use the transformer as described above to increase or decrease voltage fed by two hot 
conductors.
Voltage drops (losses) in long or heavily loaded distribution systems may be increased 
in this manner to compensate for line drop. Many regular isolation transformer corrections are 
used as autotransformers to decrease or increase a voltage (see Figure 25–11).
IDENTIFIED FEEDER
On a four-wire, delta-connected secondary feeder conductor where the midpoint of one 
phase is grounded to supply lighting and similar loads, the phase conductor with the highest 
voltage to ground must be identified by an outer finish that is orange in color, or by tagging

SUMMARY
Transformers must be installed according to the provisions of the NEC. There are many provi-
sions that apply, and each case must be thoroughly researched. When using the Code criteria, 
be sure to consider all provisions of the Code. Overcurrent protection can be quite different 
depending on the location and other protection available at the transformer installation. Be 
sure to consider the nameplate information when locating the transformer. Transformers can 
be dangerous and may cause severe injury or property damage if not installed and protected 
properly.
