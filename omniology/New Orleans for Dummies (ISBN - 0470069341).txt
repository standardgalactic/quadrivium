About the Author
Julia Kamysz Lane is a freelance writer and book reviewer whose
work has appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines. She
and her husband are dividing their time between Chicago and 
New Orleans while they restore their 1940s bungalow after severe
flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. They care for a small zoo
of pets, comprised of four dogs — Catahoula Desoto, Dalmatians
Darby and Jolie, and All-American Shelby — and two cats, Cricket
and Bruiser Bear.
Dedication
This book is again dedicated to my parents, Rich and Ellen Kamysz,
for hosting us and our many pets in their home for eight months
after the storm. Mom and Dad, we can never repay you for your
love, patience, and generosity during that difficult time.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would first and foremost like to thank my editor, Stephen
Bassman, for his enthusiasm, guidance, and excellent listening
skills when I was eager to share my New Orleans experiences.
And grateful thanks to the following for factual and emotional sup-
port during the revision of this book: my wonderful New Orleans
friends Becky Anderson; Esther Carlisle; Victoria Cooke; Mark and
Bonnie Suckow (congrats on twins William and Robin!); Angela
Portera and Dayna Dufrene, for hosting us countless times while
we salvaged flooded possessions and gutted our house; and
Michael Depp and Darleen Mipro, for initiating a long overdue
reunion and hosting at the very last minute (congrats on baby
Jude!).
Thank you WWOZ (www.wwoz.org) for playing such awesome,
funky music over the Web so I could be inspired by New Orleans
culture and attitude no matter where I was, and especially while
working on this book.
I also want to thank my new Illinois friends Dave and Shasta
Newton; Ralph and Barb Scalise; and Grant and Whitney Rupp 
(aka “Whant”).
Of course, I must thank my family, especially my parents Rich and
Ellen Kamysz, my father- and mother-in-law Rich and Barb Lane,

and my brother Marty Kamysz and sister-in-law Renee Kamysz, all
of whom helped us get back on our feet again. I am grateful to my
young nieces, toddler Lauren and baby Megan Kamysz, for making
me laugh, smile, and look forward to the future.
Many compassionate people offered us money, clothes, and a
shoulder to cry on in the months after the storm, plus food, crates,
toys, and more for our pets. I will never forget your kindness.
Lastly, thank you to my husband and best friend, Brian Lane, who
never gave up looking for those antique salters among the wreck-
age of our New Orleans home. Ultimately, the salters didn’t matter
as much as having you by my side as we rebuild our life together.
TBIL!

ormally, revising this guide and finding new ways to help you plan

I tell you about the many new hotels, restaurants and shops and bring
you up to date on old favorites. I also offer travel tips and advice that
only a local would know. But after Hurricane Katrina devastated New
Orleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast in 2005, this revision has proven
more difficult — both logistically and emotionally — to write than I
expected. For although many of the neighborhoods, places and historic
landmarks you will want to visit have been mercifully spared, much
more of the city (that perhaps visitors would not typically tour) was not.
When Hurricane Katrina first threatened the Crescent City, my husband
and I chose to evacuate our Lakeview home with our many beloved pets.
It was a wise decision, as our home and neighborhood were devastated
by flooding from the breached levees. For days, even weeks after
Katrina, we spent hours on the phone trying to find out if our friends
and neighbors were safe. Some had stayed and some had evacuated like
us. Thankfully, everyone we knew was okay, but we knew that many
others lost loved ones or couldn’t find someone dear to them.
During those first weeks after the storm, the city itself seemed lost. When
I first saw video footage of the flooding, I didn’t recognize my own neigh-
borhood. I feared the worst. But as time passed, and people began to
recover and rebuild, it became clear that the city would survive. Old tra-
ditions and places that were once taken for granted are now revered and
honored. Communities that had fallen by the wayside due to poverty
and inadequate education are finding support from around the world.
And everyone is coming together to help one another like never before.
So when you visit New Orleans, don’t be surprised if you get caught up
in the spirit of the locals. Once easy and carefree, they are now fiercely
determined to make “The City That Care Forgot” one that you will
always remember. I hope that you find this book to be both practical and
inspirational as you discover New Orleans’s many pleasures.
About This Book
New Orleans For Dummies, 4th Edition is a reference book, not an
exhaustive, voluminous guide that requires hours of reading. The infor-
mation is laid out in the logical order of a step-by-step manual — from
planning your trip to arriving to seeing attractions to checking out the
nightlife and so forth — but you don’t need to read the book in order
from front to back. Scan the table of contents or the index to find what
you need.

Travel information can and does change at any given time, and this is
doubly true in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Businesses are still repair-
ing property damage. Prices and hours of operation are subject to
change as businesses adapt to fluctuating crowds. I therefore suggest
that you call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The
author, editors, and publisher can’t be held responsible for the experi-
ences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however,
so I encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings.
Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all favorite targets
of thieves and pickpockets.

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier.

For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
In this book I make some of the following assumptions about you and
what your needs may be as a traveler:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance on
whether to take a trip to New Orleans and how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore New Orleans and wants expert advice when you finally do
get a chance to enjoy what the city has to offer.
 You may be an experienced traveler who has visited New Orleans
before Katrina hit and you want updates on some of your favorite
hotels, restaurants and attractions and suggestions on how to
make the most of your first post-Katrina visit.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about New Orleans or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or
attraction. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on the
best places to give you that uniquely New Orleans experience.
If you fit any of these criteria, this book gives you the information you
need.
Introduction 3
A note about maps in this edition
Conventional travel-guide wisdom says that when a business closes, delete it from
the map. However, the state of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina is anything but
conventional. Though some businesses we once recommended are closed as we go
to print, many are pushing to reopen in 2007. We’re optimistically keeping these busi-
nesses on the maps in this edition, listed under “Closed, May Reopen” in the map keys
and marked on the maps with white bullets instead of black ones. We encourage you
to call for updates. Businesses we listed in the previous edition of this guide that will
not reopen are labeled “Closed Permanently” and are mapped with a shaded gray
bullet. We hope this notation gives you a sense of how Katrina affected this book in
between updates. It is not meant to give a comprehensive view of affected proper-
ties; many, many other businesses that we don’t map were damaged or destroyed.

How This Book Is Organized
New Orleans For Dummies, 4th Edition is designed to serve as two books
in one: It’s both a trip-planning guide and a savvy reference book, boiling
off the excessive minutiae of other, more conventional travel guides,
leaving you with the essential information you need to enjoy New
Orleans without getting fleeced or disappointed — and without looking
like an obvious tourist.
Part I: Introducing New Orleans
Part I introduces you to the city of New Orleans, and I include the somber
but essential topic of Hurricane Katrina. I describe why this disaster
occurred and how the city is coping. This part also gives you some his-
torical background, plus a fine-tuned list of the city’s best, with tips on
what time of year to visit.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans
In this part, you get your hands dirty with the details of planning your
trip, from dealing with money to getting to the Crescent City, plus tips
for travelers with special needs.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans
This part helps you get the lay of the land before you arrive, describes
your lodging options, introduces you to New Orleans’s neighborhoods —
including those that flooded — and leads you to the best spots to sample
the city’s culinary delights, from beignets to jambalaya. By eating out
during your stay, you are supporting a New Orleans tradition: great food
you can’t get anywhere else.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans
How often do you get a chance to shop and make a difference? Please
feel free to eat out and buy souvenirs galore — from antiques to pralines
to T-shirts — and help New Orleans’s economy grow. Here I tell you what
you need to know to enjoy the many sights and shopping delights of
New Orleans. Plus, I provide you with optional itineraries to manage
your time, and finish with a list of day trips if you’d like to stray from the
city for a day or two.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark:
New Orleans Nightlife
If you were concerned that locals are too tired from rebuilding to party,
you are happily mistaken. If anything, we need some fun to recharge our
batteries. So please, try not to retire to your hotel room after the sun
goes down, because you may miss out on at least half of what New
Orleans is all about. This part starts with a rundown of the city’s varied
and exciting cultural scene and goes on to the best bars and clubs in the
French Quarter and beyond.
New Orleans For Dummies, 4th Edition

Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part VI gives you handy information in list form. I take this opportunity
to outline ten classic experiences you can still have in New Orleans, the
top ten issues the city faces at this crucial juncture, and I give you a
reminder of ten things we lost in the hurricane.
Post-Katrina Information
You’ll find a compendium of information — including a timeline and a list
of notable figures — in the brand new Chapter 2, “Hurricane Katrina and
Its Aftermath.” Elsewhere, I’ve done my best to include the latest clos-
ings and openings as we go to print, but you’ll need to call ahead to con-
firm before you visit (especially for restaurants). Throughout this guide,
I assess Katrina’s impact on each industry (in sections called “Assessing
Katrina’s Affect On . . .” at the beginning of relevant chapters), and I’ve
also updated every single listing to give its post-hurricane status. If a
business is closed but looks poised to reopen, I’ve optimistically kept its
review in the book, with a note about its limbo status and details of the
damage done. If a business looks closed for good, I’ve removed the list-
ing and made a note in the “Assessing Katrina’s Affect On . . .” section.
I’ve also kept the defunct businesses listed on the map (with a special
notation by the bullets). This allows you to glance at the maps and get a
sense of the hurricane’s impact. See “A note about maps in this edition”
in this section. Finally, look for hurricane emergency hotline numbers
and other pertinent safety information in the Appendix.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins of this book, you will find a number of helpful little icons
designed to draw your attention to particularly useful bits of information.
This icon highlights money-saving tips and/or great deals.
This icon highlights the best the destination has to offer in all categories —

Introduction 5

Where to Go from Here
Because I break up this book into easily digestible parts and chapters,
turn right to the section that interests you. If you’re anxious to read
about Hurricane Katrina, turn to Chapter 2. If you already know when
you’re going to New Orleans and where you’re staying, for example, skip
to Part IV (though you may want to make a pit stop at Chapters 5 and 8).
If you’ve been to New Orleans before and know your way around, jump
straight to Parts IV and V to look for the latest information on attrac-
tions, sights, and clubs affected by Katrina, plus places that may be new
to you.

New Orleans

In this part . . . 
S
o you want to visit New Orleans, eh? Well, good, because
the city can use your tourist dollars in the wake of
Hurricane Katrina. Hotels are eager to host you, restaurants
are eager to serve you, and locals in general are eager to host
visitors and resume life in this beloved American city.
This part of the book introduces you to New Orleans: You’ll
ﬁnd an overview of the city’s best (Chapter 1) , a necessary
discussion of Katrina and its aftermath (Chapter 2), a brief
rundown of the city’s history and culture (Chapter 3), and
seasonal information to help you decide when to visit
(Chapter 4).

W
hen revising my “Best Of” list for this edition, I was pleasantly
surprised to find that most of my favorites survived or returned
after rebuilding, though there were a few that didn’t make it. The hip
Hotel Monaco — which gave my Catahoula dog, Desoto, the V.I. P(uppy)
treatment a couple years back — closed its doors for good. French
Quarter restaurant Bella Luna, with its lovely view of the Mississippi, is
no more. Long-time family-owned seafood restaurants Sid-Mar’s,
Weaver’s, and Bruning’s — all in my neighborhood — were flooded
beyond repair. And one of my favorite hangouts, Plantation Coffeehouse,
is likely not coming back because the landlord isn’t cooperating with the
owner (who knows his customers would give anything for just one more
sip of their famous iced coffees). Of course, if you travel beyond the
usual tourist areas of the city, you’ll find that every flooded neighbor-
hood lost many favorite and popular places. But locals (myself included)
are focused on what survived and what is to come.
For more information on the hotels, restaurants, clubs, museums, and
romantic spots noted in this chapter, look for the Best of the Best icon
throughout the book.
The Best Hotels
 For historic charm, the Hotel Monteleone boasts quite a history
as the oldest and largest hotel in the French Quarter. Maison
Dupuy carries the distinction of once being home to the world’s
first cotton press. See Chapter 10.

 For guaranteed pampering, you have two great options in the
Central Business District. Old-line Le Pavillon offers everything
from complimentary hors d’oeuvres to shoeshines. International
House (built in 1906 to accommodate the world’s first trade center)
exemplifies New Orleans’s talent for adapting older buildings from
their original use (or a state of outright neglect) into unique lodg-
ing. See Chapter 10.
 The Ritz-Carlton is happily slated to reopen just as we go to print.
The hotel is an ambitious renovation of a one-time New Orleans
institution, the Maison Blanche department store, and signifies a
return to Canal Street’s glory days. See Chapter 10.
 Smaller but equally impressive is the recently renovated Block-
Keller House, which gives a taste of how Mid-City will look as the
Canal streetcar works its restoration magic down the line. See
Chapter 10.
The Best Restaurants
 For Cajun and Creole, try Emeril Lagasse’s flagship restaurant,
Emeril’s, where you can taste what he calls “new New Orleans cui-
sine.” Or if you’re a traditionalist, try Antoine’s, Arnaud’s, or Paul
Prudhomme’s K-Paul’s Louisiana Kitchen. See Chapter 11.
 Dine at one of first-rate restaurants from the city’s dining dynasty,
the Brennan Family, including Bacco and Brennan’s, both located
in the French Quarter. Their Garden District jewel, Commander’s
Palace, reopened in 2006 to great fanfare. See Chapter 11.
 Stroll and nosh: Eat a greasy, roast-beef po’ boy from Elizabeth’s,
an overstuffed muffuletta from Central Grocery, a plateful of
shucked oysters from Acme Oyster House, a hamburger from Port
of Call or Clover Grill, and a breakfast of beignets — a tasty fried
doughnut — at Café du Monde. See Chapter 11.
The Best Museums
 To discover more about its New Orleans’s origins, and the city’s
storied (and often sordid) past, visit the Cabildo, an entertaining
museum focusing on life in early Louisiana and the site where the
Louisiana Purchase was sold to the United States in 1803. See
Chapter 12.
 Go to the Chalmette Battlefield National Park, which marks the
site of the Battle of New Orleans, part of the War of 1812. The park
also contains a cemetery for Civil War soldiers. See Chapter 12.
Part 1: Introducing New Orleans 
10

 Ride the Canal Streetcar to Mid-City’s New Orleans Museum
of Art, which boasts beauty inside and out with its extraordinary
Besthoff Sculpture Garden. Both attractions have rebounded
from the storm thanks to the support of art lovers worldwide. See
Chapter 12.
The Best Clubs
 Get a taste of modern-day brass bands getting funky at down-
and-dirty hangouts Donna’s Bar & Grill and Funky Butt. See
Chapter 17.
 Catch live jazz at local clubs Snug Harbor and Sweet Lorraine’s.
Enjoy R&B at hallowed halls such as Tipitina’s and the Maple Leaf.
See Chapter 17.
 Jam to cajun and zydeco tunes (popular music of southern
Louisiana that combines French, Caribbean, and blues music —
with guitar, washboard, and accordion) at the Maple Leaf or at the
world’s most musical bowling alley and celebrity haunt, Mid City
Lanes Rock ’n’ Bowl. See Chapter 17.
The Best Romantic Experiences
 Stroll along the lush scenery of the Garden District and the rolling
expanse of water and parkway at the Moonwalk. See Chapter 12.
 Take your love on a carriage ride through the French Quarter or
a relaxing riverboat cruise along the gently rolling Mississippi.
See Chapter 12.
 Reserve a dinner for two at always cozy Court of Two Sisters and
Feelings Café. For details, see Chapter 11.

Examining Hurricane
Katrina and Its Aftermath
In This Chapter
 Understanding pre-Katrina conditions and why the levees failed
 Examining a timeline of the storm, both during and after
 Seeing post-Katrina New Orleans through an insider’s eyes
 Finding more information about the city’s recovery
 Donating money
O
n August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina changed the city of New
Orleans forever. Its impact will be felt for years, perhaps even gen-
erations, to come.
More than 80 percent of the city flooded and the brackish water lingered
for weeks. When Hurricane Rita followed soon thereafter, neighborhoods
that had finally drained and dried out flooded yet again because the
levee repairs were not complete. Despite such widespread devastation,
the people of New Orleans are working hard to make it better than ever.
The purpose of this chapter is to give you some much-needed context
using timelines, maps, and more. Most likely, your knowledge of Katrina’s
effect on the city stems from the near-constant mainstream television
and newspaper coverage during the weeks immediately after the storm.
Some media outlets did a more thorough job of reporting the facts than
others. I hope this chapter will help you better understand these facts
by presenting the events as they unfolded. I offer my own opinion in a
separate box called “My two cents: The author sounds off,” on p. 32.
Before the Storm
It was a well-known fact that New Orleans could drown under the right
circumstances. Considering its geography, aged levee protection system,
and past close calls with other storms, most locals feared it was
inevitable — yet warnings were never taken seriously by the proper
authorities.

A city below sea level
You may be surprised to learn that New Orleans is older than the United
States of America. You can locate it just upriver from the mouth of the
Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, with Lake Pontchartrain to the north;
it was founded by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in 1718. The city
was an ideal port. Decades before that, Sieur de la Salle had explored the
Mississippi River and claimed all lands drained by the river for the
French. (He named this territory Louisiana after his king, Louis XIV.)
Bienville named his new city La Nouvelle Orléans (New Orleans) after
Philippe, Duc d’Orléans.
The original footprint of the city was quite small, encompassing the area
now known as the French Quarter. Part of the attraction of this location
was the high ground found along a crescent-shaped bend on the East
bank of the Mississippi. As the population grew, however, the surround-
ing swamps and wetlands were drained and natural waterways and
bayous were filled in to make way for new developments. So in general,
older neighborhoods that hugged the river, such as the French Quarter,
Faubourg Marigny, Bywater and parts of Uptown, stayed dry during
Katrina. Newer sections of the city, such as Gentilly, Lakeview, and New
Orleans East, tended to be one to six feet (or more) below sea level and
were at risk of minor street-flooding during even a typical thunderstorm.
Despite this “soup bowl effect,” the city has survived for nearly 300
years thanks to a natural defense of barrier islands, a buffer zone of wet-
lands and swamp, natural levees, and more recently, manmade levees.
A look at the levees
The word levee is French for “raised,” and it originated in colonial
Louisiana to describe the steep mounds of dirt, buffered by vegetation
to prevent erosion, that border a body of water. This is one of the oldest
and most common forms of flood control in the world.
By the late 19th century (before the levees were built), wealthier people
tended to live on higher ground by the river, and poorer people were
clustered in lower lying areas. For the latter, occasional flooding in their
neighborhoods was a part of life. Around this time, the City of New
Orleans created a drainage plan and the Sewerage and Water Board was
in charge of instituting it in the early 20th century.
The massive flood of 1927 (see “The City’s Disaster History,” below),
during which the Mississippi breached its natural levees in many places
upriver, changed everything. In the past, a city had created a levee
around its borders but no one had constructed a connected levee pro-
tection system down the length of the river. The Army Corps of
Engineers was given responsibility for flood control for the entire
Mississippi River Valley. As a result, the Mississippi River boasts one of
the most extensive levee systems in the United States.

Part I: Introducing New Orleans 
14
Lake Pontchartrain is the second-largest saltwater lake in the United
States after the Great Salt Lake in Utah. It was formed from part of the
Gulf, trapped by the Mississippi River Delta as deposits of silt piled up
over thousands of years. The lake did not have natural levees per se,
but the south shore — which is the New Orleans side — was probably
the result of a river tributary. During the Great Depression of the 1930s,
the Works Progress Administration made numerous improvements 
to the city, including a massive lake reclamation project. A seawall was
built hundreds of yards away from the natural shore, and sand was
pumped to fill it in. This area was 10 feet above sea level and served
two purposes; it offered levee-like protection from hurricane storm
surge and it allowed the city to expand and build additional residential
neighborhoods. Subdivisions built in this area did not flood during
Katrina; however, they were an island amid total destruction.
In the decades before Katrina, New Orleans grew increasingly depend-
ent on manmade levees for a number of reasons. For one, the Louisiana
coastline is steadily eroding due to previous storms and saltwater
intrusion. Also, the manmade levees prevent the Mississippi River from
naturally overflowing its banks and depositing silt to rebuild the coast-
line. Instead, the silt drains down into the Gulf of Mexico.
The levees controlled flooding from both the Mississippi River (to the
south) and Lake Pontchartrain (to the north). Popular bike and run-
ning paths follow the top of many of the levees for miles, allowing for

one of the most scenic routes in and around New Orleans. When
Hurricane Betsy hit in 1965 (see “The city’s disaster history” below),
flooding much of the city, the Corps was instructed by Congress to build
an official line of defense: the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane
Protection Levee. However, for the past 40 years, the project has
remained incomplete because Congress never appropriated the neces-
sary funds. It’s hard not to imagine how many lives could’ve been saved
during Katrina if this had been finished years ago as originally intended.
Of course, that is assuming that the Corps of Engineers properly designed
and implemented the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection
Levee. On June 1, 2006, the Corps publicly admitted faulty levee design and
construction led to the unprecedented flooding throughout the Greater
New Orleans area. This confession came as a much-needed salve to New
Orleanians, especially in the face of criticism from some people around the
country for choosing to live in a flood-risk area. It also allowed locals to
move past the blame and plan for a better future, one that should include
solid levee protection.
The city’s disaster history
New Orleans has experienced its share of natural and manmade disas-
ters, from fires to hurricanes to yellow fever epidemics. Below are the
major events that tested its citizens’ survival skills:
 1788 and 1794: Fire destroyed 80 percent of the city, including
much of the French Quarter and its French Colonial buildings. The
ruling Spanish rebuilt it, hence the tiled flat roofs, pastel-hued
stucco and ironwork balconies that are hallmarks of the Quarter
even today.
 1853–1855: In three years’ time, an acute viral disease commonly
known as yellow fever claimed 12,944 victims. At the time, no one
knew what caused it; later it was discovered that infected female
mosquitoes passed it on to humans. Today, a 10-year vaccine is
available, although yellow fever epidemics continue to occur in
Africa, South and Central America and the Caribbean.
 1858: Yellow fever killed 4,845 people.
 1867: Yellow fever claimed 3,107 lives.
 1878: Yellow fever victims numbered 4,046.
 1905: The last major yellow fever epidemic occurred, during which
437 people died.
 1927: Swollen with water from heavy rains up north, the
Mississippi River broke through levees all along its route. In a mis-
guided attempt to save New Orleans, dynamite was used to blow
up a levee north of the city which consequently flooded St. Bernard
Parish and stranded thousands of poor residents. Later, it was
determined that the dynamite was unnecessary as breaches further
Chapter 2: Examining Hurricane Katrina and Its Aftermath 15

north drained much of the excess water flow. Given this incident in
1927, many locals in 2005 questioned whether levees had been pur-
posely weakened again after Katrina.
 1965: Hurricane Betsy was a strong Category 3 storm known as
“Billion-Dollar Betsy” as it was the first hurricane to cause more
than $1 billion dollars in damage (which would be $10–$12 billion
today). Storm surge forced water from Lake Pontchartrain into
neighborhoods such as Gentilly, the Upper Ninth Ward, and the
Lower Ninth Ward, and parts of St. Bernard Parish. Some residents
drowned in the attics of their one-story homes because they-
couldn’t get to the roof. Later, locals were encouraged to keep an
axe in the attic.
 1969: Hurricane Camille made initial landfall near the mouth of the
Mississippi as a Category 5 storm, which made it the second most
intense landfall by a U.S. hurricane (Katrina is third). The
Mississippi coastline suffered the most damage thanks to a 24-foot
storm surge. In total, Camille killed 259 people and caused $1.4 bil-
lion in damage. Before Katrina, this hurricane was the benchmark
by which all other storms were measured.
 1998: At its strongest, Hurricane Georges was a Category 5 storm
that was barreling toward New Orleans, but it veered off toward
Mississippi at the last moment.
Repeated warnings
In 2001, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) predicted
that one of the three “likeliest, most catastrophic disasters facing this
country” would be a major hurricane targeting New Orleans. And yet,
this same agency proved to be woefully under-prepared when faced with
the real thing, when Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast in 2005.
In June 2002, the Times-Picayune published a five-part series called
“Washing Away” that warned of the city’s vulnerability. “It’s only a
matter of time before South Louisiana takes a direct hit from a major
hurricane. Billions have been spent to protect us, but we grow more vul-
nerable every day,” the paper reported, predicting details of the hurri-
cane and the aftermath with chilling accuracy. You can read the report at
www.nola.com/hurricane/?/washingaway.
During the Storm: A Timeline of Events
This section is designed to give you the facts about the disaster as it
unfolded. I’ve organized the events by date, categorized into four main
time periods; each section contains a brief description of the main events
for that time period, followed by a few other specific dates and events.

August 23–25: Hurricane formation 
and initial landfall
August 23: Hurricane Katrina began innocuously enough, like so many
storms before it. A tropical depression developed over the southeastern
Bahamas, labeled Tropical Depression Twelve.

Katrina in context: An interview 
with tour guide Rebecca Sell
Rebecca Sell gives walking tours of the French Quarter through the Friends of the
Cabildo. She gave the editor of this guide a tour in June 2006 and was extremely
knowledgeable and engaging. We followed up with her to ask about Katrina and the
future of the city.
How would you characterize Hurricane Katrina’s devastation in historical terms? Is
this the greatest challenge the city has ever faced?
Rebecca Sell: Historically, no I don’t think this is the greatest challenge the city has
ever faced. The two devastating fires of the 1700s were only six years apart. The first
one was in 1788, and it burned 80 percent of the city to the ground in a day. That is
similar to what happened after the levees broke last summer, and 80 percent of the city
was inundated with water. The yellow fever plagues of the 1800s were horrible as
well. In our worst year, 1853, we lost 10,000 to the disease. That was one in ten people
living in the city. I can’t imagine how devastating and frightening that must have been.
I do think that Hurricane Katrina, or rather the failure of the levees, will be considered
the greatest catastrophe of the century.
Why was the city built on sinking marsh land? Did early settlers realize the poten-
tial for future floods?
RS: I can only speculate that yes, they realized the potential for disaster, but the value
of a port near the mouth of the Mississippi River far outweighed any risk. I think that
many people forget that New Orleans is more than great food, music, and culture. Its
greatest asset is the port. The Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico are the two
reasons that the city was founded in the first place, and it has been a love-hate rela-
tionship ever since. The Quarter sits on the highest land in the city, so the French did
attempt to protect the population somewhat. I should add that most of the neighbor-
hoods that flooded during Katrina were our 20th-century neighborhoods. I have seen
maps of the flooding and maps of early New Orleans; the dry areas were the oldest
neighborhoods.

Part I: Introducing New Orleans

What are your predictions for the future of New Orleans? Will rising rent be a major
factor in determining who repopulates the area?
RS: I think that New Orleans has a long way to go in terms of recovery. It really is a tale
of two cities. As far as tourists are concerned, the Quarter and any place they would
like to visit are fine. We encourage them to come down and enjoy the city. We then
encourage them to seek out the surrounding devastation and get a firsthand look at
the challenges facing us today.
Rising rent is definitely a problem. In most neighborhoods they have doubled or tripled
in a matter of months. That’s a staggering blow to someone who may have lost their
job and everything they own because of the storm. Part of what makes New Orleans
unique is her bohemian population. Unfortunately, rising rents are forcing many of
these creative people — as well as the middle class — to settle elsewhere. It’s not just
the renters though; lack of insurance is another issue. Some homeowners are finding
that they can no longer get, or afford, insurance for their property. This is a major prob-
lem that must be dealt with if the city hopes to make any kind of a comeback.
What was your personal experience with Hurricane Katrina? Did you get out of the
city, and was your living space damaged?
RS: No, I did not get out of the city. My husband and I evacuated to a three-story build-
ing in the Quarter. It was absolutely terrifying. Imagine sitting in darkness for hours, lis-
tening to the storm rage outside, not knowing if the building was about to be ripped to
pieces, or if rising floodwaters were about to chase us into the attic. When the levees
broke, it was total chaos. We managed to get out the Wednesday after and eventually
found ourselves staying with family in the Midwest for six weeks. That entire time, we
didn’t know where our friends were, if we had a home or any possessions . . . if there
was anything for us to return to. We were in total limbo. The anxiety was terrible.
Our living space was damaged, but not so badly that we could not return. We made
the place livable again and tried to make a go of it. A few months later, I lost my source
of income due to the crippled post-storm economy. That is how I came to work for the
Friends of the Cabildo, and I feel very fortunate for that opportunity. Now, a year later,
we have found that we are being priced out of our neighborhood. This disaster is an
ongoing source of stress for everyone affected.
How often do you give tours, and where can a visitor book one?
RS: The Friends of the Cabildo, which is the organization I work for, offer French
Quarter walking tours Thursday through Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. These tours
meet at the 1850 House Museum Store located at 523 St. Ann Street on Jackson
Square. We do not take reservations and ask guests to arrive 15 minutes prior to
departure to purchase tickets. For more information, visitors may call % 504-523-3939.
I also highly recommend Gray Line’s Hurricane Katrina Tour, which runs daily. Gray
Line’s number is % 504-569-1401.
(continued)

August 25: Katrina was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane and made
landfall near Hallandale Beach, Florida. Though expected to travel west,
it moved south along the coastline to Miami, taking six lives and causing
major tree damage.
August 26–28: Crossing the Gulf
As Katrina approached, many locals didn’t pay much attention to it.
Once it made landfall in southern Florida, meteorologists and talking
heads predicted it would curl up and hit the Florida panhandle.
August 26: The National Hurricane Center (NHC) announced a shift in
the possible path, which headed toward the Louisiana/Mississippi coast.
Late that evening, the NHC predicted it would hit Buras, Louisiana, only
66 miles southeast of New Orleans. After traveling across Florida,
Katrina had weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm.
August 27: Katrina again strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane at 5am.
Later that day, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco asked President Bush to
declare a federal state of emergency for the state of Louisiana, which he
did, putting FEMA in charge of relief efforts. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin
called for a “voluntary evacuation” and announced that the Superdome
would be opened as a shelter of last resort. (The Superdome had previ-
ously served as a shelter during Hurricane Georges, with mixed results;
people were detained there for days, even though the hurricane narrowly
missed the city, and many grew frustrated and vandalized the property.)
August 28: Hurricane Katrina reached Category 4 intensity, with winds
up to 145 mph, just after midnight. At a 10 a.m. press conference, Nagin
announced the first mandatory evacuation in New Orleans’ history,
which was heeded by thousands of people, some of whom were already
in the process of leaving.
August 29–September 1: Louisiana and Mississippi
landfalls, breach of levees and flooding
August 29: Early in the morning, Katrina made its second landfall in
Buras, Louisiana, as predicted by the National Hurricane Center the pre-
vious day. Though the hurricane was downgraded to a Category 3, this
slim finger of land was decimated by sustained winds up to 125 mph and
storm surge from the Gulf. A few hours later, Katrina crossed Breton
sound and made its third and final landfall in Pearlington, Mississippi.
In the meantime, around 8 a.m., the first evidence of levee breaches in
New Orleans was reported as water rose on either side of the Industrial
Canal. By 9 a.m., the Lower Ninth Ward was inundated by 6 to 8 feet of
water and New Orleans East was submerged as well. Two hours later, 
St. Bernard Parish, to the east of New Orleans, was under 10 feet of
water. At 11 a.m., local authorities announced the breach at the 17th
Street Canal, which flooded (my neighborhood) Lakeview, and combined

with breaches at the London Street Canal, completely drowning Mid-City
to the southeast and Gentilly to the east. All three residential areas
received up to 12 feet of water.
August 30: By this time, it was clear that the city’s drainage pumps were
quickly overwhelmed as water continued to pour in from the lake. The
focus turned in earnest to rescuing stranded survivors. For days there-
after, thousands of people were saved from flooded homes and buildings
by both civilians and the U.S. Coast Guard. Looting also became wide-
spread and Gov. Blanco requested federal troops to help bring law and
order back to the city. She also ordered hundreds of buses to the area;
they eventually evacuated more than 15,000 people by September 1.
August 31: Sandbagging efforts at the breaches had failed and an
unprecedented 80 percent of the City of New Orleans was under water.
President George W. Bush left his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and flew
directly to Washington; he was criticized after widely published photos
showed him looking down at the devastation from the air.
Mayor Nagin ordered the New Orleans Police Department to stop search
and rescue efforts in order to prevent further looting and uphold a
curfew. At this point, 8,300 National Guardsmen were on duty in the Gulf
Coast.

September 1: The country’s attention turned to the thousands of citi-
zens who went to the Superdome as a shelter of last resort. Living condi-
tions had deteriorated considerably, there was no longer any food or
water, and some instances of violence were reported.
(The Times-Picayune later noted that these stories of violence and death
in the Superdome were greatly exaggerated; some in the media referred
to up to 200 dead bodies, though only 4 were found in the vicinity. “As
the fog of war-like conditions in Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath has
cleared, the vast majority of reported atrocities committed by evacuees
have turned out to be false, or at least unsupported by any evidence,
according to key military, law enforcement, medical and civilian officials
in positions to know,” Times-Picayune, 9/26/06.)

Timeline of the flooding in New Orleans
The following text is taken from the “Flash Flood” interactive graphic at www.nola.
com/katrina/graphics/flashflood.swf, reprinted with permission from
the Times-Picayune. All events occurred between August 29 and September 1, 2005.
You’ll find a map illustrating these events on p. 22, with bullets that correspond to the
ones mentioned below.
August 29, 2005
4:30 a.m.: Rising water in the Industrial Canal leaks through damaged gates into neigh-
borhoods on both sides of the I-10 High Rise. The flow is minor compared to what is
in store for these areas. See 1.
5:00 a.m.: Katrina’s storm surge begins pounding the MR-GO levee. By dawn, levee
sections crumble and Lake Borgne advances into wetlands toward St. Bernard Parish.
See 2.
6:10 a.m.: Katrina makes landfall at Buras. A wall of water 21 feet high crosses the
Mississippi River and its levees, inundating most of Plaquemines Parish.
6:30 am: Surge builds in the Intracoastal Waterway’s “funnel,” and levees protecting
Eastern New Orleans are overtopped and breached. Soon, the area is under water.
See 3. To the west, witnesses report sections of the 17th Street Canal levee wall are
leaning toward Lakeview. Water leaks through cracks in the wall into the neighbor-
hood. See 4.
6:50 a.m.: Storm surge from the “funnel” reaches the Industrial Canal. Water overtops
floodwalls and levels on both sides, but the worst is still ahead. See 5.
7:30 a.m.: Levee wall panels on the west side of the Industrial Canal breach, flooding
the Upper Ninth Ward, Bywater and Treme. See 5.
7:45 a.m.: Two floodwall sections on the east side of the Industrial Canal fall, releas-
ing a wall of water into the Lower NinthWard, tossing homes and cars around like
toys. The water also pours into Arabi and Chalmette. See 5.
8:30 a.m.: Lake Borgne advances to St. Bernard Parish’s second line of defense, easily
topping the 7-foot to 9-foot 40-Arpent Canal levee and filling neighborhoods from
Poydras to Chalmette. See 6. To the north, a one mile stretch of floodwall on the south
side of Lakefront Airport is topped by surge from Lake Pontchartrain, adding to already
severe flooding in eastern New Orleans. See 7.
9 a.m.: Surge rises to 10 feet in the London Avenue Canal and levee wall panels on
both sides start bending. Water leaks into yards, but the flow is still minor. See 8.
About two miles west, surge reaches an embankment at the foot of the Orleans
Avenue Canal that is 6 feet lower than the floodwalls. Water tops the embankment
and pours into City Park.
9:30 a.m.: I-wall panels on the east side of the London Avenue Canal fail, releasing a
wall of water and sand into homes and expanding the flooding of Gentilly. See 8.

Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff was widely criticized for
not knowing about the thousands of people who had flocked to the
Ernest N. Convention Center and who were without any provisions.
National Guardsmen and much-needed supplies arrived at the
Superdome.
People desperate to get out of the city attempted to cross the Crescent
City Connection over the Mississippi River, but police with the City of
Gretna on the West Bank closed off access. Evacuees charged it was an
act of racism, but police chief claimed Gretna could not handle an influx
of storm victims from New Orleans.
September–October 2005: Dealing
with immediate crisis
September 2: President Bush signed a $10.5-billion relief package and
discussed the possibility of a federal takeover of the New Orleans 
evacuation.
Later that night, during a live “Concert for Hurricane Relief” on NBC,
rapper Kanye West departed from the teleprompter script and said,
“George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” which prompted a
national debate about race and Katrina.
Chapter 2: Examining Hurricane Katrina and Its Aftermath 25
9:45 a.m.: Several 17thStreet Canal levee wall panels fail, releasing a roaring torrent
of water into Lakeview. Water from this breach eventually fills much of midtown New
Orleans and parts of Metarie. See 8. On the north shore, Katrina makes landfall near
Slidell. Storm surge is 15 feet at the Lake Pontchartrain shoreline and reaches more
than five miles inland at some points. St. Tammany Parish neighborhoods from the
Rigolets all the way to Madisonville are flooded.
10:30 a.m.: I-wall panels on the west side of the London Avenue Canal are pushed over,
adding 8 feet of water to flooded Gentilly and contributing to rising water across the
city. See 8. Parts of Jefferson Parish also flood as rainwater leaks through an
unstaffed pumping system. See 9.
August 29–September 1, 2005
With Katrina’s eye north of the city and moving away quickly, surge levels drop and
levee overtopping ceases. But Lake Pontchartrain remains swollen, and water con-
tinues bleeding into the city until the lake level equalizes with the floodwaters at
midday on September 1.

September 4: The last people were evacuated from the Superdome by
bus to the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Other survivors were
transported from the Convention Center and along the raised highways
to the Cajundome in Lafayette, Louisiana, and other in-state shelters.
But there were still more storm victims, including pets, in flooded homes
and buildings throughout the area. By this time much of the media,
including the city’s two newspaper offices, had been forced to go to
higher ground. National reporters embedded themselves where they
could and showed images of a drowning city and its desperate citizens.
Sean Penn was seen in a small boat with several friends and journalists,
rescuing locals. Though initial reports claimed his boat sprung a leak,
historian Douglas Brinkley later told Larry King on CNN that the boat
was merely overloaded and taking in water, and that he and Penn saved
up to 40 people.
September 6: Despite the mandatory evacuation still being in effect,
many people on dry land had refused to leave, so Nagin ordered a forced
evacuation of any holdouts for public safety reasons. Many of these
people stayed anyway, determined to thwart possible looters, or protect
pets because they didn’t realize how bad the damage was throughout
the city.
As rescue efforts continued, the levee breaches were gradually addressed;
the canals were sealed off from the lake with sheet pilings, and sandbags
were piled up on the breaches themselves.
September 9: Secretary Chertoff removed FEMA Director Michael Brown
from overseeing any further Katrina relief efforts.
September 12: Brown officially resigned.
One week later, Nagin had tentatively begun allowing residents to return 
to one area of the city, Algiers, on the nonflooded West Bank. However,
Hurricane Rita threatened the city and he again ordered another manda-
tory evacuation. This storm made landfall further west, near the Louisiana-
Texas border, but its storm surge caused flooding in parts of southeast
Louisiana that had remained dry during Katrina and reflooded other areas
where the levee breaches were incomplete.

A music lounge owner returns and rebuilds
The following is from the exhibit “Come Hell and High Water: Portraits of Hurricane
Katrina Survivors,” first shown at the at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art (925 Camp
St.; % 504-539-9600) in the summer of 2006. Thomas Neff, a Professor of Art at LSU’s
School of Art, photographed nearly 200 hurricane survivors with a 5x7 inch view
camera. He spent 45 days in the city and slept in his van for 21 nights. 

Chapter 2: Examining Hurricane Katrina and Its Aftermath 27
Although Antoinette was deter-
mined to protect the lounge and
care for her disabled niece, seven
days of fear and isolation were
enough. After flagging the National
Guard from an upstairs window, they
were taken by boat to an I-10 on-
ramp, bussed to the airport, and
flown out of state. When her dear
friends, Savannah-Rose I and II, DJs
by trade, discovered that Antoinette
had been taken to parts unknown,
they launched a frantic search. One
month passed before she was
found—living in a Boy Scout camp
near Atlanta. Antoinette had been
gone about five weeks, but when
she returned to the lounge, saw the
damage, and smelled the rankness
and mold, she totally lost it.
As she reflected to me on her life
with Ernie, author of the famous
song “Mother-in-Law,” and recalled
her part in resurrecting his career a
decade before he died—reclaiming
his honorable title, “Emperor of the World”—she began to feel renewed hope.
Together they had transformed the lounge, with its brightly painted murals, into a New
Orleans cultural treasure, as evidenced by a bronze plaque from the city mounted on
the front door. She also realized that she could bring the lounge back again, even if she
had to do it alone. With renewed strength and confidence about her own future, as
well as the future of New Orleans and its musical heritage, she began the arduous
task of gutting the ruined interior. 
Antoinette’s effort to rebuild gained force when the lounge became the first project
undertaken by the Hands On network; a group of sixty national and international vol-
unteer organizations whose role focuses on entrepreneurial civic action. When the
project was less than half complete, Hands On partner and Hip-Hop superstar Usher
visited the site one Sunday in May and asked the team leader to finish the project at
his expense, including the second-floor apartment. Antoinette was overwhelmed by
this outpouring of support and reverence the world was showing for Ernie’s legacy
and his music.
On August 29, 2006, a gala event took place to reopen the newly restored Mother-in-
Law Lounge. In typical New Orleans style, an open casket was on hand for guests to
deposit a written memory of Hurricane Katrina. Once filled with memento mori, it was
then buried right next to the lounge, on a site previously occupied by Ernie’s Pink
Cadillac Limo.

October 5: Most flooded neighborhoods were finally reopened to resi-
dents; some returned, anxious to see the damage inflicted on their homes
and belongings. Many others remained in shelters for months afterward
throughout the country as they awaited news of friends and relatives, the
fate of their homes and employers, and the city itself. By this point, it was
estimated that 1.5 million people had evacuated for Katrina.

November 2005–present: Cleanup, 
recovery, and long-term planning
November 21: A group of homeowners whose properties flooded appear
at the state capitol in Baton Rouge to support new legislation calling for
a single unified levee district (instead of seven) in hopes of removing
perceived corruption and complacency.
November 30: Residents from the most devastated neighborhoods are
outraged when the Urban Land Institute’s report recommends that post-
Katrina rebuilding efforts focus on nonflooded areas of the city and
abandon low lying neighborhoods altogether.
December 22: The watchdog group Bureau of Governmental Research
criticizes Mayor Nagin’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission for consid-
ering a Catch-22 proposal. The report, still being drafted and yet to be
released, eventually recommends that everyone be given the opportunity
to rebuild regardless of location. The draft notes that neighborhoods
have one year to prove sustainability or properties will be bought out by
the city. Needless to say, this recommendation proves as unpopular as
the Urban Land Institute’s plan.
January 16, 2006: In response to concerns that New Orleans would 
permanently lose many of its African-American citizens who evacuated,
Nagin stated in a Martin Luther King Day speech that it would be a
“chocolate city” again. Though the phrase was a reference to a 1975
album of the same name by Parliament and has positive connotations,
the reaction to the mayor’s speech was overwhelmingly negative.
February 28: The city celebrated Mardi Gras Day on a smaller scale. Many
floats had politically charged names and themes, including “The Headless
State,” “Homeland Insecurity,” and “The Pigs of Patronage.” “The Inferno”
depicted President Bush as a horned devil, and showed Blanco, Nagin, and
Brown as cooks brewing a giant pot of human gumbo in the Superdome.
March 25: Charity Hospital, the city’s only Level 1 trauma center, was
permanently closed.
April 27: The Louisiana Recovery Authority approved a $7.5 billion
“Road Home” plan that allows homeowners to rebuild their storm-
damaged homes.

May 20: Despite criticism and opposition, Nagin was re-elected Mayor
for a second term.
June 1: The Army Corps of Engineers published a 6,113-page report admit-
ting flaws in the design and implementation of the levee system, which
resulted in most of the flooding during Katrina. “The hurricane protection
system in New Orleans and southeast Louisiana was a system in name
only,” the report stated. The report noted that, in some cases, floodwalls
that should have contained the water instead tilted enough to shift the
grounds, and this allowed water to rush underneath. Thus the water
breached the levees from below, not from above. Chief engineer of the Army
Corps, Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock told the New York Times, “[The report] is what
it is. Call it a mea culpa, or call it a dry recognition, or admission, or what-
ever — but we’re not ducking our accountability and responsibility in this.”
June 20: Gov. Blanco called in the Louisiana National Guard to patrol
flooded neighborhoods where looting and squatting run rampant, and
ordered the NOPD to focus on nonflooded areas.
July 15: Actor Brad Pitt toured the devastated Lower Ninth Ward to help
raise awareness of the neighborhood’s plight.
August 8: The Society of American Military Engineers, primarily com-
prised of Corps of Engineers employees, presented the Wheeler Medal to
Walter Baumy for overseeing the “restoration of more than 169 miles of
ravaged hurricane protection systems, 68 pumping stations and 4 water
control structures” between August 29, 2005, and June 1, 2006. Many
New Orleanians complained that the Corps was rewarding itself for work
that was caused by its own past levee blunders.
August 11: Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, commander and chief engineer of the
Army Corps of Engineers, announced his retirement “based on family
and personal reasons.”
August 22: Nonprofit New Orleans-based organization LEVEES.org
observed the “Anniversary of the Worst Engineering Disaster in U.S.
History” and released a report on the Corps’ performance.
September 25: Saints beat the Falcons in football season opener, which
received national attention. President Bush flipped the coin to open the
game, and U2 and Green Day performed at half time. Even Falcons coach
Jim Mora acknowledged the significance of the Saints’ win: “As tough as it
is to lose a game, I’d be lying if I said there isn’t a little, little, little piece of
me that didn’t appreciate what this game meant to this city. It meant a lot.” 
Names in the News
Here are just a few of the people who played a part in New Orleans’ wel-
fare during and immediately after the storm. Other folks are currently
contributing in some way to the recovery and rebuilding efforts.
Chapter 2: Examining Hurricane Katrina and Its Aftermath 29

Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen: Chief of Staff of the U.S. Coast Guard, Allen
replaced former FEMA director Michael Brown on Sept. 11, 2005, after
Brown resigned amid criticism for FEMA’s response to Katrina victims.
Marty Bahamonde: He is the FEMA regional director whose urgent first-
hand accounts of the Katrina devastation to New Orleans were report-
edly ignored by his boss, Michael Brown (who sent him there), and
higher ups. A T-shirt, “Marty for Mayor,” was created in his honor during
the mayoral campaign of 2006.
Kathleen Babineaux Blanco: She is the current Governor of Louisiana and
the first woman to hold this post. After former FEMA Director Michael
Brown stepped down, he was quoted as saying, “Blanco reminded me of
an aunt I have whom I love to pieces. But I would never trust this aunt to
run a state . . . I just see Blanco as this really nice woman who is just way
beyond her level of ability” (Times-Picayune, 5/3/06). Blanco clashed with
President Bush several times during the height of the Katrina crisis (as
detailed in Douglas Brinkley’s book, The Great Deluge). As we go to print,
she is not backing down from her demand that the state receive offshore
oil and gas-drilling revenue for much-needed coastal rebuilding.
Douglas Brinkley: This Tulane professor of history was a prolific televi-
sion commentator in the months after Katrina. He is also the author of
The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi
Gulf Coast. In the week after the storm, he joined actor Sean Penn and
several others in a boat to rescue locals.
Michael Brown: The FEMA Director during the hurricane, he was forced
to resign soon thereafter amidst heavy criticism. President Bush infa-
mously told him, “You’re doing a heck of a job, Brownie!”
George W. Bush: President Bush was widely criticized in the wake of
Hurricane Katrina. Though he declared a state of emergency in the Gulf
Coast two days before the hurricane made landfall, later mobilized 
the National Guard and Coast Guard, and signed a bill appropriating
$10.5 billion for relief efforts, many criticized his administration for not
responding fast enough. Bush was also criticized for selecting and sup-
porting Michael Brown as FEMA Director, for flying Air Force One over
the region and not stopping to visit on August 31, 2005, and for giving
what many felt were inappropriately upbeat speeches when he first vis-
ited the area on September 2. (Search for the text of his speeches at
www.whitehouse.gov/news.) In a February 2006 ABC News interview,
Bush admitted some mistakes: “I agree that we didn’t do as good a job as
we could have done on Katrina . . . There was no situational awareness,
and that means that we weren’t getting good, solid information from
people who were on the ground, and we need to do a better job . . . There’s
no question we’ve got more work to do, and our report on Katrina out-
lined the work that needs to be done . . . The chaotic scenes were very
troubling. It was very unsettling for me to realize our fellow citizens were
in near panic wondering where the help was.” (Full text at: http://
abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1671087&page=1.)
Part I: Introducing New Orleans 
30

Joseph Canizaro: The real estate and banking mogul — and friend of
President Bush — was tapped to serve on Mayor Nagin’s Bring New
Orleans Back Commission.
Michael Chertoff: Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, which
oversees FEMA, he developed a bad reputation during the hurricane. He
publicly stated that the Convention Center situation was just a rumor,
and at a press conference, commented that no one could have predicted
such a catastrophic event.
Citizens for 1 Greater New Orleans: Founded by Uptown realtor Ruthie
Frierson in response to what she saw as a lack of clear leadership, this is
a “non-partisan, non-sectarian grassroots initiative formed to be a voice
for reform and renewal for Greater New Orleans and a better Louisiana.”
Visit www.citizensfor1greaterneworleans.com.
Eddie Compass: After 26 years of police service, New Orleans Police
Department superintendent Compass “retired” four weeks after Katrina,
a key time during which officers were criticized for everything from
being disorganized to deserting their positions to looting. He also made
alarming claims about conditions at the Superdome and the Convention
Center that were later found to be untrue.
Anderson Cooper: Host of the CNN show “360˚” and author of Dispatches
From the Edge, Cooper kept New Orleans and the Mississippi coasts’
recovery efforts in the national spotlight months after the hurricane
came ashore.
Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré: A Louisiana native, Honoré was sent to New
Orleans by President Bush to coordinate military relief efforts as com-
mander of the Joint Task Force Katrina. Mayor Nagin described him as a
“John Wayne dude” who got the job done.
Jed Horne: Times-Picayune editor and author of Breach of Faith.
Rep. William Jefferson: He is the U.S. Representative of Louisiana
(D–New Orleans) and the first African-American in this position since
Reconstruction. Jefferson is the subject of a federal investigation for
accepting legislative bribes that predates Katrina and is still ongoing as
of the time of this writing. Immediately after the storm, he was criticized
for inappropriate use of a government vehicle and personnel to check on
his Uptown home after Katrina. In December 2006, he defeated Karen
Carter in a runoff election and held his seat for a ninth term in what the
New York Times called “an astonishing act of political survival” (12/10/06).
Sen. Mary Landrieu: She is a U.S. Senator (D–Louisiana), daughter of
former Mayor Maurice Edwin “Moon” Landrieu, and sister to Louisiana
Lt. Governor and 2006 mayoral candidate Mitch Landrieu. Her New
Orleans home was destroyed by Katrina, and she was a vocal supporter
of the nonprofit organization, Women of the Storm (www.womenofthe
storm.net).
Chapter 2: Examining Hurricane Katrina and Its Aftermath 31

Laura Maloney: Executive Director of the Louisiana SPCA, she efficiently
evacuated animals in the shelter’s care to Texas days before the storm.
She then oversaw an unprecedented animal rescue effort with the help
of staff — many of whom had lost their own homes to flooding — and
hundreds of volunteers around the country, even after the shelter build-
ing was a total loss.
Mayor C. Ray Nagin: Once an executive with Cox Cable, he was elected
to his first political office because voters were tired of experienced politi-
cians’ corruption and patronage. His lack of political experience was later
seen by many as a shortcoming during Katrina. Gov. Blanco described
him as “a total void” during Katrina. He astounded and angered many
locals with his comment that New Orleans be a “chocolate city” again
and that Katrina was God’s punishment for the U.S. invading Iraq. Most
recently, he came under fire for suggesting that an event commemorating
the one-year anniversary of Katrina feature fireworks and a comedy
show. He was narrowly elected to a second term in 2006.

My two cents: The author sounds off
As I write this, one year later, the shock has worn off, allowing anger and sadness to
more readily surface. When my husband and I went to sleep on the evening of Friday,
August 26, 2005, we did not know that our lives and the city we loved would be forever
changed in just a few days’ time. That Friday afternoon, we missed hearing an impor-
tant announcement by the National Hurricane Center that Hurricane Katrina would
most likely not go to the Florida Panhandle and was instead headed toward the
Louisiana/Mississippi coast. We also missed NHC’s late-night update that the storm
was indeed heading right for us.
The next morning, my husband went to his computer and refreshed the Web page he
had left open the night before, showing the predicted path of the hurricane. He
watched in horror as the latest map indicated the path leading directly to New Orleans.
He rushed into the bedroom and woke me up with these words, “Honey, we have to
get out of here.”
For me, Saturday, August 27, alternated between a blur of packing activity and frozen
moments of disbelief and denial. We had evacuated the year before for Hurricane
Ivan without worry, but for some reason, I felt differently this time. I was nervous and
uneasy. In speaking with friends and neighbors, though, it seemed that I might be over-
reacting. Some of them didn’t plan to evacuate, dismissing the media’s projections as
the usual melodrama or saying they remembered being kids in New Orleans during
Betsy or Camille and our neighborhood hadn’t flooded then. We would be safe.
Nevertheless, we didn’t relish the idea of holing up in our house with four large dogs
and two cats for a few days (at most) without electricity. If there was flooding, we
wouldn’t be able to exercise the dogs, either. Evacuation was our best option and we
decided to drive to my parents’ house in the Chicago area and make a mini-vacation
out of it, just as we had the previous year.

Chapter 2: Examining Hurricane Katrina and Its Aftermath 33
We left very early the morning of Sunday, August 28, and took part in what would be
the most successful evacuation in U.S. history thanks to “contraflow” in which
expressways heading into the city were closed off from inbound drivers and instead
diverted to allow outbound traffic. Contraflow was first tested in 2004 and did not go
well because it was implemented far too late; in 2005, the state learned its lesson and
contraflow allowed one million people to smoothly and quickly evacuate prior to the
storm.
We arrived at my parents’ house late that night and settled in for what we thought
would be a nice surprise visit. On Monday, August 29, initial news reports said New
Orleans was lucky once again as the storm had veered to the Mississippi coast. It
wasn’t until later in the day that word spread about the rising water in the city and the
breached levees throughout the city.
When I heard that the 17th Street Canal levee had breached, I found a map and located
17th Street in Metairie. I remember thinking, “Oh, those poor people.” Then I realized
that the canal bordering the west side of my neighborhood, Lakeview, was called the
17th Street Canal and I was in fact one of those poor people whose house was flood-
ing. And what about my friends and neighbors who had stayed behind? Were they in
danger? I began crying and stayed glued to CNN for the next two weeks when I wasn’t
on the phone trying to reach people in hopes that they had made it out.
The images of stranded storm victims looked like something from a movie. How could
the backdrop for these desperate moments — the Superdome, Canal Street, I-10 —
be New Orleans, where I had lived for 12 years and which I knew more intimately than
my hometown up north? Why weren’t these people getting the help they needed? The
lack of local, regional and federal government coordination and assistance absolutely
infuriated me.
Months later, we learned that this “natural” disaster was largely manmade. The Army
Corps of Engineers’ flawed levee design and construction caused this unprecedented
tragedy, in which thousands of people lost their lives and tens of thousands more lost
their homes or livelihoods or beloved family and friends. One year later, New
Orleanians are still waiting for a long overdue apology from the Corps, which is the
next (albeit belated) step after admitting its role in this catastrophe.
Right now, the rebuilding process lacks a strong leader whom the people trust and
respect. You can’t blame us for being skeptical of government at any level. Mayor
Nagin appears to be well intentioned, but I wonder if someone with more experience
could’ve been a more aggressive leader and helped us embrace his or her vision for
a new New Orleans. Between the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, the Urban
Land Institute and other recovery committees, residents are in limbo, unsure which
rebuilding plan will take hold and what exactly our role should be to ensure the future
of the city.
I am impressed with the growing collectives of civic-minded individuals since the
storm. Their grassroots efforts are paying off in getting straight answers from the gov-
ernment about everything from base flood elevation changes and levee protection to
medical care and schools. This experience has changed us, and as long as we remem-
ber the lessons from Katrina, I think New Orleans will not only survive, it will thrive.

Anna Pou, M.D.: This LSU Health Sciences Center staff physician was
arrested along with two nurses for allegedly killing critically ill patients
at Memorial Hospital at the height of the Katrina crisis, which set off a
controversy about mercy killings.
Garland Robinette: A popular WWL radio host, he is best known for his
interview with Mayor Nagin on September 2, 2005, in which an emotional
Nagin told the federal government, “Get off your asses.”
Chris Rose: Times-Picayune columnist and author of one of the most per-
sonal and compelling Katrina books, 1 Dead in Attic. His columns con-
tinue to give voice to locals’ concerns, frustrations and tiny victories as
the city recovers.
Sandy Rosenthal: She is the founder of Levees.org, a nonprofit grassroots
organization designed to keep the Army Corps of Engineers on its toes.
Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock: Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, he retired
in August 2006, citing the failure of the levees in New Orleans as one of
the reasons. In June 2006, the Corps admitted that its faulty levee design
and construction caused the widespread flooding in New Orleans, not
the “overtopping” of the levees that was initially publicized in the weeks
after the storm.
Ivor Von Heerden: He is director of LSU’s Hurricane Center and author
of The Storm.
Anne Milling: She is the founder of Women of the Storm (www.womenofthe
storm.net), a nonprofit grassroots organization comprised of 150 south
Louisiana women. The group extended personal invitations to federal offi-
cials to travel to the state to see Katrina and Hurricane Rita damage first-
hand, and the group paid all expenses. The women are asking Congress to
allow 50 percent of offshore oil and gas revenues generated in Louisiana to
go toward the state’s funds for coastal restoration and protection.
Resources for Further Information
Communication and information proved critical during and after the
storm. Flooding destroyed most of the city’s radio and television sta-
tions, and the Times-Picayune was unable to publish a traditional news-
paper for three days (though it did put out a cyber-edition on the Web).
The Internet allowed the rest of the world to find out what was happen-
ing in the city and keep up with its massive rebuilding efforts even
today. If you would like to learn more about Katrina’s effect on New
Orleans, try the following resources.

recommend just one book to you, I’d choose Breach of Faith (Random
House, 2006), by Times-Picayune staffer Jed Horne. He offers a local’s
perspective and a journalist’s storytelling talent. The editor of this guide
picks the excellent 1 Dead in Attic (Chris Rose Books, 2006), by Chris
Rose, another Times-Picayune writer. This small, widely available book of
short, eloquent essays truly captures the city’s outrage and heartbreak.

Two perspectives on “Devastation Tours”
Author Julia Kamysz Lane: When I first learned of the Katrina disaster tours, I was
horrified and angry. Would tourists take pictures of me standing on what was left of
my porch, my dust mask hanging around my neck and mold and dirt all over my
donated clothes after a day of gutting? I did not want complete strangers to see my
family photos, letters, and journals drying out on the muddy ground that used to be our
lush green yard. I also did not want them to stare at the towering trash pile in front of
our house, filled with everything we once had.
But a fellow Lakeview resident changed my mind. She thought it could only help if the
public saw firsthand what we were going through. Only then would they begin to
understand how many people were affected by the devastation. In turn, they would
recognize how hard we were working to make New Orleans whole again. We hoped
they would be inspired to help us rebuild.
Each tourist who has passed through my neighborhood has been polite and respect-
ful of property. I personally have preferred not to talk to them if I’m working on my
house as it’s too emotional for me, but I appreciate their ongoing concern for us and
the city we love.
If you’re looking to take a bus tour, Gray Line offers the popular 3-hour “Hurricane
Katrina — America’s Worst Catastrophe,” which tours Lakeview, Gentilly, Eastern New
Orleans, and the Ninth Ward, at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily. Tickets are $35 per adult, $28
for children, and $29 per person for groups of 10 or more. Book at least a day in
advance at % 800-535-7786, or visit www.graylineneworleans.com. 
Editor Stephen Bassman: I visited New Orleans in the summer of 2006 (shortly before
editing this guide) as part of a tightly scheduled media tour, so I had no time to book
an official “devastation tour.” Instead, I hailed a taxi outside my French Quarter hotel
early one morning. I asked the driver — Jean, a Haitian man — if he would drive me
around the Lower Ninth Ward. He said he toured the area several times a day and
would take me for $40 an hour.
The images I’d seen on television did not prepare me for the up-close reality. We
passed hundreds of decimated cars piled up under Interstate-10, awaiting impound-
ing. Once in the Lower Ninth Ward, we saw more abandoned cars and the remains of
houses. Some were missing fronts, offering views of their moldy, ruined interiors. One
house had been rocked off its foundation and had landed, unceremoniously, on top of
a car. A few workers were clearing debris from some areas, and patches of this once
crowded — mostly poor, black — neighborhood now resembled barren fields. Jean
drove right up to the levees to point out the breach (now repaired), before driving me
back to the hotel. I asked him if these tours depressed him, and he chuckled nervously
and didn’t respond.
It is difficult to “recommend” these tours, but you won’t get a sense of the storm’s
impact if you stay in the French Quarter. A taxi is easy to hail at any time and less intru-
sive than a large bus. Drivers charge $25 to $60 an hour (feel free to negotiate). Note
that while the Ninth Ward is almost completely destroyed, Lakeview, Gentilly, and
others are rebuilding and offer a few more signs of hope, as Julia communicates.

A
wareness of New Orleans’ history is more crucial than ever in the
wake of Hurricane Katrina, as the city attempts to hold onto its
core identity even as it rebuilds and transitions. In this chapter, I intro-
duce you to New Orleans’ culture and how it came to be, and I recom-
mend some of the books and movies that best evoke its quirky spirit.
History 101: The Main Events
Considering that New Orleans is surrounded by water and was once
mainly swamp, it’s amazing that anyone found any use for it at all. Its
story begins in 1682, when the Sieur de la Salle explored the Mississippi
River and claimed all lands drained by the river for the French. He
named this territory Louisiana after his king, Louis XIV. Nearly 40 years
later, in 1718, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, founded New
Orleans as a strategic port city. He named it La Nouvelle Orléans (New
Orleans) after Philippe, Duc d’Orléans.
The French community that settled along this bend in the river — in a
town 15 feet below sea level — flourished. So it came as a surprise when
in 1762 Louis XIV handed over the Louisiana territory to his Spanish
cousin, King Charles III. It didn’t last long — only until 1800 — but in that
time the French Quarter went up in flames twice and was rebuilt while
under Spanish rule. Much of the French architecture was replaced by
Spanish styles, leaving permanent reminders (such as courtyards and
wrought-iron balconies) of that brief regime. The territory returned to

France, but in 1803 Napoleon secretly sold it to the United States, mark-
ing the historical Louisiana Purchase. By that time, the Caribbean gens
de couleur libre (free people of color) were immigrating to New Orleans
in droves after the Haitian Revolution, adding to the city’s mix of food,
music, and architecture.
As the cotton and tobacco industries grew, New Orleans prospered,
making it the second-wealthiest city in the nation after New York City. The
War of 1812 was resolved in 1815 in the Battle of Orleans. The infamous
pirate Jean Lafitte and General Andrew Jackson joined forces at Chalmette
Battlefield (see Chapter 12) to claim victory over the British. Success,
sophistication, and society reigned, making New Orleans an attractive des-
tination. By the mid-1800s, Louisiana had seceded from the Union and was
the fourth-largest city in the United States. After the end of the Civil War,
carpetbaggers brought even more cultural influences to the Crescent City.
Those years of prosperity slowly faded away as river transportation
became less important and other industries overtook cotton and to-
bacco in profitability. A century after the War Between the States, New
Orleans’s leaders actually considered constructing an expressway along
the Mississippi River and French Quarter. Fortunately, that never hap-
pened, but it reflected the city’s desperation to regain what it had lost.
The oil bust of the 1980s negatively impacted the New Orleans economy,

continued to thrive, encouraging the talent of musicians, chefs, and
other creative entrepreneurs. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the local
community enjoyed a cultural renaissance. After hurricane Katrina’s
devastating impact in 2005, New Orleanians show a renewed apprecia-
tion for their art, food, language, music, and the many diverse peoples
whose long-ago influences remain.
Tracing the Mardi Gras Tradition
It’s fitting that Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, rediscovered and
secured the mouth of the Mississippi in 1699 on Mardi Gras day, a holi-
day cherished by New Orleanians for nearly 175 years. Although Creole
societies per European custom already celebrated the holiday, it wasn’t
until 1837 that a newspaper gave the first official account of a public
Mardi Gras parade, complete with masked revelers. Some people deplore
the debauchery seen today, but in the mid-1840s, the debauchery was
far more extreme and risked being banned.
Thankfully, a group of men formed the first Mardi Gras organization, the
Mistick Krewe of Comus, named after the god of mirth and revelry. In
1857, they paraded by torchlight on two mule-drawn floats — so very
quaint and quite different compared to today’s standards where you see
a monstrously large, two-story, tractor-pulled Bacchusaurus float zoom
past as part of the superkrewe Bacchus. Comus also invented the “secret
society” and issued 3,000 coveted invitations to a ball that would become
the event for New Orleans’s upper class. In time, other krewes joined in
on the fun, hosting their own parades and balls.
Most krewes are hierarchies, with one member ruling as king and several
others serving as the royal court. (Some krewes, such as Endymion and
Bacchus, recruit celebrities from film, television, music, and sports to act
as their kings.) Many krewes have roots in private, exclusive organizations,
with agendas ranging from the socially aware to purely pleasurable.
Mardi Gras is the culmination of Carnival (please don’t confuse the two
terms). Mardi Gras is French for “Fat Tuesday,” though the term gener-
ally applies to the final two weeks of Carnival (from carnisvale, or “farewell
to flesh,” which begins on January 6, the 12th night of Christmas). The
idea of Mardi Gras is to cram as much sin and decadence as you can into
this final frenzied fortnight. On Ash Wednesday, the Christian season of
Lent begins, which consists of 40 days of fasting and repentance. Of
course, not all celebrants on the streets during Mardi Gras are strict 
religious adherents; most come for the party.
I hope you can come for the next Mardi Gras, which always falls 46 days
before Easter. Dates for the next four years are February 20, 2007, Febru-
ary 5, 2008, February 24, 2009, and February 16, 2010. See the “Mardi
Gras Parade Routes” map (see p. 209) in Chapter 12 for the major
parades that take place during the last days of Carnival.

Building Blocks: Local Architecture
One of the big reasons why I choose to live in New Orleans is the extraor-
dinarily beautiful, old architecture. The delicate gingerbread on an Eastlake
Victorian home or the cast-iron railing of an Italianate shotgun house
starkly contrast with plain, nearly identical suburban homes across the
country. And the sheer number and variety of architectural styles — from
the early 1800s Creole cottage to the 1940s bungalow — are breathtaking
compared to the cookie-cutter developments found elsewhere.
The most common form of architecture is the classic shotgun. Raised on
brick piers, it’s a narrow, long structure, where one room lines up behind
another. Many natives hated growing up in one because of the lack of pri-
vacy; you have to go through the bedrooms before you get to the kitchen,
which was typically added on to the back. (Some were lucky and lived in
a camelback shotgun, where the bedrooms were on the second floor.) If
you open the front and back doors and look down the hall, it gives the
appearance of a shotgun barrel. Or, some say it got its name because you
could shoot a shotgun through the doors and not hit anything. The
breezeway provided a form of air conditioning, as did the brick piers
because air flowed underneath the floorboards. You can find this practical
yet attractive style throughout New Orleans and especially in what were
working-class neighborhoods, such as the Irish Channel (see Chapter 8).
You can find photos of other popular architecture styles — such as the
Creole Cottage and the Double Gallery House — at www.prcno.org, the
Web site for the nonprofit Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans.
If you want to find out more about New Orleans architecture, page
through Lloyd Vogt’s illustrated New Orleans Houses: A House Watcher’s
Guide (Pelican Publishing Co.). Or start collecting the New Orleans
Architecture series (Pelican); each book is devoted to one particular
neighborhood, such as the French Quarter, the American Sector, or the
Garden District. My favorite feature of the series is the inclusion of past
Chapter 3: Digging Deeper into New Orleans 43
All hail Rex (not the dog)
The identity of Rex (the King of Carnival) is kept secret until the day before Mardi Gras.
To be named King of Carnival is the ultimate honor for a New Orleanian, usually signi-
fying his prominent standing and work in the community. The king is almost always an
older man; his queen is usually of college age and always a young debutante as well
as the daughter of a prominent member of society. The krewe of Rex parade always
ends in an elaborate tradition: The parade stops at Gallier Hall for a toast from the
mayor before moving to Canal Street, where Rex gives a speech, toasts his queen,
and presents her with a big bouquet of roses.

and present photos of the same house, when possible. Too often, the
listing abruptly ends with the word “demolished.”
Thankfully, the largest collections of historic properties, such as in the
French Quarter and along St. Charles Avenue, were spared Katrina’s
wrath. The shotguns and Creole cottages of the Ninth Ward, the arts-
and-crafts bungalows and cottages of Lakeview, and the contemporary
ranches and colonial-style homes of New Orleans East were not so lucky.
Time will tell what new architecture will pop up as the city rebuilds these
neighborhoods. Several design projects and competitions to create low-
income housing are in the works, including Global Green USA’s “Sustain-
able Design Competition for New Orleans” (see www.globalgreen.org
for the finalists’ designs).
Taste of New Orleans: Local Cuisine
Cajun versus Creole
Much of New Orleans’s cuisine rests on two regional foundations: Cajun
and Creole cooking. Cajun cooking brought New Orleans to national atten-
tion in the early 1980s thanks to the popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme.
Cajun descends from the households of the Acadian country folk who
came from Nova Scotia to settle in rural Louisiana. In their new home,
economy often dictated that these folks throw all available foods into a
single pot — a tradition that created jambalaya, étouffée, and red beans
and rice (which many locals eat every Mon like clockwork).
Most people assume that Cajun food is always prepared spicy and
served piping hot. Although Cajun cuisine certainly relies on spice a
great deal, its foundation is a combination of regional ingredients. Even
though serving Cajun food steaming hot is wise, neither the physical
heat nor the spice should overwhelm the flavor.
Creole cooking is more varied and urban than Cajun food. Creole origi-
nated in the kitchens of New Orleans proper as a mix of French and
Spanish cuisines. It relies heavily on high-quality ingredients smothered
in rich, delicate sauces, with African and Caribbean spices providing an
extra kick.
Muffuletta versus po’ boy
Italian cold cuts and cheese stuffed into round Italian bread and slathered
with olive salad dressing: This is a muffuletta (say muff-ah-lot-ah). That
description may not do it justice. Trust me; this savory local fixture is
worth every salty bite. Half of a muffuletta makes a great meal, and a
quarter makes a nice, filling snack. Few people can eat a whole one. As
with many foods in New Orleans, arguments abound as to who makes
the best. Check out Chapter 11 to see my picks.
Part I: Introducing New Orleans 
44

The other signature sandwich of New Orleans, the po’ boy, proved cheap
and filling during the streetcar strike of the late 1920s, with the idea that
it’s the only food a poor boy or “po’ boy” can afford. Though not much
different in structure from a hero or a sub, it’s fixed in the minds of many
locals as the premier New Orleans sandwich. The sandwich isn’t all that
complicated; take a crusty loaf of French bread, slice it open lengthwise,
and stuff it with just about anything you can imagine. Roast-beef po’ boys
are great, especially if you have a little debris (gravy) dripping down the
sides. Ham and cheese is a standard combo, and hot smoked sausage is
also good. Seafood is a reliable standby; fried fish, soft-shell crab, oys-
ters, and shrimp are all popular ingredients. Weird as it may sound,
many people enjoy french-fry po’ boys; that’s right, a sandwich of french
fries between two slices of French bread — and hopefully some of that
rich, brown gravy. It’s in keeping with New Orleans’s “anything goes”
attitude. (Just skip the french fry po’ boy if you’re on a low-carb diet!)
Obviously, po’ boys aren’t exactly health food. The best sandwiches have
fried fixings or thick sauces (or both). They are also a teensy bit messy;
you’re just not getting the proper New Orleans experience if your shrimp
or roast beef isn’t spilling out of the sides of your overstuffed sandwich.
Is your mouth watering yet? See Chapter 11 for more food listings.
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Surprisingly, many native New Orleanians sound like they’re from
Brooklyn. Perhaps the dialect can be traced back to the enormous influx
of Italian and Irish immigrants from New York City in the decades after
1803, when New Orleans became an American city as part of the famous
Louisiana Purchase from France. Some locals don’t appear to have an
accent at all until you hear them pronounce a word like “trout” or “about,”
which sounds just like a Canadian would say it — must be that Acadian
influence. And don’t be scared if someone wants to “ax” you a question.

front of this book; for terms specific to Mardi Gras, see Chapter 12.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Turning the pages
Please don’t limit your fiction about New Orleans to Anne Rice. As much
as many people adore her, I invite you to explore authors whose works
also serve as portals to New Orleans. Pulitzer Prize winners John
Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces (Louisiana State University
Press) and Shirley Ann Grau’s The Keepers of the House (Vintage) are
classics — as is Walker Percy’s The Moviegoer (Vintage).
Chapter 3: Digging Deeper into New Orleans 45

More recent writings that caught my eye include John Biguenet’s Oyster
(Ecco), which is a must-read if you plan a day-trip to bayou country,
such as Lafitte (see Chapter 15). Valerie Martin’s The Great Divorce
(Vintage) is about a veterinarian at the New Orleans (read Audubon) Zoo
whose marriage is falling apart. Nancy Lemann’s Lives of the Saints (New
American Library) offers frank insight into New Orleans high society.
Other authors whose work I admire include Sheila Bosworth, Robert
Olen Butler, and Patty Friedmann.
If, after all these suggestions, you still want something by Rice, read 
The Feast of All Saints (Ballantine), a historical novel about les gens de
couleur libre (free people of color) in 19th-century New Orleans.
Christine Wiltz’s excellent Glass House (Louisiana State University)
examines the current state of racial tension.
A short list of nonfiction is near impossible, but forced to pick, I choose
Fabulous New Orleans (Pelican), by Lyle Saxon; The Last Madam: A Life 
in the New Orleans Underworld (DaCapo Press), by Christine Wiltz;
Frenchmen, Desire, Good Children and Other Streets of New Orleans
(Touchstone), by John Churchill Chase; and any essay collection by the
witty, worldly Andrei Codrescu.
Arthur Hardy’s Mardi Gras Guide is an annual magazine and my personal
Mardi Gras bible come Twelfth Night. It contains the all-important parade
schedule, calendar of related events, and informative articles on Carnival
history. You can buy one almost anywhere in the city (it usually comes
out right after Christmas), order a copy by phone % 504-838-6111, or
purchase one on the Web www.mardigrasneworleans.com/arthur/
index.html).
Of course, I have been reading anything and everything related to Katrina.
The most dramatic and passionate narrative of the storm and its imme-
diate aftermath can be found in The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New
Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast (Morrow), by Tulane historian and
best-selling author Douglas Brinkley. Times-Picayune columnist Chris
Rose has become an invaluable voice of the people post-Katrina, and his
self-published 1 Dead in Attic is a harrowing must-read (it’s widely avail-
able, even in gift shops); I also recommend Breach of Faith: Hurricane
Katrina and the Near Death of a Great American City (Random House), by
Times-Picayune editor Jed Horne. He shares shocking individual stories
without resorting to melodrama or cheap sentimentality. For more
Katrina-related book recommendations, see Chapter 2.
For more reading ideas, I strongly recommend The Booklover’s Guide to
New Orleans (Louisiana State University Press), by Times-Picayune book
editor Susan Larson.
Screening The Big Easy
Hollywood loves to make movies in and about New Orleans because 
of its odd combination of eccentricity and timelessness. Tennessee
Part I: Introducing New Orleans 
46

Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire, starring Marlon Brando and Vivien
Leigh, perfectly captures New Orleans and is a must-see. Another classic
is Louis Malle’s Pretty Baby, which was somewhat scandalous at the time
of its release for his portrayal of Brooke Shields as a child prostitute.
(Susan Sarandon stars as her mother.) The bordello scenes were shot
inside The Columns Hotel on St. Charles Avenue (see Chapter 10). Before
you head over to Harrah’s New Orleans Casino (see Chapter 12), rent
The Cincinnati Kid, in which Steve McQueen stars as a New Orleans card
shark.
Locals laugh at the put-on accents but still love Dennis Quaid as a semi-
corrupt cop and Ellen Barkin as an assistant district attorney in the sexy
crime caper The Big Easy. Julia Roberts plays a law student in John
Grisham’s legal drama The Pelican Brief. Lastly, if you’re planning to go
to bayou country for a day-trip (see Chapter 15), try to see Eve’s Bayou
before you go. The scenery is breathtaking, and the actors (including
Samuel L. Jackson) are heartbreaking.
In 2002, Louisiana lawmakers approved tax incentives for studios that
film in the state and hire local workers, which spawned a slew of produc-
tions in New Orleans and earned it the nickname “Hollywood South.”
Jamie Foxx came to town for his Oscar-winning turn in Ray, and Kate
Hudson filmed the haunting thriller The Skeleton Key.
Post-Katrina, filmmakers are slowly returning to the city. All the King’s
Men (starring Sean Penn, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet) was filmed here
before the storm hit, but the stars returned for the film’s premiere in
September 2006. Several other films are shooting as we go to print,
including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, starring Brad Pitt.

C
ompared to the rest of the country, New Orleans is slow to change.
Locals always favor tradition over trends. Nevertheless, the timing
of your trip should be a crucial consideration. If you don’t like hot
weather, don’t spend too much time here during the summer months,
when the humidity sticks to you like cotton candy. If you don’t like
crowds (especially rowdy, drunken ones), the charms of Mardi Gras or
Jazz Fest may be lost on you.
Keeping Hurricane Season in Mind
After Katrina, it goes without saying that you should take hurricane
season — June 1 through November 30 — into consideration when plan-
ning your trip. Most tropical storm and hurricane activity occurs August
through October. If you decide to go during this time, please plan ahead
for what you will need to do in case of an evacuation. See www.nola.com/
hurricane for a comprehensive “Hurricane Center” of news reports,
evacuation tips, and lots of links.
Planning Your Trip Around the Seasons
New Orleans has three seasons: Hot, Cold, and In Between. (Though
locals will tell you there are four seasons: crawfish, shrimp, crab and
“erster,” or oyster.) Except for late spring through early summer (when
temperatures are just uniformly hot), the seasons tend to run together.
That’s because this port city, a natural drop-off point for various cul-
tures, also seems to be a way station for nearly every weather pattern
on the North American continent. A butterfly beating its wings in Kansas
City seems to affect the weather in New Orleans. As a result, bundling up
under layers of clothing in the morning and then stripping down to a
tank top and shorts by mid-afternoon isn’t uncommon. Unless you’re
coming in the dog days of summer, prepare for a little bit of everything.

Spring
Pros:
 The weather is perfect for visiting plantation homes or 
Audubon Park.
 Wear shorts: Average highs are in the 70s and 80s.
 Jazz Fest, held the last weekend of April and the first weekend of
May, turns the city into one giant musical mecca.
 Other events, including the rapidly growing French Quarter Festival,
make the spring a “festive” time to visit.
Cons:
 The mercury can climb into the 90s with frightful speed.
 At the same time, average lows can dip into the 60s and even the
50s. Bring a light sweater or jacket, just in case.
 In New Orleans, April and May bring showers, so bring an umbrella,
and be prepared to use it.
Summer
Pros:
 Tourism in New Orleans generally lags in the summer, so it’s a great
time to beat the crowds and snag a bargain or two.
 The season brings pleasant breezes, plenty of sunshine, and color-
ful vegetation.
Cons:
 It’s hot. Average highs are in the 80s and 90s, with temperatures
often soaring into the 100s. You may want to limit your sightseeing

to cooler hours in the early morning and evening; the afternoons can
be unbearable. Drink plenty of fluids, seek shade and air-conditioned
buildings, and don’t skimp on the sunscreen.
 It’s not just hot; it’s humid. In New Orleans, humidity can often be
as high as 100 percent, resulting in an atmosphere you can practi-
cally drink through a straw. With all that moisture in the air, rain
can — and does — fall at the drop of a hat. Keep that umbrella
handy, especially if you venture out in the afternoon.
 School’s out. Teen foot traffic makes for crowded shopping destina-
tions, and attendance at museums, parks, and other kid-friendly
attractions rises.
Fall
Pros:
 Fall means a respite from the grisly heat of July and August, making
for cool breezes.
 The cool breezes also carry romantic properties that shouldn’t be
discounted. A lazy evening watching the pale sunset over the river
is a beautiful experience.
 Fall means Halloween, which offers a basketful of revelry options in
a city known for playing dress-up. (See “Perusing a Calendar of
Events” later in this chapter.)
Cons:
 October and November are the driest months of the year (which
isn’t necessarily a guarantee against sudden downpours).
 It’s the tail end (and the most active part) of hurricane season, which
begins June 1 and ends in November. Most storms come knocking
between August and November, so don’t discount the possibility of
a sudden and abrupt change of location should a big storm hit.
Winter
Pros:
 Compared with much of the country, New Orleans gets away easy.
The weather is often mild to middling cold, and you’ll never get
snowed in. Plan to bring a lightweight coat or jacket.
 The first three weeks of December are traditionally slow for
tourism, so finding a good room at a good rate is much easier.
 Crowds aren’t a big problem in the early part of December, so wait-
ing in line doesn’t take as long.
 After December, New Orleans has a lot going on. Don’t miss New
Year’s Eve in the French Quarter, or the Sugar Bowl each January.
Part I: Introducing New Orleans 
50

Chapter 4: Deciding When to Go 51
 You can’t forget Mardi Gras. Depending on the year, Carnival can
fall almost anywhere in February or early March.
 New Orleans is made for romance, making it the perfect spot for a
Valentine’s Day getaway.
Cons:
 Although winter is a cakewalk compared to, say, winter in Chicago,
cold weather can catch you unawares if you don’t plan (and pack)
for the possibility. Occasional cold snaps bring the temperature
down to freezing and below.
 You may want to make room for a larger coat, as well. The wind-
chill factor, which can knock another 10 or 20 degrees off the ther-
mometer, exacerbates the cold weather. (You’ll still likely
experience topsy-turvy weather, so pack lighter wear, too.)
 If you don’t like large crowds and snarled traffic, you’d do better to
avoid New Year’s and Mardi Gras.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
New Orleans truly deserves its reputation as a party capital. No matter
what time of year you visit, you can find an excuse to laissez le bon
temps rouler (let the good times roll). The local newspapers’ calendars of
events are bursting with things to do, from casual celebrations to full-out
festivals.
If you’re coming to New Orleans for a specific event, especially Mardi
Gras or Jazz Fest, you need to do a bit more advance planning than you
would otherwise. I can’t stress this point enough: Make reservations for
these two events (as well as for the Sugar Bowl and the French Quarter
Festival) as early as possible. As their dates draw closer, hotel rooms
become scarcer than honest politicians (the latter are infamously rare in
Louisiana). I recommend that you begin calling 8 to 10 months ahead.
Don’t assume you’re off the hook if you come for a smaller event such
as, say, the Rayne Frog Festival (hop to the end of this chapter for
details). Even during the less popular (and populous) festivals and
events, finding a place to stay can become a Herculean exercise if you
wait too long. Plan ahead to avoid a headache of scrambling for a room.
The following sections present the city’s best festivals and events, listed
under the months in which they occur. For more-detailed information,
visit the Times-Picayune and Gambit Weekly Web sites (www.nola.com
and www.bestofneworleans.com, respectively), New Orleans Citysearch
(www.neworleans.citysearch.com), or Inside New Orleans (www.
insideneworleans.com). Huli’s Calendar of Louisiana Festivals and
Events is an indispensable, comprehensive resource for festivals

throughout the state. You can find this publication at bookstores and
newsstands throughout the city; go to www.louisiana-festivals.com
or call % 504-488-5993 for a copy or for specific information.
January
The Allstate Sugar Bowl Football Classic (% 504-828-2440; www.
allstatesugarbowl.com). Crowds begin pouring into the city around
late December. If you’re a football fanatic and can afford to spend the
money, the Sugar Bowl is perfect. Getting tickets can be difficult, espe-
cially when the Sugar Bowl hosts the national college football champi-
onship. If you want to go, check a ticket service such as Ticketmaster
(www.ticketmaster.com). January 1.
Carnival (% 800-672-6124 or 504-566-5011; www.neworleanscvb.com)
runs from January 6 to Mardi Gras day, but only the last two weeks lead-
ing up to Mardi Gras see a huge increase in tourism. You’ll be lucky to
find a vacant hotel room within 100 miles of the city if you don’t make
your reservations well ahead of time. Call for specific dates.
Mardi Gras (% 800-672-6124 or 504-566-5011; www.mardigrasday.com).
On this day and most of the two weeks preceding it, life in New Orleans
is hectic, to put it mildly. (See Chapters 3 and 12 for more information on
Mardi Gras.) Can be as early as February 3 or as late as March 9, but it
always falls on the Tuesday 46 days before Easter.
February
The Black Heritage Festival (% 504-827-0112). This two-day celebra-
tion features craft exhibits, soul food (such as jambalaya, fried chicken,
and gumbo), and live music in Armstrong Park. You can find related
activities along the Riverwalk, in Audubon Park, and at various Louisiana
State Museum buildings. Late February or early March.
March
On St. Patrick’s Day, celebrations and parades overtake the city. The
Downtown Irish Club sponsors a parade the Friday before St. Patrick’s
Day. Call local tavern Molly’s on the Market, where the parade kicks off,
at % 504-525-5169 for more information. March 17.
The Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival (% 504-581-
1144; www.tennesseewilliams.net) celebrates the life of this famous
playwright with performances, lectures, and walking tours. Held over a
four-day period in March.
April
The French Quarter Festival (% 800-673-5725 or 504-522-5730; www.
frenchquarterfestivals.org) serves as the unofficial start of the
Part I: Introducing New Orleans 
52

city’s prime festival season because it leads directly into Jazz Fest.
Hailed as the state’s largest free music festival (and the world’s largest
jazz brunch), it gets bigger every year, offering plenty of free entertain-
ment (unlike Jazz Fest, which is by ticket only), with an emphasis on
local and regional music and food. Check on room availability well in
advance. Second weekend in April. (Note: If it conflicts with Easter, it’s
held the first or third weekend in Apr).
Jazz Fest, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, (% 504-522-4786
or 504-558-6100; www.nojazzfest.com). A diverse lineup of hundreds of
musicians (from big-ticket names to local acts, representing just about
every genre under the sun) perform on various stages at the New
Orleans Fair Grounds, and many more turn up after hours in the city’s
music clubs and concert halls as venues capitalize on the eager, music-
hungry traffic. The city is crowded, prices are higher, and hotel and
restaurant reservations are hard to come by — so plan ahead. Many
attendees begin making reservations for the following year’s festival
even before the current one ends. Last weekend in April (Fri–Sun) and
first weekend in May (Thurs–Sun).
May
The Greek Festival (% 504-282-0259; www.greekfestnola.com) fea-
tures Greek food, crafts, music, and dancing. Last weekend in May.
June
The International Arts Festival (% 888-767-1317 or 504-367-1313 is
another popular music festival, with a decidedly Caribbean feel. The
city’s third oldest festival focuses on calypso, reggae, and regional food,
and takes place during the second weekend in June.
July
The popular Essence Festival (% 800-725-5652 or 504-523-5652; www.
essence.com) is both a music festival and a series of seminars on topics
of importance to the African American community. The festival has fea-
tured appearances by Prince, Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle, Lauryn Hill,
The Isley Brothers, Mary J. Blige, Sinbad, Kenny G, Maya Angelou, Missy
Elliott, Clarence Carter, and Irma Thomas, among many others. Held
during the weekend closest to the Fourth of July.
Tales of the Cocktail (% 800-299-0404; www.talesofthecocktail.
com) is one more excuse to drink alcohol in the Big Easy (as if this city
needs another). The annual festival features mixologist demos, walking
tours/bar crawls, pairing menus at top restaurants, and more. Most
events are $25; dinner rates vary. Held at various locations for five days
the last week of July.

September
Southern Decadence (% 800-876-1484 or 504-522-8047; www.southern
decadence.net), which promises just that — decadence, and lots of it.
Thousands of gays and lesbians converge upon the city during this festi-
val. They assemble on Sunday in the 1200 block of Royal Street and then
head off on a secret parade route known only to the grand marshal.
Expect drag queens galore and lots of drinking. The celebration is wild
and, like Mardi Gras, not all the street celebrations are appropriate for
young children. Labor Day weekend.
September marks the start of football season, with another year of 
gridiron action for the New Orleans Saints (% 504-733-0255; www.
neworleanssaints.com). The team struggles, giving credence to a sup-
posed curse. An entire cemetery had to be relocated in order to build
the Superdome; some locals suggest the disturbed spirits haunt the
team.
Enjoying festivals off the beaten path
Not everything worth doing in Louisiana happens inside the corporate limits of New
Orleans. Check out these noteworthy festivals that take place just outside the city.
Festival International de Louisiane
(%
337-232-8086;
www.festival
international.com) is a mammoth celebration of the cultural heritage of 
southern Louisiana (primarily a mix of French, Hispanic, and African-Caribbean 
cultures). It usually takes place during the last weekend of April in downtown
Lafayette, about a two-hour drive from New Orleans.
Lafayette also plays host to Festivals Acadiens (% 337-233-7060), a celebration of
Cajun culture. Cajun food and music are the main attractions, with workshops and
other activities sprinkled throughout. Third weekend of September.
The Original Southwest Louisiana Zydeco Music Festival (% 337-942-2392;
www.zydeco.org) in Plaisance (roughly a three-hour drive north of New Orleans)
celebrates the unique joys of zydeco, the popular accordion-driven music of the
Creoles of southern Louisiana. Aside from the event itself, an all-day fair is held on
Saturday with music, food, and crafts. The celebration extends to the surrounding
areas of Lafayette, Opelousas, and Lake Charles. Labor Day weekend.
I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least mention the Rayne Frog Festival, in Cajun Country, about
a two-hour drive from New Orleans in an area west of Lafayette. Cajuns can turn just
about anything into an excuse for a festival, as evidenced by this event’s frog races and
frog-jumping contests. (Didn’t bring a frog? Don’t worry; you can rent one. Seriously.)
On the culinary side, you can also participate in a lively frog-eating contest. Held every
September. For exact dates and full details, contact the Rayne Chamber of Commerce
(% 337-334-3121; www.rayne.org).

October
The Gumbo Festival (% 504-436-4712) offers attendees every type of
gumbo you can imagine — and many that you can’t. The festival features
games and carnival rides as well as jazz, blues, and Cajun music to put
you in the mood for food — and work off what you eat. Generally held
during the second weekend in October.
With the locals’ penchant for masking, it’s a given that New Orleans
loves Halloween. Children can attend Boo at the Zoo (held on and
around Halloween; % 866-ITS-AZOO or 504-866-4872; www.audubon
institute.org) and a yearly program at the Louisiana Children’s
Museum (% 504-586-0725; www.lcm.org). Meanwhile, events such as
the French Market Pumpkin Carving and Decorating Contest (% 504-
522-2621) and the Moonlight Witches Run offer more adult-oriented
fun.
Speaking of adult-oriented, the annual M.O.M.’s Ball, thrown by a
debauched group known as the Krewe of Mystic Orphans and Misfits, is
one of the season’s hot-ticket events, a notoriously raucous bash. It’s an
invitation-only event, so you won’t find any public ticket information,
but keep an eye out for it if you’re in town in October.
November
The State Farm Bayou Classic (% 225-771-3170) is a college football
rivalry between a pair of Louisiana institutions: Grambling University
and Southern University. The annual event is one of the major social
events of the year, so make your reservations early if you plan to 
attend — around 75,000 people turn out for the game. Thanksgiving
weekend.
The Celebration in the Oaks (% 504-483-9415). During this festival,
sections of City Park’s lovely old oaks are draped with lights and holi-
day-themed figures delight kids of all ages. You can visit the park on
foot, by car, or by carriage. Late November to early January.
December
You won’t see Dick Clark or Ryan Seacrest there, but the Jackson
Square New Year’s Eve celebration is beginning to resemble New 
York City’s — right down to the lighted ball dropping from the top of
Jackson Brewery and dramatic fireworks over the Mississippi River.

n a city as tempting as New Orleans, traveling without a budget is 
the surest path to financial disaster. Thanks to numerous historical
attractions, French Quarter souvenir shops, and fabulous restaurants
and bars, you don’t need to set foot inside Harrah’s Casino to break your
bank. In fact, you can easily max out your credit card just by sampling
the city’s many culinary delights. In this chapter, I give you tips on how
to exercise willpower and fiscal responsibility without sacrificing self-
indulgences.
If you do go over budget, remember that you’re contributing to an econ-
omy that desperately needs tourist dollars. (You can also contribute
directly to the city’s rebuilding efforts by giving to a local charity; see p.
38 for a list of organizations.)
Planning Your Budget
The best way to get a handle on your budget is to walk yourself through
your trip, starting with transportation to your nearest airport (or, if
you’re driving, how much gas you expect to use per day). If you’re flying,
first add up the costs of your transportation to the airport, your flight,
and the ride to your hotel. Next, add the hotel rate per day, meals (be
sure to note if your hotel includes breakfast in its room rate), transporta-
tion costs, admission to museums and other attractions, and any other
entertainment expenses.
Table 5-1 offers some average costs for you to get started.

The costs of some things, such as hotels, are relatively inflexible. Along
with airfare or other transportation costs, lodging makes up the largest
part of your expenditures. Other factors, such as transportation in the
city, are relatively cheap. The incredible number of restaurants and
nightlife choices in New Orleans vary as widely in price as they do in
style, so it’s up to you to go formal or casual and pay accordingly.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
60

Of course, budgeting your vacation isn’t so difficult when you’re jotting
down prices on a piece of paper in the comfort of your own home.
Keeping track of your costs after you arrive, however, is another matter
altogether. Remember that the key element in budget is “budge,” so
allow yourself some flexibility — start by tacking a good 10 percent or
even 20 percent onto the final budget tally. Keep in mind that you can
easily go from merely bending your budget to flat-out broke if you don’t
pay attention.
Transportation
Getting around the most popular parts of the city is a relative bargain.
Many hotels and attractions lie within a few miles of one another in the
French Quarter or Central Business District. If your destination is farther
than you want to walk — or if you’re visiting on a particularly hot day —
a taxi ride is worth the cost. The average trip in or around the Quarter
should be no more than $5.
For public transportation, hop on one of the city’s buses or streetcars.
Fares are $1.25 each time you get on (transfers cost an additional 25
cents), but a VisiTour pass, good for unlimited bus and streetcar rides,
costs only $5 for one day and $12 for three days. Check with your hotel’s
concierge, or check with the Regional Transit Authority (% 504-248-
3900; www.norta.com) for information. Many hotels also offer free shut-
tles to and from the French Quarter or Central Business District. For more
information on getting around the city, see Chapter 8.
Lodging
In this book, I share information about rack rates and how to save money
in this area (details in Chapter 10), but hotels will still comprise a signifi-
cant portion of your expenses. (Rack rates simply mean published rates
and tend to be the highest rate paid.) You can find inexpensive rooms,
though they’re usually far from the center of town, or they don’t offer
much in the way of amenities. (Some guesthouses, for example, wanting
to emulate that European feel, offer rooms that share a common bath-
room for a cheaper rate, or a backpacker room that more closely resem-
bles your closet at home.) If you want to stay relatively close to the
French Quarter or the Central Business District, expect to spend a mini-
mum of $80 to $100 a night.
Dining
Dining options in New Orleans range from dirt-cheap to astronomically
high. Almost all options are tantalizing; you don’t have to spend a lot of
money for a great meal. If you want to save a buck or two, get coffee and
beignets for breakfast at Café du Monde for about $2.50, a $5 po’ boy for
lunch at any one of a hundred places, and dinner for under $15 at a
place such as Café Maspero in the Quarter.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 61

However, if you feel like you can’t come to New Orleans without having
breakfast at Brennan’s, dinner at Antoine’s, or a special night out at one
of the fancier restaurants listed in Chapter 11, make sure to put a little
money aside and make reservations well in advance.
Sightseeing
Attractions are a somewhat more flexible expense. Of course, your
budget for entrance fees and admissions depends on what you want to
see. If you’re traveling with your entire family, you can expect to shell
out more for attractions than if you’re backpacking with a buddy. Refer
to the attraction listings in Chapter 12 and make a list of your “must-
sees,” and then figure out your costs from the ticket prices.
Shopping
The amount of money you need for shopping makes up another variable
part of your budget. After all, you don’t have to buy anything at all if
that’s your style, though self-restraint can be something of an alien con-
cept in New Orleans. Even a scrupulous penny-counter can succumb to
shopping fever when wandering the French Market or some of the sou-
venir shops in the French Quarter. As an international port city, New
Orleans offers as many choices as you can imagine. If you’re an antiques
buff, you may want to leave your checks and credit cards at the hotel
before going anywhere near Magazine or Royal streets.
If you’re just looking for souvenirs to take home as proof of your trip, you
can find whole colonies of shops selling postcards, posters, sunglasses,
and T-shirts in the French Quarter. Being tourist shops, however, they
aren’t exactly cheap. If you want to save on souvenirs, ask someone to
take your picture on Bourbon Street. Voilà! You now have an instant
memento of your trip (assuming the person doesn’t run away with your
camera). See Chapter 13 for the lowdown on shopping in New Orleans.
Nightlife
Your entertainment dollars will likely stretch further in New Orleans
than in a place such as New York, where a pair of tickets to the theater
can require a second mortgage. Most of the nightlife in New Orleans is
relatively inexpensive — but again, your personal preferences determine
the final tally. You’ll obviously spend more if you go to the opera than if
you head to the Maple Leaf or the House of Blues for some local music.
Turn to Chapter 17 for nightlife listings, and Chapter 15 for the perform-
ing arts scene.
Cutting Costs — If You Must
New Orleans really needs every tourist dollar, so if you can afford to
splurge, go ahead; get or do what you want and feel good about it, too.
But if you must stick to a budget, try these cost-saving tips:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
62

 Go off season. If you can handle hot, humid weather, you can get
some great deals from June through August — but remember that
when I say hot, I mean blood-boiling, sweat-inducing hot. The first
three weeks of December are also a good time for discounts.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager for a price much less
than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for more
on package tours.)
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several motels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
can save you money — and probably calories.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for 
savings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals.
Ask about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels don’t charge you the additional person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay $10 or $15 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinners cost at a top restaurant, and
the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of the Quarter. Really. To many people, the French Quarter
is New Orleans, and they want to stay where they think all the
action happens. Although you’ll certainly see plenty of action in the
Quarter, New Orleans offers much more for you to see and experi-
ence. Plus, hotels outside the Quarter tend to charge less than
those inside its borders. So if you don’t mind a slightly longer trip
to most attractions, book a room in Faubourg Marigny, Uptown, or
along the Esplanade Ridge. Thanks to the new Canal streetcar, even
Mid-City is convenient to downtown. (See Chapter 9 for detailed
neighborhood descriptions and Chapter 10 for more on hotels.)
 Take the streetcar. What’s more romantic than seeing New Orleans
from the streetcar? Relax, and ride for only $1.25 (one-way). (See
streetcar maps on p. 108 and 111 and see the St. Charles’ “Streetcar
Highlights” box on p. 256.)
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 63

 Walk a lot. You can save money, get some exercise, and see the city
the way it was meant to be seen — at a leisurely pace. Stay hydrated
and invest in a good pair of walking shoes — the last thing you
need on vacation is sore feet. (Note: Don’t overdo the walking if
you’re in town during a really hot spell. And wear a hat — the sun
is stronger than you may realize!)
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories could be
your trip’s best mementos. If you’re concerned about money, avoid
those Quarter tourist shops with their overpriced T-shirts, key
chains, and other useless trinkets. After all, you don’t really need
those riverboat salt-and-pepper shakers, do you?
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an auto-
mated teller machine (ATM). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.master
card.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span
the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see which network
you’re on, and then call or check online for ATM locations at your desti-
nation. Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN)
before you leave home, and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal
limit before you depart. Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee
every time you use your card at a different bank’s ATM, up to $1.50 for
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
64
Katrina’s affect on the local economy
At $105 billion and counting, Hurricane Katrina is the costliest natural disaster in U.S.
history. According to the Brookings Institute, the labor force in the Greater New
Orleans area is 30 percent smaller one year post-Katrina and the unemployment rate
of 7.2 percent, is higher than pre-Katrina. As tourism increases and people continue to
return, the city will bounce back. For a list of charities accepting donations, see p. 38.

domestic transactions. On top of this, the bank from which you with-
draw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees within
the United States, use www.bankrate.com.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses. You can also withdraw cash advances
from your credit cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. 
If you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the
number on the back of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to
you. It usually takes five to seven business days, though some banks
provide the number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s
maiden name or some other personal information.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM with-
drawal fee if the bank isn’t your own. So if you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — provided that
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well 
as at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 and 
2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and
$1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain
Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-
3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for
a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they’re
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact your credit-card companies the minute you discover
your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest 
police precinct (in the French Quarter, go to the New Orleans Police
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 65

Department’s 8th District at 334 Royal St.; % 504-565-7530). Your
credit-card company or insurer may require a police report number or
record of the loss. Most credit-card companies have an emergency toll-
free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be able to wire
you a cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit card in
a day or two. Call the following emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-

Getting to New Orleans
In This Chapter
 Traveling to New Orleans by airplane, car, or other means
 Understanding how Katrina damage will affect your transport
 Considering the escorted or package tour options
S
o you’re ready to come to the Crescent City? Before you pack your
bags and throw on those Mardi Gras beads, you have to decide how
to get here. Many people rush through this part of the process and end
up paying for it later. Even if you know you want to fly, considering your
many travel options before you book a flight is worth your time. This
chapter covers the pros and cons of using a travel agent and of booking
an escorted or package tour. It also mentions some pointers to keep in
mind if you choose a more independent route, be it by plane, car, or
even train.
How Katrina Damage Will 
Affect Your Transport
Even months after the storm, transportation into and out of the city 
was still a mess. Some interstates and bridges leading into the city suf-
fered damage requiring repair; the Twin Spans bridge, which crosses the
east side of Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans to Slidell, was utterly
destroyed. The airport was not anywhere near full capacity and automo-
bile traffic was just horrific. Everything is much closer to normal now and
you should not notice any Katrina-related transport problems other than
perhaps some increased auto traffic, especially during rush hour because
so many people still work in the city but live elsewhere because their New
Orleans home is gone. The Twin Spans bridge, now reopened, is busier
than ever with traffic from Slidell and other cities on the Northshore.
Flying to New Orleans
All the major airlines fly to New Orleans’s Louis Armstrong International
Airport (airline code MSY, for those of you booking on the Web), among
them American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com), Continental

(% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com), Delta (% 800-221-1212; www.
delta.com), Northwest (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com), Southwest
(% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com), United (% 800-UNITED; www.
united.com) and US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com).
The airport is in Kenner, 15 miles west of the city.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other indus-
try. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat
is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive
price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even the short-
est hops within the United States, the full fare is close to $1,000 or more,
but a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket might cost less than half of
that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — in New
Orleans, that would be anytime in the summer and December.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. FlyCheap
(% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-
holiday megalith MyTravel and has especially good access to fares for
sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.air
ticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and leverages the currently
weak Canadian dollar for low fares. Your best bet locally is Uniglobe

Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. Each has different
business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the
same flights, so shop around. Expedia and Travelocity also can send you
an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your
favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites, SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser
add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only
beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check megasites that compile comprehensive lists of
last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com). For last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the United States often
has better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for travel
on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysterious
change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major, well-known
carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia to Chicago
via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight
are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you buy; Priceline
usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play their “name
our price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added nonopaque service to its
roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines
from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines
through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the airline sends
you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming Friday or
Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You can sign
up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to Smarter Living
(www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each individual airline’s
Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and informa-
tion on late-breaking bargains.
Driving to New Orleans
New Orleans is easily accessible by car. Interstate 10 runs directly through
the city from east to west, and just north of the city is Interstate 12,
Chapter 6: Getting to New Orleans 69

which also travels from east to west. From I-12, you can connect with the
Lake Pontchartrain Causeway and drive south to I-10 directly in the
metro area or connect with either I-55 to the west of the city or I-59 to
the east of the city. Both I-55 and I-59 flow from north to south and con-
nect with I-10. You can also access the city by U.S. highways 11, 51, 61,
and 90. For help planning your route into the city, see the “Greater New
Orleans” map on the inside front cover of this book.
Before you pack the trunk, however, don’t forget this bit of information:
As far as sightseeing goes, New Orleans isn’t an easy driving city. Getting
around the city isn’t impossible, but at many tourist destinations, such
as restaurants, nightclubs, or antiques shops, you have to fend for your-
self for on-street parking. In the French Quarter, on-street parking is as
elusive as Shangri-La; even residents have perennial parking woes. In
fact, finding free parking near most attractions is something of a crap-
shoot. Commercial lots are readily available, but they can be expensive,
and their locations are sometimes inconvenient.
Again, I don’t want to discourage you or scare you off, especially if you
have no other option. But be warned: If you drive into New Orleans
(especially if you’re staying in the French Quarter), you’re better served
by taking public transportation around the Quarter and saving your car
for excursions outside the district.
Arriving by Other Means
Would you prefer to pull in to New Orleans on a train, or perhaps ride in
on a cruise? Here are a few options if you want to leave your car at home.
Riding the rails
An increasingly less popular, but scenic, option is to take a train. All trains
arrive at New Orleans’s Union Passenger Terminal, 1001 Loyola Ave. Call
Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL or 504-528-1610; www.amtrak.com) for spe-
cific information on train fares and schedules. Ask about senior-citizen
discounts and other possible discounts when making a reservation.
Note: The terminal, located at the edge of the Central Business District,
serves as both the train station and the Greyhound Bus Terminal.
Cruising into New Orleans
Taking a cruise ship into New Orleans is about as different a travel option
as you can think of. The slow, luxurious nature of a sea cruise fits perfectly
with the city’s “big easy” reputation, and one of the city’s most popular
party tunes is the 1959 R&B hit “Sea Cruise,” by local Frankie Ford.
As a major port, New Orleans is a stop for a number of cruise lines. If
you miss a particular attraction during this trip, you can always catch it
when your cruise ship stops here on your next major vacation. Or you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
70

can get really creative and schedule a Caribbean cruise right in the
middle of your New Orleans vacation. Carnival (www.carnival.com),
Norwegian (www.ncl.com), and Crystal (www.crystalluxurycruises.
com) lines, for example, make stops in or have cruises disembarking
from New Orleans. For a unique vessel, try Riverbarge Excursions
(www.riverbarge.com).
You usually disembark at the Julia Street Cruise Ship Terminals 1 
and 2; if you decide to take a cruise from New Orleans — for example,
on Carnival’s Holiday or Conquest — you board here, as well. The ter-
minal was originally developed as part of the 1984 Louisiana World
Exposition — only about five minutes on foot from the French Quarter.
(For port information, call % 504-522-2551.) Alternatively, many paddle-
wheel boats for upriver cruises and some southbound cruise ships
depart from the Robin Street Wharf.
For more information on cruise ships as a vacation option, consider
Cruise Vacations For Dummies by Fran Wenograd Golden (Wiley), a handy
guide to navigating the world of cruise ships. For more information on
cruises departing from New Orleans, check out Cruise Deals for Less
(% 800-330-1001 or 504-885-7245; www.cruisedealsforless.com).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details, and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront and, in the case of
the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, why would the tour operator fulfill its insurance obligations?
Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you more
about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 8.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the opera-
tor cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
Chapter 6: Getting to New Orleans 71

by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tour operators have a mini-
mum group size, and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are
to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers,
but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 Escape Holidays (% 619-448-4489; www.escapeholidays.com)
creates custom tours for groups and independent “on your own”
vacation packages, featuring the Essence Music Festival, Crescent
City Haunts, and Holidays in New Orleans; call or e-mail for a price
quote.
 Menopausal Tours (% 866-468-8646; www.menopausaltours.com)
caters specifically to women 40 and older. Ladies, get a group of
girlfriends together for the “Jazz, Jambalaya & Beignets” tour, a
little taste of everything New Orleans has to offer; prices start at
$1,075 per person.
 New Orleans Tours (% 888-486-8687 or 504-592-0560; www.notours.
com), offers traditional packages, like a Garden District Walking 
tour ($24 adults, $21 children ages 3–12), or the more adventurous
seaplane tour, which flies over the French Quarter, Chalmette
Battlefield, Lafitte, and more ($95 adults, $50 children ages 3–12).
Choosing a Package Tour
For many destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In sev-
eral cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation
to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a trip you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
72

who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a
buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them 10 at a time at a cost
that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others, while some provide the same hotels
for lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell
charters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel
days may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations
and independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excur-
sions or escorted day-trips (also at discounted prices) without booking
an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel & Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, Frommer’s
(www.frommers.com), and www.lastminute.com — also do a brisk 
business in packages. If you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller
packager, check with the Better Business Bureau in the city where the
company is based, or go online at www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell
you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
New Orleans is a popular vacation destination, even post-Hurricane
Katrina. You find no shortage of package tours — and no two are exactly
alike (at least in terms of price). Some tours cater to people who want to
be left to their own devices, while other tours target people who want a
helping hand in searching out the local color. The following are just a
few options:
 Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) offers
fairly bare-bones packages, which I liken to big-name hotel chains.
Its packages are perfectly nice if you’re just looking for a room, a
cheap airline ticket, and maybe an attraction or two.
 If you want a package tour with a bit more character, consider
Destination Management, Inc. (DMI) (% 800-471-8222 or 504-592-
0500; www.dmineworleans.com). If Liberty Travel is like a generic,
nationwide motor lodge, DMI is more like a small, independent
hotel — not a mom-and-pop establishment, mind you, but a place
Chapter 6: Getting to New Orleans 73

that offers better atmosphere and service than the national chains.
As a New Orleans–based company, DMI specializes in New Orleans
vacation packages. DMI’s packages center around different attrac-
tions and seasonal events, including Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras, the New
Orleans Saints, Halloween — you name it, DMI has a package for it.
 Festival Tours International (% 310-454-4080; www.gumbopages.
com/festivaltours) offers a Jazz Fest tour. This tour is like the
homey, bed-and-breakfast of New Orleans packages, with five-star
service thrown in for good measure. The brainchild of Nancy Covey,
this tour has atmosphere, character, culture, and slice-of-life authen-
ticity. Unlike other packages for the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
Festival, the culture and heritage on this trip doesn’t stop when
you leave the event site. Covey also takes you on an insider’s tour
of Cajun Country, where you experience musicians currently
making the scene.

 Finding gay-friendly activities
I
f your idea of New Orleans comes courtesy of Hollywood, you may
imagine a year-round bacchanal. Although you can find plenty of
opportunities to party, the Big Easy offers much more. In fact, New
Orleans is nothing if not a “one size fits all” vacation spot. Locals have
always been gracious toward tourists; after Hurricane Katrina, you may
find them to be even more accommodating because they have renewed
pride in this unique city and are eager to share their passion for it.
Families
Although most people associate New Orleans with hard-core debauch-
ery, the city is also a popular family destination. The farther away you
get from Bourbon Street and the strip clubs in the French Quarter, the
more family-friendly the city gets. But you don’t have to leave the
Quarter to find a wealth of kid-centric attractions and activities. New
Orleans’s unique history and its status as a nexus of different cultures
provide for a number of fascinating landmarks, museums, and other
sights of interest to children and adults.
In Chapter 12 (and throughout the book), I highlight the attractions that
your kids may like with the Kid Friendly icon. To get you started, the fol-
lowing is a list of places and activities guaranteed to keep kids entertained:
 Aquarium of the Americas (see p. 198)
 Audubon Zoo (see p. 201)
 City Park (see p. 203)

 Louisiana Children’s Museum (see p. 206)
 Mimes, jugglers, musicians, and other street performers in the
French Quarter, particularly at Jackson Square
 A ride across the river on the Canal Street Ferry (see box, p. 202)
You can also call ACCENT on Children’s Arrangements, Inc. (% 504-
524-1227; www.accentoca.com), a company that specializes in tours for
children, especially for those whose parents are attending a convention.
Just because something touts itself as fun for kids doesn’t necessarily
make it fun for you and your family. Pointing your kids toward a museum
that’s “good for them” doesn’t work and often results in eye rolling or the
ubiquitous “Dad, you’re a dork.” I’m not ignorant of this reality, as many
travel guides seem to be; in Chapter 12, I point out which attractions
may be more age-appropriate for small fries than for jaded teens (and
vice versa). I don’t tell you not to bring your kids to a specific attraction.
After all, you know your children better than I do, but I hope the guid-
ance helps you plan a daily itinerary that the whole family can enjoy.
Celebrating Mardi Gras with the family
During Mardi Gras the French Quarter is no place to bring your kids. The
farther into the Quarter you go, the raunchier the costumes become.
You’d be amazed what people get away with. Also, many young women
(and some not-so-young) are prone to lift up their shirts and bare their
breasts at the slightest provocation. (Increasingly, men are flashing their
private parts as well.) Although this practice originated as an incentive to
get float riders to throw the best beads, it’s evolved (or devolved) beyond
that. In recent years, I’ve seen women consent to flash their breasts for
camera-toting tourists in return for a free drink, a strand of beads, or even
just an appreciative hoot.
If you’d like to shield your young ones from this bartering process, try the
more family-friendly parade routes along St. Charles Avenue uptown. Or
see the Mardi Gras listing on p. 206 for a selection of major suburban
parade routes that are (for the most part) okay for the kids. 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans

Planning with your kids
When on vacation, most kids hate nothing more than a daily itinerary, a history lesson,
or anything else crammed down their throats. To help make your trip fun for you and
your kids, let them participate in the planning process. Encourage them to read through
this book and any tourist brochures you have. Allow them some input in organizing the
sightseeing schedule. If they feel like the vacation belongs to them, too, they’ll more
likely have fun when they get there — and so will you.

Locating kid-friendly accommodations
Because New Orleans is a large tourist destination, you won’t have any
trouble finding a place to stay that accepts children. Of course, excep-
tions always exist. You won’t likely find many cozy bed-and-breakfast
establishments that accommodate children, for instance. But in major
hotels, you’ll have no problem.
Of course, after you find a hotel that accepts children, your work has
just begun. Children are notoriously hard to please, and woe is the
weary parent who doesn’t take this into account when selecting a place
to stay. Sure, most kids are just happy to be away from home and in
close proximity to a rooftop swimming pool. But in case that isn’t
enough, many (if not most) hotels offer kid-friendly amenities, such as
pay-per-view movies or in-house video/DVD rental, video games, and
even goodies such as chocolate chip cookies upon check-in. Make sure
to inquire about nearby restaurants with children’s menus (that goes for
the in-house restaurant as well).
Keeping the kids entertained
No matter how much planning you do, kids are still prone to fits of bore-
dom and crankiness. Be sure to take along some toys or activities to
help them through the rough patches. Depending on their age or tastes,
pack coloring books, comics, books, or a portable radio or CD player to
keep them occupied.
Be sure to keep your kids’ endurance level in mind when planning your
itinerary. Long walking tours can tire kids out faster than adults, and
long waits can make them restless. This is where a portable radio or CD
player can come in handy. Also, stagger events to keep them enjoyable
for kids. A day of pounding the pavement may sap your child’s enthusi-
asm for the next day’s trip to that aquarium or zoo exhibit she’s been
dying to see. You also probably don’t need me to tell you that a child’s
energy level fluctuates wildly, and your little munchkin could catch his
second or third wind just as you’re ready to collapse for the day. Try to
keep an eye on such factors as sugar intake and other stimulants to
avoid a serious case of child lag in the middle of a long afternoon.
Relying on babysitting services
If you want a night out on your own without the kids, some hotels pro-
vide babysitting services; check with your hotel’s concierge or with 
the reservations clerk, or check the listings in Chapter 10. If your hotel
doesn’t provide such a service, you can contact an agency that watches
your children while you wine and dine at Upperline. Employees of these
agencies sit with your kids, take them on organized outings, or create a
personalized itinerary:

Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West
have cancelled their senior discount and coupon book programs, many
hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, people older than
60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other attrac-
tions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation.

can join.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Age Passport that gives
seniors 62 years or older lifetime entrance to all properties administered
by the National Park Service — national parks, monuments, historic
sites, recreation areas, and national wildlife refuges — for a one-time
processing fee of $10, which must be purchased in person at any NPS
facility that charges an entrance fee. (The Jean Lafitte National Historical
Park and Preserve headquarters is located in the French Quarter; its
satellite sites include the Chalmette Battlefield and National Cemetery 6
miles southeast of the city. See Chapter 12 for more details.) Besides free
entry, a Golden Age Passport also offers a 50 percent discount on fed-
eral-use fees charged for such facilities as camping, swimming, parking,
boat launching, and tours. For more information, go to www.nps.gov/

Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those aged 55 and older (and a spouse or companion of
any age) around the world. Most courses last five to seven days in the
United States, and many include airfare, accommodations in university

Enjoying your stay in New Orleans depends in large part on how you
plan for such variables as the distance between your hotel and the
attractions you want to see as well as how you deal with the city’s crazy
weather. The following sections can help you make the best lodging and
sightseeing decisions based on your own personal needs.
Lodging
Depending on your health, your hotel’s location may be a more impor-
tant consideration than it is for other travelers. If you plan to do a lot 
of sightseeing on foot, try to find a hotel that’s central to a number of
accessible attractions. If you plan to spend most of your time in the
French Quarter, you’re in good shape; almost everything in this rela-
tively small but eventful area is within walking distance. If walking the
Quarter’s 13 blocks seems prohibitive for you or a companion, catching
a cab is a wise, inexpensive alternative.
If you’re outside the Quarter, make sure your hotel is convenient to
public transportation and in a safe neighborhood. I recommend the
Pontchartrain Hotel or the St. Charles Guest House (see p. 139) for
safety and/or convenience to public transportation — both hotels are on
St. Charles Avenue, where the streetcar travels. You can enjoy a brief,
scenic walk from the streetcar stop to the St. Charles Guest House, located
in the increasingly gentrified but still funky Lower Garden District.
No matter where you choose to stay, take a cab if you venture out at
night; the extra couple of dollars is worth the security of being delivered
right to your door.
Attractions
If you’re staying in the French Quarter, you can find plenty of museums,
historic landmarks, and other attractions close at hand, and a number of
free sightseeing places (for example, Jackson Square or the Moonwalk)
where you can watch the parade of life unfold before you. If you like to
Chapter 7: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 79

gamble, Harrah’s New Orleans Casino is just across Canal Street from
the Aquarium of the Americas and Canal Place. Check the listings in
Chapter 12 for places of particular interest, as well as for information on
senior discounts.
Weather
Whether you travel with a group or on your own, some of the best
advice I can give you is to be mindful of the weather. In the summer,
when tourism is generally down, you won’t encounter as many crowds,
which makes it a good time to visit. However, the heat and humidity can
tire you out faster than normal, especially during the afternoons. If
you’re visiting in the summer, plan as many indoor activities as possible
during the peak afternoon hours. When you do venture outside, carry
some bottled water. (Check Chapter 4 for the lowdown on average tem-
peratures during the year in New Orleans.)
If you get lost or separated from your group, have the number of a reli-
able cab company on hand. I recommend using United Cab (% 504-522-
9771), the largest and most reliable fleet in the city.
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anybody from traveling. More options
and resources are available than ever before.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Access Passport that gives
free lifetime entrance to all properties administered by the National 
Park Service — national parks, monuments, historic sites, recreation
areas, and national wildlife refuges — for persons who are visually
impaired or permanently disabled, regardless of age. (The Jean Lafitte
National Historical Park and Preserve headquarters is located in the
French Quarter; its satellite sites include the Chalmette Battlefield and
National Cemetery six miles southeast of the city. See Chapter 12 for
more details.) You may pick up a Golden Access Passport at any NPS
entrance fee area by showing proof of medically determined disability
and eligibility for receiving benefits under federal law. Besides free 
entry, the Golden Access Passport also offers a 50 percent discount on
federal-use fees charged for such facilities as camping, swimming, park-
ing, boat launching, and tours. For more information, go to www.nps.
gov/fees_passes.htm or call % 888-467-2757.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for trav-
elers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.
flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that
emphasize sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able
Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers exten-
sive access information and advice for traveling around the world with
disabilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339)

offers trips for wheelchair travelers and their families and friends.
Wheelchair Getaways (% 800-642-2042 or 504-738-2634; www.
wheelchairgetaways.com) rents specially equipped vans with wheel-
chair lifts and other features for the disabled. The Louisiana office is
located in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans.
Avis Rent a Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services as
a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers with
special travel needs. Avis also offers helpful car features such as swivel
seats, spinner knobs, and hand controls, and accessible bus service.

MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of
accessible-travel resources online; SATH (Society for Accessible Travel
and Hospitality; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual membership
fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which offers a wealth of travel
resources for all types of disabilities and informed recommendations on
destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehicle rentals,
and companion services; and the American Foundation for the Blind

or visually impaired that includes information on traveling with Seeing
Eye dogs.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities,
the community Web site iCan (www.icanonline.net/channels/travel/

travelers with special needs; and Open World Magazine, published by
SATH (subscription: $13 per year, $21 outside the United States).
Anticipating building accessibility
Most of the historic sites and a few of the older hotels and restaurants in
New Orleans may present problems for people with disabilities because
they’re exempt from the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA). I mention problematic places in the relevant chapters of this
book, but call ahead and double-check.
All major hotels comply with the ADA, though some of the smaller hotels
and most notably B&Bs either aren’t in compliance or only partially so.
Among hotels, the Wyndham Canal Place receives the biggest thumbs-
up for accessibility, and the Dauphine Orleans, Hotel Monteleone, and
Royal Orleans are also highly rated. Many major restaurants also
comply, as I note in Chapter 11. If a place doesn’t have a ramp, however,
staffers are usually more than happy to help assist disabled patrons
inside their establishments.
Chapter 7: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 81

Planning for other New Orleans resources
A few resources within New Orleans can make your visit easier after you
arrive in the Crescent City. Normally, the newer Canal Streetcar is wheel-
chair accessible, although that line’s streetcars were flooded during
Hurricane Katrina. So the historic St. Charles streetcars, which are not
wheelchair accessible, are temporarily being used on Canal while
repairs are made to the St. Charles Streetcar corridor. Please contact the
Regional Transit Authority (% 504-248-3900; www.norta.org) for
updates on both streetcar lines and additional information. The RTA also
has lift-equipped buses available for individuals as well as for groups. If
you’re hearing-impaired and have a telecommunications device for the
deaf (TTY), the Louisiana Relay Service (% 800-947-5277) offers a
service that can connect you with non-TTY users. Travelers with disabil-
ities can also receive assistance from Resources for Independent Living
(% 504-522-1955).
Gay and Lesbian Travelers
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry, and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
“Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay 
and lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-
655-0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for exclu-
sive lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for both gay
and lesbian travelers.
New Orleans is one of the most gay- and lesbian-friendly cities in the
United States. You won’t lack for bars, restaurants, hotels, or other busi-
nesses owned by or catering to gays and lesbians, especially in the
French Quarter and neighboring Faubourg Marigny — the epicenter of
the local gay scene.
New Orleans hosts a number of gay-themed or gay-friendly events 
year-round. Southern Decadence is a major festival for gay and lesbian
tourists that takes place on Labor Day weekend. Halloween also has a
sizable gay turnout, and, of course, the spectacle of Mardi Gras draws
even bigger gay crowds (see Chapters 3 and 12). Despite the elitism of
some krewes, Mardi Gras is generally an inclusive and unifying event,
bringing together the city’s disparate populations for one long party.
The lower French Quarter even offers a gay-friendly celebration between
St. Ann Street (the unofficial boundary that marks the gay section of the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
82

Quarter) and Esplanade Avenue, where the Quarter ends. On Mardi Gras
day, gays and lesbians converge around noon in front of the Rawhide
2010 Bar (see Chapter 17), at St. Ann and Burgundy streets, to see (and
be seen in) outrageous costumes and to compete for the much sought-
after Bourbon Street Award.
New Orleans’s major gay publication is Ambush (% 800-876-1484 or
504-522-8047; www.ambushmag.com), providing excellent information on
what’s going on. You can find a copy in most gay-friendly establishments.
In the relevant chapters of this book, I note gay-friendly choices for
hotels, restaurants, and nightlife. Here are some additional suggestions:
 Best hotel choices for gay and lesbian travelers are the Lafitte
Guest House, the New Orleans Guest House, and the Ursuline
Guest House, all in the Quarter. If you’re willing to travel a bit far-
ther away, the Macarty Park Guest House in Bywater is about ten
minutes by cab from the Esplanade boundary of the Quarter.
 Best restaurant picks are Petunia’s and the Quarter Scene in the
French Quarter and Feelings Café and La Peniche in the Marigny.
 Best gay nightlife choices are The Bourbon Pub and Parade,
Golden Lantern, Good Friends, Café Lafitte in Exile, MRB
(Mississippi River Bottom), Oz, and Rawhide 2010, all in the
Quarter, and The Phoenix in the Marigny.
New Orleans has a network of services supporting the gay community.
The following organizations can connect you with gay-friendly lodgings,
help with travel arrangements, and offer food and entertainment 
recommendations.
 Big Easy Lodging (% 800-368-4876 or 504-433-2563; Fax: 504-391-

Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter

 Purchasing travel and medical insurance
 Staying healthy on your trip
 Connecting with your phone or computer
 Finding out the latest on airline security
A
fter you book your hotel room and flight (or make other appropri-
ate arrangements), you may assume that the rest of your trip is
smooth sailing. But before you pat yourself on the back and skip ahead
to the book’s nightlife section (see Chapters 16 and 17), you still need to
straighten out a few final details to avoid aggravation later.
Renting a Car — Don’t!
Should you rent a car in New Orleans? The short answer is no — but a
qualified no. If you plan to stay in the French Quarter, a car may be more
of a headache than you really need on vacation. Many of the hotels,
B&Bs, and guesthouses listed in this book have a limited number of
parking spaces. If you stay in an area such as Faubourg Marigny, the
Quarter is still just a short walk away.
Accommodations without adequate parking can point you to a nearby
garage, but the garages aren’t cheap. In some cases, you may have to
park on the street, which can present a big problem in the Quarter,
where parking spaces are a hot commodity. (Some people swear that
they don’t actually exist.)
For sightseeing in the Quarter, a car is more of a hindrance than an asset.
All the streets are one-way, and on weekdays during daylight hours,
Royal and Bourbon streets are closed to automobiles between the 300
and 700 blocks. In the Central Business District, congested traffic at peak
hours and limited parking conspire to make a motorist’s life difficult.

Also, New Orleans meter maids hand out more tickets than box-office
attendants. Some signs noting restricted parking spaces are posted so
far from the spaces themselves that you may miss them.
Of course, New Orleans offers much more than the very small French
Quarter, especially where dining and nightlife are concerned. If you stay
in one of the outlying areas, such as Uptown or the Garden District,
you’re more likely to find off-street parking.
If you do rent (or bring) a car, steer clear of congested sightseeing areas
such as the Quarter and the Central Business District and rely on public
transportation instead.
Finding the car you need at the price you want
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars:
 Do you charge lower rates for the weekend compared to your
weekday rates? If you’re keeping the car five or more days, a
weekly rate may be cheaper than the daily rate. Ask if the rate is
the same for pickup Friday morning as it is for Thursday night.
 Do you assess a drop-off charge if I don’t return the car to the
same location? Some do. Others, notably National, don’t.
 Is the rate cheaper if you pick up the car at a location in town
rather than at the airport? This may be cheaper — and more 
convenient — if you don’t need a car for the trip to and from the
airport.
 Is age an issue? Many car rental companies tack on a fee for driv-
ers under 25, while some don’t rent to them at all.
 May I get the advertised price that I saw in the local newspaper?
If you did in fact see a rate, be sure to ask for it. Otherwise you may
be charged the standard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention mem-
bership in AAA, AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usu-
ally entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but also most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
You’ll find desks for the following rental-car companies at the Louis
Armstrong New Orleans International Airport:
 Alamo (% 800-GO-VALUE; www.alamo.com)
 Avis (% 800-331-1212; www.avis.com)
 Budget (% 800-527-0700; www.budget.com)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
86

 Hertz (% 800-654-3131; www.hertz.com)
 National (% 800-227-7368; www.nationalcar.com)
Additionally, Enterprise Rent-A-Car (% 800-736-8222; www.enterprise.
com) maintains an office nearby on Airline Drive, and Swifty Car 
Rental, a local company (% 877-469-4007 or 504-733-2277; www.swifty
carrental.com), operates offices throughout the metropolitan area,
including one near the airport.
Using the Internet to find deals
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can 
make comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. You can check
rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the major travel
sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.
com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Travel (www.smarter
travel.com), for example — have search engines that can dig up dis-
counted car-rental rates. Just enter the car size you want, the pickup
and return dates, and location, and the server returns a price. You can
even make the reservation through any of these sites.
Understanding the additional charges
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes).
Many credit-card companies cover the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW),
which requires you to pay for damage to the car in a collision. Check
with your credit-card company before you go so you can avoid paying
this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home
probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car-
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope
diamond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway, you
can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability or personal accident coverage is never a good idea.
Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability
claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas upfront and can return the car with an empty gas
tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t
get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you
pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full
tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon for any shortfall. If you usually
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 87

run late and a fueling stop might make you miss your plane, you’re a per-
fect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is my advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the U.S. State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually don’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in Oct 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card. By law, consumers can get their money back on
goods and services not received if they report the loss within 60
days after the charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one. Some
experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from the tour or cruise
company you’re traveling with. They say buying from a third-party
insurer is better than putting all your money in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health insur-
ance policies cover you if you get sick away from home — but
check before you go, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost luggage insurance isn’t necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see 
if your homeowner’s policy covers your valuables, get baggage
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
88

insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package,
or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at
the airport because it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any
valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage
because many valuables (including books, money, and electronics)
aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended insurers:
 Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com)
 Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919;
www.travelguard.com)
 Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174;
www.travelinsured.com)
 Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602;
www.travelex-insurance.com)
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
For domestic trips, most reliable healthcare plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home. For travel abroad, you may have to pay all
medical costs upfront and be reimbursed later. For information on pur-
chasing additional medical insurance for your trip, see the preceding
section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety.
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 89

Using a Cellphone across the United States
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to the fragmented cellphone system). It’s a
good bet that your phone will work in major cities. But take a look at
your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site before heading
out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak in rural areas. If
you need to stay in touch at a destination where you know your phone
won’t work, rent a phone that does from InTouch USA (% 800-872-
7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-car location, but beware
that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach
of the GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used
by much of the world. Your phone will probably work in most major U.S.
cities, but it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. (To see where
GSM phones work in the United States, check out www.t-mobile.com/
coverage/national_popup.asp.) And you may or may not be able to
send text messages home. (International budget travelers like to send
text messages home because it’s much cheaper than making interna-
tional calls.) Assume nothing — call your wireless provider and get the
full scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you can always rent a phone;
InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Accessing the Internet Away from Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives
you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can
still access your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
New Orleans has plenty of cybercafes. Although no definitive directory
for cybercafes is available — these are independent businesses, after all —
but two places to start looking are at www.cybercaptive.com and
www.cybercafe.com.
The Cyber Bar and Café at the Contemporary Arts Center (900 Camp
St.; % 504-523-1216) in the Warehouse District is popular with the
downtown crowd. In the French Quarter, storm the Bastille Computer
Café (605–607 Toulouse St.; % 504-581-1150) or plug into Royal Access
(621 Royal St.; % 504-525-0401).
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer through which you can access the Internet. And
most public libraries offer Internet access free or for a small charge.
Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant
rates.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
90

Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices, give you basic Web access for a
per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. Only use
Internet kiosks as a last resort because they’re expensive.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it 
has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your
ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web serv-
ice (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For
more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hack-
ers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to access the
GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless “hotspots”
from where you can get high-speed connection without cable wires, net-
working hardware, or a phone line. You can get Wi-Fi connection one of
several ways. Many laptops have built-in Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b
wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have their own networking
technology, Apple AirPort. If you have an older computer, you can plug in
an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) to your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and coffee
shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the United Kingdom
and Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up
wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nation-
wide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com)
have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass
providers also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel-lobby
setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons 
to use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the
lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be complex, with a variety of
monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay
around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and more compa-
nies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more
competitive.
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

You can also find places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi isn’t available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the United States and Europe now offer free high-
speed Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring
your own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home and how much it costs. If you’re traveling
outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers in
most of the world. You have to sign up with an iPass provider, who can
then tell you how to set up your computer for your destination(s). For a
list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on “Individual
Purchase.” One solid provider is i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-
6209 or 920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight. If you show up late, alert an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID ready to show at check-in, the security check-
point, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need 
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for 
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
your home computer. Online check-in involves logging on to your air-
line’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out your board-
ing pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If
you’re using an airport kiosk, bring the credit card you used to book the
ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New Orleans 
92

kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and
a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat,
you will be able to do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller air-
lines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to
make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is also a
good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-
in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline can provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
Because of a terrorist plot thwarted in August 2006, all beverages, oils,
gels, and creams have been banned, with just a few exceptions for liquid
prescriptions and baby formulas. Log onto www.tsa.gov/travelers/
index.shtm for details. Bring food in your carryon rather than check-
ing it because explosive-detection machines used on checked luggage
have been known to mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason)
for bombs. Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag,
plus a “personal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carryon
hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a
laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and relock a checked bag if they need to hand-search your
luggage. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). Luggage inspectors can open these TSA-approved locks with a spe-
cial code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.travel
sentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved locks, your
lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to hand-search
your luggage.

Part III
Settling into 
New Orleans

In this part . . . 
You made it to New Orleans — or at least, you’re ﬁnally
ready to arrive. This part helps you get the lay of the
land, with safety tips, public-transportation options and other
convenient ways of getting around, and tips on where to ﬁnd
banks and ATMs (Chapter 9). You’ll also get the scoop on
booking a hotel room, with tips on rack rates and where to
ﬁnd good deals (Chapter 10).
We also get down to the meat and potatoes of your trip —
yes, the food. A recent America Online and Travel + Leisure
survey ranked New Orleans No. 1 in the United States for
dining out, and you’ll ﬁnd out why (Chapter 11).

N
ew Orleans can be a pretty confusing place, geographically speak-
ing. Throw out your compass, because north, south, east, and west
are meaningless in a city where the sun rises over the West Bank (which
is, strictly speaking, to the east of the city). The Mississippi River
replaces the magnetic poles as the focal point for getting your bearings
here: Upriver is Uptown, downriver is downtown, and lakeside is toward
Lake Pontchartrain.
The city began in the French Quarter, an area that covers 13 blocks
between Canal Street and Esplanade Avenue, from the Mississippi River
to North Rampart Street. The city’s angular layout follows the bend in
the river, making directions such as north, south, east, and west rela-
tively useless. Consequently, you’ll hear New Orleanians use the terms
riverside, lakeside, uptown, and downtown in place of traditional direc-
tions. You’ll have no problem if you remember that North Rampart
Street is the “lakeside” boundary of the Quarter, Canal Street marks the
beginning of “uptown,” and the Quarter is “downtown.” (These bound-
aries aren’t immutable, however, and some locals may use different ref-
erence points. For example, people often refer to the Warehouse District,
which is on the other side of Canal Street from the Quarter, as being
downtown.)
Building numbers begin at 100 on either side of Canal Street. In the
Quarter, however, the numbers start at the river with 400 because the
river swallowed four blocks of numbered buildings before the levee was
built. Street names change when they cross Canal Street — another
reminder of Canal’s traditional role as the border between the old, French
New Orleans (the Quarter) and the new, American New Orleans. Bourbon
Street, for example, becomes Carondelet as it stretches uptown.

This chapter reviews the best ways to enter the city, whether by land or
by air. It also gives you the scoop on the different neighborhoods —
including where to find them and what makes them unique.
Making Your Way to New Orleans
You know you want to visit New Orleans — but how do you want to get
there? Choose the option that best fits your tastes, schedule, and budget.
Arriving by plane
If you fly into New Orleans, you arrive at Louis Armstrong International
Airport, located a good 25-minute drive from the corporate limits of New
Orleans in the suburb of Kenner. The airport’s three-letter airport code,
MSY, refers to the airport’s former name, Moisant International — named
for daredevil aviator John Blevins Moisant. (The SY refers to the fact
that the airport sits on the site of a former stockyard.)
Moisant, as most locals still call it, isn’t the flashiest, most ultramodern
airport in the world. You’ve probably seen larger bus stations in New
York, Chicago, or Atlanta, but Moisant’s small size is a blessing in dis-
guise. The whole place is compact; all concourses are attached to a
single structure, and clear signage directs you to the baggage-claim area
downstairs. Thus, getting around is more or less a snap. Additionally,
you can find information booths throughout the airport and in the bag-
gage-claim area. Also in the baggage-claim area is a branch of the
Traveler’s Aid Society (% 504-464-3522). Hours of service may vary
because the aid desk is staffed by volunteers.
From the airport to the hotel by cab
The easiest way into town if you’re traveling in a group of two or more
people is to take a taxi. Cabs wait in line just outside the baggage-claim
area, so you’ll have no trouble finding one. Expect to pay around $28 for
a taxi ride to the French Quarter or Central Business District for one or
two people, or $12 each if your group includes more than two people.
This price is more or less the same as the cost for a shuttle, and even
cheaper if you’re in a group of more than two or three. Taxis can hold a
maximum of five passengers.
United Cab (% 504-522-9771) is the largest and arguably most reliable
taxi company in the city. Their taxis are usually busy handling radio
calls, however, so they don’t wait in line with the other taxis at the air-
port. Two other reputable companies are A Service (% 504-834-1400)
and Metry Cab (% 504-835-4242). You can also find plenty of mom-and-
pop taxi operations hovering around the airport to catch your fare, most
of which are reputable and won’t rip you off. Still, exceptions always
exist, so if you don’t trust them, call one of the companies listed here.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
98

A trip into town usually takes about 25 to 30 minutes, though that number
varies depending on where you’re headed and what traffic is like on
Interstate 10 (I-10), the city’s main thoroughfare. Generally, tip between
10 and 15 percent.
From the airport to the hotel by shuttle bus
If you don’t want to hail a cab, taking an airport shuttle bus is the next
easiest option for getting into the city. Depending on your situation, taking
a cab may be a more cost-effective and comfortable ride. You can find
airport shuttle information desks in the airport, staffed 24 hours a day.
For $1.50, the Downtown/Airport Express bus takes you to the corner
of Elk’s Place and Tulane Avenue — a 30- to 40-minute ride. The bus
leaves from the upper level near the down ramp about every 23 minutes
from 5:30 a.m. to midnight (every 12–15 minutes during rush hours). 
The Jefferson Transit Authority (% 504-818-1077; www.jefferson
transit.org) can give you more information.
For $13, the Airport Shuttle takes you directly to your hotel from right
outside the baggage area. Taking a taxi costs about the same, or less,
and is more convenient, particularly if you have two or more passen-
gers. The shuttle leaves every 10 to 15 minutes, but the ride can take up
to an hour because you may have to go to several hotels before getting
to your own. In comparison, a cab ride takes only about 25 to 30 min-
utes. Remember to reserve a spot on the shuttle if you intend to ride it
back to the airport. To make your reservation, call % 504-522-3500 or
make arrangements through your hotel’s concierge. The shuttle does
offer wheelchair access.
From the airport to the hotel by “cool car” (rental car)
The New Orleans Police Department refers to a rental car as a “cool car”
because undercover officers sometimes drive a rental car to make it
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Oriented 99
Catching a cab safely
How can you tell if an airport taxi service is legitimate? For one thing, unless you’re vis-
iting during a heavy tourist season (Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras, or a big business conven-
tion) or you’re sharing a cab with other travelers, avoid any driver who attempts to
negotiate with you on the price. Negotiating is common during the previously men-
tioned events, but outside of those times I’ve heard of drivers quoting one price and
then demanding another when they pull up to the hotel. Also, look at the car itself. If it
looks professionally painted, you’re probably safer than if you approach a car that
looks as if someone hand-painted the information over the door. Don’t enter a cab that
doesn’t have a phone number on the door, and don’t get into a cab if something about
the driver rubs you the wrong way; another cab will come along.

seem as though they’re tourists. You can find car-rental counters near
the baggage-claim area of the airport. (See Chapter 8 for a list of car-
rental companies that maintain offices in the airport.) To navigate your
trip from the airport to your hotel, read the directions in the next sec-
tion and check out the “Airport Driving Routes” map in this chapter.
Directions for driving from the airport
Follow one of the many signs at the airport to I-10 East. Take I-10 to the 
I-10/I-610 split, but don’t take I-610, which branches off to your left. Con-
tinue following I-10, which branches right, until you reach the Superdome
(you can’t miss that). If you want to go to the French Quarter, follow I-10
to the left of the Superdome and take the Vieux Carré (French Quarter)
exit. If you’re trying to get to the Central Business District, stay to the
right of the Superdome and exit at Loyola. If you want to reach the Garden
District, stay to the right of the Superdome and take the St. Charles Avenue
exit, which drops you squarely in the Lower Garden District, right on the
cusp of Lee Circle and the Central Business District. Check with your
hotel for exact directions.
Arriving by car
If you drive to New Orleans, you’ll probably arrive by way of one of the
major thoroughfares: highways 90 or 61 or Interstate 10. To see how
your route flows into the Crescent City, see the “Airport Driving Routes”
map in this chapter. Both highways 90 and 61 take you right into the 
city. If you’re following I-10, refer to the previous section, “Directions 
for driving from the airport,” for information on specific exits and road
construction.
Arriving by train
If you’re planning on chugging into New Orleans, your train arrives at
the Union Passenger Terminal (% 504-528-1610; www.amtrak.com) on
Loyola Avenue in the Central Business District, just a few blocks from
the French Quarter. Oddly enough, the station temporarily served as a
post-Katrina jail. After you arrive at the station, taxis are available to
take you into town. (If by some fluke they’re not, call United Cab at 
% 504-522-9771.)
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Several towns and unincorporated areas extend along both the east and
west banks of the Mississippi River to make up the New Orleans metro-
politan area. This section gives a brief tour of some of the distinct local
neighborhoods that make up the city (see the “New Orleans
Neighborhoods,” map below).
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
100

French Quarter (Vieux Carré)
Thankfully, the city’s crown jewel remained high and dry after Hurricane
Katrina. Founded in 1718, the Vieux Carré (or Old Square) comprised the
original city of New Orleans and is now known as the French Quarter.
The oldest neighborhood in New Orleans is bordered by North Rampart
Street, Esplanade Avenue, Canal Street, and the Mississippi River. Many
people enjoy the French Quarter for the European-style architecture sur-
rounding Jackson Square (the old Ursuline Convent dates back to 1742),
Bourbon Street, and the French Market. Despite its small size, it boasts
more restaurants and bars per square inch than any other city (which is
hyperbole, of course, but not by much). During Mardi Gras, the Quarter
is Party Central. However, you won’t find parades here (the narrow, one-
way streets don’t even allow buses, much less floats) but rather throngs
of revelers, exhibitionists, and people-watchers. You can best enjoy the
Quarter on foot, by carriage, or as part of an organized tour.
Central Business District
Canal Street, which did in fact look like a canal after Katrina, roughly
bounds the district on the north, and the elevated Pontchartrain
Expressway (I-90) bounds the district to the south, between Loyola
Avenue and the Mississippi River. In the midst of the high-rise buildings,
you can see bustling squares and parks, including the newly restored
Piazza d’Italia, which was originally built in 1978 to recognize the contri-
butions of the local Italian community. You can also find major attrac-
tions, such as the Superdome and World Trade Center, as well as a
burgeoning Museum District, featuring the National D-Day Museum,
Louisiana Children’s Museum, Contemporary Arts Center, Ogden
Museum of Southern Art, and the Confederate Museum. Luxury hotels
and restaurants and the area’s close proximity to the Quarter (without
the attendant crowds) make it popular with tourists.
Warehouse District
You can find this area between Julia and St. Joseph’s streets within 
the Central Business District, which also survived Katrina relatively
unscathed. Once made up almost entirely of warehouses, adaptive reuse
and revitalization has turned the neighborhood into an upscale residen-
tial neighborhood and Arts District, with most galleries located on what
is known as Julia Row. The Convention Center, Riverwalk Shopping
Center, music clubs, hotels, restaurants, and museums lure visitors.
Garden District
Due to its location not far from the river, the Garden District stayed dry
after Katrina. Explore the Garden District — bordered by Jackson
Avenue, St. Charles Avenue, Louisiana Avenue, and Magazine Street —
via the St. Charles Streetcar and on foot. Originally part of the city of

Lafayette, it became a fashionable residential area after the United States
purchased it and wealthy Americans took up residence there. Visitors
come from all over the world to view the beautiful homes and gardens
along St. Charles Avenue. Anne Rice’s two former homes are located in
this neighborhood, as is the beautifully restored cemetery Lafayette No.
1, and the world-famous restaurant Commander’s Palace, restored and
reopened in 2006 (see Chapter 11).
Lower Garden District
The Lower Garden District, which hugs the river and also stayed dry
after Katrina, houses a number of modest cottages, attractive churches,
and some elegant town houses on Coliseum Square. Developed in the
early 1800s just downriver from the Garden District, many of its streets
are named for Greek Muses — though most have peculiar New Orleans
pronunciations. (Ask a local to direct you to Melpomene Street to hear
what I mean.) St. Charles Avenue, Jackson Avenue, the Pontchartrain
Expressway, and the Mississippi River border this area. Magazine Street
is home to many antiques shops, sidewalk cafes, neighborhood bars,
coffee shops, and boutiques. Exploring the area on foot is safe during the
daytime, though I recommend you don’t stray far from Magazine Street.
Irish Channel
This area, which originally housed many of New Orleans’s Irish immi-
grants, lies between the Garden District’s Magazine Street and the
Mississippi River, with its sidewise boundaries at Jackson and Louisiana
avenues. If you explore this part of the city on foot, only do so with a large
group of people and during the day because it’s not the safest neigh-
borhood in town. During the 1800s, the area was a working-class neigh-
borhood, which explains the abundance of double-shotgun cottages.
(Shotguns get their name because a person can stand in the front door-
way and fire a shotgun out the back door without hitting anything — and
because they’re reminiscent of looking down the barrel of a shotgun.)
Walking around the antiques-shop district on Magazine Street and around
Felicity Street and Jackson Avenue can give you a real feel for the area.
Churches and cemeteries: Mid-City
Originally called “Back O’ Town,” swamp covered this area for much of
the city’s early history. In the early 20th century, however, it was drained
and developed. Because it is a low point in New Orleans, this neighbor-
hood suffered severe flooding in the weeks after Hurricane Katrina and
is in the process of rebuilding. The area, most notable for its churches
and cemeteries, stretches along Canal Street between Esplanade Avenue,
Perdido Street, City Park, and Derbigny Street (though some claim it
starts at Rampart instead of Derbigny). You can experience some parts,
notably along Esplanade itself and City Park, on foot; but for safety’s
sake, stick with a bus or organized tour for other areas, especially the
cemeteries.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
104

Uptown
Jackson Avenue, Claiborne Avenue, the Mississippi River, and Carrollton
Avenue bound this district, the largest area in the city. You find Tulane
and Loyola universities, breathtaking mansions, Audubon Park, Audubon
Zoo, and churches and synagogues. Also in this area are the legendary
music club Tipitina’s (see Chapter 17) and several fine restaurants, 
such as Pascal’s Manale (see Chapter 11). Magazine Street runs through
the district and features antiques shops, boutiques, and art galleries.
Normally, you could take the St. Charles Streetcar to explore, but the 
St. Charles streetcar remains closed as of this writing while undergoing
hurricane-related repairs. Much of the area is perfect for walking or you
can take the Magazine Street bus.
Faubourg Marigny
Faubourg Marigny lies downriver from, and immediately adjacent to, the
French Quarter, bordered by Esplanade Avenue, St. Claude Avenue,
Press Street, and the Mississippi River. This area stayed dry post-Katrina
and was developed during the late 1700s as one of the earliest suburbs.
Today it houses many Creole cottages and bed-and-breakfasts, as well as
a range of residents — from bohemian to metrosexual. I hate to give the
impression that the area is dangerous because overall it’s very quaint
and charming, but some areas can be dicey, so only explore the neigh-
borhood on foot during daylight hours. Generally, Frenchmen Street,
which is a hip entertainment area, is safe, as is most of the neighbor-
hood close to the river. The farther toward Rampart and St. Claude you
get, the riskier it becomes.
Bywater
Bywater, bounded by Press Street, St. Claude Avenue, Poland Avenue,
and the Mississippi River, is just downriver from the French Quarter.
Katrina was kind to it as this area did not flood. Some naysayers call this
region “backwater” because at first glance it seems like a wasteland of
light industry and run-down homes. In fact, Bywater is in the midst of a
renaissance. Originally, artisans, free persons of color, and immigrants
from Germany, Ireland, and Italy called this area home. Now artists,
designers, and residents who simply can’t afford the Quarter or Marigny
live in its Creole cottages and Victorian shotguns. Within this mix are
some funky neighborhood restaurants and bars.
Algiers Point
One of the city’s original Creole suburbs, Algiers Point — which did not
flood — is the only part of the city on the West Bank and it has changed
little over the decades. Here you find some of the best-preserved small
gingerbread and Creole cottages in New Orleans. The neighborhood has
begun to attract a lot of attention as a historic landmark, and makes for
a nice stroll during the day, though I’d stay in the car rather than walk on
foot. (Like parts of Uptown, tranquil areas can give way to less-than-
desirable areas at a moment’s notice.) It’s also becoming a popular
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Oriented 105

neighborhood for locals. A former hole-in-the-wall club called the Old
Point Bar (see Chapter 17) has established itself as a hip musical desti-
nation, adding to the neighborhood’s cachet.
Finding Information After You Arrive
You can find a state-run Tourist Information Center (% 504-568-5661)
in the French Quarter at 529 St. Ann St. in the historic Pontalba Buildings
on the side of Jackson Square. Other information centers dot the city,
many of them owned and operated by tour companies or other busi-
nesses. You can find tourist booths at these locations:
 Canal and Convention Center Boulevard (walk-up booth; % 504-
587-0739) at the beginning of the 300 block of Canal on the down-
town side of the street
 Just outside the World Trade Center (walk-up booth; % 504-587-
0734) at 2 Canal St.
 Near the Hard Rock Cafe (walk-up booth; % 504-587-0740) on the
400 block of North Peters Street
 Julia and Convention Center Boulevard (walk-up booth)
 Poydras and Convention Center Boulevard (walk-up booth)
 New Orleans Metropolitan Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 504-
566-5011; www.nomcvb.com) at 2020 St. Charles Ave.
 Vieux Carré Police Station (small tourist information desk inside
the station; % 504-565-7530) at 334 Royal St.
Getting Around New Orleans
You’ll probably spend most of your time in the French Quarter, which is
only 6 blocks wide and 13 blocks long. Because the area is so small —
and the narrow one-way streets, traffic congestion, strict traffic laws, and
lack of on-street parking make driving a nightmare — I suggest you walk.
If you’re cooped up in a car, you can’t see the sights or hear the sounds
of the French Quarter in the same way as on your own two feet. If you
get tired, you can always hire a carriage and let the mule do the walking.
Use the daylight hours to explore; after dark, stick to well-lit areas with
other people around. Watch out for pickpockets on Bourbon Street.
Avoid contact with panhandlers, and be wary of people who approach
you with a “hard-luck” story — their car broke down, they need money
for gas, or their purse was stolen, for example — no matter how well
dressed or sincere they seem. I’m not telling you to be rude, but use
your judgment. Also avoid people (especially kids) who want to wager
with you; a frequent ruse is “I bet I can tell you where you got your
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
106

shoes.” (You got ’em on your feet.) Or, “I bet I can spell your name.” 
(Y-o-u-r-n-a-m-e.) As always, use common sense when exploring any 
area of the city.
New Orleans features a reliable and thorough public transportation
system — streetcars and buses connect all neighborhoods that you may
want to visit. Call the Regional Transit Authority’s Ride Line at % 504-
248-3900 for maps, passes, and other information about streetcars or
buses. Any of New Orleans’s visitor information centers (including the
main location at 529 St. Ann St. by Jackson Square) also have informa-
tion on public transportation.
If you plan to use public transportation frequently during your stay, 
purchase a VisiTour pass, which entitles you to unlimited bus and street-
car rides. You can purchase one at most hotels and banks in the Quarter,
Central Business District, and along Canal Street in one-day ($5) or
three-day ($12) increments. Two booths also sell them: one outside the
Aquarium of the Americas and the other on the 600 block of Decatur
Street.
Hopping the St. Charles or Canal streetcars
Since 1835, the St. Charles line (see the “St. Charles Streetcar Route”
map in this chapter) has serviced the Central Business District, Garden
District, Lower Garden District, Uptown, and Carrollton neighborhoods.
Unfortunately, for now, in order to view the scenic 7-mile ride (which
begins at the corner of Carondelet and Canal streets and takes you from
downtown to Uptown, or vice versa), you’ll have to take the St. Charles
bus. Most of the St. Charles Streetcar line continues to be closed for
repairs due to Hurricane Katrina, but it should reopen in late 2007.
However, the Central Business loop of the St. Charles streetcar line
(from Carondelete and Canal Street to Lee Circle) should be up and run-
ning in early 2007. See www.norta.org for updates.
New Orleanians giddily anticipated the April 2004 return of the Canal
Streetcar line (see the “Canal Streetcar Route” map in this chapter), 40
years after the last car ran and protesters threw tomatoes at the new
buses. The 51⁄2-mile ride heads up Canal, passing through the Central
Business District and Mid-City, and ends at one of two destinations,
either north on the Carrollton spur to the 1,500-acre urban oasis of City
Park or farther west to the Cypress Grove and Greenwood cemeteries.
Riding either the Canal Streetcar or the St. Charles bus costs just $1.25
each way (exact change or a VisiTour pass is required). Chapter 12 has a
list of sights to see while on the streetcar, which operates 24 hours a
day. In order to maintain its distinction as a moving landmark by the
National Register of Historic Places, the St. Charles Streetcar doesn’t
provide modern amenities such as air conditioning or handicap accessi-
bility. However, the Canal Streetcar features air conditioning, wheelchair
lifts, and a surprisingly quiet, high-tech braking system. The round-trip
for either route takes 90 minutes to two hours.

CANAL ST. STREETCAR
CANAL ST. STREETCAR

Generally, you don’t have to wait too long for a streetcar — usually no
more than half an hour. Downtown, you can board the St. Charles bus
(or streetcar when it returns) at Canal and Carondelet (directly across
Canal from Bourbon Street) and the Canal Streetcar at various stops
along Canal Street on the eastern edge of the French Quarter. You can
also board at a number of designated stops along St. Charles Avenue and
Canal Street, respectively. Like taking a bus, you can get on and off the
streetcar at will, but you have to pay each time you get back on.
The St. Charles line ends, rather inconveniently, at Palmer Park at
Carrollton and Claiborne avenues where you can transfer to another bus
for 25¢. Or, take the return trip and stop at one of the many restaurants
and shops in the Riverbend (at the corner of St. Charles and Carrollton
avenues).
Depending on which destination you choose, the Canal line ends at the
cemeteries, which are safe to explore, or City Park. The latter features
the New Orleans Museum of Art, the spectacular Besthoff Sculpture
Garden, and the always-blooming New Orleans Botanical Garden, all of
which have made an amazing recovery after flooding by Katrina. Families
will want to head straight to Children’s Storyland, an amusement park
(rated one of the ten best in the country by Child magazine). As of this
writing, the Carousel Gardens, which features a nostalgic, wooden-horse
carousel ride, remain closed but people of all ages eagerly anticipate its
reopening.
Because the streetcar is as much a mode of public transportation as a
tourist attraction, it gets pretty crowded, especially at rush hour or
when school lets out in the midafternoon. Also, the Canal Streetcar is
packed during Jazz Fest because it’s the cheapest and most convenient
transportation to the Fair Grounds.
Riverfront seating: The Riverfront Streetcar
Established during the 1984 World’s Fair, the Riverfront Streetcar line
runs along the riverfront from the Convention Center to the far end of
the French Quarter at Esplanade. The approximately 2-mile ride, which
is a great way to see the river, costs $1.50 (exact change or a VisiTour
pass is required). You can board, or get off, along that route at desig-
nated stops. The streetcar is wheelchair accessible.
By bus
Buses in New Orleans may generally be more convenient than street-
cars, but they don’t cover the same routes, and they’re not anywhere
near as picturesque. One or more bus lines connect most neighbor-
hoods, and the fare is $1.25 (exact change or a VisiTour pass is
required). Transfers cost 25¢, and buses are wheelchair accessible.
Because you’re a visitor to New Orleans, you’ll probably need to use
only a few of the bus lines, such as Tulane (if you happen to stay on
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Oriented 109

Tulane Avenue) or Magazine (which runs through the Central Business
District, Lower Garden District, and Uptown between the Garden District
and the Irish Channel). Buses pick up passengers every other block or
so along their routes at designated bus stops. Again, you can get more-
specific information from the Regional Transit Authority’s Ride Line at
% 504-248-3900 or by picking up one of the excellent city maps avail-
able at the Visitor Information Center at 529 St. Ann St.
By taxi
During the day, public transportation is perfectly safe, but I don’t rec-
ommend taking it at night. You probably won’t have any problems if you
get on and off at well-lit major intersections, but I suggest a taxi if you’re
going somewhere not right on the line’s route. A good neighborhood can
take a turn for the worse in just a few short blocks.
Finding an available cab usually isn’t too much trouble, with the excep-
tion of busy times such as rush hour or during bad weather. If a cab is
empty, driving relatively slowly, and its “On Duty” sign isn’t on (if it even
has one), chances are it’s looking for fares. But as in most major cities,
the methods and habits of New Orleans cabbies can be inscrutable. A
cab may be on its way to pick up a radio-call fare. Also, the cabbie may
be on his lunch break, he may be scrutinizing potential fares for the
most lucrative ride (to the airport), or he may just not like the way you
look. If you’re in a hurry, your best bet is always to call ahead for a cab.
The easiest places to find a taxi include the airport, the French Quarter,
and the Central Business District. You can also spot cabs at stands near
restaurants, at all the major hotels, and at some smaller hotels as well. 
If you can’t find a cab on the street, call a taxi company. United Cab 
(% 504-522-9771) is the largest and most reliable taxi company in the
New Orleans area.
A ride for two people to most major tourist areas doesn’t cost more than
$10. All taxis cost $2.50 for the first 1⁄6 of a mile and 20¢ for each additional
1⁄6 of a mile (or $1.20 per mile). If you travel at a rate less than 1⁄6 of a mile
per 40 seconds, the cabbie charges the additional 20¢ anyway. Add $1
for each additional person. The maximum number of passengers is five.
You can also hire taxis for $30 an hour, though taxi companies impose a
two-hour minimum and don’t take you outside the New Orleans area.
During football and basketball games, Jazz Fest, and other special events,
taxi drivers usually expect you to pay $3 per person or the meter rate,
whichever is greater. Special events include regularly scheduled sport-
ing events and/or concerts at the Superdome, Saenger Theater, Fair
Grounds, and most other stadiums.
In the event that you leave a wallet, piece of luggage, or other important
effect in a cab when you exit, call the cab company as soon as possible.
Calmly tell the dispatcher your problem, and provide him or her with
your route details (“I went from Audubon Park to Brennan’s”). In case of

situations such as this, noting your taxi driver’s name (the license
should be clearly posted) and the taxi’s number (which should be
painted on its trunk or on another visible space) is always a good idea.
By car
Though not impossible, driving in New Orleans is a big hassle. Parking is
an issue (except in the French Quarter, where it’s more of a myth).
Navigation is confusing because street names change without warning
and some streets have more twists and turns than an afternoon’s worth
of daytime soaps. As for other drivers . . . well, that’s another story.
Avoiding the French Quarter
Before I go any further, however, absolutely the best, most essential tip I
can give you about driving around New Orleans is to avoid driving in the
French Quarter as much as possible. Why? Driving in the Quarter is a
headache and a half. Unless you’re paid to do it (that is, you’re a cab
driver), it’s not worth the aggravation. The Quarter is small enough, with
everything pretty close together, to navigate on foot.
Parking (or not parking) in the Quarter
Driving in the Quarter is a bad idea for a number of reasons, but the
biggest is parking, which is practically nonexistent; even residents suffer
constant parking woes. Parking spaces are scarce, and the ones that
exist always seem to be occupied by people who got there before you —
even if you get there at 4 a.m. Even if by fate you do find what seems to
be an available spot, chances are it’s illegal (of course, the sign pointing
out this fact is probably obscured or on the other end of the street).
When choosing your hotel, find out whether your hotel has parking
available. If you’re staying in a French Quarter hotel that has parking,
well, great, but limit your car usage to excursions outside the Quarter.
Wait a minute, you’re saying. What if I’m staying outside the Quarter, but
I want to come in to visit? Good point. My advice is to take the Canal or
Part III: Settling into New Orleans

Biking it
If you’re feeling especially adventurous, rent a bike and take your own tour around
New Orleans, using the information in this book as a guide. Bicycle Michael’s 
(% 504-945-9505; www.bicyclemichaels.com) and French Quarter Bicycles
(% 504-529-3136) are two good bets for rentals. Most cyclists in the city ride along
the streets with the car traffic or along the popular bike trails in the greater 
New Orleans vicinity. For a comprehensive list of New Orleans bike shops and 
maps of bike trails, visit the New Orleans Bicycle Club Web site at www.
neworleansbicycleclub.org.

St. Charles streetcars if possible. Otherwise, park in one of the commer-
cial parking lots on Decatur along the river and walk the rest of the way.
You’ll also see commercial lots inside the Quarter, notably for some of
the bigger hotels, but they’re often full, not to mention expensive. Aside
from helping you avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot, parking in
one of these lots is well worth the security of knowing you won’t get
towed — or vandalized.
Navigating the Quarter
The streets in the French Quarter are all one-way, which can make a
simple right turn an elaborate affair. Additionally, certain tourist-heavy
areas — notably Bourbon and Royal streets — are more congested than
a Southern gourmand’s arteries. Pedestrian traffic is thick, massive, and
unrelenting, and no one shows much concern about stopping to let your
car cross the street.
To further complicate matters, tourist traffic completely barricades 
the 300–700 blocks of Bourbon and Royal on weekdays during daylight
hours, which turns the merely impractical into the impossible. Chartres
Street is also closed on the blocks in front of the St. Louis Cathedral.
Additionally, the streets in the French Quarter are narrow, with no room
to pass because on-street parking takes up almost half the available driv-
ing space. The lack of space is bad enough when you’re stuck in a long
line of traffic trying to navigate its way across Bourbon Street, but get-
ting stuck behind a mule-drawn buggy is even worse.
Driving outside the Quarter
Outside the French Quarter, driving is a whole different story. In the
Central Business District, getting around in your car is pretty much the
same as in your main downtown area back home. Parking spots (at least
free ones) can be hard to come by. Traffic can and will be heavy during
morning and afternoon rush hour, and probably during lunch as well.
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Oriented 113
Enjoying a romantic carriage ride
You’ll be hard pressed to resist the mule-drawn carriages at the Decatur Street end of
Jackson Square (9 a.m.–midnight) if you have even one romantic bone in your body.
You’ll get a nonstop monologue on historic buildings, fascinating events of the past, and
a legend or two. Most drivers charge around $8 for adults and $5 for children under
12. A private carriage tour, however, costs significantly more. Contact Good Old Days
Buggies (% 504-523-0804) for a private tour, including hotel or restaurant pickup. See
Chapter 12 for more information. (You can’t ride this one, but the Roman Candy mule-
drawn cart on St. Charles, about a half-mile downriver from Audubon Park, offers
excellent taffy. My favorite flavor is chocolate.)

You can turn right on red throughout the city unless otherwise specified,
but many streets are one-way, and many of those (most notably Tulane
Avenue) don’t allow left turns.
If you park on a parade route, block access to someone’s driveway, or
break other laws, your car may be towed away and impounded, and get-
ting it back can cost you $100 or more. If you think your car has been
towed, call the impounding lot (% 504-565-7235) or the Claiborne Auto
Pound, 400 N. Claiborne Ave. (% 504-565-7450).
The driving situation is a little better uptown in the Garden District and
other areas. You’ll still encounter many one-way streets, however, and as
always, free parking is hard to come by.
Avoiding local hazards: Potholes and drivers
Keep in mind that New Orleans’s streets are famous for their potholes,
some of which qualify as craters. Local drivers have developed a driving
sixth sense; on certain streets, a sort of autopilot takes over that swerves
your car this way or that to avoid wrecking your alignment on a nasty
bump. Being new to the area, you haven’t formed this psychic ability yet,
and some potholes aren’t so easy to see until after they’ve jolted you.
Last, but not least, are the New Orleans drivers themselves. Don’t get 
me wrong — this is my home, and I love it — but the people here don’t
know how to drive. Many possess a dangerous mixture of arrogance and
cluelessness on the road. Rubbernecking, idling in the passing lane, fail-
ure to yield or allow others to merge, and a complete lack of familiarity
with turn signals are all trademark characteristics of local drivers.
Consider yourself warned.

Checking in at 
New Orleans’s Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Finding the hotel you want
 Locating the best price
 Turning up in New Orleans sans reservation
 Checking into the best hotels in the city
 Considering a few more hotel options
M
ost visitors to New Orleans don’t plan to spend much time in
their hotel room, but there’s something to be said for a good
night’s sleep. Or a sudden rain storm could encourage you to stick
indoors for a little while, in which case, you want to be comfortable.
Whether you decide to splurge on a luxurious suite at the Ritz-Carlton or
take refuge in a Ramada, this chapter offers a variety of options — and
aesthetics — in every price range. As a post-Katrina visitor, you might
be pleasantly surprised to find some good deals and open rooms during
the traditional tourism-heavy seasons of spring and fall.
Assessing Katrina’s Effect on Area Hotels
For the most part, it was the bed-and-breakfast establishments, not the
hotels, which fared worst, in terms of both damage and business, since
tourism is still low in the area. I’ve seen “For Sale” signs on many proper-
ties, especially Mid-city, which is a shame; B&Bs such as House on
Bayou Road and the Block-Keller House were the first accommodations
to reopen after the storm, but they didn’t get the support they needed.
Many downtown hotels were either damaged by looters or were roughed
up by the crowds of locals seeking shelter from the storm. Many had
roof damage and water damage as well; The Hotel Monaco had to close
permanently, but other major hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton sustained
damage but have already reopened. French quarter hotels held up better
and had better security in place, so looting was less of an issue.

Getting to Know Your Options
When it comes to lodging, many travelers simply look for the cheapest
accommodations they can find. Or they choose a hotel that’s central to
everything (usually right on Bourbon Street) but end up paying twice as
much.
To make a hotel choice that best fits your needs, decide what’s most
important to you. Whatever your preferences, this chapter helps you
weigh your options by outlining the advantages and disadvantages of
staying in certain neighborhoods. It also gives you an idea of what you
can expect to get, value-wise, for your dollar in New Orleans.
Since the 1960s the people of New Orleans have faithfully preserved the
Quarter’s architectural style. In fact, distinguishing between a new hotel
that has been lovingly placed inside the shell of an older building and a
hotel built from scratch isn’t as easy as it sounds. Even motor hotels
(which provide parking spots and have helped alleviate the ever-present
problem of on-street parking) maintain a distinctly New Orleans look.
Of course, the city does have some high-rise chain hotels, but you only
find them appropriately located in commercial sections, such as the
Central Business District. Many of them have been customized to blend
in with the scenery. Whatever your preference, New Orleans offers a
variety of options.
Watch for the Kid Friendly icon, which points out hotels that are espe-
cially good for families.
Listings also note other special considerations, such as which hotels
accommodate disabled travelers, which places are the most gay-friendly,
which inspire romance, which are convenient to Mardi Gras parade
routes, and so on.
Disabled travelers please take note: Hotels listed as wheelchair accessi-
ble may offer only a small number of these rooms, so ask about availabil-
ity when you make your reservation. Also, “wheelchair accessible”
doesn’t necessarily mean that the hotel is up to the standards of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) — the hotel may just be accessi-
ble from the street and have an elevator and wide doorways. I try to
include any special information about steps, bathroom accessibility, or
other access concerns.
You won’t have any trouble finding atmosphere in this city — even in
more modern neighborhoods. Despite the annual influx of hundreds of
thousands of visitors, New Orleans has managed to keep historic dis-
tricts such as the French Quarter free of skyscraper development.
Because the city is below sea level, engineers found it to be quite a chal-
lenge to create stable, tall buildings. By the time they figured out how to
do it, the French Quarter was a protected historic district that didn’t
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
116

allow new development disproportionate in size to its original buildings.
In fact, the modest, four-story Pedesclaux-Lemonnier House at 640 Royal
St. is still known as the “Skyscraper.” It was built between 1795 and 1811
and is believed to be the first four-story building in New Orleans.
The chains: Tried and true
New Orleans has its share of national chain hotels, such as Holiday Inn,
Hyatt, Marriott, Sheraton, Ramada, and Radisson. Although these hotels
tend to have a homogeneous, seen-one-you’ve-seen-’em-all quality, the
best ones adapt to the color and flavor of New Orleans, both outside and
inside. (One good example is the Holiday Inn-Chateau LeMoyne in the
French Quarter; see its listings later in this chapter.) These chain hotels
usually attract business travelers with moderate expense accounts or
families with children in tow. Many travelers prefer the consistency
assured by a brand name. New Orleans features some fine chain hotels;
this chapter lists the best ones.
Boutique hotels: Quiet luxury
Independent hotels — also called boutique hotels — are smaller in
scope. They can be family-run, mom-and-pop operations (such as the
Hotel Villa Convento in the French Quarter), or part of a small group of
hotels owned by the same company but not part of a cookie-cutter
chain. Boutique hotels may target a specific niche, such as older travel-
ers or budget-minded business travelers. They’re also usually cheaper
than the bigger chains (though this rule isn’t set in stone). Independent
hotels are good spots to soak up local character, but they often have
fewer amenities than chain hotels.
Motels and motor hotels: No frills
Motels are more or less like hotels, only stripped of the amenities. If
you’re willing to forego room service, a swimming pool, or atmosphere
for a cheaper price, go with a motel. Of course, different types of motels
exist — from the ubiquitous Motel 6 to seedy “no-tell motels” — but by
and large, they’re just places to sleep and shower. I don’t recommend
any lodging of this ilk in this book, concentrating instead on places with
character and (usually) amenities; but you can find toll-free numbers for
most of the major motel chains in any metropolitan phone book (and in
the Appendix).
B&Bs and guesthouses: The personal touch
Sure, some of your nicer hotels offer fine service. However, service and
hospitality aren’t the same. For hospitality, head for a bed-and-breakfast.
Breakfast — be it a full, belt-loosening extravaganza or (more likely) of
the continental variety — is only part of the equation. After all, many
hotels also offer a complimentary continental breakfast. So what sets a
B&B apart? Basically, staying in a room in a B&B is a lot like being a
guest in someone’s home. In fact, most B&Bs are someone’s home.
Chapter 10: Checking in at New Orleans’s Best Hotels 117

As with hotels, all B&Bs aren’t created equal. Some are renovated
houses fully dedicated to visitors, with a small living space for the care-
taker’s family tucked discreetly away, and a communal kitchen where
visitors socialize over breakfast. Some are lavish manses, with antique
furniture and floor-to-ceiling picture windows. Such picturesque spots
may offer an impressive breakfast spread and perhaps a glass of wine in
the afternoon as part of the service. Generally, the more you pay, the
higher the level of service and hospitality.
Of course, what’s in a name and what’s offered can sometimes be vastly
different. Many places that call themselves B&Bs are actually closer to
what Europeans call a home stay — residences that rent out extra bed-
rooms, which may sound all well and good, but chances are they’re nei-
ther licensed nor insured. You may not think the difference sounds like a
big deal until you have an accident on the stairs, or you can’t find a fire
extinguisher or a safe exit during a fire. When inquiring about a B&B, find
out whether it belongs to the Louisiana Bed and Breakfast Association
(% 225-346-1857; www.louisianabandb.com). This association’s mem-
bers are licensed, insured, and regularly inspected for fire safety, sanita-
tion, and up-to-date insurance, among other concerns. Be sure to
contact the LBBA to verify membership.
I mention a few choice B&Bs in this chapter. If they interest you and you
want more choices, calling a B&B reservation service is your best bet.
The most reliable (and the most personable as well) is called, appropri-
ately enough, Bed and Breakfast, Inc. Reservation Service (% 800-729-
4640 or 504-488-4640; www.historiclodging.com). Other options are
Bed & Breakfast and Accommodations (% 888-240-0070 or 504-
838-0071; www.neworleansbandb.com), and Garden District Bed &
Breakfast (% 504-895-4302; www.bedandbreakfast.com/new-
orleans-louisiana.html).
Keep in mind that B&Bs are quite popular; regular visitors to Mardi Gras
and Jazz Fest can reserve rooms up to a year in advance. So call early!
Similar to B&Bs are guesthouses, which are often closer in size and spirit
to hotels, though the atmosphere is closer to a B&B. Like B&Bs, native
New Orleanians (or in some cases, visitors who never left) often preside
over them and imbue them with a special brand of hospitality. Like
B&Bs, they’re often furnished with antiques and are heavy on the quaint
old-world charm or cozy, homelike atmosphere. Yet again, like B&Bs,
guesthouses usually serve some sort of breakfast.
The difference between a B&B and a guesthouse comes down to size
and, consequently, the level of service. In a B&B, you may be the only
guest, or perhaps one out of six, and in intimate contact with its opera-
tors. A guesthouse, on the other hand, is often larger, and in all probabil-
ity less intimate. Certainly, that may be exactly what you’re looking for:
more intimacy than a hotel, but without having to actually talk to anyone
while you’re still waking up at breakfast. (At other times, the differences
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
118

between a place calling itself a guesthouse and a B&B are indistinguish-
able; the proprietors probably just thought that the words “guesthouse”
sounded better.)
The upper-crust hotels: Top of the line
You know what I’m talking about here: the cream of the crop, the five-
star, super-swanky affairs that play host to world leaders, top-level rock
stars, and captains of industry. The rooms are spacious and gorgeous,
the staff impeccably dressed and unfailingly solicitous, and the restau-
rants first-rate. Needless to say, the luxurious surroundings and pamper-
ing accommodations come with a hefty price tag.
Finding the Best Room Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get. (That’s because the hotel often gives the
agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her business toward
that hotel.) One of the benefits of a package tour is a discounted rate
(see Chapter 5 for more details).
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in the American Automobile
Association (AAA), AARP (formerly known as the American Association
of Retired Persons), frequent-flier programs, and any other corporate
rewards programs you can think of — or your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in
Chapter 10: Checking in at New Orleans’s Best Hotels 119

which you’re an honorary inductee, for that matter — when you call to
book. You never know when the affiliation may be worth a few dollars off
your room rate.
The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is another traditionally
slow period. New Orleans can be quite pleasant at this time, especially if
you’re looking to avoid crowds. For more insight into seasonal and
weather considerations, refer to Chapter 3.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
You can generally shop online for hotels in one of two ways:
 By booking through the hotel’s Web site
 By booking through an independent booking agency (or a fare-serv-
ice agency like Priceline)
Internet hotel agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of
late, competing for the business of millions of consumers surfing for
accommodations around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon
to consumers who have the patience and time to shop and compare the
online sites for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary
considerably from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of
a site’s listing may be there for no other reason than that they paid
money to get the placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia (www.expedia.com) offers a long list of
special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can
see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that
the best rooms are often held back from bargain booking Web sites).
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) posts unvarnished customer
reviews and ranks its properties according to the AAA rating system.
Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent free pro-
gram, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search multiple
hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard of — and con-
veniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes and serv-
ice charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb), is
partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reser-
vations systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have to
fax or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which
get misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at
the hotel, only to be told that they didn’t have a reservation. To be fair,
many of the major sites are undergoing improvements in service and
ease of use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reser-
vations systems of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news
for consumers. In the meantime, get a confirmation number and make
a printout of any online booking transaction.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
120

In the opaque Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com) and
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com) are even better for hotels than for airfares.
With both sites, you’re allowed to pick the neighborhood and quality
level of your hotel before offering your money. Priceline’s hotel product
even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much better at getting five-star
lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at the bottom of the
scale. On the down side, many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least
desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingforTravel Web site (www.
biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on a hotel room on Priceline; it
features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major
cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is
nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels don’t provide loyalty program credits
or points or other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room
through opaque online services.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room.
Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and have
more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always
cost more. If the hotel is under renovation, request a room away from
the construction. Inquire, too, about the location of the restaurants,
bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise. If you
aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. 
If another room is available, the front desk staff should be happy to
accommodate you, within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation
Assume that through circumstances beyond your control, you’re sud-
denly plopped down in New Orleans without a hotel reservation. Don’t
panic. Unless Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, or one of the other larger, room-
hogging events is taking place, you’ll likely find several hotels with avail-
able space. First, look through the listings in this chapter for hotels and
call the ones that appeal to your preferences and budget. If that doesn’t
yield results, you have a few options:
 Call Turbotrip.com (% 800-473-STAY), the French Quarter
Reservation Service (% 800-523-9091 or 504-523-1246), or one 
of the B&B agencies listed elsewhere in this chapter.
 If you’re stranded at one of the major French Quarter hotels and it’s
full, ask if the front desk staff can check around for you and see
what other rooms are available. If the staff can’t, check your lug-
gage with the hotel in case someone cancels a reservation while
you check around on your own.

Esplanade Ridge
Patrick and Karma Ashton’s elegant 1861 Greek revival mansion is a stand-
out on Esplanade Avenue, a natural ridge of land that saved it from severe
flooding during Hurricane Katrina. However, the historic home did sustain
some damage to one wall, which is in the process of being repaired. It’s
also given the Ashtons a long-sought opportunity to add some elegant
architectural details and other updating. Be sure to admire the carefully
restored original fixtures and woodwork, including a leaded-glass door and
black onyx and marble fireplace mantels. If you like a European feel and
claw-foot tubs, ask for the Pontalba or Napoleon room in the main house.
If you prefer more modern amenities, request the Charpantier room in the
former service quarters shaded by a 300-year-old live oak. The French
Quarter is nine blocks away through some iffy areas, so come with a car
or cab fare.

B&W Courtyards Bed & Breakfast

Faubourg Marigny
The coziness of this hospitable B&B may inspire you to forever forgo chain
hotels. Current owners Rob Boyd and Kevin Wu went to ingenious lengths
to convert three 19th-century buildings into appealingly quirky guest
rooms. The four rooms and two suites are all completely different (you
enter one of them through the bathroom). Though room size varies, the
surroundings are uniformly beautiful with two small courtyards, a foun-
tain, a Jacuzzi, and a sundeck. Breakfast is light but beautifully presented.
They take good care of you here. Alas, such hospitality may come to an
end as this property is on the market for $1,750,000 as of this writing. After
Katrina, many business owners are facing difficult decisions or just want-
ing a change after such a life-changing event. Hopefully, B&W will be pur-
chased by someone who maintains its well-earned rep.

This moderately priced hotel, which you can’t beat for location and price,
was largely spared from Katrina’s wrath with just a little wind and rain
damage. The stately, old-world interior featuring hand-painted wall murals
offers a respite from the near-constant bustle of Decatur Street. Rooms are
small but comfortable and almost all of them have high ceilings. Some
include wrought-iron balconies that overlook a relaxing flagstone court-
yard, koi pond, and pool.

Block-Keller House
$–$$
Mid-City
Innkeepers Bryan Block and Jeff Keller purchased and completely restored
this classical-revival villa as a magnificent B&B just a couple years before
Katrina hit. Six feet of standing water over the course of three weeks
destroyed their once lovely basement guest rooms, however, the raised
main house remained safe and dry. The elaborate parlor with its gorgeous
stained-glass windows contrasts nicely with the simple Arts and Crafts
dining room. Guests will enjoy exploring the luxurious accommodations
of this historic beauty, not to mention the gentle companionship of resi-
dent Labradors Milo and Buster. The once lush gardens were ruined by
the flood, but have been replanted. Thanks to the sub-tropical climate,
they are quickly growing back. Flowers will replace the spot where the
shady live oak once stood, another victim of the storm. As of this writing,

the Block-Keller House is listed for sale, so its future as a B&B is uncertain.

Bourbon Orleans Hotel
$$–$$$
French Quarter
None of the rooms sustained damage from Katrina, which is quite fortu-
nate considering the hotel spent more than $15 million on renovations pre-
ceding the storm. Determining this lavish hotel’s best feature is
impossible. Is it the central location at the corner of Bourbon and Orleans,
the historical pedigree, or the extravagantly decorated public spaces? The
extravagance, by the way, extends to the rooms — you find Golden Door
Spa toiletries in your bathroom, and you can order room service through
your television. The double rooms are comfortable and bigger than aver-
age. The bi-level suites feature living rooms with pullout sofa beds that are
good for children, who will also appreciate the hotel’s outdoor pool. Be
sure to request a room closer to Royal Street and sidestep the clamor of
Bourbon. The on-site restaurant offers good meals, and the elegant lobby
features a nightly cocktail hour. In-room amenities include Wi-Fi, dataport
and fax.

Chateau Hotel
$–$$
French Quarter
One of the best buys in New Orleans, this hotel sits far enough off Bourbon
Street to be quiet and intimate but is still within walking distance of virtu-
ally everything in the Quarter. Most of the rooms have antiques, giving the
place a French provincial look. The rooms are a little on the dark side, but
they’re actually quite clean. The hotel includes a picturesque pool sur-
rounded by a flagstone courtyard with chaise lounges. With your room fee
you get a continental breakfast and newspaper. Seniors, be sure to ask
about the 10 percent discount.

Chateau Sonesta Hotel
$–$$$
French Quarter
Located in the former D. H. Holmes Department Store building — the 1913
facade has been retained — the Chateau Sonesta is one of the newest
hotels in the Quarter. Flooding on Canal Street damaged its famous Clock
Bar and required renovation of half of the hotel’s rooms. Despite the older
exterior, the rooms are large, if generic, and some feature balconies over-
looking Bourbon Street. Among the noteworthy amenities are an outdoor
pool, tropical courtyard and fountain, beauty salon, and health club. All
rooms have minibars, and for those who can’t escape their computers, the
phones have dataports. Fans of the Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel, A
Confederacy of Dunces, will be relieved to know that the statue of the
book’s unlikely hero, Ignatius Reilly, was safely stored during Katrina and
is now back at the Canal Street entrance.

The Columns
$$–$$$
Uptown
The Columns is one of the few surviving examples of late-1880s Italianate
homes designed by renowned local architect Thomas Sully (see two more
Sully beauties at 4010 St. Charles Ave. and 1531 Carrollton Ave. from the
streetcar). In 1915, a hurricane destroyed the original four-story tower but
thankfully spared the rest. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina blew the roof off and
caused considerable wind and water damage, though the gorgeous
Victorian Lounge with its grand staircase and stained glass survived. This
once magnificent home was in need of updating and maintenance prior to
the storm, so this could be a blessing in disguise and renovations should
be complete by the end of 2006. The room size reminds you that this hotel
was a 19th-century home; some rooms are cozy in a way that suggests ser-
vants’ quarters, while others are more expansive. I’m partial to the third-
floor Pretty Baby Suite (named for the Brooke Shields movie filmed here),
with its lovely Victorian decor. Its spacious, columned porch is a favorite
meeting spot for locals, and hotel guests are encouraged to unwind on the
huge second-floor balcony overlooking the avenue. Jazz bands sometimes
serenade happy-hour patrons and always entertain the Sunday champagne
brunch crowd.

Dauphine Orleans Hotel
$$–$$$$
French Quarter
Katrina caused terrible roof damage to this luxurious establishment,
though thankfully it’s already been repaired and reopened. Here you’ll find
just the right blend of charming old-world history (ghosts have been
sighted on the premises) and modern elegance, well removed from the
madness of Bourbon Street. Lounge in one of the secluded courtyards or
read for a spell in the guest library. Bird lovers also flocked to the hotel’s
buildings in the rear, which once served as the studio for John James
Audubon. Among the eyebrow-raising amenities are a 24-hour fitness
room, Nintendo for the kids, a Jacuzzi, an in-room safe for valuables, and
complimentary French Quarter transportation. The staff can also hook you
up with a babysitting service. Continental breakfast is served until 11 a.m.,
and complimentary tea is served every afternoon.

Doubletree Hotel New Orleans
$–$$$
Central Business District
Families will be happy to learn that this kid-friendly hotel has repaired its
hurricane damage and reopened its doors. To their great credit, the staff
took excellent care of guests stranded by the storm. Located at the foot of
Canal Street, the Doubletree offers great views of the bustling Central
Business District and the river. Sure, it’s part of a chain, but the atmos-
phere is pleasant. Rooms are good-sized and comfortable; bathrooms are
adequate. The hotel even features a rooftop pool that the kids can enjoy,
as well as a fitness center. You also find a nice restaurant and a breakfast
cafe on the first floor. The kicker for your small fry: Nintendo in every room
and delicious chocolate-chip cookies when you check in. (They’re so good,
you may not want to share them with the kids.)

rooftop pool, workout area, and beauty shop, you may never want (or
need) to leave. The hotel offers a lot of local lore: Huey Long used to hold
court in the Sazerac bar on the first floor (see Chapter 16 for more infor-
mation on this respected gathering place). President Bill Clinton often
stayed here when in town. The rooms are as beautiful as you can expect
for the price, and each one has its own fax machine for business travelers.
A bonus for the tykes: Each room has Nintendo gear. If you visit during the
winter, be sure to step inside the lobby to experience its one-of-a-kind hol-
iday decorations.

Faubourg Marigny
High and dry, this friendly inn occupies two 1860s Creole townhouses and
enjoys loyal repeat business from those who’ve fallen for its slightly funky
charms. Rooms vary in size; some are downright tiny (if that’s important,
ask about size when making a reservation). Some rooms have private bal-
conies; others are loft bedrooms with a sitting area. All are individually
decorated and furnished with antiques. A tropical courtyard features a
pool and hot tub.

Grand Victorian Bed & Breakfast
$$–$$$$
Uptown
The name pretty much sums up this elegant B&B; the appointments here
are grand, indeed, and remain intact post Katrina. Famed New Orleans
architect Thomas Sully designed the house in 1893, and the proprietor
Bonnie Rabe went to great lengths to restore the house to its original glory.
The rooms vary in size but are uniformly elegant with handsome antique
furniture; some bathrooms feature Jacuzzi tubs. A bountiful continental
breakfast is offered either in the dining room or on the porte-cochere bal-
cony. Business travelers can use available fax and copy machines, as well
as dataports for computers.

Holiday Inn-Chateau LeMoyne
$$–$$$
French Quarter
In contrast to its cousin in the Central Business District, this Holiday Inn
sports an abundance of New Orleans–style character. Although the build-
ings are more than a century old (some of the rooms overlooking the
courtyard are converted slave quarters), the historic ambience doesn’t
extend to the guest rooms, which are more or less standard for the chain,
although comfortable. During its temporary Katrina-related closure, the
hotel made some nice improvements, including new landscaping in the
courtyard and around the pool, plus super service from staff who are
happy to be back. It’s just around the corner from Bourbon Street but
nonetheless removed from the noise of the Quarter and convenient to
Canal Street. The restaurant serves breakfast only, but you can order room
service until 10 p.m. No video games in the rooms, but an outdoor heated
pool and proximity to French Quarter attractions like the Aquarium of the
Americas make this a good spot for the small fries.

Holiday Inn-Downtown Superdome
$–$$
Central Business District
According to its Web site in August of 2006, “Guests will be required to sign
a release form upon check-in due to post-hurricane conditions which are
impacting the level of services and the length of occupancy we can pro-
vide at this time.” That said, you might want to give the hotel a call to
check on the status prior to making a reservation here. Accessibility is the
key word when describing this hotel. Conveniently close to the Superdome
and New Orleans Arena, it’s a good bet for sports fans. It’s also close to
the city’s business and financial centers and not too far from the French
Quarter (though probably farther than you’d want to walk, especially at
night). Each room has a balcony and a city view, but they’re standard size
for the chain and decorated in typical Holiday Inn style (not that there’s
anything wrong with that). The hotel also features a heated pool on the
roof. In-room Nintendos and movies make this a good bet for kids.

Hotel Maison de Ville
$$–$$$
French Quarter
The Maison de Ville blends the charm and size of a B&B with the service
and elegance of a five-star hotel, even post Katrina, when many hotels lost
their staff and are having to make do with a smaller number. Perhaps that
explains why Tennessee Williams was a frequent guest. Antiques are abun-
dant, and a beautiful courtyard welcomes you with a fountain and banana
trees. The rooms vary in size (some are downright tiny), so ask when you
call, as price is no indication of what you get. In-room amenities include
bathrobes, hair dryers, and other standard fare; two-bedroom cottages
and suites have coffeemakers. Continental breakfast is served on a silver
tray in your room, in the parlor, or on the patio. Complimentary sherry
and port are served in the afternoon and evening. Unless you don’t mind
noisy streetscapes, ask for a room that doesn’t overlook busy Bourbon. In
fact, if peace and quiet is what you’re after, I’d recommend the spacious
Audubon Cottages, some of which have their own private courtyards.

Hotel Monteleone

French Quarter
The largest and oldest hotel in the Quarter, the Hotel Monteleone is one of
the best big hotels in New Orleans. Thankfully, Katrina completely spared
it. The rooms come in a variety of styles, from smaller spaces to modern
and comfortable family rooms to plush, antiques-filled suites. You can
likely find a room here even when the rest of the city is booked. The hotel
is famous for its extravagant lobby as well as for the revolving Carousel
Bar, with its pleasing view of Royal Street. Laundry, a fitness center, Wi-Fi
and a babysitting service top a list of amenities that also includes a heated
rooftop pool and a hot tub. It’s often voted the city’s most romantic hotel
and is one of only three hotels nationwide noted as a literary landmark by
the Friends of the Library Association. Authors who have stayed here
include William Faulkner, Richard Ford, Ernest Hemingway, Rebecca Wells,
Eudora Welty, and Tennessee Williams

Nestled in a series of 19th-century buildings, Hotel Provincial’s atmosphere
(including flickering gas lamps) makes it feel smaller and more intimate
than it really is, more like a guesthouse than a hotel. Rooms have the high

ceilings of an earlier age and are decorated with French and Creole
antiques. The hotel is located in a quiet stretch of the French Quarter, so
you can wind down in peace after a day of sightseeing. Local ghost hunters
swear this place is haunted because it was used as a hospital during the
Civil War. No damage occurred during Hurricane Katrina.

House on Bayou Road
$$–$$$$
Mid-City
Stepping into the luxurious quiet and elegance of this 18th-century home
is like entering a time machine. The rooms and two cottages are individu-
ally decorated with antiques, though the small Creole cottage was dam-
aged by a tree and is being repaired. The big barn was also destroyed by
Katrina and the gardens suffered as well, though they have been replanted
and will return as lush as ever. The staff serves a complimentary full plan-
tation breakfast, and guests can help themselves to beverages in a
minifridge throughout the day. Hostess Cynthia Reeves occasionally offers
public cooking classes, for which guests receive a discount. Sadly, this his-

International House
$$–$$$$
Central Business District
Apparently, the youth and vigor of local developer Sean Cummings 
translates into sensual, state-of-the-art sanctuaries. The extraordinary
International House — whose Beaux Arts building was constructed in 1906
to house the world’s first trade center — now has a soul mate in
Cummings’ latest vision, Loft 523 (see “Runner-Up Hotels,” later in this
chapter). Condé Nast Traveler-London named International House one of
the “Top 10 Boutique Hotels” in the United States, and I expect Loft 523
will soon follow suit. Suave locals savor drinks by candlelight in lovely loa
(a voodoo word for deity or Holy Spirit). Guests can request any number
of pampering packages, from the romantic “Southern Flower Bath” (mas-
sage for two is just the beginning) to “Voodoo Chic” (an authentic voodoo
priestess transforms your room into a spiritual, personal altar). Busy
moms and dads appreciate the “Kid Kit,” a special welcome kit of New
Orleans coloring books and crayons, a CD with lullabies, a cable movie
schedule highlighting children’s programming, daily delivery of the Times-
Picayune turned to the kids’ activities page, and surprise gift from local
shopkeepers. Licensed, experienced nannies are available to watch little

Loft 523, are the only two in the city that are completely smoke free. There

Lafitte Guest House
$$–$$$
French Quarter
This eccentrically charming guesthouse is conveniently located on the
quiet end of Bourbon Street, only a quick walk away from the action. Built
in 1849, the three-story brick building features wrought-iron balconies on
the second and third floors (the outside has been completely restored and
looks great). There was substantial water damage post Katrina, so the
guest house was closed for renovations and reopened in March 2006. The
updating did not change the Victorian flair, though some are now more
modern than others. Rooms vary in size; the penthouse suite (room 40)
takes up the entire third floor and accommodates up to six people.
Breakfast is brought to your room in the morning, and guests are invited
to snack on wine and cheese for a “social” in the parlor in the afternoon.
Dry cleaning and babysitting are also available. A sweet touch includes
pralines on the pillows.

Lamothe House
$–$$$
French Quarter
If you don’t like the shiny, homogenized feel of a chain hotel, the slightly
faded, threadbare ambience of this place may be up your alley. Even the
name suggests a Dickensian air of moth-eaten mustiness. A plain Creole-
style facade belies the interior, which boasts a mossy, brick-lined court-
yard with a fish-filled fountain and banana trees. You also find a swimming
pool and hot-tub spa. The rooms, decorated with antiques, are well worn
in a cozy way. Room sizes vary according to price, so ask when reserving.
Minor renovations, such as swapping out old carpet, did not dampen its
old-fashioned charm.

A unique blend of 17th-century grandeur and modern appointments makes
this hotel truly elegant. The lobby is a dazzling array of chandeliers,

out by the storm but have since been replaced. Rooms of varying sizes fea-
ture original artwork and European and American antiques. Services
include 24-hour room service, concierge, babysitting, laundry and dry
cleaning, and a complimentary shoeshine. You can indulge yourself in
complimentary hors d’oeuvres on weekday afternoons in the Gallery
lounge or peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches served with chocolates and
milk in the lobby each evening. Other amenities include a heated pool on
the roof — whose damaged tiles were replaced — a fitness center, and a

Le Richelieu Hotel
$–$$
French Quarter
Amazingly, the hotel reopened in April 2006 despite the water damage to
40 rooms when the roof sprung leaks during the storm. Located on the
Esplanade edge of the Quarter, Le Richelieu offers convenience and tran-
quil old-world charm. Balconies overlooking the street or courtyard and
pool accompany many rooms. You can order breakfast and lunch in the
courtyard from the small in-house restaurant, or you can eat in the lounge
adjacent to the pool. All rooms come with hair dryers, irons and ironing
boards, and refrigerators. If you really want to go first class, ask for the
VIP suite with its three bedrooms, kitchen, living area, dining area, and
steam room. One of the nicest hotels in the Quarter in its price range, it’s
also the only hotel in the Quarter that offers free self-parking. Despite the
surcharge, the hotel is very kid friendly with its away-from-Bourbon loca-
tion and sunny pool. In fact, Sir Paul McCartney and his late wife, Linda,
stayed here with their kids back in the day when he was working on a
Wings album.

Maison Dupuy
$–$$$
French Quarter
Roof damage forced the Maison Dupuy to close temporarily, but it
rebounded in April 2006. This picturesque hotel, made up of several town
houses, has been the site of a cotton press (the first in the United States),
a blacksmith shop, and a sheet-metal works. Today, it blends the clock-
work efficiency of a large hotel with the attentive service of a B&B. You
find desks and comfortable armchairs inside the large rooms, many of
which have balconies that overlook the courtyard. On Sundays, the hotel
restaurant serves a champagne and jazz brunch buffet. Dominique’s is a
nice place to wind down at the end of the day and enjoy award-winning

Lower Garden District
Closed a mere three weeks after Katrina, one of the city’s best B&Bs played
host to FEMA staff. It sits in the beautiful Garden District on a street known
for its funky atmosphere and abundant dining and shopping options. The
antiques-filled rooms are lovely and spacious (some bathrooms are just
huge). Many rooms feature artwork by local artists for sale. The public
areas are gorgeous and comfortable. Amenities include a hot tub, sub-
tropical garden (fresh flowers may be waiting in your room), and a small
pond whose resident turtle comes out for feedings. The owner provides
perfect personal service while still giving guests plenty of privacy.

Melrose Mansion
$$$
Faubourg Marigny
This restored mansion is intimate, romantic, and elegant — all adjectives
that don’t come cheap though lately, the service is not what it once was.
Perhaps it’s making do with a smaller staff post Katrina. The spacious
accommodations have Victorian-era furnishings. Bed sizes, room sizes,
and amenities vary; some have wet bars, Jacuzzi tubs, and separate seat-
ing rooms. A breakfast of muffins, fruit, and quiche is served in the parlor
or in your room. The manse also offers a heated outdoor swimming pool
and a menu of off-site services (Swedish massage, aromatherapy massage,
manicures, and pedicures). This place is popular, so book as far in advance
as possible, however, be aware that there is a strict cancellation policy.

French Quarter
This gay-friendly establishment, painted bright pink, sits just outside the
Quarter, a stone’s throw from Armstrong Park and Donna’s (see Chap-
ter 16). The 1848 Creole main house has spacious rooms, while the former
slave quarters have accommodations that are even larger. Both buildings
Part III: Settling into New Orleans

were completely renovated after roof damage thanks to Katrina. All rooms
are tastefully decorated with different color schemes. The lush courtyard
bravely withstood Katrina’s winds and features a tropical garden with
plenty of fresh greenery, a banana tree, and intricately carved old foun-
tains (as well as beer and soda machines and a handy ice machine). Be
sure to look for the resident kitty on the premises. Just as an FYI, the sur-
rounding neighborhood is chancy at night the farther you get from
Rampart, so take a cab rather than walk.

Omni Royal Orleans
$$–$$$$
French Quarter
This is one of the best chain hotels in the city because of its central loca-
tion and excellent service. The hotel escaped any Katrina damage. Its richly
decorated rooms aren’t uniform in size, so communicate your needs when
reserving. The one downside for families is that only a few rooms have two
double beds, but the hotel can supply a rollaway bed. The rooftop swim-
ming pool/observation deck appeals to kids, while parents appreciate the
relatively cheap (and bonded) babysitting service. Amenities include ter-
rycloth bathrobes (upon request), umbrellas, makeup mirrors, an exten-
sively equipped fitness center, irons and ironing boards, and emergency
mending and pressing services. The hotel’s Rib Room is one of the city’s
premier restaurants (see Chapter 10).

Pontchartrain Hotel
$–$$$$
Garden District
This cherished local landmark that dates back to the 1920s is normally an
oasis of tranquility and beauty, but in the days following Katrina, what
wasn’t taken by looters were damaged by water from blown-out windows.
Recent renovations have struck a nice balance between a worn, old-world
feeling and a freshness of more modern hotels. Antique furnishings will no
doubt be replaced. Rooms are comfortable and larger than most standard
hotel rooms. Suites are named after the many celebrities of the ‘40s, ‘50s
and ‘60s who stayed here, including Richard Burton, Carol Channing, 
Joan Fontaine and Mary Martin. The unique romantic ambience here is
unmatched even in a city known for its atmosphere. Probably the biggest
scandal was Rita Hayworth and Aly Kahn’s secret trysts through neigh-
boring suites. The hotel usually offers 24-hour room service and other
amenities, however, room service, valet service and bell service are tem-
porarily unavailable as the hotel continues to recuperate.

Prince Conti Hotel

French Quarter
This small but friendly hotel boasts a congenial and helpful staff as well
as a prime location just off Bourbon Street that isn’t too noisy. The rooms
are very comfortable, and many are furnished with antiques, but the bath-
rooms can be downright microscopic — toilets are practically on top of
the sink. Travelers with kids should probably opt for the establishment’s
sister hotel, the Place d’Armes, which has a swimming pool and is farther
removed from Bourbon Street. The Bombay Club, located on the first floor,
is famous among locals for its genteel atmosphere and serves the best
martinis in town (see Chapter 16). Fortunately, this hotel was basically
untouched by Katrina.

Ramada Plaza The Inn on Bourbon Street
$$$
French Quarter
This nicely appointed hotel is located right on Bourbon Street and was
spared by Katrina. As a result, its southern décor and amenities are some-
times lost on guests who just want to roll out of bed and into a bar or
daiquiri shop. If you plan on sleeping while you’re here (as opposed to just
passing out), ask for an interior room, somewhat insulated from the street
noise. But then you may not get a room with a balcony overlooking 
the action, which can be especially handy around Mardi Gras. (Decisions,
decisions . . . ) All rooms are standard in size, yet comfortable, and have
king or double beds. Amenities include a fitness room, a business center,
a jewelry shop, and a concierge who can put you in touch with babysit-
ting services.

The four-star Sonesta rightfully brags that it never closed during or after

Bourbon Street location and a gracious, classy hotel. Rooms are a bit more
upscale than standard hotel rooms but otherwise pretty typical. Many fea-
ture balconies overlooking Bourbon Street, a side street, or a courtyard
with a large pool. For a good night’s sleep away from the noise of the street,
request an inner room. The hotel features an exercise room, business
center, excellent concierge service, and room service until 2 a.m. This
hotel is the best place in the Quarter to catch a cab — they line up right
at the corner.

St. Charles Guest House

Lower Garden District
The guest house suffered Katrina damage, including fallen ceilings, broken
siding and rampant looting. The owners cleaned up the mess and valiantly
reopened in January 2006. Even with the renovations, character and econ-
omy are still the operative words here. The property consists of three sep-
arate, connected buildings, the oldest of which dates back about 100 years.
Atmospheric touches balance out a general lack of modern conveniences;
rooms don’t include televisions or phones, though each building has its
own pay phone (including one in a fascinating antique phone booth).
Room sizes vary, with backpacker rooms available at the very low end,
though these lack air conditioning and private baths. A continental break-
fast is served in a cottagelike room that looks out on the courtyard and
swimming pool.

Soniat House “one of the best hotels in the world.” The rooms are com-
fortable, though bathrooms are small. Oriental rugs, fine French and
English antiques, and beautiful paintings (some on loan from the New
Orleans Museum of Art) furnish the rooms. More rooms (some have
Jacuzzi bathtubs) are available in the annex of suites across the street. For
an additional charge you can get a continental breakfast; the large, fluffy,
baked-to-order biscuits and homemade strawberry preserves are worth
the price alone. Thankfully, there was very little storm damage here.

Once voted by Condé Nast Traveler as the best hotel in North America, 
the Windsor is truly magnificent — from its Italian marble and antique 
furnishings to its impeccable service — and about as expensive as you’d
expect. The hotel is 90 percent suites, though even the smaller guest
rooms are spacious. All suites feature balconies or bay windows with
views of the city or river. They also have fax machines, minibars, kitch-

plush robes, a hamper, high-end personal care items, and extra hair dryers.
(Ask about amenities when you call because they aren’t the same in each

age room service. Conference rooms are available for business travelers.
The hotel also features a resort-size pool, a health club, laundry and dry
cleaning, and in-room massage. If you can afford it, this hotel is the place
to go for serious pampering. The hurricane caused minor damage that was

N
ew Orleans clings firmly to its reputation as a mecca for great
food. The city’s port-town status, unique ethnic mix, and proxim-
ity to Cajun Country all make it a combustible culinary-proving ground.
Locals are happily spoiled by the rich tradition of good food, from craw-
fish étouffée to oyster po’ boys to shrimp Creole. After living in exile in
Illinois for a number of months after Katrina, I realized how spoiled I’ve
been. Food elsewhere tastes so bland in comparison, and the only solu-
tion I’ve found so far is hot sauce. Almost everything you eat in New
Orleans is fried or served in a rich, buttery sauce — or both. If this hor-
rifies you, you’ve picked the wrong place to visit. Although the city
offers some healthy alternatives, if you skip the decadent pleasures of a
New Orleans meal, you’re missing the point. Enjoy yourself here; eat
responsibly when you get home.
Assessing Katrina’s Effect on the Dining Scene
The dining scene did not change much from a tourist perspective
because most of the restaurants you’ll probably visit are on higher
ground and did not flood. But from a local perspective, the difference is
drastic. Steakhouses and soul food joints seemed to take a dispropor-
tionate beating. Some, like Commander’s Palace, were closed for an
extended period but then reopened (in their case, to great fanfare)
whereas others, sadly, are permanently closed. Chateaubriand Steak
House in Mid-City, Marisol in Faubourg Marigny, and Maximo’s in the
French Quarter all closed after their owners moved elsewhere. Katie’s in
Mid-City, where I used to go for shrimp or oyster po-boys, was flooded

Restaurants whose future 
remains uncertain
Bella Luna (914 N. Peters St., French Quarter; % 504-529-1583; www.bellaluna
restaurant.com). The City of New Orleans owns the building and no repairs to the
roof have been made yet, so chef-proprietor Horst Pfiefer says he cannot reopen,
though plans may change. For now he stays busy with his catering facility, The
Foundry, in the Warehouse District.
Camellia Grill (626 S. Carrollton Ave., Carrollton/Uptown; % 504-866-9573). The restau-
rant was closed before Katrina and is on the market. Let’s hope the buyer returns this
popular diner to its former glory and starts serving up its famous pecan waffles again
soon.
Christian’s (3835 Iberville St., Mid-City; % 504-482-4924; www.christians
restaurantneworleans.com). The Bergeron family is not sure whether they will
reopen this restaurant, housed in a pink-pastel former church. If they do, the damage
was so extensive that there may be some major changes.
Dooky Chase (2301 Orleans Ave., Treme; % 504-821-2294; www.dookychase
restaurant.com). Flood damage and looting has not kept owner/chef Leah Chase
from promising that her famous Creole cooking and soul food will return. Menu high-
lights once included excellent gumbo, crispy fried chicken, and some of the city’s best
hot bread pudding — it’s worth calling during your visit to see if it’s reopened yet. Take
a cab if you go, as the neighborhood’s a bit dicey.
Dunbar’s (4927 Freret St., Uptown; % 504-899-0734). After flooding very badly, it’s
unclear whether his great soul food restaurant will return. Perhaps as the area around
it recuperates, the owner will take steps to rebuild.
Gabrielle (3201 Esplanade Ave., Mid-City, % 504-948-6233; www.gabrielle
restaurant.com). This crowd-pleasing Parisian cafe, owned by Greg and Mary
Sonnier, remained dry but a fallen tree punctured the roof and caused a lot of water
damage anyway. They are not coming back to Mid-City but are contemplating a move
to Uptown end of 2006.
Mandina’s (3800 Canal St., Mid-City; % 504-482-9179). As most locals know, the build-
ing housing Mandina’s was not in great shape before the storm, but that was part of
this beloved neighborhood restaurant’s charm. Six feet of water didn’t help the struc-
ture. However, the owners went against the odds and decided to renovate. They hope
to reopen before the spring of 2007. See p. 182.
Ruth’s Chris (711 N. Broad St., Mid-City; % 504-486-0810; www.ruthschris.com).
This is the original location for Ruth’s Chris, but the company has long outgrown its
family roots, so sentimentality no longer influences this restaurant’s fate. I don’t think
it will reopen as the neighborhood was iffy before and now that it’s damaged so badly,
it will be a recovery zone for quite some time.

with 6 ft. of water; it was repaired but won’t reopen. Michael’s Mid-City
Grill, which once offered great burgers and jukebox entertainment (and
a daredevil $150 burger), will not return — a huge loss, in my opinion.
Many restaurants in my neighborhood of Lakeview were destroyed,
including Sid-Mar’s, which had been built on land that was surrounded
by water on three sides; I guess it was inevitable that it would be
destroyed by a hurricane, but I had hoped that it would not be in my life-
time. One of my saddest moments was trying to visit the restaurant and
finding that all that remained of the place was the pilings (which the
Army Corps of Engineers now owns as it seized the land near 17th Street
Canal breach).
The list goes on and on. There are too many to name here, but you’ll find
that we’ve left all now-closed restaurants from our last edition on the
maps (marked “closed permanently”), so you can get a glimpse of
Katrina’s effect. But again, remember it is neighborhoods outside of
many of these maps that were hit the hardest.
And there are some whose fate could go either way. Owners of those
establishments are faced with difficult questions: “Should I stay or go? 
If I rebuild, will the neighborhood return, too? Will visitors be willing to
drive through areas in various stages of rebuilding to come to my restau-
rant?” You’ll find a box marked “Restaurants whose future remains
uncertain” in this section. I’ve optimistically included as many restau-
rants from the last edition as I could, and we’ve left them on the maps 
as well (marked “closed, may reopen”), in case they do reopen.
Those restaurants that are open still have their challenges, so please try
to be understanding if they have limited menus, fewer waitstaff, and
shorter hours of operation.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
National dining trends eventually show up in New Orleans, but hot chefs
here mostly set their own trends, employing ingredients and methods
from different cuisines and creating marvelous new combinations. In the
aftermath of Katrina, I think New Orleans chefs take even more pride in
how unique their menus are. More importantly, locals and tourists alike
have an even better appreciation for it. As in Cajun and Creole cooking,
fusion is a large part of what food in New Orleans is all about. Influences
as varied as Spanish, Italian, West Indian, African, and Native American
contribute to a wide range of choices — from eclectic gourmet dishes to
down-home Southern cooking. (For additional information on local cui-
sine, see Chapter 3.)
Chapter 11: Dining and Snacking in New Orleans 149

Thanks to the ubiquitous presence of celebrity chef and Food Network
superstar Emeril Lagasse, Louisiana cooking has a higher profile than
ever. His restaurants, Emeril’s, Nola, and Emeril’s Delmonico, draw
large crowds looking for daring and creative Creole/New American cook-
ing (and maybe a celebrity sighting or two). However, Lagasse is far from
the only popular chef in New Orleans. Bayona’s Susan Spicer, René
Bistrot’s René Bajeux, Restaurant August’s John Besh, Upperline’s
Kenneth Smith, and Brigtsen’s Frank Brigtsen are just a few of the names
you’re likely to hear bandied about by local foodies. One name I can
almost guarantee you’ll hear often in your gastronomic adventures is
Brennan — with restaurants such as Bacco, Brennan’s, Commander’s
Palace, Mr. B’s Bistro, and Palace Café, this family is the dining scene’s
answer to the music scene’s Neville and Marsalis dynasties.
The French Quarter
Although the Quarter is widely regarded as tourist headquarters, it has
an almost unbelievable number of standout restaurants that locals regu-
larly patronize. A list of the best is much too long to run here, but a 
partial sampling must include classy favorites such as Arnaud’s and
Brennan’s, as well as wackier (and much cheaper) options such as Café
Maspero and Clover Grill. Plenty of great spots exist in between those
extremes, from the contemporary Italian fare at Irene’s Cuisine, to the
romantic ambience at Bayona.
Central Business and Warehouse Districts
Emeril’s is one of the biggest names on the local scene — and with good
reason. Locals also flock to The New Orleans Grill for one of the most
elegant dining experiences in the city. On the other end of the scale,
Mother’s exemplary sandwiches are cheap (and a calorie-counter’s
nightmare), and Taqueria Corona’s mouth-watering combination plat-
ters (uno y medio with a shrimp flauta is my favorite) offer plenty of food
for little money.
Carrollton, Garden District and Uptown
In the recent past, you could sum up your argument for the Garden
District as a gourmet hot spot in just two words: Commander’s Palace.
After all, the James Beard Association voted it best restaurant in the
United States a few years back — the food-industry equivalent of receiv-
ing an Oscar. Commander’s reopened in October 2006 after a complete
renovation. Also try Restaurant August and René Bistrot. Uptown,
savvy gourmands flock to Upperline for chef Kenneth Smith and propri-
etor JoAnn Clevenger’s creative Creole collaborations and Brigtsen’s in
the Riverbend. Farther out, but worth the trip, Jacques-Imo’s has such
an incredible vibe that locals endure as much as an hour-and-a-half 
wait — the highest praise imaginable in this town.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
150

Mid-City
This neighborhood was absolutely devastated by flooding from
Hurricane Katrina and parts of it remain in bad shape. As you can imag-
ine, all of its restaurants suffered greatly as a result, but a surprising
number are trying to make it, even without much of a resident popula-
tion yet. The owner of the Creole Dooky Chase is committed to repairing
and hopes to open in 2007. Before the storm, Mid-City’s restaurant repu-
tation was heating up thanks to the reinstated Canal Streetcar. On the
Carrollton spur, you once found Gérard and Eveline Crozier’s welcome
return to fine dining with Chateaubriand Steakhouse and the newest
location of popular Vietnamese chain Pho Tau Bay, but sadly, both are
now closed for good. (The Pho Tau Bay on the West Bank did not flood
and is still open.) At the intersection of Canal and Carrollton, Juan’s
Flying Burrito is back with its servers lip-synching speed metal and hip-
hop. The owners of Christian’s, which served French/Creole in a con-
verted church, don’t yet know if they will reopen. Everyone loved
Gabrielle for its French cafe ambience and Creole/Cajun menu, however,
hurricane damage forced the owners to consider relocating it Uptown.
Serious steak lovers once herded into the original Ruth’s Chris Steak
House (where the popular chain originated), but it seems that the Broad
Street location is doomed (see the box at the beginning of this chapter
for an update). Personally, I could never decide which place I preferred
for a po’ boy — cheery, folksy Katie’s or blue-collar, mom ’n’ pop
Liuzza’s, home of the giant frozen beer mug. As long as they both come
back, I promise to alternate visits to ensure they both get much-
deserved support.
A word on tourist spots
Aside from the really obvious tourist draws, locals don’t go out of their
way to avoid too many restaurants. You will, however, find a dispropor-
tionate ratio of tourists to locals at such Cajun-leaning establishments as
K-Paul’s, Michaul’s, and Mulate’s, which isn’t necessarily a reflection on
the food itself. A large proportion of tourists usually just means that a
restaurant is geared more toward visitor-friendly standby dishes, while
locals familiar with the basics seek out more inventive fare. (In all fair-
ness, K-Paul’s is arguably an exception to this rule; its high tourist count
has a lot to do with chef Paul Prudhomme’s familiar name and French
Quarter location.)
Making reservations
When a review recommends that you reserve a table at a restaurant, it
generally means for dinner. You can usually get a table for two at lunch
without having to wait too long (if at all). With a couple of exceptions
(noted in the reviews), the same goes for breakfast.
Chapter 11: Dining and Snacking in New Orleans 151

Restaurants in New Orleans do a very brisk business except during the
hot summer months. Consequently, make reservations before you even
leave home if you want to dine at a certain restaurant at a particular
time. You may need to reserve a table a month or more in advance, par-
ticularly during Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, if you want to eat at one of 
the most famous restaurants. If you forgot to make reservations, arrive
early — before noon (or even before 11:30 a.m.) for lunch and before
6:30 p.m. for dinner.
Dressing to dine
Legend has it that Antoine’s restaurant once turned away Mick Jagger
because he wasn’t wearing a jacket. Whether that’s true or not, top-of-
the-line restaurants such as Arnaud’s and Commander’s Palace obvi-
ously require the full jacket-and-tie treatment. Other than that, though,
New Orleans, being a tourist-dependent market, is pretty casual about
dress codes. Most serious dining spots require the much less stringent
“business casual” look (a nice shirt and a jacket or blazer; jeans are usu-
ally allowed, but only if they’re in good condition — if you’re uncertain,
call the restaurant ahead of time). Even the best restaurants allow
casual wear at lunch. And obviously, no one is going to kick you out of a
corner po’ boy shop for wearing shorts, flip-flops, and a Hawaiian print
shirt. Check the individual restaurant listings that follow for special
dress requirements.
Lighting up
When it comes to smoking in restaurants, New Orleans is slightly more
lenient than the rest of the United States. Although many restaurants
prohibit smoking or relegate it to certain sections (notably in the French
Quarter, where space and atmosphere are at a premium), many others
still tolerate it. If smoking is a priority for you, call ahead to find out the
restaurant’s policy.
Rewarding good service: Tips on gratuities
A general guideline for tipping is 15 to 20 percent, depending upon the
level of service and quality of experience you receive. Because most
restaurants are just getting by with a smaller staff, please be sure to gen-
erously tip those servers who make you happy. And if your service is
somewhat slow, take a look around the dining room. Your server might
be responsible for more tables than usual and doing the best he or she
can. In fact, a few months after the storm, I went to dinner with some
friends and clearly, the waitstaff was few and far between despite full
tables and many more people waiting to be seated. So my friend’s
boyfriend helped bus tables! If he didn’t already have a girlfriend, I guar-
antee you he would’ve gotten one soon enough before the night was
over because he was a hero in the eyes of many. As more people return
to the city and restaurants hire more staff, service will continue to
improve.

Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
I’m sure you won’t be shocked to discover that many tourist places —
especially in the French Quarter — charge inflated prices for “signature
New Orleans dishes” simply because they can. Keep in mind that many
Chapter 11: Dining and Snacking in New Orleans 153
Trying some of New Orleans’s ethnic eats
As if the roulette wheel of local culinary combinations wasn’t enough, New Orleans,
like most mid-sized cities, also offers its fair share of ethnic fare. Although I don’t go
into great detail, check out a few of the best spots with this highly selective and sub-
jective list.
Chinese: Five Happiness (3605 S. Carrollton Ave., Carrollton, % 504-482-3935). Badly
flooded by Katrina but now open.
Cuban: Liborio Cuban Restaurant (321 Magazine St., Lower Garden District, % 504-
581-9680). Reopened in October 2005 after cleaning up a huge mess from the defrosted
refrigerators and freezer.
Japanese: Horinoya (920 Poydras St., Central Business District, % 504-561-8914) 
and Sekisui Samurai (239 Decatur St., French Quarter, % 504-525-9595), open for 
business.
Mediterranean: Moonlight Café (1921 Sophie Wright Place, Lower Garden District, 
% 504-522-7313), badly looted after the storm, but owner Hassan Khaleghi is deter-
mined to return.
Mexican: Juan’s Flying Burrito (2018 Magazine St., Lower Garden District, % 504-
569-0000; 4724 S. Carrollton Ave., Mid-City, % 504-486-9950), both up and running
despite flooding at Mid-City location, and Taqueria Corona (857 Fulton St., Warehouse
District, % 504-524-9805; 5932 Magazine St., Uptown, % 504-897-3974), also up and
running.
Middle Eastern: Lebanon’s Cafe (1500 S. Carrollton Ave., Carrollton, % 504-862-6200),
and Mona’s (3901 Banks St., Mid-City, % 504-482-7743; 4126 Magazine St., Uptown, 
% 504-894-9800; 3149 Calhoun St., Uptown, % 504-861-2124), the Mid-City location
went up in flames a couple years ago, possibly by an arsonist, but the restaurant pre-
vailed. Then Katrina came and the building flooded with 5 feet of water, once again
forcing the owners to decide whether they want to rebuild it yet again or focus on their
other locations. They opted to save the Mid-City location and it is now open for busi-
ness. Hurrah!
Thai: Basil Leaf (1438 S. Carrollton Ave., Carrollton, % 504-862-9001), open for 
business.
Vietnamese: Lemon Grass Restaurant (217 Camp St., Central Business District, % 504-
523-1200) and Pho Tau Bay (216 N. Carrollton Ave., Mid-City, % 504-485-SOUP; 1565
Tulane Ave., Central Business District, % 504-524-4669), only the location on the West
Bank is open as the two New Orleans locations flooded.

New Orleans specialties, such as jambalaya, étouffée, red beans and rice,
muffulettas, and po’ boy sandwiches were made with common ingredi-
ents out of economic necessity. Any place that charges you a ton of
money for any of these is just ripping you off. You can find incredibly
tasty versions of these staples very cheaply at any number of places, so
go elsewhere.
Another way to save some dough without sacrificing the quality of your
New Orleans dining experience is by visiting the city’s fancier restau-
rants for lunch rather than dinner. Lunch menus almost always offer
more-affordable versions of a particular institution’s signature dishes.
Eating lunch at the more expensive restaurants frees you up to frequent
looser, less-expensive spots, such as Clover Grill or Franky and Johnny’s
for dinner.
Conversely, you may want to skip lunch altogether, fortifying yourself
with a few snacks during your afternoon sightseeing. Of course, granola
bars and the odd piece of fruit can only take you so far, in which case
you can bend this idea slightly, maybe grabbing a Lucky Dog or a quick
po’ boy.
New Orleans’s Best Restaurants
Grab your fork and get ready to loosen your belt a notch or two because
this section explores New Orleans restaurants. I start with my picks of
the best and/or most popular restaurants in the city, arranged alphabeti-
cally. The price range, neighborhood, and type of cuisine follow the
restaurant name. After that, use the indexes to help you identify what
best suits your tastes and needs.
The reviews also make note of which restaurants are wheelchair accessi-
ble. Call ahead to inquire, however, because some of these places may
still be inconvenient — for instance, tables may be too close together.
One further note: Even if this whole book covered nothing but New
Orleans restaurants, it still couldn’t do justice to the many fine establish-
ments in the city and its outskirts. These reviews are necessarily brief
and to the point. Because space constraints prohibit me from highlight-
ing every worthy establishment, this chapter is merely meant to provide
a representative sampling, filled with no-brainers, conventional-wisdom
choices, and my personal faves.
What the $ symbols mean
Dining in New Orleans ranges from low-key and friendly to white-gloved
formal. To let you know what to expect price-wise, the restaurant listings
in this chapter are accompanied by a dollar symbol ($), which gives you
an idea of what a complete meal (including appetizer, entree, dessert,
one drink, taxes, and tip) costs per person. Most listings contain more
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
154

than one symbol — for example, $–$$ — to indicate the general price
range you’re likely to encounter at each restaurant. Aside from price
ranges, the difference between one ranking and the next also reflects
extras such as location, reputation, type of cuisine, atmosphere, interior,
service, and view. Check out Table 11-1 for the lowdown on the dollar
symbols.

New Orleans’s Top Restaurants from A to Z
Antoine’s
$$–$$$$
French Quarter
FRENCH/CREOLE
Amazingly, Antoine’s is still owned and operated by the family that
founded it 160 years ago. The restaurant suffered wind and rain damage
during Katrina; however, most of the building is now restored and ready to
be of service. The biggest loss is the tragic passing of 71-year-old maitre’d
Cliff Lachney, who tried to ride out hurricane Katrina at home with his
handicapped son. Like so many others, they perished in flood waters. If
you go to Antoine’s, be sure to offer a toast in his memory, even if you
never had the luck to meet him. The menu features old-world dishes such
as pompano Pontchartrain (the grilled fillet is topped with tender crab-
meat sautéed in butter) and trout amandine. The 15 dining rooms, some of
which are still closed for repairs, run the gamut from plain to opulent, and
some sort of caste system governs the seating process. (The front dining
room is “reserved” for tourists, and locals are aghast to be mistakenly
seated here.) Antoine’s gets away with this by virtue of its place in New
Orleans culinary history — it’s the birthplace of Oysters Rockefeller. Save
room for the enormous baked Alaska; after William Faulkner received the
Nobel Prize for literature, he was served one inscribed “the Ignoble Prize.”

Arnaud’s
$$–$$$
French Quarter
CREOLE
Founded in 1918, Arnaud’s is a frequently overlooked classic New Orleans
restaurant, which bodes well for locals. The restaurant sustained very
minor storm damage. Unlike some other old-line haunts, the food’s qual-
ity hasn’t diminished with age, and neither has the decor, which features
antique ceiling fans, flickering gas lamps, and dark wood paneling. The
restaurant consists of 12 buildings connected by stairs and hallways — it
sprawls leisurely over an entire city block. Start with the signature shrimp
Arnaud marinated in tangy remoulade sauce, followed by Creole bouilla-
baisse or filet mignon (the latter rivals most local steakhouses). Only the
most serious chocoholics can manage to devour every sinful spoonful of
the Chocolate Devastation dessert. Before or after your meal, head
upstairs to wander the spooky, dimly lit Mardi Gras Museum featuring cos-
tumes and other memorabilia owned by Arnaud’s founder, Germaine Wells.
For a less formal but no less pleasing experience, try Arnaud’s neighbor-
ing brasserie, Remoulade.

Bacco
$–$$
French Quarter
CREOLE/ITALIAN
Normally, I would be shocked to find plastic plates in a Brennan restaurant,
but considering it was one of the brave few establishments to reopen a
mere month after Katrina, they could’ve placed the food right in my hands
and I wouldn’t have cared. It was just such a joy to have good New Orleans
food again, albeit a limited menu to start. With its Gothic arches and
Venetian silk chandeliers, this sumptuously decorated testament to
Brennan good taste combines the rich flair of Creole with the hearty com-
fort of Italian. Executive chef Chris Montero’s signature dishes include
housemade ravioli stuffed with Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp tossed in a
champagne butter sauce garnished with caviar, and grilled tuna topped
with seasonal seafood salsa. Like most Brennan restaurants, the desserts
are always to die for, but I tend to play favorites. The fabulous tiramisu,
topped with a light mascarpone cream, just melts in your mouth. Thank
goodness President Bush spent an evening here during his first post-
Katrina visit. It should help him remember why it’s so important that New
Orleans’ culture — and cuisine — be saved.

Bayona
$$–$$$
French Quarter
INTERNATIONAL
Bayona was chef-owner Susan Spicer’s first foray into New Orleans dining
and remains one of the city’s most beloved institutions. It was such a relief
to know that she returned to the post-Katrina kitchen. Housed in a 200-
year-old Creole cottage, the mood is romantic and relaxed, yet invigorat-
ing. The only casualty of the storm was the wine cellar, which is tough, but
it certainly could’ve been worse. Tasting the superb cream of garlic soup
is worth forfeiting a kiss later, trust me (though I would encourage your
dining partner to order the same). Any entree with lamb is heavenly, espe-
cially the peppered lamb loin with herbed goat cheese and Zinfandel
sauce. Just when you think your taste buds are peaked, one bite of the
toasted pecan roulade — with caramel mousse and praline syrup — and
you’ll reach new heights of ecstasy.

The Bistro at Maison de Ville
$$–$$$
French Quarter
ECLECTIC/INTERNATIONAL
There was a little water damage here, but The Bistro was up and running
again by Mardi Gras 2006. Stepping inside The Bistro is like entering a
Parisian bistro, with its red leather banquettes, beveled-glass mirrors, nat-
ural wood flooring, and Impressionist-style paintings. One of the city’s
best-kept secrets, the Bistro is popular among locals for many reasons,
from the intimate atmosphere to the inventive dishes and extensive wine
list. The leap from “intimate” to “cramped” is short here, however, and the
small size can also mean a good wait (especially when the theater crowd
pours in). The menu changes every three months, but, depending on the
season, you’re likely to encounter and enjoy such options as confit of duck,
house-smoked duck breast, grilled Italian sausage and cannelini bean cas-
soulet, or roasted pavé of salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and scallops
and served with a grilled vegetable polenta cake.

Brennan’s
$$–$$$
French Quarter
BREAKFAST/CREOLE/FRENCH
One of New Orleans’ most treasured restaurants was closed for eight
months thanks to a mess caused by a defrosted freezer on the third floor.
Of course, you’ve heard of Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Well in New Orleans, the
tradition is Breakfast at Brennan’s. The morning repasts here have clogged
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
158

generations of arteries with multicourse feasts featuring such sauce-laden
options as Eggs Portuguese (poached and served in a puff pastry ladled
with hollandaise), Eggs Benedict, Eggs Hussarde, and Trout Nancy (they’re
big on proper names here). Such extravagance isn’t without its price;
spending $50 on breakfast alone is easy (Shoney’s all-you-can-eat, this
ain’t). In spite of the cost, Brennan’s is always crowded at breakfast and
lunch; expect a bit of a wait, even with a reservation. Dinners are generally
calmer, especially if you can snag a table on the gas lamp–lined balcony.

Brigtsen’s
$$
Carrollton/Uptown
CAJUN/CREOLE
I love that many of the city’s finest restaurants are tucked into former
homes. The atmosphere in this quaint Victorian cottage is both elegant
and cozy, thanks to chef-owner Frank Brigtsen’s expertise in the kitchen
and his wife Marna’s warm welcome at the door. Brigtsen’s closed tem-
porarily but returned to the scene before we became truly concerned
about its future. The menu changes daily because Brigtsen prefers to use
local ingredients whenever possible, but his reputation as one of the city’s
best chefs remains constant. Brigtsen knows his way around rabbit (a
Creole mainstay), and the well-proportioned seafood platter allows you to
sample flaky grilled fish, tender baked oyster, spicy deviled crab, and other
creative incarnations. Dessert ranges from the familiar comforts of café au
lait crème brûlée to the tangy surprise of homemade lemonade ice cream.
See map p. 164. 723 Dante St. (take the St. Charles Streetcar; get off at the corner 
of St. Charles and S. Carrollton avenues, and walk 3 blocks; take a taxi at night).

Café Maspero

French Quarter
SANDWICHES/SEAFOOD
Nothing has changed for this local hangout since Katrina and we like it that
way. This place is always packed, and for good reason (its Decatur Street
location certainly doesn’t hurt). Café Maspero serves seafood, grilled 
marinated chicken, and other familiar fare (though you won’t find po’ 
boys here), as well as kiddie-friendly items such as burgers and deli 
sandwiches — almost all served with fries, in impressively large portions,
and at ridiculously low prices. That is, low in relation to the rest of the
Quarter, anyway. The cafe also offers a huge selection of beers, wines, and

Commander’s Palace
Garden District
CREOLE
This New Orleans gem opened in October 2006 to great fanfare. Awarded
the Lifetime Outstanding Restaurant Award from the James Beard
Foundation, Commander’s Palace always lived up to its reputation. Even
in a city full of top-notch, elegant restaurants, Commander’s Palace main-
tains a soft spot in locals’ hearts with a winning combination of stellar
service (you’ll be pampered by several attendants throughout your meal),
a grand setting (an 1880s Victorian House with a seemingly endless series
of dining rooms and a gorgeous courtyard), and outstanding food. The
sumptuous turtle soup with sherry is justly famous, and such bright spots
as the boned Mississippi roasted quail (stuffed with an awesome Creole
crawfish sausage) and the mixed grill (which features lamb and rabbit
sausage) light up the menu. Lastly, when the staff suggests the bread pud-
ding soufflé for dessert, you would be wise to do as they say.

and walk 2 blocks along Washington Ave. toward the river; take a taxi at night).

Court of Two Sisters
$$–$$$
French Quarter
CREOLE
The bottom line is that the atmosphere here — a historic building with a
large, graceful courtyard (once again filled with flowers post-Katrina),
soothing fountains, and a wishing well — is better than the food. A strolling
jazz band serenades you during the daily jazz brunch, though most locals
avoid it (the brunch, not the band) for fear of looking like tourists. The
food is often impressive but rarely spectacular. The jazz brunch boasts
more than 60 dishes, including meat, fowl, fish, vegetables, fresh fruits,
homemade breads, and pastries. For dinner, stick to safe bets such as the
chicken Michelle or shrimp remoulade (and keep in mind that the restau-
rant maintains a $15 minimum for dinner). Desserts are very good, though;
splurge on the pecan pie or crêpes suzette. A children’s menu offers
shrimp or chicken fingers, with baked potato or fries, a fruit cup or ice
cream, and milk. Kids 5 to 12 can also partake of the brunch buffet for $10.

$$
Central Business District
CREOLE/NEW AMERICAN
Because so many of New Orleans’ culinary giants were closed for so long,
Cuvée got a chance to really shine. Young executive chef Bob Iacovone
experiments with seasonal ingredients and multicourse tasting menus. The
cavernous exposed-brick dining room, lit by gaslight, sets a perfectly inti-
mate mood for such contemporary French creations as seared sea scallop
and vermouth-poached mussels with chorizo-stuffed pasta. I’m glad I
saved room for the roasted banana tapioca pudding topped with brown
sugar, rum ice cream and salted cashews. No doubt this establishment will
continue to collect accolades and fans.

Uptown
CREOLE/ECLECTIC
The decrepit bargeboard house on an industrial corridor doesn’t look that
appetizing, but inside you find a young Uptown crowd hungry for con-
temporary Creole dishes. The couple for whom the restaurant is named
sold it to staff after Katrina, which made me a little wary. Thankfully, every-
thing is as good if not better than it was before. You may want to fast ear-
lier in the day to take advantage of the sumptuous starters like steamed
artichoke with warm brie crab dip and an entree-cum-sampler Duck
Quatro (duck prepared four ways: confit, foie gras, duck liver cognac flan,
and seared breast with white beans). Desserts are deadly; linger over
lemon mascarpone crêpes or delight in the crunch of the crispy chocolate
fritter.

BREAKFAST/CREOLE
As home prices and rents rose in the French Quarter and Faubourg
Marigny, artists and other creative types increasingly headed toward
Bywater, which in turn re-energized the community and gave new life to
the darling little shotguns, Creole cottages, and Italianate center halls.

Then Katrina came, and Elizabeth’s changed hands, which I found rather
worrisome. Thankfully, the only thing that really changed was the break-
fast hours, which now start later. But who cares when you can eat praline
bacon! Elizabeth’s attracts locals from the farthest reaches of town
because very few places offer breakfast period, much less the marvelous
omelettes or waffles topped with cooked apples. If you’re not an early bird,
come for lunch or dinner instead. You can’t go wrong with any seafood
dish or sandwich. Daily specials like BBQ and meatloaf are winners, too.
Service is refreshingly attentive.

Emeril’s

Warehouse District
CREOLE/NEW AMERICAN
Often the general public mistakes fame and money for super powers, so it
came as no surprise that celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse was unfairly tar-
geted as someone who didn’t do much for the city in the weeks and
months after Katrina. But guess what? The Bam Man is back with all three
of his New Orleans restaurants up and running again, which employs
locals and boosts tourism. I’d say that helps the city a lot! Lagasse’s spe-
cialty is what he calls “New New Orleans Cuisine,” using Creole tradition
as a foundation while exploring bold new directions. The desserts out-
number the entrees here, and the menu changes often, but the rack of
lamb and fresh duck are favorites, and the grilled, Creole-seasoned chicken
is a crowd-pleaser as well. Don’t miss the banana cream pie with banana
crust and caramel drizzle sauce, which has reduced diners to moaning and
pounding on the table to express their pleasure (I’m not kidding). Service
can be a little snooty, but when the food is this good, it can be overlooked.

One of the classiest restaurants in New Orleans still guided by the same

the return of the second-floor dining area (closed since World War II),
Galatoire’s didn’t accept reservations, and even made the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor wait for a table — or so the legend goes. Before
Katrina, locals liked to debate whether Galatoire’s was still the best or
merely coasting on its reputation? Those in the know (including those who

crabmeat meunière from the à la carte menu, and you’ll be persuaded that
this staunchly traditional spot is still a contender. This old-line restaurant
is especially beloved post Katrina because it would be simply unimgain-
able if it had been lost. If you want to snag a coveted table in the mirrored,
first-floor dining room — where heeled locals watch each other preen —

CREOLE
I’m eagerly anticipating the return of this romantic Creole restaurant, set
in an old converted neighborhood drugstore. It was remodeled after roof
damage ruined the interior and some equipment, and it should be open
for business by the time you read this. The upscale menu has typically
included appetizers such as duck confit and eggplant crisps, and the
grilled hanger steak (similar to flank) is a hit, though you may opt for the
roasted chicken, served with wild mushrooms, garlic potatoes, and green
beans. Try the triple-layer cheesecake (with chocolate, pecan, and almond
layers) for dessert, or if it’s available, the tarte tatin (apples and sun-dried
cherries with a strawberry sorbet).

her already stellar reputation as the mastermind behind Bayona and the
former Cobalt. The decor is suitably minimal, assuring no distractions
from the adventurous cuisine. Offerings such as braised lamb shanks, duck
confit, and fried frogs’ legs dot a menu that veers between Gallic familiar-
ity and New American experimentation. Satisfy your sweet tooth with
coconut macadamia nut pie or the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate beignets.

FRENCH PROVENÇAL/ITALIAN
Closed briefly after Katrina, you can once again follow the scent of 
garlic — and locals — to this tiny restaurant located on the corner of a
parking garage. Despite a brisk pace, the dark atmosphere (the waiters
carry flashlights for a reason) can be really romantic. Start off with an
appetizer of grilled shrimp served with just-so crunchy, panéed oysters.
Follow that up with rack of lamb (served with a port wine sauce and herb
garlic potatoes) or roasted chicken Rosmario, draped in a luxuriant rose-
mary gravy. If you’re into the texture as well as the taste of the food, I rec-
ommend the bread pudding with roasted pecans for its alternating
crunchy and creamy spoonfuls. Prepare to wait up to 90 minutes for a
table; your patience will be amply rewarded.

Say it with me: Jock-a-moe’s. People will gladly wait for more than an hour
for some of the tastiest Southern soul food imaginable served in a cozy,
low-lit dining room adorned by swamp murals. You can take the easy way
out and order tender fried chicken or the stuffed pork chop, and no one
would blame you. But the menu has a creative, experimental bent that’s
well worth pursuing compliments of owner Jack Leonardi (he’s the guy in
Bermuda shorts, even in winter) and chef Austin Leslie (you’ll see him at
work when you pass through the bustling kitchen to get to your table). 
A seafood-stocked Cajun bouillabaisse is an unexpected treat, as is 
the savory shrimp and alligator cheesecake appetizer in a rich, spicy
cream. If you can find the room (and if you can, my hat’s off to you), try the
coffee bean crème brûlée dessert. Everything is still fine and funky here
post-Katrina.

CAJUN
The hoopla about Cajun cooking started back in the early ’80s with living
legend Paul Prudhomme and his renowned restaurant, which offers
upscale (and high-priced) takes on traditional Cajun fare. Many of the red-
hot chefs and restaurateurs in New Orleans today learned at the stove of
Prudhomme. Clearly dedicated to New Orleans and its culinary tradition,
Prudhomme founded “Chefs Cook for Katrina,” a nonprofit organization
that continues to make meals for tens of thousands of relief workers and
clean-up crews. The menu, which changes daily and features a variety of
extra-hot interpretations of the Cajun tradition, is known for its blackened
redfish and Cajun martini. Also try anything with rabbit, the fiery gumbo,
or the Cajun popcorn (fried crawfish tails). If it’s available for dessert,
order the sweet potato pecan pie with Chantilly cream. You won’t find a
children’s menu per se, but several items are kid-compatible and nonspicy.

Typical of most Uptown restaurants, there was no flooding but beaucoup
nasty refrigerators to throw away. Now Lilette is fresh and pretty once
again. The namesake for chef-owner John Harris’s quaint bistro was a
French woman with whom he cooked during an extended stay in France.
But Harris isn’t content to stick to the classics; although he clearly
respects tradition, he isn’t afraid to experiment. A trademark dish is the
spicy boudin noir (blood sausage) with cornichons and a house-made mus-
tard sauce. Try the curious dessert goat cheese crème fraîche quenelles —
little rounds of goat cheese crème fraîche with poached pears and topped
with lavender honey. C’est magnifique!

Olivier’s suffered minimal damage from Katrina and reopened quickly. Chef
Armand Olivier hails from a family famous for its Creole cooking, and 
the menu is filled with dishes originated by ancestors going back to his
great-great-grandmother. The Creole Rabbit is a version of a popular 19th-
century Creole staple, braised and simmered in gravy to keep it moist and
served with a rich oyster dressing. The beef Bourguignon is also good,
with tenderloin tips simmered in a thick roux and served with pasta. I think
the bread pudding dessert is moist, creamy and an absolutely perfect way
to finish the meal. Service is highly professional and classy, and the decor
is the same without being too fancy.

dinner menu and seasonal specials, much less choose any one dish. I could
eat the signature crabmeat cheesecake, with its crunchy pecan crust, as an

succumb to the garlic-crusted softshell crab, which is flash fried and
served on jalapeño corn pudding with fried plantains, green tomato craw-
fish relish, and avocado lime coulis. In perfect Brennan tradition, Palace
Café offers a glorious dessert selection; the Ponchatoula strawberry short-

shrimp (a local favorite that originated here), which is actually marinated
in an irresistible, spicy butter sauce, not barbecued. (These plump crus-
taceans are served with their heads on, so be forewarned if you don’t like
them that way.) Among other dishes, the combination pan roast features
chopped oysters and crabmeat in a blend of shallots, parsley, and sea-
sonings. Even with reservations, you may find a bit of a wait.

Peristyle
$$
French Quarter
FRENCH/ITALIAN/NEW AMERICAN
When chef/owner Anne Kearney-Sand sold the restaurant to longtime
friend Tom Wolfe of Wolfe’s in neighboring suburb Metairie (since closed
due to Katrina), locals were aghast and feared the worst. Kearney-Sand
had owned the restaurant since 1995, and due to her talent and determi-
nation Peristyle flourished despite a devastating fire in 1999 that gutted
the place. She excelled at anything, from appetizers to enticing entrees to
surprise salads. New owner Wolfe did not have to deal with much Katrina
damage; however, he is still trying to figure out what the new Peristyle will
be. We continue to hope that he will persevere and make good on the 
old rep.

HAMBURGERS/SANDWICHES
This character-filled, nautical-themed restaurant and bar is famous for its
burgers, which locals generally agree are the best in town. They certainly
are huge, weighing in at a half-pound without condiments or the accom-
panying baked potato (sorry, no fries). Steaks are another specialty,
though I’ve found thickness and juiciness levels vary. The place really gets
jumping late at night when the restaurant is dark and crowded, and atten-
tive service is at a premium, but it’s busy most all the time. For extra
atmosphere, sit and eat at the bar. Take-out service is available.

CREOLE/SEAFOOD
Despite ongoing repairs to storm damage, the New Orleans branch of this
restaurant chain is usually crowded at all hours, though you seldom have
to wait longer than 15 to 20 minutes. The time passes quickly if you spend
it at the bar (a full-size replica of a fishing boat) downing drinks and 
raw oysters and people-watching. The onion rings alone are worth the
wait, though the hush puppies and fried crawfish tails also prove popular.
This restaurant is a solid, dependable (if not adventuresome) choice for
seafood; the portions are large, the prices reasonable, and the fixings fresh.
A kids’ menu offers burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches and a shrimp
boat.

CREOLE/SEAFOOD
This latest Brennan establishment opened in the former Tavern on the
Park building, but not before sprucing it up quite a bit. What a shame that
the lovely results of all that time and money was under water for a few
weeks thanks to Katrina. But in true dynasty fashion, Ralph’s not only

returned, but earned accolades as “Best Restaurant Post-Katrina,” by read-
ers of local CityBusiness magazine. I assumed the pre-Katrina view of City
Park’s magnificent live oaks was now spoiled, but miraculously, most live
oaks fared pretty well and the Spanish moss is still there, draped over
those enormous branches. While taking in the scenery, be sure to savor
my favorite dish, the grilled lamb T-bone, which is served with housemade
lamb crépinette, black lentils, roasted golden beets and finished with a nat-
ural lamb reduction and a red beet hummus. Please note that there is a
vegetarian-only menu available and it’s refreshingly untraditional.

Restaurant August

Central Business District
CONTEMPORARY FRENCH
Born on the bayou, executive chef John Besh — recently nominated for a
James Beard award — incorporates his southern Louisiana influences with
those found in the South of France, culminating in exciting, experimental
cuisine. He’s also celebrated for pitching in to feed relief workers and
clean-up crews in the weeks and months following Katrina. If available, you
might want to try the playful “BLT,” which is no diner staple but rather
buster crabs, lettuce, and tomatoes on pain perdu (French toast). Other
inspired entrees include Moroccan spice duck with sweet corn polenta,
duck foie gras and dried fruit compote, and pan roast day boat grouper
with lobster whipped potatoes and bouillabaisse jus. The dessert list is
most intriguing; I went for the goat’s milk cheesecake with bee pollen,
honey ice cream, and Balsamic sauternes syrup and was very satisfied
with my choice.

Rib Room

French Quarter
SEAFOOD/STEAKHOUSE
The arched windows, high ceilings, and exposed brick remind me of a con-
servative British men’s club, though acting genteel when tackling one of its
filets, sirloins, or other meats isn’t easy. The chef slow roasts the restau-
rant’s specialty, prime rib, on a rotisserie over an open flame. Spit-roasted
lamb, spit-roasted jumbo shrimp, and other satisfying dishes round out
the menu. The Rib Room is a good alternative for those individuals tired
of seafood or sauce-heavy Creole (though trading those rich creamy
sauces for juicy, artery-hardening steak isn’t much of a trade-off). There
was no storm damage.

Tujague’s
$$$
French Quarter
CREOLE
Opened in 1856, Tujague’s (pronounced two-jacks) is one of the oldest
restaurants in New Orleans and wasn’t going to let a few roof leaks keep it
from reopening in November 2005. It’s a favorite institution among New
Orleanians, but its simple, traditional charms aren’t for everyone. The
restaurant features no printed menu; instead, the waiters recite the lim-
ited but changing daily selections. Options frequently include the tender
beef brisket with horseradish sauce (very spicy), shrimp remoulade (with
a spicy mustard sauce), and a daily fish special. Ask for the Bonne Femme
chicken, a baked garlic number from the original owner’s recipe (the
restaurant has it every night, but you have to request it). Finish with the
classic bread pudding.

Upperline
$$
Uptown
ECLECTIC/CREOLE
Nestled in a largely residential section of Uptown that did not flood, JoAnn
Clevenger’s fabulous Upperline in a circa 1877 townhouse is every bit as
inventive as bigger names such as Commander’s Palace or Emeril’s with far
grander character. What other proprietor compiles lists of her favorite
local music clubs, bookstores, artists, and (gasp!) favorite dishes at other
restaurants, and shares them (by request) with patrons? No less extraor-
dinary is how she and her head chef, Kenneth Smith, met; they’re both vin-
tage menu and out-of-print cookbook buffs and Smith asked a dealer in
Michigan where he should find work. She suggested contacting Upperline,
Clevenger hired him as an apprentice, and thus, culinary history was
made. Speaking of which, Clevenger invented what is now a local staple,
fried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade — pay due homage and order
it. I highly recommend the “Taste of New Orleans,” a sampler of seven
favorites served in three courses. Note: Don’t come to Upperline if you’re
in a rush — you absolutely must make a night out of it. Savor the food and
atmosphere, ask Clevenger questions (start with an inquiry about her
enormous art collection displayed throughout the restaurant), and enjoy
her only-in-New Orleans stories.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Snacking is a great American pastime, and New Orleans is nothing if not
a city of traditions. Plus, with the stress of post-Katrina life for many
locals, it should come as no surprise that New Orleans is stuffed to the
gills with snack food — from Lucky Dogs (hot dogs and sausage sold by
street vendors in giant hot dog-shaped carts) to the city’s twin sandwich
staples, the po’ boy and the muffuletta. This section suggests the best
places to go for these delights as well as bar food, late-night munchies,
beignets, and other sugary confections. It also cracks open the subject
of oysters and gives you my two cents on the longstanding debate as to
the best burger in town.
Savoring the muffuletta experience
What is a muffuletta, you ask? See Chapter 3 to find out more about this
savory sandwich. Here are a couple of places to try one:
 Central Grocery (923 Decatur St., French Quarter, % 504-523-
1620) makes the most likely winner in the great muffuletta debate.
The place probably invented the muffuletta, so if you have just one,
have it here. You can also buy many New Orleans spices and other
deli items here as well. Many locals are stocking up because it was
tough to do without when it was temporarily closed after Katrina.
Tip: These things are so big you can easily split one.
 Napoleon House (500 Chartres St., French Quarter, % 504-524-
9752) is the sole seller of hot muffulettas. Some locals find the very
idea blasphemous, but others swear by it. This European-style cafe
also serves other sandwiches, soups, jambalaya, and similar, moder-
ately priced fare. Try the Pimm’s Cup, a sweet-and-sour mix of
lemonade, 7-Up, and Pimm’s No. 1 — it’s the bar’s signature drink.
The historic building — supposedly built for Napoleon (but
unlikely) — fared well during Katrina, however, the shortened hours
(only open until 6 p.m.) frustrate the usual late-night bar crowd.
Feasting on po’ boys
You can put just about anything — ham, shrimp, oysters, roast beef —
between two slices of French bread and you’ve made yourself a po’ boy.
See Chapter 3 to find out why these famously simple sandwiches are so
important to the local culture. Better yet, taste one by going to one (or
more!) of the following establishments:
 For the most popular po’ boy spot in the Quarter, head to Johnny’s
Po-boys (511 St. Louis St., % 504-524-8129). Family members are
pitching in due to lack of staff, so please go support their efforts!

 Mother’s (401 Poydras St., % 504-523-9656) serves a fine po’ boy
as does the Napoleon House (see the preceding section).
 In the Uptown area, Domilise’s (5240 Annunciation St., % 504-899-
9126) has been serving po’ boys, as well as other hot dishes, for
more than 75 years so they weren’t about to let a little storm
damage keep them closed for long. Try the “Peacemaker,” a half-
shrimp, half-oyster combination or a hot smoked sausage po’ boy,
dressed (see tip below), and with a bottle of Barq’s.
 If you’re tired of fried food, go for Guy’s (5259 Magazine St., 
% 504-891-5025) grilled shrimp po’ boy (which requires an ice-
cold root beer from the self-serve fridge).
When you order a po’ boy, you’ll be asked if you want it “dressed.” Only
say yes if you want lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise on your sandwich.
Hankering for a hamburger
In New Orleans, sports, politics, and current events are popular topics.
But those discussions are nothing compared to the amount of discourse
spent on who makes the best burger in town. Many places make excel-
lent burgers, but when you get right down it, this is a two-burger race
between the Port of Call (838 Esplanade Ave., % 504-523-0120) and the
Clover Grill (900 Bourbon St., % 504-598-1010). Both places make big
burgers; the Port of Call’s is a half-pound, while the Clover Grill’s weighs
in at a trim third of a pound. Both places keep their burgers juicy (the
Clover cooks its burgers under a hubcap, believe it or not, to seal in the
juices).
I used to heartily recommend Michael’s Mid-City Grill (4139 Canal St.) 
if you had something special to celebrate, but severe flooding has put 
it out of business for good. For a mere $150, you’d get a burger topped
with mushrooms, sour cream, and caviar — and a free bottle of Dom
Perignon. The staff also took your photo to document the occasion,
which was then tacked to the collage on the walls (you were far from the
only person who bought the $150 burger!). I hate to think of all of those
photos ruined by water and mold, all of those memories gone.
The world is your oyster
Katrina ruined many oyster beds by making brackish water a little too
salty, so oysters were in short supply for awhile. Hopefully, the oyster
population will return, given time. So if you get a chance to eat some, I
say go for it and definitely savor the experience. I prefer my oysters fried
and tucked inside a French bread, but some locals perfect the art of
oyster shooting — slurping a raw oyster, often dressed with ketchup and
horseradish, right out of its shell and letting it slide, virtually unchewed,
right down the gullet. Oyster shooting may sound unappetizing, but try it
once; it can sometimes be the right alternative to a heavy, sauce-laden
meal. The following oyster bars also offer fried oysters, shrimp for peel-
ing and dipping, and, when they’re in season, plenty of boiled crawfish:
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
178

 Acme Oyster House (724 Iberville St., % 504-522-5973; 7306
Lakeshore Drive) spent $2 million on storm-related repairs, so you
know they’re serious about oysters. Get ’em raw, fried, or in over-
stuffed po’ boys. The Lakeshore location was devastated by flood-
waters, and I doubt it will return.
 Casamento’s (4330 Magazine St., % 504-895-9761) is mourning the
untimely loss of 80-year-old Joe Casamento, whose father founded
the restaurant. He lived above the restaurant, never took a vaca-
tion, and it was believed that in nearly 40 years, he had never eaten
anywhere else except the time he evacuated for a hurricane years
ago and ate at a pancake house. He died the night he evacuated for
Hurricane Katrina, possibly from heartbreak over the possible loss
of his beloved restaurant and city. Please eat some oysters here in
his honor. They are so incredibly good that Casamento’s can afford
to close for the summer (when oysters aren’t at their peak), and
locals are back in full force come fall. The homemade gumbo and
oyster loaf are always worth the wait.
 Felix’s Restaurant and Oyster Bar (739 Iberville St., % 504-522-
4440) should be open by the time you read this. Feel free to eye the
tempting Creole dishes, but keep in mind that they specialize in
oysters and fried seafood.
Restaurant rescue for vegetarians
If you’re a vegetarian traveler, your options in New Orleans are limited. If
you can cook a food in animal fat, New Orleanians do. Ham and sausage
even lurk in the red beans and rice. Nevertheless, a few places in town
cater to the vegetarian market (though none of them are exclusively veg-
etarian), and do a decent job of it, too.
 Lebanon’s Café (1500 S. Carrollton Ave., Carrollton, % 504-862-
6200) is extremely popular with the health- and money-conscious
crowd, especially students and parents with little ones. When I
need a veggie infusion, I order the sautéed vegetables topped with
lightly browned goat cheese over basmati rice. The prices have
increased since Katrina, but I think the food is well worth it.
 Mona’s (3901 Banks St., Mid-City, % 504-482-7743; 4126 Magazine
St., Uptown, % 504-894-9800; 3149 Calhoun St., Uptown, % 504-
861-2124) is an unpretentious spot where people from all walks of
life converge for Middle Eastern fare such as gyros, falafel, and the
baba ganuj eggplant dip, with much to satisfy vegetarians with
international palates. The Mid-City location flooded so be patient if
there are still repairs going on during your visit.
 Ralph’s on the Park (900 City Park Ave., Mid-City, % 504-488-1000)
has fully recovered from flood damage and offers a special vegetar-
ian menu if you ask for it.

French Quarter Snacks
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
180

 Slim Goodie’s Diner (3322 Magazine St., Uptown, % 504-891-3447)
is a classic diner (check out the red booths) that also happens to
serve vegetarian fare. The menu, funky decor, and music (‘70s
Springsteen when I last went) make it a fun place to eat. It was one
of if not the first restaurant to reopen in that neighborhood, within
mere days of Katrina, by offering a very limited menu (fried eggs,
anyone?) served on plasticware. Locals hungry for social interac-
tion found great comfort here when they were starving for anything
approximating normalcy.
 Whole Foods Market (3135 Esplanade Ave., Mid-City; 5600
Magazine St., Uptown, % 504-899-9119), a local favorite for organic
produce and vegetarian specialties, offers all items to go. In a pre-
scient move, the quaint, smaller Mid-City location had closed prior
to Katrina in favor of a sprawling big box location in the nearby
suburb of Metairie.
Aside from these places, call ahead and ask if a particular restaurant
that interests you features vegetarian entrees; a good number of them
do. (Central Grocery, for example, offers a mean vegetable muffuletta.)
Lucky dogs: Street fare
A tradition in New Orleans since 1948, Lucky Dog carts became famous
when spoofed in the Pulitzer Prize–winning book A Confederacy of
Dunces. Missing in action for six months after Katrina, the carts that sell
Lucky Dogs are once again on street corners throughout the French
Quarter and Central Business District. (The carts spread out to other
locations throughout the city during special events.) Spotting the carts
is easy because they look like giant hot dogs.
Lucky Dogs are the perfect food for late-night revelers with a blood-
alcohol volume of .05 percent or higher, and the carts are conveniently
located throughout the Quarter to accommodate those who stumble out
of nearby bars. A regular or foot-long hot dog or sausage dressed with
the works (including chili) goes for less than $5.
A slice of pie
If you’re in the mood for a familiar pepperoni pizza, or perhaps some-
thing a bit more gourmet, stop by one of these places:
 Mama Rosa’s Slice of Italy (616 N. Rampart St., French Quarter, 
% 504-523-5546).
 Reginelli’s (741 State St., Uptown, % 504-899-1414).
Neighborhood watch
For me, nothing quite tops people-watching at a diner or neighborhood
joint, observing the ebb and flow of regular Janes and Joes in the tidal
Chapter 11: Dining and Snacking in New Orleans 181

pool of the working world. The everyday give-and-take of greasy-spoon
waitresses interacting with accountants, mechanics, and eccentrics is as
fascinating to me as watching native tribal rituals is to an anthropolo-
gist. What follows, then, is a short and highly subjective list of neighbor-
hood spots with just as much emphasis on character and atmosphere as
on good food:
 Betsy’s Pancake House (2542 Canal St., Mid-City, % 504-822-0213)
did indeed flood but this popular breakfast and lunch spot is open
again and busy as ever. The waitresses will either annoy or amuse
you; I find them to be fun.
 Bywater Bar-B-Que (3162 Dauphine St., Bywater, % 504-944-4445)
stayed high and dry and is the perfect place to harden your arter-
ies with some prime barbecue. It also serves a decent burger and
great pizza.
 Franky and Johnny’s (321 Arabella St., Uptown, % 504-899-9146)
specializes in boiled seafood, but just about any of the sandwiches
are rewarding. I love to play Ms. Pac-Man while waiting for my meal.
They sustained little Katrina damage.
 Liuzza’s on Bienville (3636 Bienville St., Mid-City, % 504-482-9120)
may be the mother of all neighborhood restaurants, especially after
rising up again against all odds. Cool off with a giant frozen mug of
beer and indulge in the popular “Frenchuletta,” a muffuletta on
French bread.
 Mandina’s (3800 Canal St., Mid-City, % 504-482-9179) suffered
severe flooding but a sign claims, “We WILL return!” so here’s
hoping repairs and renovations continue to move along. This local
legend aspires to some odd cross between stuffy upper-crust estab-
lishment and regular-Joe hangout. The sandwiches are good, but
the real draws are daily specials such as red beans and rice or beef
stew, as well as Italian and seafood dishes. Prepare for snobby wait-
ers who can sniff out native New Orleanians from people who
moved here from somewhere else; tourists don’t stand a chance.
After-hours appetite
Clover Grill is one of the best places in town at which to eat in the
predawn hours. Also in the French Quarter, Poppy’s Grill and Café du
Monde (800 Decatur St. at Jackson Square, % 504-525-4544) are a
couple of other reliable 24-hour snacking destinations. I’ll never forget
the first time I drove through the French Quarter after Katrina and found
Café du Monde closed. It was just like a worst nightmare come true!
Thank goodness they’re back. But please don’t feel like you must limit
your options to them, nor to the French Quarter. You can find some late-
night nourishment wherever you happen to be in New Orleans.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
182

 Clover Grill (900 Bourbon St., French Quarter, % 504-598-1010) is
a fun diner known for its juicy burgers (cooked under a hubcap to
seal in the flavors), but it’s now only open 24 hours on weekends.
Bummer! Breakfast is served around the clock in a cheeky, whimsi-
cal atmosphere. This gay-friendly hangout also offers good shakes,
malts, a painfully sweet icebox pie, and lots of coffee.
 Igor’s Bar and Grill (2133 St. Charles Ave., Garden District, % 504-
522-2145) offers 24-hour food, including the “world-famous” Igor
burger, a good jukebox, and plenty of local atmosphere (and, again,
self-serve laundry). It’s also a good place to shoot pool.
 The down-home snacks and meals at La Peniche (1940 Dauphine
St., Faubourg Marigny, % 504-943-1460) can really hit the spot.
This gay-friendly spot has great half-pound hamburgers and home-
made desserts; if the Oreo pie doesn’t cause you to moan in
ecstasy, call a mortician, because you must be dead. It used to be
open 24 hours but now closes at 8 p.m.
 Poppy’s Grill (717 St. Peter St., French Quarter, % 504-524-3287) is
owned by the same folks who run Clover Grill, so the same light-
hearted attitude prevails (“dancing in the aisles only”). It serves
the same fabulous shakes, burgers, and other diner fare. That’s not
to say that Poppy’s doesn’t have its own unique qualities. Check
out the scratch ’n’ sniff menu or go for the blue plate special.
 St. Charles Tavern (1433 St. Charles Ave., Lower Garden District,
% 504-523-9823) is also open 24 hours. The fare ranges from burg-
ers to red beans and rice to Creole omelettes (stuffed with shrimp
Creole). Don’t be surprised if you find a short wait for a table even
after 2 a.m.
Sipping a cup of joe
Since the 18th century, when European traders realized New Orleans
was the logical importer of coffee from the Caribbean and South
America, the Crescent City and coffee have remained inseparable. The
devastation of Katrina demonstrated just how important New Orleans is
as a port city to the rest of the nation. These are my favorite places to
wake up in the morning:
 Open 24 hours, the original Café du Monde (800 Decatur St.,
French Quarter, % 504-528-9933) makes a legendary café au lait —
strong New Orleans coffee flavored with chicory to make it less
bitter and mixed with an equal portion of scalded milk. This prime
place for people-watching has been around since 1862 and closed
briefly after Katrina. (A handful of Café du Monde satellites are
scattered around the city and suburbs.)

Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
184

 Café Fleur de Lis (307 Chartres St., French Quarter, % 504-529-
9641) offers salads, light sandwiches and even a fruit bowl along
with great coffee. It’s probably the closest you’ll find to a health
store in New Orleans.
 City Perk (637 N. Carrollton Ave., Mid-City, % 504-482-4847) was
flooded badly and the owners have worked hard to repair and reno-
vate it. It’s an easy streetcar ride away thanks to the Canal line.
This independent coffeehouse features friendly staff, consistently
great drinks, vegan pastries, and yummy panini sandwiches. Grab a
seat on the front patio or walk to nearby City Park (about six
blocks) for an impromptu picnic. Dogs are welcome on the patio.
 EnVie (1241 Decatur St., French Quarter, % 504-524-3689) was the
first coffeehouse to reopen in the city post-Katrina. Its European
style in both look and food (cheese boards!) complements the
Crescent City. Breakfast is available until 2 p.m.
 Fair Grinds Coffee House (333 Ponce de Leon St., Mid-City, % 504-
948-3222) suffered severe flooding and is technically closed. But it
now offers free coffee and Wi-Fi to area residents who rely on it as a
meeting place as they work together to rebuild their community.
 Rue de la Course (1500 Magazine St., Lower Garden District; 3128
Magazine St., Uptown, % 504-899-0242; 1140 S. Carrollton Ave.,
Carrollton, % 504-861-4343) is modeled after 17th-century
European coffeehouses, with cool, friendly college kids and locals
hanging out and lingering over the morning paper. Chocolate
Chapter 11: Dining and Snacking in New Orleans 185
Quick-stop java shops
The presence of two ubiquitous local coffee institutions in New Orleans is akin to that
of Starbucks in the rest of the country (New Orleans has those too, by the way). CC’s
Gourmet Coffee House and PJ’s Coffee & Tea Co. both have multiple locations through-
out the metropolitan area. Of the two, I’m partial to homegrown PJ’s with its funkier
atmosphere.
Some of the more centrally located CC’s locations include the following:
 2917 Magazine St., Garden District (% 504-891-2115)
 941 Royal St., French Quarter(% 504-581-6996)
Some of the more popular PJ’s locations are the following:
 7624 Maple St., Uptown (% 504-866-7031)
 644 Camp St., Warehouse District (% 504-529-3658)

lovers, order the iced cioccolato, which is an improvement on the
standard iced mocha. A handful of these exist in the metropolitan
area. I always thought that with its pressed-tin ceiling and odd mix
of folks, the original location at 1500 Magazine was best, but that
location has since been replaced by another coffee shop.
Beignets: Sweet treats
Beignets (pronounced ben-yays) are basically fried doughnuts gener-
ously covered with lots of powdered sugar. Novices may be tempted to
shake off some of the sugar. Don’t mess with it; the sugar tastes great,
especially after the heat of the freshly baked beignet melts it. If anything,
you end up adding more powdered sugar, courtesy of sugar shakers on
the table. Café du Monde (800 Decatur St., % 504-528-9933) is Beignet
Central. They’re a steal at three for about $1, and because the place is
open 24 hours (every day but Christmas), you can satisfy your craving
at any time. Other non-24-hour Café du Mondes are at the Riverwalk
Shopping Center (1 Poydras St., % 504-587-0841) and the New Orleans
Centre shopping center (1400 Poydras St., % 504-587-0842).
La patisserie
If you want to pretend that you’re grabbing a snack back in French
Colonial days, drop by one of these patisseries. Although they all offer
seating, you may want to take your pastry to nearby Jackson Square to
people-watch.
 Croissant D’Or (617 Ursulines St., % 504-524-4663) is going strong
and provides daily fresh-baked pastries for its sister location, La
Marquise, as well, though this location has cheaper prices for the
same delectable items. Ask the staff for the history behind the old
“Ladies’ Entrance” sign on the sidewalk. Opt for a seat beside the
decrepit fountain in the outdoor courtyard and give the little spar-
rows a crumb or two.
 La Boulangerie (3143 Ponce de Leon St., % 504-940-0577; 4526
Magazine St., % 504-269-3777) offerings vary by location. The orig-
inal spot on Magazine is a full bakery that is worth walking into for
the smell alone. The Mid-City location is closed due to flooding and
will be replaced by a wine store, Sip.
 La Madeleine (547 St. Ann St. % 504-568-0073) was temporarily
closed post-Katrina because of lack of staff, but should be open by
the time you read this. Seek out its delectable French pastries and
other light menu items. It also maintains locations in the Garden
District and in the Riverbend.
 The lush courtyard at La Marquise (625 Chartres St., % 504-524-
0420) makes a great place to take a leisurely breakfast or an after-
noon break. Croissant D’Or’s sister shop offers all sorts of delicious
pastries, soups, salads, and sandwiches. Serving hours are limited
for now.
Part III: Settling into New Orleans 
186

For your sweet tooth
The one word you need to know when discussing homegrown New
Orleans–style sugary snacks is pralines (pronounced praw-leens, not
pray-leens). Give these tasty confections (made with brown sugar and
pecans) a try and you may become addicted. Aunt Sally’s Pralines
(810 Decatur St., % 800-642-7257 or 504-944-6090) off-site warehouse
and kitchen were flooded by Katrina, but the retail shop is up and run-
ning again. At Southern Candymakers (334 Decatur St., % 800-344-9773
or 504-523-5544), you can watch the staff making the famous local candy.
Laura’s Candies (331 Chartres St., % 800-992-9699 or 504-525-3880),
open since 1913, offers pralines, fudge, and golf-ball-size truffles. Evans
Creole Candy Factory (848 Decatur St., % 504-522-7111), started in
1900, so you know they have perfected their praline recipe. Some people
cast their vote for best praline to Leah’s Candy Kitchen (714 St. Louis
St., % 504-523-5662), which is slowly getting back on its feet.
Screaming for ice cream
You can find ice-cream carts throughout the French Quarter, especially
around Jackson Square. Or try Häagen-Dazs Ice Cream Parlors at 621 St.
Peter St. (% 504-523-4001), the Riverwalk Shopping Center, and 1
Poydras St. (% 504-523-3566). Unfortunately, the Riverbend location
(8108 Hampson St.) is permanently closed, as are both Ben & Jerry’s on
Jackson Square and in badly flooded City Park.
For a really special treat, head to The Creole Creamery (4924 Prytania
St., % 504-894-8680) for unusual gourmet flavors like bananas Foster
and lemon garlic. Or take the Canal Streetcar to an old favorite, Angelo
Brocato’s (214 N. Carrollton Ave., % 504-486-0078), which suffered
great losses from flooding but worked hard to rebuild and is now open.
Its creamy and rich gelato will make you an instant fan of Italian ice
cream. If you’re in the Lower Garden District, stop by Sophie’s Ice
Cream Parlor (1912 Magazine St., % 504-561-0291), which specializes in
seasonal homemade gelato and the “reverse” root beer float.
Technically, it’s not ice cream, but if you’re here during the summer, cool
off with a New Orleans tradition: the sno ball. It’s finely shaved ice
dowsed in one or more flavored syrups. Locals also like to top their sno
ball with condensed cream or whipped cream. You’ll find sno ball stands
throughout the city, but you absolutely must go to Hansen’s Sno Bliz
(4801 Tchoupitoulas St.; % 504-891-9788). Founders Ernest and Mary
Hansen started the business during the Depression and both died soon
after Hurricane Katrina. Their granddaughter, Ashley Hansen, has taken
over. Plum Street Sno Balls (1300 Plum St., % 504-866-7996) has an
amazing orchid-flavored sno ball that you just have to try to understand.
(Note: Sno balls are seasonal, so only look for them Apr–Sept.)

Part IV
Exploring 
New Orleans

In this part . . . 
You have at least one foolproof way to work off all the
food you’ll consume in New Orleans — sightseeing!
Chapter 12 covers the absolute must-see attractions, followed
by a comprehensive list of other worthwhile places and infor-
mation on guided tours.
Chapter 13 familiarizes you with the city’s diverse shopping
areas, whether you want to browse the familiar brand-name
department stores or comb through funky boutiques.
Chapter 14 suggests some great itineraries to help budget
your time, and Chapter 15 throws in a couple of daytrips you
may enjoy.

Chapter 12
Discovering New Orleans’s
Best Attractions
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the top attractions in town
 Assessing attractions post-Katrina
 Introducing additional sights by location and type
 Taking a guided tour
 Seeing the devastated areas
T
hanks to great food and music, New Orleans has an embarrassment
of cultural riches, even after Katrina. However, the thing about New
Orleans that charms many people — and what we worry about losing as
the city rebuilds — is its unique sense of character and identity. This
chapter presents a selective, alphabetical list of the top places where
you can soak up the best of the Crescent City, while also having a good
time and maybe discovering something new along the way.
Assessing Katrina’s Damage 
to City Attractions
Those attractions in severely flooded areas such as Mid-City and New
Orleans East did not fare well for the most part and I strongly doubt they
will return. For those in better shape, you might find that admission
prices are lower but hours of operation are shorter due to a smaller pool
of staff and/or anticipation of fewer visitors (for at least the first couple
years after Katrina). Please keep in mind that prices will eventually
increase, so now is the time when your tourist dollar will stretch a little
further. A few places, such as the Audubon Zoo, slightly increased their
admission prices, which is not much considering their losses that
could’ve been passed on to you. Many businesses are making a con-
certed effort to keep prices reasonably low to encourage tourists to
return, so again, this is to your advantage.

One of the most dramatic photos I saw in the weeks following Katrina
was the image of a huge Six Flags roller coaster jutting out from what
appeared to be a lake. This 140-acre theme park opened in 2000 as
Jazzland Theme Park and was purchased by Six Flags soon thereafter.
The amusement park was destroyed by storm surge and Category 3-plus
winds. It is permanently closed.
New Orleans’s Top Sights
No matter how you want to spend your time, New Orleans offers a multi-
tude of choices. Read the following to get an idea.
Aquarium of the Americas
French Quarter
Before Katrina, this stylish, entertaining, and winningly educational 
aquarium — one of the top ten in the United States — featured breath-
taking exhibits made you feel as if you were walking under water or explor-
ing a tropical rain forest. In 2002, there was a public uproar when 10
aquarium visitors on a behind-the-scenes-tour fell into the 20-foot-deep,
400,000-gallon shark tank when the catwalk collapsed. Within 15 minutes,
everyone was rescued and thankfully unharmed. The aquarium assured
the public that safety was of the utmost concern and people continued
coming to this popular destination. When Katrina came, all of the fish and
animals survived the storm itself, however, as days passed without power
and emergency generators began to give out, there was nothing the dedi-
cated staff could do. They were then forced to evacuate for their own
safety and upon their return four days later, most of the aquarium’s 10,000
fish had died. Previous visitors will be happy to know that 250-pound sea
turtle Midas, comic otter duo Buck and Emma, white alligator Spots and
the African black-footed and Rockhopper penguins all survived. After eight
months of renovations, the aquarium opened again, featuring many new
fish and animals, some of which were donated by other institutions. The
aquarium features an interactive, hands-on activity area for kids, along
with popular exhibits of penguins (fed daily at 10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.), sea
horses, sharks and sting rays. Aquarium volunteers in blue or green shirts
can answer your questions and steer you in the right direction if you’re
lost. Give yourself 11⁄2 to 2 hours to see the aquarium.

New Orleans Attractions
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 199

Transformed into a public park and dedicated to jazz legend Louis
Armstrong, the park offers visitors stately sycamores, peaceful lagoons,
and rolling grassy knolls. You can also find the Municipal Auditorium and
the Mahalia Jackson Theater for the Performing Arts (see Chapter 16). As
we go to print, Perseverance Hall, the Reimann House, and the Rabassa
House are being restored and will be used as part of the much-anticipated
New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park, which should open in spring
2007. During Mardi Gras, the all-canine Krewe of Barkus and its two- and
four-legged fans gather here prior to the parade. Other park events can be
more solemn; on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, hundreds
marched from the site of the Lower Ninth Ward levee break to the park in
remembrance. The park entrance is just outside the Quarter in the
Faubourg Tremé neighborhood at St. Ann and Rampart streets. The area is
safe during the day, but I don’t recommend venturing there at night unless
you go as part of a large group or during an event. Give yourself 30 to 60
minutes to visit the park.
See map p. 204. On N. Rampart Street, between Toulouse and St. Phillip streets,
facing the French Quarter. Open: seasonal hours. Admission: free. Wheelchair 
accessible.
Audubon Park
Uptown
This 340-acre public park is one of the most beautiful and tranquil spots
in the city and named after John James Audubon, who briefly lived here.
After Katrina, some of the young live oak trees and those weak from ter-
mite damage fell or had to be removed, but other than that, the park fared
pretty well. It even survived serving as a temporary campground for the
National Guard in the weeks following the storm. Now once again a refuge
for nature lovers, it’s also a busy social thoroughfare; bicyclists, joggers,
dog walkers, and horseback riders (Cascade Stables closed prior to
Katrina for a complete renovation which has now been put on hold indef-
initely) come to enjoy the atmosphere and the scenery. Tucked into this

A New Orleans IMAX experience
Next door to the Aquarium of the Americas is the IMAX Theatre (% 800-774-7394 or
504-581-4629), with large-screen 3-D documentaries (past shows have featured every-
thing from dinosaurs to the Rolling Stones) that are sure to delight the kids. It sustained
minor equipment damage and roof damage after Katrina but was able to reopen by
May 2006. You can purchase tickets separately for $8 for adults and $5 for children
2–12 years old ($7 for seniors 65 and up), or save a couple of bucks with the aquar-
ium/IMAX combination admission. Shows run hourly from 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last show
starts at 5 p.m.). Wheelchair accessible theater.

sprawling expanse of land are tennis courts, riding and jogging paths, a
public golf course, resident populations of squirrels and birds (keep an
eye out for wood ducks, swans and egrets), and hundreds of gorgeous cen-
turies-old live oaks. If you cross Magazine Street, you’ll find Audubon Zoo
(see details below) and beyond that, a park along the Mississippi River.
Come here to have a picnic, exercise, or just relax by the fountain at the
St. Charles Avenue entrance — but don’t stay after dark. Allow 30 to 60
minutes for an appreciative stroll.
See map p. 199. 6500 St. Charles Ave. (across from Tulane and Loyola universities,
nestled between St. Charles Avenue and Magazine Street). Take the St. Charles
Streetcar (or bus) and get off in front of the park. % 504-581-4629. Open: Daily 
6 a.m.–10 p.m. Admission: free. Wheelchair accessible.
Audubon Zoo
Uptown
Thanks to excellent hurricane preparation, all but three of the zoo’s 1,800
animals, including some rare and endangered species, survived Katrina
and live in this sprawling maze of lagoons, waterfalls, and vegetation.
During the storm, staff members took refuge in the art nouveau-styled rep-
tile building. Days later, their biggest challenges were food shortages and
overheated pumps but they never gave up. At one point, relief workers
were invited to visit for free, which was a very kind invitation on the part
of the staff. Situated inside Audubon Park on the bank of the Mississippi
River, the zoo features an array of exhibits, including a replica of a
Louisiana swamp and the Dragon’s Lair exhibit featuring spectacular 6- to
9-foot-long Komodo dragons, weighing on average 200 pounds, from
Indonesia. The zoo boasts a white alligator, two white Bengal tigers named
Rex and Zulu, and a host of other exotic animals. The Jaguar Jungle exhibit
is a stunning acre-and-a-half replica of an ancient Mayan city filled with
spider monkeys, macaws, iguanas, and other creatures; low-lying fog adds
an air of mystery. Monkey Hill was artificially constructed by the Works
Progress Administration in the 1930s, supposedly to demonstrate what a
hill looked like to local kids since New Orleans is famously flat. The circa
1928 sea lion–pool, featuring neo-classical columns and allowing visitors
to walk down one story and peer through windows at the sea lions swim-
ming by, is still closed for renovations. Give yourself two to four hours to
thoroughly enjoy the zoo.
See map p. 199. 6500 Magazine St. % 800-774-7394 or 504-581-4629. www.audubon
institute.org. Once it’s running again, take the St. Charles Streetcar (or bus)
and get off at the park entrance. A free shuttle through the park runs every 20 min-
utes. If you prefer, take the Magazine Street bus and get off at the zoo. Admission:
$12 adults, $9 seniors (older than 65), and $7 children 2–12. Parking: free. Wheelchair
accessible. Open: Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; open till 5 p.m. weekends in the summer.
Last ticket sold one hour before closing. Closed Mardi Gras day, the first Friday in
May, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 201

Bourbon Street
French Quarter
As you walk along Bourbon Street, between the 100 and 1,000 blocks, you
may feel like you’ve just crashed the world’s largest ongoing, open-air fra-
ternity party. This is New Orleans Party Central, for better or for worse,
and at night it’s definitely not a kids’ attraction — unless you’re a kid
between the ages of 21 and 100. Bourbon Street is an odd mix of the authen-
tic and the contrived, with its carnival-style barkers trying to lure you into
strip clubs, its buggy drivers ferrying tourists, and its requisite street per-
formers and scam artists competing for your attention (and your money).
Most, if not all, bars on Bourbon Street (which is blocked off for pedestri-
ans only) stay open until the wee, wee hours — some well into the morn-
ing. You can even take an alcoholic drink with you for a stroll — as long as
you carry it in a plastic “go-cup.” During the daylight hours, Bourbon Street
becomes more relaxed and can almost look deserted. Only restaurants, T-
shirt and souvenir shops, and a few bars stay open during the day.
Depending on the ages of your children and your definition of family values,
you may want your kids to see Bourbon Street only in daylight — or not at
all. With the kids during the day, allow about an hour for a visit. If you’re a
bigger kid looking to cut loose at night, well, take your time.
Cabildo
French Quarter
The Cabildo, where the French government turned over the Louisiana
Purchase to the United States in 1803, was built in 1795 as the Spanish seat
of government. A fire in 1988 caused horrible damage to the historic build-
ing and it required five years of restoration to make it whole again. The
Louisiana State Museum considers it “headquarters” for all of its French
Quarter interests, and if you can’t see every state museum, be sure to
make time for at least this one. It sustained very minor damage to windows
and shutters during Katrina. Worthwhile exhibits cover all aspects of life
in early Louisiana, including antebellum music, mourning and burial cus-
toms, and the changing roles of women in the South. Each room seems
more interesting than the one before. Allow at least an hour for your visit.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
202
Cruising from A(quarium) to Z(oo)
The popular ferry boat rides were discontinued after Katrina but should return in 2007.
You can purchase a combination ticket for admission to both the Aquarium of the
Americas and the Audubon Zoo, with a riverboat ride on the sternwheeler John James
Audubon taking you between the two. Combination admissions for all three (cruise,
aquarium, and zoo) will be available, with other combination admissions offered. Trips
depart from the Riverwalk (in front of the aquarium) and from the zoo. (Call % 800-
774-7394 or 504-581-4629 for more information or to confirm schedule.)

See map p. 204. 701 Chartres St. (at St. Ann Street on Jackson Square; 2 blocks from
Bourbon Street). % 800-568-6968 or 504-568-6968. http://lsm.crt.state.la.
us/site/cabex.htm. Admission: $5 adults, $4 students and seniors, free for chil-
dren under 13. Wheelchair accessible, though the elevator is small. Open: Tues–Sun
9 a.m.–5 p.m.
City Park
Mid-City
The Canal Streetcar takes you directly to City Park, which suffered greatly
in the weeks after Katrina. At 1,500 acres, it’s the fifth largest urban park
in the United States and shelters the largest collection of mature live oaks
in the world. Many of these beautiful trees — which have lived for hun-
dreds of years — could not survive being under three- to eight-feet of
brackish water for two weeks. Once the floodwaters receded, all of the
grass, flowers, and bushes had died and brown muck covered everything.
For years prior to Katrina, the trees and landscape did not receive the
maintenance and care that it required due to lack of funds and staff
because the park has never received money from the City of New Orleans
or the state of Louisiana. However, the summer before Katrina, the park
appeared to turn a corner with a master plan to increase revenue, revital-
ize underutilized sections of the park, and create more recreational oppor-
tunities, such as a skate park and dog agility center. Sadly, Katrina dashed
that plan and the park was in worse shape than before. However, financial
support from around the world has helped the cleanup and the flora and
fauna are returning stronger than ever. Give yourself at least an hour to
explore the park, two to three if you have children or want to linger at two
or more of the spots listed here. (Much longer, of course, if you’re going to
play 18 holes of golf.) If you plan to visit the New Orleans Museum of Art
(% 504-488-2631; see listing later in this chapter), which is located on the
park grounds, allow another hour to an hour and a half. For additional
details on the following activities inside the park, go to the City Park Web
site at www.neworleanscitypark.com.
The Carousel Gardens (% 504-482-4888) in City Park house is currently
closed. It boasts one of the country’s few remaining carved wooden
carousels, which survived Katrina but requires some repair. Two minia-
ture trains take riders on a 21⁄2-mile trip through the park. Also check out
the small Ferris wheel and wading pool. The Botanical Gardens (% 504-
483-9386) was destroyed by floodwaters but amazing volunteers replanted
everything, allowing it to reopen in March 2006. Though not as lush as
before, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much growth there has been
already. Explore 12 acres of gardens, fountains, ponds, and sculptures, plus
a horticultural library and a gift shop. Open Tuesday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., admission is free for the time being though donations
of any amount are very welcome. Offering 26 larger-than-life storybook-
themed play areas. Storyland (% 504-483-9381) is great for children. Child

magazine once rated it one of the 10 best in the country. Admission is $2,
free for kids under 2. Other features of the park include the following:
 Four 18-hole public golf courses with lessons by PGA pros, electric
carts, rentals, pro shop, and restaurant (% 504-483-9397), are
closed due to Katrina damage, however, the 100-tee driving range
(% 504-483-9394) is now open.
 Thirty-six tennis courts (% 504-483-9383) are repaired and ready
for play.
 Fishing (% 504-483-9371) in the park’s lagoons for bass, catfish,
and perch. Permits are required and may be purchased on site —
call or visit the city park Web site for details.
 Horseback rides, lessons, and pony rides (% 504-483-9398).
See map p. 212. 1 Palm Drive. City Park is located all the way up Esplanade Avenue
out of the French Quarter. % 504-482-4888. www.neworleanscitypark.com.
Take the Esplanade bus from the French Quarter and get off at the park. Open: sun-
rise til sunset. Parking: free. Wheelchair accessible.
French Market
French Quarter
In the days after we evacuated and hearing news reports that the city was
underwater, I was so worried that the French Quarter was completely
destroyed, for without it, there simply is no New Orleans. The Quarter is
its epicenter. This nexus of local trade, located on high ground right next
to the river (from St. Phillip Street to the edge of the Quarter at Esplanade
Avenue), did not flood and has been a fixture since the early 1700s. Its
shops, flea market, and farmer’s market are still neat places to shop for
souvenirs, gifts, T-shirts, jewelry, arts and crafts, and fresh produce. Finish
your shopping spree by indulging in some beignets at Café du Monde,
located right along the market. Give yourself at least 30 to 60 minutes to
wander the market.
See map p. 204. The French Market stretches along Decatur and N. Peters streets
from St. Ann to Barracks. Admission: free. Wheelchair accessible. Open: most shops
from 10 a.m.–6 p.m. daily. The Farmer’s Market and Café du Monde are open 24 hours.
Jackson Square
French Quarter
President Bush stood here and publicly proclaimed that New Orleans would
rebuild. Locals are determined to make good on his promise. Historically,
Jackson Square served New Orleans as the place of execution, military
parade ground, and town square. Today, the beautiful landscaping, trees,
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 205

benches, and a tranquil fountain make this square one of the more popular
public places in the city. Katrina did knock down two massive oak trees,
which miraculously fell beside a marble statue of Jesus Christ — just snap-
ping off the thumb and forefinger of an outstretched hand — located across
from the 280-year-old St. Louis Cathedral. Along the ornate black-iron fence,
artists set up shop on the sidewalk while mules stand along Decatur Street,
patiently waiting to take tourists for a trip around the Quarter. Consult a
tarot card reader or a psychic while watching clowns, street musicians,
“living statues,” and mimes vie for your tips. You can grab some ice cream,
a soft drink, or another snack from a street vendor, or head for one of the
restaurants located on each corner of the square. Allot 30 to 60 minutes to
look around — considerably more if you decide to run away and join the
street mimes.
See map p. 204. The square fronts the 700 block of Decatur Street and is bounded by
Chartres, St. Ann, and St. Peter streets. www.jackson-square.com. Admission:
free. Open: seasonal hours, but usually from dawn to dusk.
Louisiana Children’s Museum
Warehouse District
This spacious, two-story interactive museum is really a playground in dis-
guise. The hands-on exhibits open up the worlds of science and nature and
role playing. Kids can be chefs, tugboat captains, or even TV anchors in a
simulated television studio. Activities and exhibits include everything from
a pint-sized grocery store to a “challenges” exhibit where they shoot hoops
from a wheelchair and a math and physics lab. Allow 90 minutes to 2
hours. There was minimal storm damage.

Louisiana Nature Center and Planetarium
New Orleans East
The Nature Center was nestled in Joe Brown Park, an 85-acre stretch of
Louisiana forest that was crushed by storm surge from the Gulf and Lake
Pontchartrain. According to the Audubon Institute, which also manages
the aquarium and zoo, the nature center will remain closed until further
notice.

Central Business District/Warehouse District Attractions
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 207

New Orleans’s most popular attraction. You could write volumes about its
rich and colorful history (and many people have; see Chapter 3). Revelers
flock to the city from all over the United States — and the world — while
some locals, who don’t feel like fighting the crowds, hightail it out of town
for the final few days. If you like crowds, you’ll love joining the raucous
street party in the French Quarter, especially on Bourbon Street between
the 500 block and 1000 block. For these who prefer a little elbow room, I
suggest you head as far Uptown as possible (think Napoleon Avenue). The
2006 Carnival season, while on a smaller scale than usual, gave locals a
reason to smile and tourists extra incentive to visit and see the city at its
spirited best.
For a family-friendly Mardi Gras experience, check out the parades in other
parts of the city, most notably the parade route along St. Charles Avenue
uptown. Also, the suburbs are increasingly becoming a haven for families.
Although it’s a bit of a drive, you can find a much more G-rated experience
(okay, maybe PG-13) if you decamp along one of the major suburban
parade routes. Veterans Memorial Boulevard in Metairie (on the East
Bank of Jefferson Parish) or the Westbank Expressway (one of the main
thoroughfares across the river, on the West Bank of Jefferson Parish) make

Mardi Gras Indians
Groups (or “tribes”) of African American men who dress in elaborate Native American
costumes are called “Mardi Gras Indians.” Their elaborate, beaded suits (they 
prefer to say “suits,” not “costumes”) are their pride and joy, and they put serious
work into them, usually taking a whole year to put one together. Feathers, sequins,
headdresses — the costumes are spectacular. In the weeks after Katrina, as tribe
members were allowed to return to their water-logged, moldy homes, some nailed
their ruined costumes to the front of their houses, which was quite ghostly to behold.
Some people say that the tradition originally developed as a way of showing thanks
to Native Americans who helped escaped slaves. The Indian parades never follow an
organized route, but roam at will. Fights used to break out when two different tribes met
on the street, but today the tribes engage in an elaborate call-and-response ceremony
instead. (Some Mardi Gras Indian tribes are also musical groups. The most popular
these days is the Wild Magnolias, who have played and recorded albums with such
luminaries as Dr. John, Bruce Hornsby, and Robbie Robertson.) Some Indians marched
on Mardi Gras Day 2006 to show that their spirit could not be suppressed, while others
sat it out, feeling that it was too soon to partake in traditional celebrations.
You can get a better understanding of these tribes at the Backstreet Cultural Museum,
1116 St. Claude Ave. (% 504-522-4806; www.backstreetmuseum.org), located
off the tourist path in a home in the Treme. See these fantastic, colorful suits up close
in an intimate setting, where the affable owner Sylvester Francis also displays his col-
lection of memorabilia from Jazz Funerals, Social Clubs, Second Lines, and more. The
Presbytere (see p. 204) displays suits as well, but Backstreet is the real deal. Open
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and admission is $5.

good spots. Compared to the bacchanalia on Bourbon Street, these sub-
urban areas offer a whole other world. Sure, some drinking and partying
goes on, but for the most part, they’re good for a family outing.
If you drive a car to New Orleans, never park along a parade route for at
least two hours before or after a parade. You’ll see signs telling you the
parade dates and times all over the place. If you choose to ignore these
warnings, your car will be towed. The best bet for getting to Mardi Gras
parades is to walk or take public transportation. Even for people who know
how to get around, traffic is impossible, so if you must drive, give yourself
plenty of time. Or call a cab; the number for United Cab, the city’s largest
and most well-known cab fleet, is % 504-522-9771.
Your kids are sure to enjoy the Mardi Gras experience; costumes, crowds,
and parades are quite a stimulant. Make sure your kids get plenty of sleep
the night before so they don’t tire out early. Mardi Gras certainly won’t
bore them, but it can make for a long day. Avoid spending the kids’ college
fund on overpriced Mardi Gras food by bringing snacks and drinks with
you. Also, decide on a meeting place in advance in case someone gets lost
or separated.
Citywide parades roll nearly every day in the two weeks prior to Mardi Gras day.
Admission: free. Wheelchair accessible.
Moonwalk
French Quarter
Although the name conjures up that ’80s dance move, the Moonwalk is a
riverside path whose view of the Mississippi River and the Crescent City
Connection (a twin-span bridge to Algiers Point, an established New
Orleans neighborhood) makes for a romantic stroll. From the Moonwalk,
you can watch river traffic coming into and going out of the second busiest
port in the world. Named for Mayor Moon Landrieu, during whose admin-
istration it was built, the Moonwalk is directly across the street from
Jackson Square. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for general sightseeing, or more if
you’re looking for amore.
See map p. 204. Jackson Square. % 504-587-0738. Admission: free. Wheelchair
accessible. Open: 24 hours a day, but go before midnight for safety’s sake.
National World War II Museum
Central Business District
Contrary to initial reports, no looting took place here. This one-of-a-kind
museum, formerly known as The National D-Day Museum, features quietly
poignant and thought-provoking exhibits relating to D-Day, June 6, 1944,
when the Allies stormed the beaches of Normandy and changed the course
of World War II. The museum includes a 110-seat theater playing the Oscar-
nominated documentary D-Day Remembered. The museum also features
exhibits devoted to other beach landings and amphibious invasions during
the war, often told through the personal stories and artifacts of the soldiers

Mardi huh? What the terms mean
Talking the talk and walking the walk are crucial if you plan to go to New Orleans
during Mardi Gras. With these terms, you can talk the talk like a pro. Walking the walk,
on the other hand, is entirely up to you.
 Ball or Tableau Ball: Krewes host these themed, masked balls. Themes change
from year to year.
 Boeuf Gras (fattened calf): The calf represents ritual sacrifice, as well as the last
meal eaten before Lent. It’s also the symbol of Mardi Gras and the first float of the
Rex parade.
 Carnival: A celebration beginning January 6 (the 12th night after Christmas) and
ending Mardi Gras day.
 Court: A krewe’s king, queen, and attendants.
 Doubloon: Krewes throw these metal coins during parades. They feature the logo
of the krewe on one side and its theme for a particular year on the other.
 Fat Tuesday: Otherwise known as Mardi Gras, the last day before Ash Wednesday,
which is the first day of Lent.
 Favor: Krewe members give these souvenirs, which feature the krewe’s logo and
date, to people who attend their ball.
 Flambeaux: Flaming torches carried by parade participants on foot; they aren’t
members of the krewe.
 King Cake: An oval, sugared pastry decorated with purple, gold, and green (Mardi
Gras colors) that contains a small doll representing the baby Jesus.
 Krewe: The traditional word for a Carnival organization.
 Lagniappe (pronounced lan-yap): Loosely means “a little extra,” and refers to any
small gift or token — even a scrap of food or a free drink.
 Mardi Gras: French for “Fat Tuesday.” Technically, if you say “Mardi Gras day,”
you’re really saying “Fat Tuesday day.”
 Rex: Latin for “king.” The King of Carnival is Rex.
 Second Line: A group of people that follows a parade, dancing to the music. Also,
a musical term that specifies a particular shuffling tempo popularized in much
New Orleans music.
 Throws: Inexpensive trinkets thrown from floats to parade watchers, including
doubloons, minifootballs, plastic swords, and spears and all sorts of knick-knacks.
The most coveted throws are the gilded coconuts of the Zulu Social Aid and
Pleasure Club.

New Orleans Museum of Art
Mid-City
Take the Canal Streetcar to City Park, where a stately, oak-lined avenue
leads you to New Orleans’s premier fine arts museum, nicknamed “NOMA”
by the locals. The museum was literally an island in flooded City Park, and
a shelter for some staff who stayed and helped protect its valuable con-
tents. You can find a magnificent 40,000-piece permanent collection of
African American, Asian, European, and pre-Columbian works, including
paintings, sculpture, and a decorative glass collection, plus ever-changing
art exhibits from around the world. Past exhibits have featured works by
Degas, Fabergé, and Monet, as well as Egyptian treasures and a commem-
oration of the Louisiana Purchase. The spectacular Besthoff Sculpture
Garden has reopened and remains a study in contrasts with its natural
backdrop of moss-draped oak trees and the clean lines of modern and con-
temporary sculpture. NOMA always has special exhibits and tours for kids.
Allow two to three hours for your visit.
See map p. 212. 1 Collins Diboll Circle. % 504-658-4100. www.noma.org. Admission:
$8 adults, $7 seniors, $4 children 3–17; free to Louisiana residents; sculpture garden
free (donations accepted), same hours as museum. Parking: free. Wheelchair acces-
sible. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Old U.S. Mint
French Quarter
Built in 1835, this huge Greek Revival building now belongs to the
Louisiana State Museum, but it used to mint money for both the United
States and the Confederacy. Pre-Katrina, it played host to a large exhibit
showcasing New Orleans jazz. The museum features a comprehensive col-
lection of pictures, musical instruments (including Louis Armstrong’s first
trumpet), and other artifacts that trace the development of jazz.
Unfortunately, it sustained terrible damage from Katrina and is still closed
for extensive renovations.

Presbytere
French Quarter
This building was intended as a home for the Spanish clergy, but it took
many years to finish and wound up being used as a courthouse instead.
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 213

Pre-Katrina, it was a branch of the Louisiana State Museum and home of a
Mardi Gras exhibit, featuring colorful costumes and interactive displays
on the festival’s history. The building was damaged from Katrina then
repaired and reopened in September 2006.
See map p. 204. 751 Chartres St. (at Jackson Square). % 800-568-6968 or 504-568-
6968. http://lsm.crt.state.la.us. Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors and 
students, free for children under 12. Wheelchair accessible. Open: Tues–Sun 
9 a.m.–5 p.m.
St. Charles Streetcar and Canal Streetcar
Central Business District/Garden District/Uptown/Carrollton and
Riverfront/Central Business District/Mid-City
The oldest continually operating streetcar system in the world, the St.
Charles Streetcar began in 1835 as a mule-drawn railway and was electri-
fied in 1893. In one of those quirky convergences of tradition and moder-
nity that New Orleans is so famous for, the streetcar was both a national
historic attraction and a functioning arm of the New Orleans public tran-
sit system. The Canal Streetcar began running again in April 2004 after 40
years of being out of service, proving that modern doesn’t always mean
better. The St. Charles line was closed due to storm damage and its green
cars substituted for the Canal line since the new red cars in its Mid-City
streetcar barn was destroyed by floodwaters. Hopefully, by the time you
read this, the historic green cars will be rolling down St. Charles again and
Canal will again have red, air-conditioned cars. Flip to Chapters 9 and 14
for information on the streetcar routes and attractions along the way. The
St. Charles round-trip is about 14 miles and takes two to three hours; the
Canal round-trip is nearly 11 miles and takes one to two hours.
% 504-248-3900. www.norta.org. Admission: $1.25 each way (exact change
required); a VisiTour pass provides unlimited rides on streetcars or buses at a cost
of $5 for 1 day or $12 for 3 days. Ask at your hotel or a tourist office for the nearest
VisiTour pass vendor.
St. Louis Cathedral
French Quarter
The oldest continuously operating cathedral in the United States, the St.
Louis Cathedral dates from 1794, though the church was largely rebuilt in
the 1850s. It has quite an interesting history and is the third building to
stand on this spot. The first church was destroyed by a hurricane in 1722,
and the second by the great fire of 1788. Supposedly the cathedral’s bells
were kept silent for religious reasons (it was Good Friday), so they didn’t
ring out to alarm folks of the fire, which went on to destroy more than 800
buildings. The first post-Katrina mass held in October 2005 was a very
emotional event, allowing many locals to publicly mourn what was lost
and pray for the strength to rebuild. The stained-glass windows and mural
depicting the life of King Louis IX, the cathedral’s patron saint, are espe-
cially beautiful. Located directly behind the cathedral, St. Anthony’s

Garden is named for Pere Antoine, a popular rector who served New
Orleans in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Legend claims that many
duels were fought here in the past. Now, however, the main attraction
comes at night, when a huge shadow of Christ appears against the back of
the church — thanks to a statue and a carefully placed spotlight. The
garden isn’t open for tours, but it is worth peeking into it from Royal Street,
Pirates’ Alley, or Pere Antoine’s Alley.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Need to find an activity to keep the kids smiling and the teenager happy?
Care to enlighten the historian inside you, or perhaps catch a game? The
following suggestions should keep your diverse tastes and needs satisfied.
Especially for kids
Touring New Orleans with your small fry in tow will obviously be a dras-
tically different experience from the one you’d have coming alone or
with your significant other. But that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice
for the sake of the kids. Finding attractions that appeal to all age groups
is easier than you think. For example, a romantic riverboat ride (see
“Dinner on the water: Riverboat cruises,” later in this chapter for more
information) also appeals to the young ’uns — just in a different way.
Here are some kid-tested sights that you’ll likely find interesting as well.
Blaine Kern’s Mardi Gras World
Algiers
Algiers is a lesser known neighborhood of New Orleans that resides on the
other side of the Mississippi River, known as the West Bank. Despite being
sandwiched between the Gulf and the river, the West Bank did not flood at
all during Katrina. If your visit doesn’t coincide with Mardi Gras season,
this place gives you a taste of what it’s all about. You see people building
and/or decorating a Mardi Gras float (this is where most of the floats in
the city are made). You can watch a Mardi Gras film and even get your pic-
ture taken in a Mardi Gras costume. Furthermore, you get complimentary
king cake and coffee. Budget around two hours to get here; take the tour
and find your way back to the Quarter.

Chalmette Battlefield National Park
Chalmette
This park is the site of the historic Battle of New Orleans, where General
Andrew Jackson and a ragtag band staged a desperate defense of the city
against the British. This last major battle of the War of 1812 actually took
place after the war was officially over — the participants just hadn’t yet
received word. Tragically, Chalmette was inundated with storm surge
pushed up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, nicknamed “Mr. Go,” an under-
utilized channel dug up by the Army Corps of Engineers. Locals have
demanded that the channel be forever closed to prevent this from hap-
pening again, but at press time, the battle raged on. Replica cannons, a
reconstructed bunker, and the Chalmette Monument, which honors the
battle’s fallen soldiers, create a sense of history underscored by the col-
lection of battlefield memorabilia housed in the visitor center. Also on the
grounds is the Chalmette National Cemetery, which holds the bodies of
14,000 Union soldiers who died during the Civil War (as well as the bodies
of American soldiers from every subsequent American war). Oddly
enough, only one combatant from the Battle of New Orleans rests here.
The battlefield grounds and public restrooms remain open to visitors, but
the visitor center, Chalmette Monument, and the Malus-Beauregard House
remain closed due to extensive damage.
See map p. 199. 8606 W. Saint Bernard Hwy., Chalmette. www.nps.gov/jela/
chalmette-battlefield.htm. Open: Mon–Thurs 7 a.m.–3 p.m.; Fri–Sat 9 a.m.–
4:30 p.m.
Musée Conti Wax Museum
French Quarter
After 40 years, this third-generation-owned and operated family business
is still going strong and had no Katrina damage. The climate control here
makes this a good place to escape from the heat. As you’d expect, you see
the requisite Haunted Dungeon with its monsters and scenes from well-
known horror tales. You also find a large section devoted to Louisiana leg-
ends such as Andrew Jackson, Marie Laveau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Huey
Long, Pete Fountain, Louis Armstrong, and even a Mardi Gras Indian. Allow
30 to 60 minutes, unless you’re procrastinating to beat the heat.

Rivertown
Kenner
Offering a nice little tourist area along the banks of the Mississippi River,
the city of Kenner sits about 10 miles northwest of the French Quarter.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
216

Only a few areas flooded. A sort of town within a city, Rivertown is a great
family spot for visitors, with a multitude of kid-friendly attractions. (Note:
All the following Rivertown attractions share the same telephone number:
% 504-468-7231.)
 Kids love the six working train layouts at the Louisiana Toy Train
Museum at 519 Williams Blvd. It remains closed for renovations, so
please call ahead.
 The planetarium and observatory at the Freeport McMoRan Daily
Living Science Center (409 Williams Blvd.) is also worth a visit.
Shows run at 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, with three shows on
weekends. On Thursday through Saturday, 7:30 to 10:30 p.m., you
can view the night sky.
 If your child likes magic, puppet shows, mimes, and stories, visit
the Children’s Castle at 503 Williams Blvd.
 Kids, as well as sports fans of all ages, get a kick out of seeing mem-
orabilia and film clips of the New Orleans Saints NFL franchise at
the Saints Hall of Fame at 415 Williams Blvd.
 You can see many animals, as well as a small aquarium, at the
Louisiana Wildlife Museum, 303 Williams Blvd. The museum also
features tales of everyday life from 1750 to 1850 told by people in
period costume.
 Finally, the Mardi Gras Museum of Jefferson Parish (415 Williams
Blvd.) caters to those people who didn’t come during Mardi Gras,
didn’t visit Mardi Gras World, or just can’t get enough Mardi Gras
fun.
% 504-468-7231. www.rivertownkenner.com. All museums are within a 3-block
area and an easy walk from each other. Admission: $3 for adults, $2.50 for seniors
and children under 12; Planetarium and Megadome Cinema $6 for adults, $5 for sen-
iors and kids; two-show combo tickets are $10 for adults, $8 for seniors and kids;
three-show combo tickets are $15 for adults, $12 for seniors and kids. Parking: free.
All museums are wheelchair accessible. Open: Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Especially for teens
Most teenagers admit to a fondness for hanging out in that great social
organism, the mall. If your teen fits in this category, the Riverwalk,
The Shops at Canal Place, and Jax Brewery shopping centers (see
Chapter 13) are good bets for shopping or just hangin’ around.
If your kid likes vampires, that ultimate Goth magnet — the cemetery —
is almost certainly to attract him or her. The cemeteries of New Orleans
are attractions in their own right, filled with elegant statuary, crypts, and
tombs, but youngsters find them especially appealing. (For information
on guided cemetery tours, see “Spirited Fun: Cemetery tours, “ at the
end of this chapter.) This section lists some popular local haunts.
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 217

Lafayette Cemetery No. 1
Garden District
The cemetery remained intact post-Katrina. This place may not be as old
as St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, but the Lafayette Cemetery No. 1 still features
its share of large above-ground tombs. Anne Rice fans take note: This
cemetery is also the family burial place of the fictional vampire Lestat. The
cemetery has figured into many books and films, including the movie ver-
sion of Interview with the Vampire. Touring the cemetery alone is unsafe.
Only visit here on a guided tour (see the end of this chapter) or in a large
group. Allow 30 to 60 minutes. Note that the famous Commander’s Palace
restaurant sits right across the street from the cemetery.
See map p. 199. 1400 block of Washington Avenue. Admission: free. Wheelchair
accessible.
Metairie Lawn Cemetery
Metairie
The largest of all New Orleans cemeteries, Metairie is also the youngest
(built after the Civil War). You find some of the most amazing tombs in the
city here. Pick up a free cassette-tape tour (with player) at the office.
Unlike most of the other cemeteries in New Orleans, you can tour the
cemetery from your car or walk safely through it. Give yourself an hour.
See map p. 199. 5100 Pontchartrain Blvd. % 504-486-6331. The Canal Streetcar takes
you from the French Quarter to the cemeteries at the end of Canal Street. From there,
the Metairie Cemetery is only a block or two (ask the driver), but you have to walk sev-
eral more blocks from the street to the office. Admission: free. Wheelchair accessible.
New Orleans Pharmacy Museum
French Quarter
Louis Dufilho, the first licensed pharmacist in the United States, opened an
apothecary shop here in 1823. The Creole-style town home also served as
his residence, and he supposedly grew herbs for his medicines in the
courtyard. The museum opened in 1950, and it features lots of voodoo
potions, giant syringes, bone saws, leeches, and other medical instru-
ments, as well as a cosmetics counter (old-time pharmacists also manu-
factured makeup and perfumes). You’ll quickly develop an appreciation
for modern medicine. Allow 20 to 30 minutes.
See map p. 204. 514 Chartres St. (2 blocks from Bourbon Street). % 504-565-8027.
www.pharmacymuseum.org. Admission: $2 adults, $1 seniors and students, chil-
dren under 12 free. Wheelchair accessible. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
St. Louis Cemetery No. 1
French Quarter
Founded in the late 1700s, this “city of the dead” is the oldest extant ceme-
tery in the city and features large tombs, monuments, and smaller,
unmarked niches that resemble baker’s ovens. No Katrina damage
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
218

occurred here. People still leave gifts at the tomb of legendary voodoo
queen Marie Laveau to pay their respects and perhaps to ask for supernat-
ural aid. Louis the vampire from Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles has an
empty tomb here, and the acid-dropping scene from Easy Rider was shot
here. Only visit here in a large group or on an organized tour because the
neighborhood is in a high-crime district. For this reason (and to avoid the
errant ghoul or vampire), come only during daylight. Allow 30 to 60 minutes.
See map p. 204. 400 block of Basin Street (4 blocks from Bourbon Street). % 504-
482-5065. Admission: free, but organized tours aren’t. Call Save Our Cemeteries at
% 504-525-3377 for information on taking a tour. Wheelchair accessible for the most
part, but some spots might pose problems.
Especially for history buffs
Almost all the sights in this chapter have historic value, but here are a
few that die-hard History Channel buffs don’t want to miss.
1850 House, Lower Pontalba Building
French Quarter
Plans to reopen remain uncertain since this property is owned by the
state, which experienced tough budget cuts since Katrina. The beautifully
restored Pontalba Apartments (as they’re locally known) were built in
1849, originally as individual town houses. The Baroness Pontalba built
them in an effort to combat the deterioration of the older part of the city.
The private courtyard, servants’ quarters, and huge rooms with their high
ceilings, marble fireplaces, and authentic period furniture allowed a fasci-
nating look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous, 19th-century style.
Allow 15 to 30 minutes.
See map p. 204. 523 St. Ann St. (on Jackson Square). % 800-568-6968 or 504-568-6968.
http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/1850ex.htm.
Beauregard-Keyes House
French Quarter
This lovely house, built in 1826, is named for two of its most famous ten-
ants: Confederate General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, who
resided here after the Civil War, and author Frances Parkinson Keyes, who
wrote many of her novels here, including the most famous, Dinner at
Antoine’s. Nothing is amiss post-Katrina. Take a gander at the twin stair-
cases, the Doric columns, and the “raised cottage” architecture, and try
to imagine what life was like when this place was a boardinghouse during
the Civil War. The house itself isn’t wheelchair accessible, but the beauti-
ful garden adjoining the house is. Allot 45 to 75 minutes to peruse the
house.
See map p. 204. 1113 Chartres St. (2 blocks from Bourbon Street). % 504-523-7257.
Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors, students, and AAA members, $2 children ages 6–13,
free for children under 6. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–3 p.m. Tours on the hour.

Confederate Museum
Warehouse District
Billed as the oldest museum in Louisiana, this place has displayed Civil
War artifacts since 1891 and was a trooper during Katrina. The memora-
bilia includes uniforms, photographs, guns, battle flags, swords, and per-
sonal belongings of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, and
Confederate president Jefferson Davis. The museum houses the second-
largest collection of Confederate memorabilia in the United States. A visit
to the museum takes about 30 to 60 minutes.

If available, rake the St. Charles Streetcar to Lee Circle and walk one block to Camp
Street. Admission: $5 adults, $4 students and seniors, $2 children under 12. Parking:
On-street and hourly lot nearby. Not accessible for wheelchairs. Open: Thurs–Sat 
10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Gallier House Museum
French Quarter
The museum was safe from the storm. Noted architect James Gallier once
resided in this house, which people say served as the model for vampires
Lestat and Louis’s home in Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles. The house was
thoroughly modern back in 1857 — it has hot and cold running water and
a bathroom. The guided tour gives you insight into mid-19th-century New
Orleans life. Allow an hour to explore this modern miracle.

dren 8–18, free for children under 8. Not accessible for wheelchairs. Open: Mon–Fri
10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Germaine Wells Mardi Gras Museum
French Quarter
This museum, which houses the Mardi Gras gowns worn between 1910
and 1960 by former Arnaud’s owner Germaine Wells, sits atop Arnaud’s
restaurant (see Chapter 11). Give yourself 15 to 20 minutes to peruse the
costumes.

ble for wheelchairs. Open during restaurant hours.
Hermann-Grima House
French Quarter
Cooking demonstrations are held in the period kitchen of this 1832 house
every Thursday from May through October. The house’s interior depicts
funeral customs of the time, except during December, when the house gets
decorated for a “Creole style” Christmas. Tours cover both the house and

the stable. Joint tours of this property and the Gallier House museum are
available; call for details. Allow 30 to 60 minutes, or two hours or more for
the combined tour.

workers can put out the portable ramp. Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Historic New Orleans Collection
French Quarter
If you want the lowdown on the evolution of New Orleans, visit this com-
plex of buildings (one of which dates from 1792) where you can see art,
maps, and original documents from Louisiana’s past, all of which survived
Katrina unscathed. The collection’s research center provides a treasure
trove of research materials. You find the research center in a beautifully
restored courthouse and police station at 410 Charles St. The exhibits
change periodically. Allow 30 to 60 minutes.
See map p. 204. 533 Royal St. (1 block from Bourbon Street). % 504-523-4662. www.
hnoc.org. Admission: free. Guided tours cost $4 and are given at 10 a.m., 11 a.m.,
2 p.m., and 3 p.m. Wheelchair accessible. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Jackson Barracks Military Museum
Holy Cross
Generals Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant served here prior to the Civil
War; now it serves as headquarters for the Louisiana National Guard. The
reason to visit is the military museum, where a chronological history traces
the involvement of Louisiana soldiers in major wars and skirmishes from
the American Revolution to today. You also see flags, guns, artillery pieces,
uniforms, and other military hardware on display among the museum’s arti-
facts. Allot 60 to 90 minutes to see the museum and to get there from the
Quarter. Note: In 2004, Jackson Barracks was struck by lightning and the
subsequent fire, although limited to the attic, forced the staff to move all
historical artifacts to a safe location. Then in 2005, Hurricane Katrina hap-
pened. So please call ahead to ensure the museum has reopened.
See map p. 199. 6400 St. Claude Ave. % 504-278-8242. Take the St. Claude bus and
get off in front of the museum. Admission: free. Parking: free. Wheelchair accessible.
Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop and Bar
French Quarter
Records verify this building’s existence since 1772 though many insist that
it’s much older and is, in fact, the oldest building in the Mississippi Valley
(try to overlook the hideous fake plaster job offered as a compromise
when preservationists were concerned about the continued exposure of
the historic bricks-between-post construction, pointing out that it was
originally a stucco exterior, but the bar argued that its very identity was
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 221

married to the exposed brick). Perhaps the forced faux renovation helped
it withstand Katrina as it weathered the storm just fine. According to
legend, the pirate Jean Lafitte and his brother Pierre used it as a front for
their illegal activities, posing as blacksmiths while selling ill-gotten pirate
booty (and, some say, slaves). Since 1944, it’s been a bar, and was the pre-
ferred haunt of Tennessee Williams. Kids can’t go inside, but you can get
an excellent view of the dark interior through the open doorway. Only
budget a couple of minutes here, unless you plan to have a drink or two.
See map p. 204. 941 Bourbon St. % 504-522-9377. Admission: no cover charge. Part
of it is not accessible to wheelchairs. Open: daily 11 a.m.–close (no set closing time).
Napoleon House
French Quarter
People claim that Mayor Nicholas Girod’s home was offered to the exiled
Napoleon Bonaparte as a refuge, but Napoleon died before the scheme got
off the ground. Some doubt this tale’s veracity, claiming that the building
was built after Napoleon’s death. Whatever the truth, the building’s been
trading on this near brush with glory ever since, and it’s become a favorite
spot of bohemian locals in recent decades. Today, the Napolean House bar
and cafe provides patrons with a dark and quiet atmosphere, though the
hours have been significantly shortened. Unless you want to grab a drink
or a bite to eat, only allow yourself a few minutes here. Kids are also 
welcome.
See map p. 204. 500 Chartres St. (at the corner of Chartres and St. Louis streets, 
2 blocks from Bourbon Street and Jackson Square). % 504-524-9752. Admission: no
cover. Wheelchair accessible. Open: Fri–Wed 11:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Old Absinthe House
French Quarter
According to legend, Andrew Jackson and the Lafitte brothers (pirates Jean
and Pierre) met in this 1806 building to plan the Battle of New Orleans.
During Prohibition, it was a speakeasy. The drink for which the bar is
named is illegal these days, so the bar serves anisette instead — which
tastes like absinthe but, thankfully, doesn’t cause brain damage. Stop here
for a few minutes to look around, or longer if you’re going to drink. Because
it’s a bar, kids aren’t allowed inside. No Katrina damage of note.
See map p. 204. 240 Bourbon St. % 504-523-3181. www.oldabsinthehouse.com.
Admission: no cover. Wheelchair accessible. Open: Daily from 9 a.m. till whenever
they decide to close.
Old Ursuline Convent
French Quarter
Some people say this structure is the oldest building in New Orleans and
the entire Mississippi Valley, as well as the only surviving building from
the French colonial period in what is now the United States. Erected
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
222

between 1745 and 1752, it was once run by the Sisters of Ursula, who had
the first girls-only school in the United States. In 1831, the state assembly
met here. Today, it houses a Catholic archive with documents that go back
to 1718. Everything is in order post-Katrina. Give yourself 60 to 75 minutes
to see it all.
See map p. 204. 1100 Chartres St. (2 blocks from Bourbon Street). % 504-529-3040.
Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors, $3 students, children under 8 free. Not accessible
for wheelchairs. Open: tours run Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–3 p.m. on the hour (closed for lunch
at noon); Sat–Sun 11:15 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2 p.m.
Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel and International 
Shrine of St. Jude
French Quarter
Erected in 1826 across the street from St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, Our Lady
served as a convenient place to hold funerals for victims of yellow fever
and other diseases. Our Lady serves as a shrine to both St. Jude (saint of
impossible causes) and a guy called St. Expedite. Legend claims that this
saint’s statue showed up at the church in a crate, marked only with the
word “expedite” stamped on the outside. The name stuck, and today
people know him as the saint to whom you pray when you want things in
a hurry (I’m not making this up). No doubt many New Orleanians are call-
ing on him for a quick rebuilding of their homes, businesses and the city
in general. Allow 15 minutes.

Pitot House
Mid-City
Located on a ridge of land between Esplanade Avenue and Bayou St. John,
the Pitot House survived Katrina, thankfully. James Pitot, the first mayor
of incorporated New Orleans, moved this beautiful house in 1810, which
was originally built on a different spot in the late 1700s. This excellent
example of an 18th-century, West Indies–style plantation home features
wide galleries and large columns. It is owned by the Louisiana Landmark
Society, which uses the home as its headquarters. Seeing the house takes
one to two hours plus transportation time.

Longue Vue House and Gardens
New Orleans
Natural and formal gardens, gorgeous fountains, and tranquil ponds form
the backdrop for this beautiful Greek Revival mansion, which sits at the
end of an oak-lined drive just minutes from downtown New Orleans. Inside,
savor the beautiful antiques, rice-paper wall coverings, Oriental carpets,
and other lovely touches. Families enjoy the Discovery Garden, a half-acre,
interactive garden for children of all ages. A visit here takes one to two
hours plus transportation time. During Katrina, roof leaks caused damage
to some of its collections, while flooding destroyed some gardens that took
years to design and grow. However, the site reopened in April 2006 and
continues to refurbish and replant.

Washington Artillery Park
French Quarter
This spot and Jackson Square have long been two of the most popular
places for tourists and young people. Street performers often run through
their routines for tips in front of the steps leading to the top of the levee
(which double as seats for a small amphitheater). This place had fallen
into disrepair for awhile, but the Audubon Institute prettied it up a few
years ago by relandscaping the area, reopening the public restrooms, and
providing a tourist information center.

Woldenberg Riverfront Park
French Quarter
This park, which features almost 20 acres of green grass, open space, and
hundreds of trees and shrubs, makes for a nice break along the Mississippi
River. This area has historically been the city’s promenade; nowadays it
stretches from the Moonwalk to the Aquarium of the Americas and fea-
tures works by popular local artists. At night, or even during the day, take
a romantic stroll and watch the many ships sail by.

Granted, the Crescent City isn’t a sports mecca on the order of, say,
Chicago or New York, but it does offer some areas of interest for gamers
and fans of major- and minor-league franchises, including the NFL’s New
Orleans Saints, of course, the city’s long-suffering football team, as well
as the family favorite New Orleans Zephyrs minor-league baseball club.

In 2002, New Orleans officially became the NBA home of the former
Charlotte Hornets, salving the deep wound left in the local hoops con-
sciousness when the New Orleans Jazz packed up for Utah back in 1979.
After the hurricane, both the Saints and the Hornets were welcomed by
other clubs around the country while they waited for their hometown
arenas to be repaired.
Fair Grounds Race Course
Mid-City
One of the oldest racetracks in the country, this course has hosted Pat
Garrett, Frank James (brother of Jesse and a betting commissioner), and
Generals Ulysses S. Grant and George Custer, among others. The racing
season runs from Thanksgiving Day to late March, though flooding from
Katrina prevented it from opening in time for the 2005–2006 season; it is
expected to reopen in time for the 2006–2007 season. The New Orleans
Jazz and Heritage Festival (also known as Jazz Fest) is held here every year
during the last weekend of April and the first weekend of May and
attracted 350,000 to the first festival held after Katrina.

Harrah’s New Orleans Casino
Central Business District
Because gambling is a hot-button issue around here, I’m neither advocat-
ing nor condemning it as an attraction, family or otherwise. Nevertheless,
this place is huge, both in terms of its size and its impact (for good or ill)
on the local community. You may want to take a look at it for those rea-
sons alone.

East Jefferson
Although New Orleans doesn’t host a major league baseball team, it does
have the Zephyrs — the AAA farm team of the Houston Astros. Since their
arrival in New Orleans in the 1990s, the Zephyrs have become a popular
team among jaded local sports fans.
See map p. 199. 6000 Airline Dr., East Jefferson. % 504-734-5155. See www.zephyrs
baseball.com for game times and admission. Located approximately 9 miles from
the French Quarter, on the way to the airport. Take the Airline bus and get off by the
stadium.
Superdome
Central Business District
The Superdome served as a last-resort hurricane shelter, and as you most
likely saw on the news, the city was not prepared to care for the nearly
20,000 people who sought shelter here during the storm. Health conditions
quickly moved from bad to worse; it is reported that at least 3 elderly
people died here during the storm. (Initial reports of rape and rampant
violence were later discredited.) After a $186-million restoration, the
Superdome reopened on September 25, 2006, when the Saints beat the
Falcons to much fanfare. One of the largest buildings in the world in terms
of diameter (680 feet), the Superdome provides a climate-controlled envi-
ronment for 76,000 New Orleans Saints fans or more than 100,000 concert-
goers. The Superdome also hosts trade shows and conventions.
See map p. 207. 1500 Poydras. % 504-587-3663; www.superdome.com. Take the
Poydras bus and get off in front of the Superdome.

Mississippi gaming: Riverboat casinos
Harrah’s isn’t the only craps game in town. You may also want to look into a couple of
riverboat casinos in the area:
 The Boomtown Belle Casino resides in Harvey (4132 Peters Rd., located about 15
miles due south of the French Quarter; % 504-366-7711; www.boomtownnew
orleans.com). The taxi ride costs about $24.
 In Kenner, you find the Treasure Chest Casino (5050 Williams Blvd., 15 miles north-
west of the French Quarter; % 504-443-8000; www.treasurechestcasino.
com). Many locals give this casino the highest marks of the casinos mentioned
here. A taxi runs about $24.

Seeing New Orleans by Guided Tour
To tour or not to tour? That is the question. The answer depends on
your idea of a vacation. If you prefer to be independent and take a spon-
taneous approach, you’ll probably be happier doing your own thing. 
If you enjoy socializing and knowing what to expect, a tour could be
exactly what you want. You can get an entertaining overview of the city
(or of a specific part of it, such as the French Quarter or the Garden
District) by taking a guided tour. Depending on the tour operator you
choose, you’ll definitely see some good sights, (hopefully) be enter-
tained by your guide, and discover a thing or two.
Bear in mind, that as often as not your tour will offer more entertain-
ment value than historical significance. I mention some exceptions in
this chapter, but most tours here are Show Biz, baby. They all mean well,
and most of them even have their facts right, but you’ll also get plenty of
drama, intrigue, history, and innuendo — New Orleans’s rich history
more than holds its own with daytime soaps.
Nevertheless, tours are still a lot of fun and a nice way to meet other
people. They can also provide the perfect compromise for those days
when you’re trying to balance your aching feet against the urge to get
out and see some sights. General orientation tours and specialty tours
make up the two main types of guided tours. You find information on
both types in this section.
Time versus info: General orientation tours
If you only have limited time but still want to experience as much as pos-
sible, consider a general orientation tour. Riding around the city on a
half-hour carriage tour, you get a condensed New Orleans history lesson,
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 227
Help! I’ve been de-toured
If you’re interested in taking a tour, keep your eyes open. Some hotel concierges have
been known to take kickbacks from certain tour operators to steer business exclu-
sively to them. Obviously, not every concierge is on the take, but your best bet would
be to book any tours directly through the operator; no reputable operator will force
you to go through a third party.
If you can’t find sufficient tour information at your hotel, call or visit the State Office of
Tourism (529 St. Ann St., right on Jackson Square; % 504-568-5661). Aside from offer-
ing a multitude of booklets, brochures, and other such material, the staff also has
someone from the New Orleans Convention and Visitor’s Bureau on hand to give you
the straight dope on tours and attractions, and to steer you toward a reputable tour
that’s right for your budget, needs, or time frame. For more information on tourist
offices, see Chapter 9.

find out about the local architecture, locate the good clubs, and see the
attractions. However, general information is all that you’ll get. Walking
tours and bus tours may take a little longer, but with a thorough guide,
you can walk away feeling like you’re in the know.
Cooling off with a bus tour
If you can’t take the heat, a bus tour — where you can see the sights
without leaving the air conditioning — is just your cup of iced tea. Aside
from seeing the whole city, you can also take a tour that goes outside of
town to plantations or swamps. Licensed guides narrate these tours, and
buses come variously equipped with TVs, VCRs, and DVDs, stereo
sound, bathrooms, cellphones, and equipment for travelers with disabili-
ties. (If a particular amenity is important to you, make sure to ask for the
appropriate bus ahead of time.)
One of the oldest and most reliable tour companies, New Orleans Tours
(% 504-592-0560) offers city and neighborhood tours by bus, as well as
riverboat cruises, swamp tours, plantation tours, walking tours, nightlife
tours, jazz tours, and combination tours. For more options, check out
these other tour companies as well:
 Dixieland Tours (% 800-489-8747)
 Gray Line (% 800-535-7786 or 504-569-1401) — offering special —
and somewhat controversial — “Devastation Tours” (see Chapter 2
for more information)
 Hotard Coaches (% 504-944-0253)
Strolling the Quarter
Because the French Quarter is the oldest and arguably most interesting
part of New Orleans, most tourists focus on this area. No large buses are
allowed in the Quarter (though you will see smaller buses and vans), so
walking is your best option for getting around.
Strolling around the French Quarter on your own is the best way to see
the area. Traveling on your own gives you the freedom to linger in a
pastry shop or park, stop to watch street entertainers, poke your head
in all the cute stores you find, admire the local architecture, or follow
your nose into off-the-beaten-path nooks and crannies. Chapter 14 lists
several itineraries for walking tours that you can take on your own. If
you still feel like you want to bring someone along to tell you what
you’re seeing, contact Friends of the Cabildo (% 504-523-3939), a non-
profit group that gives two-hour walking tours of the French Quarter.
Cost is $12 for adults, $10 for seniors and students, and free for kids 12
and under. See our interview with tour guide Rebecca Sell on p. 17.
Because the French Quarter is part of the Jean Lafitte National Park, you
can also get a free tour from the National Park Service. The service
offers only one tour each day at 9:30 a.m., and each person must pick up
his or her own ticket. The tickets are given out starting at 9 a.m. on a
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
228

first-come, first-served basis. For more information, stop by the Visitor’s
Information Center at 419 Decatur St. or call % 504-589-2133.
University of New Orleans professor emeritus W. Kenneth Holditch (who
really knows his stuff) leads the Heritage Literary Tours (732 Frenchmen
St., % 504-949-9805). He gives a general tour centered on the literary
legacy of the French Quarter (which has played host to a considerable
number of famous and colorful writers over the years) as well as a more
specialized tour about Tennessee Williams. If you arrange it in advance,
he can (probably) design a tour for you around a specific author. He’s a
character in his own right, and his tours are fun, informative, and loaded
with anecdotes. Tours are $20 for adults and $10 for students; call ahead
if you have something specific in mind.
Riding in style: Carriage tours
Like bus tours, a carriage tour may or may not be up your alley. Riding
through the French Quarter in a mule-drawn carriage certainly gives you
a more intimate experience than riding around in a bus with 50 or 60
other name-tag-wearing passengers. It can also be quite romantic with
the hypnotic clip-clop of the mules’ hooves. A good carriage driver can
show you the highlights of the Quarter in just 30 minutes; spend an hour
touring, and you’ll feel like a native.
Carriage rides stay in the Quarter, and no one guarantees the veracity 
of the information you receive. Some drivers are licensed tour guides,
though most aren’t. Nevertheless, each one has his or her area of expert-
ise. Some have eaten their way through the city, some are historians,
and others pride themselves on knowing the location of every bar. One
driver may regale you with ghost stories, another may tell you jokes, and
a third may not say much. Talk to the driver for a minute and try to
gauge his or her personality before hopping in.
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 229
French Quarter?
“People are surprised to learn that the French Quarter is actually not French. It would
be more accurate to call it the Spanish/American/Caribbean Quarter. There were two
devastating fires in the late 1700’s that destroyed all of the French buildings except for
the Ursuline Convent (that building dates back from 1752; it’s the oldest in the
Mississippi River Valley). The Spanish enacted building codes to prevent such a dis-
aster from ever occurring again, and many of the builders were refugees from the
slave revolts in San Domingue (Haiti). People always get a chuckle to then learn that
our very first Spanish governor in the city was a fellow by the name of Don Alejandro
O’Reilly. It sounds strange, but it’s true: the fellow we now consider the father of
Spanish Louisiana was actually an Irish soldier of fortune.”
—Rebecca Sell gives walking tours of the French Quarter through Friends of the
Cabildo (% 504-523-3939). See our interview with her on p. 17.

Most of the carriages in the Quarter line up along Decatur Street at
Jackson Square and at carriage stands at the corners of Royal and St.
Louis, Bourbon and Conti, or Bourbon and Toulouse. Also keep your
eyes open for carriages cruising throughout the Quarter or parked on a
corner waiting for a fare.
You see two types of carriages: the large hard-topped, bus-like models
that you share with anybody else that comes along, and the smaller con-
vertible models that you hire individually for your party. Generally, car-
riages have abandoned the per-person rates, charging $50 for a half-hour
ride and $105 for an hour (the latter price includes picking you up from
your hotel).
If your tour lasts less than 30 minutes, your driver is giving you a “zip
tour.” If this is the case, confront the driver and find out if the tour can
be extended. If the driver doesn’t comply, complain to the driver’s boss.
If the driver refuses to give you the boss’s name, write down the driver’s
name (if you know it), the company name, and the carriage number (on
its side or back), and call the city’s Taxicab Bureau (% 504-565-6272)
to complain.
If you want a carriage to pick you up, call one of the following licensed
carriage companies:
 Good Old Days Buggies (% 504-523-0804)
 Mid-City Carriages (% 504-581-4415) — They’re not currently
operating (call for updates), but their story is worth noting: After
Katrina, dedicated employees rescued the mules and horses from
the flooded stable and brought them to a parking lot where they
waited for help to arrive. Six days later, they led the animals to the
interstate, loaded them into trailers and drove them to safety in
Baton Rouge, where they still remain.
 Old Quarter Tours (% 504-944-0446)
 Royal Carriages (% 504-943-8820)
Filling a niche: Specialty tours
Specialty tours are good bets if you’re deeply interested in a particular
subject. Although anyone can parrot the touristy info you’ll get on a
basic orientation tour, you’ll more likely sound like an expert to family
and friends back home if you take a specialty tour.
Gay New Orleans
The Bienville Foundation’s Gay Heritage Tour (% 504-945-6789) is a 
21⁄2-hour tour that shows you the city from a gay-friendly perspective. You
explore the Quarter and hear about such figures as Tennessee Williams,
Clay Shaw, and Ellen DeGeneres. Robert Batson, the knowledgeable and
personable tour guide, also explains the importance of various gay land-
marks. The $20 tour leaves from Alternatives (a gay-targeted gift shop at
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
230

909 Bourbon St.); days and times vary seasonally (the tour doesn’t run
during Aug or Dec), so be sure to call for information.
Discovering New Orleans’s African American heritage
If you want to delve into New Orleans’s history of Africans and African
Americans, contact African American Heritage Tours (% 504-288-3478).
Tours include trips to plantations, Xavier University (the first Black
Catholic university in the United States), and a narrative on historic sites
such as Liberty Bank, which was founded by African Americans.
Hepcats unite: Jazz tours
Photographer for the Times-Picayune and well-known local jazz historian
John McCusker leads John McCusker’s Cradle of Jazz Tour (% 504-
282-3583). He takes visitors on a bargain-priced ($25), 21⁄2-hour van tour
every Saturday morning that traces the history of New Orleans jazz. He
points out the spots where jazz was born, where it matured, and where
performers such as Louis Armstrong were born or played their music.
You must make reservations in advance.
Spirited Fun: Cemetery, vampire, and ghost tours
Many cemeteries simply aren’t safe unless you’re with an organized
group. I strongly advise against wandering through any cemetery 
(especially St. Louis No. 2) alone or without an official tour.
The members of Save Our Cemeteries (% 504-525-3377), a nonprofit
organization, do more to restore and maintain New Orleans’s cemeteries
than anyone else. Their tours are a good crash course for newcomers to
the subject.
Fred Hatfield (% 504-891-4862), a semi-retired native New Orleanian, has
spent his whole life in the neighborhood of Lafayette Cemetery No. 1.
Consequently, he’s done extensive research on the people buried there, as
any good neighbor would do. His combination walking tours of the Garden
District and Lafayette No. 1 take about two hours and cost $14 per person;
he also gives individual tours of the cemetery for $9. All tours require a
minimum of four people. He’s usually home, so give him a call.
Many visitors have raved about the wealth and quality of information
they receive from Historic New Orleans Walking Tours (% 504-947-
2120; www.tourneworleans.com). Here you can find a number of French
Quarter tours, including tours for history and “mystique,” as well as the
following cemetery tours:
 The Cemetery/Voodoo Tour takes you to the tomb of Marie Laveau
and to an actual voodoo temple. You get the straight facts about
voodoo’s West African religious roots and its modern-day practi-
tioners. In short, it’s long on the authentic and short on the wink-
wink-nudge-nudge sensationalism you may get elsewhere. You also
see other famous burial sites and hear the stories of some leg-
endary locals.
Chapter 12: Discovering New Orleans’s Best Attractions 231

 The Garden District/Cemetery Tour tours this historic neighbor-
hood pointing out rocker Trent Reznor’s former castle, Indianapolis
Colts quarterback Peyton Manning’s boyhood home, and Anne
Rice’s former manse.
 Haunted History Tours (% 504-861-2727; www.hauntedhistory
tours.com) offers vampire and cemetery tours. You can also opt
for the Haunted History Tour itself, which details various ghost sto-
ries and legends in the Quarter. The tour is entertaining, but don’t
put too much stock in the “facts.”
 Magic Walking Tours (% 504-588-9693) even lets you go on a vam-
pire hunt. If you’re really lucky, your guide may even let you carry
the wooden stake and mallet.
 Weekend Jazz Walk (% 504-947-2120) explores jazz landmarks
such as Storyville, Congo Square, J&M Studio and more.
No petting the gators: Swamp tours
Swamp tours can be a great deal of fun. You see some incredible scenery
and wildlife, you’re out on the water, and you get a feel for what it’s like
to live out on the bayous. Your guide may call alligators up to the boat
for a little snack of chicken, but be careful to keep your hands inside the
boat because gators can’t always tell the difference.
You can find plenty of swampland worth exploring within the metro
area, but the really isolated swamp areas lie three hours outside the city.
 Cypress Swamp Tours (% 504-581-4501) tour the Bayou Segnette
area (near Westwego, on the West Bank across the Crescent City
Connection) for $22 per adult and $12 for children under 12.
 Dr. Paul Wagner, a well-known swamp ecologist and a national con-
servationist, gives excellent tours of the Honey Island Swamp area.
His Honey Island Swamp Tours (% 504-242-5877 or 985-641-1769)
cost $20 per person.
 Gator Swamp Tours (% 800-875-4287 or 504-484-6100) also have
good tours of the Honey Island Swamp, approximately 40 minutes
east of New Orleans; they charge $20 per adult and $10 for children
under 12.
 Jean Lafitte Swamp Tours (% 800-445-4109 or 504-587-1719) tour
the Bayou aux Carpes, a patch of private land flush with all sorts 
of wildlife near the intercoastal canal, just 20 minutes from the
Crescent City Connection; cost is $24 for adults and $13 for chil-
dren under 12.
Ask when calling about the length of each tour whether the tours are pri-
vate or public, and how many people are allowed on one tour. You don’t
want one that’s too crowded.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
232

Other tour companies operate in the Atchafalaya Basin, a vast swamp
about 21⁄2 hours west of New Orleans, between Baton Rouge and
Lafayette. These include McGee’s Landing (% 800-445-6681 or
318-228-2384) and bilingual (English/French) tours with Angelle’s
Atchafalaya Basin Swamp Tours (% 337-228-8567). The basin is pretty
big, so the good tours take more time; you may want to budget your
afternoon around it.
Shopping for old stuff: Antique tours
Macon Riddle’s Antique Tours (% 504-899-3027; www.neworleans
antiquing.com) provides an enthusiastic and educational way to see
New Orleans’s antique districts, which are all the more prized after
Katrina. Macon Riddle picks you up at your hotel, takes you on a cus-
tomized antique shopping tour, and even makes lunch reservations for
you. She even takes care of shipping your antique finds home.
Dinner on the water: Riverboat cruises
Riverboat cruises are extremely popular in New Orleans, as you may
expect. Gambling cruises, however, are a thing of the past (riverboat
casinos rarely leave the dock, because most gamblers want to be able to
come and go at will). You can still find harbor cruises, dinner and danc-
ing cruises, river cruises, and combination cruises where you also visit
the Audubon Zoo or Chalmette Battlefield. The riverboats come in sev-
eral different forms: steam- or diesel-powered, with their paddle wheels
on the side or on the stern, and so forth. Companies and boats offering
riverboat tours include the following:
 Creole Queen Paddle Wheel Tours (% 800-445-4109 or 504-524-
0814)
 John James Audubon (% 800-233-BOAT or 504-586-8777)
 New Orleans Steamboat Co. (% 800-233-BOAT or 504-586-8777)

Chapter 13
Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on major shopping areas
 Assessing shops post-Katrina
 Perusing the big-name stores
 Browsing at the market
 Venturing into the different neighborhoods
V
acation shopping is an odd thing. You’d think that spending yet
more money is the last thing a vacationer would want to do. But for
whatever reason, whether trying to find that perfect memento of their
trip or suddenly deciding to redecorate their home with antiques, vaca-
tioners shop here — a lot.
This chapter explores shopping in New Orleans from a couple different
angles. It runs through the big-name stores, neighborhood markets, and
the major shopping areas, some of which feature antiques shops and art
galleries.
Assessing Katrina’s Damage 
to the City’s Shops
One thing you may have learned from all of the post-Katrina coverage 
of New Orleans is its importance to the rest of the nation as an interna-
tional port, which gives it a huge advantage over other American cities
for the shopping vacationer. Normally, if you can name it, you can proba-
bly find it in New Orleans, though post-Katrina problems with distribu-
tion and mail service caused stock woes for many shopkeepers. By the
time you arrive, this should be much improved.
Shop hours will vary considerably as businesses juggle the need to be
open with the lack of employees or other resources. Also, many are
struggling just to stay open, and may be forced to close their doors
before your arrival. So if you have a particular store in mind, call ahead.
Please do your best to support these shops; your purchases will help
boost the city’s economy.

Surveying the Scene
Your shopping options in New Orleans aren’t limited to things such as
home furnishings, pottery, and designer clothing — also on hand is quite
a bit of local artwork and imported fine jewelry. Don’t neglect the locally
crafted jewelry, however. Some local designers, such as Mignon Faget,
work with such innovation and creativity that their shops seem more
like art galleries.
If you’re shopping for antiques or contemporary art, you can find plenty
on Royal and Magazine streets, which are both really bustling after the
storm. Royal Street boasts the finest, most expensive goods; Magazine
Street promises more bargain-basement finds. Also in that area, and on
Julia Street, are the city’s art galleries. (I cover these areas individually
later in this chapter.)
A word on sales tax: Weigh your options carefully if buying a large,
expensive item. Because sales tax in New Orleans is 9 percent, you may
save money by having the item shipped to you at home. Of course you
pay for shipping and handling instead of the sales tax, but the difference
may be in your favor.
A program called Louisiana Tax-Free Shopping benefits shoppers who
hail from other countries. If you aren’t from the United States, look for
store windows with this program’s logo; these merchants give you a tax-
refund voucher that you can cash in, either at the airport or by mail. To
take advantage of this program, you need a valid foreign passport and
round-trip airline ticket. Call % 504-568-5323 for details.
Checking Out the Big Names
Because corporate America has made inroads here during the last half-
century, local homegrown institutions have found it difficult to compete
with the deep pockets of the big-name corporations. As a result, New
Orleans is now almost exclusively the province of the big-name corpo-
rate chains. Here’s a list of the big players that have since reopened:
 Brooks Brothers: The Shops at Canal Place, 300 block of Canal Street
(% 504-522-4200; www.brooksbrothers.com); open Monday to
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.
 Gucci: The Shops at Canal Place, 300 block of Canal Street (% 504-
524-5544; www.gucci.com); open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.
 Lord & Taylor: New Orleans Centre, 1400 Poydras St. (% 504-581-
5673; www.lordandtaylor.com); open Monday to Saturday from
10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.

Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 237

 Macy’s: New Orleans Centre, 1400 Poydras St. (% 800-456-2297 
or 504-592-5985; www.macys.com); open Monday to Saturday from
10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Saks Fifth Avenue: The Shops at Canal Place, 300 block of Canal
Street (% 504-524-2200; www.saksfifthavenue.com); open
Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from noon
to 6 p.m.
These big-name stores, of course, need a place to house their wares, and
New Orleans offers plenty of alternatives for shoppers hoping to meet 
all their shopping needs under one roof. In addition to the Canal Place
Shopping Center (see the “Canal Street” section, later in this chapter),
the following shopping areas are good choices for a little mall-browsing:
 Jackson Brewery: Just across from Jackson Square (600 Decatur
St.; % 504-566-7245; www.jacksonbrewery.com), the old Jax
Brewery is now a complex of shops, cafes, restaurants, and enter-
tainment spots. Look for gourmet and Cajun and Creole foodstuffs,
fashions, toys, hats, crafts, pipes, posters, and souvenirs. You also
find a huge Virgin Megastore (% 504-671-8988) and for pet lovers,
Woof & Whiskers (% 504-568-0065). The Brewery hours are
Sunday to Thursday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday to Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Note that many shops in the Brewery close
at 5:30 or 6 p.m.
 New Orleans Centre: This place (1400 Poydras St.; % 504-568-0000;
www.neworleanscentre.com) offers upscale department stores,
such as Lord & Taylor and Macy’s, plus three levels of specialty
shops, restaurants, and a huge food court. Add on the fancy office
tower and you get plenty of foot traffic in this spacious environment.
Hours are Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday
from noon to 6 p.m.
 Riverwalk Marketplace: Actually a covered mall running along the
river from Poydras Street to the Convention Center (1 Poydras St.;
% 504-522-1555; www.riverwalkmarketplace.com), this is a 
popular venue that’s also quite atmospheric. Take a break from
shopping and just watch the river roll by or the occasional free
entertainment. Among the more than 100 specialty shops are such
big hitters as Eddie Bauer, The Sharper Image, and Banana
Republic, plus several eateries.
Going to Market
New Orleans’s long-time street market is the French Market (% 504-
522-2621), a complex of shops that begins on Decatur Street across 
from Jackson Square that sits on high ground and never flooded. In 
the market, you can find candy, cookware, fashions, crafts, toys, New
Orleans memorabilia, candles — all manner of goodies, though you
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
238

really have to look for the true gems. Also in the complex are Café du
Monde (% 504-581-2914) and the Farmer’s Market and Flea Market
(% 504-596-3420), which are located in the 1200 block of North Peters.
Hours are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Café du Monde is open 24 hours.)
The original Crescent City Farmers Market (700 Magazine St.; % 504-
861-5898; www.crescentcityfarmersmarket.org) is held every
Saturday from 8 a.m. to noon in a parking lot at the corner of Magazine
and Girod streets in the Warehouse District. Japanese journalist Ryoko
Sato, who has studied American farmers markets for years, generously
donated $7,000 to the department of Loyola University that runs the
Crescent City Farmers Market. It offers fresh local produce, flowers,
cooking demonstrations, and more. Plenty of free, off-street parking is
available because it’s a Saturday and the meter maids aren’t out and
about. Depending on where you’re staying, you may be able to walk
here. Come early for the best selection, or wait for the cooking demon-
stration at 10 a.m.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
The trick to shopping in New Orleans is knowing where to go. The major
shopping areas you want to visit are the French Quarter, the Central
Business District, the Warehouse District, and along Magazine Street,
both in the Garden District and the Uptown area. Thankfully, all of these
neighborhoods were spared from major flooding — some had no water
at all — which gives you an idea of just how large New Orleans was
because 80 percent of the city was underwater at one point. The best
strategy for shopping in these neighborhoods is to just wander around
and see which shops catch your eye. Here is a rundown of the city’s best
shopping areas and the scoop on what you can find inside.
French Quarter
This section breaks down some of the Quarter’s more prominent shop-
ping streets — Bourbon, Decatur, and Royal. But first, I take a quick look
at some of the noteworthy shops found elsewhere in the Quarter.
 Animal Art (617 Chartres St.; % 504-529-4407) is for animal lovers
because it features fine furniture, paintings, ceramics, and more, all
depicting its namesake.
 Chi-Wa-Wa Ga-Ga (37 French Market Place; % 504-581-4242) is the
small store for small dogs, offering off-the-rack clothes, costumes,
and accessories for your (or your friend’s) well-dressed pooch.
 Faulkner House Books (624 Pirates Alley; % 504-524-2940) is 
a national literary landmark as it was once the home of Nobel
Prize–winner William Faulkner, who wrote his early works Mosquitoes
and Soldiers’ Pay here. The one room (and hallway) of this private
home may be small in comparison to chain bookstores, but it boasts
Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 239

possibly the finest selection per square foot of any bookstore on the
planet. The stock tends to be highly collectible and literary, includ-
ing a large collection of first-edition Faulkners and rare and first-
edition classics by other authors. Roof leaks did cause some damage
to the owners’ living quarters above the shop, but everything has
since been repaired.
 Kaboom (901 Barracks St.; % 504-529-5780) is a used-book store
that primarily stocks fiction, but with a little digging, you can turn
up some real gems.
 Latin’s Hand (1025 N. Peters St.; % 504-529-5254) features ham-
mocks, dresses, jackets, sandals, and leather goods, all imported
from places such as Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Bolivia, and
Mexico.
 Tower Records (408 N. Peters St.; % 504-529-4411) is part of the
well-known national chain, but this location distinguishes itself
with an extensive collection of local and regional music.
Bourbon Street
If you’re looking for silly slogan T-shirts or the usual trinkets and sou-
venirs, check out Bourbon Street. Of course, most of the stuff is of the
“My Grandma Went to Bourbon Street and All I Got Was This Stupid 
T-Shirt” variety, and if you’re seen buying that kind of stuff, forget about
trying to blend in: You’ve just slapped the scarlet “T” (for tourist) on
your shirt, and it ain’t coming off. (On the plus side, it’s one of the few
places in the world you can window-shop while carrying a large plastic
cup full of booze.)
If you’re looking for something a little different, Marie Laveau’s House of
Voodoo (739 Bourbon St., % 504-581-3751), a popular attraction in the
French Quarter, is a good place to find a voodoo doll (though hopefully
you don’t need one). The resident psychic and palm reader can give you
a reading as well.
Canal Street
Longtime fans of and visitors to New Orleans may remember when Canal
Street was the place to shop. With the return of the Canal Streetcar, look
for increased commercial ventures, shops, and restaurants along the
route. For now, The Shops at Canal Place, located at the foot of Canal
Street (365 Canal St.; % 504-522-9200 or 504-581-5400), represents the
extent of the Canal Street shopping experience — but it’s a plush one,
with polished marble floors, a landscaped atrium, fountains, and pools.
A small fire after Katrina — which was highly suspicious because there
was no electricity or gas at the time — postponed its reopening, but reno-
vations were completed fairly quickly. This mall features more than 
50 shops. It’s open Monday to Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
Thursday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
7 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.

French Quarter Shopping
Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 241

Decatur Street
One of the French Quarter’s main drags, Decatur Street runs along the
river and gets a lot of foot traffic. Although the main attraction is the Jax
Brewery (which I mention more in depth in the “Checking Out the Big
Names” section, earlier in this chapter), you also find a number of
worthwhile shops for serious collectors and enthusiasts. Among the
best are the following:
 Beckham’s Bookshop (228 Decatur St.; % 504-522-9875) is a real
treasure trove for book and music lovers alike, with two levels of
old editions, rare secondhand books, and thousands of classical
LPs. You may get lost wandering the musty, Byzantine aisles.
 Body Hangings (835 Decatur St.; % 800-574-1823 or 504-524-9856),
in case you’re wondering, refers to cloaks, which are this store’s
specialty. A selection of capes and scarves is also available.
 The Little Toy Shoppe (900 Decatur St.; % 504-522-6588) presents
strikingly beautiful dolls as well as wooden toys from Germany,
stuffed animals, tea sets, and miniature cars and trucks.
 Louisiana Music Factory (210 Decatur St.; % 504-586-1094; www.
louisianamusicfactory.com) offers a large selection of regional
music, including Cajun, zydeco, R&B, jazz, blues, and gospel. The
Factory also sells reference books, posters, and T-shirts, and occa-
sionally provides live in-store performances and beer bashes. More
than just a record store, it’s an integral part of the city’s music com-
munity and local musicians need your support more than ever. If
you can’t make it to the clubs to hear them live, then please pick up
a CD or two here.
 Rock and Roll Records & Collectibles (1214 Decatur St.; % 504-
561-5683), despite its name, has a lot more than just rock-and-roll
on sale. The owners claim to have the biggest and best collection of
vinyl anywhere, and that includes 45s and 78s. Indeed, the collec-
tion even takes up floor space. There’s no telling what you can find
here.
Royal Street
Along Royal Street you can find many fine-art galleries and shops selling
antiques, jewelry, perfume, and candy as well as shops for coin and
stamp collectors.
First, check out these general-interest sites:
 The Bottom of the Cup Tearoom (732 Royal St.; % 504-523-1204)
is supposedly the oldest tearoom in the United States. You can
have someone read your tarot cards or tea leaves or build your
astrological chart; you can also get a reading from “pure clairvoy-
ant psychics.” I can’t vouch for their accuracy, but they’re sure a
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
242

lot cheaper than those 1-900 psychic lines. The store offers books,
jewelry, crystal balls, tarot cards, crystals, and healing wands.
 Importicos (736 Royal St.; % 504-523-3100) features an interna-
tional selection of hand-crafted silver jewelry; pottery; textiles;
leather, wood, stone, and metal items; and teak, mahogany, and
wrought-iron furniture.
 Le Petit Soldier Shop (528 Royal St.; % 504-523-7741), as its name
implies, sells miniature soldiers made by local artists. Armies rep-
resent a span from ancient Greece up to Desert Storm, and you can
find quite a few miniatures that resemble major figures in military
history, such as Eisenhower, Grant, Lee, Hitler, and Napoleon. Also
available is a good-size collection of medals and decorations.
For antiques, check out these places:
 Diane Genre Oriental Art and Antiques (431 Royal St.; % 504-595-
8945) is a nice change of pace if you’ve looked at too many European
antiques. It offers East Asian porcelains, 18th-century Japanese
woodblock prints, and Chinese and Japanese textiles, scrolls,
screens, engravings, and lacquers.
 Kiel’s Antiques (325 Royal St.; % 504-522-4552) was established in
1899 and is still a family business. It houses a considerable collec-
tion of 18th- and 19th-century French and English furniture, chande-
liers, jewelry, and other items.
 Manheim Galleries (403@nd409 Royal St.; % 504-568-1901) show-
cases a huge collection of Continental, English, and Oriental fur-
nishings, along with porcelain, jade, silver, and fine paintings.
 Rothschild’s Antiques (241 and 321 Royal St.; % 504-523-5816 or
504-523-2281) isn’t only an antiques store but also a full-service jew-
eler. Look for antique and custom-made jewelry among the more
standard offerings of antique silver, marble mantels, porcelain, and
English and French furnishings.
 Sigle’s Antiques & Metalcraft (935 Royal St.; % 504-522-7647) is
the place if you’re a big fan of the lacy ironwork that distinguishes
French Quarter balconies. Sigle’s offers some of its antique iron-
work already converted into more-packable household items such
as planters.
If you’re in the mood for fine art, visit these galleries:
 A Gallery for Fine Photography (241 Chartres St.; % 504-568-
1313; www.agallery.com) offers rare photographs and books from
the 19th and 20th centuries, with an emphasis on New Orleans and
Southern history and contemporary culture. The owner calls it “the
only museum in the world that’s for sale”; I agree.
Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 243

 Bergen Galleries (730 Royal St.; % 800-621-6179 or 504-523-7882;
www.bergenputmangallery.com) boasts the South’s largest 
selection of posters and prints. It also specializes in New Orleans,
Louisiana Cajun, and African-American fine art. The service here is
extremely personable.
 Bryant Galleries (316 Royal St.; % 800-844-1994 or 504-525-5584;
www.bryantgalleries.com) represents a number of American
and European artists. Look for glasswork, graphic art, and bronzes
depicting jazz themes. The staff is quite friendly here.
 Rodrigue Studios (721 Royal St.; % 504-581-4244) features the
famous Blue Dog by Cajun artist George Rodrigue, who began paint-
ing blue portraits of his late dog for a children’s book in 1984. Now
his work has achieved international renown, hanging in galleries in
Munich and Yokohama. Take a trip here to see this canine pop icon
in home territory. Rodrigue created special prints featuring the
Blue Dog to raise funds for charities helping New Orleans come
back. So far, he has raised nearly $500,000. Go to www.bluedog
relief.com to see the unique prints and order online if you can’t
make it to the gallery.
Warehouse District
Julia Street, from Camp Street down to the river and along some of its
side streets, is your best bet for contemporary art galleries in New
Orleans (an area known as the Arts District). Of course, some of the
works are a bit pricey, but collectors can get some good deals and
casual viewers can take in lots of fine art. While on Julia Street be sure 
to check out these places:
 Ariodante Contemporary Craft Gallery (535 Julia St.; % 504-524-
3233) features hand-crafted furniture, glass, ceramics, jewelry, and
decorative accessories.
 Arthur Roger Gallery (432 Julia St.; % 504-522-1999) has played 
a large role in nurturing the local art community and developing 
ties to the New York art scene. This beautiful gallery represents a
number of prominent artists such as John Waters and local artist
Robert Gordy. Roger says his gallery spaces were spared during
Katrina, but several artists’ studios were flooded. “But I can tell you
that every artist who was displaced has emphatically stated to me
that they are coming back to New Orleans,” Roger says. “Every artist
who is already in New Orleans is staying here. Our singular commu-
nity of artists will remain intact and their spirit is still vital.” The
gallery’s Project Space is in the Arts District at 730 Tchoupitoulas St.
 LeMieux Galleries (332 Julia St.; % 504-522-5988) showcases the
work of local and regional craftspeople as well as contemporary
artists from Louisiana and the Gulf Coast.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
244

 Marguerite Oestreicher Fine Arts (726 Julia St.; % 504-581-9253)
has consistently been a showcase for emerging artists, with a focus
on contemporary painting, sculpture, and photography.
Magazine Street, Garden District, and Uptown
Running from Canal Street to Audubon Park, Magazine Street offers 
6 miles of almost 150 shops: some in 19th-century brick storefronts,
others in quaint, cottage-like buildings. Overall, it’s a very unique, funky
stretch; the 5400 and 5500 blocks (between Jefferson Avenue and Joseph
Street) are my favorite stretch. Because it’s a less ritzy area of the city,
you can usually find some bargains here. Look for antiques, art galleries,
boutiques, crafts, fashion, and custom-designed furniture. Looting was 
a huge problem in the weeks after Katrina, forcing some businesses to
remain closed for a much longer period of time or causing the owners 
to wonder if they wanted to return at all.
I’m not pointing a finger at any of the antiques dealers or shops here, but
in general, it helps to be discerning when looking at antiques. You never
know; someone may have passed off an everyday household item as a
priceless family heirloom. As the song says, you better shop around.
Some places ask entirely too much money for their wares when a little
digging can find you something very similar at a much more reasonable
price.
Following are some noteworthy shops on Magazine Street, from art gal-
leries to antiques stores and more, which were doing fine as of press
time:
 Aidan Gill for Men (2026 Magazine St.; % 504-587-9090) carries
everything to maintain a man’s good looks, from handmade shaving
gear to luxurious creams and soaps as well as timeless fashion
accessories. Owner Aidan Gill and his staff also provide hairstyling
and old-fashioned hot-towel shaves.
 Audubon Antiques (2025 Magazine St.; % 504-581-5704) stocks
everything from curios to authentic antique treasures spread out
over two floors.
 Beaucoup Books (3951 Magazine St.; % 504-895-2663) is another
popular independent bookseller with a strong emphasis on local
and regional reference books plus a children’s room. After more
than 20 years in the same location, the rent was raised and the
store moved further down Magazine. It’s better than ever. Ask
owner Mary Price Dunbar for her picks.
 Cameron Jones (2127 Magazine St.; % 504-524-3119) is a surprise
respite from heavy old antiques, with its eclectic, contemporary
collection of home accent pieces, furniture, custom-designed rugs,
original art works, unusual lighting fixtures, and soothing wall 
fountains.
Chapter 13: Shopping the Local Stores 245

 Charbonnet & Charbonnet, Inc. (2728 Magazine St.; % 504-891-
9948) is the place to go for country pine; theyhave beautiful English
and Irish pieces on display, and custom furnishings are also built on
site.
 Garden District Book Shop (2727 Prytania St.; % 504-895-2266) is
a popular independent bookstore beloved by local fans. Anne Rice
has used it as a starting point for a number of her book-signing
tours; the store usually keeps a number of signed Rice books on
hand. However, you can find much more.
 George Herget Books (3109 Magazine St.; % 504-891-5595) has
more than 20,000 rare and used books on any subject you can 
think of.
 House of Lounge (2044 Magazine St.; % 504-671-8300) offers a
sexy, sophisticated collection of designer lingerie and loungewear
for women and smoking jackets and more for men. Erin Brockovich
couldn’t resist spending hundreds of dollars when she stopped by.
 Magazine Arcade Antiques (3017 Magazine St.; % 504-895-5451)
carries an excellent selection of 18th- and 19th-century furnishings
as well as music boxes, dollhouse miniatures, porcelain, antique
toys, and a host of other treasures. Budget a fair amount of time for
this place.
 Magic Box (5508 Magazine St.; % 504-899-0117) is a treasure trove
of toys for kids of all ages.
 Maple Street Book Shop (7523 Maple St.; % 504-866-4916) is quin-
tessentially New Orleans, from its curled and yellowed photo murals
to its shotgun home. Founded by her mother more than 40 years
ago, daughter Rhoda Faust carries on Maple Street’s promise to
“Fight the Stupids!” The Walker Percy and Ellen Gilchrist collections
are literary eye candy.
 Martin Wine Cellar (3500 Magazine St.; % 504-899-7411) carries
an expansive selection of wines, spirits, and champagnes for un-
expectedly reasonable prices. Also on hand are preserves, coffees,
teas, crackers, biscotti, cookies, and cheeses. There is no deli but 
it does offer gourmet take-out. Note that the original store at 3827
Baronne Street was damaged in flooding, and it’s not clear if they’ll
eventually return or stay on Magazine Street.
 Mignon Faget (3801 Magazine St.; % 504-891-2005) features fine
jewelry designed by local artist Mignon Faget, whose muses are
nature and Louisiana motifs. (I adore the sterling-silver Creole
Cottage Key Ring and the unique Red Bean Tie Tack.) Her gallery
also offers home accessories, signature fragrances, stationery, baby
clothing, and more.
 Mimi (5500 Magazine St.; % 504-269-6464) is an upscale women’s
boutique (in a marvelously restored Arts and Crafts brick building)
featuring clothing and accessories designed by Donna Karan,
Michael Kors, and other fashion trendsetters.

 Mushroom Rock and Roll Records (1037 Broadway St.; % 504-866-
6065), located on Fraternity Row in the university area in the heart
of Uptown, is a hip little place that is good for alternative music. As
if that weren’t enough, frugal students enjoy the comprehensive
collection of used CDs (though they’re not arranged in any particu-
lar order, so happy digging) and a large selection of T-shirts and
other paraphernalia.
 New Orleans Cypress Works (3105 Magazine St.; % 504-891-0001)
designs custom furniture using antique cypress and heart of pine.
 New Orleans Glassworks and Printmaking Studio (727 Magazine
St.; % 504-529-7277) displays blown-glass sculptures, lampwork-
ing, bronze pours, printmaking, and bookbinding. The heart of the
activity here is a state-of-the-art, 800-pound furnace. Visitors can
commission glass, hand-bound books, or prints, as well as watch
daily demonstrations of glassblowing, glass painting, metal sculp-
ture, and other arts.
 Octavia Books (513 Octavia St.; % 504-899-READ). Husband-and-
wife proprietors Tom Lowenburg and Judith Lafitte handpick books
of regional and national interest stocked in a spacious, modern set-
ting complete with outdoor patio and waterfall. Their renovation of
a 100-year-old former grocery earned them Best of New Orleans
Architecture honors from New Orleans Magazine and a Golden
Hammer award from the City of New Orleans.
 Scriptura (5423 Magazine St.; % 504-897-5555) carries a unique
assortment of paper products from around the world, including fine
stationery, leather journals, and greeting cards plus writing instru-
ments and custom wax seals.
 At Shadyside Pottery (3823 Magazine St.; % 504-897-1710) you
can witness the creation of raku, a particular type of pottery that
has a cracked look.
 Thomas Mann Gallery (1804 Magazine St.; % 504-581-2113) fea-
tures “techno-romantic” jewelry designer Thomas Mann, who
claims a lot of the credit for bringing contemporary jewelry and
sculpture to New Orleans. This store/gallery seeks to “redefine con-
temporary living” via its eclectic collection of jewelry, lighting, and
home furnishings.
 Uptown Costume & Dancewear (4326 Magazine St.; % 504-895-
7969) is the place to go for spooky monster masks, hats, wigs,
makeup, and all kinds of mischievous mask wear.
 Utopia (3953 Magazine St.; % 504-899-8488) also lost its lease
(prior to the storm) and now shares a cozy double with former
neighbor Beaucou Books. It has a unique collection of contempo-
rary clothing, jewelry, accessories, and gifts as well as playful, fun
furniture designed by David Marsh.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
248

 Westgate — The Original Necrotorium (5219 Magazine St.; % 504-
899-3077; www.westgatenecromantic.com) celebrates the inner
Goth, a one-stop shop for death-related items including “necroman-
tic” art and jewelry (featuring plenty of skeletons and other death
images). The book section offers related titles. Although some
people may find the artwork disturbing, open-minded visitors with
a healthy dose of curiosity will appreciate its unique offerings.
 Wilkerson Row (3137 Magazine St.; % 504-899-3311) is an award-
winning furniture shop whose custom designs are influenced by
19th-century New Orleans architecture.

Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Spending one, three, or five days in New Orleans
 Enjoying New Orleans with the kids
A
lthough I give a lot of lip service to exploring New Orleans on your
own, the truth is, you do need some structure. However, that doesn’t
preclude fun. This chapter presents suggestions on what to do if your
time is limited or if you’re bringing your family.
New Orleans in One Day
If you’re only in New Orleans for one day, spend the whole day in the
French Quarter (see Chapters 3, 9, and 14). As much as I stress through-
out this book that New Orleans is more than this historic district, I’d
never advise you not to take in the Quarter’s sights. It is the single most
popular attraction in the city for good reason, with a lot of culture, his-
tory, and lore in its small (6 blocks wide by 13 blocks long) confines.
To get into the spirit of the city, take your time getting started in the
morning with a visit to Café du Monde (see Chapter 11) for beignets
(fried doughnuts covered in powdered sugar) washed down with a café
au lait. After lingering for a bit at Café du Monde, begin the day’s touring
with a 30- to 60-minute stop at historic Jackson Square (see Chapter 12).
While in the neighborhood, check out the Cabildo and the Presbytere
(see Chapter 12), allowing roughly an hour for each. Then wander over to
the St. Louis Cathedral, on the north side of the square at 721 Chartres
(see Chapter 12), for a short 15-minute go-through. Afterward, pop in at
Faulkner House Books (see Chapter 13) for a little bit of literary history
and maybe to buy a rare first-edition hardback or two. You may also want
to gander at the beautifully restored Beauregard-Keyes House (see
Chapter 12) at 1113 Chartres St.; allow about 45 minutes to one hour.

New Orleans in One Day
Chapter 14: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 251
Chapter 14: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options

Right about now, you may realize that all you had for breakfast was the
rough equivalent of three very sugary donuts. My suggestion is to forego
an actual sit-down restaurant and roll some sightseeing into your lunch.
Stroll down to Decatur Street and sample a muffuletta (one of New
Orleans’s premier sandwiches) at Central Grocery (see Chapter 11).
Take your sandwich across the street, wander along the Moonwalk (see
Chapter 12), and eat by the banks of the Mississippi.
After lunch, a little walking helps the digestive process. Wind your way
up Ursulines to the Old Ursuline Convent and tour the oldest surviving
building in the Mississippi Valley (see Chapter 12). Allow about an hour
before wandering over to the Beauregard-Keyes House across the
street; plan to spend about 45 minutes to an hour at this literary land-
mark (see Chapter 12).
Next, walk westward down Royal Street, checking out the shops and 
galleries along the way (see Chapter 13). Save enough energy for the
insightful exhibits on New Orleans history at the Historic New Orleans
Collection (see Chapter 12) for a nice overview.
Steel yourself for a predinner stroll down Bourbon Street. Stop in at
Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop and Bar (Chapters 12 and 17) for a drink, and
darned if you won’t absorb some more history in the process. To con-
tinue the historical theme, you can hang out at the Old Absinthe House
(Chapters 12 and 17), sipping an anisette, and imagine what it must have
been like back in the days of Andrew Jackson and Jean Lafitte.
For dinner, only one place is worth considering if you only have one day
in town. If its has reopened, please make a reservation at Commander’s
Palace (see Chapter 11), widely considered one of the best restaurants
in the United States. Visiting celebrities regularly stop to relax in the lux-
urious dining rooms (all decorated in New Orleans flair). The restaurant
is a bit pricey, but the pampering, food, and luxurious surroundings are
well worth the cost. If it still remains closed at the time of your visit,
Upperline (see Chapter 11) offers fine Creole food, an eclectic art collec-
tion and the most congenial hostess-proprietor in the city.
Make a pit stop at your hotel to recharge your batteries because you
haven’t had the complete New Orleans experience until you’ve heard
some music. Start out in the Quarter, first heading to Preservation Hall
(see Chapter 16), if it has finally reopened, for authentic, traditional jazz.
Then head back to Bourbon Street, which by now should be in full
swing.
New Orleans in Three Days
For day one of this itinerary, see the preceding section to get the most
out of the famous French Quarter. Start day two by adhering to my New
Orleans Golden Rule: Get out of the Quarter!
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
252

If you’re staying in the French Quarter, have breakfast at the breezy and
friendly Clover Grill (see Chapter 11). From there, head down to Decatur
Street for a glimpse of the Mississippi River and to look for souvenirs at
Jax Brewery (see Chapter 13). Allow about an hour to an hour and a half.
Next, cross Canal Street and head into the Warehouse District (see Chap-
ter 9), specifically toward Julia Street, a bustling corridor of art galleries
(see Chapter 13). If you prefer to eat a late breakfast, stop in at Mother’s
(see Chapter 11) for your fill of good diner food.
From there make your way by streetcar, auto, or other propulsive means
(not by foot) to the Garden District (see Chapter 9). You can take a walk-
ing tour (see Chapter 12) or stroll around on your own to admire the
stately elegance of the gorgeous manses, especially those along St.
Charles Avenue and Prytania Street. Closer to the river, along Magazine
Street, the elegance gives way to a loose and funky vibe. Here you find
smaller shotguns and cottages (see Chapter 3), and more art galleries
and antiques shops (see Chapter 13). Allow at least two hours to explore
the district.
For lunch, Uptown offers several great options. I recommend Franky &
Johnny’s (just off Magazine at Arabella Street; see Chapter 11) for filling
sandwiches and New Orleans staples. Afterward, take a cab to City Park
(see Chapter 12) and spend a little time enjoying its tranquil charms.
While you’re there, you simply must wander the halls of the New Orleans
Museum of Art and reflect on its marvelous Besthoff Sculpture Garden
(see Chapter 12). Allow two to three hours for the park, museum, and
garden.
If you’re feeling hungry, cross the bridge at Bayou St. John to Esplanade
Avenue and grab a snack and caffeine at Fair Grinds Coffee House (see
Chapter 11). Take a cab from the park along grand old Esplanade Avenue
and gaze at the funky neighborhood that’s home to the Fair Grounds
Race Course. Esplanade takes you right up to the border of the French
Quarter.
After a little downtime at your hotel — or additional French Quarter tour-
ing for the truly hearty — treat yourself to a quintessential (and fairly
cheap) French Quarter dining experience slurping down raw oysters at
Acme Oyster House (see Chapter 11). If seafood isn’t your thing, head 
to the Quarter’s edge and grab a burger at Port of Call (see Chapter 11).
Either way, you dine relatively cheaply and rub elbows with some down-
to-earth locals.
Now, get ready for some music. Digest and unwind with a drink at a local
watering hole. I recommend Molly’s at the Market (see Chapter 17), a
homey hangout that won me over with its charming atmosphere and
friendliness. Next, hop across Esplanade to Frenchmen Street (see
Chapter 17) for a whirlwind tour of jazz, funk, and world music. You can
easily spend an evening at just one of these clubs, but I recommend that

256
Streetcar highlights
Taking the St. Charles Streetcar (or bus in case you visit while it’s closed, through late
2007)? Watch for these sights along the way. (For a map of the streetcar route, see
Chapter 9.) When traveling from the French Quarter through the Garden District toward
Audubon Park, note that odd-numbered addresses are on the right, even-numbered
addresses on the left.
 After passing Julia and St. Joseph streets, you go around Lee Circle. That’s
General Robert E. Lee atop the massive column. Note that he’s facing north so that
his back won’t be to the Yankees. The statue was erected in 1884.
 At 2040 St. Charles is La Tour Eiffel. If it looks like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, that’s
because it actually was a part of the tower, built in Paris as an upper-level restau-
rant and then moved to New Orleans and reassembled in 1936.
 The Columns Hotel (1883), located at 3811 St. Charles, was the location of a
Storyville bordello in the movie Pretty Baby.
 Does the Palmer House at 5705 St. Charles look familiar? If you’ve seen Gone With
the Wind, it should, It’s a replica of Tara.
 Audubon Park (extending all the way from St. Charles to the Mississippi River)
was the site of the 1884 World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition. The
renowned Audubon Zoo is on the far side of the park.
 After passing Tulane University and the old St. Mary’s Dominican College (now
Loyola’s Broadway campus), you enter what used to be the town of Carrollton,
named for General William Carroll, a commander at the Battle of New Orleans.
Carrollton was founded in 1833 and incorporated in 1845. New Orleans annexed
the city in 1874.
 After the streetcar turns right onto Carondelet, look ahead and a little to the left.
The tall building with the cupola at 325 Carondelet is the Hibernia Bank Building
(1921), the tallest building in the city until 1962. The cupola is lit at night in colors
that change with the seasons.
Taking the Canal Streetcar? (For a map of the streetcar route, see Chapter 9.) New
Orleans’s former main street was undergoing a well-received revival but severe flood-
ing did a lot of damage to this up-and-coming corridor. Keep an eye out for:
 Block-Keller House (3620 Canal St.), a magnificently restored classical-revival villa
now serving as a B&B. Hosts Bryan Block and Jeff Keller repaired flood damage,
but currently have it on the market, so let’s hope that the buyer continues their
success.
 City Park, the New Orleans Museum of Art, and the Besthoff Sculpture Garden at
the end of the Carrollton spur.
 The former upscale brothel at 4332 Canal St. infamously busted by the FBI.
 The Cypress Grove and Greenwood cemeteries at the end of the line (no pun
intended).

you stroll from place to place. After a couple hours, head over to Fritzel’s
European Jazz Pub (Chapter 16) to catch a late-night jam session before
collapsing into bed.
After using day two to sample the city’s charms beyond the French
Quarter (though you’ve really only scratched the surface), treat day
three as a reward, indulging in some of the more touristy but no less
entertaining sights, including the hedonistic pleasures of a breakfast at
Brennan’s (see Chapter 11). Allow about an hour to savor the experi-
ence. From there, head over to Riverwalk Marketplace (Chapter 13) to
finish up any last-minute shopping, followed by a tour of the amazing
Aquarium of the Americas (Chapter 12). Allow one to two hours to take
it all in (closer to two to include a film at the IMAX Theater).
Next, if the streetcar is running, take it to the world-renowned Audubon
Zoo (see Chapter 14). If your plentiful Brennan’s breakfast has begun to
wear off, grab lunch (or at least a snack) at the zoo or across Magazine
Street at the Audubon Golf Clubhouse. Allow about two hours. Next,
travel back to the French Quarter by riverboat or — assuming it’s liter-
ally back on track — by the St. Charles Streetcar (see Chapter 14),
which provides a scenic glimpse of the city’s grandest boulevard. (See
the sidebar “Streetcar highlights” in this chapter for a list of sights to see
along the way.)
Return to your hotel to rest up for another signature New Orleans dining
experience — dinner at Antoine’s (see Chapter 11). After dinner, take 
a leisurely last stroll through the Quarter, making sure to stop at Pat
O’Brien’s (see Chapter 17), where the expansive courtyard, complete
with flaming fountain, is touristy but cool in a kitschy way. Then wind
your way to the Rampart Street border of the Quarter, where you can
finish the night with some eclectic New Orleans music — and more than
a little atmosphere — at Donna’s Bar and Grill (Chapter 15).
New Orleans in Five Days
If you’re in town for more than three days, see the preceding section to
get the most out of your first three days. For day four of this itinerary
get out of the city completely. I recommend you choose from one of the
day-trip suggestions in Chapter 15.
If you like regional music, start driving to Lafayette and make a day of
touring Atchafalaya Basin, shopping at Acadian Village, and a night of
Cajun dining and dancing at Randol’s Restaurant and Cajun Dance Hall.
If you’re too tired to drive back to the city, check in at the 1820s Bois des
Chenes Inn, a former cattle and sugar cane plantation, for a good night’s
sleep.
Chapter 14: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 257

If you like the outdoors, head south to Lafitte. Spend the morning at
Barataria Preserve followed by lunch at Restaurant des Familles in
nearby Crown Point or an English tea at Victoria Inn & Gardens. Then
spend the afternoon communing with alligators on a swamp tour, cour-
tesy of L’il Cajun Swamp Tours, before dining at Voleo’s. Again, if you’re
too tired to return to the city, stay overnight at Victoria Inn & Gardens. If
you like to fish, you’re welcome to fish off the pier or ask hosts Roy and
Dale Ross if they can set up a fishing charter for you with Captain Phil
Robichaux. Prepare to get up super early the next day to catch some
reds (tasty red fish) and maybe a crab or two.
For day five, you have your pick of lovely plantation homes along River
Road. My personal favorites are Laura, for including the slave community
in its tours and maintaining the slave cabins (instead of having destroyed
them as some plantations did) and its resurrection after a devastating 
fire in 2004; Oak Alley, for its beautiful oak-lined avenue and fantasy of
Southern plantation living; and the 54,000-square-foot Nottoway, known
locally as the White Castle for its formidable presence. Along the way you
can feast on fresh seafood at B & C Seafood Market & Cajun Deli (about
a mile from Laura). For details on the establishments I recommend visit-
ing on days four and five, see Chapter 15.
New Orleans for Families with Kids
If you have young ones, you might want to steer clear of devastated
areas. Whereas teenagers might be fascinated by seeing history in the
making as flooded areas rebuild. Happily, more than enough diversions
are available that appeal to grown-ups and little ones alike.
On day one, start with a breakfast at Café du Monde (see Chapter 11) 
followed by a brief walk through the French Quarter, taking in Jackson
Square (see Chapter 12) and maybe a historic home or two. But spend the
majority of the morning enjoying the many delights of the Aquarium of
the Americas (see Chapter 12), allowing one to two hours before a brief
lunch either on-site or at one of many nearby restaurants. After lunch, if
it’s running, take the St. Charles Streetcar (or bus) to the Audubon Zoo
(see Chapter 12), where you can while away the afternoon (allow at least
two hours) ooh-ing and aah-ing the wildlife on display. Again, if it’s run-
ning, take the St. Charles Streetcar (or bus; see Chapter 9) to wind your
way back toward downtown, disembarking near Lee Circle, the Quarter a
short hop away by cab. Grab a bite at Café Maspero (see Chapter 11) and
retire to your hotel to rest up for the next day. If you or the kids get rest-
less, a carriage ride (see Chapter 9) is a pleasant way to enjoy the sights
of the French Quarter.
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
258

On day two, after breakfast at Mother’s or Clover Grill, a cheerful gay-
friendly establishment (see Chapter 12), take the Canal Street Ferry (it’s
free, and departs from the foot of Canal Street every quarter hour; a
pedestrian-only commuter boat also runs at 15-minute intervals) to
Blaine Kern’s Mardi Gras World (see Chapter 12), where you’ll spend
the morning (about two hours round-trip) looking at floats-in-progress
and finding out some interesting tidbits about Carnival. Afterward, the
ferry takes you back to the Quarter (it costs a dollar this way), where
you can do a bit more walking around, taking in the Moonwalk and 
the Mississippi and perhaps even the open-air French Market (see
Chapter 12). Take your time, but budget about 20 minutes to have a
quintessential New Orleans lunch courtesy of Central Grocery (see
Chapter 11) before taking the Canal Streetcar to City Park (see Chap-
ter 12). Here you can enjoy the New Orleans Museum of Art, the
Besthoff Sculpture Garden, and if it has reopened, the park’s Carousel
Gardens (see Chapter 12), allowing about two and a half to four hours,
depending on your stamina, before hopping a cab back to your hotel 
and dinner at Remoulade (309 Bourbon St., % 504-523-0377), a kid- 
and budget-friendly cousin to the legendary Arnaud’s (see Chapter 11).
Squeeze in a bit more strolling in the evening, but be sure to rest up for
the following day.
Day three starts with a leisurely jazz brunch at Court of Two Sisters
(see Chapter 11) before stopping by the Presbytere (see Chapter 12), 
if it’s open again, for an entertaining look at Mardi Gras memorabilia.
Then take a short hop to the Warehouse District for the fun, interactive
exhibits at the Louisiana Children’s Museum (see Chapter 12). Allow
about an hour at each museum.
Follow it up with some shopping and a quick lunch at Jax Brewery (see
Chapter 13) or the Riverwalk Marketplace (see Chapter 13) if you went
to the Children’s Museum. In the past, I recommended a fun-filled after-
noon at Six Flags New Orleans (see Chapter 12) or a jaunt out to the
Louisiana Nature Center and Planetarium (see Chapter 12), but both 
of these locations were devastated by storm surge. Six Flags is perma-
nently closed but I am optimistic about the fate of the nature center.
After days of super rich local food, go easy on dinner and walk off some
of those calories, enjoying one last look at the French Quarter by night,
perhaps enjoying a final, lingering gaze out over the Mississippi by
Washington Artillery Park (see Chapter 12). Then take time for sou-
venir packing and sleep before heading back home.

Chapter 15
Going Beyond New
Orleans: Three Daytrips
In This Chapter
 Spending a day in Cajun Country
 Taking a sightseeing tour of remarkable plantation homes
 Getting back to nature — without driving all day to do it
You could probably spend your next three or four vacations in the
Crescent City and still not get to everything on your list. But some-
times you just need to get away from urban life. So gas up the car, get
out your maps, and hit the road.
Daytrip No. 1: Discovering Cajun Country
This daytrip takes you to Lafayette, the heart of Cajun Country, where
you discover this unique region’s food, culture, and music.
The Lafayette Parish Convention and Visitors Commission (P.O. Box
52066, Lafayette, LA 70505, % 800-346-1958 in the United States, 800-
543-5340 in Canada, or 337-232-3737; fax: 337-232-0161; www.lafayette
travel.com) can give you the scoop on all Lafayette has to offer. If you
plan to come out this way, call for a brochure. They may even persuade
you to extend your stay.
Creoles, zydeco (popular music of southern Louisiana combining tunes
of French origin with elements of Caribbean music and the blues and
that features guitar, washboard, and accordion) musicians, and non-
Cajun residents don’t much care for the “Cajun Country” label. Also,
many citizens of Acadian descent aren’t too wild about it either, espe-
cially in large urban centers such as Lafayette. Although the people here
are proud of their heritage, some of them bristle at the rather touristy
simplification of the term. If you drive through Lafayette, you can find
that it’s a city like any other. You don’t have to abandon your car and
paddle through dense swamp to get to a hotel or restaurant, nor do you
encounter fiddle-playing Deliverance extras on every street corner and
front porch.

Getting to Lafayette
Lafayette (167 miles — give or take a few — west of New Orleans) is a
straight shot from New Orleans on Interstate 10. Drive in mid- to late
morning so that you don’t get caught in rush-hour traffic in Baton Rouge
or Lafayette — or New Orleans, for that matter. After Katrina, traffic in
the Greater New Orleans area has increased dreadfully as people who
scattered outside New Orleans are now coming back full- or part-time.
Try to be patient and listen to www.wwoz.org if the pace slows down.
Taking a tour of Cajun Country
The New Orleans area offers some authentic swamp tours, but the
Atchafalaya Basin holds the distinction of being the third-largest swamp
in the United States. A boat tour is a great way to experience this mysti-
cal region. Angelle’s Atchafalaya Basin Swamp Tours (see map p. 264;
Whiskey River Landing, P.O. Box 111, Cecilia, LA 70521; % 337-228-8567,
www.angelleswhiskeyriver.com) operates tours in glass-bottomed
boats or smaller, open boats. To get to the swamp from I-10, take Exit 115
to Henderson, go through Henderson to the levee, and turn right. The
landing is the fourth exit on the left. Fares are $12 for adults, $10 for sen-
iors (55 and up), and $6 for children. Departures are at 10 a.m., 1 p.m.,
and 3 p.m. daily (weather permitting).
Seeing the sights of Cajun Country
The sights in this daytrip wet your feet in the bayous of the Cajun expe-
rience. What’s a bayou, exactly? Coming from the Choctaw word mean-
ing “small stream,” a bayou is a sluggish offshoot of a lake or river that
flows through swampland — and an integral part of swampland culture.
Acadian Village
Acadian Village is a reconstructed (actually, reassembled) Cajun bayou
community in which houses have been transported from their original
location to this site beside a sleepy bayou. If you’re the exploring type,
take the footpath and venture along the bayou’s banks. Peek inside the
Chapter 15: Going Beyond New Orleans: Three Daytrips 263
Where in the world is Cajun Country?
Cajuns are the descendants of Acadians, settlers who were forced out of their estab-
lished colony in Nova Scotia in the mid–18th century. Arriving in the French colony of
Louisiana, they found themselves in relative isolation, farming in the low-lying wet-
lands and developing their own distinct culture. To experience some true Cajun cul-
ture, you need to drive two to three hours from New Orleans to Lafayette. There, you
can find the food, music, and lifestyle that developed as the Acadians mingled with
their neighbors and became an integral part of Louisiana life and lore.

Once the center of a 3,000-acre cattle and sugar cane plantation, this plan-
tation home is now a small but lovely bed-and-breakfast. With only five
accommodations — two suites in the main plantation home and three
rooms in the carriage house — each room has been lovingly restored and
furnished with Louisiana French antiques. Room rates include not only a
Louisiana-style breakfast but a bottle of wine and a tour of the house as

well. Also available are nature and bird-watching trips into Atchafalaya
Swamp, as well as guided fishing and hunting trips. These adventures are
conducted by the inn’s owner, a retired geologist.

Where to dine in Cajun Country
Although all these restaurants have their merits — and very strong ones
at that — if you have time for only one, I recommend Prejean’s.
Café Vermilionville
$$–$$$
Want atmosphere? Café Vermilionville is located in a meticulously restored
Acadian cypress house dating back to 1799. With plenty of fresh seafood
on the menu, specialties include Creole bronze shrimp and the unique
Louisiana Crawfish Madness, which is crawfish tails prepared according
to the chef’s mood: au gratin, étouffée, fried, or in crawfish beignets (oh
yes, crawfish beignets).

Prejean’s
$–$$
While in the heart of Cajun Country, treat yourself to a night at Prejean’s,
the spot for nouvelle Cajun cooking. Although it gives the appearance of
being simply another family restaurant, the bill of fare reveals this place to
be one of the finest restaurants in Acadiana, with some of the best ingre-
dients and recipes you’ll find in Cajun cuisine. Highlights include crawfish
enchiladas, crawfish étouffée, grilled or fried oysters, gumbo, shrimp, and
alligator. Kids can dine on burgers or chicken fingers. Live Cajun music
plays nightly at 7 p.m.

with your cuisine. Randol’s serves up seafood fresh from the bayou, pre-
pared any way you want it: fried, steamed, blackened, or grilled. The house
specialty seafood platter guarantees to fill you up. It includes a cup of

Daytrip No. 2: Plantations along 
the Great River Road
Once the focal point of a self-sustaining community, plantation homes
flourished in Louisiana from the 1820s to the beginning of the Civil War.
Although dozens of grand, beautiful homes once dotted the landscape
(particularly around the Mississippi River because the homes were gen-
erally built near riverfronts), today the number has dwindled to a rela-
tive few. All were spared Katrina’s wrath, however, with less than half the
usual visitors, they are still struggling and need your support. This trip
meanders along the river between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, stop-
ping at a number of stately plantation homes along the way.
Getting to the plantations
This trip follows Interstate 10 west of New Orleans. Each plantation list-
ing includes driving times and directions. The plantations are listed in
the order in which they appear on the “Daytrip No. 2: Plantations along
the Great River Road” map, running north from New Orleans along the
Mississippi River. Keep in mind that the river winds a bit, so some dis-
tances may be deceiving.
Chapter 15: Going Beyond New Orleans: Three Daytrips 267
Passing a good time: Cajun Country nightlife
While in Lafayette, check out some of the local nightlife. A visit to El Sid-O’s (see map
p. 264; 1523 Martin Luther King Dr. in Lafayette), a hot spot for zydeco music, is an essen-
tial stop. The place is run by Sid Williams, whose brother Nathan is an acclaimed zydeco
musician and leader of the popular group Nathan and the Zydeco Cha-Chas. The decor
may not be very fancy, but that just adds to its appeal. A lot of zydeco history has gone
down between these walls. Call % 337-235-0647 to find out who’s playing.
Grant Street Dance Hall (see map p. 264; 113 W. Grant St. in Lafayette) is the place
where out-of-town rock bands are most apt to play when they pass through town
(unless they’re stadium-sized acts filling the nearby Cajundome). Local bands also call
this place home, from alternative-rock outfits to Cajun and brass bands. Call % 337-
237-8513 or visit www.grantstreetdancehall.com for information.

Taking a plantation tour
All plantations listed in this section offer guided tours. Most present
engaging historical details about the homes and their owners; I espe-
cially recommend you visit Laura and Destrehan Manor. Except where
otherwise noted, tours generally last between 30 to 45 minutes. Some
plantations schedule tours continuously (that is, a tour begins whenever
a group arrives asking for one) or every 15 minutes or so. The Oak Alley
and Houmas House tours begin on the half-hour. See the individual list-
ings for admission prices.
Seeing the sights
Houses are spread apart and individual visits can take some time —
seeing all the homes in a single day is unlikely. My advice is to pace
yourself and find out how far you get by midday (or even midmorning).
With a home or two under your belt, go through the list and concentrate
on the ones that appeal to you the most. If you only have time for two or
three, you can check out Laura, Oak Alley, and Madewood in one day at
a comfortable pace. Allow one to one and a half hours for each visit, two
and a half hours if you’re a serious enthusiast.
With the exception of Destrehan Manor, with an elevator to the second
floor, these plantation homes are rough going for those traveling in
wheelchairs.
Destrehan Manor
The oldest plantation open to the public in the Lower Mississippi Valley,
and the site of some of the largest live oaks in the country, Destrehan
Manor was built in 1787 by a free person of color and restored using some
of the earliest methods of construction. (In a nice touch, one room has
been deliberately spared the renovation process, allowing a glimpse of the
true ravages of age.) A cameo in the film Interview with a Vampire, along
with its proximity to New Orleans, has made this a popular attraction.
Guided tours start every 20 minutes.
See map p. 269. 13034 River Rd., Destrehan, LA 70047. % 985-764-9315. Fax 985-725-
1929. www.destrehanplantation.org. Located approximately 25 miles from
New Orleans. Take I-10 West to Exit 220 (I-310 South), stay on I-310 for about 6 miles,
exit onto River Road, and turn left at the light. Admission: $10 adults, $5 teenagers, $3
children 6–12; free for children under 6. Open: daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Houmas House Plantation & Gardens
The grand live oaks, magnolias, and formal gardens alone are worth the
trip. The structure is actually two houses joined together; the original was
built in 1790, and in 1840 a larger, Greek Revival–style house was built next
to it (some time in the intervening years, a roof was built over both, join-
ing them together). This bit of architectural jury-rigging adds to the
intrigue.

Chapter 15: Going Beyond New Orleans: Three Daytrips 269

See map p. 269. 40136 Highway 942 Burnside, LA 70725 (58 miles from New Orleans).
% 888-323-8314 or 225-473-7841. Fax: 225-474-0480. www.houmashouse.com. Take
I-10 from New Orleans or Baton Rouge, exit onto Highway 44 to Burnside, turn right
on Highway 942. Admission: $10 adults, $6 children 13–17, $3 children 6–12; free for
children under 6. Open: daily Feb–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m. and Nov–Jan 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Closed holidays.
Laura: A Creole Plantation
This is the belle of the ball, the one plantation home you should definitely
see and I nearly cried when I heard about the devastating fire in 2004 that
nearly burned it to the ground. It says something about the strength and
determination of the owners that Laura was open for tour the very next
day. Now they are restoring the original layout of the plantation, which is
being documented by the History Channel. You’ll find a refreshing, edu-
cational atmosphere rather than the touristy patronization you might get
from other homes. General manager Normal Marmillion and his outstand-
ing staff share what daily life on a sugar plantation was like for both the
masters and the slaves (a disappointingly rare insight on most plantation
tours) in the 18th and 19th centuries. This cultural history of Louisiana
Creoles is astoundingly detailed thanks to former occupant Laura Locoul’s
diary. The house is a brightly painted, classic Creole home — perhaps
plain compared to neighboring Oak Alley — sheltering more than 375 orig-
inal artifacts spanning a 200-year period in the lives of one family. Basic
tours last about an hour. If you want a longer tour, you can schedule in
advance a special 90-minute tour; topics include “Women on the Creole
Plantation” and “Plantation Slaves, Artisans, and Folklore.” The famous
Br’er Rabbit stories were first collected here by a folklorist in the 1870s. Be
sure to walk the grounds afterward to view the slave cabins, overseer cot-
tages, barns, and the 1829 Maison de Reprise.
See map p. 269. 2247 Highway 18, Vacherie, LA 70090. % 888-799-7690 or 225-265-
7690. www.lauraplantation.com. Located about 60 miles from New Orleans.
Take I-10 West about 28 miles from New Orleans to Exit 194 (Gramercy). Cross the
bridge and turn left onto Highway 18 (River Road); travel about 4 more miles.
Admission: $10 adults, $5 students and children 6–17; free for children under 6. Open:
daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Madewood
Another must-see stop on this route, Madewood is an imposing two-story
Greek Revival mansion with a bit of history behind it (surprise, surprise!).
The owner commissioned it solely for the purpose of outdoing his brother,
who had a grand house of his own. The construction took eight years,
including four just to cut the lumber and make the bricks. In a cruel twist
of fate, the owner died of yellow fever just before the house’s completion.
Current owner Keith Marshall’s parents bought and saved it from disrepair
in 1964, and photos of the laborious restoration process are a revelation.
Marshall and his wife, Millie Ball (travel editor for The Times-Picayune), are
gracious hosts who tell delightful stories. You can stay overnight, either in
the main house for $225, or in a more secluded raised cottage. (A bronze
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans

plaque notes that Brad Pitt slept here while filming Interview with the
Vampire.)
See map p. 269. 4250 Highway 308, Napoleonville, LA 70390. % 800-375-7151 or
985-369-7151. Fax: 985-369-9848. www.madewood.com. Located approximately 72
miles from New Orleans. Take I-10 West from New Orleans to Exit 182
(Donaldsonville). Cross the Sunshine Bridge onto Highway 70; follow it to Spur 70.
Follow signs that say “Bayou Plantations,” turn left onto Highway 308, and then travel
south about 6 miles. Admission: $8 adults, $4 children and students. Open: daily 
10 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed holidays.
Nottoway Plantation
The last stop on this tour is a comparative stone’s throw (about 25 miles)
from Baton Rouge. The house has a formidable presence, with 22 enormous
columns and its original slate roof. Sixty-four rooms cover more than 54,000
square feet, including a grand ballroom, beautiful archways, and original
crystal chandeliers. It was saved from Civil War destruction by a Northern
gunboat officer who had once been a guest here. You can have lunch or
dinner in the restaurant, and stay overnight in one of the restored bed-
rooms for between $125 and $250 a night. The rate includes a full plantation
breakfast, a wake-up tray of muffins, juice, and coffee, and a house tour.
See map p. 269. 30970 Mississippi River Rd. (P.O. Box 160), White Castle, LA 70788.
% 866-LASOUTH or 225-545-2730. Fax: 225-545-8632. www.nottoway.com.
Located 69 miles from New Orleans. From New Orleans, follow I-10 West to the
Highway 22 exit, and then turn left on Highway 70 across Sunshine Bridge; exit onto
Highway 1 and drive 14 miles north through Donaldsonville. From Baton Rouge, take
I-10 West to the Plaquemine exit and then Highway 1 south for 18 miles. Admission:
$10 adults, $4 children 5 to 12; free for children under 5. Open: daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Last
tour begins at 4:30 p.m. Closed Dec 25.
Oak Alley Plantation
Originally named Bon Sejour, the most popular plantation home in
Louisiana gets its current name from a quarter-mile alleyway of live oaks.
Along with Laura and Madewood, this is the best bet for those wishing to
abridge this trip into a “best of” tour, offering exactly what the word “plan-
tation” conjures up. A nonprofit foundation runs the place, and authenti-
cally costumed guides lead tours. The mansion has been lovingly restored,
though its furnishings range from antiques to modern. You can stay the
night (it also serves as a bed-and-breakfast), with rates from $105 to $135.
On-site is a restaurant open for breakfast and lunch.
See map p. 269. 3645 Highway 18, Vacherie, LA 70090. % 800-44-ALLEY or 225-265-
2151. Fax: 225-265-7035. www.oakalleyplantation.com. Located 60 miles from
New Orleans. Take I-10 West to Exit 194 (Gramercy). Turn left on Highway 641 (South),
and follow the highway, which turns into Highway 3213. Continue over the Veteran’s
Memorial Bridge. Turn left onto Highway 18 and drive 71⁄2 miles to the plantation.
Admission: $10 adults, $5 students, $3 children 6–12; free for children under 6. No
credit cards accepted. Open: daily Mar–Oct 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m. and Nov–Feb 9 a.m.–
5 p.m. Closed in the a.m. on New Year’s Day (call for details), Thanksgiving, Christmas.
Chapter 15: Going Beyond New Orleans: Three Daytrips 271

San Francisco Plantation
This fanciful home’s broad galleries resemble a ship’s double decks, and
atop two sets of stairs is a broad main portal much like a steamboat’s
grand salon. English and French 18th-century furniture and paintings are
featured as part of the restoration. The contrast between the plantation
and its neighbor, a huge oil refinery practically in its backyard, is a bit jar-
ring but oddly enough adds some poignant perspective on how much the
times have changed.
See map p. 269. 2646 Highway 44 (P.O. 950), Garyville, LA 70051. % 888-322-1756 or
985-535-2341. Fax: 985-535-5450. www.sanfranciscoplantation.org. Located
approximately 35 miles from New Orleans. Take I-10 West to U.S. 51 (23 miles). Turn
south and continue for 3 miles to Highway 44 and then go west for 5 miles. Admission:
$10 adults, $5 students 13–18, $3 children 6–12; free for children under 6. Open: daily
9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed major holidays and Mardi Gras.
Where to stay and dine
For accommodations at a plantation, see the preceding listings for Oak
Alley Plantation, Madewood, and Nottoway Plantation.
For dining, see the preceding listings for Oak Alley Plantation (lunch) and
Nottoway Plantation (lunch and dinner). Two noteworthy eateries near
Houmas House are The Cabin (see map p. 269; 5405 Hwy. 44 at the inter-
section of Highway 22, in Burnside, approximately 3 miles from Houmas
House; % 225-473-3007; www.thecabinrestaurant.com) and Hymel’s
(see map p. 269; 8740 Hwy. 44 in Convent, approximately 8 miles south of
Burnside; % 225-562-7031). Near Laura and Oak Alley, I like the family
operation B & C Seafood Market & Cajun Deli (see map p. 269; 2155
Hwy. 18 in Vacherie, about 1 mile from Laura; % 225-265-8356).
Daytrip No. 3: New Orleans Nature Getaway
This trip takes you a world away from the other experiences in this book
and gets you back to New Orleans in time for an evening out. Grab break-
fast at one of your favorite local morning spots before driving across 
the Mississippi River on the Crescent City Connection to the West Bank.
Spend the morning at Barataria Preserve followed by lunch at Restaurant
des Familles in nearby Crown Point or an English tea at Victoria Inn &
Gardens in Lafitte. Then spend the afternoon communing with alligators
on a swamp tour before dining at Voleo’s. This area fared well during hur-
ricane Katrina, however, it was completely flooded by storm surge from
hurricane Rita a few weeks later. At a recent visit, I was so relieved to see
that everything was dry and coming back. The locals are nothing if not
determined to preserve their unique way of life and share it with you.
Getting back to nature
In New Orleans, get on Interstate 10 East heading toward the Mississippi
River and the West Bank. (Yes, it’s the West Bank, though it’s directly
Part IV: Exploring New Orleans 
272

east of New Orleans. Go figure.) Cross the Crescent City Connection;
after you’re over it becomes the West Bank Expressway, an elevated
thoroughfare that connects a good deal of the West Bank. Go to Exit 4B,
Barataria Boulevard, and get off, turning left at the second stoplight onto
Barataria Boulevard. Then drive about 9 miles to Barataria Preserve.
Taking a swamp tour
Lil’ Cajun Swamp and Shrimping Tours (see map p. 274; Hwy. 301, just
outside Jean Lafitte National Park, next to Frank’s Boat Launch; % 800-
725-3213 or 504-689-3213; www.lilcajunswamptours.com) are led by
Captain Cyrus Blanchard, one character of a tour guide who isn’t afraid
to give his opinion on anything. (Be sure to ask about his pet alligator,
Julie.) His tour includes Bayou Barataria and is roughly two hours long.
Admission is $17 adults, $15 seniors, $13 children 4 to 12, and free for
children under 4. Tour times are 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. The boat is wheel-
chair accessible, but the bathrooms aren’t.
Seeing the sights
The Barataria Preserve is a branch of the Jean Lafitte National
Historical Park and Preserve, which encompasses several locations
around the state. The preserve sprawls over approximately 20,000 acres
of hardwood forest, cypress swampland, and freshwater marshlands,
with 8 miles of hiking trails (including 21⁄2 miles of boardwalk) and water-
ways, preserving a representative sample of the environment of the
delta, including bayous, swamps, marshes, and natural levee forests.
The wildlife preserve was once home to prehistoric human settlements
(archaeologists have unearthed village sites along the bayous dating
back some 2,000 years). The trails and waterways make it a natural spot
for hiking and exploration, and for getting some perspective on the peo-
ples who settled this area, which was a delta formed by the Mississippi
River some 2,500 years ago. You can easily lose yourself here, either
taking a “natural history walk,” striking out on your own along the path-
ways, or exploring the 9 miles of canoe trails (closed to motorized boats
and accessible by three canoe launch docks; see canoe rental informa-
tion later in this section), as well as 20 miles of waterways accessible to
all types of craft. Picnic tables are scattered throughout, and fishing
(with a valid Louisiana fishing license) and hunting and trapping (by
permit only) are allowed; the marshes are dotted with recreational hunt-
ing and fishing camps. Hunting permits and fishing licenses can be pur-
chased online at www.wlf.state.la.us or at a nearby marina — the
closest is 2 miles away at Cochiara’s Marina, 4477 Jean Lafitte Blvd. in
Lafitte, % 504-689-3701. Note: Bring mosquito repellent!
Head to the Visitor Center (see map p. 274; 6488 Barataria Blvd. in

from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (during daylight savings hours) and 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(standard time), and the visitor center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(closed on Christmas Day). No admission fee is required, though dona-
tions are welcome. The visitor center, restrooms, and the Bayou Coquille

Boulevard (before you get to the Lafitte/LaRose Highway, which you 
cross on your way to Restaurant des Familles). The last time I canoed the
bayou, I accidentally bopped an alligator on its head with my paddle (they
sleep just below the surface). The adventure continued when a heavy
thunderstorm (complete with lightning bolts) hit just after the halfway
point. Scary stuff, but it was still a refreshing change of pace from the city.
Rentals must be returned by dark at either location.
Where to dine
For lunch, select from seafood, Cajun, or Creole dishes (I can’t resist the
spicy shrimp balls) while overlooking a picturesque bayou at Restaurant
des Familles (see map p. 274; 7163 Barataria Blvd. in Crown Point; % 504-
689-7834). The restaurant is open Tuesday through Saturday for lunch
and dinner (as well as Sun for brunch).
Alternatively, treat yourself to a feast for all the senses with an afternoon
tea and garden tour at Victoria Inn & Gardens (see map p. 274; 4707
Jean Lafitte Blvd. in Lafitte; % 800-689-4797 or 504-689-4757; www.
victoriainn.com). The inn flooded badly from Rita’s storm surge,
ruining the garden-level rooms which are now being restored. All of the
lovely gardens had to be replanted, so it’s a little sparse. But thanks to
the sub-tropical climate, it will become lush again in no time. The unique
pool in the center of a “reverse-P” pier over the lake is fine, however, the
pier was twisted by the storm, giving it a funhouse mirror look. You can
still walk on it and take a dip in the pool. The teas — specially blended
for the inn — are served in delicate, antique china cups with a mouth-
watering assortment of tea breads, scones, finger sandwiches, and
sweets. I recommend you sit on the gallery overlooking the Shakespeare
Herb Garden, which is filling in nicely and is also where my husband and
I got married eight years ago. Tea is served daily from 2 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
Reservations are required; $18 per person (garden tours are free).
Dinner is available Wednesday through Sunday from 6–9:30 p.m. at The
Restaurant at Victoria Inn, featuring Creole cuisine by candlelight. For
me, it’s always a toss-up between the pan-seared redfish and filet mignon
topped with crawfish. Be sure to save room for dessert!
You may like what you see during the tour — that lakeside pool is as
refreshing as it looks — and decide to stay. Hosts Roy and Dale Ross see
to your every need, whether its reserving a saltwater fishing excursion
Chapter 15: Going Beyond New Orleans: Three Daytrips 275

with Captain Phil Robichaux (% 504-689-2006) or giving you frank rec-
ommendations on local attractions. Single rooms cost $98, doubles and
queens $115, luxury suites with Jacuzzi from $145. Well-behaved dogs
are welcome; call ahead for details.
For dinner, go to Voleo’s (see map p. 274; 5134 Nunez St. in Lafitte; 
% 504-689-2482), where former Paul Prudhomme apprentice David
Volion presides over award-winning Cajun, Creole, and German dishes 
at cheap bayou prices. It took on three feet of water during Rita and
reopened in October. This is one of my favorite places to eat in all of
Greater New Orleans. Try the sinfully rich seafood gumbo or signature
flounder Lafitte and you’ll taste why.

Living It Up After
Dark: New Orleans
Nightlife

In this part . . . 
N
ew Orleans after dark is nothing like New Orleans during
the day. The experience is completely different — with
its own landmarks, history, and etiquette. Chapter 16 delves
into the local theater and performing arts scenes, while
Chapter 17 focuses on the city’s best clubs and bars, whether
you want the quickie tourist experience or something more
authentic. Chapter 17 also ferrets out the best spots for real-
deal Cajun and zydeco music.

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter

 Finding out what’s playing and where to get tickets
 Getting the lowdown on the New Orleans theater scene
 Making the New Orleans opera, ballet, and orchestra scenes
T
he performing arts likely aren’t the first thing you think of when
coming to New Orleans. After all, in terms of size, scale, and impor-
tance, the scene here is a far cry from, say, New York City’s. No one
comes to New Orleans on vacation with the express purpose of seeing
the ballet or some edgy, off-Broadway fare. What New Orleans is known
for is its food, music, and rich history (in no particular order). But you
can make a strong argument in favor of its performing arts taking a
respectable fourth place.
Assessing Katrina’s Effect 
on the City’s Cultural Life
Historically, New Orleans has enjoyed status as a small but thriving
center for the performing arts; at one time, it boasted what was the con-
tinent’s first opera house. The city hasn’t seen the likes of that heady
heyday in decades, but the theater and performing arts thrive in a city
as creative and multicultural as this one. Needless to say, with fewer visi-
tors and locals strapped for cash, the city’s theaters and other perform-
ing arts venues and organizations — and the actors and musicians who
play there — are not doing as well as they should. So please, take in a
show and help them get back in the spotlight.

Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
The Times-Picayune (in its weekly Lagniappe entertainment section)
and Gambit Weekly are good places to look for listings, reviews, and pre-
views of major arts events. If you’re looking for information before you
arrive, try their Web sites: www.nola.com and www.bestofneworleans.
com, respectively. Another good source is the local CitySearch site
(http://neworleans.citysearch.com).
New Orleans doesn’t have a local ticket broker such as New York’s TKTS.
Tickets to most local productions are easily available through the
venue’s box office, and most of the larger spaces (such as the Saenger,
the Orpheum, and the Contemporary Arts Center) take credit cards;
they also usually offer tickets via Ticketmaster (% 504-522-5555).
Smaller theaters accept cash only (though Southern Rep and NORD
accept local checks) at the door the night of the show. For a popular
event, such as an opera production or a Broadway touring company,
reserve in advance, or ask your hotel concierge (assuming your hotel
has one) to find out about acquiring tickets for you.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
Do you have a free evening and want to take in a show, catch the sym-
phony, or enjoy an opera? If so, the following section can give you all 
the details.
Theater
New Orleans actually boasts a good theater scene, a tight community
that makes up in passion, creativity, and quality what it lacks in size.
Though no heir apparent to Tennessee Williams is waiting in the wings
to usher the city into a glorious new age, theater in New Orleans is much
more than touring companies of national productions and amateur
dinner theater (though you find plenty of both). New Orleans boasts a
handful of inventive local companies staging intriguing original works or
creative reinterpretations of classics (and usually drawing pretty good
crowds). Of course, tried-and-true standby fare such as The Fantasticks
is always being produced somewhere, by someone, at any time.
So what’s hot right now? As you would expect, national tours of big-
name productions are always popular. Whenever you come, the Saenger
Theatre on Canal Street will most likely offer that season’s hot ticket,
whether it be Proof or The Producers. Local classics, such as anything
written by Williams, are a good bet.
Without further ado, the following lists the more prominent theater
spaces in the city:
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New Orleans Nightlife 
280

 One of the city’s major hubs for the arts, Contemporary Arts Center
(900 Camp St. in the Warehouse District; % 504-528-3800; www.
cacno.org) reopened in January 2006 and features exhibits of con-
temporary art (of course). It also hosts some small productions in its
intimate performance spaces, most recently related to Katrina. You
find experimental works by local playwrights as well as the occa-
sional comedy and musical (concerts, dance productions, and film
screenings also take place here). The rooms are small enough that
no seat is really bad. Food and drink are also on the premises via the
Cyber Bar & Cafe. The CAC itself has no dress code, though the pro-
moters/producers of specific shows or events may impose one.
 le chat noir (715 St. Charles Ave. in the Central Business District;
% 504-581-5812; www.cabaretlechatnoir.com) is one of the
hippest, hottest spots in the city. The intimate (135-seat) space
lends itself to give-and-take exchanges between audience and per-
formers. Typical fare may include a one-woman (or -man) show of
the life and songs of French chanteuse Edith Piaf, a performance art
piece with audience participation, or a set by a singer or local jazz
band. Stick around after the show; the piano bar on Saturday nights
has been compared favorably to the edgy, unpredictable vibe of
Parisian cabaret. Attire is semiformal. Come a little early to social-
ize and sip a Black Cat at Bar Noir, open Tuesday through Saturday
from 7 p.m., (about one hour before showtime).
 The show must go on! Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre (616 St.
Peter St. in the French Quarter; % 504-522-2081) fared well during
Katrina and is home to one of the oldest nonprofessional theater
troupes in the United States and will proudly present its 90th season
in 2006-2007. The main performance stage, open from September to
June, generally presents well-chosen plays and musicals. A smaller
performance space sports edgier, experimental fare from local writ-
ers. Supposedly, a ghost named Caroline haunts the attic; she is
believed to be an actress who, in 1927 while cavorting with the
director, fell off the third-story balcony overlooking the flagstone
courtyard and died. Theatre employees claim that if they can’t find
something, they simply ask Caroline and 15 minutes later, the item
mysteriously appears.
 NORD Theater (705 Lafayette St. in Gallier Hall, one block from
Poydras Street in the Central Business District; % 504-565-7860), 
a long-running arm of the New Orleans Recreation Department, is
primarily a vehicle for local children, though the productions and
target audience aren’t limited to children. It did fine during Katrina,
staying high and dry. The summer production is usually kid-
oriented, while the fall one is a better bet for adults. The theater
stages four productions a year, mostly musicals — Broadway, off-
Broadway, or original. This comfortable, intimate theater (seating
capacity is 120) has plenty of legroom, and no dress code.
 The venerable Saenger Theatre (143 N. Rampart St; % 504-525-
1052; www.saengertheatre.com) opened in 1927, and is listed on
Chapter 16: Applauding the Cultural Scene 281

the National Register of Historic Places. Due to significant damage
from Katrina — including loss of the historic organ console to flood
and major roof damage — the theater postponed its 2006-2007
season. Upon its return, join locals in the audience for touring the-
ater productions (some are Best Musical Tony Award winners) and
popular performances by everyone from David Bowie to Neil Young
and comedians like The Daily Show’s Lewis Black.
 Southern Rep Theatre (The Shops at Canal Place; % 504-522-6545;
www.southernrep.com) stayed high and dry during Katrina. The
popular theater focuses on Southern playwrights and actors, and
benefits from a convenient location on the lip of the Quarter at
Canal Street; plenty of validated parking is in the shopping center’s
spacious, multilevel garage. The pace slows down in summer, but it
does have children’s programs. Performance space is intimate, but
comfortable, as befits its high-rise digs; the atmosphere (and dress
code) is casual.
 Zeitgeist Multi-Disciplinary Arts Center (1724 Oretha Castle Haley
Blvd.; % 504-525-2767; www.zeitgeistinc.net), which comple-
ments the Contemporary Arts Center, celebrates its 20th anniversary
in November 2006. The bill of fare is left of center all the way, from
performance art to edgy original plays and independent films —
everything from Andy Warhol to Leni Riefenstahl to original works 
on growing up gay in New Orleans.
In keeping with its casual vibe, New Orleans is pretty lax about dress
codes. Exceptions exist, of course, but generally you can get by with a
basic business-casual look. At le chat noir, which aspires to a hip atmos-
phere where dressing up is half the fun, a semiformal approach is
required. But after that, it’s fair game.
Symphony
Most people, including the locals, often overlook the Louisiana
Philharmonic Orchestra (% 504-523-6530; www.lpomusic.com) in
favor of the city’s hopping bar and club scene. It’s a shame because the
LPO is a delightful way to spend an evening. Music lovers around the
world offered donations and support to help this vital cultural organiza-
tion stay intact and new music director Carlos Miguel Prieto infuses the
symphony with new blood. The season runs from September through
May.
Opera
The New Orleans Opera Association (% 800-881-4459 or 504-529-2278;
www.neworleansopera.org) has been around since 1943, providing
local opera buffs with a steady diet of classic performances each season.
The company is talented and professional; this isn’t the local amateur
hour. Often, the association features a star performer from, say, the
Metropolitan Opera Company, with local talents in supporting roles. The
fare runs from familiar classics to new, edgy works.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New Orleans Nightlife 
282

Dance
The Delta Festival Ballet is comprised primarily of area talent that per-
forms a seasonal schedule, including a popular annual production of
The Nutcracker at Christmastime. Call % 504-836-7166 for perform-
ance calendar, ticket prices, and other information. The New Orleans
Ballet Association, despite its name, isn’t a local company. Instead, it
presents a schedule of touring shows. The season generally runs from
September to June. Tickets are available through Ticketmaster (%
504-522-5555) or through the Association box office (% 504-522-0996).
Chapter 16: Applauding the Cultural Scene 283
Dining before (and after) the show
You’ll have no trouble making an evening of dining and theater in New Orleans. If you’re
lucky, you can find a restaurant that matches the mood and feel of the play, musical,
or piece you’re going to see. A playbill for a touring show at the Saenger Theatre, for
example, will likely include ads placed by the Palace Café (see Chapter 11) and
Dominique’s (in the Maison Dupuy hotel, 1001 Toulouse St.; % 504-522-8800). If you
want to mingle, head to the Sazerac bar in the Fairmont Hotel (see Chapter 17) to see
and be seen by some of the city’s elite. These establishments are a fine start (or finish)
to an evening at the elegant Saenger.
On your way to or from Southern Rep, a host of French Quarter choices are nearby,
although I prefer the bistro elegance of Mr. B’s Bistro (see Chapter 11), which should
be open by the end of 2006. If you’re looking for something more casual, try an over-
stuffed oyster po’ boy at Acme Oyster House (see Chapter 11). For a performance at
Le Petit, the nearby The Bistro at Maison de Ville is a favorite of theater patrons and
performers; the elegant Court of Two Sisters is also a good spot (see Chapter 11 for
both). To satisfy your post-theater munchies, head down St. Peter to Dumaine and plop
yourself down at the Clover Grill, the “happiest grill on earth” (see Chapter 11).
In the Central Business District, the family-friendly Bon Ton Café (401 Magazine St.;
% 504-524-3386) is the perfect complement to an evening at NORD Theater. Nothing
nearby mirrors the unique Parisian cabaret experience at le chat noir, though Mother’s
provides some amusing contrast (see Chapter 11). Closer in spirit, the Veranda (inside
the Hotel Inter-Continental, 444 St. Charles Ave.; % 504-585-4383) — whose extraor-
dinary glass-enclosed courtyard was destroyed by Katrina but is now completely
restored — and Palace Café (see Chapter 11) are a straight shot down St. Charles
Avenue.

Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Assessing post-Katrina nightlife
 Checking out French Quarter nightlife
 Finding the best bars and clubs elsewhere in the city
 Discovering a spot to suit your style, from hip hangouts to piano bars
T
hings have always been more laidback here, especially after dark,
when the city marches to the beat of a decidedly different drummer
than during the weekday 9-to-5 grind. And I don’t just mean the slinky,
greasy rhythms of funk and R&B or the stately clip of vintage jazz. I’m
talking about mood. The city grows livelier; for proof, you need walk no
farther than the nearest bar.
What makes for a cool bar? Smart alecks might say any bar that didn’t
flood. But really, it depends on who you ask. Some people want a nice,
dark watering hole, while others want a high-energy dance workout and
the chance to discreetly bump into an anonymous member of their pre-
ferred sex. This chapter explores all the nooks and crannies of New
Orleans’s bar scene. It stops in at some rowdy saloons, upscale bars,
dance clubs, and your regular hole-in-the-wall dives.
Keep in mind that the selections throughout this chapter aren’t all-
inclusive. Because New Orleans boasts more bars and music clubs per
capita than almost any other city in the United States, you’ll doubtless
find a host of other happening places on your own. For comprehensive
club and bar listings, go online prior to your arrival or pick up a free copy
of Gambit Weekly (see Chapter 4 or go to www.bestofneworleans.com)
or Offbeat magazine (see Appendix or go to www.offbeat.com) at your
hotel or nearby coffeehouse or retail store. Every Friday, the Times-
Picayune publishes Lagniappe, it’s pull-out entertainment section (see
Chapter 4).
If you’re here for Mardi Gras (see Chapters 7 and 12 for more informa-
tion), you may notice that after the last float rolls by, the party simply
relocates to another spot, such as a bar. Club owners usually book excit-
ing, party-friendly acts, even on Sunday and Monday nights when many
spots would otherwise be dark. If you base your dream image of New

Orleans on the constant street-party scenes you’ve seen in the movies,
Mardi Gras is your time.
Assessing Katrina’s Effect 
on the City’s Nightlife
Sadly, many musicians lived in Treme and the Lower Ninth Ward, which
were badly flooded by storm surge and broken levees. In addition to
losing their homes, they also lost their livelihood. One of my neighbors
in Lakeview is Benny Grunch, who leads the city’s most popular “Yat”
band, Benny Grunch & the Bunch (www.bennygrunch.com). (He came
to a party at my house celebrating my first New Orleans For Dummies
book, and people talked about it for weeks afterwards — a real live
celebrity showed up at Julia’s house!) Benny has famously stayed in the
city, but he lost his guitars, keyboard, master tapes, and CD inventory in
the storm and has had to rebound. Many other bands had to decide
whether to stay in the city, as many bars and clubs were closed for a few
weeks after the storm at best (and some are still shuttered). Bands that
lost members are now collaborating, and musicians often play with sev-
eral groups.
A few examples: Named after one of the liveliest clubs in the early days
of jazz (and for a tune made famous by legendary cornet player Buddy
Bolden), the Funky Butt (714 N. Rampart St.) closed for good, much to
everyone’s dismay. O’Flaherty’s Irish Channel Pub (514 Toulouse St.;
% 504-529-1317) was a popular pub, but severe damage to the structure
forced the owner to close for good and flee to Texas. The Saturn Bar
(3067 St. Claude Ave. in Bywater; % 504-949-7532) offered renegade
ambience and cheap drinks, with veteran barflies and slumming celebri-
ties drinking side by side. It was severely damaged by Katrina and then
owner O’Neil Broyard passed away, but his family say they are deter-
mined to come back.
Despite the generous financial support of music lovers around the
world, there is still concern that many musicians — including some
whose musical families have been around for generations — won’t come
back. Without its native musical sons and daughters, New Orleans would
not be New Orleans. So please, support our unique, homegrown music
by going to live shows, buying CDs and telling your friends about this
city’s unique soundtrack. 
Playing by the Rules
Some people may be disappointed to discover that the legal drinking age
in Louisiana is 21 — for years, it was 18. If you’re of drinking age, how-
ever, you’ll be delighted to know that you can legally walk along any
public street with a drink in your hand (though the drink must be in a
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 285

plastic cup, called a go- or geaux-cup). Drinking alcohol in a vehicle is ille-
gal, even if you’re just a passenger. So if you feel the need to imbibe
while getting somewhere, stick to the sidewalks.
Unless otherwise noted, most places listed in this chapter don’t usually
charge a cover (though all bets are off during Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest).
For locations of nightlife spots inside and outside the French Quarter,
refer to the maps later in this chapter.
Entering the Neon Party Zone: 
French Quarter Nightlife
Tourist nightlife centers around the French Quarter, as you may have
guessed. Keep in mind, however, that the key word here is “tourist.”
Tons of clubs are concentrated here, many solely to cater to the con-
stant influx of visitors (with some notable exceptions to this rule). Some
are cheap, some are tacky; many are both. Of course, you can find some
genuinely good haunts here as well. Where the French Quarter is con-
cerned, the epicenter of nightlife is Bourbon Street.
Drinking in Bourbon Street
Having just cautioned you against relying too much on the Quarter bar
scene, I don’t want to discourage you from stepping onto world-famous
Bourbon Street altogether. (My husband still shakes his head at my insis-
tence that his visiting parents walk at least one block of Bourbon, but I
felt it was important that when they returned to their Midwest home-
town, they could tell everyone that they had in fact experienced it.
That’s one of the first questions your family, friends, and coworkers 
will ask: Did you go to Bourbon Street? Imagine their reaction if you said
no! They may make you go back.) But if you stroll down Bourbon and
assume that you’ve experienced all that New Orleans nightlife has to
offer, well, you know what they say about people who assume . . . .
Sure, Bourbon Street is a tourist attraction, first and foremost. Like Beale
Street in Memphis, it became an attraction because of something genuine
and authentic, but almost all vestiges of that elusive something have been
replaced by glitter, glitz, and spectacle. Still, seedy as it can be, Bourbon
Street can also be a fun barrage of sights, sounds, and smells. And the fact
that it remains intact after Katrina is enough reason to take a walk down
this storied street. With every kind of music, from jazz, blues, and rock-
and-roll to rhythm and blues, country, Celtic, and Cajun, it’s not the qual-
ity so much as the sheer variety that’s important here.
Many Bourbon Street establishments are open 24 hours. Others open
late in the afternoon, when the area starts to come to life. After 8 p.m.
the street is blocked off to traffic, and the streets and sidewalks are filled
with people.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New Orleans Nightlife 
286

You may notice that St. Ann Street, about eight blocks off Canal, marks a
division on Bourbon Street — it’s the unofficial boundary between the
straight and gay sections of the area. Although not every bar or person
east of St. Ann is gay, and not every bar or person west is straight, you’ll
likely notice a marked difference in the feel of the areas.
Be careful when exploring: The farther you get away from the river or
the farther you go down Bourbon Street (away from Canal), the fewer
people will be around and the less safe the area becomes. If you must
explore more-deserted sections, keep alert. Ladies, don’t carry a purse if
you can help it.
Hitting the quarter notes: Some 
prime French Quarter spots
Locals widely consider the French Quarter to be one large tourist trap.
You need a scorecard to distinguish the authentic, character-filled spots,
which do exist, from the tourist magnets. Following is my subjective list,
all of which went through difficult stages of fewer bands and staff due to
fewer patrons but are now getting back to normal numbers:
 Check out the Funky Pirate (727 Bourbon St.; % 504-523-1960) for
a true Bourbon Street blues experience. One of the area’s biggest
(literally and figuratively) blues musicians, Big Al Carson, deals out
Chicago-style electric blues most nights. His schedule varies; call 
to find out when he’s playing. No cover, but expect a one-drink 
minimum.
 The Hideout (1207 Decatur St.; % 504-529-7119) can best be
described as a safe, friendly approximation of a hole-in-the-wall expe-
rience. The place used to house a pretty intimidating gay/biker bar,
but these days most everyone, from punks to tourists, is welcome.
 Johnny White’s Sports Bar (720 Bourbon St.; % 504-524-4909).
Like the sign says, this place never closes, even during the insanity
of Katrina, which is now a special (and rare) badge of pride for any
establishment. It might have been a regular ol’ bar before the hurri-
cane, but now it’s practically an historic landmark.
 Molly’s at the Market (1107 Decatur St.; % 504-525-5169) draws a
strange cross-section of locals. Something of a hangout for local
media types (especially on Thursday nights), the pub-crawling
legions make this a frequent stop as well. That includes Goth types
as well as bohemians in tie-dyes who look like they haven’t washed
in weeks, and even just regular Joes out for a drink.
 Ol’Toone’s Saloon (233 Decatur St.; % 504-529-3422) is a some-
what nondescript bar next to House of Blues on Decatur. A good
place to unwind after catching a show next door, it has a pretty
good vibe when it fills up. It attracts its fair share of characters and
is open 24 hours.

Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New Orleans Nightlife

Getting All Jazzed Up
New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. Some say the genre was born in the
brothels of old Storyville (New Orleans’s long-gone, but still-legendary,
red-light district), where the city’s innovative young musicians enter-
tained the clients, who in turn spread the word about this sexy new
music. “Just what is jazz?” you ask. As Louis Armstrong once said, “If you
got to ask what it is, you’ll never get to know.” By the time you’ve danced
your way through these clubs, you’ll no longer have to ask.
Preserving the strains of Dixieland jazz
Interested in hearing some old-school jazz? Head to one of these venues
for a memorable evening of traditional New Orleans jazz and support
America’s original contribution to world music.
 For jazz with a little different slant, try Fritzel’s European Jazz
Club (733 Bourbon St.; % 504-561-0432; www.fritzels.tripod.
com). Fritzel’s is known for late-night (or early-morning) jam ses-
sions. Musicians who have finished playing their sets at other jazz
clubs often come here to take turns running through old-time tradi-
tional jazz. An oasis among the sanitized jazz spots in the French
Quarter, this place boasts an agreeable German beer-house decor,
with a one-drink minimum per set instead of a cover charge. Come
here way after midnight, order a German beer, and watch some tal-
ented musicians compare notes. Children aren’t allowed. Music
starts at 9:30 p.m. and runs late.
 The sign outside Maison Bourbon (641 Bourbon St.; % 504-522-
8818) proclaims that the place is “Dedicated to the Preservation 
of Jazz,” which means that Dixieland jazz is the only item on the
musical menu. Despite being located on Bourbon Street, this isn’t 
a tourist trap. No children are allowed, so if you’re with kids and
want them to get a taste of some Dixieland, simply stand outside
the bar — you can hear and see everything just fine. Records and
CDs are available for purchase. Show times vary; it’s open from 
2:30 p.m. to 12:15 a.m. Monday through Thursday, and from 3:30 p.m.
to 1:15 a.m. Friday through Sunday. Though you won’t face a cover
charge, a one-drink minimum is enforced.
 The Palm Court Jazz Café (1204 Decatur St.; % 504-525-0200;
www.palmcourtjazz.com), like Preservation Hall, offers old-style
jazz played by old-style musicians — but the Palm Court also has
air conditioning, food (which can be a little pricey), and drinks. You
may want to make reservations. Music is played from 8 to 11 p.m.,
Wednesday through Sunday. Cover $5 per person at tables; no
cover at bar.
 Preservation Hall (726 St. Peter St.; % 800-785-5772 or 504-522-
2841; www.preservationhall.com) is run by a nonprofit group
dedicated to the preservation of jazz — and they continue to offer
music after preserving their building as well. They reopened in
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 289

April 2006 after extensive renovations. Shows start Thursday
through Saturday at 8:30 p.m. (doors at 8 p.m.), and usually end
around midnight, with 35-minute sets followed by 10-minute breaks.
The band makes requests if you make a decent offering, but try 
not to be the fifth person in a row to request “When the Saints Go
Marching In.” Keep in mind you’ll find minimal seating, no air condi-
tioning, and no food or drinks. Still, you’ll almost certainly enjoy
yourself, and the kids should love it, too. A selection of tapes and
CDs is for sale if you find you can’t get enough of the music. Sunday
afternoon shows start at 3:30 p.m. (doors at 3 p.m.). Cover $8.
In praise of contemporary jazz
If you have a taste for modern interpretations of jazz, try one of these
suggestions:
 Jazz Fest–quality music and food from the Brennan family (thanks
to the Red Fish Grill right next door) are the twin draws of the Jazz
Parlor (125 Bourbon St.; % 504-410-1000), formerly the ambitious
Storyville District. Jazz is the order of the day, obviously, and
despite the Parlor’s prime Bourbon Street real estate, it’s the real
deal, not watered-down tourist bait. Show times are generally 5,
7:30, and 11 p.m., with a one-drink minimum per person per set.
 In comparison with Preservation Hall and the Palm Court, Snug
Harbor (626 Frenchmen St.; % 504-949-0696; www.snugjazz.com)
is more in line with the times. Located in Faubourg Marigny, just out-
side the French Quarter, this is one of the prime spots for modern
jazz in the city. The place enjoys a very good reputation among local
musicians and fans. A show at this small, often-crowded spot is
shorthand for class. Drinks, sandwiches, and a full dinner service are
available. The cover charge varies according to the performer but is
usually between $8 and $20. Shows begin nightly at 9 and 11 p.m.
 The Spotted Cat Cocktail Lounge (623 Frenchmen St.; % 504-943-
3887) has been around for a couple years, but it didn’t become the
slinky hipster place it is now until live music became a regular fix-
ture. Now the sweaty vibe encourages you to quench your thirst
with the signature drink, a rum punch chocolate martini. No cover.
 Sweet Lorraine’s (1931 St. Claude Ave., % 504-945-9654, www.
sweetlorrainesjazzclub.com) aims to be a throwback to the
days when jazz clubs lined the streets. This establishment offers a
program of modern and traditional jazz. It’s not in the safest neigh-
borhood, and parking is a bit chancy, so take a cab. The cover varies
from $5 to $15. Show times vary but generally start at 10 p.m. and
midnight.

French Quarter Music
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 291

 Donna’s Bar & Grill (800 N. Rampart St.; % 504-596-6914) is
known as “Brass Band World Headquarters,” the only place in town
where you can reliably expect to hear brass-band music (picture a
cross between marching-band music and jazz) on a regular basis.
Only three blocks from Bourbon Street at North Rampart and St.
Ann, Donna’s has a funky hole-in-the-wall vibe that’s relaxed and
unpretentious. The crowds often follow bands onto the street for a
second-line parade. Because the neighborhood can be dicey, take 
a cab if you’re concerned about safety. Show times are 10 p.m.
Thursday through Monday (closed Tues and Wed). The average
cover is $5.
Imbibing History
These special spots offer a little bit of history with your liquor; rumor
has it that Andrew Jackson patronized one of them. (See Chapter 12 for
more on the history of each of these joints.)
 Dating from 1772, Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop (941 Bourbon St.; 
% 504-522-9377) is the oldest building in the Quarter and was
reportedly the headquarters of the notorious pirate Jean Lafitte.
Please try to overlook the poor plastering job on the exterior,
which was a very misguided attempt at preservation. Agreeably
dark (barely candlelit at night), all types of characters frequent the
popular hangout.
 Another dark and historic place that seems full of schemes — 
or maybe it’s just the low-key lighting — is the Napoleon House
(500 Chartres St.; % 504-524-9752). If you’re the imperial type,
have a drink and muse over what the place would’ve been like if
Napoleon had moved in here, as certain New Orleanians allegedly
hoped he would. Note: Bar closes at 6 p.m. but hopefully normal
evening hours will soon return.
 The Old Absinthe House (240 Bourbon St.; % 504-523-3181; www.
oldabsinthehouse.com) is supposed to be the place where Andrew
Jackson and the Lafitte brothers plotted their defense of the city 
in the Battle of New Orleans. William Makepeace Thackeray, Walt
Whitman, and Oscar Wilde are also said to have knocked back a few
inside these walls. This place is also said to have been a speakeasy
during Prohibition, though when it was closed down in the 1940s, its
antique fixtures — including the original marble-topped bar — were
regrettably removed.
Keeping Cool: The Hip Spots
The clientele of these spots gives off a certain aura of that indefinable,
elusive quality known as “cool.” As always, it can be a little difficult to
separate the trendsetters from the fashion followers, but they’re both
here:

 Café Brasil (2100 Chartres St.; % 504-949-0851) is the epicenter of
the Frenchmen Street scene in Faubourg Marigny; no telling what
you may find on any given night, including R&B, funk, and even
jazz. During Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest it becomes a whirlwind of
activity. The scene often spills out into the street (usually out of
sheer necessity when the crowd becomes too large for the dance
floor). Try to catch trumpeter Kermit Ruffins here as he has been
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 293
Nightly club highlights
Like clockwork, you can count on some legendary music acts (or just great music in
general) at certain venues on certain nights of the week. (You should still call to con-
firm, as schedules change.) For more specific events during your visit, see the
Lagniappe entertainment directory in the Times-Picayune each Friday or the music
calendar in Gambit Weekly every Tuesday.
Sunday: The popular Cajun “Fais Do Do” at Tipitina’s (see p. 299) usually starts at 
12:30 p.m. ($7 to $12).
Monday: Charmaine Neville and her band play jazz/pop cabaret at Snug Harbor (see
p. 290) at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. ($10 to $25). Bob French and Friends put on a smokin’ tra-
ditional jazz jam at Ray’s Boom Boom Room, 508 Frenchmen St. (% 504-523-5394), at
9 p.m. Donna’s (see p. 292) on Rampart is usually a great place to be on Monday night.
Tuesday: The funky, electrifying Rebirth Brass Band play to packed crowds at the
Maple Leaf Bar (see listing on p. 297 and box on p. 298), over near Tulane University,
at 10:30 p.m. ($5).
Wednesday: Legendary Walter Wolfman Washington & the Roadmasters play a blend
of funk, jazz, and soul at d.b.a. (see p. 296) on Frenchmen Street at 10 p.m. (free). Or try
live music at the Carousel Bar (see p. 304) at the Hotel Monteleone from 9 p.m. to mid-
night (free, through Saturday night). 
Thursday: Celebrity trumpeter Kermit Ruffins and the BBQ Swingers play Vaughn’s
(see p. 303) in the Bywater at 10:30 p.m. ($10). A popular zydeco stomp night at Mid
City Lanes Rock ’n’ Bowl (see p. 300) starts at 8:30 p.m. “Media night” at Molly’s at
the Market in the French Quarter (see p. 287) features local “celebrity bartenders”
and big crowds.
Friday: Try free salsa lessons with Freddy Omar and live Latin jazz at Café Brasil (see
below) at 9:30 p.m.
Saturday: “Bustout Burlesque!” night at Tipitina’s (see p. 299) features a comic emcee,
a jazz band, lots of sexy stripteases (supposedly recreations of old burlesque routines),
and more, starting at 10 p.m. ($15). At Mimi’s (2601 Royal St. at Franklin St. (% 504-
942-0690), DJ Soul Sister spins a “HUSTLE!” funk dance party (“with your behind in
mind”) that Spin magazine gives 4 stars, free, at 11 p.m.

extra hot post-Katrina. Cover ranges from $5 to $15 when music is
playing.
 The Circle Bar (1032 St. Charles Ave. at Lee Circle; % 504-588-2616)
is an enclave of hipness on the lip of the Warehouse District. It’s a
small, comfortable space, with easy bartenders and a clientele of
musicians, workers, and just plain characters. Music runs toward
singer-songwriters and local hard-to-define bands whose followings
make getting around difficult — as I said, it’s a tiny place, but an
important one as it is a much-needed gathering place for music
lovers.
 The Dungeon (738 Toulouse St.; % 504-523-5530) may seem more
imposing than it is, though it’s still more of a habitat for fringe char-
acters than college students or button-down tourists. It’s a narrow,
two-story hangout with an upstairs dance floor and all sorts of
“spooky” décor. A real late-late-night spot, it doesn’t open until mid-
night. Cover is around $3.
 d.b.a. (618 Frenchmen St.; % 504-942-3731; www.drinkgoodstuff.
com) is dedicated to the sale and consumption of quality beer and
liquor, as its Web site address makes clear. An offshoot of a popular
New York hangout, d.b.a. attracts a diverse mix of status-conscious
drinkers to the hot Frenchmen Street restaurant and bar scene. Its
spacious, dark wooden interior and extensive beer list are both invit-
ing and comforting. Although it’s fairly open, crowds can become
hard to navigate during prime weekend hours.
 El Matador (504 Esplanade Ave.; % 504-586-0790) sits right on
Esplanade Avenue at Decatur Street on the site of a former gay/drag
bar. Its tiny cabaret-style stage sometimes hosts rock bands. Part 
of almost every Quarter hipster’s nightly itinerary, rock stars and
local celebrities make their way here quite often. Cover is $5 to $15
when a live band plays.
 F&M Patio Bar (4841 Tchoupitoulas St.; % 504-895-6784) is a vener-
able institution among the college and young working-professional
sets. Late night is prime time here, with service-industry types,
sorority girls, and on-the-prowl yuppies chatting each other up over
a classic rock jukebox. Invariably, some sloshed individual will jump
up on the pool table and start dancing, more because it’s expected
than because it’s funny.
 The Sazerac Bar (in the Fairmont Hotel, 123 Baronne St.; % 504-
529-4733) is frequented by young professionals who come to mingle
in the very posh atmosphere. This place was featured in the movie
The Pelican Brief with Julia Roberts. Be sure to try its signature
cocktail for which the bar is named (ask the bartender to make it
from scratch and not a mix).
 The Whiskey Bar (201 St. Charles Ave. in the Central Business
District/Warehouse District area; % 504-566-7770) promises a New
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New Orleans Nightlife 
296

York–style lounge atmosphere, and the inhabitants delight in dress-
ing up — lots of jackets and short black dresses. The decor is dark
and stylish, and the black marble bathrooms are cool. The door-
men really give you the New York experience: they look you over
before deciding whether to admit you inside.
Hanging Loose: Casual Bars
In their own way, each of these places is fine for just milling around,
drinking, talking, and taking in the scenery:
 Le Bon Temps Roule (4801 Magazine St.; % 504-895-8117) lets the
good times roll by being all things to all people: a neighborhood
joint, a college hangout, and (on weekends) a popular music desti-
nation (thanks in no small part to the lack of a cover charge).
 Live Bait Bar and Grill (501 River Rd. in Jefferson; % 504-831-3070)
is exactly what it says it is — a bait shop and neighborhood bar
rolled into one. Bands (from locals to comeback-trail ’80s hard-rock
acts) regularly play in a large converted-garage area just off to the
side, and older regulars coexist peacefully with drunken college
types at the bar. It’s a loose, friendly place, even given the fleet of
Harleys and other motorcycles often found parked in the vicinity.
 The Maple Leaf (8316 Oak St.; % 504-866-9359) is what a New
Orleans club is all about. A small space, it features a hammered tin
ceiling, a patio out back, and a good bar. Its reputation is in inverse
proportion to its size; the place is almost always packed, with
crowds often spilling out into the street. If Beausoleil or the ReBirth
Brass Band is playing, you simply have to go. Owner Hank Staples
claims he hosted the first concert in New Orleans after Katrina, on
September 30, 2005 featuring Walter “Wolfman” Washington. Other
clubs and musicians say otherwise, but this concert did have the
largest audience and the most media for any show since the storm.
Shows usually begin around 10:30 p.m.; cover varies anywhere from
$5 to $20. See the “Tuesday night at the maple leaf” box in this 
section.
 The R Bar (1431 Royal St. in the Faubourg; % 504-948-7499) attracts
a mix of Marigny residents, bohemian types, local musicians, and
Frenchmen scene stragglers. This place has one of the best vibes 
in town: slightly sophisticated, but in a low-key, grungy way. The
atmosphere is an odd mish-mash of ’50s-style decor and stylish
neighborhood charm, with a pool table and a couch or two. Owner
Jonathan Ferrara got into a little tiff just before Carnival 2006 when
he announced that the Société de St. Anne parade would begin at his
bar. On the contrary, said the At. Anne krewe, who said the parade
has always started in the Bywater, and they deliberately changed
their route so as not to go past the bar. Just tells you how seriously
New Orleanians take Mardi Gras matters, even post-Katrina.
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 297

 The Rivershack Tavern (3449 River Rd. in Jefferson; % 504-834-
4938) is a popular drinking place for a diverse cross-section of
locals, from college students to bikers to medical professionals
(Ochsner Hospital is just down the road), among others. Located

Tuesday night at the Maple Leaf
The following is an excerpt from a column by Chris Rose that originally appeared in the
Times-Picayune on 9/25/06. For more on the Maple Leaf, see p. 297 and read about
the Rebirth Brass Band at www.rebirthbrassband.com. Read the full text of
this article at: http://www.nola.com/rose/t@@hyp/index.ssf?/rose/
katrina/rebirth_at_the_maple_leaf.html.
The Tuesday night Rebirth gig at the Maple Leaf has iconographic standing in the lore
of New Orleans nightlife, like the Thursday night zydeco stomp at Mid-City Lanes or the
Sunday afternoon fais do-do at Tip’s.
Something you can count on. No need to consult a schedule.
Long before Katrina, the Rebirth shows at Maple Leaf were where I’d drop in from time
to time to remind myself why I live here, why I love here. Why I am here.
For the uninitiated (and if that’s you, shouldn’t you ask yourself why?) the Rebirth Brass
Band is one of the veteran standard bearers of the New Orleans brass-band renaissance
and I realize that if you ask me what that means, well . . . I don’t know. What is New Orleans
brass-band music? Got me. Jazz, I guess, in its basic DNA. Layered with rock influences.
Smothered in hip-hop beat and attitude. All rolled together in a scary marching band.
It is an explosion of sound, just drums and horns — who needs anything else, really? —
and it is the sound of Mardi Gras, of second-lines, street parades and house parties.
Of New Orleans.
The Rebirth Tuesday night gigs have been colossal draws for years, crowded, sweaty,
throbbing, disorganized affairs packed with Tulane students, downtown hipsters, stiff-
collar types and soul brothers.
It is so energetic, so in the groove, so diverse and so perfect that it almost looks con-
trived, like if a director wanted to create the quintessential bar scene for a movie, this
is what he would make.
But Hollywood could never make this. Not on a Tuesday night. And not in any other town.
It’s organic. Sexy. Maybe even mildly dangerous — all that sweat. In the ultimate act
of self-absorption, I’m going to quote myself, from a tourist guidebook I wrote several
years ago, trying to capture a moment at one of these shows: “Loud. Fast. Free-falling.
Funky. You’ve got ten new friends. The girl in your arms — what’s her name? Who
cares? Dance. If you saw yourself in a mirror at this instant, you wouldn’t recognize
yourself. And that can be a good thing.”

on River Road along the Mississippi River, the Rivershack is
renowned as “the home of the tacky ashtrays.” You can listen to 
the jukebox and drink at this unpretentious hangout or enjoy 
occasional live music (mostly blues and rock). The food is a couple
of notches above regular bar food; try the burgers or anything
made with alligator.
 A very New Orleans kind of place, St. Joe’s Bar (5535 Magazine St.,
Uptown; % 504-899-3744) is a friendly, unpretentious, agreeably
dark neighborhood corner bar with intentionally peeled walls and
folk-art crosses. Inside, this long, narrow spot has a well-stocked
jukebox; outside is a tropical patio that gets crowded on pleasant
weekend evenings.
 Tipitina’s (501 Napoleon Ave.; % 504-895-8477 or 504-897-3943;
www.tipitinas.com) was, for a long time, the New Orleans music
club. Posters advertising shows from the club’s long history give
the place a tangible sense of legacy and atmosphere. Local bands
and touring national alternative rock acts play here, and during
Jazz Fest the place is a thriving, visceral center of musical activity.
If you can’t make it out to Cajun Country, on Sunday afternoons this
place holds a “Fais Do Do,” complete with free food and dance les-
sons. The surrounding residential neighborhood has improved 
considerably, but you still may want to take a cab. The Tipitina’s
Foundation is dedicated to helping musicians rebuild their lives
and careers in the Crescent City, and preserving the city’s cultural
traditions. Shows begin at 10 p.m.; Fais Do Do begins at 5 p.m.
Sunday. Cover varies.
 Vic’s Kangaroo Café (636 Tchoupitoulas St.; % 504-524-4329) is 
a friendly Warehouse District spot with an Australian theme (the
phone number spells 524-GDAY) and a sand volleyball court that
caters to the after-work crowd; have a shepherd’s pie and wash it
down with something from an impressive beer selection. Regulars
and visitors alike can have a good old time playing games of darts
or pool. Vic’s also offers some better-than-average local blues and
R&B acts (not your French Quarter tourist-trap variety).
Chilling to Cajun and Zydeco Music
Because Cajun and zydeco (see the sidebar, “AAIIEEE! Cajun and zydeco
in two easy steps” in this chapter) originated not in New Orleans but in
the swamps and bayous around Lafayette; the genuine article remains
out in the country. Still, on any given night you can find a regional heavy-
weight playing somewhere.
 Michaul’s on St. Charles (840 St. Charles Ave.; % 504-522-5517)
and Mulate’s (201 Julia St.; % 504-522-1492) present the tourist
version of the Cajun experience, with the requisite wood floors and
walls, kitsch, and a whole lot of crawfish. However, both clubs offer
Cajun dance lessons (Michaul’s are free), and you may even catch a
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 299

really good band that’s in town for the day. Shows begin at 7 p.m. in
both spots; no covers.
 Mid City Lanes Rock ’n’ Bowl (4133 S. Carrollton Ave.; % 504-482-
3133, www.rockandbowl.com), which also houses a bowling alley,
took a beating from Katrina and the entire neighborhood was
flooded very badly; thankfully they’ve recovered. Although the
neighborhood is dicey, this is one of the most unique experiences
in town. Tom Cruise stopped by when filming Interview with the
Vampire, and numerous rockers, including Mick Jagger, have been
known to sneak in when they’re here on tour.
Rock-and-Roll All Night
Although New Orleans R&B, as practiced by such legends as Fats
Domino — who was thankfully rescued from his Lower Ninth Ward home
during Katrina — laid the groundwork for what today people call rock-
and-roll, the city isn’t well known for its contributions to modern-day
rock. Still, it does boast a good rock scene, including such well-traveled
names as the Radiators and modern rockers Better Than Ezra. Following

AAIIEEE! Cajun and zydeco in two easy steps
Although jazz was born in the Crescent City, Cajun and zydeco music originated in the
wetlands around Lafayette, which was settled by the Acadians (see Chapter 15). Cajun
music and zydeco both started out with Acadian folk music and French ballads, evolv-
ing into two distinctive new forms of music native to Louisiana and heavily influenced
by the cultural diversity of the American Indian, Scotch-Irish, Spanish, Afro-Caribbean,
and German folks who also lived in the bayous and swamps near Lafayette. Although
both of these native forms rely on the accordion as a core instrument, Cajun music
today generally retains a rustic sound and feel, while zydeco has evolved into a more
urbanized sound.
A lively style reminiscent of bluegrass and country music, Cajun dance music is tra-
ditionally played on button accordions, scratchy fiddles, triangles, and rub-boards (or
frottoir). Expect to have a great time dancing to it, but don’t try to sing along: Many
Cajun songs are still sung in the Acadian dialect of French or with such thick accents
that you probably can’t understand many of the lyrics.
Zydeco began as Cajun dance music but was flavored more than 150 years by the
African, blues, and R&B traditions also enjoyed by the rural Creole population. Zydeco
has a faster beat than Cajun, especially because funkier rhythms have been mixed in
recently. Old-school zydeco performers rely only on the accordion, drums, and trade-
mark rub-board, but over the last few decades some innovative performers have intro-
duced electric guitars and basses, saxophones, and trumpets as well. Some of the
genre’s elder statesmen good-naturedly compete for the title “King of Zydeco,” which
comes with a ceremonial crown.

are some of the clubs where you may catch the Next Big Thing or a
national touring act:
 Checkpoint Charlie’s (501 Esplanade Ave.; % 504-947-0979) tends
toward rock and R&B and feels like something between a biker bar
and a college hangout. A part of the Frenchmen Street strip in the
Faubourg Marigny, it doesn’t really fit into the bohemian aesthetic
of that hip enclave. This place is good to check out young up-and-
coming rock acts. Shows begin at 10:30 p.m.; no cover.
 From its humble beginnings as a suburban bar and venue for local
alternative acts, The Howlin’ Wolf (828 S. Peters St.; % 504-522-
9653; www.howlin-wolf.com) has grown into a Warehouse District
landmark and the main competitor with House of Blues (and, to a
lesser extent, Tipitina’s) for out-of-town acts. The Wolf’s staff is
among the friendliest in town, while the overall vibe is among the
least pretentious and most agreeable in the city. Shows begin at 
10 p.m.; cover varies from $5 to $20.
 Jimmy’s Music Club and Patio Bar (8200 Willow St.; % 504-861-
8200) is right across the street from Carrollton Station, and on
weekend nights you’re likely to find a good crowd milling about in
the street between the two. Jimmy’s used to be a prime spot for
local rock bands and touring acts, though its smaller capacity pre-
cludes it from competing with Tipitina’s, the Howlin’ Wolf, or House
of Blues. Now, obscure local hard-rock acts are featured plus some
local and touring reggae, punk, and ska bands. Shows begin at 
10 p.m.; cover varies from $5 to $15.
 The Mermaid Lounge (1100 Constance St. in the Central Business
District), against all odds, carved a pretty nice niche for itself booking
an eclectic mix of acts. It is temporarily closed due to storm damage.
Drafting a Good Time: Prime 
Places for Beer Nuts
Here are some key spots with some killer brews:
 Carrollton Station (8140 Willow St.; % 504-865-9190) is a small,
folksy spot that’s equal parts neighborhood joint, college hangout,
and music venue (on the weekends). Order a draft beer (I recom-
mend anything by Abita), strike up a conversation with the person
next to you, and enjoy the gristly parade of New Orleans barflies.
The Carrollton Station Foundation is a nonprofit organization cre-
ated to help musicians recover from Katrina. Occasional cover
charge for music on weekends ranges from $5 to $10.
 Cooter Brown’s Tavern (509 S. Carrollton Ave., Uptown at the
Riverbend; % 504-866-9104) experienced some structural damage,
but reopened within a few months of the storm. It features a

staggering array of domestic and international beers. You can drink
your way around the world, and if you follow a beer-a-night 
itinerary, you’ll be in town for a long, long time. This hangout is
popular with college students, as well as older professionals, serv-
ice-industry types, musicians — you name it, they’re here. Pretty
decent bar food is served until reasonably late.
 If you want to kick back in an Irish pub, you have some very good
options, such as Kerry Irish Pub (331 Decatur St.; % 504-527-5954).
This establishment not only boasts a good variety of beers and
other spirits but also can show you the proper way to pour pints of
Guinness and hard cider. A great spot for throwing darts and shoot-
ing pool or for catching some live Irish and alternative folk music.
 A new Irish pub, Sean Kelly’s at 720 St. Louis St.; % 504-525-1406)
opened after Katrina, and it’s in the same vibe as the once-popular
O’Flaherty’s, which sadly closed after severe hurricane damage.
Digging for Gold: Hard-to-Find Gems
These bars are all located a good way off the beaten path, in distant sec-
tions of town or tucked away in residential neighborhoods.
 The Hi-Ho Lounge (2239 St. Claude Ave., between the Quarter and
Bywater; % 504-947-9344) had a particularly haphazard assort-
ment of mismatched furniture that Gambit Weekly once called
“grungedom’s living room.” Closed due to flooding, let’s hope they
recreate the interior exactly as it was.
 The Neutral Ground Coffeehouse (5110 Danneel St.; % 504-891-3381;
www.neutralground.org) is an amiable throwback to the coffee-
houses of the 1960s. Volunteers run it, it has no cover charge (instead,
they pass the hat), and it feels kind of like a college-dorm common
room. Acoustic and folk performers are on hand most nights, and
Sundays feature an open-mic night where anyone can join in.
 Snake & Jake’s Xmas Club Lounge (7612 Oak St.; % 504-861-2802)
appeals to people who like their holiday decor in dark places. Co-
owned by local musician Dave Clements and featuring a jukebox
heavy on soul and R&B, this is the kind of dive where everybody
knows your — and your dog’s — name. That’s right; pups are wel-
come, adding to the already unusual mix.
 Vaughn’s Lounge (800 Lesseps St.; % 504-947-5562) is a homey
little place tucked into the residential Bywater neighborhood. It
was closed for awhile in order to repair storm damage, but is now
open. The down-home atmosphere is charming, especially if you’re
lucky enough to be here when local trumpet player Kermit Ruffins
(a modern-day Louis Armstrong) is playing (most Thurs nights,
when he’s in town); more than likely, he’ll be barbecuing on a grill
before the show. Be sure to take a cab; parts of this neighborhood
are rough. Cover is $10 on Thursday nights.
Chapter 17: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 303

Playing Your Song: Piano Bars
Piano bars are everywhere in New Orleans, popping up from hotel lob-
bies to tourist magnets such as Pat O’Brien’s. Here are just a few of the
choicest establishments:
 The Bombay Club (830 Conti St., in the Prince Conti Hotel; % 504-
586-0972) offers not only live piano jazz Wednesday through
Saturday but also world-famous martinis (often voted best in the
city by the readers of Gambit Weekly).
 One of the most popular piano spots in town is the Carousel Bar &
Lounge (214 Royal St., in the Hotel Montelone; % 504-523-3341).
The bar is literally a revolving carousel, so watch your step no
matter how little you’ve had to drink. Catch some great piano
music Tuesday through Saturday.
 Feelings Café (2600 Chartres St. at Franklin Ave. in the Faubourg;
% 504-945-2222; www.feelingscafe.com) is a friendly, funky, low-
key neighborhood restaurant in the Faubourg Marigny. People tend
to gather in the classic New Orleans courtyard, unless they’re
inside singing along with the piano player.
 Pat O’Brien’s (718 St. Peter St.; % 504-525-4823; www.patobriens.
com) is a popular tourist attraction in the heart of the French
Quarter. Despite that (or maybe because of it), it can be a good place
to get a look at the teeming masses of humanity. The popularity of
“Pat O’s” has more to do with savvy marketing, I think, than anything
else (though the high-trafficked location, lush patio/courtyard, and
flaming fountain probably have something to do with it).
Shaking Your Groove Thing: 
The Best Dance Clubs
New Orleans features lots of places to go if you just want to shake your
moneymaker.
 At the Cat’s Meow (701 Bourbon St.; % 504-523-1157; www.cats
meow-neworleans.com), you can listen to popular rock songs all
night long or sing them yourself — karaoke is available if you have
the guts to make a fool out of yourself. Cover charge is $5 for those
under 21; free for those older than 21.
 The Gold Mine (701 Dauphine St.; % 504-586-0745) is a popular
spot for college-age kids who congregate here and dance all night
long to the latest hits. If that’s not your thing, you’d be more com-
fortable somewhere else. If you stay, try the flaming Dr. Pepper
shot. Only open Friday and Saturday nights; $2 cover.

 Razzoo (511 Bourbon St.; % 504-522-5100) is another popular spot
for the young dancing set; high-energy hits and dance mixes are the
norm here. Mix it up on the dance floor, and then take a breather
out on the patio, where you can watch everyone else dance and
delude yourself into thinking that you don’t look nearly as foolish
on the floor as they do.

 Bourbon Pub and Parade Disco (801 Bourbon St.; % 504-529-
2107) is one of the largest gay nightclubs in the United States.
Downstairs is the Bourbon Pub, a 24-hour establishment with a
video bar. The disco upstairs opens at 9 p.m.; a $5 to $10 cover is
charged on weekends.

Musical names explained
 If you’re looking for a Vegas-style revue, the Chris Owens Club (500 Bourbon St.;
% 504-523-6400; www.chrisowens.com) is it. The ageless, well-proportioned
Ms. Owens puts on a high-energy show filled with standards from the worlds of
pop, jazz, blues, and country and western. She lives above the club and didn’t
leave for Katrina. I always knew she was tough, but that says it all. Call for reser-
vations and admission prices. Shows begin at 8:30 p.m. and 10 p.m.
 Remember the vintage R&B chestnut “Mother-In-Law”? Before his death in 2001,
flamboyant singer Ernie K-Doe turned that song into a career — and later, a night-
club. Ernie K-Doe’s Mother-In-Law Lounge (1500 N. Claiborne Ave. at Columbus;
% 504-947-1078), is where K-Doe held court for years. Please take a cab — the
neighborhood is rough. The lounge flooded badly from Katrina, and K-Doe’s widow,
Antoinette, thought up a most unusual rebuilding fundraiser; she started a may-
oral campaign on behalf of her late husband, proclaiming him to be the only qual-
ified candidate. See the box on p. 27, “A music lounge owner returns and
rebuilds,” for more information.
 The local House of Blues (225 Decatur St.; % 504-529-BLUE [2583]; www.
hob.com/venues/clubvenues/neworleans) doesn’t really fit here, unless
you consider celebrity cofounder Dan Aykroyd’s alter ego, Elwood Blues, a big
name. But most major touring rock, reggae, and hip-hop acts play here. The restau-
rant is decent and pricey, with some inventive takes on local fare. Other chains
should be this stylish. Shows usually begin at 9 p.m. Cover varies from $10 to $20.
 Parrot heads abound at Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville Café (1104 Decatur St.; 
% 504-592-2565; www.margaritaville.com). Buffett took part in a Katrina
fundraising concert, “From the Big Apple to the Big Easy” in September 2005,
which was a very welcome gesture (a DVD is available). Otherwise, this chain has
contributed to the brand-name takeover of the Quarter, though mostly it’s a venue
for journeyman local performers, from blues to R&B to reggae and New Orleans
roots music. You find music all day long here, with shows generally beginning at
3, 6, and 9 p.m. No cover except for special shows on weekend nights, which start
around 10:30 p.m.
 Located in flooded Mid-City, The Lion’s Den (2655 Gravier St.; % 504-822-4693)
remains closed. Owner Irma Thomas, the “Soul Queen of New Orleans,” has been
so busy traveling around the nation to perform and serve as an informal New
Orleans music ambassador that she hasn’t been given much of a chance to focus
on the club’s return. Of course, we all hope it will, and soon.
 Pete Fountain is practically synonymous with New Orleans music. This local boy,
once a member of Lawrence Welk’s orchestra, lost just about everything when
Katrina swept through his home near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Fortunately, two
of his best clarinets survived and the spry 75-year-old jazzman continues to play
select gigs in the Greater New Orleans area. If you get a chance to hear him, don’t
miss it.

 A legendary spot in the gay community, Café Lafitte in Exile 
(901 Bourbon St.; % 504-522-8397; www.lafittes.com) was
opened by Tom Caplinger, who used to run Lafitte’s Blacksmith
Shop. Reluctant to leave the original place behind, he brought
friends and patrons (including Tennessee Williams) with him when
he opened this place. Open 24 hours, this bar is usually crowded.
 If you like everything country, dress head to tow in denim and
leather and go to Cowpokes (2240 St. Claude Ave.; % 504-947-
0505; www.cowpokesno.com). Please take a cab as this can be an
iffy neighborhood. Free line-dance lessons on Tuesdays and
Thursdays and karaoke on Wednesdays.
 Good Friends Bar (740 Dauphine St.; % 504-566-7191; www.good
friendsbar.com) is a neighborhood type of place with tons of
atmosphere and a piano in the corner that invites karaoke-style
misuse.
 The 24-hour LeRoundup (819 St. Louis St.; % 504-561-8340) has a
friendly atmosphere, attracting the most diverse crowd around.
The bar charges occasional small covers for entertainment/
revue-type shows.
 The hot dance spot Oz (800 Bourbon St.; % 877-599-8200 or 504-
592-8200; www.ozneworleans.com) is recognized both locally and
nationally as a place to see and be seen. Gambit Weekly ranked it as
the city’s No. 1 dance club, and Details magazine ranked it as one of
the top 50 clubs in the country. If you like to dress up (and by that,
I don’t mean don a tux), call ahead to inquire about their frequent
theme nights. Cover is $3 on Wednesday and Sunday nights; $10,
Friday and Saturday nights ($5 discount for gay males).

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
T
his part is designed to give you some “distilled” informa-
tion about New Orleans, and I’m using this opportunity to
focus on some post-Katrina issues. I start off on a positive
note, with a list of the “Ten Classic Experiences You Can Still
Have in Post-Katrina New Orleans” (Chapter 18). But it’s also
important to chronicle the damage the city sustained, so I
note “Ten Things We Lost in the Hurricane” (Chapter 19).
Finally, I give an opinionated take on “Ten Issues Facing New
Orleans Right Now” (Chapter 20). For more information about
the hurricane’s impact, see Chapter 2.

Chapter 18
Ten Classic Experiences
You Can Still Have in 
Post-Katrina New Orleans
In This Chapter
 Downing decadent drinks (and figuring out the drinking laws)
 Rolling the dice on the river
 Getting down with ghosts, ghouls, and goblins
T
he Big Easy tends to exaggerate your own vices, which I have found
to be all too true. Of course, these days, locals are more than willing
to give in to temptation to forget their Katrina troubles for a spell.
Fortunately, you can get creative and indulge in more than just booze on
Bourbon Street. In this chapter, I run down ten irreverent, only-in-New-
Orleans experiences that you can still enjoy, from can’t-miss music to
sinfully indulgent meals.
Gulping Gin from a “Go-Cup”
Barhopping in New Orleans is a marathon undertaking to begin with, but
it’d be much longer and less fun without these handy timesaving meas-
ures. The city’s permissive liquor laws allow bar patrons to leave the
premises with their unfinished drink in hand — provided it’s poured into
a plastic cup, known as a go-cup. Drinking in a go-cup lets drinkers leave
at their leisure, without having to worry about finishing their drink in a
hurry. Don’t be holding a go-cup in your hand if the car you’re riding in
gets pulled over — and I don’t have to tell you to forget about driving
with one, right? But if you’re walking down Bourbon Street — or any
street, for that matter — and want to savor your brew (hopefully one
locally made; try a Dixie or an Abita) or just stand still for a while to
soak up the atmosphere, these cups rule.

Delighting in Drive-Thru Daiquiris
It makes a perverse kind of sense that the city that lets you walk around
with liquor in your hand would let you drive around with it, too. I cer-
tainly don’t advocate drinking and driving, and the city does have — and
enforce — an open-container law that prohibits imbibing while behind
the wheel. But that said, ordering a daiquiri from the comfort of your car
(as you can do at New Orleans Original Daiquiris, 3301 Veterans Blvd.
in Metairie, % 504-837-8474) is a staple of suburban nightlife and quite
the “Am I really getting away with this?” experience for first-timers.
You can also grab daiquiris at walk-up windows throughout the city,
including New Orleans Original Daiquiris locations Uptown (8100 St.
Charles Ave.) and on Bourbon Street (633 Bourbon). Locations in Mid-
City (301 N. Carrollton Ave.) and neighboring suburb Chalmette (8304
Judge Perez Dr.) are closed due to flooding and might not reopen.
Succumbing to a Liuzza’s Po’ Boy
Thankfully, post-Katrina New Orleans still has countless variations of
this popular sandwich. But po’ boys from Liuzza’s on Bienville (1518 N.
Lopez St.; % 504-482-9120), a neighborhood hangout within walking dis-
tance of the Canal Streetcar, have extra bite. “Rich” and “buttery” don’t
begin to describe its bang-fist-on-table sensation. I think they taste extra
good now because I didn’t know if I’d ever taste one again. The restau-
rant flooded so badly that many locals worried about its fate. But
Liuzza’s is back and better than ever.
Grooving at the Maple Leaf
Most Tuesday nights when it’s not on the road, the ReBirth Brass Band
makes the Maple Leaf (see Chapter 17) its home for a down-and-dirty
whistle-stop tour of modern brass that’s become an ingrained local tra-
dition. College students (lots of them), tourists, and all-around music
lovers stand shoulder to shoulder in this unassuming nightspot as the
band conducts a raucous dance workout. ReBirth is New Orleans’s pre-
mier purveyor of “modern brass,” mixing pop, funk, hip-hop, and gospel
elements into the traditional brass-band sound. The band’s bawdy
grooves and precision swagger are infectious, and a show at the Maple
Leaf is nothing short of jubilant musical abandon. See the “Tuesday
Night at the Maple Leaf” box on pg. 298.
Trying Your Luck with a Lucky Dog
Popularized by John Kennedy Toole’s classic novel, A Confederacy of
Dunces, these high-cholesterol hot dogs are a junk-food staple in the
French Quarter. In fact, distinctive hot dog–shaped Lucky Dog carts
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
312

(each more than 600 pounds!) are about as common a sight in the
Quarter as drunken sailors, even late at night (when they’re a godsend
for stumbling drunks looking for a quick grease fix). Taste-wise, the 
mustard-heavy, calorie-laden Dog is far better than your average hot
dog. Though each bite brings you closer to cardiac arrest, legions of
French Quarter denizens swear that the taste is worth it.
Rolling the Bones
As seen in television and movies, the idea of a riverboat casino holds a
certain Mark Twain kind of romance. The reality may not be quite as
romantic, but it’s an increasingly popular way for locals and tourists to
willingly part with large amounts of their cash. Truth be told, you can’t
see much of the river on a riverboat casino, and not just because it
doesn’t have windows. Most riverboats are loath to leave their berths
(which is a sin in itself). They want customers to be able to come and
go at will rather than be stuck, you know, enjoying the sights, sounds,
and spray of a riverboat cruise. Still, despite the lack of nautical atmos-
phere, riverboat casinos (see Chapter 12) combine modern-day avarice
with the idyllic sheen of yesteryear — a hard combination to beat. If
you really have an urge to roll along the river, forget the floating casinos
and come aboard old-fashioned steamboats or paddlewheelers (see
Chapter 12) offering dinner, dancing, live music and much more.
Having a Hurricane at Pat O’Brien’s
Pat O’Brien’s (see Chapter 17) is one of New Orleans’s most popular
bars, due in no small part to its signature drink, the Hurricane. Named for
the glass it comes in (its shape resembles a hurricane lamp), this fruity
concoction originated during World War II, when rum was so widely avail-
able that liquor distributors pushed it heavily and retailers had to find a
way to use it all. The Hurricane is a potent cocktail, but its true popular-
ity likely derives as much from the souvenir glass it comes in — which, in
case you’re interested, has at least one use after you finish your drink:
According to the bar’s Web site (www.patobriens.com), a Hurricane
glass holds exactly $10 in pennies.
Surrendering to Your Slothful Side
New Orleans’s signature phrase is “Let the good times roll” for a reason:
The city’s atmosphere is perfectly suited for indolent lounging, whiling
away the hours in as lazy a fashion as you can muster. From a leisurely
breakfast of beignets and café au lait at Café du Monde (see Chapter 11)
to a relaxed carriage ride (see Chapter 12) around the Quarter to an
unhurried afternoon sipping a Pimm’s Cup at Napoleon House (see
Chapter 17), you can easily make a day out of doing next to nothing. 
And an evening, too: Idling at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop or nursing an
Chapter 18: Ten Classic Experiences You Can Still Have 313

anisette at Old Absinthe House (see Chapter 17) is a perfect way to
wind down after a hard day of, well, hardly moving. If you’re fortunate
enough to be staying at a swanky hotel like the Hotel Monteleone or 
the Windsor Court (Chapter 10), all the better — spending a whole day
lounging and being pampered without ever leaving the premises is possi-
ble (if not necessarily advisable).
Meeting Creatures of the Night
New Orleans enjoys a supernatural reputation, and some establishments
(such as the Hi-Ho Lounge or Hotel Provincial) claim to play host to
spirits. But spending the night in a particular hotel or bar, waiting for a
ghost to come to you, can be a frustrating endeavor, especially when
you can be proactive and track down the specters yourself! Outfits such
as Haunted History Tours and Magic Walking Tours (see Chapter 12)
offer a variety of walking tours that are themed around ghosts, vampires,
and cemeteries. The Cemetery/Voodoo Tour offered by Historic New
Orleans Walking Tours (see Chapter 12) allows you to take in the tomb
of famed voodoo priestess Marie Laveau and an actual voodoo temple.
Speaking of vampires, New Orleans’s own Queen of the Damned, 
vampire novelist Anne Rice, used to allow tours of historical landmark
St. Elizabeth’s Orphanage and her Garden District home at 1239 First
Street. But shockingly, in 2004, Rice sold the last of her New Orleans
properties and initially moved to (gasp!) a gated community in suburban
Kenner, Louisiana. In 2005, she moved to La Jolla, California, to be closer
to her son, novelist Christopher Rice, and then moved again less than
one year later to the warmer climate of Rancho Mirage, California. Fans
can still get their fill of Rice in New Orleans, including autographed
books, first editions, and other rarities at the Garden District Book
Shop (see Chapter 13). Loyal fans might want to plan their New Orleans
trip around the annual “The Vampire Lestat Ball,” always held the week-
end closest to Halloween. Go to www.lestatsdarkgiftshop.com for
tickets and additional info. For late-night options, wander Bourbon
Street, where you’re sure to run into someone (or something) other
worldly before long or descend into The Dungeon (see Chapter 17) after
midnight.
Suffering Through Saints Games
Yes, Saints games — the way New Orleans’s long-suffering football fans
have to bear the team’s tumultuous ups and downs is indeed a sin. The
team once known derisively as “the Aints” perpetually and notoriously
fails to capitalize on its momentum; the team’s failures are often blamed
on the fact that the Superdome is built on a former graveyard (rumors
have it that not all the bodies were removed). Still, Saints fans are
arguably as tenacious as followers of the Chicago Cubs, and martyrdom
is of course alive and well in this predominantly Catholic town. Serving
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
314

as a shelter of last resort and Katrina’s winds and rain took a toll on this
modern landmark, but a $186-million renovation put the Superdome
(and the Saints) back in business. The opener on September 25, 2006,
saw the Saints defeat the Falcons to much fanfare. Even Falcons coach
Jim Mora acknowledged the significance of the event: “As tough as it is
to lose a game, I’d be lying if I said there isn’t a little, little, little piece 
of me that didn’t appreciate what this game meant to this city. It meant 
a lot” (Associated Press, 9/26/06).

Ten Things We Lost

W
hen I asked one of my friends to help me pare down the list of
things we lost to Katrina, she reminded me that it’s the little
things that we miss the most — a neighbor or friend who moved away
and isn’t coming back, a grand old tree we’d pass on our way to work, a
favorite little corner store or restaurant that closed because of insur-
ance woes. Some things are more nebulous than others. Lacking any
kind of a normal, daily routine is hard to take, but that isn’t necessarily a
“thing” lost.
Much of what we miss was a part of our day-to-day lives rather than part
of the tourist experience, so it would be unfair to expect you to “miss”
them in the same way we would. I’m going to assume that because you
are reading this book and planning a trip to New Orleans, that you do
care. New Orleanians do not want to be pitied, but it means a great deal
to us when visitors make an effort to understand.
For more information on Katrina and its aftermath, including a list of
organizations accepting donations, see Chapter 2.
People
The biggest tragedy of Hurricane Katrina is the loss of family, friends,
neighbors and co-workers. Many of them were among the 1,836 victims
of the storm, and more than 700 people are still missing more than one
year after the storm. Other people survived the hurricane, only to learn
that they could not afford to rebuild, or lost their job or faced some form
of personal crisis, and moved away out of necessity. For the locals who
stayed, myself included, it is difficult to lose so many people in your life
over a short period of time and in such dramatic fashion.

Neighborhoods
The Lower Ninth Ward received the most attention from the mainstream
media, perhaps because most of its residents were considered an abomi-
nation in the United States: poor. But there were many other neighbor-
hoods that suffered complete devastation in the wake of Katrina and the
faulty levees. Middle-class, lakeside neighborhoods such as Gentilly,
where Mayor Ray Nagin lives, and my neighborhood, Lakeview, were
also among the worst flooded areas. To the south, Mid-City, Broadmoor,
the Seventh Ward, and Treme took on water from levee breaches at the
17th Street and London Street canals. To the east, all of New Orleans
East and parts of Holy Cross were submerged by storm surge. I could
name all of the neighborhoods that flooded, but the names would proba-
bly be meaningless to you. What’s important to remember, especially 
if you choose to tour any of these damaged areas, is that people — 
perhaps like you — once lived there and are trying to rebuild that way 
of life. 
Restaurants
More than 80 percent of the city was flooded at one point, so I am gen-
uinely surprised when I hear of another local restaurant that has risen
from the ruins. The city’s many mom ’n’ pop places did not have the ben-
efit of falling back on a corporate parent company and yet, often these
independent establishments were the first to come back. However, areas
like the West End, the northwestern corner of Lakeview, will not return. A
cluster of favorite seafood joints (including 146-year-old Bruning’s) were
built on pilings, extending into Lake Pontchartrain. They didn’t stand a
chance against Katrina’s winds and storm surge. Of course, even that
wouldn’t be enough to stop some New Orleanians from coming back, but
the Army Corps of Engineers seized the land. That prevented any of these
historic businesses from returning and left a huge void in Lakeview. See
“Assessing Katrina’s Effect on the Dining Scene” in Chapter 11 for more
information.
Musicians
You probably remember the search for rock ’n’ roll pioneer Fats Domino
almost immediately after the storm. A long-time resident of the Lower
Ninth Ward, he and his family decided to ride out the storm and were
rescued by boat days later. Hundreds of local, less-famous musicians
lost musical instruments, master tapes, CDs and more, hindering their
ability to ply their trade. Some had to leave the city for better opportuni-
ties (in Houston, for example), which has taken a toll on New Orleans’
unique music culture. During the first year after Katrina, there were not
as many visitors as years past, and club owners fought to stay open
despite lack of customers. Please help support New Orleans musicians
Chapter 19: Ten Things We Lost in the Hurricane 317

by attending live shows and/or buying their music (www.louisiana
musicfactory.com). See Chapter 17 for club suggestions, and look for 
a list of music charity organizations in Chapter 2.
Architecture
The Preservation Resource Center (% 504-581-7032; www.prcno.org),
a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving New Orleans’ historic
neighborhoods, is on the frontlines of protecting the city’s signature
housing stock, such as the shotgun house. This has always been a chal-
lenge as the population shifted toward the suburbs, leaving behind old
houses to decay or be demolished. Due to Katrina, there will be an esti-
mated 15,000 demolitions, some of which will take place in historic 
districts. In some cases, there is no proposed salvaging of historic 
materials, such as heart pine flooring, windows, doors, cypress floor
joists, fireplace mantels, brackets, pocket doors, and more. Having lost
so many historic homes and buildings already, many New Orleanians feel
it should be a priority to maintain as much of New Orleans’s urban land-
scape as possible.
Trees
You may not notice if you haven’t visited the city before or haven’t been
back in awhile, but a lot of New Orleans’ gorgeous old trees succumbed
to wind or water during Katrina. Fortunately, many of the live oaks sur-
vived, but magnolias — like the massive 100-year-old tree in front of my
house — couldn’t handle the brackish waters of the lake, and drowned.
They are as much a part of the urban landscape as the residences and
buildings, and it’s heartbreaking that these old trees that lived for so
many years — in some cases, hundreds — died this way.
City Park
At 1,500 acres, City Park (see Chapter 12) is the country’s fifth largest
urban park. It shelters the largest collection of mature live oaks in the
world. Many of these beautiful trees — which have lived for hundreds of
years — could not survive the two weeks they spent under three- to
eight-feet of brackish water. Once the floodwaters receded, all of the
grass, flowers, and bushes had died, and brown muck covered every-
thing. Even now, the park is scarred, dotted with chopped trunks and
overgrown grass and foliage because the park lacks the staff and
resources to do even basic maintenance. The park is slowly being
restored. Log on to www.neworleanscitypark.com for the most recent
updates.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
318

Chalmette Battlefield
This park (see Chapter 12) is the site of the historic Battle of New
Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson and a ragtag band staged a des-
perate defense of the city against the British. Tragically, Chalmette was
inundated with storm surge pushed up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet,
nicknamed “Mr Go,” an underutilized channel dug up by the Army Corps
of Engineers. Also on the grounds is the Chalmette National Cemetery.
The park remains closed due to extensive damage, and the funds to
rehabilitate it may be a long time coming.
St. Charles Streetcar (temporarily)
From aprons to postcards, images of the famous St. Charles Streetcar
appear on an array of New Orleans–themed souvenirs (see Chapter 12).
More than a year after Katrina, this historic line is still closed, though its
cars are temporarily running on the Canal Streetcar line (the new Canal
cars flooded). I still catch myself checking for an oncoming streetcar
before I drive across the neutral ground. I can’t wait to hear that familiar
sound of the wheels on the tracks. Check the Transit Authority (www.
norta.com/st_charles.php) for more information. They claim street-
cars will be up and running by the end of 2007, and that, before then, 
“If you want to see the attractions on St. Charles Avenue and Carrollton
Avenue, take the RTA St. Charles bus, which operates on the same route
that the St. Charles streetcars did before Katrina.”
Sense of Identity
The sudden loss of its people and culture could lead to another loss: its
identity. What is the City of New Orleans without its diverse population
and trademark food, music, and subtropical urban landscape? Change
can be good in the sense that New Orleans could’ve used some improve-
ments prior to the storm. However, the recovery process could threaten
what makes this city so special if we’re not careful; already the French
Quarter — once an artist’s haven — is seeing rents climb so high that
artists can’t afford to return. Who will repopulate the new New Orleans?

Orleans Right Now

I
nitially after the storm, there was a lot of talk about whether New
Orleans should rebuild. Now that the recovery process is under way,
many other variables such as the economy, health care, insurance,
repopulation levels and schools are affecting New Orleanians’ ability to
rebuild and continue to live there. The following is my personal assess-
ment of the top issues.
Identity
In our eagerness to rebuild the city and our lives, there is a danger of
creating a theme park version of New Orleans. Or worse, we could con-
struct a cookie cutter city, one that looks like Anytown, U.S.A. It would
help if our government officials at all levels and residents could agree 
on an overall plan for the city and work together. Unfortunately, I still
see stubborn divisiveness among a few key players (see “Names in the
News” in Chapter 2) and that will only serve to hurt us and future gener-
ations of New Orleanians.
Repopulation
Before Katrina, New Orleans was home to 484,000 residents. As of Decem-
ber 2006, city officials estimated a post-Katrina population of 210,000 or
less than half. The city can survive with fewer people, but flooded neigh-
borhoods with only a few inhabitants and limited city services might
struggle for survival. Early plans to only rebuild nonflooded areas were
quickly forgotten in the face of heated public criticism. Of course, I

understand their concerns as I would not appreciate someone telling me
that I couldn’t rebuild my home, but I recognize the fact that the city as
a whole is at stake, and not just my little corner of it. Given that context,
I want to do what I can to ensure New Orleans lives on, and I think sup-
porting a citywide recovery plan — whatever sacrifices that entails — is
the best way to bring people back or encourage others to move here for
the first time.
Crime
Despite the smaller population, the crime rate is nearly equal to what it
was before Katrina. Most people who lost everything are working hard 
to rebuild their lives. Unfortunately, looting and burglaries have become
common in areas where people are trying to repair their homes and
replace belongings like appliances and furniture. In an infamous story
from August 2006, thieves stole $100,000 worth of the Walton Construction
concrete-pouring equipment being used to build a Katrina memorial in the
storm-battered Lower Ninth Ward. “This takes a lot of guts,” said Walton
senior vice president Bill Petty. “This is the largest piece of equipment
that has even been stolen from Walton” (Times-Picayune). Someone in my
neighborhood reported that a scavenger stole her carport and gutter,
most likely to sell as scrap metal. The National Guard and New Orleans
Police Department must gain the upper hand. Crime in the city usually
happens at night; if you’re traveling long distances after dark, be sure to
take a taxi.
Levees
Imagine how locals felt when the Army Corps of Engineers — which
admitted that its faulty levee design and implementation led to the levee
breaches — was put in charge of repairing them and shoring up the
weakened levee system in general. If the necessary federal funds ever
come through, the Corps will also be responsible for constructing levees
that can withstand a Category 5 storm.
Economy
Business is not exactly booming in Orleans Parish, the county that
encompasses New Orleans. A surprising number of companies and mom
’n’ pop–type establishments managed to overcome flooding or looting,
but could not get insurance. In New Orleans, the number of occupational
licenses is down 50 percent, yet neighboring parishes such as Jefferson
and St. Tammany (across Lake Pontchartrain) have seen an incredible
increase, as New Orleans businesses migrate there. These businesses
are understandably attracted to the large, stable populations, reliable
city services, and higher ground elevation. So it’s especially important
to support those businesses that did opt to stay in the city.
Chapter 20: Ten Issues Facing New Orleans Right Now 321

Employment
In the months after the storm, thousands of people were laid off because
companies were either closing or paring down their staffs in order to
stay afloat. One strange sight was fast food companies advertising pay 
of $15 to $20 an hour and signing bonuses up to $6,000. (Many of their
workers evacuated the city and didn’t come back until months later or
simply didn’t return at all.) With the business climate in a state of flux,
steady employment remains a major concern unless you work construc-
tion or ply a trade involving rebuilding.
Health Care
Before the storm, there were 16 hospitals that served patients through-
out the Metro area. Due to flooding or fears of looting, 13 hospitals were
temporarily closed for months after the storm. One year later, some hos-
pitals closed permanently due to lack of money, insurance, or both. The
Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (www.dhh.louisiana.
gov) estimates that the city lost half of its physicians. Citizens without
health insurance, transportation or money will most likely suffer the
consequences.
Insurance
Residents and businesses are struggling to maintain their insurance poli-
cies or are having a tough time attaining policies post-Katrina. More than
a year after the storm, some homeowners are still fighting with their
insurance companies over payment for Katrina damage. Many predict
that if the state and federal government do not ensure that everyone 
can be insured, only the wealthiest people will be able to stay.
Schools
New Orleans’ public schools were failing miserably well before Katrina,
with just a few exceptions located in predominantly white, middle- and
upper-class neighborhoods. Many school buildings were destroyed by
flood, and teachers and staff were in short supply. Families were forced
to enroll their children elsewhere and, in some cases, found better
schools in other cities and stayed there. Soon after the storm, the
Louisiana state legislature voted to take over the city’s public schools.
As of May 2006, only 25 of 117 schools had reopened and the public
school system has been largely replaced by a charter system, which is
no longer held accountable to the school board or superintendent. Only
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
322

20 percent of public school students have returned, compared to 90 per-
cent of private school students. This is a historic opportunity to com-
pletely revamp education in the city, but it will require leadership from
all levels of government and loyal support from parents and students.
Race and Class
One of the ironies of New Orleans is its social emphasis on race and
class, yet prior to Katrina, it was home to one of the most integrated
communities in the country. Sure, some neighborhoods were predomi-
nantly white or predominantly African-American, but far more neighbor-
hoods were mixed. And wealthy enclaves such as the Garden District
and the French Quarter either border (or are just blocks away from)
poorer areas and housing projects. Long ago, when its port helped sus-
tain the slave trade, New Orleans also nourished a well-to-do community
of Free Persons of Color — the largest in the South, in fact.
But Katrina revealed that there is still a divide, even among African
Americans. Mayor Nagin, who was a wealthy (though self-made) African-
American businessman before seeking political office, was accused by
the African-American community of winning his first election thanks to
mostly white support. Yet when he attempted to reach out to the exiled
African-American community, he awkwardly called for a “chocolate city”
and managed to upset white voters as well. You would think that his re-
election was in jeopardy, but Nagin was re-elected. There’s a saying that
the governor of Louisiana will always be white and the mayor of New
Orleans will always be black. I’m not sure that the racial tension in New
Orleans will ever go away, especially since many poor African Americans
face more challenges and have fewer options in a post-Katrina city than
their wealthier white counterparts. Let’s hope that the storm will
encourage people of all races and classes to present a united front and
work together to rebuild this great American city.
You’ll find further discussion of race and class post-Katrina in many of
the articles and books I recommend in Chapter 2, especially Michael Eric
Dyson’s provocative Come Hell or High Water: Hurricane Katrina and the
Color of Disaster (Basic Books, 2006).

Hospitals
Should you become ill during your visit,
most major hospitals have staff doctors on

Appendix: Quick Concierge 325

Newspapers and Magazines
To find out what’s going on around town,
pick up a copy of the Times-Picayune
(www.nola.com) or Gambit Weekly
(www.bestofneworleans.com). Both
publications’ buildings flooded during
Katrina, temporarily forcing them to stop
publishing hard copy papers. Repairs have
since been completed. Times-Picayune
columnist Chris Rose has written moving
accounts of Katrina’s long-term effects on
locals and is very popular for his plainspo-
ken voice. OffBeat (www.offbeat.com)
is an extensive monthly guide to the city’s
evening entertainment, art galleries, and
special events; it’s available in most hotels.
Also refer to the “Where to Get More
Information” section at the end of this
appendix.
Pharmacies
The Walgreens Drug Store at 4400 S.
Claiborne Ave. at Napoleon is the closest
one to the French Quarter that offered 
24-hour pharmacy service; however, it
flooded and remains closed at the time of
this writing. Call % 504-891-0976 to ensure
it has reopened. Take a cab here at night,
or have the hotel send a taxi for your 
prescription.
Police
For nonemergency situations, call % 504-
821-2222. For emergencies, dial % 911.
Radio Stations
Some of the more helpful and/or popular
radio stations in the city include WSMB,
1350 AM (sports talk); WWNO, 89.9 FM
(National Public Radio, classical); WWOZ,
90.7 FM (New Orleans and Louisiana
music; jazz, R&B, and blues); WQUE, 93.3
FM (urban/R&B); and KKND, 106.7 FM
(modern rock). If you’d like to hear local
news, which still tends to revolve around
Katrina-related issues, tune in to talk radio
station WWL, 870 AM.
Restrooms
Public restrooms are located at Jax
Brewery, Riverwalk Marketplace, Canal
Place Shopping Center, Washington
Artillery Park, and any of the major hotels.
Safety
Though many areas of New Orleans are
perfectly safe, the general rule when visit-
ing any city is to be on your guard all the
time. Public transportation is relatively safe,
though at night you’d be wise to take a cab
if you’re traveling to a dimly lit area. The 
St. Charles and Canal streetcars run 
24 hours (though the St. Charles line is still
closed temporarily as of this writing), but
both run through some iffy neighborhoods,
which can change from nice to not-so-nice
within a couple of blocks; again, take a cab
at night. Always use caution when walking
through an unlit area at night. Avoid the
Iberville Housing Project located between
Basin, N. Claiborne, Iberville, and St. Louis
streets, just outside of the French Quarter.
You should also avoid St. Louis Cemetery
No. 2 near Claiborne on the lake side of the
Iberville Housing Project unless you’re trav-
eling with a large tour group. Also stay
away from the area behind Armstrong Park.
Remember: The city looks deceptively safe,
and neighborhoods change very quickly.
Smoking
In this regard, New Orleans is like most
major U.S. cities and more lenient than
many. At most attractions and in most
business buildings and shops, smokers
should be prepared to stand around out-
side with all the other smokers. Most local
restaurants cater to both smokers and
nonsmokers; a relative few (in relation to
the rest of the country) prohibit smoking
altogether. Ask before you sit down.
Taxes
Louisiana’s sales tax is very confusing. In
addition to the state and federal taxes,

each parish (county) may have additional
taxes. To make things more confusing,
some items such as unprepared food and
some types of drugs are partially exempt,
while prescriptions are totally exempt. In
general, the total sales tax in New Orleans
is 9 percent; it’s 8.75 percent in Jefferson
Parish.
Taxis
In most tourist areas, you can usually hail
a taxi or get one at a taxi stand. If you can’t
find a taxi, call United Cab at % 504-522-
9771. If you have any complaints or left
something in a taxi, call the Taxicab
Bureau at % 504-565-6272.
Time Zone
New Orleans is in the Central time zone.
Daylight saving time is in effect from April
through October.
Tipping
For most services — including restaurants
and taxis — add 15 to 20 percent to your
bill (before taxes). Many restaurants auto-
matically add a 15 to 20 percent gratuity for
parties of six or more. If you’re just drink-
ing at a bar, tipping 10 to 15 percent is typi-
cal. You should give bellhops $1 or $2 per
bag, maids $1 per day, coat-check people
$1 per garment, and automobile valets $1.
