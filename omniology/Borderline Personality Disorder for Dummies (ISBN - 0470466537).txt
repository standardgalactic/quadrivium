Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies

Introduction
S
ometimes we watch a news show that features a daily commentary 
called “Worst Person in the World.” During this segment, the reporter 
chooses a few people who’ve said or done something that he thinks deserves 
his haughty contempt. Not so long ago, many mental health profession-
als may have labeled people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) as 
“Worst Patients in the World.”
Until recently, no one knew which treatments really help people with BPD. 
Furthermore, people with BPD are incredibly scary to treat because they 
tend to have a lot of rage directed at themselves, the people they care about, 
the world, and even their doctors and therapists. Borderline rage can occur 
anywhere and anytime. Mental health professionals want to protect and help 
their clients, but people with BPD are hard to keep safe and frequently block 
therapists’ best efforts. In fact, about 75 percent of people who have BPD 
hurt themselves in some way, and one out of ten succeeds in suicide.
On the other hand, if you’re lucky enough to treat, know, or care about some-
one with BPD, you may want to consider that person one of the “Best People 
in the World.” People with BPD can be highly intelligent, enthusiastic, and 
kind. Some therapists find that persistent effort over time results in a surpris-
ingly gratifying metamorphosis in their patients with BPD.
The contrast between the good and bad in a person with BPD is like the 
contrast between black and white. Or, as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said 
about the girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead:
When she was good,
She was very good indeed,
But when she was bad she was horrid.
About This Book
If you or someone you care about suffers from BPD, we appreciate the chal-
lenges and painful obstacles you face. The purpose of this book is to provide 
a comprehensive look at the symptoms, causes, and treatment of BPD. We 
strive to help people who have BPD and the people who care about them 
gain understanding about this complicated mental illness. Because treating

Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies 
BPD requires professional intervention, this book isn’t designed as a stand-
alone self-help program. However, you can certainly use it as an adjunct to 
psychotherapy. We share the belief with other professionals that clients ben-
efit from being informed about their disorders, the suspected causes, and the 
treatments that work.
An Important Message to Our Readers
People with BPD often have greatly heightened sensitivity to criticism and 
disapproval. Thus, we’re aware that a few of you are likely to take offense to 
the For Dummies part of this book’s title. From time to time, people approach 
us and express concern about the meaning of For Dummies. We understand 
the concern. Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies is our sixth psy-
chology book in the For Dummies series. Our intent is to produce books that 
cover topics that an intelligent audience wants to know about without all the 
jargon and the technicalities.
Thus, we humbly offer you a clear, comprehensive overview of BPD. We vow 
to make this coverage serious and in-depth.
Conventions Used in This Book
We believe that stories and examples provide the best way to convey many 
ideas. Therefore, we use a lot of examples to illustrate our points throughout 
this book. The stories and cases we describe here represent composites of 
people with BPD whom we’ve known in our personal lives as well as in our 
practices. However, none of these stories depicts a true, recognizable por-
trayal of a specific person. Any resemblance to a specific person, alive or 
deceased, is completely coincidental. We bold the names of the individuals 
affected by BPD in each story the first time they appear to highlight that a 
case example is unfolding.
Borderline personality disorder is a bit of a mouthful, so we shorten the term 
to BPD throughout this book. In addition, we often use phrases like “most 
people with BPD” or “people with BPD generally do this or that.” We abso-
lutely realize that BPD plays out differently in each person. In some ways, 
there’s no such thing as “typical” or “most” in the BPD world. However, we’d 
need another thousand pages to thoroughly discuss each variant and permu-
tation involved in BPD. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the many symptom 
constellations of BPD.) So, just to be clear, we don’t mean “everyone who has 
BPD” every time we say “most.”

 Introduction
If you’re using this book in collaboration with a therapist, we suggest that 
you take notes and write out your responses to the exercises we provide — 
whether on your computer, Blackberry, or iPhone or in an old-fashioned note-
book. You probably also want to password protect or guard your material 
because, after all, your notes are for you (and your therapist) and no one else.
What You’re Not to Read
We stuff this book with loads of information about BPD, and we lay it out so 
you can pick and choose what to read in any order you like. Use the table 
of contents and index to jump into whatever you want to know. Or, take the 
conventional route of starting with Chapter 1 and reading straight through 
from there.
Sidebars contain information about interesting studies or other stuff that we 
think is intriguing, but, in truth, not critical for understanding the material in 
the rest of the chapter. Sections marked as Technical Stuff are similar to side-
bars, but they relate specifically to the discussion in the chapter they appear 
in. You can skip those, too, if you want.
Foolish Assumptions
We’re going to take a wild guess here and assume that most people who read 
this book are interested in BPD. That interest may stem from your own emo-
tional issues, or you may have concerns for someone you care about who has 
BPD-like symptoms.
On the other hand, you may be a professional who’s looking for some acces-
sible information that you can pass along to your clients. Or, maybe you want 
a few hints about dealing with difficult therapeutic issues. You may also be 
a student of psychology, counseling, social work, or psychiatry looking for a 
clear introduction to this complex problem.
How This Book Is Organized
We divide Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies into seven parts with 
28 chapters, plus two appendixes. Here’s a brief overview of each part.

4
Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies 
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of 
Borderline Personality Disorder
Part I introduces you to the notion of personality and its connection to BPD. 
Chapter 2 takes a close look at the characteristics that make up a healthy 
versus an unhealthy personality. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the 
symptoms of BPD compared to the symptoms of other types of personality 
disorders, such as paranoid, narcissistic, and obsessive-compulsive person-
ality disorders. We also discuss some of the other emotional problems that 
often accompany BPD. Chapter 4 describes the cultural, biological, and psy-
chological causes of BPD.
Part II: Taking Note of the 
Major BPD Symptoms
The six chapters in this part explore the major areas of dysfunction associ-
ated with BPD: impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, identity problems, rela-
tionship conflicts, thinking styles, and difficulties in perception. This material 
helps you more fully appreciate the magnitude of the issues that people with 
BPD must deal with in their everyday lives. If you have BPD, this understand-
ing can help you identify the key areas of your life that you may need to work 
on. If you care about someone who has BPD, this in-depth exploration can 
clear up the confusion you’ve probably been experiencing for a long time.
Part III: Making the Choice to Change
Part III prepares you for treating or dealing with BPD. People with BPD and 
their loved ones need to know what treatments are available and which ones 
mental health professionals have found to be effective. Chapter 11 reviews 
the types of BPD treatment and the various mental health professionals avail-
able to provide these treatments. Chapter 12 describes the common obsta-
cles that people must overcome before engaging in treatment. Chapter 13 
illustrates how to explain BPD to other people and helps you decide just how 
much you want to reveal to whom. Chapter 14 looks at keeping physically 
healthy during the treatment process.

5
 Introduction
Part IV: Treatments for BPD
In this part, we draw from the various treatment strategies that professionals 
have found to be effective for BPD and apply them to the core areas of dys-
function that people with BPD exhibit. Chapter 15 discusses how to address 
problems associated with impulsivity, including self-harm and risk taking. 
Chapter 16 shows various strategies for improving your ability to regulate 
out-of-control emotions. Chapter 17 reviews ways to develop a clear sense 
of identity. Chapter 18 takes a look at how people with BPD can improve 
their abilities to put themselves in other people’s shoes. Chapter 19 provides 
ways to form more adaptive states of mind and new types of thinking. Finally, 
Chapter 20 discusses some of the medication options associated with treat-
ing BPD.
Part V: Advice for People Who Care
This part is for people who encounter others who have BPD. Chapter 21 tells 
partners how to set limits and relate more effectively to the ones they care 
about who have BPD. Chapter 22 speaks to people who have friends with 
BPD. Chapter 23 discusses what parents who may have adolescents with 
emerging BPD can do and what they need to look for in their kids. Chapter 
24 talks to adults who grew up with BPD parents and attempts to show them 
how to relate and better understand their parents. Finally, Chapter 25 talks to 
mental health professionals who treat people with BPD.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part gives you some quick tips on calming hot emotions. We also tell 
you ten ways to say you’re sorry. Finally, we list ten things not to do when 
you’re trying to overcome your BPD.
Part VII: Appendixes
Appendix A offers numerous resources for more information and help. 
Appendix B provides several blank forms and exercises that we reference in 
other parts of the book.

Where to Go from Here
We intend Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies to provide a compre-
hensive overview of this complex emotional and behavioral problem. Most 
readers without BPD will find that this information helps them to better 
understand the problem and to know how to relate to people with BPD better 
than they did before. People in close relationships with people who have BPD 
may find that a therapist can provide additional support.
If you have BPD, this book will help you better understand yourself and the 
people you care about. However, we strongly recommend that you also enlist 
the help of a mental health professional who is trained in treating BPD. BPD 
is one problem you don’t want to deal with on your own.
If you’re a therapist, this book can help you spot people with BPD more 
quickly and set better boundaries when you’re treating them. However, if 
you’re new to the treatment of BPD, you’ll definitely want additional training 
and education about this disorder.

Mapping the 
Boundaries of 
Borderline 
Personality 
Disorder

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we provide an overview of what borderline 
personality disorder (BPD) is and briefly discuss a cou-
ple of treatment options. We also discuss what a healthy 
personality looks like to help you better understand 
what’s missing for people who have BPD. We describe the 
major symptoms of BPD and cover the major causes of 
this complicated disorder.

Chapter 1
Exploring Borderline 
Personality Disorder
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the characteristics of BPD
▶ Searching for BPD’s causes
▶ Calculating the costs of BPD
▶ Seeking help for BPD through psychotherapy and medication
▶ Knowing how to help someone who has BPD
A
 charming, exciting, intimate, intelligent, fun person suddenly turns 
mean, sluggish, angry, self-defeating, and dismal — a radical change 
in an instant for no obvious reason. What causes the unpredictable ups 
and downs from fear to rage, intimate intensity to distance, and drama to 
downfall that some people experience on a daily basis? Borderline personal-
ity disorder (BPD), the most common and debilitating of all the personality 
disorders, causes chaos and anguish for both the people who suffer from the 
disorder and those who care about them.
This book takes you inside the world of BPD and shows you what living with 
this disorder is really like. Unlike some books and articles about BPD, we 
strive to maintain a compassionate, kind perspective of those people who 
are afflicted with BPD. You may be reading this book because you know or 
suspect you have BPD or some of its major symptoms. If so, expect to find a 
wealth of information about BPD, its causes, and some effective treatments.
Perhaps you’re a reader who cares about or loves someone who has BPD. By 
reading this book, you can discover why people with BPD do what they do as 
well as see how you can better relate to them. Finally, even if you’re not in a 
close relationship with someone with BPD, you no doubt have a co-worker, 
neighbor, supervisor, or acquaintance who suffers from BPD, or at the very 
least, a few of its prominent symptoms. Even superficial relationships with 
people who have BPD can pose surprising challenges. This book can help you 
better understand what’s going on and how to deal with the problems BPD 
creates for you.

10
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
If you’re a therapist, you can use this book to expand your understanding of 
BPD. You can see how to deal with difficult therapeutic issues. You can also 
figure out how to set better boundaries while you simultaneously take care of 
both yourself and your clients.
In this chapter, we describe the basics of BPD in terms of how the disorder 
affects both the people who have it and the people who have relationships 
with them. We present what’s known about the causes of BPD. We also tally 
up the costs of BPD for both the people who have it and the society they live 
in. Finally, we overview the major treatment options for BPD and show those 
of you who care about someone with BPD what you can do to help.
Breaking Down Borderline 
Personality Disorder
Personalities are the relatively consistent ways in which people feel, behave, 
think, and relate to others. Your personality reflects the ways in which other 
people generally describe you — such as calm, anxious, easily angered, 
mellow, thoughtful, impulsive, inquisitive, or standoffish. All people differ 
from their usual personalities from time to time, but, for the most part, per-
sonalities remain fairly stable over time (check out Chapter 2 for more on 
personality).
For example, consider someone who has a generally jolly personality; this 
person enjoys life and people. However, when this person experiences a trag-
edy, you expect to see normal grief and sadness in this generally jolly person. 
On the other hand, someone with a personality disorder, such as BPD, expe-
riences pervasive, ongoing trouble with emotions, behaviors, thoughts, and/
or relationships. The following sections describe the core problems that 
people with BPD frequently experience.
 
The American Psychiatric Association has a manual that describes specific 
symptoms of BPD. The manual groups these symptoms into nine categories. 
Here, we condense these nine categories into four larger arenas of life func-
tioning that are impacted by the symptoms of BPD in one way or another.
 
Although BPD has an identifiable set of symptoms, the specific symptoms and 
the intensity of those symptoms varies greatly from person to person. Chapter 
3 reviews each of the nine symptom categories separately and covers how 
BPD manifests itself in a wide variety of presentations.

11
 Chapter 1: Exploring Borderline Personality Disorder
Rocky relationships
People with BPD desperately want to have good relationships, but they inad-
vertently sabotage their efforts to create and maintain positive relationships 
over and over again. You may be wondering how they continually end up 
in rocky relationships. Well, the answer lies in the fact that their desire for 
relationships is fueled by an intense need to fill the bottomless hole that they 
feel inside themselves. People with BPD ache to fill this hole with a sense of 
who they are, a higher level of self-esteem, and high amounts of outside nur-
turance, unconditional love, and adoration. But no one can fill such a huge 
personal chasm. Partners and friends are defeated the moment they enter 
the relationship. Their attempts to make their friends who have BPD happy 
inevitably fail. The people with BPD respond to their friends’ efforts with dis-
appointment, derision, or rage.
This intense negative reaction confuses partners of people with BPD because 
people with BPD typically start out relationships with enthusiasm, warmth, 
and excitement. New partners may feel entirely enveloped by love and caring 
at the beginning of their relationships, but, ultimately, things go terribly 
wrong.
What happens to turn a relationship so full of love and excitement into some-
thing full of pain and confusion? Well, many people with BPD fear abandon-
ment above almost anything else. Yet, at the same time, they don’t believe 
they’re worthy of getting what they really want. They can hardly imagine that 
another person truly does love them. So, when their partners inevitably fail 
to fulfill their every need, they believe the next step is abandonment. This 
conclusion fuels BPD rage, and, as a result, they push their partners away. 
Better to push someone away than to be pushed away, right? This series of 
reactions is extremely self-defeating, but it’s born out of fear, not malice. See 
Chapter 8 for more information about BPD relationships and Chapter 18 for 
how you can work to improve them.
Reckless responses
Human brains have built-in braking systems, which, in theory, are a lot like 
the ones that five-ton trucks use to slow down as they roll downhill. These 
brake systems come in handy when the trucks drive down steep mountains, 
or, in terms of the human brain, when the intensity of emotions flares up in 
certain situations. Unfortunately, most people with BPD have brake systems 
that are adequate for golf carts — not five-ton trucks — which are hardly 
enough to handle the weighty emotions that often accompany BPD.

12
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Brain brakes, as we like to call them, keep people from acting without first 
thinking about the consequences of their actions. Like rolling dice in a game 
of craps, behaving impulsively rarely results in winning in the long run. 
Common impulsive behaviors in people with BPD include the following:
 
✓ Impulsive spending
 
✓ Gambling
 
✓ Unsafe sex
 
✓ Reckless (but not wreckless) driving
 
✓ Excessive eating binges
 
✓ Alcohol or drug abuse
 
✓ Self-mutilation
 
✓ Suicidal behavior
See Chapter 5 for a tour of the dangerous, reckless world of people who have 
BPD and Chapter 15 for how to start inhibiting such impulsivity.
Yo-yo emotions
The emotional shifts of people with BPD can be as unpredictable as earth-
quakes. They can also be just as shaky and attention grabbing. After people 
with BPD unleash their emotions, they usually don’t have the ability to regain 
steady ground.
The rapidly shifting emotional ground of people with BPD causes the people 
around them to walk warily. In the same day, or even the same hour, people 
with BPD can demonstrate serenity, rage, despair, and euphoria. See Chapter 
6 for more information about this emotional drama and Chapter 16 for how to 
try to control it.
Convoluted thoughts
People with BPD also think differently than most people do. They tend to 
see situations and people in all-or-nothing, black-and-white terms with few 
shades of gray. As a result, they consider events to be either wonderful or 
awful, people in their lives to be either angels or devils, and their life status 
to be either elevated or hopeless.

13
 Chapter 1: Exploring Borderline Personality Disorder
Sometimes the thoughts of people with BPD travel even closer to the edge of 
reality. For instance, they may start thinking that other people are plotting 
against them. They may also distort reality to such a degree that they may 
seem briefly incoherent or psychotic. They sometimes feel so out of tune 
with reality that they perceive their bodies as being separate from them-
selves. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more information about the thought pro-
cesses of people who suffer from BPD and Chapter 19 for how to form more 
adaptive ways of thinking.
Exploring the Origins of BPD
If you trip over a log and break your leg, the cause of your broken leg is 
pretty obvious. And the pain in your leg will likely get better gradually as long 
as you take proper care of your leg. Similarly, if you spend the weekend with 
someone who has the flu and you get sick a couple days later, the culprit 
is pretty clear. In the case of the flu, you may have an upset stomach, body 
aches and pains, and a fever. You need to rest and drink fluids, but in a few 
days or a week, the symptoms will go away.
In contrast, BPD doesn’t seem to have a specific cause, a consistent pattern 
of symptoms, or even a consistently predictable response to treatment. 
Nevertheless, different factors do seem to combine to increase a person’s 
chances of getting BPD. These risk factors include the following:
 
✓ Trauma: People with BPD often — but not always — have histories of 
abuse, neglect, or loss.
 
✓ Genetics: BPD tends to run in families.
 
✓ Parenting: Some people with BPD report having parents who told them 
that their feelings weren’t important or accurate.
 
✓ Culture: Family instability, a culture that fosters individual needs and 
desires over those of the community, and even the angst of adolescence 
may all contribute to the high incidence of BPD in certain populations, 
at least in the Western world.
 
✓ Biology: People with BPD appear to have differences in the way their 
brains work and the way the neurons in their brains communicate.
The multiple causes of BPD should increase compassion for the people who 
suffer from the disorder because these causes prove that people don’t go 
through life asking for BPD. They acquire the disorder for reasons beyond 
their control. For more information on causes of BPD, refer to Chapter 4.

14
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Counting the Costs of BPD
BPD inflicts an amazing toll on sufferers, families, and society. For a long 
time, experts assumed that about 2 to 3 percent of the general population 
had BPD. However, recent findings suggest that this estimate may have 
greatly underestimated the extent of the problem. An extensive survey that 
appeared in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in 2008 concluded that close to 6 
percent of the population may warrant receiving this diagnosis at some point 
in their lives.
The next sections take a look at the personal costs, both physical and finan-
cial, of BPD for the people who suffer from BPD and the people who care 
about them.
 
In spite of the bleak topics we cover in the following sections, many people 
with BPD manage to have brilliant careers and live long, fairly successful lives. 
Furthermore, the passage of time typically results in reduced severity of BPD 
symptoms, and therapy can accelerate this process. In other words, don’t give 
up, because you have many reasons for hope!
Health costs
Experts consider BPD one of the most severe mental illnesses. About 10 
percent of the people with BPD eventually kill themselves, and many more 
of them seriously injure themselves in suicide attempts. Multiple studies 
conducted from the 1940s to the present have consistently found that people 
with severe mental illnesses (such as BPD) die young — shockingly, studies 
show that people with BPD live lives that are 20 to 25 years shorter than the 
lives of people without mental illnesses.
Many factors contribute to these premature deaths. First, people with mental 
disorders, including BPD, often resort to smoking cigarettes — an obvi-
ous risk factor — as a desperate coping strategy. Furthermore, people with 
mental illnesses usually have greater difficulty controlling impulses and, 
thus, find quitting even more daunting than other people do.
In addition, researchers find higher rates of obesity and diabetes among suf-
ferers of BPD — researchers now consider both of these conditions to be 
almost as bad as cigarette smoking in terms of the health risks they pose. 
Additional risks that people with BPD carry with them include heightened 
probabilities of heart disease and stroke. Unfortunately, some of the medi-
cations that mental health professionals use to treat mental illnesses make 
matters worse by leading to additional weight gain (and its accompanying 
increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes; see Chapter 20 for 
more on medications and BPD treatment). Furthermore, people with chronic 
mental illnesses usually receive inadequate basic healthcare because they 
lack financial resources.

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring Borderline Personality Disorder
Accidental death rates and death from violence are also significantly higher 
in people with mental illnesses such as BPD. Risky, impulsive behaviors may 
result in unintentional deaths because of traffic accidents, drug overdoses, or 
sexually transmitted diseases (see Chapters 8 and 15 for more on impulsivity 
and BPD). People with mental illnesses are also more likely to be homeless, 
which in turn creates additional risks due to poor nutrition, lack of health-
care, poor living conditions, and victimization.
Financial and career-related costs
BPD can exert a ruinous effect on employment and careers. People with BPD 
tend to be chronically underemployed — in part, because they may start 
out idealizing new job possibilities, only to end up disillusioned and disap-
pointed when jobs don’t live up to their inflated expectations. As we explain 
in Chapter 7, people with BPD often experience problems with knowing who 
they are, which often causes them to drift from job to job because they don’t 
know where they want to go in life. Finally, because many people with BPD 
struggle to get along with other people, they often lose or quit their jobs 
because of relationship problems in the workplace.
On the other hand, some people with BPD are highly successful in their 
careers. They may be unusually skillful and gifted. Most of these surprisingly 
accomplished people still relate to their co-workers in problematic ways. 
For example, they may misinterpret co-workers’ intentions and react to the 
slightest provocation with oversensitivity and anger. Their successful careers 
stand in stark contrast to their failed relationships.
The toll on family and friends
Marriage isn’t as common among people with BPD as it is among people with-
out the disorder. And, when people with BPD do marry, not as many of them 
choose to have children compared to the general population. Perhaps sur-
prisingly, their rate of divorce doesn’t appear to be strikingly different from 
the rate among the rest of the population.
Family members of people with BPD suffer right along with their loved 
ones. Watching their loved ones cycle through periods of self-harm, suicide 
attempts, out-of-control emotions, risky behaviors, and substance abuse isn’t 
easy. Partners, parents, and relatives often feel helpless. Friends often go 
from trying to help to walking away in frustration and anger.
Furthermore, families of people afflicted with BPD must deal with the frustra-
tions of scarce treatment programs, discrimination, and stigmatization. Even 
when families do secure treatment, the treatment process is prolonged and 
costly. Clearly, BPD casts a wide net of anguish that captures a lot of people 
in addition to its specific victims.

Treating BPD
For many decades, most therapists viewed BPD as virtually untreatable. 
Studies were few and far between, and the ones that researchers did con-
duct failed to demonstrate reliable, positive outcomes. Fortunately, the past 
20 years have produced a small handful of approaches that hold significant 
promise. Several specific types of psychotherapy appear to be the most effec-
tive forms of treatment.
Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy refers to a wide variety of methods used to help people deal 
with emotional problems as well as difficulties in their lives and relation-
ships. Psychotherapy takes place in the context of a relationship between 
a client and a therapist. Techniques involve dialogue, suggested behavior 
changes, provision of insights, communication, and skill building. A wide 
range of professionals, including social workers, counselors, marriage and 
family therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses, pro-
vide psychotherapy to some of their patients.
The effects of BPD on the healthcare system
BPD costs the worldwide healthcare system 
a lot of money, and, surprisingly, BPD possibly 
costs more money when it isn’t treated than 
when it is. Some of these costs result from the 
personal health problems that often accompany 
BPD (we describe these health issues in the 
“Health costs” section of this chapter). These 
health problems cause people with BPD to go to 
the doctor more often, and because of chronic 
underemployment, a disproportionate number 
of people with BPD receive their healthcare at 
emergency rooms, which is the priciest source 
of medical care.
BPD is associated with at least 10 percent of 
all mental health patients. We strongly suspect 
that this estimate is low because many mental 
health professionals are reluctant to assign this 
diagnosis to their patients. This reluctance is a 
direct reaction to concerns about stigmatizing 
patients as well as the fact that some insurance 
companies refuse to pay for services associ-
ated with personality disorders.
Furthermore, BPD accounts for 15 to 20 per-
cent of all inpatients in mental health hospitals. 
Inpatient mental health treatment tends to be 
extremely expensive, so costs mount quickly. 
Politicians often view these costs as prohibi-
tive — a view that results in the underfunding 
of such services. Because publically financed 
mental health treatment programs are woe-
fully inadequate, some people with BPD end up 
homeless or in prisons and jails rather than in 
hospitals or outpatient settings.

17
 Chapter 1: Exploring Borderline Personality Disorder
 
If you have BPD, you don’t want to seek just any psychotherapy because many 
approaches to psychotherapy haven’t proved effective for this particular diag-
nosis. Instead, you want to obtain therapy based on strategies that have gen-
erated at least some empirical support for their efficacy in treating BPD.
As of this writing, the psychotherapies with at least preliminary support for 
their effectiveness in treating BPD include the following (see Chapter 11 for 
more information about each of these therapies):
 
✓ Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
 
✓ Mentalization-based therapy (MBT)
 
✓ Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
✓ Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP)
 
✓ Schema therapy (ST)
Researchers have developed some of these therapies, such as DBT, specifi-
cally with BPD in mind. They’ve also modified some other traditional thera-
peutic approaches, such as CBT, to enhance their applications to BPD. After 
reviewing these approaches, we didn’t find anything inherently incompatible 
among them. In fact, we’ve been struck by how they overlap more than by 
how they diverge.
Thus, as you can see in Part IV of this book, we take an integrated approach 
to treating BPD. In other words, we select ideas and strategies from several 
of the validated treatments and use them to alleviate specific BPD-symptom 
clusters. However, we don’t explain which treatment each technique is based 
on because doing so would be too confusing. Furthermore, a few of the strat-
egies we use appear in some form in more than one treatment approach.
 
This book isn’t a comprehensive self-help book for BPD. Such a book would 
likely have double the number of pages. And, more importantly, self-help 
alone isn’t sufficient for treating BPD. However, you’re likely to find that Part 
IV, which describes different treatment approaches, provides a useful supple-
ment to therapy.
Medication
The purpose of psychotropic medications is to lessen or alleviate emotional 
pain. Prescription drugs can be lifesavers for many people with emotional 
problems. However, in the case of BPD, medications don’t seem to be as 
helpful as they are for other emotional problems. Even so, most people being 
treated for BPD take some form of medication. And sometimes they take a 
surprisingly large number of medications. Mental health professionals often 
give their patients these medications with the hope that they’ll reduce some 

18
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
of their patients’ symptoms of BPD. However, to date, research provides only 
limited support for the usefulness of using psychotropic drugs to treat BPD. 
For more about medications and BPD, refer to Chapter 20.
Many people with BPD also have other disorders, such as depression or 
anxiety disorders, that have been successfully treated with medication. Thus, 
using medications to treat other disorders in people with BPD can be a useful 
form of treatment.
Helping People Who Have BPD
If you’re a concerned friend or family member of someone with BPD, learn-
ing about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of BPD can help you better 
understand the complexity of the disorder. In Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 24, we 
provide detailed information for partners, parents, friends, and adult children 
of people with BPD. In the meantime, here are a few tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Step back and try not to take BPD behaviors personally. Realize that 
BPD makes controlling emotions a difficult task. However, people with 
BPD sometimes mistreat the people they love. By telling you not to take 
things personally, we aren’t suggesting that you allow yourself to be 
abused — either mentally or physically.
 
✓ Have a support group or therapist help you maintain your physical 
and mental health and keep your thinking clear. People with BPD can 
make the worlds of the people around them highly confusing and cha-
otic, so you need to maintain some connection to reality.
 
✓ Don’t try to be a therapist. You can’t solve the problems that your 
loved one with BPD is experiencing. In fact, you can make matters worse 
by trying to do so.
 
✓ Understand but don’t accept. You need to fully grasp what’s going on 
and why, but you also have to know your limits — don’t let someone 
with BPD run you over.
If you’re a therapist who works with people with BPD, or are hoping to do so 
at some point in your practice, check out Chapter 25 for more information on 
how to relate to patients with BPD. And don’t go at it alone; seek supervision 
or consultation — these cases can be challenging and sometimes confusing. 
Objective input from others can keep you on track.

In This Chapter

▶ Figuring out what’s healthy and what’s not
▶ Uncovering personality problems
P
ersonality — you hear that word a lot. Most people assume they know 
what it means. For example, for many of us, the following three phrases 
are easy to understand and succinctly convey considerable information 
about a person:
 
✓ She has a bubbly personality. This woman probably laughs a lot, loves 
fun, and enjoys being around people.
 
✓ He has no personality at all. This man likely comes off as flat and 
boring, and he avoids hanging around other people.
 
✓ He has an irritable personality. This man probably loses patience 
quickly and puts people off.
However, you can’t really capture a person’s complete personality in one or 
two words — or even a whole sentence. In this chapter, we explore the full 
meaning of personality. We describe which characteristics make up a healthy 
personality and which ones identify an unhealthy personality.
This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding borderline person-
ality disorder (BPD) and all the other personality disorders that we discuss 
in Chapter 3. After all, all these disorders have one thing in common — 
personality.

20
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Digging into Personality
Personality consists of broad, fairly enduring patterns of behaving, relating, 
and expressing emotions to other people. Some of these patterns are quite 
healthy and adaptive, while others are not.
The term personality comes from the Latin word persona, which means mask. 
People use masks not only to project identities they want others to perceive 
but also to conceal what actually lies beneath the surface. Personality rep-
resents an attempt to describe the core essence of a person, yet, somewhat 
like a mask, that description is determined only by what others perceive. For 
example, a girl whom others describe as “the life of the party” may feel shy 
and self-conscious inside. Thus, the personality that others perceive of this 
girl isn’t a direct reflection of her own perception. In contrast, some people 
have personalities that are quite consistent with their inner feelings and 
emotions. For example, an adolescent boy may perceive himself as the class 
clown just as his classmates do.
The next section discusses the core dimensions that distinguish a healthy 
personality from an unhealthy one.
Differentiating Healthy from Unhealthy
People with healthy personalities report considerable satisfaction with their 
lives. Others see them as well adjusted to life in general. They manage to 
obtain most of their goals, face challenges with resolve, and bounce back 
quickly from adversities.
On the other hand, people with unhealthy personalities describe their lives 
as being unfulfilled and unhappy; they’re typically unsatisfied with what life 
has to offer them. Others usually see people with unhealthy personalities 
as poorly adjusted. These folks struggle to control their emotions, and they 
often have difficulty relating effectively to other people. People with any one 
of the personality disorders we describe in Chapter 3 have at least one of the 
characteristics of an unhealthy personality and relatively few of the qualities 
of a healthy personality.
However, the line between healthy and unhealthy isn’t as black and white as 
you may think. Most people, even those with healthy personalities, present 
a mix of healthy and unhealthy qualities. Almost everyone struggles in some 
areas of life from time to time. You can visualize healthy and unhealthy per-
sonalities as lying along a continuum. The following dimensions of personal-
ity play a role in whether a personality is healthy or unhealthy:

21
 Chapter 2: Defining Personality to Understand BPD
 
✓ Flexibility
 
✓ Emotional regulation
 
✓ Ability to delay gratification
 
✓ Dependability
 
✓ Interpersonal effectiveness
 
✓ Emotional resiliency
 
✓ Self-acceptance
 
✓ Accurate perception of reality
 
✓ Moderation
These core dimensions that distinguish healthy from unhealthy personali-
ties interact with one another. Thus, people who are quick to anger (in other 
words, people who lack the ability to regulate emotions) usually also struggle 
to keep friends (in other words, they have low interpersonal effectiveness). 
Consequently, after people acquire one or two unhealthy personality traits, 
they’re quick to develop more unhealthy behaviors. The following sections 
describe these dimensions in detail.
Flexibility: Rolling with the punches
Habits govern a large part of people’s lives. For example, you likely sleep 
on the same side of the bed every night. Perhaps you have a routine for get-
ting ready for work in the morning. You get up, turn the coffee pot on, take a 
shower, read the paper, and eat breakfast — every day in the same sequence, 
on autopilot. Habits are good because they allow you to do things more 
quickly without having to think every action through.
On the other hand, sometimes circumstances call for flexibility. For example, 
in most countries, you drive on the right side of the road. But if you drive on 
the right side of the road in Great Britain, you’ll likely end up in a head-on col-
lision. For those of you who’ve tried driving in a country that uses a different 
side of the road than your own country, you know how awkward the change 
feels. You have to maintain vigilance and care so that you don’t fall back to 
your old habits.
However, most people manage to make the adjustment. The ability to adapt 
to changing conditions is flexibility. If you can’t make such changes, you’re at 
a disadvantage in life. Flexibility is a key dimension of a healthy personality.

22
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Life frequently demands some degree of flexibility. For example, when we 
walk along the road in Corrales, New Mexico, we habitually say hi and smile 
at the people we encounter. The people of Corrales expect this courtesy. In 
contrast, when we walk the sidewalks in New York City, we pass hundreds of 
people without offering a greeting or even making eye contact. People in New 
York expect this action, too. If we rigidly adhere to our New Mexico style in 
New York, people may view us suspiciously.
The people whose personalities are marked by rigidity and inflexibility 
struggle to adapt to changing expectations. This inflexibility or inadaptability 
is one dimension of an unhealthy personality. For example, an inflexible man 
may adhere to strict time schedules for daily activities, such as getting up 
and having his meals at the same times every day. These schedules work well 
for him until he goes on vacation with several friends. He gets angry when his 
friends want to sleep in a little later than he usually does and have meals at 
different times each day. His rigid rules and anger annoy his friends.
Emotional regulation: Controlling 
what you express
People with healthy personalities possess the ability to modulate their emo-
tions, which means they express emotions at appropriate times in appropri-
ate ways — not that they’re emotionless. They may cry at a sad movie or 
laugh out loud at a comedy. They may feel anger, but they express it smartly. 
For example, they may be angry with a police officer who gives them what 
they see as an unjust ticket, but they don’t punch the officer in the face.
On the other hand, people with unhealthy personalities may lack the ability 
to control their emotions. Irritation easily morphs into rage. Laughter esca-
lates to hysteria. Anxiety leads to panic. For some people with unhealthy per-
sonalities, unbridled emotions rule their lives.
 
Having the ability to control one’s emotions carries significant benefits to 
one’s physical health. People who have the ability to moderate their emotions 
also tend to have
 
✓ Less physical pain
 
✓ Better cardiovascular health
 
✓ Improved immune system functioning
 
✓ Prolonged life expectancy

23
 Chapter 2: Defining Personality to Understand BPD
Ability to delay gratification: 
Controlling impulses
People with healthy personalities have the ability to persist at tasks and wait 
for rewards. They know how to save for a rainy day. They improve the qual-
ity of their lives through long-term planning and hard work. They know how 
to tolerate frustration and even discomfort when they’re working toward 
their greater goals.
A hallmark of an unhealthy personality is the inability to wait for gratifica-
tion. In fact, much of what people think of as immoral involves a failure to 
control impulses. Consider six of the seven deadly sins. Gluttony refers to 
excessive consumption and pleasure. Sloth is laziness and lack of discipline. 
Lust, greed, and envy all consist of unrestrained desire, which in the absence 
of self-control, leads to immoral behavior. And anger without self-control 
results in violence.
Dependability: Doing what 
you say you’ll do
Another characteristic of a healthy personality is dependability, or conscien-
tiousness. Dependable people do what they say they’ll do. They’re reliable, 
disciplined, and motivated. They approach tasks with zeal, enthusiasm, and 
thoroughness. As you can imagine, they accomplish more than the people 
who lack this trait do.
In contrast, people with unhealthy personalities may have little motivation. 
They frequently have great plans and ambitions, but they often do little 
to follow through with them. Other people may not be willing to count on 
them. Their lack of dependability and motivation usually prevents them from 
achieving significant success.
Interpersonal effectiveness: 
Having good relationships
People with healthy personalities often enjoy good relationships. Others 
see them as both agreeable and friendly. People who exhibit interpersonal 
effectiveness trust others without excessive suspiciousness, but they don’t 
approach relationships with naiveté. They’re skilled at accurately perceiving 
the motivations, feelings, and perspectives of other people. They seek and 
allow closeness with others while maintaining their own autonomy. They end 
relationships that become toxic, but they work hard to maintain connections 
with the people they value.

24
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
On the other hand, people with unhealthy personalities often have a hard 
time maintaining, or even beginning, close relationships. For instance, some 
people avoid relationships altogether — they usually distrust others and 
keep them at a distance. Others exhibit the opposite problem from avoidance 
and become extremely dependent on their close relationships. As a result, 
they often feel extremely insecure in their relationships and feel anxious, 
clingy, and jealous. They often lack the ability to understand other people’s 
views.
 
Psychologists have studied the way infants respond to their primary caregiv-
ers. Some infants demonstrate what’s known as an anxious or ambivalent 
attachment style — responding with sadness when their caregivers depart 
and ambivalence, anger, and reluctance when their caregivers return. Other 
infants exhibit an avoidant attachment style and show little distress when 
their caregivers leave; they often appear aloof when their caregivers return. In 
contrast, infants with a secure attachment style show distress and are upset 
when their caregivers depart, but they’re easily consoled when they return. 
You can see similar attachment styles in people’s relationships throughout 
life, although people may change their attachment styles at different points in 
their lives. People with healthy personalities often exhibit the secure attach-
ment style, while people with unhealthy personalities often exhibit either the 
anxious or avoidant attachment styles.
Emotional resiliency: Bouncing 
back from tough breaks
Setbacks, adversity, and even trauma befall everyone throughout life. People 
with healthy personalities have resiliency, or the ability to bounce back. 
After they encounter disappointments or tragedies, they’re better able to 
collect their resources and move forward than people without this ability. 
Emotionally resilient people persist even when recovery takes a long time 
and requires intense effort.
Of course, some events are so horrific or traumatic that recovery remains 
out of reach even for those people with extremely healthy personalities. 
However, people with healthy personalities are more likely than others to 
accept their fate with courage — they don’t go down without a fight.
In contrast, people with unhealthy personalities often recover from adversity 
slowly — if at all. They tend to focus on the unfairness, injustice, and awful-
ness of their plights. They have a very limited range of coping abilities. They 
often see themselves as victims in need of rescue.

25
 Chapter 2: Defining Personality to Understand BPD
Self-acceptance: Seeing yourself 
as you really are
People with healthy personalities view themselves in a manner similar to the 
way in which others perceive them. They appreciate their strengths, but they 
also accept their faults. They neither bask in their own glory nor wallow in 
self-deprecation.
On the other hand, people with unhealthy personalities often think about 
themselves in extreme terms. They tend to see themselves as either all good 
or all bad. For example, a narcissist — someone who puts himself on a pedes-
tal in relation to other people — exhibits one of the extreme self-views that 
an unhealthy personality may have. By contrast, other people have extremely 
low self-esteem and think of themselves as beneath everyone else, worthy 
of nothing but loathing and despair. Still others flip between these two 
extremes. See Chapter 7 for more information on how the issue of instability 
plays out for people with BPD.
 
Several decades ago, a number of psychologists promoted the idea that seeing 
yourself as better than reality was actually a sign of psychological health. 
They believed that possessing an inflated, overly positive self-esteem helped 
people achieve more, feel better, and have more friends. However, a variety of 
studies since then strongly suggests that psychologically healthy folks have a 
generally positive, accurate view of themselves that is neither self-aggrandizing 
nor self-critical.
Accurate perception of reality: 
Seeing the world as it is
People with healthy personalities tend to see the world around them accu-
rately. They view people and events as they are. They don’t view life’s ugli-
ness through rose-colored glasses, and they don’t gloss over unpleasantries. 
They take occurrences at face value and don’t read negative meaning into 
other people’s intentions. Thus, they rarely personalize comments unless 
clearly warranted.
For example, imagine that a friend tells you she can’t go with you to a movie. 
If you have a healthy personality, you’re likely to assume your friend has a 
good reason for not going with you. You wouldn’t see your friend’s intention 
as a personal slight. But, if that friend says she’ll never go to another movie 
with you again because she hates you, you likely — and reasonably — feel 
personally insulted.

26
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
As you probably guessed, people with unhealthy personalities often do quite 
the opposite. They magnify negative events and frequently discount positive 
happenings. They tend to think in terms of black and white, good or bad, and 
all or nothing. They have either exquisite sensitivity to criticism or blatant 
disregard for the feelings and rights of other people.
Moderation: Avoiding extremes
Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States, extolled 
the virtue of moderation and counseled people to avoid extremes. Similarly, 
many psychologists have advocated moderation for a healthy personality. 
For example, someone with a healthy personality is neither overly intro-
verted nor excessively extroverted.
Paradoxically, achieving moderation is sometimes more difficult than swing-
ing between extremes, especially for people with unhealthy personalities. 
Thus, for many people, going from starvation diets to binge eating is easier 
than consuming food moderately. For others, completely abstaining from 
alcohol is far easier than drinking in moderation. This inability to achieve 
moderation is another dimension of an unhealthy personality.
Even good qualities become unhealthy when taken to the extreme. Honesty, 
courage, and generosity all sound like positive attributes. Yet, more isn’t 
always better. Too much courage makes people take unnecessary risks, 
excessive generosity can easily be taken advantage of, and being overly 
honest may offend others. People with healthy personalities have many good 
qualities, but they avoid extremes — often unlike their counterparts.

B
orderline personality disorder (BPD) provokes anger, angst, and agony 
in the people it afflicts. Their families and friends suffer, too. BPD mani-
fests as a complex mix of long-standing patterns of thinking, behaving, and 
feeling that destroy happiness, relationships, and productivity. Furthermore, 
people with this disorder have trouble controlling impulses, relating to 
others, handling emotional disturbances, and, at times, perceiving reality.
In this chapter, we describe the signs and symptoms of BPD. We give you 
examples of how these symptoms torment people who have BPD and those 
who care about them. We also explore the nature of other personality disor-
ders, including histrionic, narcissistic, schizotypal, and antisocial. You may 
be surprised to find that people often show signs of more than one person-
ality disorder. Finally, we discuss other types of emotional problems that 
aren’t part of BPD but that sometimes occur in conjunction with BPD.
The Nine Symptoms of BPD
Knowing whether you or someone you know has BPD requires careful scru-
tiny and input from a trained mental health professional. However, even 
professionals struggle with making this diagnosis because the symptoms of 
BPD vary dramatically from person to person. In a way, BPD is similar to the 
countless breeds of dogs that exist today. For example, cocker spaniels, ter-
riers, Bernese mountain dogs, pit bulls, Russian wolfhounds, golden doodles, 
mutts, and Chihuahuas differ strikingly from each other, but they’re all dogs. 
Likewise, people with BPD don’t share all the same symptoms, but they do all 
have the same disorder.

28
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
People who suffer from BPD experience a range of symptoms, which mental 
health professionals group into nine major categories. Currently, to be diag-
nosed with BPD, you must show signs of at least five of these nine symptoms.
1. Sensation seeking (impulsivity)
To count as a sign of BPD, this sensation-seeking symptom has to involve a 
minimum of two types of impulsive, self-destructive behaviors. These impul-
sive behaviors trigger adrenaline rushes and intense excitement and include 
the following:
 
✓ Sexual acting out
 
✓ Substance abuse
 
✓ Uncontrolled spending sprees
 
✓ Binge eating
 
✓ Reckless behavior, including
 
• Highly aggressive driving
 
• Extreme sports
 
• Shoplifting
 
• Destruction of property
The impulsive behaviors we’re talking about here are both risky and self-
damaging. They often endanger the lives and well-beings of the people who 
exhibit them. For instance, sexual acting out may consist of frequent, casual, 
unprotected sexual encounters with complete strangers, which can lead to 
STDs or unwanted pregnancies. Uncontrolled spending sprees can involve 
numerous, unnecessary purchases that max out credit cards and pile up 
debt. Shoplifting often involves stealing items strictly for excitement and can 
lead to jail time.
2. Self-harm
Self-harm is a particularly common and conspicuous symptom in people with 
BPD. People who exhibit this symptom may threaten or attempt suicide and 
do so often. Others may deliberately burn themselves with cigarettes, slice 
their arms with sharp blades, bang their heads, mutilate their skin, or even 
break bones in their hands or bodies. Although this symptom is separate 
from sensation seeking, it also involves a certain level of impulsivity. People 
who exhibit this symptom have to be impulsive enough to try to kill them-
selves again and again. Chapter 5 describes symptoms 1 and 2 in more detail.

29
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
 
A common misperception is that suicidal threats rarely lead to real suicide 
attempts. In truth, though, you need to take any threat of suicide by a person 
(whether he’s suffering from BPD or not) seriously and seek professional help 
immediately.
3. Roller coaster emotions
People with BPD experience extreme emotional swings. They may feel on top 
of the world one moment and plunge into deep despair the next. These mood 
swings are intense but usually transient, lasting only a few minutes or hours. 
The emotional flip-flops often occur in response to seemingly trivial triggers.
For example, a co-worker passes by someone with BPD in the hallway with-
out acknowledging her. This unintentional slight can spark powerful anxiety 
and distress in the person with BPD. Most people who are in a relationship 
with someone who has BPD find that these mood swings are quite difficult to 
understand or accept.
4. Explosiveness
Dramatic bouts of anger and rage frequently plague people with BPD. Again, 
the events that trigger these rages may seem inconsequential to other 
people. As you can imagine, these explosions often wreak havoc in relation-
ships and may even result in physical confrontations. People with BPD some-
times end up in legal entanglements because of their outrageous behavior. 
Road rage is a good example of this symptom of BPD, although not everyone 
who exhibits road rage has BPD.
5. Worries about abandonment
People who exhibit this symptom obsess over the fear that a loved one will 
leave them. Their terror over abandonment may cause them to appear clingy, 
dependent, and outrageously jealous. For example, a husband with BPD may 
check his wife’s cellphone logs, e-mails, and car odometer readings daily, 
always looking for evidence of infidelity. Paradoxically, the obsession with 
keeping loved ones close usually drives them away.
6. Unclear and unstable self-concept
This symptom describes a failure to find a stable, clear sense of identity. 
People who exhibit this symptom may view themselves quite favorably at 
times, yet, at other times, they exude self-disdain. They often have little idea 

30
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
of what they want in life and lack a clear sense of values or purpose. Frequent 
changes in jobs, religion, or sexual identity may reflect shifting values and 
goals. Navigating life without a clear self-concept is like trying to find your 
way across the ocean with no compass.
7. Emptiness
Many people with BPD report feeling painfully empty inside. They have crav-
ings for something more, but they can’t identify what that something more is. 
They feel bored, lonely, and unfulfilled. They may attempt to fill their needs 
with superficial sex, drugs, or food, but nothing ever seems truly satisfying — 
they feel like they’re trying to fill a black hole.
8. Up-and-down relationships
Relationships involving people with BPD resemble revolving doors. People 
with BPD often see other people as either all good or all bad, and these judg-
ments can flip from day to day or even from hour to hour.
People afflicted with BPD often fall in love quickly and intensely. They place 
new loves on pedestals, but their pedestals collapse when the slightest disap-
pointments (whether real or imagined) inevitably occur. People in relation-
ships with people who have BPD (whether they’re lovers, co-workers, or 
friends) experience emotional whiplash from the frequent changes from idol-
ization to demonization. As a result, many people find difficulty in maintain-
ing meaningful relationships with those who have BPD.
9. Dissociation: Feeling out 
of touch with reality
Professionals describe dissociation as a sense of unrealness. People who 
feel dissociated or out of touch with reality say they feel like they’re looking 
down at themselves and watching their lives unfold without being a real part 
of them.
When people with BPD lose touch with reality, they usually don’t do so for 
long periods of time. But sometimes when they lose touch with reality, they 
hear voices telling them what to do. At other times, they may suffer from 
intense, unwarranted mistrust of others.

31
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
 
As you can no doubt see, these signs and symptoms overlap and feed on each 
other. Thus, if someone explodes with little or no provocation, demonstrates 
unusual moodiness, and clings excessively to his loved ones, you can under-
stand why that person’s relationships suffer. And when relationships go 
poorly, self-concept can plummet.
In the next section, we show you examples of people with BPD who have 
some prominent BPD symptoms (enough to warrant a diagnosis of BPD), but 
who show no signs of other key symptoms.
Diagnosing BPD: Like Ordering 
from a Chinese Menu
Because a diagnosis of BPD requires only five of nine major symptoms, you 
can come up with dozens of combinations using different sets of five symp-
toms. For example, one person can have symptoms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, while 
another has symptoms 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Even with different symptoms, both 
people can receive an accurate diagnosis of BPD. To better understand this 
idea, consider the following three examples of people, all of whom carry the 
diagnosis of BPD.
Renee, a 42-year-old single parent of an 18-month-old boy, has three older 
children, whom their grandparents are raising. She feels unable to take 
care of the older kids. Her four children all have different fathers. Renee 
has been hospitalized five times for suicide attempts — each attempt 
coming after a breakup and subsequent alcohol binges. She fears she 
can’t live without a man, yet she has never maintained a relationship for 
more than a year. She frequents local bars and goes home with strangers 
at the drop of a hat.
Renee excelled in school. She attended four different colleges but never 
completed her degree in mass communications. She has jumped from job 
to job and has no life direction or career path. She doesn’t know what she 
wants out of life. Sometimes she basks in the attention she receives from 
men, but at other times, she feels worthless because of her inability to 
parent. Renee does seem fairly stable at times — especially when she’s 
pregnant.
Renee demonstrates the following symptoms of BPD (refer to the complete 
list of symptoms in the section “The Nine Symptoms of BPD”):
 
1. Sensation seeking: Renee binges on alcohol and engages in unsafe sex.
 
2. Self-harm: Renee has attempted suicide multiple times.
 
5. Worries about abandonment: Renee desperately believes that she 
needs a man in her life to survive.

32
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
 
6. Unclear and unstable self-concept: Renee lacks goals and direction. She 
alternates between feeling good about her worth as a sexual woman and 
disdain about her inability to parent.
 
8. Up-and-down relationships: Renee has had many tumultuous relation-
ships, none lasting more than a year.
In spite of her many problems, Renee manages to keep her temper in check. 
She doesn’t feel particularly empty or bored, nor does she experience feel-
ings of being out of touch with reality. Her day-to-day moods remain fairly 
stable with the sole exception of when she feels abandoned.
Frank’s story below illustrates a different set of symptoms, yet he has the 
same BPD diagnosis as Renee.
Frank, a 34-year-old carpenter, loses his temper with little provocation. 
Although he’s a highly skilled craftsman, he can’t hold a consistent job 
because of his frequent outbursts. He lost his last full-time job after he 
threw a screwdriver at a co-worker. Now he picks up odd jobs wher-
ever he can. Frank’s moods swing from neutral to anxious, to dread, to 
anger, to dark depression — all in the course of a single afternoon. Frank 
believes in various conspiracy theories and worries that the government 
is plotting to control the minds of all its citizens.
At times he seems lost in his own world. Although he feels lonely and 
empty, he has never dated anyone or shown interest in relationships. 
When feeling especially down, he cuts himself with a razor blade until he 
bleeds. He wears long pants and long-sleeved shirts to hide the numerous 
ugly scars on his arms and legs. He reports that the cutting calms him 
down.
Frank has the following five symptoms of BPD:
 
2. Self-harm: Frank cuts his arms and legs with a razor blade until he 
bleeds.
 
3. Roller coaster emotions: Frank rarely feels good emotionally, but his 
moods run out of control. At times, he dwells on his anxieties; at other 
times, he feels consumed by deep depression.
 
4. Explosiveness: Frank loses control of his temper.
 
7. Emptiness: Although lonely, Frank neither seeks nor desires the com-
pany of others. He feels empty and unfulfilled, but he has little idea of 
what can improve his situation.
 
9. Dissociation (feeling out of touch with reality): Frank distrusts people 
and has paranoid beliefs that the government is out to get everyone.

33
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
As you can see, Frank presents quite a different picture from Renee. Unlike 
Renee, he doesn’t care about relationships or fear abandonment. He has little 
concern for his self-worth, and he doesn’t seek excitement and sensation 
through sex, drugs, alcohol, or reckless driving.
Maria, like Frank and Renee, also has a diagnosis of BPD, yet she has her own 
unique mix of symptoms.
Maria, a 28-year-old insurance saleswoman, wins clients easily with her 
charm. She talks glibly and develops many superficially close relation-
ships. She turns her clients into instant best friends. She puts these new 
friends on pedestals but dismisses them as demons when they fail to 
meet her lofty expectations. When she blows up at her friends, she has 
no awareness of her viciousness. After her outbursts, she desperately 
tries to make amends by buying gifts and showering her friends with 
attention. However, her friends eventually hit the road when Maria con-
tinues to lose control.
When she makes a sale, Maria often invites the entire office out for dinner 
and drinks, blowing her hard-won commission. Although Maria earns a 
lot of money, she maxes out her credit cards and teeters on the edge of 
bankruptcy. Maria has a weight problem and binges on ice cream when 
she feels lonely. She follows her binges with starvation diets, but they 
don’t last long. Her moods go up and down like a yo-yo.
Maria demonstrates the following five symptoms of BPD:
 
1. Sensation seeking: Maria goes on uncontrolled spending sprees and has 
episodes of binge eating.
 
3. Roller coaster emotions: Maria overreacts to both positive and negative 
events. Her emotions run out of control.
 
4. Explosiveness: Maria blows up at her co-workers and friends. She 
doesn’t understand the impact she has on others.
 
5. Worries about abandonment: Although she’s unaware of how she 
pushes other people away, Maria desperately tries to get them back 
when they leave.
 
8. Up-and-down relationships: Maria knows when and how to draw people 
in — during the early stages of a relationship. But when people disap-
point her, she reacts with rage.
On the other hand, Maria doesn’t cut herself or threaten suicide. Her self-
concept remains reasonably stable from day to day. She doesn’t dwell on 
feelings of emptiness, and she doesn’t hear voices or suffer from paranoia.

Evolving approaches to diagnosing BPD
Great controversy surrounds the diagnoses for 
all personality disorders. In particular, mental 
health professionals like to argue about the 
diagnosis of BPD. The fact that different indi-
viduals with BPD can present such varying pic-
tures has led many professionals to advocate 
alternative approaches to the diagnosis. Some 
professionals believe that part of the diagnostic 
problem relates to the term borderline.
Adolph Stern, an early American psychoanalyst, 
coined the term borderline in 1938 to describe 
patients who seemed to lie on the border 
between neurosis and psychosis. Neurosis, a 
concept popularized by Freudian psychology at 
the turn of the 20th century, describes a variety 
of emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and 
distress. These troubling emotions ostensibly 
stem from unconscious conflict. Psychosis, on 
the other hand, describes a loss of contact with 
reality, such as hallucinations, delusions, and 
serious problems with rational thought.
Whether mental health professionals will retain 
the term borderline is unclear at the time of this 
book’s writing because professionals seem to 
be moving toward a narrower definition of BPD. 
BPD experts, Dr. John Gunderson and Dr. Mary 
Zanarini, have developed an interview (called 
the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients 
Revised) to use for the diagnosis of BPD. In brief, 
the Gunderson-Zanarini approach focuses on 
the following four symptoms:
 ✓ Unstable relationships: The relationships 
of people with BPD tend to be quite stormy 
and manipulative; they’re often charac-
terized by entitlement, a habit for being 
demanding, and quick flips from idealization 
to demonization.
 ✓ Mood instability: The moods of people 
with BPD show heightened sensitivity to 
events and often shift from one mood to 
another because of misperceptions of 
other people’s intentions. A sense of empti-
ness, anger, anxiety, and rage are common 
as a result of this issue. People with BPD 
have great difficulty bringing their emotions 
back to a normal state after they’re out of 
control.
 ✓ Impulsivity: People with BPD often act 
without thinking in the form of reckless-
ness, self-mutilation, suicide attempts, and/
or sensation seeking.
 ✓ Cognitive impairments: People with BPD 
often have distortions in perceptions and 
thoughts. Feelings of intense distrust, hal-
lucinations, and delusions are part of this 
symptom.
The Gunderson-Zanarini approach essentially 
collapses the usual nine symptoms of BPD into 
four major categories. Their approach rec-
ommends using the term BPD only for those 
people who exhibit all these symptom clusters. 
However, the mental health field hasn’t yet 
reached a consensus for how to diagnose BPD. 
We, therefore, choose to use the current nine-
symptom perspective throughout this book. 
But we do recognize that a narrower (or com-
pletely different) definition will likely emerge in 
the future. Regardless of the ultimate diagnostic 
criteria that professionals agree on, treatment 
strategies are likely to remain consistent with 
the ones we describe in this book.

35
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
 
Renee, Frank, and Maria all exhibit the minimum of five symptoms of BPD, 
and, as a result, they all receive the BPD diagnosis. However, most people with 
BPD have more than five symptoms. Furthermore, the vast majority of people 
with BPD also have one or more other personality disorders. See the “Other 
Personality Disorders” and “Emotional Disorders that Accompany BPD” sec-
tions of this chapter for an understanding of these other emotional issues.
Other Personality Disorders
People with personality disorders of any type have trouble with day-to-day 
living. Their emotions are out of sync, and they relate poorly to other people. 
In general, they don’t seem very happy.
Mental health professionals have ten distinct labels for describing the various 
personality disorders as listed in DSM IV. Each label comes with a specific list 
of symptoms, but symptoms listed for one personality disorder often overlap 
with symptoms for another disorder. People with BPD almost always carry 
one or more additional personality disorder diagnoses. Therefore, someone 
with BPD may exhibit a dizzying array of symptoms, some of which are part 
of BPD while others are part of another personality disorder diagnosis.
To help you make sense of this dizzying array of symptoms and disorders, 
the next section reviews each personality disorder in detail. The personality 
disorders we discuss in the following sections currently fall into three major 
groupings:
 
✓ Odd and eccentric
 
✓ Dramatic and erratic
 
✓ Anxious and fearful
The odd and eccentric
No doubt you’ve met people who have one or more of the personality dis-
orders in the odd and eccentric grouping — paranoid personality disorder, 
schizotypal personality disorder, or schizoid personality disorder. However, 
you may not have paid much attention to them because people with this kind 
of personality disorder don’t have much need for other people. In fact, some-
times they aren’t interested in people at all. They have a lower need for social 
contact than most people, and their thoughts are often somewhat distorted 
in that they perceive events differently than most people do.
The following sections take a look at each disorder individually.

36
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Paranoid personality disorder
Paranoid personality disorder is a surprisingly common disorder, afflicting 
as much as 4 to 5 percent of the general population. Researchers think that 
genetics play a significant role in the development of this disorder. People 
with paranoid personality disorder look at their world with suspicion and 
mistrust. They typically
 
✓ Feel mistreated by others
 
✓ Hold grudges for a long time
 
✓ Criticize and judge others harshly
 
✓ Assume that most people are out to get them
 
✓ Feel like outcasts
 
✓ Doubt the loyalty of friends, partners, family, and lovers
 
✓ Feel jealous and frantically search for signs of betrayal
People with paranoid personality disorder often interpret neutral events as 
harmful. Thus, they harbor a great deal of resentment and hostility, and they 
typically blame others for their problems.
In spite of the seriousness of this disorder, these individuals rarely seek 
mental health treatment unless they’re referred by the courts or their prob-
lems cause them considerable distress. For the most part, they don’t trust 
other people — friends, lovers, acquaintances, or therapists — so they don’t 
see a purpose in seeking help from others. They believe that any information 
they divulge to therapists will be used against them. Furthermore, they’re 
driven to appear strong and autonomous and, thus, see therapy as a sign of 
weakness.
 
The ninth criteria for BPD is feeling out of touch with reality, which can 
include feelings of paranoia. However, feelings of paranoia aren’t an especially 
prominent sign of BPD. You can have diagnoses of both paranoid personality 
disorder and BPD if your behavior shows strong signs of both disorders.
Schizoid personality disorder
Schizoid personality disorder affects about 1 to 3 percent of the population. 
Once again, genetics appear to play an important role and account for as 
much as half the risk for developing this disorder.
People with schizoid personality disorder are quintessential loners. They 
don’t have close friendships, and they don’t desire them. Other people con-
sider them to be outcasts, and they rarely connect with their own families. 
They have poor social skills and don’t understand the nuances of social inter-
actions. Their emotions are flat and detached. They don’t care about praise 
or criticism.

37
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
Furthermore, people with this diagnosis prefer to do almost everything by 
themselves. They derive little pleasure from most activities that other people 
enjoy, especially those that stimulate the senses, such as the following:
 
✓ Watching a sunset
 
✓ Listening to the ocean
 
✓ Hiking in the mountains
 
✓ Receiving or giving a hug
 
✓ Having sex with another person
If people with schizoid personality disorder work, they choose jobs beneath 
their abilities because they lack motivation. Like those with paranoid per-
sonality disorder, people with schizoid personality disorder don’t often seek 
mental health services. They see no reason to seek help because they don’t 
feel particularly dissatisfied with their lives. Left to their own devices, they 
live relatively quiet, aloof lives.
 
Autism is a spectrum of diagnoses in children that describes a wide range of 
difficulties with social interactions and restricted interests. Children with the 
milder diagnoses in the autism spectrum (specifically Asperger’s disorder and 
pervasive developmental disorder) exhibit several of the same characteristics 
as people who have schizoid personality disorder as adults. Researchers have 
yet to study this issue in depth, but many mental health professionals believe 
that adults with schizoid personality disorder may have had one of the milder 
forms of autism as children.
Schizotypal personality disorder
People with schizotypal personality disorder share a major commonality with 
those who have schizoid personality disorder — they avoid close relation-
ships and lack social skills. However, people with schizotypal personality 
disorder tend to have more anxiety in social situations than people with 
schizoid personality disorder. Furthermore, people with schizotypal person-
ality disorder are far more noticeable to others because they have a variety 
of very odd or eccentric behaviors and thoughts. Examples of this striking 
strangeness include
 
✓ Beliefs that events in the world revolve around them — newspaper 
headlines, television (TV) news, and so on.
 
✓ Magical thinking such as strong superstitious feelings, bizarre fantasies, 
and belief in telepathy.
 
 Thoughts or beliefs that are a part of a person’s culture don’t count as 
magical thinking.
 
✓ Strange perceptions about their bodies, such as feeling like their hands 
are controlled by outside forces.

38
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
 
✓ Unusual speech or thoughts that others find hard to follow because of 
vagueness or overuse of metaphors.
 
✓ Paranoia (once again, symptoms from various personality disorders 
have a way of showing up in more than one disorder).
How these symptoms affect the lives of people with this disorder varies 
greatly from person to person. However, the following story gives you a 
glimpse of what someone with schizotypal personality disorder may look 
like.
Charlie, who is 37 years old, is known in his neighborhood as The Cap 
Man. He lives alone in a rundown mobile home in his uncle’s backyard. 
His nickname refers to the many different baseball caps he wears wher-
ever he goes. He owns hats from each major league baseball team and 
wears the hats in a particular order that only he understands. Charlie 
believes that the major league players depend on him for advice and that 
he must wear certain hats to communicate with them during plays. He 
has a cable system that allows him to watch all the games, and he spends 
hours alone watching baseball.
Charlie receives a disability check each month because of his mental ill-
ness. He has received multiple diagnoses since he was in school, includ-
ing mental retardation, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Recently, he 
was evaluated and diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder.
Charlie has a case manager who helps him buy groceries and keeps track 
of his health because, without someone to help him, Charlie spends all 
his time sorting through his hat collection or watching TV. His case man-
ager has referred Charlie for treatment, but Charlie refuses.
 
Charlie’s case reflects the challenges of diagnosing some mental disorders. 
Although he fits a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, at times in 
his life, he seemed even more out of touch with reality and was diagnosed 
with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is considered a more serious condition that 
frequently involves delusions, severely disordered thinking, and/or hallucina-
tions. The line between the two disorders can be very fine, even for experi-
enced mental health professionals.
The dramatic and erratic
People with personality disorders in the dramatic and erratic grouping are 
hard not to notice. This group includes antisocial personality disorder, BPD, 
histrionic personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder. People 
with these disorders draw attention to themselves either by extreme seduc-
tiveness, hostile aggression, excessive emotionality, shocking violation of 
rules, or self-aggrandizing behavior — all of which they typically exhibit with-
out thinking.

39
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
These individuals exhibit striking self-centeredness and have difficulty grasp-
ing how other people feel. Although BPD belongs in this grouping of personal-
ity disorders, we don’t describe it here because we cover it in much greater 
detail in the section, “The Nine Symptoms of BPD.”
Antisocial personality disorder
Antisocial personality disorder afflicts about 2 percent of the general popula-
tion, with men significantly outnumbering women. However, if you go to a 
prison, you may find that as many as 50 to 80 percent of the inmates have 
this disorder. You don’t want to run into someone with this disorder in a 
back alley, but, if you do, run.
People with antisocial personality disorder have little regard for other 
people, their rights, or their feelings. They blatantly break society’s rules and 
frequently end up in jail. Many of them act with extreme violence with no 
remorse for their actions or compassion for their victims.
On the other hand, some people with antisocial personality disorder aren’t 
particularly aggressive, but they may derive a sadistic sense of pleasure 
from conning other people. A small percentage of these people even manage 
to become CEOs of major corporations — but they do so through exploita-
tion and manipulation. Paradoxically, they often exude charm and charisma. 
Typical symptoms of antisocial personality disorder include the following 
characteristics (for more about how this disorder can be confused with BPD, 
especially in men, see the “Gender in the diagnosis of BPD” section of this 
chapter):
 
✓ Irresponsible
 
✓ Deceitful
 
✓ Dishonest
 
✓ Impulsive
 
✓ Aggressive
 
✓ Irritable
 
✓ Indifferent
 
✓ Guiltless
People with antisocial personality disorder care more about maintaining 
their power and image than being in close, long-term relationships. At first, 
they may shower you with affection, but they leave the relationship the 
moment they feel bored or when you no longer serve their purpose. The 
antisocial personality disorder is what has prompted so many people to run 
background checks after meeting new potential employees, clients, or even 
dates.

40
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Histrionic personality disorder
Although only about 2 percent of the general population has histrionic per-
sonality disorder, you may think the percentage should be higher because 
you rarely forget people with this disorder. They seek attention like rising 
Hollywood stars.
Some common characteristics of people with histrionic personality disorder 
include the following:
 
✓ Uneasiness when they’re not receiving attention
 
✓ Excessive emphasis on physical appearance
 
✓ Extremely dramatic or provocative dress
 
✓ Sexually seductive behavior
 
✓ Exaggerated show of emotions
 
✓ Speaking style that attempts to impress but lacks substance
 
✓ Feelings of neediness, dependency, and helplessness
 
✓ Shallow and rapidly changing emotions
People with histrionic personality disorder are experts at flattery and flirta-
tion, so people often find them quite interesting and attractive in the begin-
ning. But over time, their self-centeredness wears thin, and their shallowness 
reveals itself.
Narcissistic personality disorder
Narcissistic personality disorder afflicts about 1 percent of the general popula-
tion. People with narcissistic personality disorder, like those with histrionic 
personality disorder, crave attention. However, people with narcissistic per-
sonality disorder feel unusually self-important and entitled to special treat-
ment from everyone else. They come off as arrogant and haughty.
Common characteristics of people with narcissistic personality disorder 
include:
 
✓ Consumed with self-importance
 
✓ Absorbed in their specialness
 
✓ Without empathy
 
✓ Exploitive
 
✓ Competitive
 
✓ Envious

41
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
People with narcissistic personality disorder treat others more like an audi-
ence than as real people. They fantasize that they have special talents or will 
achieve great fame or fortune. We bet you can think of someone you know 
who has a similar problem.
The anxious and fearful
This group of personality disorders is primarily characterized by anxiety, 
fear, shyness, withdrawal, and overconcern for the opinions of others. These 
people avoid harm at all costs and are unusually averse to taking risks. This 
group includes avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disor-
der, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.
Avoidant personality disorder
At one time researchers considered avoidant personality disorder to be some-
what uncommon, but at the time of this book’s writing, studies suggest that 
as much as 2 to 5 percent of the population may have this disorder. These 
people feel inadequate, shy, and fearful of negative opinions from others. 
They withdraw from people, not because they lack interest in relationships 
(as is the case with schizoid personality disorder, which we discuss in the 
section “The odd and eccentric”), but because they’re afraid of rejection and 
criticism.
Their fears cause them to appear socially awkward and inhibited. They get 
involved with someone only when they feel almost certain that this someone 
will accept them. They’re passive and lack the ability to be assertive. People 
with this disorder usually work in occupations that require little interper-
sonal skill and, thus, often achieve less than they may have done without the 
disorder.
Dependent personality disorder
Dependent personality disorder occurs in less than 1 percent of the general 
population. People with this disorder see themselves as helpless and in 
need of others’ care. They’re submissive and clingy, as well as desperate 
for approval. They have a hard time making decisions and ask for excessive 
advice from others. They avoid taking on responsibilities and, instead, try to 
get others to carry their responsibilities for them. They may be vulnerable to 
exploitation or abuse by others because they’re so unassertive and unable to 
stand up for themselves.
People with dependent personality disorder tend to underachieve, a quality 
they share with people who have avoidant personality disorder. However, 
their failure is a result of a lack of initiative and feelings of inadequacy rather 
than avoidance of interpersonal contact. As you can imagine, the exces-
sive neediness expressed by people with this disorder can wear down their 
friends and acquaintances.

42
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) afflicts perhaps 2 percent 
of the general population. People with OCPD are orderly, inflexible, and 
extremely detail oriented. They usually follow the rules excessively. Most 
people with OCPD have a high devotion to their work. They also tend to over-
work, partly because they think they’re the only ones who can do their jobs 
well enough and partly because of their excessive drive and perfectionism. 
They dwell on details to an extent that most people simply can’t imagine. 
They organize their work and lives ad nauseam. People with OCPD live 
frugally to a fault.
When someone doesn’t fit the categories
Like trying to fit round pegs into square holes, 
people don’t always fit cleanly into one person-
ality disorder or another. Sometimes a person 
has two symptoms of BPD, two symptoms 
of narcissistic personality disorder, and one 
strong symptom of histrionic personality disor-
der. Such a person doesn’t fit neatly into any of 
these three personality disorders, yet he most 
likely demonstrates chronic difficulties with the 
handling of emotions, interpersonal relation-
ships, and/or work. This person may also act 
without considering consequences. Someone 
who demonstrates these symptoms certainly 
shows the general signs of a personality dis-
order, but he doesn’t belong in any specific 
category.
Mental health professionals have come up with 
one solution for this dilemma; it’s called person-
ality disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). 
Professionals use this diagnosis whenever a 
person’s symptoms are mixed and simply don’t 
meet the criteria for a specific personality dis-
order, such as BPD, histrionic personality dis-
order, or antisocial personality disorder. In fact, 
personality disorder NOS is the most frequently 
used diagnosis in the personality disorder 
category because a very large number of peo-
ple’s issues aren’t easily categorized.
This chapter describes all the personality disor-
der diagnoses that our profession has officially 
accepted at the time of this writing. However, 
experts continue to study other personality 
disorders that may eventually become for-
mally recognized. These diagnoses include the 
following:
 ✓ Depressive personality disorder: Character-
ized by a chronic, gloomy, brooding, pessi-
mistic outlook
 ✓ Passive-aggressive personality disorder: 
Characterized by passive resistance to 
demands, sullenness, and harsh criticism, 
especially of authority figures
 ✓ Sadistic personality disorder: Characterized 
by cruelty to others, intimidation, and 
amused interest in violence
Don’t be surprised when you hear professionals 
discussing other personality disorder diagno-
ses. The way that mental health professionals 
view diagnoses evolves over time.

43
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
Even when people with OCPD take on a hobby or other interest, they sap the 
fun out of it by scrutinizing and studying all the ins and outs of the activity. 
For example, an OCPD person may decide to travel to a foreign country for 
recreation. Instead of relaxing and carrying out normal preparations, how-
ever, a person with OCPD may
 
✓ Spend months reading every imaginable travel guide
 
✓ Learn the history and culture of the destination
 
✓ Master the language of the destination
 
✓ Fill the trip with an exhausting schedule of museums and historical 
landmarks
Of course, some of those activities can enrich an adventure. But someone 
with OCPD doesn’t like to spend much time at the beach reading novels for 
pleasure or taking midafternoon naps. In other words, goals and useful activi-
ties supersede enjoyment and relaxation.
 
Although they have similar names, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) isn’t 
the same thing as OCPD. A particularly striking difference is that most people 
with OCD feel great distress from the effects of their disorder. People with 
OCPD, on the other hand, usually believe that the way they live their lives is 
the right, correct way for them to live, and they don’t want to change anything 
about themselves.
 
For information about OCD, see the “Anxiety” section later in this chapter.
When you ask people with OCPD whether their lives satisfy them, most of 
them tell you that they feel content with their lives. The following story about 
Paul depicts a day in the life of someone with OCPD.
Paul begins each day precisely at 5:15 a.m. His shower routine takes 
exactly nine minutes. He dresses by 5:45 a.m. on the dot. For breakfast, 
he always eats oatmeal (for his cholesterol), 1/4 cup of prunes (for regular-
ity), 1/3 cup of nonfat milk, and a single cup of black coffee. He reviews his 
schedule book for the day and heads to his office by 6:15 a.m. He’s always 
the first to arrive at 6:55 a.m. He enjoys the quiet time before the other 
employees arrive at 8:00 a.m. He reviews his schedule a second time and 
prioritizes each task that lies ahead.
Paul logs on to his computer and checks his retirement funds at 7:30 a.m. 
and again in the late afternoon. Each Friday he gives himself a treat by 
completing an online financial checkup. He’s pleased to see that all three 
online retirement analyzers indicate a 98 percent chance of his being able 
to live in his current lifestyle until the age of 105 or longer. Paul’s secre-
tary arrives at 8:00 a.m. She smiles and greets him. Paul simply nods and, 
without looking at her, says, “I looked over the letter I asked you to write 
yesterday and I have 17 changes. I want you to make them and run it by 
me again.”

44
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
She rolls her eyes but knows that he won’t notice because he rarely looks 
at her. She’s worked for him for twelve years and has almost never seen 
him smile. As far as she knows, he has no real life, family, or friends out-
side work.
Although you may view Paul as miserable and miserly, he has no complaints 
about his life. He has no desire for change and doesn’t seem to notice his 
emotional impoverishment. However, a mental health professional can accu-
rately diagnose Paul with OCPD.
Emotional Disorders That 
Accompany BPD
You can compare the difference between a personality disorder (BPD, for 
example) and other types of acute emotional disorders to the difference 
between climate and weather. Climate refers to general patterns of weather 
that are fairly predictable over long periods of time. Weather refers to what 
is happening at any given moment in terms of temperature, wind, rain, and 
humidity.
For example, Florida’s climate is mild with an enduring pattern of sunshine 
and warm temperatures. But Florida’s weather changes from sunny to occa-
sional thunderstorms and hurricanes. Like climate, personality disorders 
endure over long periods of time. In contrast, the acute emotional disorders, 
such as anxiety and depression, are more like weather — thunderstorms 
and hurricanes — in that they typically manifest in more intense and often 
shorter bursts than personality disorders.
People with personality disorders exhibit long-standing patterns of behavior 
that interfere with their lives. However, they also often have emotional disor-
ders that roll in like thunderstorms. The following sections briefly describe 
the emotional disorders that most often occur with BPD — or that people 
sometimes mistake for BPD.
 
You may wonder why we devote so many pages to diagnoses that sometimes 
accompany or can be confused with BPD. Consider this scenario. If you get 
malaria, you want your doctor to treat malaria, not the bubonic plague. But if 
you have the bizarre misfortune of coming down with both of these maladies, 
you want your doctor to treat both of them.
 
The difference between acute emotional disorders and personality disorders 
isn’t quite as clear and distinct as the analogy to weather and climate. For 
instance, some people experience anxiety and depression for many years, if 
not their entire lives, especially if they never seek treatment. Professionals 
disagree whether personality disorders and other emotional disorders are 
actually separate entities.

 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
Anxiety
Almost everyone experiences a little anxiety from time to time. Anxiety is 
a sense of uneasiness, distress, worry, or apprehension. Some people feel 
anxiety in their bodies (stomach tightness or difficulty catching one’s breath, 
for example). Others wake up in the middle of the night with worries running 
through their heads; and, still others avoid going places that arouse anxious 
feelings. Anxiety becomes a disorder only when it significantly interferes with 
someone’s quality of life or health.
 
If you want more information about common anxiety disorders, we recom-
mend you read our book, Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies (Wiley). There 
you can find details about the diagnoses as well as sound advice on how to 
treat them. Fortunately, treatment for anxiety disorders is typically quite 
successful.
The most common types of anxiety disorders are
 
✓ Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): This disorder is characterized by 
an almost constant state of worry and tension that doesn’t go away. The 
worries are generally excessive and exaggerated.
 
✓ Social phobia: This disorder centers on fears of public scrutiny and 
evaluation by others. People with this disorder avoid socializing, 
public speaking, attending parties, and answering questions posed 
by instructors.
 
✓ Panic disorder: People with panic disorder have intense episodes of 
overwhelming fear, usually accompanied by physical symptoms, such as 
shortness of breath, racing heartbeats, and sweating. Many people report 
that their panic attacks make them feel like they’re about to die — in fact, 
people sometimes confuse panic attacks with heart attacks.
 
 
If you experience a sharp panic attack (especially if it’s accompanied 
by chest pain or shortness of breath), you need to see a physician who 
can help you determine whether your symptoms are related to panic or 
another physical problem, such as a heart attack. Call 911 immediately. 
After being evaluated, you and your doctor can work on how to deal 
with and evaluate future attacks.
 
✓ Agoraphobia: This disorder frequently (but not always) accompanies 
panic disorders. Agoraphobia involves an irrationally intense fear of 
being trapped and unable to escape from crowds, theaters, or groups of 
any kind. People with this disorder often constrict their activities to the 
point that they become housebound.
 
✓ Specific phobias: Phobias involve exaggerated fears of specific objects, 
situations, or animals. The fear causes people to avoid these dreaded 
things to such a degree that their lives are restricted, somewhat like 
those with agoraphobia. Common phobias include an intense fear of 
heights, snakes, spiders, airplanes, insects, and lightning.

Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
 
✓ Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): PTSD often occurs following a 
life-threatening or horrifying event. This disorder involves unwanted 
memories or flashbacks, avoidance of reminders or memories of the 
event, and the feeling of being stirred up and constantly on guard. 
Traumatic events that may lead to PTSD include car accidents, war, and 
violent crimes (whether you’re a witness or a victim).
 
 Many people with BPD have histories of trauma, so some professionals 
propose that BPD is a complex form of PTSD. However, most people who 
experience trauma don’t develop BPD and some people with BPD don’t 
have extensive histories of abuse or trauma. Thus, most professionals 
believe that abuse and trauma can contribute to the problems associ-
ated with BPD but that they aren’t direct causes.
 
 
If you or someone you care about has symptoms of PTSD, consider seek-
ing professional help. It’s a treatable condition, but it may never go away 
if you don’t seek help.
 
✓ Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): This complex disorder involves 
either obsessions or compulsions — or perhaps both. Obsessions are 
unwanted thoughts, images, or urges that are repetitive and disturbing. 
An example of an obsession is having intense worries about germs or 
contamination. Compulsions, on the other hand, are actions that you 
take to reduce the fears associated with obsessions. Thus, people with 
germ obsessions may wash their hands over and over again (an example 
of a compulsion) to reduce their worries about germs.
 
 
OCD is a fascinating, yet highly disturbing and serious disorder. To 
learn more, read our book Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies 
(Wiley).
Mood disorders
Moods are emotional states that, in general, feel either good or bad. Most 
people’s moods relate to what’s currently going on in their lives. So, you’re 
probably in a good mood when you’re engaged in pleasant activities, such 
as sailing or eating ice cream. On the other hand, you may be in a bad mood 
when you see your life savings go up in smoke because of falling stock prices.
However, moods sometimes take on a life of their own. Mood disorders are 
characterized by emotions that run out of control and dominate a person’s 
life.
 
You can treat mood disorders using a variety of methods, including specific 
psychotherapies, medications, lifestyle changes, exercise, and even light ther-
apy in some cases.
Although mood disorders come in a variety of types, the main two types are 
depression and bipolar disorder, which we cover in the next sections.

47
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
Depression
Depression is a disorder that is characterized by low moods, lack of pleasure, 
loss of interests, appetite changes, sleep disturbances, low self-esteem, poor 
concentration, and often thoughts of suicide. Depression varies in severity, 
but it’s always serious. Dysthymia is a somewhat milder form of depres-
sion. Dysthymia also involves low moods, but it doesn’t have as many of the 
symptoms of depression. Dysthymia tends to be more chronic than regular 
depression.
 
If you or someone you know has experienced significant symptoms of depres-
sion for more than a week or two, consider seeking professional help — espe-
cially if the symptoms include thoughts of suicide.
Bipolar disorder
Fluctuating moods characterize bipolar disorder. Everyone’s moods go up and 
down sometimes. However, sufferers of bipolar disorder experience mood 
swings that occasionally rise beyond normal, good moods. These episodes 
are called either mania or hypomania, depending on the severity of the epi-
sode (mania is considered more severe). During a manic phase, the world of 
someone with bipolar disorder becomes too good. Manic phases typically 
involve the following symptoms:
 
✓ Racing thoughts
 
✓ Inflated, grandiose self-esteem
 
✓ Poor judgment
 
✓ Decreased need for sleep
 
✓ Rapid speech
 
✓ Irritability
 
✓ High but unfocused energy
 
✓ Risky, impulsive behaviors
 
✓ High distractibility
Most (but not all) people with bipolar disorder also experience phases of 
depression that can range from mild to severe. The moods of people with 
bipolar disorder seem to have lives of their own and go up and down inde-
pendently of what’s going on in the lives of the sufferers. Remember that fluc-
tuating moods is also a symptom of BPD, but the moods of people with BPD 
are usually triggered by positive or negative events.
Most people who run through the highs and lows of bipolar disorder require 
some type of medication in addition to psychotherapy to help gain control of 
their mood swings.

48
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
 
Over the past couple of decades, the diagnosis of bipolar disorder has become 
more and more common. Interestingly, a number of the symptoms of bipolar 
disorder significantly overlap with symptoms of BPD. In our practice, we have 
observed that some people who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder actually 
seem to fit better with a diagnosis of BPD. However, distinguishing between 
these two disorders may be less important than focusing on treating a per-
son’s specific symptoms.
 
For a lot more information about mood disorders and their treatment, read 
our book, Depression For Dummies (Wiley), or Bipolar Disorder For Dummies 
by Candida Fink and Joe Kraynak (Wiley).
Other emotional disorders
People with BPD often act impulsively, abuse alcohol or drugs, and occa-
sionally lose touch with reality. The following three disorders share some of 
these symptoms with BPD, but these disorders are considered separate dis-
orders and require separate and specific treatment:
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) begins in childhood and is 
characterized by the following symptoms:
 
✓ Poor focus
 
✓ Forgetfulness
 
✓ Lack of organization
 
✓ Distractibility
 
✓ Fidgetiness
 
✓ Impulsivity
These symptoms cause problems in school, at work, and in relationships. 
People with BPD may also have AD/HD, but not necessarily. Even though 
people with BPD tend to be impulsive, they may not show the other critical 
signs of AD/HD.
Substance abuse
Substance abuse involves frequent overuse of drugs, alcohol, or prescription 
medications that results in problems at work, problems with relationships, 
legal difficulties, or dangerous behaviors. People with BPD frequently have 
substance abuse problems; however, not everyone with BPD abuses sub-
stances. Diagnosing and addressing substance abuse is very important when 
someone with BPD shows any signs of this problem.

49
 Chapter 3: Describing BPD
Gender in the diagnosis of BPD
More women than men receive a diagnosis 
of BPD. Professionals disagree on why this 
trend exists. One possible reason that more 
women receive a diagnosis of BPD than men is 
that women seek help for their problems from 
mental health providers more readily (and more 
often) than men do.
Gender differences in BPD diagnosis may also 
occur because mental health professionals, 
family members, the legal community, and soci-
ety at large don’t view behaviors in men and 
women in the same way. For example, people 
interpret violence and aggression differently 
when the perpetrator is a man rather than a 
woman. The following two stories about Randy 
and Tammy illustrate this issue.
 
 Randy finishes his fifth beer at the Mountain 
Brewery and demands a final beer with a 
chaser for the road. The bartender says, 
“Randy, I think you’ve had enough. I’m turn-
ing off the tap. How about a soda?” Randy 
throws his car keys across the bar, barely 
missing another patron. He exclaims, “I’m 
not driving — give me another round!”
 
 The bartender says, “Let me call you a cab. 
I can’t serve you anymore.” Randy starts 
yelling and pushes the bartender. Several 
patrons dial 911 immediately; police arrive 
and arrest Randy.
Randy’s behavior lands him in jail. In contrast, 
Tammy’s story below shows you how the same 
behavior from a woman can evoke a completely 
different reaction and outcome.
 
 Tammy finishes her fifth beer at the 
Mountain Brewery and demands a final 
beer with a chaser for the road. The bar-
tender says, “Tammy, I think you’ve had 
enough. I’m turning off the tap. How about a 
soda?” Tammy throws her car keys across 
the bar, barely missing another patron. 
She exclaims, “I’m not driving — give me 
another round!”
 
 The bartender says, “Let me call you a 
cab. I can’t serve you anymore.” Tammy 
starts yelling and pushes the bartender. 
Several patrons go up to Tammy, and one 
man puts his arm around her shoulders. He 
says, “Tammy, let me take you home. The 
bartender has to follow the rules or he’ll be 
fired. You can have another beer at home.”
Tammy and Randy both had too much to drink. 
They acted aggressively and over the top. 
However, people usually find aggressive behav-
ior in men more threatening than in women. 
Tammy and Randy demonstrate identical symp-
toms (rage and substance abuse) that frequently 
occur in people who have BPD. However, when 
a mental health professional sees both of them, 
he may diagnose Tammy with BPD while diag-
nosing Randy with antisocial personality dis-
order (see the “Other Personality Disorders” 
section for more on this disorder).
The two diagnoses do have some overlapping 
symptoms. However, a diagnosis of antisocial 
personality disorder involves behavior that is 
more outrageous and out of line with society’s 
norms than a diagnosis of BPD. People typically 
interpret aggressive behavior on the part of a 
woman as less serious because it doesn’t seem 
as threatening to others as aggressive behavior 
from a man.

Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Psychosis
In this chapter’s section, “The Nine Symptoms of BPD,” we note that one 
symptom of BPD is occasional loss of contact with reality. People with BPD 
sometimes hear voices that aren’t really there, experience beliefs that others 
are out to get them, or have strong feelings of detachment or unrealness. 
People who are diagnosed with psychosis have similar experiences, but their 
episodes usually last longer and involve a more severe loss of contact with 
reality.
 
Loss of touch with reality, including hearing or seeing things that aren’t there, 
inability to speak or think logically, and extreme paranoia, are signs of a seri-
ous disorder. These symptoms require prompt medical attention.

Chapter 4
Who Gets BPD and Why?
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the influence of culture on personality
▶ Exploring the contribution of childhood challenges
▶ Uncovering the biological and genetic factors behind BPD
N
ot everyone who has a horrible childhood experience ends up with 
borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, most people with 
BPD report difficult or traumatic childhoods. Recent studies suggest that 
combinations of genetic influences accompanied by highly challenging devel-
opmental events are usually present in people who develop BPD. In addi-
tion, culture and society create conditions that either facilitate or inhibit the 
development of BPD.
Scientists can’t pinpoint a single, clear pathway that leads to the emergence of 
BPD in a particular person. Consider the flu as a rough analogy. People don’t 
come down with the flu every time they’re exposed to the flu virus. Other 
factors, such as the person’s genetic makeup, general health, levels of cur-
rent stress, and past history (having received a flu shot, for example), make 
a difference in whether or not a certain person will come down with the flu. 
Similarly, exposure to one or two risk factors doesn’t cause BPD in everyone.
In this chapter, we explore the ins and outs of the major risk factors for BPD. 
We also try to show you how various combinations of factors may contribute 
to the emergence of BPD.
Considering Culture
Culture is similar to the concept of personality (for more on personality, 
head to Chapter 2). Personality attempts to capture the essence of a person; 
culture attempts to capture the essence of a community. Culture represents 
enduring patterns of behavior, attitudes, beliefs, and ways of expressing emo-
tions that are common to a large community of people. Culture transmits 
strong expectations about the way individual members of a particular com-
munity are supposed to live their lives.

52
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Culture also influences the way people express emotional distress. In most 
poor countries, for example, intentionally cutting oneself is a rare and confus-
ing event. In wealthier cultures, however, the act of self-mutilation is a rela-
tively common occurrence, especially among troubled adolescents.
Some emotional disorders, such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, occur at about the same rate and in similar ways across most cul-
tures. See Jerome and Irene Levine’s Schizophrenia For Dummies (Wiley) and 
our own Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies (Wiley) for more infor-
mation about these two disorders. However, BPD symptoms appear at dif-
ferent rates in different cultures. The varying social norms that exist across 
cultures may explain this difference in the rate of occurrence, at least in part. 
The next sections discuss the following five issues that differ across cultures 
and that may impact how frequently BPD occurs:
 
✓ Individualism
 
✓ Adolescence
 
✓ Entitlement
 
✓ Family instability
 
✓ Technology
Individualism: Emphasizing me versus we
Since before the days of the Declaration of Independence, American culture 
has strongly encouraged individualism. Today parents, teachers, and other 
role models encourage young people to strive for achievement on their 
own — to be all that they can be. Success in the United States is measured 
by how much more you accomplish or how much better you are at a 
particular skill than everyone else around you.
People in the United States, and in many other modern societies, are movers. 
People move away from their families to better their own lives or to experi-
ence something new. Many modern industrialized countries share the culture 
that celebrates the individual.
In contrast, more traditional cultures, such as those in the Far East, encourage 
community, family, and interdependence. These cultures emphasize bringing 
honor to the family group. In traditional cultures, people have more structure 
within their communities. Families — both immediate and extended — provide 
support for one another. Unlike more modern cultures, being part of a group is 
more important than being an individual in traditional cultures.

53
 Chapter 4: Who Gets BPD and Why?
What does the emphasis on the individual versus the group have to do with 
BPD? Researchers have lamented the astonishing lack of studies on BPD 
across various cultures. Although symptoms of BPD clearly appear at varying 
rates across cultures, no one knows the exact frequency of BPD around the 
world. However, a number of researchers have noted that many of the symp-
toms of BPD occur more often in cultures that emphasize the needs, values, 
and priorities of individuals over those of the community at large.
Some scientists believe that a concept known as self-absorption supports 
this observation. Self-absorption refers to a narrowed focus on oneself and a 
heightened concern for evaluating that self. Social scientists have discovered 
that an excessive focus on oneself substantially increases the risk for a wide 
range of physical and emotional problems, including
 
✓ Eating disorders
 
✓ Anger
 
✓ Alcoholism
 
✓ Drug abuse
 
✓ Self-harm
 
✓ Depression
 
✓ Anxiety
 
✓ Sensation seeking
In Chapter 3, you can see that most of these problems are common symp-
toms of BPD. A number of psychologists have suggested that an excessive 
emphasis on the self creates stress and pressure that lead to these and other 
similar symptoms. A community with strong social connections and an effec-
tive support system may eliminate much of this pressure.
See the “Sleuthing self-absorption” sidebar for more information about the 
relationship between emotional problems and an excessive focus on the self.
 
Please understand that we’re not blaming people with BPD for being too self-
absorbed. No one wants or asks for BPD, and people don’t often seek out self-
absorption. In our opinion, modern culture encourages this trait among its 
people. Furthermore, self-absorption is but one of many contributors to the 
development of BPD.

54
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Adolescence and BPD
Adolescence is a relatively modern concept that refers to the transition 
period between childhood and adulthood. Adolescence emerged as a con-
sequence of the Industrial Revolution as a way to keep children in school 
and out of sweatshops — not such a bad idea. However, as it has evolved, 
adolescence has become a tumultuous and treacherous time for many teens. 
Arguably, adolescence brings with it large chunks of free time, which means 
numerous opportunities for teens to engage in self-destructive behaviors. 
Pressures mount for teens to have more, be more, and be noticed.
Adolescence is a time when psychological disorders, including signs of per-
sonality disorders, such as BPD, emerge. Problems with gangs, violence, drug 
use, sensation seeking, eating disorders, and risky sexual behavior have bur-
geoned among adolescents in the past four or five decades.
Sleuthing self-absorption
Sometimes nature creates unexpected experi-
ments. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, professor of 
psychology at Yale University, stumbled upon 
one such experiment during an organized study 
of her own. In the late 1980s, Nolen-Hoeksema 
measured a group of college students for 
their tendency to ruminate about themselves. 
Rumination involves focusing on oneself and the 
causes of one’s problems rather than on coming 
up with solutions. Fourteen days after her exper-
iment, the area near the college experienced an 
earthquake. Ten days later, Nolen-Hoeksema’s 
researchers went back to the students they’d 
previously assessed and measured their levels 
of depression and symptoms of stress. The 
researchers assessed the students’ levels of 
stress and depression again seven weeks after 
the earthquake. They found that students who 
were ruminators had developed significantly 
higher levels of depression right after the earth-
quake than people who weren’t ruminators and 
that their stress and depression levels were 
sustained at the final assessment seven weeks 
after the earthquake.
Many other studies have shown similar trends. 
For example, several studies have shown that 
increasing someone’s self-focus causes unde-
sirable spikes in depressive and anxious feelings 
as well as a reduced ability to solve problems. 
These experiments studied the effects of rumi-
nation by using various techniques to increase 
self-focus. For example, one such experiment 
asked subjects to spend eight minutes reflect-
ing on their personal traits and emotional states. 
Another experiment asked participants to look 
at themselves in a mirror for a particular period 
of time, and a third experiment asked subjects 
to write paragraphs that contained numerous 
references to themselves. All these strategies 
for increasing self-focus caused an increase 
in negative feelings and lowered the ability to 
solve problems.

55
 Chapter 4: Who Gets BPD and Why?
Of course, we’re not saying that adolescence itself causes emotional disor-
ders; after all, many adolescents mature into adulthood with no sign of any 
emotional disorders. However, from a historical perspective, BPD symptoms 
and behaviors have only been written about in the past century or so — 
which coincides with the emergence of adolescence as a feature of modern 
culture. When kids were busy milking cows and gathering crops, much less 
adolescent angst existed among teens. Perhaps if we can give teens more 
important tasks than texting, video gaming, and hanging out at the mall, they 
won’t be as easily seduced by self-destructive behaviors.
Entitlement: Feeling too good
In recent years, the value of suffering — both physical and emotional — has 
diminished. A few hundred years ago, people admired others for their ability 
to endure hardship. For example, ancient religious writings are full of mes-
sages extolling the virtues of suffering. Many people believed that suffering 
strengthened character and helped people appreciate the gifts of life.
That message has changed dramatically in modern, industrialized cultures. 
Today, people look to pills to combat the slightest emotional distress, and 
advertising pushes people to treat their frowns, wrinkles, and splotches like 
they do diseases. Even normal grief in response to loss has become an abnor-
mal condition in need of medical treatment.
Unfortunately, an inability to accept any negative feelings typically increases 
a person’s vulnerability to being overwhelmed by emotional distress. People 
who believe that feeling good all the time is a basic human right end up feel-
ing entitled to having all their needs met. As a result, they become sharply 
disappointed when the world fails to cater to their every whim.
Don’t get us wrong; we like feeling good like most other people. We’re defi-
nitely not promoting the idea of suffering for suffering’s sake. However, as we 
note in Chapter 2, the abilities to tolerate frustration, delay gratification, and 
recover from adversity are hallmarks of a healthy personality, and people 
who lack these abilities often struggle to remain calm and buoyant with every 
little mishap that comes their way.
Family instability
Today, especially in Western cultures, more children grow up in single-parent 
families than ever before. Although divorce rates have peaked and then 
decreased slightly in the past 10 or 20 years, they remain much higher than 
they were in 1950. Furthermore, fewer people marry today than in the past, 
and when they do marry, they marry later in life.

56
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
In addition, large extended families consisting of multiple generations — 
cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents — aren’t as common as they were 
in the past. Today, immediate families (Mom, Dad, and two kids, for example) 
spread out across the world. As a result, sources of emotional support are 
much less reliable and stable than they once were. Again, we don’t know to 
what extent family instability contributes to the development of BPD, but 
social scientists have long known that social support serves as a strong pro-
tective force against declining mental and physical health.
Technology and its isolating effects
Technology in the form of computers, cellphones, and the Internet have 
increased productivity, access to information, and the ability to communi-
cate. Personally, we love computers — they’ve enabled us to write more and 
to research with greater ease than ever. Sometimes we spend days at a time 
holed up in our offices, banging away on the computer and not speaking to 
other living beings. Yet, because we don’t want to lose real, face-to-face com-
munication, we try to monitor our isolation to make sure we don’t go over-
board with cyber communication.
Unfortunately, some people find themselves drawn into a digital, virtual 
world that becomes more exciting than their real lives. They spend day after 
day socializing on MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and online gaming sites. They 
lose contact with the people around them, and they become fully absorbed 
in their virtual selves. Consider the following ways in which many people 
choose to relate to others:
 
✓ Joining a World of Warcraft team rather than the soccer team
 
✓ Participating in live Webcasts rather than meeting up with friends at a 
local coffee shop
 
✓ Posting comments on discussion boards rather than communicating 
face to face in social settings
 
✓ Conversing via e-mails and text messages rather than phone conversations
 
✓ Being a part of anonymous online support groups rather than attending 
local support group meetings
 
✓ Cybersnooping friends’ profiles rather than getting to know them 
personally
Of course, some of these ways of “techno-relating” are fun and beneficial. 
The social components of the Web appeal to many people because they offer 
easier, safer, and quicker ways to connect to others. No one really knows to 

57
 Chapter 4: Who Gets BPD and Why?
what extent isolation from overuse of technological ways of relating to other 
people contributes to the development of BPD or other emotional problems. 
However, technology can prevent the in-person contact you need to build 
relationships and trust. To get better, people with BPD need real relation-
ships, real social support, and real feedback about their behavior.
Childhood Challenges and 
the Increased Risk of BPD
Mental health professionals widely ascribe to the theory that the events of 
a person’s childhood greatly affect mental health in adolescence and adult-
hood. Parents and the way they parent greatly influence the mental and 
emotional states of their children throughout their lives. Other family mem-
bers, peers, schools, neighborhoods, friends, and even strangers also impact 
children. In addition, random events, such as hurricanes and house fires, can 
change young people’s lives forever.
As important as the impact of childhood is on people, however, keep in 
mind that children are quite resilient. Many mental health professionals 
have allowed their opinions to run ahead of the data in drawing connections 
between childhood problems and disorders in adulthood. As research has 
shown, the development of BPD involves much more than just poor parenting 
or even traumatic events. Many kids experience significant traumas as well as 
neglectful parents, yet they manage to lead emotionally healthy lives. A biolog-
ical vulnerability usually plays at least a part in the development of BPD (see 
the “Bringing biology into the BPD equation” section for more information). 
Nevertheless, difficult childhoods do raise the risks for developing BPD.
The three major factors that can affect childhood negatively and, as a result, 
can increase risk for BPD in some cases are
 
✓ Parenting styles
 
✓ Abuse and trauma
 
✓ Early separation and loss
 
BPD has no single cause. Most of the issues we describe in the following sec-
tions must occur in extreme forms and/or for a very prolonged period of time 
to increase the risk of BPD. Even then, they usually require some interaction 
with biological and cultural factors for BPD to emerge.

58
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Problematic parenting
Most of what mental health professionals know about the parents of people 
who develop BPD comes from reports made by the people who suffer from 
BPD. But when people suffer great distress, they tend to focus on and recall 
negative events far more than positive ones. When they feel better, their 
memories of certain events have a somewhat more cheerful tone. As a result, 
researchers quarrel over how much weight to give studies based on such 
recollections.
Unfortunately, far fewer studies objectively look at parenting styles at a given 
point in time and then follow the outcomes in terms of how children function 
in adulthood. Therefore, current professional perspectives on parenting and 
its true long-term effects remain somewhat murky. At the same time, mental 
health professionals have reached a reasonable degree of consensus that cer-
tain parenting practices do harm children. The next sections take a look at 
some problematic parenting styles.
Emotional invalidation
Psychologist Marsha Linehan promotes the idea that emotional invalidation 
plays a critical role in fostering the development of BPD. Emotional invalida-
tion refers to a variety of ways in which parents diminish, demean, discount, 
and disqualify children’s emotional experiences.
Parents who emotionally invalidate their kids deliver a wide variety of mes-
sages to their kids that ultimately teach them to distrust or disbelieve their 
own emotional reactions. In the following list, we explore some of the more 
common messages parents use to invalidate their children’s emotions and 
describe how these messages affect the children’s feelings:
 
✓ You shouldn’t feel that way. Parents send messages like this one when 
their kids have been hurt or upset. Parents may feel uncomfortable with 
their children’s distress and, thus, attempt to squelch it by using this 
message. They may think they’re helping their kids calm down, but the 
net effect of the message is to induce guilt and to invalidate the kids’ 
feelings.
 
✓ What are you crying about? Most people don’t enjoy listening to other 
people cry. In fact, some parents have a very low tolerance for deal-
ing with the extremely grating noise that crying and wailing generate. 
Unfortunately, children can’t really respond to this question because 
they’re feeling overwhelmed and often simply don’t know the answer. 
With this message, parents imply that distress and sadness aren’t 
acceptable emotions.
 
✓ You’re exaggerating. This message essentially tells children that they’re 
fundamentally misinterpreting reality. As a result, the kids learn to dis-
trust their perceptions. This message attempts to suppress emotions 
rather than teach kids how to regulate them.

59
 Chapter 4: Who Gets BPD and Why?
 
✓ That’s just not true! Sometimes children come to parents with opinions 
about relationships, school, or even politics. Rather than encourage 
independent thought, parents lead children to distrust their own view-
points and, instead, rely on their parents’ superior knowledge. This 
statement is also quite a conversation stopper.
 
✓ You’re just like your father (brother, uncle, aunt, or whomever). This 
message invalidates the very identities of children. Generally, the com-
parisons to other family members aren’t particularly flattering. Using 
this message inhibits children’s growth and their capacity to believe in 
their own abilities.
 
✓ I sure wish you could be more like your sister (cousin, father, aunt, or 
whomever). This message tells kids that they aren’t good enough and 
that their parents are disappointed in who they are. Again, this message 
erodes children’s identities.
 
✓ Grow up! By nature, children are sometimes loud, annoying, and, well, 
just kids. Parents who can’t tolerate frustration commonly put their kids 
down for boisterous childlike behavior. This message not only fails to 
change kids’ behaviors but also makes them feel guilty for acting like 
kids.
 
✓ Tell me something good that’s happened. Some parents say this when 
their kids report an unhappy or sad event. Instead of validating the 
sadness, these parents believe that redirecting the child to focus on 
more pleasant events will help them learn to feel better. Instead, this 
approach teaches kids to suppress their true emotions.
 
✓ You’re being selfish. In truth, most kids are a little selfish. They haven’t 
yet learned to fully appreciate the needs, wants, and perspectives of 
others or to balance those needs with their own. Unfortunately, though, 
this message doesn’t help them become less selfish. Rather, it invali-
dates kids for being true to their nature.
 
✓ You’re way too young to try something like that. You could (get hurt, 
get in trouble, get lost, or whatever). Always ask me first before you 
do anything! Some parents use messages like this one because of their 
own insecurities and desire to protect their kids. Unfortunately, this 
approach suppresses kids’ curiosity, independence, motivation, confi-
dence, and competence.
Growing up in a family in which emotional invalidation dominates the atmo-
sphere can be very hurtful for kids. They learn either to passively withdraw 
to avoid these messages or to demonstrate extreme emotions and behaviors 
to obtain recognition and attention.
Emotional invalidation can also lead to more serious situations. Consider 
how the emotional invalidation a child receives from her mother can contrib-
ute to a sexually abusive situation and further harm the child. The following 
story about Daniela illustrates this point:

60
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
“Mommy, please don’t go out again tonight,” 8-year-old Daniela whines.
“I need my fun time without kids getting in my way. Besides, Uncle 
Gordon is going to watch you,” her mother responds.
“But I hate Uncle Gordon,” Daniela declares.
“Don’t talk about your uncle that way. He’s always been good to you,” her 
mother scolds.
“But he’s creepy. I don’t like the way he smells, and he gives me yucky 
wet kisses,” Daniela says.
“That’s not true. He’s a nice man. You need to show him respect,” her 
mother argues.
“He always grabs me and makes me sit on his lap. He bounces me up and 
down like a baby. I don’t like it,” Daniela pleads.
“Listen. You need to be nice to your family. Uncle Gordon is a nice man. 
Stop this complaining; I don’t want to hear any more about your uncle,” 
her mother admonishes.
Many kids like Daniela know when something is wrong, but they don’t have 
the words to express their concerns fully and completely. Given her mother’s 
invalidating comments, Daniela is likely to stop complaining even as her 
uncle’s inappropriate touching may slowly escalate into full-blown sexual 
molestation.
 
Daniela’s story doesn’t contain enough information for you to conclude that 
sexual molestation was actually occurring. However, parents can’t decide 
whether a child’s concerns are legitimate when they frequently invalidate 
their kids’ emotions and statements. Furthermore, because molestation often 
begins at a low level and slowly escalates over time, parents have to make 
sure their children feel totally safe in sharing their concerns with them.
Dysfunctional and disorganized families
An old cartoon depicts a man alone in a huge conference hall with a banner 
that reads “Worldwide Meeting of Those with Functional Families” draped 
across the stage. Although we may have slightly misquoted the cartoon, the 
point is that most people have at least some degree of dysfunction in their 
families.
In contrast, dysfunction and disorganization dominate in some families. 
Dysfunction occurs when parents experience high marital discord and con-
flict. Parents often overtly express that conflict in the form of frequent loud 
fighting that fills children with anxiety and even fear that one or both parents 
may leave them. Other parents express that marital discord behind closed 
doors. In these cases, the parents may cover up and fail to talk about their 
disagreements. Although this approach may sound less stressful to children, 

61
 Chapter 4: Who Gets BPD and Why?
most professionals believe that sweeping conflicts under the rug only makes 
them fester. Children pick up on the subtle signs of tension, and when par-
ents don’t openly resolve their conflicts with each other, their kids fail to 
learn the skills needed for resolving their own conflicts.
Dysfunction also arises when parents place confusing roles and expectations 
on their children. Some parents feel virtually incapable of parenting and 
place excessive responsibilities on their oldest children — virtually turning 
them into parents of the younger kids. Other parents take the opposite tack 
and treat their kids as incompetent — essentially infantilizing them.
Some homes are filled with disorganized chaos, something that children also 
find difficult to understand and manage. Such chaos comes in a wide range of 
forms, including the following:
 
✓ Financial woes, unpaid bills, and bill collectors
 
✓ Frequent job changes
 
✓ Constant moves from one neighborhood to another
 
✓ Conflicts that cause various household members to move in and out
 
✓ Substance abuse
 
✓ Incarceration
 
✓ Neighborhood crime
 
✓ Disability, serious illness, or severe emotional disorders in one or more 
of the parents
These types of chaotic atmospheres challenge children and make under-
standing their own and other people’s emotions very difficult. Disorganized 
chaos also interferes with a child’s developmentally crucial task of learning 
how to regulate or control emotions.
Abuse and trauma
Numerous studies have demonstrated that people with BPD have a high 
rate of abuse — inflicted by either their parents or someone else, namely a 
relative, a bully, or a stranger — in their childhoods. Because of such data, 
some professionals suggest that BPD is actually a complicated form of post-
traumatic stress disorder (also called PTSD, it’s an intense anxiety disorder 
that frequently occurs some time after a highly traumatic event; see Mark 
Goulston’s Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder For Dummies [Wiley] for more about 
PTSD). However, most researchers now contend that BPD is not a form of 
PTSD, even though trauma certainly raises the risk of developing BPD.

62
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
One reason researchers believe BPD is separate from PTSD is that BPD can 
and does develop in people who don’t show clear signs of trauma in their 
childhoods. Biological vulnerabilities (see the “Bringing biology into the BPD 
equation” section) combine with other difficulties, such as emotionally invali-
dating experiences or chaotic childhoods (which we explain in the preceding 
two sections), and lead to BPD in some people.
On the other hand, some people undergo traumatic events and don’t develop 
BPD or even PTSD. Many of the people who demonstrate such resilience to 
trauma likely do so as a result of their genetic makeup, which enables them 
to endure hardships that many others can’t. Other factors, such as highly 
supportive families, the presence of an especially involved caring adult, or 
psychotherapy, may also serve a protective function for some people who 
experience traumatic events.
Furthermore, the type of trauma children experience makes a difference in 
whether they develop BPD or other emotional disorders later in life. Trauma 
inflicted by a trusted family member appears to have a greater impact than 
trauma inflicted by a stranger. Sexual molestation that goes on for years typi-
cally has a greater impact than a single event of molestation. Incest usually 
increases the risk of BPD and other emotional disorders more than molesta-
tion by a stranger does.
Keep in mind, though, that any event involving abuse or trauma of children 
causes harm. Yet, in the absence of genetic vulnerability or other risk factors, 
many children eventually manage to overcome some of the damaging effects.
 
If you have BPD, you shouldn’t assume that you were abused as a child. Unlike 
claims that people have made to the contrary, most instances of trauma 
tend to be at least partially recalled over the years. Therapies based on the 
assumption that everyone with BPD was abused often guide people to con-
struct memories of events that evidence later shows never occurred.
Separation and loss
Unexpected losses and separation from one or more parents for extended 
periods of time contribute to an increased risk of BPD. Such losses can be 
quite traumatic because they disrupt the development of normal bonding 
between children and their parents. Children who lose parents often become 
more anxious and depressed in part because they worry about who will take 
care of them.
However, much like the case with trauma and abuse, some children lose a 
parent and overcome the effects of the loss, for the most part. Such recovery 
is more likely when these kids have an innate biological resilience and don’t 
have the other risk factors of BPD (see the next section for more about how 
biology affects BPD).

63
 Chapter 4: Who Gets BPD and Why?
Genetics and Biology: BPD 
in the Family Tree
Studies confirm that BPD runs in families. If one member has BPD, the 
chances of a close relative also having BPD are about ten times greater. But 
keep in mind that many people in the same family live together or have simi-
lar childhoods. So childhood rather than genetics may be responsible for the 
higher rates of BPD in the same family. At this point, you may be wondering 
how to figure out what’s in the genes and what comes from the environment. 
The following sections take a closer look at biology and its effects on raising 
the risks for BPD.
Studying twins to find genetic causes
Twins studies help to untangle the heritability question. Remember that iden-
tical twins share the same genetic makeup, but fraternal twins don’t. Most 
twins, regardless of whether they’re identical or fraternal, share the same 
environment as children. You can look at the relationship between genetics 
and BPD by comparing these two types of twins. Subtract the number of fra-
ternal twins who have BPD from the number of identical twins who have BPD, 
and you can get a decent estimate of the role genetics have in the develop-
ment of BPD.
Only a few of these types of studies have been done (they tend to be expen-
sive, and scientists have a hard time finding enough twins who have BPD), 
but the results suggest that 40 to 60 percent of BPD is predicted by genetic 
factors.
 
We’re not saying BPD is an inherited trait, like blue or brown eyes. Indeed, 
BPD is much more complicated than that. What someone with BPD may have 
inherited are tendencies to
 
✓ Be impulsive
 
✓ Have unstable, highly reactive emotions
See Chapter 3 for more information about both of these contributors and the 
problem of BPD. If you throw together a couple inherited tendencies to be 
impulsive and have unstable emotions with other risk factors, such as prob-
lematic parenting and cultural influences, you may be on the fast track for 
developing BPD.

64
Part I: Mapping the Boundaries of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Bringing biology into the BPD equation
Genetics influence BPD because of their impact on the brain, but genes don’t 
directly make someone impulsive or highly emotional. Rather, genes alter the 
brain in ways that increase the likelihood of impulsiveness and strong emo-
tional responses. Researchers are investigating three specific biological areas 
for their influences on BPD. These biological areas are
 
✓ Brain chemistry: Nerve cells in the brain communicate through chemi-
cal messengers called neurotransmitters. Serotonin, one such neurotrans-
mitter, seems to be particularly influential in BPD. Serotonin is involved 
in aggression, impulsivity, and mood stability. Studies have found that 
many people with BPD have disruptions in the way serotonin is used in 
the brain. However, medications that increase the availability of sero-
tonin in the brain haven’t been as helpful in treating BPD as they have 
been in treating other emotional disorders, such as depression and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Therefore, the exact role of serotonin in 
BPD remains unclear.
 
✓ Brain structures: The brain has numerous structures that process infor-
mation, emotions, memories, and events. Recent studies have linked 
problems in the emotion-regulating circuits of the brain to BPD. People 
with BPD appear to have excess gray matter (the working cells of the 
brain) in the emotional interpretation hub of the brain (known as the 
amygdala). They also have less gray matter in the front portion of the 
brain that inhibits emotions. No wonder people with BPD often react 
very emotionally to events that others view as trivial and have trouble 
calming down after they’re upset!
 
✓ Brain functions: Brain functioning refers to the tendency of certain brain 
areas to activate or inactivate under various conditions. The brains of 
people with BPD function differently than the brains of people without 
the disorder. For example, a sophisticated system in the brain senses 
when to be uncomfortable in social situations. This system corresponds 
to what people generally call street sense or gut reactions. This complex 
brain system doesn’t work properly in people with BPD; thus, they fail to 
interpret situations and other people’s intentions accurately.
 
 Another brain system, called the executive system, helps people make 
rational, thoughtful decisions. These decisions take into account both 
past experiences and current information, and they also consider future 
implications. People with BPD often have executive systems that don’t 
function properly, which results in impulsive decisions. 
So, what came first — the chicken or the egg? Did these deficiencies in brain 
chemistry, structure, and function come before or after BPD? At the time of 
this book’s writing, even mental health professionals don’t know. They need 
more research before they can make an accurate assessment.

Sensation Seeking and Self-Harm: 
The Impulsivity of BPD
In This Chapter
▶ Finding excitement in dangerous places
▶ Understanding self-harm and the reasons behind it
▶ Seeking escape through suicide
E
xcruciating emotional pain is a frequent companion of people with bor-
derline personality disorder (BPD). Attempts to escape from this pain 
can take many forms, including abusing substances, cutting oneself, and 
attempting suicide. Although these escape strategies provide momentary 
relief, in the long run, they cause increased pain for people with BPD and 
those who care about them. In Chapter 3, we describe the first two symptoms 
of BPD — sensation seeking and self-harm — as being impulsive in nature.
In this chapter, we elaborate on these two symptoms and the impulsive 
actions they involve. Self-harm and sensation seeking can cause emotional 
damage, physical injury, and sometimes even death. First, we look at some of 
the impulsive behaviors that people with BPD sometimes exhibit as they try 
to feed a need for excitement or fill a deep emotional emptiness. After explor-
ing the basics of impulsivity, we move on to self-mutilation, a shocking but 
common feature of BPD that also involves impulsive behaviors. Finally, we 
describe the thoughts and feelings that lie behind an extreme form of impul-
sive behavior — suicide threats and attempts.
Living Dangerously: Impulsive Behavior
Impulsivity involves two critical behavior problems. First, people who act 
impulsively tend to overlook the future, especially the negative outcomes 
that are likely to result from their present behaviors. Second, impulsive 
people don’t fully process information before acting. In other words, they 
don’t think before they act.

68
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
People with BPD have trouble controlling their impulses, or immediate 
wants and desires. They crave excitement and drama, and they crave it 
now — hence the term sensation seekers. They feel driven to fill the deep 
well of emptiness they feel inside, but with every impulsive behavior, they 
only increase their feelings of hollowness. The more they try to satisfy their 
insatiable cravings, the more their cravings grow. After they engage in an 
impulsive act, they usually report feeling momentarily better. However, those 
feelings of satisfaction are quickly replaced by enormous guilt, anxiety, and 
self-loathing.
People with BPD try to satisfy their sensation-seeking urges in many different 
ways. Here are some of the more common behaviors people with BPD rely on 
to satisfy their urges:
 
✓ Spending: Impulsive spending isn’t about walking by a colorful package 
in the grocery store and buying it on impulse. Most people do buy some-
thing on impulse from time to time. In contrast, though, problematic, 
impulsive spending involves out-of-control buying binges. Some people 
with BPD try to fill a void by purchasing excessive quantities of totally 
unnecessary stuff. Some impulsive spenders pile up debt like a mountain 
of trash in a landfill. People who spend impulsively may go on extrava-
gant vacations, spend too much on luxuries, and fill closets with clothes 
they rarely even wear — all to fill the emptiness within them.
 
✓ Gambling: Gambling is a rapidly growing problem in most developed 
countries. People who occasionally go to a casino and spend a prede-
termined amount of money don’t qualify as impulsive gamblers. Most 
people know that the odds of winning are with the casino, not the gam-
bler. However, some people with BPD ignore these odds and gamble 
with abandon. Sometimes they take out second mortgages to fuel their 
habits. They may even resort to forgery, embezzlement, and theft to 
raise the money they need to continue gambling. In most cases, like 
with impulsive spending, the motivation is to fill the emptiness they feel 
inside with a rush of excitement, but it never works — at least not in the 
long run.
 
✓ Binge eating: People with BPD sometimes try to regulate their emo-
tions and fill their feelings of emptiness by overeating. They gorge on 
an entire box of cookies, a carton of ice cream, or a huge bag of potato 
chips. They eat such large quantities that they often vomit, or at least 
feel acute discomfort, instead of feeling satisfied.
 
✓ Shoplifting: Occasionally, you read about a movie star or other famous, 
wealthy person who gets caught shoplifting. You probably wonder why 
people with loads of money risk jail time for something they can easily 
afford to buy. The answer lies in their need for excitement. People with 
BPD who are impulsive shoplifters fill the emptiness in their lives with 
the excitement — and maybe even fear — that comes with shoplifting. 
Sometimes they steal relatively worthless items just to give them away. 
Keep in mind that impulsive shoplifters aren’t people who steal because 
of dire economic conditions.

69
 Chapter 5: Sensation Seeking and Self-Harm: The Impulsivity of BPD
 
✓ Reckless driving: Reckless drivers ignore all the potential consequences 
of their behavior. They initiate reckless behavior to add excitement and 
a sense of danger to their lives. People with BPD who exhibit this risky 
behavior do amazingly dangerous things on the road — gun through 
stoplights, change lanes without signaling to other drivers, speed well 
beyond the limit, and execute hair-raising U-turns illegally. If you’re 
wondering whether impulsive reckless drivers end up in more accidents 
than other people, studies indicate that the answer is yes.
 
✓ Reckless sex: For many people, sex is exciting. People with BPD who 
exhibit impulsive behaviors often attempt to increase their level of 
excitement by seeking one new partner after another. Even while fear-
ing abandonment by their current partner, they often have affairs and 
engage in risky, unprotected sexual activities. They may feel seduced 
by sadomasochistic sex, group sex, partner swapping, or exhibitionism. 
To people who follow their sexual impulses, sex with someone new may 
represent an attempt to obtain the validation they didn’t receive as kids. 
Or, they may use sex to try to fill the emptiness they feel in their lives. 
Obviously, such impulsive sexual behavior greatly increases risks of 
sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and sometimes 
even violence.
 
✓ Substance abuse: Substance abuse is one of the most common forms 
of impulsivity that people engage in, whether they have BPD or not. 
Furthermore, the consumption of many substances (such as alcohol, 
marijuana, cocaine, or ecstasy) causes further loss of inhibition and trig-
gers more impulsive behaviors of other types. Some people with BPD 
abuse substances to try to regulate their out-of-control emotions. Others 
do so for the rush or high they crave to fill their endless emptiness. 
Unfortunately, substance abuse raises the risk of suicide in people with 
BPD who are already at high risk of self-induced death.
Impulsiveness partially explains why most people with BPD don’t live as long 
as people without the disorder. Whether because of suicide, car accidents, 
substance abuse, or simply unhealthy lifestyles, BPD all too often cuts life 
short.
Hurting for Help
Self-harm is a more dramatic impulsive symptom of BPD than the behav-
iors we describe in the preceding section. Many people assume that acts of 
self-injury or mutilation are suicide attempts; however, a desire to die isn’t 
usually the motive that drives someone to commit self-harm. Although some 
people who hurt themselves do eventually commit suicide, many people 
engage in the dangerous behaviors we describe in the following section for 
decades without ever attempting suicide.

70
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Types of self-harming acts
People with BPD commit a surprisingly diverse range of acts all meant to 
inflict pain or harm on themselves, including the following:
 
✓ Cutting: People who use this method of self-harm most commonly make 
cuts on their arms, legs, and abdomens. Some cutters try to hide their 
injuries, while others seek to display them. They use various tools, 
such as razor blades, scissors, paper clips, staples, needles, knives, and 
broken glass. Sometimes people even scratch themselves severely with 
their own fingernails.
 
✓ Burning: People often burn themselves with cigarettes, lighters, and 
matches. Typically, each burning act involves only a small area of the 
body; however, numerous scars may spread over time.
 
✓ Blunt force trauma: This category of self-harm includes pounding fists 
against walls, punching oneself, banging one’s head into something 
hard, and using a hammer or other tool to inflict pain to one’s own body. 
Blunt force trauma sometimes results in bruises, scars, wounds, and, in 
rare cases, broken bones.
 
✓ Skin picking and hair pulling: These acts include picking at cuticles 
and scabs, pulling out hair, and pinching the skin until it bleeds. These 
symptoms also sometimes accompany various other emotional disor-
ders and may be related to obsessive-compulsive disorder.
 
✓ Intentional accidents: Behaviors in this category of self-harm may 
appear accidental at first. However, some people with BPD purposely 
avoid taking reasonable precautions. They may have accidents at work 
or home that they could easily avoid by being more careful or by using 
basic safety equipment or clothing. As a result of not being careful, they 
may fall off ladders that they set up on unsteady ground or burn them-
selves while using broken sticks to rearrange logs in a fireplace.
 
✓ Rare behaviors: This category of self-harm includes rare but certainly 
not unheard of actions, including the following:
 
• Swallowing sharp objects
 
• Friction burning
 
• Eyeball pushing
 
• Biting one’s own body
 
• Inserting objects into bodily cavities
 
• Ingesting harmful but not fatal chemicals

71
 Chapter 5: Sensation Seeking and Self-Harm: The Impulsivity of BPD
Serious self-harming behaviors like the ones we list here afflict approximately 
2 million people in the United States alone, many of whom have BPD. Some 
acts of self-harm come to the attention of medical professionals only in emer-
gency rooms.
Why hurt yourself?
You may find yourself struggling to understand the idea that engaging in 
various acts of self-harm can actually provide relief to someone with BPD. 
Although you may wonder why some people want to hurt themselves, people 
with BPD and professionals who treat them have developed plenty of theo-
ries about the motivations behind these shocking and extremely painful 
behaviors. These motivations include the following:
 
✓ To get attention: Many professionals don’t believe that this motivation 
plays a large role in the reasoning behind most self-harming behaviors 
because most people who exhibit self-harm try to hide what they’ve 
done from others. Sometimes, though, people with BPD lack the skills 
they need to obtain appropriate nurture and support from others. 
Instead, they feel driven to hurt themselves as a way to seek help. In the 
end, these attention-seeking acts may elicit the concern and care that 
people with BPD need, but they’re desperate ways to reach this goal.
 
✓ To distract from emotional pain: Many experts, including ourselves, 
believe that people with BPD engage in self-harm as a way to deal with 
unbearable inner or emotional pain. Physical pain pales in comparison 
to what they feel internally, but it does pull attention away from their 
overwhelming emotions — at least temporarily.
 
✓ To feel better: When you injure your body, your brain releases natural 
pain killers called endorphins. These endorphins may facilitate a return 
to a less distressing emotional state. Thus, ironically, physical pain 
may actually help some people regulate their emotions. For a much less 
extreme example of the positive effects of endorphins, some people 
find appeal in eating hot chili peppers because eating them causes their 
bodies to release endorphins. Thus, even people who don’t suffer from 
severe emotional disorders can understand on some level the appeal of 
obtaining a rush of endorphins.
 
✓ To feel something other than numbness and emptiness: Some people 
with BPD report that they feel unreal and out of touch with the world 
around them (see Chapter 10 for more on this symptom of BPD). These 
people sometimes inflict pain on themselves to feel something “real.”
 
✓ To punish themselves: Although mental health professionals don’t know 
how often this motivation leads people with BPD to self-harming behav-
iors, some people do report that they believe they deserve punishment 
and abuse. In these cases, the self-harm may be a way for people to 
punish themselves.

72
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
 
✓ To get back at someone: Some people with BPD are unable to express 
anger appropriately and, as a result, hurt themselves to make others feel 
guilty for something they said or did.
 
✓ To reenact their own abuse: Many people with BPD report that they 
were abused during childhood (see Chapter 4 for more on the causes of 
BPD). Children often believe that they deserve the abuse they receive, 
and thus, as adults they sometimes continue the pattern of abuse on 
themselves.
These motivations represent interesting hypotheses. However, professionals 
don’t have enough data to determine which motives best account for self-
harm in people with BPD. The reasons for each individual most likely vary. 
Although you may find studying the reasons behind self-harming behaviors 
fascinating, people with BPD who hurt themselves may not find your insight 
helpful. In other words, insight into why people hurt themselves isn’t always 
enough to help them stop.
Although no situation of self-harm is really typical, the following story about 
Abigail illustrates how one person with BPD engages in this behavior to cope 
with her distress.
Abigail throws her cellphone across the room. She hears Ryan, her now 
ex-boyfriend, yelling on the phone. She picks up the phone and screams 
that he’ll be sorry he cheated on her. He pleads with her to settle down; 
after all, he only talked to someone else at work. She hangs up the phone. 
Now her rage changes to anxiety. She feels tense and desperate, and she 
can’t seem to catch her breath. The only escape from her searing pain 
is blood. She pulls the knife from her dresser drawer. The urge grows. 
Abigail pulls off her t-shirt. She slowly pushes the blade into the skin on 
her stomach. She experiences a single moment of delicious pain — then 
nothing. She watches the blood begin to flow and pulls the knife higher, 
watching more blood pour out of her stomach. She deliberately slices 
through a scab from the last time. Somehow the sight of blood calms 
her down and eases her into a state of peace. She slowly rocks back and 
forth.
In the preceding story, Abigail feels searing emotional pain and doesn’t know 
how to cope. She turns to cutting as a way of distracting herself from her 
overwhelming emotions. Chapter 16 offers ways to help people cope with 
their intense emotions in more effective ways.
 
Self-harming behaviors are always dangerous, and they typically escalate 
in severity and require treatment. See Part IV for some ideas about how to 
reduce self-harm.

73
 Chapter 5: Sensation Seeking and Self-Harm: The Impulsivity of BPD
Suicide: Seeking the Ultimate Escape
People with BPD are at a disturbingly high risk of eventually committing 
suicide. This risk terrifies the people who care about them and frightens the 
mental health providers who treat them. Studies suggest that as many as 
10 percent of people with BPD eventually commit suicide — and frequently 
precede the final act with numerous attempts. These suicidal acts are among 
the most serious and complex of the impulsive behaviors that sometimes 
afflict people with BPD.
A cry for help or an attempt at revenge?
People who live through suicide attempts usually report that they felt 
unbearable emotional pain before the attempt. They felt helpless and hope-
less about their options and their lives. They didn’t see any potential for a 
better future, and the thought of oblivion left them no alternate option.
Suicide attempts are sometimes desperate calls for help. Unfortunately, for 
people who succeed at suicide, help comes too late. For other people, suicide 
attempts seem to involve a need to get back at people in their lives who have 
wronged, abandoned, or hurt them. In these cases, people with suicidal urges 
seem to believe that they’ll be able to watch their foes feel guilt and remorse 
after their death.
Who’s at risk?
Mental health professionals want to have the ability to predict who has a 
particularly high risk of suicide and who has a lower risk, but so many factors 
play into who is at most risk that professionals can’t say exactly who will try 
suicide and who won’t. At the time of this writing, however, professionals do 
know that the diagnosis of BPD greatly increases the risk of suicide. Risks of 
suicide also seem to increase if a person has made previous suicidal attempts 
(or parasuicidal behaviors) or has experienced a suicide in the family. 
Professionals also know that substance abuse raises the risk of eventual sui-
cide. Studies that look at suicide suggest that people with BPD usually don’t 
commit suicide during adolescence or their 20s — suicide in people with BPD 
is more common during the third decade of life.
Assessing the risk of a given individual is an extremely difficult task, but 
psychotherapy for BPD does appear to lower the risk of suicide. In addition, 
whether treated or not, people with BPD usually experience a reduction of 
symptoms, including suicidal behaviors, in their 40s and 50s, so time eventu-
ally becomes an ally.

74
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
 
Although predicting suicide in someone with BPD is extremely difficult, 
you should seek professional help if your loved one exhibits the following 
behaviors:
 
✓ Shows a sharp loss of interest in things he or she used to enjoy in life
 
✓ Talks about feeling utterly hopeless and helpless
 
✓ Expresses the view that the world would be better off without him or 
her
 
✓ Talks about committing suicide
 
✓ Calls people to say goodbye
 
✓ Puts personal affairs in order
 
✓ Exhibits unusual calm for no clear reason after extended sadness
 
✓ Starts giving prized possessions away without cause
 
✓ Has experienced a serious recent loss
No one can reliably predict or prevent all suicides. If someone you care about 
commits suicide, it’s not your fault. But, if you believe that suicide may be 
imminent, call the police.
 
If you’re experiencing feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or the desire to 
end your life, seek help immediately.
Impulsive behaviors encompass only two of the major symptoms of BPD that 
we describe in Chapter 3. Not everyone who exhibits impulsivity (specifically 
sensation seeking, self-harm, or suicide) qualifies for a diagnosis of BPD. Some 
people who present these behaviors have bipolar disorder and only exhibit 
them when they’re experiencing an episode of mania (see Chapter 3 for more 
information about mania and bipolar disorder). Others have specific diagno-
ses like kleptomania (impulsive stealing), pathological gambling, or substance 
abuse and don’t show other signs of BPD. Furthermore, not everyone who 
has a diagnosis of BPD engages in the impulsive behaviors we describe in this 
chapter, but many do.

S
ome people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) get angry with 
little provocation, feel anxious over trivial matters, and experience 
despair when good things happen. Their feelings may change quickly, and 
they often have trouble settling down. Mental health professionals refer to 
these rapidly changing reactions as emotional dysregulation. Emotional dys-
regulation is a core symptom of BPD and causes much pain and chaos for the 
people who experience it.
In this chapter, we take a look at basic human emotions. We also explore the 
concept of emotional dysregulation. We explain how problems with dysregu-
lation cause people with BPD to react with intense fear, anxiety, depression, 
and anger to events that many people may consider trivial. Finally, we review 
the difficulty that people with BPD have in trying to identify and label the 
emotions they experience.
Emotions 101
Emotions are mental and physical responses to life events, which include 
anything that happens in the world as well as memories, thoughts, or images 
that pass through the mind. Emotions occur universally among all humans. 
Psychologists have identified six primary emotions that people all around the 
world experience. You can reliably identify the following primary emotions 
on other people’s faces:
 
✓ Happiness
 
✓ Sadness
 
✓ Anger

76
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
 
✓ Fear
 
✓ Disgust
 
✓ Surprise
Numerous words have evolved to discuss various levels and nuances of these 
six major emotions. Hence, you can describe happiness as joy, elation, and 
delight; or, you can say it’s the state of being upbeat, exhilarated, satisfied, 
pleased, blissful, radiant, merry, and so on. Words that describe fear include 
anxiety, terror, horror, nervousness, trepidation, distrust, worry, and alarm.
 
Cultures across the world vary enormously in the number of words they have 
for describing each of these major emotions. For example, the English lan-
guage has more than 2,000 words to describe emotion, whereas Taiwanese 
has only about 750. In contrast, the Chewong language (spoken by a small 
group of people living in Malaysia) has only 7 words that describe emotion.
Furthermore, some cultures have words that describe emotions that aren’t 
captured at all in other cultures. For example, the German language uses the 
word Schadenfreude, which means the unanticipated enjoyment a person 
feels because of the suffering of someone else. The German language goes 
further to distinguish between a secret Schadenfreude (withheld from the 
view of others) versus an open Schadenfreude (openly expressed scorn). We 
bet you can’t think of an equivalent word in English.
 
Emotions, even hateful ones, aren’t inherently right or wrong. What makes 
them healthy versus destructive is the way you express them.
Both philosophers and scientists actively debate about what emotions are, 
how to categorize them, and what parts of the body they involve. One group 
tends to focus on the physical changes within the body that occur in con-
junction with emotions, and the other group argues that emotions have more 
to do with thoughts than the body’s physical reactions. Both perspectives 
have value in terms of the role emotions play in BPD. We describe these two 
approaches to emotion in the following sections.
Primitive emotions
Some professionals approach emotions by looking at the relationship 
between the body’s physical reactions and emotions. They believe people 
react instinctively with little or no thought to some events — even when 
they encounter the event for the first time. For example, fears of falling, loud 
noises, abandonment, and some predators, such as snakes and spiders, seem 
to elicit certain genetic-encoded, instinctual responses from a person’s body, 
which, in turn, lead that person to feel certain emotions. In other words, 
these physical responses are preprogrammed to warn people of possible 

77
 Chapter 6: Explosive Feelings and Moods
danger and get them ready to respond. The emotions that these bodily reac-
tions cause are called primitive emotions. People with BPD may have super-
charged physical responses to fears, which, in turn, lead to overreactive 
emotions. (See Chapter 3 for more on the symptoms of BPD and Chapter 4 for 
more on the biological influences on the emergence of BPD.)
Normal responses
Professionals in one camp believe that emotions have more to do with the 
physical body than thoughts (see the “Thoughtful emotions” section for the 
other side of this issue). They assert that the responses your body has to 
certain events actually cause your emotions. In other words, you feel sad 
because you cry or feel anxious because you tremble. Your body sends sig-
nals to your mind, which, in turn, causes you to feel particular emotions. The 
following list provides several bodily responses. The emotions that follow 
these bodily reactions can include fear, anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, 
or surprise.
 
✓ Muscle tension
 
✓ Increased heart rate
 
✓ Increased blood pressure
 
✓ Sweating
 
✓ Smiling
 
✓ Laughing
 
✓ Gagging
 
✓ Jumping
 
✓ Pupils dilating or constricting
 
✓ Salivating
 
✓ Frowning
BPD responses
Some research has indicated that people with BPD have more intense startle 
responses to events than people who don’t have BPD. One study looked 
at the reactions of people when they were startled with unexpected static 
noise at the same time that they were shown a random series of words that 
had either neutral meanings (such as regular or collect) or negative mean-
ings (such as abandon or hate). People with BPD were more reactive to 
the sounds than the other group, especially when the words they saw had 
negative meanings. This study, which was reported in the journal Biological 
Psychiatry in 2007, concluded that the unstable emotional responses of 
people with BPD may be related to an exaggerated startle response.

78
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Paradoxically, other research has failed to demonstrate that people with 
BPD have stronger bodily responses following the same types of events. For 
example, in one study, people with and without BPD were shown unpleasant 
images and had the same physical responses (including startle responses 
and decreased heart rates). These contradicting findings have puzzled scien-
tists because many mental health professionals believe that people with BPD 
do indeed react with greater emotional intensity than other people. Possible 
explanations for this inconsistency include
 
✓ People with BPD sometimes dissociate or mentally remove themselves 
from stressful events. In turn, this dissociation may mute their physical 
reactions.
 
✓ Some of the methods that scientists have used in studies to trigger emo-
tion may not be equivalent to natural emotion-evoking events. In other 
words, people with BPD may indeed respond with more intense bodily 
reactions to real events, but scientists may simply have failed to capture 
the essence of such events in their studies.
 
✓ People with BPD may not experience stronger bodily reactions to 
events; instead, they may simply believe or think that their emotions are 
stronger than those of other people. As a result, they report stronger 
emotions during studies.
Still other studies have focused on self-reported emotions rather than bodily 
responses that people with BPD feel in response to various types of events. 
These studies suggest that people with BPD report more intense emotions 
than people without the disorder. For example, one study asked participants 
with and without BPD to carry around devices like personal digital assistants 
(PDAs) throughout the day. The device beeped at random times during the 
day, and the participants recorded their emotional states each time they 
received a signal. This research consistently demonstrated that people 
with BPD do claim to have more intensely negative reactions to events than 
people without the disorder. Furthermore, people with BPD reported that 
their emotions were also more variable and unstable.
Thoughtful emotions
Other professionals connect emotions more to thoughts than to the body’s 
responses. They believe that how people interpret events ultimately causes 
emotions. For instance, a gun pointed at your head doesn’t cause you to 
tremble and sweat profusely; what does cause you to tremble is the meaning 
that a gun holds for you — danger or even death. If you’d grown up in some 
remote village where guns didn’t exist, you probably would respond to a gun 
with mere curiosity, not fear, because your thoughts about a gun don’t con-
nect it to fear. So, the meaning that people give to events (or things) directly 
causes emotions.

79
 Chapter 6: Explosive Feelings and Moods
Studies have shown that people with BPD have a strong tendency to view 
events more negatively than other people. (See Chapter 9 for more informa-
tion about the ways that people with BPD view events in distorted ways.) 
These distortions in thinking can cause substantial emotional turmoil 
because thoughts play a large role in emotions.
On the other hand, people who are able to regulate their emotions effec-
tively use logic and reasoning to reinterpret events in a less threatening way, 
which, in turn, leads them to experience less-extreme emotions. For example, 
a woman with BPD may interpret her husband’s business trip as evidence 
that he’s having an affair and is likely to leave her. In contrast, a woman with-
out BPD may have the same initial thought that her husband may be having 
an affair, but she can quickly dismiss the thought by reviewing the positive 
aspects of her marriage.
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that reason should triumph 
over emotions in a balanced life. He warned against the danger of excessive 
emotions as well as overly restrained emotions. See Part IV for numerous 
ideas about how to follow Aristotle’s sage advice.
Emotions — Borderline Style
Tuning into the emotional life of someone with a healthy personality is like 
listening to a symphony orchestra (see Chapter 2 for more on healthy per-
sonalities). The score has high notes and low notes, periods of soft tones 
and crashing crescendos. The performance as a whole has an ebb and flow. 
Similarly, emotions may rise and fall in a person with a healthy personality, 
but the entire experience has a certain coherence — everything seems to fit 
together.
On the other hand, turning an ear to the emotional life of a person with BPD 
is more like listening to an orchestra made up of amateurs who have never 
practiced or played their assigned instruments. Highs and lows come and 
go at random, crescendos blast louder and last longer than you expect, and 
coherence is hard to find in the performance.
Numerous studies have shown that people with BPD experience negative 
emotions more often than people with healthy personalities do. They have 
more anxiety, sadness, anger, and jealousy than most people. At the same 
time, they appear to experience less elation or happiness. Their emotions 
race from 0 to 60 in mere seconds, and calming their emotions takes longer 
than you may expect.

80
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Furthermore, the events that trigger the negative emotions of people with 
BPD don’t have to be huge or life altering because people with BPD often see 
the world through a dark, distrusting, and distorted lens. They tend to think 
the world revolves around them and, as a result, often personalize happen-
ings — big or small — that have little or nothing to do with them. In addition 
to these distorted thought processes, people with BPD sometimes overreact 
because they have a genetic predisposition to do so (see Chapter 4 for more 
information on the biological factors that affect BPD).
People with BPD often rage at the people who care about them the most. 
They blame others and refuse to accept responsibility for their out-of-control 
emotions. In the following story, Isabella (a young woman who has BPD) 
turns what could’ve been a happy celebration into a nightmare.
Isabella bounces into the kitchen, happy and excited. “Sam, guess what?” 
she exclaims holding up a letter, “I’ve been accepted into grad school!”
“That’s great news. Let’s go out and celebrate. We may not have much 
time to go out after you start the program,” Sam replies.
Isabella frowns, suddenly angry. “What do you mean we won’t have 
time?”
“What? I’m so proud of you — I was just joking,” Sam says cautiously.
“You can’t say anything positive about anything, can you? You always 
ruin my success with your sarcasm,” Isabella’s voice gets louder. “Forget 
celebrating. You’ve just wrecked another evening. I can’t believe you’re 
so negative all the time!”
“Isabella, please, don’t be angry with me. I’m really glad you were 
accepted. Can’t we start this conversation over?”
Isabella stalks off, refuses to talk, and rips her acceptance letter into 
shreds. Sam knows that her tantrum can last a minute or several hours. 
He hears her slamming drawers, throwing things, and sobbing in the bed-
room, followed by silence. Afraid that she may be cutting herself again, 
he goes to her. He finds her sitting on the bedroom floor.
“I feel horrible Sam; I’ll never be happy. I should forget about grad school 
and end everything now!” she screeches.
Sam shouts, “Stop it, Isabella! Stop it right now! You’re out of control! 
Calm down!”
“Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me,” Isabella pleads and sobs. She 
runs out of the apartment.
Sam shakes his head in disbelief. He’s never threatened to hit her, and 
the thought has never occurred to him.

81
 Chapter 6: Explosive Feelings and Moods
Isabella is quick to anger, overinterprets the meaning of Sam’s neutral com-
ments, and isn’t easily talked down from her rage. She shifts from rage to 
terror in just seconds. Yet, she needs several hours to calm down from her 
emotional storm. Because of her intense emotions, Isabella acts very impul-
sively when she thinks about ending her life and runs screaming out of the 
apartment (see Chapter 5 for more information about impulsivity and how it 
plays a part in BPD).
Not only do people with BPD have extremely strong emotions, but they also 
struggle to realize how these emotions affect their lives. The next section dis-
cusses the difficulty they have in recognizing and expressing emotions.
Struggling to recognize 
and express emotions
Many people with BPD suffer from yet another emotional problem — they 
seem oblivious to their current emotional states. They don’t reflect on their 
feelings or try to label them; instead, they act out their feelings without even 
being aware of what emotions they’re feeling. They lack the insight they need 
to understand their emotions, which is almost like not having a vocabulary 
for describing their emotions.
For example, a man with BPD may shout and talk rapidly while shaking his 
finger, yet at the same time, deny that he feels angry. Or, a woman with BPD 
may smile while talking about ending her life. Sometimes people with BPD 
who can’t maintain control of their emotions demonstrate a profound discon-
nection between how they express emotions and what they say they feel. 
This struggle to recognize and express emotions confuses family members, 
friends, and even therapists.
In contrast, studies have shown that some people with BPD are unusually 
sensitive to the facial expressions of other people. When they see pictures of 
faces of other people, they actually perceive negative emotions with surpris-
ing accuracy. However, they also see more negativity than exists in neutral 
faces.
Having emotions about emotions
People with BPD who exhibit emotional difficulties tend to have more anxi-
ety, depression, jealousy, and rage than most people do. However, they make 
themselves even more miserable by feeling bad about feeling bad. They 
become depressed because of their anxiety and anger. They wallow in guilt 
and despair because of their jealousy and rage. They get emotional about 
being emotional, and they get stuck in a cycle of recurring — and often self-
inflicted — misery.

Problems and BPD
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what identity is
▶ Developing identity in the 21st century
▶ Exploring borderline identities and their effects
You’ve heard about identity theft. You may even be one of the many 
people who worry about losing their identities to thieves digging 
through dumpsters, looking for loose credit card receipts. Because so many 
people do worry about identity theft, personal paper shredder sales have 
skyrocketed over the past few years.
Some people worry more about losing their identities to theft than about 
being mugged at gunpoint because the notion of losing oneself — even just 
one’s financial self — is especially disturbing.
In this chapter, we spend some time illustrating what identity actually means, 
as well as describing its development and evolution over time. We take a look 
at both the positive and negative aspects of identities. We want you to be 
familiar with this information before we move on to explain the identity prob-
lems people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often experience. See 
Chapter 17 for techniques for managing identity problems. (Sorry, we can’t 
help you with identity theft.)
The Concept of Identity
Most people think of themselves as having their own identities. They know 
what to say when someone asks them to identify themselves. For example, 
when a police officer asks you who you are, you probably state your name 
and take out your driver’s license. However, personal identity is much more 
complex than a simple ID card. We look at the concept of identity in this 
section.

84
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Defining identity
Identity is a theory or concept that someone creates to synthesize informa-
tion and knowledge about the self. In other words, your identity is your own 
personal attempt to capture the core elements that make you who you are. 
Identity evolves over time as it takes on varying areas of emphasis. For exam-
ple, a 2-month-old baby has no sense of gender, but when that child is 13 
years old, she probably thinks a lot about the importance of gender. In grade 
school, kids don’t usually have much of a career identity, but this important 
sphere takes on great meaning in young adulthood.
Personality, on the other hand, describes broad character traits that other 
people can see (take a look at Chapter 2 for more on personality). Identity is 
more personal in nature than personality. In other words, identity involves 
value judgments that people make about themselves, not judgments that 
other people make about them. For example, wealth has little or nothing to 
do with personality directly; however, sometimes people tie much of their 
self-worth and identities to their accumulation — or lack thereof — of money.
Thus, people can have outgoing personalities and be either rich or poor. 
Their wealth doesn’t automatically have a strong effect on their personalities. 
For instance, some rich people feel like their money has little to do with who 
they are as people. On the other hand, some wealthy people feel like their 
identities — who they are and what they value — are wrapped around their 
possessions.
Like personality, an identity can be healthy or unhealthy. Healthy identities 
stand on a foundation of sturdy, varied values. They don’t center on a single 
aspect of a person. For example, a healthy identity can encompass multiple 
sources of self-worth. In contrast, an unhealthy identity has a restricted 
scope and usually derives worth from only a few elements.
People incorporate just a few or, hopefully, many aspects of their lives in 
their identities, including the following:
 
✓ Artistic talent
 
✓ Knowledge
 
✓ Wealth
 
✓ Gender
 
✓ Hobbies
 
✓ Accomplishments
 
✓ Career
 
✓ Relationships
 
✓ Status and prestige
✓ Religion
✓ Values
✓ Priorities
✓ Physical appearance
✓ Health
✓ Place of residence
✓ Cultural affiliation
✓ Age

85
 Chapter 7: Missing Persons: Identity Problems and BPD
To form your identity, you likely look at these various aspects of your life and 
attempt to describe who you are based on which facets you value the most. 
Personal identity is like a story about your life. For example, someone who 
values friendships will have a life story, or identity, that emphasizes friend-
ships. For healthy identities, these stories have coherence and some degree 
of continuity, and, thus, your identities can guide your decisions and choices. 
However, if your identity is scrambled and lacks continuity, it can’t readily 
guide your life choices.
Terms that many mental health professionals consider similar to identity 
include self-concept, self-esteem, self-awareness, self-confidence, self-
satisfaction, and self-importance. Although a group of psychologists can 
talk for hours about the nuances that distinguish each term from the 
others, all the terms capture a similar idea — who you are. We look at 
developing and defining who you are in the next sections.
Developing identity
Identities develop and change over the course of lifetimes. Identities become 
more complex and incorporate more aspects of the self with age. Some peri-
ods in life present greater challenges to identity development than others. In 
the following sections, we describe the basic stages of identity development.
Beginning the process of identity formation
Babies begin developing their sense of self early in life. Hopefully, within the 
first few months, they begin to learn that other people perceive and respond 
to their discomforts. They slowly differentiate between themselves and their 
caregivers. As they begin to make these distinctions, interactions between 
infants and their caregivers are critical in the establishment of identity 
because, depending on their care, infants learn how what they do affects 
others in their world.
Identity develops much further as children’s worlds expand to include 
extensive interaction with other kids. A particularly critical time in identity 
development appears to be between the ages of 4 and 6 when children learn 
a crucial concept — that other people have thoughts and ideas that are dif-
ferent from their own. Also during this phase, children acquire the ability to 
understand what other people are likely thinking and feeling in various situ-
ations. When either genes or social experiences interfere with this develop-
ment, children become much more inept at dealing with other people, which 
may eventually lead to the development of BPD in adulthood.

86
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
 
The core mechanism that allows for self-reflection, identity development, and 
the ability to relate to others is known as theory of mind. Theory of mind is 
knowing that others think thoughts that may differ from your own and under-
standing the psychological and emotional states of other people. People with 
BPD typically don’t have a well-developed theory of mind, which leads them to 
have trouble relating well to others.
Finding identity during middle childhood
From the ages of about 6 to 12, children’s identities continue to grow. The 
ability to regulate emotions, one of the skills that helps foster the develop-
ment of a healthy identity, usually occurs during this time of life. Other 
important aspects of positive identity development that often emerge at this 
time include mastering schoolwork, getting along well with other children, 
and acquiring basic mental and physical skills. When children fail to acquire 
the ability to regulate emotions and these other basic skills, they often expe-
rience tumultuous adolescent years, which can impair their identity develop-
ment as adults.
People with BPD may have some highly developed skills (for example, they 
may be highly intelligent or extremely detail oriented), but they often fail 
to acquire the ability to moderate their emotions. As a result, roller coaster 
emotions that skyrocket and plummet at the slightest provocation character-
ize many people with BPD.
Refining identity in adolescence
Long ago, identity was fairly fixed by the end of middle childhood. After all, 
parents and teachers pushed kids into predetermined roles. Girls learned 
homemaking skills in preparation for marriage, and boys learned predeter-
mined trades and apprenticeships.
In the modern world, however, identity has become an especially poignant 
issue during adolescence. Adolescents try on and experiment with vari-
ous identities, which psychologists refer to as possible selves. Through this 
experimentation process, they discard some of these possible selves and 
hold onto others. The downside to all this experimentation is that juggling all 
these possibilities can be rather stressful. See Chapter 4 for more information 
about the pressures of modern-day adolescence.
Even people who don’t develop BPD find adolescence to be a stressful period 
of life. So the fact that the major symptoms of BPD start showing up by early 
adolescence seems only natural. After all, pressures mount to establish a 
clear sense of self during adolescence, and many people with emerging BPD 
can’t clearly define who they are during adulthood much less during their 
teenage years.

87
 Chapter 7: Missing Persons: Identity Problems and BPD
Anchoring identity in adulthood
Ideally, you manage to get through the challenges of adolescence with a 
reasonable, balanced sense of self. Your adolescent identity likely has some 
complexity and includes a variety of elements, but, if it’s a healthy identity, 
it also maintains a coherent set of themes. If one aspect of your identity is 
threatened, you may need to call on other facets of the self to buffer the emo-
tional distress.
For example, if a father loses his job, he may be able to remind himself that 
he has many positive attributes, such as his roles as a parent and a husband, 
his intelligence, his geniality, and his resourcefulness. These qualities not 
only protect him from a massive assault on his self-esteem — which sudden 
unemployment often causes — but also give him confidence that another 
employer is likely to see him as a desirable applicant.
The ability to use different facets of one’s identity to help deal with emo-
tional distress is one key element of a healthy identity. People with BPD often 
struggle to maintain emotional stability when parts of their identities are 
threatened.
Like many people with BPD, Tyler, a 25-year-old marketing consultant, had an 
imperfect adolescence. However, the combination of fairly good genes, a few 
good role models, some decent opportunities, and a lack of serious abuse or 
trauma allowed him to overcome a less-than-perfect adolescence and form a 
healthy identity.
Tyler reflects on his life and feels okay about himself. He experienced 
what he now considers a challenging childhood. His parents divorced 
when he was 4, and each one found a new partner. Tyler had to move 
around quite a bit, but his parents did manage to keep him in the same 
school system. During high school, he did some drugs and abused alco-
hol. His grades were fair, but he never did much studying. He rebelled 
against his parents by not caring about school and his future, and he 
seemed depressed at times. He didn’t find real meaning in life until he 
went to college and discovered a love for traveling and learning. Without 
the need to rebel, he excelled at school. Eventually, he realized that his 
life was pretty good and that he was treated fairly well. Now, in adult-
hood, his emotions are well under control. He still drinks a bit too much, 
but he enjoys his many friends and interests. Good genes, no extreme 
abuse, and the ability to delay gratification, which he learned in college, 
can account for Tyler’s relatively good adjustment to life.
Tyler, like many people, had a moderately challenging adolescence. 
Nevertheless, like most teens, he made it through the difficult years reason-
ably unscathed. He now has the capacity to further develop his identity in a 
balanced way as his adulthood unfolds. People who develop BPD experience 
far more ongoing problems with their personal identities than Tyler did.

88
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Borderline Identity: Unstable and Fragile
People with BPD have identities that differ from those of other people. Their 
identities show less stability and less coherence. In addition, people with 
BPD often overreact to minor threats to their frail identities. We discuss 
these two issues in the next sections.
Waffling identities
Although everyone behaves inconsistently at times, people with BPD exhibit 
huge fluctuations in attitudes, values, and feelings of identity. The difference 
between the identities of a person without BPD and a person with BPD is a 
lot like the difference between a well-edited movie of someone’s life and an 
unorganized box jammed full of photos from that same life. Here are a few 
contrasting examples:
 
✓ A woman without BPD values honesty, and as a result, her identity has 
a stable, coherent sense of basic honesty. Thus, 99 percent of the time, 
she is quite straightforward with people. She’s someone people feel they 
can count on for the truth. However, at a friend’s house for dinner, she 
compliments the host for the cooking even though she doesn’t like the 
food at all. She maintains her honest identity and accepts the fact that 
some circumstances call for minor lies. Her life’s coherent movie main-
tains the basic theme of honesty.
 
✓ A woman with BPD sometimes feels she’s an honest person and gener-
ally is honest. However, when she lies to her friend about her cooking, 
she feels a rush of self-loathing and disgust for her dishonest behavior. 
This situation may lead her to become angry at her friend for “making” 
her tell a lie. She can’t hold onto her basic identity of being honest in the 
face of a minor indiscretion. In a way, her sense of who she is changes 
with each photo that’s plucked out of her life’s box.
 
✓ A man with BPD may consider himself extremely righteous and devoted 
to his family. However, he frequently has affairs and loses his temper 
when his kids fail to meet his expectations in the slightest way. After he 
flips into these obnoxious episodes, he briefly feels horrible about him-
self. But within hours or days, he rapidly regains his self-image of being 
righteous and devoted. His view of himself changes dramatically as each 
picture is taken from the box.
Lacking a strong, stable sense of their own identities, many people with BPD 
attempt to adopt whichever identity they believe their current partners or 
friends want them to have. They believe that doing so can make them very 

89
 Chapter 7: Missing Persons: Identity Problems and BPD
appealing to their potential partners or friends because they may appear like 
the very personification of their friends’ dreams. However, the inherent insta-
bility of their personal identities makes maintaining the façades impossible to 
do. See Chapter 8 for more information about the effects this issue has on the 
relationships that people with BPD tend to have throughout life.
Responding to worries about identity
When people with BPD have significant worries about their identities and 
self-worth, one of two situations likely occurs:
 
✓ They desperately attempt to hold onto their fragile sense of self-worth 
by striking out in rage.
 
✓ Their identity and self-worth crumble, and they fall into a cycle of 
despair.
Table 7-1 illustrates how some people with BPD use these two strategies in 
response to various concerns about their identities.

broke!”
“I’ll never get anywhere. 
I don’t have the discipline 
because of my mental 
illness. I’m hopeless.”

You can imagine what effect these ways of responding to identity concerns 
have on the people who care about those with BPD. They may feel confused, 
angry, and mystified by their BPD partner’s behaviors because they don’t 
realize the underlying problems with identity that cause the intense reac-
tions. See Chapter 8 for more information about the stormy relationships 
people with BPD often have.
See Part V for more ideas about how to cope with these identity issues when 
you care about someone with BPD.

I
f you’re in a relationship with someone who has borderline personality 
disorder (BPD), you may be confused by the mixed-up communications 
and unexpected emotional reactions you receive from your lover, colleague, 
or friend. You may feel misunderstood and puzzled because one day you’re 
wonderful in your friend’s eyes and the next you’re the worst person in the 
world. You likely wonder what you can do to make things better.
The first step to improving the situation is becoming more aware of what’s 
going on. People with BPD have serious problems with relationships. Overall, 
they have more broken relationships, problems getting along at work, and 
arguments with relatives and friends than most people do. People with BPD 
marry somewhat less often than other people and usually have fewer children.
In this chapter, we describe the problems people with BPD often have in 
getting along with others. These problems are the result of their extreme 
inability to stand back from situations and understand other people’s per-
spectives. The ability to step back requires three different but related skills 
that people with BPD typically lack:
 
✓ Ability to understand the needs, feelings, and beliefs of other people
 
✓ Ability to see how other people perceive them
 
✓ Ability to see how their own behavior affects others
The problems with understanding other people’s needs, feelings, and per-
spectives lead people with BPD to run over the boundaries of other people. 
They place excessive demands on people, feel entitled to special treatment, 
and become enraged when they don’t get what they want. We discuss all 
these issues and more in this chapter.

Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Standing in Other People’s Shoes
Perspective taking involves being able to comprehend the views, feelings, and 
needs of other people. Having this ability often leads to success in relation-
ships, school performance, and job performance, as well as empathy for 
others. Good therapists have this skill in abundance. However, this capacity 
isn’t something that everyone shares.
In fact, babies don’t come into the world with the ability to understand that 
other people have views that differ from their own. Instead, this skill evolves 
through at least young adulthood, if not beyond. Furthermore, in any particu-
lar person, the ability to understand other people’s perspectives varies over 
time. For example, someone who normally has good empathy for others can 
show no understanding of another driver after ice on the road causes that 
driver to run into him. Life stressors as well as experiences can cause some 
shift in a person’s ability to understand other people.
This section takes a look at how perspective taking affects people with BPD 
and the ones they love.
Understanding other people
Sometimes people with BPD appear surprisingly able to read cues from other 
people. They seem almost able to enter other people’s psyches and become 
one and the same. However, most of the time, people with BPD utterly fail to 
grasp the reasons behind and the implications of what people are thinking 
and feeling. In other words, they know what others are feeling, but they don’t 
understand why they’re feeling that way or what their feelings mean.
The following story about Jasmine, a woman with BPD, and Carlos, her boy-
friend, illustrates the skill of picking up cues yet misinterpreting the meaning 
of those cues.
Jasmine arrives home and sees her boyfriend, Carlos, draped across the 
couch watching the news. She greets him with a quick kiss and immedi-
ately launches into a description of her busy day. Carlos, still immersed 
in his television show doesn’t respond. “Hey baby,” she moves closer to 
him, “you seem out of it. What’s wrong?”
Jasmine has correctly discerned that Carlos isn’t paying attention to her. 
Carlos sits up, immediately cautious, “I was just interested in this show; 
the stock market is down again. I’m sorry, what did you say?”
“Well, obviously nothing important to you,” Jasmine retorts. Although 
she sees something is going on with Carlos, she misinterprets the mean-
ing of his inattentiveness. He was simply absorbed by the stock market, 
but she assumes he has no interest in her.

93
 Chapter 8: Perceiving, Understanding, and Relating to Others
Carlos sighs, knowing that he has to be very careful or there will be 
another fight, something he wants to avoid. “Jasmine, I’m always inter-
ested in your day. I’m really sorry that I didn’t hear you. Don’t make this a 
big deal; it wasn’t to me. Come on, tell me again.”
“So now you’re telling me that I’m not a big deal. Forget it. Watch your 
stupid show.”
Carlos realizes that he’s on a treadmill going nowhere. He sees no way of 
getting through to Jasmine. Nothing he says at this point will make things 
okay. So he says nothing, and she leaves the room.
Jasmine was quite accurate in perceiving Carlos’s distraction. To that degree, 
she was able to take his perspective. But she goes awry when she misinter-
prets his inattentive mood as a personal slight. She proceeds to interpret 
everything else he has to say in the same way. Her ability to take another per-
son’s perspective is impaired.
Therapists who work with people who have BPD often report that their BPD 
patients have a difficult time seeing things from other perspectives. For 
example, a therapist may arrive at a session feeling a little tired or distracted. 
His client with BPD sees the mood alteration and may accuse the therapist of 
not caring or of being angry.
Being unable to take the perspectives of other people obviously hampers 
good, long-term relationships. Not surprisingly, this inability can bog down a 
therapeutic relationship and make intimacy almost impossible. We show you 
how you can improve your perception skills in Chapter 18.
Seeing yourself through 
other people’s eyes
Taking other people’s perspectives includes being able to see yourself as 
others see you. Unfortunately, most people with BPD have serious deficits 
in this skill, as well. They engage in a variety of problematic behaviors and 
emotional outbursts without understanding how other people will see those 
behaviors. After all, they see their own behaviors as quite rational and rea-
sonable. The behaviors and emotions that they exhibit and that others per-
ceive as outrageous or controlling include the following:
 
✓ Jealousy: Anxiety over the possibility of being abandoned drives many 
people with BPD to act intensely jealous by calling their partners exces-
sively, seeking constant reassurance, and checking up on their partners’ 
every move. They don’t understand that behaviors like these often 
annoy other people and drive them away.

94
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
 
✓ Seductiveness: Often without being aware of how their behaviors 
appear to other people, many people with BPD engage in sexualized, 
seductive gestures, facial expressions, and touches that are far from 
benign or meaningless. They often act surprised or even outraged when 
others respond with sexual advances of their own. Other times, people 
with BPD have affairs at the same time that they’re jealous of such a pos-
sibility in their partners.
 
✓ Anger: People with BPD don’t understand why their aggressive out-
bursts cause others to either avoid them altogether or approach them 
with trepidation. We discuss this emotion in detail in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Hysteria: People with BPD tend to respond to everyday stressors with 
excessive emotionality. Whether their irritation turns into rage, their 
sadness turns into profound dysphoria, their pleasure morphs into 
ecstasy, or their worry converts into terror, they respond at far higher 
levels of intensity than most situations warrant.
 
✓ Impulsivity: Whether they take part in self-mutilation, suicide attempts, 
threats, or out-of-control spending, people with BPD don’t know how to 
put breaks on their behavior. We discuss this symptom of BPD in detail 
in Chapter 5.
Although you can read about these behaviors in various chapters throughout 
this book, the point we want to make here is that people with BPD engage 
in these behaviors with almost no awareness of how their behaviors look 
to other people. So, when they explode, they don’t realize that their anger 
appears wildly inappropriate to other people. The following story about 
Karen, Dawn’s mother-in-law who has BPD, shows how oblivious people with 
BPD can be to the impact of their behavior on others.
Dawn is staying with her mother-in-law, Karen, while her husband is out 
of town for a few days. Dawn inadvertently puts a silver-plated butter 
knife into the dishwasher. Later, Karen unloads the dishwasher and 
spies the knife. She carries the knife into the living room, where Dawn is 
reading a novel. Shaking the knife at her, Karen yells, “Are you so utterly 
stupid that you don’t know not to put silver in a dishwasher?”
Dawn replies, “Gosh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it was silver. I’m really 
sorry.”
“Sorry won’t replace the knife. You’re just trash; you can’t even appreci-
ate fine things. I wish my son could’ve picked someone more refined.”
Dawn blushes and retreats to her bedroom. She calls her husband and 
asks him what’s wrong with his mother. She tells him, “I don’t think I can 
ever trust her about anything.”
Her husband sighs and says, “I know; that’s my childhood you’re looking 
at. Just talk about the weather or something. I’ll be back tomorrow.”

95
 Chapter 8: Perceiving, Understanding, and Relating to Others
Dawn says, “I really don’t know if I can ever stay here again.”
The next morning Karen greets Dawn with a warm smile and a cup of 
coffee. She says, “How about we go to the mall today?”
Dawn, now totally confused, says, “Oh, sure.” Taking her husband’s 
advice, she adds, “It looks like it’ll be a nice day for shopping.”
Karen has a rich history of searching for friends and not finding or keeping 
them. She can’t understand why other people remain so aloof. She can’t see 
herself and her actions through their eyes.
Karen believes that after an incident is over, it’s over. She fails to understand 
that Dawn now sees her as a volcano ready to erupt. Karen never compre-
hends why Dawn seems so distant in the ensuing years. In fact, Karen has no 
idea how Dawn feels about her.
Causing unintended hurt
Loving someone with BPD isn’t easy because people with BPD not only fail 
to understand how others feel about them, but they also fail to see how they 
impact others. For those who care about people with BPD, the experience of 
their relationship can be frightening and hurtful at the same time. However, 
people with BPD are so focused on their own emotional distress and turmoil 
that they can’t step back and see the pain and suffering they cause others.
The ability to take other people’s perspectives is a crucial part of getting 
along in relationships. Being able to see how other people think and feel 
enables you to successfully relate to friends, colleagues, and lovers.
 
People with BPD are truly deficient in understanding the nature of other peo-
ple’s thoughts and feelings. They’re not purposely trying to hurt themselves 
or others.
The following story about Gary, a man who has BPD, and his wife, Denise, 
depicts Gary’s unawareness of how his behavior profoundly affects his 
wife. Often people with BPD are astonished when their spouses leave them. 
Outsiders, on the other hand, aren’t so surprised.
“Denise, did you get my jeans washed?” Gary asks.
“Yep, they should be on top of your dresser with all the other folded 
clothes for the trip,” Denise replies. “By the way, we need to leave for the 
airport in about 15 minutes. Traffic can be bad at this time of day.”

96
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Gary looks at his watch. He knows all about getting stuck in traffic and 
being late for the airport. Anger pulses through his body. He purposely 
slows down his pace and starts to stall. As the time they’re supposed to 
leave gets closer, he can see that Denise is ready. She’s looking at the 
boarding passes and making sure that she has both passports. He hates 
the fact that she’s so organized and throws it in his face. His suitcase 
remains half full on the bed, and it’s time to go.
Denise is aware that Gary gets tense before trips. She tries to stay out 
of his way and be as helpful as she can — unfortunately, it never works. 
She carries her suitcase out to the car, checks the locks, and leaves on a 
couple of lights. With no time built in for traffic, Gary rushes out with his 
suitcase and speeds down the driveway. Neither of them speaks during 
the tense trip to the airport.
On the plane, Denise orders a drink to calm her nerves. She knows that 
Gary disapproves, but drinking in front of Gary somehow gives her a 
sense of control. Gary, full of rage, holds his newspaper so that she can’t 
see his face. Denise settles down with a novel, knowing that this will be 
another trip of silence. She brushes away a few tears.
Denise knows that Gary suffers from BPD and that he doesn’t seem to be 
able to control his emotional responses. She tries not to take his moodi-
ness personally, but, through the years, she has become more and more 
withdrawn, afraid, hurt, and angry. One day she will leave him.
Gary’s mind is so totally absorbed by his own misery that he simply can’t see 
how hurtful his behavior is to Denise. He has no idea that she will leave him 
one day even though abandonment is one of his greatest fears.
Busting through Boundaries
Fences set the boundary lines around property, but people have boundaries, 
too. Personal boundaries set the rules, limits, expectations, and even per-
sonal space that people desire. Like different people, different cultures also 
tend to have somewhat different boundaries.
For example, citizens of the United States usually stand a couple of feet apart 
when conversing. People in Latin America, France, and the Arab region often 
prefer to stand somewhat closer, and people from Japan and Germany stand 
a little farther apart. If you’ve traveled abroad, you may have felt uncomfort-
able with the space expectations of the citizens of the country you visited.
Space is only one of many boundaries that people set with the hopes that 
others will respect them. For example, you probably wouldn’t make a social 
call in the middle of the night because you wouldn’t want to greatly annoy 
your friend. And, you may know that when you call a potential new love inter-
est too often, that person may feel like your crossing an important boundary.

97
 Chapter 8: Perceiving, Understanding, and Relating to Others
People with BPD don’t understand or respect other people’s boundaries. 
Therefore, they often trample on what other people feel are important limits. 
Brianna’s story typifies some of the various ways that someone with BPD 
may run over other people’s boundaries.
Brianna frantically texts her boyfriend, Noah, “Where R U? Thought U 
were coming at 7. We’ll B L8 to the office party.”
Noah texts her back, “It’s 10 after. On my way. Bad traffic.” Noah’s having 
second thoughts about this relationship. He’s known Brianna for only a 
short while. They met at work, and she came on strong. Although they’ve 
been dating only about two weeks, she now goes crazy when he’s a few 
minutes late. She talks to him way too much while he’s working and gets 
jealous when he talks to other co-workers about work. He pulls into her 
driveway, distracted by his concerns.
Brianna stands in the open doorway. She throws her arms around Noah 
and presses her body close. She says, “Let’s make up before we go to the 
party.”
Feeling off balance, Noah says, “Gosh, I’d love to, but not now. Our boss 
will be mad if we show up much later than we already are.”
They arrive at the party and Brianna hugs the boss and tells him, “Noah 
wouldn’t have sex with me before we came. He was so afraid of making 
you mad. Can you believe that? Do you think I’m cute?”
Both Noah and the boss blush. By the end of the evening, Brianna has 
had too much to drink and has flirted with most of her male co-workers. 
Noah tells her, “I’m not so sure we’re right for each other.”
Although it’s 11:30 p.m., Brianna feels upset and calls her therapist for 
support even though her therapist told her only to call during office 
hours unless it’s an emergency. She tells the therapist, “My boyfriend just 
dumped me, and I feel awful.”
Her therapist asks, “Do you feel like hurting yourself?”
Brianna replies, “Gosh no, I’m just upset and want to talk! Aren’t you 
interested in how I’m feeling? You don’t understand me very well, do 
you? Do you even care about me?
Brianna has breached boundaries in many ways. She flirts and crosses 
boundaries at work impulsively. She reveals overly intimate information to 
her boss. And, of course, she crosses her therapist’s boundaries by calling at 
a late hour and asking for special attention. Like many people with BPD, she 
goes from hot to cold to enraged within minutes. (For more on the explosive 
emotions that many people with BPD experience, check out Chapter 6.)
 
Be aware that most therapists have guidelines for after-hours calls. Usually 
they request that you make such calls only in cases of emergency. Your thera-
pist needs to explain these policies to you, or you need to ask about them, at 
the initial session.

98
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
People with BPD fail to understand and appreciate interpersonal boundaries 
like the ones we describe in the preceding story. The following sections take 
a closer look at the problems people with BPD experience with boundaries in 
various types of relationships.
Disrespecting partners and lovers
People with BPD typically fail to appreciate their partners’ and lovers’ bound-
aries. A man with BPD may demand to know where his partner is at all times 
and subject her to regular inquisitions because he has a deep fear of aban-
donment. Another man may demand that his partner cut herself off from her 
friends because of an intense bout of jealousy.
People with BPD frequently attempt to control the lives of their loved ones 
because of worries about abandonment. Paradoxically, their worries often 
cause the very thing they’re hoping to prevent.
Slighting friends and co-workers
People with BPD always seem to live in the eye of a hurricane, having 
multiple crises going on in their lives at any given time. During these pre-
dicaments, they’re likely to push their friends to the point of disgust and 
practically force them to support their causes. Sometimes they even ask their 
friends to inappropriately intervene on their behalf. They also may breach 
boundaries by revealing confidences to other people. And they have a special 
talent for setting up conflicts among their friends and acquaintances.
In addition, people with BPD make unreasonable demands of their employ-
ers, requesting special treatment, hour changes, additional time off, or pri-
vate meetings. To receive special considerations, they may claim to have 
esoteric illnesses that they really don’t have. They also often spread rumors 
about their co-workers, igniting the atmosphere at work.
Straining relationships with helpers
Doctors or therapists working with people with BPD notice that their clients 
make frequent demands that cross professional boundaries. For example, 
people with BPD are more likely than other clients to do the following:
 
✓ Ask for special appointment times
 
✓ Cancel at the last minute
 
✓ Seem overly friendly and personal

99
 Chapter 8: Perceiving, Understanding, and Relating to Others
 
✓ Behave seductively
 
✓ Call after hours
 
✓ Make ending a session difficult
 
✓ Expect discounts or special financial considerations
 
✓ Expect special help from their providers
 
✓ Ask inappropriately personal questions
 
✓ Demand certain medications they think they need
When professionals have a number of people with BPD in their caseloads, 
they can easily feel overwhelmed by the broad range of demands that their 
clients and patients make. People in the helping professions sometimes strug-
gle to remain caring and empathetic without losing their professional objec-
tivity. See Chapter 25 for information about how professionals can clarify 
their own boundaries and maintain their sanity when working through these 
issues with patients who have BPD.
Riding roughshod over kids
Parents with BPD cross boundaries with their kids in all sorts of ways. 
Sometimes they worry that their children will stop loving them so they try 
to become their kids’ best friends instead of being the guides or leaders that 
parents need to be. They often become overly involved in their kids’ lives 
and interfere with normal development by
 
✓ Doing their kids’ homework
 
✓ Criticizing authority figures when their children run into trouble
 
✓ Stirring up arguments among their kids’ friends and/or parents
 
✓ Asking their kids to reveal almost every detail of their lives
Mental health professionals call such overinvolvement enmeshment, which 
refers to the difficulty some people have in distinguishing between the lives 
of others and themselves. As you can imagine, kids with enmeshed parents 
have a harder time accomplishing the basic tasks of childhood and adoles-
cence, such as forming a clear identity and acquiring the ability to function 
autonomously.
At other times, parents with BPD fail to set proper boundaries with their kids 
by withdrawing, retreating, and becoming underinvolved. Such parents fail to 
set reasonable rules and also neglect to provide love, attention, and support 
to their children. Kids of parents who can’t set reasonable structures often 
fail to learn critical societal rules and end up vulnerable to various emotional 
maladies later in life.

100
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Parents with BPD sometimes continue running over their kids’ boundaries 
even after they’ve grown into adulthood. Sometimes they ask their adult kids 
for advice about their own strained marriages or relationships. They may 
go to their kids for support, both financially and emotionally. They may also 
provide unasked for and unwanted advice to their kids about their relation-
ships, lives, or finances.
Whether people with BPD cross the boundaries set by their lovers, their 
therapists, or their kids, they do so because they don’t understand why 
their loved ones set boundaries in the first place. All in all, people with BPD 
have a hard time respecting boundaries because they can’t take other 
people’s perspectives.

Chapter 9
BPD and Extreme Thinking
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at schemas and where they come from
▶ Understanding the relationship between BPD and schemas
T
he behaviors, feelings, and thoughts of people with borderline person-
ality disorder (BPD) generally show up in extreme forms — in other 
words, not many aspects of the disorder take the middle road. Professionals 
place part of the blame for the turbulent nature of the lives of people with 
BPD on what they call schemas, or powerful beliefs that people hold about 
themselves and the world around them. Basically, schemas influence the way 
people interpret reality and dictate the way they feel.
In this chapter, we elaborate on the nature of schemas and note that people 
experience a variety of them throughout the course of their lives. We explain 
where schemas come from. We tackle the difference between healthy, middle 
ground schemas and unhealthy, disruptive, extreme schemas. Finally, we 
explore the nature of the problematic schemas that people with BPD com-
monly experience.
Understanding How You See the World
Schemas dictate how you think and feel about the world around you, as well 
as how you experience it. Schemas are like pairs of glasses that you use to 
improve your vision. Sometimes these lenses help you see the world more 
clearly, but, at other times, they show you a blurred, cracked, or grotesquely 
distorted vision.
How schemas develop
Schemas start to form during childhood. Your parents and caregivers 
strongly influence the development of these schemas, but peers, teachers, 
and relatives play a large role, too. In conjunction with these personal 

102
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
influences, life events, such as illnesses and tragic accidents, and genetic 
predispositions also help determine the nature of the schemas you develop.
The following examples illustrate how parental figures can cause certain 
schemas to develop in their children.
Daniel’s father routinely criticizes and punishes him severely. When 
Daniel works beside his dad on a project, his father explodes when Daniel 
makes the slightest mistake. He yells, “How can you be so stupid and 
clumsy?”
Daniel grows up believing that he’s inherently inadequate to deal 
with challenges when they arise. He develops a schema of inferiority. 
Accordingly, he responds to school assignments with little effort because 
he doesn’t believe in his ability to succeed. His schema of inferiority con-
tinues to grow as he performs poorly in school.
Anna’s father, on the other hand, routinely praises Anna for good work 
and corrects her without undue harshness. When she asks for help with 
schoolwork, Anna’s father encourages her to find her own answers, 
but he does patiently explain the difficult concepts. He applauds her 
tenacity. One day she brings home a B- on a test — well below her usual 
performance — and he tells her, “You don’t have to be perfect all the 
time. You can learn a lot from Bs. I’m just proud that you worked so 
hard. Now try to see what you can learn from what you did wrong on 
that assignment.”
Because of the way her father treats her, Anna develops a schema of 
competence when life’s challenges confront her. Thus, when she receives 
tough school assignments, she has all the motivation she needs to tackle 
them. Because she tries hard, she succeeds and feels all the more compe-
tent. As a result, her schema of competence continues to grow.
 
When we use the terms parents and parenting, we do so for the sake of sim-
plicity and convenience. We realize that caregivers other than the biological 
parents may play parenting roles in some children’s lives. We don’t mean to 
imply that parents are more important than these other care providers — 
each family is different.
Although schemas begin to develop in childhood, they continue to grow and 
adapt to life happenings through adolescence into adulthood.
Types of schemas
Although numerous different schemas exist, most of them involve questioning 
yourself, others, and the world around you and are characterized accordingly:

103
 Chapter 9: BPD and Extreme Thinking
 
✓ Self-concept schemas: Who am I? Am I capable? What am I worth?
 
✓ Relationship schemas: Can I trust others or should I avoid them? How 
do I deserve to be treated, and how should I treat others?
 
✓ World schemas: Is the world safe or dangerous? Predictable or 
unpredictable?
Most self-concepts and views of the world develop out of appreciation for 
their opposites. For example, you know what beautiful means because you 
know what ugly means. The same premise holds true for other basic con-
cepts, including hot versus cold, short versus tall, sad versus happy, and wet 
versus dry.
This same fundamental idea applies to schemas. You can think of schemas 
in terms of opposite extremes, but you also have to remember that schemas, 
like other basic concepts, have adaptive middle positions, too. After all, 
water can be hot, cold, or lukewarm. A person can be short, tall, or of average 
height. The following examples illustrate this concept in relation to schemas:
 
✓ A woman may hold a belief or schema of incompetence about herself. 
When faced with a difficulty, she likely feels overwhelmed and incapable 
of solving the problem.
 
✓ The opposite schema to incompetence is a schema of omnipotence. A 
woman with the omnipotence schema impulsively takes on almost any 
problem and may fail to seek help, even when it’s necessary, because 
she believes she can do anything.
 
✓ A schema in the middle of these two is competence. A person with the 
competence schema carefully ponders every situation, considers how to 
tackle a problem, and seeks help when necessary.
Why schemas are hard to change
After you develop your schemas, you don’t change them easily because of 
four major reasons:
 
✓ Schemas act as filters. Schemas often prevent people from receiving 
information that contradicts their schemas by focusing their minds 
only on evidence that confirms the schemas. For example, if you have a 
schema of inferiority, you likely ignore or discount all evidence, such as 
a raise at work or a good grade on an exam, that contradicts your belief 
that you’re inferior to the people around you. If you have the schema or 
belief that the world is a dangerous place, the presence of a policeman 
in a dark parking lot probably doesn’t reassure you.

104
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
 
✓ Schemas encourage misinterpretation. Schemas often lead people to 
change the meaning of events to correspond to the beliefs involved in 
the schemas. For example, some people have an anxious attachment 
schema (an intense fear that people they love will leave them). When 
someone with this schema attends a party at which her partner doesn’t 
remain close to her throughout the whole evening, her anxious attach-
ment schema may cause her to see her partner’s actions as evidence 
that he’s looking for someone else.
 
✓ Schemas lead to fear. People are afraid to challenge their schemas 
because they fear the consequences of doing so. For example, if you 
have a schema of inferiority, you may not want to put much effort into 
any task because you’re convinced that challenging your inferiority 
schema in this manner will result in failure. Thus, you don’t want to chal-
lenge your schema by trying to perform well — at anything. Similarly, 
if you have the schema of idealizing (in other words, you see another 
person as absolutely perfect), you may not ask a potential friend or 
lover many questions because you’re afraid of finding out things you 
don’t want to know.
 
✓ Schemas are invisible. People often aren’t aware that schemas exist or 
that these schemas dictate the way they see reality. Not surprisingly, 
you can’t easily change something you don’t know exists.
 
Although schemas don’t easily change overnight, they do sometimes change 
over the course of many years because people are continually having new 
experiences. They can change even more quickly when a person goes to 
therapy. See Chapter 19 for some strategies on how you can help reshape 
schemas.
BPD Schemas: No Middle Ground
Schemas that the BPD mind creates tend to be extreme and maladaptive. In 
addition, people with BPD frequently flip between opposite schema extremes. 
For example, a man with BPD typically sees himself as undeserving of the 
nice things that happen to him. However, when his wife fails to pick up his 
dry cleaning because she has to pick up the kids from school, he flips into an 
entitled rage over her lack of care for him.
On the other hand, a man without BPD may respond to the same situation 
with mild annoyance or even empathetic understanding of his wife’s busy 
schedule. He does so because he has a middle ground schema of deserving, 
rather than the extreme schemas of undeserving and entitled.
Many people with BPD have difficulty finding a middle ground schema — this 
difficulty is called splitting. In other words, people with BPD struggle to see 
shades of gray and, instead, see only black and white extremes. No wonder 

105
 Chapter 9: BPD and Extreme Thinking
the partners of people with BPD often feel a need to be on high alert — the 
flipping between extremes can cause emotional whiplash in those who care 
about people with BPD.
The following sections review some of the most common schemas that plague 
the BPD mind. We divide these schemas into three basic categories — self-
concept schemas, relationship schemas, and world schemas. In each category, 
we compare the opposite extremes to the more adaptive middle ground views 
to give you a better understanding of the intense difference between healthy 
and not-so-healthy schemas. We also take a look at the possible origins of each 
schema.
Self-concept schemas
All people, including us and you, develop schemas about who they are 
throughout their lives. These personal schemas are called self-concept sche-
mas, and they directly influence how you feel, what you do, and what you 
expect in life. You develop self-concept schemas through experience and 
early interactions with caregivers.
Two important self-concept schema dimensions that epitomize the extreme 
views that people with BPD often have are entitled versus undeserving and 
inferiority versus superiority.
Entitled versus undeserving
An entitled schema describes people who feel they have a right to whatever 
they want whenever they want it. They expect other people to meet all their 
needs at the drop of a hat, but, at the same time, they show little to no con-
cern for the needs of others. When they don’t get what they want, they feel 
outrage.
People who have an undeserving schema, on the other hand, don’t believe 
they’re worthy of getting their needs met by others. These people don’t 
expect any attention or consideration from others, and they don’t ask for 
what they want when they want it. As a result, their needs go unmet.
People with BPD often flip between entitled and undeserving. For example, 
a woman may cause a scene at a restaurant when she doesn’t get immediate 
service. She takes the slow service personally instead of chalking it up to a 
busy waitress. She believes that the waitress is insulting her by not meet-
ing her immediate needs. When the waitress profusely apologizes for being 
slow because she’s new on the job, the woman finds herself becoming over-
whelmed with shame. She suddenly feels like she’s undeserving of kindness 
because of her uncontrolled outburst.

Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
The middle or more adaptive self-concept schema is balanced self-worth. 
People with this schema expect to get their needs met, but they don’t expect 
to meet their needs at the expense of others or all the time. They balance 
their own needs with those of others.
Extreme schemas of entitled or undeserving usually develop in childhood 
because of imbalanced parenting that fails to meet children’s needs. In other 
words, parents who either completely spoil or neglect their children provide 
fertile soil for these problematic schemas to grow in.
Inferiority versus superiority
People with inferiority schemas feel like they’re inadequate compared to other 
people. They lack confidence in their abilities and talents. As a result, they 
often give up easily, which usually leads to more feelings of incompetence.
In stark contrast, people with superiority schemas believe that they’re 
brighter and better than others. They may pursue achievement or status 
regardless of the cost, and they may thoughtlessly neglect or abuse others 
because they’re so self-absorbed and lofty that other people just don’t show 
up on their radar screen. People often refer to folks with this schema as being 
narcissistic, or extremely self-centered.
The following story about Bernie, a CEO of a corporation, illustrates how 
someone with a superiority schema may crash and burn because of an un-
expected financial blow, which causes him to flip to an inferiority schema.
Bernie is 62 years old and runs a successful auto supply business. His 
bonus last year was 2.1 million dollars; thus, he enjoys a lavish lifestyle. 
His business has taken a sharp downturn recently, and the board of 
directors votes to replace him with a new CEO. Bernie is astonished. 
He has always seen himself as irreplaceable and totally responsible 
for his company’s success. He assumes that companies will line up in 
droves to hire him, given his brilliance and superior business acumen. 
However, several months pass and Bernie begins to see that the rest of 
the business community doesn’t view him the same way. His superior 
schema disintegrates, and Bernie falls into a major depressive disorder. 
He acquires an inferiority schema and laments that he may never again 
work. His wife worries about their finances because Bernie never both-
ered to invest and save — always assuming bonuses and even a golden 
parachute would await him in the future.
The more adaptive, middle ground schema, called self-acceptance, consists 
of accurate beliefs about oneself. The self-acceptance schema involves rec-
ognizing that people have different sets of skills and talents and that no one 
person is more important than another. People who achieve this schema can 
appreciate both their strengths and their weaknesses.

107
 Chapter 9: BPD and Extreme Thinking
The extreme schemas of inferiority and superiority usually develop as a 
result of parents who put excessive focus on achievements or failures. Such 
parents either criticize harshly or pile inordinate, unearned praise on their 
children. Both of these parenting styles can cause problems as children 
grow up.
Self-concept schemas in action
The following story illustrates how powerful events in childhood can be in 
shaping self-concept schemas. Jordan started to develop an entitled schema 
early in childhood. After his father was sent to prison, however, that schema 
shattered, leaving him with an undeserving schema. The shame he felt from 
his father’s imprisonment also led him to develop an inferiority schema.
The last time Jordan saw his father was 10 years ago when he was barely 
13. Since then, he has received an occasional phone call, usually around 
his birthday, from the penitentiary. But Jordan never picks up the phone 
when he sees the prison’s name on his caller ID.
Jordan’s dad dealt drugs and seemed pretty successful — for awhile. 
Today Jordan recalls how his father spoiled him with the latest technol-
ogy, sports equipment, and clothes when he was young. Jordan didn’t 
think things could get any better. He felt on top of the world and boasted 
shamelessly to his friends about his lavish possessions.
But everything changed when his dad sold drugs to an undercover agent. 
Jordan’s mom did her best and always had food on the table, but the 
party was over. Jordan’s family could no longer afford more than the bare 
necessities. Jordan tried shoplifting, but he stopped after he almost got 
caught one day. His friends deserted him after he no longer had the best 
of everything.
Jordan remains deeply ashamed that his dad sits in prison and, as a 
result, never talks to anyone about his family. Following these events, 
Jordan formed an inferiority schema. Although he once felt entitled to the 
best of everything, Jordan now feels undeserving of anything good that 
happens to him. He takes a series of call center jobs but can’t last at any 
of them for more than two months.
Early in childhood, events encouraged Jordan to develop entitled and superi-
ority schemas. However, the overly positive, inflated nature of these schemas 
set Jordan up for the devastating fall into the undeserving and inferiority 
schemas when his father was arrested. Inflated schemas are easily punctured 
by negative events, and as a result, people with BPD who have these inflated 
schemas are at a high risk for emotional upheavals.

108
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Relationship schemas
People develop various schemas that influence how they relate to one 
another. These schemas either pave the way for or put up serious roadblocks 
to forming good friendships and relationships.
Two major schema dimensions that strongly influence the nature of relation-
ships that people with BPD have are anxious attachment versus avoidant 
attachment and idealizing versus demonizing.
Anxious attachment versus avoidant attachment
People who have an anxious attachment schema worry greatly that other 
people will leave them. They fear abandonment and stay on high alert for any 
sign that someone close to them is thinking of leaving. They’re highly sensi-
tive to imagined rejection, and they’re often intensely clingy and jealous. 
Unfortunately, their overly sensitive, jealousy-driven behaviors frequently 
cause the very abandonment they fear.
On the other hand, people with an avoidant attachment schema stay away 
from other people. They believe that they don’t need other people in their 
lives, often because they assume others will hurt them if they let them in. 
People with an avoidant attachment schema appear aloof and uninterested in 
other people.
Many people flip between these two extremes. For example, a woman with 
BPD may have an anxious attachment schema, which causes her to be overly 
involved in her adult daughter’s life. She calls her daughter several times 
daily, stops at her house unexpectedly, and shares intimate details of her 
life. She does all these things to stay connected and reassure herself that her 
daughter loves her. One day her daughter informs her that she’s setting a 
limit. No longer will she take more than three phone calls from her mother 
each week, and her mother can no longer drop by the house uninvited. 
Her mother responds by flipping into an avoidant schema. She rages at her 
daughter and accuses her of being ungrateful. She avoids calling her daugh-
ter for a month.
The middle ground schema in this dimension is called a secure attachment 
schema, and it leads people to form friendships based on mutual caring and 
respect. People with this schema carefully evaluate new possible relation-
ships without being overly distrusting or naïve, and they don’t sabotage their 
relationships with jealous or clingy behaviors.
As you may expect, parenting practices affect whether or not a child is likely 
to develop problematic relationship schemas. Parents who either abuse 
or seriously neglect their kids may set them up for attachment problems. 
Likewise, parents who become overly enmeshed in their kids’ lives, and who 
try to control and dictate every move, can lead their kids to develop trouble-
some schemas.

109
 Chapter 9: BPD and Extreme Thinking
Idealizing versus demonizing
A classic feature of BPD is the tendency to see people as either all good or 
all bad. This tendency heightens in intimate relationships. People with BPD 
often see new partners as perfect individuals, having no blemishes of any 
kind. This tendency is called an idealizing schema. People with this schema 
inflate the images of their partners to such high standards that their partners 
can’t help but disappoint them.
The demonizing schema, on the other hand, causes people to view others as 
malicious and out to get them. They interpret other people’s behaviors as 
hostile and malevolent. Thus, trust is very difficult for them to achieve.
Often people flip between the two extremes. For example, when the partner or 
friend of someone with the idealizing schema fails to live up to the impossible, 
idealized standards, the demonizing schema takes hold and drops the partner 
to demon status. When someone develops the demonizing schema, any flaw 
or foible in another person simply proves that person’s demon status.
The middle ground schema in this dimension is called a realistic view schema. 
When a person develops this schema, she sees other people as neither all 
good nor all bad. She expects others to have positive attributes but also 
accepts their negative qualities. Obviously, this schema allows for relation-
ships to endure life’s ups and downs more easily than the idealizing or 
demonizing schemas.
Parents who tell their kids that the world is out to get them and that they 
should never trust anyone provide fertile ground for the development of a 
demonizing schema. Similarly, parents who model naiveté and a Pollyanna-
style view of others inculcate an idealizing schema. Furthermore, people with 
BPD tend to see the world in extremes, which means they likely split people 
into demons and angels.
Relationship schemas in action
The following story about Tara shows you how relationship schemas that 
are extremely imbalanced interfere with life and relationships. Tara’s rocky 
relationship with her aunt is the result of flipping back and forth between an 
anxious attachment schema and an avoidant attachment schema. Tara also 
flips between idealizing and demonizing schemas, which causes additional 
problems in her relationship with her aunt.
Tara talks to her psychotherapist about a recent argument she had with 
her aunt. “It all started when my aunt insulted me. I know I’m not perfect, 
but family is family. We should stick up for each other.”
Dr. Feingold asks, “What did she say that insulted you?”
“She basically called me a whore. That’s what she did. I hate her. I prob-
ably won’t ever speak to her again,” Tara responds, her face beginning to 
redden.

110
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
“My goodness, you must be upset,” Dr. Feingold consoles, “You’re so 
close to your aunt. Help me understand. What happened?”
“My aunt asked whether or not I was bringing anyone to my cousin’s wed-
ding next month. I told her that I wasn’t dating anyone right now. She said 
that was unusual for me.”
“And . . .” Dr. Feingold waits for Tara to finish.
“Well, what she obviously meant was that I sleep around.”
“I’m not sure that I follow you, Tara. Help me understand how her saying 
that it was unusual for you not to have a date meant that you sleep 
around,” Dr. Feingold responds.
Tara begins to cry. She says, “My aunt was always there for me. She was 
the mom I never had. When my mom got drunk, my aunt showered me 
with love and affection. She could do no wrong. Now all she does is talk 
about my cousin’s wedding. My cousin is perfect. She’s only had a couple 
of boyfriends, and you know I’ve had so many. My cousin does every-
thing right, and I do everything wrong. I hate her, and I hate my aunt.”
“Tara, I think I understand what’s happening here. Remember when we 
talked about how sometimes you go from being very insecure and anx-
ious in a relationship to being avoidant and wanting to run away? Your 
reactions are understandable because you couldn’t trust your mother. 
When she was sober, she cared for you, but, unfortunately, she got abu-
sive when she was drunk. No wonder you bounce around from being inse-
cure to angry. Your mind activates these feelings because you’re worried 
that your aunt may not always be there for you,” Dr. Feingold explains.
Tara’s upbringing set her up to acquire extreme relationship schemas. At 
times, she idealizes her aunt and sees her as someone she can count on — 
someone who can do no wrong. But when her aunt pays attention to Tara’s 
cousin, Tara feels slighted and jealous. She wants to push her aunt away, 
which indicates a flip to an avoidant attachment schema. Tara also demon-
izes her aunt without good justification when she does something that Tara 
believes is wrong. As you can see, Tara’s schemas go from one extreme to 
the other, and they wreak havoc on her relationships.
World schemas
Not only do people form schemas about themselves and others, but they also 
form them about the world they live in. These schemas strongly influence 
the way people live and provide a sense of either security or paranoia and 
fear. Two schema dimensions that often influence how people with BPD feel 
as they traverse the roads in life are dangerous versus totally safe and unpre-
dictable versus totally predictable.

111
 Chapter 9: BPD and Extreme Thinking
Dangerous versus totally safe
People who see the world through a dangerous schema rarely feel safe. 
They’re hypervigilant and take inordinate precautions whenever they ven-
ture outside the relative safety of their homes. They see the world as a jungle 
and worry constantly about when the next lion will spring from the under-
brush. Sometimes their fears grow to such proportions that they rarely leave 
their houses.
On the other hand, people who see the world through a totally safe schema 
unwittingly take unnecessary risks. Oblivious to the need for being reason-
ably cautious, they venture forth in life and, not surprisingly, frequently 
suffer serious consequences for their clueless naiveté.
The middle ground schema in this dimension is called reasonably safe. People 
with a reasonably safe schema manage to reign in extreme paranoia and hold 
onto appropriate cautions at the same time.
Both the practices a parent uses and the characteristics of a child’s neigh-
borhood and school strongly influence the development of these schemas. 
Abusive parents raise children who may exhibit dangerous schemas because 
they’re used to feeling perpetual fear. On the other hand, parents who overly 
protect their kids are likely to have children who go into the world with an 
exaggerated sense of safety because they never let their kids feel fear.
Unpredictable versus totally predictable
People with an unpredictable schema see the world as chaotic. They don’t 
attempt to develop a life plan because they don’t think plans ever work out. 
They see themselves as victims to their life happenings. They feel over-
whelmed and helpless and, as you may imagine, pessimism rules over opti-
mism in their lives.
In stark contrast, people with a totally predictable schema view themselves 
as the complete masters of their lives. They can’t see the possibility of fail-
ure because they believe the world will bend to their wills. People with this 
schema decide on only one plan for their careers, investments, and relation-
ships and don’t bother with a Plan B. Unfortunately, when things don’t go 
according to their masterful plan, they tend to fall apart.
The middle ground schema in this dimension is called a predictable schema — 
please note the lack of the word totally here. People with the predictable 
schema realize that the world and the outcomes of their efforts have some 
predictability but that no one can control all possible eventualities. These 
people are well prepared for life’s curve balls and like to have a Plan A, B, 
and C. They figure that Plan A will usually work, but they’re not devastated 
when it doesn’t.

112
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
Both parenting styles and life events shape the world schemas in this dimen-
sion. Kids who grow up in families ruled by chaos tend to develop unpredict-
able schemas. Keep in mind that some childhoods simply have more than 
their share of unpredictable, uncontrollable events, such as deaths, divorces, 
job losses, and so on. At the other end of the spectrum, some parents plan 
every last detail of their children’s lives. They schedule every minute of every 
day, and they dictate precisely what their kids do and with whom they do it. 
These kids who never have to face an unplanned situation typically end up 
with totally predictable schemas.
World schemas in action
People’s world schemas can pop up anytime and anywhere. The following 
story about Lily, who doesn’t have BPD, and Kaitlyn, who does have BPD, 
shows how schemas affect everyday occurrences at work. People with BPD 
tend to have more extreme schemas and, therefore, react to events with 
greater emotionality and intensity than people who don’t have the disorder.
Lily and Kaitlyn are nurses who work the night shift in a big city hospital. 
Both nurses enjoy the relative quiet and slower pace that the night shift 
offers. They work on the fourth floor in labor and delivery.
At 3 a.m. on a slow night, an announcement pierces the quiet atmosphere 
of the floor, “Paging Dr. Firestone, 5 East.” Lily, who is entering notes on 
a computer, pauses. Kaitlyn, chatting with an expectant father, stops 
midsentence. The two nurses know that in their hospital, “Paging Dr. 
Firestone, 5 East” means a fire has broken out in the east wing of the fifth 
floor. Such incidents are usually trivial and quickly snuffed out.
Lily has reasonably safe and predictable schemas. She resumes her 
duties but also keeps an ear out for any further announcements. She’s 
not overly alarmed.
In contrast, Kaitlyn has BPD, along with dangerous and unpredictable 
schemas, and immediately feels panic. Unpredictable, traumatic events 
have marked her life. She gasps and blurts out, “Oh my God, there’s a 
fire in the hospital!” The expectant father she’s been talking to turns 
white and runs to his wife’s room to warn her. The word rapidly spreads 
throughout the floor and patients pour into the hallways.
Lily quickly calls the fifth floor to confirm that nothing serious is going 
on. The floor secretary says that a patient lit up in the bathroom and set 
off a smoke alarm. Lily announces, “Calm down everyone. There is no 
fire. Repeat, there is no fire. It was a false alarm.”
As you can see, Kaitlyn responded to the announcement without waiting 
to gather more information. Her schemas led her to assume the worst and, 
more importantly, put her patients at risk. She was lucky that Lily was there 
to calm everyone down. Otherwise, Kaitlyn may have lost her job.

Slipping Away from Reality
In This Chapter
▶ Sorting out dissociation
▶ Pinpointing paranoia
▶ Dealing with hearing voices
▶ Feeling crazy because of BPD
T
he word borderline suggests the edge or boundary between two proper-
ties, conditions, or emotions. Originally, mental health professionals 
thought that borderline personality disorder (BPD) sat on the edge between 
sane and insane, more technically between neurotic and psychotic (see 
Chapter 3 for a discussion of this issue). Although professionals no longer 
believe that BPD lies on a clear border between sanity and insanity, many 
people who have BPD do report feeling crazy or insane.
Psychosis — the technical term that comes the closest to what people mean 
when they say crazy or insane — refers to a loss of contact with reality. 
Although people with BPD can experience episodes of psychosis, they do so 
only briefly and less profoundly than people with psychotic disorders such 
as schizophrenia. See Schizophrenia For Dummies by Jerome and Irene Levine 
(Wiley) for more information.
In this chapter, we explore the symptoms of leaving reality behind. We begin 
by discussing the mildest form of losing contact with reality, which is known 
as dissociation. Then we paint a picture of paranoia and describe hallucina-
tions. Finally, we tell you how these symptoms manifest themselves in BPD 
and what you can do to deal with them when they occur.
Discovering Dissociation
Dissociation involves the breaking of connections or associations between 
aspects of the self that usually go together. These generally connected or 
integrated facets of the self can include your body, memories, emotions, 

114
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
identity, thoughts, and even the connection of yourself to reality. For exam-
ple, a woman can have a vivid memory of having been raped yet experience 
no emotions whatsoever in connection with that memory.
Professionals don’t consider dissociation to be psychotic even though it can 
involve some degree of departure from reality. Dissociative experiences are 
rather common in people with BPD. Many experts believe that dissociation in 
a person represents a way of coping with some severe trauma and/or stress, 
which would otherwise emotionally overwhelm the person. Dissociation can 
occur in the following forms:
 
✓ Dissociative fugue: In this state, people may fail to recall major por-
tions of their pasts. They may disconnect from their usual identities and 
travel away from their homes while adopting new senses of self. People 
in a fugue state often appear normal to others who don’t realize that the 
person in the dissociative fugue has disconnected from the past.
 
✓ Dissociative identity disorder: Professionals once called this problem 
multiple personality disorder. This condition occurs when someone 
adopts two or more completely different personalities or personas. 
In fact, people with dissociative identity disorder commonly take on 
as many as fifteen separate personalities over time. Each personality 
may represent a strategy for coping with a different type of stressor or 
problem. The changes from personality to personality can include voice 
pitch, vocabulary, dialect, and posture. A large percentage of people 
with this disorder literally change their handedness (in other words, 
they go from being left-handed to being right-handed) as they move from 
one personality to another. In addition, each personality likely doesn’t 
have access to memories that occurred when the person was experienc-
ing a different personality.
 
✓ Dissociative amnesia: This condition involves a loss of big chunks of 
memory that are too extensive to be the result of normal forgetfulness. 
Usually these memories are traumatic in nature. Some people who 
experience dissociative amnesia attempt to prevent others from know-
ing about the memory loss. Sometimes they experience a large number 
of small losses of memory instead of one big loss, but even these small 
losses are beyond normal forgetfulness.
 
✓ Depersonalization disorder: This disorder involves periods of time 
in which people feel detached from themselves and their experiences. 
Sometimes people in this state feel like they’re detached from their 
bodies — almost as though they’re viewing themselves through a movie 
camera. As a result, some people say the experience feels like living in a 
dream or a movie.
Dissociative states are likely the mind’s adaptive responses to intolerable sit-
uations. They represent the mind’s desperate escape strategy. For example, 
a large percentage of people with BPD report having been seriously abused 

115
 Chapter 10: Slipping Away from Reality
or traumatized at some point in their lives. Becoming dissociated from their 
bodies may be their minds’ way of dealing with the stress of that abuse. Most 
people with or without BPD experience at least brief dissociative experiences 
during or following highly traumatic events.
The following story about Nicole demonstrates how the process of dissocia-
tion works.
Nicole hears the door slam; she listens as the footsteps start up the 
stairs. She feels sick to her stomach and pulls the blanket up to her chin. 
“Maybe he’s too drunk tonight,” she prays.
“Nicole, baby, I’m home, baby,” her stepfather whispers as he opens the 
door to her bedroom.
She feels cold hands pulling away the blanket, touching her. She knows 
what will happen next — it’s been happening most nights for the last 
two years since she was 12 years old. Nicole stays quiet and still and 
squeezes her eyes shut. She imagines that her body isn’t her own, that 
she’s not real. She wills her mind to go somewhere else. She’s a butterfly. 
She flies away.
Nicole was repeatedly sexually abused by her stepfather. Her mind simply 
couldn’t cope with the horror she experienced. As a result, she learned to go 
into dissociative states — in the form of depersonalization — in which she 
psychologically left her body during the assaults. Later in life, she will likely 
find herself going into dissociative states whenever she’s reminded of the 
abuse or, perhaps, even during any time of conflict or stress.
Feeling Paranoid or Delusional
Paranoia involves heightened mistrust and fear. People who suffer from para-
noia become preoccupied with imagined plots that others may be hatching 
against them. They may dwell on unsupported ideas of betrayal by friends, 
spouses, or acquaintances. They often read unwarranted, threatening mean-
ings into other people’s innocent remarks. Such paranoid mistrust and fear 
commonly accompany BPD.
Paranoia can range from merely heightened distrust to full-blown delusions 
of a psychotic nature, meaning they have little or no grounding in reality. 
However, people with BPD don’t generally experience extremely intense psy-
chotic delusions. When people with BPD do experience paranoia, their delu-
sions tend to be brief and don’t depart severely from reality.

116
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
The following story about Alex, who has BPD, illustrates a type of paranoia 
that often accompanies BPD.
Alex looks out the window, hoping to see Madeline entering the apart-
ment building. He paces back and forth, his tension rising. He calls her 
cell for about the 100th time — it goes right to voice mail again. He 
doesn’t leave a message. He says out loud, “Where is she? Who is she 
with?”
Finally, the buzzer sounds, and a couple of minutes later Madeline opens 
the door. Alex begins, “Where were you? Why didn’t you answer your 
cell?”
“I was at work. I had my cell phone turned off,” Madeline replies.
“You left work early. I called your office. Don’t lie to me. I know you’re 
cheating on me. Tell me the truth,” Alex’s voice is getting louder.
“Geez, Alex, I left early so that I could stop and get my driver’s license 
renewed. I told you last week that it had expired.”
“Let me see your new license,” Alex demands.
“No, that’s ridiculous. I’m not showing you my license. If you don’t 
believe me, that’s your problem,” Madeline starts to walk past him.
Extreme paranoia: Paranoid schizophrenia
The following story about Joshua demonstrates 
paranoia that leaves reality far behind.
 
 Joshua works for a government account-
ing office. He unlocks his file cabinet and 
reaches for a folder labeled “notes.” He 
glances around to make sure that no co-
workers are close by. He opens the folder 
at his desk and looks at the listed names 
and comments. Sixteen people are on the 
list. Joshua looks around once more before 
he adds another name. Then he writes, 
“Suspicious behavior in the cafeteria. 
Subject paying for meal with a large bill. 
May be collecting money from international 
terrorists.”
 
 Joshua keeps track of his co-workers 
because he believes that the CIA will soon 
contact him again for information about 
spies in his office. He thinks that the CIA 
communicates to him by sending thought 
waves to his brain while he sleeps. When 
he wakes up, he’s able to recall his latest 
assignment.
 
 Although Joshua has worked at this job 
for many years, he’s a loner and doesn’t 
socialize. People know to leave him alone. 
He manages to get his work done despite 
his paranoid thinking. Joshua was hospi-
talized during his late adolescence after 
he refused to shower for days and started 
speaking incoherently. However, today he 
manages to function and earn a living.
Joshua suffers from a condition known as para-
noid schizophrenia. He doesn’t show signs of 
BPD, and his type of delusions would rarely — 
if ever — occur in conjunction with BPD.

117
 Chapter 10: Slipping Away from Reality
Alex grabs her by the arm and pushes her against the wall. “Don’t ever 
walk away from me. I want the truth. Who are you seeing?”
“Don’t touch me. You’re way out of control. Let me go!” Madeline 
screams.
Alex illustrates over-the-top distrust of his girlfriend. However, his somewhat 
paranoid feelings don’t rise to the level of psychotic delusions. The differ-
ence between a psychotic delusion and Alex’s paranoid distrust is that even 
though Alex jumps to a conclusion with no real evidence, his girlfriend may 
be cheating on him — the idea isn’t completely unreasonable or unrealistic. 
Thus, nothing about his jealous thoughts completely departs from reality.
Having Hallucinations
Hallucinations involve perceptions that occur without input from the environ-
ment. Thus, people who experience hallucinations hear sounds that aren’t 
there. They see people who aren’t present. Smells, temperatures, and tastes 
emanate from nowhere. Yet, the perceptions have all the qualities of true, 
real-life events. Furthermore, they occur while people are fully awake and 
conscious, not while they’re in a dream state.
Mild hallucinations are extremely common in many people’s lives. You may 
hear phones ringing when taking a shower or drying your hair, but when you 
check the caller ID, it shows nothing. Many people with no emotional disor-
der of any kind report that they sometimes hear faint voices or smell scents 
with no apparent source. These brief, mild experiences have little meaning, 
although they may occur more frequently when someone is under stress.
A step up in severity from hearing a brief telephone ring that didn’t happen 
is the experience of hearing very real, distinct sounds and seeing sights that 
come from nowhere. Thus, someone may report hearing voices that sound 
sharp, clear, and present even though no one is in the room. However, 
experts don’t consider experiences like this one to be full-blown psychosis as 
long as people at least maintain awareness that the voices are coming from 
their own heads.
On the other hand, sometimes people report vivid perceptions of voices, 
sights, sounds, and smells that no one else can perceive, yet they believe 
their perceptions are really occurring. They may hear voices telling them to 
do something and believe that some alien radio source is beaming the voices 
into their heads. Or, they may see someone standing right in front of them 
even though no one is there. This type of hallucination is quite rare in people 
with BPD, and if such hallucinations do occur, they do so only briefly. If such 
hallucinations occur more often and more severely, the person may have a 
different type of mental disorder — schizophrenia perhaps.

118
Part II: Taking Note of the Major BPD Symptoms 
The following story about Eric depicts someone who has BPD and falls apart 
under stress. Auditory hallucinations like Eric’s are the most common type of 
hallucination that people with BPD experience.
Eric was physically and emotionally abused as a child by his mother 
and many of the boyfriends she brought into their home. During his teen 
years, he was in and out of drug treatment facilities and juvenile deten-
tion centers. After graduating from high school, he joins the service as a 
way of getting away from his past and starting over.
Basic training begins. He hates taking orders, and he can barely keep up 
with the rigorous physical demands. Eric slowly begins to disintegrate. 
He hears voices telling him that he’s stupid and that he’ll never amount 
to anything. These voices seem almost real, but Eric knows they can’t be.
Hallucinations and schizophrenia
The following story about Mia illustrates some-
one who has a more serious loss of contact with 
reality than what normally occurs with BPD.
 
 The voices tell Mia to hurt herself. The 
chanting gets louder, “Evil devil, you must 
pay. You must suffer. Mia, Mia, Mia.” Mia 
takes a puff on the cigarette once and then 
pushes the burning ash into her leg. The 
searing pain stops the voices. A moment 
of relief, but the voices return. “Devil, Mia, 
Mia, you must die. You must kill the devil 
Mia, Mia, Mia.” She takes another drag 
and then burns her flesh again. It’s not 
enough; she needs to do more to satisfy the 
voices. She starts to rock back and forth. 
The intense pain she feels from burning her 
flesh doesn’t distract her from the pain of 
living.
 
 She can’t stand another day of these voices. 
She goes to the medicine cabinet and finds 
her medication. Maybe these drugs will 
stop the voices. She takes a handful of pills 
and hopes for oblivion. An hour later, her 
husband walks in to discover her lying on 
the bathroom floor, unconscious. He calls 
the paramedics, who take her to the ER.
 
 The attending physician first diagnoses her 
with BPD because of the self-mutilation 
and suicide attempt. However, her husband 
mentions that she’s been hearing voices 
and having various hallucinations for years. 
The attending physician makes a wise deci-
sion to call for a psychiatric consultation. 
The psychiatrist accurately diagnoses her 
with schizophrenia and has her hospitalized 
to find an appropriate medication to control 
her psychosis.
Mia’s story illustrates that diagnosing disorders 
like BPD is a complicated and tricky process, 
even for physicians. If you suspect you have 
an emotional problem of any sort, seek the ser-
vices of a licensed mental health practitioner, 
and don’t attempt to diagnose the problem 
yourself.

119
 Chapter 10: Slipping Away from Reality
Eric’s drill sergeant sees that Eric is losing it. He orders Eric to report 
to the base’s mental health center for a checkup. The psychologist at 
the center interviews Eric and gives him some psychological tests. After 
reviewing all the information, the psychologist diagnoses Eric with BPD. 
He doesn’t think Eric’s hallucinations are full-blown psychotic episodes. 
Nonetheless, he recommends that Eric receive an honorable discharge 
because of his mental condition and inability to handle great stress and 
pressure.
Eric’s story shows the kind of brief auditory hallucinations that people with 
BPD sometimes experience. He hears voices, but he knows they must be 
coming from his head.
When You Have BPD and Feel Crazy
People with BPD often say they feel crazy because they struggle to control 
their impulses and emotions. They frequently find themselves acting in rep-
rehensible ways. They also commonly report feeling out of it and dissociative 
(see the “Discovering Dissociation” section earlier in this chapter for more 
information). However, these issues aren’t what professionals label as psy-
chotically out of touch with reality. You can start to address common BPD 
symptoms by reading Part IV of this book, which covers everything from 
dealing with your impulsivity to changing your state of mind.
On rare occasions, people with BPD do experience what professionals call 
brief psychotic episodes, in which they experience hallucinations or delu-
sions for awhile. When such experiences do occur, professionals can usually 
easily treat them with a brief regimen of antipsychotic medication. Generally, 
the people who suffer from these brief psychotic episodes can withdraw the 
antipsychotic medication after the episodes abate. See Chapter 20 for more 
information about the medications professionals use to treat BPD and associ-
ated symptoms.

In this part . . .
I
f you have borderline personality disorder (BPD), you 
may not have already made the decision to seek treat-
ment and make changes in your life. In this part, we 
describe the various settings in which you may find BPD 
treatment available. We introduce you to the mental 
health professionals who provide treatment for BPD and 
explain what to look for in your individual therapist. We 
also go through some of the treatments that professionals 
have found to be helpful in treating BPD — because you 
need to know what does and what doesn’t work. Finally, 
we help you decide whether treatment is what you really 
want and then prepare you for fully engaging in that treat-
ment if you decide to seek it out.

B
orderline personality disorder (BPD) consists of a broad constellation 
of symptoms (see Chapter 3 for more info). The range of problems 
people with BPD experience makes treatment challenging. For example, some 
people with BPD have trouble with substance abuse, difficulty keeping a job, 
tumultuous relationships, or serious problems with mood. Others feel empty 
inside, worry about being abandoned, or try to physically hurt themselves. 
Addressing even one of those problems can be extremely difficult, so imagine 
how hard treating a combination of them can be. Although treatment for BPD 
takes awhile and can seem overwhelming at first, over time, it usually helps 
significantly.
Not surprisingly, the wide range of available treatments makes choosing 
the right treatment challenging for people who have BPD or those people 
who care for them. If you have BPD, you can choose from an hour a week of 
individual psychotherapy, day treatment (known as partial hospitalization), 
full-time inpatient treatment, or group therapy. In this chapter, we help you 
handle this array of options.
This chapter describes the various treatment options available for people 
with BPD and explains which ones have been shown to work. We provide 
a glossary of treatment providers. We spell out what to expect in psycho-
therapy and, more importantly, show you how to tell whether you’ve made 
the right choice. Finally, we discuss how to make realistic goals instead of 
expecting unlikely miracles.

124
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Exploring BPD Treatment Settings
You can find treatment for BPD in a variety of settings. Each of these 
settings — whether it’s working one-on-one with a therapist, taking part in 
group therapy, or spending some time in a hospital — has certain pluses 
and minuses. In the following sections, we describe what to expect from 
each of these treatment venues.
Working individually with a therapist
Most mental health practitioners practice independently and offer services 
to individuals, one at a time. Typically, they see each client for fifty minutes 
either once or twice per week. For people with BPD, especially during times 
of great upheaval, individual therapy once or twice per week may not suffice. 
However, many people with BPD do get better with the help of individual psy-
chotherapy. See the “Choosing a Mental Health Professional” section later in 
this chapter for a list of questions you need to ask your individual therapist 
before starting therapy.
Giving groups a chance
Group psychotherapy has been around for a long time, but many people shy 
away from this form of therapy out of fear of confiding personal information 
to others, especially people they don’t know. Sometimes they fear talking in 
front of a group or believe that other group members will reject them.
However, group therapy can be a very useful part of BPD treatment. Group 
settings provide an effective way to teach important skills and to provide 
information about managing BPD. Group therapy is also somewhat more cost 
effective than individual therapy because the costs are spread among the 
participants. Furthermore, seeing that you’re not the only person who’s suf-
fering the way you are can be very reassuring.
 
If you find the idea of group therapy too intimidating, you may wish to start 
your treatment with individual therapy. However, we strongly suggest that 
you talk to your therapist about your concerns regarding group therapy so 
that the two of you can address these fears. Furthermore, your therapist can 
tell you whether or not groups specifically designed for BPD are available in 
your local area.

125
 Chapter 11: Preparing to Conquer BPD
Spending more time in treatment: 
Partial hospitalization
Some local hospitals offer programs for BPD treatment in a form called partial 
hospitalization. Partial hospitalization programs usually combine group ther-
apy, individual therapy, medication, and adjunctive therapies, such as art ther-
apy, recreational therapy, and occupational therapy. Although researchers 
haven’t yet studied these adjunctive therapies in relationship to the treatment 
of BPD, time spent on these activities can have some value for many people, 
regardless of their disorder. For example, when a conflict arises in a recre-
ational therapy session, a good therapist can use that opportunity to show the 
patient how to use some basic interpersonal conflict-management skills.
These partial hospitalization programs vary greatly in number of hours per 
week and may range from a couple of hours two or three days per week to 
as much as all day most days of the week. To date, no studies have demon-
strated exactly how many hours per week are optimal.
 
Partial hospitalization programs can be difficult to find and rather costly. 
Insurance often doesn’t cover such services. The good news is that most 
people with BPD don’t require partial hospitalization programs, and when 
they do, they probably don’t need them for long periods of time.
Needing more care: Inpatient 
psychiatric wards
A generation ago, seeing people spend long periods of time confined in so-
called mental hospitals for problems, such as BPD and psychotic disorders, 
was a fairly common occurrence (see Chapters 3 and 10 for more information 
about psychotic disorders).
Today, however, inpatient psychiatric wards don’t serve as mainstays in the 
treatment of BPD. Mental health professionals use these more intense treat-
ment settings only when people appear to be in imminent danger of causing 
harm to themselves or other people. When professionals turn to inpatient 
wards, they usually use them only for a short time (anywhere from a few 
days to a week or so), mostly for the purpose of stabilizing the person and 
perhaps regulating the medication regimen.
 
Some experts in the treatment of BPD warn against using inpatient treatment 
more than one time for any given patient. They do so because some patients 
find inpatient settings quite rewarding, supporting, and nurturing compared 
to the scary world outside the hospital walls. Therefore, these patients may 
end up seeking hospitalization with increased frequency over time. Many 
experts think that this pattern of frequent hospitalization ends up causing 
more harm than good.

126
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Combining and changing treatments
About half the people who seek treatment for BPD receive treatment in more 
than one format or setting, either at the same time or one after the other. 
Thus, you may begin with individual therapy and later add group therapy. 
You may even seek partial hospitalization for a few weeks in addition to 
your individual and group therapies. You may also go to an inpatient setting, 
but you probably won’t remain in that setting for long or more than once or 
twice.
You and your primary individual therapist can work together to decide which 
treatments are best for you at any given time. See the “Choosing a Mental 
Health Professional” section for help with finding the right therapist for you.
Researching the Treatment Strategies 
That Work for BPD
If you take a few minutes to call around to different therapists or hospitals or 
search the Internet, you’ll find a kaleidoscope of different types of psycho-
therapy. You’ll find Jungian therapy, primal scream therapy, psychoanalysis 
(in various forms), cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, humanis-
tic therapy, Rogerian therapy, haiku therapy, hakomi therapy, and on and on. 
Are you confused, yet?
Well, don’t be overwhelmed. We’re going to make your decision of which 
therapy to choose a little easier. In actuality, only a handful of psychothera-
pies have shown significant promise for the treatment of BPD.
 
You definitely don’t want to seek treatment for BPD that isn’t specifically 
designed to treat this diagnosis. Preliminary evidence suggests that non-
specific treatment may slow or impede the natural healing that occurs 
over time.
Research supports the following strategies for treating BPD:
 
✓ Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): Marsha Linehan developed DBT as 
the first therapy specifically designed for BPD. Numerous studies have 
shown that this approach effectively reduces suicidal attempts. Most 
of these studies have looked at the effects of one year of this kind of 
therapy. After one year, people show great improvement, but they still 
generally report significant distress in the quality of their lives. Linehan 
believes that more substantial improvement is likely after several years 
of treatment, but, to date, researchers haven’t conducted studies look-
ing at this extended time frame.

127
 Chapter 11: Preparing to Conquer BPD
 
 DBT typically combines individual psychotherapy and group therapy. 
Group therapy teaches patients how to identify their emotions and then 
how to apply an array of techniques to help quell out-of-control emo-
tions. The individual therapy works on decreasing self-harming behav-
iors and removing obstacles to getting better. The DBT approach heavily 
draws on Buddhist principles, such as acceptance of distress and medi-
tation. DBT also uses elements of cognitive and behavioral therapies, 
which are designed to improve the way people think and behave.
 
 
DBT is truly a breakthrough approach to BPD and the first therapy to 
generate research to support its effectiveness. However, DBT is a com-
plicated package of strategies, and mental health professionals don’t 
know for sure which techniques are most critical to success. Many of 
the specific techniques we discuss in Chapters 15 through 20 can be 
found in DBT.
 
✓ Mentalization-based therapy (MBT): Anthony Bateman and Peter 
Fonagy pioneered the development of MBT for the treatment of BPD. 
This treatment is based on the belief that most people with BPD have 
problems with how they attached to or related with their primary 
caregivers. As adults, people with BPD continue to have trouble with 
relationships. MBT attempts to improve the abilities of people with 
BPD to understand their feelings as well as the feelings and thoughts of 
other people. MBT also teaches people with BPD how to understand the 
impact of their behaviors on other people.
 
 Initial studies of MBT have demonstrated encouraging results in people 
with BPD even eight years after the treatment. Patients had fewer hos-
pitalizations after treatment, reduced their suicidal behaviors, and 
improved their day-to-day functioning. A number of the techniques in 
Chapter 18 are consistent with the ideas of MBT.
 
✓ Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP): TFP is an approach to treat-
ing BPD based on the theory that many people with BPD perceive inter-
personal interactions in overly rigid, fragmented ways. This treatment 
attempts to teach people with BPD that they misperceive interactions 
with their therapists and provides corrective information about those 
interactions. Early research on TFP is positive, but we can’t unequivocally 
recommend this approach until more studies are conducted.
 
✓ Cognitive therapy: Aaron T. Beck developed cognitive therapy as a 
therapy for depression, but it has been successfully applied to a surpris-
ingly wide range of emotional problems, including anxiety disorders, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, eating disorders, and 
schizophrenia. Hundreds of studies support its effectiveness for these 
problems, but much less research has investigated the effectiveness 
of cognitive therapy on treating BPD. The studies that have been done 
have found that cognitive therapy shows promise in reducing self-harm 
and other symptoms of BPD.

128
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
 
 Some of the techniques in DBT are based on cognitive therapy. However, 
studies of cognitive therapy have shown benefits in less than six months, 
which is a shorter time frame than that of most of the other approaches 
to treating BPD, including DBT, that we review in this chapter.
 
 Cognitive therapy teaches people to look at the way they think about or 
interpret the things that happen to them. Generally, people think in dis-
torted ways when they’re experiencing emotional problems. Cognitive 
therapy helps people see those distortions and, thus, their experiences 
more realistically.
 
✓ Schema therapy: Jeffrey Young originally developed schema therapy as 
an offshoot of cognitive therapy. This approach focuses on early mal-
adaptive schemas, which are broad, deeply held beliefs about oneself 
and the world that originate in childhood (see Chapter 9 for more infor-
mation about schemas and Chapter 19 for ideas about how to change 
maladaptive schemas into more adaptive ones).
 
 Although schema therapy has generated a lot of professional interest, 
research on its effectiveness is just now emerging. One study in the 
Netherlands found that two schema therapy sessions per week over 
three years led to substantial improvement in the quality of life and 
decreased symptoms in about half the sample patients. Improvements in 
reported quality of life haven’t been typical in most outcome studies for 
other forms of BPD treatment. Thus, these particular results are highly 
encouraging, but they beg for replication by other research groups.
 
✓ Medication: Mental health professionals use psychotropic medications 
to treat most emotional disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar 
disorder, and psychosis. However, medications haven’t proven to be 
especially effective for the treatment of BPD and other personality dis-
orders. Nonetheless, medication sometimes appears useful for treating 
specific symptoms of BPD. See Chapter 20 for more information about 
using medication as a part of BPD treatment.
 
After studying these therapies, we haven’t discovered anything that stands 
out as fundamentally contradictory or incompatible about any one therapy 
with the major tenets of the others. As of today, no one has studied the effec-
tiveness of combining these strategies, but some experts advocate doing so.
In Chapters 15 through 20, we present an array of techniques that we pull 
from all the therapies we list here so that you can get a good sense of what 
you’re likely to encounter when you begin treatment for your BPD. Your 
therapist may primarily use one of these techniques or present you with a 
treatment that attempts to integrate the best features of each, much like we 
do in this book. Either approach is likely to be effective.

129
 Chapter 11: Preparing to Conquer BPD
Choosing a Mental Health Professional
If you have BPD, you need help from others — usually trained mental health 
professionals. Some treatments involve a team of professionals working 
together, and others involve only one therapist working one-on-one with 
you. When you’re searching for a mental health professional, you need to 
ask specifically about her experience and knowledge in treating BPD. You 
want someone who has experience, especially in providing one or more of 
the treatments we review in the “Researching the Treatment Strategies That 
Work for BPD” section. Don’t get discouraged if the first provider you contact 
isn’t comfortable treating BPD. Not everyone is, but, if you call around, you’ll 
likely find someone who is.
When you contact a mental health professional, you need to ask that profes-
sional a variety of questions, including the following:
 
✓ When and how often are you available? Ask the provider how soon 
you can make an appointment. Unfortunately, in some areas of the coun-
try, providers are so busy that they have waiting lists. Others may have 
a limited number of appointment times available. Ask about the pro-
vider’s hours — especially if you need evening or weekend hours. BPD 
treatment requires regularly scheduled sessions, so make sure you can 
set up a weekly meeting time that works for both you and the provider.
 
✓ Do you offer after-hours and emergency coverage? Part of the diag-
nosis of BPD includes risky or self-harming behavior. Ask the therapist 
what provisions she makes for emergencies. Therapists’ policies range 
from being on call 24/7 with backup when the therapist is out of town 
to not being available for any reason after hours (in which case the 
therapist usually gives patients instructions to contact 911 or go to an 
emergency room in the case of an emergency). To date, no research 
studies look specifically at how the availability of the therapist helps or 
hinders treatment of BPD. Both approaches have good reasons behind 
them. What’s important is that your therapist spells out the policies and 
procedures in advance and you feel comfortable with them.
 
✓ What fees do you charge? Ask the provider what fees she charges 
for sessions? If your treatment involves multiple sessions a week, are 
the fees for individual and group therapy different or the same? Will 
the therapist accept your insurance? Some practitioners don’t accept 
all insurance plans, and others don’t accept any insurance plans. 
Furthermore, some insurance plans don’t include mental health. We 
recommend that you check with your insurance plan, as well as with the 
therapist. Sometimes providers can convince insurance companies to 
pay for more than their usual reimbursement when the treatment is a 
validated treatment for BPD.

130
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
 
✓ Do you have a professional license? Ask whether or not the provider 
has a license to practice. If not, go elsewhere. The only exception is 
when graduate students are practicing under the supervision of licensed 
professionals.
A variety of people with different titles, different levels of education, and 
different areas of expertise provide mental health services. In the following 
sections, we provide brief descriptions of the different roles and educational 
backgrounds mental health professionals can have.
Primary healthcare providers
Whenever you experience significant emotional problems, we recommend 
that you begin your search for treatment by going to your primary health-
care provider — whether that person is a physician, a nurse practitioner, or 
a physician assistant — for a thorough physical checkup. Various physical 
issues sometimes cause symptoms that often look like emotional disorders. 
For example, brain trauma, medications, various hormonal imbalances, 
dietary supplements, and certain chronic diseases sometimes produce emo-
tional problems, such as anxiety, depression, or agitation.
Participation isn’t optional
If you’re seeking help to treat your BPD, the 
good news is that treatment works and you 
can expect to feel better. The bad news is that 
many people never access the kind of help they 
need.
Quite a few people with BPD make appoint-
ments with therapists, but then they cancel. 
Others make appointments and go to two or 
three sessions, but then they stop. Do those 
people receive the help they were looking for 
when they signed up for therapy? Well, they 
don’t receive much. So, why do so many people 
stop therapy or never start?
People hesitate to make appointments, cancel 
them, or quit after a couple of sessions because 
therapy involves some tough stuff. Some people 
find admitting that they need help for their 
emotional problems too embarrassing. Others 
find talking about feelings and problems over-
whelming. And still others are pessimistic and 
don’t believe that talking to someone else will 
help them with the painful turbulence of their 
lives.
Imagine that you have a sudden high fever and 
a sore throat. You miss work and can’t get out of 
bed. After a few days, you still feel horrible. You 
may call your doctor’s office for an appointment 
or go to an urgent-care facility. You probably 
don’t feel ashamed that this illness requires 
medical attention. The same should be true 
when you’re suffering from BPD. This disorder 
is painful and often involves being unable to 
function, so don’t be ashamed to ask for help.
Effective treatments do exist for BPD. The 
guidance and support of a therapist can be 
extremely helpful. However, to get better, you 
have to participate and follow through with 
the therapy. Remember that you are the most 
important person on your treatment team.

131
 Chapter 11: Preparing to Conquer BPD
After your primary healthcare provider rules out physical causes, you should 
seek the services of a licensed mental health professional for a diagnosis of 
your specific condition. Primary healthcare providers rarely have sufficient 
training for understanding the subtle differences in emotional disorders.
Psychologists
Practicing psychologists typically hold a doctoral degree (PhD, PsyD, or 
EdD) in clinical or counseling psychology. These degrees require at least 
four years of graduate education. In addition, psychologists generally have 
to complete a one-year internship and often a one- or two-year postdoctoral 
fellowship, too. They also must pass a comprehensive examination prior to 
licensure.
Psychologists usually focus on treatments that have scientific support for 
their effectiveness. They also use special interview techniques and psycho-
logical tests to assist in making accurate diagnoses for emotional disorders. 
In fact, some psychologists specialize only in assessment and refer people to 
other practitioners after they’ve determined the precise diagnosis. In a few 
states, psychologists go on to complete further training, which enables them 
to prescribe psychotropic medication — you need to check whether your 
state allows psychologists to do so.
 
If you have any doubt about whether your diagnosis is correct, you may want 
to see a psychologist who specializes in assessment. Getting the right diag-
nosis makes a big difference when you and your therapist are deciding which 
treatments to pursue.
Psychiatrists
Psychiatrists have a doctoral degree in medicine (either MD or DO). Board-
certified psychiatrists have also completed a four-year residency that spe-
cializes in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. In addition, they 
have passed a rigorous oral and written examination in psychiatry. Most 
psychiatrists focus on treating emotional disorders through psychotropic 
medication. They’re experts in these medications. However, they vary greatly 
in their expertise in delivering scientifically validated psychotherapies, so 
psychiatrists and other mental health professionals often team up in the 
treatment of emotional disorders.
 
Physicians who hold an MD can call themselves psychiatrists even if they 
haven’t obtained additional training in psychiatry. This practice is unusual, 
but you should make sure your psychiatrist has completed at least a four-year 
residency in psychiatry.

132
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Counselors
Counselors who are licensed to provide mental health services generally 
have a two-year master’s degree (MA or MEd) in psychology, theology, or 
counseling. To obtain their license to practice, counselors have to complete 
varying amounts of supervised practice following the degree (depending on 
the state) and a written examination. Many counselors also work for a cer-
tification from the National Academy of Certified Mental Health Counselors. 
Although they’re not as thoroughly trained as psychologists in the science of 
human behavior, many qualified counselors have received specialized train-
ing in the treatment of BPD, using one of the scientifically supported tech-
niques we review earlier in this chapter (see the “Researching the Treatment 
Strategies That Work for BPD” section for more info).
Marriage and family therapists
Marriage and family therapists typically have completed a master’s degree 
(MA) in marriage or family therapy, followed by two years or more of super-
vised practice and a written examination. Some have doctorate degrees from 
programs in social work, psychology, counseling, theology, or some related 
field. As a result, their actual training and background varies more from prac-
titioner to practitioner than some of the other mental health professionals. 
Marriage and family therapists tend to specialize in working with couples 
Can I treat BPD on my own?
Generally speaking, self-help isn’t enough to 
treat BPD. But, you can help yourself in many 
different ways. First, find out all you can about 
BPD. Find out about the causes, the signs, and 
the symptoms. Research the most effective 
treatments.
Take advantage of the treatment you choose for 
yourself. In other words, go to every session, 
and carry out suggested assignments between 
sessions. Dare to be honest with yourself and 
your therapist. Don’t sugarcoat your behavior 
or hide your true feelings.
You can find many Internet support groups for 
people with BPD, their friends, and their family 
members. Some of these groups are extremely 
helpful and well run. Others can be hurtful. Look 
for a helpful problem-solving approach to the 
group’s entries. Be wary of groups that focus on 
complaints and negative comments.
Be careful not to provide too much informa-
tion online. Unfortunately, some people pose 
as people with BPD or their family members to 
take advantage of people who are really suffer-
ing and looking for help. Take particular caution 
before you agree to meet anyone you’ve only 
met online.

133
 Chapter 11: Preparing to Conquer BPD
and families. Be sure to ask whether your marriage and family therapist has 
had specialized training in the treatment of BPD with a scientifically based 
approach.
Psychiatric nurses
The training of psychiatric nurses varies significantly, ranging from an associ-
ate’s degree in nursing to a doctorate nursing degree. Nurses often act as case 
managers for people with serious emotional problems. Some of these nurses 
have sufficient training that enables them to prescribe psychotropic medica-
tion. Others focus on providing psychotherapy, although, again, their training 
varies greatly, so you have to ask what your nurse has been trained to do.
Social workers
Most social workers have a master’s degree in social work (MSW), but a 
small percentage of them have a doctoral degree in social work (DSW). After 
they attain their degree, social workers have to complete a varying amount 
of supervised practice before they can take their written examination. Social 
workers often serve as case managers for people with serious emotional dis-
orders. Depending on their training, many social workers can also provide 
diagnoses and psychotherapy for people with BPD. Once again, you have to 
ask about your social worker’s specific training.
 
Other practitioners who claim to be in the so-called healing arts sometimes 
nail signs to their doors announcing that they provide services for all sorts 
of ailments, including BPD. No research supports most of what these practi-
tioners do. In fact, you could easily pay a lot of money, waste a lot of time, or 
even get worse by going to one of these practitioners. So, avoid fortunetellers, 
crystal gazers, and sellers of snake oil. Make sure your mental health provider 
is licensed to provide counseling, psychotherapy, and/or medications.
 
You can obtain referrals to qualified, licensed mental health professionals 
through your insurance company, your primary healthcare provider, psychol-
ogy and psychiatry departments at local medical schools and universities, and 
state associations for each of the mental health professions.
Starting Treatment
Assuming you make the decision to begin treatment for BPD, what should 
you expect next? First, you need to expect to have to answer quite a few 
questions. These questions are essential and are designed to help your thera-
pist learn about you and your problems. Be prepared to answer questions 
about the following issues and concerns:

134
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
 
✓ Symptoms: Symptoms include anger, rage, sadness, anxiety, impulsive 
actions, substance abuse, self-harming behaviors, suicidal thoughts or 
actions, relationship problems, and so on. Your provider will ask you 
questions about all your symptoms — When did they start? How do they 
interfere with what you want to do? How frequent are they? What kinds 
of situations worsen them? How distressed do you feel about them?
 
✓ Physical health issues: Your provider will undoubtedly ask you ques-
tions about your overall physical health — How is your sleep? How is 
your appetite? Do you have any physical pain? Have you ever had sig-
nificant injuries, surgeries, or illnesses? Have you had a physical exam 
recently? Do you take prescription medications for anything at all? Do 
you take over-the-counter medications or supplements?
 
✓ History: Many factors, including childhood circumstances, contribute 
to the development of BPD, so your provider will ask you about your 
history — Have you ever been abused? Have you ever experienced a 
trauma of any kind? Have you ever been hospitalized? Have you ever 
thought about or attempted suicide? Have you previously taken medica-
tions or received treatment for any emotional problems? What is your 
educational background? What is your work history? What is your his-
tory with relationships?
 
✓ Family: Because genetics play a role in the development of BPD, your 
provider will ask you about your family — Does anyone in your family 
have emotional problems of any kind? Have any of your relatives 
received medication or psychotherapy for emotional disorders?
 
✓ Finances: Some people express discomfort when discussing financial 
issues, but your therapist needs to know a few basics — Do you have 
insurance coverage? Can you afford treatment? Are finances a source of 
stress for you or your family?
Evaluating your therapy
A core symptom of BPD involves having trouble with relationships. One 
reason for this difficulty is that people with BPD easily misinterpret the 
meaning of what other people say to them. So, if at any time you feel criti-
cized, unsupported, or angered by your therapist’s words or actions, you 
need to check out your concerns. Try not to lash out or walk out, but try to 
find out what led to your reaction. Be open to what your therapist says.
After you’ve been to a half dozen sessions or so and after you’ve checked out 
any concerns you may have, you should typically feel quite comfortable divulg-
ing and discussing just about anything with your therapist. You should feel like 
your therapist listens to you and respects you as a person. Most therapists 
show reasonable warmth, empathy, and concern. If yours doesn’t, discuss your 
concerns. If you truly feel like you’re not connecting with your therapist, get a 
second opinion by seeking a one-time consultation from another therapist.

135
 Chapter 11: Preparing to Conquer BPD
 
On the other hand, you can’t expect your therapist to become your best friend 
or your mother. See Chapter 25 for more information about what you can rea-
sonably expect from the therapist/client relationship.
Giving therapy some time
Psychotherapy for BPD takes a little time. Some programs, such as schema 
therapy (see the “Researching the Treatment Strategies That Work for BPD” 
section for more info about this particular technique), may take as long 
as three years, but the results may be worth the wait. Other programs are 
designed to be much shorter. However, you can expect treatment to take at 
least several months before you start to feel moderate improvement. Many 
people with BPD remain in therapy for several years.
Within six months to a year of therapy, you can reasonably expect to reduce 
and manage your urges to engage in self-harm or suicide. Other goals, such 
as improved life satisfaction, reduced impulsivity, and better relationships, 
are likely to require significantly more time. Be patient. You’re likely to get 
better when you give treatment enough time and effort.
Confidentiality concerns
All licensed professionals have ethical codes 
that require them to keep any information they 
learn about you, their client, confidential. State 
laws back up these codes, so you can trust that 
your therapist won’t reveal details about your 
life to anyone else. A few exceptions to these 
confidentiality codes and laws include
 ✓ Harm to self: If your therapist feels you’re in 
imminent danger of causing serious harm 
to yourself, she has to take certain pre-
cautions, which can include alerting your 
family or authorities or even having you 
hospitalized.
 ✓ Harm to others: If your therapist firmly 
believes that you’re about to cause seri-
ous harm to someone else, she has to take 
action to notify others or to hospitalize you.
 ✓ Abuse of children or elders: If you tell your 
therapist that you’re currently harming a 
child or elder, your therapist has to inform 
authorities.
Your therapist should highlight these and any 
other exceptions to confidentiality that she 
practices in a written statement that you read 
and sign at your initial session. Be sure to ask 
your therapist if you don’t understand any of the 
language that the statement contains.
Remember: Members in group therapy are 
asked to keep anything they hear during their 
group sessions confidential. Most members 
comply with this rule; however, someone may 
break the rule. Although we generally encour-
age openness in group therapy, if you have con-
cerns about sharing something with your group, 
discuss the issue with your individual therapist 
first.

Chapter 12
Breaking Through Barriers 
to Change
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the fears people have about change
▶ Putting a stop to the blaming game
▶ Seeing the effects of procrastination
▶ Understanding the process of change
L
onely, empty, sad, angry, bitter, anxious, stressed, and helpless — these 
are the emotions that many people with borderline personality disorder 
(BPD) experience every day. No wonder they try to quell their pain with dis-
sociation, thrill seeking, self-harm, or substance abuse. Many people with 
BPD ache to feel better but struggle to get the treatment they need.
People with BPD, like many others, fear change. They worry that getting help 
for their problems will be difficult, perhaps embarrassing, and possibly even 
impossible. So, they ask themselves, if treatment may not be successful, why 
take a chance in the first place? For many people, not trying at all seems 
better than trying and failing.
Along with fear, blaming and procrastination also pose barriers to change. 
Searching for villains or victims shackles people in place, unable to move 
forward. Ignoring symptoms or putting off treatment impedes progress. This 
chapter describes the main obstacles that stand in the way of treatment and 
provides strategies for overcoming them.
 
If you have BPD, we urge you to either buy a notebook or start an electronic 
document in which you can take occasional notes, write out your reactions 
to our ideas, and carry out exercises that seem pertinent to you. Consulting 
these notes from time to time can greatly facilitate your progress. Ideally, you 
can share your notes with your therapist as the two of you collaborate on 
your treatment.

138
Part III: Making the Choice  to Change 
Overcoming the Fear of Change
From time to time, we consult with other mental health professionals about 
their cases, including ones that involve BPD. Occasionally, our colleagues 
express concern that their clients with BPD don’t really want to change.
 
You can trust mental health professionals to keep what you tell them confi-
dential. However, sometimes they do seek supervision and consultation from 
colleagues. Such consultation doesn’t violate confidentiality for two reasons. 
First, professionals don’t share names and unrelated details. Second, case con-
sultations are protected by the same rules that protect doctor-patient consul-
tations. Furthermore, consultation enhances your therapist’s ability to deliver 
quality treatment.
In response to our colleagues’ concerns about people with BPD, we ask them 
why they think people with BPD don’t want to change. They give us several 
reasons, such as the following:
 
✓ Our client never tries any of our suggestions.
 
✓ Our client gets angry when we tell him to try something different.
 
✓ Our client says he’s hopeless and that no one can help him.
 
✓ Our client doesn’t listen to what we say.
After hearing these explanations, we explain to our colleagues that these 
patients aren’t simply being stubborn, and they certainly don’t want to 
have BPD.
So, if stubbornness doesn’t explain these patients’ blatant resistance to their 
therapists’ best efforts to treat them, what does? Often, the answer is fear, 
more specifically fear of change. After all, change involves taking a risk and 
being willing to engage in new behaviors, reactions, and ways of thinking. 
The following sections lay out the specific risks that people with BPD fear the 
most.
 
If you have BPD, you likely have some fears about seeking out treatment and 
making changes in your life. These fears are normal, acceptable, and expected. 
If you feel your therapist is pushing you too hard to make changes, discuss 
your fears openly. The two of you can develop a mutual game plan for dealing 
with these worries at a pace that works for you.

139
 Chapter 12: Breaking Through Barriers to Change
Losing who you are: It’s 
not going to happen
Most people with BPD struggle with concerns about who they are, what they 
value, where they belong in the world, and what their long-term goals are all 
about. Not infrequently, people with BPD embrace only one aspect of them-
selves in their self-concept — their disorder. They may not like having BPD, 
but they believe the diagnosis defines them.
As a result of this belief, they worry that losing BPD may leave them with no 
identity at all. Imagine going through each day with no idea who you are or 
what your life is about — a pretty scary thought, right?
 
If you have BPD and worry that getting better may leave you with no identity, 
try to consider the fact that treatment proceeds slowly, one step at a time. As 
you “try on” new ways of being, you can always let go of the ones you don’t 
like. Furthermore, treatment can help you build a new identity, one that feels 
real and authentic to you. With treatment, you can be who you really are, not 
who BPD defines you to be.
Opening up: No need for cold feet
When people with BPD talk about their childhoods, they often recall being 
scolded frequently by parents or other important people in their lives. These 
people told them that they shouldn’t do, say, or feel what they did, said, and 
felt. For example, some people recall hearing the following remarks:
 
✓ “Stop being so nervous. You drive me crazy.”
 
✓ “Let me do that; you can’t do anything right.”
 
✓ “That’s not true. You should know better.”
 
✓ “Stop that crying; you’re such a baby.”
 
✓ “You have no right to be angry with your sister.”
 
✓ “What were you thinking when you did that? Obviously, you weren’t.”
No wonder many people with BPD hesitate to open up when they begin ther-
apy. They’ve been told throughout their lives that what they say, do, and feel 
is wrong.
 
Therapists aren’t there to reenact the role played by people from childhood. 
Instead, they accept all feelings as valid and legitimate. Therapy can help you 
manage your feelings and guide you to make changes — and it does so in an 
atmosphere of acceptance. You can start by saying, “I feel very afraid to reveal 
the real me to you.” Your therapist will likely say something reassuring or 
accepting in response.

140
Part III: Making the Choice  to Change 
Dreading even more loss: Don’t test 
the ones who want to help
Most people with BPD experienced loss, trauma, abuse, or neglect during 
childhood. As adults, the unstable moods and impulsivity they developed in 
childhood may lead to losses of friends, family, and lovers. As a result, they 
look at new relationships with a combination of fear and hope; they crave 
closeness yet expect abandonment. Starting treatment involves engaging in 
a therapeutic relationship with another person, which can be an extremely 
frightening concept for someone who has been part of countless hurtful 
relationships.
To protect against feared abandonment, people with BPD often misbehave 
in social situations. They feel that rejecting is better than being rejected. 
Therefore, they test the limits and patience of people who try to help them to 
make sure they do the hurting — not the other way around. People with BPD 
most often test the relationships they have with significant others and thera-
pists. (See Chapters 21 and 25 for information you need to know if you’re the 
partner or therapist of someone with BPD).
 
Ask your therapist directly whether he thinks that you engage in testing at 
particular times. Listen carefully and try to look out for this pattern in future 
sessions.
Fearing treatment: Don’t let therapy 
myths hold you back
When we meet new people and tell them what we do for a living, we often get 
a plethora of questions about whether or not we can read minds. Well, unfor-
tunately, we can’t — although the idea is sometimes appealing. Mind reading 
is just one of the many myths about psychology and psychotherapy.
Unfortunately, some of these myths stop people from pursuing therapy. Don’t 
let the following therapy myths stop you from proceeding with treatment:
 
✓ Therapy trivializes problems. Some people believe that therapists 
make light of deep, complicated issues when they ask their patients to 
make changes. These people may have experienced horrific abuse or 
trauma and think that being asked to change trivializes the meaning of 
these events. If you feel diminished or trivialized in this way, consider 
telling your therapist how you feel. Good therapists strive to listen and 
understand the full impact of their patients’ painful experiences. They 
will work with you on a gradual plan for change that enables you to feel 
appreciated, accepted, and respected.

141
 Chapter 12: Breaking Through Barriers to Change
 
✓ Therapy can’t give me everything I need. Actually, this myth isn’t a 
complete myth. Therapy can’t give you everything you need. No one 
person on earth can meet another person’s full list of needs. The myth 
in this belief, however, is in believing that you must have all your needs 
met all the time. The real role of therapists is to help you find ways to 
meet your needs more often than you have met them in the past.
 
✓ Therapy doesn’t work. Some people buy into this myth because they’ve 
been to therapy and haven’t experienced success or because they’ve 
seen a friend or loved one go to therapy without any obvious benefit. 
However, hundreds of studies have shown that therapy does work for 
a wide range of problems, and studies in the past several decades have 
provided convincing evidence that therapy can reduce BPD symptoms. 
Keep in mind, however, that not every type of therapy has demonstrated 
effectiveness for BPD — but a number of them have (see Chapter 11 for 
information about which kinds of therapy work best for treating BPD).
 
✓ Therapists can’t possibly understand me. Some people worry that their 
problems are so deep and complex that no one can fully understand 
them. This myth also contains a grain of truth — no one can connect 
with and appreciate every single facet of your issues 100 percent of the 
time. However, therapists have spent years in training and practice, 
listening carefully to people as they explain their feelings, histories, and 
pain. Your therapist may understand you in a way that you haven’t expe-
rienced previously.
 
✓ Therapists will ask me to do things I can’t do. The fact that therapists 
do indeed suggest that you attempt various new ways of thinking and 
behaving fuels this myth. However, if you feel unable to follow a sug-
gestion, talk about it with your therapist — ethical therapists never ask 
people to do what they’re not prepared to do.
 
If you have BPD, write down any of your concerns about therapy and treat-
ment in your notebook and take them to your therapist to discuss. Try to be 
open to the idea that your therapist wants to help.
Looking at fears of change in action
The following story about Alexis illustrates how someone with BPD may 
refuse treatment because of a few misconceptions and fears. Alexis worries 
about losing her identity, feeling worse as a result of treatment, failing after 
trying to get better, and opening up to someone new.
Alexis wakes up dizzy, uncomfortable, and groggy. Head pounding, she 
tries to roll over, but straps tie her wrists and ankles to the hospital 
bed. “Nurse! Nurse, help me!” she yells. She remembers little of the night 
before. She had a huge fight with her husband, Aaron, and she thinks she 
may have taken too much pain medicine.

142
Part III: Making the Choice  to Change 
A woman with a white coat and badge enters the room, “Good morning, 
Alexis. How are you feeling?”
“Like crap,” Alexis replies, “Get these stupid straps off. Who are you?”
“I’m your psychologist while you’re here. My name is Dr. Rachel Hunter. 
Do you remember what happened last night?”
“I know I was furious with my husband, that lazy good-for-nothing piece 
of trash. He hasn’t worked for months; he sits on his butt and watches 
reality shows on the television while I work extra shifts just to see our 
credit cards get overdrawn because he’s eating popcorn all day,” Alexis 
speaks quickly and continues without pausing, “I stand on my feet all day 
and they hurt like hell. So I was so mad that I probably took some extra 
pills to get to sleep. When I get mad at him I get so worked up that I can’t 
sleep. Then I have to get up and go to work and I’m screwed.”
“Alexis, you took about ten times the normal dosage of your pain medi-
cine. You were unconscious when your husband found you. When you 
got to the hospital, you became combative. You were pretty violent. We 
put the restraints on for your safety,” Dr. Hunter explains. “You know, 
this is your third hospitalization this year for overdosing. The last two 
times you checked yourself out of the hospital against medical advice. 
As you know, we believe that you have a disorder called borderline per-
sonality disorder. We’re very concerned about your going home without 
getting some help first. Would you consider talking about a program we 
have here at the hospital? Many people who work through the program 
feel better and are better able to cope with the world.”
“Look doctor, there’s nothing wrong with me. I’m mad at my husband, 
my marriage is a failure, and I work too hard. I’ve gone to counselors 
before and nothing changed. I don’t think I can change, and I’m not going 
to waste my time for nothing. I don’t need to fail at something else. I just 
need to get off my butt and lose the loser.”
“So, Alexis, it sounds like you’re worried that you may not benefit from 
this program and that to get better, you’ve just got to leave your hus-
band. No wonder you don’t want to stay. Let’s keep talking while I get 
these restraints off. I can tell that you’re calm,” Dr. Hunter begins to 
loosen the straps around Alexis’ wrists.
“Thanks, that feels better,” Alexis shakes her hands. “You know, I have 
developed a pretty tough exterior to keep myself going. I always go to 
work. I have to go to work, and I try not to let others see how horrible my 
life is. So, I worry that if I start some kind of treatment, I’ll just melt away 
and dissolve. I know that sounds crazy, but I’m scared to get help. I think 
it will make me worse. As much as I hate my husband, I’m afraid of living 
without him.”
Dr. Hunter explains how treatment really works, and she helps Alexis see 
that a few misconceptions about therapy are stopping her from getting 
the help she needs.

143
 Chapter 12: Breaking Through Barriers to Change
Alexis’s concerns and worries about therapy are legitimate and completely 
understandable. However, Dr. Hunter helps her decide that treatment is 
worth the risk. Alexis’s therapy will require some time, but it’s also likely to 
teach her how to set better limits with her husband and how to deal with her 
own emotions in less self-destructive ways.
Taking Charge and Giving Up 
the Victim Role
People search for answers to why bad things happen to them — they try to 
discover who or what is to blame. In the same way, many people who have 
BPD want to know why they have the disorder and whom they can blame for 
it. Unfortunately, this search for a guilty party usually ends up causing more 
harm than good. No single cause is responsible for BPD and no one person is 
to blame (see Chapter 4 for information about the multitude of causes).
In addition, people with traumatic histories often respond to BPD by feeling 
helpless and hopeless. These feelings lead them to adopt the role of a sick 
person or a victim. Although these roles have a few advantages, they inevita-
bly handcuff people in their hopeless, helpless states of mind.
Ending the blame game
Most people with BPD can recount numerous negative episodes from their 
childhoods that caused them pain, distress, disgust, or angst. As they comb 
through a series of such episodes, sometimes they blame themselves for 
what happened to them. For example, when children experience abuse, they 
typically see themselves as deserving the abuse. As a result, their self-esteem 
disintegrates, and they learn to loathe the very essence of their beings. 
Unfortunately, many people with BPD cling to this same belief that they 
somehow caused their own misfortunes and possibly even their BPD.
 
If you engage in the self-loathing, blaming game, consider reading Chapter 4 to 
understand the multiple causes of BPD. If a girl tells you she’s being abused, 
what do you tell her? Do you blame and defame her? Probably not. Consider 
taking the same perspective for yourself. Write your thoughts about how you 
blame yourself in your notebook, and think about how some of the things you 
blame yourself for aren’t your fault.
On the other hand, many people with BPD blame other people for their cur-
rent distress. They play and replay scenes in their minds in which others 
tormented and hurt them. Although much of the blame may be pointed in the 
right direction, replaying these scenes does little more than re-traumatize.

144
Part III: Making the Choice  to Change 
 
When you find yourself blaming others for your troubles, try to step back. 
Remind yourself that blame just digs a hole. Give yourself five minutes each 
day to blame others, and then focus on something else. If you repeat the five-
minute exercise every day for awhile, you’ll likely find yourself tiring of the 
blame game.
 
One legitimate treatment strategy does involve replaying past traumatic expe-
riences. However, this treatment (often called imaginal exposure or flooding) 
needs to occur in conditions carefully controlled by a highly trained therapist. 
We generally don’t recommend attempting this technique on your own.
Thinking like a victim: It 
doesn’t do you any good
When you have a fever, going to bed and resting usually helps your body 
fight off whatever is causing the illness. If you’re sick with something more 
severe than a low fever, you may have to go to a hospital, where a team of 
healthcare professionals can take care of you. Because BPD is a kind of emo-
tional illness, part of you probably wants to go to bed and let others take 
care of you. However, for the most part, treating BPD takes active participa-
tion from you, the person who has BPD.
 
When BPD causes someone to want to hurt himself or others, a hospital set-
ting may indeed be necessary. During situations like these, when someone is 
at risk of physical injury or death, a team of healthcare professionals may pro-
vide the best and most appropriate care.
Thinking like a victim involves believing that you’re dependent, sick, and 
incapable of helping yourself. Victims feel that their problems are especially 
overwhelming and often complain to others about them. Victims bemoan 
that their suffering isn’t their fault — and, in fact, it isn’t! But victims hurt 
themselves with their own victimhood because feeling like a victim does 
nothing to inspire positive change.
At first, victims may indeed receive extra attention and help. Other people 
feel sorry for them and are motivated to try to alleviate their suffering, which 
is one advantage of taking on the role of victim. However, other people even-
tually find themselves burning out because they repeatedly try to help but 
have little to no success. Victims are so entrenched in their helplessness that 
they can’t or won’t allow anything or anyone to help them. Over time, think-
ing like a victim leads to a passive acceptance of BPD for both the helpers 
and the sufferers. Meaningful change comes when the sufferer finds forgive-
ness and learns to start coping.

145
 Chapter 12: Breaking Through Barriers to Change
Finding forgiveness and coping
Anger can be a useful emotion. It generates energy and focuses attention. 
Anger increases the body’s ability to respond to danger. However, when 
you’re angry about something in the past, your attention and energy focus 
solely on the past. As a result, you can’t move forward.
When you have experienced trauma, feeling anger at the person or people 
you believe hurt you is perfectly natural. However, you need to realize that 
your anger shackles you to your past — you get stuck in the middle of the old 
trauma. Sometimes people with BPD believe that forgiving somehow means 
admitting that what happened to them was acceptable. However, learning to 
let go isn’t saying that what happened was okay; it’s saying that you’re willing 
to heal.
 
If you’re struggling with BPD, try to understand that although you’re not to 
blame for your BPD, you are responsible for making the changes you want in 
your life. See Chapters 15 through 20 for lots of ideas about how to make those 
changes.
Stop Procrastinating
Most people put off doing things they fear or see as especially difficult. 
Perhaps you have put off looking into therapy for years because you fear that 
therapy will hurt more than help. Or, you start therapy but can’t seem to get 
anywhere with it. Your brain likely manufactures excuses for not pursuing 
therapy faster than the United States Mint stamps out coins. The following 
sections take a look at some of the more problematic excuses and how to 
beat them back.
Dismantling excuses
People create excuses to avoid addressing problems that seem larger than 
they can handle. Excuses (some people would call them lies) are like stories 
we create to promote procrastination. Quite often, these stories seem believ-
able. Therefore, before you can move forward, you have to learn how to see 
through your mind’s excuses to recognize the lies behind them. Table 12-1 
lists some common excuses and some arguments (also known as excuse bust-
ers) against them.

146

Table 12-1 
Excavating and Demolishing Excuses
Excuse
Excuse Buster
I need to find just the right time for deal-
ing with my issues — then I’ll start doing 
something.
The right time never seems to come. 
The right time is now.
My case is just too difficult to treat.
I am capable of learning. I survived 
my childhood and learned to talk, 
read, and walk. So, I can surely learn 
a few things in treatment, too.
I need a guarantee that treatment will 
work before I can invest my time and 
energy into it.
Nothing in life comes with a guaran-
tee. This kind of thinking just keeps 
me from doing anything. However, 
I can use this book to find out what 
therapists know works for most 
people with BPD. I can’t get a better 
guarantee than that.
I tried therapy three times before and it 
didn’t work. So I know now that it won’t 
work for me.
I didn’t try one of the treatments that 
has proved to work for BPD. But even 
if I had, sometimes a person needs to 
try out several therapists before one 
clicks.
I’m already overwhelmed. Therapy would 
just add to my pain.
I can talk to a therapist about my 
concerns. No one is going to ask 
more from me than I can give.
I don’t have insurance, and I can’t afford 
treatment.
Some universities, medical schools, 
and nonprofit community mental 
health centers provide low-cost 
treatment. And by causing me to lose 
jobs, my BPD is keeping me from 
reaching my potential. I need to deal 
with this issue.
I don’t have the time for treatment.
I waste a lot more time with my self-
destructive behaviors, such as cut-
ting, drinking too much, and going on 
spending sprees. I need to make time 
for treatment.
 
No doubt your mind can conjure up many creative variations of the excuses 
in Table 12-1. Consider titling a page of your notebook, “Excavating and 
Demolishing Excuses.” Jot down your mind’s reasons why you should put off 
tackling your problems. Then come up with an argument with a more realistic 
perspective to demolish your excuses. Here are a few questions you can ask 
yourself to help develop some excuse busters of your own:

147
 Chapter 12: Breaking Through Barriers to Change
 
✓ What would I tell a friend who used my excuse?
 
✓ Will staying where I’m at get me where I want to go?
 
✓ Is part of my excuse simply not true?
If you have trouble coming up with excuse busters, or if you don’t think 
you’re making excuses but you are putting off treatment, you’re not a lost 
cause. Read more of this book and see whether you start feeling a little differ-
ently after awhile.
Debating the decision
Another technique that can loosen the hold procrastination has on you is 
called a cost-benefit analysis, a technique psychologists have been using 
for decades. The beauty of a cost-benefit analysis is that it’s fairly easy and 
straightforward — and also surprisingly effective at the same time. You can 
use a cost-benefit analysis to tackle almost anything that has you stuck. For 
this reason, we use this technique in several chapters of this book.
A cost-benefit analysis provides a great way to combat procrastination 
because procrastination almost always stirs up ambivalent feelings. Part of 
you sees the advantages or benefits of moving ahead with treatment, while 
part of you fears the costs or disadvantages of starting treatment. A cost-
benefit analysis lets you objectively view these conflicting thoughts and 
feelings side by side.
The following example of Lucas describes how a cost-benefit analysis can 
help convince someone that treatment is worth a shot — even when he’s 
been refusing it for years.
Lucas speeds through an intersection well after the yellow light turns red. 
Horns and squealing brakes accompany the crash. A pickup truck broad-
sides his car on the passenger’s side. His red compact car takes the full 
impact of the crash and veers into oncoming traffic. A minivan stopped at 
the light can’t get out of the way. Lucas’s red car slams into the front of 
the minivan, triggering its air bags. By this time, the driver of the pickup 
leaps out of his vehicle, shaking and swearing at Lucas, “What the hell — 
you ran a red light. What’s wrong with you?”
The woman slides out from behind her air bag, screaming that she just 
dropped off her kids at school. Blood drips from her forehead. Lucas 
slumps in his totaled car, not speaking. Soon police and paramedics 
arrive on the scene. Lucas slurs his words and smells like alcohol. He has 
an open container of beer in the cup holder next to his seat, and the air in 
the car smells like marijuana. After checking for injuries, the police arrest 
Lucas. This accident is his third one this year, and this arrest is his fourth 
one for driving under the influence.

148
Part III: Making the Choice  to Change 
In jail, Lucas reluctantly agrees to a psychological evaluation. He is diag-
nosed with alcohol dependence, cannabis (marijuana) abuse, and BPD. 
The judge orders mandated inpatient drug treatment in a secure facility. 
Lucas is only 20 years old, and the judge wants to give him a chance.
The police transport Lucas from the jail to the rehab site. He refuses to 
speak to anyone, fights with the staff, and ends up in isolation. After a 
week or so, a therapist approaches him again. Lucas, bored by his isola-
tion, agrees to meet. They sit together in a small room with a one-way 
mirror. The therapist asks Lucas whether he is willing to discuss all the 
reasons why he doesn’t want to get treatment. Lucas quickly agrees, eager 
to show the therapist why he doesn’t need to go to therapy. Together, 
they begin a cost-benefit analysis. This is the first time Lucas takes a 
reasoned look at the costs and benefits of his treatment avoidance.
Lucas and his therapist talk about the cost-benefit analysis. For the first 
time, Lucas begins to see where his life may go if he doesn’t make some 
changes. Lucas agrees to start working with an individual therapist, and, 
after a few sessions, he agrees to begin group therapy. He also agrees to 
talk to a psychiatrist about medication that may help him with his urges 
to drink.
This simple technique helps people see what thoughts are preventing them 
from going forward with treatment. For instance, most of the time people fear 
failure, embarrassment, and change. Looking at the costs of giving into these 
fears and staying in one place can be a catalyst for progressing to the next 
stage.
You can use the following steps to create your own cost-benefit analysis for 
delaying treatment for your BPD. You can see Lucas’s analysis in Table 12-2 
for an example.
 
1. On a page in your notebook, write down “Cost-Benefit Analysis of Not 
Seeking Treatment” (or make a copy of the Cost-Benefit Analysis Form 
in Appendix B).
 
2. Make two columns underneath the title. Label the first one “Benefits” 
and the second one “Costs.”
 
3. In the Benefits column, write down all the reasons why staying the 
same and not getting treatment are good for you.
 
 These reasons can include not having to change what you like about 
your current situation, not having to experience the pain of change, 
not having to open up to someone, and not having to pay the costs 
(personal, financial, and time) of treatment.
 
4. In the Costs column, write down all the ways that not getting help and 
treatment may cost you both in the short run and in the long run.
 
 Consider including how BPD is hurting you, how BPD is hurting your 
family and friends, and how BPD can even hurt innocent bystanders.

 Chapter 12: Breaking Through Barriers to Change
 
5. Write out a few thoughts and reflections about the costs and benefits 
you’ve come up with — if you want to.
 
 Think about the relative pluses and minuses of seeking treatment, and, if 
you’re already working with a therapist, discuss your results.

I hate talking about myself to stupid 
shrinks. If I stay out of treatment, I 
don’t have to talk to anyone.
If I don’t start treatment, they might send 
me to prison.
I can’t stand listening to other people 
whine about their problems. Group 
therapy is full of whiners.
I’m bored sitting in my room all day.
I like partying and having a good time. 
Drugs and alcohol are fun.
I shouldn’t have crashed my car. Now 
I don’t have wheels. Maybe I can get 
help so I don’t do stupid stuff like this 
anymore.
Rules are made to be broken. I’m no 
goody two-shoes.
If I don’t start treatment, I’ll probably get 
killed or kill someone else.
I don’t trust other people with my 
problems, and I don’t see how talking 
to people can help me.
I’ve seen some people get help and stay 
clean. It’d be nice not to always be in 
trouble.
Getting Comfortable with 
the Process of Change
Starting treatment can feel like a tough and risky decision. You don’t know 
what to expect, and you worry that you may not get better. This section takes 
a look at the process of change and how you can get comfortable with it.
Change takes time, and progress varies. Do you remember learning to ride a 
bike as a child? You started out with a lot of help. Either training wheels or a 
person had to hold you up or you fell over. Gradually, you learned to balance 
on two wheels with support. Then the training wheels came off or the person 
let go. For a second or two, you were on your own. Balanced for only a short 
time, the wheels started to wobble and you needed some extra help again.

150
Part III: Treatments for BPD 
Learning to ride a bike takes most kids repeated trials and a lot of falls. For 
some kids, the balancing is too scary and too difficult. They may give up only 
to try again in a few months or even a year. A few kids have so much trouble 
that they never learn to ride a bike. But, fortunately, most kids stick with it 
long enough to learn how to ride without support. The common saying that 
once you learn how to ride a bike, you never forget, is true. Even so, most 
adults who haven’t been on a bike since childhood start out slowly with a 
little fear, but they quickly regain their skills.
Getting help for BPD (like most of life’s problems) is a lot like learning to ride 
a bike. At first, you need a lot of support. You may fail and fall quite a bit in 
the beginning. You may even give up for awhile. But, most people who stick 
with either bike riding or psychotherapy eventually gain skills and balance. 
They certainly wobble from time to time and even fall off occasionally, but, 
with repeated practice, the skills become second nature to them. Like riding 
a bike, after you learn how to face your problems, you never forget — sure 
you may be frightened and start out slowly, but with a little support, you can 
get right back up again.

Explaining BPD to Others
In This Chapter
▶ Talking to others about BPD
▶ Figuring out what to say to whom
▶ Deciding the best way to say what you need to say
A
fter people find out they have borderline personality disorder 
(BPD) — something they really need to verify with a mental health 
professional — they often wonder what, when, where, and how to tell other 
people, not to mention which “other people” to tell in the first place. They 
typically report feeling ambivalent about whether they should tell anyone 
at all. They worry about being stigmatized or even discriminated against by 
others. Should they tell their friends, family, co-workers, bosses, spouses, or 
others? If they do, will other people understand and express empathy and 
support, or will they react with criticism and derision?
In this chapter, we help you sort out
 
✓ Whether to tell anyone at all
 
✓ Whom you may want to tell
 
✓ What to say
 
✓ How to say what you want to say
Don’t panic; you don’t really have to tell anybody. The choice is entirely up 
to you. This chapter can help you make this decision and know how to tell 
someone if you decide to do so.
Deciding Whether and Whom to Tell
Before you decide whether to tell anyone you have BPD, verifying that you 
truly have the disorder is a good idea. Reading the symptom list we give you 
in Chapter 3 isn’t enough. You need a diagnosis from a trained mental health 

152
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
professional who has experience treating this disorder. After you have that 
diagnosis, you can look at the symptoms in Chapter 3 to see whether you 
think it fits.
If a professional says you have BPD but your perusal of Chapter 3 doesn’t 
lead you to the same conclusion, consider obtaining a second opinion from 
another experienced mental health professional.
After you feel certain the diagnosis fits, you have some decisions to make. 
Here, we take you through the decision-making process — in terms of 
whether to tell others and whom to tell if you do.
The benefits and costs of telling
We recommend that you carefully assess your reasons for telling someone 
else about your BPD. Consider why you want to share this information and 
how you think the other person will react. Working through the following two 
questions may help you decide whom to tell.
Do you believe that making this revelation 
will benefit you in some way?
The answer to this question will vary with each person you consider telling 
about your BPD. For some people, telling a spouse can result in greater empa-
thy if the spouse is reasonably understanding. Telling an abusive spouse, 
however, isn’t likely to result in any benefit.
Besides greater empathy, another benefit you may hope for in telling some-
one else about your BPD is greater closeness to the person you tell. More 
often than not, however, this hope is an unwarranted expectation because 
many people know little about BPD and what they have heard of it often 
comes with a negative label. Unfortunately, the very term personality disorder 
often carries a highly charged stigma, as if it means something is fundamen-
tally wrong with the person who has the disorder. As a result, people can end 
up not trusting you or thinking that you’re crazy. In turn, they may discrimi-
nate against you. As mental health professionals, we know this perspective is 
wrong, but many people don’t.
On the other hand, some folks may be able to help you if you decide to 
explain your BPD to them (see the “Figuring out whom to tell” section). We 
simply urge caution in determining whether telling a particular person will 
help you or hurt you.
 
Even when you think telling someone will be beneficial to you and that person, 
you can never know for certain what another person’s reaction will be. You 
need to be prepared for the unexpected. Unfortunately, not everyone will be 
empathetic.

153
 Chapter 13: Explaining BPD to Others
What negative consequences do you think 
can happen if you tell someone?
Carefully consider all possible negative reactions you may receive from anyone 
you decide to tell about your BPD. We discuss the possibility of stigma and 
discrimination in the preceding section. In addition, some people you tell may 
feel afraid because of their own ignorance, and, as a result, they may treat you 
like you have the plague or some other contagious illness. Others may worry 
that they don’t know how to interact with you anymore, and, in turn, they may 
avoid you. Some may want to help, but they may feel petrified at the thought 
of doing the wrong thing and making things worse. Still others may view a per-
sonality disorder as an excuse for bad behavior, and, thus, they may believe 
you’re using your diagnosis to rationalize your inappropriate actions.
Ava’s story demonstrates some of the negative consequences of revealing 
BPD to the wrong person at the wrong time and place. Unfortunately, she was 
caught off guard and suffered from her disclosure.
Ava pulls her sweater down over her wrists to cover the bandages. She 
hopes no one at the bank notices them. She’s only had the job for two 
months and desperately needs to keep it for the healthcare benefits. 
She’s on new-hire probation until she’s been there for 90 days, and she’s 
already missed a couple of days of work. She punches in and smiles at 
her co-workers already gathered in the break room. “Hey, whassup?” she 
asks Ryan, a teller who usually works beside her.
“Not much,” he replies, “did you have a good weekend?”
Ava starts to feel anxious. She wonders why Ryan is asking her about her 
weekend. She thinks, “He couldn’t know that I spent Friday night in the 
ER after the cuts on my wrists started to bleed too much. But, maybe he 
was there, too — he has a couple of kids. One of them has asthma. Maybe 
his kid had an asthma attack, and he had to take him to the ER.” Ava’s 
thoughts begin to spin out of control.
Ryan puts his arm on her arm concerned. As she pulls away, her sweater 
pulls up, revealing her bandage. “Ava, are you okay? Hey, what happened 
to your wrist?”
“I cut myself shaving,” she stammers.
Ryan says, “Come on, Ava. That’s a whole lot more than a nick from shav-
ing; besides, you don’t shave your wrists do you?”
“Okay, Ryan. Promise not to tell anyone, but I have borderline personality 
disorder, and sometimes I cut myself to feel better. This time it got out of 
control. I know it sounds crazy, but . . .”
“Gosh, Ava. I didn’t know. I’ve never heard of that. I’m sorry.”
Ryan later asks the branch manager what she knows about BPD and men-
tions that Ava has it. The manager brings Ava into her office and tells her 
that she isn’t working out. Ava loses her job and takes an overdose of 
medication that evening in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.

154
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Ava didn’t intend to tell people at work about her BPD. When Ryan saw her 
bandages, she impulsively blurted out the information. That information 
likely led to her firing, which is why we want you to be prepared for the 
unexpected and to know what you want to say when someone confronts you 
about some of your behaviors. See the sections “Deciding What to Tell” and 
“Telling Your Story Effectively” for more information.
 
Try to have realistic expectations. Discussing your BPD with others can easily 
backfire. Nonetheless, sometimes revealing information about your BPD is a 
good idea. Other times doing so is virtually unavoidable. Never fear — in the 
next section, we go through the list of people you may be thinking about talk-
ing to. Then we tell you what to say and how to say it.
Figuring out whom to tell
Considering the implications of discussing your BPD with others is impor-
tant. Frequently, people with BPD have trouble putting themselves in other 
people’s shoes and fully understanding what their reactions are likely to be. 
This is one of the major problems underlying the BPD symptom of interper-
sonal disturbances (see Chapter 3 for more about the symptoms of BPD). 
So take your time and go through each of the following sections before you 
decide whom to tell. We can’t make this decision for you, but we can high-
light some of the possible reactions.
Telling family
Not all family members should be told the same thing. Some may need a lot 
of information, others very little, and others none. How much you tell your 
family members depends a lot on the nature of your relationship with them. 
But you also need to consider some other factors, such as age, emotional sta-
bility, and views about mental illness. Different family members and issues to 
consider with each include the following:
 
✓ Partners or spouses: If you’re in a committed relationship, we usually 
suggest you discuss your BPD diagnosis with your spouse or partner. 
In fact, many times meeting with your therapist and partner or spouse 
in an informational session can be helpful. A supportive relationship 
can be invaluable in your road to recovery. If your spouse understands 
what’s going on, he or she can provide greater empathy and support.
 
 
On the other hand, if your partner is abusive or highly unsupportive, 
talking about your BPD may not be very useful. In fact, your relationship 
may even be contributing to your BPD symptoms. Talk this decision 
over with your therapist.
 
✓ Children: Every situation is different. Generally, when children live with 
a parent who has BPD, they will at some level know that problems exist. 
You don’t want to try and explain BPD to a very young child. However, 

155
 Chapter 13: Explaining BPD to Others
by the time a child is in elementary school, some limited information is 
appropriate. For example, you may decide to tell your young, school-
aged child that you have a problem controlling your emotions. Even at 
this age, though, they don’t need to hear the diagnosis.
 
 The purpose of talking to children about BPD is mainly to let them know 
that they didn’t do anything wrong. Children need to know that Mom 
or Dad becomes overly emotional because of an illness — not because 
they did something that upset their parent. Make sure that the reasons 
for talking about BPD with children are in their best interest — to obtain 
support from them isn’t a valid reason. You may want to discuss your 
reasons for telling your kids with your therapist first. The two of you can 
role-play the discussion to help you figure out just what to say.
 
✓ Adolescents and adult children: Teenagers and adult children may 
have strong feelings about what being a child of someone with BPD is 
like. Telling them about BPD can be a way of helping them understand 
their own feelings. Some adult children of parents with BPD have made a 
conscious choice to stay away from their BPD parents. If this is the case 
in your situation, you need to respect this boundary. Talk your concerns 
over with your therapist.
 
✓ Parents: If you’re an adolescent, you may wish to confide in your par-
ents about your concerns that you may have BPD. Ideally, they will 
respond with empathy and concern — as well as help you seek out 
professional assistance. On the other hand, they may attempt to mini-
mize your worries by telling you that you’re making a mountain out of a 
molehill. If your parents have typically invalidated you in this manner, 
they will likely do the same thing here. Some parents may also become 
defensive, thinking that you’re blaming them for your problems.
 
 Generally speaking, we think that having this discussion with your par-
ents is worth the risks involved. Even if their reaction is defensive or 
dismissive at first, they may come around in time. Besides, they may 
surprise you.
 
 The major exception to telling your parents about your BPD is if your 
parents have emotionally or physically abused you. In this kind of case, 
you may be better off seeing your school counselor, who can help you 
determine what kind of services you need and where you can get them. 
A counselor conceivably would even recommend reporting your par-
ents’ behavior to authorities if it has been especially outrageous.
 
 Finally, if you’re an adult child, you have less risk in telling your parents. 
You also have a longer history of interacting with your folks, so you 
have an even better idea of what their reaction is likely to be. We recom-
mend that you confide in them if you feel the chances of a supportive 
reaction are reasonable.
 
✓ Siblings: Siblings range in closeness from the love of best friends, to 
outright hate, or even to distant neutrality. Carefully consider your rea-
sons and expectations for divulging your emotional issues with a sibling. 

156
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Under ideal circumstances, siblings can provide much-needed support. 
However, we recommend talking the idea over with your therapist 
before going ahead.
 
✓ Other relatives: Distant relatives rarely need to know anything about 
your BPD. However, some relatives may have been closely involved in 
your life and are, for that reason, capable of giving you support. They 
may also have been hurt by your emotional outbursts or other symp-
toms of BPD, and you may wish to explain your behaviors to them.
Telling friends and acquaintances
Sometimes people with BPD want to tell friends and acquaintances about 
their diagnosis because they think everyone is interested in their struggles. 
You have to consider that talking about yourself isn’t always in your best 
interest (see Chapters 8 and 18 for more information about how your words 
and actions affect other people). Most people in your life don’t need to know 
or want to hear about every detail of your emotional issues. However, a few 
very close friends will likely want to know so that they can be supportive. 
Watch how they react when you bring up the subject and stop talking about 
BPD if they seem disinterested or uncomfortable. Try not to abuse their sup-
port by dominating conversations with your troubles.
We recommend not disclosing any information about your BPD to new dating 
partners unless the relationship has lasted for a number of months and 
appears to be stable. See Chapter 18 for more information about dealing with 
close relationships.
 
BPD drives many people to expect and want relationships to become 
extremely close very quickly. We recommend proceeding slowly and with cau-
tion. Give the relationship time to develop and take your time before disclos-
ing your diagnosis.
Disclosing at work
Typically, you shouldn’t tell bosses and co-workers about your BPD. You 
simply can’t expect them to understand and hold sympathetic attitudes. 
Revealing details about your emotional problems may limit your opportuni-
ties for advancement or hinder your searches for a job.
 
People with BPD often have trouble trusting other people. However, they 
sometimes invest far more trust in others than their relationships warrant. 
Generally speaking, we recommend not trusting co-workers and bosses with 
information about your condition.
On the other hand, if you need reasonable accommodations on your job that 
directly relate to your BPD, you may decide that the risk of disclosure is 
worth considering. You have the right to make your disclosure at any time — 
including after you’re on the job. However, disclosing such information won’t 
likely help you if you do so only after you’re about to be fired. We urge you 

157
 Chapter 13: Explaining BPD to Others
to talk with your therapist and/or a vocational counselor about these issues 
before talking to your boss or co-workers about your condition. Your thera-
pist or counselor will likely discuss the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
with you.
The ADA protects people with disabilities from discrimination by employers. 
The act protects people with both physical and mental disabilities. BPD falls 
under the ADA’s protection; however, the individual with BPD must be quali-
fied and able to do the job with reasonable accommodations.
Despite ADA, an employer can fire a person with a disability for the following 
three reasons:
 
✓ The termination doesn’t have anything to do with the disability.
 
✓ The disabled person threatens the safety or health of others.
 
✓ The employee doesn’t meet production standards or requirements of 
the job despite accommodations.
 
The courts have ruled that employers shouldn’t consider improper behavior 
to be part of a disability. Employers should also expect people with disabili-
ties to get along with their co-workers and to listen to their supervisors. This 
expectation is an area that some people with BPD have trouble understanding. 
Symptoms of BPD include unstable relationships, impulsivity, and emotional 
dysregulation, all of which often cause the very problems that get people fired 
from jobs.
 
If you feel that you’ve been discriminated against at work for your BPD, go to 
the U.S. Department of Labor’s Web site and search for the Office of Disability 
Employment Policy (www.dol.gov). This policy spells out what to do and 
whom to contact.
Revealing to professionals
What you disclose to primary healthcare providers, therapists, and attor-
neys is held in strict confidence. These professionals often need to know the 
details of your physical and mental states. Attorneys may not always require 
as much information, but if they’re working for you, an attitude of openness 
is a good idea.
Deciding What to Tell
If you choose to tell one or more people about your BPD, you then need to 
figure out exactly what you want to say. Of course, knowing what you’re talk-
ing about helps. Therefore, we suggest you learn as much as you can about 
BPD before you share information with others. Then you can decide what 
specific aspects of your problem you want to disclose.

158
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Educating yourself
Understanding the ins and outs of BPD is like tackling almost any other sub-
ject. This book makes a great start because it covers as much information 
about the disorder as any layperson likely wants to know.
However, we recommend you read additional books, too. Most people com-
prehend best when they read information from a variety of perspectives. The 
Internet is also a good source of information, but some sites are far superior 
to others. (See Appendix A for resources you can trust.) Knowing as much as 
you can about BPD helps you explain things more clearly to others (to deter-
mine whom to tell, see the “Deciding Whether and Whom to Tell” section ear-
lier in this chapter). Furthermore, you’ll find treatment easier to understand 
and benefit from when you have a thorough understanding of BPD.
Deciding how much to say
The amount of information you choose to disclose about your BPD depends 
on whom you’re talking to and why. Some explanations lay out the full story; 
however, most discussions are more limited. The following descriptions give 
you ideas about various levels of disclosure.
Giving a complete explanation
You probably want to make a complete disclosure to your therapist and your 
spouse or partner. On occasion, you may feel that giving a full explanation to 
an adult child or someone else who is very important to you is a good idea. 
For these people, you may want to share the following information:
 
✓ The symptoms of BPD (see Chapter 3)
 
✓ Which BPD symptoms you have
 
✓ The causes of BPD (see Chapter 4)
 
✓ What treatments are available and how effective they are (see 
Chapter 11)
 
✓ Information about the treatment you’re receiving
 
✓ Hints about living with someone with BPD (see Part V)
 
✓ An apology for how your BPD has affected the person you’re talking to
Apologies can be very helpful as part of a complete explanation. However, 
you need to keep in mind that apologies aren’t easy to give and they don’t 
always elicit sympathy and gratitude. Sometimes other people have been sit-
ting on a mound of resentment for years because of how you’ve treated them. 
Still, a heartfelt apology can be one of the best ways to improve a relation-
ship. Just remember that the healing process takes time.

159
 Chapter 13: Explaining BPD to Others
The following story about John and Emma illustrates how a father decides to 
make a fairly complete explanation about his BPD to his adult child. He tells 
her his diagnosis and a little about the causes, apologizes for his past behav-
ior, and gives her a pamphlet with more information in the hopes that she’ll 
read it.
Emma agrees to meet her dad, John, for coffee. Although she hasn’t seen 
him for a long time, she has mixed feelings. She’s both angry and sad. 
During her childhood, he was unreliable and unstable. He missed count-
less birthdays and special family events. He didn’t even show up for her 
college graduation last year. When he was in a good mood, her dad could 
be fun. She remembers the laughter and parties.
As Emma approaches the café, she notices her dad sitting alone at a 
table. He looks older than the last time she saw him and kind of sad. “Hey 
Dad,” Emma says. “How are you? Haven’t seen you for a long time.”
John looks up at his daughter and says, “Hi Em, it’s been about ten 
months. Too long. You look wonderful. Your mom told me about your 
new job. I’m so proud of you.”
“I didn’t even know you talked to Mom or, for that matter, cared what I 
was doing,” Emma says as she feels the familiar anger rising.
“Yes, even when I’m not around, I still keep in touch and ask about you. 
But, I want to talk to you about something today that’s pretty hard for 
me. Let me get you a cup of coffee. Do you want something to eat? I hope 
you have some time to spend with me,” John says.
“I’ve got a little time, Dad. I’ll have a cup of coffee,” she responds.
“Okay, what I want to tell you is that I was out of town for the past ten 
months getting treatment for my problems. The first thing I want to do 
is apologize for all the times I let you down. You know, when you were 
growing up, I was a pretty horrible dad. I was so focused on my own 
problems that I wasn’t there for you. I’m really sorry.”
“So I’m supposed to forget all the times you exploded and walked out? 
How about the vacations you never came on with us? Or, how about my 
birthdays you missed? I’m 23 years old, and you’re just now telling me 
you’re sorry? It feels kinda late.”
“I guess I deserve that. You’re right. I can’t make it up to you; I know that. 
I just want you to know that these last ten months have really opened 
my eyes to what I did and why I did it. I don’t expect you to understand 
really. I just want you to know that I am so, so sorry. And I want you to 
know what it was all about. You see, one thing I learned is that my prob-
lem is partly genetic, and it can run in families. I’m pretty sure you don’t 
have it, but you should be aware that your kids could have a little higher 
risk.”

160
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
“So, what are you trying to say? That you had some sort of disease that 
caused you to be a complete jerk?”
“You’re not making this easy for me, but I don’t blame you. My therapist 
told me this could be a little rough, and she was right,” John sighs and 
wipes a tear from his eye. “I have something that sounds a little awful. 
It’s called borderline personality disorder. It’s a condition that primar-
ily involves huge problems with controlling emotions. My mother had it, 
and I probably learned it from her in addition to inheriting the tendency. 
Funny thing, though, she managed to be a whole lot better grandmother 
to you than she was a mother for me. Again, I’m not trying to make 
excuses for my outrageous behavior. I brought a pamphlet on this disor-
der if you’d like to read it. I understand if you don’t. I know I rarely ever 
said this, but I do love you.”
Emma chokes up a bit and says, “I don’t even know what to say, Dad. I 
wish we could go back a few years and start over. I’ll look at this stuff and 
maybe we can talk another time. But give me a little time. This is hard for 
me, too.”
As you can see, John’s daughter responds with considerable caution. She has 
been very hurt over the years and fears getting close to her dad. However, 
she reluctantly agrees to read the information he’s given her.
 
BPD has probably been part of your life for a long time, and, for that reason, 
the effect on others is likely significant. Give the people you decide to tell 
about your diagnosis time to hear your apologies. Accompanying your apolo-
gies with improved ways of relating to them will likely speed the healing.
Telling part of the story
If you choose to reveal something about your BPD to people other than your 
therapist or those very close to you, you probably want to limit the discus-
sion. We suggest that you focus on one or two key aspects of your behav-
ior or BPD that seem important to convey to the person you’re talking to. 
Limiting your discussion likely means that you avoid revealing the diagnosis 
because BPD carries a stigma for too many people. Even the term personality 
disorder is readily misunderstood and sounds more ominous to other people 
than it is. Thus, you probably won’t go through your entire list of symptoms 
when you’re telling only part of your story.
Instead, you may choose to focus on your difficulty with emotional regulation 
(in other words, managing your feelings). Perhaps you want to mention that 
you’ve been getting some professional help for your difficulty. Again, make 
sure you have a clear handle on why you’re choosing to discuss the issue.
An example of a good reason why you may choose to tell someone who 
isn’t very close to you about your problems is because you’ve had some 
trouble at work and you want to provide a brief explanation to your boss. For 

161
 Chapter 13: Explaining BPD to Others
instance, maybe you’ve missed more work than you’d have liked to or you’ve 
blown up at some co-workers. You probably don’t want to tell your boss that 
you have BPD, but explaining that you’re getting help for handling intense 
emotions may help you keep your job.
Sophie and Adam’s story shows you how someone may decide to make a 
partial disclosure. Sophie has dated Adam for about six weeks and likes him a 
lot, but she realizes she should focus on treating her BPD before getting seri-
ous with someone. Because she hasn’t been with him a long time and they 
haven’t gotten that serious, she decides to reveal only a couple of details 
about her BPD.
Adam pulls up to the emergency entrance of the hospital. A nurse walks 
Sophie, Adam’s girlfriend, out and helps her into the car. “Let me take 
you home,” Adam says when the door closes, “I’m so sorry that I didn’t 
call you last week. You know how much I love you. I want us to work out. 
I was so scared when you called me. Why did you do it? Why did you cut 
yourself?”
Sophie glances at Adam. She knows he cares about her and wants her 
to be stable. She realizes how frightened he was when she called him, 
drugged and cutting herself. But, she’s had a number of long talks with 
her doctor, and they both finally agreed that she’s not ready for a rela-
tionship. She must work on her own issues first. “Adam, thanks for 
coming to get me,” she starts, “I really care about you. But, I need to tell 
you that I have some problems.”
“Everyone has problems, Sophie. I can help you. We’ll work on this 
together,” Adam offers.
“Adam, I have a lot of trouble staying calm. I need to stay focused on get-
ting myself together. This has nothing to do with you. I’ve been this way 
for a long time, and I’m just beginning to understand it myself. So, I’d like 
you to drop me off at my house and stop calling me for awhile. I need 
some space.”
“Wow, space. I’ve heard that one before. So I guess this is the end of us,” 
Adam responds.
“Maybe not, Adam. I’ll call you in a few months if I’m doing better. I’m so 
sorry,” Sophie grasps her hands together. “This is pretty tough for me.”
“Right,” Adam stares ahead as he pulls up her drive. “See you around.”
Sophie had no compelling reason to tell Adam more about herself and her 
disorder. Doing so would only risk his telling others about her problems. He 
knows a lot of her friends and colleagues at work, and he may be tempted to 
tell them because he feels hurt over the breakup.

Part III: Treatments for BPD 
Telling Your Story Effectively
Perhaps you’ve made the decision to tell someone about your BPD, and 
you’ve decided what you want to tell that person. We recommend that you 
ponder how you want to tell your story. Consider the following suggestions:
 
✓ Choose a private place to talk.
 
✓ Allow enough time for your talk. 
 
✓ Don’t use jargon you learned in therapy.
 
✓ Consider talking during a mildly distracting activity, such as walking, 
driving, or hiking, to help keep your emotions in check.
 
✓ Practice the talk in your mind or with your therapist. Go over both best- 
and worst-case scenarios.
 
✓ If you become too emotional, step back. Consider telling the person that 
you want to talk more but that you need to take a break.
 
✓ If the other person reacts with anger, stop and perhaps try again later.
 
Talking to others about BPD can be challenging. You don’t have to tell every-
one everything — and certainly not all at once. Try to be prepared for any 
reaction you may get. If things get too emotional, stop for the time being and 
try to resume the talk later.

Chapter 14
Taking Care of Yourself
In This Chapter
▶ Decreasing stress in a stressful world
▶ Working hard to maintain physical health
▶ Keeping track of where your day goes
W
hen you feel stressed, depressed, angry, or anxious, your body 
responds accordingly because the mind and body are so closely 
related. Unfortunately, when people with BPD have primarily negative emo-
tions, their bodies experience primarily negative effects as a result.
In this chapter, we take a look at the effects of emotional stress on the body. 
New research comes out all the time showing how the environment, the 
mind, and the body interact. We also give you some ideas on how to stay 
healthy — both in your mind and in your body.
Dealing with Stress
People with BPD typically report feeling considerable stress the majority of 
the time. The body reacts strongly to this stress in a myriad of ways. The 
purpose behind these strong reactions is to help you deal with threats. For 
instance, intense bodily responses to danger proved extremely helpful when 
ancient people had to deal with direct threats to their lives, such as tigers 
and bears, every day. Fortunately, in the modern world, you don’t have to 
encounter many life-threatening events (like wild animal attacks) on a daily 
basis. Although the intense threat is gone, the human body still responds 
to feelings of stress in the same way. This section takes a look at how your 
mind’s stress affects your body’s health.
Reviewing how stress affects health
You may be wondering what the body’s responses to stress entail and how 
they affect your overall physical health. Do they cause any serious conse-
quences? Do they affect your ability to deal with stress in the future?

164
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
At the first hint of stress, your body gets ready to either stand and fight 
or run like the dickens. First, your nervous system goes on high alert by 
releasing stress hormones. These hormones cause your heart to race, your 
breathing to quicken, and oxygen to pour into the large muscles of your arms 
and legs. Pupils dilate, digestion slows, and you begin to sweat. All these 
responses prepare your body for battle. For example, when someone unex-
pectedly cuts you off in traffic, your body instantly responds with a surge 
of adrenaline to help you react quickly to avoid a crash. When these stress 
responses occur on a frequent, chronic basis, they damage the body in more 
ways than one. Such damage includes
 
✓ Fatigue
 
✓ Gastrointestinal problems
 
✓ Heart disease
 
✓ High blood pressure
 
✓ Impaired immune system
 
✓ Muscle tension leading to severe pain:
 
• Back pain
 
• Headaches
 
• Neck pain
 
✓ Sexual problems
 
✓ Weight gain or loss
As physical damage to your body accumulates, your ability to deal with 
stress decreases further because the mind and body work in concert; impair-
ment to one system harms the other. People with BPD often experience 
health effects from their chronic levels of stress. Chapter 16 provides you 
with specific strategies for quelling emotional storms when they hit. Here we 
tell you how to do everything possible to keep your body healthy and reduce 
the overall stress levels in your life.
Managing and reducing stress
One of the best ways to manage stress is to reduce the amount of stress you 
encounter in your daily life. You can accomplish this goal by decluttering 
your life.
Clutter and disarray usually make people feel out of control. Our office, for 
example, has a way of making us feel frazzled and frenzied when the piles on 
our desks reach a certain height. People with BPD tend to overreact to stress-
ful events of all kinds, including clutter. They may go beyond frazzled and 
react with rage or overwhelming despair.

165
 Chapter 14: Taking Care of Yourself
If such dishevelment stirs up your emotions, we recommend that you commit 
yourself to managing the mess — no matter how big it has become. Start by 
making a simple goal, such as
 
✓ Toss out three pieces of paper each day.
 
✓ Spend five minutes a day tossing out junk.
 
✓ Spend five minutes a day rearranging your closets.
 
✓ Try to take one bag of clothes to a charity each week or month.
You can use one or more of the following rules of thumb to help you get 
started:
 
✓ Toss out clothes you haven’t worn in a year or more unless you have 
a compelling reason to keep a particular item (such as sentiment or an 
unusually infrequent need to wear certain clothes for a wedding or other 
dressy occasion).
 
✓ Newspapers and magazines are valuable to recycle, so recycle them; you 
don’t benefit from keeping them.
 
✓ Old books have more value for other people than they do for your book-
shelf.
 
Decisions are much harder to make when you’re feeling emotional and over-
whelmed, so try to declutter and reorganize when you feel calm (see Chapter 
16 for ideas on how to calm your emotions). Also, break the overarching tasks 
down into smaller pieces so that each piece is easier for you to manage.
After you’ve made a little progress in the tossing department, consider orga-
nizing the items you want to keep. Make a master list of categories; then plan 
where you want to store items from a given category.
Taking Better Care of Your Body
A healthy body is resilient to stress and, thus, makes you feel better emotion-
ally, as well as physically. In the next sections, we explain how you can work 
on several major approaches to improving your body’s health and various 
ways to maintain it.
 
Sometimes people with BPD feel so overwhelmed with life in general that the 
idea of doing anything besides just living seems to be out of reach. If you feel 
like this, consider reading the following sections, but don’t implement the sug-
gestions into your life until you’re ready. You may want to read Part IV about 
different ways to treat BPD before you begin any of the tasks that follow.

166
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Revising your diet
Good nutrition lays the foundation for good physical health. However, if 
you faithfully read all the current books and articles about nutrition and try 
to follow every piece of advice you run into, you may cause yourself more 
stress than you had before you started because nutritional advice changes 
almost as often as the weather. One day you may read that you have to avoid 
carbohydrates like the plague because they seemingly lead people to gain 
weight. The very next day, you may read that carbohydrates help you lose 
weight. Trying to keep up with research on nutrition is like trying to track the 
pea in a carnival shell game.
However, a few nutritional tips are likely to stand the test of time. We recom-
mend that you adhere to the following general ideas about eating instead of 
worrying about the latest nutritional trends:
 
✓ Eat unprocessed foods. Food processing does too much of your diges-
tive system’s work, and, as a result, your body absorbs sugars more rap-
idly than is good for you. Try to eat whole fruits, grains, and vegetables, 
and avoid processed foods like cookies, chips, and white bread and 
pastas as much as you can.
 
✓ Reduce fat. Most people eat more fat than they should. Of course, you 
need some fat in your diet to sustain good health, and a little fat also 
slows your body’s absorption of sugar. However, you want to avoid 
hydrogenated oils, trans fats, and saturated fats as much as possible 
because they raise your bad cholesterol levels. Check labels to know 
which foods are high in these dangerous fats.
 
✓ Control protein. Generally, you need to eat a little protein with most 
meals because it keeps muscles healthy. Beans are an especially good 
source of protein because they also contain fiber, are low in fat, and are 
absorbed slowly.
 
✓ Find fiber. Fiber keeps your intestinal system clean. It also slows down 
the absorption of sugars which helps prevent unhealthy spikes in insu-
lin levels. Most people don’t get enough fiber. Look for fiber in oatmeal, 
whole grains, beans, and vegetables. Aim to ingest 25 to 30 grams of 
fiber per day.
Finally, try not to use eating as a stress management technique. Instead, turn 
to Chapter 16 for numerous ideas on how to calm yourself during times of 
upheaval. Eating may do the trick, too, but only in the short run. In the long 
run, overeating causes weight gain and self-recrimination, not overall calm-
ness or high self-esteem.

167
 Chapter 14: Taking Care of Yourself
Energizing with exercise
Another great way to manage stress is to exercise. The benefits of exercise 
are well known in today’s world — it lowers the risks of heart disease, high 
blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and obesity, and it leads to better 
memory for older adults (which is incentive enough for us!). Exercise also 
decreases depression, a symptom that frequently accompanies BPD. In addi-
tion, exercise is a quick way to burn off excess stress and, thus, often leads to 
better moods. The two categories of exercise are
 
✓ Aerobic: Aerobic exercise involves getting your heart beating and your 
blood flowing fast. Recent guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services advise all healthy adults to participate in 21/2 hours 
of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of intense aerobic activity a 
week (each episode of exercise being at least 10 minutes long).
 
✓ Anaerobic: Anaerobic exercise consists of muscle strengthening activi-
ties. The Department of Health and Human Services guidelines also sug-
gest that healthy adults should participate in anaerobic activities that 
use all muscle groups at least twice a week, though they don’t specify 
the length of time.
 
For more ideas about exercising, see Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by 
Suzanne Schlosberg (Wiley), Workouts For Dummies by Tamilee Webb and Lori 
Seeger (Wiley), and the many For Dummies exercise DVDs that cover every-
thing from basic yoga to workouts with a fitness ball.
Getting enough sleep
Sleep is another important part of any plan for managing stress. Generally, 
people need about 7 or 8 hours of sleep to be maximally healthy. Sleep allows 
the body’s cells to repair and helps with memory and concentration. Many 
emotional disorders, including BPD, disrupt sleep — sometimes causing an 
excess and often causing a lack of sleep.
Most people suffer from occasional bouts of sleeplessness or interrupted 
sleep. However, if you’re constantly having trouble falling asleep and staying 
asleep, see your primary care provider. Insomnia may result from a physical 
malady or a medication you’re taking.
 
Take a list of all your prescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well as 
dietary supplements or vitamins, with you when you go see your doctor.
We suggest that you try to manage your sleep problems without taking sleep-
ing pills because they can be addictive. Try out some simple techniques to 
help you sleep before you resort to medication.

168
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
The first rule of thumb for getting good sleep is having a routine. Go to bed 
and get up at about the same time every day. You should spend the last few 
hours of your evening winding down. During the time before you go to bed,
 
✓ Take a warm bath.
 
✓ Listen to music.
 
✓ Read a book.
 
✓ Watch TV.
 
✓ Have a small snack.
 
✓ Drink warm milk.
 
✓ Don’t drink too much alcohol (you may fall asleep, but you’ll also wake 
up early).
 
✓ Don’t drink too much of anything (unless you like to get up in the middle 
of the night).
 
✓ Don’t drink anything with caffeine (if caffeine keeps you awake); try 
decaffeinated tea when you want something warm.
 
✓ Don’t engage in arguments.
 
✓ Don’t smoke cigarettes before bed.
Make sure that you have comfortable sheets and pillows. To maximize your 
sleeping ability, try to sleep in a room that’s cool, dark, and well ventilated.
During the day, avoid naps and be sure to get some exercise (see the 
“Energizing with exercise” section earlier in this chapter for ideas about 
exercise).
Taking healthy actions
Many people with BPD struggle to take adequate care of themselves because 
they feel overwhelmed by stress and life and often don’t feel like they have 
the energy to devote to their health. And staying healthy does require an 
active approach. But, it doesn’t take a whole lot of time. You just need to use 
a little common sense and take a few precautions. Try to incorporate the fol-
lowing good habits into your life to help improve and maintain your health:
 
✓ Wash your hands often, especially during cold season. Just be sure not 
to take this advice to the extremes. See our book, Obsessive-Compulsive 
Disorder For Dummies (Wiley), for information about what happens 
when people gravely fear germs and contamination.
 
✓ Use sunscreen. Try not to let yourself get a sunburn, and limit your 
direct exposure to the sun. Excessive sun exposure may lead to wrin-
kles, but skin cancer poses a much more serious risk.

169
 Chapter 14: Taking Care of Yourself
 
✓ Protect your ears from excessively loud noises. Over time, subjecting 
your ears to extremely loud noises can ruin your hearing.
 
✓ Take short, frequent breaks at work (as many and as often as you’re 
allowed). Ideally, get up and walk around a bit every hour or so.
 
✓ Know the signs of a stroke or heart attack. We don’t want to scare you, 
but knowing these signs can save your life (or someone else’s).
 
✓ Floss your teeth daily. Spending a few minutes flossing each day not 
only improves and maintains the health of your teeth and gums, but it 
may also reduce infections that can contribute to heart disease.
 
✓ Listen to a radio health show or podcast regularly. You can learn many 
interesting, healthy ways of living by listening to other people.
 
✓ Read the labels on food. You may be shocked to see how much sugar 
and fat some food contains. Reading the labels can help you make better 
eating decisions.
 
✓ Stay current with your vaccinations. Your doctor can tell you which 
ones to get and when to get them.
 
✓ Have your blood tested yearly for a range of numbers, including cho-
lesterol, liver and kidney function, and any other tests your doctor 
recommends. Talk the results over with your doctor.
 
✓ Always use a seatbelt. Not only does wearing a seatbelt keep you safe 
when you’re driving, but it’s also the law in many places.
Incorporating these actions into your daily life doesn’t guarantee perfect 
health, but doing so can help. Furthermore, following these simple tips can 
help you feel like you’re taking care of yourself, which is likely to improve 
your mood and sense of control over life (both typical concerns of people 
with BPD).
Finding More Time for Yourself
Improving and recovering from BPD takes time. Time is often in short supply 
for everyone, not just people with BPD. The first step in finding more time 
for yourself involves keeping track of what you do every day. For a couple 
of days, or better yet weeks, try to jot down start and stop times for all your 
activities. You don’t have to write essays or be too specific. Just keeping 
track of how you spend your days can help you determine whether you need 
to spend more or less time doing certain activities, such as exercising, read-
ing, reflecting, and so on. For the technologically gifted, use a cell phone or 
other electronic device to record activities. Be truthful in your records. For 
example, if you’re trying to write a book and every time you sit in front of 
your computer, you spend 75 percent of your time on Twitter and Google, 
don’t record, “Writing book, 4 hours.”

170
Part III: Making the Choice to Change 
Information is a powerful tool. Take a look at the time you waste on activities 
that don’t help you get where you want to be. After a few days or weeks of 
recording your daily activities, take some time to reflect on your data. Think 
about ways in which you can change your activities to be more effective in 
achieving your goals. Or, plan a meeting with a therapist to discuss some of 
the changes you may want to make and how to go about making them.
With some effort, you may discover as many as three, four, or maybe even more 
hours each week that you didn’t know you had. You can use this time — the 
time you once frittered away — on more productive activities. Doing so can 
help make you feel better about yourself.

Inhibiting Impulsivity

mpulses are all about feeling an immediate need to get what you want. 
Throughout life, many people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) 
listen to other people tell them that what they want or think they need isn’t 
appropriate — that somehow their needs are wrong.
However, that’s not true at all. For the most part, people with BPD want the 
same things that other people do. They want to be happy; they want people to 
care about them; they want to get rid of bad feelings; they want to experience 
pleasure. People with BPD generally don’t have inappropriate desires, but they 
do typically want to meet their desires completely and immediately — which 
leads them down a primrose path that often ends in calamity.
As you probably already know, an impulse is a desire, urge, or want, and 
impulsivity describes one way in which people act on impulses. For example, 
imagine that you stroll into a jewelry store and have an impulse to own a 
beautiful diamond brooch. If you choose to smash the glass case, grab the 
brooch, and run, you’re experiencing impulsivity. In Chapters 3 and 5, we 
discuss impulsivity, a common symptom of BPD. People who are impulsive 
don’t take time to think about their actions before they do them, which often 
leads to all sorts of trouble.
In this chapter, we show you how to increase your awareness of your own 
impulsivity and the consequences you experience as a result of your impul-
sive actions. Armed with this awareness, you can step back from your impul-
sivity and reflect on all your options. We give you tools to help you put the 
brakes on your impulsivity. Finally, we suggest some healthier ways to meet 
your needs.

174
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Increasing Your Awareness 
of Impulsive Behavior
Before you can change something in your life, you first have to be aware that 
it exists. When people with BPD act impulsively, they often report very little 
awareness of several critical aspects of their impulsive behavior, including
 
✓ What they did
 
✓ How they felt
 
✓ What their goals were
 
✓ What triggered their impulsivity in the first place
Instead, they report that they have only vague memories of what they did, 
their feelings at the time, what they wanted to happen, and what led to their 
behavior. They rarely reflect on these issues and don’t ponder whether they 
met their goals because they usually don’t remember what their goals were.
Change begins with monitoring all the aspects of impulsivity that you experi-
ence. Awareness alone helps you start putting the brakes on your impulsive 
behaviors.
 
We recommend that you read Chapter 5 to understand the full range of impul-
sive behaviors that people with BPD often engage in. Reading about what 
others do may help you identify which problems with impulsivity you have. 
After you recognize which impulsive behaviors you exhibit, you can start to 
change them.
Write down your impulsive acts
Writing about your impulsivity can help you organize your thoughts and feel-
ings in preparation for change. You can use the blank Impulsive Awareness 
Form that appears in Appendix B as you work through the steps in this sec-
tion. The directions for this form follow.
 
Some of the steps in self-monitoring that we describe next may feel difficult if 
not impossible for you to do right now. That’s okay. Try to do the parts you 
think you can do. Over time, you can probably go through more and more 
steps. Also, as with most exercises in this book, you’re likely to get more out 
of them by doing them, or at least discussing them, with a mental health pro-
fessional.
The following steps can help you monitor — and, thus, increase your aware-
ness of — your own impulsivity:

175
 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
 
1. Describe each time you act impulsively, without thinking.
 
 Some examples of common impulsive behaviors include self-harm, 
spending sprees, gambling, shoplifting, binge eating, reckless driving, 
reckless sex, and substance abuse. Impulsive behaviors can involve 
almost anything you do without thinking, especially actions that can 
result in direct or indirect harm to you or someone else. In your descrip-
tion, include details about what you did.
 
2. Recount where you were and what you were doing before you acted 
impulsively.
 
 Were you at work, with a boyfriend, at a party, in a bar, or sitting at 
home watching television when you had your impulsive urge? This infor-
mation can help you see what situations trigger your impulsive behavior.
 
3. Explain how you felt — before you acted impulsively.
 
 Common feelings before exhibiting impulsive behaviors include the fol-
lowing:
 
• Bored
 
• Anxious
 
• Jealous
 
• Envious
 
• Needy
 
• Afraid
 
• Angry
 
• Vulnerable
 
• Upset
 
• Sad
• Excited
• Sexy
• Critical
• Ashamed
• Guilty
• Numb
• Unreal
• Disconnected
• Resentful
 
4. Write down what you thought or hoped would happen as a result of 
your impulsive behavior.
 
 For example, you may have thought you would feel less bored, more 
connected, or more real. You may have thought you would feel more in 
control of a social interaction, less jealous, or less angry. Ask yourself 
what possible goals you wanted to accomplish through your impulsive 
behavior.
 
5. Express how you felt after the impulsive behavior. Did you achieve 
your goals?
 
 You may find that although you experience a momentary high or rush 
during your impulsive action, your feelings quickly return to neutral or 
get worse after you complete the action. Common feelings after impul-
sive actions include guilt, shame, remorse, regret, self-loathing, and a 
sense of isolation. Whatever feelings and outcomes you experience, jot 
them down.

Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
A case study using Impulsivity 
Awareness Forms
Destiny, a young, married woman with BPD, struggles with impulsivity. The 
following story takes a look at her experience with impulsivity and depicts 
several typical impulsive acts and their associated triggers, feelings, and 
outcomes. At her therapist’s suggestion, she fills out several Impulsivity 
Awareness Forms on the incidents.
Destiny and her husband, Scott, live in a large home nestled in the moun-
tains overlooking Tucson, Arizona. The surrounding community knows 
well their catered parties with great local entertainment and plenty of 
alcoholic beverages. The morning after their parties, a few of the guests 
usually find themselves asleep in guest rooms, on couches, and even 
sprawled out in sleeping bags. Scott, a retired military officer, likes his 
guests to have fun but doesn’t let them drink and drive.
Destiny has settled down some since her wild years. She likes having a 
husband even though he’s a lot older than she is. She likes not having to 
worry about money and enjoys the attention Scott lavishes on her.
Tonight they’re having their annual summer party. Destiny applies the 
finishing touches to her makeup and asks Scott to latch her new neck-
lace. “Wow,” Scott looks at her appreciatively, “you look really hot. The 
guys won’t be able to take their eyes off you. Do you think that dress may 
be a little low cut?”
Destiny gives him a full body hug and says, “It’s all for you, babe.” She 
can’t help but feel excited at the idea of men fawning over her. She hasn’t 
had an affair in over a year and yearns for both the danger and the thrill. 
After all, she’s been feeling a little bored lately.
After the party’s underway, Destiny notices Stephen, an old friend, 
standing with a woman she doesn’t recognize. Although she never had a 
relationship with Stephen, she immediately feels jealous because they’re 
obviously close to each other. She feels an urgent desire to capture 
Stephen’s attention. She strolls over to Stephen and kisses him on the 
cheek, pressing her breasts into his chest. The kiss lasts a bit too long.
“Who’s this?” Destiny asks Stephen, pointing to his guest. “She looks a 
little bookish to me.”
“This is Stacy, my new girlfriend,” he responds.
Destiny says, “Hi Stacy, I need to talk to Stephen for a moment. It’s per-
sonal. You’re not the jealous type, are you?”
Stacy stammers, “Uh, no. That’s fine, of course. I see someone I know 
across the room.”
After she’s alone with Stephen, Destiny says, “How about you lose her 
and we go upstairs for awhile? My husband is busy and drunk; he won’t 
notice. And your Stacy looks boring anyway.”

177
 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
Stephen, looking shocked, says, “Destiny, no. You’re an attractive woman, 
but I can’t do something like that. What’s gotten into you? You’re mar-
ried. I went to your wedding.”
Destiny, now furious, storms into the kitchen and starts drinking Scotch. 
After tossing down a tumbler full of the whisky, she looks for another 
male target. The first guy she finds is as drunk as she is and readily 
accepts her invitation for a quick encounter upstairs. Afterward, she feels 
horrible and retreats to her own bathroom. Crying, she sits on the edge 
of the tub and slices her thighs with a razor blade.
Destiny has an appointment with her therapist two days later. She feels hor-
rible and ashamed. Her therapist suggests that she fill out four separate 
Impulsive Awareness Forms to help them identify and study her impulsive 
behaviors. Table 15-1 shows what they come up with on the first form.
Table 15-1 
Destiny’s Impulsive Awareness Form: Seduction
1. Describe each time you act impulsively, without thinking.
I tried to seduce an old friend. I just went right up to him and his girlfriend and took 
him away.
2. Recount where you were and what you were doing before you acted impulsively.
I was at home. I had a drink or two before the guests started arriving at the party. 
Parties always make me feel excited.
3. Explain how you felt — before you acted impulsively.
I was feeling bored before the party. But then I felt jealous when Stephen came in 
with a new girlfriend.
4. Write down what you thought or hoped would happen as a result of your impul-
sive behavior.
I thought seducing a guy would make me feel alive again and relieve some of the 
boredom I’d been feeling lately.
5. Express how you felt after the impulsive behavior. Did you achieve your goals?
I was angry. I couldn’t believe he turned me down. He ticked me off so much that I 
started drinking. So, no, I guess I didn’t achieve my goals.
From this first form, Destiny discovers that parties, boredom, and even 
a little alcohol can all trigger her impulsive behavior. She also sees that 
she didn’t feel better afterward; in fact, she felt angry. Her next Impulsive 
Awareness Form, shown in Table 15-2, helps her understand her impulsivity 
even more.

Table 15-2 
Destiny’s Impulsive Awareness Form: Drinking
1. Describe each time you act impulsively, without thinking.
I started downing Scotch straight up.
2. Recount where you were and what you were doing before you acted impulsively.
I was rejected by someone in my own house. I was surrounded by a party atmo-
sphere and a lot of alcohol.
3. Explain how you felt — before you acted impulsively.
I was totally ticked off and angry. I also felt hurt.
4. Write down what you thought or hoped would happen as a result of your impul-
sive behavior.
I just thought some Scotch would make me feel better — less angry and hurt. I didn’t 
have any other goals.
5. Express how you felt after the impulsive behavior. Did you achieve your goals?
The drinking made me want to have sex even more. After I had enough Scotch, I 
threw myself at someone I knew I could snare. In that respect, I think drinking did 
help me achieve my goals — I got laid.
Destiny and her therapist talk about how impulsive drinking leads to even 
more impulsive behavior. Destiny initially felt that the drinking helped her 
achieve her goals, and, in actuality, it did for a short while. But, drinking 
also led to a much darker outcome — sex with a virtual stranger. Table 15-3 
shows what she discovers about her next impulsive action.
Table 15-3 
Destiny’s Impulsive Awareness Form: Sex
1. Describe each time you act impulsively, without thinking.
I threw myself at a guy and had sex with him. I don’t even remember his name.
2. Recount where you were and what you were doing before you acted impulsively.
I was in the kitchen drinking like a fish. Then I dragged that guy upstairs and had sex 
with him.
3. Explain how you felt — before you acted impulsively.
I felt drunk. I could barely stand up. Scotch and sex felt good, though.
4. Write down what you thought or hoped would happen as a result of your impul-
sive behavior.
I hoped it would take away my feelings of rejection, hurt, and anger.

 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
5. Express how you felt after the impulsive behavior. Did you achieve your goals?
I felt horrible and disgusted with myself. I felt like a total slut, completely ashamed. I 
also felt guilty about what I did to my husband. I can’t believe he didn’t find out, but 
he could next time. I didn’t get anything out of the experience. I don’t even remember 
what the sex was like.
Destiny sobs as she goes over her third form with her therapist. She can see 
that her momentary impulses lead her to feel worse about herself and that, 
in the long run, they don’t help her get anything she wants. For the first time, 
she confesses to her therapist that she cuts herself when she feels shame. 
See Table 15-4 for Destiny’s final Impulsive Awareness Form.
Table 15-4 
Destiny’s Impulsive Awareness Form: Cutting
1. Describe each time you act impulsively, without thinking.
I cut my thighs with a razor blade again.
2. Recount where you were and what you were doing before you acted impulsively.
I was in bed having sex with a man I’d never even met before.
3. Explain how you felt — before you acted impulsively.
I felt horribly ashamed of myself. I felt nauseous and guilty. I was worried my hus-
band would catch me. It was horrible.
4. Write down what you thought or hoped would happen as a result of your impul-
sive behavior.
I wanted to punish myself. I thought I’d feel better if I did that.
5. Express how you felt after the impulsive behavior. Did you achieve your goals?
After I cut myself, I did calm down some. However, now I feel such shame over all 
the scars I have. Hurting myself certainly isn’t getting me what I want.
Destiny’s evening went from bad to worse — thanks to her long string of 
impulsive behaviors. Some very short-term benefits, such as brief relief from 
upsetting feelings, may occur as a result of impulsive behavior, but the gains 
are fleeting and usually just lead to more impulsive behavior.

Putting the Brakes on Impulsivity
People with BPD who experience the symptom of impulsivity find themselves 
getting into trouble. This trouble can range from having minor arguments 
with partners to ending up handcuffed in the back of a police car. Thus, for 
many people with BPD, part of their recovery must focus on slowing down 
their impulsivity. In this section, we offer the following four strategies to help 
you or someone you love control impulses:
 
✓ Putting time on your side
 
✓ Putting your impulses off
 
✓ Doing something different
 
✓ Fire drilling
Impulsivity starts in the brain
Think of your brain as being a system of many 
interconnected areas. To effectively plan ahead 
and prevent impulsivity, your brain has to put 
the brakes on all these areas so that you don’t 
act before you think. For example, one area in 
your brain keeps track of memories of the past. 
Another area of your brain deals with thoughts 
about the future, and another area processes 
what’s going on in the present moment. Finally, 
a fourth area considers and integrates the impli-
cations of the past, present, and future — and 
then makes a decision. Managing all these 
areas is a difficult task for many people to 
handle, not just folks with BPD.
For example, a small, turtle-paced town outside 
of Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Corrales, 
contains only one long road that winds through 
the centuries-old business district. Galleries, 
antique stores, restaurants, and professional 
offices fill the town. Small streets (some dirt, 
some paved) intersect the main street and take 
residents to their homes. On these side streets, 
the speed limit ranges from 15 mph (miles per 
hour) to a brisk 25 mph. Numerous dedicated 
police officers in patrol cars park under and 
behind huge cottonwood trees along the small 
streets. The crime rate is fairly low in Corrales, 
so these officers monitor car speeds to pass the 
time. As a result, most residents have learned to 
drive slowly and enjoy the sunshine.
You may wonder what this small town has to do 
with impulsivity. Well, people in Corrales usually 
think about past tickets and their repercussions, 
ponder the future effects of increased car insur-
ance rates, notice the abundance of police cars 
as they drive, and adjust accordingly. However, 
from time to time, some nonresidents, as well as 
a few impulsive residents, can’t resist the urge 
to zip along the little winding roads. They aren’t 
stupid; their brains simply don’t put the brakes 
on their actions by reflecting on the past, pres-
ent, and future implications of speeding.

181
 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
Putting time on your side
People with BPD who act impulsively often regret their actions — eventually. 
Affairs, substance abuse, self-harm, and other risky behaviors usually have 
negative outcomes. But remorse comes the morning after, or at times, even 
later.
The following strategy takes advantage of these feelings of regret by bringing 
them to the surface before the impulsive action takes place. If you figure out 
how to slow down and consider the consequences of your impulsivity, you 
won’t find yourself sliding down the slippery slope as often. We start by pro-
viding the instructions for how to use your regret to help manage your impul-
sivity, and then we give you a real-life example to clarify the technique.
Taking a moment to ask yourself some questions before you act is one way to 
help you bridle your emotional impulses. Write out the following questions 
on a piece of paper or small calendar, or input them into your cellphone or 
personal digital assistant (PDA). When you have a strong desire to engage in 
impulsive behavior, take a minute to look at these questions and think about 
your responses:
 
✓ How important is doing this action to me?
 
✓ If I go ahead and do this action now, how will I feel about it tomorrow?
 
✓ What are the long-term consequences if I continue this action?
 
✓ How will I feel tomorrow if I don’t carry out this impulse right now?
This question-response strategy isn’t always easy to implement. Obviously, 
impulsivity involves acting without thinking — and, not surprisingly, these 
questions require thinking. If you take the time to think before you act, many 
times you won’t do something that can lead to long-term trouble. However, 
don’t expect that the questions will just pop into your mind — we encourage 
you to write them down for a reason. If you have a habit of impulsivity, you 
need time and effort to break this habit.
The following story about Justin illustrates how asking these four questions 
helps him consider the consequences of his impulsive behavior. He isn’t 
quite ready to commit to never smoking marijuana again, but the strategy 
plants the seed in his mind.
Justin, a young adult with BPD, abuses marijuana. He often smokes in his 
garage after work. He is a licensed electrician and makes good money. He 
has a juvenile record for drug possession, but he’s never been caught as 
an adult. He believes the marijuana helps him stay calm and control his 
anger. His employer conducts random drug tests, and Justin knows that 

182
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
he can lose his job if he fails the drug test. He started therapy a couple of 
months ago after his boyfriend left him. His therapist suggests that he try 
answering some questions the next time he feels an urge to light up. The 
following answers are what he comes up with:
How important is doing this action to me?
Well, it feels important because it’s something I want to do, and I’m not 
sure what else to do to stay calm if I don’t smoke. But, I guess in terms of 
my life as a whole, it isn’t all that important.
If I go ahead and do this action now, how will I feel about it tomorrow?
I know the answer to this one. I try not to think about tomorrow, but I 
know that every time I smoke, I feel guilty and stupid for having spent the 
money and taken the risks.
What are the long-term consequences if I continue this action?
I can lose my electrician’s license in the blink of an eye. I can even go to 
jail. Ugh.
How will I feel tomorrow if I don’t carry out this impulse right now?
That’s an interesting question. I admit the few times I stopped myself, I 
felt pretty darn proud of myself. I didn’t actually feel more tense or angry 
without the marijuana.
As Justin discusses these responses with his therapist, he expresses 
some interest in quitting marijuana for the first time. He tells his therapist 
that he appreciates her for not telling him to quit smoking and, instead, 
helping him see the problems smoking can and does cause in his life. 
Later he says he’s interested in changing some of his other impulsive 
behaviors, too.
If you engage in impulsive behaviors, consider writing answers to these four 
questions about your own specific impulses. We aren’t trying to make you 
quit, but you may find that discussing your answers with a therapist makes 
you think twice about giving in to every impulse.
Putting off your impulses
You may feel that you’re not ready to stop your impulsive behaviors after 
trying the preceding strategy. Or, you may not be convinced that you can 
actually stop even if you do want to. No problem. We offer a second strategy 
for you to try out here.
This strategy involves experimenting with your impulsive behaviors. When 
you feel an urge to do something impulsive, such as shoplift or cut yourself, 
see what happens when you delay going through with the urge (see Chapter 
5 for a full list of impulsive behaviors). For example, if you have an urge to 

183
 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
drive recklessly, try to drive like everyone else for fifteen minutes first, and 
then see how you feel. Or, if you have an impulse to gamble, try waiting for 
a half hour or more before you go to a casino. Over time, lengthen these 
delays to an hour or even a day or two. Doing so can help you build up your 
ability to tolerate frustration and delay gratification — both of which are key 
elements of a healthy personality (see Chapter 2 for more on healthy versus 
unhealthy personalities). After some practice with delaying your impulses, 
you may discover that you don’t miss your impulsivity as much as you 
thought you would.
 
Just because we don’t tell you to stop engaging in potentially destructive 
behaviors immediately doesn’t mean we give you permission or encourage 
you to continue to do them. We simply recognize that some people aren’t 
ready or willing to stop these actions. In these cases, starting with delay tac-
tics often helps bring people to the realization that stopping their impulsive 
behaviors is within their reach.
Doing something different
When you feel a strong desire to do something without thinking, doing some-
thing completely different from what your impulse tells you to do can help 
quell the urge. The best way to use distraction as a strategy is to plan ahead. 
What are some activities you like to do that keep your mind focused? Taking 
part in these activities can help prevent you from doing the impulsive act.
Everyone has a different list of distracting activities they enjoy. Here are a 
few examples of activities that can help focus your attention away from the 
impulsive act:
 
✓ Going for a walk or jog
 
✓ Watching a movie
 
✓ Knitting or crocheting
 
✓ Making a collage of how you’re feeling (have some old magazines on 
hand)
 
✓ Going to the gym or exercising at home
 
✓ Reading a good novel
 
✓ Calling a friend
 
✓ Twittering or surfing the Internet
 
✓ Taking a hot bath
 
✓ Getting a massage at a spa
 
✓ Cleaning the house

184
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Take some time to think about what activities you find interesting and atten-
tion grabbing. Be sure to include some activities that you can do on the spur 
of a moment. The most important aspect of this technique is to plan ahead 
so that you’re ready with an alternative activity when your body tells you it’s 
ready for an impulsive behavior.
Fire drilling
Fire drilling is a technique you can use to handle the emotional spikes that 
precede impulsive behavior. These upticks in emotions aren’t always highly 
negative, and they’re not always extremely intense. For instance, when you’re 
experiencing boredom, you may impulsively seek excitement through sexual 
seduction, risky driving, or spending sprees. Other times, a positive event, 
such as receiving an unexpected bonus or a compliment from a friend, can 
trigger the desire for even more positive feelings and, in turn, can lead to the 
impulsive behaviors you think are necessary to obtain them.
 
If extremely powerful and negative emotional outbursts typically trigger your 
impulsivity, we suggest that you take a look at Chapter 16 for ideas on how to 
deal with explosive emotions. After doing so, you can return to this chapter to 
find out more about inhibiting your impulses.
Fire drilling consists of taking the following steps:
 
1. Make a list of coping self-statements that you can say to yourself 
instead of acting on your impulses (we discuss these statements in 
detail right after these steps).
 
2. Imagine situations that tend to trigger your impulses (see the 
“Increasing Your Awareness of Impulsive Behavior” section earlier 
in this chapter), and picture yourself using the coping self-statements 
rather than indulging in your impulses.
 
3. Replay these scenes in your mind over and over again.
 
4. Finish the scenes with some sort of self-congratulatory gesture, such as 
telling yourself what a great job you did.
So, what is a coping self-statement? Coping self-statements are what you say 
to yourself to help you deal with emotions like boredom, cravings for excite-
ment, or anxiety. Often these statements help remind you of the reasons you 
want to control your impulses rather than act on them. Here are a few exam-
ples of coping self-statements:
 
✓ I can always indulge in this impulse later, so why don’t I delay it for 
awhile first?
 
✓ I may not like these urges, but they do go down when I give them enough 
time.

185
 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
 
✓ I realize that my impulsiveness is hurting me; I just need to come up 
with a distraction (see the “Doing something different” section for some 
distracting activities).
 
✓ Each time I hold my impulses at bay, I am increasing my resolve and 
strength.
 
✓ I want to feel proud of my efforts instead of constantly feeling like I’ve 
messed up.
 
✓ Feelings don’t have to be acted on.
 
✓ What feels good in the short run often feels terrible over the long haul.
 
✓ Just because I want something doesn’t mean that I need it.
Go through this list and pick a coping self-statement or two that you think 
may help you increase your resolve. Or, make up one or more similar state-
ments that have more meaning for you. Consider writing these statements 
down in a notebook or computer file for easy reference. Make a point at least 
three or four times each day to practice imagining yourself in a situation 
that makes you want to be impulsive and that allows you to use one of your 
coping self-statements.
Refer to the “Increasing Your Awareness of Impulsive Behavior ” section 
earlier in this chapter to find out what situations trigger your impulsiveness. 
You can use those triggers in conjunction with the fire drilling technique to 
better prepare yourself to deal with your impulses.
 
When you imagine these triggering situations, make sure you also picture 
yourself using your coping self-statements over and over again. You may wish 
to use several of them at one time. Let your mind conjure up a scene of suc-
cess in which you inhibit your impulse with one of your statements. Then 
tell yourself what a terrific job you did. Repeated practice of such scenes will 
likely enhance your self-control in the long run.
Seeking Healthier Alternatives
Risky and impulsive behaviors are often attempts to satisfy a need for excite-
ment. That need, which psychologists call sensation seeking, is partly the 
result of a genetic predisposition. Some people are born with a strong desire 
for stimulation and thrills, while others prefer tamer and safer activities.
You may have heard the term adrenaline junky to describe a person with this 
tendency for excitement. People with BPD are much more likely than people 
without the disorder to exhibit this need for excitement, which is rooted in 
their genes and biology. So it makes sense that the impulsive behaviors most 
associated with BPD involve risk and sometimes danger.

186
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
If you experience this intense need for excitement, you may engage in activi-
ties that get you in trouble from time to time. You may also enjoy some of 
these activities so much that you don’t want to give them up. The thought of 
boredom is worse than the risk you take to pursue the activity. Well, we’re 
not asking you to lead a life of complete safety and dullness; we’re simply 
asking you to look for ways to achieve excitement that don’t involve risking 
your life or the lives of others.
Seeking healthier alternatives involves acknowledging the need for excite-
ment and finding activities that satisfy this need. These healthier alternatives 
are different from your impulsive behaviors because they won’t lead to jail 
time or trouble with others. These healthier sensation-seeking activities can 
involve playing on a softball team or hang gliding. Here are a few other exam-
ples of healthy alternatives to impulsive behavior:
 
✓ Rock climbing
 
✓ Bungee jumping
 
✓ Sky diving
 
✓ White-water rafting
 
✓ Scuba diving
 
✓ Backpacking
 
✓ Mountain bike riding
 
✓ Hot air ballooning
 
✓ Taking flying lessons
 
✓ Kayaking
 
✓ Skiing
✓ Rodeo riding
✓ Following high-rope courses
✓ Car racing
✓ Taking part in equestrian competitions
✓ Heli-skiing
✓ Mountain climbing
✓ Participating in extreme sports
✓ Skateboarding
✓ Competing in adult sports teams
✓ Adventure traveling
 
Some of these activities are indeed a bit dangerous. Approach them with as 
much care and training as possible. Indulge in such endeavors using common 
sense. Hopefully, these activities can provide you a healthier outlet for your 
need for sensation and stimulation. Oh yeah, and how about wearing a 
helmet, too?
Not all people who crave excitement need to compete in sports or perform 
difficult physical feats to attain the sensation they’re looking for. Some 
people find excitement in changing jobs or occupations, tackling a difficult 
project at home, playing competitive poker or bridge, debating politics with 
friends, watching the stock market go up and down, exploring unusual foods 

187
 Chapter 15: Inhibiting Impulsivity
and spices, completing advanced degrees, day trading on the stock exchange, 
or even writing For Dummies books (did we really say that?). The point is you 
can find stimulation in many activities that aren’t self-destructive.
 
Your sensation-seeking need isn’t all bad — if you temper your need, you can 
appreciate it as a quality that makes you interesting.

ook up and imagine a colorful kite flying in the sky on a windy day. Blue 
sky, a few wisps of clouds, everything is peaceful and quiet, but sud-
denly a wind gust captures the kite. The kite twists out of control and crashes 
to the ground. The emotional lives of people with borderline personality dis-
order (BPD) look much like kites. At times, they soar high, but like a kite, they 
easily spin out of control and crash.
In this chapter, we tell you how to identify emotions and explore some myths 
about what they mean. After all, acknowledging and labeling emotions is the 
first step in quelling them. We present a few specific techniques you can use 
to contain and quell emotional storms. As with the other strategies we give 
you in this book, we recommend that people with BPD work with a mental 
health professional to carry them out.
Putting a Name Tag on Feelings
Many people have trouble identifying and owning up to their feelings. 
However, not noticing your emotional state at every moment is perfectly 
normal. Most of the time you don’t actively think about how you feel unless 
you’re extremely sad, angry, fearful, or happy. For example, has anyone ever 
said to you, “Why are you in a bad mood today?” and you respond, “I’m not 
in a bad mood,” without really thinking?
Then a few minutes later, you realize you actually have been feeling irritable 
and a bit crabby (not that you’d admit it). Even so, your response wasn’t a 
lie or an attempt to hide your feelings. You automatically denied the feeling 
because you weren’t consciously aware of your bad mood.

190
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Understanding the thought-feeling 
connection
So what’s the big deal if you’re not thinking about what you’re feeling? Feelings 
are profound tools of communication — they keep people connected to each 
other, and this connection breeds life and love. Feelings provide motivation 
and advise caution. In essence, they tell us how to behave. For example,
 
✓ When people grieve, they tend to retreat.
 
✓ When people are afraid, they defend or run.
 
✓ When people are angry, they attack.
 
✓ When people are curious, they explore.
 
✓ When people are joyful, they celebrate.
Yet, although feelings do impact how you behave, they can also become over-
whelming and unhelpful when they aren’t balanced by your thoughts. Both 
thoughts and feelings should play a role in your behaviors because thoughts 
help modify feelings. When your feelings determine your actions without any 
input from your thoughts, your actions are unmodified by wisdom and may 
lead you into trouble.
Allison has BPD, but she has benefited greatly from a year of therapy. She 
has figured out how to identify her feelings and put a hold on her typical, 
reflexive tendency to let her feelings control her actions. The following story 
shows how Allison can now acknowledge her feelings without acting on them:
Walking home from a restaurant at night, Allison sees a group of loud 
teenagers standing on the corner smoking and laughing. Her immediate 
emotional reaction is fear. Last year someone broke into her house, and 
she felt extremely vulnerable and violated. But Allison decides that acting 
confident is a better way to get by the kids. So she calmly and quickly 
walks by them, not making eye contact. She doesn’t turn her head when 
one of the teens says something derogatory. Furious that she can’t walk 
a few blocks home from a restaurant without being harassed, she really 
wants to turn around and yell at the teens. Even though she feels intense 
anger, she chooses to keep walking. Instead of letting her emotions 
control her, she uses her rational thoughts and common sense to avoid 
potential danger.
Allison experiences fear, but she doesn’t act afraid. She believes that showing 
fear will encourage the teens to intensify their harassment of her. She feels 
anger, but she walks away, knowing that a confrontation won’t change the 
situation and may be dangerous. What Allison demonstrates is called emo-
tional regulation. She chooses how to express her emotions based on rational 
thought, not feelings.

191
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
Practicing emotional regulation
The ability to control feelings and change behaviors grows over time. For 
example, a toddler acts according to his feelings, not his thoughts. When a 
toddler is upset, he cries; when he’s happy, he laughs; when he’s angry, he 
throws a tantrum. As he matures, his emotional expressions become more 
complex — he doesn’t cry every time he’s upset — and he may whine or ask 
for help from his parents instead. He realizes that he has other options for 
displaying his feelings. If he develops normally, by the time he’s in elemen-
tary school, he begins to think about how he feels and how to express him-
self. So, he may get angry at a playmate on the playground but refrain from 
hitting him. Or, he may feel hurt by someone’s teasing, but he doesn’t burst 
into tears.
Even as time passes, however, people with BPD generally don’t master the 
art of emotional regulation. To find out more about the biological, psycholog-
ical, and social reasons for this deficit, head to Chapter 4. Basically, emotions 
take charge and dictate the behavior of people with BPD because they have 
no idea how to modify feelings with thoughts. Emotions and thoughts aren’t 
connected for them, and this disconnection interferes with their ability to 
temper feelings and control outbursts. Understandably, the emotional lives 
of most people with BPD are fraught with instability.
 
Feelings can be positive like happiness or negative like grief or a mixture of 
both, but they’re not inherently good or bad from a moral standpoint.
 
If you have trouble noticing and describing what and how you feel, keep a 
daily log for a couple of weeks. Take a few moments three to five times a day 
to write down how you’re feeling at that particular time. Notice the body sen-
sations that accompany your feelings. Jot down your feelings, your physical 
sensations, the situation at the time of your note taking, and any thoughts you 
may have. Don’t worry about your punctuation and grammar. Write quickly 
without thinking too much. If you’re in therapy, discuss your results with your 
therapist.
You may also want to review Chapter 6 for more information about the rela-
tionship between emotions and BPD. We also provide various terms and 
words for describing your emotions in that chapter. Feel free to use those 
terms when you’re jotting down your feelings.
Allowing Feelings to Trump Thoughts
Some people with BPD stay acutely tuned in to their feelings. Their attention 
is so focused on feelings that they may ignore or refute facts. They operate 
on the belief that feelings accurately indicate reality and must be true. So, 

192
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
under this premise, when you’re angry, there must be something to be mad 
about. When you’re jealous, your partner must be cheating on you. When 
you’re afraid, something must be scary.
The problem with this way of thinking is that emotions and feelings often por-
tray reality inaccurately. For people with BPD, negative feelings — whether 
the feelings are memories of abuse or feelings of emptiness — often spring 
from somewhere inside. These strong feelings distort the here and now. The 
following story about Jack demonstrates how intense feelings can cloud 
reality.
Jack watches his wife, Sara, cut the red peppers for the salad. Their com-
pany will be arriving soon. Jack gets nervous whenever they have people 
over for dinner. He’s starting to feel irritated with the way Sara’s cutting 
the peppers. “Here, let me do that,” he says as he brusquely takes the 
knife from her hand.
Sara knows how Jack gets. She tries to avoid any conflict. “Go ahead,” she 
says as she backs away, “I’ll set the table.”
Jack begins to slash violently at the peppers. He misses and the knife 
gouges the countertop. Sara asks him whether he’s okay. Saying nothing, 
Jack puts down the knife and leaves the room. Sara knows that he may 
not come down for dinner when their guests arrive.
Jack doesn’t know why he gets so upset whenever they have company. 
He feels incredibly anxious and irritated. He often retreats and leaves 
Sara to make excuses. Over the course of their marriage, Sara finds that 
having people over isn’t worth the emotional cost.
Jack’s father was emotionally abusive. Growing up, every dinner included 
brutal humiliation and cruel criticism. Jack doesn’t yet understand that 
his feelings about present-day meals reflect the terror he has of his own 
father.
Jack experienced repeated emotional abuse as a child. His strong emotions 
are understandable. However, because his negative feelings spill over into 
the present, they’re confusing to other people. Without help, Jack will likely 
lose the people he cares about the most.
 
Just because you feel a certain way doesn’t make that feeling true. Reality and 
feelings don’t always match up. If you have BPD, you probably have intense 
emotions that confuse and distort the truth. The next sections offer strategies 
that can help you control these intense emotions.

193
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
Relaxing and Practicing
Frequent, intensely negative emotions take a toll on your body because each 
time you feel a strong negative emotion, your body prepares for danger and 
gets ready to run or fight. People with BPD report more negative emotions 
and fewer positive emotions than most other people do (see Chapter 6 for 
more information about these negative emotions). These highly negative 
emotions are stressful and increase the risks for the following health issues:
 
✓ High blood pressure
 
✓ Chronic headaches
 
✓ Muscle aches
 
✓ Type 2 diabetes
 
✓ Back pain
 
✓ Irritable bowel syndrome
 
✓ Acid reflux
 
✓ Depressed immune system
 
✓ Heart disease
 
✓ Stroke
The simple motivation behind controlling emotions by discovering how to 
relax is based on a biological truth: You can’t be both relaxed and frantic at 
the same time. When you’re in a state of relaxation, your body slows down, 
your heart rate decreases, your muscles relax, and you have time to reflect. 
Therefore, relaxation helps people gain control over their emotions. In the 
next sections, we describe several ideas and methods for relaxation.
Making muscles relax
Progressive muscle relaxation has been around since the late 1930s when 
physician Edmund Jacobsen first wrote about the procedure. Basically, the 
technique involves tightening a group of muscles and then letting go of the 
tension. You’re supposed to pay attention to the group of muscles you’re 
tensing and then notice how they feel when you release the tension. Almost 
anyone can benefit from this simple technique. Of course, if you have back 
problems, arthritis, muscular pain, or have been injured, check with your 
medical provider before attempting this technique.

194
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Getting ready to relax
If you’re considering this muscle relaxation technique, keep the following tips 
in mind:
 
✓ Find a quiet place and turn off your cellphone.
 
✓ Don’t use mind-altering substances.
 
✓ Don’t have a full stomach.
 
✓ Wear loose-fitting clothing.
 
✓ Wear socks if your feet tend to get cold.
 
✓ Try to consciously keep your face relaxed.
 
✓ If you experience pain when you tense your muscles, stop.
 
✓ When you release your muscles, focus on the relaxed feeling.
 
✓ If you feel very anxious during this exercise, stop.
 
✓ Don’t worry if you fall asleep; just resume when you wake up.
 
✓ Don’t expect to be perfect; after all, this technique is supposed to be 
relaxing.
 
✓ Expect the process to take some time to master.
Full progressive muscle relaxation
You can begin with full progressive muscle relaxation. Although you don’t 
need to follow the directions in this section exactly, they can help you get 
started. After you practice a few times, you’ll be able to use progressive 
muscle relaxation without a script.
 
If you choose to use this technique to help you gain control of your strong 
emotions, you should practice it every day for at least a week or more. After 
you’ve practiced several times, you can work on a shorter version; and even-
tually you’ll be able to relax your muscles willfully without any formal proce-
dures at all.
To begin full progressive muscle relaxation, follow these steps:
 
1. Get comfortable and take a few breaths. Inhale deeply through your 
nose. Hold your breath for a few seconds; then slowly exhale.
 
 Each time we suggest tensing your muscles, hold the tension for 10 sec-
onds or so. When we suggest letting go of the tension and relaxing, focus 
on the relaxation for 10 or 15 seconds. But don’t get uptight about the 
exact time, and don’t use a stopwatch!
 
2. Start with your feet. Curl your toes; tense all the muscles in your feet. 
Now relax. Concentrate on the feeling of relaxation in your feet.

3. Moving up, tighten your calves by pushing down on your heels and 
pointing your toes up to your face. Watch out for muscle cramps, and 
stop if you experience any pain. Release; feel the tension from your 
calves flow out.
 
4. Squeeze your thighs. Hold and release.
 
5. Tighten up the buttocks. Stay focused. Relax and notice the relief.
 
6. Pull in your abdomen. Imagine your belly button touching your spine. 
Tighten; then release. Feel the tension flow away.
 
7. Make fists and squeeze. Release. Notice the feeling.
 
8. Tighten your arm muscles. Push your upper arms close to your body. 
Hold your forearms out as though you’re holding something in front 
of you. Use all your strength; now let your arms collapse, releasing 
stress.
 
9. To relax your shoulders, you need to use two separate movements. 
First, raise your shoulders up and try to touch your ears. Hold and 
release. Next pull your shoulder blades back and stick out your chest. 
Think about your shoulders meeting behind you. Then relax.
 
10. Be careful with your neck, don’t push too hard and don’t try this if 
you have whiplash or any type of neck injury. Push your neck down 
to your chest. Hold and relax. Now take it to one side. Tilt your ear 
toward one shoulder; hold and release. Now follow the same move-
ment on the other side — ear to shoulder. Finally, gently pull your 
head back toward your back, and then release.
 
11. Now for the face. Scrunch up — squeeze your forehead, mouth, 
tongue, and lips. Relax.
 
12. With your eyes closed, imagine going through an inventory of your 
muscles. If you still feel tension in any area, repeat the muscle tension-
and-release cycle. Spend a few minutes breathing and feeling relaxed.
 
Many people feel tension in their shoulders, back, or neck. Feel free to modify 
or increase the number of times you tense and release those areas. You may 
also want to tense and relax an area in your body several times a day as an 
instant stress reducer.
Shortened muscle relaxation
After you’ve practiced the muscle relaxation as depicted in the preceding 
section, try putting groups of muscles together. See whether you can achieve 
relaxation by using the following technique.
 
1. Get comfortable and take a few deep breaths.
 
2. Tighten all the muscles from your waist down. Squeeze your buttocks, 
curl your toes, and tighten your thighs. Hold that tension for about ten 
seconds; then relax.

196
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
3. Pull in your abdomen and try to push your back into the floor (or 
chair). Hold and then release, feeling the tension flow away from you.
 
4. Press your arms into your body, squeeze your hands, and push your 
shoulders up to your ears. When you relax, imagine waves of warm 
water gently washing over you.
 
5. Squeeze the muscles in your face — grin, grimace, and squint. Keep 
the muscles tight and then relax.
 
6. Stay focused on your body. Are there areas of tension? If so, tense 
and release the muscles in those areas. Breathe and enjoy. Notice how 
your body feels.
If you achieve a relaxed state using the shortened relaxation technique, you 
may be ready to imagine your body relaxing without actually tensing any 
muscles. The idea is to practice the longer versions of muscle relaxation until 
you’re pretty familiar with how being physically relaxed feels. Your body 
remembers the experience of being relaxed, and, with enough practice, this 
memory can enable you to relax at will.
A more mental kind of muscle relaxation
When you’re ready to move on to relaxing your muscles without physically 
tensing them up, try the following technique. These steps can help your mus-
cles stay loose and relaxed:
 
1. Close your eyes and take a long deep breath.
 
2. Attend to the top of your head. Relax and let all the tension go from 
your mind.
 
3. Slowly move your attention down your body, through your head. 
Think about your neck and shoulders. Relax the muscles.
 
4. Move down through your arms and your abdomen. Breath and relax.
 
5. Now continue down. Release any tension.
 
6. Decide to be calm and quiet.
Hypnotizing yourself into relaxation
You can use your mind to relax your body, too. And you don’t need to pay for 
a hypnotist to achieve this state. Instead, you can use the autogenic method 
(which means produced from within). This method is based on the power of 
suggestion and was developed by German neuropsychiatrist Johannes Shultz 
in the 1930s. Like progressive muscle relaxation, which we describe in the 
preceding section, this technique has many renditions.

197
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
First, you need a quiet place in which to practice this technique. Most people 
use the autogenic method lying down. However, if you have a really comfort-
able chair, you can use it. Make sure that you’re wearing loose-fitting cloth-
ing and that you won’t be interrupted. We recommend that you practice this 
exercise about three times a day for a week or two.
 
Don’t try too hard to relax. Too much effort defeats the purpose. Let yourself 
experience the soothing suggestions of autogenic training. Try to feel warm 
and quiet, and follow these steps:
 
1. Start by making sure that you’re in a comfortable position. Take a few 
slow, deep breaths.
 
2. Imagine that your arms and legs are starting to feel heavy.
 
 They’re getting so heavy that you can’t move them. Your arms are 
heavy; now your hands are heavy. Your legs feel like they may sink into 
the ground. Your feet are getting heavy, too. The heaviness is beginning 
to pull away all the stress from your body. The words keep coming . . . 
heavy . . . heavy . . . heavy. Your arms and hands are heavy. Your legs 
and feet are heavy. You are still. Keep focusing on how heavy you feel. 
You are calm. As you remain still, the worries are slipping away from 
your body.
 
3. Imagine that the sun is shining brightly and warming your body.
 
 Your arms are getting pleasantly warm. Your hands begin to feel warm. 
A warm blanket surrounds you. Your legs are starting to feel warm. Now 
imagine a pond with warm water. You decide to sink into the water. The 
gentle current brushes against you. The water is warm and melts away 
the tensions in your body. You are warm and still. The water swirls and 
warms your body. You feel slow and steady, peaceful and calm. Relaxed. 
Feel the comfort of the sun and the warm, gentle water. No need to 
move, nothing to do — except to enjoy the feeling.
 
4. Place a hand over your heart.
 
 Your heart beats strong and steady. You have nothing to do. Your heart 
beat is regular, beating steady. Nothing to do. Your heart beats like a 
steady, regular drum. Strong . . . steady . . . strong . . . steady . . . feel 
yourself relax. Tension fades . . . let go of worries . . . warm, secure, calm, 
peaceful.
 
5. Now relax. Close your eyes. Think about your breathing.
 
 Don’t use any effort. Just let yourself breathe. Allow your body to take 
charge. Breathe slow and steady. Enjoy the feeling of quiet. Serene, calm, 
easy. In and out, slow and steady, smooth. Each breath brings peace and 
calm. In and out, slow and easy.

198
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
You can change autogenic training to fit your own imagination. For example, 
you can take yourself on an imaginary journey to the beach or a quiet moun-
tain setting rather than into a warm pond. Keep in mind that the basic prin-
ciples are focusing on feeling heavy and warm and concentrating on slow and 
steady breathing.
Soothing through the senses
Listening to classical music soothes and relaxes some people. Others, on the 
other hand, find sitting through a symphony torturous. A hot bath for some 
brings peace and calm; others find sitting in the bathtub boring. Although 
aromatherapy makes some people sneeze, others feel calmed by certain 
smells.
We encourage you to sort through the following activities to find a few that 
you can use to relax. If you have BPD, make a list of five to ten activities that 
you can easily do to help you calm down. Having a list will help you remem-
ber to do one of your soothing activities when you find yourself overwhelmed 
by emotions.
Write your list on a few index cards. Post one card at home in a place where 
you will notice it (on your bathroom mirror, for example), another in your 
car, and another at work. Try to pick at least one activity that you can do in 
most of the places you find yourself in. For instance, you probably can’t sit in 
a hot tub while driving, but you can have a CD of calming music in your car. 
You probably can’t start a campfire at work, but maybe you can have a cup 
of tea. Here are some of our suggestions for relaxing activities (but don’t limit 
yourself to our ideas — feel free to come up with some of your own):
 
✓ Sound: Whether you choose jazz, classical, rock and roll, or hip hop, 
pick a music that often puts you in a better place. You can also try out 
recordings of nature sounds or quiet music. For example, you may enjoy 
the sound of water flowing. To use that sound to calm you down, you 
can find a CD with water sounds on it, or you can buy or even make 
a personal indoor fountain. Sound machines can also be soothing. 
Depending on where you live, you may enjoy going outside and listening 
to the wind, traffic, birds, or the ocean.
 
✓ Sight: Look outside, find a park, watch animals play, go to a museum, 
look at a beloved photo album, look at an aquarium, watch a water-
fall, watch a campfire or fireplace, look at the ocean or a lake. If you 
don’t live near the ocean or a waterfall or any other part of nature that 
soothes you, buy a book with pictures of that piece of nature and look 
through it when you feel overwhelmed with emotions.

199
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
 
✓ Smell: Light a candle, bake some cookies, smell flowers, burn incense, 
try aromatherapy, put on a little perfume, or take a walk in the mall near 
the cinnamon buns shop.
 
✓ Taste: Savor a hot cup of coffee, a small piece of chocolate, a cold glass 
of ice water, a piece of toast with jelly, some green chili stew (the hotter, 
the better), a cup of chicken noodle soup, or a bowl of ice cream. Sip a 
glass of wine, milk, or chamomile tea — whatever calms you.
 
 If you have any issues with substance abuse, a glass of wine is a very 
bad strategy for relaxing. A single glass of wine is fine, but if having one 
glass leads you to want more, don’t go there. The same principle applies 
to ice cream if you have an eating disorder.
 
✓ Touch: Get a massage or a hug from someone you care about, pet your 
dog or cat, sit in a hot tub, wear your favorite sweats, crawl into bed and 
pull all the covers up.
 
You can also calm your emotional state by radically changing your body 
temperature. You can accomplish this change with a hot bath or a sauna. Or, 
you can do so in a very surprising way — by immersing your face in a sink of 
ice water! Yes, you read that correctly. Dipping your face into ice water while 
you hold your breath for 15 or 20 seconds triggers your body to change its 
metabolic rate, which causes your mood to shift along with it. This technique 
is especially effective for severe emotional distress, and it isn’t nearly as 
unpleasant as you may think. We’ve even tried it ourselves. You may need to 
immerse your face two or three times to get the full effect of this strategy.
After you make your list of relaxing activities, don’t wait for overwhelming 
emotions to try one out. Like the Boy Scouts say, be prepared. Practicing 
relaxation now can help you get ready for times when you truly are stressed. 
Practice provides you with the knowledge of what your body feels like when 
it’s relaxed. And knowing what being relaxed feels like can help you calm 
your body and mind down when you feel tense.
Discovering Meditation
Like an untethered kite caught by a sudden shift of wind, your emotions likely 
swing widely with little provocation if you have BPD. Your emotions soar 
sky-high quickly and crash unexpectedly. The idea of controlling emotions 
through meditation may seem difficult, if not impossible, but don’t shut the 
book just yet.
Meditation helps quell emotional storms. With practice, the mind can become 
a place of peace and contentment. A balanced mind is steady and able to 
accept daily challenges. Meditation helps stabilize the unbalanced mind.

200
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
For meditation to work, frequent practice is necessary. No set rules or guide-
lines exist for how many times you should meditate, but once a day for about 
five minutes is a good start. The goal is to become regular about meditation. 
After you start practicing meditation, extending the five minutes is a good 
idea. How much time you devote, though, is up to you. Many people discover 
that they really enjoy meditating for 30 minutes to an hour every day. Here 
are a few hints for acquiring the meditation habit:
 
✓ Wear comfortable, loose clothing. No special attire is necessary (just 
don’t wear skintight jeans).
 
✓ Turn off your cellphones, pagers, telephones, and so on. Don’t watch 
TV or use your computer — doing so just won’t do. You can listen to 
quiet music if you want to.
 
✓ Meditate wherever you want to. Outside is great (although perhaps 
not so easily done in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City). If 
you want, set up a special place in your home; you may want to have a 
candle, a special picture, a painting, some objects with spiritual signifi-
cance, or a photograph to look at.
 
✓ Sit on a mat — called a zabuton — or a pillow. Some people also use 
wood bricks, blankets, or a small pillow called a zafu to make sitting 
more comfortable. You can also sit on a chair or couch. The important 
part is to sit up straight.
 
✓ Sit still. You can sit in several different positions. For example, you can 
sit with your legs crossed and your hands resting on your knees, palms 
up. Or, you can sit with your heels pressed against each other. You can 
also just sit comfortably the way you usually do. At first, maintaining 
one position for a long time may be hard for you to do, which is why 
practice helps. Also, consider taking a class in either meditation or yoga 
for help in finding the right position for you.
 
✓ Start by noticing your breathing. You can close your eyes or leave them 
open. Try not to focus on anything but your breathing. Let thoughts 
come and go.
You have many forms of meditation to choose from. We briefly discuss 
breathing meditation, walking meditation, guided meditation, and candle 
meditation here.
 
✓ Breathing meditation: Be still — keep your eyes partially opened or 
closed. Direct your attention to your breathing. As you breathe in 
through your nose, be aware of the flow of air. The air flows softly 
through your nostrils into your lungs, then deeper until the air pushes 
out the abdomen. Place one hand on the abdomen to feel the air fill it 
up; then pull those muscles tighter to push the air out. Breathe deeply, 

201
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
and concentrate on the sensation of breathing. Focus on the air going 
in and the air going out. If your mind begins to wander, bring it back to 
your breathing. Stay with this meditation until your mind quiets.
 
✓ Walking meditation: Take a slow walk on a nice day. Don’t go to a 
crowded mall. Take a few deep breaths before you start. Notice your 
body moving. Focus on your legs. How do the muscles in your calves, 
ankles, and thighs move so effectively to propel your body through space. 
Think of the magic of movement. Stay focused on your legs, body, and 
feet. If other thoughts come to your mind, let them go. Return to think-
ing about walking. Concentrate on the pace of your stride, the rhythm of 
your breathing. Focus on the noise of your feet falling. Keep a steady and 
focused walk. Pay attention to the feelings in your body — the tempera-
ture, your breathing, your muscles. Walk like this for ten minutes or more.
 
✓ Guided meditation: This type of meditation involves imagination or the 
use of words or phrases to transform and heal. You can choose from 
many varieties of guided meditation. You can download scripts for free 
from various Web sites on the Internet. (For example, www.how-to-
meditate.org, www.wikihow.com/meditate, and www.meditate.
com provide a lot of insight into this type of meditation.) Or, you can 
make up your own guided meditation. Here are a couple of suggestions:
 
• Breathing in, I calm my body; breathing out, I relax.
 
• Feeling peace, I breathe in; feeling joy, I breathe out.
 
✓ Candle meditation: Watching the flame of a candle while breathing 
deeply is another form of meditation. Sit quietly and focus all your atten-
tion on the flame. See the different colors of the fire; watch the flame 
twist and turn. Stay focused for five or ten minutes.
Experiment with various meditation practices. Don’t expect a quick result. 
The benefits of meditation may not be obvious for some time. But, the subtle 
changes in your mind, emotions, and body can be very healing. The following 
story about Grace, who uses meditation to help her maintain emotional bal-
ance, depicts how healing this practice can be.
Grace wanders into the lunch room at work. A couple of her co-workers 
are sitting at another table laughing. When Grace walks in, they notice her 
and stop laughing. Grace asks, “Did I interrupt a private conversation?”
“No, we were gossiping and laughing about you,” one of the women jokes. 
Grace feels her face flush and starts to get angry. “Just kidding, Grace,” 
says one of her co-workers. “We weren’t talking about you at all. You take 
everything so personally. Get over it.”
Grace turns and leaves the lunch room. She goes back to her office 
and closes the door. Grace has been in therapy for about six months 

202
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
because of BPD. Learning to control her anger has been a focus of her 
work in therapy. She feels pretty good that she walked away from the 
lunch room. She realizes that even a couple of months ago she would’ve 
reacted to those women with an explosive tirade. Now, she sits at her 
desk and closes her eyes. She takes a few deep breaths and starts to feel 
her body relax. After a couple of minutes, she feels a deep peace and joy. 
Grace returns to the lunch room and apologizes to her co-workers.
Grace’s story typifies most people’s experience with meditation. Meditation is 
neither magic nor a quickly acquired skill. However, with practice, it can help 
you gain a measure of control over your emotions that you didn’t have before. 
And there’s no real limit to how far meditation can take you. Grace may eventu-
ally become so skilled at meditation that she’s able to cut her reflexive anger 
off before it even hits her. Check out Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by 
Stephan Bodian and Dean Ornish (Wiley), for more information.
Acquiring Acceptance
What we’re about to tell you may sound a little strange, but bear with us. If 
you have BPD, you’ve probably spent a lot of time fighting against what your 
BPD drives you to do, such as your
 
✓ Emotional outbursts
 
✓ Impulses
 
✓ Temper
 
✓ Desire to drink or take drugs
Indeed, you likely view your BPD symptoms as completely abhorrent and 
unacceptable. Yet, in spite of your best efforts, you feel trapped by the stran-
glehold these problems have on you.
What you probably don’t realize is that you’ve been fighting too hard. What? 
Are we suggesting that you give up your struggles and simply accept all your 
problems? Not exactly.
Consider that your experience with BPD is much like getting caught in a rip-
tide. Riptides are narrow bands of water that generally flow powerfully away 
from where you want to be (the safety of the shore). Even accomplished 
swimmers who attempt to swim against a riptide can drown. Experts strongly 
advise people who get caught in riptides not to swim directly against the 
flow of the tide. Rather, they recommend that swimmers in this predicament 
“accept” that they’re ensnared by the riptide and swim parallel to the cur-
rents until they abate. After the flow subsides, they can safely swim to shore.

203
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
Similarly, escaping the currents of your BPD requires that you first accept 
where you’re at — which means you need to stop impugning, punishing, and 
pummeling yourself simply because you have BPD. No one asks to have dis-
orders like BPD, and many forces outside of your control contribute to your 
acquiring this disorder (see Chapter 4 for examples). As you gradually accept 
where you are now, you can find more energy for moving to a better place.
We offer you two major strategies for finding an accepting state of mind. As 
you practice the following two skills, you’re likely to find yourself swimming 
slowly toward the shore, away from where BPD wants to take you:
 
✓ Discovering your observant mind
 
✓ Playing with your judgmental mind
Discovering your observant mind
The human brain is a remarkable organ. Humans have used their brains to 
create language and explore the mysteries of the universe from the level of 
the cosmos to that of the subatomic. The brain also evaluates and judges 
most everything it perceives.
All too often, those evaluations are negative, disturbing, and upsetting. In 
truth, most people probably engage in such harsh judging more than neces-
sary, but people with BPD take this habit to extremes.
 
People with BPD are no less intelligent than other people. But they do make 
excessive use of the judging, evaluative part of their brains, which increases 
their negative thoughts. For example, a brilliant physician with BPD cares 
deeply about the health of his patients, but he judges them harshly for their 
unhealthy lifestyles. If he didn’t judge and evaluate so much, he could more 
successfully influence his patients with gentle understanding.
One way out of this dilemma is to foster awareness and development of what 
is called the observant mind. To find your own observant mind, close your eyes 
for a few minutes. While your eyes are closed, notice when a thought enters 
your mind. It may take a few seconds or a few minutes, but we’re pretty sure a 
thought will come in — even if the thought is simply, “I wonder when a thought 
is going to come into my mind” or “This feels stupid and boring.”
After you notice the thought, open your eyes. Ask yourself who noticed the 
thought. Clearly, you are not your thoughts. Rather, an observant part of 
your mind notices what’s going on inside of you without offering up a judg-
ment or evaluation. Your thought may have entailed a judgment, but your 
observation of the thought was merely that — an observation.

204
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
When we travel, we enjoy combining a little work with leisure. We lug our 
computers around and dedicate portions of our trip to writing. Writing away 
from home gives us a different perspective — and at times, it can be surpris-
ingly productive. Today is a writing day. We took a long walk and asked that 
the maids at our hotel clean our room while we were out. But, when we came 
back, the maids were still in our room.
So as not to waste a single moment, allow us to show you the difference 
between the evaluative or critical mind and the observant mind in terms of 
our experience at the hotel.
 
✓ Critical mind: We’re forced to wait outside because the hotel didn’t get 
someone to clean our room the minute we asked. Our computers are 
locked up in the room. We have nothing to do. It feels a little too warm 
out here. Trains and traffic are rumbling obnoxiously in the distance. 
You can barely hear the ocean. How are we ever going to get this book 
done on time? This is awful. Yellow leaves are on the vines, and dead 
leaves lie scattered around the patio. Disgustingly skinny people swim-
ming in the pool remind us of the French fries we ate at lunch.
 
✓ Observant mind: We’re sitting outside. The temperature is about 75 
degrees Fahrenheit. The sun is shining, and the sky is bright blue. You 
can see the ocean across the lawn. Purple, red, pink, white, and blue flow-
ers surround us. A trellis supports a green vine with some yellow leaves. 
The breeze blows a few dead leaves across the patio. Hotel maintenance 
workers rumble by with their carts clattering on the cobblestones. A train 
whistle pierces the quiet. In the distance, a few cars go by.
We’re cheating a bit. We happen to be in Santa Barbara, California, in the 
middle of winter. We could easily have made the observant mind’s scene idyl-
lic because the setting in Santa Barbara is so strikingly beautiful. However, 
the observant mind merely describes what is. By contrast, the critical mind 
judges and typically does so harshly. When we rely solely on our critical 
minds, we can make ourselves miserable just about anywhere — even in 
Santa Barbara!
 
The observant mind accepts whatever is around you and merely describes 
what’s there. The more you use your observant mind and accept what’s going 
on around you and inside of you, the less distressed you’re likely to be.
 
Try thinking back on a time when you felt upset. Write down all the critical, 
evaluative thoughts that generated your distress. Then, rewrite your story 
while refraining from making any judgments whatsoever. Focus on describing 
events and scenes from a detached, neutral perspective.
To give you an idea of the disparity between these two parts of your mind, 
notice the difference between the following critical mind–generated thoughts 
versus the observant mind’s descriptions of the same scenes in Sharon’s 
story.

205
 Chapter 16: Calming the Storms Within
The bank teller returns the check to Sharon and says, “I’m sorry, Miss. 
This check is from an out-of-state bank. We can deposit it, but the funds 
won’t be available for five business days.”
Sharon, who has been banking at this branch for six years, asks the teller, 
“Would you check that out with your manager? I’ve cashed checks in this 
amount from this bank before.”
Sharon’s critical mind: That little twit, how dare she! I can’t believe this 
is happening to me. What does she think? That I’m trying to steal money 
from this frigging bank? I can’t believe she has the nerve. That’s it, I’m 
going to take my money and find a bank that will respect me.
Sharon’s observant mind: Well, this has never happened before. I 
wonder whether my bank implemented a new policy. Perhaps the man-
ager that I know is working today. I’m sure that I can show someone that 
I have enough in my account to cover the check. If not, I suppose I can 
wait a few days for the money.
How does Sharon feel when she’s using her critical mind? Probably quite 
angry. However, when she stays in her observant mind, she remains calm for 
the most part. Perhaps she feels a tad inconvenienced but certainly not full 
of rage.
 
Having an observant mind doesn’t rid you of all distressing feelings. However, 
it does help you reduce the stranglehold those feelings have on you by allow-
ing you to accept what is rather than making things worse by judging your 
feelings. Paradoxically, giving yourself permission to have negative feelings 
softens their overall impact.
Playing with your judgmental mind
Yet another strategy for dealing with your mind’s tendency to generate harsh, 
judgmental thoughts is to take a playful approach. Psychologists know that 
completely stopping negative thoughts is almost impossible. In fact, research 
shows that when you try to suppress such thinking, the negative thoughts boo-
merang on you and increase in intensity.
However, you can make great headway in reducing the emotional impact of 
your self-denigrating thoughts by figuring out how to relate to them differ-
ently. We recommend that you try two strategies for taking your negative 
thinking less seriously — thanking your mind and putting your thoughts to 
music.
Thanking your mind
Thanking your mind entails using the power of sarcasm to diffuse the emo-
tional turmoil that negative thinking causes. When you hear harsh, critical 

206
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
thoughts running through your mind, you literally thank your mind for being 
so helpful. Here are some examples of negative thoughts and ways you can 
respond to thank your mind for producing them:
Negative thought: I’m hopeless.
Sarcastic, thankful thought: Thank you, mind; that was such a helpful 
thought.
Negative thought: I’m a mean, hateful person.
Sarcastic, thankful thought: That was a creative thing to say. Thanks so 
much for the help, mind.
Negative thought: I’ll never be happy.
Sarcastic, thankful thought: What a fantastic prediction for my future! 
How can I ever thank you enough, mind?
The thanking-your-mind technique may seem a little silly at first. But, in a 
way, silliness is the point. Using this strategy can help you relate to your 
thoughts differently. With practice, you’ll see that thoughts are truly just 
thoughts and don’t reflect reality straight up. Thanking your mind is yet 
another way of cooling the emotional fires caused by hot thoughts.
Putting your thoughts to music
The next time you find yourself ruminating about how awful you are, how 
your life sucks, or how poorly people treat you, try singing your thoughts to 
the tune of a song. Almost any song will do so long as it doesn’t have a down-
cast spirit. We find nursery rhymes, Christmas carols, and pop hits especially 
useful. Singing your thoughts out loud to upbeat tunes changes the meaning 
of your thoughts.

In This Chapter
▶ Discovering your values
▶ Developing a personal mission statement
▶ Appreciating forgiveness of yourself and others
P
eople with borderline personality disorder (BPD) wake up one morn-
ing and find themselves intensely enthusiastic about a person, a job, a 
political idea, a project, or a religion. Their passion is contagious, and others 
often join in with eagerness. Then, without warning, they reject or lose inter-
est in their previous passions. Their fleeting interests and fickle loyalties 
leave them feeling fragmented and disjointed, and they confuse the people 
around them, especially those who shared their passions.
When pressed to think about their values, goals, and beliefs, people with BPD 
often become uneasy and disoriented. They can’t put their ideals or princi-
ples into words. The slightest nudge by a new person or a new idea can shift 
their focus completely. Thus, they may have trouble developing a consis-
tent identity or sense of who they are. Their lives are often full of discarded 
friends, relationships, and interests.
In Chapter 7, we describe in greater detail the problems with unstable identi-
ties that people with BPD often experience. In this chapter, we give you ideas 
about how to work on obtaining a more stable sense of self. We provide strat-
egies for identifying your values and then show you how to use those values 
to write a life mission statement. To facilitate this process of living by a new 
life mission, we lay out a plan for letting go of blame and rage and finding 
forgiveness.
Clarifying What’s Important in Your Life
Remember when you were a child and it seemed like forever until summer 
vacation or your birthday or the next holiday? If you’re like most people, the 
older you get the faster time seems to speed by. You probably don’t have a 

208
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
lot of extra time to reflect on life’s purpose — after all, most people struggle 
just to go about the daily business of living.
However, taking a bit of time to step back and think about what your life is 
about and how you want to live it can be useful and, occasionally, life chang-
ing. Whether you have BPD or not, figuring out what’s most important can 
help you form goals for the future, which, in turn, can help you stop strug-
gling from moment to moment.
 
Thinking about the big picture can be fairly overwhelming to people with BPD, 
so we encourage people with BPD to work on the exercises we present in this 
section with a therapist — and to do so gradually over time.
Finding your personal priorities
To clarify what you value, you must think about what you want out of your 
life. You have several big matters to consider. Some of the topics we describe 
in this section may not interest you, and others may not be relevant or pos-
sible in your life. You don’t have to answer all the questions we ask here, but 
the list of personal priorities following our numbered instructions gives you 
some subjects to think about.
 
Consider writing out your thoughts and answers to our questions in a note-
book or computer file. Writing down your thoughts helps clarify thinking and 
will be useful when you want to develop your personal mission statement. If 
you’re working with a therapist, having a document to refer back to in later 
sessions can be helpful. The following steps can help you start looking at 
what’s most important in your life:
 
1. Write each bold word or phrase from the following list of personal 
priorities in your notebook.
 
2. Ponder the questions that follow each bold word or phrase.
 
3. Write down your answers. If a specific category is unimportant or 
irrelevant to you, skip it or write N/A for not applicable.
 
4. Circle the five values that you feel are most important to you.
 
5. Then pare your choices down to the three values you want to focus on 
first. Underline them.
Here’s the list of personal priorities to choose from:
 
✓ Charity: What does charity mean to you? Is charity a part of your life? 
How do you want to change your life in relation to charity? Do you 
spend as much time helping others as you’d like? How can you be more 
charitable with yourself?

209
 Chapter 17: Creating an Identity
 
✓ Environment: Do you value conservation? Do you want to leave the 
world a better place than when you found it by minimizing your carbon 
footstep? Do you recycle? Do you take time to appreciate and enjoy 
nature? How do you see yourself in relation to living creatures and 
plants?
 
✓ Work: How do you define work? Does work give you meaning? What can 
you do to change your work life? Are you satisfied at work? Do you sup-
port yourself? Is your work helping others?
 
✓ Spirituality: What, if any, are your spiritual beliefs? Do these beliefs give 
you comfort? How do these beliefs impact the way you live your life? Are 
you living a life that is compatible with your spirituality? What changes 
do you want to make to your life to make it more compatible with your 
spiritual beliefs? How can you make those changes?
 
✓ Community: Who are the people in your community? Do you contrib-
ute to your community? Do you take away from your community? What 
does being a member of your community mean? Do you think taking part 
in politics is important? Do you want to make changes based on these 
thoughts?
 
✓ Intimate relationships: Whom are you close to? Have you lost relation-
ships because of BPD? How do you show concern for the people you 
care about? Do your close relationships help you or hurt you?
 
✓ Family: Define family for yourself. Who is your family? Are you holding 
onto anger about your childhood? What does being a family member 
mean to you?
 
✓ Friends: Do you have friends? Do you value friendship? What changes 
do you want to make in your life when you think about your friendships?
 
✓ Creativity: What is creativity to you? Do you have ways in which you 
can express your creative power? Are you satisfied with the place cre-
ativity has in your life?
 
✓ Intellectual goals: What value do you place on life-long learning? Are 
you giving yourself credit for learning to help yourself with BPD? Are 
you taking advantage of opportunities that evolve? What do you want to 
do differently now that you’ve thought about learning?
 
✓ Recreation and entertainment: What do you like to do for fun? Do you 
spend enough time doing things you enjoy? Are hobbies important to 
you? Do you value recreation for the positive effects it can have on your 
mood and your life?
 
✓ Possessions: Are possessions important to you? Do you have all you 
want? Do you have all you need?

210
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
✓ Finances: Are you comfortable with your finances? Do you have prob-
lems with overspending? Are you saving for the future? Do you have 
needs that aren’t being met financially? Can you do something now or in 
the near future to help your situation?
 
✓ Health: How is your health? Is it important to you? Do you spend time 
fostering good health? Do you exercise and eat right?
 
✓ Appearance: Do you like the way you look? How important is appear-
ance to you? Is the appearance of your friends important to you?
 
✓ You: What do you like about yourself? Do you want to accept yourself? 
Do you value honesty? What do you dislike about yourself? Do you 
blame yourself for all your problems and struggles? Is recognition or 
success critical to your happiness? Do you feel being right is important?
 
Try not to beat yourself up if you notice that you’re not living in a way that 
matches what you value most. Whether you have BPD or not, only a few saints 
live fully and always in ways consistent with their values.
After you’ve reviewed your values and decided which three feel the most 
important to you, you’re ready for the next step — writing out a personal life 
mission statement.
Creating a personal life mission statement
Businesses create mission statements to capture the essence of their orga-
nizations’ purposes, goals, and directions. Doing so helps executives keep 
track of whether their company is staying on the right path or deviating from 
its primary mission. A mission statement also helps consumers understand 
the purpose and values of a particular business and its products.
Creating a personal life mission statement accomplishes similar goals for you 
in your life. Having such a statement can help you know whether you’re going 
where you want to go or investing considerable time in activities that deviate 
from your priorities.
Preparing to create your statement
Here are some tips to keep in mind when you’re preparing to create your life 
mission statement:
 
✓ Think small, not globally. For example, you don’t want to promise to 
eliminate global hunger. Nice thought, perhaps, but it’s pretty hard for 
one person to do in a lifetime! Instead, you can consider volunteering at 
a food bank once a week.

211
 Chapter 17: Creating an Identity
 
✓ Try to include ideas that you can enact in small ways most days. For 
example, you may have identified a value of being more charitable. You 
can include in your mission statement that you want to contribute a 
small amount of time most days to either doing nice things for people or 
helping others in some manner.
 
✓ Focus on specific, positive actions instead of saying what you won’t 
do. For example, you don’t want to say that you’ll never rage again. 
Instead, vow to compliment others and practice emotional regulation 
skills (see Chapter 16 for ways to regulate your emotions).
 
✓ Make your mission statement short and doable. Usually a paragraph or 
so in length is dandy. Try not to cover too much ground; remember that 
you can always revise and add items over the years.
 
✓ Focus on changes you’d like to make in your life. These changes typi-
cally involve things you’d like to do more of.
 
✓ Change your mission statement if and when it doesn’t quite feel right. 
With the passage of time, you may have something you wish to add to or 
remove from your list. After all, values can and do change.
Putting your statement on paper
You can’t write your life mission statement without thought, effort, and time. 
You may write several drafts before you’re happy with your statement. Feel 
free to ask for feedback from your therapist or a close, trusted friend you’ve 
known for quite awhile. To put your mission statement on paper, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Start by reviewing your three most highly rated core values.
 
2. Consider filling in the blanks for statements similar to the ones in the 
following list to create your life mission statement:
 
 Because I value ___________, I plan to __________.
 
 I will _____________ in order to _______________.
 
 I will become more ___________ by _____________.
 
 I will improve ____________ by ________________.
 
 I commit to strengthening _______ by ____________.
 
 I dedicate my life to _________ by _______________.
 
3. Be sure to cover each of your three core values in some way, but keep 
the actions small and achievable.
Sampling two life mission statements
When you’re designing a life mission statement, seeing what other people 
have done helps. The following story about Diana demonstrates how an ini-
tial mission statement can reflect values that are in a state of flux.

212
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Diana, a talented dancer in her mid-twenties, loses her job at a local 
musical theater. Her boss fires her because she missed too much work 
and argued incessantly with other cast members. She’s briefly hospital-
ized after an overdose of prescription medicine. While in the hospital, 
she’s diagnosed with BPD and is referred to a partial hospitalization 
program (see Chapter 11 for information about the different treatment 
options for BPD).
As part of her treatment, Diana works on exploring and identifying her 
core values. She chooses three areas that she wants to concentrate on: 
friends, work, and appearance. Here’s the mission statement she comes 
up with:
Diana’s first life mission statement: Because friends are important to 
me, I will work on controlling my emotions and remaining calmer around 
my friends. Because I know I’m lucky to work as a dancer, I will appreci-
ate the privilege by being more reliable. I value my appearance and it’s 
critical for my job, so I will keep up with dieting and exercising to stay 
healthy.
Over the course of two years of inconsistently going to therapy, Diana 
suffers several relapses. Her good intentions don’t prevent her from get-
ting fired two more times from theater jobs. The pressure of performing 
on stage seems too emotionally charged. She finds herself unemployed, 
dependent on her parents for support, and without friends. Frustrated 
and lonely, Diana seeks help. Her therapist asks Diana to look again at 
how she’s living her life. Diana revisits her mission statement. “These 
values seem superficial to me now,” she tells her therapist, “I sound like 
a teenager. I was focused on how good I looked and how to please my 
friends. Now, I just want to feel like a good person and keep a job.”
Diana decides that her values have changed. She now wants to find a 
work situation she can handle. She understands that she needs a more 
structured and less demanding job. She sees her appearance as much 
less important than she did before. After reanalyzing her values, Diana 
determines three new areas she wants to focus on — improving her own 
mental health, finding a stable, low-stress job, and giving to others by vol-
unteering at the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI). She devel-
ops the following new life mission statement:
Diana’s second life mission statement: I commit to staying in treatment 
to take better care of myself. Because I value financial independence, I 
plan to find a job I’m capable of sticking with. Because I’m grateful for the 
help I’ve received, I want to commit to helping others by connecting with 
something like NAMI.
Notice that Diana’s first mission statement didn’t contain statements about 
what she wouldn’t do, such as raging, but focused instead on making positive 
efforts to remain calm. She discovered that she wasn’t quite ready to control 
her emotions but figured out that controlling where she worked might help. 
When she reanalyzed her values after two years of living, she recommitted to 

213
 Chapter 17: Creating an Identity
therapy and decided she wanted to help others. She felt that her values had 
evolved in a positive way.
The following story about John highlights someone who is failing to live 
according to his value system because he’s caught up in anger.
John, an attorney, enters treatment for BPD after his third divorce. John 
works long hours but is financially unstable. He spends too much money, 
and his divorces have cost him plenty. His physician tells him that he has 
to learn how to control his anger or he’ll end up having a heart attack.
John decides to see a psychologist to work on his issues. His psycholo-
gist wants John to look at his life and his values. John realizes that he 
has spent much of his life being angry at how unfair the world is. He 
recalls that in his youth he imagined making a difference in the world. 
He decides that the three core values that are most important to him are 
intellectual goals, commitment to community, and financial stability. With 
those values in mind, he develops the following mission statement:
John’s life mission statement: I commit myself to spending time pursu-
ing my interest in politics. I will attend local political meetings and learn 
about how I can participate in my community as a leader. I vow to put 15 
percent of my income into a retirement account to rebuild my finances.
John found that his life mission statement helped him clarify who he was 
and where he wanted to go in life. He realized that much of his behavior and 
focus took him away from his real goals and values. After writing his mission 
statement, he developed a deeper understanding of his identity and what his 
life is about.
The value of work
In our practice, we’ve found that work (paid 
or volunteer) is a crucial part of therapy for 
most people with BPD. Joel Paris, a renowned 
expert in the treatment of BPD, finds that help-
ing people return to school or go to work takes 
priority over working on intimate relationships. 
Work brings you into a social network where 
you can practice what you’re learning in ther-
apy. Work also reduces the time that you may 
otherwise spend ruminating about your prob-
lems. Work or school builds feelings of com-
petence and independence. Success at work 
breeds hope.
One caution: Work can be stressful. So make 
sure that you evaluate any job carefully in 
terms of pressures for productivity as well as 
long hours or potential emotional conflicts. We 
encourage our clients to consider part-time 
work or school if they’ve been out of the work-
force for a long time.
You may also want to consider going to your 
state’s department of vocational rehabilitation 
or an occupational therapist if you haven’t done 
well in previous work placements. An occupa-
tional therapist can evaluate your skills and 
guide you in a better direction.

Finally, Finding Forgiveness
You’ll likely succeed in implementing your new life mission statement with 
time, patience, and persistence. However, how bogged down you are by rage 
at other people, or even yourself, can hamper and stymie your ability to 
progress. Rage consumes huge amounts of emotional resources. Even a small 
fraction of the energy you currently devote to rage can take you a long way 
toward positively implementing your life mission.
However, learning to let go or find forgiveness can be a disturbingly difficult 
task — especially when you have good reasons for feeling enraged. But, we 
do believe that forgiveness is worth the effort. As you begin to consider for-
giveness as a step toward implementing your life mission, you need to think 
about the two types of forgiveness: forgiveness of yourself and forgiveness of 
others.
Forgiving yourself first
Many, perhaps most, people with BPD spend a lot of time feeling down about 
themselves. They usually know when their behaviors have been inappropri-
ate or have caused unnecessary harm to others or themselves. With that 
realization about their actions, they feel self-loathing and despair. Typical 
thoughts at such times include
 
✓ I’m a worthless human being.
 
✓ I’m hopeless.
 
✓ I don’t deserve to live.
 
✓ What’s wrong with me?
If you ever think the preceding thoughts, we want to remind you of an impor-
tant concept we cover in Chapter 16: Just because you feel or think some-
thing doesn’t make it true. Consider the following steps the next time you 
start beating up on yourself:
 
1. Start by acknowledging and accepting responsibility for actions you 
now deem hurtful and/or regrettable toward others or yourself.
 
 If possible, apologize or make amends if your actions involved someone 
else. If your actions harmed only you, apologize to yourself.
 
2. Appreciate the fact that you didn’t cause or ask for your BPD.
 
 Your BPD is the result of a series of complicated, interacting factors, 
which we talk about in Chapter 4. No one wants to have BPD.

215
 Chapter 17: Creating an Identity
 
3. Realize that you can’t change the past. Nothing you do now will undo 
your past actions.
 
 Focusing on past regrets absolutely prevents you from moving forward. 
Self-abuse virtually morphs into self-indulgence when it prevents you 
from making positive changes. In other words, when you stay stuck in 
self-abuse and wallow in self-loathing, you accomplish very little, and all 
you do is focus on your own issues.
 
4. Repeat the following to yourself over and over again, “I’m at where 
I’m at. All I can do is make positive steps now to get to a better place.”
 
Forgiving yourself is a long-term process. It’s not something you just decide 
to do once and then you’re done. You’re bound to fall down on this job many 
times on the way toward forgiveness. But after you begin to forgive yourself, 
you want to work on forgiving others, too.
Fumbling to forgive others
Many of our clients over the years, and especially those with BPD, have 
related stories of horrific abuse, times of unimaginable hurt, and shockingly 
difficult life circumstances involving losses, financial setbacks, and unex-
pected disappointments. Many of these events have been inflicted by cruel, 
hateful parents, family members, or peers. Are we seriously suggesting that 
you forgive these people?
We are, in fact, recommending that you do so. However, please realize that 
forgiving doesn’t mean that you’re declaring the grievous acts perpetrated 
against you acceptable. Nor does the act of forgiveness mean that you must 
discount the importance of what happened to you. Rather, forgiveness 
involves letting go of the rage, hatred, and/or desire for revenge that you 
carry around with you like a 200-pound knapsack strapped to your back 
every day of your life.
Studies have shown that coming to terms with the past through forgiveness 
allows people to lead happier, more satisfying lives. After they’re freed from 
the burdens of rage, they can move forward once again.
You may wonder how you can ever let go like we are suggesting you do. Well, 
forgiveness is a process that takes a lot of work. Here are the steps we recom-
mend you take on your path to forgiveness:
 
1. Bring the memory of the offense that someone perpetrated against 
you into your mind.
 
 However, when you do, try looking at the event from a little distance. 
Imagine that the event is occurring on a screen, as though you’re watch-
ing a movie about the event. Look at the offense as objectively and 
impartially as you possibly can.

216
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
2. Take away the perpetrator’s power.
 
 By letting go of your rage and forgiving, you drain the power away from 
the person or persons who wronged you. Imagine the perpetrator becom-
ing weak. Do not, however, imagine inflicting revenge on the perpetrator.
 
3. Imagine yourself as a coper and no longer as a victim.
 
 You accomplish this task by picturing yourself as newly empowered and 
strong as opposed to helpless and weak. Copers have dealt with equally 
difficult circumstances, too, but eventually they let go of their rage and 
move on.
 
4. Forgive.
 
 Again, when you forgive, you don’t declare that the perpetrator’s actions 
were right, acceptable, or okay. Instead, you decide to let go. Give your-
self the right to seek the life you would’ve had if the event had never 
occurred.

f you have BPD, your relationships with friends have probably been 
tumultuous, chaotic, and unsatisfying. Intimate relationships have likely 
been downright disastrous. Chapter 8 reviews some of the core reasons lying 
behind these difficulties. We encourage you to read that chapter before this 
one if you feel ready to work on improving your relationships.
Good relationships have countless benefits for people, in general. Research 
shows that people with supportive social networks have better physical and 
mental health, as well as longer lives. In fact, having people to talk to also 
seems to protect against early memory loss. With so many natural benefits, 
building better relationships should be an important part of your plan to 
overcome BPD.
In this chapter, we detail the foundational importance of understanding the 
perspectives of other people, and we show you how to do so using a few key 
strategies. We also show you how to better understand how your emotions 
and behaviors affect other people. Then we discuss how to recognize and 
minimize defensiveness when relating with others. Finally, we introduce you 
to a few of our favorite interpersonal skills that can help you create better 
relationships with friends, family, co-workers, and even strangers.

218
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Understanding Others’ Points of View
The most pivotal interpersonal skill of all is the ability to understand that 
although other people, like you, do have thoughts, opinions, and emotions, 
those thoughts, opinions, and emotions aren’t always concordant with yours. 
When you fail to grasp where others are coming from, you run a high risk 
of offending, disrespecting, hurting, or annoying them. You may also bore 
people by running on about your own issues and failing to notice the cues 
that tell you it’s time to connect with whomever you’re talking to.
This interpersonal skill involves both understanding that other people have 
independent thoughts and feelings and appreciating that other people have 
various motivations and intentions that they don’t always state openly and 
explicitly. Being able to understand the perspectives and mindsets of other 
people allows you to do the following:
 
✓ Empathize with other people
 
✓ Make sense of what others do
 
✓ Change your behavior in response to how others respond
 
✓ Predict how other people are likely to respond to you
 
✓ Understand nuances in conversations, such as sarcasm, humor, and 
teasing
 
✓ Adjust what you say in accordance to feedback from others
 
Sympathy and empathy are often used interchangeably, but they have very 
different meanings. Sympathy occurs when you share a feeling of caring or 
concern for an individual or even a group of people. For example, you may 
sympathize with the plight of the homeless. Empathy, on the other hand, 
involves being able to imagine yourself in another person’s situation. You may 
be empathetic because you experienced a similar event at some point in your 
life, or because you can truly put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Empathy 
appears to be an advanced thinking skill that varies among people — some 
people simply seem to be naturally more empathetic than others.
Projecting: Thinking others 
feel what you feel
People who have BPD develop strategies of coping that can turn out to be 
quite self-defeating in the long run. One of these coping methods involves 
taking their own painful, negative feelings or qualities and projecting them 
onto someone else. In doing so, they hope to avoid their bad feelings by 
giving them to another person.

219
 Chapter 18: Putting Yourself in Other People’s Shoes
A few examples of projecting
To clarify the concept of projecting, here are a few examples of how people 
with BPD use projection as a way to cope with the pain of negative feelings:
Connor believes that he’s horribly out of shape and will never be fit 
enough. The thought of not having a good body terrifies him. He con-
stantly nags his wife that she’s out of shape and too fat. He yells at her 
when she buys occasional cookies for their kids. He uses projection to 
defend himself against his own painful body image.
Kaylee is overwhelmed with rage after an argument with a co-worker. She 
arrives home and tells her roommate what happened. Her roommate asks 
Kaylee if maybe she’s overreacting a little. Kaylee tells her roommate to 
stay out of her business if all she can do is get angry and criticize. Kaylee 
misinterprets her roommate’s question and sees it as criticism because 
of her own anger about the situation.
Olivia’s mother is frightened and worried when she stays out all night. 
One morning when Olivia comes home, her mother is sitting in the 
kitchen and asks Olivia, “Where have you been? I was frantic with worry.” 
Olivia screams at her mother, “Every time I stay out, you treat me like I’m 
a slut.” Olivia sees her mother’s sincere concern as highly judgmental 
and critical because she’s ashamed of her own behavior.
Connor, Kaylee, and Olivia feel bad about one of their personal qualities — 
poor body image, overreacting rage, and sexual looseness, respectively. Yet, 
all three of them criticize others so that they don’t have to deal with their 
own distress and shame. In doing so, people in relationships with them feel 
unfairly maligned and don’t understand why they’re always on the receiving 
end of critical barrages.
Reducing occurrences of projecting
If you have a tendency to project your own emotions onto other people, you 
can reduce it with practice. However, you should combine your own efforts 
with work in therapy for maximum effectiveness.
The process of decreasing projection begins with increasing your self-
awareness, or honest observation and appraisal of your emotions. Look back 
at your past, rocky interactions with others. Ask yourself whether you were 
accusing others of having feelings that mirrored how you were feeling about 
yourself? If so, you want to prevent this pattern from ruining or interfering 
with your current and future relationships.
In addition, you want to tune into your emotions, especially anger and rage. 
Try to notice your body’s reactions (such as muscle tension in your chest, 
shoulders, or jaw, rapid heart rate, flushing, and sweating) that occur before 
you say something critical or before you attack someone else. When those 

220
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
physical feelings hit you, delay saying anything at all costs! Delaying your 
initial reaction may help you take a couple of slow, deep breaths instead of 
lashing out.
After you delay your reaction, ask yourself a few questions:
 
✓ Could I be feeling upset with myself?
 
✓ Did something make me feel ashamed recently?
 
✓ Am I feeling afraid of something?
 
✓ Am I worried that someone is going to abandon me?
If you answer yes to any of these questions, your anger is probably more about 
your own worries than the other person. Try to make one of the following alter-
native statements, or less-provoking statements, instead of lashing out:
 
✓ I’m feeling emotional right now; I need to get back to you on this.
 
✓ Before we go further with this, I need to take a break.
 
✓ I’ve got some things to think about before I comment on this.
 
✓ I hear you, and I promise I’ll discuss it with you when I’m feeling better.
 
Getting angry with others because of your own feelings of shame and rage 
at yourself is a long-standing habit. Changing such enduring patterns takes a 
lot of time and practice — not to mention effort. Give yourself some time and 
don’t expect instant results.
Practicing perspective taking
Although not assuming that other people feel what you feel about yourself 
is an important skill to master, perspective taking also requires you to know 
how to understand other people’s states of minds — in other words, their 
thoughts and feelings. In the following sections, we take a look at a few strate-
gies for working on this skill.
Taking turns
When emotions run hot, the intensity of distress tends to consume all your 
focus and attention. And, unfortunately, emotions frequently run hot in 
people with BPD. Think of the brain as having only so much room — when 
filled with emotion, thinking skills are overwhelmed.
At such times, the temptation to talk on and on to whomever will listen about 
whatever you’re feeling is hard to fight. But if you give into that temptation, 
you likely miss seeing that the person you’re talking to is becoming restless, 
bored, and/or burned out.

221
 Chapter 18: Putting Yourself in Other People’s Shoes
One way to fight this temptation is to work on forcing yourself to “take turns” 
in most, if not all, of your conversations. Just as parents teach their kids to 
share and take turns, you need to teach yourself to take turns when you con-
verse with other people. In the process, you’re likely to learn a lot about what 
the person you’re talking to is thinking and feeling.
 
A good rule of thumb is to try to take up half of the conversation time and to 
let the person you’re conversing with take up the other half. Asking a lot of 
questions can help you accomplish this goal, and we cover this strategy in the 
next section.
Asking questions
When you show interest in other people, they’re much more likely to feel 
interested in you. Not only do questions keep conversations flowing, but they 
also help you show the person you’re talking to that you’re interested in him 
and the topic at hand. You can then use the answers to your questions to 
infer what the other person may be thinking.
When you ask questions, try to listen carefully to the answers. Consider 
following up the answer with another question related to what you heard. 
Again, doing so keeps the conversation going and maintains interest in both 
parties. See the “Listening” section later in this chapter for more thoughts 
about this issue.
 
When people answer your questions, try not to see their intentions as mali-
cious, and do your best to hold back your defensive responses. Check out the 
“Decreasing Defensiveness” section for more information about this issue.
Perhaps you’re wondering what kinds of questions to ask people you’re talk-
ing to. Although almost any question can be helpful, we realize that you may 
want a few examples to build on. The following list, though far from exhaus-
tive, is applicable to many different situations:
 
✓ Can you tell me more about that? (Shrinks love asking this one.)
 
✓ How did you learn about that?
 
✓ Is this something you feel strongly about?
 
✓ How do you feel about this issue?
 
✓ Tell me something about yourself. (Okay, this one isn’t exactly a ques-
tion, but it accomplishes the same goal.)
 
✓ Have you ever run into something like this in your life?
 
✓ How do you handle this kind of thing?

Work hard to ask your questions in a gentle, inquisitive tone. Avoid any hint of 
sarcasm or accusatory slant. Failing to do so can defeat the purpose of helping 
you develop and maintain relationships.
Considering alternative meanings and motivations
People with BPD tend to misconstrue the meanings and intentions of other 
people’s words. All too often they infer malicious, attacking intentions from 
the words of others. This misinterpretation is known as the malicious assump-
tion. After you make a malicious assumption, a counterattack is virtually 
inevitable.
Work with your therapist to review some of your past conversations that 
turned out badly. Your therapist can help you develop less malicious and 
judgmental interpretations that are, as a matter of fact, more likely to be 
correct.
The following examples in Table 18-1 show how someone with BPD can easily 
make malicious assumptions about other people’s relatively neutral state-
ments. The table also shows examples of nonjudgmental interpretations of 
the same neutral statements.
Table 18-1 
Assumptions about Neutral Statements
Neutral Statement
Malicious Assumption
Nonjudgmental 
Assumption
Did you get the mail today?
He’s saying that I never 
do anything without 
being reminded first.
He’s just curious 
about the mail.
How are you feeling today?
He’s saying that I look 
sick and old.
He truly wants to 
know how I feel.
Gosh, getting to the store is 
taking a long time.
He’s saying that I don’t 
drive fast enough.
He’s right. Traffic 
is really bad today.
If you find yourself making malicious assumptions, you’re likely to have a lot 
of negative interactions. These assumptions not only make you unhappy, but 
they also add to the stress in your life. In addition, malicious assumptions 
take a toll on the quality of all your relationships.
 
Occasionally, malicious assumptions prove to be true. In other words, some-
times people really are expressing hostility. However, you have nothing to 
lose by believing in the nonjudgmental assumptions. More often than not, 
your nonjudgmental assumption is right, and by holding back your malicious 

223
 Chapter 18: Putting Yourself in Other People’s Shoes
assumption — thus avoiding a counterattack — you avoid turning an innocent 
conversation into an argumentative debacle. Not to mention, you can maintain 
or improve your relationships, too.
Bridget’s story illustrates the reflexive tendency many people with BPD have 
to make malicious assumptions about other people’s motivations. If you tend 
to make malicious assumptions, taking some time to think through your past 
heated conversations (like Bridget does with her therapist) can help you 
identify more realistic and positive, nonjudgmental assumptions.
Bridget sees Dr. Rodriguez twice a week for therapy. She’s currently 
working on improving her ability to understand other people. She tells 
Dr. Rodriguez about an incident she had with a friend last week.
“So, my friend calls me and asks me if I want to go shopping,” Bridget 
explains, “I tell her yeah, but not today. And my friend says that she’ll go 
without me. So, that made me mad, like if I don’t do what she wants when 
she wants, she’s just going to dump me. I told her fine — find another 
friend to go shopping with. Then she seemed surprised that I got mad and 
asked me what was wrong with me. So, not only does she dump me, but 
she tells me I’m crazy, too. I don’t get it. Why are people so mean to me?”
“Bridget, let’s use what you just told me to practice taking another per-
son’s point of view. First, your friend asked you to go shopping. Tell me 
what she may have meant by that,” Dr Rodriguez gently inquires.
“Well, that’s easy — she wanted someone to go shopping with her,” 
Bridget responds.
“What did that invitation tell you about how she feels about you?”
“I guess that meant she wanted me to go shopping.”
Dr. Rodriquez probes further, “Do you think she was saying that she 
wants your company? Does she like you?”
Bridget replies, “Yeah, she wanted to spend time with me. And I suppose 
that means she likes me. I never really thought about that.”
“So next you tell her that you can’t go, and she says that she’ll go without 
you. What did that mean?”
“That meant that she didn’t care about me,” Bridget responds.
“Really? Is there any other reason why she may have said that?” Dr. 
Rodriguez asks.
“I don’t know. I guess she could’ve meant that she needed to go shopping 
that day. Right, like you have pointed out a million times before, maybe it 
didn’t have anything to do with not liking me. But she had no right to call 
me crazy.”

224
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Dr. Rodriguez says, “I’m not sure I heard when she said you’re crazy. You 
said she asked what was wrong with you. Could she have been trying to 
convey any other meaning?”
“None that I can think of. She was being really rude.”
“Well,” Dr. Rodriguez continues, “Is it possible that she was expressing 
frustration with you? In other words, could she have been flustered and 
upset by your anger and simply didn’t know what to make of it? Was she 
necessarily saying that you’re crazy?”
Bridget hesitates and says, “Hmm, I suppose that’s possible. You have 
pointed out that I tend to see the worst possible meaning in what people 
say. You really think she was just frustrated with me?”
“Yes, I really do. You went from a conversation about shopping to accus-
ing her of abandoning you over nothing. This assumption makes perfect 
sense to you because being abandoned is one of your core fears. But 
other people don’t understand how sensitive that issue is for you.”
Bridget reflects a moment and says, “Wow, you’ve given me a lot to think 
about.”
Bridget misinterpreted her friend’s meaning, and this misinterpretation led 
her to accuse her friend of wanting to end their relationship. When her friend 
asked Bridget, “What’s wrong?” she believed her friend was calling her crazy. 
Her therapist helps her see the other, more realistic ways she could’ve inter-
preted the conversation.
Like Bridget, people with BPD are often reasonably good at reading others, 
but they greatly magnify the negativity in most conversations. If a statement 
can be taken negatively, they take it that way. People with BPD see even neu-
tral comments as being tinged with hostility.
 
Feelings, even strong, negative feelings are neither good nor bad. You have the 
right to feel what you feel. What matters is how you act on your feelings.
Noticing Your Impact on Others
People with BPD commonly don’t fully appreciate or even recognize how 
their behavior affects the people who care about them. Because their own 
overwhelming emotions consume their attention, they don’t attend carefully 
to other people’s reactions. These communication breakdowns are part of 
the expression–disconnection–rejection cycle, which starts when people with 
BPD overly focus on expressing their own emotions and concerns. As their 
conversations wear on, other people feel a lack of connection with them, and 
as a result, they may ultimately reject the people with BPD.

225
 Chapter 18: Putting Yourself in Other People’s Shoes
Indeed, if you have BPD, you run a high risk of rejection from other people. 
We won’t pull any punches here. However, the reason for this rejection isn’t 
because you’re an awful person. It’s because you may not understand how 
your behavior or words affect other people.
 
One way to start understanding your impact on other people is to start look-
ing at people’s faces. Practice noticing different expressions. See whether or 
not you can figure out the difference in facial expressions when people are 
tired, bored, irritated, enthusiastic, sad, neutral, happy, and truly angry. Also 
pay attention to other people’s voice tones and gestures. Begin this practice 
with people who are talking to other people, and then apply your skills to 
people who are talking to you.
Although realizing your impact on other people is an important step in 
achieving your overall goal of better understanding other people, you also 
need to work on reducing defensiveness. If you’re not sure what defensive-
ness means, read the next section.
Decreasing Defensiveness
Defensiveness refers to the habit of warding off perceived attacks, assaults, 
and criticisms with retaliatory statements. We aren’t talking about physical 
attacks here. Rather, we’re talking about the times when you perceive other 
people as being critical of you. People with BPD often react to these imagined 
assaults by counterattacking, which can include blaming others or turning up 
the heat on the conversation by lacing your words with sarcasm or hostility.
 
Remember that anybody who’s feeling intense anger is far less able to think 
or perceive interactions accurately than someone who’s feeling calm and 
relaxed. The responses of people who are intensely angry are inappropriate 
99.2 percent of the time — well, we made that number up, but you get the 
point. When you’re mad, your thinking skills just aren’t at full capacity. The 
following three strategies can help you combat defensiveness.
Taking the “I” out of interactions
Defensive people focus their attention on themselves. They don’t necessar-
ily believe they’re better or more important than others, but they do believe, 
in a sense, that the world revolves around them. In other words, they’re 
constantly in the spotlight — but that spotlight can shine much too brightly. 
Consider that when everything in life has personal significance, all the good 
and bad things that happen affect your feelings and moods.

226
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Taking things too personally is a common communication problem, espe-
cially for people with personality disorders, including BPD. Here are a few 
examples of this problem in action:
 
✓ A patron at a restaurant becomes furious when she has to wait for ser-
vice because a couple of the wait staff called in sick and there aren’t 
enough waiters available for the crowd. She’s so rude to her waiter that 
others at her table are embarrassed. The waiter apologizes and explains 
that they’re short staffed, but the patron refuses to accept the apology. 
Instead, she feels that the restaurant is somehow singling her out for 
bad treatment.
 
✓ A driver becomes infuriated when a train crossing delays his commute 
to work. His blood pressure rises as he watches the train pass by in 
front of him. He wonders why trains always seem to interrupt his com-
mute when he’s already late.
 
✓ An ER physician calls a neurologist to schedule a consultation with 
him and becomes sarcastic and enraged when the neurologist asks a 
few questions about the patient before scheduling the meeting. The ER 
doctor feels personally insulted by the neurologist’s failure to jump into 
his car and come to the ER without questioning the doctor’s judgment.
 
✓ A man becomes enraged after his computer keyboard stops working. 
After getting a replacement, his anger interferes with his ability to get 
back to work. He believes that computer problems happen to him far 
more often than they should.
The key problem in all four examples is that each person believes that the 
incident somehow has a negative, personal meaning. Even random events 
like computer breakdowns and train crossings become personal. If you tend 
to personalize events like the people in these examples do, it’s time to work 
on this issue. The following steps can help:
 
1. Slow down and take two or three slow, deep breaths.
 
2. Ask yourself whether the irritating event is truly centered on you or 
whether it’s possibly just circumstances or bad luck.
 
3. Ask yourself whether getting upset and angry will have some benefit 
for you.
 
4. Ponder whether your anger could hurt someone around you or your-
self, for that matter.
 
5. Consider telling yourself, “Stuff happens — not everything is 
about me.”

227
 Chapter 18: Putting Yourself in Other People’s Shoes
Putting a friend on your side
Some of our patients over the years have found our second technique to be 
surprisingly useful in defeating defensiveness. This technique asks you to 
imagine an objective observer sitting on your shoulder to provide you with 
sage advice and guidance in a clutch. Your observer’s task is to notice when 
you’re feeling irritated, angry, or threatened. At those times, your observer 
should offer you some helpful advice, such as the following:
 
✓ Slow down. You’re going to make things much worse if you speak 
right now.
 
✓ What do you have to lose by assuming that he’s not attacking you?
 
✓ Let’s try something different from the usual blow up this time, okay?
 
✓ I’m here to help, remember? Say something positive instead.
 
✓ How many times has exploding helped the situation?
 
✓ What is he going to think and feel if you say this? How would you feel if 
someone said that to you?
 
✓ How about you actually try complimenting him instead of ripping him 
apart like you want to?
After listening to your objective observer’s advice, work hard to follow it! 
This technique can really help you if you practice it. It’s not likely to work 
well the first few times you try it, but over time, you’ll hear these calming 
words coming from the observer more and more often.
 
Some people jot down the preceding phrases on an index card and read them 
every day to remind their objective observer to use them when things start to 
deteriorate.
Musing over defusing
A great alternative to becoming defensive is called defusing. When you per-
ceive someone as being critical of you, defusing can keep things calm instead 
of encouraging escalation. Defusing involves doing the opposite of what you 
feel like doing: Instead of counterattacking, you try to find some sliver of 
truth in what the other person has just said to you. When you express actual 
agreement of a small part (sometimes even all) of what someone has said, 
you keep the dialogue going and gradually let out the steam from the conver-
sational pressure cooker that may have been ready to explode.

228
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
To clarify, defusing doesn’t mean capitulating or lying to the person you’re 
talking with. Instead, defusing represents an honest attempt to find some-
thing about the other person’s perspective that you can truly endorse. Table 
18-2 shows you how you can use defusing in response to various types of 
criticisms. For these examples, we use situations that sound clearly critical 
even to us. However, you can also use defusing when you’re not certain your 
perception is correct.
Table 18-2 
Defusing Defensiveness
Criticism
Defusing Response
You’re yelling at the kids too 
much.
Sometimes I do yell. That’s one reason I’m in 
therapy. I get frustrated too easily. But try to tell 
me more gently if you can.
You’re spending way too 
much money on junk.
That’s something I do need to watch, and I’m 
trying. I’m hoping that using the computer to 
track my expenses will help me.
I can’t believe you got 
another speeding ticket.
You’re right, I did. However, that’s the first one in 
a year; that’s a big improvement for me.
You always leave dirty, smelly 
dishes in the sink.
I understand that you feel upset. However, I 
don’t care quite as much as you do about a few 
dishes. Can we work out a compromise on this?
 
Defusing isn’t the way to deal with clear-cut, egregious verbal or physical 
abuse. If you’re in that kind of situation, you need to seek help from your 
therapist, a shelter for domestic violence, or, in violent situations, from the 
police. Sometimes people don’t know for sure whether they’re being abused. If 
that situation fits you, a trip to a mental health professional can help you sort 
it out.
Getting Along Better
People with BPD often lack sufficient social skills to maintain and nourish 
good interpersonal relationships. Loss and conflict often characterize their 
romantic lives. This section describes some basic ways to improve social 
interactions.
If you have BPD, we recommend that you practice the following skills with 
acquaintances or friends. Try to increase your interpersonal skills with 
people you don’t have intense relationships with before you attempt to work 

229
 Chapter 18: Putting Yourself in Other People’s Shoes
on more intimate relationships. Expect that these strategies will feel some-
what awkward and uncomfortable at first. However, with a little practice, 
you’ll likely find that they become second nature.
Listening
Listening to others not only conveys interest, but also helps develop your 
perspective-taking skills. Listening is both a skill and a habit that you have 
to nurture. With practice, listening becomes natural. You may think you’re 
already a good listener. If so, you may not need to work on this issue. But 
before you make that decision, consider asking some people whether they 
think you could improve your listening skills. If they say yes, try to avoid 
becoming defensive!
Giving compliments
Giving compliments not only makes other people feel better, but also 
increases your own self-confidence. You will gain confidence when people 
respond positively to your efforts. Make it a goal to give out at least two 
compliments each day. We predict that you’ll find this practice fulfilling and 
worthwhile. Follow these guidelines when giving compliments:
 
✓ Be specific. Don’t make grand, global statements like, “You’re the best 
person in the whole world,” because most people won’t believe you. 
Instead, find something smaller and more concrete like, “I loved the way 
you handled that sales meeting,” or “This dinner is delicious.”
 
✓ Don’t throw in negatives with the positives. For example, don’t say, “I 
loved the way you handled that sales meeting, especially after the horri-
ble job you did last week,” or “This dinner is delicious. I wish you could 
cook like this every night.”
If you haven’t given compliments in a while, other people may react strangely 
at first. They may wonder what you’re up to and perhaps even become a little 
sarcastic. However, we recommend that you keep trying. Over time, they’ll 
get used to the new you, and they’ll likely respond quite well to the change.
Pillowing rather than pillorying
People with BPD often report difficulty in getting their needs met by other 
people. They complain that others don’t hear them or that they don’t feel 

230
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
comfortable asking directly for what they want. We have a strategy that 
may make getting your needs met a little easier. This technique is called 
pillowing — as opposed to pillorying. When you pillory someone, you dish 
out abuse, contempt, and ridicule. How likely are other people to listen and 
do what you want when you resort to pillorying? Not very.
With pillowing, however, you soften the blow as much as you can, while still 
clearly stating what you want. You can accomplish pillowing by using some 
simple phrases. These phrases can help you point out that you’re not the one 
and only owner of truth and wisdom in the world. In other words, they help 
you acknowledge that your point of view may be somewhat flawed. And, in 
truth, it always is — for all people, whether they have BPD or not.
Here are some sample statements that can help you develop your pillowing 
technique. They can be very useful when you’re trying to fill your needs or 
requests of other people. The pillowing phrase is in boldface:
 
✓ I could be off base, but I was wondering whether what you said was 
intended to hurt me?
 
✓ Maybe I’m being overly sensitive, but I can’t hear you when you use 
that tone of voice.
 
✓ I realize that this could be an annoying request, but I’m feeling so over-
whelmed; would you mind taking over for a little while?
 
✓ I could be wrong, but it feels like you’re upset with me.
 
You don’t want to make excessive use of pillowing, because, if you do, others 
will find it a bit contrived. But the technique does make expressing your needs 
easier to do. Statements like the preceding examples also help you feel like 
you’re being less demanding of people. Furthermore, the technique makes 
hearing you an easier task for other people to accomplish. Of course, we could 
be wrong about that!

Problematic Core Beliefs
In This Chapter
▶ Using different strategies to monitor your schemas
▶ Living with new, more adaptive schemas
I
n Chapter 9, we discuss how the way you perceive or interpret events 
can greatly influence your feelings about what’s going on around you. In 
a very real sense, your emotional reactions come at least as much from your 
interpretations as from the events themselves.
For example, if a friend tells you, “You’re usually pretty fun to be around,” 
your feelings about the statement will spring from the meaning you give to 
it. If you believe your friend’s comment is a compliment, you probably feel 
quite pleased. On the other hand, if you believe that people almost always 
reject you, you probably zero in on the word usually. Thus, you may conclude 
that your friend is really saying that you come up short in the fun category. 
As a result, you likely feel distraught. Schemas, or the core beliefs that you 
hold about yourself, the world around you, and the people you relate to, are 
responsible for how you habitually interpret events.
In this chapter, we focus on how to change the schemas that keep you from 
seeing your life clearly. We provide a range of strategies you can use to start 
challenging your schemas. Then we guide you through techniques for acquir-
ing new, more adaptive schemas that can help you feel better about your life.
Schema Busting Strategies
Before you can change your problematic schemas, you have to fully under-
stand what those schemas are and where they come from. Please realize that 
countless problematic schemas are possible and that no matter how hard you 
look, you won’t find a definitive list. Any broad, problematic and long-standing 

232
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
belief that you hold about yourself or the world may be a schema worthy of 
your attention.
 
Chapter 9 covers schemas in detail, including what schemas are, where they 
come from, how they work, and which ones you likely have. Table 19-1 pro-
vides a brief summary so that you don’t have to flip back and forth.

People sometimes flip from one problematic schema to its opposite. Other 
times, folks may experience a problematic schema, its opposite, and occasion-
ally its adaptive counterpart. The key is to know which problematic schemas 
you experience frequently and then to work on weakening those particular 
schemas. Later in this chapter, we show you how to strengthen adaptive 
schemas.
 
Don’t beat yourself up if you see that you frequently experience a variety of 
problematic schemas, or even all of the ones we mention in the previous table. 
As you work on one or two problematic schemas, others sometimes begin 
to lessen their influence over your life, too. With time and diligence, you can 
change your schemas for the better. The sections that follow show you some 
ways to start this process of change.
Recognizing the effects of 
schemas on your feelings
One of the best ways to reduce the influence that schemas have on your life 
is to shine a light on them and track where and when they occur. Schemas 
are sort of like cockroaches; they prefer to operate in the dark nooks and 
crannies of your mind. As you observe your schemas at work, you’ll come to 
understand that your emotional reactions aren’t an inherent part of who you 
are — they stem directly from your schemas. And you’re not the same thing 
as your schemas.

234
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
See Chapter 16 for a discussion about how you can observe or monitor your 
mind and emotions. In this section, we ask you to call on that part of you to 
look at your own schemas and the effects they have on your feelings.
If you start to observe your own schemas day to day, you’re bound to under-
stand more fully why you think and feel the way you do. In addition, as you 
realize that your schemas — not you — are flawed, your schemas are likely 
to exert less influence on you and your feelings. Observing your schemas just 
takes practice. See Appendix B for a blank Schema Monitoring Form. We rec-
ommend that you fill out this form every week for several months. Here are 
the steps you take to fill out each form:
 
1. When you feel distressed, try to figure out what event seemed to trig-
ger your feeling.
 
 Jot down at the top of the form what that event was. The event can be 
something that actually happened to you or an image that came into 
your mind. Describe the event clearly.
 
2. Jot down in the middle column what thoughts, perceptions, interpre-
tations, or meanings the event had for you.
 
 In other words, make note of what thoughts were going through your 
head when the event actually occurred.
 
3. In the right-hand column, make note of how you feel about the event.
 
 If you have trouble labeling your feelings, consider reading Chapter 6, 
which explains bodily sensations and words that describe feelings.
 
4. Go through Table 19-1 to discover whether one of your problematic 
schemas is related to your thoughts and feelings.
 
 If so, make note of that schema and the related feeling. You may con-
clude that more than one schema seems to apply, which is okay. Jot 
down however many schemas seem to be involved. Briefly describe 
your schema based on our definition, or individualize how that schema 
seems to apply to you.
 
Monitoring your schemas is like exposing a vampire to sunlight. Keep observ-
ing them over and over again, and, as you do, they begin to wither.
 
The difference between thoughts and schemas is that schemas are general, 
broad beliefs that continue from event to event. Thoughts, on the other hand, 
are specific to a given event. The following examples of Melissa, Amanda, and 
Caleb show you how three people can experience the exact same event yet 
react with completely different thoughts and feelings because each of them 
carries around different schemas.

235
 Chapter 19: Finding Shades of Gray: Changing Problematic Core Beliefs
Melissa, Amanda, and Caleb all like to eat out at restaurants when their 
budgets allow them to, and, on occasion, the service is poor. These 
three individuals have completely different responses and feelings to 
poor service because each one of them has a different primary schema: 
Melissa views the event through an undeserving schema, Amanda views 
the event through a dangerous schema, and Caleb views the event

Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
The examples of Melissa, Amanda, and Caleb illustrate how powerfully your 
schemas affect your thoughts and feelings when things happen to you. Note 
that all three people experienced the same event, but their schemas led them 
to profoundly different reactions.
Exorcising problematic childhood schemas
People acquire their schemas in childhood. At that time, schemas often make 
a lot of sense because schemas represent your mind’s attempt to figure out 
your world. Thus, most people’s schemas represent their way of interpreting 
how their parents raised them, as well as how their teachers, friends, and 
relatives treated them. So what’s the problem with schemas if they’re simply 
the brain’s way of making sense of the world?
Your schemas aren’t problematic if the world of your childhood was healthy, 
balanced, and reasonably predictable. Unfortunately, this description doesn’t 
fit with the way most people with BPD describe their childhoods. Often, 
the childhood worlds of people with BPD were chaotic, unpredictable, and 
riddled with extreme parenting messages — both overly harsh, demanding 
messages (such as “You’re a pathetic, clumsy oaf!”) and unrealistically posi-
tive messages (such as “You’re the best kid in the entire world; there’s noth-
ing you can’t do!”).
Not surprisingly, the schemas of people with BPD tend to be extreme and 
often lead to overwhelming emotions. Given the world their schemas evolved 
in, these tendencies are reasonable and, well, rather normal. But the world 
usually changes as people grow up. In the adult world, most people don’t 
treat one another in the same extreme ways that the parents of people with 
BPD treated them.
Don’t despair. You can use the Then and Now Form in Appendix B to help 
you see that the events that trigger your schemas today typically pale in 
comparison to the events that created them in your childhood. Feel free to 
make as many copies of this form as you need for your personal use. Here’s 
how you use the form:
 
1. Write down your problematic schema in the left-hand column (see 
Table 19-1 for examples of problematic schemas).

237
 Chapter 19: Finding Shades of Gray: Changing Problematic Core Beliefs
 
 Describe how this particular schema plays out in your life. You can 
either use the definition we provide in Table 19-1 or individualize your 
definition, using your own words. Don’t forget that some people experi-
ence opposite schemas in various situations. Include both opposites if 
you experience them.
 
2. Jot down one or more recollections from your childhood that may 
have helped create this schema.
 
3. Write down the events or happenings that tend to trigger this schema 
for you in your current life.
 
 Notice how old you feel when an event triggers your schema.
 
4. Remind yourself that you’re older today, that the current trigger-
ing events aren’t usually as significant as the events that created 
your schemas, and that, with time, your mind will see the difference 
between the events of your childhood and those of the present.
 
Be patient; fully distinguishing between then and now takes time.
Jennifer’s story demonstrates how someone with BPD can use the Then and 
Now Form to help the mind break the connection between the triggers that 
set certain problematic schemas off today and the events that created them 
during childhood. Jennifer’s form appears in Table 19-5.
Jennifer is a 38-year-old real estate agent who has been in therapy for a 
couple of months. She has an interesting pattern of problematic schemas 
that includes the dangerous schema, the anxious attachment schema, 
and flipping inordinately between the entitlement and undeserving sche-
mas. Her psychologist recommends that she fill out a Then and Now 
Form to help her see that events triggering her problematic schemas 
today are relatively mild compared to her childhood experiences.
Jennifer fills out her Then and Now Form regularly each week for about 
two months. She constantly compares and contrasts the events that 
helped shape her problematic schemas in her childhood with happen-
ings that trigger them in her world today. She sees that relatively trivial 
events trigger these schemas now, whereas the events that shaped them 
in her childhood had far greater significance, at least to a child. This real-
ization helps Jennifer forgive herself for having these schemas and also 
allows her to view present-day realities in a more realistic way.

Problematic Schema
Image(s) of Childhood 
Origins
Current Triggers
Dangerous: I panic 
and worry constantly 
about my safety.
Our neighborhood was 
horrible. We had gangs 
and even an occasional 
drive-by shooting. My 
mother used to warn me 
constantly about crimi-
nals and other dangers 
in the world.
Whenever I have to leave 
the house for more than 
an hour, whether I’m 
going shopping or just 
running an errand, I feel a 
sense of dread. If some-
one says hi to me, I freak 
out.
Anxious attachment: 
I get so jealous and 
clingy all the time. I 
can’t stand the idea 
of being abandoned, 
but I always seem 
to be abandoned 
anyway.
In spite of all her warn-
ings about dangers in 
the world, my mother 
got really angry with me 
whenever I messed up. 
Then she stomped out 
of the house and left 
me alone in the house 
by myself for several 
hours. I was only 8 years 
old, and I was scared to 
death.
Even the slightest criti-
cism or negative word 
out of a boyfriend makes 
me feel like I’m 8 years 
old again. I panic inside, 
and my stomach does flip-
flops. My panic causes 
me to cling. Also, when-
ever a boyfriend is a few 
minutes late, I accuse him 
of seeing someone else.
Entitlement and 
undeserving: I usually 
feel totally undeserv-
ing and unworthy of 
having my needs met. 
But, on rare occa-
sions when someone 
denies me what I 
want, I explode with 
rage as though I’m 
the most entitled 
person in the world.
My parents both viewed 
children as something to 
be seen and not heard. 
They rarely showed 
regard for us. Whenever 
I asked if I could go play 
at another kid’s house, 
my mother would say 
she didn’t have time to 
drag me around.
If I have a favor I want to 
ask someone for, I can 
rarely do so. I feel so 
incredibly undeserving. 
But, whenever I do ask for 
something and get turned 
down, I feel abused. At 
those times, I feel like the 
little kid again and like 
people don’t respect my 
basic needs.
Tabulating a cost-benefit analysis
Changing schemas can be a daunting task because your mind so fervently 
believes in the truth of your schemas and sees them as being beneficial. The 
idea that your mind actually thinks your schemas help you may seem coun-
terintuitive to you. How does someone see a dangerous schema as useful? 
Perhaps a few examples can help you better understand this concept. In the 

239
 Chapter 19: Finding Shades of Gray: Changing Problematic Core Beliefs
following list, we describe a few of the benefits people may see in keeping 
their problematic schemas. These benefits usually come in the form of fears 
about what would happen if people let go of their schemas.
 
✓ Dangerous: If a woman with this schema chooses to no longer believe in 
this schema, she gravely fears that she’ll put herself in needless danger 
because she’ll no longer be hypervigilant about her safety.
 
✓ Inferiority: If a man with this problematic schema decides he’s not going 
to believe in his inferiority anymore, he knows that he may be inclined 
to try giving public speeches (something he’s avoided his entire life). 
However, he doesn’t challenge his schema by making speeches because 
he so strongly believes in his inferiority and “knows” that he will surely 
fail if he tries.
 
✓ Entitlement: A woman may hold this problematic schema because she’s 
terribly worried that her needs must be met all the time. She fears that if 
she becomes less demanding, people will walk all over her.
Fortunately, you can find a way out of this schema dilemma — it’s called 
a cost-benefit analysis. A cost-benefit analysis can help you scrutinize your 
problematic schemas and determine whether they’re as beneficial as you 
think or they’re causing you far more harm than you realize.
Here are the specific steps you want to take in conducting a cost-benefit anal-
ysis of your problematic schemas. You can find a blank Cost-Benefit Analysis 
Form for your use in Appendix B.
 
1. Jot down one of your problematic schemas that seems to get in your 
way, along with its definition (see Table 19-1 for examples of problem-
atic schemas).
 
 Feel free to individualize the definition to make it describe the way this 
schema works in your life.
 
2. Write down any and all conceivable ways in which your schema 
seems to benefit you or protect you from harm. Take your time.
 
3. Jot down any ways in which you can imagine that your problematic 
schema costs you something.
 
 Sometimes you can start by reviewing the benefits and writing out how 
they may not actually be true. For example, if you have a dangerous 
schema and believe that one benefit is that the schema keeps you safe 
from all danger, you can question whether attempting to avoid all risks 
can ever really work for anyone. In other words, is there truly a way to 
avoid lightening strikes, natural disasters, or other random accidents? 
The answer is no. So your dangerous schema really just prevents you 
from taking part in everyday life.

240
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
4. Carefully mull over your cost-benefit analysis.
 
 Decide whether your schema provides more costs or benefits to your 
life. Discuss your results with your therapist.
 
A cost-benefit analysis is a good tool, but it’s only one of many ways to work 
on your problematic schemas. This kind of work takes time. Be patient with 
yourself.
Shannon’s story demonstrates how someone can use a cost-benefit analysis 
to help her see that a couple of her problematic schemas are doing more to 
get in the way of her life than to help her.
Shannon has worked as a retail clerk at a department store for the past 
year. She has held this job longer than any other over the past fifteen 
years since she graduated from high school. She has BPD and began 
psychotherapy about three months ago. She and her psychologist, Dr. 
Bashan, have identified one schema that gets in her way more than any 
other — anxious attachment. Although her therapist has suggested a 
variety of ways to start dismantling this schema, she has resisted making 
the attempt.
At one of their appointments, Dr. Bashan says, “Shannon, I can see that 
you’re pretty reluctant to tackle your anxious attachment schema.”
Shannon replies, “Yes, I know what you say makes sense, but I just can’t 
seem to get myself to try the things you’ve suggested.”
“Actually, I think you’ve struggled for very good reasons,” Dr. Bashan 
continues, “I think I’ve been suggesting that you take action against this 
schema before you’re ready.”
“How is that, doctor? I thought you knew everything and had all the 
answers.”
Dr. Bashan raises his eyebrows and says, “If only that were true. I think 
I goofed up in this case. I’ve been recommending that you try to change 
something that your mind assumes is beneficial. I think we need to exam-
ine that assumption with a cost-benefit analysis. Let’s write down every 
conceivable way that your schemas may benefit you. Then we can look at 
how those same schemas may cost you something, too.”
Shannon says, “I thought problematic schemas were always bad and hurt 
you. What are you saying?”
“Well, at the end of the day, they probably do hurt you, but you wouldn’t 
hold onto your schemas if they didn’t at least feel like they held some 
benefits. How about we try to look at the costs and benefits of your sche-
mas?” Dr. Bashan gently suggests.
Table 19-6 shows what Shannon comes up with in terms of the benefits of 
her anxious attachment schema.

This belief helps me be on the alert for any early 
warning sign that a new person is losing inter-
est. I don’t get caught by surprise that way.
I won’t be hurt so badly if I’m aware of what’s 
coming.
This schema makes me very good about staying 
in close touch with anyone who matters to me.
People think I’m great at being thoughtful.
Now Shannon sees why she’s been reluctant to give up this schema. It 
seems to have some terrific benefits for her. However, Dr. Bashan recom-
mends that she fill out the column labeled Costs next. Table 19-7 shows 
what her complete analysis looks like.

that I drive people nuts.

The truth is I think that antici-
pating someone leaving me 
hurts just as bad as when I 
don’t.
This schema makes me very good about staying 
in close touch with anyone who matters to me.
A lot of people have told me 
that I stay so close that they 
feel suffocated.
People think I’m great at being thoughtful.
This schema makes me feel 
ridiculously dependent on 
other people.
I think this schema makes 
people more likely to leave me.

242
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Shannon reviews the cost-benefit analysis of her anxious attachment 
schema and concludes, “As I really look this over, I can see where my 
schema has been hurting me a lot more than it has been helping. Even 
some of the benefits don’t appear all that beneficial when I think about 
them. I should be able to change this schema now.”
Dr. Bashan warns, “Well, I think the cost-benefit analysis is a great start. 
But don’t underestimate the power of schemas. Changing your problem-
atic schemas and adopting new, more positive ones is going to take a lot 
more work and effort.”
Adopting Adaptive Schemas
The preceding “Schema Busting Strategies” section presents several tech-
niques for reducing the frequency and impact of your problematic schemas. 
Now it’s time to work on increasing the frequency of your adaptive schemas, 
or schemas that are less extreme and that can help you get along better with 
others, see the world more realistically, and see yourself more like others do. 
You can increase the frequency of adaptive schemas in two ways — through 
taking direct actions and by using schema flash cards.
Taking the direct approach
Direct actions help establish and reinforce your adaptive schemas. Direct 
actions are things you do to strengthen your adaptive schemas. Note that 
everyone, including people with BPD, sometimes act in ways that are con-
sistent with adaptive schemas. Taking direct, supportive actions increases 
the percentage of time you spend with adaptive schemas and decreases the 
amount of time you spend with problematic ones.
If you’re troubled by one of the problematic schemas in Table 19-1, look 
at the Adaptive Schema Action List in Table 19-8 for ideas about how to 
strengthen your adaptive schemas in the schema dimensions that affect 
you. Take note that the actions in Table 19-8 are just the start. Be creative 
and come up with others on your own, or work with your therapist to devise 
more possibilities.

ability to control. I’ll have a Plan B and a Plan C if things 
don’t work out.
* I will start keeping track of when things work out versus 
when they don’t. I think I usually forget about things that 
really do work out okay.

Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
The Adaptive Schema Action List in Table 19-8 only scratches the surface of 
possibilities. Use your creativity and/or consult with friends or your thera-
pist for more ideas. Some of the actions in our list may fit your situation, but 
others may not. Even if you don’t see ideas that are relevant to your life in 
our examples, we’re confident that you can come up with some of your own.
 
Choosing actions that you feel are doable is important. If you try out an idea 
that seems unmanageable, see whether you can break it down into smaller 
steps. You don’t get extra points for making larger steps; you still get to the 
goal line when you go one small step at a time.
Staying on track with flash cards
Another strategy for strengthening your adaptive schemas is to use some-
thing called schema flash cards. These flash cards organize information from 
the strategies we describe throughout this chapter into convenient 4-x-6 
cards. The cards also add one more element: self-accepting statements.
Self-accepting statements are designed for you to use when you find yourself 
slipping and not making the changes or taking the actions you want to take. 
Inevitably, you will slip and slide at times. When you do, just accept the slip 
and forgive yourself for being human.
See the full instructions for filling out a schema flash card in Table 19-9.

245
 Chapter 19: Finding Shades of Gray: Changing Problematic Core Beliefs
Schema flash cards can help you in several ways. First, they remind you of 
what you want to say or do when you mess up and exhibit one of your prob-
lematic schemas. In other words, they remind you of your self-accepting 
statements, which is important because problematic schemas tend to erase 
all other realities. Think about this situation: The last time you experienced 
a serious setback that set off your inferiority schema, you probably couldn’t 
recall a single positive attribute or ability about yourself. Later, after you 
moved past the incident, you found that some of those positive aspects were 
easier to recall. In addition to reminding you of your self-accepting state-
ments, flash cards help remind you
 
✓ To take active actions for building your new, more adaptive schemas
 
✓ To look at the difference between what triggers your maladaptive sche-
mas today versus what created them in your childhood
Fill out a schema flash card for all your problematic schemas, and read each 
of them often — especially when your schema triggers hit you. But remember 
to be patient with yourself.

38-year-old restaurant hostess, worked out with her therapist. Use these flash 
card examples to guide you in developing your own.

My problematic schema: Anxious Attachment — 
I worry constantly that anyone important to me 
will leave me.
Feelings: I feel frightened, jealous, and clingy.
Childhood origins: My father left my mother 
when I was 6 years old, and then my mother had 
a never-ending series of boyfriends who would 
try to get close to me, but later they’d leave.
Current triggers: I display this schema when 
anyone backs out of plans with me; when my 
therapist leaves town; and when anyone criti-
cizes me in the smallest way.
My new adaptive schema 
goal: Secure Attachment — I 
want to be comfortable with 
being close to people and not 
feel so desperate.
Steps toward achieving 
the new schema: I will quit 
questioning people’s motives 
when they change plans on 
me; I will work on not being so 
defensive with people — and 
I’ll read Chapter 18 for help on 
how to deal with criticism.
Self-accepting statements: 
I’m only human. I’ve had this 
problem for many years; of 
course, I’ll slip here and there.

My problematic schema: Unpredictable — 
I view myself as a helpless victim, unable to 
influence what happens to me.
Feelings: I feel anxious, weak, and out of 
control.
Childhood origins: My mother and her boy-
friends were completely unpredictable; I 
never knew what would please them.
Current triggers: Heavy traffic scares me; 
paying bills makes me afraid of my future; 
whenever someone asks me to do some-
thing, I feel obligated to do it.
My new adaptive schema goal: 
Predictable — I want to feel more 
in charge of my life and accept 
that I can’t control everything.
Steps toward achieving the new 
schema: I will take a class on per-
sonal finances at the community 
college; I’m going to make myself 
drive in heavy traffic much more 
often so I get used to it.
Self-accepting statements: I want 
to view my mistakes as experi-
ences to learn from.
After you fill out your own schema flash cards, discuss them with your thera-
pist, and then work on moving toward your new, more adaptive schemas. 
But, be ready for a few slips and falls along the way. Read your flash cards 
often.

Chapter 20
Considering Medication for BPD
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the facts about medications
▶ Providing help during the tough times
▶ Reviewing your medication options
▶ Deciding whether to give medication a try
P
sychotropic medications are drugs that change your mood, behavior, or 
perceptions. Over the last several decades, the use of these medica-
tions has skyrocketed. In fact, prescriptions for antidepressants (one type 
of psychotropic medication) are more common than any other category of 
medications.
 
Although most people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) take one or 
more psychotropic medications, surprisingly, very little research supports the 
use of medication for the management of BPD.
This lack of supportive research doesn’t mean that medication can’t be useful 
when you or someone you love is dealing with BPD, but it does make the deci-
sion whether to use medication more complicated. In this chapter, we lay out 
what science has to say about BPD and medications. We describe various 
classes of medication that doctors commonly use to help manage the symp-
toms of BPD and discuss the reasons why someone with BPD may decide to 
use a certain drug. We also survey the common side effects of these drugs. 
Finally, we offer our advice and some thoughts about saying no to medication.
Putting Medications on Trial
A scientific consensus regarding the effectiveness of medications for treat-
ing symptoms of BPD doesn’t exist. At this time, no definitive studies suggest 
that any particular drug will cure or even eliminate symptoms of BPD. In fact, 
the guidelines published in 2009 by the British National Institute for Health 
and Clinical Excellence state that drug treatment should not be used specifi-
cally for BPD and that psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment.

248
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
The problem is that most studies of medications and BPD to date have lacked 
rigor and high standards of scientific excellence. The main concern is the scar-
city of what scientists call randomized clinical trials (RCTs), which are the most 
accepted form of experimentation in the world of science. The problem with 
RCTs is that they’re time consuming and costly to run. In an RCT, the study’s 
administrators randomly assign carefully selected and diagnosed participants 
to a treatment. For example, if a study is looking at how Drug A improves BPD 
symptoms, some participants are assigned to a group that receives Drug A, 
while others are assigned to a group that receives a sugar pill (also known as 
a placebo). A third set of participants may be assigned to a group that doesn’t 
receive any drug for awhile. In the best-designed studies, neither the partici-
pants nor the doctors administering the treatment know which participants 
are getting a real treatment and which are getting a placebo. See the “More 
research on medications for BPD” sidebar for more information.
More research on medications for BPD
The Cochrane Collaboration, a global nonprofit 
organization that searches scientific literature 
and evaluates the quality of research done on 
various disorders, offers easy-to-understand 
reviews of this research for free on the Internet. 
Go to www.cochrane.org/reviews and 
search for whatever disorder you’re interested 
in. The collaboration’s recent report about BPD 
concludes that current scientific evidence 
doesn’t support treating BPD with medications. 
Renowned BPD expert, Joel Paris, MD, agrees. 
In his book, Treatment of Borderline Personality 
Disorder (Guilford Press), Paris argues that 
doctors often give people with BPD too many 
prescriptions. But he concludes that when 
doctors are considering medications for BPD, 
the antidepressants (specifically, the selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs) are a 
possible first choice for treating some of the 
symptoms. He makes this choice because of 
the relative safety of SSRIs and their ability to 
decrease the depression and anxiety that often 
accompany BPD.
The World Federation of Societies of Biological 
Psychiatry, an international group of experts, 
published guidelines for treating BPD in 2007. 
This group also found that research support-
ing the use of specific medications for BPD has 
been sparse, but, like Paris, the group suggests 
that certain medications may be useful for man-
aging some BPD symptoms.
Other problems in the research of medications 
and BPD include vast inconsistencies among 
studies. These inconsistencies make comparing 
and contrasting the studies extremely difficult. 
Studies vary in lengths of treatment, in ways 
of measuring improvement, and in manners of 
recruiting participants. For example, some stud-
ies took place over a five-week period, while 
others occurred over a six-month period. In 
terms of measuring improvement, some studies 
used patient self-report, others used psycho-
logical test scores, and still others used ratings 
given by the physician who gave the medica-
tions. In terms of recruiting methods, some 
studies recruited people through newspaper 
advertisements, while others used people who 
were in therapy. In some studies, not enough 
people participated; in others too many people 
dropped out midstudy. Finally, studies also vary 
in terms of funding: In some cases, the manu-
facturers of the drugs being studied provided 
the funding for the studies, which has led many 
professionals to question the results because of 
the possibility of conflict of interest.

 Chapter 20: Considering Medication for BPD
 
The bottom line is that both doctors and patients should use medication 
for BPD with caution. Although many people do benefit enormously from 
psychotropic medication, having BPD doesn’t necessarily mean taking a trip 
to the pharmacy. Most mental health professionals agree that psychological 
therapy is the best form of treatment for BPD. However, the following sec-
tion takes a look at the reasons why doctors may consider medications in the 
treatment of BPD.
Getting Help from Medications
Experts agree that psychological therapies designed for treating BPD remain 
the most successful approaches to helping people who have this disorder. 
However, at times, adding medication to the mix can make a lot of sense.
 
Sometimes medications can be powerful tools for people with BPD. However, 
most people with BPD who choose to take medications don’t obtain as much 
relief from these medications as they hoped for. Typically, medications for 
BPD provide only limited relief for a limited range of symptoms. For this 
reason, the best form of treatment is one that includes psychotherapy.
Considerations for taking medication
Your doctor may choose to put you on medication because of other disor-
ders or symptoms that are occurring at the same time as your BPD. Thus, if 
one or more of the following situations occur, your care provider may con-
sider medication:
 
✓ You have both BPD and a major depressive disorder. Research has 
found psychotherapy to be an effective treatment for depression. 
However, for some people, medication is an appropriate adjunct to 
psychotherapy. For more information about depression, see our book, 
Depression For Dummies (Wiley).
 
✓ You have severe, debilitating anxiety and/or panic attacks. 
Psychotherapy also helps treat this problem, but some folks find that 
medication helps them make progress in therapy.
 
✓ You have BPD and bipolar disorder. Doctors almost always call 
for medication when a person has bipolar disorder, formerly known 
as manic depressive disorder. For more on this disorder, check out 
Candida Fink and Joe Kraynak’s Bipolar Disorder For Dummies (Wiley).
 
✓ You start to hear voices or see things that aren’t there, or you have 
bizarre, paranoid thoughts. Medications can help treat these symp-
toms; however, they often have significant side effects and should 

250
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
rarely be used for long periods of time for BPD (see the “Surveying the 
Medicine Cabinet” section for more info on medication options). If you 
have BPD (and not schizophrenia), you shouldn’t need to take them for 
a long time because people with BPD rarely experience these symptoms 
for extended periods of time.
 
✓ You are at risk of imminently harming yourself or someone else. If you 
arrive in an emergency room for treatment because of dangerous behav-
ior, the medical staff will probably give you medication to calm you down.
 
✓ Your unique symptoms lead your medical provider to determine that 
a trial of medication would be beneficial. Sometimes experienced 
mental health professionals have reasons to try a certain medication, 
especially when other treatments have failed. However, you should 
never feel pressured to do something against your will. To ensure that 
people with BPD are comfortable with their doctor’s suggested treat-
ment, we encourage them and those who care about them to become 
educated about the pros and cons of medication.
Precautions to consider
Prior to beginning any medication regimen, be sure to have a complete physi-
cal exam. Your doctor may want to run a blood test to look at your thyroid 
function, cholesterol levels, liver condition, and other health risks that can 
influence the medication decision. In some cases, your doctor may recom-
mend an electrocardiogram (EKG), a painless test that checks how fast and 
regular your heart is beating.
Make sure you keep your primary care provider informed about any treat-
ment you’re receiving, including psychotherapy or medication. Before taking 
any medications, be sure that you talk to your doctor about the following:
 
✓ Any physical conditions you have, including the following:
 
• Diabetes
 
• Metabolic syndrome
 
• High blood pressure
 
• Heart disease
 
• Liver disease
 
• Thyroid malfunction
 
• Kidney disease
 
• Chronic pain
 
• Migraine headaches
 
• Allergies

251
 Chapter 20: Considering Medication for BPD
 
• Hormone imbalances
 
• Menopause
 
• Arthritis
 
• Cancer
 
✓ Other medications (either prescribed or over the counter) that you’re 
taking
 
✓ Vitamins, herbs, or dietary supplements you take regularly
 
✓ Heavy caffeine (and/or energy drink) consumption
 
✓ Your drug or alcohol use
 
✓ Tobacco consumption
 
✓ Whether you’re pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding
 
✓ Your family’s mental health history
 
✓ Previous medications you didn’t tolerate well
 
✓ Previous medications you found useful
Surveying the Medicine Cabinet
In this section, we briefly describe the medications that doctors commonly 
prescribe to treat symptoms associated with BPD. At this time, however, the 
evidence that medications directly help people with BPD is limited at best. 
Nevertheless, most people with BPD take some kind of medication. So, know-
ing what options are available is important both for people with BPD and 
those who care about them. Keep in mind that researchers are constantly 
developing new medications and conducting new studies on side effects and 
general benefits. For the latest information about medications and their side 
effects, talk to your doctor first. You can also find information about medica-
tions on the Web at www.webmd.com.
 
People with BPD attempt and commit suicide at an alarmingly high rate. 
Therefore, doctors who treat BPD must always consider the lethality of an 
overdose of any drug they prescribe.
 
In one small study of people with BPD, researchers gave one group of patients 
one gram of omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish oil) and another group placebos 
(sugar pills). After eight weeks, researchers found a reduction of depression 
and aggression symptoms in the group that took omega-3 fatty acids but not in 
the group that took placebos. Omega-3 fatty acids may ultimately prove to be 
an effective and safe option to treat depression and aggression in people with 
BPD, but at this time considerably more research is needed.

252
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Antidepressants
The most commonly prescribed medications for people with BPD are antide-
pressants, which are drugs that increase the availability of certain neurotrans-
mitters (or chemicals that help nerve cells communicate) in the brain. These 
neurotransmitters affect mood, energy, aggressiveness, impulsivity, atten-
tion, motivation, arousal, and appetite.
SSRIs
Doctors frequently prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
for people with BPD. SSRIs boost the availability of serotonin in the brain. 
Although most people with BPD don’t have classic major depression, some 
research does show that SSRIs can help decrease anger and impulsivity. An 
important advantage to consider when using this medication is its low risk of 
overdose. SSRIs may take from one to four or more weeks to take effect.
 
Keep in mind the following concerns when you’re considering SSRIs as a form 
of treatment:
 
✓ Side effects can include weight gain, dizziness, dry mouth, upset stom-
ach, insomnia, apathy, decreased sex drive, headaches, weight loss, 
tremors, sweating, or anxiety. Side effects usually diminish after a month 
and can sometimes be managed with other medical treatments.
 
✓ Don’t stop taking an SSRI abruptly. Discontinuing use too quickly can 
cause headaches, nausea, sweating, problems sleeping, frightening 
dreams, or fever and chills.
 
✓ Studies have linked SSRIs to an increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts 
and attempts in children, adolescents, and young adults. Doctors need 
to monitor moods carefully whenever someone starts a new medication, 
but especially younger people.
 
✓ A life threatening condition, called serotonin syndrome, can occur when 
too much serotonin is in the body. Another kind of antidepressant — 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) — can lead to this condition 
when you take them at the same time as SSRIs (see the next section for 
more info on MAOIs). In addition, some migraine medications, pain relief 
medications, and dietary supplements can increase risk for serotonin 
syndrome.
A wide variety of SSRIs have become available in the last decade or two. 
People often need to try more than one to discover what works best for 
them. Be patient and work with your mental healthcare provider when trying 
SSRIs for the first time. Among the most frequently prescribed SSRIs (with 
their brand names in parentheses) are

253
 Chapter 20: Considering Medication for BPD
 
✓ Citalopram (Celexa): This SSRI seems to have fewer side effects and is 
well tolerated by elderly people.
 
✓ Escitalopram (Lexapro): Prescribed for both anxiety and depression, 
this drug may work faster than its chemical cousin, citalopram.
 
✓ Fluvoxamine (Luvox): Also prescribed for obsessive-compulsive disor-
der (OCD), this drug is more sedating than other SSRIs.
 
✓ Paroxetine (Paxil): This drug is associated with weight gain, sedation, 
and significant withdrawal symptoms.
 
✓ Fluoxetine (Prozac): This drug tends to be more stimulating than other 
SSRIs and can sometimes cause insomnia. It has FDA approval for treat-
ing OCD, depression, anxiety, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
 
✓ Sertraline (Zoloft): This drug appears to be the safest medication for 
people with cardiac problems and doesn’t seem to be either overly stim-
ulating or sedating.
Other antidepressants
Because SSRIs are relatively safe and because some research supports their 
use with BPD, other types of antidepressants are less widely used. However, 
in the quest to find relief, doctors sometimes prescribe antidepressants that 
affect other neurotransmitters or older generations of antidepressants. These 
other types of antidepressants include
 
✓ SNRIs: Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) work 
by increasing levels of the neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepineph-
rine. Venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) are two antide-
pressants in this category.
 
✓ NDRIs: Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) increase 
availability of the neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and dopamine. 
Doctors sometimes use bupropion (Wellbutrin or Zyban), one of the 
drugs in this category, to help people stop smoking or to treat attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).For more on AD/HD, check out 
Jeff Strong and Michael O. Flanagan’s AD/HD For Dummies (Wiley).
 
✓ Tricyclics: Doctors rarely prescribe tricyclics, an older variety of medi-
cations, for people with BPD because an overdose can be fatal. Side 
effects can also be considerably worse than those of other more refined 
medications and include dry mouth, dizziness, drop in blood pressure, 
and blurred vision.
 
✓ MAOIs: The oldest type of antidepressants, MAOIs can have serious and 
dangerous side effects, including dangerous spikes in blood pressure. As 
a result, doctors don’t use them often.

254
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
Neuroleptics
Researchers originally designed neuroleptics, also called antipsychotic drugs, 
to help people with schizophrenia, but doctors now use them for other prob-
lems, including BPD. The following sections describe the two classes of antip-
sychotic drugs, which are typical and atypical.
 
A rare but serious side effect of neuroleptic drugs is known as neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS causes fever, delirium, and muscle rigid-
ity and can cause a coma. NMS can also be life threatening. Scientists once 
thought NMS occurred only in reaction to the older typical antipsychotic 
drugs. However, doctors have reported cases of NMS in people taking the 
newer, atypical antipsychotics. If these symptoms develop in you or someone 
you care about who’s taking antipsychotics, seek immediate medical attention.
Typical antipsychotics
Typical antipsychotics have been around awhile, and doctors often use them 
in emergency rooms to calm people down. These drugs aren’t usually a good 
choice for people with BPD because BPD tends to be a chronic disorder. 
Typical antipsychotics can lead to disturbing side effects with long-term use.
Lessons from cousins
Considerable evidence links lower concen-
trations of the brain chemical communicator 
called serotonin to a variety of mental disorders, 
including depression and anxiety. Research 
also associates problems in serotonin function 
with impulsive aggression. Furthermore, impul-
sive aggression is often a symptom of BPD.
To better understand where impulsive aggres-
sion comes from, researchers have studied 
the connection between genes and early envi-
ronment in rhesus monkeys because human 
beings share over 90 percent of their genetic 
makeup with rhesus monkeys. During their 
research, scientists found that some monkeys 
have a gene that, when activated, appears to 
affect concentrations of serotonin. However, 
when the monkeys with that gene were raised 
by their own mothers, the gene didn’t appear to 
affect serotonin levels at all. By contrast, when 
monkeys with that gene were raised by other 
monkeys (not their own mothers), the gene 
appeared to trigger lower levels of serotonin.
Furthermore, monkeys raised by other monkeys 
(not their own mothers) were more likely to 
become impulsively aggressive than monkeys 
raised by their own mothers. Aggressive mon-
keys fought with others in their troop and acted up 
with their elders. As adolescents, they could’ve 
been expelled from their troops or become 
social outcasts. Apparently, early environmental 
factors interact with genetic factors and lead 
to later behavioral problems in monkeys. This 
scenario sounds a little like what happens with 
people who develop BPD — a less-than-ideal 
childhood environment increases the likelihood 
that a genetic risk will be activated.

255
 Chapter 20: Considering Medication for BPD
Tardive dyskinesia is an especially troubling side effect of typical antipsychot-
ics that involves uncontrolled, repetitive movements. People with this side 
effect may make facial grimaces, smack their lips, or have rapid movements 
of the body, arms, or legs. Frequently, they can’t control their fingers and 
may look like they’re playing an imaginary piano. Unfortunately, treatment 
of this side effect can take considerable time and isn’t always successful. As 
a result, people who already have a severe emotional distress end up with 
a physical condition that’s extremely difficult to tolerate. Another troubling 
side effect that occurs mainly with typical antipsychotic drugs is called akan-
thisia. People who have this side effect describe a desperate state of inner 
restlessness, agitation, and anxiety. Treatment begins with discontinuing the 
use of the atypical antipsychotic medication and trying out other medica-
tions to reduce the symptoms.
Atypical antipsychotics
Researchers developed these newer neuroleptics with the hope of decreas-
ing the risk of side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, but the extent to which 
this goal has been achieved isn’t yet clear. Limited research suggests that 
atypical antipsychotics may have a calming effect and reduce impulsivity. 
Researchers have completed a few positive trials with patients who have 
BPD, but again, research is limited.
The following list provides the generic names followed by the brand names of 
some of the most common atypical antipsychotic drugs. We note in this list 
whether or not these drugs cause weight gain. Before beginning a prescrip-
tion medication that can increase weight, your doctor should screen you for 
hypertension and risks of diabetes. This screening should include looking 
at fasting plasma glucose (blood drawn after a night-long fast), cholesterol 
levels, and blood pressure.
 
✓ Aripiprazole (Abilify): This drug is less sedating and can cause less 
weight gain than some of the others in this group.
 
✓ Clozapine (Clozaril): Side effects can be severe, including sweating, 
increased salivation (drooling), and weight gain. It’s not usually given 
for BPD.
 
✓ Ziprasidone (Geodon): This drug is less sedating and causes less weight 
gain than some other atypical antipsychotics. You should take this drug 
with food.
 
✓ Paliperidone (Invega): Less sedating than other medications, this drug 
isn’t for use with elderly patients.
 
✓ Risperidone (Risperdal): This drug can decrease agitation and behav-
ioral disturbances and often causes weight gain.

256
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
✓ Quetiapine (Seroquel): Linked to sedation and weight gain, this drug 
isn’t recommended for people with cardiac risks.
 
✓ Olanzapine (Zyprexa): This drug can cause weight gain. Smoking ciga-
rettes may decrease its effectiveness. Researchers have studied this 
medication in randomized controlled trials, and it appears to improve 
symptoms in BPD.
 
Doctors use brand name Symbyax, a combined form of fluoxetine, an antide-
pressant, and olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, to treat bipolar disorder.
 
The FDA warns that atypical antipsychotics can lead to hyperglycemia or dia-
betes. Some of these medications appear to be worse than others. In fact, olan-
zapine, one of the drugs studied for treating BPD, leads to significant weight 
gain, which can then lead to diabetes. Furthermore, some reports suggest that 
these medications may increase the risk of sudden heart failure. Therefore, 
you or someone you love shouldn’t take these drugs without considerable 
consideration of both the costs and benefits.
Mood Stabilizers
Mood stabilizers, also known as anticonvulsants or antiseizure medications, are 
drugs that prevent reoccurring seizures in people with epilepsy. In addition 
to preventing seizures, though, they appear to even out moodiness and, as a 
result, are a frequent choice for people with bipolar disorder. A few studies 
suggest that mood stabilizers can decrease impulsive anger in some people 
with BPD. Again, research is limited.
 
However, you can’t ignore the downsides of mood stabilizers when you’re 
considering them for yourself or someone you care about. First, while taking 
these medications, people need to be monitored closely for possible toxicity. 
And second, overdosing on mood stabilizers can be fatal.
Some of the mood stabilizers (with the brand names in parentheses) your 
physician may recommend include
 
✓ Lithium (Lithium): Commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, this drug is 
rarely used to treat BPD. Although Lithium is a naturally occurring salt, 
it can be deadly when levels get too high.
 
✓ Valporic acid or divalproex (Depakote): Less dangerous than lithium in 
terms of toxicity, this drug may help reduce aggression. Weight gain and 
sedation are common side effects.
 
✓ Lamotrigine (Lamictal): This drug may be useful in reducing impulsiv-
ity and anger. One side effect is a rare but possibly fatal skin reaction. It 
also causes less weight gain than other mood stabilizers.

257
 Chapter 20: Considering Medication for BPD
 
✓ Gabapentin (Neurontin): Used for peripheral nerve pain, this drug may 
also reduce anxiety. It doesn’t cause as many side effects as the other 
mood stabilizers.
 
✓ Carbamazepine (Tegretol): Fatal in overdose, this drug is used for treat-
ing resistant bipolar and psychotic disorders. It interferes with birth 
control pills, and people taking it need frequent blood monitoring.
 
✓ Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal): Chemically similar to carbamazepine, this 
drug is safer, but it also interferes with birth control pills.
 
✓ Topiramate (Topamax): Associated with weight loss, this drug can 
cause problems with slowed thinking. Topiramate has shown some 
potential to treat certain problems with addiction and impulsivity, such 
as alcohol addiction and pathological gambling, but, like all the other 
drug treatments, much more research needs to be done.
Making the Medication Decision
The quality of life for people with BPD can be quite poor. As we describe in 
Chapter 3, some people with BPD experience sudden shifts in mood and have 
severe interpersonal problems. Others hurt themselves, and some eventually 
kill themselves. Thus, you can understand why people search for ways to end 
their suffering. If taking one medication cured BPD, everyone involved would 
be delighted, no doubt. Unfortunately, researchers haven’t yet found a drug 
that can take away all the pain.
Therefore, you need to keep your expectations for medications realistic. If 
your treatment includes taking medication, stay in close contact with your 
physician or psychiatrist so that he can monitor the effects of the drug as 
well as the effects on your mood and your general health. When you take 
medications, we advise you to do the following:
 
✓ Be patient. Some medications take a number of weeks to become fully 
effective.
 
✓ Be informed. Know what side effects to expect and discuss the benefits 
and risks with your physician thoroughly.
 
✓ Take your medication as prescribed. Don’t discontinue medications 
suddenly without consulting your doctor because serious problems can 
result. Never take more than the prescribed amount.
 
✓ Don’t drink alcohol or take illegal drugs while taking medications for BPD.
 
✓ If you experience serious side effects, consult with your doctor about 
possibly decreasing or eliminating some of your medication.

258
Part IV: Treatments for BPD 
 
✓ Tell your doctor about any and all side effects you experience with a 
medication, including sexual side effects, even though you may feel 
embarrassed doing so. Sometimes side effects reduce with time; other 
times your doctor may prescribe a different medication to deal with side 
effects or add another medication to lessen the first drug’s side effects.
 
✓ Realize that if you think a certain drug may be helpful to you, but your 
physician disagrees, he probably has a good reason. Many people with 
BPD seek medications that have addictive potential. In the end, these 
medications are likely to cause more harm than good.
 
✓ Be aware that adding additional medications won’t likely result in a fully 
satisfactory outcome. The more medications you take, the more side 
effects you can expect.
 
✓ If you disagree with your physician, you can seek a second opinion. 
However, try to avoid the temptation of endless doctor shopping, 
because you’re likely looking for a perfect doctor and that doctor 
doesn’t exist.
 
Studies show that psychotherapy tends to work better than medication for 
BPD. Remember that psychotherapy does take awhile. Try not to expect medi-
cation miracles because you will most likely be disappointed. Hopefully, some-
time in the future, researchers will find a more effective medication option for 
treating BPD.

Advice for People 
Who Care

In this part . . .
A
t one time or another, most people have known, 
cared about, or loved one or more people who suf-
fer from borderline personality disorder (BPD). If one of 
your friends, colleagues, or loved ones has BPD, you know 
the challenges that BPD causes. Well, this part is for all of 
you. Here we lay out strategies for handling difficult times 
when you’re interacting with people who have BPD.

Has BPD
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding BPD behaviors and their effects
▶ Keeping everyone safe when BPD is part of a relationship
▶ Knowing when to leave a relationship with someone who has BPD
▶ Walking away if you decide to do so
“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be 
used against you.” Sound familiar? Well, you’re not under arrest — 
you’re involved with someone who has borderline personality disorder (BPD). 
You may even feel like you’re alone in a relationship that defies logic and 
reason.
Living with BPD, whether you or someone you love has the disorder, feels 
like walking across an old board that stretches over a creek. Some steps land 
solid and secure, while others sway and threaten to toss you into the creek 
far below. You never know what the next step will feel like — a situation that 
leaves you confused and unbalanced. Furthermore, partners of people with 
BPD often feel manipulated, criticized, misunderstood, and even afraid.
This chapter is for the husband, wife, partner, or lover of someone with 
BPD. If you’re someone who actually has BPD, you may want to read this 
chapter to better understand the mixed feelings your partner may be having. 
Therapists who work with family members of people with BPD can also ben-
efit from reviewing this chapter’s unique perspective.
To begin this chapter, we discuss common borderline behaviors. To those 
of you who live with and love people with BPD, we explain how to maintain 
emotional and physical safety in your relationship. We give you strategies for 
dealing with difficult communications. We also provide some hints on how 
to evaluate whether or not you should remain in the relationship. Finally, we 
tell you how to safely end a relationship with someone who has BPD if you 
decide to do so.

Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Understanding Borderline Behaviors 
within Relationships
If your partner has BPD, you really need to understand the nature of the dis-
order before you can try to improve your relationship, get professional help 
for understanding your own feelings, or even choose to end the relationship. 
We strongly recommend that you read Chapters 3 through 10 to fully appreci-
ate what you’re dealing with. Most nonprofessionals don’t know a great deal 
about BPD. Therefore, many partners can easily begin to question their own 
sanities when they end up in relationships with people who have BPD.
This section discusses some of the most problematic BPD behaviors that 
make staying in a relationship with someone with the disorder challenging. 
We discuss what these behaviors feel like, and, in subsequent sections, we 
give you ideas for dealing with them. We hope this information helps you 
anchor yourself in reality again.
 
People with BPD don’t consciously and intentionally act the way they do. 
Their problems have a long history and are rooted in both biology and early 
childhood. We present the following information to help you better under-
stand people with BPD and deal with the challenges of their behavior more 
effectively.
Going to extremes
Most people, whether they have BPD or not, have a lot of good qualities 
mixed in with some not-so-great ones. But people with BPD can’t easily see 
people as a mix of both good and bad. Instead, their minds focus on one 
or the other at any given time. Therefore, they see their partners as either 
angels or devils — and not much in between. One day your partner may see 
you as the most wonderful person who ever lived, and the next day (some-
times the next hour), your partner may view you with complete contempt.
The following story about Anthony’s relationship with Beth, who has BPD, 
illustrates how someone with BPD can flip from adoring, seductive behavior 
to demonizing, hateful behavior at the drop of a hat.
Since his divorce two years ago, Anthony hasn’t gotten serious 
with anyone — that is, until now. He met Beth a couple of weeks 
ago, but he’s already head-over-heels in love. She’s cute, smart, and 
charming. She absolutely adores him. They become intimate quickly 
to Anthony’s delight. And since their second date, they’ve pretty much 
been inseparable.

263
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
Beth calls or texts him throughout the day, and they get together every 
night that Anthony doesn’t have his two young children at home. As soon 
as he got joint custody, he set a rule that no female would spend the 
night when his kids were with him. Beth doesn’t like that rule, but he fig-
ures she’ll just have to understand.
One Wednesday Anthony waits with the other parents in front of the 
elementary school. His cell buzzes — Beth texts him, “Where R U?” He 
enters, “P U kids.” She texts, “C U L8TR.” Anthony assumes that she 
means Thursday after work. Later that evening at home, his kids finish 
their homework while Anthony cleans the kitchen. Beth uses her key and 
walks into the house. “Daddy, who’s that?” Anthony’s kids say in unison.
“Uh, hi Beth, I didn’t expect you,” Anthony says as he reaches out a 
hand in front of him to keep her from giving him her regular passionate 
greeting.
Beth reaches into a grocery bag and pulls out an ice cream cake. “I 
thought the kids might enjoy a snack while we talk upstairs in your 
room,” she suggests.
“Umm, Beth, that really isn’t such a good idea. I’d love to, but I think it’s 
too soon for my kids to deal with something like this right now,” Anthony 
says in a soft voice.
“Oh, I get it. I’m not important to you. You really are a jerk. Why don’t 
you just go marry your ex-wife!” Beth screams as she stomps off.
The next day Beth sends Anthony flowers at work. Anthony feels very 
pleased but confused at the same time.
If Anthony decides to remain in his relationship with Beth, he can expect 
many more seismic shifts in Beth’s emotions and behaviors. Like other 
people with BPD, Beth flips from one extreme to the other in seconds. 
Often, people with BPD seem to have no memory of the previous day’s 
hateful outbursts.
Giving you the silent treatment
Some people with BPD deal with their anger by refusing to communicate. For 
their partners, this silence can feel extremely abusive. The cold stares and 
refusals to speak frequently stand in stark contrast to the friendly façades 
they present to others. People with BPD may cheerfully play with children or 
flirt with waiters even though they make no eye contact with their partners. 
Partners often remain in the dark about what they did to deserve the silent 
treatment — perhaps they failed to fold a pair of pants correctly, put too 
much salad dressing on a salad, or had a bad hair day. No matter how trivial 
their misbehaviors are, they never know how to fix them because their part-
ners with BPD refuse to tell them what’s bothering them.

264
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
People with BPD often employ this silent strategy when their partners really 
want to communicate with them. Silence gives people with BPD an illusion of 
power, which they can use to hide the vulnerability they feel inside. Silence 
lets them control the amount of distance versus closeness they have in their 
relationships.
Bradford, recently diagnosed with BPD, has been married to Selma for about 
12 years. Their story illustrates the subtle cruelty of the silent treatment.
“How did your meeting go with your boss?” Selma asks her husband, 
Bradford, as he walks through the door. “Did he apologize for being so 
unfair to you?”
Bradford slams the door and throws his briefcase across the floor, scat-
tering papers. Their dog cowers and Selma says, “I guess it didn’t go so 
great. Are you okay?”
Instead of answering, Bradford goes to the refrigerator and pulls out a 
container of leftover spaghetti. He begins to shovel the cold spaghetti 
into his mouth, dripping sauce on his chin. Selma makes another attempt 
to communicate, “Hey, honey, is there anything I can do? Can I get you 
something to drink?”
Bradford turns his back to her and finishes the leftovers. Then he gets a 
carton of ice cream from the freezer and finishes what’s left in four huge 
spoonfuls. Selma, knowing what’s next, sighs and says, “Okay, Bradford, 
I’m going to go grocery shopping. Is there anything you need?”
He doesn’t reply and goes into their bathroom. She hears the shower turn 
on. Most likely, when she returns, he’ll be asleep.
When under stress, Bradford, like many people with BPD, finds talking openly 
about his feelings difficult. Instead, he clams up and shows his distress to his 
partner. After 12 years of marriage and lots of therapy, Selma is able to take 
herself out of the situation by leaving the house.
Before moving on, we want to be clear about one thing: The silent treatment 
is abusive. It’s one of the cruelest actions people with BPD can dish out to 
the people who love them most. Recipients — usually their partners — feel 
diminished, powerless, helpless, confused, and torn apart (see the “Feeling 
rejected and abandoned” section for more info on these feelings). Silence vio-
lates the essence of intimacy and trust.
 
If your partner abuses you with silence or anything else, seeking therapy can

 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
Gaslighting
Gaslighting is a term that comes from the 1940 film Gaslight. In the film, the 
main character, Gregory, manipulates a woman’s home gas lights so that they 
dim at times that she thinks she’s alone. His manipulation makes her believe 
that she’s imagining the dimming, which leads her to question her own sanity.
Today gaslighting means providing false or distorted information with the 
intent of disrupting someone’s ability to trust her own senses, reasoning abil-
ity, and memory of events. People with BPD may not be consciously aware of 
their gaslighting behaviors, but they do often distort facts, withhold informa-
tion, or rewrite history so that their partners no longer trust their own reac-
tions and memories. By making their partners feel more anxious and insecure, 
people with BPD often feel more confident that their partners won’t leave 
them — this feeling becomes the motivation for their gaslighting behaviors.
John, who has BPD, uses gaslighting to confuse and unsettle his wife, Zoe. 
John starts by deliberately moving some garbage cans that Zoe has put out 
for their party. This sets the stage for his next stunt, inviting a former girl-
friend to the party.
“The food looks wonderful; the caterer did a great job,” Zoe comments to 
her husband John. “People will be arriving soon.”
John nods, “Where are the garbage cans for people to toss plates and 
cups?”
“I put one in the pantry, and the other one is outside on the patio,” Zoe 
hears the first car drive up and peeks into the pantry, finding no garbage 
can. She also checks the patio and fails to see the other garbage can. “Did 
you move the garbage cans?” she asks John.
“No, you probably forgot to put them out. Just go greet our guests. And 
try to be nice, and don’t embarrass me if you can,” John snaps.
At the door, Zoe sees Ellen, John’s former girlfriend. “Ellen,” she says 
as she holds out her hand in greeting, “I’m glad to see you.” Zoe doesn’t 
recall John telling her that he invited Ellen, but Zoe knows not to ask.
John comes out of the garage with the two garbage cans. He puts one in 
the pantry and one on the patio. Zoe starts to wonder if she really put 
them out. Zoe feels shaken by the garbage cans and the ex-girlfriend. She 
knows it’s going to be a difficult night.
As you can see from John and Zoe’s story, when people with BPD question 
their partners’ perceptions and memories, their partners begin to question 
them, too. But because people with BPD only show their friends and family 
their good sides (while simultaneously bombarding their partners with their 
sinister sides), people with BPD often elicit complete support from those 
friends and family. As a result, their partners don’t have anyone to turn to as 
they continue to doubt their own perceptions and memories.

Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Initiating isolation
Social support and connections make people feel more confident and secure. 
Confident, secure people trust their own judgments and know the difference 
between acceptable and outrageous behavior. People with BPD often attempt to 
isolate their partners from friends, relatives, and other sources of support — as 
a result, their partners feel less secure and less confident, which, in turn, means 
they’re less likely to leave their partners with BPD. People with BPD probably 
aren’t consciously aware of their attempts to isolate their partners, but the 
result is the same.
Isolation often occurs slowly and insidiously over time. It can overtake you 
before you even know what hit you. If you’re not sure whether or not you’ve 
become isolated, consider the following questions:
 
✓ Do you find your partner’s behavior so embarrassing that you avoid 
going out with people?
 
✓ Do you fear telling your friends and close relatives the truth about the 
nature of your relationship?
 
✓ Does your partner question you about where you’re going, how long 
you’ll be gone, and who you’re seeing whenever you leave the house for 
a few hours?
 
✓ Do you feel suffocated by your partner?
 
✓ Does your partner put down your friends and family?
 
✓ Does your partner find ways to interfere with your plans to see other 
people socially?
 
If, after reviewing these questions, you’re still not sure whether or not you’ve 
become too isolated, consider seeking counseling for yourself so that you can 
talk through your situation. Having a confidential source to help you sort out 
reality versus the effects of BPD can help you become more able to rationally 
deal with what’s happening.
Shaking up the present
If your partner has BPD, you probably notice that the atmosphere surround-
ing your relationship is charged with electricity. Your partner flies into rages, 
sometimes for no obvious reason. Your partner may also respond to events 
with a flair for drama.
People with BPD have great difficulty regulating their emotions (see Chapter 
6 for more information about explosive emotions). Some people describe 
people with BPD as being addicted to drama and danger. Your partner’s ride 

267
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
on this emotional rollercoaster can send your stomach into spasms and leave 
you feeling frightened and helpless.
David’s story depicts how some people with BPD crave excitement even 
though their risky behaviors may frighten the people they care about.
The rain and wind are so fierce that cars and trucks pull off to the side 
of the road, waiting for the weather to let up a bit. David’s windshield 
wipers are on high, but visibility is close to zero. “David, can’t you pull 
over?” asks Ben, “I’m getting scared.”
“Don’t interrupt me, Ben. I need to concentrate on my driving,” David 
curtly responds.
The wind picks up, and the car momentarily slides into the other lane. 
Ben sinks down into his seat, terrified but quiet. David increases his 
speed — angry at the weather but also exhilarated by the dangerous 
conditions. Ben feels helpless; this isn’t the first time his partner has pur-
posefully done something to frighten him.
Ben, David’s partner, has learned over time that when he complains about 
David’s risky behaviors, David explodes. Ben feels helpless to alter his part-
ner’s behavior. He also feels embarrassed to tell anyone about his concerns.
Expressing entitlement
People whose partners have BPD often feel pressured to meet unyielding, 
unrelenting demands. They feel they must dance to their partners’ melodies 
because they’re the only audible songs in the relationship. People with BPD 
typically feel entitled to have their needs met, no matter how trivial or impor-
tant they are. Yet, they don’t understand how their demands affect their 
partners.
If you do try to resist your partner’s demands, your partner probably ups the 
ante and becomes even more demanding. Eventually, you find yourself giving 
in. Unfortunately, when you do give in, you reinforce the pattern of behavior, 
making it more likely to occur again.
The following story about Heather illustrates how someone with BPD can 
seem selfish because she’s unable to see that she makes excessive demands 
of her partner.
Heather is a medical technician in a busy office. She comes home tired.
“Sam, what did you make for dinner? I’m beat,” she asks her husband. 
Without waiting for an answer, she complains, “You wouldn’t believe the 
day I had. Patients had to wait an hour for lab work, and my boss was 
crabby all day. Bring me a beer.”

268
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Heather lies back on the couch taking off her shoes. “Sam, did you hear 
me? Where is the remote? Did I tell you I hate my job? I don’t know why 
you’re not more supportive. Sam, what the hell are you doing?”
Sam mutters under his breath, “I had a bad day, too.”
“What did you say? Sam, I really need a bath — can you turn on the water 
for me? I’ll eat dinner later. Hey, where’s my beer? Sam? Sam, why the 
attitude?
“I’ll be right there, Heather, let me open you a beer and get your bath 
ready.”
Sam feels beat up and neglected. If you asked Heather how Sam feels, she 
would be oblivious to his feelings. People with BPD have trouble putting 
themselves in other people’s shoes (check out Chapter 8 for more about this 
particular symptom of BPD). Instead, they focus entirely on their own wants 
and needs.
Acting impulsively
If your partner has BPD, you probably notice that she acts without thinking. 
She’s likely to cut herself, drink to a drunken stupor, consume risky drugs, 
threaten or attempt suicide, gamble, shoplift, or go on reckless shopping 
binges (see Chapter 5 for more information about the nature of impulsivity 
and BPD). After a while, you may even find that you’re becoming numb to 
some of these outrageous episodes. On the other hand, you may never get 
used to these behaviors, and your heart may flip-flop repeatedly. Nothing you 
do seems to help slow down or stop the impulsivity cycle.
The following story about Sandra, a young woman with BPD, and her boy-
friend, Aaron, shows you how a pattern of anger, drinking, and then self-muti-
lation can destroy a relationship.
Sandra flies into a jealous rage when she catches her boyfriend spending 
time on MySpace. “How dare you!” she yells. “You’re disgusting.”
“What are you talking about Sandra? I was just looking,” Aaron replies. 
“What’s the big deal? I wasn’t doing anything.”
“I’m sick of your perversions; I can’t stand it around here. I’m going out 
so I can calm down,” Sandra grabs her purse and keys.
“Please, Sandra, don’t do anything stupid. You know the last time you 
went out you got plastered and ended up feeling pretty bad the next day,” 
Aaron stands up and starts to go to Sandra.

269
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
“Don’t even get near me,” Sandra says as she throws a book aimed at 
Aaron’s head. “I’ll do what I want. You don’t own me.” Sandra storms out 
of the house and slams the front door on her way.
Aaron goes back to MySpace and imagines the day when he can finally 
get up the courage to leave Sandra. It won’t be long.
Sandra goes to the neighborhood bar and starts drinking. After her fourth 
drink, the bartender, who knows her well, calls Aaron to come and get 
her. Aaron arrives to find Sandra leaning on an obviously uncomfortable 
young man at the bar. Aaron hopes to be able to lead Sandra home with-
out another scene.
Like Aaron, partners of people with BPD sometimes rescue their loved ones 
from risky situations. Impulsive, risky behavior can also include sexual esca-
pades that do little to fill the emptiness in the person with BPD but that do 
great harm to the relationship.
Feeling rejected and abandoned
Being romantically involved with someone who has BPD can be challenging, 
to say the least. People with BPD fear abandonment, but they also fear engulf-
ment. So, at one moment, they cling to a relationship, and, at the next, they 
run or push angrily away.
The following story about Andrew and Anita illustrates the see-saw behaviors 
of a man with BPD and their effects on his new wife.
“You look beautiful tonight, Anita,” Andrew says as he hugs his wife and 
plants a kiss on her lips. “I like the way you did your hair, and the dress is 
stunning. It’s great to have a lovely young wife to show off.”
“Thank you, Andrew, I know this party with your co-workers is important, 
and I wanted you to feel proud of me,” Anita says as she pats down her 
hair and gathers her purse.
Andrew doesn’t answer at first. He begins to wonder why Anita had to 
ruin a good compliment. His good mood turns sour. He turns away from 
her as he speaks. “Do you think I need a wife to make me look good in 
front of my colleagues?”
“No, Andrew, of course not. I was hoping to please you,” she answers, 
puzzled by the tone of his question. “We don’t go to many parties where 
we have to dress up and, um, I don’t know. I’m sorry if I said something 
wrong.”

270
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
“So, now you’re telling me that I don’t take you out enough. I try to please 
you but you’re so shallow and spoiled that nothing I do is good enough,” 
Andrew yells as he stomps down the stairs into the kitchen.
Anita follows and says, “Andrew, what are you talking about? I only want 
to be close to you. I want us to be able to talk and be happy.”
Andrew fills the silent room with his fury. Anita shakes her head. “Am I 
crazy?” she thinks to herself.
Anita doesn’t understand what happened. Andrew started out feeling warm 
and close to Anita, but then he got scared. What scared him? Maybe the idea 
that if he loves her too much she may leave him. Or perhaps a picture of her 
flirting at the party. Or the fear that she will reject him for someone better. 
Andrew’s great fear of abandonment is based on a deep feeling of inferiority. 
That fear leads him to push Anita away.
Misinterpreting threats to self-esteem
People with BPD have fragile senses of who they are and what they’re worth. 
Their delicate self-esteems shatter easily. Partners of people with BPD some-
times bruise their loved ones’ senses of self, often without even knowing 
they’re doing so. People with BPD can construe comments made with benign 
intent as harmful. The mind of someone with BPD spins a complex web ready 
to catch any fleeting remarks that it can distort.
The following story about Alyssa, a woman with BPD, and Mark, her date, is 
one example of how an innocent question can quickly morph into a threat to 
the self-esteem of someone with BPD.
“Wow, this steak is juicy and tender. Perfect. How’s your pasta, Alyssa?” 
Mark asks.
“Fantastic,” she replies. “Thanks for bringing me to this restaurant. I 
really like trying new places,” Alyssa says as she smiles.
“I’m happy that we’re finally going out on a date. I’ve noticed you at work 
for a long time. I thought you’d never want to go out with me. I’m glad 
I asked, and I’m even more glad that you accepted,” Mark says as he 
smiles, too.
“You know, I was married until last year. I stayed away from men for 
awhile. My breakup was tough and I needed to work on getting myself to 
a better place,” Alyssa confides. “But I’m ready now to get back into the 
dating scene, and going out with you seems to be a perfect start. Tell me 
about yourself, Mark.”

271
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
“Well, I’ve worked at this company since I finished my MBA a few years 
back. I’m hoping to stay here for another couple of years. The company 
has been good to me. You know, I was made district manager last year,” 
Mark says. “How about you, what are your hopes and dreams?”
Alyssa’s face becomes serious; she’s flooded by sadness. “Hopes and 
dreams. Those went out the window when my marriage broke up. I 
wanted a family. Now I have nothing.”
“Oh, Alyssa, I’m sorry I brought that up. I guess I was stupid. I was talking 
about the future, not the past. I hope I didn’t upset you,” Mark says as he 
reaches for her hand across the table.
She pulls her hand away and says, “Don’t be condescending with me, 
Mark. Just because you’re damn perfect doesn’t mean you have the right 
to shove it in my face.”
“Alyssa, gosh, I didn’t mean . . . I don’t know what to say, I’m a bit con-
fused, really. Can we start over?” Mark asks sincerely.
“No, Mark. I don’t think so. As a matter of fact, I’m ready to go now. 
Thanks for dinner.”
Mark leaves cash on the table and drives Alyssa home. He’s shocked 
when she invites him in for a drink. He wisely declines.
Alyssa started the evening in a decent mood, and Mark’s interest flattered 
her. Just by asking about her hopes and dreams, Mark set off a cascade 
of self-loathing reactions on Alyssa’s part. She spiraled into an abyss and 
angrily shot back, “Don’t be condescending with me, Mark.” By the time she 
gets home, though, she’s over her outburst and ready for a sexual encounter. 
This story illustrates how easily — and unknowingly — you can puncture the 
self-esteem of a person with BPD.
Staying Safe: Emotionally 
and Physically
Having a relationship with someone who has BPD becomes maximally 
challenging when you throw together emotional and physical safety. You 
probably worry about your partner’s safety if she takes part in impulsive, 
self-destructive behaviors, such as cutting and burning or even suicidal 
actions (see Chapter 5 for more information about the types of self-harming 
acts people with BPD engage in). You may also have legitimate concerns 
about being abused yourself, whether that abuse is emotional or physical. 
The sections that follow give you some ideas for how to deal with these 
harmful behaviors (many of which we describe in previous sections).

272
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
 
We strongly recommend that you seek therapy for yourself if you’re in a close 
relationship with someone who has BPD. This advice holds particularly true if 
your partner engages in either self-abuse or abuse of you or others in your 
family. These issues pose complex and challenging threats that can tax the 
coping ability of anyone.
Dealing with your partner’s self-abuse
Nothing is more painful than watching your partner engage in acts of self-
destruction. You probably feel guilty, responsible, frustrated, or even angry 
when you see these behaviors in someone you love. But realizing your own 
limits is important. You aren’t the cause of these actions, and you certainly 
can’t serve as your partner’s therapist. Don’t argue, reason, or discuss these 
volatile issues. Your partner will not be receptive to logic and reasoning 
during an outburst.
Now that we’ve told you what not to do, here are a few ideas about what you 
can do:
 
✓ Remind your partner about any alternative strategies for coping that 
she may have written down ( see Chapters 15 and 16 for examples of 
emergency preparedness plans and flash cards). However, don’t suggest 
alternative strategies for the first time during an outburst.
 
✓ Remember that your partner’s actions aren’t about you. In other words, 
don’t take them personally.
 
✓ Remain calm.
 
✓ Call your partner’s therapist if she has one.
 
✓ Calmly tell your partner that you’re going to leave for awhile — if the 
behaviors don’t appear to be life threatening. This action works best 
when you’ve already told your partner that you plan to leave for awhile 
the next time she engages in serious self-abuse.
 
✓ Call an ambulance or the police if the behavior looks like it may escalate 
to violence.
 
✓ Remind your partner of previous coping strategies that seemed to work.
 
✓ Call your own therapist and make an appointment to discuss your 
options for the future.
What you can’t do is assume responsibility for your partner’s actions. 
Obviously, you want to avoid keeping guns hanging around the house, but 
you can’t get rid of every sharp object or potential weapon.

273
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
Knowing what to do when you’re 
the recipient of abuse
Only rarely do people with BPD consciously and intentionally set out to 
cause harm to their partners. Rather, they respond to fears with amazing 
emotional intensity and strike out as a form of self-defense. But, at some 
level, what their intentions are doesn’t matter because the results are the 
same for their partners whether or not they intended to hurt them in the first 
place.
 
If you’re in real fear for your physical safety, the only good plan is to pick up 
any kids who are involved, take a few crucial documents (if you have them), 
and get out of the household. Don’t threaten that you’ll leave; just do so and 
call the police — preferably after you’re out of the house.
Whether your partner intends to be malicious or not, being abused is never 
okay. If you aren’t sure whether your partner’s behavior is over the line, seek 
therapy to help you figure out the situation. Abuse comes in a wide variety of 
forms, including inducing guilt, gaslighting, isolating, being overly demand-
ing, and giving the silent treatment (see the “Understanding Borderline 
Behaviors within Relationships” section for more examples). To make situa-
tions more difficult, abuse isn’t always easy to recognize. Furthermore, abuse 
has a nasty habit of escalating slowly over time.
 
Whether you’ve sought therapy for yourself or not, you can get a better 
handle on what’s going on by keeping a secret log of the interactions between 
you and your partner. People with BPD can make you feel crazy and an objec-
tive account of your interactions can help you find clarity. The key is to write 
out exactly what each of you said and what happened, almost like you’re writ-
ing a police report. Over time when you review your compilations, you may be 
able to more fully appreciate how much abuse you’ve been allowing yourself 
to receive.
If you do have a therapist and the two of you conclude that remaining in your 
relationship seems like the best course for now, here are a few strategies for 
minimizing the number of verbally abusive assaults:
 
✓ Inhibit your own anger; expressing it will simply escalate the conflict.
 
✓ Don’t argue or try to reason.
 
✓ Don’t fight back, but don’t agree that you warrant the abuse.
 
✓ If you do talk, keep the conversation simple. Stay focused on the 
present.

274
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
 
✓ Try to express empathy for the likely underlying emotion, which is prob-
ably fear, anxiety, or vulnerability. For example, you can say, “I know 
you’re probably feeling very frightened. I’m open to talking about your 
fear.”
 
✓ Tell your partner, “I can’t really deal with this issue right now. I need to 
take a walk for awhile.”
 
✓ Don’t accept the blame for the outburst. Abusive behavior isn’t accept-
able even when something you said triggered it.
 
✓ Don’t threaten to leave permanently. You can always decide to do so 
later.
 
✓ Agree to talk later when everyone feels calmer.
 
✓ Agree to disagree.
 
✓ Don’t reinforce the attack by capitulating or begging.
In addition, after the verbal abuse abates, don’t accept apologies. Rather, 
point out to your partner that the episode hurt you and that you want her to 
work hard to minimize such incidents.
Walking Away from BPD
Partners of people with BPD think about ending their relationships over and 
over and over again. Most partners admit to vacillating between love and 
hate in parallel with the vacillating feelings of their borderline partners. At 
times, many partners wish the whole problem would just disappear, and 
some even fantasize that their BPD partners simply die. As the song goes, 
“breaking up is hard to do,” but breaking ties with someone with BPD is not 
only hard, but frightening and painful, as well.
Debating the decision
Deciding whether to remain in a relationship with a partner who has BPD is 
often surprisingly difficult. Even though you may have suffered abuse and 
unimaginable conflicts, your partner may have been charming, intelligent, 
loving, caring, and generous at many other times. Many people with BPD can 
sense when you’re contemplating a split, and, in response, they often turn up 
the affection at that point. Furthermore, you may feel horrendous guilt and/
or worry for your kids, for your partner, or for yourself. So, how do you dig 
yourself out of this dilemma?

275
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
An excellent way to find clarity on difficult decisions like this one is known 
as the split chair technique. You can use this technique to help you figure out 
what to do when you just can’t seem to sort things out in your head. The pro-
cedure is fairly simple and goes as follows:
 
1. Place two similarly styled chairs facing each other.
 
2. Call one of the chairs your stay in the relationship chair.
 
3. Call the other chair your get out of the relationship chair.
 
4. Sit in the stay chair first.
 
 Talk out loud to the imagined other side of you sitting in the other chair. 
Explain to that part of you why remaining in the relationship is the best 
course right now. Point out every argument you’ve ever used, and notice 
how you feel during this segment.
 
5. Now switch and sit in the get out chair.
 
 Argue against what you just said, and toss in any additional reasons you 
can think of for why you need to get out of the relationship. Notice how 
you feel during this part.
 
6. Rinse and repeat. In other words, keep switching chairs until you feel 
you’ve drained the argument dry.
 
7. Consider redoing this exercise a number of times until you feel ready 
to stick with your decision, no matter what it is.
Mental health professionals have used this technique to help people get out 
of their most difficult predicaments for many decades. You can use it for a 
variety of life’s dilemmas. The following story about Julia clarifies how this 
strategy works in practice.
Julia has been married to Thomas, who has BPD, for the past seven 
years. Thomas has verbally abused Julia more times than she can count. 
He’s never actually hit her, but she’s been terribly frightened by the 
intensity of his anger. He’s been violent with their dog and has put his 
hand through walls. Thomas can exude sweetness, charm, and affection, 
but his emotional abuse has drained Julia of self-esteem, energy, and hap-
piness. Thomas and Julia have seen four therapists for couple’s counsel-
ing; things get better for a few months and then deteriorate again. The 
last therapist diagnoses Thomas with BPD and predicts that if Thomas 
doesn’t get help for himself, the marriage won’t last.
So Julia sees a therapist herself to help her sort out what to do. Her ther-
apist suggests the split chair technique. Here’s what Julia comes up with 
the first time she tries the technique:
Stay chair: Thomas can be very loving. He gives me whatever I want and 
is generous with money. He can be kind to others — especially strangers.

276
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
He can talk to anyone when he feels like it. He seems to stay friendly with 
many of his previous girlfriends. We travel all the time and get to see 
many exotic parts of the world. I also care about him. He needs me.
Get out chair: You never know when Thomas will lose his temper. 
Sometimes it’s over trivial things. I’ve hosted parties or gatherings when 
he’s so mad that he leaves. He doesn’t treat my friends or family with 
respect (he puts on a show only when he feels like he needs to — like 
when we’re in public). He has no friends of his own — only people he’s 
known in the past. I think he still sees some of his girlfriends for support, 
but he’ll never admit it. He flirts with strangers in front of me and denies 
what he’s doing. On some of our trips, he becomes angry and withdrawn. 
Yes, I care about him, but, at some level, I don’t trust him or know him. I 
believe he’s wounded, but I can’t reach him. Yes, he needs me, but he’s 
afraid to get close — it’s like we’re in two separate worlds.
Stay chair: When I look back at what I said, it sounds so superficial. Like 
I’m staying with him because he can sometimes be nice. But, the truth is, 
I don’t trust him. I never know when I might displease him. Okay. This is 
supposed to be the chair that I keep focused on staying, but I’m drifting. 
What does that mean?
Get out chair: It means that I’m struggling to hold onto the idea of 
staying — that staying is feeling less and less like what I want to do. Do I 
really think his generosity with money is that important? Why am I still 
waiting?
Stay chair: I stay because I’m scared.
Get out chair: At least I’m on the right issue. So, what am I so scared 
about? Don’t I have friends? I have a good job, too. And I know my family 
will help.
Stay chair: I’ve seen how he treats his former wife; I don’t want to be 
treated that way.
Get out chair: Yes, that won’t be fun. But what about that can’t I deal 
with?
Stay chair: I’m running out of things to say.
Julia repeats this exercise five more times in the next two weeks. Each 
time, her stay chair arguments grow weaker. She consults an attorney, 
who advises her on ways to leave the relationship safely.
Like Julia, many people stay in relationships because their partners with BPD 
can be passionate, exciting, affectionate, and generous. But, when the tide 
turns, they struggle to reconcile the contrast. Friends and family sometimes 
only receive access to the outward, good side of the person who has BPD. 
The fact that friends and family think the partner with BPD is wonderful 
leaves the partner who doesn’t have BPD feeling more than a little crazy as 
she hears people who matter to her heap praise on the partner, whom she 
thinks may be abusing her, either verbally, emotionally, or physically.

277
 Chapter 21: What to Do When Your Partner Has BPD
Leaving abusive relationships 
if you decide to do so
We’re not trying to tell you to leave your partner who has BPD. Sometimes 
staying in the relationship makes sense; especially when kids are involved, 
when no serious abuse is happening to anyone in the family, when the person 
with BPD is seeking therapy, and when at least a few signs of improvement 
show up over time. However, if your rendition of the split chair technique 
that we discuss in the preceding section tells you that you need to leave, you 
need to consider one more issue — your personal safety. We recommend 
that you follow the following guidelines if significant abuse has been a part of 
your relationship:
 
✓ Don’t tell your partner that you plan to leave.
 
✓ Talk to your therapist or your attorney about local resources (including 
domestic violence shelters).
 
✓ Put together a bag with copies of important papers, such as account 
numbers, birth certificates, health records, school records, insurance 
policies, and your marriage license, as well as a set of car and house 
keys.
 
✓ Pack a suitcase with a couple sets of clothes for you and your children.
 
✓ Store these bags somewhere that your partner can’t find them or at a 
friend or neighbor’s house.
 
✓ Withdraw some cash and keep it somewhere safe.
 
✓ If your abusive partner finds out that you’re planning a getaway, you’re 
at higher risk of abuse, so be careful.
 
✓ If you’re using the Internet to plan your escape, be sure to exit the 
browser completely, delete your browser history, and turn off the com-
puter when you’re done.
 
✓ Even better; use the computer at a public library.
 
✓ Consider using a code word with children and friends so they know 
when they need to call for help.
 
✓ Don’t turn to drugs or alcohol for courage.
 
✓ Leave a note that explains how to contact you through your attorney.
 
✓ Don’t have one last confrontation. Leave when your partner is out of the 
house and very unlikely to return during your exit.
We realize that many of these recommendations may sound harsh or even 
Draconian to you. However, if you’re truly at risk for abuse based on past his-
tory, not taking these steps can put your safety in serious jeopardy.

Keeping your children from being exposed to violent conflict is extremely 
important. Witnessing violence inevitably harms kids.
Leaving nonabusive relationships 
if you decide to do so
On the other hand, not every relationship with someone who has BPD is 
seriously abusive. Sometimes people decide to leave a relationship simply 
because it’s extremely unsatisfying. If you’re in a similar situation, you may 
wish to consider the following guidelines:
 
✓ Plan ahead. Discuss legal issues with an attorney before you talk with 
your partner.
 
✓ If you’re certain of your decision, don’t make further attempts at 
reconciliation.
 
✓ Remain calm. Deliver your message clearly, but don’t say it over and 
over again. Your partner doesn’t need an elaborate explanation. Keep 
the message simple, short, and focused.
 
✓ Unless your partner’s issues have softened and become milder over 
time, we generally recommend that you avoid further contact after you 
leave. Obviously, in the case of children and shared custody, you don’t 
have a choice in the matter.
 
✓ When you tell your partner about your decision, don’t allow his or her 
negotiations or promises to change deter you.
 
✓ Follow through by leaving soon after you have your discussion with 
your partner. Remaining in the household can be risky even when abuse 
hasn’t occurred before. Consider having a few friends or relatives avail-
able as an emergency backup if things go worse than you anticipated.
 
✓ Expect that your partner with BPD will likely be extremely upset and 
distraught because of her fears of abandonment. This reaction isn’t 
your fault, and you can’t prevent it. You may receive a bombardment of 
e-mails, text messages, begging, calls, threats of suicide, or even stalk-
ing. Consult with a therapist for help with these issues. You may even 
need to inform police about especially threatening behaviors on the part 
of your ex-partner.
Once you have left, realize that you’ll likely go through some degree of 
mourning the loss of what could’ve or should’ve been. People with BPD can 
be loving, exciting, and interesting, so the loss may be great even though you 
know you really needed to leave. Again, we suggest seeing a therapist if you 
find the emotions from ending the relationship difficult to deal with.

W
e’ve never seen a person with borderline personality disorder (BPD) 
wear a T-shirt that announces to the world, “I have BPD!” Okay, one 
or two of those shirts are probably around somewhere, but they’re definitely 
not a common sight. Come to think of it, maybe we could design one and 
make millions — or maybe not.
Thousands, if not millions, of people function in this world without divulging 
their diagnoses to co-workers and even friends. People with BPD don’t neces-
sarily stand out in a crowd. They look the same as everyone else. After all, 
they don’t have any outward physical signs of the disorder, and many days in 
many situations, they don’t act differently than other people, either.
At first, people with BPD generally don’t have major social problems. As a 
matter of fact, sometimes they’re especially charming and interesting. Often, 
a person befriends someone with BPD without having an inkling that he or 
she has a personality disorder. Later, events and emotions often turn in 
totally unexpected directions.
In this chapter, we take a look at the first signs of BPD within a friendship. We 
explore some of the issues that can become more serious and problematic. 
Then we supply some pointers on how to help your friend without falling 
into the dangerous rapids yourself. Finally, we look at how to handle serious 
threats to the safety of you or someone you care about and how to end a rela-
tionship with someone with BPD if you decide to do so.

Recognizing Warning Signs of BPD
The sooner you detect signs of BPD in a new friend, the better off you are. 
Recognizing that a friend has BPD early in your relationship may help you 
avoid making excessive commitments and/or becoming enmeshed in a friend-
ship that can engulf your entire life.
 
In case you’re wondering, we aren’t suggesting that you avoid any relationship 
with someone who has BPD. But, we do suggest that you learn as much as you 
can about the disorder and its effects on the people who have it. If you know 
what you’re getting into before you get heavily involved in a relationship with 
someone with BPD, you can set limits, learn not to take everything personally, 
and decide how involved you want to be.
So what signs should you look for in a new friendship? The following warning 
signs can help you determine whether or not you want to take your new rela-
tionship a little more slowly than you have taken other relationships:
 
✓ Too close: Your new friend self-discloses unusually intimate details early 
in the relationship.
 
✓ Too much flattery: You know you’re a good person and everything, but 
when a new friend starts slinging out flattery like slop to a pig, you may 
have a problem. Don’t be beguiled by praise.
 
✓ Too much time: You like spending a lot of time with a new friend, but 
you, like most folks, have a pretty busy life. Be wary about requests for 
more contact with you than your previous friends have wanted.
 
✓ Too much texting/phoning: Yeah, our kids text a lot, and sometimes 
we do it, too. But a new friend with BPD may be inclined to text you 40 
times a day. Be careful with this excessive contact.
 
✓ Too probing: You want to share your life with friends — but not all your 
friends — and trust should evolve slowly over time. If your new friend 
asks you too many personal questions early on, heed the warning sign.
 
✓ Unreliable: Someone with BPD often cancels or arrives late for events, 
dates, get-togethers, and so on. This issue isn’t a big deal unless it 
occurs chronically. If a new friend frequently cancels dates, understand 
that this behavior signals a lack of respect for your time. Always cancel-
ing or arriving late can also be a sign of narcissistic personality disorder 
(see Chapter 3 for more information about this and other personality 
disorders).
 
✓ Too critical: Most people with BPD don’t criticize a friend excessively in 
the beginning of a new relationship. However, if your newfound friend 
indulges in a lot of harsh criticism of other friends or past relationships, 
ask yourself whether you may be next.

281
 Chapter 22: Befriending People with BPD
 
✓ Long history of broken friendships: If you seem to be the only friend 
this person has at the moment, and if your friend recounts numerous 
past friends, you have to wonder, right?
 
The preceding list of warning signs is by no means a method for diagnosing 
your friends! These signs are solely characteristics that can lead to trouble 
in your new relationship at some point. A true diagnosis of BPD requires a 
mental health professional. If you’ve gotten into a friendship that exhibits 
several of the preceding warning signs, we recommend that you consult with 
such a professional.
Becca’s story shows how easily someone can slip into a destructive relationship 
with someone who has BPD. Becca has never known someone with this disorder 
before and finds herself ensnared by something she doesn’t understand.
Becca notices Amber standing by herself at the trail head. Becca has 
been a member of the outdoor singles’ group for awhile. Recalling how 
hard getting involved is at first, she walks over to Amber and introduces 
herself. Amber smiles broadly and tells her how nervous she feels about 
joining a singles’ group. “My divorce was finalized last week, so here I 
am,” Amber says, “I’m hoping to meet a whole new group of friends. My 
ex-husband has convinced everyone we know that I’m crazy and that I 
drink too much. So, not only did I lose my marriage, but I also lost every 
single one of my friends.”
Becca replies, “I’m sorry to hear that. You can be sure that you’ll meet 
lots of people here. We try to mix up our activities. Sometimes we hike 
locally, and we do a lot of volunteer work fixing up trails. Some of us ski 
in the winter, too.”
“Becca,” Amber gives her a hug, “I’m so glad I met you. I know we’re going 
to be best friends. Would you walk with me a ways so we can talk? I really 
need to tell you something.”
“Sure, Amber,” Becca says, a little caught off guard, “I’ll make sure that I 
introduce you to some of the others. What do you need to tell me?”
“Well,” Amber begins, “I thought you should know who my ex-husband is 
in case there’s any trouble.”
“Oh my God, Amber, did he abuse you?”
“No, but he got pretty mad. He’s an attorney, a very prominent attorney, 
and he was really mad at me. You see, when we were together, well, the 
sex was pretty good. But, he worked crazy hours and you know what 
happens. I got bored and lonely, too. So, I was out one night and met a 
guy. Then, you know, we started seeing each other. Buddies, you know. 
Nothing serious. Then my ex found out. I told him it was meaningless 
sex. That I still loved him. But then he got so mad that I couldn’t help it. I 
ended up telling him about the other affairs I had while he was working. 
He had no right to divorce me. I was a good wife, don’t you agree, Becca?”

282
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Becca isn’t sure she really agrees with Amber, but she says, “Well, I guess 
we all have problems.”
Amber grabs her hand, “I knew you’d understand. How about we go out 
after the hike and get a few drinks? Look at that guy over there; he’s cute. 
How many of these guys have you had sex with?”
Becca feels a tad uneasy but likes going out for drinks with new friends, 
so she says, “Sure, that sounds like fun. I’m not sure how many guys I’ve 
had sex with, but not all that many.”
Over the next few weeks, Becca starts spending more and more time with 
Amber, and her disquieting feelings grow. She’s not sure what to do.
Becca didn’t know where to take this relationship. Amber got too close too 
fast. And she spilled unusually intimate details about her life to a stranger. 
Finally, she flattered Amber by saying, “I know we’re going to be best 
friends.” If Becca had known what to look for and recognized the warning 
signs in Amber’s behaviors, she might have had a better idea of what to do in 
this situation. For instance, she might not have gone out for drinks with her 
after the hike, or she might have trusted her uneasy feelings and ended the 
relationship before it started.
 
If a new acquaintance comes on strong like Amber, you may decide to start a 
new friendship anyway. However, we recommend that you proceed slowly and 
cautiously. If you agree to a friendship, you’ll probably want to set some limits 
early on. For example, don’t set up frequent get-togethers, and be cautious 
about what you share with your new friend about your personal life.
Detecting Serious Symptoms
You may have found a new, seemingly best friend and not seen any signs of a 
personality disorder. Or perhaps you ignored the signs. Or maybe your friend 
was better than most at keeping her issues out of view at first. Some people 
with BPD become quite adept at hiding their issues, although, in time, their 
attempts inevitably fail. Someone or something will eventually trigger your 
new friend’s BPD symptoms. The trigger can be something as simple as you 
don’t have enough time to spend with your friend one day, which leads your 
friend to fear abandonment. Or it may be a mix-up in communication that cas-
cades into rage and anger. The one exception is the person with BPD who has 
emerged from highly successful treatment — in which case, he doesn’t have 
anything to hide anymore. Check out Chapter 3 for more detailed information 
about the array of serious symptoms that folks with BPD exhibit.
At some point in your relationship, your friend starts down a path strewn 
with reprehensible behavior. You feel yourself swirling downward, sucked 
in by an enormous whirlpool fueled by inexplicable behaviors, guilt, worry, 

283
 Chapter 22: Befriending People with BPD
and confusion. Never fear, we’re about to toss you a lifeline. The following list 
covers many of the serious signs of BPD (see the next section for ideas about 
how to deal with these nefarious symptoms):
 
✓ Excessive demands: Now, we’re talking serious demands here. For exam-
ple, your friend may start out by merely asking for a few more favors 
than most of your other friends do. But, then the requests escalate into 
more intense demands, such as calls in the middle of the night to deal 
with serious emotional distress. Or a demand that you take your friend 
to the emergency room to avert a suicide attempt.
 
✓ Expectations that you choose a side: People with BPD have many con-
flicts in their intimate relationships, so watch out if your friend bom-
bards you with details about these conflicts and asks you to take his 
side.
 
 
People with BPD often misreport what’s going on in their relationships 
because of their tendency to see people as all good or all bad. Don’t get 
sucked into taking their side in conflicts with their intimate partners. 
You weren’t there, so you can’t know what happened.
 
✓ Unexpected anger or rage: Many people with BPD have trouble regulat-
ing their emotions. Small issues quickly escalate into outbursts.
 
✓ Substance abuse: A lot of people like to drink socially. Moderation is 
often difficult for people with BPD. Be wary of friends who get drunk fre-
quently or who use dangerous drugs. Medication abuse is also common 
in people with BPD.
 
✓ Unnecessary risks: If your friend is a reckless driver, engages in highly 
risky sports, or does anything that frightens you, these behaviors may 
be results of their BPD disorder. Don’t be seduced into joining them.
 
✓ Self-harm: If your friend engages in self-destructive behaviors, such as 
cutting, burning, or purposely self-inflicting any other kind of pain, your 
friend has a serious problem. Threats of suicide fall into this self-harm 
category, and you shouldn’t trivialize them.
 
 
If your friend threatens suicide, make sure that he sees a professional 
right away. If he refuses to get help, deciding how serious his threat is 
isn’t up to you — call 911 for help.
Handling Friends with BPD
So, what should you do if your friend has been diagnosed with BPD or if he 
or she shows serious signs like the ones in the preceding section? Basically, 
dealing with a friend with BPD falls into two categories — what you can do 
and what you can’t do.

284
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
What you can do
A friend with BPD can be funny, kind, enthusiastic, bright, and interesting. 
You may want to maintain a relationship with a friend with BPD because 
he exhibits those qualities. But, that same friend may also seem to take 
advantage of you and involve you in situations that seem unhealthy. To stay 
friendly but to stop feeling stepped on, consider the following points:
 
✓ Be calm. A friend with BPD is likely to provoke you from time to time 
with obnoxious behavior (see Chapter 3 for a full list of potential symp-
toms and problematic behaviors associated with BPD). If you get irri-
table or angry, you only make things worse. Being calm, on the other 
hand, can communicate a good message to your friend. Remaining calm, 
however, doesn’t mean you can’t set reasonable limits or boundaries 
with your friend.
 
✓ Set reasonable boundaries. Know what your personal limits are. 
Sometimes people with BPD can make you think your limits are exces-
sive, if not a little crazy. If you find yourself confused about your own 
rights and limits as a friend, ask someone who doesn’t have BPD for 
feedback. Another good way to evaluate your boundary decisions is to 
ask yourself what you’d tell someone else in your situation. After you 
know what’s reasonable, say it and stick with it. Waffling only invites 
abuse.
 
✓ Remind yourself that your friend isn’t intentionally malicious. People 
with BPD don’t consciously and methodically set out to anger or hurt 
you. BPD has deep roots in childhood, culture, and biology. People don’t 
choose to develop BPD. Thus, you want to depersonalize your friend’s 
obnoxious behavior — remember that it’s not about you.
 
✓ Keep your expectations reasonable. Of course you want to appreciate 
your friend’s positive qualities, but you also have to expect a certain 
degree of criticism, disapproval, rejection, and unpredictability. As we 
describe in a preceding bullet, you need to know what’s acceptable 
to you, and when you see something that isn’t, know how you want to 
respond. You can’t expect people with BPD to demonstrate only their 
positive qualities all the time.
 
✓ Think about what information to share. You may have a few trusted 
friends with whom you feel comfortable sharing your most deeply held 
secrets. In general, we don’t recommend that degree of openness and 
trust with someone who has BPD. Unfortunately, the impulsivity associ-
ated with BPD (see Chapters 3 and 5 for more information on this par-
ticular symptom) is likely to lead to breeches of trust. People with BPD 
may sincerely agree to keep something confidential, but they often find 
themselves talking without thinking later on.
The following story about Haley and Michelle demonstrates the kind of limit 
setting you may need to do with a friend who has BPD.

285
 Chapter 22: Befriending People with BPD
Haley has been good friends with Michelle for many years. They work 
downtown and often meet for lunch. Although Michelle has BPD, she’s 
constantly striving to work on her issues and has been in therapy for the 
past four years.
Haley works out three times a week at a local gym. One day at lunch, 
Michelle asks Haley if she can start working out with her. Haley agrees. 
Over the course of the next few months, Michelle frequently cancels at 
the last minute, and when she does show up, she’s chronically late. At 
other times, Michelle asks Haley to change her gym schedule to accom-
modate her, and Haley usually tries to do so. But Haley feels annoyed and 
starts to avoid Michelle.
Then Haley reevaluates her commitment and friendship with Michelle. 
She thinks about some of Michelle’s positive qualities, such as her great 
sense of humor, her willingness to help when needed, and her political 
knowledge. However, she realizes that she needs to set limits with her 
friend about the gym so that she doesn’t reject her.
Haley decides that she’ll stick to her gym schedule and not count on 
Michelle to show up. She tells Michelle that to keep herself healthy she 
needs to go to the gym three times a week at certain times. If Michelle 
is late, Haley will go on without her. If Michelle wants to change the day 
and time, Haley probably won’t go along unless it’s really convenient for 
her. Michelle feels angry about Haley’s limit setting, but she agrees, not 
having any other real choice. Haley later sets limits with Michelle about 
several other issues in their relationship.
If you have a friend with BPD, carefully consider the issues that you could 
improve by setting limits like Haley did. You can’t expect the moon from your 
friend, but you certainly have the right to stand up for yourself, to not accept 
abuse, and to not allow someone else to consistently trample your time and 
schedule.
 
Friendships are two-way streets. You may not receive as much from a friend 
who has BPD as you do from your other friends, but you have to get some-
thing positive from the relationship for it to be healthy. Friendships are 
choices — if you feel trapped by a friendship, talk with a friend, a spiritual 
advisor, or even seek therapy for yourself to figure out what’s going on.
What you can’t do
People with BPD often seek support from others whenever they can. They 
have chronic, deep emotional distress and desperately look for relief. In 
many cases, asking friends for special favors and advice isn’t unusual. 
Sometimes they even plead with their friends to intervene on their behalf 
in conflicts. As the friend of someone with BPD, you can easily find yourself 
feeling engulfed by the friendship and feeling intense guilt about not always 
being there for your friend.

286
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
We cover what you can do to help maintain a relationship with someone with 
BPD in the previous section, and now we offer some advice about what to 
avoid in that same friendship.
 
✓ Don’t be your friend’s therapist. In general, you want to help your 
friends. You probably even give advice to your friends on occasion. But 
we’re going to give you some advice — don’t let yourself take on the 
role of your friend’s therapist! Even when you think you know what your 
friend should do, don’t offer that advice because people with BPD need 
much more than suggestions for what to do. When you start acting like a 
therapist, you soon find yourself overwhelmed and drained.
 
✓ Don’t mediate between someone with BPD and others. People with 
BPD get in numerous conflicts with other people — co-workers, spouses, 
partners, and friends. And when they do, they try to gather support for 
their cause. They may ask you to intervene on their behalf or serve as 
a mediator. Don’t agree to such requests. You’re probably not a trained 
mediator, anyway, and, as a friend, you can’t bring objectivity and neu-
trality to the table.
The following story about Brandon and Peter illustrates how people with BPD 
can convince their friends to intervene in their personal problems. Brandon 
jumps into trying to help his friend Peter and later regrets it. Remember that 
the situation is rarely as black and white as someone with BPD describes it 
to be.
Brandon and Peter sit next to each other at the new-employee orienta-
tion for physician assistants. Peter is changing jobs to be closer to home, 
and Brandon is a new graduate. By the end of the day, they discover that 
they’re both avid golfers. They exchange phone numbers and set up a 
golf date for the following week.
Brandon and Peter’s friendship grows quickly despite family obligations 
and busy schedules. One day after golf, Peter shares with Brandon that 
he’s having trouble with his wife. Surprised, Brandon asks him what’s 
going on. Peter tells Brandon, “I give my wife everything, but it isn’t 
enough; she wants me to agree to a big house. We can’t afford it, but she 
won’t listen to me.”
Brandon is pretty sure he knows how much money Peter makes because 
they’re both in the same position at the same hospital. He asks Peter, 
“What does she want? A mansion?”
“No, she wants a four-bedroom house with a family room for the kids,” 
Peter replies.
“Well, you should be able to afford that with your salary and bonuses, 
Peter,” Brandon says.
“I could, but she has a spending problem. As a matter of fact, she’s out 
of control. Brandon, would you consider talking to her? I just can’t get 
through to her at all, and she respects you,” Peter pleads.

287
 Chapter 22: Befriending People with BPD
“Gosh, Peter, I’d feel pretty funny talking to your wife about her spending. 
And I’m not sure what I would say,” Brandon answers.
Peter responds, “You’d just have to tell her that she shouldn’t be looking 
at new houses in this economy. You might tell her a bit about budgeting. 
Nothing deep, that’s all.”
Brandon reluctantly agrees. Peter’s wife is angry that her husband dis-
cussed their problems outside the marriage. First, she tells Brandon that 
it’s none of his business. Then, she tells him that this isn’t the first time 
that Peter has used his friends to address their marriage problems.
During the conversation with Peter’s wife, Brandon learns that Peter has 
a serious gambling problem and that he has been diagnosed with BPD. 
Brandon doesn’t know who to believe. He regrets ever getting involved.
Peter, like many people with BPD, sometimes manipulates people to solve 
his personal problems. He doesn’t tell the entire truth, and Brandon finds 
himself in over his head. Thus, you should avoid getting in the middle of your 
friends’ conflicts even when they make you feel guilty or responsible.
Dealing with Dangerous Situations
When you’re friends with someone with BPD, you may rarely see the darker 
times. People with BPD sometimes keep their symptoms hidden from cer-
tain people for long periods of time. However, the closer your friendship 
becomes, the more likely your friend with BPD is to let his true feelings show.
The most difficult and frightening times are those in which your friend with 
BPD threatens to hurt or kill himself. How do you manage to help your friend 
without getting hurt yourself? The following points can help:
 
✓ Know that self-mutilation and suicide threats are common symptoms of 
BPD. You’re not responsible for your friend’s pain.
 
✓ Tell your friend that you understand that he’s hurting and that the 
threat of hurting himself is part of his disorder.
 
✓ Attempt to distract your friend, and encourage him to do something that 
has helped him in the past.
 
✓ Stay disconnected. Don’t get emotional or try to use logic to figure out 
the situation.
 
✓ Refuse to witness the self-abuse or mutilation.
 
✓ Get help. If you feel that your friend may act dangerously, call for help. 
If your friend has a therapist, start there. Don’t wait this out. Your friend 
has made a threat, and you have to take him seriously. Don’t hesitate to 
call the police if you’re fearful for your friend’s life.

288
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
 
✓ Get information and education about BPD (start by reading the rest of 
this book). If you decide to stay in the friendship, consider joining a sup-
port group for families and friends of people with mental disorders, such 
as National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI). (For more information 
on this group, check out www.nami.org.)
Ending a BPD Relationship
If you’re in a relationship with someone who has BPD, you may decide to pull 
the plug on the relationship at some point. Your friend may have worn you 
out with demands and requests for advice and help, or he may have drained 
you dry with drama day in and day out. If you do decide to end the relation-
ship, you may wonder how to do so, and you may wrestle with guilt over 
abandoning someone who has so many needs. We cover these issues in the 
next two sections.
Making your exit
You can probably think of countless ways to leave a friendship — after all, 
Paul Simon came up with a whopping fifty ways to leave a lover. His point 
was that any method works, and that’s true when you’re leaving someone 
with BPD, too. But we offer a few specific words of advice to keep in mind 
when you decide to end a relationship with a friend who has BPD.
 
✓ Make the message short and clear. Don’t recite a laundry list of rea-
sons; someone with BPD isn’t likely to hear or process it anyway.
 
✓ Don’t reason with your friend. The moment you say you’re ending the 
friendship, your friend won’t be able to listen to logic or reasoning.
 
✓ Tell your friend in a public place. This piece of advice may seem a little 
unfair. After all, your friend may feel emotional and be embarrassed to 
express himself in front of others. However, you’re safer when people 
are around. If you’re absolutely certain that your friend has no history of 
rage or violence, you can consider a private conversation.
 
✓ Writing a letter is okay. Especially if your friend has ever shown rage or 
other signs of potential for violence, you can communicate in writing.
 
✓ Don’t waffle. After you’ve made the decision to the end the relation-
ship, don’t let your friend talk you out of it. People with BPD hate feeling 
abandoned, so your friend may try out all sorts of ways to convince you 
to remain friends. Remind yourself beforehand that you’ve made your 
decision and that you will stick to it — no matter what your friend says 
or does. Waffling will only prolong the pain for both of you.

289
 Chapter 22: Befriending People with BPD
 
✓ Remain calm. Your friend may become very emotional whether it be 
tears, fears, or anger. You may want to practice what you’ll say and how 
you’ll say it by yourself or with another friend before your confrontation.
 
✓ Don’t go back later. Your friend may surprise you and remain calm, 
accepting what you have to say. In this kind of situation, the temptation 
to reconsider may increase. Perhaps your friend will attempt to recon-
nect in a few weeks or months. Again, if your reasons for ending the rela-
tionship were sound, don’t be swayed to reenter the relationship.
 
Ending friendships is never a fun thing to do, but you have a right to expect a 
friendship to make you feel good. Don’t let a friendship make you feel miser-
able. After all, life’s too short for that.
Wrangling with guilt
Most people who decide to end any friendship feel a certain amount of guilt 
in doing so, but those who end relationships with people with BPD feel espe-
cially guilty because they recognize that their friends need a lot of help. They 
may think that they were just as responsible for encouraging and fostering 
the relationship as their friend with BPD was, and that may be true. But even 
when you played an important role in bringing this person into your life, you 
aren’t forever beholden to your friend. Consider the following points:
 
✓ You probably didn’t realize your friend had BPD when the relationship 
began. Even if you did, you likely didn’t foresee the destructive impact 
the friendship had on your life.
 
✓ You have a right to friendships that don’t leave you in a constant state 
of worry.
 
✓ Even if your friend with BPD has done many wonderful things for you, 
you can’t conclude that you owe that person a lifelong friendship in 
return. Many people with BPD are skilled at extending themselves in 
extraordinary ways to their friends, especially at the beginnings of rela-
tionships. But they all too often inflict an inordinately large emotional 
toll in other ways at the same time.
 
✓ Your guilt may boil over if your friend threatens self-harm or suicide 
when you try to end the relationship. Please realize that such threats 
amount to emotional blackmail. You can’t hold yourself responsible 
for someone else’s self-destructive behavior. Consult with a therapist if 
you feel overwhelmed in your relationship or in ending it. Also, read the 
“Dealing with Dangerous Situations” section earlier in this chapter.

We’re not recommending that you end a relationship with someone who has

good and bad qualities but truly feel worth it overall. If you’re struggling with

eople in the mental health field debate at what age you can first diag-
nose someone with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other 
personality disorders. BPD consists of a pattern of unstable relationships, 
impulsivity, and moodiness (as discussed in Chapter 3), all three of which are 
common behaviors in teenagers. The two sides to this debate are
 
✓ The argument for not making a diagnosis until age 18 is based on the fact 
that children and adolescents change so much over the course of their 
development.
 
✓ The argument for making a diagnosis, when the symptoms are present, 
is that you can start appropriate treatment early.
In our opinion, whether or not the diagnosis is official, treatment for the 
symptoms of BPD can start in adolescence. Furthermore, the presence of risk 
factors and early signs of BPD warrant some family interventions.
In this chapter, we examine the early warning signs of BPD. We discuss some 
risk factors that parents should be aware of and give advice on how to get 
help. Finally, we provide some tips to the parents of children and adolescents 
who may be developing BPD.

Heeding Early Warning Signs
The differences between a 2-year-old, a 12-year-old, and an 18-year-old are 
huge. Children grow, mature, and change quickly. At the same time, some 
consistencies occur across ages. For example, a mother may describe her 
2-year-old boy as fearless because he runs instead of walks, climbs onto 
things, and gets into a lot of mischief. That same boy at age 12 may show the 
same trait of fearlessness, but his actions may have changed to rock climbing, 
water skiing, and taking off alone on long walks. At age 18, he may be inter-
ested in extreme sports, show no fear of talking in public, and demonstrate 
unusual independence. The trait of fearlessness, like many traits, carries on 
throughout the boy’s life, but it shows up in different ways at various ages.
Much like the fearlessness in the preceding example, overly reactive emo-
tions, a major symptom of BPD, can show up early on in a child’s life. 
Toddlers with this trait may have a hard time going to bed without having 
a tantrum, they may have trouble sharing with other kids, and they may get 
extremely emotional when they’re separated from their caregivers. At school 
age, children with emotional instability may get overly upset when they 
receive negative feedback, engage in frequent squabbling with classmates 
when they disagree with them, and have meltdowns when they’re frustrated. 
Teens with such emotional instability may have frequent bouts of anger, anxi-
ety, or rage. From these examples, you can see that certain traits can persist 
over the course of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
Identifying problem behaviors
The following list represents worrisome behaviors and reactions that your 
kids may exhibit from time to time. Even if your child hasn’t been diagnosed 
with BPD, these symptoms are worth checking out and addressing.
 
✓ Intense emotional overreactions: The slightest frustration can set off 
these reactions. For example, your kid may overreact when she misses 
the bus, gets a B on a test instead of an A, forgets her homework, or isn’t 
allowed to stay out late one night. The emotional reaction to events like 
these may include crying, screaming, rocking, throwing a fit, or swearing.
 
✓ Defensiveness in response to perceived slights: Your child or adoles-
cent may respond with severe rage, outbursts, or despondency when 
she isn’t picked for a team or a school play, when a friend doesn’t invite 
her to a party, when a teacher criticizes her, or when she experiences a 
similar rejection.
 
✓ Paranoid thinking: When your teen walks into the school cafeteria and 
sees that the kid she wanted to sit next to has no seat saved for her, she 
may respond with jealous outrage that her friend would deliberately 
reject her in that way. Behaviors like this one may point to a paranoid 

293
 Chapter 23: Parenting Children at Risk for BPD
style of thinking. Other examples of responding to situations in a para-
noid manner include believing that others are plotting against her, 
thinking that the teachers have it in for her, or worrying that people are 
always watching her.
 
✓ Cutting: If you ever see scars, open wounds, or other signs of cutting 
along your teen’s arms, legs, or torso, seek a mental health consultation 
as soon as possible. The only exception is if you hear a logical, plausible, 
coherent story that explains why the marks are on your teen’s body — 
and you don’t see a reappearance of them.
 
✓ Other self-mutilation: Other signs of self-mutilation behavior include 
burns, pin marks, and repeated “accidental” actions that result in bodily 
harm. You need to realize that your teen probably won’t be able to 
disclose these behaviors easily and may very well lie to keep you from 
knowing what’s going on. More often than not, teens cover up self-harming 
behaviors to avoid feeling intense shame from letting their parents know 
about their troubles.
 
✓ Intense, unstable relationships: Okay, teens often have fairly unstable 
relationships. But most kids have a few friendships that last for years. 
If your child or adolescent has a pattern of acquiring friends, feeling 
unusually intense about those friends, and then dumping them for inex-
plicable reasons, you may want to encourage your teen to seek out help.
 
✓ Threats of violence: Kids sometimes say they “hate” their parents. 
Occasionally, they may even scream that they want to kill them. 
However, if your child starts to destroy property, take swings at you, or 
threaten violence to friends or teachers, you need to take these threats 
seriously. We strongly recommend that you and your child consult with 
a mental health professional.
 
✓ Eating disorders: Eating disorders vary from being excessively con-
cerned about gaining weight to drastically limiting food intake to binging 
(eating unusually large quantities of food at a single sitting) to purging 
(self-induced vomiting or excessive laxative usage) to exercising exces-
sively to control weight. If you notice these or other signs of eating dis-
orders in your child, seek out a professional evaluation because these 
disorders can be deadly.
 
✓ Impulsivity/sensation seeking: Teens and impulsivity go together like 
French fries and ketchup. However, the kind of impulsivity we’re talking 
about here is more extreme than what most teens do. Many teens exper-
iment with a shoplifting incident or two, but getting caught once usually 
ends their experiments for good. Problematic impulsivity in teens refers 
to behaviors like repeated, serious shoplifting, promiscuous sexual 
behaviors, unusually reckless driving, uncontrolled spending, heavy 
substance abuse (as opposed to experimentation), and frequent damag-
ing of property. Again, many teens bang up a fender now and then, but 
you should be concerned if car accidents occur as a result of wild, reck-
less driving. If you’re not sure whether your teen’s behavior falls into 
this category, check with a professional.

294
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Pursuing a diagnosis
Many children show these sorts of emotional responses or behaviors at 
times. Kids go through stages or have reactions to stress that seem pretty 
extreme. Furthermore, teenagers show many of the symptoms of BPD at 
some point. What teenager isn’t at least occasionally impulsive, dramatic, 
emotionally reactive, and irritable? For a mental health professional to diag-
nose teens with BPD, the symptoms must be over the top and out of the ordi-
nary, and they must persist across multiple situations. In other words, just 
because your teen is rebellious and grouchy doesn’t mean he or she has BPD.
Parents want to understand and help their children. However, parents love 
their children so much that they can’t be totally objective in their visions of 
them.
 
If your child or teen shows some of the warning signs we describe in the pre-
ceding section, you may want to consult with a mental health professional 
who has experience with diagnosing children and adolescents. Although an 
experienced professional may avoid giving a diagnosis of BPD to a child or 
adolescent, you need to understand that some type of treatment may still be 
useful. Talk to the therapist about what types of treatment are available.
Looking at Risk Factors
We suggest that you read Chapter 4 for detailed information about the vari-
ous risk factors for BPD, especially if your child exhibits a few of the warning 
signs we describe in the “Identifying problem behaviors” section of this chap-
ter. If your child not only shows troubling behaviors similar to those of BPD, 
but also has several risk factors for developing BPD, your concerns should 
increase. In that case, you need to seek a professional consultation sooner 
rather than later. Risk factors of particularly acute concern include the 
following:
 
✓ Family turmoil: Divorces, serious marital conflict, financial struggles, 
and frequent moves are examples of stressors that can afflict families — 
especially children.
 
✓ Genetics: If one of your child’s close relatives has BPD or some other 
serious mental disorder, your child’s risks increase.
 
✓ Abuse or trauma: If your child has been abused by one or more parents, 
relatives, peers, or teachers, the risk of BPD occurring in your child 
increases.

295
 Chapter 23: Parenting Children at Risk for BPD
 
✓ Early separation or loss: Children who experience the loss of a parent, 
sibling, or close relative, especially multiple times, have a higher risk of 
developing a serious emotional problem such as BPD.
 
✓ Inadequate parenting: Sometimes when parents are very young or 
when their own parents served as challenging, difficult role models, they 
simply don’t know how to parent effectively. Ineffective parenting also 
increases the risks of BPD occurring in your child.
Note that some of these risk factors directly relate to parents, whether as a 
result of parental conflict, poor parenting, or abuse. Does this mean we’re 
blaming parents for their kids’ BPD? In a word, no. The causes of BPD are 
many, and figuring out the specific cause for any given person is impossible 
to do.
However, we aren’t completely letting parents off the hook, either. If you feel 
like you’ve blown up at your kids more often than you would’ve liked, not 
known how to handle your kids’ challenging emotions, and/or been in a high-
conflict marriage, you can probably profit from consulting a mental health 
professional for assistance. Raising kids is a daunting job, and most parents 
feel inadequate at times. When your child shows signs of an emotional distur-
bance, the task grows exponentially in difficulty — whether you contributed 
to the cause or not.
 
Even if you haven’t been a perfect parent (whatever that is), and even if you 
contributed to your child’s problem, now is the time to step up to the plate. 
Be part of the solution, not just the problem.
Finding the Right Help
Researchers haven’t completed many studies on what works for children and 
teens with BPD symptoms. Part of the reason for this lack of scientific study 
is the reluctance most professionals have in diagnosing kids under the age 
of 18 with BPD — instead, they often diagnose kids who exhibit BPD symp-
toms with other more “kid-appropriate” disorders. So your child may present 
with BPD symptoms but receive a diagnosis of one of the following disorders 
rather than BPD:
 
✓ Conduct disorder: This diagnosis involves a pattern of behavior that 
includes destruction of property, aggression, rule breaking, and 
deceitfulness.
 
✓ Oppositional defiant disorder: Kids with this disorder exhibit a pat-
tern of hostile behaviors, including arguing with adults, becoming easily 
angered, blaming others, and being touchy or easily annoyed.

296
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
 
✓ Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder is a complicated diagnosis that 
generally includes alterations of mania (for example, feeling grandiose, 
sleeping poorly, or talking too fast) and depression. See Chapter 3 for 
more information, or read Bipolar Disorder For Dummies by Candida Fink 
and Joe Kraynak (Wiley).
 
✓ Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: AD/HD includes problems with 
controlling impulses, interrupting others, waiting, fidgeting, focusing, 
and making careless mistakes.
More than one-third of adolescents hospitalized for psychiatric reasons have 
at least some features of BPD. A minority of these kids will receive the BPD 
diagnosis in later years, but most of them won’t. Nevertheless, you can use 
the same strategies professionals use for treating BPD to address many of the 
symptoms of other problems.
 
Getting the correct diagnosis is less important than getting a good picture of 
the symptoms your child or adolescent suffers from. If your child or teen has 
symptoms of BPD, you should look for a mental health professional who can 
address the presenting problems. For example, if your teen has trouble with 
substance abuse, you may need to seek a program or therapist who special-
izes in teenage substance abuse. If your teen acts impulsively, you may need 
someone who can help your teen develop a behavioral plan or possibly a 
prescribing professional who can determine whether your child has AD/HD or 
some other kind of impulsivity problem. Furthermore, if your child has symp-
toms of depression, you need to address that symptom by seeking a profes-
sional who has experience in dealing with youth depression.
Special ed for kids with BPD
Children and adolescents with symptoms of 
BPD often have trouble in school. If your child’s 
emotional problems impair her learning, your 
child may qualify for help or accommodations 
at school under the special education umbrella. 
The category of emotionally impaired may allow 
your child to be part of an individualized pro-
gram in school to better meet her unique needs. 
To qualify, your child has to undergo a complete 
educational and psychological evaluation. 
A teacher, a school psychologist, and other 
school professionals generally complete these 
evaluations.
Various parent organizations can help you 
better understand the special education 
programs that many public schools offer. Go

 Chapter 23: Parenting Children at Risk for BPD
Loving Tough
If one of your kids has serious symptoms of BPD, you may discover that 
this child easily becomes the center of the family’s universe. You may find 
yourself considering how each activity, decision, or plan will impact your 
emotionally challenged child. Will she approve, or will your decision set off 
a firestorm of rebellious rage? If you go out for the evening, will your kid be 
safe? Will she harm the baby like she has threatened to do a few times? You 
want to do the right thing for everyone involved — which includes you, your 
emotionally challenged child, and the rest of your family. You want to show 
love and support for your child, but you also have to set limits. Doing both 
isn’t easy.
Supporting without fostering
Some parents feel that with enough love, they can solve the emotional prob-
lems in their children. They worry that they may hurt their children’s self-
esteem if they don’t give them unconditional positive feelings. They hesitate 
to show disapproval, fearing that doing so may trigger rage, self-harm, or 
suicide. So they praise whenever they can and make excuses for their kids’ 
obnoxiousness. They tiptoe around their children’s misbehavior. Such par-
ents defend their kids from the criticism that teachers, coaches, and other 
kids’ parents give them.
Unfortunately, these efforts are misguided. Kids don’t benefit from never 
having to deal with the reality of their behavior. Parents who make excuses 
and overly protect their kids only delay the inevitable consequences — 
broken relationships, self harm, substance abuse, or even jail. Thus, kids 
whose parents protect them from accepting responsibility for their actions 
are much more likely to end up having to be accountable in the court of life 
one day — from bosses, friends, or judges.
One reason parents wrestle with reprimanding their kids with BPD symptoms 
is that, frankly, their kids make doing so very difficult. When kids rage, they 
often shift to a warm and loving mode (for a little while, at least) when you 
give them what they want. Psychologists call this phenomenon negative rein-
forcement. Negative reinforcement occurs when you take something unpleas-
ant away after a behavior occurs. Kids with BPD symptoms often take away 
their negative rage when you give them what they want, and, as a result, you 
feel very reinforced for caving in.
 
Solid self-esteem is based on reality, not false praise and flattery. Confidence 
comes from hard work and follow-through. Kids don’t learn either of these 
important concepts when you constantly cater to their demands.

298
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Telling your kids — even those with serious BPD symptoms — that you love 
them is important. However, you also need to tell them when their behaviors 
are unacceptable. This strategy is called setting limits.
Setting limits
Kids with symptoms of BPD often throw tantrums, disobey rules, and stop 
listening to their parents. In turn, parents become angry and frustrated when 
their children refuse to do what they ask them to do. Obviously, this kind of 
situation isn’t good for parents or children. But how do you set limits when 
you haven’t been consistently doing so up to this point?
We have some suggestions for dealing with typical BPD behaviors in your 
children:
 
✓ Enlist help. If setting limits hasn’t come naturally to you in the past, a 
therapist can help a lot. Therapists can guide you through the process 
of setting limits for your emotionally challenged child and provide a real-
ity check when you’re uncertain about how to set limits. We especially 
recommend a therapist who has been trained in cognitive behavioral 
therapy, which involves teaching specific new ways of thinking and 
behaving as well as setting limits and consequences on behavior. For 
more information, consider reading Cognitive Behavioural Therapy For 
Dummies by Rob Willson and Rhena Branch (Wiley). (In case you were 
wondering, behavioural with a u is the British spelling.)
 
✓ Be specific. Tell your child exactly what you want her to do or not to do. 
For example, don’t tell your kid to stop being a brat, but rather, tell her 
that you want her to speak to you without sarcasm.
 
✓ Be clear. State explicit consequences for inappropriate behavior. For 
example, tell your kid that you will hold back a specific amount of her 
weekly allowance for every infraction of your new rule.
 
✓ Hold firm. After you’ve made a rule, follow through with it. Don’t 
waffle — waffling only makes things worse. Don’t bother setting a rule 
or a consequence that you can’t follow through on. So, for example, 
don’t prohibit TV time completely if you don’t have a way to disable 
the television when you’re out at night.
 
✓ Be calm. If you feel angry, walk away and deal with the situation when 
you calm down. People with BPD symptoms need to see a model of calm 
and the ability to deal with difficult emotions. After all, you don’t want to 
model a BPD behavior.
 
✓ Don’t use reasoning. By all means, give your reason for a rule when 
you set it. Give it once, and don’t get hooked into an emotional dialogue 
about your reasons every time an inappropriate behavior occurs. Don’t 
lecture — your kid knows the reasons.

299
 Chapter 23: Parenting Children at Risk for BPD
 
✓ Don’t listen to arguments. This point elaborates on the previous one. 
Kids love to use arguments, such as “all the other kids do it,” or “you’re 
not fair,” or “my brother doesn’t have to do this,” and so on, to induce 
guilt and convince you that you’re being unreasonable. Getting sucked 
into these arguments makes things worse because your child feels she 
can influence or control you when you stay engaged in the argument.
 
In addition to following the preceding suggestions, we recommend that you 
read The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child: With No Pills, No 
Therapy, No Contest of Wills, by Alan Kazdin (Houghton Mifflin) and Your 
Defiant Teen: 10 Steps to Resolve Conflict and Rebuild Your Relationship by 
Russell Barkley and Arthur Robin (Guilford). These books give you loads of 
information about how to deal with the difficulties that kids and adolescents 
with BPD-like behaviors present.
You may be wondering how to hold firm when your kid escalates to incred-
ible levels, such as threatening bodily harm to siblings — or perhaps making 
suicidal threats.
We’d really like to give you some quick and easy solutions to these dilemmas, 
but the truth is you won’t find any. Kids and adolescents who have BPD often 
learn to put their parents in maddening, unsolvable binds and, thus, end up 
wielding shocking power over everyone in the family. Is there anything you 
can do to cut this Gordian knot? Read the next section to see what we suggest.
Dealing with a dangerous 
or out-of-control child
Don’t even think about trying to deal with problems and threats involving 
potential bodily harm without seeking the help of a skilled therapist. Your 
therapist can help you develop a game plan for even the worst of threats.
 
If your child makes one of these high-level threats for the first time — and you 
haven’t yet involved a therapist — consider taking a trip to the hospital emer-
gency room for an evaluation. Yes, you’re likely to have a long, tedious wait. 
However, that wait alone is a useful consequence that your child has to face 
for having made the threat. If your child made the threat to manipulate you, 
you lessen the probability that your child will try something similar again by 
implementing this consequence. If your child was serious in her threat, you’re 
in the right place to get immediate treatment. In either case, the ER can give 
you a referral for a competent therapist.

300
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
In addition, consider some of the following options for dealing with out-of-
control, dangerous threats and behaviors:
 
✓ 911: If you’re afraid of imminent danger, call 911.
 
✓ Inpatient treatment: Your therapist or the ER usually arranges such 
treatment to stabilize an out-of-control child and arrange for the next 
stage of treatment. Mental health professionals don’t usually encourage 
inpatient treatment on a repeated basis.
 
✓ Residential treatment: In this approach, kids are sent to a controlled, 
residential setting, usually for an extended period of time (generally at 
least a month). At these settings, kids receive individual therapy, group 
therapy, social skills training, miscellaneous therapies, education, and 
structured consequences for their behavior. Mental health professionals 
don’t recommend this approach as often as some others largely because 
of its high expense and uncertain outcomes.
 
✓ Treatment foster care: With this approach, parents temporarily give 
up physical custody of their kids so that foster parents trained in deal-
ing with serious emotional issues can attempt to improve behaviors. 
Although somewhat radical, this strategy can be a lifesaver sometimes. 
Also, your state may pay for the costs. Go to the relevant department 
in your state (sometimes called the Department of Children Youth and 
Families, Department of Human Services, or Department of Social and 
Health Services) to find out whether your state offers this treatment free 
of cost, or at least at a discounted price.
 
✓ Therapeutic boarding schools: Again, this strategy is quite expensive. 
However, these schools are equipped to deal with complicated behav-
ioral and emotional problems, so the benefits of this form of treatment 
may outweigh the costs.
 
✓ Wilderness therapy programs: These programs usually last from one 
to two months and involve teaching kids how to get along with others 
in challenging conditions. Kids are also taught confidence building skills 
through physical activities such as rope skills courses, rock climbing, 
and living outdoors. They can provide a much-needed respite for par-
ents, and they sometimes teach adolescents cooperative survival skills.
 
✓ Other out-of-home placements: Sometimes a caring uncle, grandparent, 
or close family friend may be willing to take on the care of your emotion-
ally challenged child for awhile. If your child has a good, solid relation-
ship with that person and both parties are willing, this option may prove 
useful.
 
Whatever option you choose, the point is to find the care and assistance that 
will allow all your family members to feel safe. You can’t let a child with seri-
ous BPD symptoms put you or your other kids in danger.

301
 Chapter 23: Parenting Children at Risk for BPD
Taking Care of Everyone Else — 
Including Yourself
We assume that you have ensured the safety of your family, as well as that 
of your child with emotional problems. Physical safety comes first. But, after 
you’ve established basic safety, you must attend to the needs of everyone in 
the family, not just your kid with BPD symptoms. Many times, a marriage or 
partnership can come unglued by the stress of having a child with serious 
BPD symptoms.
You can’t let your emotionally challenged child act like a black hole that 
sucks all the attention, focus, and satisfaction out of your family. Parenting a 
difficult child takes energy. A strong partnership and family connection help 
you recharge. In this vein, making sure the family engages in a reasonable 
number of pleasurable pursuits is important — whether the child with BPD 
symptoms tags along or not.
Parenting Adult Kids with BPD
Most people with adult children can look back on their parenting years and 
think of many things they would change if they could. Regret is especially 
poignant when your adult child has BPD. No doubt you can compile a long 
list of mistakes you made.
But one thing you can’t do is make up for where you may have gone wrong 
by trying to fix your adult child’s life. If you try to do so, you may just make 
things worse. Your child is now an adult and has to be responsible for his or 
her own life and recovery.
Yet, your BPD adult child is likely to try and enlist your help, whether in the 
form of finances, advice, or solutions. Here’s our advice to you:
 
✓ Make sure your child is in treatment before considering giving help.
 
✓ If you do decide to provide help, that help should be limited and it 
should be help that you’ve discussed with the professional who’s 
involved in your child’s treatment.
 
 Remember that limiting your help is actually in your adult child’s best 
interest because people with BPD need to figure out how to live their 
own lives. Continued dependency merely reinforces their old patterns.
 
✓ Never try to be your child’s therapist or counselor.

302
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Yes, dealing with an adult child with BPD — or any child with BPD, for that 
matter — can be extremely difficult and energy draining. However, by follow-
ing our suggestions, you can improve your child’s ability to cope. And you 
can pave the way for getting your child appropriate treatment. Finally, you 
can improve the atmosphere for the entire family by not allowing your child’s 
issues to dominate.

aising healthy children takes sacrifice, energy, and commitment. 
Parents with BPD typically lack the resources they need to provide a 
healthy environment for their kids. This lack of resources doesn’t mean they 
can’t be wonderful parents — sometimes. But all too often they become over-
whelmed by their own emotional issues and either neglect, or in the worst 
cases, abuse their kids.
If your parent has BPD, you probably have more than your share of diffi-
cult memories. You may recall times when you felt abandoned or when you 
had to take on excessive responsibilities. You may also remember exciting 
adventures or periods of time when your parents placed you on a pedestal. 
A parent with BPD can alternate from being better than the best of parents to 
the worst of the worst — having a parent with BPD can be quite a ride.
 
We don’t recommend attempting to diagnose any family member with BPD or 
any other emotional disorder. Although we give you information about BPD 
symptoms (see Chapter 3 for details), matching your parent’s behaviors to 
these symptoms doesn’t qualify as a diagnosis. Even describing your parent 
to a professional can’t result in a formal diagnosis because professionals can’t 
diagnose someone without seeing him. Nevertheless, this chapter can be 
useful for adult children who are aware that their parents demonstrate BPD-
like features or for those who know their parents have been diagnosed by a 
professional.
After you grow up, you must deal with your childhood memories as well as 
any ongoing issues with your parents. In this chapter, we show you how to 
accept what happened and how to move forward from the past when one of 

304
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
your parents has BPD. We describe how to understand a parent who has BPD 
and how to set realistic expectations for your relationship with that parent. 
We also give you ideas on how to set boundaries so that you can live a life 
without chaos. Finally, we offer some advice on obtaining support that may 
help you get to a better place.
 
In this chapter, we use parent rather than parents because being raised by one 
parent with BPD is far more common than being raised by two. Obviously, 
exceptions to this rule do show up from time to time.
Mourning the Childhood You Didn’t Have
Perhaps you watch television or movies and see stories of wonderful, 
nearly idyllic families — families made up of children and parents who play 
together, talk to one another, solve problems together, and show warmth 
and love toward one another. Maybe you feel cheated because, unlike these 
TV families, your family was unstable and full of conflict. Well, the families 
on television and in the movies aren’t real. Most families have their ups and 
downs, their strengths and their weaknesses.
But, if you grew up in a family with a BPD parent, your ups may have been 
higher, and your downs were surely lower than most. Chaos and stress 
probably permeated the atmosphere. You have good reason to feel like you 
missed out on something. The following sections can help you understand 
the effects your parent with BPD may have had on you. Not everyone will 
have had the same experience because BPD symptoms vary from person to 
person. By exploring the impact BPD had on your childhood, you can move 
past your past and start living a better life for yourself in the present.
Understanding the impact 
of BPD on children
Children raised by a parent with BPD are at greater risk for depression, sub-
stance abuse, behavior problems, and other emotional disorders than chil-
dren raised by parents without a personality disorder. This high risk makes 
sense when you consider that their parents’ BPD symptoms likely expose 
them to chronic conflicts, threats of violence, substance abuse, and unpre-
dictable emotions throughout their childhoods. The interactions between 
mothers or fathers with BPD and their children negatively impact normal 
development. Table 24-1 lists some common ways that parents with BPD 
relate to their children and some of the impacts that these patterns can have 
on those children.

305
 Chapter 24: Advice for Adult Children of BPD Parents
 
Parents have BPD for a variety of reasons, including biological, social, and psy-
chological factors (see Chapter 4 for more info on the reasons for BPD). Most 
parents want to raise healthy children, but a personality disorder like BPD 
often gets in the way. We present this table so you can better understand how 
you may have been affected by your troubled parent, not as ammunition for 
blaming your parent.
Table 24-1 
The Possible Impact of BPD Parents on Kids
BPD Parent Behaviors
Possible Effects on Kids
Up and down relationships: A BPD parent 
may change partners multiple times.
The unpredictability may lead to feelings 
of intense insecurity, anxiety, and worry, 
as well as fears of abandonment.
Explosiveness: BPD parents often have 
fiery arguments, temper outbursts, and 
even violence or abuse.
This parental model may prevent kids 
from learning how to regulate their 
own emotions. Kids become extremely 
aggressive or depressed.
Splitting: Parents with BPD may lavish 
their kids with praise and love one day 
and bombard them with blame, criticism, 
and scorn the next day.
Splitting may lead children to have 
unstable self-esteems — feeling better 
than others at times and much worse on 
other occasions.
Problems understanding others: BPD par-
ents may not have the ability to read and 
understand their children, and, thus, they 
may lack empathy.
Children have trouble understanding 
their own emotions and those of others.
Dissociation: Parents may be in another 
world and unable to respond to their chil-
dren’s needs.
Children feel neglected and may ulti-
mately develop a sense of emotional 
deprivation, or sometimes they may 
overcompensate by feeling excessively 
entitled.
Impulsivity: Parents with BPD may give in 
to substance abuse, gambling, promiscu-
ity, or other impulsive behaviors.
Children may experience overwhelm-
ing worry or exhibit similar behaviors 
themselves.
Self harm: Some parents with BPD exhibit 
self-harm through suicide attempts, actual 
suicide, or self-mutilation.
Children may become depressed or 
develop similar behaviors of their own.
Neediness: Parents with BPD may be 
unable to meet their own daily obligations 
and thus turn to their kids and burden 
them with excessive responsibilities.
Such kids may develop anxiety or even 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. They 
may also become quite resentful and 
angry. 
Boundary violations: Parents with 
BPD violate parent/child boundaries by 
demanding that their children become 
their best friends or even provide for the 
parents’ emotional needs more than for 
their own.
Such children may overly focus on the 
needs of other people or become so 
confused about their roles that they 
struggle to interact well with peers.

Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
You may notice that many of the effects on kids shown in Table 24-1 are 
consistent with emerging BPD symptoms. This trend makes sense because 
having a BPD parent increases the likelihood that children will develop BPD. 
Their risk also increases for most other emotional disorders, such as anxiety 
and depression.
 
At the same time, you need to realize that you could have a parent with BPD 
and end up with no major emotional problems at all. BPD has many causes; 
thus, predicting who will get it based only on one’s parents is impossible. You 
may not have inherited the relevant genes, or you may have had other positive 
influences that mitigated against your chances of ending up with the disorder.
Reviewing your relationship 
with your parent
The preceding section illustrates how BPD in a parent can affect kids in vari-
ous ways. However, even more valuable to understand is exactly how your 
parent with BPD (or BPD-like traits) affected you and your childhood. In all 
likelihood, you’ve either experienced grief over these effects or you will at 
some point in the future. After all, having a parent with BPD means you lost 
something very significant — specifically, the childhood that all kids want to 
have.
And, unless you’ve had professional help with this issue, that grieving pro-
cess may have yet to surface.
Coming to terms with your grief through Grief Exploration Questions
You can begin to resolve grief by reviewing all facets of the relationship you 
had or still have with your BPD parent. Consider answering the following 
Grief Exploration Questions about this relationship:
 
✓ What was your childhood like with this parent?
 
✓ What did you value about your parent, and what was problematic 
for you?
 
✓ What did you learn from your parent (including good and bad)?
 
✓ What resentments do you carry today from your relationship with this 
parent?
 
✓ What about that parent do you feel grateful for?
 
✓ How would your life be different today (in both good and bad ways) if 
your parent hadn’t had BPD?

307
 Chapter 24: Advice for Adult Children of BPD Parents
 
✓ What things could your parent not provide for you that you found 
through someone else (such as your other parent, a friend, a relative, or 
a teacher)?
 
Taking a close look at remembrances from the past, such as old photo albums, 
school report cards, letters, or long-forgotten diaries can facilitate your 
review.
Take time to mull over your answers to these questions. Notice your feel-
ings as you do. You may experience some angst or pain as you ponder these 
issues. Discussing your answers and feelings with a highly trusted friend or 
perhaps your siblings (if you feel close to them) may be useful to you. If your 
feelings are especially painful or difficult, consider seeking professional help 
to resolve them.
 
The point of grieving is to fully appreciate the meaning of your relationship 
with a problematic parent. As you understand this relationship — the good, 
the bad, and the ugly — you may find yourself more able to let go and move 
on. Carrying resentment and anger only causes you harm — holding on to 
these emotions doesn’t change your past or your future.
Expressing your feelings
After you’ve thoroughly processed your childhood relationship, consider 
writing a letter to your parent with BPD. We generally don’t recommend 
actually sending the letter to your parent because the point isn’t to change 
your parent or extract an apology. Rather, the intent is to give you an outlet 
through which you can express your feelings. On the other hand, if you’re 
working with a therapist who recommends sending such a letter, you may 
find value in doing so.
The following story about Ella, who is now 32 years old, illustrates what can 
happen when an adult child actively reflects on her childhood with a mother 
who has BPD.
Ella remembers celebrating her 12th birthday in a hospital’s emergency 
room. Her mother had taken another overdose of medications, and the 
wait on a Saturday night was long. As her mother faded in and out of 
awareness on a gurney, some of the nurses learned of her birthday and 
bought her a pastry from the vending machine. They found a couple of 
used birthday candles at the nurses’ station and sang happy birthday to 
her at around 2 a.m. Ella’s mother had been diagnosed with BPD, and this 
was her fourth hospitalization after attempting suicide.
Years and many sessions of therapy later, Ella still worries about her 
mother. But now she feels ready to say goodbye to the resentment and 
anger that have poisoned her life. After reviewing her answers to the 
Grief Exploration Questions, she writes this letter to her mom:

308
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Dear Mom,
Hope you’re doing okay. I know I don’t call you very much, and when I see 
your name on my caller ID, I don’t answer. You probably feel pretty hurt by 
that and I’m sorry.
I remember all the family therapy we had when I was a teenager. We never 
seemed to be able to spend any time talking without one of us getting mad. 
I lost a lot of years not being able to get over my anger and resentment 
of you.
But lately I’m doing better, and I wanted to get a couple of things off my 
chest. First, there’s nothing scarier to a child than having a mother try to kill 
herself. I can’t tell you how frightened I was. At the same time, I was furious 
with you, with the doctors who didn’t seem to help, and with everyone else 
in the world. I was just so angry and scared. That’s pretty much how I felt — 
all the time.
I never once thought about how much you must have suffered, too. And 
I blamed myself for not being able to help you. Now I understand that I 
couldn’t help or understand; I was too young. I’ve learned a lot about bor-
derline personality disorder, and now I see that you probably did the best 
you could and that I couldn’t do anything to make you better. I do recall how 
much fun you could be when you felt well. I know you tried. And a few times 
you were there for me. Maybe at some point I’ll try calling you again from 
time to time. But for now, I need to maintain some space.
Love, Ella
Although Ella felt ready to write this letter to her mother, she didn’t send it 
because her mother remained unstable. Ella felt better after writing the letter 
to her mom, even though it didn’t change anything, because doing so allowed 
her to let go of some of her bitterness and resentment. Her grief over her lost 
childhood slowly began to lessen.
Moving on with Your Life
You can’t redo your past, but you could remain stuck in it forever if you don’t 
figure out how to forgive and let go. Forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting or 
saying that what happened was okay. Instead, forgiving means allowing your-
self to move forward.
So, now what? You’re an adult with your own life to lead. If your parent 
with BPD still causes you strife and turmoil, you have some work ahead of 
you. You need to set better boundaries with your parent to protect yourself 
and the life you’re living now whether it involves friends, work, a partner, a 
spouse, and/or kids of your own.

309
 Chapter 24: Advice for Adult Children of BPD Parents
Setting boundaries
Boundaries are the limits that people draw around themselves and their lives 
to keep others from constantly interfering. When you’re clear about your 
boundaries, others usually respect them. For example, we have boundaries 
about phone calls — we generally don’t answer the phone after 10:00 p.m. 
unless the caller ID indicates a close friend or family member. We answer 
then because those friends and family members know that we don’t like 
answering the phone late unless it’s something very important or urgent. Our 
friends and family respect this boundary that we set.
People set boundaries around a variety of issues, including needs for space, 
time alone, privacy, and intimacy. People with BPD don’t always understand 
interpersonal boundaries or the need to respect them. Thus, you may have 
to be unusually clear in communicating your expectations to parents who 
have BPD.
To set boundaries with a BPD parent, consider the following issues:
 
✓ Decide what’s important. Ask yourself what you want to set boundaries 
around. Some people consider their personal time paramount. Others 
feel that privacy is critical. Some may decide that any contact with their 
parent would be overly toxic. Remember, deciding what’s important to 
you is your decision.
 
✓ Realize your rights. This issue is often difficult for adult kids to grasp. 
As an adult, you have a perfect right to lead your own life. You and only 
you can be the ultimate judge of what you need and want. Your friends, 
your other parent, your siblings, or others may pressure you to rescue 
your parent with BPD. You’ve probably been down that road many times 
before and found only dead end after dead end. So, you need to make 
the decision as to what works for you. Make your life your priority.
 
✓ Deliver the message. Vagueness, ambiguity, and lack of clarity don’t 
help you set good boundaries. You must give your message as clearly as 
possible, and don’t pull any punches. You also don’t need to be mean or 
rancorous. For example, you may tell a parent, “I won’t take your phone 
calls at work anymore — if need be, I will hang up. My work simply can’t 
be interrupted.” Or, perhaps you tell your parent, “You can’t drink at my 
children’s birthday parties. If you arrive with alcohol on your breath, 
I will insist that you leave. I mean it.” You may also want to tell your 
parent, “I’m not going to discuss my marriage with you any longer.”
 
 And you don’t need to explain why you’re setting these or any other 
boundaries. We aren’t telling you what boundaries to set, but we want 
you to make them clear and explicit like the preceding examples.

310
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
 
✓ Deal with the emotional fallout. You can’t expect your parent to cel-
ebrate your new boundaries. Your parent with BPD is likely to feel 
insulted or rejected by you. Your parent may try to blackmail you with 
guilt. Don’t let your parent persuade you to change your mind. Opening 
the door a crack encourages your parent to barge through, leaving you 
feeling flattened and violated.
 
✓ Adjust your boundaries as needed. Setting boundaries with a problem-
atic parent isn’t a one-time deal. You may feel a need to put up more bar-
riers when your parent is behaving especially badly. In some cases, your 
parent may improve over time, which allows you to loosen the limits a 
little. At other times, your needs may change, which leads you to put up 
either higher or lower barriers.
Setting clear boundaries for the first time can be challenging. Read the next 
section for ideas on obtaining support for your efforts.
Soliciting support
Living with someone who has BPD is very difficult. Being the child of some-
one with BPD can be exquisitely painful. Think of a small child bringing a 
band-aid to a parent who has purposefully cut himself. The feelings of help-
lessness and terror must be overwhelming. You don’t have to wonder why 
adult children of parents with BPD are at greater risk for having emotional 
problems themselves.
So, if you suffer, know that you’re not alone. Others have walked the same 
path and gotten through it. Get help. Here are a few options:
 
✓ Seek therapy from a professional who has experience dealing with BPD.
 
✓ Join support groups and learn about the disorder that disrupted your 
life.

with BPD
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing early signs of BPD
▶ Letting go of your ego and focusing on your client
▶ Setting serious limits — and sticking to them
▶ Taking care of yourself
T
he complexity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) can send shivers 
down the spines of mental health therapists. Clients with BPD present 
with multiple issues, including impulsive behaviors, relationship problems, 
substance abuse, emotional dysregulation, and a high risk of suicide. In fact, 
10 percent of people with BPD eventually do commit suicide. The treating 
mental health professional feels a great deal of anguish and pain when a cli-
ent’s life ends through suicide.
No wonder many therapists feel unprepared to meet the challenges of a 
person with BPD. Other therapists unknowingly accept people with BPD into 
their practices and become enmeshed in an entangled complex relationship 
that eventually spins out of control. Thus, they may find themselves provid-
ing unusual amounts of help, giving special considerations, or feeling angry 
and annoyed with their BPD patients without even knowing why.
At the same time, treating people with BPD can be uniquely rewarding. 
Changes may come more slowly than they do in other cases, and obstacles 
may seem more daunting. But, hanging in there and giving someone with 
BPD the tools and skills she needs for a better life gives you, the therapist, an 
opportunity to use all your talents and training. And nothing is more satisfy-
ing than seeing someone’s life turn around with your help.
In this chapter, we give you some guidelines for recognizing BPD in your 
patients early. We discuss how to be in touch with your own thoughts and 
feelings, as well as how to keep them from interfering with the therapy you’re 
doing. We also make note of the importance of setting reasonable limits with 
all your patients, including those with BPD. Finally, we recommend various 

312
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
ways of taking care of yourself. Therapists need to make sure they meet their 
own needs in various ways if they hope to have the energy and reserves they 
need to take care of challenging patients.
Detecting BPD in the Early 
Stages of Therapy
The sooner you know that a new patient has BPD, the more likely you are to 
be able to manage the therapeutic complexities involved. However, many 
patients with BPD work hard to keep their therapists in the dark about their 
condition. Reasons for this behavior vary from person to person, but in part, 
BPD patients may fear rejection from you, their new therapist. This fear isn’t 
entirely groundless because some therapists prefer not to work with patients 
with BPD. Thus, some BPD patients report having been rejected by several 
therapists in the past.
 
If you don’t feel comfortable treating BPD, try to avoid starting a therapeutic 
process before making a referral. Doing so can cause unnecessary harm to 
your client by exacerbating abandonment concerns. Usually a phone interview 
or an agreement to one to three evaluation sessions prior to starting therapy 
can keep you from taking on someone you shouldn’t.
Our reason for recommending that you detect BPD early in therapy has less 
to do with needing (or wanting) to avoid working with BPD patients and more 
to do with maximizing your awareness of what may be tricky hot buttons for 
your patient. By hot buttons, we mean core issues, such as the following:
 
✓ Fears of abandonment
 
✓ Self-esteem problems
 
✓ Problems with identity
 
✓ Feelings of emptiness
 
✓ Need for constant stimulation
 
✓ Substance abuse issues
 
✓ Problems with boundaries
 
✓ Rage
 
✓ Feelings of entitlement
 
✓ Dysregulated emotions
 
✓ Tendencies to engage in self-harm
 
✓ Relationship struggles
 
✓ Dissociation

313
 Chapter 25: Advice for Therapists of People with BPD
See Chapter 3 for more details about BPD symptoms. When you’re aware that 
your BPD patients may have exquisite sensitivity to any of these issues, you 
can follow a more careful course in your therapeutic dialogues with them. 
Knowing what to avoid and what to address in your dialogues with BPD 
patients helps prevent ruptures in the therapeutic process. 
We suggest that you consider the possibility that clients may have BPD when 
they display the following behaviors, especially in the first few sessions:
 
✓ Report that their past therapists didn’t understand them
 
✓ Give you a long list of previous, inadequate therapists
 
✓ Say their problems are too great to be solvable
 
✓ Miss, cancel, or change appointments, especially at the last minute
 
✓ Desire special considerations, such as after-hours appointments or for-
giveness on bills
 
✓ Try to make sessions run over the time allocation
 
✓ Idealize you — the new therapist — or a previous therapist (including 
subtle or blatant seductive behaviors)
 
✓ Treat you, the new therapist, as a special friend or discuss a previous 
therapist in those terms
 
✓ Appear overly sensitive to your moods or state of health
 
✓ Ask seemingly innocent questions about your family
 
✓ Try to make connections outside of therapy, such as bumping into you 
at stores or local events
 
✓ Reveal knowledge about you that isn’t widely known
 
✓ Report past suicidal behaviors and threats
 
✓ Report past self-harming behaviors, such as cutting
Obviously, the preceding bullets don’t represent a diagnostic checklist for 
BPD — we assume you already know the basics of BPD diagnoses. But, if 
you’re unsure about the diagnosis of an especially complex case, seek profes-
sional supervision and consultation. You may even want to refer the client 
to a psychologist with expertise in assessment for a complete psychological 
evaluation before proceeding with treatment.
 
In addition to looking for these signs in your patients, you need to tune into 
your own feelings. You may find yourself starting to reveal personal informa-
tion without even knowing why. Or, you may feel attracted to or simply quite 
warm toward some clients with BPD symptoms. You may find yourself forgiv-
ing last-second cancellations and special requests. You need to be aware of 
your thoughts and feelings, especially those that are similar to the ones we 
mention here. Of course you care about your clients, but you have to be care-
ful when you feel something out of the ordinary.

314
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
If you don’t keep a check on your feelings, you could easily become ensnared 
in an inappropriate relationship.
 
Working as a mental health therapist can be a lonely job, especially when you 
have a private practice. Because of legal and ethical reasons, you can’t go 
home and tell your family about your day. You have to keep your daily experi-
ences to yourself, which can be a difficult task at times. We recommend that 
all mental health practitioners have either peer supervision groups (with col-
leagues) or regular consultations with other professionals. Doing so is a major 
part of maintaining good practice, but it’s especially crucial when you’re work-
ing with clients with BPD.
Maintaining Objectivity
We, like most mental health therapists, have come across clients who ask for 
help and then, in the same breath, say that they’re helpless. People with BPD 
often present contradictions like this one. The first few sessions may sound 
something like the following:
 
✓ Save me; you can’t.
 
✓ Help me; I’m helpless.
 
✓ I can trust you more than anyone in the world; I won’t tell you how I feel.
 
✓ Give me tools, and I’ll break them.
 
✓ Give me support, and I’ll find ways to test you.
 
✓ Don’t ever leave me; I hate you.
 
✓ Be nice to me; I’ll destroy you.
 
✓ You can’t help me; you’re my only chance.
 
✓ I’ll do anything for you; I’m going to kill myself.
Do any of these scenarios feel familiar? Do you have a sick feeling in the pit of 
your stomach? We understand. Being a therapist for someone with BPD is a 
very difficult task.
However, if you fear dealing with BPD issues like these, you need to get 
therapy and/or supervision, because avoiding having any BPD patients in 
your practice is pretty tough. After all, a variety of studies have estimated 
that around 10 percent of all outpatients have BPD. And, the reality is that 25 
percent or so of therapists eventually lose one or more patients to suicide. 
That percentage is a little higher for psychologists and even higher for psy-
chiatrists, who usually see many more patients.

315
 Chapter 25: Advice for Therapists of People with BPD
If these statistics create overwhelming fear, you may want to consider 
another occupation. However, assuming that you’re interested in treating 
even the difficult patients with BPD (after all, you’re reading this book), you 
need to consider a few issues. First of all, 90 percent of all people with BPD 
don’t commit suicide. Second, therapy does help people with BPD, and so 
does the passage of time. Third, the outcome of any client, with or without 
a diagnosis of BPD, ultimately has as much to do with the client’s efforts as 
those of the therapist. The next two sections may help you hold onto the 
objectivity that is so critical when you’re dealing with challenging clients.
Keeping your therapist ego on the shelf
Therapists by and large love to help people, which is a major reason why 
they’re therapists! Providing people with the care, support, and therapeutic 
guidance they need to reduce their distress and helping to make their lives 
fuller and more meaningful are very rewarding parts of the job.
However, providing psychotherapy to people can’t be about enhancing your 
own ego. Yes, you want to feel good about what you do, and yes, you prob-
ably feel better about yourself when your hard work pays off with a client. 
But you can’t measure your own worthiness by how each individual client 
does in therapy.
 
Psychotherapy is a two-way street. As a therapist, you can only set the opti-
mal conditions for enhancing the likelihood of clients making useful changes 
in their lives. When someone doesn’t go along with your plan, you need to 
know that you’re not a bad therapist or an unworthy human being.
In other words, if you allow your own ego to become intertwined in the rela-
tionships you have with your clients who have BPD, you’ll likely lose the 
objectivity you need to be an effective therapist. By letting your personal feel-
ings take over, you may find yourself allowing boundaries to blur as you feel 
increasingly frustrated, annoyed, and upset with your challenging client.
If you let your feelings override your objective thoughts, you may end up 
doing the very thing your BPD clients fear the most (but expect at the same 
time) — abruptly abandoning them because of your own emotional struggle. 
Alternatively, you may allow yourself to become enmeshed in an inappropri-
ate, unethical relationship that can range from becoming close friends to 
building a sexual liaison. Either relationship ultimately proves harmful to any 
client — especially clients with BPD. If you doubt the truth of this statement, 
ask a few of your colleagues who have experience treating serious personal-
ity disorders about their thoughts on the issue.
In addition to keeping your ego and feelings in check, you also need to fully 
understand what’s reasonable to expect from a therapeutic relationship if you 
want to be an effective therapist. We discuss this topic in the next section.

316
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Keeping therapist expectations 
within bounds
Every therapist needs to understand what to expect from a career as a 
mental health professional. Some of the advantages you can expect from 
such a career include reasonably good pay, some degree of autonomy over 
your work schedule, respect in the community, intellectual stimulation, and 
a variety of interesting colleagues to work with. More important than these, 
however, is the great satisfaction that therapists usually report feeling after 
having played a role in improving their clients’ lives.
 
On the other hand, what you can’t expect from this career is nurturance, sup-
port, friendship, or great gratitude from your clients. Many clients may feel 
appreciative, yet they often don’t express that emotion fully. Some clients may 
leave after a couple of sessions and give you no feedback at all. For other clients, 
you may plant seeds that won’t germinate until years after your work is over. 
In fact, many clients may repeat your ideas back to you some weeks or months 
after you first offer them, attributing the notions to their own insights — a 
situation like this is wonderful because it means they’re making progress!
Understanding Boundaries
Psychotherapists need boundaries, or they may lose control over some of 
the relationships they have with clients. Generally speaking, you want to dis-
cuss a number of issues and boundaries with new clients, as well as provide 
a form for them to sign that states they understand and agree to these limits. 
The details of these limits vary from therapist to therapist, but your list 
should generally include a review of the following items:
 
✓ Timeliness: You should set out some expectations regarding showing 
up on time with every new client. Of course, traffic or other unexpected 
delays occasionally arise, but you can deal with those issues on a case-
by-case basis.
 
✓ Financial arrangements: You should either collect the co-payments or 
insurance deductibles the patient owes at the time of service or bill the 
patient regularly. Whichever method you choose, make sure you go over 
it with your new patient. Allowing bills to accumulate significantly is 
typically a big mistake.
 
✓ Cancellation/no show policies: Therapists vary on how they decide 
to deal with this issue, but you need to lay out the details of your own 
policy at the beginning of therapy and explain that you expect your new 
patient to adhere to this policy.

317
 Chapter 25: Advice for Therapists of People with BPD
 
✓ After-hours availability: This issue is especially controversial in the 
mental health field, and practitioners debate on how to deal with it. We 
have no simple answer for you, but whatever your policy is, you need 
to make it clear to every new client. All clients need to know what to do 
in the event of an emergency, so make sure your policy includes such 
cases.
 
✓ Dual relationships: Mental health professionals strongly discourage 
dual relationships and rarely consider them ethical. However, the issue 
can get quite subtle and perplexing. As a rule of thumb, you don’t want 
to have any relationships with your clients outside therapy that include 
financial transactions, friendships, sexual liaisons, exchanges of other 
services, or favors.
 
✓ Self-disclosure: What therapists decide to disclose about themselves 
to clients — and whether they decide to disclose anything at all — is 
another controversial area. We encourage therapists to seek supervision 
and consultation with colleagues on this issue. If you do decide to judi-
ciously disclose a few personal stories or anecdotes, make sure they’re 
limited. Also, make sure you only tell personal stories for sound thera-
peutic rationales — never do so for your own needs.
 
✓ Bartering: Although some professional groups consider this practice 
acceptable under a few circumstances, we discourage bartering (accept-
ing items or services in return for therapy) in general. The process can 
quickly turn sour.
 
✓ Gifts: Clients often feel quite grateful to their therapists. Sometimes they 
want to express their gratitude with small gifts. Often, homemade good-
ies (cookies and such), a small box of chocolates, an inexpensive coffee 
cup, or a card are acceptable. However, you should be clear that you 
can’t accept expensive gifts, no matter how well intended they may be.
In addition, therapists or the agencies they work for should provide each new 
client with a consent form that discusses reasonable expectations of therapy, 
appropriate therapeutic goals, confidentiality issues, client rights, and pro-
fessionals’ obligations to their clients.
 
Limits, rules, and boundaries may sound rather straightforward and simple on 
paper. However, these issues can quickly become very complex and confus-
ing in practice. Some of your clients are bound to complicate matters at some 
point. People with BPD, for example, sometimes have an exquisite sense of 
how to thread the needle, leaving you bewildered. See the story of Linda and 
her therapist Jim in the section “Dealing with Boundaries” for an example of 
a subtle attempt to cross boundaries. The best advice we can give you is to 
make sure you document all issues related to boundaries, seek continuing 
education and consultation, and be careful. In addition, we strongly recom-
mend that you go to www.kspope.com where you can find an extensive col-
lection of resources about therapeutic boundaries.

318
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Dealing with Boundaries
Therapists sometimes get caught in nets of negativity, or alternatively, tugs 
for crossing boundaries with patients. When either of these situations hap-
pens, treatment can turn into a battle of wills instead of a helping relation-
ship. These traps ensnare all therapists from time to time, but you can do 
your best to minimize them in several ways.
A few guidelines for avoiding these pitfalls include the following:
 
✓ Don’t become defensive. You may become the symbol of everything 
that’s wrong in mental health care in your client’s mind. Or, you may 
become the equivalent to the client’s mother, father, ex-partner, teacher, 
or some other person who caused substantial angst or disappointment. 
In any event, clients will criticize you, sometimes very aggressively, from 
time to time. You must realize that the criticism isn’t about you in most 
cases, and when it is, you need to be open to hearing it. You may be able 
to learn something from your client’s rampage. Defensive counterattack-
ing on your part quickly leads to a therapeutic rupture that you may not 
be able to repair.
 
✓ Look for something to validate. Almost any criticism has a sliver of 
truth in it. Focus on finding the part of the criticism you can agree with. 
Look for reasons why your client is behaving in self-defeating ways, 
whether with you or with others. Usually a reason does exist, and that 
reason isn’t entirely unreasonable!
 
✓ Reflect empathy. Even when you feel annoyed or aggravated, you can 
probably find something about your client or her words that you can 
feel empathy for. Express that empathy and understanding to your 
client.
 
✓ Ask your client for more information. Even when you feel attacked, ask 
for clarification. Most people calm down when you seem genuinely inter-
ested in fully understanding their concerns.
 
✓ Listen to your gut. If you feel uncomfortable, squeamish, pulled, or bul-
lied, you need to slow down, back off a little, and reflect. Your feelings 
are trying to tell you something — try to figure out what that something 
is. Don’t get caught up in a rapid fire exchange that feels out of control.
 
✓ Put an issue on the shelf for awhile. Sometimes an issue may be so hot 
that your client isn’t ready to hear anything you have to say. In those 
cases, saying something like the following is perfectly acceptable: “I 
understand the way you’re feeling right now; would you be willing to 
take another look at this issue in a future session? I have a feeling we’re 
a little stuck at the moment.”

 Chapter 25: Advice for Therapists of People with BPD
 
Therapists are human beings, and as such, they’re imperfect. If you feel con-
fused or upset, step back and ask the client for more clarification. Your guid-
ance and responses don’t have to be instantaneous.
The following story about Jim, an experienced social worker, illustrates some 
of the boundary struggles a therapist can face with his client. Jim finds him-
self getting into battles with his patient, Linda. He also finds himself express-
ing feelings of friendship without even understanding why. He seeks help 
from his clinical director, who asks for an audio tape of the therapy session.
 
Sometimes, as a therapist, you may want to bring in a supervisor to help you 
better understand a particular client and what you can do to help that client. 
You can enhance this supervision by using video- or audio-taped sessions. 
Most patients or clients agree to the taping if the only use is for clinical super-
vision. As the session progresses, the client soon forgets that the camera or 
tape recorder is even there.
Here’s the dialogue from Jim’s recent session with Linda.
Jim (the therapist): Hello, Linda, I’m glad to see you today. I heard that 
you were in the ER this weekend after cutting yourself. I’m glad you 
weren’t admitted.
Linda (the client): You’re lucky I’m alive. No thanks to you or your stupid 
hospital. They made me wait four hours before anyone would see me. 
By the time I got to talk to the doc, I was so tired that I just wanted to go 
home and go to bed.
Jim: Well, we’ve talked about this before, Linda. Sometimes just waiting 
awhile until the overwhelming feelings go down can keep you safe. You 
don’t always need to be admitted.
Linda: You know what, Jim? You’re just a whore for the insurance com-
pany — trying to keep costs down by turning away psych patients.
Jim: That’s not true, Linda. We do what’s right for our patients. My obli-
gation is to keep you safe. Not to save money.
Linda: Don’t be condescending to me. I’ve been around a long time. I 
used to be able to get a bed and a few days rest in your hospital. Now, 
it’s full of homeless criminals. The people who really need help are sent 
home.
Jim: Now Linda, that’s not fair to me. You know I’m trying to help you.
Linda: Not fair. Look, I’ve been coming here for years, and that’s the 
treatment I get from you?
Jim: Okay, Linda, can we stop here? I think we both need to step back 
and figure out what’s going on.

Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Linda: Oh, I see, you’ve finally had enough of me and want to get rid of 
me as a client. Right?
Jim: No, no, not at all. I really like you. Really. But you’re not hearing me 
or realizing that I’m trying really hard to help you.
Linda: You really like me? I’ll bet you wouldn’t even have a cup of coffee 
with me if you ran into me on the sidewalk, would you?
Jim: That’s not true. Of course, I would. I do really care about you.
Linda: Well, that’s reassuring.
Jim’s supervisor listens to this segment of the tape. He asks Jim where he 
thinks things first got off track. In retrospect, Jim realizes that his first mis-
take occurred when Linda told him that she had to wait for four hours and 
was exhausted from the ordeal. Because Jim was feeling defensive, he failed 
to express empathy for her plight. Then, when she called him a “whore from 
the insurance company,” he argued with her. Instead, he may have found a 
way to agree that insurance can be frustrating.
Jim further derailed when he directly argued with his client by telling her that 
what she said was untrue and unfair to him. His mistake gave Linda an open-
ing to ask whether he cared enough about her to have coffee sometime. Jim 
was totally flustered, and not wanting to make things worse, agreed to her 
vague request to consider violating boundaries.
Jim and his supervisor discuss some alternative approaches (which we note 
at the beginning of this section) he can take to work with Linda in future 
sessions. The supervisor points out that these ideas may not always work 
but that they will help Jim maintain appropriate boundaries. Even if Jim and 
Linda can’t repair their therapeutic relationship, the alternative approaches 
Jim wants to use will send Linda a more appropriate message, which can help 
her in future therapy if she chooses to seek it. If they can repair their therapy 
relationship, all the better. Here’s a partial transcript of the next session.
Jim: Hello, Linda, how are you doing this week?
Linda: Much better Jim, how are you?
Jim: Good. If there’s nothing pressing going on in your life that we need 
to deal with immediately, I’d like to propose that we talk a little about our 
session last week. Would that be okay with you?
Linda: I’m sorry I got on your case about the ER and called you a whore; I 
know you care about me.
Jim: Well, Linda, I want to say that I got a little defensive and shouldn’t 
have. You have every right to express your opinions, whether they’re 
negative or positive.

321
 Chapter 25: Advice for Therapists of People with BPD
Linda: I like it when a man can admit mistakes, Jim.
Jim: Let me explain. I took a wrong turn that may have hurt our therapeu-
tic relationship. I was feeling uncomfortable about arguing with you, so I 
went a bit the other way.
Linda: Oh, no, Jim. I can really trust you now. I know that you care about 
me in a special way. I’m more than just an ordinary client to you.
Jim: Linda, I care about you in the same way I care about all my clients. I 
want to be able to help you help yourself. I’m sorry I misspoke.
Linda: What do you mean, misspoke?
Jim: Well, when I agreed with you that I could consider having coffee if I 
ran into you somewhere, I wasn’t thinking. In fact, doing something like 
that would cross a barrier that I just don’t think is a good idea.
Linda: What? I wasn’t asking you to have an affair with me; it’s just coffee, 
for gosh sakes!
Jim: I understand that coffee sounds very innocent and trivial. I just make 
it a rule not to socialize in any way outside of therapy with any of my cli-
ents. I care about them, but therapy takes place in the office.
Linda: Gosh, you’re incredibly uptight.
Jim: I know it sounds a little rigid. Maybe it is, but I’ve found it works 
better for me that way.
Linda: So you don’t really think I’m special, is that it?
Jim: Everyone’s special, Linda. And so are you.
Linda: That sounds like a lot of BS to me, Jim.
Jim: I understand that. But do you feel you can accept what I’m saying 
and continue working with me?
Linda: I think so. But I’ll think about it and let you know.
At Jim’s next supervision session, his supervisor compliments him on his 
work. He relates that Jim kept his cool, looked for ways to agree with what 
Linda said without endorsing everything, and held his boundaries firmly. He 
tells Jim that he thinks the relationship may be close to back on track, but 
only time will tell.
 
When you communicate your boundaries clearly and honestly, most clients 
can hear the message. If clients can’t accept what you’re telling them, letting 
go of your boundaries will only make things worse. 

322
Part V: Advice for People Who Care 
Taking Care of Yourself
An important component of taking care of other people involves taking care 
of yourself. Too many therapists let their lives get out of balance. They worry 
excessively about their clients, work reprehensible hours, and disparage 
themselves when their clients don’t improve like they think they should.
For people who spend much of their lives focused on meeting the needs of 
other people (in other words, you!), looking after themselves and meeting 
their own needs aren’t always as easy as they may think. Here are a few sug-
gestions we offer you, a therapist, for taking care of yourself:
 
✓ Seek social support. Spend time with friends and family.
 
✓ Take part in hobbies and outside activities. Try out some new activi-
ties, such as hiking, travel, or crafts.
 
✓ Exercise. You tell your clients to exercise, don’t you? Well, what about 
you? Try a range of ideas until you find a few activities you enjoy enough 
to stick with them. Don’t restrict yourself to a single form of exercise, 
such as jogging. Your body does better when you cross train.
 
✓ Learn new things. Take adult education classes at a local college or uni-
versity.
 
✓ Read new books. Of course you read professional books and articles. 
But consider reading outside of your field. In addition, read for enter-
tainment.
 
✓ Prioritize your health. Staying healthy takes some energy, time, and 
commitment. Practice self-control.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens chapters appear in all For Dummies 
books. They provide helpful tips on dealing with some 
of the difficult issues we discuss throughout this book. We 
wrote these chapters specifically for the sufferers of bor-
derline personality disorder (BPD). We show you ten 
quick ways to calm down when your emotions start run-
ning high. We give you some hints on how to say you’re 
sorry. And, finally, we review ten techniques that either 
don’t work at all or are insufficient for addressing BPD 
issues.

Chapter 26
Ten Quick Ways to Settle Down
In This Chapter
▶ Using your senses to calm yourself down
▶ Interrupting your emotions with a variety of activities
▶ Changing scenes to improve your mood
P
eople with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently become 
intensely emotional. They may react to small stressors, such as waiting 
in line at a grocery store, getting stuck in a traffic jam, or hearing negative 
feedback, with great big emotions. Psychotherapies for BPD help patients by 
teaching them skills for regulating negative emotions. Here are some quick 
tips for bringing intense emotional highs back down to earth. Pick a couple 
and try them out.
 
Most people need a lot of practice before some of these strategies become 
effective. Practice them when you’re not upset.
Breathing Away Distress
Deep breathing helps calm people down. When in distress, people breathe 
rapidly but shallowly. In Chapter 16, we discuss breathing meditation, one 
good method you can use to calm down. However, getting results from medi-
tation usually takes considerable practice over time.
Here’s an easier, faster breathing method that can help you dissipate dis-
tress. You can practice this method anywhere, anytime.
 
1. Empty your lungs by breathing out.
 
2. Take a deep breath; feel the air flowing in through your nose, then 
moving into your chest, and finally expanding your abdomen.
 
3. Hold your breath for a couple of seconds.
 
4. Breathe out very slowly through your mouth — try to push all the 
air out.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 ten times.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Chilling Your Hot Emotions
Do you sometimes feel like you need to “chill out,” as younger folks say? 
Cooling down the body can douse your fiery hot feelings, too. Here’s a strat-
egy you can try:
 
1. Get a piece of ice from your freezer.
 
2. Hold it with one hand, and press it against your wrist.
 
3. When your hand or wrist starts to hurt, change hands, and hold it 
against your other wrist.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until the ice cube is melted.
 
5. If you are still upset, you can repeat the process with another cube, 
but usually one will work.
Picking Up Your Pace
This method of settling down involves a little exercise. If you have health 
concerns or haven’t exercised for awhile, check with your doctor to make 
sure this strategy is okay to try.
 
1. Buy a jump rope, or make your own.
 
2. Get a kitchen timer, and set the time for 45 seconds.
 
3. Now jump rope for 45 seconds.
 
 If you’re in really good shape, jump for 2 minutes.
 
4. Count your jumps to keep your mind off other things.
After you finish, you won’t be thinking about whatever is (or should we say, 
“was”?) bothering you. You’ll be catching your breath!
Massaging Away the Blues
Massage therapy has been a recognized medical treatment for many centu-
ries. It has grown in popularity over the past few decades as a way to relax. 
Once a pleasure for the rich, massage therapy offers physical and mental 
benefits to many different people today.

327
 Chapter 26: Ten Quick Ways to Settle Down
Usually a professional therapist performs massages. However, if you don’t 
have the time or money to pay a professional, you can give yourself a mini-
massage instead. Take some lotion or oil and rub it into your feet and ankles. 
Be sure to knead each toe and each heel. Do the same on your shoulders, 
elbows, and hands. Ahhhh, feel the relaxation.
Surfing for Distraction
If your job primarily consists of sitting in front of a computer all day, this 
strategy may not be a great idea. But for many people, 30 minutes of surfing 
the Web can be very entertaining. Look up a topic you’re interested in, such 
as vacation destinations, financial planning, homes for sale in your neighbor-
hood, or exotic pets, and find the fascinating array of information right at 
your fingertips. Focusing your mind on something carefree or interesting can 
help you calm down.
Reading a Great Book
Reading can take your mind away from your troubles and put you into 
another world. If you enjoy reading, always have a few books available. For 
most people, reading takes more concentration than watching television, 
which, in general, makes books more effective than TV shows at distracting 
your mind. Furthermore, you won’t find any commercials in books. Our per-
sonal preference is to have a nonfiction book for the early evening and then a 
good mystery for the late hours.
Mellowing Out in a Movie
Movies can also sweep you away to another place. You can buy a movie, rent 
a movie, watch one on a cable channel, or even download one straight from 
the Internet. Whichever method you choose for getting your movie, be sure 
to make some popcorn to go along with it — low fat, skip the butter. Mmm, 
crunch, crunch, crunch.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Playing to Improve Your Mood
If you have kids or grandkids, take some time to play. Go to a park, or play a 
board game. Your kids will love spending time with you, and your mood can 
benefit from playing, too. After all, being in a bad mood while playing hop-
scotch or capture the flag is pretty hard to do! Call your young nieces, neph-
ews, or cousins, and offer to watch them for a couple of hours so that their 
parents can have a break. If you don’t have kids around, play with a dog or 
other animal. Dogs love to play. If you don’t have a dog or other pet, you can 
volunteer to be a dog walker at the local animal shelter. Or, consider being 
a temporary foster parent for a dog that’s waiting placement. Dogs can bark 
you down from a bad mood anytime.
Phoning a Friend
If you’ve ever seen Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, you know all about the 
lifeline that allows participants to call a friend when they need help. When 
you’re upset, friends can be a real lifeline for you, too. However, be careful 
that you don’t let your bad mood cause you to attack your friend for not lis-
tening well enough or for not agreeing with you 100 percent. Tell your friend 
that you just want to vent a little. If you do start feeling angry with your 
friend, cut the conversation short — you certainly don’t want to add to your 
woes.
 
Be careful not to overdo this strategy because you don’t want to burn your 
friends out. Friendships sustain themselves only when they’re two-way 
streets.
Getting Outside
A couple of years ago, we wrote a book called Seasonal Affective Disorder For 
Dummies (Wiley). Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression 
associated with the short days of winter. One of the best ways to decrease 
the low moods of SAD is to go outside.
Even if you don’t have SAD, going outside can help improve your mood. 
Take a walk in a nice park or on a street that has interesting houses. Go to a 
dog park and watch the dogs run around. Attend an outdoor sporting event. 
Whatever you do, just get outside.

Chapter 27
Ten Ways to Say You’re Sorry
In This Chapter
▶ Expressing your feelings to someone you care about
▶ Giving a thoughtful gift to show you care
▶ Honoring someone else by contributing to a charity
W
e have great compassion for people with borderline personality dis-
order (BPD). We know painful emotions permeate their lives. Guilt 
and regret are two especially powerful emotions that often plague people 
with BPD.
We also know that folks who love people with BPD often feel terribly hurt 
and confused. Some have endless optimism that their loved ones with BPD 
will improve. Others give up and move on. Either way, people with BPD feel 
better when they take personal responsibility for the role they’ve played in 
hurting the people who care about them. Part of getting better involves being 
able to tell the people you have hurt, “I’m sorry.” This chapter offers ten 
ways to tell your loved ones that you’re sorry.
Saying the Words Out Loud
A simple but, at times, excruciatingly difficult way to communicate remorse 
is by speaking the words out loud. For some people, apologizing seems 
almost impossible. If you feel overwhelmed by this challenge, talk to your 
therapist about it. Try role-playing in one of your sessions. Then ask yourself 
the following questions:
 
✓ What does saying I’m sorry mean about me as a person?
 
✓ How can saying I’m sorry help me and the other person?
 
Saying you’re sorry actually suggests that you’re a brave person — someone 
who can own up to mistakes. Saying you’re sorry can help the one you hurt as 
well as yourself. Although apologizing won’t negate past wrongs, it’s a move in 
the right direction — especially if you commit yourself to continuous growth.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Asking for Forgiveness
Saying you’re sorry is only half of the picture. The other part is asking for for-
giveness. Sounds pretty easy, right? “Please forgive me.”
People who’ve been hurt by people with BPD have likely been told, “I’m 
sorry,” or “Please forgive me,” more than once. Asking for forgiveness must 
come with a spoken or unspoken pledge to work at making life better for both 
you and the person you hurt. In other words, when people with BPD ask for 
someone’s forgiveness, they must be starting or getting treatment and learn-
ing the skills that will improve their relationships. After all, asking forgive-
ness is a promise to work on reducing the hurt.
Running an Errand
You’ve heard the expression, “Actions speak louder than words.” Well, being 
professional writers, we’re not sure that we agree 100 percent, but, in the 
quest for making amends, you need to think hard about this concept.
For example, consider running an errand for someone you care about and 
think you may have hurt with your BPD. This errand can involve picking up 
the groceries, filling up the gas tank, going to the post office, picking up the 
kids from school, or taking the tax forms to the accountant. The task doesn’t 
have to be difficult, but it should be something that your partner, family 
member, or friend usually does for herself.
Sending Flowers
Almost everyone likes flowers. And getting flowers from someone you care 
about feels good. You don’t have to spend a fortune. A small bunch from the 
grocery store can brighten up moods and get your point across. If you can’t 
afford the cost of a bouquet, buy a single flower.
Sending a Card
A card can also be a thoughtful way to express your feelings, whether you 
want to ask for forgiveness, say you’re sorry, or tell someone how special 
he or she is. Make sure you spend some time looking at and reading the 
card before you buy it. You probably don’t want to send your partner a card 
designed for someone’s third birthday, even if it does look pretty cute.

331
 Chapter 27: Ten Ways to Say You’re Sorry
Doing a Chore
Again, the chore doesn’t have to be a big deal. Just make sure that it involves 
something that your friend, partner, or family member usually has to do. For 
example, you can clean the garage, make a special dinner, pay the bills, wash 
the car, pick up around the house, or file financial papers. Whatever you 
choose to do for someone you care about, do it without complaining or brag-
ging about what you did.
Writing Your Thoughts
Writing out your thoughts can be one of the most meaningful ways to show 
and explain your feelings. Your loved one will appreciate the time you spent 
thinking about him or her. Here are a few pointers:
 
✓ Never send anything that you wrote in the middle of the night without 
proofing it in the morning.
 
✓ Don’t send a letter that’s basically self-defense and justification.
 
✓ Don’t write your letter after you’ve been drinking.
 
✓ Remember that when you write something, whomever you give it to can 
save it forever.
Finding a Poem
Sometimes you can’t express yourself in a way that fully describes your feel-
ings or passions. Poetry sings a message. If you haven’t read poetry since 
high school (okay, that goes for about 90 percent of the population), go to 
your local library or bookstore and browse for a couple of hours with a cup 
of coffee. Whether or not you understand everything you read, a few of the 
poems will surely inspire you.
Borrow the book from the library or buy it from the store. Copy the poem in 
your best handwriting or type it on the computer. Add a few comments about 
what meaning the poem holds for you and what you think about the person 
you’re giving it to. Send the poem and your comments to the person you may 
have hurt.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Sending a Small Gift
Small gifts are another way to express your feelings. In many ways, small 
is truly better than large. Large gifts generally come with implicit strings 
attached, whether you intend them or not. Small gifts, especially gifts that 
may have special meaning to the person you wronged, have much more 
power and, yet, no strings.
 
If you want to express your regret or sorrow with your therapist, we gener-
ally recommend avoiding gifts whether small or large. Many therapists work 
under ethical codes that discourage accepting gifts, and they aren’t necessary 
anyway. Simply express your feelings verbally or in writing.
Making Amends: Giving or Volunteering
Sometimes your past actions from long ago continue to plague your mind 
with guilt and regret. Often, the person you hurt has moved on, died, or 
simply isn’t available for you to make amends directly. In these cases, con-
sider designing a plan for making amends.
Such plans can entail making a contribution to others. The contribution may 
be giving money, spending time, or providing a skilled service to someone 
or a group of people who need help. A few of our favorite charitable activi-
ties include becoming a dog walker at the Humane Society, working at a local 
food bank, tutoring people who want to learn English, and participating in a 
community trash pickup. You can also donate money to a group that’s impor-
tant to either you or the person you’re making amends with. Call your local 
Red Cross or United Way office for more possibilities. You can’t undo the 
past, but you can feel better about who you are becoming today by contribut-
ing to others.
 
Saying you’re sorry, asking forgiveness, and making amends are only useful 
when you accompany them with a commitment to make things better — not a 
promise of perfection, but a sincere effort.

Chapter 28
Ten Things You Shouldn’t Do
In This Chapter
▶ Expecting too much too fast
▶ Failing to look at all your options
▶ Choosing the wrong ways to cope
T
he first 300 pages or so of this book tell you what to do when you or 
someone you know has borderline personality disorder (BPD). Now that 
we’ve almost reached the end of the book, we’ve saved a little space for some 
tips on what not to do for your BPD. Some of these items are quite harmless 
and may provide a little relief from pain, depression, or discomfort. However, 
you won’t find any research that proves that any of the following techniques 
are comprehensive enough to tackle BPD.
 
BPD is a serious emotional disorder. It’s important to get appropriate help. 
See Chapter 11 for the types of treatments and professionals for dealing with 
BPD and Part IV for an exploration of treatment ideas.
Expect Quick Fixes
We’re sorry if you expected to read this book and be cured of your BPD. 
Effective treatment of BPD takes time. In most cases, treatment takes at least 
a year and often even longer. BPD is a complex disorder that requires consis-
tent hard work. Don’t be fooled by someone who promises a quick fix. You 
won’t find any ten-day miracle cures for BPD — at least none that actually 
work.
On the other hand, people with BPD who are ready to look at all their symp-
toms in an honest way and work hard to get better can enjoy significant 
improvements fairly rapidly. Not surprisingly, however, breaking old habits 
and permanently learning new, better ways of living usually takes consider-
able time.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Stay Stuck
When people with BPD tell us that they’ve tried everything to get better and 
nothing has worked, we know they’re stuck. Because so many treatment 
options have emerged over the years, few, if any, people have really tried 
them all. Thus, we tell our clients that doing nothing is, in fact, making the 
decision to stay the same.
We’ve never met anyone with BPD who loves having the disorder. If you have 
BPD, you can find programs that can help you. If you live in a location where 
no therapists are trained in treating BPD, consider asking a local therapist to 
request supervision from someone who has knowledge and experience with 
the disorder so that you can get the help you need. The bottom line: You can 
find treatment for your BPD, and you can feel better.
Choose Chiropractic Medicine
Most chiropractic doctors believe that the spine and overall health are related. 
People who go to chiropractors report relief from headaches, back pain, neck 
pain, and other muscular or skeletal pains. Often covered by insurance, this 
type of healthcare has gained popularity over time. However, some chiropractic 
practitioners promise much more than relief from physical pains — some of 
them promise improvements in mental health. Chiropractic medicine has its 
place in the care of many health issues; however, no research justifies it as a 
treatment for BPD. So feel free to seek this kind of treatment for your body’s 
physical aches and pains, but don’t expect it to cure your BPD.
Stick Pins and Needles
Imbalanced internal energy is the premise behind acupuncture, an ancient 
Chinese medicine that many trained acupuncturists still practice today. 
Acupuncture treatment consists of inserting very fine needles into different 
places in the body to rebalance energy flow. Many people claim that acu-
puncture helps decrease chronic mental and physical pain. Some research 
supports the use of acupuncture for substance abuse, as well.
We advise you not to make acupuncture a primary treatment for BPD 
because evidence to support acupuncture’s effectiveness in treating BPD 
just doesn’t exist. However, if you find that it helps reduce pain or stress, 
or improves your mood, by all means, consider it in addition to your other 
treatments.

335
 Chapter 28: Ten Things You Shouldn’t Do
Find a Life Coach
We like coaches. Coaches can help you stay focused on your goals and cheer-
lead your efforts. However, BPD is a serious mental disorder. Treatment 
requires highly skilled professionals trained in specific therapies for treating 
BPD.
We encourage you to postpone hiring a life coach until you’ve benefited from 
professional mental health treatment. If you decide you want to have a coach 
at that time, be sure to talk with your therapist first.
Fill Up Emptiness with Food or Drink
One of the symptoms of BPD is a strong feeling of inner emptiness. If you 
suffer from this symptom, you feel like something important is missing. (See 
Chapter 7 for more information on this particular symptom of BPD, and look 
to Chapter 17 for ways you can treat it.) Often, people experiencing this emp-
tiness hope that food or drink will fill the void. Unfortunately, that approach 
doesn’t work. Furthermore, after eating or drinking too much, people with 
BPD add guilt and remorse to their plate of negative feelings.
This common feeling of emptiness isn’t a hunger of the body; it’s a hunger of 
the mind. Working on getting better, improving relationships, and leading a 
meaningful life will satisfy the hunger — not food or drink.
Try Too Hard
Most people come to therapy with great anticipations and expectations. Just 
walking through the door for the first time to get help can set off feelings of 
optimism and hope. Those positive feelings can be quite strong. We wish we 
had a magic wand that could instantly fix the people who walk into our office, 
but breaking old habits and learning new ones takes time — not magic.
To get the most out of your therapy, you need to find the balance of learning 
to accept where you are in the present and where you want to be as you move 
forward. Trying to go too fast, too hard only bogs down your progression.
 
Pace yourself. Give yourself the space to work through your issues. Remember 
that the turtle wins the race through persistence and hard work — be the 
turtle.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Gaze at Crystals
Some people believe they can tell the future, solve crimes, and heal people 
by staring at a crystal ball. Some crystal gazers advertise that they can defeat 
depression and relieve daily stress. After surfing the Web for about an hour, 
we found out much more than we ever wanted to know about the powers of 
crystal balls. Apparently, different crystals have different powers. One Web 
site suggested putting a particular crystal in a glass of water overnight and 
then drinking the water the next day as a tonic.
Well, if you want to look at shiny rocks, go ahead. But please don’t hope to 
cure BPD with crystals. You just won’t find any evidence that proves crystal 
gazing can cure the disorder.
Get the Wrong Therapy
Throughout this book, we promote getting psychotherapy for BPD. By far, 
the treatments we review are your best bets for getting better. However, 
some psychotherapy approaches don’t appear to be effective or haven’t 
yet been well researched for treating BPD. We recommend that you choose 
a therapist who conducts evidence-based treatments specifically targeting 
BPD.
Now, we’re not saying that some of these other treatments don’t have bene-
fits, but we are saying that we don’t have enough information to say that they 
do. Would you buy a new type of furnace to heat your home if it has never 
been tested in the lab? Or a car that has never been tested on the road? The 
same idea holds true for therapy.
 
Ask potential therapists how they treat BPD and what therapy they use. If they 
can’t answer these questions, find someone else. They should at least mention 
one or more of the approaches to treatment that we discuss in Chapter 11.
Hope That Medications Will Cure BPD
Researchers are constantly developing new medications. In the future, scien-
tists may find a medication that helps or possibly even cures BPD. But at this 
time, no such medication exists. People with BPD sometimes benefit from 
medication for specific symptoms, but you should use medication only in 
conjunction with psychotherapy.

Appendix B
Forms to Help You Battle BPD
T
his appendix contains a few forms that you can use in conjunction with 
some of the exercises that appear throughout this book. We give you 
instructions for using each form and tell you which chapter each form relates 
to. Feel free to make copies of the forms for your own use.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
You can do a cost-benefit analysis to help you make all sorts of decisions in 
life. In fact, we’ve often used this strategy in our clinical practices as well as 
for tricky decisions in our own lives. You can see the cost-benefit analysis in 
action in several chapters throughout this book. In Chapter 12, we use the cost-
benefit analysis to help a client decide whether to seek treatment for BPD. In 
Chapter 19, we apply the same strategy to help a woman who suffers from BPD 
challenge her problematic schemas. And, in Chapter 22, we suggest that you 
use this approach to help you decide whether to end a relationship with some-
one who has BPD. Follow these steps to complete a Cost-Benefit Analysis Form:
 
1. On a page in your notebook or computer document, or on the Cost-
Benefit Analysis Form that appears in this appendix, write down the 
decision you want to make, the problematic schema you may want to 
change, or any other dilemma you’re facing.
 
2. Underneath the dilemma you wrote down in Step 1, make two col-
umns. Label the first one “Benefits” and the second one “Costs.”
 
3. In the Benefits column, write down all the conceivable benefits that 
taking one side of the issue can possibly bring you.
 
 Be creative and think of any possible way that taking this side of the 
issue can or even may help you. Benefits can come in various forms, 
including emotional, interpersonal, financial, and physical.
 
4. In the Costs column, write down all the ways that taking this same 
side of the decision can, will, or may cost you. Costs can include emo-
tional, financial, physical, and interpersonal stressors or damages.
 
5. Write down a few thoughts or reflections about the costs and benefits 
you’ve come up with — if you want to. If you’re already working with 
a therapist, discuss your results with him or her.

Impulsive Awareness
Chapter 15 describes the benefits of monitoring your impulsive actions. Use 
the Impulsive Awareness Form to increase your awareness of your impul-
sive tendencies. Follow these steps to monitor your impulsive actions (see 
Chapter 15 for more complete instructions). Use a separate form for each of 
your impulsive tendencies, and record the tendency you’re studying at the 
top of the form on the line next to “Impulsive Awareness Form.”
 
1. Describe each time you act impulsively, without thinking.
 
2. Recount where you were and what you were doing before you acted 
impulsively.

345
 Appendix B: Forms to Help You Battle BPD
 
3. Explain how you felt — before you acted impulsively.
 
4. Write down what you thought or hoped would happen as a result of 
your impulsive behavior.
 
5. Express how you felt after the impulsive behavior. Did you achieve 
your goals?
 
6. Jot down your conclusions from this exercise underneath My 
Reflections.

Part VII: Appendixes 
Schema Monitoring
In Chapter 19, we discuss the concept of schemas and the problems that 
schemas can cause for you and the people around you. You can use the 
Schema Monitoring Form to start changing your problematic schemas. Follow 
these steps to start monitoring your schemas (see Chapter 19 for more com-
plete instructions on using this form):
 
1. When you feel distressed, try to figure out what event seemed to trig-
ger your feeling.
 
 Jot down at the top of the form what that event was. The event can be 
something that actually happened to you or an image that came into 
your mind.
 
2. Jot down in the middle column what thoughts, perceptions, interpre-
tations, or meanings the event had for you.
 
 In other words, make note of what thoughts were going through your 
head when the event actually occurred.
 
3. In the right-hand column, make note of how you feel about the event.
 
 If you have trouble labeling your feelings, consider reading Chapter 6, 
which explains bodily sensations and words that describe feelings.
 
4. Refer to Chapter 19 for a list of problematic schemas and their defini-
tions to discover whether one of your own problematic schemas is 
related to your thoughts and feelings about this event.
 
 If a problematic schema is related to your feelings, make note of that 
schema and the related feelings in the first column of the Schema 
Monitoring Form. You may conclude that more than one schema seems 
to apply, which is okay. Jot down however many schemas seem to 
be involved. Briefly describe your schema based on the definition in 
Chapter 19, or individualize how that schema seems to apply to you.

Then and Now
In addition to the schema monitoring exercise, you can find another impor-
tant method for challenging your problematic schemas in Chapter 19 — this 
one deals with identifying the difference between the past and the present. 
People generally develop their problematic schemas in childhood. Later in 
their lives, events that are only tangentially similar to the events of their 
childhoods continue to set these schemas off. The Then and Now Form helps 
you see the difference between the past and the present so that you can 
address the problematic schemas that you developed in childhood. Follow 
these steps to complete this form (see Chapter 19 for more complete 
directions):
 
1. Write down your problematic schema in the left-hand column. (See 
Chapter 19 for a list of problematic schemas.) Describe how this par-
ticular schema plays out in your life.
 
2. Jot down one or more recollections from your childhood that may 
have helped create this schema in the second column.
 
3. Write down the events or happenings that tend to trigger this schema 
for you in your current life in the third column.
 
4. Remind yourself that you’re older today, that the current trigger-
ing events aren’t usually as significant as the events that created 
your schemas, and that, with time, your mind will see the difference 
between the events of your childhood and those of the present. Write 
down your thoughts and reflections underneath My Reflections.
