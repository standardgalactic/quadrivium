About the Author
Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written or co-written more 
than 50 popular computer books, including iPhone For Dummies, GarageBand 
For Dummies, and Dr. Mac: The OS X Files for Wiley Publishing, Inc.; Stupid 
Mac Tricks and Dr. Macintosh for Addison-Wesley; and The Little iTunes Book 
and The Little iDVD Book for Peachpit Press. His books have sold more than a 
million copies worldwide. 
Bob has penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the Houston Chronicle for the 
past ten years and has been published in dozens of computer magazines over 
the past 15 years. His achievements have been documented in major media 
around the world. (Yes, that was him juggling a keyboard in USA Today a few 
years back!) 
Bob is known for his expertise, trademark humorous style, and ability to 
translate techie jargon into usable and fun advice for regular folks. Bob is 
also a prolifi c public speaker, presenting more than 100 Macworld Expo 
training sessions in the U.S. and abroad, keynote addresses in three coun-
tries, and Macintosh training seminars in many U.S. cities. (He also won the 
Macworld Expo MacJeopardy World Championship three times before retir-
ing his crown.) 
Bob is considered one of the world’s leading authorities on Mac OS X. From 
1989 to 1997, he was a contributing editor/columnist for MacUser magazine, 
writing the Help Folder, Beating the System, Personal Best, and Game Room 
columns at various times. 
In his copious spare time, Bob heads up a team of expert technical consul-
tants who do nothing but provide technical help and training to Mac users 
via telephone, e-mail, and/or a unique Internet-enabled remote control soft-
ware, which allows the team to see and control your Mac no matter where in 
the world you may be.
If you’re having problems with your Mac, you ought to give them a try. You’ll 
fi nd them at www.boblevitus.com or 408-627-7577.
Prior to giving his life over to computers, LeVitus spent years at Kresser/
Craig/D.I.K. (a Los Angeles advertising agency and marketing consultancy) 
and its subsidiary, L & J Research. He holds a B.S. in Marketing from 
California State University.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife, Lisa, who taught me almost everything I 
know about almost everything I know except computers. It’s also dedicated 
to my children, Allison and Jacob, who love their Macs almost as much as I 
love them (my kids, not their Macs).

Introduction
Y
ou made the right choice twice: Mac OS X Snow Leopard and this book.
Take a deep breath and get ready to have a rollicking good time. That’s right. 
This is a computer book, but it’s going to be fun. What a concept! Whether 
you’re brand spanking new to the Mac or a grizzled old Mac vet, I guaran-
tee that reading this book to discover the ins and outs of Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard will make everything easier. Wiley, Inc. (the publisher of this book) 
couldn’t say as much on the cover if it weren’t true!
About This Book
This book’s roots lie with my international bestseller Macintosh System 7.5 
For Dummies, an award-winning book so good that now-deceased Mac cloner 
Power Computing gave away a copy with every Mac clone it sold. Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard For Dummies is the latest revision and has been, once again, 
completely updated to include all the Mac OS X goodness found in Snow 
Leopard. In other words, this edition combines all the old, familiar features of 
previous editions — but is once again updated to reflect the latest and great-
est offering from Apple as well as feedback from readers.
Why write a For Dummies book about Snow Leopard? Well, Snow Leopard is a 
big, somewhat complicated, personal-computer operating system. So I made 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies a not-so-big, not-very-complicated book 
that shows you what Snow Leopard is all about without boring you to tears, 
confusing you, or poking you with sharp objects.
In fact, I think you’ll be so darned comfortable that I wanted the title to be 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard Without Discomfort, but the publishers wouldn’t let 
me. Apparently, we For Dummies authors have to follow some rules, and using 
Dummies and Mac OS X Snow Leopard in this book’s title are among them.
And speaking of “dummies,” remember that it’s just a word. I don’t think you’re 
dumb — quite the opposite! My second choice for this book’s title was Mac 
OS X Snow Leopard For People Smart Enough to Know They Need Help with It, 
but you can just imagine what Wiley thought of that. (“C’mon, that’s the whole 
point of the name!” they insisted. “Besides, it’s shorter our way.”)

2
Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies 
Anyway, the book is chock-full of information and advice, explaining every-
thing you need to know about Mac OS X in language you can understand — 
along with timesaving tips, tricks, techniques, and step-by-step instructions, 
all served up in generous quantities.
What You Won’t Find in This Book
Another rule we For Dummies authors must follow is that our books cannot 
exceed a certain number of pages. (Brevity is the soul of wit, and all that.) 
So I wish I could have included some things, but they didn’t fit. Although I 
feel confident you’ll find everything you need to know about Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard in this book, some things bear further looking into, including these:
 
✓ Information about some of the applications (programs) that come with 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard: An installation of Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
includes more than 50 separate applications, mostly found in the 
Applications folder and the Utilities folder within it. I’d love to walk you 
through each one of them, but that would have required a book a whole 
lot bigger, heavier, and more expensive than this one.
 
 This book is, first and foremost, about using Mac OS X, so I brief you on 
the small handful of bundled applications essential to using Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard and keep the focus there — namely, iCal, Address Book, 
Mail, Safari, TextEdit, and the like, as well as important utilities you may 
need to know how to use someday.
 
 For what it’s worth, many books cover the applications that come with 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard as well as applications commonly bundled with 
Snow Leopard on a new Mac, such as iLife; the one my publisher sug-
gested I recommend is Mac OS X Snow Leopard All-in-One For Dummies, 
written by Mark L. Chambers, which is (by sheer coincidence, of course) 
also published by Wiley.
 
✓ Information about Microsoft Office, iLife, iWork, Adobe Photoshop, 
Quicken, and most other third-party applications: Okay, if all the gory 
details of all the bundled (read: free) Mac OS X Snow Leopard applica-
tions don’t fit here, I think you’ll understand why digging into third-party 
applications that cost extra was out of the question.
 
✓ Information about programming for the Mac: This book is about using 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard, not writing code for it. Dozens of books cover 
programming on the Mac, most of which are two or three times the size 
of this book.
 
 For what it’s worth, Dennis Cohen, my technical editor, and his brother 
Michael wrote a great book about Xcode 3, the development environment 
included with Mac OS X Snow Leopard. It’s called The Xcode 3 Book and, 
by sheer coincidence, is also published by (who else?) Wiley.

 Introduction
Conventions Used in This Book
To get the most out of this book, you need to know how I do things and why. 
Here are a few conventions I use in this book to make your life easier:
 
✓ When I want you to open an item in a menu, I write something like 
“Choose File➪Open,” which means, “Pull down the File menu and 
choose the Open command.”
 
✓ Stuff you’re supposed to type appears in bold type, like this.
 
✓ Sometimes an entire a sentence is in boldface, as you see when I pres-
ent a numbered list of steps. In those cases, I leave the bold off what 
you’re supposed to type, like this.
 
✓ Web addresses, programming code (not much in this book), and things 
that appear on-screen are shown in a special monofont typeface, like 
this.
 
✓ For keyboard shortcuts, I write something like Ô+A, which means to hold 
down the Ô key (the one with the little pretzel and/or Ú symbol on it) and 
then press the A key on the keyboard. If you see something like Ô+Shift+A, 
that means to hold down the Ô and Shift keys while pressing the A key. 
Again, for absolute clarity, I never refer to the Ô key with the Ú symbol. I 
reserve that symbol for the Ú menu (Apple menu). For the Command key, 
I use only the Ô symbol. Got it? Very cool.
Foolish Assumptions
Although I know what happens when you make assumptions, I’ve made a few 
anyway. First, I assume that you, gentle reader, know nothing about using 
Mac OS X — beyond knowing what a Mac is, that you want to use OS X, that 
you want to understand OS X without having to digest an incomprehensible 
technical manual, and that you made the right choice by selecting this 
particular book.
And so I do my best to explain each new concept in full and loving detail. 
Maybe that’s foolish, but . . . oh well.
Oh, and I also assume that you can read. If you can’t, ignore this paragraph.

Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies is divided into six logical parts, num-
bered (surprisingly enough) 1 through 6. By no fault of mine, they’re numbered 
using those stuffy old Roman numerals, so you see I–VI where you (in my 
humble opinion) ought to see Arabic numbers 1–6. It’s another rule that For 
Dummies authors have to follow, I think.
Anyway, it’s better if you read the parts in order, but if you already know a lot — 
or think you know a lot — feel free to skip around and read the parts that 
interest you most.
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics: This first part is 
very, very basic training. From the mouse to the Desktop, from menus, win-
dows, and icons to the snazzy-but-helpful Dock, it’s all here. A lot of what you 
need to know to navigate the depths of Mac OS X safely (and sanely) and per-
form basic tasks can be found in this part. And although old-timers might just 
want to skim through it, newcomers should probably read every word. Twice.
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”): In 
this part, I build on the basics of Part I and really get you revving with your 
Mac. Here, I cover additional topics that every Mac user needs to know, 
coupled with some hands-on, step-by-step instructions. The part starts with 
a closer look at ways you can organize your files and folders, followed by a 
chapter about using removable media (which means ejectable discs — mostly 
CDs and DVDs). Last, but certainly not least, is a chapter about all the Snow 
Leopard applications (such as iCal, Address Book, and Mail) that help you 
keep your digital life organized.
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done: This part is chock-full 
of ways to do productive stuff with your Mac. In this section, you discover 
the Internet first — or at least how to get it working on your Mac and what to 
do with it after you do. Next, you look at the digital-media side of things with 
chapters about music, video, games, and digital photos. Finally, you look at 
Snow Leopard’s built-in tools for writing — namely, TextEdit and fonts.
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own: Here I get into the nitty-
gritty underbelly of making Mac OS X Snow Leopard work the way you want it 
to work. I start with the ins and outs of printing under OS X. Then I move on 
to somewhat more advanced topics, such as file sharing, creating and using 
multiple user accounts (and why you might want to), and the lowdown on 
numerous Mac OS X Snow Leopard features — Text to Speech, speech recog-
nition, automation, and more — that can make your computing experience 
even more pleasant.

 Introduction
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard: This part starts with 
a chapter about backups and security, which not only stresses the impor-
tance of backing up your data, but also shows you how to do it almost pain-
lessly. Then I introduce you to a handful of useful utilities included with Snow 
Leopard, and explain when and how to use them. Finally, I tell you how to 
avoid most disasters, as well as what to do in the unlikely event that a major 
mishap does occur.
Part VI: The Part of Tens: Finally, it’s The Part of Tens, which might have 
started life as a Letterman rip-off, but does include heaping helpings of tips, 
optional software, great Mac Web sites, and hardware ideas.
Appendix: Last, but certainly not least, I cover installing Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard in the appendix. The whole process has become quite easy with this 
version of the system software, but if you have to install Snow Leopard your-
self, it would behoove you to read this helpful appendix first.
Icons Used in This Book
Little round pictures (icons) appear off to the left side of the text throughout 
this book. Consider these icons miniature road signs, telling you a little some-
thing extra about the topic at hand. Here’s what the different icons look like 
and what they all mean.
 
Look for Tip icons to find the juiciest morsels: shortcuts, tips, and undocu-
mented secrets about Snow Leopard. Try them all; impress your friends!
 
When you see this icon, it means that this particular morsel is something that 
I think you should memorize (or at least write on your shirt cuff).
 
Put on your propeller-beanie hat and pocket protector; these parts include the 
truly geeky stuff. It’s certainly not required reading, but it must be interesting 
or informative, or I wouldn’t have wasted your time with it.
 
Read these notes very, very, very carefully. (Did I say very?) Warning icons flag 
important cautionary information. The author and publisher won’t be respon-
sible if your Mac explodes or spews flaming parts because you ignored a 
Warning icon. Just kidding. Macs don’t explode or spew (with the exception of 
a few choice PowerBook 5300s, which won’t run Snow Leopard anyway). But I 
got your attention, didn’t I? I’ll tell you once again: It is a good idea to read the 
Warning icons very carefully.

Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies 
 
These icons represent my ranting or raving about something that either bugs 
me or makes me smile. When I’m ranting, imagine foam coming from my 
mouth. Rants are required to be irreverent, irrelevant, or both. I try to keep 
them short, more for your sake than mine.
 
Well, now, what could this icon possibly be about? Named by famous editorial 
consultant Mr. Obvious, this icon highlights all things new and different in Mac 
OS X Snow Leopard.
Where to Go from Here
Go to a comfortable spot (preferably not far from a Mac) and read the book.
The first few chapters of this book are where I describe the basic everyday 
things that you need to understand to operate your Mac effectively. If you’re 
new to Macs and OS X Snow Leopard, start there.
Even though Mac OS X Snow Leopard is way different from previous Mac 
operating systems, the first part of the book is so basic that if you’ve been 
using a Mac for long, you might think you know it all — and okay, you might 
know most of it. But hey! Not-so-old-timers need a solid foundation. So here’s 
my advice: Skip the stuff you know; you’ll get to the better stuff faster.
 
I didn’t write this book for myself. I wrote it for you — and would love to hear 
how it worked for you. So please send me your thoughts, platitudes, likes and 
dislikes, and any other comments. You can send snail-mail in care of Wiley, but 
it takes a long time to reach me that way, and I just don’t have time to respond 
to 99.9% of it. If you want a response your best bet is to send e-mail to me 
directly at SnowLeopard4Dummies@boblevitus.com. I appreciate your 
feedback, and I try to respond to all reasonably polite e-mail within a few days.
Did this book work for you? What did you like? What didn’t you like? What 
questions were unanswered? Did you want to know more about something? 
Did you want to find out less about something? Tell me! I have received more 
than 100 suggestions about previous editions, most of which are incorpo-
rated here. So keep up the good work!
So what are you waiting for? Go — enjoy the book!

Part I
Introducing Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard: 
The Basics

In this part . . .
B
ecause I believe it’s important to crawl before you 
walk, in this part you get a look at the most basic of 
basics — such as how to turn on your Mac. Next, I 
acquaint you with the Mac OS X Finder, with its Desktop, 
windows, icons, and menus (oh my)! Then you find out 
how to make this cat your own by customizing your work 
environment to suit your style. After that is a date with 
the Dock. And last but certainly not least, you discover 
some additional tasks that will make life with Snow 
Leopard ever so much easier.
So get comfortable, roll up your sleeves, fire up your Mac 
if you like, and settle down with Part I, a delightful little 
section I like to think of as “The Hassle-Free Way to Get 
Started with Mac OS X Snow Leopard.”

Chapter 1
Mac OS X Snow Leopard 101 
(Prerequisites: None)
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what an operating system is and is not
▶ Turning on your Mac
▶ Getting to know the startup process
▶ Turning off your Mac
▶ Avoiding major Mac mistakes
▶ Pointing, clicking, dragging, and other uses for your mouse
▶ Getting help from your Mac
C
ongratulate yourself on choosing Mac OS X, which stands for Macintosh 
Operating System X — that’s the Roman numeral ten, not the letter X 
(pronounced ten, not ex). You made a smart move because you scored more 
than just an operating-system upgrade. Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes 
several new features to make using your Mac easier, and dozens of improve-
ments that help you do more work in less time.
In this chapter, I start at the very beginning and talk about Mac OS X in 
mostly abstract terms; then I move on to explain what you need to know to 
use Mac OS X Snow Leopard successfully.
If you’ve been using Mac OS X for a while, some of the information in this chapter 
might seem hauntingly familiar; some features that I describe haven’t changed 
from earlier versions of Mac OS X. But if you decide to skip this chapter because 
you think you have all the new stuff figured out, I assure you that you’ll miss 
at least a couple of things that Apple didn’t bother to tell you (as if you read 
every word in Mac OS X Help, the only user manual Apple provides, anyway!).
Tantalized? Let’s rock.

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
If you’re about to upgrade to Snow Leopard from an earlier version of Mac OS X, 
I feel obliged to mention a major pitfall to avoid: One very specific misplaced 
click, done while installing your new OS, could erase every file on your hard 
drive. The appendix describes this situation in full and loving detail, and it 
contains other important information about installing Snow Leopard that can 
make upgrading a more pleasant experience.
Gnawing to the Core of OS X
The operating system (that is, the OS in Mac OS X) is what makes a Mac a 
Mac. Without it, your Mac is a pile of silicon and circuits — no smarter than a 
toaster.
“So what does an operating system do?” you ask. Good question. The short 
answer is that an operating system controls the basic and most important 
functions of your computer. In the case of Mac OS X and your Mac, the 
operating system
 
✓ Manages memory
 
✓ Controls how windows, icons, and menus work
 
✓ Keeps track of files
 
✓ Manages networking
 
✓ Does housekeeping (No kidding!)
Other forms of software, such as word processors and Web browsers, rely on 
the operating system to create and maintain the environment in which they 
work their magic. When you create a memo, for example, the word processor 
provides the tools for you to type and format the information. In the background, 
the operating system is the muscle for the word processor, performing crucial 
functions such as the following:
 
✓ Providing the mechanism for drawing and moving the on-screen window 
in which you write the memo
 
✓ Keeping track of a file when you save it
 
✓ Helping the word processor create drop-down menus and dialogs for 
you to interact with
 
✓ Communicating with other programs
 
✓ And much, much more (stuff that only geeks could care about)

11
 Chapter 1: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 101 (Prerequisites: None)
So, armed with a little background in operating systems, take a gander at the 
next section before you do anything else with your Mac.
One last thing: As I mention in the introduction (I’m only repeating it here in 
case you normally don’t read introductions), Mac OS X Snow Leopard comes 
with more than 50 applications. And though I’d love to tell you all about each 
and every one, I have only so many pages at my disposal. If you need more 
info on the programs I don’t cover, may I (again) recommend Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard All-in-One For Dummies, written by Mark L. Chambers; iLife All-in-
One For Dummies, written by my old friends Tony Bove and Cheryl Rhodes; 
or iMovie & iDVD ’09 For Dummies by the technical editor of this very book, 
Dennis Cohen, and his brother Michael (all three titles are from Wiley).
The Mac advantage
Most of the world’s personal computers use 
Microsoft Windows. But you’re among the 
lucky few to have a computer with an operating 
system that’s intuitive, easy to use, and (dare 
I say?) fun. If you don’t believe me, try using 
Windows for a day or two. Go ahead. You prob-
ably won’t suffer any permanent damage. In 
fact, you’ll really begin to appreciate how good 
you have it. Feel free to hug your Mac. Or give 
it a peck on the disc-drive slot — just try not to 
get your tongue caught.
As someone once told me, “Claiming that the 
Macintosh is inferior to Windows because 
most people use Windows is like saying that 
all other restaurants serve food that’s inferior 
to McDonald’s.”
We might be a minority, but Mac users have 
the best, most stable, most modern all-purpose 
operating system in the world, and here’s why: 
UNIX — on which Mac OS X is based — is 
widely regarded as the best industrial-strength 
operating system on the planet. For now, just 
know that being based on UNIX means that a 
Mac running OS X will crash less often than 
an older Mac or a Windows machine, which 
means less downtime. And being UNIX-based 
also means far fewer viruses and malicious 
software. But perhaps the biggest advantage 
OS X has is that when an application crashes, 
it doesn’t crash your entire computer, and you 
don’t have to restart the whole computer to 
continue working.
By the way, with the advent of Intel-powered 
Macs a few years ago, you can now run 
Windows natively. That’s right — you can now 
install and run Microsoft Windows on any Mac 
powered by an Intel processor, as described in 
Chapter 16.
Don’t let that UNIX stuff scare you. It’s there 
if you want it, but if you don’t want it or don’t 
care (like most of us), you’ll rarely even know 
it’s there. All you’ll know is that your Mac just 
runs and runs and runs without crashing and 
crashing and crashing.

12
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
A Safety Net for the Absolute 
Beginner (Or Any User)
In the following sections, I deal with the stuff that the manual that came with 
your Mac doesn’t cover — or doesn’t cover in nearly enough detail. If you’re a 
first-time Macintosh user, please, please read this section of the book carefully —
it could save your life. Okay, okay, perhaps I’m being overly dramatic. What 
I mean to say is that reading this section could save your Mac. Even if you’re 
an experienced Mac user, you might want to read this section anyway. Chances 
are good that you’ll see at least a few things you might have forgotten that 
might come in handy.
Turning the dang thing on
Okay. This is the big moment — turning on your Mac! Gaze at it longingly first 
and say something cheesy, such as “You’re the most awesome computer I’ve 
ever known.” If that doesn’t turn on your Mac (and it probably won’t), keep 
reading.
Apple, in its infinite wisdom, has manufactured Macs with power buttons on 
every conceivable surface: on the front, side, and back of the computer itself, 
and even on the keyboard or monitor.
So if you don’t know how to turn on your Mac, don’t feel bad — just look in 
the manual or booklet that came with your Mac. It’s at least one thing that 
the documentation always covers.
 
 These days, most Macs have a power-on button near the keyboard (notebooks) 
or the back side (iMacs). It usually looks like the little circle thingie you see in 
the margin.
 
Don’t bother choosing Help➪Mac Help, which opens the Help Viewer program, 
because it can’t tell you where the switch is. Although the Help program is 
good for finding out a lot of things, the location of the power switch isn’t 
among them. Of course, if you haven’t found the switch and turned on the Mac, 
you can’t access Help anyway. (D’oh!)
What you should see on startup
When you finally do turn on your Macintosh, you set in motion a sophisticated 
and complex series of events that culminates in the loading of Mac OS X and 
the appearance of the Mac OS X Desktop. After a small bit of whirring, 

13
 Chapter 1: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 101 (Prerequisites: None)
buzzing, and flashing (meaning that the operating system is loading), OS X 
first tests all your hardware — slots, ports, disks, random-access memory 
(RAM), and so on. If everything passes, you hear a pleasing musical tone and 
see the tasteful gray Apple logo in the middle of your screen, along with a 
small spinning-pinwheel cursor somewhere on the screen. Both are shown in 
Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1: 
This is what 
you’ll see if 
everything 
is fine 
and dandy 
when you 
turn your 
Mac on.
 
Here are the things that might happen when you power up your Mac:
 
✓ Everything is fine and dandy: Next, you might or might not see the 
Mac OS X login screen, where you enter your name and password. If you 
do, press Return or Enter (after you type your name and password, of 
course), and away you go.
 
 If you don’t want to have to type your name and password every time 
you start or restart your Mac (or even if you do), check out Chapter 16 
for the scoop on how to turn the login screen on or off.
 
 Either way, the Desktop soon materializes before your eyes. If you 
haven’t customized, configured, or tinkered with your Desktop, it should 
look pretty much like Figure 1-2. Now is a good time to take a moment 
for positive thoughts about the person who convinced you that you 
wanted a Mac. That person was right!
 
✓ Blue/black/gray screen of death: If any of your hardware fails when it’s 
tested, you might see a blue, black, or gray screen.
 
 Some older Macs played the sound of a horrible car wreck instead of the 
chimes, complete with crying tires and busting glass. It was exception-
ally unnerving, which might be why Apple doesn’t use it anymore.
 
 The fact that something went wrong is no reflection on your prowess as 
a Macintosh user. Something is broken, and your Mac may need repairs. 
If this is happening to you right now, check out Chapter 19 to try to get 
your Mac well again.

 If your computer is under warranty, dial 1-800-SOS-APPL, and a customer-
service person can tell you what to do. Before you do anything, though, 
skip ahead to Chapter 19. It’s entirely possible that one of the sugges-
tions there can get you back on track without your having to spend even 
a moment on hold.
 
 
✓ Prohibitory sign (formerly known as the flashing-question-mark disk): 
Most users eventually encounter the prohibitory sign shown in the left 
margin (which replaced the flashing question-mark-on-a-disk icon and 
flashing folder icon back in Mac OS X Jaguar). This icon means your Mac 
can’t find a startup disk, hard drive, network server, or DVD-ROM con-
taining a valid Macintosh operating system. See Chapter 19 for ways you 
can try to ease your Mac’s ills.
 
✓ Kernel panic: You shouldn’t see this very often, but you might occasion-
ally see a block of text in four languages, including English, as shown in 
Figure 1-3. This means that your Mac has experienced a kernel panic, the 
most severe type of system crash. If you restart your Mac and see this 
message again, look in Chapter 19 for a myriad of possible cures for all 
kinds of ailments, including this one.

How do you know which version of the Mac OS your computer has? Simple: 
 
1. Choose About This Mac from the Ú menu (the menu with the Ú 
symbol in the upper-left corner of the menu bar). 
 
 The About This Mac window pops up on your screen, as shown in 
Figure 1-4. The version you’re running appears just below Mac OS X in 
the center of the window. Version 10.6 is the release we know as Snow 
Leopard. 
 
 If you’re curious or just want to impress your friends, Mac OS X version 10.5 
was known as Leopard; 10.4 as Tiger; 10.3 as Panther; 10.2 as Jaguar; 10.1 as 
Puma; and 10.0 as Cheetah.
The legend of boot
Boot this. Boot that. “I booted my Mac and. . . .” 
or “Did it boot?” and so on. Talking about com-
puters for long without hearing the boot word is 
nearly impossible.
But why boot? Why not shoe or shirt or even 
shazam?
Back in the very olden days — say 1958 or a 
little earlier — starting up a computer required 
you to toggle little manual switches on the 
front panel, which began an internal process 
that loaded the operating system. The process 
became known as bootstrapping because if you 
toggled the right switches, the computer would 
“pull itself up by its bootstraps.” This phrase 
didn’t take long to transmogrify into booting and 
finally to boot.
Over the years, booting has come to mean turn-
ing on almost any computer or even a periph-
eral device, such as a printer. Some people 
also use it to refer to launching an application: 
“I booted Excel.”
So the next time one of your gearhead friends 
says the b-word, ask whether he knows where 
the term comes from. Then dazzle him with the 
depth and breadth of your (not-quite-useful) 
knowledge!

 This app shows you much more information, including bus speed, number 
of processors, caches, installed memory, networking, storage devices, and 
much more. You can find more about this useful program in Chapter 18.

Shutting down properly
Turning off the power without shutting down your Mac properly is one of the 
worst things you can do to your poor Mac. Shutting down your Mac improp-
erly can really screw up your hard drive, scramble the contents of your most 
important files, or both.
 
If a thunderstorm is rumbling nearby or you’re unfortunate enough to have 
rolling blackouts where you live, you might really want to shut down your 
Mac. (See the next section, where I briefly discuss lightning and your Mac.)
 
To turn off your Mac, always use the Shut Down command on the Ú menu 
(which I discuss in Chapter 4) or shut down in one of these kind-and-gentle 
ways:
 
✓ Press the Power key once and then click the Shut Down button.
 
✓ On keyboards that don’t have a Power key, press Control+Eject instead — 
and then click the Shut Down button that appears (or press the Return 
key, which does the same thing).
Of course, most Mac users have broken this rule several times without any-
thing horrible happening — but don’t be lulled into a false sense of security. 
Break the rules one time too many (or under the wrong circumstances), and 
your most important file will be toast. The only time you should turn off your 
Mac without shutting down properly is when your screen is frozen or when 
your system crashed and you’ve already tried everything else. (See Chapter 19 

17
 Chapter 1: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 101 (Prerequisites: None)
for what those “everything elses” are.) A really stubborn crash doesn’t happen 
often — and less often under OS X than ever before — but when it does, forcing 
your Mac to turn off and then back on might be the only solution.
A few things you should definitely 
NOT do with your Mac
In this section, I cover the bad stuff that can happen to your computer if you 
do the wrong things with it. If something bad has already happened to you — 
I know . . . I’m beginning to sound like a broken record — see Chapter 19.
 
✓ Don’t unplug your Mac when it’s turned on. Very bad things can 
happen, such as having your operating system break. See the preceding 
section, where I discuss shutting down your system properly.
 
✓ Don’t use your Mac when lightning is near. Here’s a simple life equa-
tion for you: Mac + lightning = dead Mac. ’Nuff said. Oh, and don’t place 
much faith in inexpensive surge protectors. A good jolt of lightning will 
fry the surge protector right along with your computer — as well as pos-
sibly frying your modem, printer, and anything else plugged into it. Some 
surge protectors can withstand most lightning strikes, but those war-
riors aren’t the cheapies that you buy at your local computer emporium. 
Unplugging your Mac from the wall during electrical storms is safer and 
less expensive. (Don’t forget to unplug your external modem, network 
hubs, printers, and other hardware that plugs into the wall, as well — 
lightning can fry them, too.)
 
✓ Don’t jostle, bump, shake, kick, throw, dribble, or punt your Mac, 
especially while it’s running. Your Mac contains a hard drive that spins 
at 4,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) or more. A jolt to a hard drive 
while it’s reading or writing a file can cause the head to crash into the 
disk, which can render many — or all — files on it unrecoverable. Ouch!
 
✓ Don’t forget to back up your data! If the stuff on your hard drive means 
anything to you, you must back it up. Not maybe. You must. Even if your 
most important file is your last saved game of Call of Duty 2, you still 
need to realize how important it is to back up your files. Fortunately, 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes an awesome backup utility called Time 
Machine. (Unfortunately, you need either an external hard drive or an 
Apple Time Capsule device to take advantage of it.) So I beg you: Please 
read Chapter 17 now and find out how to back up before something hor-
rible happens to your valuable data!
 
 I strongly recommend that you read Chapter 17 sooner rather than later — 
preferably before you do any significant work on your Mac. Dr. Macintosh 
says, “There are only two kinds of Mac users: those who have never lost 
data and those who will.” Which kind do you want to be?

✓ Don’t kiss your monitor while wearing stuff on your lips. For obvious rea-
sons! Use a soft cloth and/or OmniCleanz display cleaning solution (I love 
the stuff, made by RadTech; www.radtech.us) to clean your display.
Point-and-click boot camp
Are you new to the Mac? Just figuring out how to move the mouse around? Now 
is a good time to go over some fundamental stuff that you need to know for just 
about everything you’ll be doing on the Mac. Spend a few minutes reading this 
section, and soon you’ll be clicking, double-clicking, pressing, and pointing all 
over the place. If you think you have the whole mousing thing pretty much 
figured out, feel free to skip this section. I’ll catch you on the other side.
Still with me? Good. Now for some basic terminology:
 
✓ Point: Before you can click or press anything, you have to point to it. 
Place your hand on your mouse and move it so that the cursor arrow is 
over the object you want — like on top of an icon or a button. 
 
✓ Click: Also called single-click. Use your index finger to push the mouse 
button all the way down and then let go so the button produces a satis-
fying clicking sound. (If you have one of the new optical Apple Pro mice, 
you push down the whole thing to click.) Use a single-click to highlight 
an icon, press a button, or activate a check box or window.
 
 In other words, first you point and then you click — point and click, in 
computer lingo.
Eternally yours . . . now
Mac OS X is designed so you never have to 
shut it down. You can configure it to sleep after 
a specified period of inactivity. (See Chapter 
16 for more info on the Energy Saver features 
of OS X.) If you do so, your Mac will consume 
very little electricity when it’s sleeping and will 
usually be ready to use (by pressing any key or 
clicking the mouse) in less than a minute. On 
the other hand, if you’re not going to be using it 
for a few days, you might want to shut it down 
anyway.
Note: If you leave your Mac on constantly and 
you’re gone when a lightning storm or rolling 
blackout hits, your Mac might get wasted. So 
be sure you have adequate protection — say, 
a decent surge protector designed specifically 
for computers — if you decide to leave your 
Mac on and unattended for long periods. See 
the section “A few things you should definitely 
NOT do with your Mac,” elsewhere in this 
chapter, for more info on lightning and your 
Mac. Frankly, if I plan to be away from mine for 
more than a day, I usually shut it down, just in 
case. But because OS X is designed to run 24/7, 
I don’t shut it down at night unless the night 
happens to be dark and stormy.

 Chapter 1: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 101 (Prerequisites: None)
 
✓ Double-click: Click twice in rapid succession. With a little practice, you 
can perfect this technique in no time. Use a double-click to open a folder 
or to launch a file or application.
 
✓ Control+click: Hold down the Control key while single-clicking. 
Control+clicking is the same as right-clicking a Windows system and 
displays a menu (called a contextual menu) where you Control+clicked. 
In fact, if you’re blessed with a two-or-more-button mouse such as the 
Apple Mighty Mouse, you can right-click and avoid having to hold down 
the Control key.
 
 I use the five-button Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 and recommend 
it highly.
 
✓ Drag: Dragging something usually means you have to click it first and 
hold down the mouse button. Then you move the mouse on your desk 
or mouse pad so the cursor and whatever you select move across the 
screen. The combination of holding down the button and dragging the 
mouse is usually referred to as click and drag.
 
✓ Choosing an item from a menu: To get to Mac OS menu commands, you 
must first open a menu and then pick the option you want. Point at the 
name of the menu you want with your cursor, press the mouse button 
down, and then drag downward until you select the command you want. 
When the command is highlighted, finish selecting by letting go of the 
mouse button.
 
If you’re a longtime Mac user, you probably hold down the mouse button the 
whole time between clicking the name of the menu and selecting the command 
you want. You can still do it that way, but you can also click the menu name to 
open it, release the mouse button, drag down to the item you want to select, 
and then click again. In other words, OS X menus stay open after you click 
them, even if you’re not holding down the mouse button. After you click a menu 
to open it, you can even type the first letter (or letters) of the item to select it 
and then execute that item by pressing the Spacebar or the Return or Enter key. 
A menu remains open until you click something else. 
Go ahead and give it a try . . . I’ll wait.
Not Just a Beatles Movie: 
Help and the Help Menu
One of the best features about all Macs is the excellent built-in help, and Mac 
OS X doesn’t cheat you on that legacy: This system has online help in abun-
dance. When you have a question about how to do something, the Mac Help 
Center is the first place you should visit (after this book, of course).

20
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Clicking the Help menu reveals the Search Help field at the top of the menu 
and the Mac Help item, which opens the Mac Help window, as shown in 
Figure 1-5.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Mac Help 
is nothing if 
not helpful.
 
The keyboard shortcut for Help appears on the Help menu as Ô+?, but you 
really need to press $+Ô+? to open Help through the keyboard. 
 
Just so you know, this is the only shortcut I can think of where the menu doesn’t 
display an up-arrow ($+Ô+?) to let you know you need to press Shift.
You can find out much more about keyboard shortcuts in Chapter 2.
To use Mac Help, simply type a word or phrase into the text field at the top 
right and then press Return or Enter. In a few seconds, your Mac provides 
you one or more articles to read, which (theoretically) are related to your 
question. Usually. For example, if you type menus and press Return, you get 
15 different help topics, as shown in Figure 1-6.

21
 Chapter 1: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 101 (Prerequisites: None)
 
Figure 1-6: 
You have 
questions? 
Mac has 
answers.
 
Now, here’s a cool feature I like to call automatic visual help cues. Here’s how 
they work:
 
1. Type a word or phrase in the Help menu’s Search field.
 
2. Select any item that has a menu icon to its left (such as the Secure 
Empty Trash item in Figure 1-7).
 
 The automatic visual cue — an arrow — appears, pointing at that 
command in the appropriate menu.

22

Figure 1-7: 
If you 
choose an 
item with a 
menu icon, 
an arrow 
points to 
that item in 
context. 
 
 
Although you don’t have to be connected to the Internet to use Mac Help, you 
do need an Internet connection to get the most out of it. (Chapter 9 can help 
you set up an Internet connection, if you don’t have one.) That’s because OS X 
installs only certain help articles on your hard drive. If you ask a question 
that those articles don’t answer, Mac Help connects to Apple’s Web site and 
downloads the answer (assuming that you have an active Internet connection). 
These answers are the “Support Articles,” denoted by a plus sign (as shown in 
the lower part of the window in Figure 1-6, earlier in this chapter). Click one of 
these entries, and Help Viewer retrieves the text over the Internet. Although 
this can sometimes be inconvenient, it’s also quite smart. This way Apple can 
update the Help system at any time without requiring any action from you.
Furthermore, after you’ve asked a question and Mac Help has grabbed the 
answer from the Apple Web site, the answer remains on your hard drive 
forever. If you ask for it again — even at a later date — your computer won’t 
have to download it from the Apple Web site again.

The Desktop and Windows 
and Menus (Oh My)!
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out the parts of a window
▶ Dealing with dealie-boppers in windows
▶ Resizing, moving, and closing windows
▶ Getting comfortable with menu basics
T
his chapter introduces important features of Mac OS X, starting with the 
first thing you see when you log in — the Finder and its Desktop. After a 
quick look around the Desktop, you get a look into two of its most useful fea-
tures: windows and menus.
Windows are (and have always been) an integral part of Macintosh comput-
ing. Windows in the Finder (or, as a PC user would say, “on the Desktop”) show 
you the contents of the hard drive, optical drive, flash (thumb) drive, network 
drive, disk image, and folder icons; windows in applications do many things. 
The point is that windows are part of what makes your Mac a Mac; knowing 
how they work — and how to use them — is essential.
Menus are another quintessential part of the Macintosh experience. The 
latter part of this chapter starts you out with a few menu basics. As needed, 
I direct you to other parts of the book for greater detail. So relax and don’t 
worry. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be ready to work with windows and 
menus in any application that uses them (and most applications, games 
excluded, do).

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Touring the Finder and Its Desktop
The Finder is the program that creates the Desktop, keeps track of your files 
and folders, and is always running. Just about everything you do on your Mac 
begins and ends with the Finder. It’s where you manage files, store documents, 
launch programs, and much more. If you ever expect to master your Mac, the 
first step is to master the Finder and its Desktop. Check out the default Mac 
Finder and Desktop for Mac OS X Snow Leopard in Figure 2-1.
The Finder is the center of your Mac OS experience, so before I go any further, 
here’s a quick description of its most prominent features:
 
✓ Desktop: The Desktop is the area behind the windows and the Dock, where 
your hard-drive icon (ordinarily) lives. The Desktop isn’t a window, yet it 
acts like one. Like a folder window or drive window, the Desktop can 
contain icons. But unlike most windows, which require a bit of navigation 
to get to, the Desktop is a great place for things you use a lot, such as 
folders, applications, or particular documents.

 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
 
 Some folks use the terms Desktop and Finder interchangeably to refer to 
the total Macintosh environment you see after you log in — the icons, 
windows, menus, and all that other cool stuff. Just to make things confus-
ing, the background you see on your screen — the picture behind your 
hard-drive icon and your open windows — is also called the Desktop. In 
this book, I refer to the application you use when the Desktop is showing 
as the Finder. When I say Desktop, I’m talking about the picture back-
ground behind your windows and the Dock, which you can use as a stor-
age place for icons if you want.
 
 To make things even more confusing, the Desktop is a full-screen rep-
resentation of the icons in the Desktop folder inside your Home folder. 
Don’t panic — this is all explained in more detail in Chapter 6. 
 
✓ Dock: The Dock is the Finder’s main navigation shortcut tool. It makes 
getting to frequently used icons easy, even when you have a screen full 
of windows. Like the Desktop, the Dock is a great place for things you 
use a lot, such as folders, applications, or particular documents. Besides 
putting your frequently used icons at your fingertips, it’s almost infinitely 
customizable; read more about it in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Icons: Icons are the little pictures you see in your windows and even on 
your Desktop. Most icons are containers for things you work with on 
your Mac, such as programs and documents, which are also represented 
by — you guessed it — icons.
 
✓ Windows: Opening most icons (by double-clicking them) makes a 
window appear. Windows in the Finder show you the contents of hard-
drive and folder icons, and windows in applications usually show you 
the contents of your documents. In the sections that follow, you can find 
the full scoop on Snow Leopard windows, which are very different from 
Mac windows in previous OS releases.
 
✓ Menus: Menus let you choose to do things, such as create new folders; 
duplicate files; cut, copy, or paste text; and so on. I introduce menu 
basics later in this chapter; you find details about working with menus 
for specific tasks throughout this book.
Whereas this section offers a basic introduction to the Finder and Desktop, 
Chapter 5 explains in detail how to navigate and manage your files in the 
Finder. You find out how to use the Finder toolbar, navigate folders and sub-
folders, and switch among views, among other things. But before you start 
using the Finder, it will help you to know the basics of working with windows 
and menus; if these Mac features are new to you, I suggest you read all of this 
chapter and pay special attention to Chapter 5 later.

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Anatomy of a Window
Windows are a ubiquitous part of using a Mac. When you open a folder, you 
see a window. When you write a letter, the document that you’re working on 
appears in a window. When you browse the Internet, Web pages appear in a 
window . . . and so on.
For the most part, windows are windows from program to program. You’ll 
probably notice that some programs (Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Word, 
for example) take liberties with windows by adding features (such as pop-up 
menus) or textual information (such as zoom percentage or file size) in the 
scroll-bar area of a document window.
Don’t let it bug you; that extra fluff is just window dressing (pun intended). 
Maintaining the window metaphor, many information windows display different 
kinds of information in different panes, or discrete sections.
And so, without further ado, the following list gives you a look at the main 
features of a typical Finder window (as shown in Figure 2-2). I discuss
these features in greater detail in later sections of this chapter.

 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
 
If your windows don’t look exactly like the one shown in Figure 2-2, don’t be 
concerned. You can make your windows look and feel any way you like. As I 
explain later in this section, moving and resizing windows are easy tasks. 
Chapter 3 explains how to customize certain window features. Chapter 5 
focuses on ways you can change a window’s view specifically when you’re 
using the Finder.
Meanwhile, here’s what you see (clockwise from top left):
 
✓ Close, Minimize, and Zoom (gumdrop) buttons: Shut ’em, shrink and 
place ’em in the Dock, and make ’em grow.
 
✓ View buttons: Choose among four exciting views of your window: Icon, 
List, Column, and Cover Flow. Find out more about views in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Quick Look/Slideshow button: Gives you a quick peek at the contents of 
the selected item. If more than one item is selected, it gives you a quick 
peek of one item and next and previous buttons so you can view the 
others slide show style.
 
✓ Action button: This button is really a pop-up menu of commands you 
can apply to currently selected items in the Finder window.
 
✓ Window title: Shows the name of the window.
 
✓ Search field: Type a string of characters here, and Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard digs into your system to find items that match.
 
✓ Hide/Show Toolbar button: Causes your computer to melt into a puddle 
of molten silicon slag. Just kidding! This button actually does what its 
name implies — hides or shows the toolbar (and Sidebar) of a window.
 
✓ Toolbar: Buttons for frequently used commands and actions.
 
✓ Window Resizer: Click and drag here to resize the window.
 
✓ Icon Resizer: Use this slide control to change the size of the icons in this 
window. (Note that this control only appears on windows in the Icon 
view, which you find out all about in Chapter 5.) 
 
✓ Scroll bars: Use the scroll bars for moving around a window.
 
✓ Sidebar: Frequently used items live here.
 
✓ Forward and Back buttons: These buttons take you to the next or 
previous folder displayed in this particular window.
 
 If you’re familiar with Web browsers, the Forward and Back buttons in 
the Finder work exactly the same way. The first time you open a window, 
neither button is active. But as you navigate from folder to folder, these 
buttons remember your breadcrumb trail so you can quickly traverse 
backward or forward, window by window. You can even navigate this 
way from the keyboard by using the shortcuts Ô+[ for Back and Ô+] for 
Forward.

28
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
 The Forward and Back buttons remember only the other folders you’ve 
visited that appear in that open window. If you’ve set a Finder Preference 
so that a folder always opens in a new window — or if you forced a 
folder to open in a new window, which I describe in a bit — the Forward 
and Back buttons won’t work. You have to use the modern, OS X–style 
window option, which uses a single window, or the buttons are useless.
 
This frosts me. If you hide the toolbar, the Sidebar is also hidden, whether 
you like it or not. Conversely, if you want to see the toolbar, you have no 
choice but to also see the Sidebar. So if you want to hide the toolbar and see 
the Sidebar, or vice versa, you’re out of luck. If I had my druthers, I’d hide the 
toolbar (which I rarely use) and keep the Sidebar (which I use constantly). For 
some unfathomable reason, Apple doesn’t allow that.
Top o’ the window to ya!
Take a gander at the top of a window — any window. You see three buttons 
in the upper-left corner and the name of the window in the top center. The 
three buttons (called gumdrop buttons by some folks because they look like, 
well, gumdrops) are officially known as Close, Minimize, and Zoom, and their 
colors (red, yellow, and green, respectively) pop off the screen. Here’s what 
they do:
 
✓ Close (red): Click this button to close the window.
 
✓ Minimize (yellow): Click this button to minimize the window. Clicking 
Minimize appears to close the window, but instead of making it disap-
pear, Minimize adds an icon for the window in the Dock. To view the 
window again, click the Dock icon for the window that you minimized. If 
the window happens to be a QuickTime movie, the movie continues to 
play, albeit at postage-stamp size, in its icon in the Dock. (I discuss the 
Dock in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Zoom (green): Click this button to make the window larger or smaller, 
depending on its current size. If you’re looking at a standard-size 
window, clicking Zoom usually makes it bigger. (I say usually because if 
the window is larger than its contents, clicking this button shrinks the 
window to the smallest size that can completely enclose the contents 
without scrolling.) Click the Zoom button again to return the window to 
its previous size.
 
 Some people still call the Zoom button by its Mac OS 9 name, Grow.

29
 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
A scroll new world
Yet another way to see more of what’s in a window or pane is to scroll 
through it. Scroll bars appear at the bottom and right sides of any window 
or pane that contains more stuff — icons, text, pixels, or whatever — than 
you can see in the window. Figure 2-3, for example, shows two instances 
of the same window: Dragging the scroll bar on the right side of the front 
window reveals the items above Font Book and iCal and below Photo Booth 
and Preview, which you can see in the expanded window in the background. 
Dragging the scroll bar on the bottom of the window reveals items to the left 
and right, such as Exposé, iChat, iCal, and iTunes.
Simply click and drag a scroll bar to move it up or down or side to side. And 
yes, the scroll bars also look a bit gumdrop-like. As best as I can tell, Steve 
Jobs (Apple’s charismatic CEO) has a thing for gumdrops.

30
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
You can scroll in the following four ways:
 
✓ Click a scroll bar and drag. The content of the window scrolls propor-
tionally to how far you drag the scroll bar.
 
✓ Click in the scroll bar area but don’t click the scroll bar itself. The 
window scrolls either one page up (if you click above the scroll bar) or 
down (if you click below the scroll bar). You can change a setting in your 
General System Preferences pane to cause the window to scroll propor-
tionally to where you click.
 
 For what it’s worth, the Page Up and Page Down keys on your keyboard 
function the same way as clicking the grayish scroll bar area (the verti-
cal scroll bar only) in the Finder and many applications. But these keys 
don’t work in every program; don’t become too dependent on them. 
Also, if you’ve purchased a mouse, trackball, or other pointing device 
that has a scroll wheel, you can scroll vertically in the active (front) 
window with the scroll wheel or press and hold the Shift key to scroll 
horizontally. Alas, this horizontal scrolling-with-the-Shift-key works in 
Finder windows, but not in all applications. For example, it works in 
Apple’s TextEdit application but not in Microsoft Word.
 
✓ Click a scroll arrow at the top or bottom of a scroll area. By default, 
both arrows appear at the bottom of the scroll bar, as shown in Figure 2-3. 
You can set your General System Preferences so that you see one arrow 
at each end of the scroll area, as I explain in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Use the keyboard. In the Finder, first click an icon in the window and 
then use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right. Using an arrow 
key selects the next icon in the direction it indicates — and automati-
cally scrolls the window, if necessary. In other programs, you might or 
might not be able to use the keyboard to scroll. The best advice I can 
give you is to try it — either it’ll work or it won’t.
(Hyper) Active windows
To work within a window, the window must be active. The active window is 
always the frontmost window, and inactive windows always appear behind 
the active window. Only one window can be active at a time. To make a 
window active, click it anywhere — in the middle, on the title bar, or on a 
scroll bar. It doesn’t matter where you click, with one proviso: You can’t click 
the red, yellow, or green gumdrop buttons or the clear Hide/Show button of 
an inactive window to activate it.
Look at Figure 2-4 for an example of an active window in front of an inactive 
window (the Applications window and the Utilities window, respectively).

 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
 
Figure 2-4:

window in

Inactive window
Active window
The following is a list of the major visual cues that distinguish active from 
inactive windows:
 
✓ The active window’s title bar: The Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons 
are red, yellow, and green. The inactive windows’ buttons are not.
 
 This is a nice visual cue — colored items are active, and gray ones are 
inactive. Better still, if you move your mouse over an inactive window’s 
gumdrop buttons, they light up in their usual colors so you can close, 
minimize, or zoom an inactive window without first making it active. Neat!
 
✓ Other buttons and scroll bars in an active window: They’re bright. In 
an inactive window, these features are grayed out and more subdued.
 
✓ Bigger and darker drop shadows in an active window: They grab your 
attention more than those of inactive windows.
Dialog Dealie-Boppers
Dialogs are special windows that pop up over the active window. You gener-
ally see them when you select a menu item that ends in an ellipsis (...).
Dialogs can contain a number of standard Macintosh features (I call them 
dealie-boppers), such as radio buttons, pop-up menus, tabs, text-entry fields, 

32
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
and check boxes. You see these features again and again in dialogs. Take a 
moment to look at each of these dealie-boppers in Figure 2-5.
 
✓ Radio buttons: Radio buttons are so named because, like the buttons 
on your car radio (if you have a very old car), only one at a time can be 
active. (When they’re active, they appear to be pushed in, just like the 
old radio buttons.) Radio buttons always appear in a group of two or 
more; when you select one, all the others are automatically deselected.
 
 Here’s a nifty and undocumented shortcut: You can usually select check 
boxes and radio buttons by clicking their names (instead of the buttons 
or boxes).
 
✓ Tabs: When a dialog contains more information than can fit in a single 
window, the info is divided among tabs. In Figure 2-5, the New Document tab 
is selected on the left, and the Open and Save tab is selected on the right.
 
✓ Pop-up menus: These menus are appropriately named because that’s 
what they do — they pop up when you click them. In Figure 2-5, the 
Autosave Modified Documents menu has been clicked and is popped up; 
the five other pop-up menus — Opening Files, Saving Files, Document 
Type, Styling, and Encoding — are unclicked and unpopped.
 
 You can always recognize a pop-up menu because it appears in a slightly 
rounded rectangle and has a double-ended arrow symbol (or a pair of 
triangles, if you like) on the right.
 
 Have you figured out yet what radio buttons, tabs, and pop-up menus have 
in common? Hint: All three enable you to make a single selection from a 
group of options. (Well, okay, that was more of an answer than a hint.)

✓ Text-entry fields: In text-entry fields, you type text (including numbers) 
from the keyboard. In Figure 2-5, the Window Width, Window Height, 
Author, Company, and Copyright options are text-entry fields.
 
✓ Check boxes: The last dealie-bopper that you see frequently is the check 
box. In a group of check boxes, you can select as many options as you 
like. Check boxes are selected when they contain a check mark, and they 
are deselected when they’re empty, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 
Some applications have tri-state check boxes (and no, I’m not talking geogra-
phy here). These special check boxes are empty when nothing in the group is 
enabled, sport an x when everything in the group is enabled, and sport a minus 
sign (–) when some items in the group are enabled and some are not. This type 
of check box is often used for the Custom Install screen of Mac OS X installers.
Working with Windows
In the following sections, I give you a closer look at windows themselves: how 
you move them, size them, and use them. And although Mac OS X windows 
are similar to windows you’ve used in other versions of Mac OS, they have 
some new wrinkles.
 
If you’re relatively new to the Mac, you might want to read this section while 
sitting at your computer, trying the techniques as you read them. You might 
find it easier to remember something you read if you actually do it. If you’ve 
been using your Mac for a while, you’ve probably figured out how windows 
work by now.
Opening and closing windows
To start peering into windows on your Mac, first you need to know how to 
open and close them. When you’re working in the Finder, you can choose the 
following commands from the File menu. In many other programs, you can 
probably find some similar commands on the File menu of that program.
 
You’ll use many of these commands frequently, so it would behoove you to 
memorize the keyboard shortcuts. If you’re not sure how keyboard shortcuts 
work, check out “Using keyboard shortcut commands,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ New Finder Window (Ô+N): Opens a new Finder window. In other 
programs, Ô+N might open a new document, project, or whatever 
that program helps you create.
 
✓ Open (Ô+O): Opens the selected item, be it an icon, a window, or a folder.

34
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ Close Window (Ô+W): Closes the active window. If no windows are 
open or if no window is selected, the Close Window command is grayed 
out and can’t be chosen. Or if you prefer, you can close a window by 
clicking the red Close button in the upper-left corner.
 
 If you also hold down the Option key with the File menu open, the Close 
Window command changes to Close All. This very useful command 
enables you to close all open Finder windows. But it shows up only 
when you press the Option key; otherwise it remains hidden.
Resizing windows
If you want to see more (or less) of what’s in a window, use the Resizer in 
the extreme lower-right corner of a window. (Refer to Figure 2-2 to see the 
Resizer; it’s in the lower-right corner and has little diagonal grippy lines on 
it.) Just drag the Resizer downward and/or to the right to make a window 
larger. Or drag it upward and/or to the left to make a window smaller. In other 
words, after you grab the Resizer, you can make a window whatever size you 
like.
Resizing window panes
 
 Display windows, like those in the Finder, frequently consist of multiple 
panes. If you look at Figure 2-2, the line divides the blue Sidebar to the left of 
it and the actual contents of the window to the right. When your mouse 
pointer hovers over the resizing area of this bar, the cursor changes to a ver-
tical bar (or it could be horizontal if the panes are one above the other) with 
little arrows pointing out of both sides. When you see this cursor, you can 
click and drag anywhere in the strip that divides the Sidebar from the rest of 
the window. Doing so resizes the two panes relative to each other; one gets 
larger and one gets smaller. 
Moving windows
To move a window, click anywhere in a window’s title bar (or anywhere in 
the metallic part of a display window, except on a button, menu, search field, 
scroll bar, or Resizer) and drag the window to wherever you want it. The 
window moves wherever you move the mouse, stopping dead in its tracks 
when you release the mouse button.

35
 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
Shuffling windows
I’ve already spent plenty of pages giving you the scoop on how to work with 
windows. But wait; there’s more . . . the commands on the Window menu provide 
tools you can use to manage your windows. (Refer to Figure 2-1.) Here is a brief 
look at each of the items on the Window menu (and if you’re unfamiliar with 
menus and keyboard shortcuts, I explain how they work later in this chapter):
 
✓ Minimize (Ô+M): Use this command to minimize the active Finder 
window to the Dock and unclutter your Desktop. It’s the same as clicking 
the yellow gumdrop button.
 
✓ Zoom: This command does the same thing as the green gumdrop button. 
If you’ve forgotten what the green gumdrop does already, just turn back 
a few pages to the “Anatomy of a Window” section and read it again.
 
✓ Cycle Through Windows (Ô+`): Each time you choose this command 
or use the keyboard shortcut for it, a different window becomes active. So if 
you have three windows — call ’em Window 1, Window 2, and Window 3 —
and you’re using Window 1, this command deactivates Window 1 and 
activates Window 2. If you choose it again, the command deactivates 
Window 2 and activates Window 3. Choose it one more time, and it 
deactivates Window 3 and reactivates Window 1.
 
 This command actually has been available in several earlier versions 
of Mac OS X, but only as a keyboard shortcut. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard 
marked the first time it appeared in a Finder menu.
 
✓ Bring All to Front: In Mac OS X Snow Leopard, windows from different 
applications interleave. For example, you can have a Finder window, 
a Microsoft Word window, an Adobe Photoshop window, another 
Microsoft Word window, and another Finder window in front-to-back 
order. Choosing Bring All to Front while the Finder is the active applica-
tion enables you to have both of the Finder windows in this example 
move in front of those belonging to Word and Photoshop.
 
 If you want to bring all the windows belonging to the Finder (or any 
other program, for that matter) to the front at the same time, you can 
also click the appropriate Dock icon (the Finder, in this case).
 
 If you hold down the Option key when you pull down the Window menu, 
Minimize Window changes to Minimize All, and the Zoom command 
changes to Zoom All. 
 
✓ Other items: The remaining items on the Window menu are the names of 
all currently open Finder windows. Click a window’s name to bring it to 
the front.

36
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
In addition to the commands on the Window menu, Mac OS X has a program 
called Exposé that lets you display all open windows (or all the windows 
open in the application you’re currently using) by rearranging the windows 
on-screen and graying out everything else. It can also hide all windows so 
you can see your desktop (what a concept).
By default, you use the function keys to choose the way Exposé displays your 
windows. Depending on the age of your Mac and keyboard, those shortcut 
keys are one or more of the following:
 
✓ To see all open windows, press F3, F9, or fn+F9.
 
✓ To see all open windows belonging to the current application, press 
Control+F3, F10, or fn+F10.
 
✓ To hide all open windows and display the Desktop, press Ô+F3, F11, or 
fn+F11.
 
✓ To summon forth the Dashboard (which displays your widgets, as I 
explain in Chapter 3), press F4, F12, or fn+F12.
A picture is worth a thousand words, so take a gander at Figure 2-6, where I 
have several applications running with multiple windows open in each of them.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Clockwise 
from top left: 
Exposé off;

fn+F10); the 
Desktop 
only (press 
Ô+F3, F11, 
or fn+F11). 
 

37
 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
Notice that when you’re using Exposé, windows appear at a reduced size. 
And below each little window is its title, making it easier to discern what that 
window contains. Click any of these small windows and Exposé deactivates 
and the window you clicked becomes the active window.
By the way, Exposé is enabled by default. You can disable it or change its key-
board shortcuts in the Exposé & Spaces System Preferences pane. Find out 
more about using and customizing Exposé (and Spaces, its sister application) 
in Chapter 3.
Menu Basics
Mac menus are often referred to as pull-down menus. To check out the Mac 
OS X menus, click the Finder button in the Dock to activate the Finder and 
then look at the top of your screen. From left to right, you see the Apple 
menu, the Finder menu, and six other menus. To use an OS X menu, click its 
name to make the menu appear, and then pull (drag) down to select a menu 
item. Piece of cake!
Ever since Mac OS 8, menus stay down after you click their names until you 
either select an item or click outside the menu’s boundaries.
The ever-changing menu bar
 
Before you start working with OS X menus, you really, really should know this 
about menus in general: They can change unexpectedly. Why? Well, the menus 
you see on the menu bar at the top of the screen always reflect the program 
that’s active at the time. When you switch from the Finder to a particular 
program — or from one program to another — the menus change immedi-
ately to match whatever you switched to.
For example, when the Finder is active, the menu bar looks like Figure 2-6, 
shown earlier. But if you launch the TextEdit application (discussed in 
Chapter 13), the menu bar changes to what you see in Figure 2-7.
An easy way to tell which program is active is to look at the application menu — 
it’s the leftmost menu with a name, just to the right of the Ú menu. When 
you’re in the Finder, of course, the application menu reads Finder. But if you 

38
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
switch to another program (by clicking its icon in the Dock or by clicking any 
window associated with the program) or launch a new program, that menu 
changes to the name of the active program.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Menu bars 
change to 
reflect the 
active 
application. 
 
When you have an application open, the commands on the menu change, 
too — but just a little bit. What makes this cool is that you have access to 
some standard application menu items whether you’re running Mail or Safari. 
You can find much more about commands for applications in Part III, which 
explains how applications that come with Mac OS Snow Leopard can help you 
get things you want to do done.
Contextual menus: They’re sooo sensitive
Contextual menus are, as the name implies, context-sensitive; they list com-
mands that apply only to the item that is currently selected. Contextual menus 
might be available in windows, on icons, and in most places on the Desktop.
To use them, you either hold down the Control key and click — which you 
can call a Control+click to sound cool to your Mac friends — or, if your mouse 
has two or more buttons, right-click.
Actions appear in contextual menus only if they make sense for the item that 
you Control+click or right-click. (That’s why people call ’em contextual! They 
stick to the immediate context.) Figure 2-8 shows the contextual menu that 
appears when you Control+click (or right-click) a document icon on the left 
and the contextual menu for the Desktop on the right.

39
 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
 
Figure 2-8: 
Only

items

menu.
 
Contextual menu

Contextual menu
for the Desktop
 
Contextual menus are also available in most applications. Open your favorite 
app and try Control+clicking to find out whether those menus are there. In 
most cases, using a contextual menu is a quick way to avoid going to the menu 
bar to choose a command. In some programs — such as AppleWorks 6, iMovie, 
iTunes, and many more — contextual menus are the only way to access certain 
commands.
To make the Finder-related contextual menus available to users who didn’t 
have the foresight to purchase this book, Apple added the Actions button 
to the toolbar. As a result, people who don’t know about Control+clicking or 
right-clicking (or have only one free hand) can access most contextual menus 
by clicking the Actions button and displaying its contextual menu. You, on 
the other hand, gentle reader, know how to get at these commands without 
having to run your mouse all the way up to the Action button in the toolbar. 
Plus, a handful of commands appear in the Control+click/right-click contex-
tual menu that don’t appear in the Actions button/menu. 
 
I’m a big fan of multibutton mice, and contextual menus are a huge reason 
for this preference. Thankfully, Apple now includes multibutton mice with all 
its desktop computers (except the Mac Mini, which doesn’t include a mouse, 
keyboard, or monitor). If you have an older Mac with a single-button mouse, 
you might want to replace that mouse with one that offers you at least two 
buttons. With a multibutton mouse, you need only one hand to access these 
beautiful little contextual menus.
 
Get in the habit of Control+clicking (or right-clicking if your mouse has more 
than one button) items on your screen. Before you know it, using contextual 
menus will become second nature to you.

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Recognizing disabled options
Menu items that appear in black on a menu are currently available. Menu 
items that aren’t currently available are grayed out, meaning that they’re dis-
abled for the time being. You can’t select a disabled menu item.
In Figure 2-9, the File menu on the left is pulled down while nothing is 
selected in the Finder; this is why many of the menu items are disabled (in 
gray). These items are disabled because an item (such as a window or icon) 
must be selected for you to use one of these menu items. For example, the 
Show Original command is grayed out because it works only if the selected 
item is an alias. On the right side of Figure 2-9, I selected a document before I 
pulled down the menu; notice that many of the formerly disabled commands 
are enabled when an icon is selected.

ment icon

items are

Navigating submenus
Some menu items have more menus attached to them, and these are called 
submenus — menus that are subordinate to a menu item. If a menu has a 
black triangle to the right of its name, it has a submenu.
To use a submenu, click a menu name once (to drop the menu down) and 
then slide your cursor down to any item with a black triangle. When the 
item is highlighted, move your mouse to the right just slightly. The submenu 
should pop out of the original menu’s item, as shown in Figure 2-10.

Underneath the Apple menu tree
On the far left side of the menu bar sits a little Ú, which, if you click it, actu-
ally displays a menu. No matter what application is active, the Ú menu is 
always available in the top-left corner of your menu bar.
From top to bottom, the Ú menu gives you a number of options, including 
the following:
 
✓ About This Mac: Choose this item to see what version of Mac OS X 
you’re running, what kind of Mac and processor you’re using, how much 
memory your Mac has, and the name of your Startup Disk. The window 
that appears also sports a Get Info button that will launch Apple System 
Profiler; there, you can find out more than you’ll probably ever want or 
need to know about your Mac’s hardware and software.
 
 If you click the version number in this window, it changes to the build 
number (Apple’s internal tracking number for versions). If you click the 
build number in this window, it changes to the serial number of your 
Mac. Finally, if you click the serial number of your Mac in this window, it 
changes to the version number again. This interesting effect is shown in 
Figure 2-11.

42
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ Software Update: If you’re connected to the Internet, choose this item 
to have your Mac check with the mothership (Apple) to see whether any 
updates are available for OS X or its included applications (or even for 
Apple-branded peripheral devices, such as the iPod or iPhone).
 
✓ System Preferences: Choose this item to open the System Preferences 
window (which I discuss further in Chapter 3 and elsewhere).
 
✓ Dock (submenu): This lets you mess with options for the Dock. Scour 
Chapter 4 for more info on the Dock.
 
✓ Recent Items: This lets you quickly access applications, documents, and 
servers you’ve used recently as shown in Figure 2-10.
 
✓ Shut Down options: The commands here can tell your Mac to Force 
Quit (Ô+Option+power button) when a program freezes or other-
wise becomes recalcitrant: Sleep, Restart, Shut Down, or Log Out. See 
Chapter 1 for details about turning off your Mac.

Using keyboard shortcut commands
Most menu items, or at least the most common ones, have keyboard shortcuts 
to help you quickly navigate your Mac without having to haggle so much with 
the mouse. Using these key combinations activates menu items without using 
the mouse; to use them, you press the Command (Ô) key and then press 
another key (or keys) without releasing the Ô key. Memorize the shortcuts 
that you use often.
 
Some people refer to the Command key as the Apple key. That’s because on 
many keyboards, that key has both the pretzel-like Command-key symbol (Ô) 
and an Apple logo (Ú) on it. To avoid confusion, I always refer to Ô as the 
Command key.

43
 Chapter 2: The Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My)!
Here are five things to know that will give you a handle on keyboard shortcuts:
 
✓ Keyboard shortcuts are shown in menus. For example, Figure 2-9 
shows that the keyboard shortcut for the Close Window command 
appears on the menu after the words Close Window: Ô+W. Any menu 
item with one of these pretzel-symbol+letter combinations after its name 
can be executed with that keyboard shortcut. Just hold down the Ô key 
and press the letter shown in the menu — N for New Finder Window, F 
for Find by Name (or just plain Find, depending upon whether an icon is 
selected when you execute the shortcut), and so on — and the appropri-
ate command executes.
 
✓ Capital letters don’t mean that you have to press Shift as part of the 
shortcut. Although the letters next to the Ô symbol in the Finder menus 
are indeed capitals, they just identify the letter on the keyboard. For 
example, if you see Ô+P, just hold down the Ô key and then press P. 
Some programs have keyboard combinations that require the use of Ô 
and the Shift key, but those programs tell you so by calling the key com-
bination something like $+Ô+S or $+Ô+O. 
 
 A very few (usually older) programs indicate when you need to use the 
Shift key by using the word Shift rather than the $ symbol.
 
✓ Recognize the funky-looking Option key symbol. You’ll see one other 
symbol sometimes used in keyboard shortcuts: It represents the Option 
key (sometimes abbreviated in keyboard shortcuts as Opt and, on some 
keyboards, also labeled Alt). Check it out next to the Hide Others com-
mand, shown in Figure 2-12.
 
 What this freakish symbol means in the Finder menu item (Hide Others 
in Figure 2-12) is that if you hold down both the Ô and Option keys as 
you press the H key, all applications other than the Finder will be hidden.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Some 
keyboard 
shortcuts, 
such as 
Hide Others, 
use the 
Option 
% key in 
combination 
with the 
Command 
(Ô) key.  

44
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ Okay, there was more than one more symbol. Occasionally, you’ll see a 
caret (^) used as the abbreviation for the Control key. For example, #+Ô 
on a menu means that you need to press Control+Ô+I.
 
✓ If it makes sense, it’s probably a shortcut. Most keyboard shortcuts 
have a mnemonic relationship with their names. For example, here are 
some of the most basic keyboard shortcuts:
Command
Mnemonic Keyboard Shortcut

Ô+N

More menus 4 U
If you like the menus you’ve seen so far, have 
I got a treat for you: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
includes 25 additional special-purpose menus, 
known as Menu Extras, that you can install if 
you like. Some — including Sound, Displays, 
Battery, and others — can be enabled from the 
appropriate System Preferences pane. But the 
easiest way is to open the Menu Extras folder 
(System/Library/CoreServices/
Menu Extras) and double-click each Menu 
Extra you want to install.
The following figure shows a handful of Menu 
Extras installed in the menu bar.
If you install a Menu Extra and later decide that 
you don’t need or want it in your menu bar, hold 
down the Ô key and drag it off the menu bar; it 
disappears with a satisfying poof.

E
veryone works a bit differently, and everyone likes to use the Mac in a par-
ticular way. In this chapter, you find out how to tweak various options so 
everything is just the way you like it. The first things most people like to do 
are set their background and screen saver and populate the Dashboard with 
handy widgets. You can begin with that stuff, but keep in mind that you can 
do much more.
You can change the colors in windows, the standard font, and more if you 
like. Your Mac lets you choose how on-screen elements behave and how your 
hardware — such as the keyboard, mouse, and any wireless Bluetooth 
gadgets — interacts with your Mac.
Introducing System Preferences
You should start by becoming familiar with System Preferences, which 
appear on the Apple (Ú) menu and in the Dock.

46
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
The following steps explain how to move around the System Preferences 
window, no matter what you’re trying to tweak:
 
1. Open the System Preferences window, shown in Figure 3-1.
 
 You can do this in three different ways:
 
• Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
 
• Open the System Preferences icon in your Applications folder.
 
• Click the System Preferences icon on your Dock.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The System 
Preferences 
window is 
where you 
change your 
on-screen 
world. 
 
 
2. Click any of the icons in the System Preferences window.
 
 The bottom part of the window changes to reflect the options for which-
ever icon you click. When this happens, I call the bottom part of the 
window a pane. So, for example, when you click the Appearance icon in 
the System Preferences window, the bottom part of the window becomes 
the Appearance System Preference pane.
 
3. When you finish working with a System Preference pane, click the 
Show All button to return to the window with icons for all available 
System Preference panes, or press Ô+L.
 
 Or, if you want to work with a different System Preference pane, you can 
choose it from the View menu, as shown in Figure 3-2. Also notice that 
you can navigate to the next or previous pane you’ve viewed with the 
Back and Forward buttons below the red and yellow gumdrops (short-
cuts Ô+[ and Ô+], respectively). Back and Forward commands also 
appear on the View menu.

47
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
You can get rid of the categories altogether and display the icons in 
alphabetical order. As a bonus, it makes the System Preferences window 
roughly 25 percentsmaller on-screen. To do so, choose View➪Organize 
Alphabetically. The categories disappear, the window shrinks, and the icons 
are alphabetized, as shown in Figure 3-2. To switch from alphabetical view 
back to category view, choose View➪Organize by Categories.
 
System Preferences is actually an application; you can find it in the 
Applications folder. The Ú menu item and Dock icon are merely shortcuts 
that open the System Preferences application. The actual files for preferences 
panes are stored in the Preference Panes folder, inside the Library folder in 
the System folder. If you choose to install third-party preference panes, they 
should go either in the Preference Panes folder in the Library folder at the 
top level of your startup disk (if you want them to be available to all users) or 
in the Preference Panes folder in the Library inside your Home folder (if you 
want to keep them to yourself).

Putting a Picture on the Desktop
Figure 3-3 shows my Desktop with a beautiful black-and-white background 
picture of lightning striking a distant city. (If you want a reminder of what the 
default Desktop background looks like, refer to Figure 3-2.)
 
Figure 3-3: 
My beau-
tified 
Desktop.
 
Here’s how you can change your Desktop picture if you care to:
 
1. From the Desktop, choose Ú➪System Preferences.
 
 Or Control+click or right-click the Desktop itself and choose Change Desktop 
Background from the contextual menu. Then you can skip to Step 3.
 
 The System Preferences window appears.
 
 
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
 
 The Desktop & Screen Saver Preferences pane appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-4.
 
3. Click a folder in the column on the left and then click a picture in the 
area on the right.
 
 I’m clicking a picture called Lightning in Figure 3-4, one of the items in 
the Black & White folder. If you want to show one of your own pictures 
on the Desktop, it’s probably in the Pictures folder.

49
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
 
Figure 3-4: 
Choosing 
a Desktop 
picture from 
the Black

folder.
 
 
You have at least three other ways to change your Desktop picture:
 
✓ Drag a picture file from the Finder onto the image well (the little 
rectangular picture to the left of the picture’s name).
 
✓ Choose the Pictures Folder in the list of folders on the left side of the 
Desktop & Screen Saver System Preference pane, and then choose a folder 
by using the standard Open File dialog. That folder then appears in the 
list; you can use any picture files it contains for your Desktop picture.
 
 If you don’t know how to choose a folder that way, see Chapter 5.
 
✓ Click one of the iPhoto Albums items in the column on the left side of 
the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preference pane.
One last thing before moving on: Although I love having a beautiful Desktop 
picture, from this point forward, I use a plain white Desktop (obtained by 
clicking Solid Colors in the list and then clicking the white color swatch). The 
plain Desktop will make it easier for you to see fine details.

50
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Setting Up a Screen Saver
Mac OS X comes with several screen-saver modules. To set up your screen 
saver, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open System Preferences, choose the Desktop & Screen Saver option, 
and click the Screen Saver tab to see the options shown in Figure 3-5.
 
2. In the Screen Savers column on the left side of the pane, choose a 
screen saver option that interests you.
 
3. (Optional) To see what the chosen module looks like in action, click 
the Test button. Press any key or click anywhere to end the test.
 
4. After you’ve chosen a screen saver, drag the Start Screen Saver slider 
to the number of minutes you want the Mac to wait before activating 
the screen saver.
 
 If you can’t decide, you can choose the Use Random Screen Saver check 
box to have your Mac choose a new screen saver at random each time 
the screen saver kicks in.
 
5. Choose the Show with Clock check box to display a digital clock along 
with the screen saver.
 
6. (Optional) Click the Hot Corners button to choose which corner of 
your screen activates the screen saver and which disables it.
 
 If you enable this option, when you move your cursor to the chosen 
corner, you activate or disable the screen saver until you move the 
cursor elsewhere.
 
 Note that hot corners are optional and are turned off by default.
 
7. When you’re done, close the Desktop & Screen Saver pane.
 
You can require a password to wake your Mac from sleep or a screen saver. To 
do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences➪Security.
 
2. Click the General tab at the top of the Preference pane.
 
3. Choose the Require Password after Sleep or Screen Saver Begins 
check box.
 
4. Choose a length of time from the drop down menu between the words 
“password” and “after,” which contains options such as immediately, 15 
minutes, and 4 hours.
 
 From now on, you must supply the user account password to wake 
up your computer. (User accounts and passwords are discussed in 
Chapter 15 and the Appendix.)

If you like Screen Savers/Effects, you can find plenty more available at your 
favorite downloadable software repository. (My favorite is www.version
tracker.com.) Many are free, but some cost a few bucks. Some of those, 
such as Marine Aquarium in Figure 3-6 (from www.serenescreen.com), are 
even worth paying for. I paid my $19.95, and it was worth every penny. It’s so 
lifelike that I sometimes believe those are real fish in my monitor. Plus, unlike 
other fish I’ve owned, these never float belly up (or explode from overfeeding). 
I love this saver/effect; it’s the only one I use anymore.

Putting Widgets on the Dashboard
 
 Dashboard offers a way-cool set of widgets, Apple’s name for the mini-
applications that live inside the Dashboard layer. You see, Dashboard takes 
over your screen when you invoke it (as shown in Figure 3-7) by clicking 
Dashboard’s Dock icon or pressing its keyboard shortcut: F4 on newer Mac 
keyboards, or F12 (or fn+F12) on almost any Mac keyboard. In Figure 3-7, 
Dashboard is shown with just a few of its default widgets: Calculator, 
Weather, World Clock, and Calendar.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Dashboard 
lives in its 
own gray 
overlay 
layer, 
floating 
above 
any open 
Finder or 
application 
windows.
 
Widgets are small, single-function applications that work only within Dashboard. 
Some widgets talk to applications on your hard drive, such as Address Book, 
iTunes, and iCal. Other widgets — such as Flight Tracker, Stocks, and Weather — 
gather information for you via the Internet.
The following tips can help you work with widgets:
 
✓ Each time you invoke Dashboard, widgets that were open the last time 
you used it will be on your screen.
 
✓ To close an open widget, click the encircled X in its upper-left corner. If 
you don’t see an X, press the Option key and move the cursor over the 
widget and you will.
 
✓ To configure most widgets: Move your cursor over the lower-right 
corner of a widget and click the little i-in-a-circle that appears (as it does 
with the Clock widget in Figure 3-7). The widget then flips around so 

53
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
you can see its backside where the configuration options reside. So, for 
example, the Clock widget allows you to choose your region and city 
and the Weather widget gives you choices that include your City, State, 
or Zip Code; Fahrenheit or Celsius; and whether to include lows in the 
six-day forecast (as shown in Figure 3-8). When you finish configuring a 
widget, click the Done button, which is usually (but not always) found in 
the lower-right corner; doing so flips the widget around again. 
 
 Not all widgets can be configured. For example, the Calendar and 
Calculator widgets have no options to configure. If a little i-in-a-circle 
doesn’t appear when you hover over the lower-right corner of a widget 
with your cursor, that widget has no options to configure. 
 
✓ To access widgets other than the four on your screen by default, click 
the Open button (the large encircled plus sign shown earlier in the 
lower-left corner of Figure 3-7) to open the Widget Bar, shown at the 
bottom of Figure 3-8.
 
 When the Widget Bar is open, every widget onscreen displays an encir-
cled X in its upper-left corner; click it to close the widget.
 
 Widget Bar sounds like a trendy watering hole downtown, but I assure 
you that’s the official, Apple-sanctioned name for this feature. Really.
 
✓ To open a widget window, click the widget. In Figure 3-8, the Translation 
widget is open in the middle of the screen, all set to do my bidding. Or 
you can click and drag a widget from the Widget Bar to a preferred loca-
tion on your screen.
 
✓ To see more widgets, click the tiny arrows on the left and right sides of 
the Widget Bar.
 
✓ To move a widget around on your screen, click almost anywhere on the 
widget and then drag it to the appropriate location.
 
✓ To close the Widget Bar, click the X-in-a-circle displayed on the left of 
the Manage Widgets button when the Widget Bar is open, as shown in 
Figure 3-8.

54
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ To manage your widgets, click the Manage Widgets button above the 
Widget Bar on the left side. The Widget Manager appears in the middle 
of the screen. In Figure 3-9, for example, I’ve disabled the Ski Report and 
Tile Game widgets, which I never use.
 
 You can manage widgets only if the Widget Bar is open.
 
 At the bottom of the Widget Manager window is a button titled More 
Widgets. Clicking it launches your Web browser and shows you addi-
tional widgets you can download from the Apple Web site.
 
✓ To uninstall a third-party widget that you no longer want, merely open 
the Widget Manager and click the red minus sign next to its name. Your Mac 
politely asks whether you want to move this widget to the trash. You do.
 
Figure 3-9:

with check 
marks

Bar; widgets

marks don’t.
 
 
Think of your Dashboard widgets as being handy-yet-potent miniprograms 
available at any time with a keystroke or click. Widgets are just so danged cool 
that I want to give you a quick look at a couple I consider particularly useful. 
Read on for details.
Translation
 
 The Translation widget could be a lifesaver. You’ve been able to do this trick 
on the Web for a while, but now you can do it right on your desktop. This 
widget translates words from one language to another. It offers more than a 
dozen language choices — including French, German, Spanish, Russian, 
Dutch, Chinese, and more — and can translate in either direction.

55
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
I love the Translation widget so much that sometimes it hurts.
 
It’s fun at parties, too. Try this: Type a paragraph or two of your purplest 
prose into Translation. Now translate back and forth to any language a few 
times. Howl when prose written as “It was a dark and stormy night when our 
heroine met her untimely demise” turns into something like “It was one night 
dark and stormy where our heroin met an ugly transfer.” It doesn’t get much 
better than this, folks. I used to leave my MacBook Pro at home if I wasn’t 
absolutely going to need it. But the Translation widget is so wicked cool and 
useful that lately I’ve been taking my MacBook Pro almost everywhere I go, 
whether I need it or not.
Flight Tracker
 
 Flight Tracker, shown in Figure 3-10, can find flights on most airlines and 
report the flight’s status in real time — a terrific timesaver when you have to 
meet a flight.
 
Figure 3-10: 
Finding a 
flight (top) 
and viewing 
its status 
(bottom) 
after 
clicking the 
Track Flight 
button.
 
When you have to meet someone’s flight, this widget can be a lifesaver. Just 
open Dashboard every few minutes, and you know exactly what the flight’s 
status is at that moment.
 
This is a really good tip for harried air travelers: You can open more than one 
instance of a widget. So if you’re trying to track two flights or want to know the 
weather in more than one city, just click the appropriate widget in the Widget 
Bar, and another instance of it appears.

56
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Business and People
  The Business and People widgets (shown in Figure 3-11) are like having white-
page and yellow-page directories at your fingertips. You can quickly find local 
(or not-local) phone numbers for businesses or people.
 
Figure 3-11: 
The 
Business 
(top) and 
People 
(bottom) 
widgets.
 
Some widgets, such as the Business widget, have drop-down menus denoted 
by a little triangle. See Figure 3-12 for an example.

Giving Buttons, Menus, and 
Windows a Makeover
 
 Computers don’t care about appearances, but if you want your Mac to look 
a bit more festive (or, for that matter, businesslike), you have options in the 
Appearance pane (see Figure 3-13) at your disposal. To open this pane, 
choose Ú➪System Preferences➪Appearance.

57
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
 
Figure 3-13: 
The 
Appearance 
System 
Preference 
pane. 
 
First up are the general appearance options:
 
✓ Appearance pop-up menu: Use this menu to choose different appear-
ances and change the overall look of buttons, such as the three gumdrop 
buttons in the upper-left corner of most windows, as well as the gum-
drop buttons that appear in scroll bars.
 
 Apple, however, in its infinite wisdom, provides only two choices: Blue 
and Graphite.
 
✓ Highlight Color pop-up menu: From here, you can choose the color that 
text becomes surrounded by when you choose it in a document or in an 
icon’s name in a Finder window. This time, Apple isn’t so restrictive: You 
have eight highlight colors you can choose, plus Other, which brings up 
a color picker from which you can choose almost any color.
The next area in the Appearance System Preference pane enables you to set 
the behavior of scroll bars and title bars:
 
✓ The Place Scroll Arrows radio buttons let you choose whether you 
have the default of both arrows together at the bottom and to the right 
of the scroll bars (left in Figure 3-14) or the old-school single arrow at 
either end of the scroll bar (right in Figure 3-14).
 
✓ The Click in the Scroll Bar To radio buttons give you the option of 
moving your view of a window up or down by a page (the default) or 
to the position in the document roughly proportionate to where you 
clicked in the scroll bar.

58
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
Figure 3-14: 
Scroll 
arrows 
together 
(left) or at 
top and 
bottom 
(right).
 
 
 Choose the Jump to the Spot That’s Clicked radio button if you often 
work with long (multipage) documents. It’s quite handy for navigating 
long documents. And don’t forget — the Page Down key does the same 
thing as choosing the Jump to the Next Page choice, so you lose nothing 
by choosing Jump to the Spot That’s Clicked.
 
✓ Selecting the Use Smooth Scrolling check box makes documents more 
legible while you scroll. Give it a try; if you think it’s making things feel 
sluggish, turn it off.
 
✓ The Minimize When Double-Clicking a Window Title Bar check box 
does just what it says when chosen — it shrinks a window to the Dock 
when you double-click its title bar. For what it’s worth, the yellow gum-
drop button does exactly the same thing.
 
The next area in the Appearance pane controls the Number of Recent Items 
that are remembered and displayed in your Ú➪Recent Items submenu. The 
default is 10, but I like having access to more than 10 applications and docu-
ments in my Recent Items submenu, so I crank mine up to the max — 50 of 
each. Here’s what each pop-up menu means:
 
✓ Applications: When you choose to display any number of applications, 
you can open any application you’ve used recently from your Recent 
Items submenu.
 
✓ Documents: This setting tells Snow Leopard to show specific documents 
you’ve opened recently in Recent Items.
 
✓ Servers: Determines the number of recently accessed remote computers 
Snow Leopard displays in the Recent Items submenu.
The last area offers a few options for how your fonts look. The LCD Font 
Smoothing check box makes text look better on most displays. Unless your 
monitor is an old tube-type (CRT) display you should probably check this box. 
The Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes x and Smaller pop-up menu 
(where x is the pop-up menu setting) does just what it says. Fonts that size 
and smaller are no longer anti-aliased (smoothed) when displayed.

59
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
 
If you find that type in small font sizes is hard for you to read, try increasing or 
decreasing this setting.
Spaced Out! Defining Screen Spaces
 
 Actually, the Spaces feature is anything but spacey. Both Spaces and Exposé 
help you manage Finder windows and Application windows by organizing 
them on-screen according to preferences you set in the Exposé & Spaces pref-
erences pane. Exposé has been around since Panther; Spaces was introduced 
in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. To access this pane, simply choose Ú➪System 
Preferences➪Exposé & Spaces.
Spaces lets you organize applications into groups and then switch from group 
to group with a single keystroke. When you use Spaces, only two kinds of win-
dows are shown: windows from applications associated with the active Space 
and windows from applications launched while that Space is active.
You set the preferences for Spaces on the Spaces tab of the Exposé & Spaces 
System Preference pane, shown in Figure 3-15. The following steps walk you 
through the setup and customization of Spaces:
 
1. Click the Spaces tab, shown in Figure 3-15, to begin setting up your 
Spaces.
 
2. Set up the number of spaces you want by clicking the circled + (plus) 
buttons next to the Rows and Columns labels.
 
 Clicking the + button once adds a row or column. In Figure 3-15 for exam-
ple, I have two rows and two columns, to create a total of four spaces on 
my screen. If I wanted more spaces, I’d click the + button to add another 
row or column, which would give me six spaces. 
 
3. In the Application Assignments area, assign applications to the Spaces 
you’ve set up by first choosing an Application name and then choosing 
the Space you want to assign it to from the pop-up menu on the right.
 
 In Figure 3-15, Space 1 is configured for iChat. Space 2 is configured for 
Mail. Space 4 is for Chess. And the Dictionary application will appear in 
all four spaces.
 
4. Use the pop-up menus at the bottom of the screen to choose how you 
want to activate and switch between your Spaces.
 
 The # symbol stands for the Control key.

60
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
Figure 3-15: 
Spaces

for four 
spaces.
 
 
5. When you’re done, simply close the Preference pane and begin work-
ing with your Spaces by using the keyboard shortcut you designated 
in Step 4.
 
 The settings are sticky until you return to this pane to change them.
You can navigate your spaces in the following ways:
 
✓ Use one of the “switch” keyboard shortcuts. With my settings in place, 
when I switch from one space to another using either of the “switch” 
keyboard shortcuts, the windows in the current space are hidden, and 
the windows in the space I’ve switched to appear. At the same time, a 
handy pop-up indicator appears on-screen (as shown in Figure 3-16) 
to tell me I switched from Space 4 (arrow) to Space 1 (all white). When 
I check the box to Show Spaces in menu bar (refer to Figure 3-15) a 
second indicator shows up in the menu bar, as shown in Figure 3-16. The 
indicators provide feedback on which Space is active:
 
• The larger on-screen pop-up indicator is four rectangles with an 
arrow.
 
• The second indicator is an item on the menu bar: four little 
squares with the number 1 in the middle.

61
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
 
Figure 3-16: 
On-screen 
pop-up 
indicators.
 
 
✓ Use the keyboard shortcut you chose to activate Spaces (F8 by 
default). Your screen displays all your spaces, as shown in Figure 3-17. 
Choose the one you want with either the mouse or the arrow keys, and 
then click or press Return or Enter to activate the chosen space.
 
 You can disable the keyboard commands completely by choosing the 
dash in the Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts area.
 
 The little windows you see in each quadrant of Figure 3-17 are “proxies” 
that represent the “real” windows that are open in each Space. So you 
can drag a proxy window from one Space to another in the Activate 
Spaces screen, or drag windows within the same Space. 
 
Figure 3-17: 
The Activate 
Spaces 
shortcut 
fills the 
screen with 
this display 
when you 
press F8. 
 

62
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
 Suppose, for example, that the iChat window is on the left side of your 
screen in Space 1 before you press F8. Then suppose you drag the little 
iChat proxy window (on the left side of the upper-left quadrant, which 
represents Space 1 in Figure 3-17) to the right side of the upper-left 
quadrant (that is, to the right side of Space 1). If you activate Space 1, 
you’ll see that the “real” iChat window has moved from the left side of 
the screen to the right. Pretty neat, eh?
 
✓ Configure the corners of your screen to activate and deactivate 
Exposé and Spaces features. You can choose one of the four Active 
Screen Corners pop-up menus on the Exposé tab of the Exposé & Spaces 
System Preference pane.
 
 For example, if you set the upper-left corner to Spaces (as shown in 
Figure 3-18), moving the cursor into the upper-left corner of your screen 
has the same effect as pressing the Activate Spaces shortcut: The result-
ing screen looks like Figure 3-17.
 
 Other features you can activate with corners include all four Exposé 
modes (discussed in Chapter 2) and Start or Disable Screen Saver 
(discussed earlier in this chapter).
 
Figure 3-18:

Spaces to 
activate 
when the 
cursor 
is in the 
upper-left 
corner of

You can also set other custom keyboard shortcuts on your Mac, but those 
work in a slightly different way. See “Creating Custom Keyboard Shortcuts” 
later in this chapter for details.

63
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
Spaces is particularly useful if you have a smaller display. It’s an acquired 
taste, so even if you have a small screen, you might hate it.
My advice: Try it for a while, and if you decide you hate it, turn it off and be 
done with it.
Adjusting the Keyboard, Mouse, 
Trackpad, and Other Hardware
No one uses the keyboard and mouse in the same way. Some folks don’t use 
a mouse at all. (You might not even use the keyboard much if you use voice-
recognition software or other devices, as I explain in Chapter 16.) If you’re 
using Mac OS X on a notebook, you might have a trackpad, that little surface 
where you move your finger around to control the cursor. Or perhaps you 
have a Bluetooth-enabled keyboard and mouse so you can hook them up to 
your Mac wirelessly.
Regardless of what you have, you should give some thought to customizing 
the way it works so it feels “just right” for you.
 
 The Keyboard, Mouse, and Trackpad System Preference panes offer several 
tabs to do just that — let you modify the behavior of your keyboard, mouse, 
and trackpad in a myriad of ways. So the first thing to do is open the 
Keyboard preferences pane by choosing Ú➪System Preferences➪Keyboard.
Keyboard
The Keyboard System Preference pane has two tabs: Keyboard and Keyboard 
Shortcuts. 
Keyboard tab
On the Keyboard tab, you can adjust your settings in the following ways:
 
✓ Drag the Key Repeat Rate slider to set how fast a key repeats when you 
hold it down. This feature comes into play when (for example) you hold 
down the hyphen (-) key to make a line or the asterisk (*) key to make a 
divider.
 
✓ Drag the Delay Until Repeat slider to set how long you have to hold 
down a key before it starts repeating.
 
 You can type in the box that says Type Here to Test Settings to test your 
settings before exiting this tab.

64
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
If you have a notebook Mac (such as a MacBook, MacBook Pro, PowerBook, 
or iBook), you also see one or more of these additional features:
 
✓ Use All F1, F2 Keys As Standard Function Keys: If this check box is 
selected, the F keys at the top of your keyboard control the active soft-
ware application. 
 
 To use the special hardware features printed on each F key (display 
brightness, screen mirroring, sound volume, mute, and so on) you have 
to press the Fn (Function) key before pressing the F key. If the check box 
is left deselected, you have to press the Fn key if you want to use the F 
keys with a software application. Got it? Good.
 
✓ Illuminate Keyboard in Low Light Conditions: This check box turns 
your laptop’s ambient keyboard lighting on and off.
 
✓ Turn Off When Computer Is Not Used For: This slide control lets you 
determine how long the ambient keyboard lighting remains on when 
your computer isn’t in use.
Of course, if your notebook computer doesn’t have ambient keyboard light-
ing, as many don’t, you don’t see the last two items.
 
Ambient keyboard lighting is a cool feature, but remember that it reduces 
battery life. My recommendation is to use it only when you really need it.
Keyboard Shortcuts tab
 
If you really hate to use your mouse or if your mouse is broken, keyboard 
shortcuts can be really handy. I tend to use them more on my laptop because 
I really don’t like using the built-in touch-mouse thing (technically it’s a track-
pad and I talk more about it in the next section).
I introduce the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts in Chapter 2. You 
probably don’t want to mess with those, but you can assign other commands 
you use often to just about any key combination you like. By creating your 
own keyboard shortcuts, you can have whatever commands you need — 
literally at your fingertips.
Not only can you add, delete, or change keyboard shortcuts for many operating-
system functions (such as taking a picture of the screen and using the keyboard 
to choose menu and Dock items), but you can also add, delete, or change key-
board shortcuts for your applications.

65
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
 
 To begin, choose the Keyboard Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard System 
Preference pane. Now you can do any or all of the following:
 
✓ To change a shortcut, first click the appropriate application, preference, 
or feature in the left column. Next, double-click the shortcut you want to 
change on the right side of the right column (for example, F3 or Ô+G). 
The old shortcut becomes highlighted; when it does, press the new 
shortcut keys you wish to use. 
 
✓ To add a new shortcut, click the + button. Choose the appropriate 
application from the Application pop-up menu, type the exact name 
of the menu command you want to add into the Menu Title field, and 
then press the shortcut you want to assign to that command into the 
Keyboard Shortcut field. If the shortcut you press is in use by another 
application or preference, a yellow triangular caution symbol appears 
next to it. It really is that simple. 
 
✓ To delete a shortcut, choose it and then click the — button.
The Keyboard Shortcuts tab also offers options for changing the Tab order. The 
Full Keyboard Access radio buttons control what happens when you press 
the Tab key in a window or dialog:
 
✓ If you choose the Text Boxes and Lists Only radio button, the Tab key 
moves the cursor from one text box to the next or from one list item to 
the next item (usually alphabetically).
 
✓ If you choose the All Controls radio button, you can avoid using the 
mouse for the most part, if that’s your preference.
 
 When All Controls is selected, the Tab key moves the focus from one 
item to the next in a window or dialog. So (for example) every time you 
press the Tab key in an Open File dialog, the focus moves — say, from the 
Sidebar to the file list to the Cancel button to the icon view button, and so 
on. Each item is highlighted to show it’s selected, and you can activate the 
highlighted item from the keyboard by pressing the spacebar.
 
 You can toggle this setting by pressing Control+F7. And if you don’t care 
for Control+F7 as its shortcut, you can change it by clicking Keyboard & 
Text Input in the left column, double-clicking the Change the Way Tab 
Moves Focus item in the right column, and then pressing the new short-
cut as shown in Figure 3-19.

Mouse
The Mouse System Preference pane is where you set your mouse speed and 
double-click delays.
 
If you use a notebook Mac, you won’t see a Mouse tab in the System Preference 
application unless you have a mouse connected via USB or Bluetooth. But if 
you use a notebook Mac, what you have is an additional System Preference 
pane called Trackpad, which I tell you about in a page or two. 
Moving right along, here are the features you’ll find in the Mouse System 
Preference pane (if you have a Mouse connected):
 
✓ Move the Tracking Speed slider to change the relationship between 
hand movement of the mouse and cursor movement on-screen. This 
slider works just like the slider for trackpads, as I explain in the upcom-
ing section on trackpads.
 
✓ The Double-Click Speed setting determines how close together two 
clicks must be for the Mac to interpret them as a double-click and not as 
two separate clicks. Move the slider arrow to the leftmost setting, Very 
Slow, for the slowest. The rightmost position, Fast, is the fastest setting, 
which I prefer.
 
✓ If your mouse has a scroll ball or scroll wheel, you also see a Scrolling 
Speed slider, which lets you adjust how fast the contents of a window 
scroll when you use the scroll wheel or ball.

67
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
 
✓ If your mouse has more than one button, you see a pair of Primary Mouse 
Button radio buttons. These let you choose which button — left or right — 
you use to make your primary (regular) click. Conversely, the other 
mouse button (the one you didn’t choose) becomes your secondary 
(Control or right) click.
 
 This is the setting many lefties like to change. Set the primary button as 
the right button, and you can click with the index finger on your left hand.
 
✓ Last but not least, the Zoom Using Scroll Wheel While Holding check 
box lets you zoom in and out by turning the scroll wheel or ball while 
holding down a particular key. The default is the Control key, so if you 
scroll while holding down the Control key, items on-screen get bigger 
or smaller. Click the arrow to the left of the Options button, to open the 
menu and choose a different modifier key.
 
 The Options button opens a sheet with options for how the screen 
image moves when you’re zoomed in, as well as a check box for smooth-
ing images. See Figure 3-20.
 
 If your Mac is more than a couple of years old, smoothing images might 
slow it down a bit. So if things feel a little sluggish when you zoom in, try 
clearing this check box.
Changes in the Mouse System Preference pane take place immediately, so you 
should definitely play around a little and see what settings feel best for you. 
You can test the effect of your changes to the Double-Click Speed setting in 
the Double-Click Here to Test text box just below the slider before you close 
this Preferences pane.

 Bluetooth is a technology that lets you make wireless connections between 
your Mac and devices such as Bluetooth mice and phones. You can see a 
Bluetooth tab in the Mouse System Preference pane if you’re using a 
Bluetooth mouse. Most Macs manufactured in the past few years have 
Bluetooth built in; some older models don’t.
 
You configure Bluetooth devices you wish to use with your Mac elsewhere in 
the Bluetooth System Preference pane (as described in Chapter 16).
If your Mac does, the Bluetooth tab shows you the battery level of your 
Bluetooth mouse or keyboard. It also offers a check box to add a Bluetooth 
status menu to your menu bar and a check box to let Bluetooth devices wake 
your computer from sleep.
Trackpad (notebook Macs only)
 
 If you use a notebook Mac — a MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro — 
you’ll have an additional System Preference pane called Trackpad. This pane 
lets you configure tracking and clicking speed as well as the gesturing behav-
ior of your Mac’s built-in trackpad.
Note that in 2008 Apple began equipping all its notebooks with a new and 
improved kind of trackpad called the, “Glass Multi-Touch Trackpad.” These 
features distinguish the new model from its predecessor: 
 
✓ It’s 40 percent larger than the original MacBook Pro and MacBook 
trackpads.
 
✓ It’s fabricated from some kind of high-tech glass. So it’s even smoother 
and more touch-friendly than the original trackpads.
 
✓ The whole trackpad is the click button — you just tap anywhere on it 
to click. 
 
✓ It supports multi-finger gestures that use up to four fingers at once.
 
If you have an older notebook with the older style of trackpad, you may not 
see all of the controls listed here:
 
✓ Move the Tracking Speed slider to change the relationship between 
finger movement on the trackpad and cursor movement on-screen. A 
faster tracking-speed setting (moving the slider to the right) sends your 
cursor flying across the screen with a mere flick of the finger; slower 
mouse-speed settings (moving the slider to the left) make the cursor 
crawl across in seemingly slow motion, even when your finger is flying. 

69
 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
Set this setting as fast as you can stand it — I like the fastest speed. Try 
it: You might like it.
 
✓ The Double-Click Speed slider determines how close together two 
clicks must be for the Mac to interpret them as a double-click and not as 
two separate clicks. Move the slider arrow to the leftmost setting (Slow) 
for the slowest. With this setting, you can double-click at a leisurely 
pace. The rightmost position (Fast) is the fastest setting, which I prefer. 
The middle area of the slider represents a double-click speed some-
where in the middle.
 
✓ The Scrolling Speed slider determines how quickly or slowly pages 
scroll when you drag two fingers up, down, left, or right on the trackpad.
 
✓ If you have a pre-Glass Multi-Touch Trackpad, you have the following 
check boxes available, as shown in Figure 3-21:
 
• Choose the Use Two Fingers to Scroll check box, and when you use 
two fingers right next to each other and drag up or down on the 
trackpad you’ll cause a window’s contents to scroll up or down 
(rather than moving the cursor, as would happen if you did this 
with a single finger). And the Allow Horizontal Scrolling check box 
just below it causes a window’s contents to scroll left or right when 
you drag two fingers left or right on the trackpad. 
 
• The Zoom While Holding check box lets you zoom in and out by hold-
ing down a specific key (the default is the Control key) and dragging 
two fingers on the trackpad. When you zoom in or out, items on-
screen get bigger or smaller. Click the arrow to the left of the Options 
button to open the menu and choose a different modifier key.

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
• If you choose the Clicking check box, you can tap your finger on the 
trackpad once to make your Mac recognize that gesture as a click. 
 
• Choose the Dragging check box to tap and drag on the trackpad 
without having to click the trackpad button. 
 
• Choose the Drag Lock (tap again to release) check box to keep an 
item selected after dragging until you tap the trackpad again.
 
✓ The Trackpad Options check boxes let you tell your laptop to ignore 
the trackpad while you’re typing or when a mouse is connected.
If you have one of the new Glass Multi-Touch Trackpads, your Trackpad 
System Preference pane offers a slightly different set of options for one-, two-, 
three-, and four-finger gestures (as shown in Figure 3-22) — slider controls 
(top), gesture controls (lower-left); and demonstration movies (lower-right). 
 
To see how a gesture works, just move your cursor over it (you don’t even 
have to click) and a movie will demonstrate that gesture on the right side of 
the window. In Figure 3-22 I’m pointing to the Two Fingers Rotate item on the 
left; the gesture and what it does are demonstrated in the movie playing on 
the right. Pretty cool, don’t you think?

 Chapter 3: Have It Your Way
Styling Your Sound
 
 Out of the box, Mac OS X Snow Leopard comes with a preset collection of 
beeps and controls. By using the Sound Preferences pane, however, you can 
change the way your Mac plays and records sound by changing settings on 
each of its three tabs: Sound Effects, Output, and Input.
Three items appear at the bottom of the Sound pane, no matter which of the 
three tabs is active:
 
✓ To make your Mac’s volume louder or softer, use the Output Volume 
slider. You can also change or mute the volume with the designated 
volume and mute keys found on most Apple keyboards.
 
✓ Choose the Mute check box to turn off all sound.
 
✓ Click the Show Volume in Menu Bar check box to add a volume control 
menu to your menu bar.
 
A shortcut to the Sound System Preference pane is to press Option while 
pressing any of the volume keys (usually the F4 and F5 keys on older laptops 
and keyboards or the F11 and F12 keys on newer laptops and keyboards).
Changing sound effects
On the Sound Effects tab, choose an alert (beep) sound by clicking its name; 
set its volume by using the Alert Volume slider control.
You can also specify the output device through which sound effects play (if 
you have more than one device) by choosing it from the Play Alerts and 
Sound Effects Through pop-up menu.
The Play User Interface Sound Effects check box turns on sound effects for 
actions, such as dragging a file to the Trash.
The Play Feedback When Volume is Changed check box tells your Mac to 
beep once for each keypress to increase or decrease volume.
The Play Front Row Sound Effects option tells your Mac to provide audio 
feedback when you use its Front Row feature (which you find out all about in 
Chapter 12). 

72
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Choosing output options
If you have more than one sound-output device (in addition to the built-
in speakers), you can choose it here. The Balance slider makes one 
stereo speaker — left or right — louder than the other.
Choosing input options
If you have more than one sound-input device (in addition to the built-in 
microphone on many Macs or an iSight camera, which contains its own mic), 
you can choose it here. The Input Volume slider controls the Input Level 
(how loud input from that device will be), which is displayed as a row of blue 
dots. If the dots light up all the way to the right side, your input volume is too 
loud. Ideally, the input level should light up with about three fourths of the 
little blue dots — and no more.

In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the Dock
▶ Discovering the default Dock icons
▶ Talkin’ Trash
▶ Delving into Dock customization
▶ Adjusting Dock preferences
T
ake a minute to look at the row of icons at the bottom of your display. 
That row, good friend, is the Dock (shown in Figure 4-1), and those 
individual pictures are known as icons (which I discuss in greater detail 
momentarily). 
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Dock 
and all its 
default 
icons.
 
 
Dock icons are odd ducks — you activate one with a single click. Most other 
icons are selected (highlighted) when you single-click and are opened when 
you double-click. So Dock icons are kind of like links on a Web page — you 
need only a single click to open them.
A Quick Introduction to Using the Dock
Single-click a Dock icon to open the item it represents:

74
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ If the item is an application, the application opens and becomes active. 
If the application is already open, it becomes active, which brings it and 
all its windows to the front. 
 
✓ If the item is a document, that document opens in its appropriate 
application, which becomes the active application. If that application is 
already open, it becomes the active application with this document in 
the front. 
 
✓ If the item is a folder icon, a menu with its contents appears and the 
Finder becomes the active application. If you select Show in Finder from 
this menu the folder’s window opens in the Finder.
 
If the item is open already when you click its Dock icon, it becomes active.
The default icons of the Dock
By default, the Dock contains a number of commonly used Mac OS X applica-
tions, and you can also store your own applications, files, or folders there. 
(I show you how to do that in the “Adding Dock icons” section later in this 
chapter.)
But first, look at the items you find in a standard Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
Dock. If they aren’t familiar to you, they certainly will be as you get to know 
Mac OS X.
I admit that I can’t do justice to all the programs that come with Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard that aren’t, strictly speaking, part of the operating system. 
Alas, some of the programs in the default Dock are ones you won’t be seeing 
much more of. But I’d hate to leave you wondering what all those icons in 
the Dock are, so Table 4-1 gives you a brief description of each default Dock 
icon (moving from left to right on-screen). If additional coverage of an item 
appears elsewhere in the book, the table tells you where.
 
To get a quick look at the name of a Dock icon, just move your cursor over 
any item in the Dock, and the item’s name appears above it (as shown in 
the middle of Figure 4-4, later in this chapter). And as I describe in the sec-
tion “Resizing the Dock” (also later in this chapter), you can resize the Dock 
to make the icons smaller (which also makes them more difficult to see). 
Hovering the cursor to discover the name of a teeny icon makes this feature 
even more useful.

get rid of them or drag 
removable discs onto it 
to eject them.
Chapter 4 (this 
chapter)
It’s likely your Dock won’t look exactly like the one shown in Figure 4-1. If you 
added icons to your Dock before you installed Snow Leopard, for example, 
you’ll see those icons. If you have any of the iLife apps (iMovie, iPhoto, 
GarageBand) installed you may see their icons in your Dock. And if you’ve 
ever deleted one of the icons shown in Figure 4-1 from your Dock, it won’t 
“come back” when you install Snow Leopard. 
 
If you don’t understand what I just said or you want to make your Dock look 
exactly like the one shown in Figure 4-1, I have good news — you find out how 
to do that by the end of this chapter. 

77
 Chapter 4: What’s Up, Dock?
Trash talkin’
 
 The Trash is a special container where you put the icons you no longer want 
to hang around on your hard drive(s). Got four copies of TextEdit on your 
hard drive? Drag three of them to the Trash. Tired of tripping over old letters 
that you don’t want to keep? Drag them to the Trash, too. To put something 
in the Trash, just drag its icon onto the Trash icon and watch it disappear. 
As with other icons, you know that you’ve connected with the Trash while 
dragging when the icon is highlighted. And as with other Dock icons, the 
Trash icon’s name appears when you move the cursor over the icon.
Two other ways to put items into the Trash is to select the items you want to 
dispose of — and then either choose File➪Move to Trash or press Ô+Delete.
 
If you accidentally drag something to the Trash and want it back right now, 
you can magically put it back where it came from — but only if you act quickly. 
Immediately after dragging the item(s) to the Trash, choose Edit➪Undo or 
press Ô+Z. Don’t hesitate — the Undo command is ephemeral and works only 
until you perform another action in the Finder. In other words, as soon as you 
do anything else in the Finder, you can no longer undo what you moved to the 
Trash.
You know how the garbage in the can on the street curb sits there until the 
sanitation engineers come by and pick it up each Thursday? The Mac OS 
X Trash works the same way, but without the smell. Items sit in the Trash 
waiting for you to empty it. The Trash basket shows you that it has files wait-
ing for you there . . . as in real life, your unemptied Trash is full of crumpled 
papers.
 
✓ To open the Trash and see what’s in there, just click its icon in the 
Dock. A Finder window called Trash opens, displaying any files it 
contains.
 
✓ To keep an item that’s already in the Trash, drag it back out, either 
onto the Desktop or back into the folder where it belongs.
 
✓ To empty the Trash, when you put something in the Trash, it sits there 
until you choose Finder➪Empty Trash or press shift+Ô+Delete.
 
 If the Trash window is open, you see an Empty button just below its tool-
bar on the right. Clicking the button, of course, also empties the Trash.
 
 You can also empty the Trash from the Dock by pressing the mouse 
button and holding it down on the Trash icon for a second or two, or 
right- or Control-clicking the Trash icon. The Empty Trash menu pops 
up like magic. Move your cursor over it to select it and then release the 
mouse button.

78
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
Think twice before you invoke the Empty Trash command. After you empty 
the Trash, the files that it contained are (usually) gone forever. My advice: 
Before you get too bold, read Chapter 17 and back up your hard drive several 
times. After you get proficient at backups, chances improve greatly that even 
though the files are technically gone forever from your hard drive, you can get 
them back if you really want to (at least in theory).
Opening application menus in the Dock
First of all, single clicking an application icon in the Dock launches that appli-
cation, or, if the application is already open, switches you to that application.
But application icons in the Dock — such as iCal, Safari, iTunes, and others — 
also hide menus containing some handy commands. (Folder icons in the 
Dock have a different but no less handy menu, which I discuss in a moment.)
You can make application Dock icons menus appear in two ways:
 
✓ Press and continue to hold down the mouse button.
 
✓ Right or Control+click. 
If an application isn’t running, you can use either way to display a menu like 
the one shown in Figure 4-2. 
 
Figure 4-2: 
The Options 
menu for an 
application 
icon in the 
Dock. 
 
Choosing Open launches the application; choosing Show in Finder will open 
the enclosing folder (Applications) and select the application’s icon; choos-
ing Remove from Dock removes that application’s icon from the Dock; and 
Open at Login launches this application automatically every time you log into 
this user account. If an application’s icon isn’t already in the Dock, you see 
Add to Dock rather than Remove from Dock. 
If an application is running, however, things are decidedly different. Clicking 
and holding an open application’s Dock icon does one thing while right or 
Control+clicking it does another. 

79
 Chapter 4: What’s Up, Dock?
If you click and hold the Dock icon of an application that’s already open, 
Exposé kicks in and displays all of that application’s open windows as 
described in Chapter 2 and shown in Figure 4-3.
Last but not least, if you right or Control+click an open application’s Dock 
icon you might see a menu like the ones shown in Figure 4-4.
Some applications, such as iTunes (on the left in Figure 4-4), offer program-
specific commands (Repeat Off, Repeat All, Shuffle, Play) on their Dock menu. 
Other applications offer fewer commands or no commands at all in their 
Dock menu, like TextEdit (on the right in Figure 4-4), which offers only the 
New Document command.
If the application has multiple windows, its Dock menu also includes a list 
of those windows (iTunes, The Who, Led Zeppelin for iTunes; Contract with 
D. Evil, Needful Thingies, The Shiny, and The Sit for TextEdit).

Reading Dock-icon body language
As you use the Dock or when you’re just doing regular stuff on your Mac, the 
Dock icons like to communicate with you. They can’t talk, so they have a few 
moves and symbols that indicate things you might want to know. Table 4-2 
clarifies what’s up with your Dock icons.
Table 4-2 
What Dock Icons Are Telling You
Icon Movement or Symbol
What It Means
The icon moves up and out of its place 
on the Dock for a moment, as shown in 
the middle of Figure 4-5.
You single-clicked a Dock icon, 
and it’s letting you know that you 
activated it.
The icon does a little bouncy dance 
when that program is open but isn’t 
active (that is, the menu bar isn’t show-
ing, and it isn’t the frontmost program).
The program desires your attention; 
give its icon a click to find out what it 
wants.
A glowing dot appears below its Dock 
icon, as shown on the right in Figure 4-5.
This application is open.
An icon that isn’t ordinarily in the Dock 
magically appears.
You see a temporary Dock icon for 
every program that’s currently open 
on the Dock until you quit that appli-
cation. The icon appears because 
you’ve opened something. When you 
quit, its icon magically disappears.

Opening files from the Dock
 
One useful function of the Dock is that you can use it easily to open icons. 
The following tips explain several handy ways to open what you need from 
the Dock:
 
✓ You can drag a document icon onto an application’s Dock icon. If the 
application knows how to handle that type of document, its Dock icon is 
highlighted, and the document opens in that application. If the applica-
tion can’t handle that particular type of document, the Dock icon isn’t 
highlighted, and you can’t drop the document on it.
 
 I’m getting ahead of myself here, but if the application can’t handle 
a document, try opening the document this way: Select the icon and 
choose File➪Open With, or Control+click the document icon and use the 
Open With menu to choose the application you want to open the docu-
ment with.
 
 If you hold down the Option key, the Open With command changes to 
Always Open With, which enables you to change the default application 
for this document permanently.
 
✓ You can find the original icon of any item you see in the Dock by 
choosing Show in Finder from its Dock menu. This trick opens the 
window containing the item’s actual icon and thoughtfully selects that 
icon for you.
Customizing the Dock
The Dock is a convenient way to get at oft-used icons. By default, the Dock 
comes stocked with icons that Apple thinks you’ll need most frequently 
(refer to Table 4-1), but you can customize it to contain any icons that you 
choose, as you discover in the following sections. You also find out how to 
resize the Dock to fit your new set of icons and how to tell Dock icons what 
your preferences are.

82
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Adding Dock icons
 
You can customize your Dock with favorite applications, a document you 
update daily, or maybe a folder containing your favorite recipes — use the 
Dock for anything you need quick access to.
Adding an application, file, or folder to the Dock is as easy as 1-2-3:
 
1. Open a Finder window that contains an application, a document file, 
or a folder you use frequently. 
 
 You can also drag an icon — including a hard disk icon — from the 
desktop.
 
2. Click the item you want to add to the Dock.
 
 As shown in Figure 4-6, I chose the TextEdit application. (It’s high-
lighted.) I use TextEdit constantly to type and edit quick text notes to 
myself and others, so having its icon in the Dock is very convenient 
for me.
 
3. Drag the icon out of the Finder window and onto the Dock.
 
 An icon for this item now appears in the Dock. Note that the dock item 
is not the actual item. That item remains wherever it was — in a window 
or on the desktop. The icon you see in the Dock is a shortcut to open 
the item. We haven’t talked about aliases (known as shortcuts in the 
Windows world) yet, but the icon in the Dock is actually an alias of the 
icon you dragged onto the Dock. 
 
 Furthermore, when you remove an icon from the Dock, as you find out 
how to do in a moment, you aren’t removing the actual application, 
document, or folder; you’re only removing its shortcut from the Dock.
 
 Folder, disk, and URL icons must be on the right side of the divider line 
in the Dock; Application icons must be on the left side of it. Why does 
the Dock force these rules upon you? I suppose someone at Apple thinks 
this is what’s best for you — who knows? But that’s the rule: apps on the 
left; folders, disks, and URLs on the right.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Adding an 
icon to the 
Dock is as 
easy as 
1–2–3. Just 
drag the 
icon onto 
the Dock.
 

83
 Chapter 4: What’s Up, Dock?
 
You can add several items to the Dock at the same time by selecting them all 
and dragging the group to the Dock. However, you can delete only one icon at 
a time from the Dock.
Adding a URL to the Dock works slightly differently. Here’s a quick way to add 
a URL to the Dock:
 
1. Open Safari and go to the page with a URL that you want to save on 
the Dock.
 
2. Click the small icon that you find to the left of the URL in the address 
bar and drag it to the right side of the dividing line in the Dock.
 
3. Release the mouse button when the icon is right where you want it.
 
 The icons in the Dock slide over and make room for your URL, as shown 
in Figure 4-7. From now on, when you click the URL icon that you moved 
to your Dock, Safari opens to that page.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Drag the 
icon from 
the address 
bar (top) 
to the right 
side of 
the Dock 
(middle). 
The URL 
appears as 
a Dock icon 
(bottom).
 
 
If you open an icon that normally doesn’t appear in the Dock and you want to 
keep its temporary icon in the Dock permanently, you have two ways to tell it 
to stick around after you quit the program:
 
✓ Control+click (or click and hold) and then choose Keep in Dock from the 
menu that pops up.
 
✓ Drag the icon (for an application that’s currently open) off and then back 
to the Dock (or to a different position in the Dock) without letting go of 
the mouse button.

84
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Removing an icon from the Dock
Removing an item from the Dock is as easy as 1-2 (there is no 3): Just drag its 
icon out of the Dock, and it disappears with a cool poof animation, as shown 
in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8: 
To remove 
an icon, 
drag it off 
the Dock, 
and poof — 
it’s gone.
 
Choosing Remove from Dock from the item’s Dock menu is another way to 
make the item go away. 
 
You can’t remove the icon of a program that’s running from the Dock until 
you quit that program. Also, note that by moving an icon out of the Dock, you 
aren’t moving, deleting, or copying the item itself — you’re just removing its 
icon from the Dock. The item is unchanged. The icon is sort of like a library 
catalog card: Just because you remove the card from the card catalog doesn’t 
mean that the book is gone from the library.
Resizing the Dock
If the default size of the Dock bugs you, you can make the Dock smaller and 
save yourself a lot of screen real estate. This space comes in especially handy 
when you add your own stuff to the Dock.
To shrink or enlarge the Dock (and its icons) without opening the Dock 
Preferences window, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Make the Sizer appear (as shown in the left margin) by moving your 
cursor over the dotted line that you find on the right side of the Dock.
 
2. Drag the Sizer down to make the Dock smaller, holding down the 
mouse button until you find the size you like.
 
 The more you drag this control down, the smaller the Dock gets.
 
3. To enlarge the Dock again, just drag the Sizer back up.
 
 Bam! Big Dock! You can enlarge the Dock until it fills your screen from 
side to side.

85
 Chapter 4: What’s Up, Dock?
What should you put in YOUR Dock?
Put things in the Dock that you need quick access to and that you use often, 
or add items that aren’t quickly available from menus or the sidebar. If you 
like using the Dock better than the Finder window sidebar (for example), add 
your Documents, Movies, Pictures, Music, or even your Home folder or hard 
drive to the Dock.
I suggest adding these items to your Dock:
 
✓ A word-processing application: Most people use word-processing soft-
ware more than any other application.
 
✓ A project folder: You know — the folder that contains all the documents 
for your thesis, or all the notes for the biggest project you have at work, 
or your massive recipe collection . . . whatever. If you add that folder to 
the Dock, you can access it much quicker than if you have to open sev-
eral folders to find it.
 
 If you click a folder icon, a handy fanned menu of its contents appears, 
as shown in Figure 4-9. Better still, the same goes for disk icons. Figure 
4-9 shows my Documents folder as a fanned menu. Give this trick a try — 
it’s great.
 
✓ A special utility or application: The Preview application is an essential 
part of my work because I receive a lot of different image files every 
day. You might also want to add programs (such as AOL), your favorite 
graphics application (such as Photoshop Elements), or the game you 
play every afternoon when you think the boss isn’t watching.
 
✓ Your favorite URLs: Save links to sites that you visit every day — the 
ones you use in your job, your favorite Mac news sites, or your per-
sonalized page from an Internet service provider (ISP). Sure, you can 
make one of these pages your browser’s start page or bookmark it, but 
the Dock lets you add one or more additional URLs. (See “Adding Dock 
icons” earlier in this chapter for details.)
 
 You can add several URL icons to the Dock, but bear in mind that the 
Dock and its icons shrink to accommodate added icons, which makes 
them harder to see. Perhaps the best idea — if you want easy access to 
several URLs — is to create a folder full of URLs and put that folder on 
the Dock. Then you can just press and hold your cursor on the folder (or 
Control+click the folder) to pop up a menu with all your URLs.
 
Even though you can make the Dock smaller, you’re still limited to one row of 
icons. The smaller you make the Dock, the larger the crowd of icons you can 
amass. You have to determine for yourself what’s best for you: having lots of 
icons available in the Dock (even though they might be difficult to see because 
they’re so tiny) or having less clutter but fewer icons in your Dock.

After you figure out which programs you use and don’t use, it’s a good idea to

 Chapter 4: What’s Up, Dock?
Setting your Dock preferences
You can change a few things about the Dock to make it look and behave just 
the way you want it to. First I look at global preferences that apply to the 
Dock itself. After that I look at some preferences that apply only to folder and 
disk icons in the Dock. 
Global Dock preferences
To change global Dock preferences choose Ú➪Dock➪Dock Preferences. The 
System Preferences application opens, showing an active Dock pane (see 
Figure 4-10).
 
Figure 4-10: 
The Dock 
menu and 
the Dock 
System 
Preference 
pane.
 
 
You can also open the Dock Preferences by right-clicking or Control+clicking 
the Dock Resizer and choosing Dock Preferences from the contextual menu.
Now you can adjust your Dock with the following preferences:
 
✓ Size: Note the slider bar here. Move this slider to the right (larger) or 
left (smaller) to adjust the size of the Dock in your Finder. As you move 
the slider, watch the Dock change size. (Now there’s a fun way to spend a 
Saturday afternoon!)
 
 As you add items to the Dock, each icon — and the Dock itself — shrinks 
to accommodate the new ones.

88
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ Magnification: This slider controls how big icons grow when you pass 
the arrow cursor over them. Or you can deselect this check box to turn 
off magnification entirely.
 
✓ Position on Screen: Choose from these three radio buttons to attach the 
Dock to the left side, the right side, or the bottom of your screen (the 
default). Personally, I prefer it on the bottom, but you should probably 
try all three before you decide.
 
✓ Minimize Windows into Application Icon: If you select this option, 
when you minimize a window by clicking its yellow gumdrop button, you 
won’t see a Dock icon for that window.
 
 If this option is not selected, each window you minimize gets its own 
personal icon on the right side of your Dock. 
 
✓ Animate Opening Applications: Mac OS X animates (bounces) Dock 
icons when you click them to open an item. If you don’t like the anima-
tion, deselect (that is, uncheck) this check box, and the bouncing ceases 
evermore.
 
✓ Minimize Windows Using: From this handy pop-up menu (PC users 
would call it a drop-down list, but what the heck; there’s no gravity in 
a computer screen anyway), choose the animation that you see when 
you click a window’s Minimize button (the yellow gumdrop). The Genie 
Effect is the default, but the Scale Effect seems a bit faster to me.
 
 Want to amaze your friends? Surreptitiously hold down the Shift key 
when you click the Minimize button or the Dock icon of a minimized 
window to make the animation effect play in super slow motion. 
 
✓ Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: Don’t like the Dock? Maybe 
you want to free up the screen real estate on your monitor? Then choose 
the Automatically Hide and Show the Dock check box; after that, the 
Dock displays itself only when you move the cursor to the bottom of the 
screen where the Dock would ordinarily appear. It’s like magic! (Okay, it’s 
like Windows that way, but I hate to admit it.)
If the Dock isn’t visible, deselect the Automatically Hide and Show the Dock 
check box to bring back the Dock. The option remains turned off unless 
you change it by checking the Automatically Hide and Show the Dock 
check box, choose Ú➪Dock➪Turn Hiding On (or use its keyboard shortcut 
Ô+Option+D).

89
 Chapter 4: What’s Up, Dock?
 
The keyboard shortcut Ô+Option+D is a toggle, so it reverses the state of this 
option each time you use it.
Preferences for folder and disk icons in the Dock
There are separate preferences for folder and disk icons in the Dock. To see 
them, right- or Control-click a folder or disk icon in your Dock. A menu like 
the one shown in Figure 4-11 appears.
The available options are: 
 
✓ Sort by, which determines the order items in the folder or disk are dis-
played when you click its Dock icon.
 
✓ Display as determines what the Dock icon looks like. If you choose Stack as 
I have for the Documents icon in Figure 4-11, the icon takes on the appear-
ance of an item in the folder or disk (an RTF document in Figure 4-11); if you 
choose Folder, the Dock icon looks like a folder, as does the icon to the right 
of the Documents icon in Figure 4-11.
 
✓ View content as lets you choose to display the contents of the folder 
or disk as a Fan (as shown in Figure 4-9), a Grid or a List (as shown in 
Figure 4-12). If you choose Automatic the Dock automatically chooses 
the best view — Fan, Grid, or List — based on the number of items in the 
folder.

ences menu

and as a List 
(right). 
 
 
I love the List view because it is the only one that offers submenus as shown 
for the Fiction folder in Figure 4-12. 
 
✓ Remove from Dock removes the icon from the Dock.
 
✓ Show in Finder opens the window containing the item and selects the 
item. So, for example, in Figures 4-11 and 4-12, my Home folder would 
open and the Documents folder inside it would be selected.

O
n your Mac, the Finder is your starting point — the centerpiece of your 
Mac experience, if you will — and it’s always available. In Finder win-
dows (or the Finder’s Desktop), you can double-click your way to your favor-
ite application, your documents, or your folders. So, in this chapter, I show 
you how to get the most from the Mac OS X Finder.
Introducing the Finder and Your Desktop
A Finder window is a handy friend. Use the Finder to navigate through files, 
folders, and applications on your hard drive — or to connect to other Macs 
and Internet servers — right from your Desktop.
Figure 5-1 shows a typical Finder window with all the standard features high-
lighted. You find out the details about how each feature works in the sections 
that follow.
The Desktop is the backdrop for the Finder. It’s always available and is where 
you can usually find your hard drive icon(s).

92
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Your hard drive (and other disk) icons appear in the upper-right corner of the 
Desktop by default. In “Setting Finder preferences” later in this chapter, you 
find out how to make them not appear there if you so desire — but unless you 
have a good reason to do so, my advice is to leave them showing so you can 
always find them on the Desktop if you need them. If you don’t see a disk icon 
on your Desktop, skip ahead in this chapter to the section “Setting Finder 
preferences,” where you choose whether to see disks on your Desktop.
 
At the bottom of the Finder window are two optional bars. The status bar tells 
you how many items are in each window and, if any are selected, how many 
you’ve selected out of the total, and how much space is available on the hard 
drive containing this window. And just above the status bar is the Path bar, 
which shows the path from the top level of your hard drive to the selected 
folder (which is BobLeV in Figure 5-1). You can show or hide the status bar 
by choosing View➪Hide/Show Status Bar, and show or hide the Path bar by 
choosing View➪Hide/Show Path Bar.

 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
If you’re not familiar with the Desktop, here are a few tips that will come in 
handy as you become familiar with the icons that hang out there:
 
✓ Icons on the Desktop behave the same as icons in a window. You move 
them and copy them just as you would icons in a window. The only 
difference is that icons on the Desktop aren’t in a window. Because 
they’re on the Desktop, they’re more convenient to use.
 
✓ The first icon you should get to know is the icon for your hard drive 
(see Figure 5-2). You can usually find it on the upper-right side of the 
desktop. Look for the name Macintosh HD or something like that, unless 
you’ve already renamed it. (I renamed my hard drive SnowLeopardHD in 
Figure 5-2; see the section on renaming icons in Chapter 6 if you’d like to 
rename your own hard drive.) You can see how selected and deselected 
hard-drive icons look in Figure 5-2, too.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Selected 
and 
deselected 
hard-drive 
icons. 
Unselected icon

✓ Other disc or hard drive icons appear on the Desktop by default. 
When you insert a CD or DVD or connect an external hard drive, the disc 
or drive icon appears on the Desktop just below your startup hard-drive 
icon (space permitting).You can find details about working with discs 
and drives in Chapter 7.
 
 If you don’t see your hard disk icon on the Desktop, make sure the 
checkbox for hard disks is checked in Finder Preferences as described in 
the “Setting Finder preferences” section later in this chapter.
 
✓ You can move an item to the Desktop so you can find it right away. 
Simply click its icon in any window and then, without releasing the 
mouse button, drag it out of the window and onto the Desktop. Then 
release the mouse button.

94
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Getting to Know the Finder Menu
One of the first features you notice in the Finder is its menu, which is packed 
with useful goodies. Here are a few of the main items you can find on the 
Finder menu:
 
✓ About Finder: Choose this command to find out which version of the 
Finder is running on your Mac.
 
 Okay, so this menu item isn’t particularly useful — or at least not for 
very long. But when a different application is running, the About Finder 
item becomes About application name and usually gives information 
about the program’s version number, the developers (the company and 
the people), and any other tidbits that those developers decide to throw 
in. Sometimes these tidbits are useful, sometimes they’re interesting, 
and sometimes they’re both.
 
✓ Preferences: Use the choices here to control how the Desktop looks 
and acts. Find out the details in “Setting Finder preferences” later in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Services: One of the really cool features of Mac OS X applications is the 
accessibility of Services. You can send a file to someone via e-mail, spell-
check a document or selection (even if the program you’re using didn’t 
come with a spell-checker), start a Google search instantly, and more, as 
shown in Figure 5-3.
 
 The items in the Services menu are context-sensitive, so what you see 
when in yours depends entirely on what is selected when you look. In 
Figure 5-3, I’ve selected the word “week,” so the available Services are 
ones that apply to a text selection. If I had selected the RTF text docu-
ment icon I would have seen different Services. And if I had selected a 
JPEG photograph document icon, my choices would be entirely different. 
The true home of your Desktop icons
If you’re curious about the inner workings of your 
Mac, you might find it interesting to check out 
the Desktop folder in your Home directory (that 
is, the Home folder). Just click the Home icon in 
any Finder window’s Sidebar (or press $+Ô+H 
to open a window displaying Home), and you 
see a folder named Desktop, which contains the 
same icons you place on the Desktop (but not 
the hard-drive icons). The reason for this folder 
is that each user has an individual Desktop. You 
find out much more about Home, users, and all 
that jazz in the upcoming chapters.

95
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
The point is that if you look in the Services menu and don’t find anything 
interesting, try selecting something else and looking again; you might be 
pleasantly surprised. 
 
 Choose the last item in the menu, Services Preferences, and you can 
enable dozens of useful Services that aren’t available by default. 
 
 Unfortunately, many applications still don’t support Services.
 
 
✓ Hide Finder (Ô+H): Use this command when you have Finder windows 
open and they’re distracting you. Choosing it makes the Finder inactive 
(another program becomes active) and hides any open Finder windows. 
To make the Finder visible again, either choose Show All from the 
Application menu (which will bear the name of the active application 
such as TextEdit, System Preferences, and so on) or click the Finder 
icon, shown in the margin here, in the Dock.
 
 The advantage to hiding the Finder — rather than closing or minimizing 
all your windows to get a clean screen — is that you don’t have to open 
them all again when you’re ready to get the windows back. Instead, just 
choose Show All or click the Finder button in the Dock.
 
✓ Hide Others (Option+Ô+H): This command hides all windows associ-
ated with all running programs except the active program. It appears in 
most applications’ Application menus, and is good for hiding distrac-
tions so you can focus on one thing — the unhidden application.
 
 Another easy way to hide all open applications and windows while acti-
vating the Finder is to hold down the Ô and Option keys and click the 
Finder button in the Dock. This technique works with whatever applica-
tion is active, not just the Finder. So if you’re surfing the Web and decide 
you want to see only Safari’s windows on your screen, Ô+Option+click 
the Safari button in the Dock, and it will happen instantly.

96
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ Show All: Use this command as the antidote to both of the Hide 
commands. Choose this, and nothing is hidden anymore.
 
 You can achieve much of the same effect as all this hide-and-show jazz 
by using Exposé, described in Chapter 2, and/or Spaces, discussed in 
Chapter 3. And the Finder menu’s Empty Trash command isn’t mentioned 
here (it’s mentioned briefly in Chapter 4 and gets detailed coverage in 
Chapter 6). 
Navigating the Finder: Up, 
Down, and Backward
In addition to the Sidebar (mentioned in Chapter 2) and some good, old-
fashioned double-clicking, the Mac OS X Finder window offers navigation 
aids. Several of these are on the toolbar — namely, the Back and Forward 
buttons, as well as the extra-helpful view buttons. You can find other handy 
features on the Go menu. The following sections explain how each one works.
Belly up to the toolbar
Right below the title bar, you find the Finder window’s toolbar (refer to 
Figure 5-1). On it are tools and buttons that let you navigate quickly and act 
on selected icons. To activate a toolbar button, click it once.
 
You say you don’t want to see the toolbar at the top of the window? Okay! 
Just choose View➪Hide Toolbar or click the little gray jellybean thing in the 
upper-right corner of every Finder window, and it’s gone. (If only life were 
always so easy!)
 
Alas, hiding the toolbar also hides the useful Sidebar and status bar. If only 
you could choose to hide them independently. . . . I find this fact annoying 
because I use the Sidebar a lot but don’t use the toolbar nearly as often. 
To make matters worse, Snow Leopard has a new menu item — View➪
Hide Sidebar (shortcut: Ô+Option+S) — that lets you hide the Sidebar 
without hiding the toolbar. For some unfathomable reason you can’t do 
the opposite and hide the toolbar while keeping the Sidebar and status 
bar visible! No, instead, if you choose View➪Hide Toolbar (shortcut 
Ô+Option+T) or click the gray jellybean, the Sidebar and status bar disap-
pear along with the toolbar. Boo. Hiss. 
 
When the toolbar is hidden, opening a folder opens a new Finder window 
rather than reusing the current one (which is what happens when the toolbar 
is showing unless you’ve changed this preference in Finder preferences or are 
using Column view).

97
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
If you’ve customized your toolbar by choosing View➪Customize Toolbar, it 
won’t look exactly like this. But here’s the lowdown on the toolbar’s default 
buttons, from left to right:
 
✓ Forward and Back buttons: Clicking the Forward and Back buttons dis-
plays the folders that you’ve viewed in this window in sequential order. 
If you’ve used a Web browser, it’s a lot like that.
 
 Here’s an example of how the Back button works. Say you’re in your 
Home folder; you click the Favorites button, and a split-second later 
you realize that you actually need something in the Home folder. Just a 
quick click of the Back button and — poof! — you’re back Home. As for 
the Forward button, well, it moves you in the opposite direction, through 
folders that you’ve visited in this window. Play around with them both — 
you’ll find them invaluable.
 
 The keyboard shortcuts Ô+[ for Back and Ô+] for Forward are more 
useful (in my opinion) than using the buttons.
 
✓ View buttons: The four view buttons change the way that the window 
displays its contents. Stay tuned for an entire section on views coming 
up in just a few pages.
 
 You have four ways to view a window: Column, Icon, List, and Cover 
Flow. Some people like columns, some like icons, and others love lists 
or flows. To each her own. Play with the four Finder views to see which 
one works best for you. For what it’s worth, I usually prefer Column 
view with a dash of List view thrown in when I need a folder’s contents 
sorted by creation date or size. And the new Cover Flow view is great for 
folders with documents because you can see the contents of many docu-
ment types right in the window, as I explain shortly.
 
 Don’t forget that each view also has a handy keyboard shortcut: Ô+1 for 
Icon view, Ô+2 for List view, Ô+3 for Column view, and Ô+4 for Cover 
Flow view.
 
 The following sections give you a peek at each view and explain how it 
works.
 
✓ Action: Click this button to see a pop-up menu of all the context-sensitive 
actions you can perform on selected icons, as shown in Figure 5-4.
 
✓ Search: The toolbar’s Search box is a nifty way to search for files or 
folders. Just type a word (or even just a few letters), and after a few sec-
onds, the window fills with a list of files that match.
 
 You can also start a search by choosing File➪Find (shortcut: Ô+F). 
 
 Keep these points in mind when you perform a search:
 
• You have a choice of where to search. This Mac is selected in 
Figure 5-5.

Figure 5-4:

menu.
 
 
• You can choose additional search criteria — such as the kind of 
file (PDF in Figure 5-5) and the last date the file was opened (within 
last 60 days in Figure 5-5) — as well as other attributes, including 
modification date, creation date, keywords, label, file contents, and 
file size.
 
• To add another criterion, simply click the + button on the right 
side of the window.
 
• To save a search for reuse in the future, click the Save button on 
the right side of the window.
 
 You can find out about searching for files in more detail in Chapter 6.

 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
Moving through folders 
fast in Column view
 
Column view is a darn handy way to quickly look through a lot of folders at 
once, and it’s especially useful when those folders are filled with graphics files. 
The Column view is my favorite way to display windows in the Finder.
 
 To display a window in Column view, shown in Figure 5-6, click the Column 
view button on the toolbar (as shown in the margin), and then choose 
View➪As Columns from the Finder’s menu bar or press Ô+3.
 
Figure 5-6: 
A Finder 
window 
in Column 
view.
 
Here’s how I clicked around in Column view to see the list of folders and files 
you see in Figure 5-6:
 
1. When I click the SnowLeopardHD icon in the Sidebar, its contents appear 
in the column to the right.
 
2. When I click the Applications folder in this column, its contents appear 
in the second column.
 
3. When I click the Utilities folder in the second column, its contents 
appear in the third column.
 
4. When I click the My Utilities folder in the third column, its contents 
appear in the fourth column.
 
5. Finally, when I click the Layers icon in the fourth column, a big icon 
appears, along with some information about this file (it’s an application, 
6.1 MB in size, created on 2/3/09, and so on). That’s the Preview column.

100
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
When you’re poking around your Mac in Column view, the following tips are 
good to know:
 
✓ You can have as many columns in a Column view window as your 
screen can handle. Just use the window Sizer (also known as the Resize 
control) in the lower-right corner to enlarge your window horizontally 
so new columns have room to open. Or click the green Zoom (also 
known as Maximize) gumdrop button to expand the window to “just big 
enough” to display all columns with content in them.
 
✓ You can use the little grabber handles at the bottom of every column 
to resize the column widths. They’re pretty versatile:
 
• If you drag a handle left or right, the column to its left resizes.
 
• If you hold down the Option key when you drag, all the columns 
resize at the same time. 
 
• If you double-click one of these little handles, the column to its left 
expands to the width of the widest item it contains. 
 
• If you Option+double-click any handle, all the columns expand at 
the same time to the width of the widest item each one contains.
 
✓ The preview column displays information about the highlighted item 
to its left, but only if that item isn’t a folder or disk. (If it is a folder or 
disk, its contents would be in this column.) For most items, the picture 
is an enlarged view of the file’s icon, as shown earlier in Figure 5-6. But if 
that item is a graphic file (even a PDF) saved in a format that QuickTime 
can interpret (most graphic file formats), a preview picture appears 
instead, as shown in Figure 5-7. If you don’t like having the preview dis-
played, you can choose View➪Show View Options and turn off Show 
Preview Column.
 
Figure 5-7: 
The preview 
of a graphic 
file is a

its contents 
rather than 
its icon.
 

101
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
Perusing in Icon view
Icon view is a free-form view that allows you to move your icons around 
within a window to your heart’s content. Check out the Finder window shown 
in Figure 5-1, earlier in this chapter, to see what Icon view looks like.
 
 To display a window in Icon view, click the Icon view button in the toolbar 
(shown in the margin), choose View➪As Icons from the Finder’s menu bar, or 
press Ô+1.
 
Snow Leopard introduces a new feature to Icon view, the Icon Size control. 
You’ll find it in the lower-right corner of Icon view windows, or in the top-right 
corner if the Sidebar and Toolbar have been hidden by clicking the gray gum-
drop button in the top right corner. 
The Finder’s View menu also offers a few commands that might help you 
glance through your icons more easily:
 
✓ Clean Up: Choose this command to align icons to an invisible grid; you 
use it to keep your windows and Desktop neat and tidy. (If you like this 
invisible grid, don’t forget that you can turn it on or off for the Desktop 
and individual windows by using View Options.) Clean Up is available 
only in Icon view or when no windows are active. If no windows are 
active, the command instead cleans up your Desktop. (To deactivate all 
open windows, just click anywhere on the Desktop.)
 
 If you’re like me, you’ve taken great pains to place icons carefully in 
specific places on your Desktop. Cleaning up your Desktop destroys all 
your beautiful work and moves all your perfectly arranged icons. And 
alas, cleaning up your Desktop is not something you can undo.
 
 If any icons are selected (highlighted) when you pull down the View 
menu, you see Clean Up Selection rather than Clean Up. If you choose 
this command, it moves only the icons that are currently selected. 
 
✓ Arrange By: This command rearranges the icons in the active window in 
your choice of six ways:
 
• Name (shortcut Ô+Control+1)
 
• Date Modified (shortcut Ô+Control+2)
 
• Date Created (shortcut Ô+Control+3)
 
• Size, Kind, or Label (shortcuts Ô+Control+4, 5, and 6, respectively)
 
 Like Clean Up, Arrange By is available only for windows viewed as icons.

102
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Listless? Try touring folders in List view
Now I come to my second-favorite view, List view (shown in Figure 5-8). The 
main reason why I like it so much is the little triangles to the left of each 
folder, known as disclosure triangles, which let you see the contents of a 
folder without actually opening it. This view also allows you to select items 
from multiple folders at once.
 
 To display a window in List view, click the List view button on the toolbar 
(shown in the margin), choose View➪As List from the Finder’s menu bar, or 
press Ô+2.
The alternating stripes make it easier to look at long lists like this one.
Icon view: The ol’ stick-in-the-mud view
In all fairness, I must say that many perfectly 
happy Macintosh users love Icon view and 
refuse to even consider anything else. Fine. 
But as the number of files on your hard drive 
increases (as it does for every Mac user), 
screen real estate becomes more and more 
valuable. In my humble opinion, the only real 
advantages that Icon view has over Column 
or List view are the ability to arrange the icons 
anywhere you like within the window and to 
put a background picture or color behind your 
icons. Big deal.
I offer this solution as a compromise: If you still 
want to see your files and folders in Icon view, 
make them smaller so that more of them fit in 
the same space on-screen. This is what I do 
with any icons I have on my Desktop (because 
the Desktop allows only Icon view).
To change the size of a window’s icons, choose 
View➪Show View Options (or press Ô+J). In 
the View Options window that appears, drag 
the Icon Size slider that you find there to the 
left. This makes the icons in the active window 
smaller. Conversely, you could make ’em all 
bigger by dragging the Icon Size slider to the 
right. Bigger icons make me crazy, but if you 
like them that way, your Mac can accommo-
date you. You can also alter the space between 
icons by dragging the Grid Spacing slider left 
or right.
When you’re satisfied with your choices in the 
View Options window, if you want to apply those 
settings to every window when it’s in Icon view, 
click the Use as Defaults button at the bottom 
of the View Options window. This affects all 
windows displayed in Icon view. (Read more on 
the View Options window coming up in a page 
or two.)
Note: If you like Icon view, consider purchas-
ing a larger monitor — I hear that monitors now 
come in a 30-inch size.

Figure 5-8: 
A window in 
List view.
 
 
When you’re in List view, the following tips can help you breeze through your 
folders to find what you’re looking for:
 
✓ To disclose a folder’s contents, click the triangle to its left or if it’s 
selected, press the right arrow key. Figure 5-8 shows the result of either 
clicking the triangle to the left of the DirectoryService folder or selecting 
(highlighting) the DirectoryService folder and pressing the right arrow key. 
 
 If you press Option+right arrow, all the folder’s subfolders also expand. 
So if I had pressed the Option key before I pressed the right arrow key in 
Figure 5-8, the More Directory Service Logs folder would have expanded. 
And if it contained any folders, they would have been expanded as well.
 
✓ Click the column header to sort items in List view. Notice the little triangle 
at the right edge of the selected column (the Name column in Figure 5-8). 
If this little arrow points up, the items in the corresponding column sort in 
descending order; if you click the header (Name) once, the arrow points 
down, and the items are listed in the opposite (ascending) order. This 
behavior is true for all columns in List view windows.
 
✓ You can change the order in which columns appear in a window. To 
do so, press and hold a column’s name and then drag it to the left or 
right until it’s where you want it. Release the mouse button, and the 
column moves.
 
 The exception (isn’t there always an exception?) is that the Name 
column always appears first in List view windows; you can move all 
other columns about at will. In fact, you can even hide and show col-
umns other than Name if you like, as you see in “On using view options” 
later in this chapter.

You gotta go with the flow
Mac OS X 10.5 introduced the Cover Flow view. If you’re familiar with the 
Cover Flow feature in iTunes or if you own an iPhone (which does a Cover 
Flow thing when you turn it sideways in its iPod music-player mode), you’re 
already familiar with Cover Flow.
 
 To display a window in Cover Flow view, click the Cover Flow view button on 
the toolbar (shown in the margin), choose View➪As Cover Flow from the 
Finder’s menu bar, or press Ô+4. Figure 5-9 shows the Cover Flow view.
 
Figure 5-9: 
A window in 
Cover Flow 
mode. 
 
The Cover Flow view has two cool features: 
 
✓ The item that’s selected in the list (Dr bob-with-stethomouse.jpg in 
Figure 5-9) appears in a preview in the upper part of the window. 
 
✓ You can flip through the previews by clicking the images to the left or 
right of the current preview image (me wearing a stethomouse in the 
figure) or by sliding the black scroll bar below the preview to the left 
or right. 
Like a road map: The current 
folder’s pop-up menu
In the center of the window’s title bar is the name of the folder that you’re 
viewing in this window — the highlighted folder. You know that already. What 

105
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
you might not know is that it offers a hidden road map to this folder from the 
top level. The following steps explain how it works:
 
1. Ô+click and hold the folder’s name (Desktop) in the title bar.
 
 A pop-up menu appears with the current folder (Desktop in Figure 5-10) 
at the top.
 
Figure 5-10: 
Traverse 
folders from 
this 
convenient 
pop-up 
menu.
 
 
2. Select any folder in the menu, and it becomes the highlighted folder 
in the current window; release the mouse button, and that folder’s 
contents are displayed.
 
 As shown in Figure 5-10, the contents of the Desktop folder are displayed 
(or they would be displayed if there were any, but there aren’t) in the 
window. If I released the mouse button, the contents of the highlighted 
folder (BobLeV) would appear.
 
3. After jumping to a new folder, you can click the Back button.
 
 Hey, you’re right back where you were before you touched that pop-up 
menu.
 
If you like this feature a lot, choose View➪Customize Toolbar to add a Path 
button to your toolbar. It displays the menu of folders previously described 
without your having to hold down the Ô key. (If you decide later to remove 
this item from the toolbar, simply hold down the Ô key and drag it out of the 
toolbar. When you release the mouse button, the item disappears with a satis-
fying poof.) And don’t forget that you can display the Path bar near the bottom 
of the window (it’s showing in Figure 5-10) by choosing View➪Show Path Bar. 
Then you can double-click any folder displayed in the Path Bar to open it. 

106
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Going places with the Go menu
The Go menu is chock-full of shortcuts. The items on this menu take you to 
places on your Mac — many of the same places you can go with the Finder 
window toolbar — and a few other places.
The following list gives you a brief look at the items on the Go menu:
 
✓ Back (Ô+[): Use this menu option to return to the last Finder window 
that you had open. It’s equivalent to the Back button on the Finder tool-
bar, in case you have the toolbar hidden.
 
✓ Forward (Ô+]): This command is the opposite of using the Back com-
mand, moving you forward through every folder you open. Remember 
that if you haven’t gone back, you can’t go forward.
 
✓ Enclosing Folder (Ô+↑): This command tells the Finder window to dis-
play the folder where the currently selected item is located.
 
✓ Computer ($+Ô+C): This command tells the Finder window to display 
the Computer level, showing Network and all your disks.
 
✓ Home ($+Ô+H): Use this command to have the Finder window display 
your Home folder (which is named with your short name).
 
✓ Desktop ($+Ô+D): Use this command to display the Desktop folder, 
which contains the same icons as the Desktop you see behind open 
windows.
 
✓ Network ($+Ô+K): This command displays whatever is accessible on 
your network in the Finder window.
 
✓ iDisk ($+Ô+I): Use this submenu to mount your iDisk, another user’s 
iDisk, or another user’s iDisk Public Folder. (You find out more about 
iDisk in Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Applications ($+Ô+A): This command displays your Applications 
folder, the usual storehouse for all the programs that came with your 
Mac (and the most likely place to find the programs you install).
 
✓ Documents ($+Ô+O): You’ll probably use this command often, as the 
Documents folder is a great place to save documents you create.
 
✓ Utilities ($+Ô+U): This command gets you to the Utilities folder inside 
the Applications folder in one fell swoop. The Utilities folder is the 
repository of such useful items as Disk Utility (which lets you erase, 
format, verify, and repair disks) and Disk Copy (which you use to create 
and mount disk-image files). You find out more about these useful tools 
in Chapter 18.
 
✓ Recent Folders: Use this submenu to quickly go back to a folder that 
you recently visited. Every time you open a folder, Mac OS X creates an 
alias to it and stores it in the Recent Folders folder. You can open any of 
these aliases from the Recent Folders command on the Go menu.

107
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
✓ Go to Folder ($+Ô+G): This command summons the Go to Folder 
dialog, shown in Figure 5-11. Look at your Desktop. Maybe it’s cluttered 
with lots of windows, or maybe it’s completely empty. Either way, sup-
pose you’re several clicks away from a folder that you want to open. 
If you know the path from your hard drive to that folder, you can type 
the path to the folder in the Go to the Folder text box (separating folder 
names with forward slashes [/]) and then click Go to move (relatively) 
quickly to the folder you need.
 
 The first character you type must also be a forward slash, as shown in 
Figure 5-11, unless you’re going to a subfolder of the current window.
 
Figure 5-11: 
Go to a 
folder by 
typing its 
path.
 
 
 This particular window is a tad clairvoyant; it tries to guess which folder 
you mean by the first letter or two that you type. For example, in Figure 
5-11, I typed the letter A and paused, and the window guessed that I 
wanted Applications. Then I pressed the right-arrow key to accept the 
guess and typed U, and the window guessed the rest (tilities) and filled it 
in for me.
 
✓ Connect to Server (Ô+K): If your Mac is connected to a network or to 
the Internet, use this command to reach those remote resources.
Customizing the Finder Window
The Finder is outrageously handy. It not only gives you convenient access 
to multiple windows, but also offers ways to tweak what you see till you get 
what works best for you. So whereas earlier sections in this chapter explain 
what the Finder is and how it works, the following sections ask, “How would 
you like it to be?”
Your main task when customizing the Finder is setting the preferences. View 
Options also offers settings for Icon, List, Column, and Cover Flow views. But 
that’s not all. Remember the Action menu? Well, even if it seems too egghead, 
you can customize that menu, too, putting your favorite actions at your 
fingertips.

108
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Adding folders to the Sidebar
Adding whatever folder you like to the Sidebar is easy. All you need to do is 
select the item you want to add and choose File➪Add to Sidebar from the 
menu bar (or press Ô+T). You can now reach the item by clicking it in any 
Finder window’s Sidebar.
Setting Finder preferences
You can find Finder and Desktop preferences by choosing Finder➪
Preferences. In the Finder Preferences window that appears, you find four 
panes: General, Labels, Sidebar, and Advanced, all of which are shown in 
Figure 5-12.
 
Figure 5-12: 
Set Finder 
preferences 
here. 
 

109
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
In the General pane, you find the following options:
 
✓ Show These Items on the Desktop check boxes: Select or deselect these 
check boxes to choose whether icons for hard drives; external disks; 
CDs, DVDs, and iPods; and connected servers appear on the Desktop. 
Mac OS X selects all four options by default (which mimics earlier ver-
sions of Mac OS). But if you don’t want disk icons cluttering your beauti-
ful Desktop, you have the option of deselecting (clearing) these check 
boxes. If they’re deselected, you can still work with CDs, DVDs, and 
other types of disks. You just have to open a Finder window and select 
the one you want in the Sidebar.
 
✓ New Finder Windows Open pop-up menu: Here, you can choose 
whether opening a new Finder window displays your Home folder, the 
Computer window, or some other folder. (Home is the default.)
 
✓ Always Open Folders in a New Window check box: Selecting this box 
makes OS X work the same way as Mac OS 9.
 
 Try it the OS X way — with windows opening “in place” to prevent 
window clutter. Press Ô before double-clicking to force a folder to open 
in a new window. I’ve learned to love this new way, although I hated it 
at first. Now, between this feature and Column view, I rarely need more 
than two or three windows on-screen, and I get by most of the time with 
a single window in Column view.
 
✓ Spring-loaded folders and windows: This one’s easier to do than to 
explain so do this: Check the box to enable the feature, and then drag 
any icon (except a disk icon) onto any folder or disk icon. When the 
folder or disk icon is highlighted, don’t release the mouse button. After 
a delay (which you set via the Delay slider), the highlighted folder icon 
“springs” open. If you drag the item onto another folder now, that folder 
springs open. And so on. This continues until you release the mouse 
button, at which time the item you’re dragging is dropped into which-
ever folder is open at the time. Notice that each time you drag the item 
onto a different folder the previous folder springs shut automatically. 
That’s spring-loaded folders for you. 
 
As long as the box is checked you can make folders spring open instantly by 
pressing the spacebar regardless of the delay you’ve specified with the Delay 
slider. 
The Labels pane lets you rename the colored labels that appear in the File 
menu. The default names are the same as their color, but you can change 
them to anything you like by entering new labels in the text boxes. To dem-
onstrate this, I changed the first item from its default name (Red) to Urgent in 
Figure 5-12.

110
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
To assign a label to any icon, select the icon, choose File➪Label, and then 
click one of the colored dots. The selected icon takes on that color. Why 
would you want to do that? Well, partly because colorized icons are festive, but 
mostly because you can then use the label as one of the criteria for searches, 
as described earlier in the chapter.
Here’s an example: If you apply the red label to every file and folder associ-
ated with, say Project X — all of the folders, DOC files, PDF files, JPEG files, 
and so on — you can later search for items with the red label and see all 
these items at once, regardless of what folder they’re stored in or what appli-
cation created them.
Another use for labels is to designate folders for a third-party backup util-
ity, such as EMC/Dantz Development’s Retrospect, to copy automatically. 
(Backups are covered in detail in Chapter 17.)
That said, many users find labels useless and go years without ever applying 
a single label to a file or folder.
The Sidebar pane lets you choose which items are displayed in the Sidebar. 
Select the check box to display the item; deselect the check box to not dis-
play it. 
The Advanced pane is just big enough to offer the following check boxes and 
a pop-up menu:
 
✓ The Show All File Extensions check box tells the Finder to display the 
little two-, three-, four-, or more-character filename suffixes (such as .doc 
in summary.doc) that make your Mac’s file lists look more like those of a 
Windows or Linux user. The Finder hides those from you by default, but 
if you want to be able to see them in the Finder when you open or save 
files, you need to turn on this option.
 
✓ The Show Warning before Changing an Extension check box allows 
you to turn off the other nagging dialog that appears if you attempt to 
change the two-, three-, four-, or more-character file extension.
 
✓ The Show Warning before Emptying the Trash check box (on by default) 
allows you to turn off the nagging dialog telling you how many items are in 
the Trash and asking whether you really want to delete them.
 
✓ The Empty Trash Securely check box makes Secure Empty Trash the 
default. The Secure Empty Trash feature overwrites deleted files with 
meaningless data so neither the files nor their contents can be recovered.
 
✓ The When Performing a Search pop-up menu lets you choose the 
default search location when you initiate a search as described earlier 
in this chapter. Your choices are Search This Mac, Search the Current 
folder, or Use the Previous Search Scope (as shown in Figure 5-12).

111
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
On using View Options
The View Options window lets you soup up the way any window looks and 
behaves. You can do this either globally (so that all windows use the same 
view when opened) or on a window-by-window basis.
To find these options, follow these steps:
 
1. Decide whether you want to modify Icon, List, Column, or Cover Flow 
view by displaying the window in that view.
 
 The choice of window view determines what options you see in the View 
Options window. The following sections describe those options.
 
2. Choose View➪Show View Options (or press Ô+J).
 
 The View Options window appears. The choices you set in this window 
affect only the active Finder window unless you click the Use As Defaults 
button, which I get to in a moment.
Icon view options
The following list describes the View Options that you see after you choose 
Icon view (see Figure 5-13):
 
✓ Always Open in Icon View: Does just what the name implies — it causes 
this window (BobLeV in Figure 5-13) to always open in Icon view even if 
you switched it to a different view the last time you used it.
 
✓ Icon Size: Use the Icon Size slider to make icons larger or smaller. To 
save valuable screen space, I recommend keeping your icons small. The 
largest icon size is nothing short of huge.
 
Figure 5-13: 
The options 
for Icon 
view.
 

112
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
✓ Grid Spacing: Use the Grid Spacing slider to change the distance 
between icons.
 
 Watch the active Finder window as you move the sliders so you can 
monitor the icons’ size and spacing as they shrink or grow, depending 
on how far you move the slider.
 
✓ Text Size: What it says . . . the size of the icon’s name. Just choose the 
point size you want from a list in the pop-up menu.
 
✓ Label Position: Select either the Bottom or the Right radio button to set 
where the icon’s name appears — below it or to its right.
 
✓ Icon Arrangement: Okay, Icon Arrangement doesn’t label this group of 
check boxes, but icon arrangement is what these options do. With these 
check boxes, you specify whether those icons should be penned up or 
free-range:
 
• Show Item Info: Adds a line of text below the icon’s name with info 
about the file (or folder).
 
• Show Icon Preview: Makes the icon look like the picture the docu-
ment contains, assuming that the document contains a picture 
(that is, if it’s a TIFF, JPEG, PDF, or other graphic file type), as 
shown in Figure 5-14.
 
• Arrange By: Lets you specify the sort order for your icons from the 
pop-up menu. Your choices are None, Snap to Grid, Name, Date 
Modified, Date Created, Size, Kind, and Label.
 
Figure 5-14: 
An icon with 
its preview 
off (left) and 
on (right).
 
 
✓ Background: From this list of radio buttons, you can pick a color or 
picture for your windows, or opt for none at all (white, the default). 
Figure 5-15 shows what a folder looks like with a picture in its back-
ground. I’m not sure that windows should have pictures in their back-
grounds, but if you like them, this is how it’s done.
 
 Whatever you choose — insert a picture, choose a color, or make the 
background plain white — appears in the currently active window 
unless you click the Use As Defaults button, which makes it appear in 
every window.

113
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
Figure 5-15: 
This window 
now has a 
pen as its 
background 
picture. 
 
If you want all your Icon view windows to use these settings, here’s what to 
do: Set all the preceding options just the way you want them for Icon view 
windows, and then click the Use As Defaults button at the bottom of the View 
Options window. That’s it — you’re done! From now on, all your windows in 
Icon view will have these characteristics.
When you’re done, close the View Options window.
List view (and Cover Flow) options
Suppose that you prefer List view (instead of Icon view) and want to change 
the options for viewing your items this way. (The Cover Flow view options 
are similar to the List view options, because Cover Flow includes a List view 
at the bottom.) To change these view options, follow these steps:
 
1. With the View Options window open, open a Finder window in List view. 
 
2. From the cluster of check boxes beneath the Show Columns heading, 
shown in Figure 5-16, select the ones you want to appear in this List 
view window.
 
 Most of the options here tell Mac OS X which fields to display or hide. 
The choices depend on what information you want displayed, such as
 
• Date Modified: Notes the last time someone saved a change to the 
file or an item in a folder.
 
• Date Created: Shows when a file or folder was created.
 
• Last Opened: Shows when a file or folder was last accessed.
 
• Size: Indicates the item’s size in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
 
• Kind: Indicates the item’s type — folder, PDF file, and so on.
 
• Version: Indicates a file’s version number (if available).
 
• Comments: Displays comments typed in the Spotlight Comments 
field in the icon’s Get Info window.
 
 The Spotlight Comments field in the Get Info window can help you 
find files or folders more easily. For example, add a project name 
or the word urgent, or any description that will help you find the 

114
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
file later. (You discover more about the Get Info window later in 
this chapter and more about Spotlight searches in Chapter 6.)
 
• Label: Displays the Label assigned to that icon (if a label has been 
assigned, as discussed earlier in the chapter).
 
 You can always change your selections later if you find that you aren’t 
using a particular field.
 
 The first four — modification date, creation date, size, and last opened — 
can be useful if you want to sort the items by something other than name.
 
Figure 5-16: 
Choose 
which 
columns to 
display and 
how to

in List view.
 
 
3. Select the Use Relative Dates check box if you want Mac OS X to intel-
ligently substitute relative word equivalents (such as yesterday or 
today) for numerical dates.
 
4. Select the Calculate All Sizes check box if you want to instruct Mac OS 
X to (yup) calculate all sizes. 
 
 Select this view to see how much stuff is in each folder when you look at it 
in List view. The items (including folders) in the active window are sorted 
in descending order, from biggest to smallest, when you sort by size.
 
 If you don’t select the Calculate All Sizes check box, items other than fold-
ers are sorted by size, with all folders — regardless of their size — appear-
ing at the bottom of the list (or top, if the sort order is ascending).
 
5. Select one of these two Icon Size radio buttons at the top of the View 
Options window to choose small or large icons in your List views.
 
 For my money, I think the smallest ones make windows appear notice-
ably faster — and they definitely allow more items to be shown. (Your 
mileage may vary.)

115
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
 If you want to make all your List view windows use these settings, it’s no 
problem. First, set everything above just the way you want it for all your 
List view windows. Then click the Use As Defaults button at the bottom 
of the View Options window. That’s it!
 
6. Select the Show Icon Preview check box to make icons look like the 
picture the document contains, assuming that the document contains 
a picture (that is, if it’s a TIFF, JPEG, PDF, or other graphic file type).
 
7. Select the Always Open in List View check box to cause this window to 
always open in List view even if you switched it to a different view the 
last time you used it.
 
8. Close the View Options window.
Column view options
Last but not least, to alter your options for windows in Column view, follow 
these steps:
 
1. With the View Options window open, open a Finder window in 
Column view.
 
2. Set the options you want to use in this Column view window.
 
 Only four options are available for windows in Column view:
 
• Text Size: Choose the size you want from the pop-up menu.
 
• Show Icons: Deselect this check box, and you see only text in the 
columns instead of both text and icons.
 
• Show Preview Column: Determines whether you see a preview in the 
rightmost column when a file is selected (as shown in Figure 5-6, ear-
lier in this chapter).
 
• Arrange By: Use this pop-up menu to choose the order in which 
items in the columns are displayed. Your options are Name, Date 
Modified, Date Created, Size, Kind, and Label.
 
 I find arranging columns by any of the options but Name totally 
disconcerting.
 
 If you want all your Column view windows to use these settings, it’s no 
problem. First, set all the options just the way you want them for all of 
your Column view windows. Then click the Use As Defaults button at the 
bottom of the View Options window. That’s it!
 
3. Select the Always Open in Column View check box if you want this 
window to open in Column View every time, even if you switched it to 
a different view the last time you used it. 
 
4. Close the View Options window.

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Customizing the Finder 
with Folder Actions
 
Apple has this really cool technology called AppleScript. It’s been around 
since System 7 was released and hasn’t ever really gotten the respect it 
deserves. AppleScript lets you program repetitive tasks so you don’t have to 
go through all the steps every time you want to perform the task. (You find a 
bit more info on AppleScript in Chapter 16.)
Having an AppleScript run when items are added to a closed folder sounds 
like a great tool for drop-box-style folders to me — how about you? For exam-
ple, you could launch the Mail application and send a notification to your 
project leader or project team whenever a new file was added to the folder. 
Here’s what you need to do:
 
1. Create or obtain AppleScripts to perform the tasks you want done.
 
 Programming AppleScript is beyond the purview of this book. But you 
can find ready-to-go scripts for Folder Actions on your hard drive at
Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts
 
 and even more at the Apple Web site in the AppleScript pages (www.
apple.com/macosx/features/applescript).
 
2. Enable Folder Actions by right-clicking or Control+clicking a folder 
and then choosing Folder Actions Setup from the contextual menu. 
 
 The Folder Actions Setup window appears with the Choose a Script to 
Attach sheet in front of it as shown on the left of Figure 5-17.
 
 It’s important to click the right thing. If you right-click or Control+click 
the area inside a folder window you won’t see Folder Actions Setup on 
the contextual menu. You have to right-click or Control+click a folder 
icon for this process to succeed.
 
3. Choose a script to attach to this folder and then click the Attach 
button.
 
4. (Optional) Click the + button below the Folders with Actions column 
and choose another folder to work with.
 
 The Choose a Script to Attach sheet reappears in front of the Folder 
Actions Setup window. Now, whenever you drop a file or folder into the 
folder with the action attached to it, that action is performed on the file 
or folder automatically and without further intervention on your part. 
 
 For example, I attached a script called add - new item alert to a folder 
called Folder Action test (as shown top right in Figure 5-17). When I drag a 
file or folder onto that folder, an alert appears, telling me a new item has 
been placed in Folder Action test (as shown bottom right in Figure 5-17).

Knowing Thy Finder Icons
Now is the time to take a closer look at some of the different icons you’ll 
encounter in the Finder. In the broadest sense, icons represent things you 
work with on your Mac, such as programs, documents, and folders.
 
Don’t confuse Dock icons with Finder icons — they’re two different animals. 
Dock and Sidebar icons are simply pointers to items on your hard drive. Icons 
in Finder windows, on the other hand, represent real things on your hard 
drive — your folders, applications, and documents. The big difference is that 
you can select regular Finder icons with a single click and open them with a 
double click; Dock and Sidebar icons can’t be selected, and you click just 
once to open them.

118
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Finder icons come in several shapes and sizes. After you’ve been around the 
Macintosh for a while, you develop a sixth sense about what an icon con-
tains, and you know just by looking at it. The three main types of icons are 
applications, documents, and folders. Well, there are actually four types — 
aliases are an icon type in their own right. But don’t worry — I show you all 
four icon types right now:
 
✓ Application icons are programs — the software you use to accom-
plish tasks on your Mac. Mail, Safari, and iCal are applications. So are 
Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop.
 
 Application icons come in a variety of shapes. For example, application 
(that is, program) icons are often square-ish. Sometimes they’re diamond-
shaped, rectangular, or just oddly shaped. In Figure 5-18, you can see 
application icons of various shapes.

✓ Document icons are files created by applications. A letter to your mom, 
which you create in TextEdit, is a document; so is my latest column 
written in Microsoft Word (and, for that matter, my Quicken data files). 
Document icons are almost always reminiscent of a piece of paper, as 
shown in Figure 5-19.

 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
✓ Folder icons are the Mac’s organizational containers. You can put 
icons — and the applications or documents they stand for — in folders. 
You can also put folders inside other folders. Folders look like, well, manila 
folders (what a concept) and can contain just about any other icon. You 
use folders to organize your files and applications on your hard drive. You 
can have as many folders as you want, so don’t be afraid to create new 
ones. The thought behind the whole folders thing is pretty obvious — 
if your hard drive is a filing cabinet, then folders are its drawers and 
folders (duh!). Figure 5-20 shows some typical folder icons.
 
✓ Aliases are wonderful — no, fabulous — organizational tools. I like 
aliases so much, in fact, that I think they deserve their very own section. 
Read on for more info on this ultra-useful tool.
If you’re looking for details about how to organize your icons in folders, move 
them around or delete them, and much more, check out Chapter 6, which 
explains everything you need to know about file organization and management.
 
Figure 5-20: 
Some run-
of-the-mill 
folder icons.
 
Aliases: Greatest Thing 
Since Sliced Bread
An alias is a tiny file that automatically opens the file, folder, disk, or network 
volume that it represents. Although an alias is technically an icon, it’s differ-
ent from other icons — it actually does nothing but open another icon auto-
matically when you double-click it.
Put another way, aliases are organizational tools that let you have an icon 
appear in more than one place without having to create multiple copies of 
the file that icon represents.
An alias is very different from a duplicated file. For example, the iTunes appli-
cation uses around 90 megabytes (MB) of hard-drive space. A duplicate of 
iTunes gives me two files, each requiring around 90MB of space on my hard 
drive. An alias of iTunes, on the other hand, uses a mere 68 kilobytes (K).
So you put aliases of programs and files you use often in convenient places 
such as the Desktop.

120
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
In effect, Microsoft stole the alias feature from Apple. (If you’ve used Windows, 
you may know aliases as shortcuts.) But what else is new? And for what it’s 
worth, the Mac’s aliases usually don’t break when you move or rename the 
original file; shortcuts do.
Why else do I think that aliases are so great? Well, they open any file or folder 
on any hard drive from anywhere else on any hard drive — which is a very 
good trick. But there are many other reasons I think aliases rock:
 
✓ Convenience: Aliases enable you to make items appear to be in more 
than one place, which on many occasions is exactly what you want to 
do. For example, keep an alias of your word processor on your Desktop 
and another in your Documents folder for quick access. Aliases enable 
you to open your word processor right away without having to navigate 
into the depths of your Applications folder every time you need it.
 
 While you’re at it, you might want to put an icon for your word processor 
in both the Dock and the Sidebar to make it even easier to open your 
word processor without a lot of clicking.
 
✓ Flexibility and organization: You can create aliases and store them 
anywhere on your hard drive to represent the same document in several 
different folders. This is a great help when you need to file a document 
that can logically be stored in any of several files. If you write a memo to 
Fred Smith about the Smythe Marketing Campaign to be executed in the 
fourth quarter, which folder does the document go in? Smith? Smythe? 
Marketing? Memos? 4th Quarter? Correct answer: With aliases, it can go 
in every folder, if you like. Then you can find the memo wherever you 
look instead of guessing which folder you filed it in.
 
 With aliases, it doesn’t matter. You can put the actual file in any folder 
and then create aliases of the file, placing them in any other applicable 
folder.
 
✓ Integrity: Some programs must remain in the same folder as their sup-
porting files and folders. Many programs, for example, won’t function 
properly unless they’re in the same folder as their dictionaries, thesau-
ruses, data files (for games), templates, and so on. Thus, you can’t put 
the actual icon for such programs on the Desktop without impairing 
their functionality. An alias lets you access a program like that from any-
where on your hard drive.
Creating aliases
When you create an alias, its icon looks the same as the icon that it represents, 
but the suffix alias is tacked onto its name, and a tiny arrow called a badge 

121
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
appears in the lower-left corner of its icon. Figure 5-21 shows both an alias and 
its parent icon (that is, the icon that opens if you double-click the alias).
 
Figure 5-21: 
An alias 
(right) and 
its parent.
 
To create an alias for an icon, do one of the following:
 
✓ Click the parent icon and choose File➪Make Alias.
 
✓ Click the parent icon and press Ô+L.
 
✓ Click any file or folder, press and hold down Ô+Option, and then drag 
the file or folder while continuing to hold down Ô+Option.
 
 Presto! An alias appears where you release the mouse button.
 
✓ Click an icon while holding down the Control key and then choose the 
Make Alias command from the contextual menu that appears.
 
 The alias appears in the same folder as its parent. (You can explore con-
textual menus — which are very cool — in Chapter 2.)
When I first create a file, I save it in its proper folder inside the Documents 
folder in my Home folder. If it’s a document that I plan to work on for more 
than a day or two (such as a magazine article or book chapter), I make an 
alias of the document (or folder) and plop it on the Desktop. After I finish the 
article or chapter and submit it to an editor, I trash the alias, leaving the origi-
nal file stashed away in its proper folder.
Deleting aliases
This is a short section because deleting an alias is such an easy chore. To 
delete an alias, simply drag it onto the Trash icon in the Dock. That’s it! You 
can also Control+click it and choose Move to Trash from the contextual menu 
that appears, or select the icon and press Ô+Delete.
 
Deleting an alias does not delete the parent item. (If you want to delete the 
parent item, you have to go hunt it down and kill it yourself.)

122
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
Hunting down an alias’s parent
Suppose that you create an alias of a file, and later you want to delete both 
the alias and its parent file, but you can’t find the parent file. What do you 
do? Well, you can use the Finder’s Find function to find it (try saying that 
three times real fast), but here are three faster ways to find the parent icon of 
an alias:
 
✓ Select the alias icon and choose File➪Show Original.
 
✓ Select the alias icon and press Ô+R.
 
✓ Control+click the alias icon and choose Show Original from the 
contextual menu.
Any of the methods open the window that contains the parent of the alias 
and select its icon. 
Digging for Icon Data 
in the Info Window
Every icon has an Info window that gives you — big surprise! — information 
about that icon and enables you to choose which other users (if any) you 
want to have the privilege of using this icon. (I discuss sharing files and privi-
leges in detail in Chapter 15.) The Info window is also where you lock an icon 
so that it can’t be renamed or dragged to the Trash.
To see an icon’s Info window, click the icon and choose File➪Get Info (or 
press Ô+I). The Info window for that icon appears. Figure 5-22 shows the Info 
window for the QuickTime Player icon.
 
Documents, folders, and disks each have slightly different Info windows. In 
this section, I give you highlights on the type of information and options that 
you can find.
The gray triangles reveal what information for an icon is available in this 
particular Info window. The sections that you see for most icons include the 
following:
 
✓ Spotlight Comments: Provides a field in which you can type your own 
comments about this icon for Spotlight to use in its searches. (I talk 
about this a little earlier in this chapter and discuss Spotlight searches 
in Chapter 6.)

123
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
Figure 5-22: 
A typical 
Info 
window 
for an 
application 
(QuickTime 
Player in 
this case).
 
 
✓ General: For information of the general kind, such as
 
• Kind: What kind of file this is — an application, document, disk, 
folder, and so on.
 
• Size: How much hard drive space this file uses.
 
• Where: The path to the folder that contains this file.
 
• Created: The date and time that this file was created.
 
• Modified: The date and time that this file was last modified (that is, 
saved).
 
• Version: Copyright information and the file’s version number.
 
• Label: Choose or change the color label for this item.
 
 There are also five other check boxes that may or may not appear in 
the General section of a particular Info window. Here’s the scoop on this 
quintet of optional options: 
 
• Open Using Rosetta (check box): Some applications — known as 
Universal applications — are designed to work on both Intel-based 
Macintosh computers and PowerPC-based Macs. Some of these 
Universal applications might use extensions or plug-ins that won’t 
work in an Intel-based Mac unless you select this check box.
 
 If a program doesn’t seem to work properly, crashes frequently, or 
quits immediately after launching it, try selecting this check box.

124
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Basics 
 
 Rosetta is not installed by default with Snow Leopard. If you didn’t 
specifically choose to install it this item doesn’t appear in your Info 
windows. Because I didn’t choose to install Rosetta, the Open 
Using Rosetta check box doesn’t appear in my Info windows (and 
consequently is not shown in Figure 5-22). 
 
• Open in 32-bit mode (check box): Most late-model Macs can take 
advantage of Snow Leopard’s high-performance 64-bit processing 
mode. Some applications are designed to take advantage of Snow 
Leopard’s faster 64-bit processing mode. But sometimes an appli-
cation that should run in 64-bit mode doesn’t work properly. If 
an application doesn’t work properly — it often quits unexpect-
edly, freezes, or refuses to launch at all — try checking this box. It 
couldn’t hurt.
 
• Shared folder (check box): Designates the folder as “Shared,” so 
other users are allowed to see and use its contents. You find out all 
about sharing in Chapter 15.
 
• Stationery Pad (check box): This one only appears in the Info 
window of document icons. If you select it, the file becomes a tem-
plate. When you open a Stationery Pad document a copy of its con-
tents appear in a new Untitled document that you would typically 
save with a descriptive name. 
 
• Locked (check box): If this box is checked you receive a warn-
ing if you try to put the item in the Trash: “This item is locked. 
Do you want to move it to the Trash anyway?” Your options are 
Stop or Continue. If you continue, the item goes into the Trash 
as usual. Then, when you try to empty the Trash, you receive 
another warning: “There are some locked items in the Trash. Do 
you want to remove all the items, including the locked ones, or just 
the unlocked ones?” Your choices this time are Cancel, Remove 
Unlocked Items, and Remove All Items. If you choose to Remove 
All Items, the locked item(s) are deleted. If you choose Remove 
Unlocked Items, the locked item(s) remain in the Trash and you 
receive the “There are some locked items” warning again the next 
time you try to empty it. 
 
 To remove the locked item from the Trash, click the Trash icon in 
the Dock and then drag the locked item out of the Trash and into a 
folder or onto the Desktop.
 
✓ More Info: When the icon was last opened.
 
✓ Name & Extension: Tells the full name, including the (possibly hidden) 
extension.

125
 Chapter 5: The Finder and Its Icons
 
✓ Preview: When you select a document icon, the menu offers a Preview 
option that you use to see a glimpse of what’s in that document. You 
can also see this preview when you select a document icon in Column 
view — it magically appears in the rightmost column. If you select a 
QuickTime movie or sound, you can play your selection right there in 
the preview pane without launching a separate application. Neat.
 
✓ Sharing & Permissions: Governs which users have access to this icon 
and how much access they are allowed. (See Chapter 15 for more about 
access privileges.)
And that’s about it for icons, which are among the most fundamental parts of 
what makes your Mac a Mac (and not a toaster or an Xbox).

eruse the chapters in this part to discover how to 
organize just about everything in your Snow Leopard. 
Don’t get all worked up — this stuff is easy. In fact, I think 
of this part as “The Lazy Person’s Guide to Getting and 
Staying Organized.”
I start by showing you more about the all-important Finder, 
then moving on to the two most important skills of all: saving 
and opening files. Then you discover the joys of dealing with 
disks (and discs) — a good thing to know indeed! Next is a 
short discourse on using your calendars to stay organized 
and other important information, all without tearing your 
hair out. 
It might sound imposing, but I assure you this part is 
(mostly) painless.

Files and Folders
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out the Mac OS X folder structure
▶ Getting (and staying) organized
▶ Opening icons
▶ Saving your document before it’s too late
▶ Finding your stuff, fast
T
his could be the most important chapter in this book. If you don’t under-
stand how to open and save files using the Open dialog and Save sheets 
or how to use the file and folder system, you’ll have a heck of a time getting 
the hang of your Mac. Ask any longtime Mac user — the old lament is pretty 
common: “Well, I saved the file, but now I don’t know where it went.” It hap-
pens all the time with new users; if they don’t master these essential tech-
niques, they often become confused about where files are located on their 
hard drives.
This chapter is the cure-all for your file and folder woes. Hang with me and 
pay attention; everything soon becomes crystal-clear.
 
You work with Open dialogs and Save sheets within applications. You see 
them only after you launch a program and use that program’s File menu to 
open or save a file. (For more on launching applications, read the parts of 
Chapter 5 that discuss icons; for more on creating and opening documents, 
see the documentation for the program that you’re using.)

Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
Understanding the Mac 
OS X Folder Structure
Start by looking at the folder structure of a typical Mac OS X installation. 
Open a Finder window and click the icon for your hard drive (which is typi-
cally called Macintosh HD) in the Sidebar. You should now see at least four 
folders — Applications, Library, System, and Users.
Within the User folder, each person who uses this Mac has his or her own set 
of folders that contain documents, preferences, and other information that 
belong to that person.
 
If you’re the sole person who accesses your Mac, you probably have only one 
user. Regardless, the folder structure that Mac OS X uses is the same, whether 
you have one user or dozens.
Within the Users folder, you find your personal Home folder and a Shared 
folder, where you can put files you want to share with other users.
All these files are stored in a nested folder structure that’s a bit tricky to 
understand at first. This structure makes more sense after you spend a little 
time with it and figure out some basic concepts. 
 
If you display the Path bar at the bottom of your windows by choosing View➪
Show Path Bar, it’ll start to make sense that much sooner.
If you take a look at Figure 6-1, you can see how these main folders are 
related to one another. In the sections that follow, you take a look at each of 
these folders in more depth and find out more about what’s nested inside 
each one.
 
Figure 6-1: 
A bird’s-eye 
view of key 
folders on 
your Mac 
and their 
structure.
 

131
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
Understanding nested folders
Folders within other folders are often called nested folders. To get a feel for 
the way nested folders work in Mac OS X, check out Figure 6-2. You can see 
the following from the figure:
 
✓ Folder 1 is one level deep.
 
✓ Folder 2 is inside Folder 1, which is one level deeper than Folder 1, or 
two levels deep.
 
✓ Folder 3 is inside Folder 2 and is three levels deep.
 
✓ The files inside Folder 3 are four levels deep.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Nested 
folders, 
going four 
levels deep.
 
Folder 1
1 Level deep
2 Levels deep
Folder 2
3 Levels deep
4 Levels deep
Folder 3
File 1 File 2
 
If the previous list makes sense to you, you’re golden. What’s important here 
is that you’re able to visualize the path to Folder 3. That is, to get to files inside 
Folder 3, you open Folder 1 and then open Folder 2 to be able to open Folder 3. 
Understanding this concept is important to understanding the relationships 
between files and folders. Keep reviewing this section, and eventually the 
concept will click — you’ll slap yourself in the head and say, “Now I get it!”

132
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
From the top: The Computer folder
I start with the Computer folder, which is the top level of the folder hierar-
chy. The Computer folder shows all the storage devices (hard drives, CD- or 
DVD-ROM, USB flash drive, and so forth) that are currently connected to your 
Mac. The following steps show how you can start at the Computer folder and 
drill down through the folder structure:
 
1. To find the Computer folder, choose Go➪Computer or press $+Ô+C.
 
 In Figure 6-3, the Computer folder is called MacBook, and it contains a 
hard-drive icon (SnowLeopardHD) and a Network icon, with which you 
can access servers or other computers on your local network. (If that 
seems mysterious, read Chapter 15 for the whole scoop on sharing files 
with other Macs and sharing your Mac with other users.)
 
 If you don’t see a Computer icon in your Sidebar, choose Finder➪
Preferences, click the Sidebar icon at the top, and then select the 
Computer check box. You can change the computer name (MacBook in 
Figure 6-3) in the Sharing System Preference pane, which you can access 
by launching the System Preference application (from the Applications 
folder, the Dock, or the Apple menu) and then clicking the Sharing icon.
 
 You might have more or fewer icons in your Computer folder than what 
you see in Figure 6-3 (depending on how many disks you have mounted).
 
Figure 6-3: 
The 
contents 
of the 
Computer 
folder.
 
 
2. Double-click the icon that holds your Mac OS X stuff. (Technically, this 
is called your boot drive.)
 
 In Figure 6-3, that hard drive is called SnowLeopardHD. Of course, I have 
no idea what yours is called; if you haven’t changed it, it’s probably 
called Macintosh HD.

133
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
3. Check out the folders you find there.
 
 You should see at least four folders (unless you’ve added some — if you 
installed the Xcode programming tools, for example, you have more). In 
the next few sections, I walk you through what you can find in each one.
Peeking into the Applications folder
The Applications folder, located at the root level of your boot drive (the one 
with OS X installed on it), is accessible with a click of the Applications icon 
in the Sidebar, from the Go menu, or by pressing $+Ô+A. In this folder, you 
find applications and utilities that Apple includes with Mac OS X. All users of 
a given Mac have access to the items in the Applications folder.
Finding fonts (and more) in 
the public Library folder
The Library folder at the root level of your Mac OS X hard drive is like a 
public library — it stores items that everyone with access to this Mac can 
use. You can find two different Library folders on your hard drive — the one 
at the root level of your OS X disk and another in your Home folder.
 
Okay, I wasn’t entirely truthful, but it was only for your own good: There’s 
actually a third Library folder inside the System folder, which I discuss in a 
page or two. But for now, heed this warning: Leave the /System/Library 
folder alone — don’t move, remove, or rename it or do anything within it. It’s 
the nerve center of your Mac. In other words, you should never have to touch 
this third Library folder.
You find a bunch of folders inside the Library folder at root level (the public 
Library folder). Most of them contain files that you never need to open, 
move, or delete.
By and large, the public Library subfolder that gets the most use is the Fonts 
folder, which houses many of the fonts installed on the Mac. For the most 
part, fonts can be made available in one of two ways:
 
✓ To everyone who uses the Mac: If that’s the case, they’re stored here in 
the Fonts folder.
 
✓ To a single user: In this case, you place the fonts in the user’s Library 
folder (the one in the user’s Home folder).

134
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
I discuss fonts more in Chapter 13. Meanwhile, some other public Library 
subfolders that you might use or add to are the iMovie, iTunes, iPhoto, and 
iDVD folders (where you put plug-ins for those programs); the Scripts folder 
(which houses AppleScripts accessible to all users); and the Desktop Pictures 
folder (where you can place pictures to be used as Desktop backgrounds).
 
Leave the “public” Library folder pretty much alone unless you’re using the 
Fonts folder or know what you’re adding to one of the other folders. Don’t 
remove, rename, or move any files or folders. Mac OS X uses these items and 
is very picky about where they’re kept and how they’re named. And while I’m 
on the subject, it’s also a good idea not to remove, rename, or move applica-
tions installed by Snow Leopard in the Applications folder. 
Note: Under most circumstances, you won’t actually add or remove items 
from folders in this Library yourself. Software installers usually do the heavy 
lifting for you by placing all their little pieces into appropriate Library fold-
ers. You shouldn’t need to touch this Library often, if ever. That said, know-
ing what these folders are — and who can access their contents — might 
come in handy down the road a piece.
 
If your Mac is set up for multiple users, only users with administrator (admin) 
privileges can put stuff into the public (root-level) Library folder. (For more 
information on admin privileges, check out Chapter 15.)
Let it be: The System folder
The System folder contains the files that Mac OS X needs to start up and keep 
working.
 
Leave this folder alone — don’t move, remove, or rename it or anything 
within it. It’s part of the nerve center of your Mac.
The usability of the Users folder
When you open the Users folder, you see a folder for each person who uses 
the Mac, as well as the Shared folder.
 
The Shared folder that you see in the Users folder allows everyone who uses 
the Mac to use the files stored there. If you want other people who use your 
Mac to have access to a file or folder, the Shared folder is the proper place to 
stash it. You can see my Shared folder right below my Home folder (BobLeV) 
earlier in Figure 6-1.

135
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
I realize that a lot of people don’t share their Macs with others. And if you’re 
one of these folks, you might wonder why I keep mentioning sharing and multi-
ple users and the like. Well, Mac OS X is based on the UNIX operating system — 
a multiuser operating system found on high-end servers and workstations that 
are often shared by several people. Mac OS X has both the benefit of this 
arrangement and a bit of the confusion caused when a single user (could it be 
you?) fires up a computer that could be set up for several people. That’s why 
Mac OS X folders are organized the way they are — with different hierarchies 
for each user and for the computer as a whole.
There’s no place like Home
From the Users folder, you can drill down into the Home folder to see what’s 
inside. When the user logs onto this Mac, his Home folder appears whenever 
he clicks the Home icon in the Sidebar, chooses Go➪Home, or uses the key-
board shortcut $+Ô+H.
 
Your Home folder is the most important folder to you as a user — or at least 
the one where you stash most of your files. I strongly recommend that you 
store all the files you create in a subfolder within your Home folder — prefer-
ably in a subfolder in your Home/Documents folder. The advantage of doing so 
is that your Home/Documents folder is easy to find, and many programs use it 
as the default folder for opening or saving a file.
When you open your Home folder, you see a Finder window with a little 
house icon and your short username in the title bar. Seeing your short user-
name in the title bar tells you that you’re in your Home folder. Every user has 
a Home folder named after his or her short username (as specified in the 
Accounts System Preference pane). Figure 6-4 shows that my Home folder is 
named BobLeV — the short name I used when I first set up my Mac.
 
Figure 6-4: 
My Home 
folder.
 

136
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
If your Mac has more than one user, you can see the other users’ Home fold-
ers in your Users folder, but Mac OS X prevents you from opening files from 
or saving files to them.
By default, your Home folder has several folders inside it created by Mac OS X. 
The following four are the most important:
 
✓ Desktop: If you put items (files, folders, applications, or aliases) on the 
Desktop, they’re actually stored in the Desktop folder.
 
✓ Documents: This is the place to put all the documents (letters, spread-
sheets, recipes, and novels) that you create.
 
✓ Library: Preferences (files containing the settings you create in System 
Preferences and other places) are stored in the Library folder, along 
with fonts that are available only to you (as described previously in this 
chapter) and other stuff that you — and only you — expect to use.
 
✓ Public: If others on your local area network use file sharing to connect 
with your Mac, they can’t see or use the files or folders in your Home 
folder. But they can share files you’ve stored in your Home folder’s 
Public folder. (Read more about file sharing and Public folders in 
Chapter 15.)
You can create more folders if you like. In fact, every folder that you ever 
create (at least every one you create on this particular hard drive or volume) 
should be within your Home folder. I explain more about creating folders and 
subfolders and organizing your stuff inside them later in this chapter.
 
The following are a few more tidbits to keep in mind as you dig around your 
Home folder:
 
✓ If you decide you don’t want an item on the Desktop anymore, delete it by 
dragging its icon from the Desktop folder to the Trash or by dragging its 
icon from the Desktop itself to the Trash. Both techniques yield the same 
effect: The file is in the Trash, where it remains until you empty the Trash. 
Or if you don’t want it on the Desktop anymore but don’t want to get rid of 
it either, you can drag it from the Desktop into any other folder you like.
 
✓ The other five folders that you should see in your Home folder are 
Downloads, Movies, Music, Pictures, and Sites. All these folders except 
Sites are empty until you (or a program like iTunes, iPhoto, or iMovie 
that creates files inside these folders automatically the first time you 
launch them) put something in these folders. The Sites folder contains 
a few files that your Mac needs if you enable Web Sharing in the Sharing 
System Preference pane, as I describe in Chapter 15.

137
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
Your personal Library card
The Library subfolder of your Home folder is the repository of everything 
that Mac OS X needs to customize your Mac to your tastes. If you want to add 
something to a Library folder, it’s usually best to add it to your Home/Library 
folder. You won’t spend much time (if any) adding things to the Library folder 
or moving them around within it, but it’s a good idea for you to know what’s 
in there. In the “Finding fonts (and more) in the public Library folder” section 
earlier in this chapter, I discuss the Library folder that’s used to specify pref-
erences for the Mac as a whole. But this Library folder is all about you and 
your stuff.
 
Be cautious with the Library folder because OS X is very persnickety about 
how its folders and files are organized. As I discuss earlier in the chapter, you 
can add and remove items safely from most Library folders, but leave the fold-
ers themselves alone. If you remove or rename the wrong folder, you could 
render OS X inoperable. It’s like the old joke about the guy who said to the 
doctor, “It hurts when I do that,” and the doctor replies, “Then don’t do that.”
To find the Library folder, click the Home icon in the Sidebar of any Finder 
window or press $+Ô+H and then open the Library folder. You should see 
several folders; the exact number depends on the software that you install 
on your Mac. For example, if you have an e-mail account, you should see fold-
ers called Addresses and Mail. (If you don’t have an e-mail account set up, of 
course, those folders might not be there.)
Some of the most important standard folders in the Library folder include the 
following:
 
✓ Documentation: Some applications store their Help files here. Others 
store theirs in the main (root-level) public Library folder.
 
✓ Fonts: This folder is empty until you install your own fonts here. The 
fonts that come with Mac OS X aren’t stored here, but in the Library 
folder at root level for everyone who uses this Mac. I discuss this earlier 
in this chapter. If you want to install fonts so that only you have access 
to them, put them in the Fonts folder in your Library folder.
 
 To install a font, drag its icon to the Fonts folder inside your Home/Library 
folder. It’s available only when you’re logged in; other users can’t use 
a font stored here. To install a font that’s available to anyone who uses 
this Mac, drag it into the Fonts folder in the public Library folder — the 
one at root level that you see when you open your hard drive’s icon.

✓ Preferences: The files here hold the information about whichever things 
you customize in Mac OS X or in the applications you run. Whenever 
you change a system or application preference, that info is saved to a 
file in the Preferences folder.
 
 Don’t mess with the Preferences folder! You should never need to open 
or use this folder unless something bad happens — for example, you 
suspect that a particular Preferences file has become corrupted (that is, 
damaged). My advice is to just forget about this folder and let it do its 
job. In fact, let me take it a step further and say, “Don’t mess with any 
of the folders inside your Home/Library folder unless you have a darn 
good reason.” If you don’t know why you’re doing something to a folder 
(other than the Fonts folder) in your Home/Library, don’t do it.
Saving Your Document 
Before It’s Too Late
If you have a feel for the Mac OS X folder structure, you can get down to 
the important stuff — namely, how to save documents and where to save 
them. You can create as many documents as you want, using one program 
or dozens of ’em, but all is lost if you don’t save the files to a storage device 
such as your hard drive or other disk.
When you save a file, you’re committing a copy to a disk — whether it’s a disk 
mounted on your Desktop, one available over a network, or a removable disk 
such as a USB flash drive or portable hard disk.
 
In these sections, I show you how to save your masterpieces. Prevent unnec-
essary pain in your life by developing good saving habits. I recommend that 
you save your work
 
✓ Every few minutes
 
✓ Before you switch to another program
 
✓ Before you print a document
 
✓ Before you stand up
 
If you don’t heed this advice — and the program that you’re using crashes 
while switching programs, printing, or sitting idle (the three likeliest times 
for a crash) — you lose everything you did since your last save. The fact that 
a program crash doesn’t bring down the entire system (as it did under Mac 
OS 9) is small consolation when you’ve lost everything you’ve typed, drawn, 
copied, pasted, or whatever since the last time you saved.

139
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
The keyboard shortcut for Save in almost every Mac program is Ô+S. Memorize 
it. See it in your dreams. Train your finger muscles to do it unconsciously. Use it 
(the keyboard shortcut) or lose it (your unsaved work).
Stepping through a basic Save
This section walks you through the steps you’ll use the first time you save a 
document.
 
There are only a few sections in this book I ask you not only to read while sit-
ting in front of your Mac but also to perform each step of the instructions as 
described. This section is one of them. If you read it and follow along, I can 
pretty much guarantee it’ll make sense. If you read it somewhere other than at 
your Mac, it could be a mite confusing. 
Saving a file works pretty much the same way in any application you use to 
create documents. For this example I’ll use Mac OS X’s word processing appli-
cation, TextEdit but the process would be very similar in Microsoft Word, 
Adobe Photoshop, Apple Keynote, or any other application. 
Hiding your stuff under the right rock
In versions of Mac OS before Mac OS X, 
the rules about where to store things were 
a lot looser. Storing everything within your 
Documents folder wasn’t at all important. But 
Mac OS X arranges its system files, applica-
tions, and other stuff a bit differently from the 
way the older versions did.
I strongly advise you to store all your document 
files — and the folders that contain them — in 
the Documents folder within your Home folder, 
or in your Home folder’s Movies folder, Music 
folder, or Pictures folder, if that’s where the 
application (such as iMovie, iTunes, or iPhoto) 
recommends. Files that you place outside the 
Documents folder are likely to get lost while you 
navigate through a maze of aliases and folders 
that belong to (and make sense to) particular 
programs or parts of the system software — and 
not to you as a user. An exception to this rule is 
to place files you need to share with other users 
in the Shared folder, inside the Users folder in 
which your Home folder resides.
If other people use your Mac and they changed 
privilege settings to give you access to their 
directories (see Chapter 15), you could even 
save a file in another user’s folder by acci-
dent, in which case you’d probably never find 
it again.
So trust me when I say that the Documents 
folder in your Home folder is the right place 
to start, not only because it’s easy to remem-
ber, but also because it’s only a menu com-
mand (Go➪Documents) or keyboard shortcut 
($+Ô+O) away, wherever you’re working on 
your Mac.

If you’re going to follow along as I recommend, please launch the TextEdit 
program now (it’s in your Applications folder) and type a few words on the 
Untitled page that appears after you launch it. 
Now that we’re both on the same page, both literally and figuratively, here’s 
how saving a file works:
When you choose to save a file for the first time (by choosing File➪Save or 
pressing Ô+S), a Save sheet appears in front of the document that you’re 
saving, as shown in Figure 6-5. I call this a basic Save sheet (as opposed to an 
expanded Save sheet, which I get to in a moment). 
 
1. In the Save As field, type a name for your file.
 
 When a Save sheet appears for the first time, the Save As field is active 
and displays the name of the document. The document name (usually 
Untitled) is selected; when you begin typing, the name disappears and is 
replaced by the name you type.
 
2. Check whether the Where pop-up menu lists the location where you 
want to save your file. If so, select it from the list and proceed to Step 5. If 
not, click the disclosure button (the one with the little triangle to the 
right of the word “Untitled” in Figure 6-5).
 
 You can choose any folder or volume listed in a Finder window’s Sidebar 
by clicking a basic Save sheet’s Where pop-up menu and taking your 
pick. Or if you click the disclosure button, the sheet expands so that you 
can navigate folders just as you would in the Finder: by opening them to 
see their contents.
 
Figure 6-5: 
A basic 
save Sheet 
looks a lot 
like this. 
 
Disclosure button

141
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
 In a basic Save sheet, the Where pop-up menu acts like a shortcut menu 
to the items in the Sidebar (MacBook, SnowLeopardHD, Desktop, 
BobLeV, Applications, and Documents in Figure 6-5) as well as other fold-
ers where you have opened or saved files recently (Novels in Figure 6-5). 
 
 If you switch to expanded view by clicking the disclosure button, the 
Where pop-up menu shows the path to the folder the file will be saved 
into (Documents in Figure 6-5 and 6-6) as well as other folders where you 
have opened or saved files recently (Novels in Figure 6-6).
 
 I think the Where menu should be the same in both basic and expanded 
Save sheets, as it was prior to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. It seems more 
confusing to have the contents of this menu change based on whether 
the Save sheet is expanded or not. 
 
 Switch between the basic and expanded Save sheets a few times by 
clicking the disclosure button. Make sure you see and understand the 
difference between what you see in the Where menu in a basic Save 
sheet and what you see in the Where menu in an expanded Save sheet.
 
3. To begin navigating the expanded Save sheet to find the folder where 
you want to save your file, choose among views by clicking the Icon, 
List, or Column view button. (The buttons look like their counterparts 
in Finder windows.)
 
 Click and hold the Icon view button and you see Icon Size and Label 
Position menus appear; use these to choose size and label position for 
icons in Save sheets, using Icon view. Your choices remain in effect in Icon 
view in the Save sheets of all applications until you click and hold the 
Icon view button to change them again. 
 
 In Icon view, you double-click a folder to open it. List view offers no dis-
closure button (as you see in List view Finder windows), so you double-
click folders to open them and see their contents. In Column view, 
you click an item on the left to see its contents on the right, just as you 
do in a Column view Finder window.
 
 You can also use the Forward and Back buttons or the Sidebar, both 
available only in an expanded Save dialog, to conveniently navigate your 
disk. Many of these navigation aids work just like the ones in the Finder; 
flip to Chapter 5 for more details.
 
 You can enlarge the Save sheet to see more the same way you enlarge 
a Finder window — drag the lower-right corner of the sheet down or to 
the right.
 
 If you can’t find the folder in which you want to save your document, 
type the folder’s name in the Search box. It works just like the Search 
box in a Finder window, as shown in Chapter 5. You don’t even have to 
press Enter or Return; the Save sheet updates itself to show you only 
items that match the characters as you’ve typed them.

4. Select the folder where you want to save your file in the Where pop-up 
menu. If you want to create a new subfolder of the selected folder to 
save your file in, click the New Folder button, give the new folder a 
name, and then save your file in it.
 
 In Figure 6-7, I’ve selected an existing folder named Novels. You can tell 
it’s selected because its name is displayed in the Where menu and high-
lighted below that in the first column.
 
 The selected folder is where your file will be saved.
 
 The keyboard shortcut for New Folder is $+Ô+N regardless of whether 
you’re in a Save sheet or the Finder. If I wanted to create a new folder 
inside the Novels folder in Figure 6-7, I could have clicked the New 
Folder button or pressed the shortcut.
 
5. In the File Format pop-up menu, make sure the format selected is the 
one you want.
 
6. If you want to turn off the display of file extensions (such as .rtf, 
.pdf, or .txt) in Save sheets, select the Hide Extension check box.

7. Double-check the Where pop-up menu one last time to make sure the 
correct folder is selected. Then click the Save button to save the file to 
the active folder.
 
 If you click Save, the file now appears in the folder you selected. If you 
change your mind about saving this file, clicking Cancel dismisses 
the Save sheet without saving anything anywhere. In other words, the 
Cancel button returns things to the way they were before you displayed 
the Save sheet.

144
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
After you’ve saved a file for the first time, choosing File➪Save or pressing Ô+S 
doesn’t bring up a Save sheet anymore. It just saves the file again without any 
further intervention on your part. Get into the habit of pressing Ô+S often. It 
can’t hurt — and just might save your bacon someday.
 
In Figures 6-5, 6-6, and 6-7 I used the Save sheet for TextEdit as an example. In 
programs other than TextEdit the Save sheet might contain additional options, 
fewer options, or different options, and therefore might look slightly different. 
For example, the File Format menu is a feature specific to TextEdit; it might not 
appear in other applications’ Save sheets. Don’t worry. The Save sheet always 
works the same way, no matter what options it offers.
Looks like Save, acts like Save — 
why’s it called Save As?
The Save As command — which you can find on the File menu of most pro-
grams (at least those that create documents) — lets you resave a file that has 
already been saved by giving it a different name.
Why would you want to do that? Here’s a good (albeit kind of rude) example:
Suppose you have two cousins, Kate and Nancy. You write Kate a long, chatty 
letter and save this document with the name Letter to Kate. At some point 
afterward, you decide you want to send almost the same letter to Nancy, too, 
but you want to change a few things. So you change the part about your date 
last night (Nancy isn’t as liberated as Kate) and replace all references to Kate’s 
husband, Kevin, with Nancy’s husband, Norman. (Aren’t computers grand?)
So you make all these changes to Letter to Kate, but you haven’t saved 
this document yet. And although the document on your screen is actually a 
letter to Nancy, its filename is still Letter to Kate. Think of what would 
happen if you were to save it now without using the Save As feature: Letter 
to Kate reflects the changes that you just made (the stuff in the letter 
meant for Kate is blown away, replaced by the stuff that you just wrote to 
Nancy). Thus the filename Letter to Kate is inaccurate. Even worse, you 
would no longer have a copy of the original letter you sent to Kate!
The solution? Just use Save As to rename this file Letter to Nancy by 
choosing File➪Save As. A Save sheet appears, in which you can type a differ-
ent filename in the Save As field. You can also navigate to another folder, if 
you like, and save the newly named version of the file there.

145
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
Now you have two distinct files: Letter to Kate and Letter to Nancy. 
Both contain the stuff they should, but both started life from the same file. 
That’s what Save As is for.
What’s really going on here: Save As lets you open a previously saved and named 
document, make some changes to it, and then save its contents again with a 
different filename — leaving the original document and filename unaltered.
Here’s another reason you might use Save As: If you had a .tiff graphic 
file open in Preview and wanted to convert it to a .jpeg file, you’d do so by 
using Save As.
Tabbing around the Save sheet
In the expanded view, if you press the Tab key 
while the Save As field is active, it becomes 
inactive, and the Search box becomes active. 
Press Tab again, and the Sidebar becomes 
active. Press the Tab key one more time, and 
the file list box (more accurately known as the 
detail pane — the part with Icon, List, Column, 
or Cover Flow view in it) becomes active. That’s 
because the file list box, the Search box, the 
Sidebar, and the Save As field are mutually 
exclusive. Only one can be active at any time.
You can always tell which item is active by the 
thin blue or gray border around it.
When you want to switch to a different folder 
to save a file, click the folder in the Sidebar or 
click anywhere in the file list box to make the 
file list active.
The following tricks help you get a hold on this 
whole active/inactive silliness:
 ✓ Look for the thin blue border that shows you 
which part of the Save sheet is active.
 ✓ If you type while the file list box is active, 
the list box selects the folder that most 
closely matches the letter(s) that you type. 
It’s a little strange because you won’t see 
what you type: You’ll be typing blind, so to 
speak. Go ahead and give it a try.
 ✓ When the file list is active, the letters that 
you type don’t appear in the Save As field. 
If you want to type a filename, you have to 
activate the Save As field again (by clicking 
in it or using the Tab key) before you can 
type in it.
 ✓ If you type while the Sidebar is active, noth-
ing happens. You can, however, use the up- 
and down-arrow keys to move around in 
the Sidebar.
 ✓ Regardless of which box or field is active at 
the time, when you press the Tab key, the 
next in sequence becomes active.
 ✓ Pressing Shift reverses the order of the 
sequence. If you press Shift+Tab, the active 
item moves from the Save As field to the file 
list box to the Sidebar to the Search box and 
back to the Save As field again.
 
 If you don’t feel like pressing the Tab key, 
you can achieve the same effect by clicking 
the file list box, the Sidebar, or the Save As 
field to make it active.

146
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
An even better idea is to choose Save As just before you begin modifying the 
document — and give it the new name. That way, when you’re done with your 
changes, you don’t have to remember to choose Save As — you can just per-
form your habitual Save. This approach also protects you from accidentally 
saving part of the letter to Nancy without changing its name first (which 
you’re likely to do if you’re following my advice about saving often). So when 
you decide you’re going to reuse a document, Save As before you begin work-
ing on it, just to be safe.
Open Sez Me
You can open any icon — whether it’s a file or a folder — in at least six ways. 
(Okay, there are at least seven ways, but one of them belongs to aliases, 
which I discuss in Chapter 5.) Anyway, here are the ways:
 
✓ Click the icon once to select it and then choose File➪Open.
 
✓ Click the icon twice in rapid succession.
 
 If the icon doesn’t open, you double-clicked too slowly. You can test 
(and adjust) your mouse’s sensitivity to double-click speed in the  
Mouse System Preference pane, which you can access by launching the 
System Preferences application (from the Applications folder, the Dock, 
or the Ú menu) and then clicking the Mouse icon.
 
✓ Select the icon and then press either Ô+O or Ô+↓.
 
✓ Right-click or Control+click it and then choose Open from the contextual 
menu.
 
✓ If the icon is a document, drag it onto an application icon (or the Dock 
icon of an application) that can open that type of document.
 
✓ If the icon is a document, right-click or Control+click it and then choose 
an application from the Open With submenu of the contextual menu.
 
Of course, you can also open any document icon from within an application. 
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Just launch your favorite program and choose File➪Open (or press 
Ô+O, which works in 98 percent of all Mac programs ever made).
 
 An Open dialog appears, like the one shown in Figure 6-8.
 
 When you use a program’s Open dialog, only files that the program knows 
how to open appear enabled (in black rather than light gray) in the file 
list. In effect, the program filters out the files it can’t open, so you barely 

147
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
see them in the Open dialog. This method of selectively displaying certain 
items in Open dialogs is a feature of most applications. Therefore, when 
you’re using TextEdit, its Open dialog dims all your spreadsheet files 
(that’s because TextEdit can open only text, Rich Text, Microsoft Word, 
and some picture files). Pretty neat, eh?
 
2. In the dialog, simply navigate to the file you want to open (using the 
same techniques you use in a Save sheet).
 
3. Select your file and click the Open button.
 
 If I were to click the Open button in Figure 6-8, the file Shiny Novel would 
open in TextEdit, the program I’m using.
For what it’s worth, some applications allow you to select multiple files in 
their Open dialogs by holding down either Shift (for contiguous selections) or 
Ô (for non-contiguous selections). If you need to open several files it’s worth 
a try; the worst thing that could happen is that it won’t work and you have to 
open the items one at a time. 
 
Some programs — such as AppleWorks, Microsoft Word, and Adobe Photoshop —
have a Show or Format menu in their Open dialogs. This menu lets you specify 
the type(s) of files you want to see in the Open dialog. You can usually open a 
file that appears dimmed by choosing All Documents from the Show or Format 
menu (in those applications with Open dialogs that offer such a menu).
Mac OS X also offers a few tricks that help you find files you want to open — 
as well as decide what application opens a file. Check out the following 
sections for more tips, tricks, and troubleshooting help.

With a Quick Look
The Quick Look command displays the contents of the currently selected file 
in a floating window without launching an application, as shown in Figure 6-9. 
This feature can be handy if you want to peek at the contents of a file before 
you open it, to make sure you have the right one. Simply select the file and 
then choose File➪Quick Look, press Ô+Y, or, easiest of all, merely press the 
spacebar.
The bad news is that while Quick Look works with many types of files — 
Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, plain text, PDF, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, and most types 
of audio and video — it doesn’t work with all files. You’ll know it didn’t work if 
Quick Look shows you a big document icon instead of the contents of that file. 
 
To get the window to occupy the entire screen (Slideshow mode), do any of 
the following:
 
✓ Hold down Option and choose File➪Slideshow. 
 
✓ Press Ô+Option+Y. 
 
✓ If your file is already open in the Quick Look window, click the double-
diagonal-arrow button at the bottom of the window. 
In Slideshow (full-screen) mode, press Esc to return to the Quick Look 
window.

If you select multiple items before you invoke Quick Look, a set of slideshow 
controls appears at the bottom of the Quick Look window (or screen if you’re 
viewing it as a slideshow) to let you move forward or backward one item at a 
time, or view all of the selected items at the same time (called an index sheet).

 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
When you’re finished with Quick Look window, click the X button in the top-
left corner or press Ô+Y to close it. 
With drag-and-drop
Macintosh drag-and-drop is usually all about dragging text and graphics from 
one place to another. But there’s another angle to drag-and-drop — one that 
has to do with files and icons.
You can open a document by dragging its icon onto that of the proper appli-
cation. For example, you can open a document created with Microsoft Word 
by dragging the document icon onto the Microsoft Word application’s icon. 
The Word icon highlights, and the document launches. Of course, it’s usually 
easier to just double-click a document’s icon to open it; the proper applica-
tion opens automatically when you do — or at least it does most of the time. 
Which reminds me. . . .
When your Mac can’t open a file
If you try to open a file but Mac OS X can’t find a program to open the file, 
Mac OS X prompts you with an alert window, as shown in Figure 6-10. You can 
either click Cancel (and abort the attempt to open the file) or click the Choose 
Application button to pick another application to use for opening the file.
 
Figure 6-10: 
Oops! Mac 
OS X helps 
you find 
the correct 
application.
 
If you click the Choose Application button, a dialog appears (conveniently 
opened to your Applications folder and shown in Figure 6-11). Applications 
that Mac OS X doesn’t think can be used to open the file are dimmed. 
For a wider choice of applications, choose All Applications (instead of 
Recommended Applications) from the Enable pop-up menu.

If you see an alert that says a file can’t be opened because it’s an unsupported 
file format or a format not supported in 64-Bit mode (as shown in Figure 6-12), 
try selecting “Open in 32-Bit Mode” in the document’s Info window (File➪Get 
Info; shortcut Ô+I). 
 
Snow Leopard is the first version of Mac OS X that runs in 64-bit mode on Intel 
processors that support 64-bit processing. What that means is that your Mac 
can theoretically process data in bigger chunks than an older 32-bit processor. 
(The actual difference in performance between 64-bit and 32-bit processors is, 
for a variety of reasons, much less than 2X.)

type of 
“can’t open 
this file”

You can’t open every file with every program. For example, if you try to open 
an MP3 (audio) file with Microsoft Excel (a spreadsheet), it just won’t work — 
you get an error message or a screen full of gibberish. Sometimes you just 
have to keep trying until you find the right program; other times, you don’t 
have a program that can open the file.

151
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
With the application of your choice
I don’t know about you, but people send me files all the time that were created 
by applications I don’t use . . . or at least that I don’t use for that document type. 
Mac OS X lets you specify the application in which you want to open a document 
in the future when you double-click it. More than that, you can specify that you 
want all documents of that type to open with the specified application. “Where is 
this magic bullet hidden?” you ask. Right there in the file’s Info window.
Assigning a file type to an application
Suppose you want all .tiff graphic files that usually open in Preview to 
open in GraphicConverter (one of my favorite pieces of OS X–savvy share-
ware) instead. Here’s what to do:
 
1. Click one of the files in the Finder.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info (Ô+I).
 
3. In the Info window, click the gray triangle to disclose the Open With 
pane.
 
4. From the pop-up menu, choose from the applications that Mac OS X 
believes will open this document type.
 
 In Figure 6-13, I’m choosing GraphicConverter. Now GraphicConverter 
opens when I double-click this particular file.
 
5. (Optional) If you click the Change All button at the bottom of the 
Open With pane (you can’t see it in Figure 6-13 because it’s hidden by 
the pop-up menu), you make GraphicConverter the default application 
for all .tiff files that would otherwise be opened in Preview.

Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
Opening a file with an application other than the default
 
Here’s one more technique that works great when you want to open a docu-
ment with a program other than its default. Just drag the file onto the appli-
cation’s icon or alias icon or Dock icon, and presto — the file opens in the 
application.
For example, if I were to double-click an MP3 file, the file would usually open 
in iTunes. But I frequently want to listen to MP3 files using QuickTime Player 
(so they’re not added to my iTunes music library). Dragging the MP3 file onto 
QuickTime Player’s icon in the Applications folder or its Dock icon (if it’s in 
the Dock) solves this conundrum quickly and easily.
 
If the icon doesn’t highlight and you release the mouse button anyway, the file 
ends up in the same folder as the application with the icon that didn’t high-
light. If that happens, just choose Edit➪Undo (or press Ô+Z), and the mislaid 
file magically returns to where it was before you dropped it. Just remember — 
don’t do anything else after you drop the file, or Undo might not work. If Undo 
doesn’t work, you must move the file back to its original location manually.
Only applications that might be able to open the file highlight when you drag 
the file on them. That doesn’t mean the document will be usable — just that the 
application can open it. Suffice to say that Mac OS X is smart enough to figure 
out which applications on your hard drive can open what documents — and to 
offer you a choice.
Organizing Your Stuff in Folders
I won’t pretend to be able to organize your Mac for you. Organizing your files 
is as personal as your taste in music; you develop your own style with the 
Mac. But now that you know how to open and save documents when you’re 
using applications, these sections provide food for thought — some ideas 
about how I organize things — and some suggestions that can make organiza-
tion easier for you regardless of how you choose to do it yourself.
The upcoming sections look at the difference between a file and a folder, how 
to set up nested folders, and how some special folder features work. After you 
have a good handle on these things, you’ll almost certainly be a savvier — and 
better organized — Mac OS X user.
Files versus folders
When I speak of a file, I’m talking about what’s connected to any icon except 
a folder or disk icon. A file can be a document, an application, an alias of a file 

153
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
or an application, a dictionary, a font, or any other icon that isn’t a folder or 
disk. The main distinction is that you can’t put something into most file icons.
 
The exceptions are icons that represent Mac OS X packages. A package is an 
icon that acts like a file but isn’t. Examples of icons that are really packages 
include many software installers and applications as well as “documents” 
saved by some programs (such as Keynote, GarageBand, or TextEdit files 
saved in its .rtfd format). When you open an icon that represents a package 
the usual way (double-click, File➪Open, Ô+O, and so on), the program or doc-
ument opens. If you want to see the contents of an icon that represents a pack-
age, you have to Control+click the icon first and then choose Show Package 
Contents from the contextual menu. If you see that item, the icon is a package, 
and you can see the files and folders it contains by choosing Show Package 
Contents; if you don’t see a Show Package Contents item on the contextual 
menu, the icon represents a file, not a package.
 
 When I talk about folders, I’m talking about things that work like manila folders 
in the real world. Their icons look like folders, like the one in the margin to 
the left; they can contain files or other folders, called subfolders. You can put 
any icon — any file or folder — into a folder.
 
Here’s an exception: If you try to put a disk icon into a folder, all you get is 
an alias to the disk unless you hold down the Option key. Remember that you 
can’t put a disk icon into a folder that exists on the disk itself. In other words, 
you can copy a disk icon only to a different disk; you can never copy a disk 
icon into a folder that resides on that disk. For more about aliases, flip to 
Chapter 5; for details on working with disks, see Chapter 7.
 
File icons can look like practically anything. If the icon doesn’t look like a 
folder or one of the numerous disk icons, you can be pretty sure it’s a file.
Organizing your stuff with subfolders
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can put folders inside other folders to 
organize your icons. A folder that’s inside another folder is called a subfolder.
You can create subfolders according to whatever system makes sense to you — 
but why reinvent the wheel? Here are some organizational topic ideas and 
naming examples for subfolders:
 
✓ By type of document: Word-Processing Documents, Spreadsheet 
Documents, Graphics Documents
 
✓ By date: Documents May–June, Documents Spring ’03
 
✓ By content: Memos, Outgoing Letters, Expense Reports
 
✓ By project: Project X, Project Y, Project Z

When you notice your folders swelling and starting to get messy (that is, filling 
up with tons of files), subdivide them again by using a combination of these 
methods that makes sense to you. Suppose you start by subdividing your 
Documents folder into multiple subfolders. Later, when those folders begin to 
get full, you can subdivide them even further, as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
Figure 6-14: 
Before 
(left) and 
after (right)

and Finance 
folders with 
subfolders.
 
Creating subfolders . . . or not
How full is too full? When should you begin 
creating subfolders? That’s impossible to say, 
at least in a one-size-fits-all way, but having too 
many items in a folder can be a nightmare — as 
can having too many subfolders with just one or 
two files in each one. My guideline is this: If you 
find more than 15 or 20 files in a single folder, 
begin thinking about ways to subdivide it.
On the other hand, some of my bigger subfold-
ers contain things that I don’t often access. For 
example, my Bob’s Correspondence 1992 folder 
contains more than 200 files. But because I 
want to keep this folder on my hard drive in 
case I do need to find something there — even 
though I don’t use it very often — its over-
crowded condition doesn’t bother me. (Your 
mileage may vary.)
Here are some tips to help you decide whether to 
use subfolders or just leave well enough alone:
 ✓ Don’t create subfolders until you need 
them. In other words, don’t create a bunch 
of empty folders because you think you 
might need them someday. Wait to create 
new folders until you need them; that way, 
you avoid opening an empty folder when 
you’re looking for something else — a com-
plete waste of time.
 ✓ Let your work style decide the file struc-
ture. When you first start working with your 
Mac, you might want to save everything in 
your Documents folder for a week or two 
(or a month or two, depending on how 
many new documents you save each day). 
When a decent-sized group of documents 
has accumulated in the Documents folder, 
consider taking a look at them and creating 
logical subfolders for them.

155
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
My point (yes, I do have one!): Allow your folder structure to be organic, 
growing as you need it to grow. Let it happen. Don’t let any one folder get so 
full that it’s a hassle to deal with. Create new subfolders when things start to 
get crowded. (I explain how to create folders in the next section.)
 
If you want to monkey around with some subfolders yourself, a good place to 
start is the Documents folder — it’s inside your Home folder (that is, the 
Documents folder is a subfolder of your Home folder).
If you use a particular folder a great deal, put it in your Dock or make an alias 
of it and move the alias from the Documents folder to your Home folder or 
to your Desktop (for more info on aliases, see Chapter 5) to make the folder 
easier to access. Or drag the folder (or its alias) to the Sidebar, where it’s 
always available, even in Open dialogs and Save sheets. For example, if you 
write a lot of letters, you could keep an alias to your Correspondence folder 
in your Home folder, in the Dock, or on your Desktop for quick access. (By 
the way, there’s no reason you can’t have a folder appear in all three places if 
you like. That’s what aliases are all about, right?)
 
If you create your own subfolders in the Documents folder, you can click it in the 
Dock to reveal them, as shown in Figure 6-15. I show you how to customize
the Dock in Chapter 4.
 
Figure 6-15: 
It’s super-
convenient 
to have your 
Documents 
folder in the 
Dock.
 
 
It’s even more convenient if you choose to view the Documents folder as a 
“List” as described in Chapter 4!

Creating new folders
So you think Apple has already given you enough folders? Can’t imagine why 
you’d need more? Think of creating new folders the same way you’d think of 
labeling a new folder at work for a specific project. New folders help you keep 
your files organized, enabling you to reorganize them just the way you want. 
Creating folders is really quite simple.
To create a new folder, just follow these steps:
 
1. Decide which window you want the new folder to appear in — and 
then make sure that window is active.
 
 If you want to create a new folder right on the Desktop, make sure no 
window is active.
 
 You can make a window active by clicking it, and you can make the Desktop 
active if you have windows on-screen by clicking the Desktop itself.
 
2. Choose File➪New Folder (or press $+Ô+N).
 
 A new, untitled folder appears in the active window with its name box 
already highlighted, ready for you to type a new name for it.
 
3. Type a name for your folder.
 
 If you accidentally click anywhere before you type a name for the folder, 
the name box is no longer highlighted. To highlight it again, select the 
icon (single-click it) and then press Return (or Enter) once. Now you can 
type its new name.
 
 Give your folders relevant names. Folders with nebulous titles like 
sfdghb or Stuff — or, worst of all, Untitled — won’t make it any 
easier to find something six months from now.
 
 For folders and files you might share with users of non-Macintosh 
computers, here’s the rule for maximum compatibility: no punctua-
tion and no Option-key characters in the folder name. Periods, slashes, 
backslashes, and colons in particular can be reserved for use by other 
operating systems. When I say Option key characters, I’m talking about 
special-purpose ones such as ™ (Option+2), ® (Option+R), ¢ (Option+4), 
and even © (Option+G).
Navigating with spring-loaded folders
A spring-loaded folder pops open when you drag something onto it without 
releasing the mouse button. Spring-loaded folders work with all folder or disk 
icons in all views and in the Sidebar. Because you just got the short course on 

157
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
folders and subfolders and various ways to organize your stuff, you’re ready 
for your introduction to one of my favorite ways to get around my disks, fold-
ers, and subfolders.
Here’s how spring-loaded folders work:
 
1. Select any icon except a disk icon.
 
 The folder highlights to indicate that it’s selected.
 
2. Drag the selected icon onto any folder or disk icon — but don’t 
release the mouse button.
 
 I call this hovering because you’re doing just that — hovering the cursor 
over a folder or disk icon without releasing the button.
 
 In a second or two, the highlighted folder or disk flashes twice and then 
springs open, right under the cursor.
 
 You can press the spacebar to make the folder spring open immediately.
 
3. After the folder springs open, some more handy operations are possible:
 
• You can continue to traverse your folder structure this way. 
Subfolders continue to pop open until you release the mouse 
button.
 
• If you release the mouse button, the icon you’ve been dragging is 
dropped into the active folder at the time. That window remains 
open — but all the windows you traversed clean up after them-
selves by closing automatically, leaving your window clean and 
uncluttered.
 
• If you want to cancel a spring-loaded folder, drag the cursor away 
from the folder icon or outside the boundaries of the sprung 
window — and the folder pops shut.
 
After you get used to spring-loaded folders, you’ll wonder how you ever got 
along without them. They work in all four window views, and they work with 
icons in the Sidebar or Dock. Give ’em a try, and you’ll be hooked.
You can toggle spring-loaded folders on or off in the Finder’s Preferences 
window. There’s also a setting for how long the Finder waits before it springs 
the folders open. See Chapter 5 for more on Finder preferences.
Smart Folders
Now, as Steve Jobs is fond of saying near the end of his annual keynote 
addresses, “There is one more thing.” Those things are called Smart Folders.

158
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
Smart Folders let you save search criteria and then tell them to work in 
the background to reflect those criteria in real time. In other words, Smart 
Folders are updated continuously, so they always find all the files on your 
computer that match the search criteria. So, for example, you can create 
a Smart Folder that contains all the Rich Text files on your computer that 
you’ve opened in the past two weeks, as shown in Figure 6-16. Or create 
a Smart Folder that displays graphics files, but only the ones bigger (or 
smaller) than a specified file size. Then all those files appear in one conve-
nient Smart Folder.
 
Figure 6-16: 
A Smart 
Folder that 
gathers only 
Rich Text 
files created 
in the past 
two weeks.
 
The possibilities are endless. And because Smart Folders use alias-like tech-
nology to display items, the actual files reside in only one location — the 
folder where you originally put them. True to their name, Smart Folders don’t 
gather the files themselves in a separate place; rather, they gather aliases of 
files, leaving the originals right where you stashed them. Neat!
Also, because Spotlight (discussed in the final section of this chapter) is built 
deep into the bowels of the Mac OS X file system and kernel, Smart Folders 
are always current, even if you’ve added or deleted files on your hard drive 
since you created the Smart Folder.
 
Don’t forget to take advantage of the six useful Smart Folders in the Sidebar 
by default: Today, Yesterday, Past Week, All Images, All Movies, and All 
Documents. Or, if those don’t suit you, get rid of them and replace them with 
Smart Folders that do suit you.
Smart Folders are so useful that Apple provides five different ways to create 
one. The following steps show you how:
 
1. Start your Smart Folder using any of the following methods:
 
• Choose File➪New Smart Folder from the Finder menu bar.
 
• Press Ô+Option+N.

159
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
• Choose File➪Find.
 
• Press Ô+F.
 
• Type at least one character into the Search box in a Finder window.
 
2. Refine the criteria for your search by clicking the + button to add a 
criterion or the – button to delete one.
 
3. When you’re satisfied and ready to turn your criteria into a Smart 
Folder, click the Save button below the Search box.
 
 A sheet drops down.
 
4. Choose where you want to save your folder.
 
 While the Save sheet is displayed, you can add the Smart Folder to the 
Sidebar if you like by clicking the Add to Sidebar check box.
 
5. When you’re finished editing criteria, click the Save button to save 
the folder with its criteria.
After you create your Smart Folder, you can move it anywhere on any hard 
drive and then use it like any other folder. If you want to change the criteria 
for a Smart Folder, open it and click the Action menu button and choose Show 
Search Criteria, as shown in Figure 6-17 or right-click the folder. Then click the 
Save button to resave your folder. You might be asked whether you want to 
replace the previous Smart Folder of the same name; you (usually) do.
Smart Folders have a little gear on them so you can tell them apart from 
regular folders.

160
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
Except for the Today, Yesterday, and Past Week Smart Folders in the sidebar, 
which don’t look like folders at all. Those three, for whatever reason, look like 
little clocks instead. And as far as I can tell, we mere mortals can’t create our 
own Smart Folders that look like clocks. What’s up with that?
Smart Folders can save you a lot of time and effort, so if you haven’t played 
with them much (or at all) yet, be sure to give ’em a try.
Shuffling Around Files and Folders
Sometimes keeping files and folders organized means moving them from one 
place to another. Other times, you want to copy them, rename them, or com-
press them to send to a friend. These sections explain all those things and more.
 
All the techniques I discuss in the following sections work at least as well for 
windows that use List or Column view as they do for windows that use Icon view. 
I use Icon view in the figures in this section only because it’s the best view for 
pictures to show you what’s going on. For what it’s worth, I find moving and 
copying files much easier in windows that use List or Column view.
Comprehending the Clipboard
Before you start moving your files around, let me introduce you to the 
Clipboard. The Clipboard is a holding area for the last thing that you cut or 
copied. That copied item can be text, a picture, a portion of a picture, an 
object in a drawing program, a column of numbers in a spreadsheet, any icon 
(except a disk), or just about anything else that can be selected. In other 
words, the Clipboard is the Mac’s temporary storage area.
Most of the time, the Clipboard works quietly in the background, but you can 
ask the Clipboard to reveal itself by choosing Edit➪Show Clipboard from the 
Finder menu bar. This command summons the Clipboard window, which lists 
the type of item (such as text, picture, or sound) on the Clipboard — and a 
message letting you know whether the item on the Clipboard can be 
displayed.
As a storage area, the Clipboard’s contents are temporary. Very temporary. 
When you cut or copy an item, that item remains on the Clipboard only until 
you cut or copy something else. When you do cut or copy something else, 
the new item replaces the Clipboard’s contents and the newcomer remains 
on the Clipboard until you cut or copy something else. And so it goes.

161
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
Of course, whatever is on the Clipboard heads straight for oblivion if you 
crash, lose power, log out, or shut down your Mac, so don’t count on it too 
heavily or for too long.
 
The Clipboard commands on the Edit menu are enabled only when they can 
actually be used. If the currently selected item can be cut or copied, the Cut 
and Copy commands in the Edit menu are enabled. If the selected item can’t 
be cut or copied, the commands are unavailable and are dimmed (gray). If the 
Clipboard is empty or the current document can’t accept what’s on the 
Clipboard, the Paste command is dimmed. Finally, when nothing is selected, 
the Cut, Copy, and Clear commands are dimmed.
Icons cannot be cut; they can only be copied or pasted. So when an icon is 
selected, the Cut command is always gray.
Copying files and folders
One way to copy icons from one place to another is to use the Clipboard.
When a file or folder icon is selected, choose Edit➪Copy (or use its shortcut, 
Ô+C) to copy the selected icon to the Clipboard. Note that this doesn’t delete 
the selected item, but just makes a copy of it on the Clipboard. To then paste the 
copied icon in another location, choose Edit➪Paste (or use its shortcut, Ô+V).
Other methods of copying icons from one place to another include these:
 
✓ Drag an icon from one folder icon onto another folder icon while 
holding down the Option key. Release the mouse button when the 
second folder is highlighted. This technique works regardless of whether 
the second folder’s window is open. If you don’t hold down the Option 
key, you move the icon to a new location rather than copy it, as I explain 
a little later in this section.
 
 
 When you copy something by dragging and dropping it with the Option 
key held down, the cursor changes to include a little plus sign (+) next to 
the arrow, as shown in the margin. Neat!
 
✓ Drag an icon into an open window for another folder while holding 
down the Option key. Drag the icon for the file or folder that you want 
to copy into the open window for a second folder (or other hard disk or 
removable media such as a USB flash drive).
 
✓ Choose File➪Duplicate (Ô+D) or Control+click the file or folder that 
you want to duplicate and then choose Duplicate from the contextual 
menu that appears. This makes a copy of the selected icon, adds the 

162
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
word copy to its name, and then places the copy in the same window 
as the original icon. You can use the Duplicate command on any icon 
except a disk icon.
 
 You can’t duplicate an entire disk onto itself. But you can copy an entire 
disk (call it Disk 1) to any other actual, physical, separate disk (call it 
Disk 2) — as long as Disk 2 has enough space available. Just hold down 
Option and drag Disk 1 onto Disk 2’s icon. The contents of Disk 1 are 
copied to Disk 2 and appear on Disk 2 in a folder named Disk 1.
You can cut an icon’s name, but you can’t cut the icon itself; you may only 
copy an icon.
 
To achieve the effect of cutting an icon, select the icon, copy it to the Clipboard, 
paste it in its new location, and then move the original icon to the Trash.
If you’re wondering why anyone would ever want to copy a file, trust me: 
Someday you will. Suppose that you have a file called Long Letter to Mom 
in a folder called Old Correspondence. You figure that Mom has forgotten 
that letter by now, and you want to send it again. But before you do, you want 
to change the date and delete the reference to Clarence, her pit bull, who 
passed away last year. So now you need to put a copy of Long Letter to 
Mom in your Current Correspondence folder. This technique yields the same 
result as making a copy of a file by using Save As, which I describe earlier in 
this chapter.
 
When you copy a file, it’s wise to change the name of the copied file. Having 
more than one file on your hard drive with exactly the same name isn’t a good 
idea, even if the files are in different folders. Trust me, having 10 files called 
Expense Report or 15 files named Doctor Mac Consulting Invoice 
can be confusing, no matter how well organized your folder structure is. 
Add distinguishing words or dates to file and folder names so they’re named 
something more explicit, such as Expense Report 10-03 or Doctor Mac 
Consulting Invoice 4-4-05.
 
You can have lots of files with the same name on the same disk (although, as 
I mention earlier, it’s probably not a good idea). But your Mac won’t let you 
have more than one file with the same name and extension (.txt, .jpg, 
.doc) in the same folder.
Pasting from the Clipboard
As I mention previously, to place the icon that’s on the Clipboard someplace 
new, click where you want the item to go and then choose Edit➪Paste or use 
the keyboard shortcut Ô+V to paste what you’ve copied or cut.

163
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
 
Pasting doesn’t purge the contents of the Clipboard. In fact, an item stays on 
the Clipboard until you cut, copy, restart, shut down, log out, or crash. This 
means that you can paste the same item over and over and over again, which 
can come in pretty handy at times.
Almost all programs have an Edit menu and use the Macintosh Clipboard, 
which means you can usually cut or copy something from a document in one 
program and paste it into a document in another program.
Usually.
Moving files and folders
You can move files and folders around within a window to your heart’s con-
tent as long as that window is set to Icon view. Just click and drag any icon to 
its new location in the window.
Some people spend hours arranging icons in a window until they’re just so. 
But because using Icon view wastes so much screen space, I avoid using 
icons in a window.
 
You can’t move icons around in a window that is displayed as a List, Columns, 
or Cover Flow, which makes total sense when you think about it. (Well, you 
can move them to put them in a different folder in List, Column, or Cover Flow 
view, but that’s not moving them around, really.)
As you might expect from Apple by now, you have choices for how you move 
one file or folder into another folder. You can use these techniques to move 
any icon — folder, document, alias, or program icon — into folders or onto 
other disks.
 
✓ Drag an icon onto a folder icon: Drag the icon for one folder (or file) 
onto the icon for another folder (or disk) and then release when the 
second icon is highlighted (see Figure 6-18). The first folder is now 
inside the second folder. Put another way, the first folder is now a sub-
folder of the second folder.
 
 This technique works regardless of whether the second folder’s window 
is open.
 
✓ Drag an icon into an open folder’s window: Drag the icon for one folder 
(or file) into the open window for a second folder (or disk), as shown in 
Figure 6-19.

164

Figure 6-18:

If you want to move an item from one disk to another disk, you can’t use the 
preceding tricks. Your item is copied, not moved. If you want to move a file or 
folder from one disk to another, you have to hold down the Ô key when you 
drag an icon from one disk to another. The little Copying Files window even 
changes to read Moving Files. Nice touch, eh?

Selecting multiple icons
Sometimes you want to move or copy several items into a single folder. The 
process is pretty much the same as it is when you copy one file or folder 
(that is, you just drag the icon to where you want it and drop it there). But 
you first need to select all the items you want before you can drag them, en 
masse, to their destination.

165
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
If you want to move all the files in a particular folder, simply choose Edit➪
Select All or press Ô+A. This command selects all icons in the active window, 
regardless of whether you can see them onscreen. Or if no window is active, 
using Select All selects every icon on the Desktop.
 
But what if you want to select only some of the files in the active window or on 
the Desktop? Here’s the most convenient method:
 
1. To select more than one icon in a folder, do one of the following:
 
• Click once within the folder window (don’t click any one icon) and 
drag your mouse while continuing to hold down the mouse button. 
You see an outline of a box around the icons while you drag, and 
all icons within or touching the box become highlighted (see 
Figure 6-20).
 
• Click one icon and then hold down the Shift key while you click 
others. As long as you hold down the Shift key, each new icon that 
you click is added to the selection. To deselect an icon, click it a 
second time while still holding down the Shift key.
 
Figure 6-20: 
Select more 
than one 
icon with 
your mouse.
 
 
• Click one icon and then hold down the Command (Ô) key while you 
click others. The difference between using the Shift and Ô keys is 
that using the Ô key doesn’t select everything between it and the 
first item selected when your window is in List or Column view. In 
Icon view, it really doesn’t make much difference.
 
 To deselect an icon, click it while holding down the Ô key.
 
2. After you select the icons, click one of them (clicking anywhere else 
deselects the icons) and drag them to the location where you want to 
move them (or Option+drag to copy them).

166
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
Be careful with multiple selections, especially when you drag icons to the 
Trash. You can easily — and accidentally — select more than one icon, so 
watch out that you don’t accidentally put the wrong icon in the Trash by not 
paying close attention. (I detail how the Trash icon works later in this chapter.)
Playing the icon name game: 
Renaming icons
Icon, icon, bo-bicon, banana-fanna fo-ficon. Betcha can change the name of 
any old icon! Well, that’s not entirely true. . . .
 
If an icon is locked, busy (an application that’s currently open), or you don’t 
have the owner’s permission to rename that icon (see Chapter 15 for details 
about permissions), you can’t rename it. Similarly, you should never rename 
certain reserved icons (such as the Library, System, and Desktop folders).
To rename an icon, you can either click the icon’s name directly (don’t click 
the icon itself, because that selects the icon) or click the icon and then press 
Return (or Enter) once.
Either way, the icon’s name is selected and surrounded with a box, and you 
can now type a new name (as shown in Figure 6-21). In addition to select-
ing the name, the cursor changes from a pointer to a text-editing I-beam. An 
I-beam cursor is the Mac’s way of telling you that you can type now. At this 
point, if you click the I-beam cursor anywhere in the name box, you can edit 
the icon’s original name. If you don’t click the I-beam cursor in the name box 
but just begin typing, the icon’s original name is replaced by what you type.

If you’ve never changed an icon’s name, give it a try. And don’t forget: If you 
click the icon itself, the icon is selected, and you won’t be able to change its 
name. If you do accidentally select the icon, just press Return (or Enter) once 
to edit the name of the icon.

 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
Compressing files
 
If you’re going to send files as an e-mail enclosure, creating a compressed 
archive of the files first and sending the archive instead of the originals saves 
you time sending the files and saves the recipient time downloading them. To 
create this compressed archive, simply select the file or files and then choose 
File➪Compress. This creates a compressed .zip file out of your selection. 
The compressed file is smaller than the original — sometimes by quite a bit.
Getting rid of icons
To get rid of an icon — any icon — merely drag it to the Trash on your Dock.
Trashing an alias gets rid of only the alias, not the parent file. But trashing 
a document, folder, or application icon puts it in the Trash, where it will be 
deleted permanently the next time you empty the Trash. The Finder menu 
offers a couple of commands that help you manage the Trash:
 
✓ Finder➪Empty Trash: Deletes all items in the Trash from your hard 
drive — period.
 
 I’ll probably say this more than once: Use this command with a modicum 
of caution. After a file is dragged into the Trash and the Trash is emptied, 
the file is gone, gone, gone. (Okay, maybe ProSoft Engineering’s Data 
Rescue II or other third-party utility can bring it back, but I wouldn’t bet 
the farm on it.)
 
✓ Finder➪Secure Empty Trash: Choosing this option makes the chance 
of recovery by even the most ardent hacker or expensive disk-recovery 
tool difficult to virtually impossible. Now the portion of the disk that held 
the files you’re deleting will be overwritten with randomly generated 
gibberish.
 
If you put something in the Trash by accident, you can almost always return it 
whence it came: Just invoke the magical Undo command. Choose Edit➪Undo 
or press Ô+Z. The accidentally trashed file returns to its original location. 
Usually.
Unfortunately, Undo doesn’t work every time — and it remembers only the 
very last action that you performed when it does work — so don’t rely on it 
too much.

Finding Your Stuff, Fast
Even if you follow every single bit of advice provided in this chapter, a time 
will come when you won’t be able to find a file or folder, although you know 
for certain that it’s right there on your hard drive. Somewhere. Fortunately, 
Snow Leopard includes a fabulous technology called Spotlight that can help 
you find almost anything on any mounted disk in seconds. Spotlight can
 
✓ Search for files
 
✓ Search for folders
 
✓ Search for text inside documents
 
✓ Search for files and folders by their metadata (for example, creation 
date, modification date, kind, size, and so on)
Spotlight finds what you’re looking for and then organizes its results logically, 
all in the blink of an eye (on most Macs).
Spotlight is both a technology and a feature. The technology is pervasive 
throughout Snow Leopard — and is the underlying power behind the search 
boxes in many Apple applications and utilities such as Mail, Address Book, 
System Preferences, and Finder. You can also use it right from the Spotlight 
menu — the little magnifying glass on the right side of the menu bar. Also, 
you can reuse Spotlight searches in the future by turning them into Smart 
Folders (which I explain earlier in this chapter).
Finding files and folders has never been faster or easier than it is in Snow 
Leopard. So in these sections, I look at the two separate but related ways 
Spotlight helps you find files, folders, and even text inside document files — 
the Search box in Finder windows and the Spotlight menu.
 
In addition to the Spotlight tools discussed here, the Find command kicks 
some butt. Find out the details of how it works in Chapter 5.
The Search box in Finder Windows
If you used previous versions of Mac OS X, you might think you know how 
the Search box on the toolbar of Finder windows works. But you don’t. Even 
though it looks almost the same as before, it’s a Search box on major-league 
steroids. With its power provided by Spotlight, this definitely isn’t your 
father’s Search box.

169
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
So what’s new and different? Glad you asked. The following steps walk you 
through all the features:
 
1. Type a single character in the Search box.
 
 The window starts displaying the results, as shown in Figure 6-22.
 
2. (Optional) Limit your search by using the Search For items in the 
Sidebar.
 
 The default items are Today, Yesterday, Past Week, All Images, All 
Movies, and All Documents. Click one before you begin typing in the 
Search box to use it.
 
 If you want to change the criteria for one or more of these items, it’s 
the same as changing criteria for a Smart Folder — click the item in the 
Sidebar and then click the Action menu button and choose Show Search 
Criteria. When you’re done changing the search criteria, click the Save 
button to resave your folder.
 
Figure 6-22: 
As soon as 
you type the 
first char-
acter in the 
Search box, 
the results 
begin to 
appear.
 
 
3. If the folder or volume you want to search isn’t This Mac or your 
Home folder, open the folder you want to search and type your query 
into the Search box in that folder’s window. 
 
4. Click either the Contents or File Name button to search for the con-
tents of a document or the name of a file or folder. 
 
5. When you find the file or folder, you can open any item in the list by 
double-clicking it.
 
 Last but not least, if you want to know where a file or folder resides on 
your hard drive, look at the very bottom row of the window, where you 
can see the path to that file.

Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
So there you have it — fast searches made easy in the Finder. But there are 
many ways to access the power of Spotlight, and the Search box in the tool-
bar of Finder windows is merely one of them.
Using the Spotlight menu
Another way to search for files and folders is to use the Spotlight menu itself — 
the aqua-hued magnifying-glass icon at the far right in your menu bar. Click 
the icon to open Spotlight’s Search box and then type a character, word, or 
series of words in the Search box to find an item, as shown in Figure 6-23.
Another way to open the Spotlight Search box is with its keyboard shortcut, 
which is Ô+spacebar by default.
 
You can change this shortcut to whatever you like in the Spotlight System 
Preference pane.
 
Figure 6-23: 
Click the 
magnifying 
glass to 
reveal the 
Search box 
(left); type in 
the Search 
box, and 
your results 
appear 
instantly 
(right).
 
Spotlight is more than just a menu, though. You can also use the Spotlight 
window to create and perform more sophisticated searches.

171
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Files and Folders
You can access this window two ways:
 
✓ Click the Show All item in the Spotlight menu or press Ô+Option+
spacebar.
 
 You can change this shortcut to whatever you like in the Spotlight 
System Preference pane.
 
✓ In the Spotlight window, use the Search For items in the Sidebar — Today, 
Yesterday, Past Week, All Images, All Movies, and All Documents — to 
fine-tune your search.
 
✓ Use the criteria at the top of the window to narrow your search. 
 
 This is exactly the same process you used to create Smart Folders! The 
only difference is that you don’t need to click the Save button at the end 
to create a Smart Folder from your search. 
Regardless of which method you choose to invoke it — the Search box in a 
Finder window, the Spotlight Search box in the menu bar, or the Spotlight 
window — Spotlight saves you time and effort.
Finding files by color
If you’re the type of person who thinks in color, 
color labels (preferences for these labels are 
discussed in Chapter 5) offer another neat trick 
that helps you find files quickly. For the labels 
to work, you need to think ahead and choose 
File➪Color Label to apply a colored label to the 
selected icon. Then, when you want to find all 
the files that are tagged with a particular color, 
you can press Ô+F and choose the Color Labels 
option. Then simply select the color you’re look-
ing for.
Tip: When you’re applying colors, the Color 
Label item also appears on an icon’s contextual 
(Control+click) menu, which is often easier to 
use than the File menu.

Dealing with Disks
In This Chapter
▶ Initializing and erasing your disks
▶ Using PC-formatted disks
▶ Creating your own CDs and DVDs
▶ Ejecting disks
I
n this chapter, I show you disk basics: how to format them for your Mac, 
how to format them so your Windows-using brethren (and sisteren) can 
use them, how to eject them, how to copy or move files between disks, and 
much more. Onward!
This chapter offers lots of info that applies to every Mac user — including 
folder management and moving or copying files to and from disks other than
your internal hard drive. I also show you how to work with optical media such as 
CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD+R DL (dual-layer) — 
types of discs that many Mac users deal with regularly. You almost certainly 
have an internal SuperDrive (CD and DVD player/burner). Or you might have 
added external storage devices such as a USB flash drive, a USB or FireWire 
hard drive, or an optical disc player/recorder.
External drives may use magnetic “disks” or optical “discs” (the computer 
industry uses both spellings to mean “media used to store files;” see the 
accompanying sidebar). The bottom line is that they allow you to copy and 
move files easily so you can use them on other Macs or PCs.
Comprehending Disks
You should think of the disk icons that appear on the Desktop (and/or in the 
sidebars of Finder windows) as though they were folders. That’s because your 
Mac sees disks as nothing but giant folders. When you double-click one, its 
contents appear in a Finder window; to that extent, it works just like a folder. 
You can drag stuff in and out of a disk’s window, and you can manipulate the 
disk’s window in all the usual ways— again, just like a folder.

174
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
Although (for all intents and purposes) disks are folders, disks do behave in 
unique ways sometimes. The following sections explain what you need to know.
Some disks need to be formatted first
Brand-new disks sometimes need to be formatted — prepared to receive 
Macintosh files — before you can use them.
When you connect an unformatted hard disk, your Mac usually pops up a 
dialog that asks what you want to do with the disk. One option is usually to 
format (or initialize) the disk — that is, to get it ready to record data. If you 
choose to format the disk, the Disk Utility program launches itself so you can 
format the disk from the Erase tab.
If you ever need to format or initialize a blank disk and don’t see the dialog, 
all you have to do is open Disk Utility manually (it’s in your Applications/
Utilities folder) and use its Erase tab to format the disk.
Is that a disk or a disc?
So how do you spell this critter, anyway? 
Sometimes you see it spelled d-i-s-k; other 
times you see it spelled d-i-s-c. If you’re won-
dering what’s up with that, here’s the skinny. In 
the good old days, the only kind of computer 
disk was a disk with a k: floppy disk, hard drive, 
Bernoulli disk, and so on. Then one day, the 
compact disc (you know, a CD) was invented. 
And the people who invented it chose to spell 
it with a c instead of a k, probably because it’s 
round like a discus (think track and field). From 
that time on, both spellings have been used 
more or less interchangeably.
Now, some people will tell you that magnetic 
media (floppy, hard, Zip, Jaz, and so on) are 
called disks (spelled with a k). And that opti-
cal media — that is, discs that are read with a 
laser, such as CD-ROMs, CD-RWs, audio CDs, 
and DVDs — are called discs (spelled with a c). 
Maybe that’s true, but the two terms have been 
used pretty much interchangeably for so long 
that you can’t depend on the last letter to tell 
you whether a disk is magnetic or optical.
The bottom line is that I’m going to compromise. 
When I’m speaking generally about something 
that could be either a disk or a disc, I stick with 
the term disk. But if I’m speaking strictly about 
optical media (CDs and DVDs), I use the term 
disc.
I hope that’s clear. If not, my editors made me 
do it.

175
 Chapter 7: Dealing with Disks
Moving and copying disk icons
Moving a file icon from one on-screen disk to another works the same as moving 
an icon from one folder to another, with one notable exception: When you 
move a file from one disk to another, you automatically make a copy of it, 
leaving the original untouched and unmoved. If you want to move a file or 
folder completely from one disk to another, you have to delete that leftover 
original by dragging it to the Trash or by holding down the Ô key when you 
drag it from one disk to the other.
 
You can’t remove a file from a read-only disc (such as a CD-R or DVD-R) or 
from a folder to which you don’t have write permission. But you should be 
able to move or delete files and folders from all other kinds of disks that you 
might encounter.
Copying the entire contents of any disk or volume (CD, DVD, or external hard 
drive, among others) to a new destination works a little differently:
 
1. Click the disk’s icon.
 
2. Hold down the Option key and drag the disk icon onto any folder, any 
disk icon, or any open Finder window. 
 
 When the copy is completed, a folder bearing the same name as the 
copied disk appears in the destination folder or disk. The new folder 
contains each and every file that was on the disk of the same name.
Copying files in this way is handy when you want to grab all the files from a 
CD or DVD and put them on your hard drive.
 
If you don’t hold down the Option key when you drag a disk icon to another 
destination, it creates an alias of the disk (that is, a link back to the original) 
instead of a copy of its contents. As you might expect, the alias will be almost 
worthless after you eject the disk — if you open it, it will ask you to insert the 
original disk.
If you like using the Duplicate command, note that you can’t use the Duplicate 
keyboard shortcut (Ô+D) on a disk, although you can use it on a folder.
For the full details of moving, copying, and pasting, flip to Chapter 6.

Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
Surprise: Your PC Disks Work, Too!
One of the most excellent features of Mac OS X (if you have friends unfortu-
nate enough not to own Macs and you want to share files with them) is that it 
reads and writes CDs and DVDs that can be read by PCs.
 
Although your Mac can read disks formatted by a PC, the files on them might 
or might not work for you. If the files are documents, such as Microsoft Word 
.doc or Microsoft Excel .xls files, one of your Mac programs can probably 
open them. If the files are Windows programs (these often sport the .exe 
extension, which stands for executable), your Mac can’t do anything with ’em 
without additional software designed to run Windows programs.
So if you wish to run Windows on your Mac, you need to use either Snow 
Leopard’s built-in utility called Boot Camp or a third-party program such as 
Parallels Desktop from Parallels (www.parallels.com) or Fusion from VMware 
(www.vmware.com). Boot Camp requires you to reboot your computer each 
time you wish to use Windows; the third-party programs emulate a Pentium-
based PC so you can run genuine Microsoft Windows operating systems 
(Windows Vista, Windows XP Professional or XP Home, Windows 2000, Windows 
Me, and Windows 98) in Snow Leopard without rebooting your Mac.
So with a copy of Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion (both around $80) 
or the included Apple Boot Camp utility (none of which includes a copy of 
Windows, which is required), your Mac can run those .exe files (and most 
Windows programs, as well).
Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion are almost as fast as a PC when running 
most Windows applications. Depending upon which Intel-based Mac you 
have, they might even be speedy enough to play first-person shooters such 
as Doom, Quake, and Unreal Tournament. Boot Camp is even faster but has 
the disadvantage of requiring you to leave the Snow Leopard environment 
and restart your Mac before you can use it. For most other stuff (including 
the Windows-bundled Solitaire), all three are capable of running Windows a 
heck of a lot faster than many older Dells, Lenovos, and HPs.
Burning CDs and DVDs
With Mac OS X, you can play, create, and publish audio and video on optical 
media. Depending upon which type of optical drive your Mac is equipped 
with, you can burn some or all of the following types of discs: CD -R, CD -RW, 
DVD -R, DVD +R, DVD -RW, DVD +RW, and DVD +R DL (dual layer).

177
 Chapter 7: Dealing with Disks
 
These disc types are usually referred to as “plus” or “minus.” So, when you see 
DVD -R you pronounce it, “DVD minus R,” or when you see DVD +R DL you 
pronounce it, “DVD plus R dual layer” or “DVD plus R DL.”
In the sections that follow, I show you two ways to burn files onto a CD or 
DVD. For the first way, you insert a disc and then select the files you want to 
burn. The second method, creating a Burn folder, enables you to save the list 
of files you’ve burned.
 
Burning a music CD is a different process that’s performed using iTunes. Don’t 
worry — you find out all about that process in Chapter 11.
How can I tell what kind of discs 
my Mac can burn?
Great question. If you don’t know what types of 
discs your Mac can burn, here’s an easy way 
to find out:
 1. In your Applications folder, open the Utilities 
folder and then open the System Profiler 
application.
 2. In the Contents pane on the left, click 
Hardware and then Disc Burning, as shown 
in the following figure.
 
 The right side of the window now reveals 
lots of information about the disc-burning 
capabilities of this Macintosh. The CD-Write 
and DVD-Write items tell you the types of 
discs your Mac is capable of burning.
 
 The disc burner in the following figure can 
burn CD -R and -RW, and DVD -R, -R DL 
(dual layer), -RW, +R, +R DL (dual layer), and 
+RW optical discs.
 
 When you purchase blank discs make 
sure they’re one of the types your burner 
supports.

178
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
Burning on the fly
One way to burn files to a CD or DVD is to simply insert a blank disc and 
select files on the fly. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Insert a blank disc.
 
 You see an alert (as shown in Figure 7-1) that asks you what you want to 
do with the disc.
 
 In this case, the blank disc was a DVD +R DL, but the same thing happens 
if you insert any supported recordable CD or DVD.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Insert a 
blank DVD 
in your 
optical 
media drive 
and get 
ready to feel 
the burn.
 
 
2. Select Open Finder from the Action pop-up menu.
 
 Open Finder is the default choice unless you’ve changed that default in 
the CDs & DVDs System Preferences pane or as explained in this tip.
 
 Your choices in the CDs & DVDs System Preferences pane for the default 
action when you insert a blank CD or DVD are 
 
• Open iTunes: iTunes automatically opens when you insert a blank CD.
 
• Open Disk Utility: The Disk Utility application automatically opens.
 
• Open iDVD (for DVDs only, not CDs): iDVD automatically opens.
 
• Open Other Application: You get to choose the application you wish 
to use when you insert a blank CD or DVD disc. 
 
 If you want to make any of these actions the default in the alert shown 
in Figure 7-1 and thus avoid a trip to the CDs & DVDs System Preference 
pane, select the Make This Action the Default check box. 
 
 For the purposes of these steps, I go with Open Finder for now.

179
 Chapter 7: Dealing with Disks
 
3. Click OK.
 
 Your blank CD mounts (appears as an icon) on the Desktop just like any 
other removable disc, but its distinctive icon tells you that it’s a record-
able CD (or DVD), as shown in Figure 7-2.
 
Figure 7-2:

4. Drag files or folders onto the disc icon on your Desktop until the disc 
contains all the files you want on it.
 
5. (Optional) If you like, you can change the disc’s name from Untitled 
CD (or DVD) the same way you change the name of any file or folder.
 
6. When you’re ready to finish (burn) your CD (or DVD), open its disc 
icon and click the Burn button in the upper-right corner of the disc’s 
window, or click the Burn icon (which looks like the warning symbol 
for radioactivity) to the right of the disc in the Sidebar, both shown in 
Figure 7-3.

 Notice that the amount of free space remaining on the disc (3.7GB in 
Figure 7-3) is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the window. If 
you don’t see the status bar, choose View➪Status Bar. 
 
 Alternatively, you could
 
• Control+click or right-click the disc’s icon and choose Burn Disc 
(yes, Apple spells it with a c) from the contextual menu (right in 
Figure 7-4).
 
• Select the icon and choose File➪Burn Disc Name (left in Figure 7-4). 
If you choose Eject, from either the contextual menu or the File 
menu, you’re asked whether you want to burn the disc first.
 
• If you drag the disc icon to the Trash/Eject Disk icon in your Dock, 
the Trash/Eject Disk icon turns into the Burn Disc icon (which still 
looks like the warning symbol for radioactivity). Drop the disc icon 
on the radioactivity icon in the Dock, and the burning begins.
 
 After you’ve chosen to burn a disc, you see the dialog shown in Figure 7-5.
 
7. Select a speed from the Burn Speed pop-up menu; then click the Burn 
button, and you’re done.
 
 I usually use a slower but more reliable burn speed (2.4x in Figure 7-5) 
unless I’m in a huge hurry. I’ve had many discs fail to burn at the higher 
speeds. You can call those discs “drink coasters” unless they were 
rewritable (RW) discs. If that’s the case you can erase them with Disk 
Utility and try again.

ways to 
burn a disc.

 I feel obliged to mention that CD-RW and DVD-RW discs rarely (if ever) 
work in devices other than your Mac, including CD (audio) players and 
DVD (video) players. When you burn a music CD or a video DVD and 
plan to watch it on a device other than your Mac, you shouldn’t burn it 
on rewritable (RW) media. 
 
 Select the Save Burn Folder To check box if you think you might want to 
burn another copy of this disc someday. (You find out more about Burn 
Folders in the next section of this chapter.) 
Creating a Burn Folder
A Burn Folder lets you burn selected files to a CD or DVD many times. 
Perhaps the most useful thing you could do with Burn Folder is to create one 
that contains your most important files and then regularly burn the current 
versions of those files to a CD or DVD as a backup.
Whenever you drag an item to the Burn Folder, the Finder creates an alias of 
that item in the Burn Folder. So when you burn a disc using a Burn Folder, the 
parent (original) files are burned to the disc, not the aliases.
Here’s how to create and use a Burn Folder:
 
1. Choose File➪New Burn Folder.
 
 A folder titled Burn Folder appears on the desktop.
 
2. Name the Burn Folder.
 
3. Drag some icons into the Burn Folder.
 
4. When you’re ready to burn the folder’s contents to a disc, double-
click it and click Burn.
 
5. Insert a disc and follow the on-screen instructions.

182
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
If the Finder can’t find the parent file for an alias, it asks whether you want to 
cancel the burn or to continue without that item. If you cancel, the disc 
remains empty.
Here are a couple of other ways to burn the contents of a Burn Folder:
 
✓ If a Burn Folder is in the Sidebar of a Finder window, you can quickly 
burn its contents to a disc by clicking the burn icon to its right, as 
shown in Figure 7-6.
 
✓ Right-click or Control+click the Burn Folder and then choose Burn Disc 
Name (in Figure 7-6 it would say, Burn “Some Cool Stuff 4 U”) from the 
contextual menu.

Getting Disks out of Your Mac
The preceding sections tell you almost everything there is to know about 
disks except one important thing: how to eject a disk. Piece of cake, actually. 
Here are several ways, all simple to remember:
 
✓ Click the disk’s icon to select it and then choose File➪Eject (or use the 
keyboard shortcut Ô+E).
 
 
✓ Drag the disk’s icon to the Trash. When you drag a disk’s icon, the Trash 
icon in the Dock changes into an Eject icon, like the one shown in the 
left margin.
 
 The preceding method of ejecting a disk is something that used to drive 
me (and many others) crazy before Mac OS X. In the olden days, the Trash 
icon didn’t change into an Eject icon. And this confused many new users, 

183
 Chapter 7: Dealing with Disks
who then asked me the same question (over and over and over): “But 
doesn’t dragging something to the Trash erase it from your disk?”
 
 As I mentioned earlier in the chapter, this technique does something com-
pletely different if you’ve dragged any files onto the disc. In that case the 
Trash icon turns into the radioactive symbol and your Mac offers to burn 
the disc as shown in Figure 7-5. Put another way, this ejection technique 
only works if the disc is blank, has already been burned, or is a store-bought 
pre-recorded (read only) CD or DVD. 
 
✓ Click the little Eject icon to the right of the disc’s name in the Sidebar.
 
✓ Press the Eject key on your keyboard if it has one. (If it has one, it 
probably has the Eject icon on it.) 
 
 If your keyboard doesn’t have an Eject key, press the F12 key and con-
tinue to hold it down for a second or two. On many keyboards that don’t 
have an Eject key, this keyboard shortcut ejects a disc.
 
✓ Right-click or Control+click the disk icon and then choose Eject from the 
contextual menu.
There’s one more way, if you like little menus on the right side of your menu 
bar. To install your own Eject menu on the menu bar, navigate to System/
Library/CoreServices/MenuExtras and then open (double-click) the 
Eject.menu icon. Your Eject menu appears on the right side of your menu bar 
as shown in Figure 7-7 (top). If you get tired of the icon on your menu bar, just 
drag it off, and it disappears with a satisfying “poof,” as shown in Figure 7-7.

W
hen you buy Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the folks at Apple generously 
include applications that can help simplify and organize your 
everyday affairs, namely iCal, Stickies, and iSync.
In fact, Mac OS X comes with a whole folder full of applications — software 
you can use to do everything from surfing the Internet to capturing an image 
of your Mac’s screen to playing QuickTime movies to checking the time. 
Technically, most of these applications aren’t even part of Mac OS X. Rather, 
the vast majority of them are what are known as bundled apps — programs 
that come with the operating system but are unrelated to its function. Readers 
(bless them) tend to complain when I skip over bundled applications, so I 
mention almost all of them in this book.
But in this chapter, you get a look at only the applications that help you orga-
nize your everyday life — your appointments, to-do items, notes to yourself, 
and all the various gadgets you may attach to and detach from your Mac.
The applications discussed in this chapter are stored in (where else?) the 
Applications folder, which you can get to in three ways:
 
✓ Click the Applications folder in the Sidebar in any Finder window.
 
✓ Choose Go➪Applications.
 
✓ Press Ô+Shift+A.
 
Other bundled apps you might be especially interested in include Safari 
(Chapter 9), Address Book and Mail (Chapter 10), iTunes (Chapter 11), a 
whole handful of multimedia applications that enable you to play video and 
more on your Mac (Chapter 12), and TextEdit (Chapter 13). For even more 
information on the Mac OS X bundled applications, check out Macs For 
Dummies, 9th Edition, by USA Today columnist Edward C. Baig.

Keeping Track with iCal
 
 iCal is a wonderful program that combines a comprehensive daily/weekly/
monthly appointment calendar and a to-do list. It offers multiple color-coded 
calendars, several types of reminder alarms, repeating event scheduling, and 
more. You can publish your calendar(s) on the Web for others to view (which 
requires a MobileMe account or other WebDav server), and you can 
subscribe to calendars published by other iCal users.
It’s a handy-dandy memory-enhancing tool, and if you make a habit of record-
ing appointments and things to do in iCal, you’ll almost never forget them.
 
I love iCal and keep it open at all times on my Macs. In the sections that 
follow, I share a handful of the features I find most useful.
Navigating iCal views
iCal lets you display the main iCal window just the way you like it.
 
✓ You can view your calendar by the day, week, or month. Figure 8-1 
shows a weekly view. To select a view, click the Day, Week, or Month 
button at the top of the window.

 Chapter 8: Organizing Your Life
 
✓ To move back or forward, click the arrow buttons on either side of the 
Day, Week, and Month buttons. You see the previous or next week in 
weekly view, you move back or forward by day in Day view, and so on.
 
✓ To show or hide the Event Info, Mini Calendar(s), Notifications, Search 
Results, To Dos, and All-Day Events, click the Show/Hide button for that 
feature. (Refer to Figure 8-1.)
 
✓ To go to today’s date, click the Go to Today button.
 
✓ To jump to any date, week, or month (depending on the view you’ve 
selected), simply click it in the mini calendar in the lower left.
You can find all these items, most of which have handy keyboard shortcuts, 
in the iCal View menu, as shown in Figure 8-2. This menu offers almost total 
control over what you see and how you navigate.
 
If you want to master iCal, it would behoove you to spend some time experi-
menting with these views and navigation commands and options.
 
Figure 8-2: 
The iCal 
View menu.
 
Creating calendars
If you refer to Figure 8-1, you see check boxes for Family, Personal, and Work 
in the upper left. These check boxes represent different calendars set up in 
iCal. The check boxes let you turn the visibility of calendars on (checked) 
and off (unchecked).
To create a new calendar in iCal, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Calendar, press Ô+Option+N, or click the + button 
in the bottom-left corner of the main iCal window.
 
 A new calendar named Untitled is created and added to the calendar list.
 
2. To give your calendar a name, select Untitled and type a new name.

188
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
3. (Optional) To color-code the entries for this calendar, first select the 
calendar (by clicking it); then choose File➪Get Info or press Ô+I; then 
select a color by clicking and holding the color swatch, as shown in 
Figure 8-3.
 
 In my humble opinion, Other is the really handy choice, because it lets 
you select colors other than the six boring default colors.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Change the 
color of a 
calendar 
by clicking 
and holding 
the color 
swatch.
 
 
 Now any item you create while this calendar is selected in the list on the 
left appears in the calendar in the color you selected. And when a calen-
dar is selected in the list on the left, events that belong to the calendar 
are displayed in a brighter shade of the color. 
 
 While you’re in the Info window, you can also add a description of your 
calendar. 
Grouping calendars
You can also organize calendars into groups that contain more than one cal-
endar. To create a new calendar group in iCal, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Calendar Group, press Ô+Shift+N, or press Shift 
and then click the + button in the bottom-left corner of the main iCal 
window.
 
 A new calendar group named Group is created and added to the 
calendar list.
 
2. Give the new group a name by selecting Group and typing a new name.

189
 Chapter 8: Organizing Your Life
 
3. To add calendars to the group, simply drag them below the group 
name in the list, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 You can now show or hide all calendars in the group by selecting or 
de selecting a single check box. And of course, you can still show or hide 
individual calendars by selecting or deselecting their check boxes.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Add 
calendars to 
a calendar 
group by 
dragging 
them under 
the group 
name, like 
this.
 
Here’s how you might deploy this feature. You could create individual calendars 
for each member of your family and then put all the individual family calen-
dars into a group called Family. Then you could make all the family-member 
calendars visible or invisible with a single click of the group calendar’s 
check box.
 
If you have a MobileMe account (as discussed in Chapter 9), you can publish 
your calendars and invite others to subscribe to them by choosing Calendar➪
Publish. The others receive an e-mail inviting them to subscribe to your calen-
dar. This is what my family does. Each of us maintains and publishes his or her 
own calendar and subscribes to everyone else’s. That way, we can all see at a 
glance who is doing what and when they’re doing it. This is by far the slickest 
solution we’ve found.
Deleting a calendar or group
To delete a calendar or calendar group, select it in the list and choose Edit➪
Delete. If the calendar has events on it or the group has calendars in it, you’ll

190
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
see an alert box asking if you’re sure you want to delete that calendar or group; if 
not, the calendar or group will be deleted as soon as you choose Edit➪Delete.
 
When you delete a calendar or group, all of the events and To Do items in that 
calendar or group are also deleted. While you can Undo a deleted calendar or 
group (choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô+Z), you must do so before you quit iCal. 
If you quit iCal without undoing a calendar or calendar group deletion, every-
thing on that calendar (or calendars) will be gone forever. 
In any event
The heart of iCal is the event. To create a new one, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Event, press Ô+N, or double-click anywhere on the 
calendar.
 
 If you click or double-click right on the day of the event, you can skip 
Step 2, and you don’t need to specify the date in Step 3.
 
2. If the event doesn’t appear in the proper place, just click it and drag it 
wherever you like.
 
3. To edit an event, select it and then choose Edit➪Edit Event, press Ô+E, 
or double-click it to open its event bubble as shown in Figure 8–5.
 
 All the items with little arrows on their right sides — repeat, calendar, and 
all the items for an alarm — are pop-up menus as shown in Figure 8–6. 
 
4. When you’re satisfied with all of the event’s items, click the Done 
button.

Work 
calendar.

Inviting others to attend an event
To invite other people to your event, you can either open Address Book or 
the iCal Address Panel (Window➪Address Panel or Ô+Option+A) and drag 
the contacts onto the event in iCal. Alternatively, you can type the first few 
letters of the name in the Invitees field, and names that match magically 
appear. For example, in Figure 8-7, I typed the letters st, and iCal offered me 
a choice of my two contacts with names that start with st — namely Steve 
LeVitus and Stanley Steamer. Sweet! (If you’re unfamiliar with Address Book, 
flip to Chapter 10 for details.)
After you’ve added one or more invitees, click the Send button to invite them 
to the event. If they have iCal they can open the enclosure (which is included 
with your invitation e-mail), which adds the event to iCal with Accept, 
Decline, and Maybe buttons. All they have to do is click the appropriate 
button and you receive an e-mail informing you of their decision along with 
an enclosure that adds their response to the event in iCal. Nice, eh? 
If the invitee doesn’t have iCal (or doesn’t open the enclosure that was 
included with the e-mail invitation), they have to respond the old-fashioned 
way — by replying to your e-mail or calling you on the telephone. 
Setting an alarm
What’s the point of putting an event on your calendar, if you forget it? If you 
set an alarm, iCal won’t let you forget. To set an alarm, click the word None 
with the double-headed arrow (just to the right of the word alarm) in the 
Event info window. A menu appears. Choose the type of alarm you want from 
the menu and then change its values to suit your needs. I find the Message 
with Sound and Email alarms so useful that I use both for almost every event 
I create.

192
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
 
Figure 8-7: 
Type the 
first few 
letters of a 
contact’s 
name, and 
iCal 
provides 
a list of 
contact 
names that 
match.
 
You can have as many alarms as you like for each event. When you add an 
alarm to an event, a new alarm item appears below it. Just click the word 
None with the double-headed arrow just to the right of the word alarm to 
create a second (or third or fifteenth) alarm. To remove an alarm, click the 
word alarm and choose None from the pop-up menu.
 
All the features mentioned so far are wonderful, but my very favorite iCal 
feature has to be alarms. I rarely miss an important event anymore — iCal 
reminds me of them with time to spare. And better still, I synch events and 
alarms between my Mac and my iPhone. I can create an event or alarm on 
either device and within a few minutes — through the magic of MobileMe — it 
magically appears on the other.
 
You don’t have to have MobileMe to sync calendars on your Mac and iPhone. 
But without it, you’ll have to connect your iPhone to your Mac with its included 
USB cable to sync; if you use MobileMe, the syncing happens automatically — 
almost immediately, and without cables.
To do or not to do
iCal has one more trick up its sleeve to help you stay organized — the To 
Do item. Unlike an event, a To Do item isn’t necessarily associated with a 
particular day or time and can be assigned a priority level: Very Important, 
Important, Not Important, or None.

193
 Chapter 8: Organizing Your Life
To create a new To Do item, choose File➪New To Do, press Ô+K, or double-
click anywhere on the To Do list.
 
 To show or hide the To Do list, click the push-pin button (shown in the 
margin), which you can find in the lower-right corner of the iCal window.
Are You Available ?
 
A new iCal feature in Snow Leopard is the Availability Panel (Window➪
Availability Panel or Shift+Ô+A). Most of you won’t be able to take advan-
tage of it because it requires you to have at least one calendar administered 
through a CalDAV server or Microsoft Exchange Server 2007. 
 
Unfortunately, this feature does not currently work if your calendars are 
hosted on Apple’s MobileMe online service.
If you don’t know what CalDAV or Exchange servers are you can safely skip 
ahead to the next section. 
If your calendar is hosted on a CalDAV server, you may designate events as 
Free or Busy; if your calendar is hosted on an Exchange server you may des-
ignate events as Free, Busy, Tentative, or Out of Office. The end result is that 
workgroup members with access to this calendar can schedule events that 
don’t conflict with other members’ events. 
Stickies
 
 Stickies are electronic sticky notes for your Mac. They’re convenient places 
to jot quick notes or phone numbers. Some Stickies are shown in Figure 8-8.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Create 
sticky notes 
for your 
Mac.
 

194
Part II: Snow Leopard Taming (Or “Organization for Smart People”) 
To create a new Sticky note, choose File➪New Note.
Stickies are supremely flexible.
 
✓ Move them around on-screen (just drag ’em by their title bars).
 
✓ Change their text to any font and color you desire by using the Note menu.
 
✓ Make your Stickies any color you like by using the Color menu.
 
✓ Collapse a Sticky by double-clicking its title bar.
 
✓ Print a Sticky and import or export text files from the Stickies 
application menu.
 
If you hover the cursor over a Sticky without clicking, the creation and modi-
fication dates and times pop up in a little tool-tip-style window, as shown in 
Figure 8-8.
Anything that you type on a Sticky is automatically saved as long as you keep 
that note open. But when you close a note (by clicking its Close box, choos-
ing File➪Close, or pressing Ô+W), you lose its contents forever. Fortunately, 
Stickies give you a warning and a second chance to save the note in a sepa-
rate file on your hard drive. You can also export Stickies (choose File➪Export 
Text) and save them as plain text, Rich Text Format (RTF) files, or as RTF 
with attachments (RTFD) files. The last two formats support fonts and other 
formatting that plain-text format does not.
 
Other Sticky goodies include a spell checker, spoken notes, and text substitu-
tions (such as Smart Quotes and Smart Dashes) and transformations (such as 
Make Upper or Lower case), all on the Edit menu.
iSync
 
 iSync is Snow Leopard’s synchronizing software that lets you synchronize 
your Address Book entries and iCal calendars with hundreds of non-Apple 
cell-phone models (Bluetooth is required on both the Mac and the phone to 
take advantage of this feature), your iPod, and/or your PDA (Palm, Visor, and 
others). It also lets you synchronize your Address Book entries, iCal calen-
dars, and Safari bookmarks — among multiple Macs in different locations — 
via a MobileMe account.
You can find a list of devices supported by iSync here: 
www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/devices.html

195
 Chapter 8: Organizing Your Life
 
If you have an iPod or iPhone you don’t need iSync. Instead, you configure 
synchronization by connecting your device via its USB cable or dock, launch-
ing iTunes, selecting your iPod or iPhone in the iTunes Source list (on the left), 
and then clicking the appropriate tab. You find out a lot about iTunes (and a 
little about iPhones and iPods) in Chapter 11.
 
Not to toot my own horn too much or anything but if you want to know every-
thing there is to know about using your iPhone with iTunes, I happen to know 
of a great reference book called iPhone For Dummies, written by USA Today’s 
Ed Baig and yours truly. 
Here’s a quick overview of how to synchronize data on your Mac with various 
devices:
 
✓ Bluetooth cell phone: Open System Preferences, and click the Bluetooth 
icon. Click the big Set Up New Device button in the middle of the System 
Preference pane. The Bluetooth Setup Assistant will launch automati-
cally and walk you through the process.
 
✓ Other Macs (requires MobileMe subscription): Open System 
Preferences (from the Applications folder, Dock, or Ú menu) and click 
the MobileMe icon. Click the Sync tab, and check the boxes for items 
you want to synchronize with other Macs — bookmarks, calendars, 
contacts, Dashboard widgets, Dock items, Keychains, Stickies, and so 
on. Now do the same thing on every Mac you want to synchronize these 
items with.
 
✓ Palm, Visor, Blackberry, or other PDA: Refer to the documentation that 
came with your device.

In this part . . .
M
oving right along, Part III comprises how to do stuff 
with your Mac. In this section, it’s off to the Internet 
first — how to get it working and what to do with it after 
that. Next you discover two of Apple’s most imaginatively 
named programs: the excellent e-mail application called 
Mail and the wonderful address book called Address Book. 
That’s followed by a pair of chapters devoted to working 
with media — music, movies, DVDs, and digital photos. 
Finally, you discover the basics of processing words and 
using fonts.
This is an excellent section, chock-full of useful informa-
tion (if I do say so myself), and it’s one you definitely 
don’t want to miss.

▶ Chatting with iChat
T
hese days, networking online is easier than finding a log to fall off: You 
simply use the Internet to connect your Mac to a wealth of information 
residing on computers around the world. Luckily for you, Mac OS X has the 
best and most comprehensive Internet tools ever shipped with a Mac operating 
system.
Mac OS X offers built-in Internet connectivity right out of the box. For exam-
ple, Mac OS X Leopard comes with
 
✓ Apple’s Safari Web browser, which you use to navigate the Web, down-
load remote files via FTP, and more
 
✓ iChat, Apple’s live online chatting client that works with other iChat 
users, people using AOL Instant Messaging (AIM) clients, people using 
Jabber (an open-source chatting protocol), Google Talk, and Bonjour 
(which discovers other users on your local area network)
 
✓ The Mail application (for e-mail)
In this chapter, I cover the top two things most people use the Internet for: 
the World Wide Web (that’s the www you see so often in Internet addresses) 
and live chatting with iChat. You can find out all about Mail in Chapter 10.
But before I can talk about browsers, e-mail software, and chatting, I have to 
help you configure your Internet connection. When you’re finished, you can 
play with your browsers, mail, and chat applications to your heart’s content.

Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Getting Connected to the Internet
Before you can surf the Internet, you need to connect to it. If you’re a typical 
home user, you need three things to surf the Internet:
 
✓ A modem or other connection to the Internet, such as a Digital 
Subscriber Line (DSL), a cable modem, an Integrated Services Digital 
Network (ISDN), or a satellite Internet service.
 
 If you use technology other than a regular (analog) modem, DSL, or 
cable modem to connect your computer to the Internet, your network 
administrator (the person you run to at work when something goes 
wrong with your computer) or ISP might have to help you set up your 
Mac because setting up those other configurations is (sigh) beyond the 
scope of this book.
 
✓ An account with an ISP (an Internet service provider such as AT&T, 
Comcast, or RoadRunner) or AOL.
 
✓ A Mac (preferably one running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard). You 
might need to tweak a few settings, as I explain in the upcoming section 
“Plugging in your Internet connection settings.”
After you set up each of these components, you can launch and use Safari, 
Mail, iChat, and any other Internet application you care to use.
Setting up your modem
If you have a cable modem, DSL, or other high-speed Internet connection — or 
are thinking about getting any of these — you can use them with your Mac. In 
most cases, you merely connect your Mac to the Internet via a cable plugged 
into the Ethernet port of your Mac and into an external box — which is con-
nected to a coaxial or optical TV cable or plugged into a telephone outlet, 
depending on what kind of access you have to the Internet.
For a wireless connection, the setup is the same, but rather than plugging the 
cable into the Ethernet port on your Mac, you plug it into a wireless router 
or AirPort base station. After this device is connected to the box supplied 
by your ISP, any Wi-Fi-equipped Mac (or PC) within range can connect to the 
Internet wirelessly. 
Your cable or DSL installer person should have set everything up for you 
before he or she left your home or office. If you still cannot connect to 
the Internet, you should call that service provider and give them heck. 
Troubleshooting a high-speed connection is pretty abstruse (which puts it 
beyond the purview of this book).

201
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
Your Internet service provider and you
After you make sure that you have a working modem, you have to select a com-
pany to provide you access to the Internet. These companies are called Internet 
service providers (ISPs). The prices and services that ISPs offer vary, often from 
minute to minute. Keep the following in mind when choosing an ISP:
 
✓ If your connection comes from a cable or telephone company, your 
ISP is probably that company. In effect, the choice of ISP is pretty much 
made for you when you decide on cable or DSL service.
 
✓ The going rate for unlimited broadband access to the Internet starts 
at around $25 or $30 per month. If your service provider asks for con-
siderably more than that, find out why. Higher-throughput packages for 
cable and DSL connections might run you twice that. For example, at this 
writing the highest-speed DSL package from AT&T is around $60 a month.
 
Because most Mac users like things to be easy, Mac OS X includes a cool feature 
in its Setup Assistant to help you find and configure an account with an ISP. 
When you installed OS X 10.6 (assuming you did, and that it didn’t come pre-
installed on your Mac), the Installer program might have asked you a bunch of 
questions about your Internet connection and then set everything up for you. 
This process is detailed in this book’s appendix. If you didn’t have an Internet 
connection (an ISP) at that time, you need to configure the Network System 
Preferences pane yourself. Although I cover the Network System Preferences 
pane in depth in the next section, how to configure it so that your Mac works 
with your ISP is something you have to work out with that ISP. If you have ques-
tions or problems not answered by this book, your ISP should be able to assist 
you. And if your ISP can’t help, it’s probably time to try a different ISP.
Old school: About analog modems
A modem is a small, inexpensive device that 
turns data (that is, computer files) into sounds 
and then squirts those sounds across phone 
lines. At the other end, another modem receives 
these sounds and turns them back into data 
(that is, your files). Before the days of ubiqui-
tous broadband Internet access (such as cable 
modem and DSL) and Intel processors, all Macs 
included an internal modem. Alas, all Macs sold 
today require you to purchase an external USB 
modem if you intend to use a dial-up Internet 
connection. (Tip: Apple sells one called the 
Apple USB Modem for around $50.)
To use an analog modem, you merely plug a 
plain old telephone line into it and then plug 
the modem into a USB port. Finally, plug the 
modem into an AC power source if it requires 
AC power. (Some modems don’t because they 
obtain power from your Mac’s USB port.)

202
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Plugging in your Internet 
connection settings
 
 If you didn’t set up your Internet connection when you installed OS X, you 
need to open System Preferences (from the Applications folder, the Dock, or 
the Ú menu) and click the Network icon. The Network pane offers options for 
connecting your Mac to the Internet or to a network. The easiest way to use it 
is to click the Assist Me button at the bottom and let your Mac do the heavy 
lifting. That said, here are some tips and tricks to get you started.
 
If you’re part of a large office network, check with your system administrator 
before you change anything in this pane. If you ignore this advice, you run the 
risk of losing your network connection completely.
Setting up your Internet connection manually in the Network System 
Preferences pane is beyond the purview of this book. That said, here’s a very 
brief overview of the things you need to do should you feel inclined to config-
ure your network connection manually.
Depending on the type of connection you have, you need to configure some 
or all of the items in the following list.
 
Once again, I highly recommend clicking the Assist Me button at the bottom 
of the Network System Preferences pane and letting your Mac set up your con-
nection for you. If it asks you a question you can’t answer, ask your ISP or net-
work administrator for the answer. I can’t possibly tell you how in this book, 
because there are just too many possible configurations, and each depends on 
your particular ISP and service.
That said, here’s a brief rundown on the most common things you might need 
to know to set up a network connection:
 
✓ TCP/IP: TCP/IP is the language of the Internet. You might be asked 
to specify things such as your IP address, domain name servers, and 
search domains.
 
✓ PPP or PPPoE: These acronyms stand for Point-to-Point Protocol and 
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. Which one you see depends on what 
service you’re using to connect. All analog modems use PPP; some cable 
and DSL modems use PPPoE.
 
✓ AppleTalk: AppleTalk is a homegrown network protocol invented by 
Apple. Some (but not all) networked printers won’t function 
unless AppleTalk is turned on.

203
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
 
✓ Proxies: If you’re on a large network or your Mac is behind a firewall, 
you might need to specify one or more proxy servers. If so, your net-
work administrator or ISP can help you with configuration. If you’re a 
home user, you’ll probably never need to touch this tab. Finally, some 
ISPs require you to specify proxy servers; if you need to do this, ask 
your ISP what to do.
If you use your Mac in more than one place, you can set up a separate con-
figuration for each location and then choose it from this menu. A location, 
in this context, consists of all settings in all items in the Network System 
Preferences pane. After you have this entire pane configured the way that 
you like, follow these steps to create separate locations:
 
1. Pull down the Location menu and choose Edit Locations. 
 
2. Click the little gear button at the bottom of the Locations column and 
choose Create New Location. 
 
3. Type a descriptive name for the new location. 
 
 Such as AirPort at Starbucks, Ethernet at Joe’s Office, and so on.
 
4. Select the check box for the service or services this location uses, and 
then click Done. 
 
 From now on, you can change all your network settings at the same time 
by choosing the appropriate location from the Location pop-up menu.
If, on the other hand, your Mac has a single network or Internet connection 
(as most home users have), just leave the Location menu set to Automatic 
and be done with it.
 
Using the Network Setup Assistant (click the Assist Me button at the bottom of 
the Network System Preferences pane) to create a network connection usually 
makes it unnecessary for you to have to deal with most of these items. Still, I 
thought you should at least know the basics.
Starting a MobileMe account
MobileMe (formerly known as “dot-Mac”) is a set of optional, Internet-based 
services that integrate nicely with Mac OS X and cost around $100 a year 
(though you can usually find it for less if you shop around). Although 
MobileMe isn’t specifically a Mac OS X feature, it is an Internet-based ser-
vice that I happen to think is worth paying for (and I do pay for it). So I’d be 
remiss if I didn’t at least tell you a little bit about it.

204
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
At the time of this writing, MobileMe offers e-mail, Web-page hosting, an 
image gallery, 20GB of storage (called iDisk, for e-mail, backups, Web pages, 
and so on), and much more. Check http://www.apple.com/mobileme for 
the most current details and look for a 60-day free trial so you can test-drive 
it before you pay a nickel.
 
 The MobileMe System Preference pane lets you configure your MobileMe 
subscription and iDisk (if you have them). If you’ve forgotten how to find a 
System Preference pane, first open System Preferences (from the Applications 
folder, the Dock, or the Ú menu) and then click the MobileMe icon. 
The MobileMe pane offers four tabs:
 
✓ Account: If you have a MobileMe account, you can type your name 
and password here so that you don’t have to type them every time you 
use your iDisk or Mail. (See the nearby sidebar, “A quick overview of 
MobileMe,” for details.)
 
 Click the Sign Up button, and your Web browser opens and takes you to 
the Apple MobileMe Sign Up page.
 
✓ Sync: The Sync tab is where you can specify which synchronization 
services you want to employ. You can use iSync to manage Safari book-
marks, iCal calendars, Address Book information, and keychains — as 
well as Mail rules, mail accounts, signatures, and smart mailboxes.
 
✓ iDisk: This tab shows how much of your iDisk (your remote disk main-
tained on Apple’s servers for MobileMe members) is used, how much is 
available, and how you have allocated space between disk storage and 
mail storage. It also allows you to keep a local copy of your iDisk on your 
hard drive, synchronize it automatically or manually, and make your 
Public Folder Read/Write or Read-Only with or without a password.
 
✓ Back to My Mac: Use this pane to enable remote file sharing and/or 
remote screen sharing of this Mac. When Back to My Mac is turned on, 
you can access files on this Mac or see its screen and control its mouse 
and keyboard from any other Mac. Of course, both Macs must have 
Internet access or be connected to the same local area network (more 
on that in Chapter 15).
Browsing the Web with Safari
With your Internet connection set up, you’re ready to browse the Web. In the 
following sections, I concentrate on browsing the Web with Safari because it’s 
the Web browser installed with OS X Snow Leopard. (If you don’t like Safari, 

205
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
I recommend taking a look at either OmniWeb or Firefox, which are both free 
and filled with features you can’t find in Safari.)
To begin, just open your Web browser. No problem. As usual, there’s more 
than one way. You can launch Safari by using the following methods:
 
 
✓ Clicking the Safari icon in the Dock (look for the big blue compass that 
looks like a stopwatch, as shown in the margin)
 
✓ Double-clicking the Safari icon in your Applications folder
 
✓ Single-clicking a URL link in an e-mail or other document
 
✓ Double-clicking a URL link document in the Finder
When you first launch Safari, it automatically connects you to the Internet 
and displays the default Apple start page (see Figure 9-1). In the sections that 
follow, I cover the highlights of using Safari, starting at the top of the screen.

Navigating with the toolbar buttons
The buttons along the top of the window do pretty much what their names 
imply. From left to right, these buttons are
 
✓ Back/Forward: When you open a page and then move to a second page 
(or third or fourth), the Back button takes you to a previously visited 
page. Remember that you need to go back before the Forward button 
will work.
 
✓ Add Bookmark: When you find a page you know you’ll want to return to, 
clicking this button tells Safari to remember it for you. I explain 
bookmarks in more detail a little later in this chapter.
Play with the buttons a bit, and you’ll see what I mean.
Other available buttons include Home, AutoFill, Zoom, Open in Dashboard, 
Print, and Report Bug (to Apple); you can add or delete them by choosing 
View➪Customize Address Bar.
To the right of the top row of buttons is the Address field. This is where you 
type Web addresses, or URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), that you want to 
visit. Just type one and press Return to surf to that site.
 
Web addresses almost always begin with http://www. But Safari has a cool 
trick: If you just type a name, you usually get to the appropriate Web site that 
way — without typing http, //, or www. For example, if you type apple in the 
Address field and then press Return, you go to www.apple.com. Or if you type 
boblevitus, you’re taken to www.boblevitus.com. Try it — it’s pretty slick.
Below the Address field is the Bookmark Bar, already populated with some 
bookmark buttons that take you directly to pages that might interest you, 
such as Yahoo!, Google Maps, YouTube, and Wikipedia. 
 
You can delete these bookmarks and/or add your own bookmarks to the 
Bookmark Bar as described in the next section. 
The News and Popular items in this row of buttons is a pop-up (actually, drop-
down) menu, as shown in Figure 9-2. Clicking any of these buttons or choosing 
an item from the News drop-down menu transports you to that page.

207
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
 
Figure 9-2:

and Popular

Bookmarking your favorite pages
When you find a Web page you want to return to, you bookmark it. Here’s 
how it works:
 
1. Click the Add Bookmark (+) button in the Safari toolbar, choose 
Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark, or press Ô+D.
 
 A sheet appears. 
 
2. Rename the bookmark or use the name provided by Safari.
 
3. (Optional) To put this bookmark into an existing folder, choose the 
folder from the pop-up menu below the bookmark’s name.
 
 You can choose where to store the bookmark — the bookmark bar, the 
bookmark menu, or a folder in either place — from the pop-up menu 
beneath the bookmark name. These folders let you group your book-
marks so you can return to them more easily.
 
4. Click the Add button to save the bookmark.
 
 
5. When you want to return to a bookmarked page, choose Bookmarks➪
Show All Bookmarks, press Ô+Option+B, or click the Show All 
Bookmarks button (shown in margin).
 
 The Bookmarks window appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
 You can view the contents of any collection (that is, a folder full of book-
marks) by clicking its name in the Collections pane. Figure 9-3 shows, in 
particular, the contents of the Bookmarks Bar folder with the contents of 
the News and Popular subfolders expanded.

208
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
Figure 9-3:
The 
Bookmarks 
window in 
all its glory.
 
 
 If you enable Auto-Click for a collection of bookmarks, then you don’t get 
a drop-down menu when you click the collection’s button. Instead, all 
the pages in that collection open at once, each in its own separate tab. 
You can still use the drop-down menu, but you have to click and hold 
the button rather than just click. 
 
 To organize your Bookmarks window or place bookmarks on the toolbar 
or Bookmarks menu, move bookmarks by dragging them. You can place 
bookmarks and folders of bookmarks on the Safari Bookmarks bar or 
Bookmarks menu by dragging them to the appropriate folder. If you drag 
a folder of bookmarks to the Bookmarks Bar folder (or directly onto the 
Bookmarks bar itself), the result is a drop-down menu, as shown earlier 
in Figure 9-2.
 
6. Open bookmarked pages in the Bookmarks window by double-clicking 
them.
 
 To delete a bookmark, select it in the Bookmarks window and then press 
Delete or Backspace.
 
Bookmarks are favorites, and favorites are bookmarks. Both words refer to 
exactly the same thing — shortcuts to Web sites. In this chapter, I use book-
marks because that’s what Safari calls them. Some other browsers call them 
favorites.

209
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
 
Your copy of Safari comes preloaded with bookmarks that take you to other 
nifty Mac sites to check out. You can find links to Apple sites, hardware and 
software vendors, Mac publications, and more. Take a look at the folders full 
of great Web pages that your pals at Apple have put together — Mac, Kids, 
Sports, Entertainment, and so on. Be sure to explore all the included bookmarks 
when you have some time; most, if not all, are worth knowing more about.
Using the terrific Top Sites page
The Top Sites page is a new Safari feature — and it’s quickly become one of 
my favorites. It displays a selection of sites you visit frequently, as shown in 
Figure 9–4.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Top Sites 
displays 
your favorite 
sites. 
 
 
 To see it, choose History➪Show Top Sites, press Ô+Shift+1, or click the Top 
Sites button (shown in margin), which you’ll find to the right of the Show All 
Bookmarks button.
As you surf the Web, Safari learns your favorite sites and replaces the sites on 
the Top Sites page with the ones you visit most.
The little stars you see in the upper-right corner of some sites in Figure 9-4 
indicate that the page has changed since the last time you visited it (a very 
nice touch). 

210
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Click the Edit button in the lower-left corner and you can
 
✓ Delete a site you don’t want on your Top Sites page: Click the little X in 
its upper-left corner.
 
✓ “Pin” a site to your Top Sites page to make it remain one of your Top 
Sites even if you don’t visit that page for a while: Click the pushpin in 
its upper-left corner. 
 
✓ Change the number and size of the sites shown: Choose Small (24 sites), 
Medium (12 sites), or Large (6).
Figure 9-5 shows all these actions.

Simplifying surfing with RSS feeds
In the last few years, blogs (short for Web logs) have cropped up all over the 
Web — whether as online personal journals or corporate sources of business 
information. No wonder RSS — which adept bloggers translate as Really 
Simple Syndication — has emerged at the same time. You see synopses of 
what’s available at the site on its RSS feed — that’s what the special RSS links 
are called — in effect, you get an adjustable-length overview with a link to the 
full story. These steps give you a closer look at how RSS works:

211
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
 
1. Look for an RSS icon.
 
 When a Web page is associated with an RSS feed, a little RSS icon 
appears at the right end of the address bar, just like the one shown ear-
lier in Figure 9-1 and in Figure 9-6.
 
2. Click the RSS icon to see all the RSS synopses for the site, as shown in 
Figure 9-6.
 
 The right side of the window gives you control over what you see and 
how it’s displayed. You can search the articles by typing a word or 
phrase. You can drag the article length slider to see more or less of 
each synopsis. Or you can click other items — Sort By, Recent Articles, 
Source, or Actions — to sort or filter the articles, display the page that 
this RSS feed represents (Apple Hot News in Figure 9-6), update the con-
tents of this page, mail a link to this page to someone, or subscribe to 
this feed in Mail. 
 
 You can, of course, bookmark an RSS feed just as you would bookmark 
any Web page. But if you really like a feed, you might want to subscribe 
to it in Mail, which shows you the updated contents of the feed in the 
Mail application (see Chapter 10). 
 
3. Click it again, and the RSS synopses disappear.
 
 They’re replaced by the page contents, as shown earlier in Figure 9-1.

Searching with Google
Looking for something on the Internet? Check out Google, a fantastic search 
engine integrated with Safari to help you hunt down just about anything on 
the Internet in just about no time.
In this section, you discover how to use Google to search the Internet and find 
almost anything, as well as how to get help with Google when all else fails.
To search the Internet with Google, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the beginning of a word or phrase in the Google field to the 
right of the address bar near the top of the Safari window. 
 
 As you type, Safari will offer suggestions and recent searches, as shown 
in Figure 9-7. 
 
2. Click one of the list items, finish typing the word or phrase, or use the 
arrow keys to select a list item and then press Return or Enter to start 
the search.
 
 Google almost immediately offers your search results, as shown in 
Figure 9-7.

3. Click one of the result links. 
 
 Links appear in blue and are underlined. You’re taken instantly to that 
particular page.
 
4. If a particular result isn’t just what you’re looking for, click the Back 
button and try another result link.
 
5. If Google offers too many results that aren’t just right, click the Advanced 
Search link near the top of the results page and refine your search.
 
 You can refine your search by using a multitude of options, as shown in 
Figure 9-8.
 
6. Click the Advanced Search button.
 
 A refined results page quickly appears. As before, click a result link 
to visit that page. If it’s not just what you’re looking for, click the Back 
button and try a different result link.
 
The little circle with an arrow in it on the right side of the Google field in 
Figure 9-8 is the SnapBack to Last Search Results button. Click it to return to 
the Google results page for the last search you performed. Sweet!

with Google.

Checking out Help Center
Actually, Safari has a lot more features, and I could write an entire chapter 
about using Safari, but one of the rules we For Dummies authors must follow 
is that our books can’t run 1,000 pages long. So I’m going to give you the next 
best thing: Open the Help Center (by choosing Help➪Safari Help). A special 
Safari Help window appears; you can search for any Safari-related topic or 
solution to any Safari-related problem right here.
Communicating via iChat
Instant messaging and chat rooms provide for interactive communication 
among users all over the world. If you’re into instant messaging, iChat gives 
you immediate access to all the other users of AIM, Jabber, and MobileMe. All 
you need are their screen names, and you’re set to go. You can even join any 
AOL chat room just by choosing File➪Go to Chat.
To get started, just launch iChat from either your Applications folder or your 
Dock. 
Chit-chatting with iChat
Your text chats can be one to one, or they can be group bull sessions. iChat is 
integrated with the Address Book, so you don’t have to enter your buddies’ 
information twice. It also communicates directly with the Mail application. 
Here’s all the essential info you need to get started:
 
✓ To start a text chat, open iChat, select a buddy in your buddy list, and 
choose Buddies➪Invite to Chat.
 
 Each participant’s picture (or icon) appears next to anything she says, 
which is displayed in a cartoon-like thought bubble, as shown in Figure 9-9. 
If you find the thought bubbles a little too childish, you can turn them off 
from the View menu.
 
✓ To start a group text chat, hold down the Ô key and click each person 
in your buddy list that you wish to include and then click the A button at 
the bottom of the buddy list. In a group text chat, everyone sees every 
message from every participant. 

215
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
 
Figure 9-9: 
A chat with 
myself. (I 
have two 
Macs on 
the same 
network.)
 
 
✓ To attach a picture to a person in your Address Book (as I have for 
myself with a photo on one Mac and a cartoon image on the other), copy 
a picture of that person to the Clipboard in your favorite graphics appli-
cation (Preview, for example). Now open Address Book and display the 
card for the person you want to add a picture to. Click the empty picture 
box at the top of the card and paste the picture on the Clipboard. You 
should now see that picture on the Address Book card and also when 
you iChat with the person. Neat!
 
✓ To transfer files, just drag the document’s icon to the message box, as 
demonstrated in Figure 9-10, and press Return or Enter. The file zips 
across the ether. This is a very convenient way to share photos or docu-
ments without resorting to file sharing or e-mail.
 
✓ To send an e-mail from iChat, just select a buddy in iChat’s buddy list 
and then choose Buddies➪Send Email (or press Ô+Option+E). Mail 
launches (if it’s not already open) and addresses a new message to the 
selected buddy, ready for you to begin typing.

Chatting with audio and video
The greatest iChat feature is audio/video chatting, which is why it used to be 
called iChat AV. Apple dropped the AV part but iChat still has fantastic audio 
and video features that are lots of fun — and ever-so-easy to set up and use.
The latest enhancement to iChat’s capabilities is that you can now confer-
ence a video chat with up to three other people at the same time and audio 
chat with up to nine other folks at the same time.
To conduct a video or audio chat, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect a FireWire camera and/or a supported microphone to your Mac.
 
 Although many FireWire camcorders work fairly well for video chatting, 
Apple’s iSight camera/microphone combination is designed just for this 
purpose (and works even better in most cases). It’s built into all Mac 
notebooks and iMacs these days, so likely you won’t have to buy a thing 
to video (and audio) chat.
 
 When you have appropriate hardware connected to your Mac, your bud-
dies’ names in the buddy lists display little green telephone or camera 
icons if they have the right hardware and an adequate Internet connec-
tion on their end.
 
2. To start an audio- or videoconference, click the appropriate green 
icon(s).
 
 Your buddies receive an invitation to begin an audio or video chat.
 
3. If they accept the invitation, a Video Chat window appears, as shown 
in Figure 9-11.
 
Figure 9-11: 
I’m 
iChatting 
with my 
buddy Dave 
Hamilton.
 

217
 Chapter 9: Internet-Working
 
If you have an iSight camera or FireWire camcorder handy (or if your Mac has a 
built-in iSight camera), why not give it a try? My chat handle is boblevitus@
mac.com; feel free to invite me to video chat if you see me online.
Remote Screen Sharing — remarkable 
and superbly satisfying
I’d like to call your attention to one last iChat feature. It’s called Remote Screen 
Sharing, was introduced in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, and is possibly the most 
useful iChat feature of all time. It lets you control another Mac anywhere in the 
world, or another Mac user can control your Mac from any location. 
So now when Mom calls you and says, “I’m trying to get my mail, but the thing 
that I click disappeared,” you don’t have to try to decipher her description 
and explain how to replace the Mail icon in the Dock. Instead, you calmly say 
Sending files and messages with 
Bonjour and iChat
Mac OS X offers built-in support for Bonjour 
(Apple used to call it Rendezvous), which 
makes chatting even better. With Bonjour, Mac 
OS X can automatically recognize others on 
a local network who are available to chat. So 
you can send a quick message or files from one 
computer to another quickly and with minimum 
hassle. For example, with Bonjour enabled, I’ve 
sent and received messages from/to my AirPort-
equipped PowerBook from/to my desktop com-
puter without any network configuration and 
without having to add anyone to my buddy list 
manually. Just choose Window➪Bonjour and 
select the person with whom you want to chat 
from the Bonjour window. From there, you can 
send a message or file.
For Bonjour to connect to another computer, 
both users need to have Bonjour enabled and 
must either be connected to the same network 
or have AirPort for wireless networking built in. 
Beyond that, the connection is configuration 
free; you don’t have to do anything to be part of 
a Bonjour network, because your Mac config-
ures itself and joins up automatically.
iChat with Bonjour is also a great, quick way you 
can send a file from one Mac to another without 
the bother of setting up file sharing — without 
even adding someone to your buddy list. Just 
choose Buddies➪Send File (or use the shortcut 
Ô+Option+F) and use iChat instead.

218
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
to her, “Mom, just open up iChat and let me show you how to fix that.” Here’s 
how it works:
 
1. She launches iChat on her Mac. You launch iChat on yours. 
 
2. She clicks your name in her Buddy list and chooses Buddies➪Share 
My Screen (or you click her name in your Buddy list and choose 
Buddies➪Share Remote Screen). 
 
3. A window pops up on Mom’s screen, where she grants you permis-
sion to control her screen; once permission is granted, you can see her 
screen on your Mac and control her Mac with your mouse and keyboard. 
 
 More specifically, after she grants you permission, you see a proxy image 
of her screen that says Switch to Mom’s Computer, as shown in Figure 
9-12. (Okay, this one in the figure actually says Switch to Bob LeVitus’s 
Computer because my mom wasn’t available when I shot the figure. So 
just think of me as Mom for the rest of this exercise, okay?)

window on

4. You click anywhere in the little Computer window (Bob LeVitus’s, 
Mom’s, or Whomever’s) shown on the left in Figure 9-12, your screen 
changes — and instead of your stuff, you see the remote screen, as 
shown in Figure 9-13.
 
5. To go back to your Mac screen, just click the My Computer window at 
top left in Figure 9-13, and the remote computer screen disappears and 
yours comes back.

This is the best way to help another Mac user accomplish anything. In fact, 
my consulting business has been using similar software to help Mac users for 
years. It’s fantastic to be able to talk to folks on the phone while you’re con-
trolling their Macs. You can fix things in a fraction of the time it would take to 
explain how to do it over the phone alone. 
Before you get too excited about having all that control, note these few provisos:
 
✓ You and the other user must both be running Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard or 
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
 
✓ You and the other user must both have iChat accounts (on MobileMe, 
AIM, Jabber, or Google Talk).
 
✓ You and the other user both need high-speed Internet access.
 
You can combine this feature with the iChat file-sharing feature described 
earlier to collaborate with others on documents or projects.
 
When you share your screen, the person you share it with has the same 
degree of access to your files that you have. It follows that you should share 
your screen only with people you deeply trust. Furthermore, if you have files 
on your Mac that you would prefer the other person didn’t see, I suggest you 
hide them deep in a subfolder somewhere or delete them before you begin 
your screen-sharing session.

E-Mail Made Easy
In This Chapter
▶ Managing contacts with Address Book
▶ Mastering e-mail with Mail
I
n this chapter, you look at a pair of programs that work together and make 
managing your contacts and e-mail a breeze. You find out how both of 
these eponymous programs — Address Book and Mail — work, and how to 
use them individually and as a team.
 
I cover a lot of material in not a lot of space in this chapter, so if there’s some-
thing you want to find out about Address Book or Mail that I don’t cover, don’t 
forget about the wonderful assistance you can find in Help➪Mail Help.
Keeping Contacts Handy 
with Address Book
The Address Book is where you store contact information for your family, 
friends, and anyone else you want to keep track of. It works seamlessly with 
the Mail application, enabling you to quickly look up e-mail addresses when 
you’re ready to send a message.
In fact, Address Book works with several applications, both on and beyond 
your Mac, including the following:
 
✓ Use it with iChat (covered in Chapter 9) to whip up a quick chat with 
your online friends.
 
✓ Use it with iCal by choosing Window➪Address Panel or pressing Ô+
Option+A. You can then drag any person in your Address Book from 
the Address Panel to any date and time on the calendar, and a special 
Meeting event is created automatically by iCal. The event even has a 
Send Invitation button — if you click it, it launches Mail and sends the 
person an invitation to this meeting. Very cool stuff.

222 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
✓ The Address Book application can also work with any other application 
whose programmers choose to make the connection or with any device 
that is compatible with Address Book. For example, several mobile 
phones I owned before my beloved iPhone — including a Sony Ericsson, 
a Nokia, and a Motorola — could sync with my Address Book contact 
information (wirelessly!) through the magic of Bluetooth, as described 
in Chapter 8. And, of course, my iPhone synchronizes flawlessly with 
Address Book (and iCal, for that matter).
 
 You can find a list of such devices here: http://support.apple.com/
kb/HT2824.
In the following sections, you find out the best ways to fill Address Book with 
contacts and keep those contacts organized.
Adding contacts
Follow these steps to create a new entry in the Address Book:
 
 
1. Launch the Address Book application by double-clicking its icon in 
the Applications folder or clicking its Dock icon.
 
 The Address Book appears. The first time that you open Address Book, 
you see two cards: Apple Computer and the one with the personal iden-
tification information you supplied when you created your account.
 
2. To create a new entry, click the + button at the bottom of the Address 
Book’s Name column.
 
 An untitled address card appears. The First name text field is initially 
selected. (You can tell because it’s highlighted, as shown in Figure 10-1.)
 
Figure 10-1:

223
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
 
 The little up and down arrows between the labels and their contents 
fields are for opening pop-up menus that offer alternative labels for the 
field. For example, if you were to click the arrows next to the word Work, 
you could choose Home, Mobile, Main, Home Fax, Work Fax, Pager, 
Other, or Custom to replace the label Work.
 
3. Type the person’s first name in the First text field.
 
 Here, I type Doctor.
 
4. Press Tab.
 
 Your cursor should now be in the Last text field.
 
 You can always move from one field to the next by pressing Tab — in 
fact, this shortcut works in almost all Mac programs that have fields like 
these. (You can move to the previous field by pressing Shift+Tab.)
 
5. Type the last name for the person you’re adding to your Address Book.
 
 Here I type Mac.
 
 Continue this process, filling in the rest of the fields shown in Figure 10-2.
 
Figure 10-2: 
The address 
card 
displayed in 
the Address 
Book 
window.
 
 
6. When you’re done entering information, click the Edit button to exit 
the editing mode.
 
 The contact I created with this step appears in Figure 10-2.
 
 The little contact card is called a vCard (virtual business card).
 
 To add more info about any Address Book entry, select the name in the 
Name column (Doctor Mac in Figure 10-2). You can tell when a name is 
selected because it is highlighted, as Doctor Mac is in Figure 10-2. Then 
click the Edit button at the bottom of the Address Book window, and 
make your changes.

224 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Repeat this process for everyone you know and want to keep in touch with.
Importing contacts from other programs
If you already have contacts you created in another program, you might be 
able to import them into Address Book. Address Book can import contacts in 
vCard, LDIF, or Text file format.
The first thing you need to do is export the data from the other program in 
one of these formats. Then, choose File➪Import➪vCard (or LDIF or Text file, 
as the case may be), choose the exported data file in the Open File dialog, 
and then click the Open button.
Creating a basic group
Now let me explain how to organize your contacts into groups. Why would 
you want to organize your contacts into groups? The main reason, at least 
for me, is practical: I can send e-mail to everyone in a group that I’ve defined 
with a single click. So when it’s time to send out a press release, I can simply 
send it to my Press group, shooting the e-mail off to all 50 people I have in 
that group. And when I want to send an e-mail to all the parents of kids on 
my son’s indoor football team, I merely address it to my Flag Football Parents 
group, and all 12 families in that group receive it.
Here’s how to create a group and add contacts to it:
 
1. Launch the Address Book application by double-clicking its icon in 
the Applications folder or clicking its Dock icon.
 
2. To create a new group, click the + button at the bottom of the Group 
column.
 
 An untitled Group appears in the Group column with “untitled group” 
highlighted, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
3. Type a descriptive name for this group and then press Enter or 
Return.
 
 I named mine PR, which stands for Public Relations.
 
4. Click All Contacts in the Group column to show all your contacts in 
the Name column.

5. Click the contacts you want in the group in the Name column.
 
 Hold down the Ô key as you select contacts if you want to select more 
than one contact.
 
6. Drag the selected contact names onto the group, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
 Address Book considerately displays the number of contacts you’re 
dragging, which happens to be two in this instance.

And that’s all there is to creating your own groups.

226 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Setting up a Smart Group (based 
on contact criteria)
A second type of group — called a Smart Group — might be even more useful 
to you. A Smart Group gathers contacts in your Address Book based on crite-
ria you specify. So, for example, you could create a group that automatically 
selects Apple staff members, as I demonstrate in a moment.
 
The big advantage of a Smart Group over a regular group is that when I add 
a new contact who works at Apple, that contact automatically becomes a 
member of the Smart Group with no further action on my part.
To create a Smart Group, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Smart Group, press Ô+Option+N, or click the + 
button at the bottom of the Group column and choose Smart Group 
from the pop-up menu.
 
 A Smart Group sheet appears in front of the Address Book window, as 
shown in Figure 10-5.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Creating a 
new Smart 
Group.
 
 
2. Give the Smart Group a name.
 
3. Select the appropriate items from the menus — Any, Company, 
Contains, Email, and so on.
 
 In Figure 10-5, I’ve created a Smart Group that includes any contact that 
shows Apple in the Company field or @apple.com in any e-mail field.
 
4. When you’re happy with the criteria specified, click OK.

227
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
You can tell if a group is set up as a smart group because its icon includes 
a gear.
 
To delete a contact, group, or Smart Group from your Address Book, click to 
select it and then press Delete or Backspace.
Sending e-mail to a contact or group
This section looks at how you can create and send an e-mail message to a 
contact or group in your Address Book.
 
You don’t even have to open Address Book to send an e-mail to a contact or 
group contained in your Address Book. In the next section, you see how Mail 
finds contacts or groups for you without launching Address Book. But if you 
already have Address Book open, this technique for sending e-mail to a con-
tact or group is probably most convenient.
To create a blank e-mail message to a contact, click and hold the label next 
to the e-mail address and choose Send Email from the pop-up menu that 
appears, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Sending 
e-mail to 
someone 
in your 
Address 
Book is as 
easy as 
clicking 
here.
 
The Mail program becomes active, and a blank e-mail message addressed to 
the selected contact appears on your screen. Just type your e-mail as you 
normally would.
 
 In Figure 10-6, I’ve hidden the Group and Name columns by clicking the little 
square button just below the yellow and green gumdrop buttons. To make the 
columns reappear, click the button just to the left — the little square with 
lines on its left side (to represent the Group and Name columns). The buttons 
in the margin are the ones I’m talking about.

228 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Sending and Receiving E-Mail with Mail
Mail is a program for sending, receiving, and organizing your e-mail.
 
 Mail is fast and easy to use, too. Click the Mail icon in the Dock or double-
click the Mail icon in the Applications folder to launch Mail. The Mail icon 
looks like a canceled postage stamp, as shown in the margin.
You can use other applications to read e-mail. Mozilla (Thunderbird) and 
AOL, for example, have their own mail readers, as does Microsoft Office 
(Entourage). And lots of power users appreciate the BBEdit-like editing fea-
tures in MailSmith (BareBones Software). But for Macs, the easiest and best 
mail reader around (meaning the best one on your hard drive by default) is 
almost certainly Mail. And of course, you can’t beat the price — it’s free!
 
The following sections, in some cases, offer you starting points. Even so, you 
should find everything perfectly straightforward. If you run into a question 
that the following sections don’t answer, remember that you can always call 
upon the assistance of Help (Help➪Mail Help).
Setting up Mail
If this is your first time launching Mail, you need to set up your e-mail 
account before you can proceed. A set of New Account screens appears auto-
matically. Just fill in the blanks on each screen and click the Continue button 
until you’re finished.
 
If you don’t know what to type in one or more of these blank fields, contact 
your ISP (Internet service provider) or mail provider for assistance.
After you’ve set up one or more e-mail accounts, you see a Welcome message 
asking whether you’d like to see what’s new in Mail. If you click Yes, Help 
Viewer launches and shows you the What’s New in Mail page (while Mail’s 
main window, which looks like Figure 10-7, appears in the background). Or if 
you click No, Mail’s main window appears as the active window immediately.
 
Mail’s main window is actually called a viewer window or message viewer 
window. You can have more than one of them on your screen, if you like — just 
choose File➪New Viewer Window or press Ô+Option+N.

Composing a new message
Here’s how to create a new e-mail message:
 
1. Choose File➪New Message, click the New button on the toolbar, or 
press Ô+N.
 
 A new window appears; this is where you compose your e-mail message, 
as shown in Figure 10-8.
 
2. Place your cursor in the To field and type someone’s e-mail address.
 
 Use my address (SnowLeopard4Dummies@boblevitus.com) if you 
don’t know anyone else to send mail to.
 
 If the recipient is already in your Address Book (as Steve Jobs is in mine), 
Mail automatically completes the addressee’s name after you’ve typed a 
few characters. So, for example, in Figure 10-8 I typed st, and Mail filled in 
the rest, eve Jobs <Steve@apple.com>, which is highlighted in Figure 10-8. 
If more than one contact name begins with st, a list of all contacts with 
names that begin with st would appear below the To field. Neat, huh?

230 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
Figure 10-8: 
Composing 
an e-mail 
message.
 
 
3. Press the Tab key twice to move your cursor to the Subject text field 
and then type a subject for this message.
 
4. Click in the main message portion of the window (refer to Figure 10-8) 
and type your message there.
 
 Just for the record, here’s what the other buttons shown in Figure 10-8 
are all about:
 
• Attach: Opens a standard Open File sheet so you can pick a file or 
files to enclose with this message.
 
 To enclose multiple files, hold down the Ô key as you click each 
file you want to enclose.
 
 If the recipient of this message uses Windows, you probably want 
to select the Send Windows-Friendly Attachments check box at the 
bottom of the Open File sheet.
 
• Address: Opens the Address Panel, a miniature representation of 
your Address Book. You can then drag contacts or groups from the 
Address Panel to the To or CC field of the message.
 
• Fonts: Opens the Font Panel, where you can change the font type-
face, size, color, underline, strikethrough, shadow, document color, 
and more.
 
• Colors: Opens the Color Picker panel so you can quickly change the 
color of selected text in your message.
 
• Photo Browser: Opens the Photo Browser panel, which displays the 
photos in your iPhoto library and lets you drag and drop them into 
a mail message.
 
• Show Stationery: Opens a sheet with a selection of stationery you 
can use for your e-mail message. (You find out more about this fea-
ture in a few pages.)

231
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
 
• The little arrow thingie to the left of the From pop-up menu: This 
little doohickey is actually a pop-down menu that lets you add 
fields to your message header. What fields? Glad you asked. . . . You 
can choose CC Address Field, BCC Address Field, Reply-To Address 
Field, or Priority Field. Or if you choose Customize, you see all the 
available fields with check boxes next to them so you can turn 
them on or off at will.
 
 Changes you make using this menu become defaults. In other words, 
if you add a BCC field to this message, all subsequent messages also 
have a BCC field.
 
5. When you’re finished writing your message, click the Send button 
to send the e-mail immediately or choose File➪Save to save it in the 
Drafts mailbox so you can work on it later.
 
 If you save your message to the Drafts mailbox (so you can write more 
later, perhaps), you can send it when you’re ready by opening the Drafts 
mailbox, double-clicking the message, and then clicking the Send button.
A quick overview of the toolbar
Before you go any further, look at the nine handy buttons on the viewer win-
dow’s toolbar by default:
 
✓ Delete: Deletes selected message or messages (“A test message for U” in 
Figure 10-7, shown earlier).
 
 To select more than one message in the list, hold down the Ô key when 
you click the second and subsequent messages.
 
✓ Junk: Marks the selected message or messages as junk mail. Mail 
has built-in junk-mail filtering that can be enabled or disabled in Mail 
Preferences. (Choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the Junk Mail 
icon on the toolbar.) If you receive a piece of spam (junk mail), select it 
and click this button to help train Mail’s junk-mail filter.
 
 If a message has been marked as junk mail, the button changes to read 
Not Junk.
 
 For more info on junk-mail filtering, click the question-mark button in the 
Junk Mail pane of the Mail Preferences window.
 
✓ Reply: Creates a reply to the sender only.
 
✓ Reply All: Creates a reply to the sender and everyone who was sent the 
original message.
 
✓ Forward: Creates a copy of this message you can send to someone 
other than the sender or other recipients.
 
✓ New Message: Creates a new, blank e-mail message.

232 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
✓ Get Mail: Checks for new e-mail.
 
✓ Note: Creates a new, blank note. You can write yourself a note (or copy 
and paste information into a note) and save it for future reference. By 
default, it’s placed in the Notes mailbox when you save it, but you can 
drag it into any mailbox you like.
 
✓ To Do: Creates a new To Do item, puts a copy in Mail’s To Do mailbox, 
and adds it to your To Do list in iCal. (See Chapter 8 for details about To 
Do items in iCal.)
Finally, on the toolbar is a Search field that finds a word or phrase in any item 
stored in Mail, as shown in Figure 10-9. Click the buttons at the top of the 
list pane to limit your search to specific mailboxes or to search only specific 
parts (From, To, Subject, and so on) of messages.
 
Figure 10-9: 
Searching 
for items 
from “bob” 
in all 
mailboxes 
reveals 34 
items.
 
Searching in Mail should be familiar to you — it works the same way as 
searching in the Finder. So, for example, if you want to save a search as a 
Smart Mailbox (Mail’s version of a Smart Folder in the Finder), you click the 
Save button.
Working with stationery
Stationery for e-mail messages was new in Leopard, and although I personally 
find it dorky, you might think it’s the greatest thing since kittens, so here are 
some tips for working with it. To use it, click the Show Stationery button in a 
New Message window.
 
I’m a Luddite when it comes to e-mail. When I started using e-mail a long, long 
time ago, it was considered bad form to add anything but text to an e-mail 
message. It was generally agreed that e-mail messages should include only 
what was necessary to convey the information and nothing more. That’s why 

233
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
all these froufrou flowers and borders irritate me and why I find them a waste 
of bandwidth. So please do me a favor: If you decide to send me an e-mail mes-
sage, please don’t use goofy stationery.
Here are some tips to help you have more fun with stationery:
 
✓ Adding favorites: If you find you’re using a particular stationery a lot, 
you can add it to the Favorites category to make it easier to use. To do 
so, merely click the appropriate category in the list on the left (Simple, 
Photos, Greetings, or Invitations); then click the stationery you want to 
make a favorite and drag it onto the word Favorites in the list on the left. 
When Favorites highlights, drop the stationery, and presto — that piece 
of stationery will appear in the Favorites category evermore.
 
✓ Greeking out: You can change the Greek/pseudo-Latin text that appears 
in all the stationery by selecting it, deleting it, and typing whatever text 
you want to appear. You have to do it only once — the text you type in 
any stationery appears in all other stationeries.
 
✓ Replacing pictures: You can replace any picture in any stationery with 
a picture of your own. Just drag a picture — from the Photo Browser 
(Window➪Photo Browser) or the Finder — onto any picture in any piece 
of stationery. I’ve replaced the boilerplate text and all three of the dorky 
pictures in the Air Mail stationery, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
Figure 10-10: 
Drag 
and drop 
your own 
pictures 
anywhere 
you see a 
picture in a 
stationery.
 

234 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
✓ Removing stationery: If you decide you don’t want to use stationery 
with a message after you’ve applied it, click the Simple category and 
choose the Original stationery, which changes the message back to a 
clean, blank page.
Checking your mail
How do you check and open your mail? Easy. Just click the Get Mail button at 
the top of the main Mail window (refer to Figure 10-9).
 
✓ To read a new message, select it. Its contents appear in the Message 
Content pane.
 
✓ To delete a selected message, click the Delete button on the toolbar.
 
✓ To retrieve a message you accidentally deleted, click Trash on the left 
and drag the message into the Inbox or other mailbox.
 
✓ To configure Mail to send and check for your mail every X minutes, 
choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the General icon at the top of 
the window. Pull down the Check for New Mail pop-up menu and make 
a selection — every 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes — or choose Manually if 
you don’t want Mail to check for mail automatically at all. (The default 
setting is to check for mail every five minutes.)
 
✓ To add a sender to Address Book, when someone who isn’t already 
in your Address Book sends you an e-mail message, simply choose 
Message➪Add Sender to Address Book (shortcut: Ô+Y).
 
 Adding a sender to your Address Book has an additional benefit: It 
guards messages from that person against being mistaken for junk mail. 
In other words, your Address Book is a white list for the spam filter; if 
specific senders appear in your Address Book, their messages will never 
be mistakenly marked as junk mail.
Dealing with spam
Speaking of junk mail, although e-mail is a wonderful thing, some people out 
there try to spoil it. They’re called spammers, and they’re lowlifes who share 
their lists among themselves — and before you know it, your e-mail box is 
flooded with get-rich-quick schemes, advertisements for pornographic Web 
sites and chat rooms, and all the more traditional buy-me junk mail.
Fortunately, Mail comes with a Junk Mail filter that analyzes incoming message 
subjects, senders, and contents to determine which ones are likely to contain 

235
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
bulk or junk mail. When you open Mail for the first time, it’s running in its 
training mode, which is how Mail learns to differentiate between what it con-
siders junk mail and what you consider junk mail; all it needs is your input. 
Mail identifies messages it thinks are junk, but if you disagree with its 
decisions, here’s what you do:
 
✓ Click the Not Junk button in the brown bar for any message that isn’t 
junk mail.
 
✓ Conversely, if a piece of junk mail slips past Mail’s filters and ends up in 
the Inbox, select the message and then click the Junk button in the Mail 
window’s toolbar.
After a few days (or weeks, depending upon your mail volume), Mail should 
be getting it right almost all the time. When you reach that point, choose 
Move it to the Junk Mailbox on the Junk Mail tab of Mail’s preferences 
window. Now, Mail starts moving junk mail automatically out of your Inbox 
and into a Junk mailbox, where you can scan the items quickly and trash 
them when you’re ready.
If (for some reason that escapes me) you prefer to receive and manually pro-
cess your junk mail, you can turn off junk-mail processing by disabling it on 
the Junk Mail tab of Mail’s preferences pane.
Changing your preferences
Actually, Mail’s preferences (Mail➪Preferences or Ô+,) are more than you 
might expect from the name. This is the control center for Mail, where you can
 
✓ Create and delete e-mail accounts.
 
✓ Determine which fonts and colors are used for your messages.
 
✓ Decide whether to download and save attachments (such as pictures).
 
✓ Decide whether to send formatted mail or plain text.
 
✓ Decide whether to turn on the spell checker.
 
 The default is to check spelling as you type, which many people (myself 
included) find annoying.
 
✓ Decide whether to have an automatic signature appended to your 
messages.
 
✓ Establish rules to process mail that you receive.

236 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Mail rules rule
If you really want to tap the power of Mail, you need to set rules. With some 
cool rules, you can automatically tag messages with a color; file them in 
a specific mailbox; reply to/forward/redirect the messages automatically 
(handy when you’re going to be away for a while); automatically reply to mes-
sages; and kill-file messages (just delete them without even bothering to look 
at them — what better fate for mail from people you hate?).
There’s no way I can do rules justice in the few pages I have left for this chap-
ter, but here’s a quick look at how to create one:
 
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Rules icon on the toolbar of the Preferences window.
 
3. Click the Add Rule button.
 
 The first condition should say From in its first pop-up menu and 
Contains in its second pop-up menu. Look at your options in these 
menus but return them to their original state — From and Contains — 
when you’re done looking.
 
4. In the field to the right of the Contains pop-up menu, type LeVitus.
 
 Below the condition you just created, you should see an action under 
the words Perform the Following Actions. It should say Move Message 
in its first pop-up menu and No Mailbox Selected in its second pop-up 
menu.
 
5. Look at the options on these menus, but this time, change the first 
one from Move Message to Play Sound and the second one from No 
Mailbox Selected to Blow.
 
6. Type a description of the rule, such as Message from LeVitus, in the 
Description field.
 
 Your rule should look identical to Figure 10-11 now.
 
Figure 10-11: 
When you 
get a 
message 
from me, 
Mail plays 
the Blow 
sound.
 

237
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Mail asks whether you want to apply your rule(s) to the selected 
mailboxes.
 
8. Choose Apply if you want Mail to run this rule on the selected mail-
boxes or choose Don’t Apply if you don’t.
 
 And that’s how you build a rule. From this point forward, every time you 
get a message from me, you hear the Blow sound.
 
Notice the little + (plus) and – (minus) buttons to the right of each condition 
and action. Use the + button to add more conditions or actions and the – 
button to delete a condition or action. If you have multiple conditions, you can 
choose Any or All from the pop-up menu above them, which executes this rule 
when either any of the conditions or all of the conditions are met. Either way, 
all the actions you create are always executed when this rule is triggered.
Mailboxes smart and plain
The following sections take a closer look at both types of mailboxes — plain 
and smart.
Plain old mailboxes
Plain mailboxes are just like folders in the Finder — you create them and 
name them, and they’re empty until you put something in them. They even 
look like folders in Mail’s mailbox pane. You use mailboxes to organize any 
messages you want to save.
Here are several ways to create a plain mailbox:
 
✓ Choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox.
 
✓ Click the little + sign at the bottom of the mailbox pane on the left side of 
the viewer window.
 
✓ Click the Action menu at the bottom of the mailbox pane (the one that 
looks like a gear) and choose New Mailbox.
 
✓ Right-click or Control+click in the mailbox pane and choose New 
Mailbox from the contextual menu.
Whichever way you choose, the next thing that happens is that a sheet drops 
down with a Location pop-up menu and a field for you to type the name you 
want to give this mailbox. Choose On My Mac from the Location menu and 
name the mailbox anything you like. Click OK, and the mailbox is created in 
the mailbox pane.

238 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
You can create submailboxes (mailboxes inside other mailboxes) to further 
subdivide your messages. To do so, click a mailbox to select it before you 
create a new mailbox.
In Figure 10-12, I’ve divided my Books mailbox into three submailboxes: 
iPhone For Dummies 3d Edition, Leopard For Dummies, and Snow Leopard 
For Dummies.
 
Figure 10-12: 
My Books 
mailbox is 
divided into 
three sub-
mailboxes. 
 
You can also drag and drop a mailbox from the top level of the list (such as 
Columns or Teaching in Figure 10-12) onto another mailbox (such as Books 
or any of its three submailboxes) to make them submailboxes. If you drag a 
mailbox into a submailbox, it becomes a sub-submailbox. And so on.
To delete a mailbox, click it to select it and then
 
✓ Choose Mailbox➪Delete.
 
✓ Click the Action menu at the bottom of the mailbox pane (the one that 
looks like a gear) and choose Delete.
Intelligent smart mailboxes
A smart mailbox is Mail’s version of the Finder’s smart folder. In a nutshell, 
smart mailboxes are mailboxes that display the results of a search. The 
messages you see in a smart mailbox are virtual; they aren’t really in the 

239
 Chapter 10: E-Mail Made Easy
smart mailbox itself. Instead, the smart mailbox displays a list of messages 
stored in other mailboxes that match whatever criteria you’ve defined for 
that smart folder. As with smart folders in the Finder, smart mailboxes update 
automatically when new messages that meet the criteria are received.
Here are two ways to create a smart mailbox:
 
✓ Choose Mailbox➪New Smart Mailbox.
 
✓ Press the + button at the bottom of the mailbox pane and choose Smart 
Mailbox from the pop-up menu.
Whichever way you choose, the next thing that happens is that a sheet drops 
down with a field for the smart mailbox’s name, plus some pop-up menus, 
buttons, and check boxes, as shown in Figure 10-13.
 
Figure 10-13: 
This smart 
mailbox 
gathers 
messages 
with the 
word Snow 
Leopard in 
the body or 
subject.
 
Name your smart mailbox; determine its criteria (by using the pop-up menus, 
plus and minus buttons, and check boxes), and then click OK. The smart 
folder appears in the mailbox pane with a little gear on it to denote that it’s 
smart. You can see the Smart Leopards smart mailbox in Figure 10-12. Notice 
that it has a gear, and plain mailboxes don’t.
Sign here, please
If you’re like me, you’d rather not type your whole “signature” every time 
you send an e-mail message. And you don’t have to with Mail. If you create 
canned signatures, you can use them in outgoing messages without typing a 
single character.

240 Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences or press Ô+, (that’s Ô+comma).
 
2. Click the Signatures icon in the Preferences window’s toolbar.
 
3. Click the name of the mail account you want to create this signature 
for in the left column (boblevitus@me.com in Figure 10-14).
 
Figure 10-14: 
My newly 
created 
BL Long 
signature. 
 
 
4. Click the little + sign at the bottom of the middle column to create a 
new, blank signature.
 
5. Type a descriptive name for this signature to replace the default name 
Signature #1 (BL Long in Figure 10-14).
 
6. Type the signature exactly as you want it to appear in outgoing 
messages in the right column. (Regards, Bob “Dr. Mac” LeVitus -- * 
Houston Chronicle, and so on in Figure 10-14).
 
7. Drag the name you’ve assigned this signature (BL Long in Figure 10-14) 
onto the mail account you’re using it with (boblevitus@me.com in 
Figure 10-14). 
That’s about it for signatures. If you have more than one signature, you can 
choose the one you want to use as the default for each account: Choose the 
account in the column on the left; then, from the pop-up menu that appears, 
choose the appropriate signature from the Choose Signature pop-up menu.
 
If you have more than one signature, another cool thing happens: A Signature 
menu appears in new messages, as shown in Figure 10-15, so you can choose 
a signature other than the one you chose from the pop-up menu as the default 
(it’s BL Short in Figure 10-15).

One last cool feature, and you’re finished with Mail. That cool feature is 
QuickLook, which includes a slick Slideshow option. Notice that there’s a 
QuickLook button in the header of messages you receive that contain one or 
more pictures, as shown on the left in Figure 10-16. If you click the QuickLook 
button, a new window appears, displaying one of the enclosed pictures as 
shown on the right in Figure 10-16.

▶ Working with media
▶ Playing with playlists
▶ Backing up your iTunes media
A
long time ago, before the iPod and the iTunes Store were born, iTunes 
was a program you used to store and manage your MP3 music files. 
Over the ensuing years, it has grown into much more. Today, iTunes not only 
manages your music collection, but manages your video collection as well. 
And if you use devices such as an iPod, Apple TV, or iPhone, you manage the 
music or video on them by using iTunes, too.
So the anachronistically named iTunes is the program you use to manage 
audio and video files on your hard drive as well as your iPod, Apple TV, or 
iPhone devices.
Although entire books have been dedicated to iTunes alone, I share the most 
important stuff — the handful of things you really need to know — in this 
chapter.
Introducing iTunes
iTunes has to be the Swiss Army knife of multimedia software. After all, what 
other program lets you play audio CDs; create (burn) your own audio or 
MP3 CDs; listen to MP3, AIFF, AAC, WAV, and Audible.com files; view album 
cover art; enjoy pretty visual displays; view and manage TV shows, movies, 
and other video files; manage iPods (or other MP3 players), Apple TVs, and/
or iPhones; listen to Internet radio stations; and more? On top of all that, 
it’s your interface to the Apple iTunes Store, the world’s leading (legitimate) 
source of downloadable music and video content. (Whew!)

 To open iTunes, click its icon in the Dock or double-click its icon in the 
Applications folder. The iTunes window opens (see Figure 11-1).

 Chapter 11: The Musical Mac
In a nutshell, whatever you select in the Source List on the left is reflected in 
the main list on the right. In Figure 11-1, the Music library is selected. At the 
bottom of the window, you can see that there are 5,404 items in my Music 
library, which would take 15 days to listen to from start to finish and uses 
25.49GB of space on my hard drive.
Rather than try to explain what every item shown in Figure 11-1 does, I 
encourage you to click anything and everything you see in the main iTunes 
window. Experiment with the views, show and hide the browser and album 
art, click different items in the Source List, and see what happens.
 
I’d like you to take note of a few other items:
 
✓ The iTunes main window shrinks to a much more manageable size when 
you click its green gumdrop button, as shown in the upper part of Figure 
11-2. Click the green gumdrop again to expand it back to its normal size.
 
Figure 11-2:

(bottom) and

dow (top). 
 
 
✓ iTunes offers a ten-band graphic equalizer that can make your music 
(or video) sound significantly better. Just choose Window➪Equalizer 
to invoke it on-screen. You can see the equalizer in the lower part of 
Figure 11-2.
 
✓ Don’t miss the iTunes Visualizer, which offers a groovy light show that 
dances in time to the music, as shown in Figure 11-3. You turn it on by 
choosing View➪Show Visualizer or pressing Ô+T. If you like the default 
Visualizer, check out some of iTunes’ other built-in Visualizers like Lathe, 
Jelly, or Stix, which are available in the Visualizer submenu. When you 
get sick of the Visualizer (as you surely will), just choose View➪Hide 
Visualizer or press Ô+T again to make it disappear.
 
 Try this: Choose View➪Full Screen or press Ô+F while the Visualizer is 
running and the Visualizer takes over your entire screen. Click anywhere 
on the screen to bring the iTunes window back.

Working with Media
iTunes is, first and foremost, a media manager and player, so the next thing 
I examine is how to get your favorite media into iTunes. Of course, there are 
a number of ways, depending upon the type of media and where the files 
reside. For example, you can add song or video files you’ve downloaded from 
Web sites or received as enclosures in e-mail messages. Or you can add songs 
by ripping audio CDs. You can buy music, movies, TV shows, audiobooks, 
and iPod games at the iTunes Store. You can subscribe to free podcasts at the 
iTunes Store as well. And you can listen to all sorts of music on the Internet 
radio stations included with iTunes.
 
The iTunes Store and Internet radio require that you be connected to the 
Internet before you can use them. And although both work over a dial-up 
Internet connection (more or less), both features work much better when used 
over a broadband connection.
In the following sections, you discover the various ways to add media — 
songs, movies, videos, and podcasts — to your iTunes library, followed by a 
quick course in listening to iTunes Internet radio stations.
Adding songs
You can add songs from pretty much any source, and the way you add a 
song to iTunes depends on where that song comes from. Here are the most 
common ways people add their songs:

247
 Chapter 11: The Musical Mac
 
✓ Add a song file such as an MP3 or AAC file from your hard drive. 
Either drag the document into the iTunes window, as shown in Figure 
11-4, or choose File➪Add to Library (shortcut: Ô+O) and choose the file 
in the Open File dialog. In either case, the file is added to your iTunes 
Music library.
 
Figure 11-4: 
Drag and 
drop songs 
to the iTunes 
window to 
add them to 
your Music 
library.
 
 
✓ Add songs from a store-bought or homemade audio CD. Launch iTunes 
and insert the CD. A dialog appears, asking whether you would like to 
import the CD into your iTunes library. Click the Yes button, and the 
songs on that CD are added to your iTunes Music library. If you don’t see 
a dialog when you insert an audio CD, you can import the songs on that 
CD anyway. Just select the CD in the Source List on the left, and click the 
Import button near the bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
 
 If your computer is connected to the Internet, iTunes magically looks up 
the song title, artist name, album name, song length, and genre for every 
song on the CD. Note that this works only for store-bought CDs con-
taining somewhat popular music — and that iTunes might not be able 
to find information about a very obscure CD by an even more obscure 
band, even if the disc is store-bought. And in most cases, it can’t look up 
information for homemade (home-burned) audio CDs.
 
✓ Buy your songs from the iTunes Store. Click the iTunes Store option 
in the Source List on the left. From the iTunes Store’s home screen, you 
can either click a link or type a song title, album title, artist name, or 
keyword or phrase in the Search field and then press Return or Enter to 
start the search. When you’ve found an item that interests you, you can 
double-click any song to listen to a 30-second preview of it or click the 
Buy Song or Buy Album button to purchase the song or album, as shown 
in Figure 11-5.

✓ Buy your songs from other online vendors such as Amazon.com. 
Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) has a huge downloadable music store 
on the Web. Its MP3 Downloads section has over a million songs with 
more being added every day. The prices at Amazon are often lower than 
the prices for the same music at the iTunes Store. 
The first time you make a purchase from the iTunes Store, you have to create 
an Apple account, if you don’t already have one. To do so, just click the Sign 
In button and then click the Create New Account button in the Sign In dialog. 
After your account is established, future purchases require just one or two 
clicks.
Adding movies and videos
To add a video file such as an MOV or MPEG document from your hard drive, 
either drag the document to the iTunes window, as shown in Figure 11-4, 
earlier in this chapter, or choose File➪Add to Library (shortcut: Ô+O) and 
choose the file in the Open File dialog. In either case, the file is added to your 
iTunes Movie library.

249
 Chapter 11: The Musical Mac
You can also buy movies, TV shows, and other video content from the iTunes 
Store. Shopping for video is almost the same as shopping for music. Here are 
the steps:
 
1. Click the iTunes Store in the Source List on the left.
 
2. Either click a link or type a movie title, music-video name, actor or 
director name, or other keyword or phrase in the Search field. Press 
Return or Enter to start the search.
 
3. When you find a video item that interests you, double-click it to see 
a 30-second preview or click the Buy Episode or Buy Video button to 
purchase the episode or video.
Adding podcasts
Podcasts are like radio or television shows, except that when you subscribe 
to them, you can listen to or watch them (using iTunes or your iPod or 
iPhone) at any time you like. Thousands of podcasts are available, and many 
(or most) are free. To find podcasts, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the iTunes Store in the Source List on the left.
 
2. Click the Podcasts link on the store’s home screen.
 
3. Click a link on the Podcasts screen or type a keyword or phrase in the 
Search field.
 
4. When you find a podcast that appeals to you, double-click it to listen 
to a preview, click the Get Episode button to download the current 
episode of that podcast, or click the Subscribe button to receive all 
future episodes of that podcast automatically.
 
 Figure 11-6 shows all these things for the Car Talk audio podcast from 
National Public Radio.
 
 For more information on most podcasts, click the little i button on 
the right side of the description field to see the details, as shown in 
Figure 11-7.
Subscribing to a podcast is a cool deal. You can configure how often iTunes 
checks for new episodes — hourly, daily, weekly, or manually — and what to 
do when new episodes become available — download the most recent one, 
download all episodes, or do nothing — and how many episodes to keep in 
your iTunes Library — all, all unplayed, or a specific number between 2 and 
10. To specify these settings, choose Podcasts in the Source List, click the 
name of the podcast you want to configure, and then click the Settings button 
near the bottom of the window.

Listening to Internet radio
Streaming audio is delivered over the Internet in real time. Think of stream-
ing audio as being “just like radio” but using the Internet rather than the air-
waves as its delivery medium.
There are two ways to listen to streaming Internet radio stations with iTunes: 
the easy way and the less easy way. The easy way is to listen to one of the 
hundreds of Internet radio stations included with iTunes. They’re even orga-
nized into convenient categories such as Alt/Modern Rock, Blues, Country, 
Jazz, Public, Top 40/Pop, Urban, and many more.

251
 Chapter 11: The Musical Mac
To listen to one of iTunes’ included Internet radio stations, click the Radio 
item in the Source List on the left and then click a disclosure triangle to the 
left of each category name to reveal the stations in that category, as shown in 
Figure 11-8.
 
Figure 11-8: 
Listening to 
All Classic 
Hits (181.
FM), one of 
120 streams 
in the 
Classic 
Rock 
category.
 
The less-easy way is to find an Internet radio station on your own by surfing 
or searching the Web using Safari (or another Web browser). When you find 
an Internet radio station you’d like to listen to using iTunes, here’s how to get 
it into iTunes:
 
1. Copy its address (its URL) by highlighting it and choosing Edit➪Copy 
(shortcut: Ô+C).
 
2. Switch to (or launch) iTunes.
 
3. Choose Advanced➪Open Stream (shortcut: Ô+U).
 
4. Choose Edit➪Paste (shortcut: Ô+V).
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The station appears in your iTunes library.
 
Strangely, there’s no way to make an Internet radio station you’ve added your-
self appear in iTunes’ Radio category. Apparently, only Apple is allowed to 
decide what is and is not “radio.” Harrumph.
All About Playlists
Playlists are a big deal in iTunes. Playlists let you manage otherwise-
unmanageable amounts of media, such as the 5,000+ songs I have in my 
iTunes library. Playlists let you create subsets of a large collection, so it’s 

252
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
easier to enjoy exactly the kind of music you want in iTunes or on your iPod. 
Two types of playlists exist:
 
✓ Regular playlists contain the songs (or videos, podcasts, or radio sta-
tions) that you specify by dragging them to the playlist.
 
✓ Smart playlists, on the other hand, select songs from your library based 
on criteria you specify. Furthermore, smart playlists are updated auto-
matically if you add new items to your library that meet the criteria.
All playlists appear in the Source List on the left side of the iTunes window.
Creating a regular playlist
To create a regular playlist, follow these steps:
 
1. Either click the + button in the lower-left corner of the iTunes window 
or choose File➪New Playlist (shortcut: Ô+N).
 
 A new playlist named “untitled playlist” appears in the Source List.
 
2. (Optional) As long as the playlist’s name, “untitled playlist,” is 
selected and ready to be edited, you might want to rename it some-
thing meaningful by typing a new name for it. 
 
 If you decide not to name it now, you can double-click it and type a new 
name anytime. 
 
3. To add a song to a playlist, click the song in your library and then 
drag it to the playlist’s name. When the playlist’s name becomes high-
lighted, release the mouse button.
 
 The song is added to that playlist. Note that adding a song to a playlist 
doesn’t remove it from the library. Conversely, if you delete a song from 
a playlist, the song isn’t deleted from your library. And if you delete a 
playlist from the Source List, the songs it contains aren’t deleted from 
your library. In other words, think of songs in playlists as being aliases 
of songs in your library.
 
4. Select the playlist in your Source List and click Play to listen to the 
songs it contains.
 
If you don’t want to drag songs to your playlist one by one, there’s an easier way. 
To create a regular playlist that includes songs you’ve selected from your library, 
Ô+click the songs you want to include in the playlist and choose File➪New 
Playlist from Selection (shortcut: Ô+Shift+N), as shown in Figure 11-9.

253
 Chapter 11: The Musical Mac

How to cre-
ate a playlist 
from songs 
you’ve 
selected in 
your Music 
library.
 
Working with smart playlists
To create a smart playlist that builds a list based on criteria and updates 
itself automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Either Option+click the + button in the lower-left corner of the iTunes 
window or choose File➪New Smart Playlist (shortcut: Ô+Option+N).
 
 The Smart Playlist window appears, as shown in Figure 11-10.
 
2. Use the pop-up menus to select the criteria that will build your smart 
playlist. Click the + button to add more criteria.
 
Figure 11-10: 
The Smart 
Playlist win-
dow lets you 
specify the 
criteria for 
your smart 
playlist.
 

254
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
3. Click OK when you’re done.
 
 The playlist appears alongside your other playlists in the Source List. 
You can tell it’s a smart playlist by the gear on its icon. To modify the cri-
teria of a smart playlist after it’s been created, hold down the Option key 
and double-click the smart playlist to reopen the Smart Playlist window 
and change the smart playlist’s criteria.
Burning a playlist to CD
Another use for playlists is for burning audio CDs you can listen to on almost 
any audio CD player. The only trick is to make sure the total playing time of 
the songs in the playlist is less than the capacity of the blank CD you’re using, 
which is usually 74 to 80 minutes. When you have all the songs you want on 
your CD on the playlist, choose File➪Burn Playlist to Disc or click the Burn 
Disk button in the lower-right corner of the main iTunes window. In a few min-
utes, you have an audio CD that contains all the songs on the playlist — and 
plays the songs in the order in which they appeared on the playlist.
Note that although the default type of disc iTunes burns is an audio CD, it can 
also burn two other types — MP3 CDs or data CDs (and DVDs):
 
✓ MP3 CD is a special format that can be played in many CD audio players. 
The cool thing about an MP3 CD is that rather than holding a mere 74 to 
80 minutes of music, it can hold more than 100 songs! The uncool thing 
about MP3 CDs is that many older audio CD players won’t play them.
 
✓ A data CD or DVD is nothing more than a disc formatted to be read and 
mounted by any computer, Mac or Windows. So if you wanted to give 
your friend hundreds of songs, you could fit them all on a single CD or 
DVD that would mount on his computer’s desktop, and he could then 
import it into his own copy of iTunes.
To determine which format iTunes burns from your playlist, choose iTunes➪
Preferences (shortcut: Ô+comma). Click the Advanced icon on the toolbar 
and then click the Burning tab. Radio buttons let you choose Audio CD, MP3 
CD, or Data CD or DVD. Click the one you want, and you’re golden.
Looking at two specific playlists
There are a couple more relatively new playlists I’d like to draw your atten-
tion to: The Genius and the iTunes DJ (that’s the feature formerly known as 
Party Shuffle).

255
 Chapter 11: The Musical Mac
Who is the Genius?
The Genius is actually more of a “what”: an iTunes feature that lets you find 
new music — in your iTunes library or the iTunes Store — that’s related to 
a song of your choosing. Or, as the What is Genius screen you see when you 
turn the Genius on puts it, “Genius makes playlists from songs in your library 
that go great together. And the Genius sidebar recommends music from the 
iTunes Store that you don’t already have.” To get started, choose Store➪Turn 
On Genius if you haven’t done so already. When the What Is Genius screen 
appears, click the Turn On Genius button. 
 
Turning Genius on sends information about your iTunes library to Apple. 
There’s a Learn More button on the What is Genius screen if you want to 
(d’oh!) learn more about it.
 
To use Genius you must (for some unknown reason) have an iTunes Store 
account. Even though the information the Genius sends to Apple about 
your iTunes library is stored anonymously. And even though no purchase is 
required, I think it’s a dumb requirement — but that’s the way it works, take it 
or leave it. 
Assuming you take it, sign into your iTunes Store account if you have one 
or create one if you don’t. After agreeing to the Genius Terms of Service the 
Genius gathers info about your iTunes library, sends the info to Apple, and 
then (finally) delivers your results. When all this is done, you can create 
Genius playlists and use the Genius sidebar. 
 
 How? Glad you asked! Click a song in your Library and then click the Start 
Genius button in the lower right corner of iTunes main window (that’s it over 
there in the margin). After a bit of cogitation, iTunes presents you with its 
Genius selections based on the song you clicked. As shown in Figure 11-11, 
the song was Summertime Blues by The Who and the Genius suggested Badge 
by Cream, For Your Love by the Yardbirds, and several other songs. 
If you’re not a fan of British Invasion rock music, let me assure you that most 
of the songs in the Genius playlist pretty much do “go great together.” (Come 
to think of it, many of the songs recommended in the Genius Sidebar would 
make great additions to my iTunes library.) If you don’t have issues with all 
the legal mumbo jumbo, the iTunes Store account, or sending information 
about your iTunes library to Apple, give the Genius a try.
What do you say to iTunes DJ?
iTunes DJ is the new and improved version of the iTunes feature formerly 
known as Party Shuffle. 

256

playlist and

The big news here is that iTunes DJ is now actually fun at parties. Any guest 
who has the free Remote application lurking on an iPhone or iPod touch can 
request any song in your iTunes library — and cast votes for songs in the 
current list. Figure 11-12 shows the iTunes DJ Settings window and the iTunes 
DJ voting screen on my iPhone.

To start the festivities, first click the iTunes DJ icon in the Playlists section 
of the Source List. iTunes selects some songs to get you started. Click the 
Settings button at the bottom right of the window to configure iTunes DJ as 
shown in Figure 11-12. Click the Refresh button next to the Settings button to 
have the iTunes DJ select a fresh batch of songs.

Songs that have votes or songs that have been requested are replaced when 
you click the Refresh button, so vote for all the songs you don’t want replaced 
before you click the Refresh button.
Backing Up Your iTunes Media
After spending a bunch of time and money ripping and buying songs to popu-
late your iTunes library, you might want to protect your investment by back-
ing up your music.
 
Actually, you should back up all your data files, as Chapter 17 describes. But if 
you’re tempted not to back up all your data, consider this: Apple won’t replace 
music you’ve bought at the iTunes Store if you lose it.
Fortunately, iTunes makes it easy to back up your Music library with its 
built-in back-up-your-music command. To back up your music, here’s the 
sequence:
 
1. In iTunes, choose File➪Library➪Back Up to Disc.
 
 The iTunes Backup dialog appears, as shown in Figure 11-13.
 
Figure 11-13: 
The iTunes 
Backup 
dialog offers 
you these 
choices.
 
 
 You have two options for backing up your iTunes library: You can back 
up the entire iTunes library and playlists or back up only items you’ve 
purchased at the iTunes Store. Regardless of which you choose, you 
have the option of backing up only items that have been added or modi-
fied since your last iTunes Backup. You can also choose a speed for 
burning the CD or DVD from the Preferred Speed pop-up menu. 

258
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
 If you have a lot of stuff in your library this could require a lot of discs. 
For example, my editor’s backup took either 32 CDs or 5 DVDs. And my 
backup is so big (over 100 gigabytes of music and video) that my only 
viable option is to back it up to a big external hard disk. The point is, 
before you begin you should make sure you have enough blank discs to 
complete the backup.
 
 Typically, a CD can hold up to 700 megabytes of data; a DVD up to 4.7 
gigabytes; and a dual-layer DVD up to 8.5 gigabytes. When you click on 
your iTunes library in the Source List the number of items and size in 
megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB) appears at the bottom of the window.
 
2. Make your choices and then click the Back Up button to start.
 
 I recommend you choose a speed one or two “notches” lower than the 
maximum. It’ll take a little bit longer, but this way fewer discs fail to burn 
properly. In the long run I think choosing a slower burn speed saves you 
time and money.
 
3. Insert a blank CD or DVD, and the process begins.
 
 If your backup requires more than one disc, iTunes ejects the current 
disc, and you have to insert another.
 
It’s a good idea to label these discs — iTunes Backup Disc 1, iTunes Backup 
Disc 2, and so on. That way, if you ever have to use your backup discs, you can 
insert the correct one when iTunes asks.
The cool part about using the iTunes built-in backup feature is that it per-
forms incremental backups — backing up only the items added or changed 
since the last backup — which reduces the number of discs you need.
By the way, discs you create using the iTunes backup feature can be used 
only to restore your songs, playlists, and purchases; they can’t be played 
in an audio CD or video DVD player. To restore your music from an iTunes 
backup, merely launch iTunes and insert the disc (or the first disc, if the 
backup required more than one disc).

The Multimedia Mac
In This Chapter
▶ Watching DVD movies on your Mac with DVD Player
▶ Watching movies with QuickTime Player
▶ Entertaining yourself with Front Row
▶ Opening, viewing, printing, and converting file formats with Preview
▶ Importing media — photos and videos — to your Mac
M
edia content is more than just music (the topic of Chapter 11), 
and your Mac is ready, willing, and able to handle almost any type 
of media (with any type of content) you can throw at it. Which is why, in 
addition to the aforementioned iTunes, Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes 
applications for viewing and working with media such as DVD movie discs, 
QuickTime movie files, as well as graphics in a variety of file formats such as 
PDF, TIFF, and JPEG.
In this chapter, you look at some bundled applications you can use to work 
with such media — namely, DVD Player, QuickTime Player, Preview, Front 
Row, and Image Capture — followed by a brief section about importing your 
own media (photos and videos) into your Mac.
Watching Movies with DVD Player
 
 The DVD Player application includes snazzy little on-screen controllers, as 
shown in Figure 12-1. They enable you to watch your movies on your Mac, in 
pretty much the same way you’d watch them on your TV with your DVD 
player.

If you’ve changed your preferences, DVD Player might not start automatically. 
See the upcoming sidebar for details.
Follow these steps to watch a DVD:
 
1. Insert a video DVD into a Mac with DVD Player.
 
 This step automatically launches the DVD Player application; if it 
doesn’t, you can double-click the DVD Player icon in the Applications 
folder to start it.
 
 If you don’t see the little controller gadgets, you can choose Window➪
Show Controller (shortcut: Ô+Option+C) to display the gray remote 
control–looking gadget shown at the top of Figure 12-1, or you can move 
your cursor to the very bottom of the screen to see the transparent 
overlay controls shown at the bottom of Figure 12-1.
 
 The transparent overlay works only in Full Screen mode.
 
2. Use the controls to play, stop, or pause your DVD and more.
 
 The controls themselves should be self-explanatory to anyone who has 
ever used a set-top DVD player. If they’re not familiar to you, hover the 
cursor over any control to reveal a tool tip. This works for buttons on 
either type of controller.
 
3. Use the Controller drawer if you like to give DVD Player less com-
monly used, but still useful, commands.
 
 To open (top-right, Figure 12-1) or close (top-left, Figure 12-1) the little 
Controller drawer, choose Controls➪Open/Close Control Drawer, press 
Ô+], or click the little pull tab (where you see the arrow cursors in 
Figure 12-1) and drag.
 
 The controller might disappear after a few seconds. To make it reap-
pear, jiggle the mouse or choose Window➪Show Controller (shortcut 
Ô+Option+C).
 
 If you’re in Full Screen mode, the menu bar won’t appear unless you 
move the cursor to the top of the screen. Doing so also makes the 
chapters/bookmarks/video clips overlay — which you use to choose 
a chapter, bookmark, or clip — appear just below the menu bar. 

261
 Chapter 12: The Multimedia Mac
 
 And the transparent controller shown at the bottom of Figure 12-1 won’t 
appear unless you move the cursor to the bottom of the screen. 
 
 So move the cursor to the top of the screen to see the menu bar and 
chapters/bookmarks/video clips overlay, and move it to the bottom of 
the screen to see the transparent controller. 
 
4. Sit back and enjoy the inserted DVD movie on your Mac screen.
There really isn’t much more to it than that, but here are a few other useful 
tips and hints for using DVD Player:
 
✓ The View menu lets you choose viewing sizes for your movie, including 
Full Screen, which usually looks best.
 
✓ The Go menu lets you navigate to the DVD menu, beginning of the disc, 
previous or next chapter, or forward or back five seconds, with conve-
nient keyboard shortcuts for each of these commands. It also includes 
several convenient submenus including Title, Chapter, and my personal 
favorite, Bookmarks. 
 
✓ To create a bookmark so you can jump directly to this exact moment in 
the movie, choose Go➪Bookmarks. The Bookmarks window opens. Click 
the little plus button at the bottom and then type a name for this book-
mark (or accept the name DVD Player offers — Bookmark 1, Bookmark 
2, and so). Click the Add button and you’re done. Now you can skip 
right to this frame of the movie from the Bookmarks submenu (in the Go 
menu), by double-clicking it in the Bookmarks window, or by selecting it 
in the bookmarks panel of the chapters/bookmarks/video clips overlay.
Troubleshooting DVD Player settings
DVD Player is a pretty-easy-to-use applica-
tion. However, you might find it’s not working as 
expected for a couple of reasons:
 ✓ You’ve changed the default setting: The 
default setting, Open DVD Player When You 
Insert a Video DVD — is in the CDs & DVDs 
System Preferences pane, which you find 
in the System Preferences application.
 ✓ Certain external DVD players won’t be rec-
ognized by DVD Player: If that’s the case, 
you need to use either the viewing software 
that came with the drive or a program such 
as VLC (VideoLAN Client).
 ✓ Your Mac might not have a DVD player 
(although this situation is unlikely if your 
Mac can run Snow Leopard): If you choose 
Ú➪About This Mac in the Finder, the About 
This Mac window has a More Info button. 
Click it to launch an application called 
System Profiler. Or you can launch System 
Profiler (which you find in the Utilities 
folder) the old-fashioned way — by double-
clicking its icon. Either way, it can tell you 
whether you have a DVD drive in your Mac. 
Just click the Disc Burning item in the con-
tents column on the left; the details appear 
on the right.

262

✓ Many user-configurable options are available in the Preferences window: 
DVD Player➪Preferences (keyboard shortcut: Ô+,).
 
✓ For more information about almost any DVD Player feature, choose 
Help➪DVD Player Help.
Playing Movies and Music 
in QuickTime Player
QuickTime is Apple’s technology for digital media creation, delivery, and 
playback. It’s used in a myriad of ways by programs such as Apple’s iMovie 
and Final Cut, by Web sites such as YouTube (www.youtube.com), and in 
training videos delivered on CD or DVD.
 
 QuickTime Player is the Mac OS X application that lets you view QuickTime 
movies as well as streaming audio and video, QuickTime VR (Virtual Reality), 
and many types of audio files as well. The quickest way to launch it is by 
clicking its icon in the Dock. It also opens automatically when you open any 
QuickTime movie document file.
To play a QuickTime movie, merely double-click its icon — and QuickTime 
Player launches itself.
Using QuickTime Player couldn’t be easier. All its important controls are 
available right in the player window, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
Figure 12-2: 
QuickTime 
Player is 
simple 
to use.
 
Here are a few more QuickTime Player features you might find useful:
 
✓ The Movie Inspector window (Window➪Show/Hide Movie Inspector or 
Ô+I) provides a lot of useful information about the current movie, such 
as its location on your hard drive, file format, frames per second, file 
size, and duration.
 
✓ The Trim control (Edit➪Trim or Ô+T) lets you delete frames from the 
beginning and/or end of a movie.

263
 Chapter 12: The Multimedia Mac
 
✓ The Share Menu lets you publish your movies to iTunes so you can 
watch them on your iPods, iPhones, and AppleTVs, or to a MobileMe gal-
lery if you subscribe to the MobileMe service (discussed in Chapter 9).
Viewing and Converting Images 
and PDFs in Preview
 
 You use Preview to open, view, and print PDFs as well as most graphics files 
(TIFF, JPEG, PICT, and so on). PDF files are formatted documents that include 
text and images. User manuals, books, and the like are often distributed as 
PDF files. You can’t edit a PDF file with Preview, but you can leaf through its 
pages or print it, and you can select text and graphics from it, copy them to 
the Clipboard, and paste them into documents in other applications. It’s also 
the application that pops open when you click the Preview button in the Print 
dialog, as described in Chapter 14.
 
Actually, that’s not entirely true. You can edit one certain type of PDF file: a 
form that has blank fields. Preview allows you to fill in the blanks and then 
resave the document. And although it’s technically not editing, you can anno-
tate a PDF document by using the Annotate tools on the toolbar.
One of the most useful things Preview can do is change a graphic file in one 
file format into one with a different file format. For example, you’re signing up 
for a Web site and want to add a picture to your profile. The Web site requires 
pictures in the JPEG file format, but the picture file on your hard drive that 
you’d like to use is in the TIFF file format. Preview can handle the conversion 
for you:
 
1. Open the TIFF file with Preview by double-clicking the file. 
 
 If another program (such as Adobe Photoshop) opens instead of 
Preview, drag the TIFF document onto the Preview icon or launch 
Preview and choose File➪Open (shortcut: Ô+O) to open the TIFF file.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As (Ô+Shift+S).
 
3. Choose the appropriate file format — such as JPEG — from the 
pop-up Format menu, as shown in Figure 12-3.
 
4. If you want to make sure you don’t confuse your original image with 
the one in the new format, change the name of your file in the Save As 
box, too.
 
5. Click Save.

264
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
Figure 12-3: 
Preview 
makes it 
easy to con-
vert a TIFF 
graphic file 
into a JPEG 
graphic file.
 
As you can see in Figure 12-3, Preview lets you convert any file it can open to 
any of the following file formats: Microsoft BMP, GIF, JPEG-2000, JPEG, PDF, 
Photoshop, PICT, PNG, SGI, TGA, and TIFF.
Chances are good that you’ll never need to convert a file to most of these for-
mats, but it’s nice to know that you could if you needed to.
 
Almost every OS X program with a Print command lets you save your docu-
ment as a PDF file. Just click and hold the PDF button (found in all Print dia-
logs) and choose Save As PDF. Then, should you ever need to convert that 
PDF file to a different file format, you can do so by using the preceding steps.
Entertaining with Front Row
 
 Front Row is an application that takes over your Mac display and lets you 
enjoy full screen digital media. To launch it, either double-click its icon 
(shown in the margin) in your Applications folder or press Ô+esc. 
Front Row’s main menu takes over your entire screen, as shown in Figure 12-4.
If you have an Apple Remote control, as shown in Figure 12-5, you can use it 
to control Front Row from up to 20 or 30 feet away. 
Or, if you don’t have an Apple Remote, you can control Front Row from your 
keyboard as follows:

Importing Media
Chances are good that you’ll want to import pictures or video from your digi-
tal camera or DV camcorder someday. It’s a piece of cake. So in the following 
sections, I show you how easy it is to get your digital photos into your Mac 
and help you get started with digital video (which is a bit more complex).
 
In the sections that follow, I focus on applications that are a part of Mac OS X. 
Technically, that doesn’t include the iLife applications. What I mean is that if 
you bought a Mac OS X Snow Leopard upgrade in a box at a store, it doesn’t 
include iLife applications, such as iMovie and iPhoto. Your Mac almost cer-
tainly came with the iLife suite preinstalled, but depending upon how old your 
Mac is, you might not have the current versions, and the various versions all 
work differently. See the nearby sidebar for more details about iLife.
Downloading photos from a camera
This is the Mac I’m talking about, so of course, getting pictures from your 
digital camera onto your hard drive is a pretty simple task. Here’s how to do 
it step by step using Image Capture:

267
 Chapter 12: The Multimedia Mac
 
1. Turn on the camera and set it to review or playback mode.
 
 This step might not be necessary for some cameras. It was for my old 
Olympus but isn’t for my Nikon Coolpix P1.
 
2. Connect the camera to your Mac with its USB cable.
 
 At this point, Image Capture may launch automatically, or, if you have 
iPhoto, it may launch instead.
 
 If you have both programs on your hard drive and the wrong one opens 
when you connect your camera, you can change that behavior in Image 
Capture’s Device Settings pane. Launch Image Capture (it’s in your 
Applications folder) if it didn’t launch when you connected your camera. 
Now choose the appropriate application (Image Capture in Figure 12-6) 
from the Connecting This Camera Opens pop-up menu.
 
Figure 12-6:

my Mac to

3. From the Image Capture window you can either click Download All to 
download all the photos in your camera or click Download to select 
which photos to download, as shown in Figure 12-6.

268
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
• To choose contiguous photos, click the first photo you want to 
download, press Shift, and then click the last photo you want to 
download.
 
• To choose noncontiguous photos, press Ô and click each photo 
you want to download. Either way, a blue highlight shows you 
which photos are going to be downloaded when you click the 
Download button (such as the first, third, sixth, and seventh 
photos in Figure 12-6).
In Figure 12-6, the Download To pop-up menu is set to the Pictures folder, 
which is the default setting. If you were to click the Download or Download 
All button now, Image Capture would download the photos in your camera to 
the Pictures folder inside your Home folder.
If you want to delete the photos from your camera after they’re downloaded 
to your hard drive, select the photos you want to delete in and click the 
Delete button.
 
If a disk icon, often named No Name, appeared on your Desktop when you 
plugged in your camera, you have to eject that disk — by either clicking the 
Eject Disk icon next to its name in the Image Capture window or by ejecting 
it in the Finder — before you disconnect your camera or you could lose or 
damage files in your camera. So try to remember. If you don’t, Image Capture 
scolds you with the scary warning dialog shown in Figure 12-7.
 
Figure 12-7: 
This warn-
ing means 
you forgot 
to eject your 
camera’s 
disk.
 
Downloading DV video from a camcorder
Getting video from a DV camcorder to your hard drive is almost as easy as 
importing photos from your digital camera. Although it’s beyond the scope of 
this book to explain how you download video, the following tips can help you 
get started:

269
 Chapter 12: The Multimedia Mac
 
✓ iMovie works well for downloading video from DV and HD camcorders 
that include output via FireWire or USB 2.
 
✓ If your camcorder records on mini-DVDs or uses USB 2 to output its 
video, iMovie may or may not work for importing, depending on your 
hardware and version of iMovie.
 
✓ If you do plan to use iMovie, don’t forget about the built-in Help system 
(Ô+Shift+?). Here you find extensive assistance, as shown in Figure 12-8, 
which is the main Help page for iMovie.
 
Figure 12-8: 
Don’t forget 
that help 
is just a 
click (or a 
keystroke) 
away.
 
In iPhoto, for example, after you download pictures to the iPhoto library, you 
can organize them into albums, edit them, create slide shows or books with 
them, use them in Web sites you create using iWeb (another iLife app), iden-
tify faces in them, and much more.
Living the iLife
At $79, the latest and greatest iLife suite is one 
of the fantastic bargains in software. If you had 
to buy all these programs from other vendors 
(or for a Windows PC), I promise you’d pay a 
whole lot more. So if you don’t have the latest 
version of iLife on your hard drive, take a look 
at the features and programs it includes (www.
apple.com/ilife) and consider whether 
you’d benefit from all the new goodies you don’t 
currently have.

Chapter 13
Words and Letters
In This Chapter
▶ Processing words with TextEdit
▶ Finding out all about Leopard’s fonts
▶ Managing fonts with Font Book
A
s I discuss in previous chapters, your Mac is well equipped for creating 
and managing media — music, movies, DVDs, and photos. But your 
Mac is also ready to handle more common tasks, such as typing a letter or 
writing an essay.
Furthermore, your Mac comes stocked with a wide variety of fonts (sometimes 
called typefaces), which allow you to change the way text looks on the screen 
and the printed page, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Each of 
these fonts 
has its own 
unique look.
 
In this chapter, you look at the Mac OS X Snow Leopard text-composition 
program, called TextEdit, and explore fonts and how to manage them.
Processing Words with TextEdit
TextEdit is a word processor/text editor that you can use to write letters, 
scribble notes, or open Read Me files. It’s not as sophisticated as Microsoft 
Word (or Apple’s Pages, QuarkXpress, or Adobe InDesign, for that matter), 

272
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
but you can definitely use it for light word processing and text editing. It’s 
capable of doing some (but not much) text formatting, and can even check 
your spelling.
TextEdit supports images, too. Just copy an image from another program and 
paste it into a TextEdit document. Or you can drag-and-drop an image into a 
TextEdit document from many applications.
TextEdit can even open Microsoft Word documents (.doc files). This is 
fabulous if you don’t happen to have a copy of Microsoft Word on your 
hard drive. 
 
That’s right — the free word processor that comes with Mac OS X can open 
Microsoft Word files, and it can modify and save them again, too. Why does 
this make me rave and marvel? Because now, even if you don’t own a copy of 
Microsoft Word, you can open documents created by others using Word, edit, 
and resave them — all without having to buy your own copy of Word. Don’t get 
me wrong — I use Word more than any other program, and I have no qualms. 
But for those of you who don’t need a full-featured, professional-quality, rela-
tively expensive writing environment, the freebie (TextEdit) may very well be 
all the word processor you’ll ever need.
 
 Like all apps included with Snow Leopard, you find TextEdit in the 
Applications folder at root level on your hard disk.
 
The Dock doesn’t have a TextEdit icon but if you like it, use it regularly, 
or would just like to have it in your Dock, either drag its icon from the 
Applications folder to the left side of the Dock or launch it, right-click (or 
Control+click) its Dock icon, and then choose Keep in Dock. 
Creating and composing a document
When you launch TextEdit, a blank, untitled document appears on your screen. 
If one doesn’t, choose File➪New or press Ô+N. Before you begin work on any 
document, save it to your hard drive by choosing File➪Save or pressing Ô+S. 
(If you’re new to Mac OS Snow Leopard Save sheets, flip to Chapter 6 for details.)
 
As you work with the document, it’s a good idea to save it every few minutes, 
just in case. After you’ve named a file, all you need to do to save its current 
state is choose File➪Save or press Ô+S.
Now begin typing your text. When you type text in a word processor, you 
should know a few handy things:
 
✓ Press the Return (or Enter) key only when you reach the end of a 
paragraph. You don’t need to press Return at the end of a line of text —

273
 Chapter 13: Words and Letters
the program automatically wraps your text to the next line, keeping 
things neat and tidy.
 
✓ Type a single space after the punctuation mark at the end of a sentence, 
regardless of what your typing teacher might have told you. Word 
processors and typewriters aren’t the same. With a typewriter, you want 
two spaces at the end of a sentence; with a word processor, you don’t. 
(Typewriters use fixed-width fonts; computers mostly use fonts with vari-
able widths. If you put two spaces at the end of a sentence in a computer-
generated document, the gap looks too wide.) Trust me on this one.
 
✓ Limit most documents to a maximum of two different fonts. Mac OS X 
offers you a wide selection of fonts — but that doesn’t mean you have to 
use them all in one document.
 
To put certain characters in your TextEdit document, choose Edit➪Special 
Characters (shortcut: Ô+Option+T). This command opens the Character 
Palette, where you can choose special characters such as mathematical sym-
bols, arrows, ornaments, stars, accented Latin characters, and so on. To insert 
a character into your document at the insertion point, simply click it and then 
click the Insert button.
Working with text
TextEdit operates on the “select, then operate” principle, as do most 
Macintosh programs, including the Finder. Before you can affect text in your 
document — change its font face, style, size, margins, and so on — you need 
to select the text you want to operate on.
You can use several methods to select text in a document:
 
✓ If you double-click a word, the word is selected.
 
✓ If you triple-click a word, the entire paragraph that contains the word is 
selected.
 
✓ You can click anywhere in the document, hold down the Shift key, 
and then click again somewhere else in the document, and everything 
between the two clicks will be selected.
 
✓ You can click anywhere in the document, hold down the Shift key, and 
use the keyboard arrow keys to extend the selection. Figure 13-2 shows 
some text that is selected.
 
Give all these methods of selecting text a try, decide which ones feel most 
comfortable, and then memorize them for future use.

274
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
 
Figure 13-2: 
The last 
sentence 
in the first 
paragraph is 
highlighted, 
showing 
that it’s 
currently 
selected.
 
When text is selected, you can operate on it. For example, you can use the 
Format menu’s Font submenu to make text Bold, Italic, Underline, Outline, 
and so on, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The 
selected 
sentence 
is the only 
part of the 
document 
affected 
by these 
formatting 
commands.
 
The same idea applies to tabs and margins. In Figure 13-4, I’ve dragged the 
left-margin markers from 0 inches to half an inch. Notice that the selected 
text is now indented by half an inch.
Select some text in your document and try all the items in the Format menu’s 
Font and Text submenus. As you see, you have a great deal of control over 

275
 Chapter 13: Words and Letters
the way your words appear on the screen. And because TextEdit, like most 
Macintosh software, is WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), when you 
print the document (by choosing File➪Print), the printed version should look 
exactly like the version you see on the screen. For help with printing, see 
Chapter 14.
 
Figure 13-4:
The 
selected 
paragraph 
is now 
indented.
 
Margin markers
Before you print your masterpiece, however, you might want to check your 
spelling and grammar — something that TextEdit makes extremely simple. 
Merely choose Edit➪Spelling and Grammar➪Check Document Now or 
press Ô+; (semicolon). TextEdit highlights and underlines the mistakes in 
your document. Right-click (or Control+click) to correct the error, as shown 
in Figure 13-5.
Adding graphics to documents
Last but not least, you have a couple of ways to add pictures to a TextEdit 
document. The first works as follows:
 
1. Copy a picture in another program — Preview, Safari, or whatever.
 
2. Put the cursor where you want the picture to appear in your TextEdit 
document.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 The picture magically appears on the page.

(or Control+

Or you can drag a picture from the Finder or some applications (such as 
Safari or Mail) to a TextEdit document, as I did in Figure 13-6.

 Chapter 13: Words and Letters
Font Mania
You can jazz up your documents — or make them a little more serious — 
with different fonts. To a computer user, font means typeface — what the 
characters look like. Although professional typographers will scream at my 
generalization, I’ll go with that definition for now.
Tens of thousands of different fonts are available for the Macintosh. You don’t 
want to use the same font for both a garage-sale flyer and a résumé, right? 
Luckily for you, Mac OS X comes with a bunch of fonts, as shown in Figure 13-7. 
Some are pretty predictable, such as Times New Roman (the font of this para-
graph), but OS X gives you some artsy ones, too, such as Brush Script. If you 
really get into fonts, you can buy single fonts and font collections anywhere 
you can buy software. Plenty of shareware and public-domain fonts are also 
available from online services and user groups. Some people have thousands 
of fonts. (Maybe they need to get out more.)
 
Figure 13-7: 
Mac OS X 
includes all 
these fonts.
 
The preinstalled fonts live in two different folders, both called Fonts. One 
is in the Library folder at root level on your hard drive; the other is in the 
Library subfolder within the System folder. Both are shown in Figure 13-7. 
(For an introduction to the Library folders, see Chapter 6.)
 
Mac OS X actually has four different Font folders. A third one, also called 
Fonts, is in the Library folder in your home directory. The upcoming section 
explains the subtle distinctions among those three locations. The fourth one is 
in the Network/Library folder, and you see it only when you’re connected to a 
network server.

278
Part III: Do Unto Snow Leopard: Getting Things Done 
Installing new fonts
To install any new font, drag its icon into one of the two Fonts folders that 
you have access to, as follows:
 
✓ If you want other users to be able to access the new font, drag the 
font’s icon to the Fonts subfolder inside the Library folder, which is at 
the root level of your hard drive. This Fonts folder has universal access.
 
✓ If you want to limit access to the new font solely to yourself, drag the 
font’s icon to the Fonts subfolder located in the Library folder inside 
your Home folder — just keep digging, and you’ll get there.
 
The Fonts folder on the right in Figure 13-7 — the one in the Library inside the 
System folder — is reserved for Mac OS X and can’t be modified easily. If you 
try to remove a font from it — or add one, for that matter — you first have 
to authenticate yourself as an administrator. Do yourself a favor and never 
remove fonts from /System/Library/Fonts. You can really screw up your Snow 
Leopard operating system if you remove the wrong font.
Types of fonts
You can find many font formats with names like OpenType, Mac TrueType, 
Windows TrueType, PostScript Type 1, bitmap, and dfont. No problem — 
Mac OS X supports them all. In fact, the only font format I know that Snow 
Leopard doesn’t support is PostScript Type 3.
That said, the three most common formats for Macs are TrueType, PostScript 
Type 1, and OpenType.
 
✓ TrueType fonts: These standard-issue Apple fonts come with Mac OS X. 
They’re in common use on Macs as well as on Windows machines. That’s 
partly because these fonts are scalable: They use only a single outline 
per font, and your Mac can make their characters bigger or smaller 
when you choose a font size in a program.
 
✓ Type 1 fonts: These fonts are often referred to as PostScript Type 1 fonts, 
and they’re the standard for desktop publishing on the Mac (as well as 
Windows and UNIX). Tens of thousands of Type 1 fonts are available. 
(Not nearly as many high-quality TrueType fonts exist.)
 
 Type 1 fonts come in two pieces: 
 
• A suitcase file to hold the bitmap that tells the computer how to 
draw the font on your screen.
 
• A printer font that tells the printer how to print the font on a page. 

279
 Chapter 13: Words and Letters
 
 Some Type 1 fonts come with two, three, or four printer fonts, which 
usually have related names. Just toss all the parts in the appropriate 
Library folder, and you’ll have those fonts available in every program 
you use.
 
✓ OpenType fonts: OpenType fonts are really TrueType fonts in which 
PostScript information is embedded. This gives you the greater typo-
graphic control that high-end typesetters require, while keeping the 
one-file convenience of TrueType.
Managing your fonts with Font Book
 
 Font Book lets you view your installed fonts, install new fonts, group your fonts 
into collections, and enable and disable installed fonts. As usual, you find the 
Font Book application in the Applications folder at root level on your hard 
disk.
The easiest way to install a new font is to double-click it in the Finder. Font Book 
opens and displays the font. Click the Install Font button to install the font.
Other ways you can install new fonts are to choose File➪Add Fonts or press 
Ô+O. A standard Open dialog allows you to select a font or fonts to be 
installed.
 
Note that by default new fonts are installed in your Home folder’s Fonts folder 
(Users/Home/Library/Fonts). You can change the default installation location 
in the Font Book preferences pane (Font Book➪Preferences or Ô+,).
To view a font, click its name in the Font list. To change the size of the viewed 
font, click the triangle in the upper-right corner of the Font Book window 
(where it says Fit in Figure 13-8) and choose a new size from the drop-down 
list that appears, or type a number where the word Fit appears in Figure 13-8, 
or move the blue slider dot on the right side of the window up or down.
To disable a font so it no longer appears in any applications’ Font menus, 
choose Edit➪Disable or click the Disable button (the check mark in a square 
button) at the bottom of the window.
To enable a previously disabled font, choose Edit➪Enable or click the Enable 
button (same as the Disable button).

Making This

In this part . . .
I 
start this part by helping you decipher the myriad Print 
options so you can become a modern-day Gutenberg. 
Then you get a look at all the different ways you can share 
data with others and access data other users have shared. 
Finally, you look at a bunch of other cool technologies 
included with Mac OS X Snow Leopard to help you make 
your big cat look, feel, and act just the way you want her to.
There is something in this part for everyone, so don’t

▶ Printing to most printers
▶ Mastering the printing process
W
hen you want to get what’s on your screen onto paper, printing under 
Mac OS X should be as simple as pressing the keyboard shortcut Ô+P 
and then pressing Return or Enter. Happily, that’s usually just how easy printing 
something is; when it isn’t, printing can turn into a raging nightmare. If you 
configure your printer and printing software properly, however, printing is as 
easy as can be. And that’s pretty darn simple.
In this chapter, I scare away the bogeymen to help you avoid any print-
ing nightmares. I walk you through the entire process as though you just 
unpacked a new printer and plugged it in.
Before Diving In . . .
Before I even start talking about hooking up printers, you should know a few 
essential things. So here’s a little list that tells you just what those things are:
 
✓ Read the documentation that came with your printer. Hundreds of dif-
ferent printer makes and models are available for the Mac, so if I contradict 
something in your printer manual, follow your manual’s instructions 
first. If that effort doesn’t work, try it my way — use the techniques in 
the rest of this chapter.

284
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
✓ The Print and Page Setup sheets differ slightly (or even greatly) from 
program to program and from printer to printer. Although the examples 
I show you in this chapter are representative of what you’ll probably 
encounter, you might come across sheets that look a bit different. For 
example, the Print and Page Setup sheets for Microsoft Word include 
choices that I don’t cover in this chapter (such as Even or Odd Pages Only, 
Print Hidden Text, and Print Selection Only). If you see commands in your 
Print or Page Setup sheet that I don’t explain here, they’re specific to that 
application; look within its documentation for an explanation. Similarly, 
many graphics apps such as Apple’s iPhoto, or Adobe Illustrator and 
Photoshop CS4 have added numerous gadgets, list boxes, radio buttons, 
and so forth to their Print dialogs, to the point where you might not even 
recognize them as Print dialogs.
 
✓ Don’t forget about Mac OS Help. Many programs support this excellent 
Apple technology, which can be the fastest way to figure out a feature 
that has you stumped. So don’t forget to check the Help menu before 
you panic. (I cover the Help menu in Chapter 1.)
Ready: Connecting and 
Adding Your Printer
Before you can even think about printing something, you have to connect a 
printer to your Mac and then tell OS X that the printer exists. 
 
If you have a printer and are able to print documents already you can skip 
ahead to the “Set: Setting Up Your Document with Page Setup” section. The 
info between here and there pertains only to setting up a brand new printer. 
One that still has its manual. (That’s a hint.)
Connecting your printer
Once again, I must remind you that you could connect to your Mac to thou-
sands of printer models, and each one is a little different from the next. In 
other words, if what you’re about to read doesn’t work with the printer 
you’re trying to connect, again I implore you to RTFM (that’s Read the Fine 
Manual, in case you’re wondering). It should tell you how to load your ink or 
toner cartridges.

285
 Chapter 14: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
That said, here are some very general steps to connect a printer to your Mac:
 
1. Connect the printer to your Mac with the cable snugly attached at 
both ends (printer and Mac).
 
 For your printer to work, you have to somehow connect it to a data 
source. (Think of your phone — you can’t receive calls without some 
sort of connector between the caller and the callee.)
 
2. Plug the printer’s AC power cord into a power outlet.
 
 Yup, I mean the regular kind of outlet in the wall; on a power strip; or — 
best of all — on a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply).
 
 Some printers require you to plug one end of the AC power cord into the 
printer; others have the AC power cord attached permanently. The point 
is that your printer won’t work if it’s not connected to a power source.
 
3. Turn on your printer. (Check out your manual if you can’t find 
the switch.)
 
4. If your printer came with software, install it on your Mac, following 
the instructions that came with the printer.
 
5. (Optional) Restart your Mac.
 
 You need to do this only if you had to install software and the Installer 
told you to restart.
 
Some printers can be shared by multiple users and connect to your local area 
or wireless network instead of connecting directly to your Mac. Unfortunately, 
I can’t cover all possible scenarios here so if you’re trying to set up a net-
worked printer I’m afraid you’re on your own.  
Setting up a printer for the first time
After you connect your computer and printer with a compatible cable, pro-
vide a power source for your printer, and install the software for your printer, 
you’re ready . . . to configure your Mac. You have to do that so your Mac 
and your printer can talk to each other.
 
Many if not all of the steps involving the Print & Fax System Preferences pane 
require that your printer be turned on and warmed up (that is, already run 
through its diagnostics and startup cycle) beforehand. So before doing any-
thing else make sure your printer is turned on, warmed up, and connected to 
your Mac.

286
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
The first time you connect your printer, you may see an alert asking whether 
you want to download and install software for your printer. My printer happens 
to be an Epson Stylus Photo RX580, as shown in Figure 14-1.
 
Figure 14-1:

Any port on a Mac
Before you can print, you need to plug the 
printer cable into the appropriate port on the 
back of your Mac.
Therein lies the rub. Mac technology has 
changed dramatically since the previous edi-
tions of this book, when I used to say, “Begin 
by connecting the printer to the Printer port on 
the back of your Mac (with both the Mac and 
the printer turned off, of course — but you knew 
that, didn’t you?).” Ah, nostalgia. Now I tell you, 
“You need to plug the printer cable into the 
appropriate port. . . .” Why am I being so vague? 
Because I have to be. You see, these days, print-
ers don’t always connect to the same port:
 ✓ Many (if not most) connect through the 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. If you’re 
going to use your printer wirelessly with an 
Apple AirPort Extreme base station or Time 
Capsule device you’ll connect your printer 
to that device’s USB port rather than your 
Mac’s USB port.
 ✓ Other printers connect to the Ethernet 
port or to an Ethernet hub (which is in turn 
connected to the back of your Mac).
 ✓ A few connect via a FireWire port or wire-
lessly via Bluetooth.
So read the printer’s instructions and plug 
your printer into the appropriate hole (port) for 
your Mac.
Typically, your printer connects to your machine 
via USB. Don’t confuse the USB cable with your 
printer’s AC power cord (the kind you find on 
everyday appliances). If your printer didn’t 
come with a cable that fits into one of the ports 
on your Mac, contact your printer manufac-
turer and ask for one; it’s cheesy not to provide 
the proper cable with a printer. Unfortunately, 
some manufacturers make printers with differ-
ent kinds of connectors on the back (to sell to 
those poor souls who are stuck using Windows), 
and expect you to buy your own cable. Asking 
one of those manufacturers for a cable is an 
exercise in futility.

287
 Chapter 14: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
You do, so click the Install button. At this point you may see a License 
Agreement window. If so, click the Agree button to proceed. (You may click 
Disagree if you wish but that halts the installation process.)
After clicking the Install and/or Agree button a Software Update window may 
appear. If it does, just leave it alone; it disappears after a minute or two.
If you’ve connected a new printer and didn’t see an alert like the one shown 
in Figure 14-1, don’t panic. Snow Leopard already knows all it needs to know 
about your printer and already has everything it needs to install the proper 
software. 
Now, regardless of whether you saw the alert window, agreement window, 
and/or software update window, here are the steps to set up that printer for 
the first time:
 
1. Launch System Preferences, click the Print & Fax icon, and then click 
your printer’s name in the Printers list on the left side of the window.
 
 You find System Preferences in the Applications folder. Click the 
Applications icon in the Sidebar of any Finder window or use the short-
cut Ô+Shift+A to open the Applications folder. Or chose Ú➪System 
Preferences.
 
 Snow Leopard is a pretty smart cat — it should have already recognized 
your printer at this point. If so, your printer’s name appears in the 
Printer list of the Print & Fax System Preferences pane, as shown in 
Figure 14-2. My printer’s name, as you can see, is Epson Stylus Photo 
RX580.
 
 If your printer isn’t in the list at this point, then you probably need to 
install (or reinstall) its driver software manually, either from the CD that 
came with the printer or by downloading the latest driver software from 
your printer manufacturer’s Web site. See the nearby sidebar for more 
on drivers.
 
2. Select the printer you want selected by default when you print docu-
ments from the Default Printer pop-up menu (Last Printer Used is 
selected in Figure 14-2).
 
3. Select the default paper size you want to use with this printer from the 
Default Paper Size menu (usually US Letter if you live in the United 
States, as shown in Figure 14-2).
 
 That’s all there is to it. Close System Preferences, and you’re ready to 
print your first document! Before you do, however, make sure you have 
the document set up to look just the way you want it to look printed. 
Read through the next section (“Set: Setting Up Your Document with 
Page Setup”) for more info.

One last thing: Printer sharing 
To share a printer, select it in the Printers list on the left side of the Print & 
Fax System Preference pane and then click the Share This Printer with Other 
Users on the Network check box.
Go for a driver
Many printer manufacturers introduce new 
drivers with enhanced functionality periodically. 
So the driver software on the CD in the box with 
your printer could be six months or even a year 
old when you buy that printer. It’s always a good 
idea to determine whether the CD contains the 
latest version of the printer driver, so visit the 
printer manufacturer’s Web site, check it out, 
and download a more recent version of the 
printer driver if necessary.
Apple includes a huge library of printer driv-
ers on the Mac OS X Snow Leopard Installer 
disk, which should cover most popular printer 
brands and models. These drivers are installed 
by default. Snow Leopard also checks to see 
whether a newer driver is available — for every 
driver in its library — and if it finds one, offers to 
download and install the new driver, as shown 
in Figure 14-1. 
If you chose not to install some or all of them 
when you installed Mac OS X Snow Leopard, 
you almost certainly need to install the appro-
priate printer driver manually before your printer 
appears in the Print & Fax System Preference 
pane’s Printers list.

289
 Chapter 14: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
If Printer Sharing is not enabled an alert that says, “Printer Sharing is turned 
off” appears below the check box along with a Sharing button. Click that little 
Sharing button and the Sharing System Preference pane (which I discuss in 
much detail in Chapter 15) replaces the Print & Fax pane. Just click the check 
box next to Printer Sharing to turn it on.
Set: Setting Up Your Document 
with Page Setup
After you set up your printer, the hard part is over. You should be able to 
print a document quickly and easily — right? Not so fast, bucko. Read here 
how the features in the Page Setup sheet can help you solve most basic print-
ing problems.
 
Become familiar with Page Setup. You might not need to use it right this 
second, but it’s a good friend to know.
Almost every program that can print a document has a Page Setup command 
on its File menu. Note that some programs use the name Page Setup, and 
others use Print Setup. (Print Setup is the quaint, old-fashioned term, more 
popular in the System 6 era and in Windows than on today’s Macs.) Either 
way, this is the sheet where you can choose your target printer, paper size, 
page orientation, and scale (as shown in Figure 14-3).
 
Users of network printers or PostScript printers might see slightly different 
versions of the Print and Page Setup sheets. The differences should be minor 
enough not to matter.
 
Figure 14-3: 
The Page 
Setup 
sheet in 
the TextEdit 
application. 
 

290
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
Click the little question mark in the lower-left corner at any time for additional 
help with the Page Setup sheet. If you do, Page Setup help opens immediately 
in the Help Viewer. (Okay, maybe not immediately, but Help Viewer in Snow 
Leopard is much, much faster than in previous incarnations. . . .)
The options within the Page Setup sheet are as follows:
 
✓ Settings: When you have everything else in the Page Setup sheet con-
figured just the way you want it for most documents, choose Save As 
Default to name this configuration and save it as the default Page Setup.
 
✓ Format For: In this pop-up menu, you find the name of the active printer. 
If you have several printers configured, you can choose any of them 
from this list.
 
 This menu usually defaults to Any Printer, which is the least effective 
setting. Unless the printer you want to use appears here, you might not 
get the full functionality that the printer offers.
 
✓ Paper Size: Use options in this pop-up menu to choose the type of paper 
currently in the paper tray of your printer or to choose the size of the 
paper that you want to feed manually. The dimensions of the paper that 
you can choose appear below its name.
 
 Page Setup sheet settings (including Paper Size) remain in effect until you 
change them. For example, when you print an envelope, don’t forget to 
change back to Letter before trying to print on letter-sized paper again.
 
✓ Orientation: Choose among options here to tell your printer whether 
the page you want to print should be portrait-oriented (like a letter, 
longer than it is wide) or landscape-oriented (sideways, wider than it is 
long).
 
 Some programs offer additional Page Setup choices. If your program offers 
them, they usually appear in the Settings pop-up menu in the Page Setup 
sheet. (Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word have them; TextEdit doesn’t.)
 
✓ Scale: To print your page at a larger or smaller size, change this option 
to a larger or smaller percentage.
Print: Printing with the Print Sheet
After you connect and configure your printer and then set up how you want 
your document to print, you come to the final steps before that joyous 
moment when your printed page pops out of the printer. Navigating the Print 
sheet is the last thing standing between you and your output.

291
 Chapter 14: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
 
Although most Print sheets that you see look like the figures I show in this 
chapter, others might differ slightly. The features in the Print sheet are strictly 
a function of the program with which you’re printing. Many programs choose 
to use the standard-issue Apple sheet shown in this chapter, but not all do. If I 
don’t explain a certain feature in this chapter, chances are good that the fea-
ture is specific to the application or printer you’re using (in which case, the 
documentation for that program or printer should offer an explanation).
Printing a document
If everything has gone well so far, the actual act of printing a document is 
pretty simple. Just follow the steps here, and in a few minutes, pages should 
start popping out of your printer like magic. (In the sections that follow, I talk 
about some print options that you’ll probably need someday.)
 
1. Open a document that you want to print.
 
2. Choose File➪Print (or press Ô+P).
 
 You see the basic Print sheet, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
3. Click Print.
 
 Wait a few minutes for the network to tell the printer what to do and 
then walk over to your printer to get your document.
 
Figure 14-4: 
Your basic 
Print sheet.
 
 
Choosing File➪Print (Ô+P) won’t work for you if any one of the following is 
true for the software you’re using:
 
✓ The Print command is on a different menu.
 
✓ There is no Print command. (Hey, it could happen.)
 
✓ The Print keyboard shortcut is anything but Ô+P.

292
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
If any of the preceding is true for a program you’re using, you just have to 
wing it. Look in all the menus and check out the product’s documentation to 
try to get a handle on the Print command for that pesky program.
Choosing among different printers
Just as you can in the Page Setup sheet, you can choose which printer you 
want to use from the Printer pop-up menu of the Print sheet.
 
You can choose only among the printers you’ve added via the Print & Fax 
System Preferences pane, as I describe earlier in this chapter (in the section I 
lovingly refer to as “Setting up a printer for the first time”).
 
This includes printers connected to wireless base stations and routers. Once 
they’re set up, Macs (and PCs) within wireless range can print to these 
printers wirelessly.
Choosing custom settings
If you’ve created a custom group of settings previously, you can choose them 
from the Presets pop-up menu of the Print sheet. I touch more on this feature 
in the “Saving custom settings” section later in this chapter.
By default, the Print sheet is displayed in its simple state. As such, just three 
menus are available — Printer, Presets, and PDF as shown in Figure 14-4. To 
reveal the rest of the Print options, click the little triangle on the right side of 
the Printer menu. The expanded Print sheet then replaces the minimized one, 
as shown in Figure 14-5.
 
Figure 14-5: 
Your 
expanded 
Print sheet.
 

293
 Chapter 14: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
 
Click in any of the fields and then press the Tab key. Your cursor jumps to the 
next text field in the sheet; likewise, press Shift+Tab to make the cursor jump 
to the previous field. By the way, this shortcut works in almost any program, 
window, dialog, or Web page that has text fields.
 
✓ Copies: In this text field, set how many copies you want to print. The 
Print sheet defaults to one copy (1) in most applications, so you prob-
ably see the numeral 1 in the Copies field when the Print sheet appears. 
Assuming that’s the case, don’t do anything if you want to print only 
one copy. If you want to print more than one copy of your document, 
highlight the 1 that appears in the Copies field and replace it, typing the 
number of copies you want.
 
✓ Pages: Here, you find two radio buttons: All and From. The default 
behavior is to print your entire document, so the All option is prese-
lected. But if you want to print only a specific page or range of pages, 
mark the From radio button and then type the desired page numbers in 
the From and To text-entry boxes.
 
 Suppose that you print a 10-page document — and then notice a typo on 
Page 2. After you correct your error, you don’t have to reprint the whole 
document — only the page with the correction. Reprint only Page 2 by 
typing 2 in both the From and To fields. You can type any valid range 
of pages (um, you can’t print page 20 if your document is only 15 pages 
long) in the From and To fields.
 
✓ Paper Size: Use options in this pop-up menu to choose the type of 
paper currently in your printer’s paper tray — or to choose the size of 
the paper that you want to feed manually. The dimensions of the paper 
appear below its name.
 
 You’ve already seen this setting in Page Setup. The difference is that the 
settings here (in the Print sheet) apply only to this document, whereas 
the settings in Page Setup are the default for all documents and remain 
in effect until you change them in Page Setup. This can be very handy 
when, for example, you print an envelope. If you change the paper-size 
setting for the envelope document, you don’t have to remember to 
change it back to Letter in Page Setup.
 
✓ Orientation: Once again, you’ve seen this setting in Page Setup. And 
once again, the choice you make in Page Setup is the default for all pages 
you print. Keep in mind that the setting you choose here (in the Print 
sheet) applies only to this document.
 
 Choose among options here to tell your printer whether the page you 
want to print should be portrait-oriented or landscape-oriented.

294
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
The following list describes the features you can find in the unlabeled menu 
found in the expanded Print sheet (the one that says TextEdit in Figure 14-5). 
In addition to the TextEdit, Layout, and other options I cover in a moment,
your pop-up menu might offer options such as Quality & Media, Color Options, 
Special Effects, Borderless Printing, and so on. (Whether you have these 
options depends on your printer model and its driver.) Check out these options 
if you have ’em — they usually offer useful features:
 
✓ TextEdit: The only TextEdit–specific option, as shown in Figure 14-5, is 
a check box that you use to determine whether to print a header and 
footer for this document. 
 
✓ Layout: Choose Layout to set the number of pages per printed sheet, the 
layout direction, and whether you prefer a border. Here are your options 
for Layout:
 
• Pages per Sheet: Choose preset numbers from this pop-up menu to 
set the number of pages that you want to print on each sheet.
 
 Pages appear on-screen smaller than full size if you use this option.
 
• Layout Direction: Choose one of the four buttons that govern the 
way the small pages are laid out on the printed page.
 
• Border: Your choices from this pop-up menu are None, Single 
Hairline, Single Thin Line, Double Hairline, and Double Thin Line.
 
• Two-Sided: If your printer supports two-sided (known as duplex) 
printing, the three radio buttons allow you to specify whether 
you’re going to use two-sided printing and, if so, whether you’ll be 
binding (or stapling) along the long or short edge of the paper.
 
 There are also two check boxes — Reverse Page Orientation and Flip 
Horizontally — which do just what they say if you enable them. 
 
✓ Color Matching: Choose Color Matching to choose a color-conversion 
method (usually either Apple’s ColorSync or Vendor Matching technol-
ogy). The idea here is to get the printed page to look as much like what’s 
on your screen as possible.
 
✓ Paper Handling: Choose Paper Handling if you want to reverse the order 
in which your pages print or to print only the odd- or even-numbered 
pages. You can also specify whether the document’s paper size is to be 
used (in which case, you might have lines that break across pages) or 
whether the output should be scaled to fit the chosen paper size.
 
✓ Cover Page: Choose Cover Page to add a cover page.
 
✓ Scheduler: The Scheduler lets you set a later time for printing (say, 
while you’re asleep, at lunch, or in a meeting).
 
 There may or may not be additional items between the Scheduler and 
Summary items in this menu. If there are, they deal with options that 
apply specifically to your particular printer so you’re on your own.

295
 Chapter 14: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
 
✓ Summary: Select Summary to see the printing details for your docu-
ment, as shown in Figure 14-6. Look here for one final check to verify 
your print-job settings — how many copies you want, whether you want 
them collated, the page range of your print job, your layout choice(s), 
plus any settings specific to your particular printer or the application 
you’re printing from.

Summary 
for the

document. 
 
Saving custom settings
After you finalize printer settings, you can save them for future use. Just 
choose Save As from the Presets pop-up menu and name the collection of 
settings; from then on, that preset appears as an option in the Presets pop-up 
menu. Just choose your saved set before you print any document, and all the 
individual settings associated with that preset are restored.
Preview and PDF Options
To see a preview of what your printed page will look like, choose Open PDF in 
Preview from the PDF pop-up menu in the lower-left corner of the expanded 
Print sheet. When you do so, you see the page or pages that you’re about 
to print, displayed by the Preview application, as shown in Figure 14-7.

296

Figure 14-7: 
A preview 
of a TextEdit 
document.
 
If you have any doubt about the way a document will look when you print it, 
check out Preview first. When you’re happy with the document preview, just 
choose File➪Print, press Ô+P, or click the Print button at the bottom of the 
Preview window. Or click the Cancel button to return to your application and 
make changes to the document.
Preview works with the Preview application that Apple includes with Mac OS X. 
With the Preview feature, you can do cool things like these:
 
✓ See all the pages in your document the way they will be printed, one 
by one.
 
✓ Zoom in or out to get a different perspective on what you’re about to 
send to the printer (pretty cool!).
 
✓ Rotate the picture 90 degrees to the left or right.
 
✓ Spot errors before you commit to printing something. A little up-front 
inspection can save you a lot of paper, ink (or toner), and frustration.
 
Check out the Preview program’s View and Tools menus, as well as its toolbar. 
Here, you can zoom in or out, rotate your document, move forward or back-
ward (through multipage documents), and do other stuff. So I urge you to pull 
down the View and Tools menus and check ’em out. If you have a multipage 
document (or multiple documents) open, a sidebar pops out of the side of the 
window to let you move through the pages, as shown in Figure 14-6.

297

To hide the drawer if it’s visible or show it if it’s hidden, click the Sidebar 
button, choose View➪Sidebar➪Show/Hide Sidebar, or press Shift+Ô+D.
Just the Fax . . .
Mac OS X includes the capability to fax a document right from the Print 
sheet. But before you can take advantage of it you have to connect and add 
a fax modem. Fortunately, doing so is as easy as connecting and adding a 
printer (as described in the “Ready: Connecting and Adding Your Printer” 
section earlier in this chapter): Just follow the same steps, replacing the word 
“printer” with the words “fax modem,” and you’re good to go.
After your fax modem is connected and added, all you have to do to fax a 
document is choose Fax PDF from the PDF pop-up menu at the bottom of 
every Print sheet. When you do, the sheet becomes a Fax sheet, as shown in 
Figure 14-8.
 
Figure 14-8:

Leopard, 
faxing is just 
as easy as 
printing.
 
To fax a document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Fax PDF from the menu that appears when you press and hold 
the PDF pop-up menu on the Print sheet.

2. Type the fax phone number of the recipient in the To field.
 
 If you click the button with the silhouette on the right of the To field, you 
can select a recipient from the Mac OS X Address Book.
 
3. Add a dialing prefix if your phone requires one (such as 1, which 
most U.S. phones require to dial a ten-digit, long-distance phone 
number).
 
4. Click the Use Cover page check box if you want a cover page. If you 
do, you can type a subject in the Subject field and a brief message in 
the Message field.
 
5. Select your fax modem from the Printer pop-up menu, if it isn’t 
already selected (as mine, named Bluetooth, is in Figure 14-8).
 
 Everything else in the Fax sheet is just the same as in the Print sheet, 
which you can read all about in the previous sections.
 
6. Click the Fax button.
 
 Your fax is sent.
 
Before you try to fax something out into the world, make sure you have a func-
tioning modem — and that it’s configured, set up properly, connected to a phone 
line, and turned on. If you don’t get all those ducks in a row, this whole faxing 
process will (of course) fail. Note that most Macs sold in the past few years, 
including all Intel-based models, don’t include an analog modem, so they 
don’t have built-in hardware that supports faxing — you need to purchase a 
modem or other hardware to use this feature.
 
Snow Leopard supports a new Bluetooth feature known as Dial-Up Networking 
(DUN) Profile which, at least in theory, allows a Bluetooth-enabled mobile 
phone to act as a modem and connect to an Internet service provider (ISP) 
and the Internet. Unfortunately, after repeated experimentation I was unable 
to get any of my mobile phones to act as a fax modem. I only mention it 
because it’s entirely possible that it will work with your mobile phone. (If it 
does, please drop me a note at SnowLeopard4Dummies@boblevitus.com and 
let me know how you did it, what kind of phone you have, and what wireless 
carrier [for example, AT&T] you use. Thanks!)

H
ave you ever wanted to grab a file from your Mac while you were half-
way around the world or even around the corner? If so, I have good 
news for you: It’s not difficult with Mac OS X (believe it or not), even though 
computer networking in general has a well-deserved reputation for being 
complicated and nerve-wracking. The truth is that you won’t encounter 
anything scary or complicated about sharing files, folders, and disks (and 
printers, for that matter) among computers as long as the computers are 
Macintoshes. And if some of the computers are running Windows, Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard even makes that (almost) painless. Your Macintosh includes 
everything that you need to share files and printers — everything, that is, 
except the printers and the cables (and maybe a hub). So here’s the deal: You 
supply the hardware, and this chapter supplies the rest. And when you’re 
done hooking it all up, you can take a rest.
The first sections of this chapter provide an overview and tell you everything 
that you need to know to set up new user accounts and share files success-
fully. I don’t show you how to actually share a file, folder, or disk until the 
“Connecting to a Shared Disk or Folder on a Remote Mac” section later in this 
chapter. Trust me, there’s a method to my madness. If you try to share files 
without doing all the required prep work, the whole mess becomes confusing 
and complicated pretty fast — kind of like networking Windows PCs.
One last thing: If you’re the only one who uses your Mac, you don’t intend to 
share it or its files with anyone else, and you never intend to access your Mac 
from another computer in a different location, you can safely skip this whole 
chapter if you like.

Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Introducing Networks and File Sharing
Macintosh file sharing enables you to use files, folders, and disks from other 
Macs on a network — any network, including the Internet — as easily as 
though they were on your own local hard drive. If you have more than one 
computer, file sharing is a blessing.
Before diving in and actually sharing, allow me to introduce a few necessary 
terms:
 
✓ Network: For the purposes of this chapter, a network is two or more 
Macs connected by Ethernet cables, AirPort wireless networking, or 
FireWire cables (which are by far the least common type of network 
connection).
 
✓ Ethernet: A network protocol and cabling scheme that lets you connect 
two or more computers so they can share files, disks, printers, or 
whatever.
 
✓ Ethernet ports: Where you plug an Ethernet cable into your Mac.
 
 
 Be careful to match the cable to its specific jack. On your Mac and 
printer, the Ethernet ports look a lot like phone jacks, and the connec-
tors on each end of an Ethernet cable look a lot like phone cable connec-
tors. But they aren’t the same. Ethernet cables are typically thicker, and 
the connectors (RJ-45 connectors) are a bit larger than the RJ-11 connec-
tors that you use with telephones. (See examples of both types of ports 
in the margin.) When you connect an Ethernet cable to your Mac, you 
can’t put it into your RJ-11–friendly modem port (and you shouldn’t try). 
Standard phone cables fit (very loosely) into Ethernet ports, but you 
shouldn’t try that, either — they’ll probably fall out with the slightest 
vibration. It’s unlikely that either mistake will cause any permanent 
damage, but it won’t work and be frustrating.
 
✓ Local devices: Devices connected directly to your computers, such as 
hard or optical drives. Your internal hard drive, for example, is a local 
device.
 
✓ Remote devices: Devices you access (share) over the network. The hard 
drive of a computer in the next room, for example, is a remote device.
 
✓ Protocols: Kinds of languages that networks speak. When you read 
or hear about networks, you’re likely to hear the words AppleTalk, 
EtherTalk (or Ethernet), SMB, and TCP/IP bandied about with great regu-
larity. These are all protocols. Macs can speak several different proto-
cols, but every device (Mac or printer) on a network needs to speak the 
same protocol at the same time to communicate.
 
 Support for the TCP/IP protocol is built into every Mac. Your Mac includes 
all the software you need to set up a TCP/IP network; the hardware you 

301
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
provide consists of Ethernet cables and a hub (if you have more than two 
computers) or an AirPort base station. Here I’m using hub generically — 
its more powerful networking cousins, switches and routers, also work for 
this purpose. 
 
 By the way, in addition to providing wireless networking, the Apple 
AirPort and AirPort Extreme wireless base stations — as well as the 
Time Capsule device — are all members of the router class of devices. 
 
 The Time Capsule is a pretty cool deal — it combines a wireless base 
station, three-port Ethernet router, and a big hard disk that can be 
shared by all computers on the network and also used as a Time 
Machine backup disk. I talk more about Time Capsule in Chapter 17.
Portrait of home-office networking
A typical Mac home-office network consists of two Macintoshes, an AirPort 
Extreme wireless base station (or other type of Ethernet hub or router), and 
a network printer. Check out Figure 15-1 to see the configuration of a simple 
network. In the figure, the black lines between the devices are Ethernet 
cables; the rectangular device with those cables going into it is an Ethernet 
hub, router, AirPort or AirPort Extreme Base Station, or Time Capsule. (I tell 
you more about cables and such devices in the section “Three ways to build 
a network,” later in this chapter.) You need enough Ethernet cable to run 
among all your devices.

Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
With the setup shown in Figure 15-1, either Mac can use the other Mac’s files, 
and both Macs can print to the same printer.
 
If you have a broadband Internet connection, you can also connect the cable 
or DSL modem to the hub so all Mac users on the network can share the 
Internet connection.
 
A network can — and often does — have dozens or hundreds of users. 
Regardless of whether your network has 2 nodes (machines) or 2,000, the 
principles and techniques in this chapter apply.
Three ways to build a network
In this chapter, I assume you’re working on a small network, the kind typi-
cally found in a home or small business. If you’re part of a megamonstrous 
corporate network and you have questions about your particular network, 
talk to the PIC (person in charge, also known as your network administrator). 
If you’re trying to build one of these meganetworks, you need a book a lot 
thicker and harder to understand than this one.
The following list gives you three common ways to build a modern network:
 
✓ AirPort: If all your Macs are equipped with AirPort wireless cards and 
you have an AirPort or AirPort Extreme Base Station, you don’t need 
cables at all. Just plug in the base station, and Macs with AirPort cards 
can communicate with one another. If you use an Ethernet printer 
(connected to your Mac by Ethernet cable), you have to connect it to 
the base station before you can print from your wireless Macs. Both the 
Base Station and printer have Ethernet ports, so you can use a crossover 
cable (more about that in a minute) to make the connection.
File sharing made easy with Bonjour
Perhaps all you want to do is share an occa-
sional file (not necessarily a printer or a home 
Internet connection or a folder of music files 
or pictures). In that case, check out Bonjour, 
previously known as Rendezvous. It’s a zero-
configuration network protocol that makes 
Mac networking simple. If two devices (and this 
includes all Macs running Mac OS X Jaguar or 
later) speak Bonjour, you don’t have to do any 
configuration other than turning on the shar-
ing capability, as I explain in “Setting Up File 
Sharing,” later in this chapter. Bonjour queries 
the other available networked devices to see 
what services they support, and then config-
ures the connections for you automatically. 
Sweet!

303
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
 Recent vintage AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule devices from Apple 
include a USB port so you can connect any printer via USB and share it 
wirelessly (rather than having to use a more expensive Ethernet-
equipped “networkable” printer).
 
 Although this setup is more expensive than connecting everything 
with Ethernet cables and a cheap hub or router, it’s also more flexible 
because you can move your devices anywhere. (Well, almost anywhere; 
you’re limited to a maximum of 150–200 feet from each base station, and 
that’s assuming that there’s absolutely nothing in the way to block your 
signal. Your mileage may — and probably will — vary.)
 
✓ Small Ethernet: If you have only two devices to network (two Macs or 
a Mac and an Ethernet printer, in most cases), you can use an Ethernet 
cable to connect them directly to each other via the Ethernet ports. You 
can purchase an Ethernet cable at your local electronics store. Note: 
Some older Macs might require you to use a special kind of Ethernet 
cable known as a crossover cable.
 
 Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into one device and the other end 
into the other device. If it doesn’t work and one of the Macs is more than 
a few years old, try a crossover cable.
 
 An Ethernet crossover cable won’t work with a hub (as explained in the 
sidebar “To cross over or not”). Therefore, if you buy a crossover cable, 
label it clearly as a crossover cable because it looks exactly like a 
regular Ethernet cable, and you don’t want to become confused.
 
✓ Traditional Ethernet: All modern Macs have an Ethernet port. To con-
nect your Mac to a network, you need Ethernet cables for each Mac and 
a little device called a hub. (A hub is like the center of a wagon wheel; 
the wires coming out of it are the “spokes.”) A typical Ethernet hub 
includes two to eight Ethernet ports. You plug the hub into an electrical 
outlet and then connect Ethernet cables from each of your Macs and 
printers (from their Ethernet ports) to the hub. Voilà — instant network. 
Hubs are pretty cheap, starting below $10; cables start at a few bucks, 
increasing in price as the length and quality of the cable increase.
 
For each of these setups, if you have a cable modem or Digital Subscriber 
Line (DSL) as your Internet connection, you might need a router or switch 
instead of a hub. Routers and switches are similar to hubs but cost a bit more 
and have additional features that you might or might not need. Your ISP can 
tell you whether you’re going to need one. For what it’s worth, I have a cable 
modem, but it works fine with a cheap hub. 
If you use an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule, you may 
not need a hub or router; that’s because all these devices incorporate small 
routers (each with three Ethernet ports). So they’re all you need for up to 

304
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
three Ethernet devices. If, on the other hand, you have more than three 
Ethernet devices, you’ll need to add a hub or router with some 
additional Ethernet ports to accommodate them all.
Setting Up File Sharing
Before you get into the nitty-gritty of sharing files, you must complete a few 
housekeeping tasks, such as enabling the appropriate type of file sharing. 
Follow these steps to do so:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Sharing icon.
 
 The Sharing System Preferences pane appears. The long username of the 
first Admin account created on this computer appears in the Computer 
Name field by default.
 
2. If you want to change the name of your computer from whatever 
Snow Leopard decided to call it to something more personal, do that 
now in the Computer Name text field at the top of the Sharing pane.
 
 In Figure 15-2, you can see that I named mine MacBookPro. You can 
name yours anything you like.
 
3. Select the File Sharing check box as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
 Now other users on your network can access files and folders on your 
computer, as you see later in this chapter.
 
Figure 15-2: 
Turning file 
sharing on 
and off.
 

305
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
 By default only one folder in your Home folder is shared and that folder 
is your Public Folder. 
 
 If you want to access files or folders on this computer while you’re using 
another computer on the network, you can as long as you first provide 
your user name and password. Everyone else on the network can only 
see your Public Folder. 
 
 These are the safest settings. Unless you have good reason to tinker with 
them you should probably not change anything here. That said, if you 
feel you must change these settings, you find out how to do so in the 
next section of this chapter. 
 
4. (Optional) If you want remote users to upload and download files to 
and from this computer, click the Advanced button and then select 
any or all of the Share files and folders using FTP, AFP, or SMB check 
boxes.
 
• Doing so gives users on the Internet but not on your local area 
network some alternatives to file sharing: a File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP), an Apple File Protocol (AFP), or a client program that uses 
Server Message Block (Samba or SMB).
 
• If you want to enable Windows or Linux users — or users of other 
operating systems — to share files with you, either the FTP or the 
SMB check box must be selected.
 
 Other Mac users could use an FTP client to access your Mac, but they’ll 
probably want to use file sharing instead, as it’s easier.
 
 Security risks are involved in allowing FTP access. I strongly suggest that 
you go to the Apple Web site (www.apple.com) and read about them 
before you enable this feature.
 
5. Select the On check box (the leftmost column) for each account you 
want to enable to use these protocols to access your Mac.
 
6. Click the Done button when you’re done and then proceed to the section 
“Access and Permissions: Who Can Do What,” later in this chapter, to 
continue setting up your network.
Access and Permissions: Who 
Can Do What
After you set up file sharing (as I explain in the preceding section), your 
next step on the path to sharing files on a network is telling your Mac who is 
allowed to see and access specific folders. Luckily for you, this just happens 
to be what I cover in the following sections.

306
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Users and groups and guests
Macintosh file sharing (and indeed, Mac OS X as well) is based on the concept 
of users. You can share items — such as drives or folders — with no users, 
one user, or many users, depending on your needs.
 
✓ Users: People who share folders and drives (or your Mac) are users. A 
user’s access to items on your local hard drive is entirely at your discre-
tion. You can configure your Mac so only you can access its folders and 
drives, or so only one other person — or everyone — can share its fold-
ers and drives.
 
 When you first set up your Mac, you created your first user. This user 
automatically has administrative powers, such as adding more users, 
changing preferences, and having the clearance to see all folders on the 
hard drive.
 
 For the purposes of this book, I assume that some users for whom you 
create identities won’t be folks who actually sit at your Mac, but rather 
those who connect to it only from remote locations when they need to 
give or get files. But such a user could use the same name and password 
to log in while sitting at your desk.
Sharing with TCP/IP
Although you don’t need to know about TCP/
IP to set up your network, when you select the 
FTP Access check box or the Windows File 
Sharing check box on the Services tab of the 
Sharing dialog, you’re actually enabling TCP/IP 
access to this computer. TCP/IP is the network 
protocol used by Mac OS X Snow Leopard for 
sharing files. It enables Macs, PCs, and other 
computers to communicate with one another 
(sometimes, but not always, via the Internet), 
even if they’re running different operating sys-
tems. TCP/IP is always on, so you don’t have to 
do anything further about it.
Computers connect to one another by using 
a number-based addressing system (an IP 
address) that’s standard all over the world. 
You can (and most big companies do) use this 
system to communicate in offices and over the 
Internet.
If you need to know more about using TCP/IP to 
connect to computers on your network than I’ve 
told you here, talk to the system administrator 
or the network geek in charge of these things 
where you work. Also, I touch more on TCP/IP 
in the “Connecting to a Shared Disk or Folder on 
a Remote Mac” section later in this chapter — 
in particular, how to use it to connect to a Mac 
or other server that’s running it.

307
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
 For all intents and purposes, a remote user and a local user are the 
same. Here’s why: After you create an account for a user, that user can 
log in to this Mac while sitting in your chair in your office, from any-
where on your local area network via Ethernet, or anywhere in the world 
via the Internet.
 
✓ Administrative users: Although a complete discussion of the special 
permissions that a user with administrator permissions has on a Mac 
running Mac OS X is far beyond the scope of this book, note two 
important things:
 
• The first user created (usually when you install OS X for the first 
time) is automatically granted administrator (Admin) powers.
 
• Only an administrator can create new users, delete some (but not 
all) files from folders that aren’t in his or her Home folder, lock and 
unlock System Preferences panes, and a bunch of other stuff. If you 
try something and it doesn’t work, make sure you’re logged in as 
an Administrator.
 
 You can give any user administrator permissions by selecting that user’s 
account in the Accounts System Preferences pane and then selecting 
the Allow User to Administer This Computer check box. You can set this 
check box when you’re creating the user account, or subsequently if 
that works for you.
 
✓ Groups: Groups are UNIX-level designations for privilege consolidation. 
For example, there are groups named staff and wheel (as well as a bunch 
of others). A user can be a member of multiple groups. For example, 
your main account is in the wheel and Admin groups (and others, too). 
Don’t worry — you find out more about groups shortly.
 
✓ Guests: Two kinds of guests exist. The first kind lets your friends log into 
your Mac while sitting at your desk without user accounts or passwords. 
When they log out, all information and files in the guest account’s Home 
folder are deleted automatically.
 
 If you want this kind of guest account, you need to enable the Guest 
Account in the Accounts System Preferences pane. To do so click the 
Guest Account in the list of accounts on the left and then select the 
Allow Guests to Log In to This Computer check box. 
 
 The second kind of guest is people who access Public folders on your Mac 
via file sharing over your local area network or the Internet. They don’t 
need usernames or passwords. If they’re on your local network, they can 
see and use your Public folder(s), unless you or the Public folder’s owner 
has altered the permissions on one or more Public folders. If they’re on 
the Internet and know your IP address, they can see and use your Public 
folder(s). Public folders are all that guests can access, luckily.
 
 You don’t have to do anything to enable this type of guest account.

308
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Creating users
Before users can share folders and drives (or have their own accounts on 
your computer, for that matter), they must have an account on your Mac. You 
can create two different kinds of accounts for them — a User Account or a 
Sharing Account.
 
✓ When you create a User Account for a person (I call that person and 
account User 1), the account has its own Home folder (called — what 
else? — User 1), which is filled with User 1’s files. Nobody but User 1 can 
access files in this Home folder unless, of course, User 1 has provided 
someone the account name and password.
 
✓ When you create a Sharing Account for a person (I call that person and 
account Sharing 1), the person using that account doesn’t have a Home 
folder and can’t access other users’ Home folders. Sharing 1 can access 
only the Public folders inside all the Home folders on that Mac.
You can create a new User Account only in the Accounts System Preferences 
pane. You can create a Sharing Account in the Accounts or Sharing System 
Preferences panes.
 
When you click the + button under the Users list in the Sharing System 
Preferences pane and choose a contact in your Address Book (as opposed 
to choosing an existing user account), you create a Sharing account for 
that person. 
 
Anyone can remotely access files or folders in your Public folder(s) over a 
LAN (Local Area Network) or the Internet. But if you want them to be able to 
access folders or files other than those in the Public folder(s) on your Mac 
they need either a User Account or a Sharing Account. 
When you add (create) a user, you need to tell your Mac who this person is. 
This is also the time to set passwords and administrative powers for this new 
user. Here’s the drill:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon 
in the Dock), click the Accounts icon, and then make sure that the 
Password tab is selected.
 
 The Accounts System Preferences pane appears. In this pane (shown in 
Figure 15-3), you can see the name of the first user (Bob LeVitus) and 
the administrative control that this user is allowed. (Note that the Allow 
User to Administer This Computer check box is selected.)
 
 As I mention previously, the first user created (usually at the same time 
you installed OS X) always has administrator permissions.

2. Click the + button beneath the list of users.
 
 A sheet appears in which you enter the new user’s information.
 
 If the + button is dimmed, here’s how you get it functioning: First click 
the lock (at lower left), supply an administrator name and password 
in the resulting dialog, and then click OK.
 
3. Choose Standard from the New Account menu at the top of the sheet.
 
4. In the Name text box, type the full name of a user you want to add.
 
 In the Account Name text box, your Mac inserts a suggested abbreviated 
name (formerly known as the short name). Check out Figure 15-4 to 
see both.
 
 In Figure 15-4, I added Steven P. Jobs as a user, typing the full name in 
the Name field. You don’t really need to type the user’s full name, but I 
do so in this example to show you the difference between a name and a 
short name.
 
5. Press the Tab key to move to the next field.
 
 Mac OS X suggests an abbreviated version of the name in the Account 
Name field (as shown in Figure 15-4).
 
 Because he’s the only Steve who matters around here, I change the sug-
gested Account Name from stevenpjobs to just plain steve, which 
is shorter than the short name recommended by Mac OS X. (In other 
words, I type steve in the Account Name field, replacing the suggested 
stevenpjobs.)

310
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
 The name of each user’s folder (in the Users folder) is taken from the 
short name that you enter when you create a user.
 
 Users can connect to your Mac (or log in to their own Macs, for that matter) 
by using the short name, rather than having to type their full names. The 
short name is also used in environments in which usernames can’t have 
spaces and are limited to eight or fewer characters. Although OS X Snow 
Leopard allows longer usernames (but no spaces), you might be better off 
keeping your short name shorter than eight characters, just in case.
 
 Be sure you’re happy with the short name you’ve chosen — there’s no 
easy way to change it after you create the account.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Name the 
new user; 
your Mac 
suggests a 
short name.
 
 
6. Tab to the Password field and enter an initial password for this user.
 
 The small, square button with the key to the right of the Password 
field, when clicked, displays the Password Assistant. You can use the 
Password Assistant to help generate a password that should be fairly 
easy for the user to remember but hard for a cracking program to guess 
(or meet other requirements).
 
 To make your password even harder to guess or crack, choose Random 
or FIPS-181-compliant from the Password Assistant’s Type pop-up menu.
 
7. Press the Tab key to move your cursor to the Verify text field.
 
8. In the Verify text box, type the password again to verify it.

311
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
9. (Optional) To help remember a password, type something in the 
Password Hint text box to jog the user’s memory.
 
 If a user forgets his or her password and asks for a hint, the text that you 
type in the Password Hint field pops up, hopefully causing the user to 
exclaim, “Oh, yeah . . . now I remember!” A password hint should be 
something simple enough to jog the user’s memory but not so simple 
that an unauthorized person can guess. Perhaps something like “Your 
first teddy bear’s name backward” would be a good hint.
 
10. (Optional) Select the Turn on FileVault Protection check box if you 
want to encrypt this user’s Home folder with FileVault.
 
 You can find out more about FileVault security in Chapter 17.
 
 Several serious implications result from enabling FileVault. I strongly rec-
ommend that you read every word about FileVault in Chapter 17 before 
you even consider turning it on.
 
11. Click the Create Account button to create the account.
 
 The sheet disappears, and the new user now appears in the Accounts 
System Preferences pane’s Users list.
 
12. (Optional) Click the account picture to the left of the Name and Short 
Name fields and choose a different one.
 
 Mac OS X suggests a picture from its default collection for each account, 
but you can select a different one from the pop-up mini-window shown 
in Figure 15-5, drag one in from the Finder (or iPhoto), or take a photo 
with an attached or built-in camera (such as an iSight) by choosing Edit 
Picture.
 
13. (Optional) Type the user’s MobileMe user name.

Changing a user
Circumstances might dictate that you need to change a user’s identity, pass-
word, or accessibility, or perhaps delete a user. Follow these steps to change 
a user’s name, password, or administration permissions:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon 
in the Dock).
 
 The System Preferences window appears.
 
2. In the System Preferences window, click the Accounts icon.
 
 The Accounts System Preferences pane appears.
 
 If the lock icon at the bottom of the window is locked, you have to click 
it and provide an administrator password before you can proceed.
 
3. Select the user’s name in the accounts list.
 
 The information for that person appears.
 
4. Make your changes by selecting the existing username and then 
replacing the old with new text or a different setting.
 
• If you want to change the password, click the Reset Password 
button and make your changes in the sheet that appears.
 
• To change the picture or other capabilities, click the Picture, Login 
Options, Allow User to Administer This Computer (to make this 
user an administrator on this Mac), or Enable Parental Control 
check box (more on this in a moment) and make the appropriate 
changes.
 
 To change a user, you must be logged in using an account that has 
administrator powers.
 
5. Quit the System Preferences application or choose a different System 
Preferences pane.
 
 Your changes are saved when you leave the Accounts pane.
Removing a user
To delete a user — in effect, to deny that user access to your Mac — select 
the user you want to delete in the list of accounts and then click the – button. 
A sheet appears, offering three choices: 
 
✓ Save the Home folder in a disk image saves a disk image of the user’s 
Home folder in a folder named “Deleted Users” (which it creates inside 
the Users folder).

313
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
✓ Don’t change the Home folder removes the user from the Accounts 
System Preference pane and login screen but leaves that user’s Home 
folder in the Users folder. (Deleted) is appended to the folder’s name, 
so if I had selected this option in the previous example, Steven P. Jobs’ 
Home folder would be renamed steve (Deleted).
 
✓ Delete the Home folder does what it says. 
 
To remove a user from your Mac, you must be logged in using an account that 
has administrator permissions.  
Limiting a user’s capabilities
Sometimes — especially with younger children or computerphobic family 
members — you want to limit what users can access. For example, you might 
want to make certain programs off limits. You do this by clicking the Parental 
Controls button in the Accounts System Preferences pane.
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon 
in the Dock).
 
 The System Preferences window appears.
 
2. In the System Preferences window, click the Accounts icon.
 
 The Accounts System Preferences pane appears.
 
3. Click the user’s name to select it, click the Enable Parental Controls 
check box, and then click the Open Parental Controls button.
 
 Note that clicking the Open Parental Controls button also checks the 
Enable Parental Controls checkbox.
 
 To change any of these items, you must be logged in using an account 
that has administrator powers, and the account you’re modifying can’t 
have administrator powers.
 
 The Parental Controls screen for that person appears. It has five tabs — 
System (shown in Figure 15-6), Content, Mail & Chat, Time Limits, and Logs.
 
4. Set the controls in each of the five tabs.
 
• System: Determine which applications the user may access. Set 
whether she can print, burn optical discs, modify the Dock, 
or access System Preferences. Also determine whether she’s 
restricted to a very limited and simplified Finder interface.
 
• Content: Hide profanity in the Dictionary and control access to 
Web sites.

314
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
• Mail & iChat: Provide a list of approved iChat and Mail communi-
cants. This option also lets you notify someone (usually yourself) 
when the user tries to exchange e-mail with a contact not in the 
approved list.
 
• Time Limits: Set time limits for weekdays and weekends, and pre-
vent access to this computer during specified hours on school 
nights and weekends.
 
• Logs: Monitor Web sites visited, Web sites blocked, applications 
used, and chat activity.
 
5. Quit the System Preferences application or choose a different System 
Preferences pane.
 
 Your changes are saved when you leave the Accounts pane.
 
Another way to set or change Parental Controls is to click the Parental 
Controls icon in the System Preferences application (instead of Accounts).
 
Figure 15-6: 
You can 
control an 
account’s 
access 
in five 
categories. 
 
Last but not least, you can apply Parental Controls to the Guest Account but 
you can’t apply them to any account that has administrator permissions.

315
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
Mac OS X knows best: Folders 
shared by default
When you add users in the Accounts System Preferences pane as I describe 
earlier, Mac OS X automatically does two things behind the scenes to facili-
tate file sharing: It creates a set of folders, and it makes some of them avail-
able for sharing.
Each time you add a user, Mac OS X creates a Home folder hierarchy for that 
user on the Mac. The user can create more folders (if necessary) and also 
add, remove, or move anything inside these folders. Even if you create a 
user account solely to allow him or her to exchange files with you, your Mac 
automatically creates a Home folder for that user. Unless you, as the owner 
of your Mac, give permission, the user can’t see inside or use folders outside 
the Home folder (which has the user’s name), with only three exceptions: the 
Shared folder in the Users folder, the top level of other user account folders, 
and the Public and Shared folders in every other user’s folder. A description 
of the latter follows:
 
✓ Public: A Public folder is located inside each user’s folder. That folder is 
set up to be accessible (shared) by any user who can log in to the Mac. 
Furthermore, any user can log in (as a guest) and copy things out of 
this folder as long as he knows your Mac’s IP address, even if he doesn’t 
have an account on this Mac at all. Files put into the Public folder can be 
opened or copied freely.
 
 It’s not hard for someone to obtain your IP address. For example, when 
you visit most Web pages, your IP address is saved to that site’s log file. 
So be careful what you put in your Public folder.
 
 Inside each user’s Public folder is a Drop Box folder. As the name 
implies, this folder is where others can drop a file or folder for you. Only 
the owner can open the Drop Box to see what’s inside — or to move or 
copy the files that are in it. Imagine a street-corner mailbox — after you 
drop your letter in, it’s gone, and you can’t get it back out.
 
✓ Shared: In addition to a Public folder for each user, Mac OS X creates 
one Shared folder on every Mac for all users of this Mac. The Shared 
folder isn’t available to guests, but it’s available to all users who have 
an account on this machine. You find the Shared folder within the 
Users folder (the same folder where you find folders for each user). 
The Shared folder is the right place to put stuff that everyone with an 
account on this Mac might want to use. (If you haven’t already, check 
out my introduction to the Mac OS Snow Leopard folder structure in 
Chapter 6.)

316
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Sharing a folder or disk 
by setting permissions
As you might expect, permissions control who can use a given folder or any 
disk (or partition) other than the startup disk.
 
Why can’t you share the startup disk? Because Mac OS X won’t let you. Why 
not? Because the startup disk contains the operating system and other stuff 
that nobody else should have access to.
 
Throughout the rest of this chapter, whenever I talk about sharing a folder, I 
also mean sharing disks and disk partitions other than your startup disk (which, 
when you think of it, are nothing more than big folders anyway). Why am I 
telling you this? Because it’s awkward to keep typing “a folder or any disk (or 
partition) other than your startup disk.” So anything that I say about sharing 
a folder also applies to sharing any disk (or partition) other than your startup 
disk. Got it?
You can set permissions for:
 
✓ The folder’s owner
 
✓ A subset of all the people who have accounts on the Mac (a group)
 
✓ Everyone who has the Mac’s address, whether they have an account or 
not (guests)
To help you get a better handle on these relationships, a closer look at per-
missions, owners, and groups is coming right up.
Contemplating permissions
When you consider who can use which folders, three distinct kinds of users 
exist on the network. I describe each of them in this section. Then, in the 
“Useful settings for permissions” section, later in this chapter, I show you 
how to share folders with each type of user. Here’s a quick introduction to 
the different user types:
 
✓ Owner: The owner of a folder or disk can change the permissions to 
that folder or disk at any time. The name you enter when you log in to 
your Mac — or the name of your Home folder — is the default owner 
of Shared folders and drives on that machine. Ownership can be given 
away (more on that in the “Useful settings for permissions” section, later 
in this chapter). Even if you own the Mac, you can’t change permissions 
for a folder on it that belongs to another user (unless you get UNIX-y and 
do so as root). The owner must be logged in to change permissions on 
his or her folders.

317
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
 Mac OS X is the owner of many folders outside the Users folder. If OS X 
owns it, you can see that system is its owner if you select the folder and 
choose File➪Get Info (or press Ô+I). 
 
 Folders that aren’t in the User directories generally belong to system; 
it’s almost always a bad idea to change the permissions on any folder 
owned by system.
 
 If you must change permissions on a file or folder, select its icon and 
choose File➪Get Info (shortcut: Ô+I), and then change the settings in 
the Sharing & Permissions section at the bottom of the resulting Get Info 
window. I urge you not to change permission settings if you’re not abso-
lutely sure of what you’re doing and why. 
 
✓ Group: In UNIX systems, all users belong to one or more groups. The 
group that includes everyone who has an account with administrator 
permissions on your Mac is called Admin. Everyone in the Admin group 
has access to Shared and Public folders over the network, as well as 
to any folder that the Admin group has been granted access to by the 
folder’s owner.
 
 For the purposes of assigning permissions, you can create your own 
groups the same way you create a user account: Open the Accounts 
System Preferences pane, click the little plus sign, choose Group from 
the Type pop-up menu, type the name of the group, and then click the 
Create Group button.
 
 The group appears in the list of users on the left, and eligible accounts 
appear with check boxes on the right, as shown in Figure 15-7.
 
Figure 15-7: 
This group, 
Outsiders, 
contains my 
Parrothead 
and Steven 
P. Jobs 
accounts.
 

318
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
✓ Everyone: This category is an easy way to set permissions for everyone 
with an account on your Mac at the same time. Unlike the Admin group, 
which includes only users with administrative permissions, this one 
includes, well, everyone (everyone with an account on this Mac, that is).
 
 If you want people without an account on this Mac to have access to a 
file or folder, that file or folder needs to go in your Public folder, where 
the people you want to see it can log in as guests.
Sharing a folder
Suppose you have a folder you want to share, but it has slightly different 
rules than those set up for the Public folder, for the Drop Box folder within 
the Public folder, or for your personal folders. These rules are permissions, 
and they tell you how much access someone has to your stuff.
Actually, the rules governing Shared and Public folders are permissions, too, 
but they’re set up for you when Mac OS X is installed.
 
I suggest that you share only folders located in your Home folder (or a folder 
within it). Because of the way UNIX works, the UNIX permissions of the enclosing 
folder can prevent access to a folder for which you do have permissions. Trust 
me, if you share only the folders in your Home folder, you’ll never go wrong. If 
you don’t take this advice, you could wind up having folders that other users 
can’t access, even though you gave them the appropriate permissions.
By the way, you can set permissions for folders within your Public folder (like 
the Drop Box folder) that are different from those for the rest of the folder.
 
I said this before, but it bears repeating: Whenever I talk about sharing a 
folder, I also mean sharing disks — and disk partitions other than your 
startup disk (which you just can’t share, period). So don’t forget that anything 
I say about sharing a folder also applies to sharing any disk (or partition) 
other than your startup disk. Though you can’t explicitly share your startup 
disk, anyone with administrator access can mount it for sharing from across 
the network (or Internet).
To share a folder with another user, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon 
in the Dock).
 
 The System Preferences window appears.
 
2. In the System Preferences window, click the Sharing icon.
 
 The Sharing System Preferences pane appears.
 
3. Click File Sharing in the list of services on the left.
 
 The lists of shared folders and their users appear on the right, as shown 
in Figure 15-8.

Recipes 
folder for

Everyone.
 
 
4. Click the + (plus) button under the Shared Folders column to add the 
folder you wish to share (Recipes in Figure 15-8).
 
 If you remember the discussion of the Get Info window back in Chapter 5, 
I said I would tell you more about the Shared Folder check box in this 
chapter. This is where I do just that. If you select the Shared Folder 
check box in a folder’s Get Info window, that folder already appears in 
the list of Shared Folders so you won’t have to bother with Step 4. 
 
 Alas, while checking the Shared Folder check box in a folder’s Get Info 
window causes it to appear in the Sharing System Preference pane’s 
Shared Folders list, you still have to complete the steps that follow to 
assign that folder’s users and privileges. 
 
5. Click the + (plus) button under the Users column to add a user or 
group if the user or group you desire isn’t already showing in the 
Users column (Lisa LeVitus in Figure 15-8).
 
6. Click the double-headed arrow to the right of a user or group name 
and change its privileges.
 
 I’m changing the permission for Everyone from Read & Write to No 
Access in Figure 15-8.
 
 You can choose among three types of access for each user or group, as 
shown in Table 15-1.
 
 If you’re the folder’s owner (or have administrator access), you can 
click the padlock icon and change the owner and/or group for the file or 
folder.

Table 15-1 
Privileges
Permission
What It Allows
Read & Write
A user with Read & Write access can see, add, delete, 
move, and edit files just as though they were stored on his 
or her own computer.
Read Only
A Read Only user can see and use files that are stored in a 
Shared folder but can’t add, delete, move, or edit them.
Write Only 
(Drop Box)
Users can add files to this folder but can’t see what’s in it. 
The user must have read access to the folder containing a 
Write Only folder.
No Access
With no permissions, a user can neither see nor use your 
Shared folders or drives.
Useful settings for permissions
The following sections show you just some of the most common ways that 
you can combine permissions for a folder. You’ll probably find one option 
that fits the way you work and the people you want to share with.
 
Owner permissions — in this case, single silhouette; bobl (Me) in Figure 15-9 — 
must be at least as expansive as Group permissions (double silhouette; 
Admin in Figure 15-9) and Group permissions must be at least as expansive as 
Everyone’s permissions (triple silhouette; everyone in Figure 15-9). So to set 
the Everyone privilege to Read & Write, the Group and Owner privileges must 
also be set to Read & Write.
 
In the following examples I show how to set permissions in the Sharing System 
Preferences pane. Another way to set permissions is by selecting an icon in 
the Finder and choosing File➪Get Info (shortcut: Ô+I), and then changing the 
settings in the Sharing & Permissions section at the bottom of the resulting 
Get Info window. The two methods are pretty much interchangeable so you 
can use whichever is more convenient.
 
Figure 15-9: 
Allow 
everyone

you want.
 

321
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
Allow everyone access
In Figure 15-9, I configure settings that allow everyone on a network to access 
the Bob’s Downloads folder. Everyone can open, read, and change the con-
tents of this Shared folder. Do this by choosing Read & Write for Others 
from the pop-up menu to the right of the user’s name in the Sharing System 
Preferences pane or the folder’s Get Info window.
Allow nobody but yourself access
The settings shown in Figure 15-10 reflect appropriate settings that allow 
owner-only access to the Bob’s Downloads folder. No one but me can see or 
use the contents of this folder. Members of the Administrators group can 
drop files and folders into this folder (see Drop Box section). Use the pop-up 
menus to choose Write Only (Drop Box) as the Administrators privilege and 
No Access as the Everyone privilege. 
 
Figure 15-10:

access for 
no one but

Allow all administrative users of this Mac access
Check out Figure 15-11 to see settings that allow the group Admin (in addi-
tion to the owner, bobl) access to see, use, or change the contents of the 
Bob’s Downloads folder. Use the pop-up menu to choose Read & Write for the 
Administrators privilege.

Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Allow others to deposit files and folders without 
giving them access (a Drop Box)
The settings in Figure 15-12 enable everyone to drop their own files or folders 
in the Bob’s Downloads folder without being able to see or use the contents 
of the Shared folder. After a file or folder is deposited in a drop folder, the 
dropper can’t retrieve it because he or she doesn’t have permission to see 
the items in the drop folder.
 
Figure 15-12: 
Everyone 
can drop 
files and 
folders into 
this folder. 
 
Read-only bulletin boards
If you want everyone to be able to open and read the files and folders in 
this Shared folder — but not to modify them — choose Read Only from the 
pop-up menus for Group and Others. If you do this, however, only the owner 
can make changes to files in this folder.
One more privilege 
The Apply to Enclosed Items button, at the bottom of the Sharing and 
Permissions section of Get Info window, does exactly what its name implies. 
This feature (which is only available in Get Info windows and doesn’t appear 
in the Sharing System Preferences pane) is a fast way to assign the same 
permissions to many subfolders at the same time. After you set permissions 
for the enclosing folder the way you like them, click this button to give these 
same permissions to all folders inside it.
 
Be careful — there is no Undo for this action.
Unsharing a folder
To unshare a folder that you own, change the permissions for every other 
user and/or group to No Access. When you do, nobody but you has access to 
that folder.
If you’re not sure how to do this, see the “Sharing a folder” and “Useful set-
tings for permissions” sections, earlier in this chapter.

323
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
Connecting to a Shared Disk 
or Folder on a Remote Mac
After you set up sharing and assign permissions, you can access folders 
remotely from another computer. (Just make sure first that you have the cor-
rect administrative permissions to it.)
 
File sharing must be activated on the Mac where the shared files/folders 
reside; it doesn’t have to be activated on the Mac that’s accessing the files/
folders. When file sharing is turned off, you can still use that Mac to access 
a remote Shared folder on another machine as long as its owner has granted 
you enough permissions and has file sharing enabled.
If file sharing is turned off on your Mac, others won’t be able to access your 
folders, even if you’ve assigned permissions to them previously.
 
If you’re going to share files and you leave your Mac on and unattended for a 
long time, logging out before you leave it is a very good idea. This prevents 
anyone who just walks up to your Mac from seeing your files, e-mail, applica-
tions, or anything else that’s yours — unless you’ve given that person a user 
account that has permissions for your files.
On to how to access your Home folder from a remote Mac — a supercool 
feature that’s only bound to get more popular as the Internet continues to 
mature.
 
The following steps assume that you have an account on the remote Mac, 
which means you have your own Home folder on that Mac.
To connect to a Shared folder on a Mac other than the one you’re currently 
on, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that you’re already set up as a user on the computer that 
you want to log in to (Lisa & Jacob’s Eye Mac, in this example).
 
 If you need to know how to create a new user, see the “Creating users” 
section, earlier in the chapter.
 
2. On the computer that you’re logging in from (MacBookPro, in this 
example), click the disclosure triangle to open the Shared section in 
the Sidebar if it’s not already open.
 
 All available servers appear. (There are two — DoctorTimeCapsule and 
Lisa & Jacob’s Eye Mac — in this example.)
 
3. Click the name of the remote Mac you want to access in the Sidebar.
 
 At this point you’re connected to the remote Mac as a guest, as shown in 
Figure 15-13.

324
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
Figure 15-13: 
Connecting 
to Lisa & 
Jacob’s Eye 
Mac as a 
guest.
 
 
4. Click the Connect As button.
 
 The Connect dialog appears. The name of the person logged in on 
MacBookPro automatically appears in the Name field (Bob LeVitus in 
Figure 15-14).
 
 If that’s not your user name on the Mac you’re trying to access, type that 
username in the Name field.
 
5. Select the Guest radio button if you don’t have an account on the 
remote computer and then click Connect. If you’re logging in as a 
user, skip to Step 6.
 
 Pressing Ô+G is the same as marking the Guest radio button, and pressing 
Ô+R is the same as marking the Registered User radio button.
 
 As a guest user, you see Public Folders for users who have accounts on 
Lisa & Jacob’s Eye Mac (Lisa LeVitus, Bob LeVitus, and Jacob in 
Figure 15-13) but nothing else. 
 
Figure 15-14: 
The Connect 
dialog 
needs my 
password.
 

325
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
6. Type your password and click the Connect button.
 
 Once I’ve connected as a registered user (somebody like me in this 
example), however, I see my Home folder (bobl in Figure 15-15) in addi-
tion to everyone else’s Public folder.
 
 If you select the Remember This Password in My Keychain check box 
in the Connect dialog, Mac OS X remembers your password for you the 
next time you connect to this server. Sweet!
 
Figure 15-15: 
Connecting 
to Lisa & 
Jacob’s 
Eye Mac as 
Bob LeVitus 
(bobl). 
 
 
 File sharing must be active on Lisa & Jacob’s Eye Mac (the Mac I’m 
accessing remotely in the example). If file sharing weren’t active on Lisa 
& Jacob’s Eye Mac, its name wouldn’t appear in the Shared section of the 
sidebar, and I wouldn’t be able to connect to it. But file sharing doesn’t 
have to be active on the computer you’re using (MacBookPro in this exam-
ple) to give you access to the remote computer and make this trick work.
 
 If Lisa & Jacob’s Eye Mac had more than one hard disk (it doesn’t) and 
the user accessing that Mac remotely has administrator permissions on 
that Mac (as I do), I would have seen folders representing any and all of 
the other hard drives connected to that Mac in Figures 15-13 and 15-15.
 
 When you access your Home folder on a remote Mac as I’ve done in this 
example, you see an icon with the short name of your Home folder on 
that Mac (bobl in Figure 15-16) on the Desktop of the Mac you’re using.

A disk 
icon with 
its short 
name (bobl) 
appears on 
my Desktop.  
 
7. When you finish using the remote Mac, disconnect by using one of 
these methods:
 
• Drag the shared-volume icon (bobl in Figure 15-16) to the Eject 
icon in the Dock.
 
 When a disk or volume is selected (highlighted), the Trash icon 
turns into a little arrow, which represents eject. Nice touch, eh?
 
• Right-click or Control + click the shared volume icon, and then 
choose Eject from the contextual menu that appears.
 
• Select the shared-volume icon and choose File➪Eject.
 
• Select the shared-volume icon and press Ô+E.
 
• In a Finder window Sidebar, click the little Eject symbol to the right 
of the remote computer’s name (Lisa & Jacob’s Eye Mac in 
Figure 15-16).
 
• If you’ve finished working for the day and you don’t leave your 
Mac on 24/7 (as most folks do), choose Ú➪Shut Down or Log Out. 
Shutting down or logging out automatically disconnects you from 
shared disks or folders. (Shut Down also turns off your Mac.)
Changing Your Password
You can change your password at any time. Changing your password is a 
good idea if you’re concerned about security — for example, if there’s a 
chance your password has been discovered by someone else.
You can change the password for your account on your own Mac, or you can 
change the password you use to connect to your account on a remote Mac. I 
show you how to do both in the following sections.

327
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

earlier in this chapter, if you don’t know how to log in to a remote computer.
 
 The Connect dialog appears.
 
2. Type your username in the Connect dialog if it’s not already there.
 
3. Click the Action button (the one that looks like a little gear) in the 
Connect dialog, and then choose Change Password from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 A sheet for changing your password appears.
 
 The other choice in the Actions pop-up is Options. The sheet that 
appears includes several options for encrypting your password, as it is 
sent over the network.
 
4. Type your current password in the Old Password field.
 
5. Type your new password in the New Password and Verify fields.
 
6. Click the Change Password button.
 
 Your password is changed, and you return to the Connect dialog.

329
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
7. (Optional) Type your new password and then click Connect to log in 
to the other Mac.
 
 You can skip this step by clicking the Cancel button in the Connect 
dialog if you don’t need to use anything on the remote Mac at this time. 
Your password is still changed, and you need to use the new password 
the next time you log in to this Mac.
 
 Select the Add Password to Keychain check box in the Connect dialog 
to store your passwords in a single place on the Mac; this way you 
don’t have to retype them each time you access a Mac or other remote 
resource. (Read more about the Keychain in Chapter 18.)
Five More Types of Sharing
Several more types of sharing exist, and I’d like to at least mention a few in 
passing. All are found in (where else?) the Sharing System Preferences pane, 
which you can find by launching the System Preferences application (from 
the Applications folder, Ú menu, or Dock) and clicking the Sharing icon.
Printer Sharing
This one’s a snap. If you turn on Printer Sharing in the Sharing System 
Preferences pane, other people on your local network can use any printer 
connected to your computer.
Internet Sharing
If your Mac has an Internet connection and another Mac nearby doesn’t, you 
can enable Internet Sharing, and that Mac can share your Internet connec-
tion. The following steps show you how:
 
1. Open the Sharing System Preferences pane by launching the System 
Preferences application (from the Applications folder, Ú menu, or Dock) 
and clicking the Sharing icon.
 
2. Select the check box for Internet Sharing in the list of services on the left. 
 
3. Choose the connection you want to share — Bluetooth, AirPort, or 
Ethernet — from the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu.

330

4. Select the check boxes next to connections other computers will use — 
AirPort, Built-In Ethernet, or Built-In FireWire.
 
 Figure 15-17 shows Internet Sharing configured to share my Ethernet 
Internet connection with another Mac by using AirPort. 
 
5. (Optional) Click the AirPort Options button to name, select a wireless 
channel for, enable encryption for, and/or set a password for your 
shared network.
 
 That’s all there is to it.
 
Figure 15-17:

Web Sharing
Web Sharing enables others to share documents on your computer through 
the Web. You can set up a Web site just by adding HyperText Markup 
Language (HTML) pages and images to the Sites folder in your Home folder 
and then activating Web Sharing in the Sharing pane of System Preferences.
 
Web Sharing works only while your Mac is connected to the Internet or an 
internal network. And it requires the speed of a direct connection. If you use a 
modem and connect to the Internet by dialing up, this application won’t be a 
lot of use to you.

331
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
 
Furthermore, even if you keep your modem connected to the Internet 24 hours 
a day with a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable-modem connection, using 
this feature could violate your agreement with your Internet service provider 
(ISP) because some ISPs prohibit you from hosting a Web site. Also, most 
cable and DSL connections use dynamic IP address assignment through 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which means your IP address 
will change from time to time.
On the other hand, some ISPs don’t care whether you run a Web site. Check 
with yours if you’re concerned. I do turn on this feature occasionally, but 
(because I don’t use it 24/7) I never bothered to check with my ISP. Do me a 
favor and don’t rat me out.
Bluetooth Sharing
If you have a Bluetooth mobile phone or PDA and your Mac has Bluetooth, 
you can configure many of the default behaviors for transferring files to and 
from your Mac. A picture is worth a thousand words, so Figure 15-18 shows 
all the things Bluetooth Sharing lets you configure.

Pssst . . . want to know a secret?
At this point, I must confess that I’ve been keep-
ing something from you: The MacBookPro you’ve 
been seeing in examples and screen shots in this 
book isn’t my “real” Mac. Rather, it’s a “spare” 
laptop I keep around for projects like this book. 
MacBookPro has been totally sanitized so 
that all that it contains is Mac OS X 10.6 Snow 
Leopard — nothing more and nothing less. 
It has none of my usual modifications — there’s 
no third-party software installed, no cool stuff 
in my Dock, and none of the useful doodads I 
like to install in my menu bar. The reason I do all 
this is so you, gentle reader, won’t be confused, 
and the screen shots in this book don’t show 
anything that’s not 100 percent Mac OS X 10.6 
Snow Leopard. 
My “real” Mac, the one I’m using as I type 
these words in Microsoft Word and edit the 
screen shots in Adobe Photoshop, is actually 
a tricked-out, quad-processor Mac Pro with a 
24-inch display and seven external hard disks. 
The point is, I use my real Mac for the writing 
and editing and use Screen Sharing to grab 
screen shots from MacBookPro. 
Here’s what it looked like while I was working 
on this chapter: 
In the middle of the picture is the Screen Sharing 
window showing me what’s on the screen of 
MacBookPro. MacBookPro is actually sitting 
on a workbench about 10 feet from my desk but 
I am controlling it with the keyboard and mouse 
on my “real” Mac. 
In the figure, notice that my real desktop isn’t 
white. Rather, it’s a picture of a real snow leop-
ard. Also notice the Word document of this chap-
ter is behind the MacBookPro Screen Sharing 
window on the right, and Figure 15-18, which I 
just finished editing in Photoshop, is behind it on 
the left. Finally, if you look closely you can see 
that my real Dock and menu bar are chock-full 
of icons you probably don’t recognize. 
I love every one of the icons in my Dock and 
menu bar. I use all of them regularly and would 
love to tell you about each and every one. Alas, 
they have nothing whatsoever to do with Snow 
Leopard and my editor is screaming at me to 
end this chapter, so that’s what I’ll do.

333
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
Screen Sharing
I saved the best for last . . . . Screen Sharing lets you control another Mac on 
your network from your Mac. In essence, you see the other Mac’s screen on 
your Mac — and control it using your mouse and keyboard.
To set up Screen Sharing on the Mac you want to control remotely, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the Sharing System Preferences pane by launching the System 
Preferences application (from the Applications folder, Ú, or Dock) 
and clicking the Sharing icon.
 
2. Select the check box for Screen Sharing in the list of services on the left. 
 
3. Click either the All Users or Only These Users radio button. 
 
 If you clicked Only These Users, click the + button and add the user or 
users you want to allow to control this Mac remotely. 
To take control of your Mac from another Mac, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the disclosure triangle to open the Shared section in the Sidebar 
if it’s not already open.
 
 All available servers appear.
 
2. Click the name of the remote Mac you want to control remotely. 
 
3. Click the Share Screen button.
 
 Depending upon whether you clicked the All Users or Only These Users 
radio button, you may have to enter your name and password and then 
click the Connect button.
 
4. A window with the name of the remote Mac in its title bar appears. In 
it you see the screen of the Mac you’re looking to control remotely. 
 
 Go ahead and click something. Pull down a menu or open a folder. Isn’t 
that cool? You’re controlling a Mac in another room with your mouse 
and keyboard!

In This Chapter
▶ Talking to your Mac
▶ Listening to your Mac
▶ Enhancing productivity by using automation
▶ Trying out more useful technologies and techniques
▶ Running Microsoft Windows on your Mac (really!)
T
his chapter delves into some Mac OS X Snow Leopard features that might 
very well improve the ways you interact with your computer. Unlike the 
more mainstream applications and utilities I discuss in Chapter 3 — Desktop, 
Screen Saver, Appearance, Keyboard, Mouse, and such — the items in this 
chapter are a little more esoteric. In other words, you don’t have to use any 
of the technologies I’m about to show you. That said, many of these items 
can make you more productive and can make using your Mac even better. So 
I’d like to believe that at least some of you will want to use the cool features 
I’m about to introduce.
Talking and Listening to Your Mac
Your primary methods for interacting with your Mac are typing and reading 
text. But there’s another way you can commune with your faithful computer — 
voice.
Whether you know it or not, your Mac has a lot of speech savvy up its sleeve 
(er . . . up its processor?) and can talk to you as well as listen and obey. In the 
following sections, you discover how to make your Mac do both.

336
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Talking to your Mac
Speech Recognition enables your Mac to recognize and respond to human 
speech. The only thing you need to use it is a microphone, and all laptops 
and iMacs have a built-in mic these days.
Speech Recognition lets you issue verbal commands such as “Get my 
mail!” to your Mac and have it actually get your e-mail. You can also create 
AppleScripts and then trigger them by voice.
 
An AppleScript is a series of commands, using the AppleScript language, that 
tells the computer (and some applications) what to do. You find out more 
about AppleScript later in this chapter.
Setting up for Speech Recognition
To start using Speech Recognition, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open the Speech System Preferences pane.
 
 
2. Click the Speech Recognition tab and click the Settings sub-tab.
 
3. Click the On button for Speakable Items, as shown in Figure 16-1.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Turn Speech 
Recognition 
on and off in 
the Settings 
sub-tab on 
the Speech 
System 
Preferences 
pane’s 
Speech 
Recognition 
tab.
 
 
4. Choose the microphone you want to use from the Microphone pop-up 
menu.

337
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
 
 If you have a laptop or an iMac, you can get better results from just 
about any third-party microphone. The one that’s built into your Mac 
works, but it isn’t the greatest microphone on the planet.
 
5. To test that microphone, click the Calibrate button and follow the on-
screen instructions.
 
 There are two ways — called “listening methods” — you can use with 
Speech Recognition. The first listening method is to press a “Listening 
Key” — Esc by default — when you want to talk to your Mac. The second 
listening method is to have your Mac listen continuously for you to say 
a special keyword — “Computer,” by default — when you want to talk to 
your Mac.
 
6. (Optional) To change the Listening Key from Esc to a different key 
press the Change Key button and then press the key you want to use 
as your Listening Key.
 
7. (Optional) To change the Listening Method from Listening Key to 
Listening Continuously with Keyword, click the appropriate radio 
button. 
 
 If you select Listening Continuously, you have two more options:
 
a. To change the way your Mac listens for the keyword — Optional 
before commands, Required before each command, or Required 15 
or 30 seconds after last command — make your selection from the 
Keyword Is pop-up menu.
 
b. To change the keyword from Computer to something else, type the 
word you want to use into the Keyword field.
 
8. (Optional) You can have your commands acknowledged by your Mac, 
if you like, by selecting the Speak Command Acknowledgement 
check box. 
 
9. (Optional) You can choose a sound other than Whit from the Play This 
Sound pop-up menu.
 
10. Click the Commands sub-tab on the Speech System Preferences pane’s 
Speech Recognition tab. Select the check box for each command set 
you want to enable.
 
 I can’t see any reason not to enable them all unless you don’t use 
Apple’s Address Book, in which case you don’t need to enable it.
 
11. Click the Helpful Tips button and read the tips.
 
12. Click each command-set name, and if the Configure button is enabled, 
click it and follow the on-screen instructions.
 
13. If you create an AppleScript you want to be speakable, click the Open 
Speakable Items Folder.
 
 The Speakable Items folder is opened for you.

338
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
14. Place the script in the folder.
 
 When you speak its name, the script is executed.
 
 If the Speech System Preferences pane isn’t open and you want to open 
the Speakable Items folder, you can find it in your Home/Library/Speech 
folder.
 
15. Close the Speech System Preference pane when you’re done.
Using Speech Recognition
Here’s how Speech Recognition works. For the sake of this discussion, I use 
the “Press Esc” listening method.
When Speech Recognition is turned on, a round feedback window appears 
on-screen, as shown in Figure 16-2.
 
Figure 16-2: 
The round 
Speech 
Recognition 
feedback 
window.
 
I’m not pressing the Esc key in Figure 16-2, so the word Esc appears in the 
middle of the window to remind me which key to press before I speak a 
command.
Now, here’s how to actually use Speech Recognition:
 
1. To see what commands are available, click the little triangle at the 
bottom of the feedback window, and select Open Speech Commands 
Window, as shown in Figure 16-2.
 
 As you might expect, selecting Speech Preferences from this menu 
opens the Speech System Preferences pane for you.
 
 The Speech Commands window appears on-screen, as shown in 
Figure 16-3.
 
2. Peruse the Speech Commands window and find a command you’d like 
to execute by speaking its name.

339
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
 
Figure 16-3: 
The Speech 
Commands 
window.
 
 
3. Speak that command exactly as written.
 
 In this example, I press the Esc key and say to my Mac, “Tell me a joke.”
 
 At this point, several things happen:
 
• The microphone in the Feedback window changes to a speaker.
 
• The command and my Mac’s response appear in little boxes above 
and below the Feedback window.
 
• The Speech Commands window changes to reflect the command 
I’ve spoken.
 
 My Mac then says, “Knock, knock,” and the lower part of the Speech 
Commands window displays the commands I can speak in response.
 
 You can see all this in Figure 16-4. And that’s pretty much it for Speech 
Recognition.
 
Figure 16-4: 
Here’s what 
happened 
when I 
pressed Esc 
and said, 
“Tell me a 
joke.”
 

340
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
This technology is clever and kind of fun, but it can also be somewhat 
frustrating when it doesn’t recognize what you say. And it requires a decent 
microphone — although the mic built into most Macs sometimes works okay. 
The bottom line is that I’ve never been able to get Speech Recognition to work 
well enough to continue using it beyond a few hours at best. Still, it’s kind of 
cool (and it’s a freebie), and I’ve heard more than one user profess love for it. 
Which is why it’s included here.
Listening to your Mac read for you
The camera pans back — a voice tells you what you’ve just seen, and sud-
denly it all makes sense. Return with me now to those thrilling days of the off-
camera narrator. . . . Wouldn’t it be nice if your Mac had a narrator to provide 
a blow-by-blow account of what’s happening on your screen?
Or . . .
Your eyes are tired from a long day staring at the monitor, but you still have 
a lengthy document to read. Wouldn’t it be sweet if you could sit back, close 
your eyes, and let your Mac read the document to you in a (somewhat) 
natural voice? The good news is that both are possible with Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard — the former with VoiceOver and the latter with Text to Speech.
VoiceOver
Snow Leopard’s VoiceOver technology is designed primarily for the visually 
impaired, but you might find it useful even if your vision is 20/20. VoiceOver 
not only reads what’s on the screen to you, but also integrates with your key-
board so you can navigate around the screen until you hear the item you’re 
looking for. When you’re there, you can use Keyboard Access to select list 
items, select check boxes and radio buttons, move scroll bars and sliders, 
resize windows, and so on — with a simple keypress or two.
 
 To check it out, launch the System Preferences application (from the 
Applications folder, Ú menu, or Dock), click the Universal Access icon, and 
then click the Seeing tab or press Ô+F5 (Ô+Fn+F5 on notebook/laptop 
models and some newer Apple keyboards).
After VoiceOver is enabled, you can turn it on and off in the Seeing tab of the 
Universal Access System Preferences pane or by pressing Ô+F5 or (Ô+Fn+F5 
on notebook/laptop models). 
While it’s on, your Mac talks to you about what is on your screen. For exam-
ple, if you clicked the Desktop, your Mac might say something along the lines 
of, “Application, Finder; Column View; selected folder, Desktop, contains 8 

341
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
items.” It’s quite slick. Here’s another example: When you click a menu or 
item on a menu, you hear its name spoken at once, and when you close a 
menu, you hear the words “Closing menu.” You even hear the spoken feed-
back in the Print, Open, and Save (and other) dialogs.
 
VoiceOver is kind of cool (talking alerts are fun), but having dialogs actually 
produce spoken text becomes annoying really fast for most folks. Still, I urge 
you to check it out. You might like it and find times when you want your Mac 
to narrate the action for you.
The VoiceOver Utility
The VoiceOver Utility lets you specify almost every possible option the 
VoiceOver technology uses. You can adjust its verbosity; specify how it deals 
with your mouse and keyboard; change its voice, rate, pitch, and/or volume; 
and more.
 
 You can open the VoiceOver Utility by clicking the Open VoiceOver Utility 
button on the Seeing tab of the Universal Access System Preferences pane or 
the usual way, by double-clicking its icon (which you find in your Applications/
Utilities folder).
Of course, you might get the machines-are-taking-over willies when your Mac 
starts to talk to you or make sounds — but if you give it a try, it could change 
your mind.
 
I wish I had the space to explain further, but I don’t. That’s the bad news. The 
good news is that VoiceOver Help is extensive and clear, and it helps you har-
ness all the power of VoiceOver and the VoiceOver Utility.
Text to Speech
The second way your Mac can speak to you is using Text to Speech, which 
converts on-screen text to spoken words. If you’ve used Text to Speech in 
earlier versions of Mac OS X, you’ll find that it’s pretty much unchanged.
Why might you need Text to Speech? Because sometimes hearing is better 
than reading. For example, I sometimes use Text to Speech to read a column 
or page to me before I submit it. If something doesn’t sound quite right, I give 
it another polish before sending it off to my editor.
You can configure this feature in the Speech System Preferences pane:
 
1. Open the Speech System Preferences (from the Applications folder or 
Ú menu) and click the Text to Speech tab.
 
2. Choose from the list of voices in the System Voice pop-up menu to set 
the voice your Mac uses when it reads to you.

342
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
 
3. Click the Play button to hear a sample of the voice you selected.
 
4. Use the Speaking Rate slider to speed up or slow down the voice. Click 
the Play button to hear the voice at its new speed.
 
 I really like Alex, who says, “Most people recognize me by my voice.” 
My second favorite is Fred, who says, “I sure like being inside this fancy 
computer.”
 
5. Select the Announce When Alerts Are Displayed check box if you 
want to make your Mac speak the text in alert boxes and dialogs.
 
 You might hear such alerts as “The application Microsoft Word has quit 
unexpectedly” or “Paper out or not loaded correctly.”
 
6. Click the Set Alert Options button to choose a different voice 
to announce your alerts; the phrase your Mac speaks (“Alert,” 
“Attention,” “Excuse me,” and the like) when alerting you.
 
 You can also set the delay between the time the alert appears and when 
it’s spoken to you.
 
7. (Optional) If you like, select either of these two check boxes: 
Announce When an Application Requires Your Attention or Speak 
Selected Text When the Key Is Pressed.
 
 They both do what they say they’ll do. In the case of the latter, you 
assign the key you want to press by clicking the Set Key button.
 
8. (Optional) If you want to have the clock announce the time, click the 
Open Date & Time Preferences button, and you’re whisked to that 
System Preferences pane. Then click the Clock tab and select the 
Announce the Time check box.
 
 That’s it for your preferences.
Now, to use Text to Speech to read text to you, copy the text to the Clipboard, 
launch TextEdit, paste the text into the empty untitled document, click where 
you want your Mac to begin reading to you, and then choose Edit➪Speech➪
Start Speaking. To make it stop, choose Edit➪Speech➪Stop Speaking.
Automatic Automation
Mac OS X Snow Leopard offers a pair of technologies — AppleScript and 
Automator — that make it possible to automate repetitive actions on 
your Mac.

343
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
AppleScript is “programming for the rest of us.” It can record and play back 
things that you do (if the application was written to allow the recording — 
Finder, for example, was), such as opening an application or clicking a 
button. You can use it to record a script for tasks that you often perform and 
then have your Mac perform those tasks for you later. You can write your 
own AppleScripts, use those that come with your Mac, or download still 
others from the Web.
Automator is “programming without writing code.” With Automator, you 
string together prefabricated activities (known as actions) to automate repeti-
tive or scheduled tasks. How cool is that?
Automation isn’t for everyone. Some users can’t live without it; others could 
go their whole lives without ever automating anything. So the following sec-
tions are designed to help you figure out how much — or how little — you 
care about AppleScript and Automator.
AppleScript
Describing AppleScript to a Mac beginner is a bit like three blind men 
describing an elephant. One man might describe it as the Macintosh’s built-
in automation tool. Another might describe it as an interesting but often-
overlooked piece of enabling technology. The third might liken it to a cassette 
recorder, recording and playing back your actions at the keyboard. A fourth 
(if there were a fourth in the story) would assure you that it looked like com-
puter code written in a high-level language.
They would all be correct. AppleScript, a built-in Mac automation tool, is a 
little-known (at least until recently) enabling technology that works like a cas-
sette recorder for programs that support AppleScript recording. And scripts 
do look like computer programs. (Could that be because they are computer 
programs? Hmm . . .).
If you’re the kind of person who likes to automate as many things as pos-
sible, you might just love AppleScript because it’s a simple programming 
language you can use to create programs that give instructions to your Mac 
and the applications running on your Mac. For example, you can create an 
AppleScript that launches Mail, checks for new messages, and then quits 
Mail. The script could even transfer your mail to a folder of your choice. 
Of course, Tiger also introduced Automator, which includes a whole lot of 
preprogrammed actions that makes a task like the one just described even 
easier.

344
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
I call AppleScript a time-and-effort enhancer. If you just spend the time and 
effort it takes to understand it, using AppleScript can save you oodles of time 
and effort down the road.
Therein lies the rub. This stuff is far from simple — entire books have been 
written on the subject. So it’s far beyond the purview of Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard For Dummies. Still, it’s worth finding out about if you’d like to script 
repetitive actions for future use. To get you started, here are a few quick tips:
 
✓ You can put frequently used AppleScripts in the Dock or on your 
Desktop for easy access.
 
✓ Apple provides a script menu extra that you can install on your 
menu bar by double-clicking the AppleScript Utility — along with a 
number of free scripts to automate common tasks, many of which are 
in the Example Scripts folder. (An alias to that folder is present in the 
AppleScript folder.) Furthermore, you can always download additional 
scripts from www.apple.com/applescript.
 
✓ Many AppleScripts are designed for use in the toolbar of Finder win-
dows, where you can drag and drop items onto them quickly and easily.
 
✓ Other scripts can enhance your use of iTunes, iPhoto, and iDVD.
 
 
✓ AppleScript Editor (in the Utilities folder inside the Applications 
folder) is the application you use to view and edit AppleScripts. 
Although more information on AppleScript Editor is beyond the scope of 
this book, it’s a lot of fun. And the cool thing is that you can create many 
AppleScripts without knowing a thing about programming. Just record a 
series of actions you want to repeat and use AppleScript Editor to save 
them as a script. If you save your script as an application (by choosing 
Application from the Format menu in the Save sheet), you can run that 
script by just double-clicking its icon.
 
✓ If the concept of scripting intrigues you, I suggest that you open the 
Scripts (in the root level Library) folder. Rummage through this folder 
to check out the scripts available at www.macosxautomation.com/
applescript/. When you find a script that looks interesting, double-
click it to launch the AppleScript Editor program, where you can exam-
ine it more closely.
Automator
Automator does just what you’d expect: It enables you to automate many 
common tasks on your Mac. If it sounds a little like AppleScript to you (which 

345
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
I discuss in the preceding section), you’re not mistaken — the two share a 
common heritage. But this relatively new tool (introduced in Mac OS X Tiger) 
is a lot simpler to use, albeit somewhat less flexible, than AppleScript.
For example, in AppleScript, you can have conditionals (“if this is true, do that; 
otherwise do something else”), but Automator is purely sequential (“take this, 
do that, then do the next thing, and then . . .”).
The big difference is that conditionals allow AppleScripts to take actions 
involving decision-making and iteration (“while this is true, do these things”); 
Automator workflows can’t make decisions or iterate.
The upsides to Automator are that you don’t have to know anything about 
programming, and you don’t have to type any archaic code. Instead, if you 
understand the process you want to automate, you can just drag and drop 
Automator’s prefab Actions into place and build a workflow (Automator’s 
name for a series of Actions).
 
You do need to know one thing about programming (or computers), though: 
Computers are stupid! You heard me right — even your top-of-the-line dual 
processor MacBook Pro is dumb as a post. Computers do only what you tell 
them to do, though they can do it faster and more precisely than you can. But 
all computers run on the GIGO principle — garbage in/garbage out — so if 
your instructions are flawed, you’re almost certain to get flawed results.
Another similarity between Automator and AppleScript is that it’s up to the 
developers of the applications you want to automate to provide you the 
Actions or with scripting support. Not all developers do so. For example, in 
Apple’s wonderful iLife suite of multimedia applications, iTunes, iPhoto, and 
iDVD are all AppleScript-able — and they’ve supplied Actions for Automator 
users. Neither iMovie nor versions of GarageBand prior to GarageBand ’09 
support AppleScript. Furthermore, iMovie, GarageBand, and iWeb don’t 
include any Automator actions at this time.
 
 When you launch the Automator application, you see the window in Figure 
16-5. Choose one of the starting points if you want Automator to assist you in 
constructing a new workflow or choose Workflow to start building a workflow 
from scratch. 
I choose Workflow for the sake of this demonstration. When I do, I see the 
window shown in Figure 16-6.

The Library window on the left contains all the applications Automator

When you select an action, the pane at the bottom of the Library window 
(Text to Audio File in Figure 16-6) explains what that Action does, what input 
it expects, and what result it produces. Just drag Actions from the Action list 
into the window on the right to build your workflow.

 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
This particular workflow, which took me around ten minutes of trial and error 
to get working, is quite useful. It takes text from a Web page and uses Mac OS 
X Text to Speech to convert the text to an audio file, which I can then listen to 
in iTunes or on my iPod in the car or on a plane. Sweet!
Automator is a very useful addition to Mac OS X; it’s deep, powerful, and 
expandable, yet relatively easy to use and master. Do yourself a favor and 
spend some time experimenting with ways Automator can save you time and 
keystrokes. You won’t regret it.
A Few More Useful Goodies
Even more neat and useful technologies are built into Snow Leopard, but I’m 
running out of space. So here are, at least in my humble opinion, the best of 
the rest.
Universal Access
 
 Universal Access is mostly designed for users with disabilities or who have 
difficulty handling the keyboard or mouse. The Universal Access System 
Preferences pane has a check box and four tabs.
Select the Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box at the bottom of the 
window to use special equipment to control your computer.
The Seeing tab
On the Seeing tab, you can turn on a terrific feature called hardware zoom, 
which lets you make things on your screen bigger by zooming in on them. 
Toggle it on and off with the shortcut Ô+Option+8. Zoom in and out using 
the shortcuts Ô+Option+= (the equals key) and Ô+Option+– (the minus key), 
respectively. Try this feature even if you’re not disabled or challenged in any 
way; it’s actually a great feature for everyone.
You can also display the screen as white on black (like a photographic nega-
tive), as shown in Figure 16-7. The shortcut is Ô+Option+Control+8; use the 
same keyboard shortcut to toggle back to normal. If you’re in the normal 
black-on-white mode, you can desaturate your screen into a grayscale display 
(so it works like a black-and-white TV).

what you 
see on-

Finally, the Options button lets you specify minimum and maximum zoom 
levels, display a preview rectangle when zoomed out, and toggle image 
smoothing on or off.
The Hearing tab
The Hearing tab lets you choose to flash the screen whenever an alert sound 
occurs.
 
This feature, created for those with impaired hearing, is quite useful if you 
have a MacBook Pro or MacBook and want to use it where ambient noise 
levels are high.
The Keyboard tab
The Keyboard tab offers two types of assistance:
 
✓ The Sticky Keys application treats a sequence of modifier keys as a key 
combination. In other words, you don’t have to simultaneously hold 
down Ô while pressing another key. For example, with Sticky Keys 
enabled, you can do a standard keyboard shortcut by pressing Ô, releas-
ing it, and then pressing the other key. You can select check boxes to tell 
you (with a beep and/or an on-screen display) what modifier keys have 
been pressed.

349
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
 
 As useful as Sticky Keys can be, they’re really awkward in applications 
like Adobe Photoshop that toggle a tool’s state when you press a modi-
fier key. So if you’re a big Photoshop user, you probably don’t want 
Sticky Keys enabled.
 
✓ Slow Keys lets you adjust the delay between when a key is pressed and 
when that keypress is accepted.
The Mouse & Trackpad tab
The Mouse & Trackpad tab offers options for those who have difficulties 
using a mouse or trackpad by using keys on the keyboard to navigate rather 
than a mouse or trackpad. 
The specific keys for turning Mouse Keys on or off, move the cursor 
on screen, and click, drag, and release the mouse button are shown in 
Figure 16-8.

The key-
board 
commands

Keys.
 
Notice that you have to press Fn+ the letter or number in parentheses on a 
laptop and other keyboards that don’t have a numeric keypad. 
You can also increase the cursor size from the normal setting (16x16) to 
about 64x64.

Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
Energy Saver
 
 All Macs are Energy Star–compliant (and have been for years), allowing you 
to preset your machine to turn itself off at a specific time or after a specified 
idle period. To manage your Mac’s energy saving features, open the Energy 
Saver System Preferences pane by choosing Ú➪System Preferences and then 
clicking the Energy Saver icon. 
If you have a notebook computer, you have two mostly identical tabs — 
Battery and Power Adapter — in your Energy Saver System Preferences pane. 
The battery tab controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro’s behavior when it’s 
running on battery power (not plugged in); the Power Adapter tab controls 
its behavior when it is plugged in. 
If you have a desktop Mac you won’t have tabs but you do have most of the 
same controls including a pair of sliders that control sleep times for your 
computer and display. To enable Computer or Display sleep, move the appro-
priate slider to the desired amount of time. You can choose any number 
between 1 minute and 3 hours, or turn off either type of sleep entirely by 
moving its slider all the way to the right, to Never.
 
Setting the display to sleep is handy if you want your Mac to keep doing what 
it’s doing but you don’t need to use the monitor. And if you’re a notebook user, 
display sleep will save you some battery power.
To wake up your Mac from its sleep, merely move your mouse or press 
any key.
Below the Sleep sliders are some check boxes for other useful energy settings 
such as:
 
✓ Wake for Network Access: Enable this option if you want your Mac 
to wake up automatically for Ethernet network administrative access 
(handy in a corporate setting where an IT person maintains system 
configurations).
 
✓ Start Automatically After a Power Failure: Enabling this option tells 
your Mac you want it to restart automatically if the power goes out.
 
✓ Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible: Enabling this option 
forces your hard drive to sleep after a few minutes of inactivity. It’s not 
a particularly useful feature on a desktop Mac but if you have a laptop, 
letting your hard drive sleep when it’s idle will save you some battery 
power.

351
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
 
✓ Allow Power Button to Put the Computer to Sleep: Does just what it 
says: Enable it and tapping your Mac’s power (on/off) button puts your 
computer to sleep immediately.
 
 To turn your Mac off, use the Ú menu’s Shut Down command or its key-
board shortcut (Control+Power Key).
 
✓ Automatically Reduce Brightness Before Display Goes to Sleep: 
Another one that does what it says.
If you have a laptop you’ll have some additional options including: 
 
✓ Slightly Dim the Display when Using This Power Source (Battery tab 
only): Enable this and the display dims slightly and uses slightly less 
power when you’re running off the battery. 
 
 
✓ Show Battery Status in the Menu Bar: This option displays a little 
battery-status indicator in your menu bar as shown in the margin.
Finally, to start up, shut down, or put your Mac to sleep at a predetermined 
time, click the Schedule button and then select the appropriate check box 
and choose the appropriate options from the pop-up menus.
Bluetooth
 
 Bluetooth is wireless networking for low-bandwidth peripherals, including 
mice, keyboards, and mobile phones. If your Mac has Bluetooth built in or is 
equipped with a USB Bluetooth adapter, you can synchronize wirelessly with 
phones and Palm devices, print wirelessly to Bluetooth printers, and use 
Bluetooth mice and keyboards.
To manage your Mac’s Bluetooth features, open the Bluetooth System 
Preference pane by choosing Ú➪System Preferences and then clicking the 
Bluetooth icon. 
Bluetooth is designed to work with iSync — Apple’s synchronization 
technology — to let you synchronize your Address Book, calendar, and 
bookmarks wirelessly with Bluetooth phones.
Ink
 
 Ink is the Mac OS X built-in handwriting-recognition engine. If you have a 
stylus and tablet connected to your Mac, just turn it on in this pane, and you 
can write anywhere you can type with the keyboard.

352
Part IV: Making This Snow Leopard Your Very Own 
To manage your Mac’s Ink features, open the Ink System Preference pane by 
choosing Ú➪System Preferences and then clicking the Ink icon. 
The Ink pane is another one you see only if you have one of the pen-input tab-
lets that Ink supports connected to your Mac.
 
Most of the currently supported tablets come from Wacom (www.wacom.
com), with prices starting under $100 for a small, wireless stylus and tablet.
Automatic Login (Accounts System 
Preferences pane)
Some users don’t care for the fact that Mac OS X Snow Leopard is a multiuser 
operating system — and dislike having to log in when they start up their Mac. 
For those users, here’s a way to disable the login screen:
 
 
1. Open the Accounts System Preferences pane, select yourself from the 
list of users, and click the Login Options button below the list.
 
2. Choose the account you want to be logged in automatically from the 
Automatic Login pop-up menu.
 
 To disable the logging-in requirement, you have to be an administrator, 
and you might need to unlock the Accounts System Preferences.
 
When you disable logging in, you also affect all the preferences set by anyone 
else who uses your Mac unless they log out of your account and log into 
theirs. (Yikes.) So if your Desktop pattern, keyboard settings, and so forth are 
different from those of someone else who uses your machine, those prefer-
ences won’t be properly reflected unless each of you has a separate, individ-
ual login account. Even if you’re not worried about security, consider keeping 
logging in enabled if any other users have accounts on your machine or you 
don’t want just anyone to be able to turn on your Mac and see your personal 
stuff.
Note that only one account is allowed to use autologin. If another user wants 
to use this Mac, you need to choose Ú➪Log Out, press Ô+Shift+Q, or have 
Fast User Switching enabled. And if you’ve disabled automatic login in the 
Security System Preferences pane, you can’t enable it here.
Boot Camp
Boot Camp is Snow Leopard’s built-in technology that allows you to run 
Microsoft Windows XP or Vista on any Intel-based Mac. If your Mac meets the 
following requirements, you can run Windows on your Mac (if you so desire):

353
 Chapter 16: Features for the Way You Work
 
✓ An Intel-based Mac (of course)
 
✓ At least 10GB of free hard drive space
 
✓ A hard drive that isn’t partitioned
 
✓ A blank recordable CD
 
✓ A printer (for printing the instructions, which you’ll want to do)
 
✓ A full install copy of Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Vista
 
You really do need a full retail copy of Windows, one that was purchased in a 
retail box. If your copy of Windows came with your Dell or HP, you probably 
won’t be able to install it under Boot Camp.
To install Windows on your Mac, here are the basic steps you need to follow:
 
 
1. Launch the Boot Camp Assistant application, which is in your 
Applications/Utilities folder.
 
 This step creates a partition on your hard drive for Windows and then 
burns a special CD with all the drivers you’ll need to use Windows on 
your Mac.
 
2. Install Windows on the new partition.
 
3. Install the drivers from the CD you just burned.
 
 From now on, you can hold down Option during startup and choose to 
start up from either the Mac OS X Snow Leopard disk partition or the 
Windows partition.
 
 It’s that simple. However, if these installation steps seem beyond your 
comfort level, just ask your favorite Mac geek for help.
 
If running Windows on your Mac appeals to you, you might want to check out 
Parallels Desktop, an $80 program that not only allows you to run Windows 
on your Mac, but also lets you do so without partitioning your hard drive or 
restarting every time you want to use Windows. In fact, you can run Mac and 
Windows programs simultaneously with Parallels Desktop. For more informa-
tion, visit www.parallels.com.

Your Snow Leopard

ere I get into the nitty-gritty underbelly of handling 
trouble in Mac OS X. In this part, I cover topics like 
protecting your valuable data by backing it up, and I discuss 
everything you need to know about Macintosh security 
(which, thankfully, isn’t much). Next you look at some util-
ities that might or might not be useful but that you should 
know about anyway. Finally, you find out what to do when 
things go wonky (which also, thankfully, doesn’t happen 
very much) and experience a quick run-through of Dr. 
Mac’s (okay, Dr. Bob’s) top troubleshooting tips for those 
infrequent times when a good Snow Leopard goes bad.
This material is a little geekier than the first four parts, 
but it could very well be the most important information 
in the book. Don’t miss out!

Chapter 17
Safety First: Backups and 
Other Security Issues
In This Chapter
▶ Backing up . . . it’s easy
▶ Discovering why you should back up
▶ Finding out what happens to you if you don’t back up
▶ Keeping your Mac safe from rogue viruses and malicious attacks
▶ Protecting your data from prying eyes
A
lthough Macs are generally reliable beasts (especially Macs running 
Mac OS X), someday your hard drive will die. I promise. They all do. 
And if you don’t back up your hard drive (or at least back up any files that 
you can’t afford to lose) before that day comes, chances are good that you’ll 
never see your files again. And if you do see them again, it will be only after 
paying someone like my friend Scott Gaidano, the founder of DriveSavers 
Data Recovery Service. And even if you pay, there’s no guarantee of success.
 
DriveSavers is the premier recoverer of lost data on hard drives. The people 
there understand Mac hard drives quite well, do excellent work, and can often 
recover stuff that nobody else could. (Ask the producers of The Simpsons 
about the almost-lost episodes.) Understandably, DriveSavers charges accord-
ingly. Here are some phone numbers for DriveSavers: 800-440-1904 toll free and 
415-382-2000.
Now pray that you never need those numbers — and if you back up often, 
you won’t. But if, somehow, none of this sinks in, tell Scott that I said, “Hi,” 
and ask how his Ferrari is running. 
 
In other words, you absolutely, positively, without question must back up your 
files if you don’t want to risk losing them. Just as you adopt the Shut Down 
command and make it a habit before turning off your machine, you must 
remember to back up important files on your hard drive to another disk or 
device — and back them up often.

358
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
How often is often? That depends on you. How much work can you afford to 
lose? If your answer is that losing everything you did yesterday would put 
you out of business, then you need to back up daily or possibly twice a day. 
If you would lose only a few unimportant documents, you can back up less 
frequently.
Following the comprehensive coverage of backup options, I look at the pos-
sible threat to your data from viruses and other icky things, as well as how 
you can protect against them.
Finally, I look at what you can do to keep other people from looking at your 
stuff.
Backing Up Is (Not) Hard to Do
You can back up your hard drive in basically three ways: the super-painless 
way with Snow Leopard’s excellent Time Machine, the ugly way using the 
brute-force method, or the comprehensive way with specialized third-party 
backup software. Read on and find out more about all three. . . .
Backing up with Snow Leopard’s 
excellent Time Machine
Time Machine is a most excellent backup system that was introduced with 
Mac OS X Leopard — and it’s only gotten better. I say it’s a system because it 
consists of two parts — the Time Machine System Preferences pane, shown 
in Figure 17-1, and the Time Machine application, shown in Figure 17-2.
 
Figure 17-1: 
The Time 
Machine 
System 
Preference 
pane.
 

359
 Chapter 17: Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues
 
Figure 17-2: 
The Time 
Machine 
application 
is ready to 
restore a file 
in the Finder.
 
To use Time Machine to back up your data automatically, the first thing you 
need is another hard drive that’s the same size or larger than your startup 
disk. It can be a FireWire hard drive, USB 2 hard drive, or even another inter-
nal hard drive if your Mac is a Mac Pro. Another option is an Apple Time 
Capsule, a device that combines an AirPort Extreme base station with a large 
hard drive so you can automatically back up one or more Macs over Wi-Fi. 
The first time a new disk suitable for use with Time Machine is connected 
to your Mac, a dialog asks if you want to use that disk to back up with Time 
Machine. If you say yes, the Time Machine System Preferences pane opens 
automatically, showing the new disk already chosen as the backup disk.
 
 If that doesn’t happen or you want to use an already-connected hard drive 
with Time Machine, open the Time Machine System Preferences pane and 
click the big On/Off switch to On. Now click the Select Disk button and select 
the hard drive you want to use for your backups. Mine is called enihcaMemiT 
(that’s Time Machine spelled backwards) in Figure 17-1.
The only other consideration is this: If you have other hard disks connected 
to your Mac, you should click the Options button to reveal the Do Not Back 
Up list, which tells Time Machine which volumes (disks) not to back up. To 
add a volume to this list, click the little + button; to remove a volume from 
the list, select the volume and then click the – button.

360
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
The Options sheet also has a check box for warning you when old backups 
are deleted; check it if you want to be warned. And, if your Mac is a laptop, a 
second check box governs whether or not Time Machine backs up your Mac 
when it’s on battery power. 
For the record, Time Machine stores your backups for the following lengths 
of time:
 
✓ Hourly backups for the past 24 hours.
 
✓ Daily backups for the past month.
 
✓ Weekly backups until your backup disk is full. 
When your backup disk gets full, the oldest backups on it are deleted and 
replaced by the newest. 
When does it run? Glad you asked — it runs approximately once per hour. 
 
If you enable and set up Time Machine as I’ve just described you’ll never 
forget to back up your stuff, so just do it.
What does Time Machine back up?
Time Machine backs up your whole hard disk the first time it runs, and then 
backs up files and folders that have been modified since your last backup. 
That’s what backup systems do. But Time Machine does more — it also backs 
up things like individual contacts in your Address Book, individual pictures 
in your iPhoto Library, and individual events in your iCal calendars. That 
feature — a sweet one indeed — makes it unlike other backup systems.
How do I restore a file (or a contact, a photo, an event, and so on)?
To restore a file or any other information, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the appropriate program — the one that contains the informa-
tion you want to restore.
 
 If what you want to restore happens to be a file, that program is the 
Finder, which, as you know, is always running. So to restore an individual 
file, you don’t actually need to launch anything. But to restore a contact, 
a photo, or an event, for example, you need to launch Address Book, 
iPhoto, or iCal, respectively.
 
2. With the appropriate application running (or the appropriate Finder 
window open), launch the Time Machine application, as shown in 
Figure 17-2.

361
 Chapter 17: Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues
 
 It will be easier to restore a file in the Finder if the folder the file is in 
(or was in) is the active folder (that is, open and frontmost) when you 
launch the Time Machine application. If not, you have to navigate to the 
appropriate folder before you can perform Step 3.
 
3. Click one of the bars in the lower-right corner of the screen or click 
the big “forward” and “back” arrows next to them to choose the 
backup you want to restore from (as with Wednesday, March 11, 2009 
in Figure 17-2).
 
4. Select the file, folder, Address Book contact, iPhoto photo, or iCal 
event you wish to restore. 
 
5. Click the big Restore button below the big “forward” and “back” 
arrows.
If the file, folder, Address Book contact, iPhoto photo, or iCal event exists in 
the same location today, Time Machine politely inquires as to your wishes as 
shown in Figure 17-3.
 
Figure 17-3: 
Time 
Machine 
politely asks 
what you 
want it to 
do with the 
file you’re 
restoring.
 
Backing up by using the manual, 
brute-force method
If you’re too cheap to buy a second hard drive, the most rudimentary way to 
back up is to do it manually. You would accomplish this by dragging said files 
a few at a time to another volume — a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW. (If 
you use an optical disc, don’t forget to actually burn the disc; merely dragging 
those files onto the optical-disc icon won’t do the trick.)
By doing this, you’re making a copy of each file that you want to protect. (See 
Chapter 7 for more info on removable storage.)

362
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
 
Yuck! If doing a manual backup sounds pretty awful, trust me — it is. This 
method can take a long, long time; you can’t really tell whether you’ve copied 
every file that needs to be backed up; and you can’t really copy only the files 
that have been modified since your last backup. Almost nobody in his right 
mind sticks with this method for long.
 
Of course, if you’re careful to save files only in your Documents folder, as I 
suggest several times in this book, you can probably get away with backing up 
only that. Or if you save files in other folders within your Home folder or have 
any files in your Movies, Music, Pictures, or Sites folders (which often contain 
files you didn’t specifically save in those folders, like your iPhoto photos and 
iTunes songs), you should probably consider backing up your entire Home 
folder.
As you read in the following section, that’s even easier if you use special 
backup software.
Backing up by using commercial 
backup software
Another way to back up your files is with a third-party backup program. 
Backup software automates the task of backing up, remembering what’s on 
each backup disc (if your backup uses more than one disc) and backing up 
only files that have been modified since your last backup.
Furthermore, you can instruct your backup software to back up only a cer-
tain folder (Home or Documents) and to ignore the hundreds of megabytes 
of stuff that make up Mac OS X, all of which you can easily reinstall from the 
Mac OS X Install DVD.
Your first backup with commercial software might take anywhere from a few 
minutes to several hours and use one or more optical discs — CD-R, CD-RW, 
DVD-R, DVD-RW, magneto-optical disc — or non-optical media, such as 
another hard drive or any kind of tape backup. Subsequent backups, called 
incremental backups in backup-software parlance, should take only a few 
minutes.
 
If you do incremental backups, be sure to label all the discs you use during 
that operation — if you use multiple discs, number them. Your backup soft-
ware may prompt you with a message such as Please insert backup 
disk 7. If you haven’t labeled your media clearly, you could have a problem 
figuring out which disc is disc 7 or which disc 7 belongs to that particular 
backup set.

363
 Chapter 17: Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues
Fortunately, plenty of very good backup programs are available for well 
under $150, including the excellent Retrospect family of backup solutions 
from EMC/Dantz Development (www.emcinsignia.com).
Retrospect Desktop protects up to two networked desktops or notebooks 
for around $129. If you need to protect more than two computers, additional 
client licenses are available at reasonable prices.
 
Here’s a nice touch: The Retrospect network client runs on Windows Vista, 
Windows XP, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, 
Windows 95/98/Me, Red Hat Linux (versions 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8), and, 
of course, Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X. So if you have any non-Mac computers, 
chances are good that Retrospect can back them up over your local area net-
work at no additional expense.
Other backup offerings include SilverKeeper (free) from LaCie (www.lacie.
com); Data Backup 2 (around $60) from Prosoft Engineering (www.prosoft
eng.com); and so-called synchronizer programs such as ChronoSync ($20) 
from Econ Technologies (www.econtechnologies.com) and SuperDuper 
($28) from ShirtPocket Software (www.shirt-pocket.com).
 
If you want the most flexible, top-of-the-line backup software, spend a little 
more and pop for Retrospect. It can do everything the others can do — and 
more. It’s the only backup software you’ll ever need.
One of the best things about good backup software is that you can set it up 
to automate your backups and perform them even if you forget. And although 
Time Machine is a step in the right direction and might be sufficient for your 
needs, it’s not good enough for me. I use a total of seven hard drives for back-
ups; Retrospect backs up all the important work-related files on my boot disk 
four times a day, each time to a different backup set and hard drive. At night, 
my entire boot drive is duplicated to another hard drive, giving me a boot-
able backup I can use in emergencies. My media folders (Movies, Music, and 
Pictures) are backed up nightly to two other hard drives. And there’s always 
a complete backup of everything in my safe deposit box at the bank. (Where 
my data is concerned, I sleep pretty well, thanks.)
Why You Need Two Sets of Backups
You’re a good soldier. You back up regularly. You think you’re immune to file 
loss or damage.

364
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
Now picture yourself in the following scenario:
 
1. You leave the office one day for lunch.
 
2. When you return, you discover that your office has been burglarized, 
struck by lightning, flooded, burned to the ground, or buried in earth-
quake rubble — take your pick. 
 
3. Alas, while you did have a backup, the disk it was on was in the same 
room as your Mac. Which means it was either stolen or destroyed along 
with your Mac.
This scenario is totally unlikely — but it could happen, and it does demon-
strate why you need multiple backups. If you have several sets of backup 
disks, and don’t keep them all in the same room as your Mac, chances are 
pretty good that one of the sets will work even if the others are lost, stolen, 
or destroyed.
 
I always keep at least three current sets of backup disks. I update two of them 
every day and store the third somewhere other than my office (such as a 
neighbor’s house or a safe deposit box). This scheme ensures that no matter 
what happens — even if my office burns, floods, is destroyed by tornado, 
hurricane, or an earthquake, or robbed — I won’t lose more than a few days’ 
worth of work. I can live with that.
Non-Backup Security Concerns
As you’ve probably surmised by now, backing up your files is critical unless 
you won’t mind losing all your data someday. And although backing up is by 
far your most important security concern, several other things could imperil 
your data — things like viruses, worms, malware, spyware, and intruder 
attacks. That’s the bad news. The good news is that all those things are far 
more likely to affect Windows users than Mac users. In fact, I’d venture to say 
that viruses, worms, malware, spyware, and intruder attacks are rarer than 
hens’ teeth for Mac users.
That said, here are a few precautions Mac users should consider, just in case.
All about viruses
A computer virus, in case you missed it in Time or Newsweek, is a nasty little 
piece of computer code that replicates and spreads from disk to disk. Most

viruses cause your Mac to misbehave; some viruses can destroy files or erase 
disks with no warning.
The good news is that most virus scares that you hear and read about won’t 
affect you (O, lucky Mac user!) because they are specific to users of Windows 
systems. Most viruses are specific to an operating system — Mac viruses 
won’t affect Windows users, Windows viruses won’t affect Mac users, and 
so forth. The one real exception here is a “gift” from the wonderful world 
of Microsoft Office (Word and Excel, for example) users: the dreaded macro 
viruses that are spread with Word and Excel documents containing macros 
written in Microsoft’s VBA (Visual BASIC for Applications) language. But 
you’re safe even from those if you practice safe computing as I describe.
As it happens, so far almost all the viral activity affecting Mac OS X involved 
various Windows macro viruses. In fact, at the time of this writing, I know of 
no OS X–specific viruses, nor of any that attack Mac OS X exclusively — and 
(at least so far) none that cause damage. Still, the advice in this chapter is 
sound — one never knows when the little boys out there will decide to attack 
the Mac. OS X viruses aren’t impossible or nonexistent; they just don’t exist 
in known examples at this moment in time. But they could someday; better 
safe than sorry.
 
If you use disks that have been inserted into other computers, you need some 
form of virus-detection software. If you download and use files from Web and 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the Internet, you need some form of virus 
detection as well.
You don’t have too much to worry about if
 
✓ You download files only from commercial online services, such as AOL, 
VersionTracker, or MacUpdate, which are all very conscientious about 
viral infections.
 
✓ You use only commercial software and never download files from Web 
sites with strange names.
You should definitely worry about virus infection if
 
✓ An unsavory friend told you about a Web site called Dan’sDenOf
PiratedIllegalStolenBootlegSoftware.com — and you actually 
visited it.
 
✓ You swap disks with friends regularly.
 
✓ You shuttle disks back and forth to other Macs.
 
✓ You use your disks at service bureaus or copy shops.

366
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
 
✓ You download files from various and sundry places on the Internet, even 
ones that don’t sound as slimy as Dan’sDenOfPiratedIllegalStolen
BootlegSoftware.com.
 
✓ You receive e-mail with attachments (and open them).
If you’re at risk, do yourself a favor and buy a commercial antivirus program. 
Although you can choose among many shareware and freeware antivirus 
solutions, the one I use is Virus Barrier from Intego (around $70; www.intego.
com). I’ve used it for years and have never been infected with a virus. The 
big advantage of buying a commercial antivirus program is that the publisher 
contacts you each time a new virus is discovered and provides you a soft-
ware update to protect you against the new strain.
Firewall: Yea or nay?
According to the Mac OS X built-in Oxford American Dictionary, a firewall is
Part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized 
access while permitting outward communication.
Using a firewall protects your computer from malicious users on other net-
works or the Internet and keeps them from gaining access to your Mac.
Unlike older versions of Windows, Mac OS X is quite difficult to crack. There 
have been few (if any) reports of outsiders gaining access to Macintosh com-
puters running Mac OS X. One reason might be that Mac OS X has a built-in 
firewall. That’s the good news. The bad news is that said firewall is disabled 
by default. You’ll need to activate it if you want to be protected against 
unauthorized access to your computer.
To activate your firewall, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the System Preferences application (from the Applications 
folder, Ú menu, or Dock).
 
2. Click the Security icon and then click the Firewall tab.
 
 The default setting is Allow All Incoming Connections, which is the least 
secure option.
 
3. For the highest level of protection, select the Deny Incoming 
Connections Except for Essential Services radio button. 
If you need to allow some connections for any of the problems outlined in the 
following list, use the solution I describe instead.

367
 Chapter 17: Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues
 
Sometimes it’s desirable to allow incoming connections from outside comput-
ers. The following list outlines the most common scenarios and explains how 
to set up your firewall accordingly:
 
✓ Problem: You want to host a Web site on your Mac using the Mac OS 
X built-in Web Sharing feature. If you’ve selected the firewall’s Deny 
Incoming Connections Except for Essential Services setting, nobody can 
access your Web site — access is blocked by the firewall.
 
 Solution: Click the Set Access for Specific Services and Applications 
radio button. When you select this setting, the Firewall automatically 
allows incoming connections for any service you enable in the Sharing 
System Preferences pane. So click the Show All button at the top of the 
System Preferences window and then click the Sharing icon. Enable 
Web Sharing, and you’re good to go. I’ve enabled both File Sharing and 
Web Sharing in the Sharing System Preferences pane, as reflected in the 
Security System Preference panes shown in Figure 17-4. The firewall 
magically figures out that it should allow others to share files and view 
personal Web sites on this Mac.
 
✓ Problem: An application needs you to allow outside connections to 
it in order to function. How would you know? Check the user manual, 
Read Me file, or application Help. Or you might see an error message 
that the program can’t connect to the Internet. Don’t worry — if a pro-
gram requires you to open your firewall, you can almost certainly find 
some information in one (or more) of these places.
 
 Solution: Click the Set Access for Specific Services and Applications 
radio button. Now click the little + button on the left near the bottom of 
the window. A standard Open File sheet drops down over the window; 
select the appropriate program, click the Add button, and then choose 
Allow All Connections from its pop-up menu. 
 
 That’s how I enabled incoming connections for QuickTime Player in 
Figure 17-4.
 
✓ Problem: You encounter problems with a network-related activity and 
suspect that your firewall may be the problem.
 
 Solution: Click the Allow All Incoming Connections radio button 
temporarily to see whether that resolves the issue. If it does, add the 
program to your firewall’s list of applications and then choose Allow 
All Connections from its pop-up menu. If it doesn’t resolve the issue, 
don’t forget to reselect your previous setting — either Deny Incoming 
Connections Except for Essential Services or Set Access for Specific 
Services and Applications — before you call tech support.

Install recommended software updates
By default, your Mac checks with the mothership (Apple) once a week to 
see if there’s any new or updated software for your Mac. If there is, your Mac 
informs you that a new Software Update is available and asks whether you’d 
like to install it. In almost all cases, you do. Apple issues Software Updates to 
fix newly discovered security concerns, fix serious bugs in Mac OS X, or to fix 
bugs in or add functionality to Apple applications.
 
You can perform this check manually by clicking the Software Update icon 
in the System Preferences window and then clicking the Check Now button. 
You also use the Software Update System Preferences pane to change the 
frequency of these checks, disable automatic checking completely, and/or 
instruct your Mac to automatically download any updates it finds. 
 
Every so often, one of these Software Updates has an unintended side effect — 
while fixing one problem, it introduces a different problem. Apple is generally 
pretty careful, and this doesn’t happen very often, but if you want to be safe, 
don’t install a Software Update until you’ve visited MacFixIt (www.macfixit.
com) or MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com) and looked at their reports on 
the update you have in mind. If there are widespread issues with a particular 
Software Update, these two sites will have the most comprehensive coverage 
(and possible workarounds).

369
 Chapter 17: Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues
Protecting Your Data from Prying Eyes
The last kind of security I look at in this chapter is protecting your files from 
other users on your local area network and users with physical access to 
your Mac. If you don’t want anyone messing with your files, check out the 
security measures I describe in the following sections.
Blocking or limiting connections
The first thing you might want to do is open the Sharing System Preferences 
pane by launching the System Preferences application (from the Applications 
folder, Ú menu, or Dock) and clicking the Sharing icon. Nobody can access 
your Mac over the network if all the services in the Sharing pane are disabled 
and your firewall is set to either Block All Incoming Connections or Limit 
Incoming Connections to Specific Services and Applications. See the section 
“Firewall: Yea or nay?” earlier in this chapter for details on these settings.
Locking down files with FileVault
If you absolutely, positively don’t ever want anyone to be able to access the 
files in your Home folder, FileVault allows you to encrypt your entire Home 
folder and its contents. It protects your data with the latest government-
approved encryption standard — Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit 
keys (AES-128).
When you turn on FileVault, you’re asked to set a master password for the 
computer. After you do, you or any other administrator can use that master 
password if you forget your regular account login password.
 
If you turn on FileVault and then forget both your login password and your 
master password, you can’t log in to your account — and your data is lost for-
ever. Really. Not even DriveSavers has a hope of recovering it. So don’t forget 
both passwords, okay?
FileVault is useful primarily if you store sensitive information on your Mac. 
If you’re logged out of your user account and someone gets access to your 
Mac, there is no way they can access your data. Period.
Because FileVault encrypts your Home folder, some tasks that normally 
access your Home folder might be prevented. For one thing, some backup 
programs choke if FileVault is enabled. Also, if you’re not logged in to your 
user account, other users can’t access your Shared folder(s).

370
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
 
And because FileVault is always encrypting and decrypting files, it often slows 
down your Mac when you add or save new files, and it takes extra time before 
it lets you log out, restart, or shut down.
To turn on FileVault, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Security System Preferences pane and select the FileVault tab.
 
2. Click the Set Master Password button and set a master password for 
your computer.
 
3. Click the Turn on FileVault button to enable FileVault.
To turn off FileVault, click the Turn off FileVault button. At least that’s how it’s 
supposed to work, but . . . 
 
The last time I tested this feature, when I tried to turn off FileVault, I got an 
error message and was unable to disable FileVault. I tried every trick I know 
(and I know a lot) and contacted Apple’s support group, too. The issue was 
never resolved. I ended up having to erase the hard drive and restore files 
from backups (yet another reason multiple backups are a good thing).
Setting other options for security
The General tab of the Security System Preferences pane offers several more 
options that can help keep your data safe. They are
 
✓ Require Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver: 
Enable this option if you want your Mac to lock itself up and require 
a password after the screen saver kicks in or it goes to sleep. It can 
become a pain in the butt, having to type your password all the time. 
But if you have nosy co-workers, family members, or other individuals 
you’d like to keep from rooting around in your stuff, you should prob-
ably enable this option.
 
 When enabled, this option offers a pop-up menu that lets you specify 
how long after sleep or screen saver this password protection should 
kick in. The options range from immediately to four hours. 
 
✓ Disable Automatic Login: One of the login options in the Accounts 
System Preferences pane is automatic login. With automatic login 
enabled, you don’t have to choose an account or type a password when 
you start up this Mac. Instead, it bypasses all that login stuff and goes 
directly to the Desktop of the designated account. If you want to disable 

371
 Chapter 17: Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues
this feature for all accounts — so that every user of this Mac sees 
the login screen and is required to choose an account and type a 
password — you should enable this option.
 
✓ Require Password to Unlock Each System Preference Pane: If you 
prefer that non-administrator users be prevented from changing the set-
tings in any System Preferences pane, enable this option.
 
✓ Log Out after X Minutes of Inactivity: This feature does what it says — 
it logs out the current user after a specified length of idle time.
 
✓ Use Secure Virtual Memory: It is remotely possible that a motivated 
hacker could recover data you’ve recently read or written from one of 
Mac OS X’s virtual-memory swap files. Because it might have an adverse 
effect on your Mac’s performance, you probably want to keep this 
option disabled unless you’re extremely paranoid about anyone seeing 
any data on your Mac.
 
✓ Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver: There was a time not too 
long ago that many Macs included a little Apple Remote control device 
(though none do anymore). To disable it for all users, enable this option.

In This Chapter
▶ Crunching numbers with the Calculator
▶ Setting up lots of stuff, including AirPort Base Stations and Bluetooth devices
▶ Plumbing your Snow Leopard’s innards
▶ And much, much more . . .
M
ac OS X Snow Leopard comes with a plethora of useful utilities that 
make using your computer more pleasant and/or make you more pro-
ductive when you use your computer. In this chapter, I give you a glimpse of 
the ones that aren’t covered elsewhere in this book.
 
The first item, Calculator, is in your Applications folder; all the other items in 
this chapter are in your Utilities folder, inside your Applications folder (or you 
can use the Utilities folder’s keyboard shortcut Ô+shift+U).
Calculator
 
 Need to do some quick math? The Calculator application gives you a simple 
calculator with all the basic number-crunching functions that your pocket 
calculator has. To use it, you can either click the keys with the mouse or type 
numbers and operators (math symbols such as +, –, and =) using the numeric 
keypad on your keypad. Calculator also offers a paper tape (Window➪Show 
Paper Tape) to track your computations — and, if you want, provide a 
printed record. It can even speak numbers aloud (Speech➪Speak Button 
Pressed and Speech➪Speak).
Check out the Calculator in Figure 18-1.

374
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
 
Figure 18-1: 
The 
Calculator 
(left), 
Convert 
menu 
(middle), 
and Paper 
Tape (right).
 
In my humble opinion, the most useful feature in the Calculator (after the 
paper tape) is the Convert menu — more specifically, the Currency conver-
sion feature. It actually checks the Internet for the exchange rate before cal-
culating the conversion for you. That’s very cool.
Beyond that, Calculator has three modes: Basic, Scientific, and Programmer. 
Basic is the default, and you access the other two modes as follows:
 
✓ Pressing Ô+2 (View➪Scientific) turns the formerly anemic calculator 
into a powerful scientific calculator.
 
✓ Choosing View➪Programmer (Ô+3) turns it into the programmer’s 
friend, letting you display your data in binary, octal, hexadecimal, ASCII, 
and Unicode. It also performs programming operations such as shifts 
and byte-swaps. (If you’re a programmer, you know what all that means; 
if you aren’t, it really doesn’t matter.)
Activity Monitor
 
 In Unix, the underlying operating system that powers Mac OS X, applications 
and other things going on behind the scenes are called processes. Each appli-
cation and the operating system itself can run a number of processes at the 
same time.
In Figure 18-2, you see 54 different processes running, most of them behind 
the scenes. Note that when this picture was taken only two applications were 
actually running (the Finder and Activity Monitor itself).
To display the three CPU Monitor windows below the Activity Monitor 
window as shown in Figure 18-2, choose Window➪CPU Usage (keyboard 
shortcut Ô+2), CPU History (keyboard shortcut Ô+3), and/or Floating CPU 
Window (no keyboard shortcut).

375
 Chapter 18: Utility Chest
 
Figure 18-2: 
The Activity 
Monitor 
window 
(top) and 
the three 
little CPU 
Monitor 
windows 
(bottom).
 
You also select what appears in the Activity Monitor’s Dock icon — CPU 
Usage, CPU History, Network Usage, Disk Activity, Memory Usage, or the 
Activity Monitor icon — by choosing View➪Dock Icon. All but the Activity 
Monitor icon appear live, meaning that they update every few seconds to 
reflect the current state of affairs.
To choose how often these updates occur, choose View➪Update Frequency.
 
But be careful — shorter durations cause Activity Monitor itself to use more 
CPU cycles, which can decrease overall performance.
Finally, the bottom portion of the Activity Monitor window can display one 
of five different monitors. Just click the appropriate tab — CPU, System 
Memory, Disk Activity, Disk Usage, or Network — to see that particular 
monitor.
Geeks and troubleshooters can use Activity Monitor to identify what pro-
cesses are running, which user owns the process, and how much CPU capac-
ity and memory the process is using. You can even use this feature to quit or 
force-quit a process that you think might be causing problems for you.
 
Messing around in Activity Monitor isn’t a good idea for most users. If you’re 
having problems with an application or with Mac OS X, try quitting open appli-
cations; force-quitting applications (press Ô+Option+Esc — the Mac “three-
finger salute”); or logging out and then logging back in again before you start 
mucking around with processes.

376
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
AirPort Utility
 
 You use AirPort Utility to set up an AirPort Base Station and configure its 
individual settings, such as base-station and wireless-network passwords, 
network name, Internet connection type, and so on.
When you first open AirPort Utility, select the AirPort Base Station you want 
to work with by clicking its icon on the left side of the window.
If you want assistance with setting up your base station, just click the 
Continue button in the bottom-right corner of the AirPort Utility window. 
You’re asked a series of questions, and your base station is configured 
accordingly. If you know what you’re doing and want to change your base sta-
tion’s settings manually, choose Base Station➪Manual Setup (Ô+L) instead.
Audio MIDI Setup
 
 This program is the control center for any MIDI devices built into or con-
nected to your Mac.
ColorSync Utility
 
 ColorSync helps ensure color consistency when you’re scanning, printing, 
and working with color images. This package includes ColorSync software as 
well as premade ColorSync profiles for a variety of monitors, scanners, and 
printers. And the ColorSync Utility has a bunch of tools designed to make 
working with ColorSync profiles and devices easier. You’ll probably never 
need it, but I wanted to let you know it’s there, just in case.
A ColorSync profile is a set of instructions for a monitor, scanner, or 
printer, which tells the device how to deal with colors and white so the 
device’s output is consistent with that of other devices, as determined 
by the ColorSync profiles of the other devices. In theory, if two devices 
have ColorSync profiles, their output (on-screen, on a printed page, or in a 
scanned image) should match perfectly. Put another way, the color that you 
see on-screen should be exactly the same shade of color that you see on a 
printed page or in a scanned image.
 
If you’re not a graphic artist working with color files and calibrating monitors 
and printers to achieve accurate color matching, you probably don’t need 
the ColorSync Utility (unless you’ve gotten hooked on iPhoto and want your 
printed inkjet color pictures to match up correctly).

377
 Chapter 18: Utility Chest
If you’re compelled to do whatever it takes to get accurate color on your 
monitor and printer, check out Color Management For Digital Photographers 
For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).
DigitalColor Meter
 
 The DigitalColor Meter program displays what’s on your screen as numerical 
color values, according to two different systems: RGB (red-green-blue) or CIE 
(the abbreviation for a chromaticity coordinate system developed by the 
Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage, the international commission on 
illumination). If you’re not a graphic artist or otherwise involved in the pro-
duction of high-end color documents, you’ll almost certainly never need it.
Disk Utility
 
 If you’re having problems with your hard drive or need to make changes to it, 
Disk Utility is a good place to start. This application has five active compo-
nents: First Aid, Erase, Partition, RAID, and Restore.
To calibrate or not to calibrate?
One thing you might want to try, even if you 
never plan to use ColorSync, is calibrating 
your monitor. This process adjusts the red, 
green, blue, and white levels and could make 
what you see on your screen look better than 
it does now.
To calibrate your monitor, follow these steps:
 1. Open the Displays System Preferences 
pane.
 2. Click the Color tab and then write down the 
Display Profile that your Mac is currently 
using (it’s highlighted in the Display Profile 
list).
 3. Click the Calibrate button.
 
 The Display Calibrator Assistant appears.
 4. Follow the simple on-screen instructions to 
calibrate your monitor and create a custom 
display profile.
 5. Give your profile a name; then click the 
Continue button.
If you decide that you don’t like the results of 
your calibration, just select the Display Profile 
that you wrote down in Step 2 from the Display 
Profile list in the Displays System Preferences 
pane. Your monitor goes back the way it was 
before you calibrated it.

378
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
First Aid
If you suspect something’s not quite right with your Mac, the First Aid por-
tion of Disk Utility should be among your first stops. Use First Aid to verify 
and (if necessary) repair an ailing drive. To use it, click the First Aid button 
on the left side of the Disk Utility window. Click a volume’s icon and then 
click Verify. You get information about any problems that the software finds. 
If First Aid doesn’t find any problems, you can go on your merry way, secure 
in the knowledge that your Mac is A-okay. If verification turns up trouble, 
click Repair to have the problem fixed. You can also use First Aid to fix disk-
permission problems.
 
You won’t be able to use the copy of Disk Utility in your Applications/Utilities 
folder to repair your Mac OS X boot disk. To do that, you must reboot from a 
Mac OS X installation CD or DVD (or another bootable hard drive) and run the 
copy of Disk Utility on that CD or DVD.
 
You can’t use Disk Utility First Aid to fix a CD or DVD; neither can you use it to 
fix most disk image files. These disks are read only and can’t be altered. You 
can fix Zip disks, SuperDisks, DVD-RAM discs, or any other writeable media 
that can be mounted by your Mac.
Erase
Use Erase to format (completely erase) a disk. You can’t do this to the 
startup disk — the one with Mac OS X on it.
 
When you format a disk, you erase all information on it permanently. 
Formatting can’t be undone — so unless you’re absolutely sure this is what you 
want to do, don’t do it. Unless you have no use for whatever’s currently on the 
disk, make a complete backup of the disk before you format it. If the data is 
critical, you should have at least two (or even three) known-to-be-valid backup 
copies of that disk before you reformat.
Partition
Use this tab to create disk partitions (multiple volumes on a single disk). Mac 
OS X treats each partition as a separate disk.
RAID
By using Redundant Array of Individual Disks (RAID), you can treat multiple 
disks as a single volume, which is sort of the opposite of partitioning.

379
 Chapter 18: Utility Chest
Restore
Use the Restore tab to restore your Mac to factory-fresh condition from a 
CD-ROM or disk-image file.
In most cases, you install new software on your Mac from a CD-ROM or DVD-
ROM, or by downloading it from the Internet. Software vendors typically 
use an installer program that decompresses and copies files to their proper 
places on your hard drive. After you’ve installed the software, you’re back in 
business.
Apple’s variation on this theme is a humongous file called the disk image — 
everything you’d normally find on a disk, without the disk. These days, more 
developers are adopting the disk-image format for their downloadable install-
ers and updaters. When mounted on your Desktop (more on what mounting 
means in a minute), a disk image looks and acts just like a real disk. You can 
open it and see its contents in a Finder window, copy files from its window 
to another disk, drag it to the Eject button to remove it from your Desktop — 
go wild. To make a disk image appear on your Desktop, you double-click the 
image file. At that point, the Disk Utility application takes over and puts an 
icon (which for all intents and purposes looks like a disk) on your Desktop.
Disk Utility not only mounts images when you double-click them, but also 
lets you create your own disk-image files and burn them onto CD-ROMs and 
DVD-ROMs.
Of partitions and volumes
Partitioning a drive lets you create multiple vol-
umes. A volume is a storage space that (from 
the Mac’s point of view) looks and acts just like 
a hard drive; a partition is simply a designated 
volume on a drive, completely separate from all 
other partitions (volumes). You can create any 
number of partitions, but it’s a good idea to limit 
yourself to no more than a small handful. Lots of 
people, including me, use one partition for Mac 
OS X and another for Mac OS 9.
You can create drive partitions only on a newly 
formatted drive. So to partition a drive, first format 
it in Drive Setup and then create partitions. Before 
you do that, give some thought to how large a 
partition you want to create. You won’t be able to 
change your mind about it later.
By the same token, it’s absolutely not neces-
sary to use partitions. Many users never parti-
tion a hard drive and get along just fine. If you 
do choose to partition, you should probably limit 
the number of partitions you create. An iMac 
with a 320GB drive will do just fine with one or 
two (or maybe three) partitions — there’s no 
need to create more.

380
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
 
Because you can transfer disk images via the Internet — and because they 
act just like disks — they’re a great substitute for a CD-ROM or other disk-
based software installer. A software maker can create both a CD version of an 
installer and a disk image that can be downloaded.
By the way, you find out more about Disk Utility (mostly how to use it for 
troubleshooting) in Chapter 19.
Grab
 
 Want to take a picture of your screen? I used to do this a lot so that I could 
bring you the screen shots in this book’s figures. You can use Grab to take a 
picture of all or part of the screen and then save that file for printing or send-
ing around (say, to all your screaming fans who want to see your Desktop pat-
tern or how you’ve organized your windows). The first edition of this book 
used Grab, but I’ve used the superb Snapz Pro X utility (Ambrosia Software; 
www.ambrosiasw.com) for the figures in subsequent editions. It’s definitely 
worth the shareware fee.
 
Grab’s best feature is its capability to do a timed screen capture. Like those 
cameras that let you start the timer and then run to get into the shot, Grab 
gives you ten seconds to bring the window you want to the front, pull down 
a menu, get the cursor out of the way, or whatever you need to do to get the 
screen just right.
 
Grab’s default behavior is to display no cursor. If you want to show a cursor in 
your screen shots, choose Grab➪Preferences and then select a pointer from 
the ten choices in the Preference dialog. To have no cursor, click the topmost, 
leftmost item, which is an empty box that indicates no cursor.
Grapher
 
 Grapher is a venerable piece of eye candy that shows off your CPU’s compu-
tational power. A quick, visual math instructor, Grapher can graph equations 
in two or three dimensions and speaks hexadecimal, octal, base ten, and 
binary to boot. You can even graph curves, surfaces, inequalities, differential 
equations, discrete series, and vector and scalar fields . . . whatever that 
means. (I found all that information in Apple Help.)

381
 Chapter 18: Utility Chest
Java Preferences
 
 Java Preferences contains three tabs to set preferences for the versatile, pow-
erful, built-in Java language included with Snow Leopard. 
 
If you don’t have a good reason to change these settings, you should probably 
leave them alone.
Keychain Access
 
 A keychain is a way to consolidate all your passwords — the one you use to 
log into your Mac, your e-mail password, and passwords required by any Web 
sites. Here’s how it works: You use a single password to unlock your keychain 
(which holds your various passwords) and then you don’t have to remember 
all your other passwords. Rest assured that your passwords are secure 
because only a user who has your keychain password can reach the other 
password-protected applications.
 
The Keychain Access utility is particularly cool if you have multiple e-mail 
accounts, and each one has a different password. Just add them all to your 
keychain, and you can get all your mail at the same time with one password.
A keychain known as the login keychain is automatically created for you 
when you install Mac OS X Snow Leopard (or buy a new Mac with Snow 
Leopard preinstalled).
 
Here’s how to add passwords to your login keychain:
 
✓ To add passwords for applications, just open Mail or another applica-
tion that supports the keychain. When the program asks for your pass-
word, supply it and choose Yes to add the password to the keychain.
 
 How do you know which programs support the Keychain Access utility? 
You don’t until you’re prompted to save your password in a keychain 
in that Open dialog, connect window, or so forth. If a program supports 
Keychain Access, it offers a check box for it in the user ID/password 
dialog or window.
 
✓ To add a Web site password to a keychain, open the Keychain Access 
application and click the Password button. In the New Password Item 
window that opens, type the URL of the page (or copy and paste it) in 
the Keychain Item Name text field; type your username in the Account 
Name field; and then type your password in the Password text field, as 
shown in Figure 18-3.

To use the new URL password, use Safari to open the URL. If the account 
name and password aren’t filled in for you automatically, choose Edit➪
AutoFill Form (Ô+Shift+A), and they will be. Now just click the appropriate 
button on the Web page to log in.
 
If you select the User Names and Passwords check box on the AutoFill tab of 
Safari’s Preferences window (Safari➪Preferences or Ô+,), you don’t have to 
add sites, accounts, or passwords manually. Instead, the first time you visit a 
site that requires an account name and password, when you log in, Safari asks 
whether you would like to save your password, as shown in Figure 18-4.

Migration Assistant
 
 This is pretty much a one-trick pony, but that pony is a prizewinner. You use 
the Migration Assistant to transfer your account and other user information 
from another Mac or another volume on the current Mac to this one. You 
need to authenticate as an administrator to use it, but it’s a pretty handy way 
to transfer an account without having to re-create all the preferences and 

383
 Chapter 18: Utility Chest
other settings. When you first installed Snow Leopard (or when you booted 
your nice new Snow Leopard-based Mac for the first time), the setup utility 
asked you whether you wanted to transfer your information from another 
Mac — if you answered in the affirmative, it ran the Migration Assistant.
System Profiler
 
 System Profiler is a little program that is launched when you click the More 
Info button in the About This Mac window (Ô➪About This Mac). It provides 
information about your Mac. (What a concept!) If you’re curious about arcane 
questions such as what processor your Mac has or what devices are stashed 
inside it or are connected to it, give the Profiler a try. Click various items in 
the Contents list on the left side of the window, and information about the 
item appears on the right side of the window. Feel free to poke around this 
little puppy as much as you like — it’s benign and can’t hurt anything.
 
If you ever have occasion to call for technical support for your Mac, software, 
or peripherals, you’re probably going to be asked to provide information from 
System Profiler. So don’t get rid of it just because you don’t care about this 
kind of stuff.
Terminal
 
 Mac OS X is based on UNIX. If you need proof — or if you actually want to 
operate your Mac as the UNIX machine that it is — Terminal is the place to 
start.
Because Unix is a command-line-based operating system, you use Terminal to 
type your commands. You can issue commands that show a directory listing, 
copy and move files, search for filenames or contents, or establish or change 
passwords. In short, if you know what you’re doing, you can do everything 
on the command line that you can do in Mac OS X. For most folks, that’s not a 
desirable alternative to the windows-and-icons of the Finder window. But take 
my word for it; true geeks who are also Mac lovers get all misty-eyed about 
the combination of a command line and a graphical user interface.
 
You can wreck havoc upon your poor operating system with Terminal. You 
can harm your Snow Leopard in many ways that just aren’t possible using 
mere windows and icons and clicks. So — before you type a single command 
in Terminal — think seriously about what I just said. And if you’re not 100 
percent certain about the command you’ve just typed, don’t even think about 
pressing Return or Enter.

Troubleshooting Mac OS X
In This Chapter
▶ Facing the ol’ “My Mac Won’t Boot” blues
▶ Dealing with the prohibitory sign
▶ Recovering from startup crashes
A
s a bleeding-edge Mac enthusiast with over a quarter century of Mac 
experience under my belt, I’ve had more than my share of Mac troubles. 
Over those years, I’ve developed an arsenal of surefire tips and tricks that 
I believe can resolve more than 90 percent of Mac OS X problems without a 
trip to the repair shop.
 
Alas, if your hardware is dead, then, sadly, neither you nor I can do anything 
about it because it is now a job for your friendly Mac repairman — and your 
fat checkbook or high-limit credit card.
But if your hardware is okay, you have a fighting chance of using the sugges-
tions in this chapter to get your machine up and running.
The Ol’ “My Mac Won’t Boot” Blues
Although you usually see a stylish Apple logo when you turn on your com-
puter, once in a blue moon you might not. What you do see might be a solid 
blue screen, a solid gray screen, a solid black screen, or something else 
entirely as described in the next section. 
The point is that your Mac isn’t starting up as it should. When this happens it 
usually indicates that something bad has happened to your Mac. Sometimes 
it’s a hardware component that has bitten the dust; other times Mac OS X 
itself has somehow been damaged. 

386
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
Rest assured these occurrences are rather uncommon — many Mac users go 
an entire lifetime without seeing one. If you ever have a Mac that won’t boot, 
don’t despair immediately. Before you diagnose your Mac as terminally ill, try 
the following:
 
✓ Disconnect any external FireWire and USB devices (everything except 
your keyboard and mouse) and try booting from DVD-ROM to bring it 
back to life.
 
✓ If you’ve installed third-party memory (RAM from a vendor other than 
Apple), remove all non-Apple RAM chips and try booting from DVD-ROM 
to bring it back to life.
When I talk about booting, I mean starting up your Mac from a particular disk 
or disc. If you have your OS X installation DVD-ROM ready, you can skip to 
the section “Booting from a DVD-ROM,” later in this chapter. If you’re not sure 
about your Mac OS X installation DVD-ROM, see the next section.
The ultimate startup disk: The 
Mac OS X installation DVD
I bet you have a copy of the ultimate startup disk right there on your com-
puter table — the installation DVD (or the first disc if you received more than 
one) that came with your computer or boxed retail copy of Snow Leopard.
You see, in addition to the system software that you need to make your Mac 
work, these Mac OS X installation discs are bootable — and include a work-
ing copy of Disk Utility, which I discuss in the section “Step 1: Run First Aid,” 
later in this chapter.
If you see a prohibitory sign (top left in Figure 19-1), spinning-disc cursor (top 
right), or kernel panic alert (the text in four languages that appears below the 
other two images) that doesn’t go away when you start up your Mac, the first 
thing to do is attempt to repair hidden damage to your hard drive with the 
Apple Disk Utility program’s First Aid feature.
Another of Disk Utility’s features lets you verify and repair disk permissions, 
which is a handy thing to do if your Mac is telling you that you don’t have the 
correct permission to do things that you used to be able to do, such as move 
a file or folder into the Applications (or other) folder or move an icon to the 
Trash.
You get a brass-tacks view of using these utilities throughout the rest of this 
chapter.

If you don’t have a bootable DVD-ROM — preferably a Mac OS X Install 
DVD-ROM — you can’t do most of the rest of the stuff in this chapter. So if 
you don’t have that disc handy, go find it now. If you really can’t find one, 
consider calling Apple or your Apple dealer to arrange for a replacement — 
you really shouldn’t be without it.
Better safe than Macless
The bootable Mac OS X Install DVD-ROM is 
soooo important — try to have more than one 
copy around. That way, if one gets misplaced, 
damaged, eaten by the dog, scuffed, scratched, 
or otherwise rendered useless, you won’t be 
out of luck. I keep the Mac OS X Install DVD 
in my middle desk drawer and several other 
bootable CDs and DVDs on the bookshelf. An 
older version of Mac OS and the CD or DVD 
that came with your computer are examples of 
other bootable discs that you might have hang-
ing around. The Mac OS X Install DVD is boot-
able, as well. All these can boot your Mac in an 
emergency, which is why they’re so important 
to have handy.
One thing I’d do — if I had only one of these 
valuable discs — is use Apple’s Disk Utility (in 
Applications/Utilities) to create a disk image of 
the disc and then burn a copy or two as spares. 
Don’t forget to test the burned discs to ensure 
that they work and are bootable.
Note: Mac OS X Snow Leopard comes on a 
dual-layer DVD. That means that unless your 
Mac has a SuperDrive that burns dual-layer 
media (they all do today but the MacBook Air 
and some older Macs may not), you won’t be 
able to burn a copy of the disc. If that’s the case, 
find a friend or relative with a newer Mac and 
use it to copy the Snow Leopard DVD. Trust 
me — it’ll be worth the time and trouble if your 
original disc gets lost or damaged.

388
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
Booting from a DVD-ROM
To boot your Mac from a DVD-ROM installation disc, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert a bootable DVD-ROM (the Mac OS X Install DVD is a good 
choice).
 
 If your Mac uses a tray to hold the DVD, make sure that it retracts and 
that the disc is in.
 
 If you have a tray-loading DVD-ROM drive and it’s closed, you can get 
it to open by restarting (or starting up) your Mac while pressing the 
mouse button. Continue pressing until the drive tray pops out; then 
release.
 
2. Shut down or restart your Mac.
 
 If you shut it down, wait a few seconds and then start it up the usual way.
 
3. Press and hold down the C key immediately, and keep it pressed until 
your Mac either boots from the DVD or doesn’t. 
 
 If it does boot from the DVD-ROM, you see a Welcome screen — and you 
can skip to the section called, um, “If you can boot from DVD-ROM.” 
 
 If it doesn’t boot, you see a prohibitory sign, spinning-wheel-of-death, 
or kernel panic alert. . . anything but the first screen of the Mac OS X 
Installer, the login window, or the Finder. Any of those is your cue to try 
Step 4.
 
4. If your Mac doesn’t boot after Step 3, hold down the Option key while 
booting to display the built-in Startup Manager (see Figure 19-2).
 
Figure 19-2: 
The built-in 
Startup 
Manager.
 
 
 It displays icons for any bootable discs that it sees and allows you to 
select one (including the installation DVD).
 
5. Click the DVD-ROM icon to select it (on the right in Figure 19-2), and 
then press Return or Enter to boot from it.

389
 Chapter 19: Troubleshooting Mac OS X
 
 This technique is quite useful if your usual boot disk is damaged or 
having an identity crisis during startup. If it doesn’t work, however, skip 
to the “If you can’t boot from DVD-ROM” section.
If you can boot from DVD-ROM . . .
If you see the Mac OS X startup Welcome screen when you boot from your 
DVD-ROM, hope flickers for your Mac. The fact that you can boot from 
another disc (a DVD-ROM, in this case) indicates that the problem lies in one 
of two places: your hard drive and/or Mac OS X itself. Regardless of what the 
cause is, your Mac will probably respond to one of the techniques I discuss 
throughout the rest of this chapter.
 
So your Mac boots from the installation DVD-ROM, but you still have this little 
problem: You prefer that your Mac boot from your (much faster) hard drive 
than from the Install DVD-ROM. Not to worry. All you need to do is reinstall 
Mac OS X (as described in the appendix at the end of this book).
If you can’t boot from DVD-ROM . . .
If the techniques in this chapter don’t correct your Mac problem — or your 
Mac still doesn’t boot when you try to start it up with the DVD — then either 
you just installed something new that’s aggravating your Mac, or your Mac is 
probably toasted and needs to go in for repairs (usually to an Apple dealer).
 
To get your Mac up and running again, you can try any of the following:
 
✓ Call the tech-support hotline. Before you drag it down to the shop, try 
calling 1-800-SOS-APPL, the Apple Tech Support hotline. The service rep-
resentatives there may be able to suggest something else that you can 
try. If your Mac is still under warranty, it’s even free.
 
✓ Ask a local user group for help. Another thing you might consider is 
contacting your local Macintosh user group. You can find a group of 
Mac users near you by visiting Apple’s User Group Web pages at www.
apple.com/usergroups.
 
✓ Try Dr. Mac Consulting. Shameless plug alert! You can check out my 
consulting services at www.boblevitus.com or call 408-627-7577. My 
team of expert troubleshooters does nothing but provide technical 
help and training to Mac users, via telephone, e-mail, and/or our unique 
Internet-enabled remote-control software, which allows us to see and 
control your Mac no matter where in the world you are.
 
✓ Check whether you have RAM issues. Here’s a common problem: If 
you have problems immediately after installing random-access memory 
(RAM) — or any new hardware, for that matter — double-check that 
the RAM chips are properly seated in their sockets. (Warning: Don’t 

390
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
forget to shut down your Mac first.) With the power off and your Mac 
unplugged, remove and reinsert the RAM chips to make sure they’re 
seated properly. If you still have problems, remove the RAM chips tem-
porarily and see whether the problem still exists.
 
 Follow the installation instructions that came with the RAM chips — or 
the ones in the booklet that came with your Mac. But even if they don’t 
say to get rid of the static spark, you should — either by using an anti-
static strap (available from most RAM sellers) or by touching an appro-
priate surface (such as the power-supply case inside your Mac) before 
you handle RAM chips.
Question Mark and the Mysterians
When you turn on your Mac, the first thing it does (after the hardware tests) 
is check for a startup disk that has Mac OS X on it. If your system doesn’t find 
such a disk on your internal hard drive, it begins looking elsewhere — on a 
FireWire or Universal Serial Bus (USB) disk or on a CD or DVD.
 
If you have more than one startup disk attached to your Mac, as many users 
do, you can choose which one your Mac boots from in the Startup Disk System 
Preferences pane.
At this point, your Mac usually finds your hard drive, which contains your 
operating system, and the startup process continues on its merry way 
with the happy Mac and all the rest. If your Mac can’t find your hard drive 
(or doesn’t find on it what it needs to boot Mac OS X), you encounter the 
dreaded prohibitory sign. 
 
In the old days, before Mac OS X, you’d see a flashing question mark instead of 
the prohibitory sign. So for old timers, the prohibitory sign is this year’s flash-
ing question mark.
Don’t go cryin’ 96 Tears. Those icons just mean that your Mac can’t find 
a startup disk, a hard drive, or bootable CD-ROM or DVD-ROM with valid 
system software (either Mac OS X or a previous version supported by your 
particular Mac).
 
Think of the prohibitory sign as your Mac’s way of saying, “Please provide me 
a startup disk.”
 
If Apple can figure out a way to put a prohibitory sign on the screen, why the 
heck can’t the software engineers find a way to put the words “Please insert a 
startup disk” on the screen, as well? The curtness of these icons is one of my 
pet peeves about the Macintosh. I know — you’re clever and smart (because, 
of course, you’re smart enough to find help reading Mac OS X Snow Leopard 

391
 Chapter 19: Troubleshooting Mac OS X
For Dummies), so you know that a prohibitory sign means you should insert a 
startup disk. But what about everyone else?
If you encounter any of these warning icons, go through the steps I outline 
next in this chapter. You can try different options, such as using Disk Tools 
and First Aid, zapping the parameter RAM (PRAM), and performing a Safe 
Boot. Try them in the order listed, starting with Step 1. Then, if one doesn’t 
work, move on to the next.
Step 1: Run First Aid
In most cases, after you’ve booted successfully from the Mac OS X DVD, the 
first logical troubleshooting step is to use the First Aid option in the Disk 
Utility application.
 
Every drive has several strangely named components such as B-trees, extent 
files, catalog files, and other creatively named invisible files. They’re all 
involved in managing the data on your drives. Disk Utility’s First Aid feature 
checks all those files and repairs the damaged ones.
Here’s how to make First Aid do its thing:
 
1. Boot from your Mac OS X DVD by inserting the DVD and restarting 
your Mac while holding down the C key.
 
 The Mac OS X Installer appears on your screen.
 
2. Choose Installer➪Open Disk Utility to launch the Disk Utility applica-
tion that’s on the DVD.
 
3. When the Disk Utility window appears, click the First Aid tab to select 
that function of Disk Utility.
 
4. Click the icon for your boot hard drive at the left of the Disk Utility 
window (SnowLeopardHD in Figure 19-3).
 
 Your boot drive is the one with Mac OS X and your Home folder on it. I 
call this one SnowLeopardHD.
 
5. Click the Repair Disk button.
 
 Your Mac whirs and hums for a few minutes, and the results window 
tells you what’s going on. Ultimately, First Aid tells you (you hope) that 
the drive has been repaired and is now okay, as shown in Figure 19-4. If 
so, go back to work.
 
6. Quit Disk Utility by choosing Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility or by press-
ing Ô+Q.
 
7. Reboot without holding the C key down.

LeopardHD.
 
 
Figure 19-4: 
First Aid has

clean bill of 
health.
 
 
If First Aid finds damage that it can’t fix, a commercial disk-recovery tool, 
such as Alsoft’s DiskWarrior (my personal favorite), or Prosoft’s Drive Genius, 
might be able to repair the damage. And even if First Aid gave you a clean bill 
of health, you might want to run DiskWarrior or another third-party utility 

393
 Chapter 19: Troubleshooting Mac OS X
anyway, just to have a second opinion. Make sure you’re running a current ver-
sion; older versions might not be compatible with Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
 
DiskWarrior has resurrected more dead and dying hard drives for me than any 
other disk-repair utility I’ve ever tried or all of them combined. If you’re going 
to buy only one utility, make sure that it’s DiskWarrior. It’s almost like magic.
If everything checks out with First Aid, eject the DVD and try to boot from 
your hard drive again. If you still get the prohibitory sign, proceed to the next 
section to try a little dance called booting into Safe Mode.
Step 2: Safe Boot into Safe Mode
Booting your Mac in Safe Mode might help you resolve your startup issue by 
not loading nonessential (and non–Mac OS X) software at boot time. You do it 
by holding down the Shift key during startup, as shown in Figure 19-5.
 
Figure 19-5: 
You should 
see “Safe 
Boot” in red, 
just below 
“Mac OS X” 
on the Login 
Window. 
 
 
If your Mac is set up so you don’t have to log in, keep pressing the Shift key 
until the Finder loads completely. If you do log in to your Mac, type your pass-
word as usual, but before clicking the Log In button, press the Shift key again 
and hold it until the Finder loads completely.
 
You know you held the Shift key long enough if your Login Items don’t load 
(assuming that you have Login Items; you can create them in the Accounts 
System Preferences pane, although some programs create them for you).

394
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
Booting in Safe Mode does three things to help you with troubleshooting:
 
✓ It forces a directory check of the startup (boot) volume.
 
✓ It loads only required kernel extensions (some of the items in /System/
Library/Extensions).
 
✓ It runs only Apple-installed essential startup items (some of the items 
in /Library/Startup Items and /System/Library/Startup Items). Note 
that the startup items in the Library folders are different from the Login 
Items in the Accounts System Preferences pane.
Taken together, normally these changes can work around issues caused by 
software or directory damage on the startup volume.
 
Some features don’t work in Safe Mode. Among them are DVD Player, captur-
ing video (in iMovie or other video-editing software), using an AirPort card, 
using some audio input or output devices, or using an internal or external USB 
modem. Use Safe Mode only if you need to troubleshoot a startup issue.
If your Mac boots in Safe Mode, you might be able to determine what’s caus-
ing the issue by moving the contents of your Preferences folder (in Home/
Library) to the Desktop temporarily or by disabling Login Items (in the 
Accounts System Preferences pane). If either of these things resolves the 
issue, you can put Preferences files back in Home/Library/Preferences a few 
at a time, or you can re-enable Login Items one at a time until you figure out 
which Preferences file or Login Item is causing your problems.
If your Mac still has problems, try Step 3.
Step 3: Zapping the PRAM
Sometimes your parameter RAM (PRAM) becomes scrambled and needs to be 
reset. PRAM is a small piece of memory that’s not erased or forgotten when 
you shut down; it keeps track of things such as
 
✓ Time-zone setting
 
✓ Startup volume choice
 
✓ Speaker volume
 
✓ Any recent kernel-panic information
 
✓ DVD region setting
To reset (often called zapping) your PRAM, restart your Mac and press 
Ô+Option+P+R (that’s four keys — good luck; it’s okay to use your nose) until 

395
 Chapter 19: Troubleshooting Mac OS X
your Mac restarts itself. It’s kind of like a hiccup. You might see the spinning-
disc cursor for a minute or two while your Mac thinks about it — then the 
icon disappears, and your Mac chimes again and restarts. Most power users 
believe you should zap it more than once, letting it chime two, three, or even 
four times before releasing the keys and allowing the startup process to 
proceed.
Now restart your Mac without holding down any keys.
If the PRAM zap didn’t fix your Mac, move on to “Step 4: Reinstalling Mac OS X.”
 
Remember that your chosen startup disk, time zone, and sound volume are 
reset to their default values when you zap your PRAM. So after zapping, open 
the System Preferences application to reselect your usual boot disk and time 
zone, and set the sound volume the way you like it.
 
Unlike previous versions of the Mac OS, Mac OS X doesn’t store display or 
network settings in PRAM. If you’re having problems with video or networking, 
resetting PRAM won’t help.
Step 4: Reinstalling Mac OS X
I present the procedure to reinstall the system software as a second-to-last 
resort when your Mac won’t boot correctly, because it takes the longest and 
is the biggest hassle. I detail this procedure at length in the appendix.
Read the appendix and follow the instructions. If you’re still unsuccessful 
after that point, you have no choice but to consider Step 5. . . .
Step 5: Take your Mac in for repair
If none of my suggestions works for you and you’re still seeing anything you 
shouldn’t when you start up your Mac, you have big trouble.
You could have any one of the following problems:
 
✓ Your hard drive is dead.
 
✓ You have some other type of hardware failure.
 
✓ All your startup disks and your system software DVDs are defective 
(unlikely).

396
Part V: The Care and Feeding of Your Snow Leopard 
The bottom line: If you still can’t start up normally after trying all the cures I 
list in this chapter, you almost certainly need to have your Mac serviced by a 
qualified technician.
If Your Mac Crashes at Startup
Startup crashes are another bad thing that can happen to your Mac. These 
crashes can be more of a hassle to resolve than prohibitory-sign problems 
but are rarely fatal.
You know that a crash has happened when you see a Quit Unexpectedly 
dialog, a frozen cursor, a frozen screen, or any other disabling event. A startup 
crash happens when your system shows a crash symptom any time between 
the moment you flick the power key or switch (or restarting) and the moment 
you have full use of the Desktop.
Try all the steps in the previous sections before you panic. The easiest way to 
fix startup crashes (in most cases) is to just reinstall Mac OS X from the DVD, 
using the Archive and Install option. I detail this procedure at great length in 
the appendix. Read the appendix and follow the instructions. If you’re still 
unsuccessful after that point, come back and reread the “Step 5: Take your 
Mac in for repair” section.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
hese last chapters are a little different — they’re kind 
of like long top-ten lists. Although I’d like for you to 
believe I included them because I’m a big fan of Dave 
Letterman, the truth is that Wiley always includes The Part 
of Tens section in its For Dummies books. This book contin-
ues the tradition. And because Wiley pays me, I do these 
chapters how I’m asked. (The truth is, I think it’s fun.)
First, I tell you how to speed up your Mac experience. I 
then move on to a subject near and dear to my heart — 
awesome things for your Mac that are worth spending 
money on. Last but not least is a collection of great Mac-
related Web sites.

Chapter 20
Almost Ten Ways to Speed Up 
Your Mac Experience
T
his chapter is for speed demons only. At some time in their Mac lives, most 
users have wished that their machines would work faster — even those 
with new Macs with multiple processors. I can’t help you make your proces-
sors any faster, but here’s where I cover some ways to make your Mac at least 
seem faster. Better still, most of these tips won’t cost you one red cent.
 
Because this is the infamous Part of Tens, the powers that be require the 
word “ten” in the chapter title. But try as I might, I couldn’t come up with ten 
ways to speed up your Mac. The eight tips that follow were the best I could 
do. So, if you think of another one (or two) great ways to speed up your Mac, 
please send them to me at: SnowLeopard4Dummies@boblevitus.com. If your 
suggestion is really good I’ll include it in the next printing and give you full 
credit for thinking of it!
Use Those Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts (see Table 20-1 for a way-groovy list of the most useful ones) 
can make navigating your Mac a much faster experience compared with 
constantly using the mouse, offering these benefits:
 
✓ If you use keyboard shortcuts, your hands stay focused on the keyboard, 
reducing the amount of time that you remove your hand from the
keyboard to fiddle with the mouse.
 
✓ If you memorize keyboard shortcuts with your head, your fingers will 
memorize them, too.
 
✓ The more keyboard shortcuts you use, the faster you can do what 
you’re doing.
Trust me when I say that using the keyboard shortcuts for commands you 
use often can save you a ton of effort and hours upon hours of time.

 Chapter 20: Almost Ten Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience
Improve Your Typing Skills
One way to make your Mac seem faster is to make your fingers move faster. 
The quicker you finish a task, the quicker you’re on to something else. 
Keyboard shortcuts are nifty tools, and improving your typing speed and 
accuracy will save you time. Plus you’ll get stuff done faster if you’re not 
always looking down at the keys when you type.
As your typing skills improve, you also spend less time correcting errors or 
editing your work.
 
The speed and accuracy that you gain has an added bonus: When you’re a 
decent touch typist, your fingers fly even faster when you use those nifty key-
board shortcuts. (I list a gaggle of these in the preceding section, in Table 20-1.)
An easy way to improve your keyboarding skills is by using a typing tutor 
program such as Ten Thumbs Typing Tutor ($25 at www.tenthumbstyping
tutor.com) or TypeTrainer4Mac (free at http://homepage.mac.com/
typetrainer4mac/Menu1.html).
Resolution: It’s Not Just 
for New Year’s Anymore
A setting that you can change to potentially improve your Mac’s performance 
is the resolution of your monitor. Most modern monitors and video cards (or 
onboard video circuitry, depending on which Mac model you use) can display 
multiple degrees of screen resolution. You change your monitor’s display 
resolution in the same place where you choose the number of colors you 
want: the Display System Preferences pane. Select your resolution choice 
from the Resolutions list on the left side of this tab.
 
In Displays System Preferences, select the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box 
to change resolutions and color depth without opening System Preferences. 
You can then select your resolution from the Displays menu that appears near 
the right end of your menu bar, as shown in Figure 20-1.
Here’s the deal on display resolution: The first number is the number of pixels 
(color dots) that run horizontally, and the second number is the number of 
lines running vertically. It used to be that fewer pixels refreshed faster. But with 
LCD (flat-panel) monitors and notebooks, this isn’t always true. I have to admit 
that the speed difference between resolutions these days is a lot less important 
than it used to be. In fact, I can almost never tell the difference between one 
and the other. Furthermore, because you can see more on-screen at higher 

402
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
resolutions, a higher resolution reduces the amount of scrolling that you 
have to do and lets you have more open windows on the screen. Finally, the 
highest resolution is almost always the “native” resolution of that display, 
which means it will usually look the sharpest. So you could just as easily say 
that higher resolutions can speed up your Mac experience as well.
 
Figure 20-1: 
The handy 
Displays 
menu.
 
 
Bottom line: Choose a resolution based on what looks best and works best for 
you. That said, if your Mac seems slow at its current resolution, try a lower 
resolution and see whether it feels faster.
 
Although you can use Mac OS X at resolutions of less than 1,024 x 768, Apple has 
designed the OS X windows and dialogs on the assumption that your resolution 
will be at least 1,280 x 800. So if you choose a resolution lower than that, some 
interface elements in some windows or programs may be drawn partially (or 
completely) off-screen. Just keep that in mind if you choose a resolution below 
1,280 x 800.
A Mac with a View — and 
Preferences, Too
The type of icon display and the Desktop background that you choose affect 
how quickly your screen updates in the Finder. You can set and change these 
choices in the View Options window. From the Finder, choose View➪Show 
View Options (or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+J).
The View Options window, like our old friend the contextual menu, is . . . well, 
contextual: Depending on what’s active when you choose it from the View 
menu, you see one of four similar versions (shown in Figure 20-2). From left 
to right, the figure shows folders in Icon view, folders in List view, folders in 
Column view, folders in Cover Flow view, and the Desktop.

403
 Chapter 20: Almost Ten Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience
 
Figure 20-2: 
Your 
choices in 
the View 
Options 
windows for 
Icon view, 
List view, 
Column 
view, Cover 
Flow view, 
and the 
Desktop.
 
A handful of settings can impact the speed of your Mac or your ability to see 
what you want quickly:
 
✓ Icon size: The smaller the icon, the faster the screen updates, especially 
if the folder has many graphic files with thumbnails (those little icon 
pictures that represent the big picture the file contains).
 
 In the Icon view of the View Options window, moving the Icon Size slider 
to the left makes icons smaller and faster; moving it to the right makes 
them bigger and slower. In List view, select one of the two Icon Size radio 
buttons to choose smaller (faster) or larger (slower) icons. The differ-
ence is greater if you have an older Mac.
 
✓ Calculate All Sizes: I recommend that you deselect the Calculate All 
Sizes check box in the View Options window for List view. If you activate 
this option, the Finder calculates the size of every folder of every open 
window in List view and displays that number in the Size column. At 
least to me, the screen feels as though it redraws faster with this feature 
turned off. 
 
 
 If you want to know how big a folder is, you can always just click it and 
choose File➪Get Info (or use the keyboard shortcut, Ô+I).
 
✓ Show Columns: When it comes to speed, don’t worry about the Show 
Columns check boxes in the View Options window for List view — Date 
Modified, Date Created, Size, Kind, Version, and Comments. The effect 
of these items on screen updating is pretty small these days, so your 
choice should probably be made according to the specific information 
you want to see in Finder windows, not on whether choosing them slows 
down your Mac.

404
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
The Use As Defaults buttons at the bottom of the Icon and List View Options 
windows set the default appearance for all Finder windows of that type. If you 
don’t click the Use As Defaults button, any changes you make apply only to 
the active window (bobl in Figure 20-2). Note that Column windows and the 
Desktop don’t have a Use As Defaults button; in both cases, any changes you 
make automatically become the default.
Get a New, Faster Model
Apple keeps putting out faster and faster Macs at lower and lower prices. But 
some Mac models still ship with a paltry 1GB of RAM — not enough to run 
Snow Leopard at its best.
Check out the latest iMacs and Mac minis — they’re excellent values. Or if 
you crave portability, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are rocking good com-
puters and have never been less expensive. You might even consider a used 
Mac that’s faster than yours. The big-time honcho of auction Web sites, eBay 
(www.ebay.com), has hundreds of used Macs up for auction at any given 
time. Shopping on eBay might just get you a better Mac at an outstanding 
price. Give it a try!
Another excellent option is to visit the Apple Web site and search for refur-
bished equipment. You can frequently save hundreds of dollars by purchasing a 
slightly used Mac that has been refurbished to factory specifications by Apple. 
Another advantage to refurbs is that they come with an Apple warranty. If you’re 
on a tight budget, definitely check it out.
You Can Never Have Too Much RAM!
You get a lot of bang for your buck when you upgrade your Mac’s RAM. Get 
an additional gigabyte or two — you can never have too much. Your Mac will 
run better with at least 4GB of RAM, which will cost you under $100 in most 
cases and can be installed by anyone. Yes, anyone — the instructions are right 
there in your User Guide booklet, or you can find them at the Apple Technical 
Support pages (www.apple.com/support; search for RAM upgrade and your 
Mac model).
 
Unless, that is, you own a Mac mini. The Mac mini, you see, is exceedingly 
difficult to open without the proper and very specialized tool (a putty knife). 
And Apple frowns upon mere mortals applying such a tool to said Mac mini. 
Therefore, if you have a Mac mini, you might want to opt for the services of an 
authorized, certified Mac cracker-opener to perform your RAM upgrade. Or not.

 Chapter 20: Almost Ten Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience
Get an Accelerated Graphics Card
An accelerated graphics card is designed to speed up one thing: the screen-
update rate. They’re extremely popular with graphic-arts professionals and 
with gamers. Accelerated graphics cards blast pixels onto your screen at 
amazing speeds. And because the OS X Quartz Extreme imaging architecture 
hands off part of its load to the processor on an accelerated graphics card, it 
might even make your Mac’s other tasks faster because it does some of the 
work that your Mac’s main processor (CPU) used to do.
That’s the good news.
 
The bad news is that you can use a graphics accelerator only if your Mac 
has an accelerated PCI slot for it, which is where you install these suckers. 
Currently, only the PowerMac G4 or G5 and Mac Pro models are capable of 
graphics-card upgrades, and of those only Mac Pro can run Snow Leopard.
Again, visit www.macworld.com for information on the various graph-
ics cards available and how they compare with one another. Cards start at 
around a hundred dollars and go up from there. And remember, the older 
your Mac, the greater the performance boost you’ll see.
Get a New Hard Drive
Depending on how old your Mac is, a faster hard drive could provide a substan-
tial speedup. Because you have a Mac with an Intel processor, the internal hard 
drive that came with it is pretty fast already. Unless you also need more storage 
space, a new hard drive is probably not the best way to spend your bucks. On 
the other hand, if you have an older model, a faster (and larger) hard drive — 
whether FireWire, USB 2, or eSATA (if your Mac can support it) could be just 
the ticket.
FireWire and eSATA are the fastest busses (data pathways) you can use for 
external devices on most Macs.
FireWire, considered (until quite recently) the state of the art in connect-
ing devices that need fast transfer speeds, is used to connect devices that 
require high-speed communication with your Mac — hard drives, CD burners, 
scanners, camcorders, and such. It’s also the fastest bus that Macs support 
natively (all Macs except MacBooks, which no longer have a FireWire port 
except on the least expensive model). 

406
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Note that all current Mac models that do have FireWire have a type called 
FireWire 800. It uses a different type of cable than FireWire 400, which was 
found on older Macs. If you get a device that has FireWire 400 and your Mac 
has only FireWire 800 (or vice versa), it’ll work as long as you get a FireWire 
400-to-FireWire-800 adapter cable, available at the Apple Store and many 
other places.
eSATA, which is not supported natively by any Mac at this time, requires 
the addition of an inexpensive PCI card (Power Mac or Mac Pro) or 
ExpressCard/34 card (some MacBook Pros) — but it’s also the very fastest 
way to connect hard drives to Macs that support it. 
If you must use USB, make sure you get USB 2 and not plain old USB 
(Universal Serial Bus). Plain ol’ USB might work but it’s as slow as molasses 
by comparison. (Plain ol’ USB runs at about three percent of the speed of 
FireWire.)
USB 2, on the other hand, transfers data at roughly the same speed as 
FireWire. So if you have the need for speed, be sure you opt for a FireWire, 
USB 2, or eSATA hard drive and not a plain ol’ USB model. 
The good news is that whatever you choose, you can usually just plug it in 
and start using it. Ninety-nine percent of the time, there’s nothing more to it!

Chapter 21
Ten Ways to Make Your Mac 
Better by Throwing Money at It
T
his is one of my favorite chapters. I love souping up my Macs. I live to 
find ways of working smarter, saving time or hand motion, and coaxing 
my Mac to do more work in less time. So it gives me great pleasure to share 
in this chapter my favorite top ten things that you can buy for your Mac to 
tweak it and make it faster, easier to use, and (I hope) more fun.
The items listed in this chapter are things I have, use every day, love dearly, 
and would (and probably will!) buy again.
RAM
RAM, or random-access memory, is your computer’s primary working memory. 
The more you have, the smoother your Mac runs — period. If you have anything 
less than 2GB in your Mac, you’ll like your Mac a lot better if you upgrade to 
2GB or more. If you like to do more than a few things at the same time, more 
RAM will make you a much happier camper. (For what it’s worth, RAM has 
never been cheaper than it is today — and it’s worth every penny.)
I know I mention it in the previous chapter, but in addition to speeding up your 
Mac, more RAM makes using your Mac better in other ways. For example, when 
you have plenty of RAM, you can open many programs at the same time without 
a performance penalty. I have 3GB in my MacBook Pro. I almost always have the 
15 or 20 programs I use most open at all times. Then all my favorite applications 
are available instantly, and I don’t have to wait while a program launches.
 
Right this moment, for example, I have at least 18 programs running, as shown in 
Figure 21-1. What you can’t see is that Activity Monitor tells me I’ve still got more 
than 1GB of RAM available and that my Mac is still quite fast and responsive. 

408
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 21-1: 
Here’s what 
my Dock 
looked like 
a few 
seconds 
ago. 
 
 
It’s also easy as pie to install RAM in most Macs made this decade. Chances 
are good that the manual for your Mac includes step-by-step instructions 
simple enough for a nine-year-old to follow. I know, because I once asked my 
(then) nine-year-old son to do it. Which he did — and with no trouble, either.
Backup Software and/or Hardware
Only two kinds of Mac users exist: those who have lost data and those who 
are going to. If your work means anything to you, you had better back it up 
before it’s too late. If you have a spare hard drive, by all means use the cool 
(and free) Time Machine software that comes with Mac OS X Snow Leopard. 
If you want to create multiple backups to several different devices or types 
of media (DVD-R, CD-R, Tape, and so on), invest in the appropriate hardware 
and software.
 
In case you missed it, you can find a lot of info about backup software and 
hardware in Chapter 17.
A Better Monitor (Or a Second One)
If you have a tiny monitor, get a bigger one. With a larger monitor, you spend 
less time scrolling and rearranging windows and more time getting actual 
work done — which is a good thing, right?
The best thing about it is that current Macs let you use two monitors as though 
they were a single display. For example, my main computer setup is a MacBook 
Pro with a 15-inch built-in display. When I’m at my desk it’s also connected to 
a 24-inch Westinghouse flat-panel LCD display. It’s an awesome setup — one 
that I highly recommend. With two monitors, I keep the menu bar and Finder 
windows on the smaller built-in display and put my document(s) on the larger 

409
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Make Your Mac Better by Throwing Money at It
external display. Or, when using a program such as Adobe Photoshop (which 
has lots of floating palettes), I can put some (or all) of the palettes on one 
monitor and documents I’m using on the other. And so on.
Another thing Macs can do with two monitors is mirror what’s on one display 
on the second one. So you can work with one display facing you and point 
the other one (or a projector) at the audience so they can see what you’re 
doing, too.
Flat-panel LCD displays have come down dramatically in price over the past 
year. If you can afford a bigger one you’ll love it. 
A Fast Internet Connection
High-bandwidth (that is, fast-Internet-access) connections just rock. If you 
add a high-speed Internet connection, such as digital subscriber line (DSL) 
or cable modem, your capacity to communicate electronically increases 
tenfold (or twentyfold, or even a hundredfold). With this add-on, you can 
join an online service, surf the Internet, e-mail your friends, and do much, 
much more — at speeds ten or more times faster than dial-up service with 
an analog modem. Web pages that took minutes to load with dial-up appear 
on-screen almost instantly. And broadband is fast enough for you to listen to 
streaming audio or watch streaming video without (many) hiccups.
If you can afford cable/DSL ($25–50/month in most places) and live in an area 
where you can get cable modem or DSL (not all places can yet), it will change 
the way you view the Internet. For more on setting up an Internet connection, 
see Chapter 9.
 
I pay a little bit more for premium cable Internet access that’s up to twice as 
fast as the “standard” speed package — and it’s worth every penny. 
A DVD Burner
Most Macs come with an internal SuperDrive — Apple’s name for a CD and 
DVD reader/writer. If your Mac doesn’t have a SuperDrive, and you want to 
back up or archive a lot of data, consider adding an external CD/DVD burner.
 
Another reason you might want an external DVD burner is that most Macs 
now come with a slot-loading drive — which means you can’t use the mini-
DVDs that many cameras and camcorders now employ. Most external DVD 
burners are tray-loading, making them more useful to mini-DVD camera and 

410
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
camcorder users. And having two DVD burners makes duplicating your iDVD 
offerings and the like faster and easier. Finally, most external DVD burners can 
burn discs up to twice as fast as their internal counterparts.
External DVD burners, available from many manufacturers, connect to your 
Mac via either FireWire or USB 2. These external devices have the same capa-
bilities as a built-in Apple SuperDrive — they burn CD-Rs or CD-RWs that can 
hold up to 700MB of data, and DVD-Rs or DVD-RWs that can hold up to 8.5GB 
of data. The only difference between an Apple SuperDrive and a third-party 
CD/DVD burner is that the latter is external. And because it’s not bundled by 
Apple, it isn’t called a “SuperDrive.”
If you don’t already have a DVD burner, an external CD/DVD burner is the way 
to go. If you’re getting a new Mac soon, pop for a SuperDrive — I promise you 
won’t regret it.
 
If you have a SuperDrive (or an external CD/DVD burner), for goodness’ sake — 
use it to back up your stuff!
Games
Gaming on the Mac has never been better, and the game developers are getting 
better and better at coaxing even more performance out of Mac OS X.
Some of the games I love include Unreal Tournament, Guitar Hero, and every 
pinball game LittleWing (www.littlewingpinball.com) has ever created. 
Try one — you’ll be amazed at how far computer gaming has come.
Multimedia Titles
Many great games, references, and educational titles come on CD-ROM or 
DVD-ROM these days. My favorite is World Book, which makes use of many 
Mac features to deliver an encyclopedia that’s both authoritative and fun to 
use. You’ll love it, and so will your kids. Remember, your Mac is more than 
just a computer — it’s a full-blown multimedia player. Enjoy it.
 
Don’t forget that all Macs (but the MacBook Air) can also play video DVDs like 
those you rent at Blockbuster or NetFlix.

411
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Make Your Mac Better by Throwing Money at It
Some Big Honking Speakers 
with a Subwoofer
Face it: Most Macs have crummy speakers (or, worse, only one crummy 
speaker). With a decent set of speakers, games are more fun, music sounds 
like music instead of AM radio, and the voiceovers in your multimedia titles 
suddenly become intelligible. If you’re into sound, you’ll enjoy your Mac much 
more if you add a set of window-rattling speakers, preferably with a massive 
subwoofer to provide that booming bass that sound lovers crave. So crank it 
up! I’m partial to Blue Sky’s EXO 2.1 Stereo Monitoring Speaker System (www.
abluesky.com), which is totally awesome but not cheap (around $350). But 
any good speakers kick the stuffing out of the speakers built into any Mac.
 
A killer set of speakers makes watching movies on your Mac a zillion times 
better.
A New Mouse and/or Keyboard
If you’re still using some old crummy one-button mouse, do yourself a favor 
and beat it to death with a hammer. Then buy a real mouse. You’ll be so 
much happier if you upgrade to a mouse that’s easier to move around, more 
comfortable to use, and maybe even has two or more buttons and/or a scroll 
wheel. You’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to work with a mouse that 
fits your hand. OS X knows all about multibutton mice and scroll wheels. And 
with a two-button mouse, you no longer have to hold down the Control key 
while clicking to display a contextual menu — you can just right-click.
Also consider ditching the silly little keyboard that came with your iMac, Mac 
Pro, or whatever. Third-party Mac keyboards on the market today are a huge 
improvement over what came with your Mac.
 
I’m partial to third-party keyboards and mice because I can’t stand any of the 
bundled Apple mice or keyboards. They’re aesthetically pleasing but not very 
good compared to almost all third-party mice and keyboards.
 
I’m partial to so-called ergonomic keyboards, which I find more comfortable for 
prolonged writing sessions. I also think I type faster with this kind of keyboard. 
My current axe is a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. Even though 
it’s a Windows keyboard and the modifier keys are mislabeled (the Ô key says 
Alt, and the Option key says Start and has a Windows logo on it), Microsoft 
offers excellent Mac OS X drivers for it.

A MacBook or MacBook Pro
You need a laptop because one Mac is never enough. With a portable Mac, you 
can go anywhere and continue to compute. And MacBooks, MacBook Airs, and 
MacBook Pros come with Apple AirPort Extreme wireless networking, so you 
can surf the Net, print, and share files from the couch, the pool, the airport 
(the kind with airplanes and a lowercase a and p) — or Starbucks, for that 
matter.

A
s much as I would love to think that this book tells you everything you 
need to know about using your Mac, I know better. You have a lot more 
to discover about using your Mac, and new tools and products come out 
every single day.
The best way to gather more information than you could ever possibly soak 
up about all things Macintosh is to hop onto the Web. There, you can find 
news, freeware and shareware (try-before-you-buy software) to download, 
troubleshooting sites, tons of news and information about your new favorite 
OS, and lots of places to shop. So make sure that you read Chapter 9 to get 
set up for the Internet — because this chapter is all about finding cool stuff 
on the Web to help you use your Mac better (and have lots of fun doing it).
The sites in this chapter are the best, most chock-full-o’-stuff places on the 
Web for Mac users. By the time you finish checking out these Web sites, you’ll 
know so much about your Mac and Mac OS X Snow Leopard that you’ll feel 
like your brain is in danger of exploding. On the other hand, you might just 
feel a whole lot smarter. Happy surfing!
MacFixIt
www.macfixit.com
Frequent Macworld contributor and consultant Ted Landau put together an 
excellent troubleshooting site to help users solve common problems and 
keep current on compatibility issues with new system software and third-
party products.
Alas, Ted has taken a less active role in the site of late, and there is now a 
surcharge to search the archives. This site isn’t quite as useful as it once 
was if you don’t purchase a Pro membership (currently $25 a year). But even 
without paying, it’s worth checking this site when you have any problem with 
your Mac. Chances are good that MacFixIt has a solution.

414
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If you’re serious about Mac troubleshooting, though, I encourage you to pop 
for a Pro subscription at just over $2 a month. It’s worth more than that to 
have unlimited access to MacFixIt’s extensive, searchable troubleshooting 
archives and special reports.
I use it so much I’d consider it a bargain at twice the price.
VersionTracker
www.versiontracker.com
For free software or shareware, check out VersionTracker. It’s one of the best 
sites in the world for software to use with Snow Leopard (or any version of 
Mac OS, for that matter). It’s also terrific for getting the latest version of any 
kind of software: commercial, shareware, and/or freeware. VersionTracker is 
a virtual treasure trove of software and updates, and it’s worth visiting even 
when you aren’t looking for anything in particular.
 
You can also purchase a subscription to VersionTracker Pro (which is offered 
in combination with a MacFixIt Pro subscription at a reduced price — that’s 
what I have). Your subscription gets you special Version Tracker software that 
searches your hard drive for applications and can notify you when any pro-
gram you own has been updated. If you own or download a lot of programs, a 
VersionTracker Pro subscription is a wonderful thing indeed. So check it out 
and download something useful, interesting, fun, or all three.
 
I love this site and sometimes visit it several times a day. (I know — I should 
get a life.)
MacInTouch
www.macintouch.com
For the latest in Mac news, updated every single day, check out MacInTouch.
com. Authored by longtime MacWeek columnist Ric Ford and his staff of 
newshounds, along with a legion of knowledgeable readers, this site keeps 
you on the bleeding edge of Mac news — including software updates, virus 
alerts, and Apple happenings. It also offers extensive and unbiased reviews of 
most Apple hardware and software soon after its release.
I consider MacInTouch essential for keeping up with what’s new and cool for 
your Mac.

Macworld
www.macworld.com
This site describes itself thusly: “Macworld is the premier source for news, 
reviews, help and how-to, videos, and podcasts for the Apple market.”
And it’s true. Macworld is perhaps the best and most comprehensive source 
of product information on the Web. It’s especially strong for comparative 
reviews of Mac products. For example, if you want to know which inkjet 
printer or digital camera is the best in its price class, Macworld.com can 
probably tell you. You won’t merely find product information here, you’ll find 
it accompanied by expert opinions and professional fact-checking. 
Put another way, I trust the writers and editors at Macworld more than I trust 
the writers and editors of any other Mac-oriented Web site.

product — including Mac OS X Snow Leopard? March your question right 
over to the Apple Support and Knowledge Base page, where you can find 
searchable archives of tech notes, software update information, and docu-

 Chapter 22: Ten (Or So) Great Web Sites for Mac Freaks
ramseeker
http://blog.ramseeker.com
One of the best ways to make your Mac better is to buy more random-access 
memory (RAM). RAM is the readily available memory that your computer 
uses; the more you have, the smoother programs run. Although Mac OS X 
might run on a Mac with less than 512MB of RAM, it works much better and 
faster with more than that — at least 1GB, in my opinion. As cheap as RAM 
is today, the price that you pay for it can still vary quite a bit. The best way 
I know to get the lowdown on RAM prices is to use the Ramseeker feature of 
this site, which surveys multiple vendors daily and then organizes current 
memory prices by Mac type.
Figure 22-2 shows how it works.
 
I learned that my particular MacBook Pro, known as “Early 2008,” requires 
PC5300 DDR RAM by visiting the Apple product-specification Web pages at 
http://support.apple.com/specs.

upgrades 
from eight 
different 
vendors.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Other World Computing
www.macsales.com
Other World Computing has become the “go to” place for Mac peripherals. 
Whether you need RAM, hard drives, optical drives, video cards, processor 
upgrades, cables, discs, or anything else you can think of, Other World 
Computing probably has it at a reasonable price. Because of its inexpensive 
and reliable delivery and a solid guarantee of every item, you can’t go wrong 
buying from OWC.
EveryMac.com
www.everymac.com
The author of this site claims that it’s “the complete guide” to every Macintosh, 
Mac-compatible, and upgrade card “in the world.” You can’t argue with that 
(unless you’ve done a staggering amount of research). Check out the Forum 
and Q&A sections for answers to Mac-related questions.
The Mac Observer
www.macobserver.com
The Mac Observer gives you Mac news, views, reviews, and much more. I 
write a column — “Dr. Mac’s Rants & Raves” — for it twice a month, but I 
loved this site long before it hired me.
Inside Mac Games
www.imgmagazine.com
Inside Mac Games is the best of the Mac gaming sites on the Web (at least in 
my humble opinion). Order CDs of game demos, download shareware, check 
out game preview movies, or shop for editors and emulators. Find forum 
camaraderie and troubleshoot gaming problems, too.

dealmac
www.dealmac.com
Shopping for Mac stuff? Go to dealmac (“How to go broke saving money,” 
this site boasts) first to find out about sale prices, rebates, and other bargain 
opportunities on upgrades, software, peripherals, and more.
Dr. Mac Consulting
www.boblevitus.com
Dr. Mac Consulting is (in all due modesty) my cool new troubleshooting, 
training, and technical-support site, designed just for Mac users. With several 
expert technicians on staff, Dr. Mac Consulting provides jargon-free expert 
technical help at a fair price, regardless of your physical location — and usu-
ally on the same day. Let one of our experts (or even me) provide high-quality 
Macintosh troubleshooting, technical support, software or system training, 
prepurchase advice, and more! We do our thing via phone; e-mail; iChat; 
and/or our unique Web-enabled, remote-control software (or Snow Leopard 
Screen Sharing), which lets us fix many common Mac ailments in less than 
an hour, controlling your mouse and keyboard remotely as we explain every-
thing we’re doing to you on the phone.
The next time you need help and none of the aforementioned sites does the 
trick, why not let Dr. Mac Consulting make the mouse call? (So to squeak.)
Note: This crass commercial message is one of two times in the whole book 
where I blather on about my “day job.” So if there’s something you want to 
know about your Mac or something you would like examined or fixed, we can 
probably help you in less than an hour. I hope you’ll give it a try.
And now, back to your regularly scheduled programming.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Appendix
Installing or Reinstalling 
Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
(Only If You Have To)
I
f Mac OS X Snow Leopard came preinstalled on a new Mac, you’ll probably 
never need this appendix. 
 
If you’re thinking about reinstalling because something has gone wrong with 
your Mac, know that a Mac OS X reinstallation is a pain-in-the-buttocks final 
step. Be sure you’ve tried all the stuff in Chapter 19 before even thinking about 
reinstalling OS X. If nothing else fixes your Mac, reinstalling Mac OS X could 
well be your final option before invasive surgery (that is, trundling your Mac to 
a repair shop). You don’t want to reinstall OS X if something easier can correct 
the problem. So if you have to do a reinstallation, realize that this is more or 
less your last hope (this side of the dreaded screwdriver, anyway).
In this appendix, you discover all you need to know to install or reinstall OS X, 
if you should have to. I say reinstalling is a hassle because although you won’t 
lose the contents of your Home folder, applications you’ve installed, or the 
stuff in your Documents folder (unless something goes horribly wrong or you 
have to reformat your hard drive), you might lose the settings for some System 
Preferences, which means you’ll have to reconfigure those panes manually 
after you reinstall. And you might have to reinstall drivers for third-party 
hardware such as mice, keyboards, tablets, and the like.
It’s not the end of the world, but it’s almost always inconvenient. That said, 
reinstalling OS X almost always corrects all but the most horrifying and 
malignant of problems. And as you soon see, the process is (compared with 
root-canal work or income taxes) relatively painless. I stay with you through 
it all, though; don’t you worry about a thing.

422
Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies 
How to Install (or Reinstall) Mac OS X
In theory, you should have to install Mac OS X only once. And in a perfect 
world, that would be the case. But you might find occasions when you have 
to install/reinstall it, such as
 
✓ If you get a Mac that didn’t come with Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
preinstalled.
 
✓ If you have a catastrophic hard-drive crash that requires you to initialize 
(format) your boot drive.
 
✓ If you buy an external hard drive and want it to be capable of being your 
Mac’s startup disk (that is, a bootable disk).
 
✓ If any essential Mac OS X files become damaged or corrupted, or are 
deleted or renamed.
 
The following instructions do double duty: They’re what you do to install OS X 
for the first time on a Mac, and they’re also what you do if something really 
bad happens to the copy of OS X that you boot your Mac from. The instruc-
tions offered here describe both the process for installing and the process for 
reinstalling OS X. The only difference is the choice you make in the Options 
window in Step 4.
 
If you’ve backed up or duplicated your entire hard drive, you might prefer to 
reinstall from your backup disks, CDs, DVDs, or tapes rather than reinstalling 
OS X from the Install Mac OS X DVD. That way you can be certain that anything 
you’ve tweaked on your Mac will be just the way you (most recently) left it — 
your System Preferences will be the way you like them, and you won’t have to 
bother with reinstalling drivers for your third-party hardware.
Here’s how to install (or reinstall) OS X, step by step:
 
1. Boot from your Install Mac OS X DVD by inserting the DVD into your 
machine’s DVD drive and then restarting your Mac while holding 
down the C key.
 
 When Mac OS X has finished booting your Mac, the Install program 
launches automatically. Here’s where you begin the process of installing 
or reinstalling Mac OS X.
 
2. Unless you want to use a language other than English for the main 
language of Mac OS X, click the Continue button (a blue arrow 
pointing to the right) in the first screen you see.
 
 If you do want to use another language, select the language by clicking 
its name and then click the Continue button.

423
 Appendix: Installing or Reinstalling Mac OS X Snow Leopard
 
3. Read the Welcome and Software License Agreement screens, clicking 
Continue after each.
 
 A sheet drops down, asking whether you agree to the terms of the license 
agreement. If you don’t, you can’t go any farther, so I advise you to go 
ahead and click the Agree button.
 
4. Choose the disk on which you want to install (or reinstall) Mac OS X by 
clicking its icon once in the Select a Destination screen. Then select an 
option from the Options button.
 
 At the bottom of the Select a Destination screen is the Options button, 
which offers three mutually exclusive choices:
 
• Upgrade Mac OS X: Choose this option to upgrade an earlier version 
of OS X installed on the disk you choose in this step. Your Home 
and other files are left undisturbed; after the upgrade, things will 
be (more or less) as they were before, except you’ll be running a 
redone installation of OS X, and this time it’ll be Snow Leopard.
 
• Archive and Install: Choose this option to move all the System 
components from your existing OS X installation into a folder 
named Previous System and then install a fresh new copy of OS X. 
The Previous System folder cannot be used to boot — but it does 
contain any and all files that were in any of the OS X folders before 
you upgraded.
 
 If you select this option, a check box for a second option — Preserve 
Users and Network Settings — becomes available. Select it if you 
want to import all the existing users of this Mac, their Home folders, 
and their network settings — but still archive all the old System stuff 
in the Previous System folder.
 
 If you choose this option, you skip the Setup Assistant discussed 
later in this appendix.
 
• Erase and Install: Choose this option if you want to completely erase 
the disk that you selected in Step 4, starting completely from 
scratch — which gives you a factory-fresh installation.
 
 If you choose the Erase and Install option, the disk you selected in 
Step 4 will be erased — and all your files are deleted immediately! 
You should choose this option only if you’ve backed up all your 
documents and applications. In most cases, erasing the startup 
disk isn’t necessary.
 
 If you select this option, the Format Disk As pop-up menu appears. 
Your choices are Mac OS Extended (Journaled), which is the one you 
want, and Unix File System (the one you don’t want).
 
 Unix File System is not a good choice for most Mac OS X users. Suffice 
it to say that 99.9 percent of people should absolutely and positively 
avoid Unix File System like the proverbial plague (the 0.1 percent 
know who they are — and why they need a UFS disk). ’Nuff said.

424
Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies 
 
5. Click OK to return to the Select a Destination screen and then click 
Continue.
 
6. Select which installation to perform — easy or customized:
 
• Easy Install copies all Mac OS X onto your chosen hard drive 
(which you choose in Step 4).
 
• Custom Install (click the Customize button at the bottom of the 
screen) enables you to choose to install only the items that you 
want to install.
 
 In almost all cases, whether you’re either doing a complete installation 
or reinstallation, Easy Install is the easy way to go — so that’s what I 
assume you’ll choose.
 
7. To begin the installation, click the Install button.
 
 The operating system takes 10 to 30 minutes to install, so now might be 
a good time to take a coffee break. When it’s done installing, your Mac 
restarts itself, and you can begin using Mac OS X . . . hopefully trouble-free.
 
 After your Mac reboots, the Setup Assistant appears — unless you’ve 
chosen Archive and Install and also selected the Preserve Users and 
Network Settings option, which would obviate the need for the Setup 
Assistant. (Your settings from before the installation would be intact.)
 
8. Work your way through all the Setup Assistant screens.
 
 You have to do that housekeeping before you can begin working in OS X, 
and I show you how in the next section.
Getting Set Up with Setup Assistant
Assuming that your installation (or reinstallation) process goes well and your 
Mac restarts itself, the next thing you should see (and hear) is a short, colorful 
movie that ends by transforming into the first Setup Assistant screen, 
fetchingly named Welcome.
To tiptoe through the Setup Assistant, follow these steps:
 
1. When the Welcome screen appears, choose your country from the list 
by clicking it once and then click the Continue button.
 
 If your country doesn’t appear in the list, select the Show All check box, 
which causes a bunch of additional countries to appear.
 
 After you click Continue, the Personalize Settings screen appears.

425
 Appendix: Installing or Reinstalling Mac OS X Snow Leopard
 
2. Choose a keyboard layout from the list by clicking it once; then click 
Continue.
 
 If you’re an American (or want to use an American keyboard setup), 
click the U.S. listing. If you prefer a different country’s keyboard layout, 
select the Show All check box, and a bunch of additional countries’ key-
boards (as well as a pair of Dvorak keyboard layouts) appear in the list. 
Choose the one you prefer by clicking it — and then click Continue.
 
 The Migration Assistant screen appears next. If this is a brand-new Mac 
or you’re installing Mac OS X Snow Leopard on a Mac and have an older 
Mac nearby, you can transfer all your important files and settings by fol-
lowing the on-screen instructions and connecting the new and old Macs 
via FireWire cable. Just follow the instructions given by the Migration 
Assistant and then chill for a while — it’ll probably take an hour or more 
to transfer your files and settings from the old Mac to the new one.
 
 The Your Apple ID screen appears.
 
3. Click the appropriate radio button: My Apple ID Is, Create an Apple ID
for Me, or Don’t Create an Apple ID for Me. If you have an Apple ID, type 
your username and password in the appropriate fields. Now click 
Continue.
 
 Click the Learn More button to find out more about an Apple ID and 
what it can do for you. In a nutshell, it lets you make one-click purchases 
at the iTunes Store, iPhoto, or the Apple Store. If you get one now, you 
also get a free, limited 60-day trial account with MobileMe. When you’re 
finished reading, click OK and then click Continue.
 
 The Registration Information screen appears.
 
4. Fill out the fields (name, address, phone number, and so on) and then 
click Continue.
 
 If you’re interested in what Apple will and won’t do with this information, 
click the Privacy button on this screen and read the Privacy Policy.
 
 The Thank You screen appears.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
 The Create Your Account screen appears.
 
6. Fill in the Name, Short Name, Password, Verify, and Password Hint 
fields; then click Continue.
 
 This first account that you create will automatically have administrator 
privileges for this Mac. You can’t easily delete or change the name you 
choose for this account, so think it through before you click Continue.
 
 Each of these fields has an explanation below it.

426
Mac OS X Snow Leopard For Dummies 
 
 You can’t click the Continue button until you’ve filled in all five fields.
 
 The Get Internet Ready screen appears.
 
7. Select one of these four radio buttons and then click Continue:
 
• I’d Like a Free Trial Account with EarthLink
 
• I Have a Code for a Special Offer from EarthLink
 
• I’ll Use My Existing Internet Service
 
• I’m Not Ready to Connect to the Internet
 
 If you choose to use your existing Internet service, you see another series of 
screens in which you provide specific information about how you connect 
to the Internet, your IP address (if you have one), what kind of connection 
you have, and so on. If you don’t know one or more of the items in this 
series of screens, don’t worry — just leave them blank and keep clicking
the Continue button. Later, after the Setup Assistant finishes and you’re 
up and running with OS X, you can ask your ISP (Internet service provider) 
about any empty fields, get any needed information, and add information 
in the appropriate places (the Network and/or Internet System Preference 
panes) by running the Setup Assistant again.
 
 When you’ve completed this selection, the Set Up Mail screen appears.
 
8. If you want to set up the Mail program now, click the appropriate 
radio button — Use My MobileMe Account Only or Add My Existing 
Email Account. Fill in the blanks and then click Continue.
 
 The Select Time Zone screen appears.
 
9. Click your part of the world on the map, choose a city from the pop-up 
menu, and then click Continue.
 
 The Set the Date and Time screen appears.
 
10. Set today’s date and the current time, and then click Continue.
 
11. When the next screen appears, click Done.
 
 The assistant quits, and in a few moments, the Mac OS X Desktop 
appears. That’s it. You’re done.
