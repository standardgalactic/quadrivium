Preface
The concept for this book developed over three decades, as I fine-tuned my deliv-
ery of the electrical circuits course at the University of Connecticut. Having talked 
with thousands of students taking the course, I learned what they really wanted 
and needed to master the subject. They wanted a text that was comprehensive yet 
compact, ­concise, and easy to use. They needed solved examples, with a wide cross- 
section of topics, which attacked the problems from start to finish, and which explained 
the ­process in a step-by-step fashion. They needed a source that was practical in its 
description of analysis techniques, components, design, and methods of measurement.
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits represents a fresh approach that 
delivers on all counts. The printed book is compact and easy to use, yet offers a 
comprehensive description of Kirchhoff’s laws, nodal and mesh analysis, Thevenin 
and Norton’s theorems, and maximum power transfer for both DC and AC circuits, 
as well as transient analysis of first- and second-order circuits. Advanced topics such 
as mutual inductance and transformers, operational amplifier circuits, sequential 
switching, and three-phase systems reinforce the fundamentals. Approximately one 
hundred solved examples are included within the printed copy. Extra features online 
(www.routledge.com/9781032528151) include detailed solutions to over two hundred 
additional problems and 40 self-service quizzes with solutions and feedback. The 
ebook+ version includes multiple additional tools for learning, including 12 labora-
tory exercises, 39 animated presentations on the full range of topics, and 10 example 
exams with detailed solutions.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the thousands of electrical circuits 
students who inspired this project, as well as my many teaching assistants for their 
fruitful discussions and suggestions. Most of all, I would like to thank my family for 
their unending support and patience throughout this endeavor.

1 Beginning Concepts 
and Resistive Circuits
1.1  WHY CIRCUIT THEORY IS IMPORTANT
Circuit theory is an important tool for the design and analysis of electrical systems, 
which include digital systems and computers; biomedical instruments such as elec-
trocardiographs and blood glucose monitors; imaging systems such as radars, sonars, 
and ultrasound systems; sensor systems including air quality monitors, seismographs, 
and strain gauges on transportation systems; communication systems such as the 
internet, radio, television, and telephones; power systems including nuclear reactors, 
wind turbines, and photovoltaic panels; and vehicle systems including engine moni-
tors and controls, anti-lock braking and traction control systems, and self-driving 
systems. Electrical circuit theory is therefore applicable to every subfield of engi-
neering, including the electrical, computer, biomedical, civil, mechanical, automo-
tive, aerospace, and environmental engineering fields.
1.2  ASSUMPTIONS OF CIRCUIT THEORY
Circuit theory is useful for the analysis of devices, circuits, and systems provided that 
three assumptions are satisfied.
The first assumption of circuit theory is that of a lumped parameter system. 
In engineering terms, this assumption means that the wavelength λ associated with 
electrical signals is much greater than the physical size of the system, L.
	
λ >> L	
(1.1)
Electrical signals propagate at the speed of light, c, so an electrical signal with fre-
quency f  has an associated wavelength:
	
λ = c
f .	
(1.2)
For example, at the frequency of 60 Hz used for power distribution in the United States,
	
λ =

(1.3)
This is equal to 5000 km, or roughly the width of the continental United States. The 
first assumption applies for a system with a physical size much smaller than this; if 
we use “much smaller” to mean a factor of ten, this would correspond to roughly the 
width of Arizona. Clearly, the first assumption is easily satisfied at low frequencies!

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
The second assumption is that there is zero net electrical charge on each 
­component in the system. This is approximately true for all of the situations we will 
encounter, although there is one device (the capacitor) which can contain equal and 
opposite charges within.
The third assumption is that there is zero magnetic coupling between com-
ponents. Although this will generally hold for the circuits we consider, there are 
important devices which have internal magnetic coupling (the inductor and the 
transformer).
Going forward, we will assume that these three assumptions apply, so we can use 
circuit theory for our analysis, rather than resorting to the more complicated elec-
tromagnetic theory based on Maxwell’s equations. First, though, we will explore the 
physical origins of basic electrical phenomena.
1.3  CHARGES, VOLTAGES, AND CURRENTS
Electrical circuit phenomena are associated with electrical charges, which are quan-
tified in Coulombs (abbreviated C). These charges are discrete (any electrical charge 
is an integer multiple of the unit charge q, which is the absolute value of the charge 
of a single electron, where =

) and bipolar (charges may be positive 
or negative).
The physical separation of charge gives rise to electric fields (measured in volts 
per meter, or V/m) and potential differences, measured in volts (V). Figure 1.1 shows 
in a qualitative way the electric field lines and equipotential contours in two dimen-
sions for the case of a single positive charge and a single negative charge separated 
by some distance. A positive test charge will be repelled by the positive charge on 
the left and attracted by the negative charge on the right. Hence, the electric field vec-
tors (shown by arrows) point away from the positive charge and toward the negative 
FIGURE 1.1  Separation of charge gives rise to electric fields and potential differences.

charge, in the way that a positive test charge would move. At any point, the electric 
field is the negative of the gradient of the electric potential.

. This electric potential difference, usually called the potential 
difference or voltage, between these points may be related to the incremental amount of 
work done on an incremental positive test charge to move it from one point to the other:
	
=
v
dW
dq

.	
(1.5)
Therefore, if the work is measured in Joules (J) and the charge is measured in 
Coulombs (C), then the unit of potential difference, Volt (V), can be expressed in 
other units as 1 V = 1 J/C. In this example, the positive charge on the left is at a higher 
electric potential than the negative charge on the right, because net work must be 
done to move a positive test charge from right to left.
The motion of charge gives rise to electrical current. Consider a section of copper 
wire carrying an electrical current as shown in Figure 1.2. Negatively-charged elec-
trons flow from right to left, giving rise to a conventional current flowing from left to 
right. (Conventional current is defined with respect to the motion of positive charges.) 
The electrical current, measured in Amperes (A), is given by the incremental amount 
of charge dq passing through a cross section of the wire (for example, the cross sec-
tion shaded in gray) in an incremental amount of time dt:
	
=
i
dq
dt .	
(1.6)
The unit of electrical current is Ampere (A), and in terms of other units 1 A = 1 C/s.

1.4  POWER, ENERGY, AND THE PASSIVE SIGN CONVENTION
Power is the rate at which work is done:
	
=
p
dw
dt .	
(1.7)
For a two-terminal device with a potential difference across the terminals given by 
v and an electrical current equal to i flowing into the positive terminal as shown in 
Figure 1.3a, we can relate the power to the current and voltage as follows:
	
=
=
=
p
dw
dt
dw
dq
dq
dt
vi.	
(1.8)
The unit of power is Watt (W). In terms of the other units, 1 W = 1 J/s = 1 VA.
The sign of the power is important. Here, we will use the passive sign conven-
tion, so a positive value of power indicates that power is absorbed by the circuit 
element, whereas negative power indicates that power is extracted from the circuit 
element. Absorbed power could be dissipated (turned into heat) or stored in the cir-
cuit element. Extracted power is either developed (as in a source, such as a battery) or 
delivered from previously-stored energy (as from a capacitor or an inductor).
To properly use the passive sign convention, we must observe the following rule: 
if the reference direction of the current is entering the terminal with the plus sign 
for the voltage reference polarity, we calculate the power by 
=
p
iv, whereas if the 
reference direction of the current is entering the terminal with the minus sign for the 
voltage reference polarity, we should apply 
= −
p
iv. This is illustrated in Figure 1.3, 
FIGURE 1.3  (a–d) Use of the passive sign convention with assumed reference polarities for 
the voltage and current.

5
Beginning Concepts and Resistive Circuits
which shows the four possible permutations for the reference polarities. When apply-
ing this rule we must also account for the algebraic signs of the current and the volt-
age. If the actual current is flowing opposite to the reference direction, we indicate 
that by assigning the current a negative value. Likewise, if the polarity of the actual 
voltage is opposite to the reference polarity, we assign a negative value to the voltage. 
Both of these situations arise commonly, because we often set up reference polarities 
before we know the actual polarities (i.e., before we have solved the circuit). Two 
possible situations of this type are illustrated in Figure 1.4.
1.5  INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT SOURCES
Sources are two-terminal circuit elements, which supply voltage or current to a cir-
cuit. They may be independent (fixed) sources or dependent sources, which are con-
trolled by a voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit.
An independent source may supply voltage or current, so there are two types of 
independent sources as shown in Figure 1.5a and b. In our notation, an independent 
source is shown by a circle and the current source is distinguished by an arrow within 
the circle. Note that a battery can be modeled as an independent voltage source.
We will assume that these sources are ideal. Therefore, the voltage source will 
provide a fixed voltage regardless of the amount of current we draw, and the current 
source will output a fixed current regardless of the voltage we apply across its ter-
minals. Any real source has limitations, but we can nonetheless model a real source 
using an ideal source along with a resistor.
A dependent source may provide voltage or current, and it may be controlled by 
either a voltage or a current elsewhere in the circuit. This results in four types of 
dependent sources as shown in Figure 1.5c–f. These are the voltage-controlled volt-
age source (VCVS), current-controlled voltage source (CCVS), voltage-controlled 
current source (VCCS), and current-controlled current source (CCCS), respectively.
Dependent sources are important for modeling electronic devices such as transis-
tors and amplifiers. For example, the bipolar junction transistor may be modeled by a 
CCCS, whereas a field-effect transistor may be modeled by a VCCS.
In our notation, the dependent source has a diamond shape, and a current source 
is distinguished by the inclusion of an arrow within the diamond. The controlling 
variable is made clear by the equation of the dependent source, and in Figure 1.5, the 
controlling variable is referred to as ix (for a controlling current) or vx (for a control-
ling voltage). The coefficient that multiplies the controlling variable has units which 
are determined by the output and controlling variable for the source. For example,  
FIGURE 1.4  (a and b) Examples of application of the passive sign convention.

6
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
a CCVS has a coefficient µ with units of V/A, whereas a CCCS has a unitless coeffi-
cient β (units of A/A). It should be noted that the controlling variable must be labeled 
in the circuit with its polarity shown.
1.6  THE RESISTOR AND OHM’S LAW
The resistor is a two-terminal circuit element with the symbol as shown in Figure 1.6. 
It exhibits a linear relationship between voltage and current, given by Ohm’s law:
	
=
v
iR,	
(1.9)
where R is the resistance in units of Ohms, shown by the upper case Greek letter 
omega (
=
1Ω
1V/A).
Current always flows into the more positive terminal of the resistor. Therefore, 
according to the passive sign convention, the power absorbed by a resistor is always 
positive, and the resistor always dissipates power. Referring to the polarity references 
given in Figure 1.6, we can say that the voltage and current given in the figure must 
have the same algebraic sign (both positive or both negative). If we change either one 
of the polarity references, we expect the voltage and current to have opposite signs.

1.7  KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) is one of the three most important laws of circuit 
analysis (along with Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law). Kirchhoff’s laws may 
be understood using some simple circuit definitions. A node is a point in the circuit 
where two or more elements are connected. An essential node is one which is con-
nected to more than two elements. A path is a trace of elements, none repeated. 
FIGURE 1.5  Independent and dependent sources: (a) independent voltage source, (b) inde-
pendent current source, (c) VSVS, (d) CCVS, (e) VCCS, and (f) CCCS.

7
Beginning Concepts and Resistive Circuits
A branch is a path that connects two essential nodes. A loop is a path that begins and 
ends on the same node. A mesh is a loop that does not enclose another loop.
One statement of KCL is that the algebraic sum of the currents leaving a 
node is zero. By “algebraic sum,” we mean that we must account for the algebraic 
signs of the individual currents, some of which may be negative. A second, equiva-
lent statement of KCL is that the algebraic sum of the currents entering a node is 
zero. However, our convention will be to always add the currents leaving a node, and 
you are strongly encouraged to use this convention consistently in order to avoid sign 
errors.
Some examples of the use of KCL may be developed using the circuit diagram 
of Figure 1.7. For node A, there are three branches connected. Adding the currents 
leaving this node, we obtain

(1.10)
Notice that for this to be true for non-zero currents, at least one of the currents 
involved must be positive and at least one of the currents must be negative. Often 
we will arbitrarily assign the reference polarities before we know the true direc-
tions of any of the currents. This is fine as long as we use the reference polarities 
consistently after they have been chosen. Once we have solved the circuit, we will 
find the algebraic signs of the currents and thus discover the true directions of cur-
rent flow.

An important situation occurs at node E, because whereas the other nodes considered 
involve the connection of three elements, node E only joins two elements. The use of 
KCL at this node yields

This trivial application of KCL leads us to the important conclusion that two ele-
ments connected in series carry the same current. (Two elements are connected in 
series if they share a single node, and nothing else is connected to this shared node.) 
Finally, notice that for node D, we can apply KCL to obtain

This is not an independent equation, but rather may be obtained by combining the 
equations for nodes A, B, and C.
1.8  KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW
A third important circuit law is Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL). A statement of 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law is that the algebraic sum of the voltages around a loop 
is zero. By “loop,” we mean a connection of elements, none repeated, which starts 
and ends at the same point in the circuit. Our convention will be to proceed clock-
wise around a loop and add voltage drops. Operationally, this means that, when 
proceeding clockwise, we will add a voltage term if we encounter the plus sign first 
but we will subtract a voltage term if we first arrive at the negative sign. It is strongly 
recommended that you always use this convention to avoid sign errors. Note that the 
order of the terms does not matter, so we can start at any point along the loop as long 
as we end at the same point.
We can develop several applications of KVL using the example circuit of Figure 1.8. 
For the top loop, proceeding clockwise and adding voltage drops, we obtain

and for the loop on the lower right, we obtain
	
−

−
=

F
E
0.	
(1.18)
There are additional loops in the circuit, but each of these encloses at least two 
smaller loops and therefore does not yield an additional independent equation. For 
example, for the outer loop, we obtain
	
−

However, this is not a fourth independent equation. Because the outer loop encloses 
the three smaller loops considered above, its equation may be obtained by simply 
adding the three previous equations.
1.9  KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS AND THE VALIDITY 
OF CIRCUIT CONNECTIONS
One application of Kirchhoff’s laws is to determine whether a circuit connection is 
valid. To do this, we write the KVL equation for each independent loop and we write 
FIGURE 1.8  A circuit with sources and resistors for the demonstration of KVL.

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
the KCL equation for each independent node. In each case, we should consider com-
binations of the resulting equations if we are to make an exhaustive search. If neither 
of these exercises reveals a violation of one of Kirchhoff’s laws, then the circuit con-
nection is valid and may be solved.
We can illustrate this analysis using Figure 1.9. This circuit has two independent 
loops; these are the loops which do not enclose another loop, and they are also called 
meshes. There is one on the top and one on the bottom. For the top loop,
	
−

−
+
−
=
V

y

0,	
(1.20)
and this reveals no violation of KVL because there are values of Vw, Vx, and Vy which 
make this true. For the bottom loop, KVL requires
	
−

−

−
=
V

(1.21)
and here too there is no violation because there are values of Vy and Vz which can 
satisfy this equation. Neither adding nor subtracting the two equations reveals a vio-
lation of KVL.
Having exhausted the independent loops, we can consider the equation for each 
independent node. To identify independent nodes, we find all of the nodes connected 
to three or more elements, called the essential nodes. We must consider KCL for all 
but one of these essential nodes. The last essential node will not provide an indepen-
dent equation, and neither will any of the non-essential nodes connected to only two

elements. In the circuit of Figure 1.9, there are two essential nodes labeled “A” and 
“B.” Applying KCL to node A, we obtain
	
+
+
=
I
I
0.2A
0,
1
2
	
(1.22)
and this reveals no violation because there are values of I1 and I2 which make it true. 
Having eliminated every possible violation of Kirchhoff’s laws, we can say that the 
circuit of Figure 1.9 is valid and may be solved.
As another example, consider the circuit of Figure 1.10. Here, there are four 
essential nodes, labeled “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D,” and three independent loops, or 
meshes. To make an exhaustive search for a violation of Kirchhoff’s laws, we would 
write the KCL equation for three of the essential nodes, write the KVL equations 
for each of the three independent loops, and consider combinations of the equa-
tions in each case. The circuit can be considered valid only if the exhaustive search 
fails to reveal any violation of Kirchhoff’s laws, and a single violation of either of 
Kirchhoff’s laws shows that the circuit is not valid. Here, the application of KCL at 
node A yields
	
−
+
=
1.5A
1A
0.5A
0,	
(1.23)
and this is not true. The circuit is not valid, and we don’t need to explore further.

1.10  SERIES RESISTORS AND THE VOLTAGE-DIVIDER RULE
If two or more resistors are connected in series, and the total voltage across the 
combination is known, we can use the voltage-divider rule (VDR) to determine 
the individual voltages. To see this, consider the connection of two series resistors as 
shown in Figure 1.11. By KVL,

Therefore, a statement of the VDR is that: when two resistances are connected in 
series, the fraction of the total voltage appearing across one of the resistors is 
equal to the fraction of the total resistance contained in this resistor.
We can extend the VDR to three or more resistors as well, and Figure 1.12 shows 
the case of three series resistors. In this case,

1.11  PARALLEL RESISTORS AND THE CURRENT-DIVIDER RULE

as shown in Figure 1.13. KCL for the top node dictates that

In other words, the equivalent resistance for two parallel resistors is equal to the 
reciprocal of the sum of their reciprocals. In the particular case of two parallel 
resistors, we can rewrite this equation in an equivalent form:

(1.41)
For two parallel resistors, the equivalent resistance is equal to their product 
divided by their sum.
FIGURE 1.13  Two parallel resistors.

When two resistances act in parallel, we can understand how the total current 
splits between the two parallel resistors using the current-divider rule (CDR). For 
the situation shown in Figure 1.13,

A statement of the CDR is as follows: when two resistors are connected in paral-
lel, the fraction of the total current flowing through one of the resistors is equal 
to the value of the opposite resistor divided by the sum of the two resistances.
We can generalize the CDR to three or more resistors in parallel as well. Consider 
the case of four parallel resistors as shown in Figure 1.14a. To find the current, we can 
combine three of these resistors (R2, R3, and R4) in parallel as shown in Figure 1.14b. 
This yields the current-divider relation

1.12  SERIES–PARALLEL COMBINATIONS OF RESISTORS
Often a network involving a single source and a number of resistors may be simpli-
fied by combining parallel- and series-connected resistors. If the network can be 
simplified to a single source and a single resistance, it may then be solved completely 
by repeated applications of Ohm’s law, the VDR, and the CDR. An example is shown 
in Figure 1.15.

1.13  OTHER CONFIGURATIONS AND DELTA–WYE AND  
WYE–DELTA TRANSFORMATIONS
Some resistive circuits contain connections, which are neither parallel nor series. 
They may not be analyzed by simple applications of Ohm’s law, the VDR, and the 
CDR, but instead require additional tools. An example is the Wheatstone bridge 
circuit as shown in Figure 1.16. This circuit has no pair of resistors, which may be 
combined in series; this would require the pair of resistors to share a single node with 
nothing else connected to this shared node. For example, the resistors RE and RB may 
not be combined in series because of the presence of RC. The circuit also has no pair 
of resistors which may be combined in parallel; this would require that the resistors 
be connected to the same two nodes. For example, the resistors RE and RD may not be 
combined in parallel because they share only one node.
A circuit like the Wheatstone bridge may be analyzed by first using a delta-to-wye 
or a wye-to-delta transformation if this renders a transformed circuit, which may 
then be analyzed by consideration of series and parallel combinations of resistors. To 
illustrate this, we will first consider the basic delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta trans-
formations and then apply the delta-to-wye transformation to a Wheatstone bridge.
Consider three delta-connected resistors and three wye-connected resistors, 
shown in Figure 1.17 on the left and right, respectively. If the resistors RA, RB, and RC 
are known, we can find values of R1, R2, and R3 such that the delta and wye configu-
rations will be externally equivalent. (By “externally equivalent,” we mean that all 
currents and voltages outsider of the terminals A, B, and C will be unchanged if we 
FIGURE 1.16  Wheatstone bridge circuit.

replace the delta with the wye.) Similarly, if we know the values of R1, R2, and R3, we 
can find values of RA, RB, and RC such that the delta and wye configurations will be 
externally equivalent.
If the delta and wye configurations are externally equivalent, then it must be true 
that the resistance measured between any pair of terminals is the same for the delta 
and the wye. For the delta, the resistances measured between the pairs of terminals are

can find the required values of RA, RB, and RC in the equivalent delta. The solution is

1.14  SUPERPOSITION
A circuit with multiple sources can not always be solved simply by using repeated 
applications of the CDR and VDR. Usually, an additional tool must be used, and one 
such tool is the principle of superposition.
The principle of superposition states that when a linear system is driven by 
multiple independent sources, the overall response is the sum of the individual 
responses. In a circuit, the response to be found is a voltage or current. By finding the 
contributions to this voltage or current associated with each independent source, and 
summing them, we can find the value of the voltage or current in question.
To see how this works, we can consider the determination of Ix in the circuit of 
Figure 1.20. Here, there are three independent sources, so we should find the con-
tribution to Ix from each and sum these together. To determine the contribution ′Ix 
associated with the 10 V source, we disable the 2 A and 20 V sources and apply some 
combination of the CDR, VDR, and Ohm’s law. (To disable a voltage source, we set

it to zero volts or a short circuit; to disable a current source, we set it to zero amperes 
or an open circuit.) Then, we find the contribution ′′
Ix  associated with the 2 A source 
by disabling the other two sources, and finally we find the contribution ′′′
Ix  from the 
20 V source by disabling the 10 V and 2 A sources. The value of Ix is then found by 
adding the three contributions:

In principle, we may also apply superposition to a circuit with mixed (independent 
and dependent sources). In such a case, we disable all but one independent source for 
the determination of each component of current or voltage. However, we must leave 
all dependent sources active, and this process doesn’t lend itself to simple appli-
cations of the VDR and CDR. Instead, it is often better to apply the node voltage 
method, described in the next chapter.

1.15  SUMMARY
Circuit theory is important for the analysis of electrical circuits and is applicable 
to every field of engineering. The three starting assumptions of circuit theory are a 
lumped parameter system (that the wavelengths associated with electrical signals are 
much larger than the physical dimensions of the system), zero net electrical charge on 
each element, and zero magnetic coupling between elements. As long as these hold, 
we may apply circuit theory instead of resorting to the full electromagnetic theory.

Beginning Concepts and Resistive Circuits
Electrical circuit phenomena are associated with electrical charges, which are dis-
crete (in increments of the electronic charge q) and bipolar (may be positive or nega-
tive). Separation of charge gives rise to electric fields (in V/m) and electric potentials 
(in V). Motion of charge gives rise to electrical current (in A).
Power, or the rate at which work is done, may be related to the product of the 
voltage and current. Using the passive sign convention, if the current and voltage 
reference polarities for a two-terminal element are such that the current reference 
direction enters the terminal with the positive voltage reference, then 
=
p
iv, where i 
is the current and v is the voltage. If we reverse either reference polarity, so the refer-
ence direction for current is entering the terminal with the negative voltage reference, 
then 
= −
p
iv. We must take into account the algebraic signs of both the voltage and 
current as well, either may be negative. Once we find the sign of the power, a positive 
value means that the element absorbs power but a negative value means that power is 
extracted from the element.
There are independent (fixed) and dependent sources. Independent sources may 
supply voltage or current, leading to two types. Dependent sources may supply volt-
age or current and may be controlled by either a voltage or a current, leading to four 
basic types; these are the VCVS, CCVS, VCCS, and CCCS.
The three most important laws for circuit analysis are Ohm’s law, KCL, and KVL. 
The resistor is a linear element which follows Ohm’s law, which states that 
=
v
iR 
where R is the resistance in Ω.
Kirchhoff’s laws may be understood using some simple circuit definitions. A node 
is a point in the circuit where two or more elements are connected. An essential node 
is one which is connected to more than two elements. A path is a trace of elements, 
none repeated. A branch is a path that connects two essential nodes. A loop is a 
path that begins and ends on the same node. A mesh is a loop that does not enclose 
another loop.
KCL states that the sum of the branch currents leaving a node is zero. KVL states 
that the sum of the voltages around a closed path (a loop or a mesh) is zero. Our con-
vention is to proceed clockwise around such a closed path and to add voltage drops. 
(If we encounter the plus sign first, we add the voltage term.)
For resistors in series, the equivalent resistance is the sum of the individual resis-
tances. The VDR may be used to find how the total voltage across series resistances 
splits between the individual resistances. It states that the fraction of the voltage 
appearing across a resistor is equal to the fraction of total resistance in that resistor. 
For resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is the reciprocal of the sum of 
the reciprocals of the individual resistances. The CDR may be used to find how a 
total current splits among parallel resistances. It states that the fraction of total cur-
rent flowing in one parallel resistor is equal to the equivalent resistance for the other 
resistors divided by the sum of the equivalent resistance for the other resistors and the 
resistance for the branch in question.
Some configurations or resistors may not be simplified by the use of parallel 
and series combinations. These configurations generally contain wye-connected 
or delta-connected combinations of resistors, and an example is the Wheatstone 
bridge. Circuits of this type may be simplified by using delta–wye or wye–delta 
transformations.

26
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
The principle of superposition is a useful tool for solving some circuit problems. 
It states that when a linear system is driven by more than one independent source, the 
total response is the sum of the individual responses associated with each of the inde-
pendent sources. Here, the total response is a voltage or a current, and we can find it 
by summing the individual responses, each determined by leaving one independent 
source active while deactivating all others.

2 Nodal Analysis
2.1  INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
Nodal analysis, commonly called the node voltage method (NVM), is a standard 
method for solving a circuit with the minimum number of equations. To establish 
some definitions and explain the method, we will use the example circuit shown in 
Figure 2.1.
First, we will consider basic definitions. A node is a point in the circuit where two 
or more elements are joined. Our example circuit contains five nodes, indicated and 
labeled A–E in Figure 2.2. An essential node is one connected to more than two 
elements. Our circuit contains three essential nodes: B, C, and E. Nodes A and D are 
non-essential because each of them is connected to only two elements. (It is impor-
tant to note that node E is a single node, even though it is drawn with two “solder 
blobs.” This is because there is only wire between these solder blobs, and the circuit 
could be redrawn with wires coming together at a single point on the bottom if we 
tilted the 6Ω and 3Ω resistors.) A path is a trace of adjoining elements with none 
repeated. A branch is a path that connects two essential nodes.

Nodal Analysis
2.2  THE BASIC NODE VOLTAGE METHOD (NVM)
To illustrate the node voltage, we will solve the circuit in Figure 2.1. This involves 
six steps. The first step is to identify the essential nodes as shown in Figure 2.3, and 
as mentioned previously there are three in this circuit.
The second step is to choose one of the essential modes as the reference node, 
as shown in Figure 2.4. It can be any of the essential nodes, but it will simplify the 
analysis somewhat if we choose the essential node which is connected to the most 
elements. Here, we have chosen the bottom node to be the reference node, and this 
means that the other node voltages will be determined with respect to this refer-
ence node.
The third step is to number the remaining (
)
−
ne
1  nodes, where ne is the number 
of essential nodes. Here we have labeled the top two essential nodes 1 and 2 as shown 
in Figure 2.5. The node voltages V1 and V2 represent the minimum set, which we must 
determine in order to solve the circuit, and they are both measured with respect to the 
reference node as shown. For example, V1 is the voltage across the 6Ω resistor, with 
the voltage reference having the “plus” at node 1.
As a fourth step, we write (
)
−
ne
1  node voltage equations in terms of the (
)
−
ne

node voltages. (In this case, we need to solve two node voltage equations to find two 
node voltages. This is the minimum number of equations that must be solved. We 
could write additional equations involving the node voltages, but they are not inde-
pendent equations and are not needed.)
FIGURE 2.4  Choice of a reference node in the example circuit.
FIGURE 2.3  Identification of essential nodes in the example circuit.

42
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
The node equations are written by making use of Kirchhoff’s current law as 
shown in Figure 2.6. For node 1, we sum the branch currents leaving node 1 and 
set this sum to zero. Thus,

0. In a similar fashion for node 2, we write

These two node equations must be rewritten in terms of the node voltages and 
circuit quantities in order to be useful. The branch current Ia is fixed by the current 
source so 
= −
Ia
3A. Here, the minus sign applies because the reference direction 
of Ia is opposite to the direction of the current source. The second branch current 
Ib may be found by the use of Ohm’s law:

. For the determination of the 
third branch current Ic, we need to apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law and Ohm’s law with 
respect to the 4Ω resistor. The voltage across this resistor, Vx, may be determined by 
consideration of KVL: −

The next and fifth step in the process is to solve this system of equations for the node 
voltages (two equations, two unknowns). There are a number of approaches which 
may be taken, but we will illustrate one of them. For example, we can start by mul-
tiplying each equation by the least common denominator (LCD). Here, the LCD for 
each equation is 12, and multiplying by this we obtain

In each case, we take the ratio of two determinants. To find V1, the numerator is the 
determinant of the original 2 × 2 matrix modified by replacing the first column with 
the 2 × 1 matrix, and the denominator is the determinant of the original 2 × 2 matrix. 
To find V2, the numerator is the determinant of the original 2 × 2 matrix modified by 
replacing the second column with the 2 × 1 matrix, and the denominator is the deter-
minant of the original 2 × 2 matrix.
The sixth and final step in solving the circuit is to use these node voltages to find 
the remaining circuit quantities. All currents, voltages, and power values in the 
circuit may be determined once the node voltages have been found, although we 
may not need to find each of these quantities. For example, the branch current flow-
ing from top to bottom in the 6Ω resistor is

2.3  THE NODE VOLTAGE METHOD AND 
ALTERNATE NODE NUMBERING
Our choices of reference node and node numbers are arbitrary, but the circuit quanti-
ties are unique and not changed by these choices. To show this, we will reconsider the 
circuit in Figure 2.5 with different choices of reference node and node numbering as 
shown in Figure 2.7. It should be understood that VA and VB will not be equivalent to 
V1 and V2 found in the previous solution; this is because the former are defined differ-
ently than the latter. However, fundamental circuit quantities such as Ib and P4Ω are 
invariant with respect to our choices of reference node and node numbering.

It is useful to note that in the node one equation only the V1 term has a positive coef-

2.5  THE NODE VOLTAGE METHOD WITH DEPENDENT SOURCES
We can apply the NVM to circuits containing dependent sources, and this just 
requires us to express the dependent sources in terms of the node voltages. As an 
example, we will solve the circuit in Figure 2.10, which contains a voltage-controlled 
voltage source, but the same method applies in the case of other types of dependent 
sources or even multiple dependent sources.
The essential nodes in the example circuit have been identified and labeled in 
Figure 2.11.

2.6  THE NODE VOLTAGE METHOD WITH 
A KNOWN NODE VOLTAGE
When applying the NVM, special cases are introduced by voltage sources (indepen-
dent or dependent), which are connected directly between essential nodes. When a 
voltage source exists between the reference node and one of the other essential nodes, 
this gives rise to a known node voltage. Such a case will be illustrated using the 
circuit in Figure 2.12.
Suppose we label the essential nodes as shown in Figure 2.13.
With this choice of reference node, V1 is fixed by the 20V source and represents a 
known node voltage. The node two equation is written in the usual fashion, by apply-
ing KCL. Therefore, the node equations in V, mA, and kΩ are

The negative value indicates that this source is developing power.
Notice that, for this example with three essential nodes, we expected to solve two 
equations, but the presence of a special case (the known node voltage) reduced the 
system of equations to one. In general, each special case will allow us to eliminate 
one equation from the number to be solved.
FIGURE 2.14  Consideration of the power for the 20V source in the example circuit with 
a known node voltage.

53
Nodal Analysis
Also noteworthy is our choice of V, mA, and kΩ units to solve this problem. We 
could have used units of V, A, and Ω, but this would have given rise to an equivalent 
yet cumbersome node two equation:
	
−

(2.56)
Therefore, we will generally use units of V, mA, and kΩ whenever the resistances 
are all of the order of kΩ.
In the NVM, a special case can arise from any voltage source, independent or 
dependent. To show this, we will consider the circuit in Figure 2.15. Here, there 
are four essential nodes, leading to three equations. The dependent source (current-
controlled voltage source) gives rise to a known node voltage and provides an oppor-
tunity to reduce to two equations, although this is less straightforward than in the 
case of an independent source so we may opt to solve the system of three equations 
instead. In Figure 2.16, the essential nodes have been identified and labeled.

Another special case that arises in the NVM is the supernode. This refers to a voltage 
source directly between two essential nodes, neither of which is the reference node. This 
means that our choice of reference node determines whether a voltage source gives rise 
to a known node voltage or a supernode. However, sometimes a circuit will contain a 
supernode no matter where we choose to place the reference node, and it is therefore 
necessary to understand how to solve problems containing supernodes. To see this, we 
can consider the circuit in Figure 2.17. This network contains two voltage sources, which 
are connected directly between essential nodes, and it therefore gives rise to two special 
cases. If we choose the bottom node as the reference, then the 12V source gives rise to 
a known node voltage while the 6V source gives rise to a supernode. There is no place-
ment of the reference node which will avoid a supernode, and in fact placing the refer-
ence on the right-hand side of the circuit will result in two supernodes!
For our NVM analysis, we will choose the reference node and node numbers as 
shown in Figure 2.18. With this choice, there is a known node voltage at node one 
while nodes two and three form a supernode.

one supernode for any choice of reference node.

Nodal Analysis
When writing the node equations here, it is not possible to directly determine the 
branch current between nodes two and three by the use of Ohm’s law because there 
is no resistor in series with the voltage source. If we invoke this branch current and 
define it as ix, the node two and node three equations are, in units of V, A, and Ω:

These equations are not as useful as written because they invoke a new unknown (the 
current ix). However, if we add these two equations together we obtain a single equa-

This is the supernode equation, and it can be written directly by adding the branch 
currents leaving the supernode. Usually, we will do so directly, without the extra step 
of first writing the two node equations and adding them. Thus, the node equations for 
this example would be directly written, in units of V , A, and Ω, as

2.8  SUMMARY
In this chapter, we considered the NVM, which is a general-purpose tool for solving 
electrical circuits. By the NVM, we determine the voltages at the essential nodes 
(“node voltages”) with respect to a reference node, and all remaining circuit quanti-
ties may be readily found once these node voltages are known.
The basic NVM involves six steps. First, we identify all ne essential nodes (nodes 
connected to more than two elements). Second, we choose one of these to be the 
reference node. Third, we number the remaining (
)
−
ne
1  essential nodes. Fourth, we 
write (
)
−
ne
1  node equations based on Kirchhoff’s current law. In each node equa-
tion, the sum of the branch currents leaving the node is set to zero. Fifth, we solve this 
set of equations using algebraic methods. Sixth, we use the node voltages to solve for 
other circuit quantities (voltages, currents, and power values).
If one or more dependent sources appear in the circuit, the controlling variable for 
each dependent source must be expressed in terms of the node voltages.
Special cases arise in the NVM when a voltage source (independent or dependent) 
is placed between essential nodes. If a voltage source is placed between the reference 
node and one of the other essential nodes, then a known node voltage results. If a 
voltage source appears between two essential nodes, neither of which is the reference 
node, a supernode results. Therefore, the choice of reference node can affect the 
character of individual special cases.

3 Operational 
Amplifier Circuits
3.1  INTRODUCTION TO OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS
The operational amplifier (op amp) is an electronic differential amplifier with two 
inputs and one output as shown in Figure 3.1. Although a typical op amp contains 
a large number of transistors and resistors, our focus will be on the external circuit 
behavior. This external behavior may be readily understood by the use of Kirchhoff’s 
and Ohm’s laws because commercially available op amps have nearly ideal behavior 
in many respects.
The op amp is a differential amplifier and therefore amplifies the difference 
between two input voltages. Referring to Figure 3.1, the input terminal marked with 
a plus sign is the non-inverting input with the voltage vp applied, and the input ter-
minal marked with a minus sign is the inverting input with the voltage vn applied. 
The input currents ip and in flow into the non-inverting and inverting terminals, 
respectively. For a real op amp, these currents are so small that they may usually be 
neglected. The output terminal emanates from the point of the triangular symbol, 
and the voltage at this terminal is out
V . The other two terminals shown on the op amp 
are the power terminals; the positive supply is +VCC and the negative supply is −VEE. 
The power supplies must be connected to an op amp for it to function; therefore, 
these connections are always present even if they are omitted from some circuit 
diagrams for simplicity.
The voltage transfer characteristic for a typical op amp is shown in Figure 3.2. In 
the linear region of operation, the output voltage is proportional to the difference in 
the input voltages:

where A is the open-loop gain of the op amp. Typically, the open-loop gain is 
100,000 or more, so for any typical value of the output voltage the difference in

 is exceedingly small. Therefore, for linear 
operation of the op amp, we will usually assume that the two input terminals are at 
the same voltage. However, the output voltages are limited by the supply voltages: 
even for an ideal op amp, out
V  may not be more positive than +VCC or more negative 
than −VEE. This gives rise to positive saturation at +VCC and negative saturation 
at −VEE. It is important to realize that the open-loop gain does not apply in either 
case of saturation, so it is no longer true that the input voltages are approximately 
equal.
3.2  ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
For the analysis of op amp circuits, we usually assume that the op amps exhibit ideal 
behavior and apply three concepts: the assumption of infinite input impedance (I3), 
the virtual short (VS), and a check for saturation.
The assumption of infinite input impedance causes us to consider that the 
currents flowing in the inputs of the op amp (both the non-inverting and invert-
ing terminals) are zero. Because the real input currents are typically on the order of 
nA, it is reasonable to neglect them as long as the resistances in the circuit are ≤1MΩ, 
resulting in circuit branch currents ≥µ
1 A. The concept of infinite input impedance 
applies to linear or saturated operations.
The concept of the virtual short applies to linear operation only, for which the 
open-loop gain is operational. The large open-loop gain A of the op amp ensures that 
the difference in the input voltages, (

, is very small (on the order of 
µV). Therefore, we will assume that there is a “virtual short” between the inputs

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
and that

n, for linear operation. It is a “virtual” short because no current can 
flow directly between the input nodes even though they are maintained at the same 
electric potential. A special case of the virtual short is the “virtual ground”; this 
refers to the situation in which one input terminal is grounded and a virtual ground 
exists at the other input terminal.
When analyzing an op amp circuit, we always start by assuming linear oper-
ation, but we must then check for saturation. Using the linear assumption, we 
make a tentative calculation of the output voltage. If the tentative output voltage is 
outside of the range of the supply voltages, we conclude that the op amp is saturated. 
Specifically, if the tentative output voltage is more positive than +VCC, we infer posi-
tive saturation and set the output voltage to +VCC. Likewise, if the tentative output 
voltage is more negative than −VEE, we infer negative saturation and set the output 
voltage to −VEE. In the case of saturation, the virtual short does not apply, so we 
must reconsider the value of the voltage at the inverting input. We should also recon-
sider any other quantities that were based on the tentative output voltage, including 
currents.
To illustrate the use of these three concepts (the infinite input impedance, virtual 
short, and saturation check), we will consider the op amp circuit in Figure 3.3.
We start by assuming linear operation so we can find the tentative output voltage. 
The non-inverting input is connected to the ground so

It is important to note that, although the currents flowing in the inputs of the op amp 
are zero (infinite input impedance), the output current is generally not zero.
Another important point involves the orientation of the non-inverting and 
inverting input terminals. It is tempting to think that the op amp will behave in a 
similar fashion, though with a change in the sign of the output voltage, if we inter-
change the non-inverting and inverting terminals in this circuit. This is not true, 
however, because although we have made the assumption of the virtual short, there 
is actually an infinitesimally small difference between the input voltages, and this 
is amplified to create the output voltage. The resistor connected between the output 
and the inverting input terminal provides negative feedback, which stabilizes the 
output voltage. If we instead connect a feedback resistor between the output and 
the non-inverting input, positive feedback results, and the output will be driven to 
saturation. As such the feedback resistor must always be connected between the 
output and the inverting terminal to provide negative feedback and stabilize 
the output.
3.3  ANALYSIS OF A SATURATED OPERATIONAL 
AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT
The three concepts introduced in the previous section may be used to analyze any 
op amp circuit, including one in which the op amp is saturated. As in the previous 
example, we will start by assuming linear operation in order to find a tentative output 
voltage. If this tentative output voltage is outside the range of the supply voltages, we 

74

will adjust it accordingly and revisit the voltage at the inverting input. To illustrate 
this process, we will use the circuit in Figure 3.4.
We start by assuming linear operation so we can find the tentative output volt-
age. The voltage at the non-inverting input is determined by the independent voltage 
source:

3.4  ANALYSIS OF A CIRCUIT INVOLVING MULTIPLE OP AMPS
We may analyze circuits containing multiple op amps using the three concepts 
of the infinite input impedance, virtual short, and saturation check. However, we 
must start the analysis upstream and work our way downstream. To show this, we 
will consider the circuit in Figure 3.5, which contains three op amps. Op amps 
OA1 and OA2 provide the inputs to OA3; therefore, we must analyze OA1 and 
OA2 before OA3.
We will start by analyzing OA1 with the assumption of linear operation. The non-
inverting input is grounded, so assuming a virtual short exists between the inputs we 
find the tentative voltage at the inverting input:
	
′= 0.

Thus, we have solved for the voltages surrounding OA1. We are not ready to find the

V , which is not yet known, and we will save the 
calculation of currents for last.
For OA2, we begin by assuming linear operation. Making use of the virtual short,

at the non-inverting input:

This same general process may be used to analyze any circuit involving multiple op 
amps with cascading involved.
3.5  INVERTING AMPLIFIER
The three general principles applied to op amp analysis allow us to design op amp 
circuits as well. As an example, we will consider the inverting amplifier, which is a 
general-purpose building block for op amp design. The inverting amplifier has the 
layout shown in Figure 3.6. The non-inverting terminal is grounded. An input voltage 
is connected to the inverting input through an input resistor R1 and there is a feedback 
resistor RF.

sinusoidal signals. This gain can be set by the ratio of two resistors. Moreover, vari-
able gain may be achieved by making one of the resistors adjustable.
3.6  NON-INVERTING AMPLIFIER
Another general-purpose building block for op amp design is the non-inverting 
amplifier shown in Figure 3.7. An input voltage is connected directly to the non-
inverting input. There is a resistor R1 connected between the inverting input and 
ground, and there is a feedback resistor RF.

1 . The positive gain indi-
cates non-inverting operation. For sinusoidal signals, this means the output voltage 
will be in phase with the input voltage. Also, it should be noted that the minimum 
absolute value of gain is unity, occurring in the limit as R

. In this limit, 
with RF replaced by a wire and R1 replaced by an open circuit, we obtain a practi-
cal circuit which is a unity-gain buffer. This circuit, shown in Figure 3.8, allows us 
to reproduce a voltage from a source node to a target node without drawing current 
from the source node. For this reason, it is called a “buffer amplifier” or a “unity-gain 
buffer.”
3.7  SUMMING AMPLIFIER
A summing amplifier allows us to scale and add two or more voltage signals. A two-
input summing amplifier is illustrated in Figure 3.9. Each input voltage is applied to 
the inverting input terminal through a resistor. The non-inverting input is grounded 
and there is a feedback resistor RF.
If we assume linear operation, the virtual short fixes the voltage at the inverting 
input:

The input signals have voltage gain values which may be designed independently, 
because although RF is common to both ratios, R1 and R2 may be chosen indepen-
dently. Both terms are negative, indicating inverting behavior. The summing ampli-
fier may be scaled up to three or more inputs by simply connecting additional input 
resistors to the inverting input.
3.8  DIFFERENCE AMPLIFIER
A difference amplifier produces the difference in two scaled voltage signals and is 
shown in Figure 3.10.

Such a design may be achieved by combining inverting, non-inverting, summing, and 
difference amplifiers, so the gain coefficients may be positive or negative and may be 
fixed by ratios of resistors. It is even possible to make some or all of the gain coef-
ficients adjustable, by introducing potentiometers as variable resistances or variable 
voltage dividers.
A potentiometer is a three-terminal device as shown in Figure 3.11. There is a fixed 
resistance RP between terminals a and c; there is a third terminal b (the wiper), which 
can be physically moved from one end of the resistance to the other by pushing a 
slider or rotating a knob. The position of the wiper can be expressed by the parameter 
x, where 
x
≤
≤
0
1. A value of x = 0 corresponds to a wiper position at one end (for 
example, at c) while a value of x = 1 corresponds to a wiper position at the other end 
(point a). The resistance between terminals b and c is given by xRP, while the resis-
tance between a and b is given by 
x RP
(
)
−
1
. A potentiometer can be used as a simple 
variable resistance by tying the wiper (terminal b) to either of the other terminals.
A variable-gain inverting amplifier can be constructed by using a potentiometer 
as a variable feedback resistor as shown in Figure 3.12. For this circuit, the voltage 
gain is

where 
x
≤
≤

1, so the gain may be adjusted all the way to zero. As a matter of good 
practice, op amp circuits use resistances between 1kΩ and 1MΩ, because smaller 
resistances result in excessive current loading and larger resistances result in designs 
which are noisy and contain voltage offsets. Thus, if a 10 kΩ potentiometer is used 
for the feedback resistor, the maximum absolute value of voltage gain will be 10, cor-
responding to R = 1kΩ
1
.
If a non-zero minimum gain (minimum absolute value) is desired in a variable-
gain inverting amplifier, this can be achieved by placing a fixed resistor in series with 
the variable resistance as shown in Figure 3.13. The voltage gain is

. To combine the signals, we 
will need a three-input summing amplifier. The summing amplifier is inherently 
inverting, so this will provide the minus signs for the V1 and V2 terms. For the V1 
channel, we can use a simple input resistor to the summing amplifier. For the V2 
channel, we can use a potentiometer as a variable voltage divider and feed this to an 
input resistor to the summing amplifier. For the V3 channel, we can use a variable-
gain inverting amplifier with non-zero minimum gain. The cascade of two inverting 
amplifiers will produce a positive coefficient for V3. Combining these ideas, we arrive 
at a design layout as shown in Figure 3.17.

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
Next, we need to choose the resistor values, keeping all resistors in the prac-
tical range of 
−
1kΩ
1MΩ. We will assume that we are using 5% resistors with 
standard values, and we will use potentiometers from the set of most common 
values (1kΩ, 5kΩ, 10 kΩ, 20 kΩ, 50 kΩ, and 100 kΩ). We will first choose the feed-
back resistor to be RF = 100 kΩ. Now to achieve a gain of 2.0 for the V1 channel 
we can choose

mize loading, so we will choose RP = 1kΩ
2
. (A small amount of loading here will 
affect the linearity of the gain adjustment but will not impact the minimum or maxi-
mum values of gain.) For the V3 channel, we will choose R3 such that the maximum 
required gain is achieved in the summing stage:

3.10  NON-IDEAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OP AMPS
So far we have assumed ideal op amp behavior. This simplifies the analysis and 
design of op amp circuits, and it is also appropriate for most purposes given that 
practical op amps approximate ideal ones in many ways. However, it is important 
to be aware of non-ideal op amp behavior when designing for high precision or high 
frequencies.
FIGURE 3.18  Completed example design.

90
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
We would not expect an op amp to respond to arbitrarily high frequencies. A real 
op amp has a gain-bandwidth (GBW) product, which limits its response at higher 
frequencies. If the op amp is configured in a circuit with a voltage gain of AV, the 
expected upper cutoff frequency is
	
f
A
c
V
= GBW .	
(3.70)
For example, if we use an op amp with 
=
GBW
10 MHz to build a circuit with a volt-
age gain of AV = 100, we expect the upper cutoff frequency to be fc = 100 kHz.
For switching applications, in which the op amp output is supposed to take on a 
rectangular waveform, another limitation comes into play, and this is the slew rate s. 
The rise and fall time for a rectangular wave output are equal to the peak-to-peak 
output amplitude divided by the slew rate:
	
t
t
V
s
R
F
PP
=
,
.	
(3.71)
For example, with a peak-to-peak output amplitude of VPP = 10V and slew rate 
s =
µ
0.5V/ s, the rise time will be tR =
µ
20 s.
There are several non-ideal op amp characteristics, which affect DC operation as 
well. These include the input bias current, input offset current, input offset voltage, 
open-loop gain, input resistance, and output resistance. These are shown in the op 
amp model of Figure 3.19. The input bias current IB is the average current, which 
flows into each input terminal of the op amp with zero voltage difference applied.

When a voltage difference is applied between the input terminals, there is another 
current proportional to this voltage difference because of the presence of a finite 
input resistance Ri. The output voltage of the op amp is not exactly zero when 
there is a zero voltage difference between the input terminals. The input voltage 
that must be applied to make the output voltage zero is called the input offset 
voltage VIO. The open-loop gain of a real op amp is not infinite but takes on a 
very large number. Finally, there is a finite output resistance Ro. Table 3.1 sum-
marizes some ideal characteristics and compares them to typical values for an 
LM741 op amp.
To see how these non-ideal characteristics could affect circuit performance, we 
can consider a prototypical inverting amplifier with an expected voltage gain of −2.0 
as shown in Figure 3.20. If we assume ideal behavior then i

, RF = 2kΩ, RL = 1kΩ, and with the typical 
parameters given in Table 3.1, we obtain vn = −0.000789V and V
= −2.0023V
out
. 
These values are both within a millivolt of the values obtained using the ideal op 
amp model. This is consistent with the fact that the ideal op amp model will almost 
always provide adequate accuracy, unless we desire high voltage precision and use 
precision resistors with tight tolerances.
3.11  SUMMARY
An operational amplifier (op amp) is a high-gain electronic differential amplifier 
having two inputs and a single output. One of the inputs is called the inverting 
input and is marked by a minus sign; the other input is the non-inverting input and 
is marked by a plus sign. The voltages at the inverting and non-inverting inputs are 
called vn and vp, respectively. For linear operation, the output voltage is equal to the 
difference of the input voltages multiplied by the open-loop gain for the amplifier: 
V
A v
v
p
n
(
)
=
−
OUT
, where A is the open-loop gain and typically has a very high 
value of 
−
10
10

6. The output voltage of the op amp is limited to be in the range 
of the power supply voltages. For an ideal op amp, the output will exhibit positive 
saturation limited by the positive supply [V
VCC
(
) = +
maximum
 
OUT
] and negative 
saturation limited by the negative supply [V
VEE
(
) = −
minimum
 
OUT
]. To achieve use-
ful values of voltage gain which are much less than the open-loop gain, negative 
feedback is employed by connecting a resistor between the output and the inverting 
input of the op amp.
Analysis of an arbitrary op amp circuit can be done by standard circuit analysis 
techniques with the use of three concepts specific to op amps. These are the vir-
tual short, infinite input impedance, and the check for saturation. The virtual 
short applies to linear operation only; this requires us to start our analysis by first 
assuming linear operation so that v
v
p
n
=
 because of the high open-loop gain; by so 
doing we can find a tentative value of the voltage at the inverting terminal (vn′). The 
infinite input impedance leads us to assume that the currents flowing into the two 
input terminals are both zero. This applies to linear and saturation operation. After 
starting by assuming linear operation, we calculate the tentative output voltage  
(V′OUT). If this tentative output voltage is in the range of the supply voltages, then the 
actual output voltage will be equal to the tentative value. If not, then the output will 
saturate at the supply voltage having the same sign as the tentative output voltage. 
If the output voltage is saturated, we must reconsider the value of vn and any other 
circuit quantities which are affected by VOUT. When analyzing a circuit that involves 
multiple op amps, some of which feed downstream to others, we must first analyze 
the upstream op amps.

95
Operational Amplifier Circuits
Design of op amp circuits can be done to provide scaled sums or differences of 
multiple inputs. The scale factors (gain coefficients) are set by ratios of resistors and 
may be adjustable if potentiometers are used to achieve variable resistances or vari-
able voltage dividers. Important building blocks for design of op amp circuits include 
the inverting amplifier, the non-inverting amplifier, the summing amplifier, and the 
difference amplifier.

4 Mesh Analysis
4.1  INTRODUCTION AND BASIC DEFINITIONS
The mesh current method (MCM), also known as mesh analysis, is an important 
circuit analysis technique, which complements the node voltage method (NVM). 
Like the NVM, it is intended to allow the solution of a circuit with the minimum 
number of equations. However, some circuits lend themselves to easier analysis 
with the MCM; this is especially true for circuits containing transformers. On 
the other hand, some circuits especially those involving op amps are more easily 
analyzed by the NVM. It is therefore important to master both NVM and MCM. 
In many cases, you may want to first consider both methods before settling on one 
over the other.
To describe the MCM, it is necessary to first give some basic definitions. A path 
is a trace of adjoining elements with none repeated. A loop is a path that begins and 
ends at the same point. A mesh is a loop that does not enclose another loop. The 
circuit in Figure 4.1 contains three meshes: these are ABED, BCFE, and DEFHG. 
The loop ABCFED is not a mesh because it encloses the loops ABED and BCFE. 
The outer loop ABCFHGD is not a mesh because it encloses ABED, BCFE, and 
DEFHG.

Mesh Analysis
4.2  APPLICABILITY OF THE MESH CURRENT METHOD
The MCM is applicable only to planar circuits. A planar circuit is one which may 
be drawn on a flat piece of paper without the use of crossovers. In the case of a non-
planar circuit, we are unable to define mesh currents without ambiguities or contra-
dictions, and therefore the NVM must be used for non-planar circuits.
The circuit shown in Figure 4.2 is non-planar because it cannot be drawn without 
crossovers. Therefore, the MCM is not applicable to this circuit, and we would need 
to use the NVM instead.
The circuit shown in Figure  4.3 initially appears to be non-planar, because it 
includes two crossovers. However, it may be redrawn without the use of crossovers 
as shown in Figure 4.4, and therefore, we could analyze this circuit using the MCM. 
(This circuit includes five meshes.)
4.3  THE BASIC MESH CURRENT METHOD (MCM)
To illustrate the basic MCM, we will use the circuit in Figure 4.5 as an example. 
There are five steps in the MCM. First, we identify the meshes; the example circuit 
has two.
The second step is to label and number the mesh currents as shown in Figure 4.6. 
As a matter of convention, we define all mesh currents to flow clockwise. Although 
it is possible to define counterclockwise mesh currents or even mix clockwise and 
counterclockwise currents, it is strongly recommended that you adhere to the clock-
wise convention in order to avoid sign errors. The numbering is arbitrary and may be 
chosen for convenience; the basic quantities in the circuit are invariant with respect 
to our chosen numbering of the mesh currents.

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
The third step is to write an equation for each mesh using Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
(KVL). Each mesh equation is developed by moving clockwise around the mesh and 
adding the voltage drops. This means that, when moving clockwise, we add a term if 
we arrive at the plus sign first but subtract the term if we arrive at the minus sign first. 
With reference to Figure 4.7, the two mesh equations are therefore (with numerical 
quantities in units of V)

The mesh equations are not too useful in this form, because we have six unknowns but 
only two equations. We therefore must express the individual voltage drops in terms of 
the mesh currents. This requires us to relate branch currents to the mesh currents and 
use these to find the voltage drops around each mesh. Referring to Figure 4.7, it can 
be seen that the mesh current I1 flows clockwise in the 3Ω resistor, the 5V source, and 
the 2Ω resistor. However, the 5Ω resistor is common to both meshes and the current

current law (KCL) at the bottom node.) Using Ohm’s law, with units of V, A, and Ω, 
we can find the voltage drops in mesh one to be V

Similarly, the voltage drops in mesh two are V

It should be noted that in the M1 equation the I1 coefficient is positive but the I2 coef-
ficient is negative. The opposite is true in the M2 equation. In general, when writing 
the nth mesh equation, the coefficient for the nth mesh current will be positive while 
all others will be negative, and this is sometimes helpful when checking for sign 
errors. The exception to this rule occurs when the circuit contains dependent sources.

4.4  THE MESH CURRENT METHOD WITH 
MORE THAN TWO MESHES
The MCM may be readily extended to more than two meshes. When solving a circuit 
with nm meshes, we will have nm mesh equations to solve for nm mesh currents (unless 
there are special cases, to be described in the next two sections). To illustrate this, we 
will solve the circuit in Figure 4.8, which contains four meshes.
We will use the mesh numbering scheme shown in Figure 4.9. (We could use a 
different choice of mesh numbers if we prefer. This would change the definition of 
the mesh currents and therefore the values of I1, I2, I3, and I4, but it would not change 
basic circuit quantities such as IX.)

Multiplication by −1 was necessary in the power calculations for the 10  and 20V 
sources according to the passive sign convention, because in both cases the reference 
direction for the electrical current was entering the negative terminal for the voltage 
source. All three power values are negative, indicating that all three voltage sources 
are developing power.

4.5  THE MESH CURRENT METHOD WITH 
A KNOWN MESH CURRENT
In the MCM, special cases arise whenever there is a current source (independent or 
dependent) in the circuit. If the current source appears on the periphery of the circuit, 
and only in one mesh, it gives rise to a known mesh current (KMC). If the current 

123
Mesh Analysis
source is on the interior of the circuit, and shared by two meshes, it gives rise to a 
supermesh. (The supermesh will be described in more detail in the next section.)
An example of a circuit with a KMC is shown in Figure 4.10. Here, there are three 
meshes, and we would generally expect to set up and solve three mesh equations. 
However, the presence of a special case allows us to reduce the system to two equa-
tions. In general, if there are nm meshes and ns special cases, the system will reduce 
to n

)

 equations.
We will use the mesh numbering scheme shown in Figure 4.11. Here, there is a 
current source in mesh one, so I1 is a KMC: I = −1A
1
. The minus sign results from 
the fact that the direction for the current source (counterclockwise) is opposite to the 
FIGURE 4.10  A circuit having a KMC.

124

can be written in the normal fashion, using KVL. Therefore, the three mesh equa-
tions with units of V, A, and Ω are

4.6  THE MESH CURRENT METHOD WITH A SUPERMESH
Another special case in the MCM is the supermesh; this is introduced by a current 
source (independent or dependent) which is on the interior of the circuit, and shared 
by two meshes. An example is shown in Figure 4.12.
If we use the mesh numbering shown in Figure 4.13, then meshes two and three 
together constitute a supermesh. If we attempt to write mesh equations for each of the 
individual meshes, we have to invoke a new variable vx, which represents the voltage 
drop across the current source in the supermesh. In units of V, A, and Ω,

As it stands, the previous set of equations may not be solved because there are four 
unknowns but only three equations. It is therefore more useful to write a single equa-
tion for the supermesh. This could be found by adding the M2 and M3 equations, but 

126

usually we will write the supermesh equation directly by use of KVL. Therefore, the

4.7  THE DOUBLE SUPERMESH
As another example, consider the case of the double supermesh shown in Figure 4.14. 
The meshes are labeled in Figure 4.15, and we see that mesh two contains two cur-
rent sources, each shared by an adjacent mesh. Therefore, meshes one, two, and three 
together constitute a double supermesh.
In units of V, A, and Ω, the double supermesh equation is

In addition to this, we need to write the equation for each of the two current sources.

Of course, it would be possible to have triple supermeshes, quadruple supermeshes, 
and so on, but we do not expect higher-order supermeshes to be common in practical 
circuits.
4.8  A SUPERMESH CONTAINING A KNOWN MESH CURRENT
In the previous section, we illustrated one combination of two special cases in the 
MCM: it was the combination of two supermeshes into a double supermesh. Here, we 
consider a second possibility of combining two special cases, which is a supermesh 
containing a KMC. Such a situation is shown in Figure 4.16, and with the meshes 
labeled in Figure 4.17.
The right-hand current source is on the periphery and within a single mesh so it 
gives rise to a KMC: I = −25mA
3
. The 10mA current source is shared by meshes 
two and three and therefore creates a supermesh. We will not write the supermesh 
equation in this case, because to do so we would need to invoke a new unknown vari-
able to represent the voltage across the 25mA current source. However, because I3

is known we can use the equation of the 10mA current source to find I2. The set of

4.9  THE MESH CURRENT METHOD WITH A DEPENDENT SOURCE
When a dependent source appears in a circuit, the value of the controlling variable 
(and therefore the value of the source) must be expressed in terms of the mesh cur-
rents. If the dependent source is a current source, it will give rise to a special case –  
either a KMC or a supermesh. To illustrate these ideas, we can consider the circuit 
in Figure 4.18, which contains a current-controlled voltage source. The meshes are 
labeled in Figure 4.19.
This circuit has three meshes and no special cases, so we will solve a system of 
three mesh equations. In units of V, A, and Ω,

As another example, consider the circuit in Figure 4.20. Here, the dependent source 
is a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS), and it gives rise to a special case 
because it is a current source.
We will use the mesh numbering shown in Figure 4.21. There are three meshes. 
The dependent source is a current source shared by two meshes so it gives rise to a 
supermesh.

4.10  CHOOSING BETWEEN THE MCM AND THE NVM
Before solving a problem, we will generally consider both the MCM and the NVM 
to determine which method will require fewer equations. A solution using fewer 
equations is not only more efficient but also less prone to errors. To illustrate 
this, we will consider several example circuits, starting with the one shown in 
Figure 4.22.
This circuit has six meshes, as indicated in Figure 4.23. There is a single special 
case; the current source in mesh two gives rise to a KMC. Therefore, the number of 
equations that must be solved in the MCM reduces to n

, where nm 
is the number of meshes and nsm is the number of special cases for the MCM.
FIGURE 4.22  A circuit with six meshes and six essential nodes.
FIGURE 4.23  A circuit with six meshes and six essential nodes, with the meshes labeled.

137
Mesh Analysis
This circuit also has six essential nodes, as shown in Figure 4.24, but there are four 
voltage sources resulting in four special cases for the NVM. If we make the bottom 
node the reference node, then we have known node voltages at node three and node 
five. Nodes one and three together constitute a supernode, but this involves a known 
node voltage so the voltage at node one can be determined immediately. Nodes two 
and four together constitute another supernode. Accounting for these special cases, 
the number of equations that must be solved when using the NVM will reduce to

sn
, where ne is the number of essential nodes and nsn is the 
number of special cases for the NVM. Therefore, we would clearly choose the NVM, 
requiring one equation, over the MCM, requiring five equations, for this circuit.
Now consider the circuit of Figure 4.25.
This circuit has six meshes, as indicated in Figure 4.26. There are two special 
cases: meshes one and two make up a supermesh while mesh six has a KMC. The 
number of equations that must be solved in the MCM reduces to n

This circuit has only three essential nodes, as indicated in Figure 4.27. There 
are no special cases for the NVM because none of the voltage sources is connected 
directly between essential nodes. (There is a series resistor involved in each case.) 
Hence, the number of equations to be solved is n

. Once again, 
we would choose the NVM as the more efficient approach.
As a third example consider the circuit in Figure 4.28. This circuit is non-planar 
and cannot be solved using the MCM. Hence, we need to use the NVM. In this case, 
there are 16 essential nodes, with one supernode involving nodes two and three, so 
we will need to solve 14 equations (Figure 4.29).
By now you may feel that we will never use the MCM. This is not true; although 
we tend to use the NVM more often, we will not use it exclusively. For example, 
FIGURE 4.24  A circuit with six meshes and six essential nodes, with the essential nodes 
labeled.

138
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
consider the circuit in Figure 4.30. This circuit contains five meshes, as labeled in 
Figure 4.31. There are four special cases introduced by four current sources, so we 
would need to solve one equation when using the MCM. There are seven essential 
nodes, as indicated in Figure 4.32, but no special cases for the NVM. Therefore, we 
would have to solve six equations when using the NVM. Clearly, the MCM is the 
better choice here. In Chapter 8, we will see that the MCM is the best approach for 
transformer circuits. Therefore, although we will use the NVM more often, it is nec-
essary to be fluent with both the NVM and the MCM.

4.11  SUMMARY
The MCM is a general-purpose tool for solving planar circuits. (It is not appli-
cable to non-planar circuits, which cannot be drawn on a flat piece of paper without 
the use of crossovers.) There are five steps in the basic MCM. First, we identify 
the meshes in the circuit. A mesh is a loop that does not enclose any other loops. 
Second, we label and number the meshes. As a convention, we define each mesh 
current as flowing clockwise around its mesh. Third, we write an equation for each 
mesh using KVL. As a convention, we travel clockwise around the mesh and add

the voltage drops. While doing this we must recognize that a branch shared by two 
meshes carries the difference in the individual mesh currents. Fourth, we solve the 
system of mesh equations using algebraic methods. Fifth, we use the mesh currents 
to determine all other circuit quantities as needed.
Special cases are introduced by the presence of current sources, either inde-
pendent or dependent. A current source on the periphery of the circuit, which is 
contained in a single mesh, gives rise to a KMC. A current source on the interior 
of a circuit, shared by two meshes, gives rise to a supermesh. Each special case 
can be used to reduce the number of equations which must be solved by one. 
Therefore, the number of equations that must be solved is equal to n
n
m −
sm, where 
nm is the number of meshes and nsm is the number of special cases (current sources) 
for the MCM.
FIGURE 4.31  A circuit with five meshes and seven essential nodes labeled for implementa-
tion of the MCM.

142
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
When using the MCM to solve a circuit containing a dependent source, we must 
express the value of the controlling variable, and therefore the dependent source, 
in terms of the mesh currents. If the dependent source is a current source, either 
a VCCS or a current-controlled current source, it will result in a special case as 
described in the previous paragraph.
Before solving a circuit, we should first evaluate the applicability and complex-
ity (number of equations required) for the NVM and the MCM. Only the NVM is 
applicable to non-planar circuits, but the MCM is strongly preferred for transformer 
circuits, as we will see in Chapter 8. If either method is applicable, we will choose 
the method that results in fewer equations.

5 Thevenin’s and 
Norton’s Theorems
5.1  THEVENIN’S THEOREM
Thevenin’s theorem is a useful tool for solving certain types of problems. It states 
that for any two-terminal network involving resistors and sources, there is a Thevenin 
equivalent network involving a single voltage source VTh and a single resistance RTh, as 
shown in Figure 5.1. The Thevenin circuit is externally equivalent to the original cir-
cuit, in the sense that if we connect additional circuitry to the two terminals a and b, the 
voltages and currents in this external circuitry will be the same for the Thevenin equiv-
alent as the original circuit, regardless of the complexity of the original circuit. They 
are not internally equivalent, however. This means that we cannot use the Thevenin 
equivalent circuit to directly find voltages and currents inside the original circuit.
Because the Thevenin circuit is externally equivalent to the original circuit, we 
can analyze the behavior with simple external connections to find VTh and RTh. One 
such connection involves a short circuit as shown in Figure 5.2. If we place a wire 
directly between the terminals a and b to create a short circuit, the same current

V

be equal to the short-circuit current for the Thevenin equivalent:

(5.1)
Another simple external condition of importance is the open-circuit condition shown 
in Figure 5.3. The open-circuit voltage for the Thevenin equivalent is VTh, and if the 
two circuits are externally equivalent, the open-circuit voltage for the original circuit 
on the left should be equal to the open-circuit voltage for the Thevenin equivalent:
	
=
V
V .
OC
Th 	
(5.2)
If the original circuit contains at least one independent source, then its ­open-circuit 
voltage and short-circuit current will both be nonzero so we may determine the 
Thevenin resistance from their ratio:
	
=
R
V
I
/
Th
OC
SC	
(5.3)
Occasionally, the original circuit may contain no independent sources, either because 
it contains only resistors or because the sources within it are all dependent sources. If 
this is the case, both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current will be zero 
and we may not use their ratio to find the Thevenin resistance. Instead, we can apply 
a test source as shown in Figure 5.4. It should be noted that we can use either a volt-
age test source or a current test source, in case one is more convenient than the other. 
In Figure 5.4, we show the application of a voltage test source of value VTest, and the 
resulting current ITest is to be determined. We could also apply a current test source 
of value ITest, and then find the resulting voltage VTest. Either way, simple application 
of KVL and Ohm’s law reveals that

Thevenin’s and Norton’s Theorems
In the following sections, we will make use of these concepts to determine the 
Thevenin equivalent circuit for several two-terminal networks.
5.2  THEVENIN EQUIVALENT FOR A CIRCUIT 
WITH ONLY INDEPENDENT SOURCES
For a two-terminal circuit with only independent sources and resistors, we may use 
a combination of the open-circuit analysis and the short-circuit analysis to determine 
the Thevenin equivalent circuit. It turns out there is a third analysis, the resistance 
shortcut analysis, which may also be used to determine the Thevenin resistance. In 
light of this, we may use the combination of any two of the open-circuit analy-
sis, the short-circuit analysis, and the resistance shortcut analysis to find the 
Thevenin equivalent. To illustrate this, we will find the Thevenin equivalent with 
respect to the terminals a and b for the circuit in Figure 5.5.
We will start by doing the open-circuit analysis by the node voltage method as 
shown in Figure 5.6.

node (node three is combined with the reference node).

It is important to note that the value of V2 under short-circuit conditions is not the

voltages, we can use Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) to find the short-circuit current.

In a circuit with only independent sources and resistors, we can also use the resis-
tance shortcut analysis to find the Thevenin resistance. To apply the resistance short-
cut, we disable all of the independent sources and find the equivalent resistance for the 
remaining network with respect to the terminals a and b. When we disable a voltage 
source we set it to zero volts, which corresponds to a short circuit. To disable a current 
source, we set it to zero amperes, which is an open circuit. Disabling the independent 
sources in the circuit of Figure 5.5 results in the circuit of Figure 5.8. The 2Ω resistor 
has no effect on the Thevenin resistance because it is disconnected from the rest of the 
circuit on the left-hand side, and no current can flow in it. The Thevenin resistance is 
the equivalent resistance seen looking into the terminals a and b; it is

This result was already obtained by combining the open-circuit and short-circuit 
analyses. We could choose to do any two of the three analyses and obtain the 
Thevenin equivalent circuit. If we do all three, we can check the results for consis-
tency and this may help to find small errors.

5.3  THEVENIN EQUIVALENT FOR A CIRCUIT 
WITH MIXED SOURCES
If a two-terminal network contains mixed dependent and independent sources, as 
well as resistors, we may still use the open-circuit and short-circuit analyses. The 
resistance shortcut is not applicable, but we can use a test-source analysis. We will 
make these points using the circuit in Figure 5.9.
We will start by doing the open-circuit analysis by the node voltage method as 
shown in Figure 5.10.

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
Once again it is important to note that the node voltages under short-circuit condi-
tions are generally different from the node voltages under open-circuit conditions. 
The short-circuit current may be found by using KCL with the short-circuit node 
voltages. Referring to Figure 5.11, we see that this is a somewhat unusual use of KCL 
because the short-circuit current flows between two points on the same essential 
node.

The resistance shortcut is not applicable to circuits containing mixed independent 
and dependent sources. This is because dependent sources contribute to the Thevenin 
resistance, so disabling them alters the apparent Thevenin resistance. To see this, con-
sider the circuit of Figure 5.9 with all sources disabled (voltage sources replaced by 
shorts and current sources replaced by opens). The resulting circuit appears in Figure 
5.12, and the equivalent resistance with respect to the nodes a and b is

Therefore, we cannot use the resistance shortcut in a network containing dependent 
sources.
FIGURE 5.12  A two-terminal network containing mixed (independent and dependent) 
sources and resistors, after the sources have all been disabled to show that the resistance 
shortcut is not valid in the case of mixed sources.

167
Thevenin’s and Norton’s Theorems
On the other hand, we can use a test-source analysis for a network containing 
mixed sources. For this analysis, we disable only the independent sources and apply a 
test source to the terminals a and b. The test source may be a current source or a volt-
age source – and sometimes one may be more convenient than the other. Also, the 
test source can take a specific value (1V, for example) or it can have an abstract value 
(such as VTest). We will use a test source with the unspecified value of VTest, as shown 
in Figure 5.13, but the value of the test source will cancel out in the final analysis. 
Notice that in this particular circuit, the number of essential nodes has been reduced 
to two by disabling the independent sources. This is because the node which was for-
merly called N1 has been joined with the reference node by disabling the 8V source.

5.4  THEVENIN EQUIVALENT FOR A CIRCUIT 
CONTAINING ONLY DEPENDENT SOURCES
If a two-terminal network contains only dependent sources, along with resistors, 
the open-circuit voltage is zero (and therefore the Thevenin voltage is zero). This 
is known without performing the open-circuit analysis, so the open-circuit analysis 
provides no new useful information. The short-circuit current is also zero, and the 
Thevenin resistance cannot be found from the ratio V
I
/
OC
SC. The resistance shortcut 
method is not applicable because of the presence of dependent sources. Only the 
test-source analysis is applicable.
Consider the circuit in Figure 5.16, which contains only dependent sources and 
resistors.
First, we will show that the open-circuit voltage is zero for this circuit, using the 
node voltage method as shown in Figure 5.17.

In general, we can show that both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit 
current will be zero for any two-terminal network containing only dependent 
sources and resistors. Therefore, the Thevenin voltage is zero for such a net-
work, and the Thevenin equivalent circuit comprises only a resistor RTh.
The Thevenin resistance may be determined for such a network by a test-source 
analysis. This may be done using a voltage test source (either generic or of a specific 
value) or a current test source (either generic or of a specific value). In Figure 5.18, 
we apply a generic voltage source to the network in Figure 5.16.

It should be noted that the Thevenin equivalent circuit comprises only this resis-
tance because the Thevenin voltage is zero and there is no need to include a volt-
age source. It should also be noted that the resistance shortcut may not be used 
in this circuit due to the presence of dependent sources, which contribute to the 
Thevenin resistance. (The resistance shortcut would yield an equivalent resistance of

5.5  SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS
A two-terminal network comprising a voltage source and a series resistance may be 
transformed to a two-terminal network comprising a current source and a parallel 
resistor, and these two will be externally equivalent as long as the open-circuit volt-
age and short-circuit current are preserved by the transformation. This has broad 
applicability because we have seen that any two-terminal network involving resis-
tors and sources may be represented by its Thevenin equivalent involving a voltage 
source and series resistance.
Referring to the top two networks in Figure 5.19, the open-circuit voltages of the 
two are equal provided that 
=
V

These equations allow us to transform from the circuit on the left (with the voltage 
source) to the one on the right (containing the current source). By rearranging the 
FIGURE 5.19  Source transformations.

178
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
first equation, we can transform in the other direction as illustrated on the bottom of 
Figure 5.19. As long as the two networks behave equivalently for the open-circuit and 
short-circuit conditions, they will behave equivalently when connected to a general 
network of sources and resistors. The two are externally equivalent; that is, all exter-
nal voltages and currents will be unchanged by transforming from one to the other.
The use of source transformations can sometimes aid in the analysis of a circuit 
if it allows us to reduce the number of essential nodes or meshes or both. Consider 
the determination of IQ for the circuit in Figure 5.20, which contains four meshes and 
five essential nodes. We can simplify this circuit without obscuring the current IQ if 
we perform two source transformations on the right-hand side.
First, we will transform the 3A in parallel with 10Ω to 30V in series with 10Ω, 
resulting in the circuit of Figure 5.21. This has reduced the meshes to three and the 
essential nodes to four.
Next, we will transform the 1A in parallel with 5Ω to 5V in series with 5Ω, result-
ing in the circuit of Figure 5.22. Notice that the 5V source has the plus sign on the 
bottom. This is because the original current source pointed downward, and we need 
to preserve the sign of the open-circuit voltage for this two-terminal combination.
The second source transformation rendered a circuit with two meshes and two 
essential nodes. We can further simplify by combining series resistances and series 
voltage sources, giving us the simplified circuit in Figure 5.23.
Now, we can easily apply the node voltage method with a single equation:

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
It is important to realize that the transformed pieces of the circuit are externally 
equivalent, but not internally equivalent. The simplified circuit obscures certain 
quantities in the original circuit, such as the power in the 3A source or the current in 
the 5Ω resistor. If we required quantities such as these, we might choose to solve the 
original circuit, even though more equations would be needed.
5.6  NORTON’S THEOREM
Norton’s theorem states that any two-terminal network comprising sources and resis-
tances may be represented by its Norton equivalent, which involves a single current 
source and a parallel resistor as shown in Figure 5.24. The original network and its 
Norton representation are externally equivalent, so all currents and voltages external 
to the two terminals are unchanged when we replace the original network with its 
Norton equivalent.
Norton’s theorem follows from Thevenin’s theorem and a source transforma-
tion. Hence, the Norton equivalent may be found using the same methods used to 
find a Thevenin equivalent. For a network involving only independent sources and 
resistances, we can use any two of the open-circuit analysis, short-circuit analysis, 
and resistance shortcut. For a network involving mixed (independent and dependent) 
sources, we may use any two of the open-circuit, short-circuit, and test-source analy-
ses. For a network involving only dependent sources and resistances, we need to use 
a test-source analysis.

5.7  MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER THEOREM
An important application of Thevenin’s theorem (or Norton’s theorem) is in solving 
maximum power transfer problems. Suppose a load resistor is connected to a two-
terminal network involving sources and resistors as shown on the left-hand side of 
Figure 5.25. We can represent the two-terminal network by its Thevenin equivalent 
as shown on the right-hand side of this figure.
We want to know the maximum amount of electrical power which can be deliv-
ered to the load from this network, and what value of load resistance will give rise to 
this maximum power transfer. This problem can be easily solved using the Thevenin 
representation for the original circuit.

sented by its Norton equivalent.

the load resistor RL in Figure 5.26, and the corresponding value of this load resistor.

respect to the terminals where the load resistor is connected.
In Figure 5.27, the load resistor is removed so we can perform the open-circuit 
analysis with respect to the terminals where this load had been applied.

5.8  SUMMARY
Thevenin’s theorem states that any two-terminal network made up of sources and 
resistors may be represented by its Thevenin equivalent, which comprises a single 
voltage source VTh and a series resistance RTh. The Thevenin model and the origi-
nal circuit are externally equivalent; that is, they produce identical responses in 
external circuitry connected to the two terminals. Norton’s theorem states that 
any two-terminal network including sources and resistors may be represented by 
FIGURE 5.29  Load power as a function of load resistance for the example considered above.

189
Thevenin’s and Norton’s Theorems
its Norton equivalent, which comprises a current source IN and a parallel resistance 
RN. In a two-terminal circuit containing only independent sources with resistors, 
we may find the Thevenin (or Norton) equivalent by performing any two of the 
open-circuit, short-circuit, and resistance shortcut analyses. In a two-terminal 
network involving mixed (independent and dependent) sources as well as resistors, 
we may use any two of the short-circuit, open-circuit, and test-source analyses 
to find the Thevenin (or Norton equivalent). For a two-terminal network involving 
only dependent sources and resistors (no independent sources), the Thevenin voltage 
is zero and the Thevenin equivalent reduces to a single resistance. This resistance 
may be found using a test-source analysis. The Norton current also vanishes in this 
case, so the Norton equivalent reduces to a single resistance and is identical to the 
Thevenin equivalent in this case!
We may translate between the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits by using 
source transformations. More generally, a source transformation allows us to find 
a voltage source in series with a resistance, which is externally equivalent to a cur-
rent source with a parallel resistance, or vice versa. This can be very useful in circuit 
analysis because it may allow us to simplify a circuit, this reducing the number of 
essential nodes or the number of meshes. We must be careful when simplifying a 
circuit this way, because it is possible to obscure some of the quantities (currents or 
voltages) which need to be determined. In principle, source transformations may be 
done with dependent sources, but extreme care must be exercised so the controlling 
variable for a dependent source is not obscured.
Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems are extremely helpful when solving a complex 
circuit for a number of values of a single parameter. An example is a maximum 
power transfer problem, in which we want to find the maximum amount of power 
which may be delivered to a load resistor by a two-terminal circuit, as well as the cor-
responding value of the load resistor. If we find the Thevenin equivalent for the cir-
cuitry connected to the two terminals of the load resistor, then the maximum power 
that may be delivered to the load is

6 First-Order Circuits
6.1  INTRODUCTION
Up to this point, we have considered only circuits with constant (not time-varying) 
voltages and currents. In this chapter, we forge ahead to first-order circuits that have 
time-varying circuit quantities. The voltages and currents in these circuits are solu-
tions to first-order homogeneous linear differential equations, and end up being 
exponential in nature.
There are two important types of first-order circuits; these are the RC circuit and 
the RL circuit. The RC circuit involves a capacitor connected to a resistance (which 
may be part of a Thevenin equivalent), whereas an RL circuit involves an inductor 
connected with a resistance (which may also be part of a Thevenin equivalent). In 
this chapter, we will therefore need to consider two new circuit elements, the capaci-
tor and inductor, to set up our discussions of first-order circuits.
6.2  THE CAPACITOR
The capacitor is a two-terminal element comprising two metal plates separated by an 
insulating material, or dielectric, as shown in Figure 6.1.
The application of a voltage across the capacitor with the polarity given in the fig-
ure places positive charges on the top plate and negative charges on the bottom plate. 
The positive and negative charges are equal in number, so the capacitor as a whole is 
charge neutral, but the separation of charge supports the voltage applied across the 
plates. As a consequence of Gauss’ law, the charge on either plate is directly propor-
tional to the applied voltage,
	
=
Q
Cv,	
(6.1)
where Q is the electrical charge on the top plate in Coulombs, v is the applied voltage 
in Volts, and C is the capacitance in Farads (in basic units, Farad = Coulomb/Volt).

202
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
The capacitance depends on the geometry of the structure (the area A and separa-
tion of the plates d) as well as the permittivity εi of the insulating material between 
the plates: 
ε
=
C
A
d
i / . It is important to recognize that the Farad is a very large 
quantity; although supercapacitors of 1 Farad or more have become available, we 
will commonly use capacitors measured in microfarads ( µ

(
=
−
1nF
10

9
), or even picofarads (
=
−
1pF

).
In an ideal capacitor, no electrical current may flow from one plate to the other 
through the insulating material. Nonetheless, an external current in the leads is 
necessary to charge and discharge the plates, and this is referred to as a displace-
ment current. Combining the defining relation for electrical current with equa-
tion (6.1),
	
=
=
i

(6.2)
Here, we have assumed that the capacitance is constant and not a function of applied 
voltage. (This is generally a good assumption but may not hold for some special-
purpose capacitive devices.) Therefore, the above relationship allows us to find the 
displacement current if we know the time variation of the voltage. An important 
consequence of this equation is that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change 
instantaneously in time, because this would require infinite current.
In some cases, we may know the time dependence of the current and desire to 
find the resulting voltage. To analyze this situation, we can rearrange the current 
equation:
	
=
dv
i
C dt.

This expression allows us to determine the voltage if the current is known as a func-
tion of time. The current equation (6.2) and the voltage equation (6.5) are two of the 
most important relationships for a capacitor.
A third important relationship quantifies the energy stored in the capacitor (by 
way of the electric field which exists in the dielectric). To find this relationship, we 
start by considering the instantaneous power of the capacitor:

Notice that, because we are squaring the voltage, the energy stored in the capacitor 
depends only on the absolute value of the voltage and not on its algebraic sign.
6.3  PARALLEL CAPACITORS
When two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, as shown in Figure 6.2, we 
may find the equivalent capacitance for the combination, and thereby simplify the 
overall circuit.
The total current i may be found by applying KCL, with the recognition that the 
three parallel capacitors share the same voltage:

Thus, the equivalent capacitance for parallel capacitors is equal to the sum of 
the individual capacitors. Although we considered three parallel capacitors here, 
this rule applies to any number of parallel capacitors. Moreover, because paral-
lel capacitors share the same voltage, they share the same initial voltage for any 
integration.
6.4  SERIES CAPACITORS
Sometimes, we may have series combinations of capacitors, as shown in Figure 6.3.
The current i is common to the series capacitors, but they have different voltages.

6.5  NATURAL RESPONSE OF AN RC CIRCUIT
Suppose that the switch in Figure 6.4 has been in position a for a “long time” before 
instantaneously moving to position b at =
t
0. The circuitry on the left could repre-
sent any two-terminal network, which has been replaced by its Thevenin equivalent. 
Although we are considering a simple resistor on the right for now, we will later 
generalize to the case of a Thevenin circuit on the right as well.
When we say that the switch has been in position a for a “long time,” we mean 
that the circuit has settled, and therefore all time derivatives have vanished to zero. 
Therefore, the capacitor current Cdv dt

 will have settled to zero. If we apply KVL at

not change instantaneously, it will still have this value immediately after the switch

Th1 . Figure 6.5 shows the normalized natural response for 
an RC circuit; the voltage is normalized by dividing by the initial value and time is 
normalized by dividing by the time constant. We can see that the normalized value is 
0.05 (95% settled to zero) after three time constants and 0.007 (99.3% settled to zero) 
after five time constants. As a practical rule of thumb, we often say that a circuit is 
settled after 3–5 time constants, although the actual characteristic reaches its limit-
ing value asymptotically. Therefore, if we require that the switch was in position a 
for a “long time” before moving at =
t
0, a practical interpretation of this is that the 
switch was in its starting position for at least five time constants. When applying this 
requirement, we must consider the time constant which existed for <
t
0, or R

It should be noted that all voltages and currents in an RC circuit will be given 
by exponential functions with the same time constant as the capacitor voltage. For

As an example, we will find ( )
v t  and ( )
i t  for >
+
t
0  of the circuit in Figure 6.6. Here, 
the 2kΩ resistor is connected both before and after the movement of the switch, so 
it affects both RTh0 and RTh1. However, the exact value of RTh0 is unimportant if we 
are to determine ( )
v t  and ( )
i t  for >

t
0 , just as long as the switch was in its original 
position for a long time. In order to solve this problem, we will first find ( )
v t  and then 
differentiate to determine ( )
i t . This might be more convenient than first finding ( )
i t  
and then integrating to obtain ( )
v t .
In order to find VTh0, we will perform the open-circuit analysis for <

discharged for a “long time” with the switch in position a, and then the switch moves 
to position b at =

the resistance RTh1.
When we say that the switch has been in position a for a “long time,” we mean 
that the circuit has settled, and therefore all time derivatives have vanished to zero.

Th1 . Figure 6.11 shows the normalized step response for an 
RC circuit. Similar to the case of the natural response, the value is 95% settled after 
three constants and 99.3% settled after five time constants; the difference is that the 
normalized step response asymptotically approaches unity rather than zero.
As an example, consider the circuit in Figure 6.12. This circuit is almost exactly 
the same as the one considered in the previous section; the only difference is that the

Also, under short-circuit conditions, no current flows in either the 20 kΩ resistor or 
the 2kΩ resistor, because there is zero voltage applied across both of them.

So although the voltage has a non-zero final value, the current decays to zero. (It is 
always true that the capacitor current will approach zero as the circuit settles and all 
time derivatives decay to zero.)
6.7  GENERAL CASE OF NATURAL AND STEP 
RESPONSE IN AN RC CIRCUIT
In the general case of a switched RC circuit, the initial and final values for the capaci-
tor voltage may both be non-zero. Then, the total response is the sum of the natural 
response (associated with the initial voltage) and the step response (associated with 
the final value of voltage). This corresponds to a circuit of the type shown in Figure 
6.15. Here, the capacitor has been connected for a long time to a two-terminal net-
work with Thevenin voltage VTh0 and Thevenin resistance RTh0, and after =
t
0 is con-
nected to a two-terminal network with Thevenin voltage VTh1 and Thevenin resistance 
RTh1. Keep in mind that the overall circuit configuration may not look exactly like the 
one shown in Figure 6.15, because other switch configurations may be used and it 
is possible that some circuit elements may be common to the two Thevenin circuits.
Considering the configuration in Figure 6.15, if we apply KVL at =
−
t
0 , the point 
in time right before the switch moves,

6.8  THE INDUCTOR
The inductor is a two-terminal element which involves a coil of wire wrapped around 
a core which could be air or some magnetic material shown in Figure 6.19. Flowing 
a current through the coil gives rise to magnetic flux, which links the coil and is in a 
direction determined by the “right-hand rule.”

where λ
φ
= N  is the magnetic flux linkage (Wb) and L is the inductance in units of 
Henries (H). It is clear from this equation that the inductance depends on the device 
geometry as well as the magnetic medium. Like the Farad, the Henry is a very large 
quantity. In most practical applications, we will use inductors measured in millihen-
ries (

The voltage equation, =
v
Ldi dt
/
, is one of the three most important equations for 
the inductor, and it allows us to find the voltage if the current is known as a function 
of time. It also reveals that the inductor current may not change instantaneously in 
time, because that would require infinite voltage. We can derive an equation for the 
current as follows. First, we rearrange the voltage equation:
	
=
di
v
L dt.

A third important relationship quantifies the energy stored in the inductor (by way 
of the magnetic field). To find this relationship, we start by considering the instanta-
neous power of the inductor:

Because we are squaring the current, the energy stored in the inductor depends only 
on the absolute value of the current and not on its algebraic sign. This is approxi-
mately true for a real inductor if it is approximately linear and free from saturation 
and residual magnetization effects.
6.9  SERIES INDUCTORS
When two or more inductors are connected in series, as shown in Figure 6.20, we can 
find the equivalent inductance for the combination and this may allow us to simplify 
the overall circuit.
The total voltage v may be found by applying KVL, with the recognition that the 
three series inductors share the same current:

Thus, the equivalent inductance for series inductors is equal to the sum of the indi-
vidual inductances. Although we considered three series inductors here, this rule 
applies to any number. Moreover, because series inductors share the same current, 
they share the same initial current for any integration.
6.10  PARALLEL INDUCTORS
Sometimes, we may have parallel combinations of inductors, as shown in Figure 6.21.
The voltage v is common to the parallel inductors, but they have distinct currents.

6.11  NATURAL RESPONSE OF AN RL CIRCUIT
Suppose that the switch in Figure 6.22 has been in position a for a “long time” before 
instantaneously moving to position b at t
0
=
. Prior to the switch movement, the 
inductor is connected to a two-terminal network represented by its Norton equiva-
lent comprising a current source IN 0 and a parallel resistance RN 0. (This is com-
pletely general; any two-terminal circuit containing sources and resistors may be 
represented by its Norton equivalent.) After movement of the switch, the inductor is 
connected to a simple resistance RN1.
The switch used here is a special type, known as a “make-before-break” switch 
because it makes contact with b before breaking contact with a. The configuration 
shown requires a make-before-break switch to avoid a momentary interruption of the 
inductor current, which would give rise to a large induced voltage (Ldi dt
/
) and cause 
arcing across the physical contacts. We will see that in some circuit configurations 
it is possible to use a simple single-pole, single-throw switch as long as a path for 
inductor current exists for both positions of the switch.
FIGURE 6.21  Parallel inductors.

When we say that the switch has been in position a for a “long time,” we mean 
that the circuit has settled, and therefore all time derivatives have vanished to zero.

6.12  STEP RESPONSE OF AN RL CIRCUIT
Now consider the situation depicted in Figure 6.23, in which an inductor has been 
connected to a resistor for a long time with the make-before-break switch in position 
a, and then the switch moves to position b at t
0
=
, causing the inductor current to 
increase asymptotically to IN1 with a parallel resistance RN1.
When we say that the switch has been in position a for a “long time,” we mean 
that the circuit has settled, and therefore all time derivatives have vanished to zero. 
Therefore, the inductor voltage Ldi dt

6.13  GENERAL CASE OF THE NATURAL AND 
STEP RESPONSE IN AN RL CIRCUIT
In the general case of a switched RL circuit, the initial and final values for the induc-
tor current may both be non-zero. Then, the total response is the sum of the natural 
response (associated with the initial current) and the step response (associated with the 
final value of current). This corresponds to a circuit of the type shown in Figure 6.24. 
Here, the inductor has been connected for a long time to a two-terminal network with 

230

Norton current IN 0 and Norton resistance RN 0, and after t

 is connected to a two-
terminal network with Norton current IN1 and Norton resistance RN1. Keep in mind that 
the overall circuit configuration may not look exactly like the one shown in Figure 6.24, 
because other switch configurations may be used and it is possible that some circuit 
elements may be common to the two Norton circuits.

for any voltage or current in an RL circuit.

6.14  SEQUENTIAL SWITCHING IN FIRST-ORDER CIRCUITS
The general principles presented in the previous sections may be extended to first-
order circuits in which there are two or more switching events occurring at different 
times. In such a case, the initial condition for the second or later switching event is 
determined by considering the solution for the previous switching event. To illustrate 
this, we will consider two sequential switching examples: one involving an RL cir-
cuit and one involving an RC circuit.
Consider the RL circuit in Figure 6.29. Here, there are two switches: switch one 
closes at t
0
=
 and then switch two closes at t
10ms
=
.
For t
0
<
, with both switches open as shown in Figure 6.30, there are no sources 
connected to the inductor, and
	
I
0.
SC0 =

Next, we will consider 
t

≤
≤
+

is still open as shown in Figure 6.31.
The short-circuit current with respect to the terminals where the inductor is con-
nected is

Before we move on to the second switching event, it is worth noting that the circuit 
will never settle to the “final values” for time interval one. This is because the sec-
ond switch will move at t
10ms
=
 whereas it would take about five time constants, or 
62.5ms, for the circuit to settle.
For consideration of the second time interval after the second switching event,

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
To find the final value of the current for time interval two, we need to find the short-
circuit current with respect to the terminals where the inductor is connected, for 
the situation in which both switches have moved to their final positions as shown in 
Figure 6.32.
The short-circuit current with respect to the terminals where the inductor is con-
nected is

A similar approach may be applied to solve an RC circuit with sequential switching. 
Consider the circuit in Figure 6.33, which involves three switching events: switch one 
moves at t
0
=
, switch two moves at t
20ms
=
, and switch three moves at t
40ms
=
. 
Notice that switch two opens whereas the other two switches close; in general, we 
could have any mix of openings and closures so this must be observed carefully.
For t
0
≤
−, all switches are in their starting positions as shown in Figure 6.34 
(switch one is open, switch two is closed, and switch three is open). We can perform 
the open-circuit analysis to find the initial capacitor voltage.
Performing the open-circuit analysis with units of V, mA, and kΩ, there are two 
essential nodes and a single node equation:

6.15  SUMMARY
The capacitor is a two-terminal device comprising two metal plates separated by 
an insulating material. As a consequence of Gauss’ law, an external current, called 
the displacement current, flows to charge and discharge the plates and is given by 
i
Cdv dt
/
=
, where i is the capacitor current, v is the capacitor voltage, and C is the 
capacitance in Farads. Hence, the capacitor voltage may not change instantaneously. 

248
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
The capacitor voltage may be found by integrating the current: v
V
C

, where 
V0 is the initial voltage across the capacitor. The energy w stored in a capacitor is pro-
portional to the square of the voltage: w
Cv

=
. When two or more capacitors are 
connected in parallel, the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the individual capaci-
tances. When two or more capacitors are connected in series, the equivalent capaci-
tance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances.
The inductor is a two-terminal device comprising a coil of wire wrapped around 
a magnetic medium (which may be air). According to the Faraday law, the voltage 
across an inductor is given by =
v
Ldi dt
/
, where v is the voltage, i is the current, and 
L is the inductance in Henries. Hence, the inductor current may not change instanta-
neously. The inductor current may be found by integrating the voltage:

where I0 is the initial voltage across the capacitor. The energy w stored in an inductor 
is proportional to the square of the current:

2. When inductors are connected 
in series, the equivalent inductance is the sum of the individual inductances. When 
inductors are connected in parallel, the equivalent inductance is the reciprocal of the 
sum of the reciprocals of the individual inductances.
An RC circuit is a first-order circuit containing a capacitor, a switch, and sources and 
resistances. Determination of the capacitor voltage or current as a function of time after 
movement of the switch requires solution of a first-order differential equation. The solu-
tion for the capacitor voltage is of the form

voltage for the circuitry connected after the movement of the switch:

Th1. The time 
constant is given by τ = R

connected after movement of the switch and C is the capacitance. Once the capacitor 
voltage is known, the current can be readily found by differentiation: ( )

.
An RL circuit is a first-order circuit containing an inductor, a switch, sources, and 
resistances. Determination of the inductor current or voltage as a function of time after 
movement of the switch requires solution of a first-order differential equation. The 
solution for the inductor current is of the form

the movement of the switch:

constant is given by τ = L RN

The concepts developed above may be applied to sequential switching prob-
lems, in which an RC or RL circuit contains two or more switches which move at dif-
ferent times. The solution for the first switching event may be found in the same way 
as described above. For any subsequent switching event, the solution is of the general

7 Second-Order Circuits
7.1  INTRODUCTION
A second-order circuit is one which contains two energy-storage elements so that 
its behavior is governed by a second-order differential equation. Energy-storage ele-
ments include capacitors and inductors, and here our focus will be on the transient 
response of resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) second-order circuits containing one 
capacitor and one inductor. We will first consider the series RLC circuit, in which 
the capacitor and the inductor are in series; then we will consider the parallel RLC 
circuit, in which the capacitor and the inductor are in parallel, and finally we will 
briefly visit the general case in which the inductor and the capacitor are neither in 
parallel nor in series.
7.2  NATURAL RESPONSE OF A SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
Consider the series RLC circuit in Figure 7.1. We will assume that the initial cur-
rent in the inductor is I0 and the initial voltage across the capacitor is V0. (There 
are numerous switching configurations capable of establishing these initial condi-
tions, and we will consider some of these, but we omit them here for simplicity.) 
We want to determine ( )
i t  and ( )
v t  for ≥
+
t
0 . If we allow the circuit to settle, both 
the inductor current and the capacitor voltage will settle to zero: ( )
∞=
i
0 and 
( )
∞=
v
0.
To determine the transient response of this circuit while it is settling, we need to 
set up and solve a second-order homogeneous linear differential equation. To do this, 
we start by using Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL):

There are three important cases with regard to the nature of the roots and the

given by a linear combination of two exponentials. This is the overdamped case:

7.3  OVERDAMPED NATURAL RESPONSE OF A SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
Consider the natural response of the series RLC circuit in Figure 7.2. Suppose that

time is expressed in s.

The transient response (current and capacitor voltage) is plotted in Figure 7.3.
As another example, consider the natural response of the series RLC circuit in 
Figure 7.4. The make-before-break switch has been in position a for a long time 
and moves to position b at =
t
0. Prior to the movement of the switch, all time deriv-
atives would have settled to zero, and therefore the capacitor current would have 
settled to zero. Because the inductor is in series with the capacitor, its current will 
also have settled to zero. This means that in a circuit with this configuration, the 
FIGURE 7.3  Transient response (current and capacitor voltage) in the overdamped series 
RLC circuit of Figure 7.2.

266

initial condition for the inductor will always be zero. On the other hand, the voltage 
across the capacitor will have settled to the value of the Thevenin voltage for the 
circuitry connected prior to the switch movement, because with the current settled 
to zero there will be zero voltage across the resistor and zero voltage across the 
inductor. This same capacitor voltage will exist immediately after the movement 
of the switch because the capacitor voltage may not change instantaneously. Thus,

each exhibits the form of a decaying sinusoid. This is further illustrated in Figure 7.10,

7.6  STEP AND NATURAL RESPONSE OF A SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
Consider the series RLC circuit in Figure 7.11. We will assume that the switch has 
been in position a for a “long time” before moving to position b. If the circuit has 
been allowed to settle before the movement of the switch, all time derivatives will 
have settled to zero. Therefore, the current will have settled to zero, and because 
of the inductor this current may not change instantaneously when the switch is 
moved. Hence, (

settled to the Thevenin voltage for the circuit connected prior to the movement of 
the switch, and the capacitor voltage may not change instantaneously. Therefore,

i t  will have one of the same forms (over-
damped, critically-damped, or underdamped) as found when considering the natural 
response. On the other hand, the solution for the capacitor voltage will have one of 
the same forms plus a constant to account for a non-zero final value. These forms of 
the solution are summarized in Table 7.2.
As an example, consider the circuit in Figure 7.12.

7.7  NATURAL RESPONSE OF A PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
Now, we will shift our focus to parallel RLC circuits, in which the inductor and the 
capacitor are connected in parallel. We will find that many of the considerations 
are similar to those for series circuits, but with key differences in the determina-
tion of α , initial conditions, and final conditions. Suppose that the parallel RLC 
circuit in Figure 7.14 exhibits an initial inductor current of I0  and an initial capaci-
tor voltage of V0. (There are switching configurations capable of establishing these 
initial conditions, but the switching circuitry is omitted here for simplicity.) We 
want to determine 
( )
i
t
L
 and ( )
v t  for ≥
+

0 . If we allow the circuit to settle, both 
the inductor current and the capacitor voltage will settle to zero: 
( )

0 and 
( )
∞=

0.

Second-Order Circuits

given by the same expression as the series case, the neper frequency is not.
Once again there are three cases with regard to the nature of the roots and the 
response of the circuit. These are the overdamped, critically-damped, and under-
damped cases summarized in Table 7.3. Although the table gives the forms of the 
solution for the voltage, which is common to all three elements and therefore a fun-
damental quantity, it should be recognized that the individual currents in the circuit 
will exhibit the same general forms.

7.8  STEP AND NATURAL RESPONSE OF A PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
Now consider the parallel RLC circuit in Figure 7.15, and suppose the switch has 
been in position a for a long time before moving to position b. If the circuit settled 
with the switch in position a, all time derivatives will have settled to zero. This 
implies that 
=
v
Ldi

L /
 will have settled to zero before the movement of the 
switch, and the voltage may not change instantaneously because of the capaci-
tor, so (

instantaneously so the value of 
(
)

iC 0
 may not be zero and must be determined 
by using KCL. Given these considerations, the inductor current will have settled 
to the value of the Norton current source connected prior to the switch movement, 
and the inductor current may not change instantaneously so the same value of 
current will exist right after the switch moves: (

Second-Order Circuits
To determine the transient response of this circuit after the switch has moved to 
position b, we need to set up and solve a second-order homogeneous linear differen-
tial equation. To do this, we start by using KCL:

are summarized in Table 7.4.

. The initial voltage will be zero, because the inductor will 
settle to zero voltage prior to the switch movement and the parallel capacitor pre-
vents the voltage from changing instantaneously. The final voltage will also be zero 
because the inductor will resettle to zero volts after the switch has been moved.

7.9  GENERAL RLC CIRCUIT
Some second-order RLC circuits may be neither parallel nor series in character; that 
is, the inductor and the capacitor are neither in parallel nor in series. One example 
is shown in Figure 7.22. Here, the switch has been open for a long time and closes 
at =
t
0. In order to solve for i and v for ≥
+
t
0 , it is necessary to derive and solve the 
second-order differential equation.
In order to derive the differential equation, we disable the independent sources 
and consider the position of the switch for ≥
+
t
0 . Here, there is only one independent 
voltage source to disable, and we disable it by setting it to zero volts or a short. (If 
there had been an independent current source, we would disable it by setting it to zero 
amperes or an open circuit.) This results in the circuit of Figure 7.23.

7.10  SUMMARY
In this chapter, we considered the transient response for switched second-order 
circuits. A second-order circuit contains two energy-storage elements, such as an 
inductor and a capacitor, two capacitors, or two inductors, and its transient behav-
ior is described by a second-order differential equation. We considered some 
important cases of second-order circuits here, including the series RLC circuit, 
the parallel RLC circuit, and the general RLC circuit which may be neither series 
nor parallel.
First, we analyzed the natural response of a series RLC circuit as shown in 
Figure 7.24.
The initial inductor current is assumed to be I0 and the initial capacitor voltage is 
assumed to be V0. Both final values will be zero. The differential equation describing 
the behavior for ≥

When solving for the current, the differential equation and the characteristic equa-
tion are the same as in the case of the natural response, so the forms of the solution 
are the same. The solutions for the capacitor voltage are similar but with an added 
constant representing the final value. For ≥

More generally, the initial conditions must be found by consideration of the par-
ticular switching configuration, which may be different from those shown in Figures 
7.25 and 7.27. Also, some RLC circuits are neither parallel nor series in character, so 
it becomes necessary to derive and solve the differential equation rather than use one 
of the predetermined solutions obtained above.

8 Sinusoidal Steady-
State Analysis
8.1  INTRODUCTION
Up to this point, the independent sources we considered provided constant, unchang-
ing voltages or currents; these are referred to as direct current (DC) sources. Now, we 
turn our analysis to the important case of sinusoidal sources, which are also referred 
to as alternating current (AC) sources. This is the field of sinusoidal steady-state 
analysis, which is important for two reasons: first, electrical power distribution is 
usually done using sinusoidal voltages, and second, sinusoidal steady-state analysis 
allows us to analyze the frequency response of signal-processing circuitry.
A sinusoidal voltage source may be specified in the time domain as
	
v t
V
t
m
ω
φ
(
)
( ) =
+
 
cos
,	
(8.1)
where Vm is the amplitude of the sinusoid in V, ω is the radial frequency in rad/s, and 
φ is the phase angle in rad. Other quantities of interest are the frequency f  in Hz, 
where f
ω (
)
=
π
/ 2
, and the period T in s, given by T
f
= 1/
.
Consider the switched application of a sinusoidal voltage source to the resistor-
inductor (RL) circuit shown in Figure 8.1.

This solution comprises two parts. The transient response may be determined by 
the methods illustrated in Chapter 6, but it decays exponentially after the switch has 
moved. We are often more interested in the sinusoidal steady-state response, which 
is sinusoidal with the same frequency as the source in the circuit. This chap-
ter will describe phasor and impedance methods used to determine the sinusoidal 
steady-state response. We will see that this approach simplifies the solution by allow-
ing us to solve algebraic equations instead of differential equations.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
8.2  REVIEW OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
In order to solve AC circuits algebraically, without the need for differential equa-
tions, we will make extensive use of complex numbers and complex mathematics. It 
should be understood that this represents a system of shortcuts and that we are using 
complex quantities to represent real circuit elements, real currents, and real voltages. 
Nonetheless, working with complex quantities is a critical part of sinusoidal steady-
state analysis so we will review the mathematics of complex numbers.
A complex number A
jB
+
 involves a real component A and an imaginary com-
ponent, jB, where j is the imaginary unit,1 j =
−1. This complex number may be 
shown on the complex plane using Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates or polar coor-
dinates of the form R θ
∠, as shown in Figure 8.2.
Using Euler’s relationship,2 we can convert from rectangular coordinates to polar 
coordinates3:

counterclockwise at an angular velocity ω, then v t( ) may be considered to be the 
projection of this spinning vector on the real axis. If we freeze this spinning vector at 
t = 0, this results in a phasor representation of the sinusoid in the complex plane. For 
example, consider the following three sinusoidal voltages:

It is important to be familiar with all of these equivalent ways for expressing a pha-
sor, and to be equally comfortable with rectangular forms and polar forms. The three 
phasors described above may be plotted in the complex plane as shown in Figure 8.4. 
We can represent sinusoidal currents as phasors in much the same way. However, it 
must be emphasized that voltages and currents are real, not complex, and the com-
plex phasor is simply a convenient way to represent the amplitude and phase of a real 
sinusoid!
8.4  IMPEDANCES
When solving for the sinusoidal steady-state response of a circuit, we first transform 
the circuit from the time domain to the phasor domain (also referred to as the 
frequency domain). To do this, we represent sources using complex phasors while 
passive components (resistors, inductors, and capacitors and their combinations) are 
represented by complex impedances.

The impedance of a resistor is equal to its resistance and has zero phase angle; 
therefore, the current and voltage for a resistor are in phase (at the same phase 
angle).

of v t

current are in phase. Figure 8.7 shows the phasor voltage and current for this case, 
showing that the two phasors have the same angle or phase.

It is customary to describe sinusoidal voltages and currents in terms of cosines, not 
sines, and the phase angles are always given with respect to the cosine function.

The impedance of an inductor is equal to jωL; it has a phase angle of π/2 so the 
current lags the voltage by π/2 radians.

of v t

lags the voltage by a phase angle of π / 2. (In the time domain, the current peaks 
one-quarter period after the voltage.) Figure 8.10 shows the phasor voltage and cur-
rent for this case. Recognizing that increasing angle represents counterclockwise 
rotation of a phasor, we see that the current phasor lags the voltage phasor by π / 2.

The impedance of a capacitor is equal to 1/(jωC); it has a phase angle of −π/2

of v t

leads the voltage by a phase angle of π / 2. (In the time domain, the current peaks 
one-quarter period before the voltage.) Figure 8.13 shows the phasor voltage and 
current for this case. Recognizing that increasing angle represents counterclockwise 
rotation of a phasor, we see that the current phasor leads the voltage phasor by π / 2.
8.4.4  Series Impedances
Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law apply in the phasor domain, and we can analyze 
the case of series impedances in a manner analogous to that used for series resistors.

In other words, parallel impedances combine like parallel resistors. The equivalent 
impedance for two parallel impedances is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of 
their reciprocals. In the particular case of two parallel impedances, the equivalent 
impedance is equal to the product divided by the sum:

(8.46)
A statement of the current-divider rule is as follows: when two impedances are 
connected in parallel, the phasor current in one of the impedances is equal to 
the total current phasor multiplied by the impedance in the other branch and 
divided by the sum of the impedances.
We can generalize the current-divider rule to three or more impedances in parallel 
by combining all of the impedances but one, rendering a system with two parallel 
impedances.
8.4.6  Combinations of Series and Parallel Impedances
We can extend the concepts of the previous two sections to more complex situations 
involving series and parallel combinations of impedances. Consider the circuit in 
Figure 8.16, shown both in the time domain (8.16a) and in the phasor domain (8.16b).
Here, C and R1 are in parallel, R2 and L are in parallel, and these two combinations 
are then connected in series. The equivalent impedance is therefore

Both the real and imaginary parts of the equivalent impedance are seen to be strong 
functions of frequency in Figure 8.17. The real component of the impedance plateaus 
at 10Ω in the middle range of frequencies. Moreover, the imaginary part exhibits 
a zero crossing at ~ 50,000rad/s, so the impedance is real (purely resistive) at this 
radial frequency.

where R is the resistance and X is the reactance, both in units of Ω. Table 8.1 shows 
the impedance, resistance, and reactance of the resistor, capacitor, and inductor.
Sometimes, it is convenient to use the admittance Y, which is the reciprocal of 
impedance:
	
Y
Z
G
jB
=

1/

(8.49)
where G is the conductance and B is the susceptance. All three parameters have units 
of 
−
Ω1. We will use impedances for most purposes, but the admittance may be par-
ticularly convenient in parallel connections. The reason is that, as shown in equation 
(8.42), the admittance for several elements in parallel is the sum of the individual 
admittances.

8.5  SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS
We now return to the circuit introduced in Figure 8.1; this circuit is reproduced in 
Figure 8.18 in both the time domain (8.18a) and the phasor domain (8.18b). The imped-

(8.58)
Thus, by transforming to the phasor domain, we were able to solve algebraically and 
then transform back to the time domain. If we had solved this circuit directly in the 
time domain, it would have involved the solution of a differential equation. Whereas 
we can scale the phasor approach to very complicated circuits by use of the node 
voltage or mesh current method, a time-domain solution becomes cumbersome for a 
circuit of even modest complexity.

8.6  NODAL ANALYSIS IN CIRCUITS WITH 
SINUSOIDAL EXCITATION
Because Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law apply to circuits with sinusoidal excitation 
in the phasor domain, it is also true that we can apply the node voltage method, the 
mesh current method, and Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems to them. As an example 
of the use of the node voltage method, consider the circuit in Figure 8.19.
This circuit has been redrawn in the phasor domain in Figure 8.20. To do this, we note that 
the radial frequency for all sources is ω = 500rad/s, and j

same manner as in DC circuits. As an example, consider the circuit in Figure 8.22.
This circuit has been redrawn in the phasor domain in Figure 8.23.

8.8  THEVENIN’S AND NORTON’S THEOREMS IN AC CIRCUITS
In this section, we will consider the use of Thevenin’s theorem, source transforma-
tions, and Norton’s theorem in circuits with sinusoidal excitation. It should become 
clear that many of the considerations are the same as in DC circuits, although it is 
necessary to use complex quantities; in an AC circuit, the Thevenin voltage is a com-
plex phasor and the Thevenin impedance is generally complex as well.
8.8.1  Thevenin’s Theorem
With respect to an AC circuit, Thevenin’s theorem states that for any two-terminal 
network involving impedances and sources, there is a Thevenin equivalent network 
involving a single voltage source Th
V  and a single impedance ZTh, as shown in Figure 
8.25. Generally, both Th
V  and ZTh will be complex. The Thevenin circuit is externally 
equivalent to the original circuit, in the sense that if we connect additional circuitry 
to the two terminals a and b, the voltages and currents in this external circuitry will 
be the same for the Thevenin equivalent as the original circuit. They are not inter-
nally equivalent, however. This means that we cannot use the Thevenin equivalent 
circuit to directly find voltages and currents inside the original circuit.
If the two-terminal network contains independent sources, we may use the open-
circuit and short-circuit conditions to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit. The exter-
nally-equivalent networks should exhibit the same open-circuit voltage as shown in 
Figure 8.26.
Therefore, the Thevenin voltage is equal to the open-circuit voltage for the origi-
nal circuit.

We will see below that, in a two-terminal network containing only independent 
sources, we may also find the Thevenin impedance by disabling the sources and 
determining the equivalent impedance with respect to the terminals a and b. (We 
will refer to this method as the “impedance shortcut.”)
Occasionally, the original circuit may contain no independent sources, either 
because it contains only impedances or because the sources within it are all depen-
dent sources. If this is the case, both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit 
current will be zero so we may not use their ratio to find the Thevenin resistance. 
Instead, we can apply a test source as shown in Figure 8.28. We can use either a volt-
age test source or a current test source, if one is more convenient than the other. In 
Figure 8.28, we show the application of a voltage test source of value 
Test
V
, and the 
resulting current Test
I
 is to be determined. We could also apply a current test source 
of value 
Test
I
, and then find the resulting voltage 
Test
V
. Either way, a simple applica-
tion of KVL and Ohm’s law reveals that

As an example, consider the two-terminal circuit in Figure 8.29. It contains only 
independent sources, and we may use any two of the open-circuit, short-circuit, and 
impedance shortcut analyses.
For the open-circuit analysis, we will use the labeling of nodes shown in Figure 
8.30. Note that although the bottom node is not an essential node for the open-circuit 
analysis, it will be an essential node for the short-circuit analysis. Hence, we use it as 
the reference so we can keep the same labeling of nodes for both analyses.
We will start by doing the open-circuit analysis by the node voltage method as 
shown in Figure 5.6.

It is important to realize that the impedances for the reactive components (j2Ω and 
j4Ω) have been determined for a particular frequency; therefore, this Thevenin 
equivalent circuit is only applicable at that frequency. In general, the impedances of 
inductors and capacitors are frequency dependent so the Thevenin equivalent circuit 
is frequency dependent.
Because the circuit contains no dependent sources, we may also use the 
­impedance shortcut analysis. To apply this, we disable the independent sources and 
find the resulting equivalent impedance with respect to the terminals a and b. To dis-
able the sources, we replace the current source with an open and replace the voltage 
source with a short, as shown in Figure 8.32.
The Thevenin impedance is the equivalent impedance “seen” looking into the 
terminals a and b; it is

It should be noted that the impedance shortcut may not be used for a circuit contain-
ing mixed (dependent and independent) sources; this is because a dependent source 
contributes to the Thevenin impedance. Fortunately, the open-circuit and short-cir-
cuit analyses may be used with mixed sources.
As a second example, consider the circuit in Figure 8.33, which contains a depen-
dent source but no independent sources.
The Thevenin voltage is necessarily zero, but to find the Thevenin impedance we 
can apply a test source as shown in Figure 8.34. (The same approach is applicable 
with two or more dependent sources, although the analysis may be more complicated.)

It should be recognized that the value of 
Test
V
 cancels out in the final analysis; there-
fore, we may leave its value unspecified (as was done here), or we may choose a spe-
cific value in volts if it is convenient. Although the test-source analysis is not directly 
applicable to a circuit containing mixed sources, we could disable the independent 
sources and then apply a test source to the remaining network to find its Thevenin 
impedance. Generally, though, this will be less convenient than the use of the open-
circuit and short-circuit analyses in such a case.
8.8.2  Source Transformations
A two-terminal network comprising a voltage source and a series impedance may be 
transformed to a two-terminal network comprising a current source and a parallel 
impedance, and these two will be externally equivalent as long as the open-circuit 
voltage and short-circuit current are preserved by the transformation.
Referring to the top two networks in Figure 8.35, the open-circuit voltages of the 
two are equal provided that 
ZN
Th =
V
IN
. The two short-circuit currents are equal if 
Z
Th
=

and

N =

(8.122)
These equations allow us to transform from the circuit on the left (with the voltage 
source) to the one on the right (containing the current source). By rearranging the 
first equation, we can transform in the other direction as illustrated on the bottom of 
Figure 8.35. As long as the two networks behave equivalently for the open-circuit and 
short-circuit conditions, they will behave equivalently when connected to a network 
of sources and impedances. The two are externally equivalent; that is, all external 
voltages and currents will be unchanged by transforming from one to the other.

337
Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
8.8.3  Norton’s Theorem
With respect to an AC circuit, Norton’s theorem states that for any two-terminal net-
work involving impedances and sources, there is a Norton equivalent network involv-
ing a single current source IN and a parallel impedance ZN, as shown in Figure 8.36.  
This follows directly from the use of Thevenin’s theorem and a source transforma-
tion. Therefore, the methods employed to determine the Norton equivalent are the 
same as those used to find the Thevenin equivalent.

If we average the instantaneous power in (8.127) over any integral number of ­periods, 
we obtain P; therefore, P represents the average power for the element under consid-
eration. Because we are using the passive sign convention, a positive value ­represents 
power dissipated whereas a negative value shows power developed. The term involv-
ing Q averages to zero for any integral number of periods. We therefore refer to Q 
as reactive power, because it is associated with reactive components of impedance 
and it results from the component of current which is out of phase with the voltage. 
Reactive power alters the instantaneous power and current, and these are important 
effects which must be considered when rating components, interconnections, and 
systems, but it represents the sloshing back and forth of power through energy stor-
age and release rather than the dissipation of power.
The cosine appearing in the average power is called the power factor, PF, and the 
sine appearing in the reactive power is referred to as the reactive factor, RF:

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
For efficient power delivery, it is desirable to maximize the PF (to unity if ­possible) 
and minimize the RF (to zero if possible). In a large plant with many machines and 
motors, the PF will tend to be lagging but may be corrected by banks of capacitors. 
In a plant with many electronically-controlled furnaces, the PF may be leading and 
could be corrected by installing an inductor bank.
8.9.2  Average Power and Root Mean Square 
(rms) Values of Voltage or Current

found by integrating the instantaneous power

Therefore, the root mean square value of a sinusoidal voltage is equal to the 
amplitude divided by the square root of two. A similar conclusion holds for a 
sinusoidal current waveform.

Therefore, the complex power for a two-terminal element may be determined by 
multiplying the phasor voltage by the conjugate of the phasor current. It should 
be recognized that the passive sign convention applies, so if either reference polarity 
from Figure 8.37 were reversed it would be necessary to include a minus sign in the 
complex power equation.
For an impedance, we can utilize Ohm’s law to develop another expression for the 
complex power:

the example shown, both P and Q are positive, representing a load with a lagging PF, 
and the power triangle is in the first quadrant. For a load with a leading PF, the power 
triangle would be in the fourth quadrant. The power triangle for a source developing 
power would be in the third or fourth quadrant, depending on whether its load was 
leading or lagging, respectively. The angle v

 is referred to as the power angle.
The apparent power, average power, and reactive power all have units of VA. 
However, it is customary to distinguish between them by using VA for apparent 
power, W for average power, and VARS  (volt-amperes reactive) for the reactive 
power.
It should be clear now that all complex power calculations involve rms values, and 
we will not always explicitly use an “rms” subscript, although we will use the nota-
tions V rms
(
) and A rms
(
) for units. Other notations are used as well, so it is impor-
tant to always be aware of whether rms or amplitude values are being used.
As an example of complex power calculation, consider the circuit in Figure 8.39, 
rendered in the phasor domain.

8.10  MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER IN CIRCUITS 
WITH SINUSOIDAL EXCITATION
As in the DC case, an important application of Thevenin’s theorem (or Norton’s theo-
rem) is in solving maximum power transfer problems. Suppose a load impedance ZL 
is connected to a two-terminal network involving sources and impedances as shown 
FIGURE 8.39  AC circuit for the determination of the complex power.

343
Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
on the left-hand side of Figure 8.41. We can represent the two-terminal network by 
its Thevenin equivalent as shown on the right of this figure.
We want to know the maximum average power which can be delivered to the load, 
and what value of load impedance will give rise to this maximum power transfer. 
This problem can be easily solved using the Thevenin representation for the original 
circuit.
In order to solve this problem, we recognize that

Second, we would like to find the purely-resistive load impedance, which will maxi-

We start by doing the open-circuit analysis with respect to the terminals where the

8.11  THREE-PHASE CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
Power transmission and distribution is usually done using three-phase circuits and 
systems, and the reason for this is efficiency. To see this, first consider the delivery 
of AC power to three load impedances using three parallel single-phase systems (all 
at a common phase angle) as shown in Figure 8.46. Six resistive transmission lines 
are used, and it is assumed that they all have the same series resistance RS. Suppose 
the voltages all have the same magnitude VM, and the load impedances all are equal:

a three-phase system as shown in Figure 8.47. Only a single return line is needed, so 
a total of four resistive transmission lines is used, and they are assumed to each have 
the same series resistance RS. The phases of the three voltage sources are chosen 
so that the three return currents will cancel, and the summed current in the single

. In this case, because of the elimination of the 
power loss in the three return lines, the total power loss in the series resistances is 
3
loss

=

. Therefore, the power loss in the series wiring is halved compared to 
the single-phase case, and this is significant. Typically, the power losses in the series 
resistance amount to 3%, but would be twice this or 6% if single-phase power trans-
mission were used. In the United States, a 3% savings in power is enough to supply 
all of New Jersey!
In the example considered here, the system was balanced, so the loss in the return 
line was ideally zero. (In a balanced system, the voltage magnitudes are equal, the 
source phases are spaced by 120°, and the load impedances are equal.) Although real 
systems are never exactly balanced, they tend to be approximately balanced, and the 
benefit in efficiency is nearly the same as for the balanced case.
8.11.1  Three-Phase Configurations
There are several possible configurations for a three-phase system because the 
sources may be connected as a wye (Y) or delta (Δ), and similarly the loads may 
be connected in a wye or a delta. Figure 8.48 displays two possible ways of draw-
ing a wye-connected source. Although the form in 8.48a more strongly resembles a 
“wye,” the form on the left (also referred to as a “tee”) is often used in schematics 
for convenience.
FIGURE 8.47  Delivery of power to three equal load impedances using a three-phase system.

350
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
Figure 8.49 displays three possible ways of drawing a delta-connected source. 
Although the form in 8.49a most strongly resembles a “delta,” the other two forms are 
often used for convenience. The representation in 8.49b is sometimes called a “pi.”
Four basic configurations for a three-phase system are the Y-Y, Y-Δ, Δ-Y, and 
Δ-Δ, where the first symbol refers to the source and the second refers to the load. 
These four configurations are shown in Figure 8.50. It is important to note that a 
ground (neutral) connection is only available in a wye, and only in the Y-Y configura-
tion is it possible to connect the neutral points of the source and load.
The positive phase sequence normally used is A-B-C; so phase A leads 
phase B and phase B leads phase C. Each phase difference is 2 / 3
π
, or 120°, and 
phase A is our reference. Hence, VB lags VA by 120°, and VC lags VB by 120°. 
This is shown in Figure 8.51. The phase angle for VC may be expressed equiva-
lently as 240
−
° or 120°, but the latter is more commonly used. For the example 
shown, 
120V rms

. VA, VB, and VC are referred 
to as the “phase voltages” because they appear across one of the circuit elements 
(in this case, sources). The line voltages may be determined by Kirchhoff’s 
law.

, as shown in Figure 8.51. These are called line volt-
ages because they exist between two lines. Hence, in a wye connection of sources, 
the line voltages are larger in magnitude than the phase voltages by a factor of 3.
Figure 8.52 shows the positive phase sequence for a delta-connected source. Here, 
VBC lags VAB by 120°, and VCA lags VBC by 120°. Phase angles are referenced with respect 
to VAB. For the example shown,

352
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
VAB, VBC, and VCA are referred to as the “phase voltages” because they appear across 
one of the sources. The line voltages are equal to the phase voltages in the case of a 
delta connection, because each source is connected between two lines.
8.11.2  Balanced Wye–Wye System
Consider the balanced wye–wye system shown in Figure 8.53. It is balanced because 
the three sources have the same magnitude, the source phases are spaced by 120° as 
dictated by the positive phase sequence, and each phase experiences the same total 
impedance. Here, 1
0.75 Ω
j
(
)
+
 represents the Thevenin impedance for each source, 
0.5Ω represents the wiring resistance for each line, and 24
6 Ω
j
(
)
+
 represents the 
impedance for each load.
FIGURE 8.51  The positive phase sequence in a wye-connected source.
FIGURE 8.52  The positive phase sequence in a delta-connected source.

353
Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
Because the system is balanced, zero voltage will develop at the neutral point of 
the load, and zero current will flow in the neutral line. We can show this by use of the 
node voltage method with the nodes labeled as shown in Figure 8.54. (The mesh cur-
rent method could also be used, but this would involve three meshes and three equa-
tions instead of two essential nodes and one equation in the node voltage method.)

A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
Therefore, in the balanced wye–wye system, zero voltage develops at the neutral 
point because the three source voltages add to zero and their contributions are 
equally weighted in the balanced circuit. Because of this, determination of the line 
currents is simplified.

by 120° and ICc lags IBb by 120°.

This system may be solved using the mesh current method with the meshes 
labeled as shown in Figure 8.57. (The node voltage method could also be used, but 
this involves six essential nodes and five equations, whereas the mesh current method 
involves four meshes and four equations.)

Figure 8.58 shows the phase voltages, line currents, and phase currents on phasor 
diagrams. It can be seen that the line currents all exhibit the same magnitude and the 
same phase relationship as the phase voltages; that is, IB'b lags I A'a by 120° and IC'c 
lags IB'b by 120°. The phase currents all have equal magnitude, but this magnitude is 
1/
3 times the magnitude of the line currents. Also, the phase currents exhibit the 
same phase relationship as the phase voltages; Ibc lags Iab by 120° and Ica lags Ibc by 
120°.

8.11.4  Unbalanced Three-Phase System
Any unbalanced three-phase system may be analyzed using either the node voltage 
method or the mesh current method. As one example consider the wye–wye system 
shown in Figure 8.59. This system is unbalanced because the three load impedances 
are not equal, and therefore a non-zero voltage will develop at the neutral point of 
the load.
The non-zero voltage at the neutral point of the load may be found by the node 
voltage method, as shown in Figure 8.60, and once this voltage is known the line cur-
rents may be readily determined.

These line currents (which are the same as the phase currents for the wye load) are

8.12  MUTUAL INDUCTANCE AND TRANSFORMERS
8.12.1  Fundamental Considerations
We saw in Chapter 6 that when a coil of wire produces magnetic flux which links that 
same coil, there is a self-inductance, and by the Faraday law a voltage 
/
Ldi dt is devel-
oped when the current changes with time. Here, we will examine the self-inductance 
FIGURE 8.61  Phasor diagrams for an unbalanced wye–wye system.

in more detail and then extend those ideas to the situation involving two coils linked 
by some common magnetic flux (a transformer with mutual inductance M).
Consider a single coil wrapped on a core of magnetic medium as shown in 
Figure 8.62.
If the magnetic medium is linear, then the magnetic flux φ (in Wb) is given by

current in the coil, and  is the permeance of the core (Wb/A). By the Faraday law,

 is the flux linkage (Wb) and L is the self-inductance (H). Now ­consider 
the case of two magnetically-couple coils on the same magnetic core as shown in 
Figure 8.63. A voltage 1v  is applied to the primary (input) coil, resulting in a current 
1i . The secondary (output) coil is open-circuited, so no current flows in it, but there is 
an induced voltage 2v .

8.12.2  The Dot Convention for Polarities
When solving circuits that contain magnetically-coupled coils (transformers), 
a system of dots is used so that the polarities of mutual inductance terms may be 
determined unambiguously. The placement of these dots is dictated by the physical 
construction of the transformer, and the process for finding the dot placements may 
be understood with the aid of Figure 8.64.
The process starts by arbitrarily placing a dot on one terminal of the primary coil; 
we will place this dot on the top terminal. Second, we flow current 1i  into this dotted 
terminal and use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the resulting flux 1φ  in 
the core. In this case, it is clockwise as shown in the figure. Third, we flow current 
2i  into either terminal of the secondary and find the resulting flux in the core by the 
right-hand rule. Here, we flow current into the top terminal of the secondary and 
this results in clockwise flux 
2
φ . Finally, if the flux directions for 1φ  and 
2
φ  are the 
same, we dot the terminal where 2i  enters. In this case, we dot the top terminal of the 
secondary, so both top terminals are dotted. Now we know that if 
/
1
di
dt is positive, 
FIGURE 8.63  Two magnetically-coupled coils on a single core.

363
Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
inducing a positive value of 
1v  (positive at the dot) by way of the self-inductance, 
it will also induce a positive value of 
2v  (positive at the dot) by way of the mutual 
inductance.
To further explore the application of the dot convention in finding polarities of 
voltage terms in a circuit containing a transformer, refer to Figure 8.65.
The primary voltage is given by
	
.

M di

(8.211)
The sign of the mutual inductance term comes about because if 
/
2
di
dt is positive it 
induces a self-inductance component of 2v  which is negative at the secondary dot and 
also produces a mutual inductance component of 1v  which is negative at the primary 
dot. This is therefore a negative contribution to 1v . By similar reasoning, the second-
ary voltage is given by

8.12.3  The Linear Transformer in the Phasor Domain
Although the previous section used time-domain mesh equations (differential equa-
tions) to illustrate the use of the dot convention, we will normally apply impedance 
and phasor concepts for the AC steady-state analysis of circuits involving transform-
ers using algebraic equations. Figure 8.66 illustrates a phasor-domain representa-

8.12.4  The Ideal Transformer
Often an ideal transformer model may be used to analyze transformer circuits with 
satisfactory accuracy. The three attributes of an ideal transformer are the following: 
(i) the coupling coefficient is unity, so that M
L L
=
1
2 ; (ii) the self-inductances are 
infinite; and (iii) the coil losses due to resistance are negligible. Therefore for an 
ideal transformer such as the one shown in Figure 8.68, there is no need to specify 
the self or mutual inductances, and instead we specify the turns ratio, which may be 
expressed in the form N
N
:
1
2 or as a voltage ratio V
V
:
1
2.
Using the reference polarities and dot placement in Figure 8.68, the basic relation-
ships for the ideal transformer are

Therefore, a transformer which steps up the voltage will step down the current, and 
vice versa.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
8.13  SUMMARY
In a circuit driven by one or more sinusoidal sources with a particular frequency, we 
may use AC steady-state analysis to determine the voltages and currents. The volt-
ages and currents are all sinusoidal with the same frequency as the source(s) so we 
only need to find their magnitudes and phases. In order to avoid the need to solve dif-
ferential equations in the time domain, we transform to the phasor domain. Passive 
components are replaced with complex impedances; the impedance of a resistor is R, 
the impedance of an inductor is j
L
ω , and the impedance of a capacitor is 
j C
ω
(
)
1/
. 
The real part of an impedance Z is a resistance R and the imaginary part is j times a 
reactance X, so that in general Z
R
jX
=
+
. Impedances combine in series and paral-
lel like resistances. Voltages and currents are treated as complex phasors. The pha-
sor has a magnitude and a phase, which corresponds to the magnitude and phase 
in the time domain. A phasor may be expressed in polar or rectangular form and 
may be plotted visually on the complex plane in a phasor diagram. In the phasor 
domain, Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws apply. Therefore, we may use the node volt-
age method, the mesh current method, the current-divider rule, the voltage-divider 
rule, and Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems in the phasor domain for AC steady-state 
analysis.
The instantaneous power for an element in a circuit with sinusoidal excitation is 
sinusoidal with a frequency twice the frequency of the source(s). Of more interest 
than the instantaneous power are the average power P and the reactive power Q. 
The complex power S embodies both quantities: S
P
jQ
=
+
. To find the complex 
power for an element, we multiply the phasor voltage by the conjugate of the current: 
S = VI*. For this calculation, both the current and the voltage should be in root mean 
square (rms) form, and the passive sign convention should be applied to determine 
whether a minus sign should be applied in the complex power equation.
For maximum power transfer from a two-terminal network to a load impedance, 
the load impedance should be set to the conjugate of the Thevenin impedance for 
the two-terminal network. If there are constraints on Z
R
jX
L
L
L
=

 which make this 
impossible, then the load reactance should be set as close as possible to X
−
Th, and 
then the load resistance should be set as close as possible to R

Three-phase circuits and systems are commonly used for power transmission 
and distribution. They make use of three sinusoidal sources at 120° intervals, which 
decreases transmission losses significantly and improves efficiency. Sources and 
loads may be connected in wye or delta configurations, leading to four basic combi-
nations. Other configurations are possible if transformers are connected to the source 
or the load. Three-phase systems may be analyzed using mesh or nodal analysis.
Transformers utilize two or more coils which are magnetically coupled to step 
up or step down a voltage using the mutual inductance between the coils. In a linear 
transformer, the mutual inductance is used in the time or phasor domain to write 
mesh equations. For an ideal transformer, only the turns ratio of the transformer is 
used to find approximate currents and voltages. In either case, mesh analysis is pre-
ferred and nodal analysis may be cumbersome.

9 Frequency Response
9.1  INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapter, we considered the ac steady-state analysis of circuits oper-
ating with sinusoidal excitation at a single frequency. When there were multiple 
sources, they were all considered to operate at the same frequency so we could treat 
the impedances of capacitors and inductors as constants. If we had multiple sinu-
soidal sources operating at different frequencies, we could apply the same concepts 
with each source and use superposition to find the overall time-domain voltages and 
currents in the circuit. Often, however, we have signals that are non-sinusoidal or 
non-periodic. Such signals can be considered to be built from sinusoidal components, 
so the response of a circuit to such general signals can be understood by finding its 
response to sinusoids as a function of frequency. In this chapter, we will therefore 
explore the frequency response of circuits containing reactive components such as 
capacitors and inductors.
To determine the frequency response of a two-port network with an input and an 
output, we first find the transfer function H, which is the ratio of the phasor output 
voltage to the phasor input voltage: H
out
in
= V
V
/
. In general, this will be a complex 
quantity that varies with frequency. The amplitude response, or gain, of the circuit is 
the magnitude of the transfer function as a function of frequency:

Taken together, the amplitude response and phase response specify the frequency 
response of a circuit.
Generally, circuits will exhibit frequency-dependent behavior whether or not 
it is desirable, because of the presence of reactive components. However, we may 
design circuits to achieve specific frequency-dependent behavior, and such circuits 
are called filters.
Broadly, filters may be designed to achieve four types of behavior. A low-pass 
­filter allows low-frequency components to pass through while blocking high-­
frequency components of the signal. There is a transition from the low-frequency 
391

392
A Practical Introduction to Electrical Circuits
range (the passband) to the high-frequency range (the stopband) at the cutoff fre-
quency. A high-pass filter allows high frequencies to pass while blocking low fre-
quencies, again with a transition at the cutoff frequency. The bandpass filter passes 
a band of frequencies while blocking both higher and lower frequencies. It therefore 
has two cutoff frequencies. A bandstop (or notch) filter blocks only a band of fre-
quencies but passes lower and higher frequencies. Like the bandpass filter, it has two 
cutoff frequencies.
The cutoff frequency for a filter is defined to be the half-power frequency; in 
other words, the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the power delivered to a 
resistive load has dropped to half its value in the passband. (If there are two or more 
cutoff frequencies, the half-power criterion applies to each.) The power delivered to 
a resistive load is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the output voltage.

so the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the gain has dropped to 1/

and the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the gain in dB has dropped by 3dB 
relative to the passband. (It is the −3dB frequency.)
Filters may be realized in passive circuitry (using only passive components such 
as resistors, inductors, and capacitors) or in active circuitry (using active devices such 
as operational amplifiers and transistors as well as passive devices). In the following 
sections, we will investigate a few example filter circuits, both passive and active 
types, to illustrate the general principles of frequency response analysis. However, 
the same general approach may be applied to other filters as well, even if they involve 
higher order and much greater complexity.

and capacitors). An example is the first-order resistor-capacitor (RC) low-pass filter 
shown in Figure 9.1.

see that this is the −3dB frequency. The passband gain is unity (0dB) and the stop-
band slope is −6dB/octave or −20dB/decade. (An octave is a factor of two change in 
frequency while a decade is a factor of ten change in frequency.)

Frequency Response
Figure 9.4 shows the amplitude and phase response for an RC first-order high-pass 
filter with R = 1000Ω and C = 100nF, with fc = 1.59kHz. As for the low-pass filter, 
the passband gain is unity (0dB) but the stopband slope is positive (6dB/octave or 
20dB/decade).
Passive filters of higher order may be constructed as well. For example, the circuit 
of Figure 9.5 is a second-order low-pass filter.
The transfer function for this filter may be found by use of the node voltage

Figure 9.7 shows the amplitude and phase response for the second-order filter circuit 
with R = 1000Ω and C = 100nF. Although the corner frequency (the frequency where 
the two straight-line pieces of the amplitude response appear to meet) is 1.59kHz, this 
corner frequency is not the same as the cutoff frequency. This is because the response 
at the corner frequency is −6 dB, and the actual cutoff frequency is approximately 
600 Hz and we can see that this is the −3dB frequency. The passband gain is unity  
(0dB) and the stopband slope is twice that for the first-order filter (−12dB/octave 
or −40dB/decade).

9.3  ACTIVE FILTERS
Active filters are commonly built using operational amplifiers, although they may 
also be designed with discrete transistors. In either case, these filter circuits are most 
easily analyzed using the node voltage method.
9.3.1  Sallen and Key Low-Pass Filter
As an example of an active filter, consider the Sallen and Key low-pass filter shown 
in Figure 9.8.
When writing the node voltage equations, we note that the voltage at the  
non-inverting input of the op amp is equal to 
out

 because of the virtual short. Thus,

9.4  SUMMARY
In circuits with reactive components (capacitors and inductors), the phasor voltages 
and currents vary with frequency. Filters are circuits designed to be frequency 
­selective in a desired fashion. Broadly speaking, there are four basic types of filters: 
low pass, high pass, bandpass, and bandstop. Filters may be further character-
ized as passive or active; a passive filter uses only passive components (resistors, 
capacitors, inductors) whereas an active filter also contains active components such 
as transistors or operational amplifiers. The transfer function H for a filter is the 
phasor ratio of the output and input voltages: H
out
in
= V
V
/
. Generally, the transfer 
function for a circuit may be found by the use of the node voltage method. The 
amplitude response is the magnitude of H as a function of frequency. The phase 
response is the phase angle of H as a function of frequency. Together, the ampli-
tude response and phase response make up the frequency response of the filter. 
Often, the amplitude response is plotted in decibel (dB) units, where the amplitude 
response in dB is 
H
20log10
. The cutoff frequency for a filter is the half-power 
or −3dB frequency. If a filter has more than one cutoff frequency, this criterion 
applies to each.

9.1 in ebook+ or Example Exam 9.2 in ebook+.

150 Ω, and 1.5 kΩ are all standard values. The adjacent values differ by approxi-
mately 10% so the ranges will meet or overlap slightly.

Ceramic Capacitors
Capacitor values are generally given in pF (1 pF = 10−12 F). A ceramic capacitor will 
typically give its value using three numbers; the first two represent digits and the 
third is a multiplier. For example, “223” designates 22,000 pF or 22 nF as shown in 
Figure App D.1.

APPENDIX E
Electrolytic Capacitors
Electrolytic capacitors generally give their capacitance in μF as in the example 
shown in Figure App E.1. Also given on the case is the voltage rating and the polar-
ity (for polarized capacitors). It is important to not reverse the polarity across an 
electrolytic capacitor; it may evolve hydrogen gas, explode, and cause personal 
injury.

APPENDIX F
Complex Numbers
In order to solve AC circuits algebraically, without the need for differential equa-
tions, we will make extensive use of complex numbers and complex mathematics. 
It should be understood that this represents a system of shortcuts and that we are 
using complex quantities to represent real circuit elements, real currents, and real 
voltages. Nonetheless, working with complex quantities is a critical part of sinusoidal 
steady-state analysis so we will review their mathematics.
A complex number 
+
A
jB involves a real component A and an imaginary com-
ponent, jB, where j is the imaginary unit,1 =
−

shown on the complex plane using Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates or polar coor-
dinates of the form 
θ

, as shown in Figure App F.1.

APPENDIX G
Cramer’s Method
When using the node-voltage method or the mesh-current method, we need to solve 
systems of simultaneous equations. One way to do this is by Cramer’s method. 
Cramer’s method is a matrix approach which is convenient when solving either sym-
bolically, as when finding a transfer function, or numerically, as when finding spe-
cific voltages. Other matrix approaches may be used as well, and in general, these 
are more convenient than substitution or subtraction when solving three or more 
equations. These other approaches are discussed in detail in books on linear algebra. 
Here though, we focus on Cramer’s method, which is used throughout this book for 
solving node and mesh equations.
Suppose we need to solve a system of two equations involving two unknowns x1 
and x2:

(G.3)
To solve for each of the unknowns, we calculate a ratio of determinants. When find-
ing the first unknown x1, the numerator is the determinant of a modified matrix 
involving the replacement of the first column by the matrix B, and the denominator 
is the determinant of the original matrix:

When finding the second unknown x2, the numerator is the determinant of a modi-
fied matrix involving the replacement of the second column by the matrix B, and the 
denominator is the determinant of the original matrix:

The method of finding a determinant is explained in Figures App G.1 and App G.2. 
For a 2 × 2 matrix as shown in Figure App G.2, we simply subtract the NE-SW 
diagonal product from the NW-SE diagonal product, and a numerical example is 
given on the right. For a matrix of dimension 3 × 3 or greater, we first concatenate the 
matrix with itself before finding the diagonal products, as shown in Figure App G.2. 
Although a 3 × 3 example is shown, this same general procedure applies to matrices 
of higher dimension.
