Need to Know
8 2 - 15 November 2016
What happened?
A massive internet outage was caused
by hacked ‘Internet of Things’ devices,
security researchers have revealed.
Many popular websites were felled
during the huge distributed-denial-of-
service (DDOS) attack, which entails
massive amounts of web traffic being
targeted at a site or service to knock it
offline. In this case, the target was
domain-registration service Dyn, a
provider to web giants including Twitter,
Netflix, Spotify, Amazon and Reddit,
and the government’s portal Gov.uk
(www.gov.uk). The attack slowed access
to these sites and, in some instances,
took them offline for a short while.
It’s not clear who instigated the attack,
but it was carried out via a botnet called
Mirai. Most botnets link insecure,
infected PCs, using them to send spam,
distribute malware or run denial-of-
service attacks. Instead of hacking PCs
to power its nefarious activities, Mirai
builds a botnet from Internet of Things
(IoT) and ‘smart’ home devices – the
cameras, thermostats and other
gadgets we increasingly connect to the
web for our own convenience.
This isn’t the first time Mirai has been
used, and it won’t be the last. The
malicious software was first used
against well-known security researcher
Brian Krebs to target his blog. After that
attack, the hacker who developed
Mirai released its code on the internet,
so any hacker can now use the botnet.
Between that and the weak security of
most IoT devices, we can expect another
Mirai attack to rear its head soon.
How will it affect you?
Aside from Gov.uk, the attack mostly
took down services in the US. Most Brits
probably didn’t notice the outages but
that doesn’t mean this is a problem for
our American friends alone.
Not only could such an attack be used
anywhere, but it was powered by hacked
IoT and smart home gadgets such as
thermostats, IP cameras and even digital
video recorders, and there’s nothing to
stop similar devices in your own home
from being used in such attacks.
The Mirai botnet searches the web for
connected devices, trying factory-set
usernames and default passwords
against the login. If it succeeds, it can
use your smart home device as a
weapon against the web. That not only
affects the direct victims of the denial-
of-service onslaught, but could see your
broadband slow to a crawl as hackers
abuse your bandwidth in their attack.
For this reason, it’s essential to
protect your gadgets against hackers.
If your smart device is accessed via
a login, you should change it from the
default password in the app or web
page you use to control the device.
That won’t prevent all attacks, but it
should stop Mirai using your device.
You can also buy a router with built-in
security and additional hardware
protection, such as F-Secure’s Sense,
which adds a layer of protection for
smart home devices and your home
network.
What do we think?
Hardware developers should be
condemned for building a network of
devices that can so easily be abused.
Security researchers, industry experts
and technology journalists have been
warning about the security flaws
inherent in the IoT and smart devices
for years now – and yet manufacturers
have ignored such concerns.
Security needs to be built in by
design. In the case of IoT, default
passwords should have a forced reset,
devices should be prevented from
sending significant amounts of traffic,
and developers shouldn’t leave
backdoors in their own products.
Users can help by changing
passwords, but some products simply
cannot be secured. Those gadgets are
already in our homes and there’s little
we can do other than dispose of them
and replace them.
The industry would do well to come
up with a security kitemark so we know
we’re buying a device that meets certain
minimum requirements. Hopefully, this
incident will encourage better security
for smart gadgets or we’ll be going back
to the safer ‘dumb’ versions.

Need to Know
What happened?
Sky customers can now
register for Sky Mobile,
its forthcoming phone
network that will
piggyback on O2’s.
Last year, Sky signed up
to use O2’s network to
offer mobile contracts to
its millions of TV, home
phone and broadband
users. The company is
focusing on its existing
users, suggesting it sees
mobile contracts more as
an attractive extra for
subscribers than a
standalone service for new
customers. Pre-registration
for the Sky Mobile service
was due on 31 October, so
it should be live now.
How will it affect you?
The move is a big challenge
to BT, Virgin and TalkTalk,
and the competition could
help drive down prices on
bundled packages. It also
could make life easier for
Sky customers, who will be
able to get their mobile
services on the same bill as
their TV, phone and
broadband. Expect to be
bombarded by ads over
the next few months. As
Sky’s UK chief Stephen van
Rooyen said: “There are
literally millions of
customers for us to go
after”.
Prices
haven’t yet
been
revealed,
but you
could be
pleasantly
surprised.
Sky will
probably feel
Register now for
Sky’s phone network
the need to undercut
network-only deals, and
the so-called ‘quad-play’
bundled packages,
comprising broadband, TV,
home phone and mobile
phone. The latter can
include some great deals
– BT, for example, offers a
£5 monthly discount on
mobile packages to its
broadband users, while
TalkTalk provides a free
SIM with 500MB of data a
month in all its phone and
broadband contracts.
The problem with
bundles is it’s difficult to
compare prices and
benefits, so take the time
to shop around and add up
the total costs to ensure
you get the best deal.
What do we think?
Sky has taken its time
moving into the mobile
market, sealing the deal
with O2 in 2015 but waiting
more than a year to sign up
users. It’s been slow in
other areas, such as
TV-streaming, but has
caught up this year. Such
improvements may make
rivals nervous, though Sky
is likely to remain a more
expensive option than
TalkTalk thanks to its
pricier television bundles.
What
happened?
The Local
Government
Association
(LGA) said that
broadband is so
important to
everyday life in
modern Britain
that people on
benefits and low
incomes should get help
paying for speeds of at
least 10Mbps.
It called for this to be
part of the Government’s
broadband Universal Social
Obligation, which aims to
make access to fast speeds
a right on a par with other
essential services such as
electricity and water.
It urged ISPs to offer
subsidised deals to those
“most in need”, pointing to
BT Basic as an example.
This costs £10 a month for
a broadband and phone
line, and is available to
people on benefits. Visit
BT’s website to see if you
qualify: bit.ly/basic409.
The LGA, which
represents more than 370
councils in England and
Wales, says that such
measures are necessary
because many vital
services are now accessible
only through the internet.
Ofcom says there is a link
between socio-economic
deprivation and poor
broadband availability
in cities.
How will it affect you?
Such a plan could help
pensioners in particular.
The LGA said that one in
four adults lack web skills,
Subsidise broadband
for society’s poorest
and while many seniors are
able to use the web, many
still need help getting
online. Pensioners don’t
automatically receive BT
Basic, but those getting
Pension Credit can apply.
What do we think?
With one in seven UK
pensioners living in poverty
(according to Age UK),
cheaper broadband is
urgently needed. ISPs
should offer discounts to
those on benefits, with
Government subsidies
covering some of the cost.
The Government is right to
move more of its services
online, but should
recognise the
disadvantages to those
who can’t afford
broadband. We hope it
listens to the LGA and
announces measures in the
Autumn Statement on 23
November.
Some analysts say that
10Mbps is too slow for a
minimum speed, but that’s
only true for streaming
video and playing games.
10Mbps is fast enough to
access most basic
websites, and a realistic
speed for the LGA to
suggest. Anything faster
may cost too much money.

Need to Know
FIRST LOOK
10 2 - 15 November 2016
After years of collaborating with other
manufacturers on Nexus phones,
Google has finally made its own – the
much-hyped Pixel. There are two
models - the Pixel (from £599) and its
jumbo-sized brother, the Pixel XL
(from £719). Both carry hefty price
tags, but they’re more than up to the
task of taking on the leading phones
from Sony, Samsung and Motorola.
The only difference between the
two models is the XL’s larger screen
and battery. They both run Android 7.1
Nought, use Qualcomm’s latest
quad-core 2.15GHz Snapdragon 821
processor and have 4GB of RAM,
making them two of the fastest
phones you can buy. Only the iPhone
featureless white exterior – and the
combination of glossy glass and
matte aluminium on the back is
jarring, and attracts fingerprints and
hairline scratches.
Another drawback is that the phone
has no expandable storage, so you’ll
need to decide between the 32GB
and – for an extra £100 – 128GB
models. You also have to be careful
when using it at the beach because
it’s not waterproof (so no selfies while
snorkelling).
We’ll test the Pixel more thoroughly
soon, but our first impression is that
while it’s an excellent phone, and a
worthy successor to the Nexus, it
doesn’t do enough to justify spending
£600. Instead you should consider
the OnePlus 3 (oneplus.net/uk/3),
which can do almost exactly the same
at half the price.
What happened?
Major high-street banks have failed to
provide sufficient security steps to
safeguard their customers against
scams, new research suggests. A report
by Which? found that many online
banking services lack ‘two-factor
authentication’ at login, where
customers are required to provide a
memorable answer or password,
alongside a single-use code from a
mobile app or authenticator.
In a test of 11 bank websites, only five
provided adequate security steps to
protect customer accounts. Halifax,
Lloyds Bank, Santander and TSB were
all criticised by the report for providing
insufficient protection, despite having
the technology to impose two-step
verification, according to Which?
research conducted in August.
TSB was found to be the worst
offender, with a total online protection
score of 56%, with Santander only
slightly better. Hackers need only bypass
one level of security to gain access to
account details, which scammers then
use to contact customers in the guise of
a bank employee, potentially gaining
further access to savings.
This year, several banks, including
Barclays and HSBC, improved security
by implementing telephone voice
authentication. This news was welcomed
by security specialists campaigning for
Banks fail to protect us from online fraud
safer biometric authentication, and a
move away from passwords.
A Barclays spokesperson said its
customers can get free cybersecurity
services from Kaspersky, adding: “We
have no higher priority than the
protection of our customers’ funds and
data. Customers can be reassured that
the digital banking service they use
carries the highest level of recognised
cybersecurity protection.”
How will it affect you?
This is worrying news if, like millions of
other Brits, you use the web to manage
your bank account, and your bank is one
of those “named and shamed” by
Which?. Using two-factor authentication
makes logging into your account more
hassle, but it’s an effective means of
foiling hackers who may have obtained
your banking password. If your bank
isn’t offering this simple but reliable
security option, it might be time to
switch to one that does.
What do we think?
Considering the number of high-profile
hacks and security breaches that have
occurred in 2016, banks have a
responsibility to offer the best
protection possible against online fraud.
The likes of TSB and Santander certainly
aren’t short of money (pardon the pun),
so they should implement two-factor
authentication as soon as possible.
7 and the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge
scored better in speed tests. However,
nothing beats the Pixel’s 12-megapixel
camera. We found it took incredibly
detailed photos, even in low light.
The only problem is that the Pixel is
one of the ugliest phones we’ve ever
seen. Its front is bland – there’s just

If you often leave the house without your keys, tablet or
laptop, Mr Fox’s leather bag could be an essential
purchase. It not only comes with a handy built-in battery
to charge these devices on the go, but also sends an alert
to your phone if you leave something important behind. Simply attach one of its
Bluetooth tags to each of your valuables, install the Mr Fox mobile app and it
takes care of the rest. The campaign is looking to raise £80,000 by 18 November.
Pledging £240 will entitle you to a Mr Fox bag (black, tan or dark brown).
When we asked this
question in Issue 380
(September 2015), we
quoted Netflix’s chief
product officer Neil
Hunt who said that
offline viewing was not
“a very compelling
proposition”. He
admitted it was a
frequently requested
feature, but thought it
would make using
Netflix too complicated.
Well, a lot can change in 12 months
(just ask David Cameron). According to
one industry insider, Netflix will add a
download option “by the end of the
year”. That comes from Dan Laitz, chief
operating officer at Penthera, a company
that makes software for downloading
video. Speaking to the website Light
Reading, he said: “We know from our
sources within the industry that Netflix
is going to launch this product”.
Some technology analysts agree with
Laitz. Dan Rayburn from US consultants
Frost & Sullivan told Light Reading that
Netflix’s plans are an “open secret”.
However, he said that not all of Netflix’s
content will be available to download.
For example, restrictions from film
studios will prevent the company from
offering many movies. However, Netflix
will be free to offer its own TV shows,
including House of Cards and Orange is
the New Black.
Will Netflix introduce
offline viewing?

Sometimes a bland press
statement gives a lot away.
Responding to these rumours,
Netflix spokesperson Anne Marie
Squeo said: “While our focus
remains on delivering a great
streaming experience, we are
always exploring ways to make
the service better”. Compare that
with what Cliff Edwards, Netflix’s
director of corporate
communications and technology,
said in 2014: offline viewing is
“never going to happen”. The
implication is that downloadable
content on Netflix is just around
the corner. Offline viewing could
be here within months, in the US
at least. The UK might have to
wait a bit longer.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
Robert Capps, an
expert in biometrics
and behavioural
security at NuData
(https://
nudatasecurity.com)
Q
Do you think
biometrics (such
as fingerprints)
and behavioural
techniques (like
recognising how
someone swipes a
screen) will ever replace
passwords completely?
Nigel Cartwright, via email
Ghost Push malware
haunts old Android devices
More than half of all Android devices
could still be vulnerable to malware
discovered two years ago, new
research has found. Ghost Push
malware, which has evolved since its
release in 2014, affects devices
running up to version five of Android
(codenamed Lollipop). This accounts
for around 57% of all users, according
to researchers at Chinese firm
Cheetah Mobile.
Ghost Push can’t work on the two
most recent versions of Android –
Marshmallow and Nougat – but this
accounts for only 10% of users.
Cheetah Mobile found that most
infections come from apps installed
from sources other than the Google
Play store. Once installed on a device,
Ghost Push shows pornographic
pages and malicious adverts. Clicking
these pages and ads leads to more
malware being installed.
A
I don’t believe
passwords are going
to vanish any time
soon because consumers are
familiar with typing a
username and password to
interact online, and there
have been few, if any,
successful products that
have tried to change this.
Biometrics shows promise,
but there have been concerns
over privacy, and questions
about the appropriateness
and reliability of such
techniques when used online.
Where biometrics is more
successful is in quickly
evaluating a person in a
face-to-face situation, where
the authenticating party
controls both the enrolment
of the actual user and the
environment (including the
hardware).
For the forseeable future,
both biometrics and
behavioural techniques will
be used to extend the
lifespan of the current
username-and-password
systems, until we can design
better, less risky methods to
authenticate users. Only then
will we be able to begin
getting rid of passwords.
Q
Can behavioural
methods adapt
to a person
developing a medical
condition, such as
Parkinson’s?
William Fuller, via email
A
Behavioural
methods are
actually quite
sensitive to physical
conditions that gradually
appear. Ageing, for
example, will subtly alter
how people interact with
the technology around
them, and behavioural
systems adapt to these
changes. They are less able
to handle rapid and sudden
changes to how a person
behaves, whether it’s from
illness, injury, or a disability.
But these can be dealt with
appropriately within the
methods that companies
use to challenge users who
cannot be correctly
identified.

Microsoft: young people
more likely to be scammed
Microsoft has warned the public that the
infamous ‘tech support’ scam remains
widespread, and that a “startling”
number of 18-34 year olds fall victim.
The fraud is executed via a phonecall
claiming to be from a member of
Microsoft’s tech-support team. The caller
says that they need to remotely access
your PC to remove an infection. If you
provide this, they try to steal money from
your bank account.
Scammers have typically targeted
older PC users, but new research from
Microsoft shows that they are having
just as much success with the so-called
“millennial” generation.
As part of National Cyber Security
Awareness Month (in October),
Microsoft surveyed thousands of
people worldwide, finding that 50% of
people who “continued with a
fraudulent interaction” were aged
between 18 to 34. You can read

‘Friend’
Reviews by David Crookes
Friends Against Scams
www.friendsagainstscams.org.uk
Figures suggest that scams – online, on
the phone, by letter or in person – cost
consumers up to £10bn each year. To
raise awareness and “empower
communities”, the National Trading
Standards Scams Team has set up this
campaigning site. It offers well-judged
advice on how to treat victims of scams,
and sends fortnightly emails warning you
about scammers’ increasingly devious
tactics. To get involved in the campaign,
you can become a ‘Friend Against
Scams’ by attending an awareness
session (details are listed) or host a
session and become a ‘ScamChampion’.
One level up are ScamAmbassadors
– MPs and influential public figures.
Maserati
www.maserati.co.uk
This redesigned website for the luxury
car maker Maserati delivers an intricate
fact-packed breakdown of each car,
interspersed with sparkling, well-shot
photos. It also injects a good dollop of
fun for true petrolheads – you can listen
to the various engine noises, for example,
and “build your own” Maserati (you’re
not given the £80k to buy it, though!),
which you can save to tweak the design
later. Other features include a bustling
news section, a shop selling various
merchandise and – best of all, in our view
– an interesting in-depth look at the
history of the 102-year-old company.

The Earth Awaits
www.theearthawaits.com
Ever fancied living abroad but aren’t sure where? Just ask this site. After submitting
the size of your budget and family, the kind of apartment you want to live in, your
typical lifestyle and your tolerance for crime and pollution, it quickly scours data
pulled from Wikipedia, the United Nations and public databases to find what it
considers to be your best matches (Irvine in California, in our case – see above). You
can also see the cost of living, which is updated daily, and what kind of weather you
could expect. It needs to add more cities to become a genuinely useful tool, and you
can’t manually search for specific locations, but it’s good escapist fun nonetheless.

Financial Times

The website for The Financial Times, like
the Daily Mail, is very popular and the
success of its paywall is due to its niche
content – people who work in finance are
willing to pay to stay up to date with the
latest news. The revamped site is now

Bloomberg
Technology
www.bloomberg.com/technology
Bloomberg primarily reports business
news but its technology coverage has
increased in recent months, culminating
in this launch. The striking, modern look
differentiates it from the rest of the
Bloomberg site and although the design
is cluttered and too hyperactive, there’s
more than enough content to whet your
appetite. We particularly like the live web
shows, insightful videos and informed
analysis, despite the obvious (and
understandable) US bias. The 20-minute
podcast, Decrypted, shows great
promise, even after just one episode.
Mail Shop
www.mailshop.co.uk
Not content with running the most
visited English-language newspaper
website in the world, the Daily Mail is
now branching into retail. This web store

some of which has recently appeared in

(kitchen, bedroom and so on) or browse
product categories (furniture, Christmas,
cooking & dining). For ideas and news on

The 18
http://the18.com
Presumably named after the 18-yard box,
this US-based football site covers the
beautiful game with as much flair as a
Messi dribble and a Ronaldo stepover. It
mixes news of US football (or ‘soccer’)
with what’s happening internationally, so
you can watch videos that entertain
(great goals, crazy incidents) and
educate (skills, fitness), take part in fun
quizzes and read serious analytical
stories and transfer rumours. We love the
Free Kick button, which trawls the site
for something random, but there are too
many large photos, so 90 minutes of
action could entail endless scrolling and
leave you sidelined with an injury.
eBay Seller Centre
Sellercentre.ebay.co.uk
With 18 million registered buyers in the
UK, eBay remains a very popular online
marketplace. But online shoppers have
much higher expectations now than they
did when eBay launched in 1999, so a
new Seller Centre is very welcome. Its
main aim is to help sellers create “the
perfect listing”, thereby boosting the
price you get for an item. There are
around 300 articles so far, including
valuable tips on how to respond to
buyers’ feedback and details of the
protection eBay offers to sellers. It’s split
into advice for private individuals and

As one of the 20th Century’s major
poets, playwrights and essayists, TS Eliot
has inspired generations of writers. His
legacy has now moved online with a
stylishly minimalist website, managed by
his estate and publisher, that lets you
explore his canon. You can read his works
in full or as excerpts, see rare photos
from his life and examine important
documents, including the telegram from
the Nobel committee inviting Eliot to the
1948 ceremony, where he won the prize
for literature. Many visitors will be drawn
by the hundreds of unpublished letters,
with the tantalising promise of more
being added in the future.

Forager’s Gin
foragersgin.co.uk
Set up in 2015, Snowdonia Distillery has
started selling its first product: Forager’s
Gin. This site explains how it’s made in
the foothills of the Welsh mountain range
and lets you book private tasting
sessions. You can find out where it’s sold
or buy it yourself from the site (£40 for a
70cl bottle). That’s not cheap, so you’ll
need to know what it tastes like before
committing. But until the technology
exists to download a sip, you’ll have to
make do with the site’s poetic
description. Apparently, Forager’s Gin
starts by releasing “soft juniper tones” on
your tongue, then takes you to “fresh,
semi-sweetness of apple and elderberry”.

Keith Walker, via email
A
WordPress is a widely adopted CMS
(content management system)
that’s stable, reliable and easy to
use. But whether you’re building a blog or
a corporate website, there are many other
options that have thousands of plugins and
templates, and are supported by a wide
community of users. In terms of web design,
I would consider a static site generator such
as Nanoc (nanoc.ws). It’s quite technical, but
it’s powerful and gives total freedom to
customise a website. The generated pages
don’t require premium hosting packages,
keeping the maintenance on a local machine
and mirroring modified pages via FTP.

O
riginally, all Chromebooks were affordable laptops costing around
£200. This would buy you a model good enough to run the
lightweight Chrome OS well, as long as you didn’t overburden the
browser with too many open tabs. Google changed the landscape in
2013 when it launched the vastly more expensive Google Chromebook
Pixel. This also runs the Chrome OS but on hardware designed to rival
the best laptops around.
The decision now facing anyone who wants to buy a Chromebook
is whether an affordable model is enough to suit your needs, or whether
it’s worth forking out a lot more to get a super-specified laptop.
In this Group Test, we compare three affordable Chromebooks with
two of the pricier models to see which of them provides the best value
for money.
Acer’s Chromebook R11 has the
smallest screen of all the devices
reviewed here, but because it’s a
touchscreen and the keyboard can fold
back under itself, the R11 also works as a
tablet. At 1.2kg, it’s light enough to hold
comfortably with one hand and, at
20mm, it’s reasonably thin, too.
Despite its compact size, the R11
provides a good selection of ports, with
two USB ports (one each for USB 2 and
USB 3) and an HDMI port for connecting it to
an external display. There’s also an SD card
reader and a 3.5mm headset
jack. Although it doesn’t
have an Ethernet port,
802.11ac Wi-Fi is built in.
The keyboard spans nearly the full
width of the laptop’s chassis, so it doesn’t feel
cramped. We found that the touchpad required a
little more force than was comfortable to register
a click, but you can tap it instead and anyway, we
think you’ll get a lot of use from the touchscreen,
even when the keyboard is operable.
The laptop runs cool and quiet, thanks to its
fanless design and low-power 1.6GHz Intel
Celeron N3050 processor. It only comes with
2GB of RAM (and 16GB of drive space) but we
had no problems running individual web apps
and things only slowed down when we opened a
lot of tabs with video or ads running in them. As
long as you keep a check on your open tabs,
everything should run smoothly.
The compact size of the R11 means it has a
smaller-capacity battery, so it’s no great surprise
that its battery life was the shortest of all the
devices we tested. It still lasted 8 hours and 42
minutes in our tests, though, which should be
enough to get you through a day’s work if you’re
away from a power socket.
Chromebooks
Is it worth spending over £1,000 on a Chromebook or should you
stick with a budget model? Andy Shaw tests both types
HOW WE TESTED
The Acer Chromebook R11
is an incredibly versatile
device at a fantastic price.
It isn’t the most powerful
Chromebook we tested in
this group, but it’s more
than good enough to
perform its core purpose
of browsing the web and
working with web apps.
The touchscreen is
versatile, too, giving
options for scrolling
and pressing buttons
on websites with your
fingers, rather than using
the touchpad. The option
of folding it all the way
back into tablet mode is a
welcome bonus.

We put the Chromebooks through a variety of
tests. We measured their overall performance
by running web-based benchmarks including
SunSpider (bit.ly/suns409) and JetStream (bit
.ly/jets409). We also used a colorimeter to test
the quality of the screen.
Finally, we ran our battery-life test, which
measures how long a fully charged device can
play a looping video before running out of juice.

Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
The Chromebook Pixel is the best
Chromebook money can buy, but it’s very
expensive. Availability is getting thin,
though, so the price is creeping up and we
only found stock through Amazon.
It has 32GB of storage – twice
as much as our award-winning
Chromebooks – and includes 1TB of
Google Drive storage. Its SD slot is
designed for the card to sit flush with the edge,
so you can leave it in permanently without risk of it catching.
As you’d expect for this price, the build-quality of the
hardware is stunning, with a superb keyboard and touchpad.
But the Pixel’s crowning glory is its 12.9in, 2,560 x 1,700 pixels
touchscreen display: contrast and brightness are superb, and
it can produce 91.6% of the sRGB colour palette.
Performance was impressive, too, with the Pixel’s fast
processor and 16GB of RAM outperforming every other
Chromebook we tested. The battery didn’t suffer, either,
lasting the longest in this group at 10 hours and 53 minutes.
Like the Pixel (left), Dell’s Chromebook 13 range brings
Chrome OS to a premium product (and price). We reviewed
Dell’s most expensive model, but there are cheaper versions
with less memory and storage, from around £400.
What you’re getting for your money is a great screen and a
brilliant build quality, though it isn’t quite up to the giddy
heights of the Chromebook Pixel.
Acer’s Chromebook 14 has a slim
aluminium chassis that could fool you into
mistaking it for a MacBook Air. However,
this Chromebook is a lot more
affordable. For £200, you get a 14in
display with a resolution of 1,366
x 768 pixels, an Intel Celeron
processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of
storage. Except for the larger screen, this is
similar to the Gold Award-winning Chromebook R11 and
performance was almost identical in our tests.
The boon of a larger screen is offset by a decrease in quality:
the Chromebook 14 has the same resolution as the R11, but
spread over the extra space it looks less sharp. The brightness,
contrast and colour are also disappointing, leaving the screen
looking dull and washed out. The battery has benefited from
an increase in size, though, lasting 10 hours and 22 minutes in
our tests, which is over 90 minutes more than the R11. It has
two USB 3 ports but is sorely missing an SD card slot.
This latest version of HP’s 14in Chromebook
continues the bold colour scheme of its
predecessor with a sky-blue plastic case.
It weighs 1.69kg and measures 17.8mm at
its thickest point, and feels sturdy and
well built.
It has more RAM (4GB)
and a faster-running
processor than either of the Acer
Chromebooks reviewed here, but this didn’t result in any
significant boost in performance. The battery wasn’t as good
as the Acer Chromebook 14 (9 hours and 14 minutes in our
test), and came second to last in this group.
Like the Acer 14in model, the HP Chromebook 14’s screen is
disappointing. It has a similarly low resolution and its blacks
weren’t particularly dark in our contrast tests. It failed to
produce a sufficient range of sRGB colours, although it fared
slightly better than the screen on the Silver Award-winning
Acer Chromebook 14.

The Chromebook Pixel runs Chrome OS better than anything else, but this feels
like overkill for a lightweight operating system. It’s a beautiful laptop that’s a joy
to use, but the same money could be better spent on a Windows or Mac laptop.
We love the look and feel of the Chromebook 14’s classy metal-clad chassis. The
battery, which is more powerful than the Gold-winning R11’s, is a welcome
addition. However, the screen, though also larger, is disappointing.
The HP Chromebook’s screen is slightly better than the Acer Chromebook 14’s,
but in all other respects – the aluminium finish, better performance and
improved battery life – we preferred our Silver Award Winner.
A well-built Chromebook with more than enough power to run its operating
system with aplomb, but too expensive for our tastes.

OUR VERDICT
Having tried both the affordable and the
expensive Chromebooks, we’d opt for the
cheaper models, unless money really is no
object. For a higher price you get a better
specification but we didn’t feel it was enough
of a leap to justify paying more than four times
as much.
The Acer Chromebook R11 wins our Gold Award
because it’s an incredibly versatile device at
a fantastic price. What it lacks in raw power, it
makes up for with its flexible touchscreen, which
works just as well in both tablet and laptop mode.
Our Silver Award goes to the Acer Chromebook
14. Although its screen was disappointing, it runs
well and has a good battery life.
We preferred the screen on the Bronze
Award-winning HP Chromebook 14,
but it was pipped to the higher
award by the Acer’s performance
and build quality.

The latest version introduces a new
Task Manager and a Force Deleter,
which removes stubborn files locked by
Windows. You can now set the Turbo

7-Zip (www.7-zip.org) is a powerful
compression tool that can handle
most file formats, including Zip,
TAR and RAR. It also makes its
own file-compression format,
called 7z. Easy 7-Zip is a more
user-friendly version of the
software, built using the same
source code. It has the same
features as the original program,
but adds other elements, such as
icons in the context (right-click)
menu, options in the ‘extract’ box,
and a better way of recording
where your files are saved.
This tiny program looks for
duplicate content in your hard
drives. To use it, choose the
locations to search, then select
what you want to look for – all
files, audio files, videos, pictures,
documents, archives, and so on.
Click Search and it will go to
work. When it has finished, it will
present you with its results,
grouped by where they were
found on your computer.
You can preview each file and
switch between folders to
compare them.
This program offers a selection of PDF
tools, all accessible from a single screen.
It performs all the key tasks you’d
expect, including merging PDF files,
adding a header and footer, splitting or
reordering pages, and adding a text or
image watermark. It also reformats
pages, encrypts and decrypts files, and
converts a PDF to an image file.
This latest version adds options to
these tools, but there’s a danger of
installing unwanted extra programs
when you download it. We recommend
deselecting the first and third bonus
products offered.

We love Malwarebytes
Anti-Malware but our love
doesn’t carry across to
StartUpLite. Although it’s
small and portable, which
is a good thing, StartUpLite
failed to find all the
start-up problems we had
installed on our test PC.
This is because it
concentrates solely on
malware and skips the
start-up programs that are
slowing down your PC.
The aim of this 3D walking simulator is
simply to explore some (impressively

Route your connection
through friends’ PCs
UProxy (bit.ly/uproxy409) is a proxy
server with a social-networking twist:
it lets friends route their web
connection through each other’s
computers. You can either create your
own private server and share this with
your friends, or use a friend’s computer
as a proxy server to connect securely to
the web. You can invite your friends to
uProxy via Facebook, GitHub or Gmail.
Free to install and use, uProxy is
currently in beta, but it works fine. You
need to install two components in
Chrome – an extension and an app – and
you’ll be prompted to install one when
you install the other.
There are numerous ways to remove a website from
your browsing history, which is useful if you’re shopping
for a surprise birthday present. However, most of these
methods mean digging deep into your browser’s
settings or using a third-party program to clean up
traces you’ve left behind.
Forget That Page (bit.ly/forget409) is a free Chrome
extension that lets you instantly delete from your
history any web page you happen to be viewing at the
time. It wipes cookies, too, and does it all in a single
click. A message confirming the deletion appears under
the extension’s broom icon to the right of the address
bar (see screen grab).
Forget That Page isn’t exactly a military-grade
solution. Anyone poking their nose into Chrome’s cache
will still be able to find traces of pages you erased. But
for everyday use, it provides a quick and easy way to
keep your browsing history free of unwanted sites.
Focus button for an uninterrupted
25-minute burst of pure
productivity.
Add your face to
screen-capture videos
It’s much better to use images rather
than words when trying to explain a
problem you’re having with your PC,
and recording a screen-capture
video is one of the best ways to do
this. The extension ViewedIt
(https://viewedit.com) lets you also
add a webcam video of your face so
you can explain what’s happening on
screen. Once you’ve recorded your
video, you can paste a link to it in an
email (this works best in Gmail).
When people watch your videos,
you’ll receive emails telling you how
long they watched it for, and which
bits they skipped and re-watched.
The one drawback is that creating
your own private server requires a
DigitalOcean account, which currently
costs $10 (about £9) per month.
Connecting to someone else’s server is
completely free, however.
Block distractions
and get more done
Anyone who reads Web User will know
just how many opportunities for
distraction there are online. Few of
us have the self-discipline required to
resist chatting with friends, watching
hilarious videos of cats, playing games
or just idly browsing through our
favourite sites – especially when there’s
work to be done!
Focus (bit.ly/focus409) is a Chrome
extension that not only lets you
temporarily block distracting websites,
but also presents you with a list of what
you should be doing instead. You can
add any site likely to divert your
attention and build a to-do list of tasks
that need your attention, then click the

Turn websites
into ebooks
Save As eBook (bit.ly/ebook409)
is an ingenious extension that
turns a website into a book, which
you can then read on your tablet,
phone or e-reader. Navigate to a
website you want to convert, then
click the book icon on the toolbar
to export either selected text or
the entire page. If you want to
save multiple web pages, you can
add each one as a chapter, then
select Edit Chapters from the
Save As eBook menu to name
and organise your book.
Exported ebooks are saved in
your Downloads folder as EPUB files, which are compatible with many popular
e-readers and apps, including Google Play Books and Apple’s iBooks.
The developers have flagged up this extension as experimental, so you may
encounter the occasional glitch. There’s definitely room for improvement, but
we were able to create and export ebooks from all the sites we tested, and the
ability to build chapters is a welcome feature. The tool works best when you
manually select the text you want and choose Save Selection (see screen grab),
rather than exporting the entire web page using Save Page, which can include
unwanted clutter.
See URLs in your tabs
We love it when an extension’s name
sums up its function as perfectly as
‘URL in Titlebar’ (bit.ly/titlebar409). We
barely need to explain what it does, but
we’ve got some space to fill, so here
goes: it displays the current web page’s
URL on the titlebar of its tab. Why
would you need that? Well, it can come
in handy when, for example, different
pages on a website have been given the
same title, making it difficult to establish
which tab titlebar refers to which page.
The extension ignores http/https and
Data-sharing apps
named and shamed
Opera has added a
privacy mode to Opera Max
(bit.ly/omax409), its Android
app that lets you monitor your
data usage. It shows you “which

Install Opera
extensions in
Vivaldi
You may already be aware that
the brilliant new browser Vivaldi
supports Chrome extensions,
but did you know it also lets you
install Opera add-ons? To do so,
just head to Opera’s add-on
store (bit.ly/addons409) in
Vivaldi and locate an extension
you want. The ‘Add to Opera’
button will be greyed out,
because you’re not using Opera,
but click it, then click ‘get it
anyway’ to download it. In File
Explorer, change the file’s
extension from ‘.nex’ to ‘.crx’,
then open vivaldi://extensions,
drag your file into the browser
window and click ‘Add
extension’.
OTHER BROWSERS
This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the
most from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more
other prefixes that might otherwise
get in the way.
Instantly scroll to
the top of a page
One of the great things about using
Safari to browse the web on an
iPhone or iPad is that a quick tap at
the top of the screen instantly scrolls
you back to the top of the page. It’s a
fantastic feature that doesn’t seem to
have made its way to Desktop
browsers yet. But there is a way to
replicate it in Firefox using a new, free
add-on called tabScrollTop (bit.ly/
scroll409). With the extension
installed, a quick double-click on the
tab’s titlebar will instantly scroll the
page to the top. Brilliantly simple.

MESSAGING
Signal Private Messenger

bit.ly/signalios409
Min requirements: Android
2.3, iOS 8
Size: 15MB (Android),
36.6MB (iOS)
Signal Private Messenger
is the most successful app
you’ve never heard of. Its
open-source code now
provides end-to-end
encryption (E2EE) in
WhatsApp and Google Allo,
so it’s the privacy power
behind two thrones. But
neither of these big names
can match Signal’s own app,
which sees nothing, stores nothing and
knows the true meaning of ‘delete’. Its latest version even
lets you impose a self-destruct time limit on every message,
photo, video and document you send and receive.
This ‘Disappearing messages’ feature is a masterstroke.
Before or during a conversation, select a time limit – from
five seconds to one week – and all messages and
attachments sent and received in that conversation will be
deleted without a trace at the time limit. A short time limit is
best for sensitive information you don’t want passing eyes
to see. It’s strangely addictive, like Snapchat for grown-ups.
You don’t need (and indeed can’t have) a Signal account
– all you need is a phone number. Signal is so security-
conscious it won’t let you take a screenshot by default,
but this is easy to change in Settings (which is just as well,
or we’d have no Mini Workshop).
It doesn’t back up any messages or photos to the cloud
and if you’re using ‘Disappearing messages’, they’re not
saved on your device, either. However you can manually
save a time-limited photo or attachment with one tap,
as long as you tap it before it
disappears. You can also copy
time-limited messages to your
clipboard before they’re deleted.
Security features aside, Signal
is a really fast, lightweight and
easy-to-use messaging app, with
free calls (also encrypted) and
an in-app camera with video
support. You can now use Signal
in your browser too,
although this
currently only works
with Chrome (bit.ly/
signalchrome409).

36 2 - 15 November 2016
For the first 20 years of the internet’s life
the US decided how web addresses work.
But not any more. David Crookes
considers whether that’s a good thing
The US loses
‘control’ of the web
What’s happened?
The US has ‘surrendered’ control of the
internet. Sort of. Although we generally
see the internet as a free and open
network that isn’t owned by any one
person or entity, some countries have
been able to exert control over certain
aspects of it. The US government, for
example, has long overseen the Domain
Name System (DNS), which plays a vital
role in managing how web addresses
work. But on 1 October, America
relinquished control, placing DNS fully
in the hands of the independent
organisation ICANN (the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, www.icann.org). This ends
the US’s long-standing role as the
symbolic overseer of the world wide web.
Why is this significant?
To understand the implications, it’s worth
looking at how the web works. When you
type a domain name such as www.bbc
.co.uk into a browser, your computer
doesn’t just pluck the website from the
air and display it on your screen. As the
request travels around the connected
computers which make up the internet,
the URL is translated into a series of
numbers that is used to find the correct
server for the site you want. But in order
to do this, there has to be a digital
directory that matches the words of
the URL to the numerical IP address.
It’s this huge master file that the US
has controlled for the past 20 years.
As you can imagine, it’s a pretty crucial
component of the internet.
So how did the US come to
control it?
The list – which includes all domain
suffixes such as .com, .org and .net –
ended up in the hands of the US
Department of Commerce purely
because the internet was developed in
the United States. Their involvement
dates back to the early days of the
internet when an American computer
scientist called Jon Postel began looking
after the DNS in his role administering an
organisation called the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA). In 1998, the
year Postel died, the non-profit Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN) was set up with the
job of overseeing any major changes to
the internet and assigning domain names
and IP address. The US made a decision
to pass over control of the IANA to
ICANN but, at the same time, it ensured
that the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration – which is
part of the Department of Commerce –
would retain a final say over IANA’s role
and actions.
What kind of power did this give
to the US?
In principle, controlling what is effectively
the web’s address book gave the US
the power to censor the internet. With
America having the final say on how the
DNS was controlled, it could, if it wished,
have used that power to remove an entire
domain block from existence – all .org
sites, for example. Similarly, it could have
looked to pull particular sites from the
web or block the creation of some
domains. In reality, the US rarely got
involved in such matters but that’s not
to say it always stood aside. It tried to
prevent ICANN from setting up an .xxx
domain for pornography in 2005, for
instance, although this went ahead
anyway six years later.
So what has the US actually
done with the DNS?
America has allowed the IANA contract
with ICANN to lapse, allowing full control
to pass to ICANN. It has done this safe
in the knowledge that the organisation
is independent, albeit run with the
backing of companies, governments and
academics across the world. With so
many different international bodies
managing the web, the US can no longer
step in and pull the plug, or dictate terms.

ICANN takes control of DNS
2 - 15 November 2016 37
WHO HOLDS ICANN TO ACCOUNT?
Crucially, it also ensures that
no single country controls the
DNS. Most of the world will
hope it stays that way.
Will I see any
difference online?
Nope. In having the IANA
contract since 1998, ICANN
was already running the DNS
and it will continue to do just
that. Your favourite websites
will load just as before.
Could another
government take it
over?
This has been a major concern in the US
ever since the Department of Commerce
announced its intention, in March 2014, to
hand the IANA to ICANN. It’s why the US
said that it would hand over control only
if ICANN implemented reforms to prevent
the internet from falling into the hands of
another government or a commercial
organisation. ICANN agreed to this and
the move went ahead. Yet there has still
been a lot of opposition to the decision,
with some figures accusing President
Obama of “surrendering” control of the
internet. Republican senator Ted Cruz
was among those looking to block the
transfer. He published on YouTube a
video titled ‘We Must Keep the Internet
Free’: www.snipca.com/22140.
What was his problem?
He was worried that America’s decision
to step back leaves the door open for
authoritarian countries to gain more
control of the internet. At a congressional
hearing on 14 September, Cruz said:
“Imagine an internet run like many Middle
Eastern countries that punish what they
deem to be blasphemy. Or imagine an
internet run like China or Russia that
punishes and incarcerates those who
engage in political dissent.” ICANN
says these fears are entirely unfounded
because it doesn’t have the remit
or ability to regulate content on
the internet.
But will China and
Russia try any funny
business?
Understandably, neither
country was happy about the
US controlling DNS, and it’s
possible they will look to exert
a greater influence. Many other
countries, including Turkey,
Iran and North Korea, don’t
allow full access to the web
and they could seek to block
the creation of domains in
the future. But, diplomatically,
the US has been seen to do
the right thing, ensuring such
an important part of the web
is now under no single
government’s control.
Does everyone agree that
ICANN should be in charge?
No. Countries including China, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Egypt wanted
control of the DNS to be handed to
the United Nations’ International
Telecommunications Union (www.itu.int).
The US, UK, Canada and Australia
objected to this because it would mean
governments having too much influence.
By backing a fully independent ICANN,
the US can claim that countries wanting
a different organisation put in control are
against a free and open internet.
All’s good with the world, then?
Not quite. ICANN will still be based
on Waterfront Drive in Los Angeles,
California, and Iran, Brazil and Argentina
are among those pushing for it to be
moved outside the US. Where it goes –
if indeed it does leave the US – will be
hotly contested.
Since ICANN is incorporated
under the law of the State
of California, it will still
remain accountable to the
laws of the United States.
This means it can be taken
to court, and that its
directors must uphold their
duties under corporation
law. But as an international
organisation, it is not bound
by the First Amendment of
the US constitution, which
defends freedom of speech.
The Internet Governance Coalition
(internetgovernancecoalition.com),
which comprises major US tech
companies including Google,
Microsoft, Facebook and Disney, will
be watching the situation closely.
It said that handing control to ICANN
“embodies the very nature of the open
internet we experience today”. But it
also urged caution, saying that “there
is still much work that needs to be
done to ensure the accountability and
transparency of ICANN”.
The Internet Governance Coalition, which includes
Google and Microsoft, will keep a close eye on ICANN

unreasonable restrictions
COVER
FEATURE
T
here’s nothing more frustrating than coming up
against a brick wall when you’re browsing the web.
We’ve all been faced with videos “unavailable in your
country”, ISPs blocking websites and warnings that “your
IP address has been banned”. Sadly, this is becoming
increasingly common as web companies decide exactly
what we can and can’t access online. In this feature, we
reveal how to beat unfair blocks so you can do whatever
you want (within reason!) on the web.
Over the following six pages, we’ll show you how to
access sites blocked by your ISP, watch your favourite
iPlayer programmes from abroad, download apps not yet

restrictions, and more. We’ll also show you how you can

Unblock Sky’s ‘adult
content’ ban
Sky’s ‘Broadband Shield’ automatically
blocks adult content for all new
customers, as a result of proposals
in the UK government’s Digital
Economy Bill. This block is
going to be expanded to
existing Sky customers in
the coming months.
Sky Broadband is among the
first ISPs in the UK to
implement a porn-filtering
BEAT WEBSITE BLOCKS
system. The company says it will
be “automatically switched on the
moment a new customer activates
their Sky Broadband”.
It’s hard to question the motives
of Sky and the Government because
protecting children from online
pornography is vital. But Sky’s filters
are overkill, and have also blocked
some online games, dating sites and
file-sharing services.
How to beat the block
The first time you try to visit
a restricted site, you’ll be given the
option to amend or disable Shield’s
settings (see screen grab on next page).
You can also customise these on the
My Sky site (bit.ly/mysky409).
Alternatively, you can get around
the block by using a VPN such as
TunnelBear (www.tunnelbear.com)
which was recently updated with a
new look (see Workshop 4, Issue 408)
and now has the ability to prioritise
your favourite networks.
Access banned
download sites
From time to time, you might find
Chrome and Firefox blocking access to
popular torrenting sites. This happens
when the site in question gets flagged
as hosting potentially harmful programs
or is branded as a “deceptive site” that
may steal user information. This is a
regular occurrence – access to The
Pirate Bay, for example, was blocked as
recently as the first week in October.
Google’s Safe Browsing technology is
designed to keep you safe on the web,
and is used in Chrome, Firefox and other
browsers. When it decrees a website to
be unsafe, it will display a red warning
page and block access to that site.
ISPs are also blocking download sites,
including KickassTorrents and
RapidMoviez, following court rulings
in favour of the British Phonographic
Industry (BPI) and the Motion Picture
Association (MPA).
How to beat the block
A browser block is usually only
a temporary inconvenience. Wait a
couple of days and access should
resume as normal, although you can get
around the problem at any time. Firefox
users should click ‘Ignore this warning’
to access the site (see screen grab,
below), while Chrome users should click
Details, then ‘Visit this site’. Of course,
it’s possible the site in question has
been blocked for legitimate reasons –
malware in adverts is usually the cause
– so always take precautions when
bypassing the warning.
To beat an ISP block, try visiting
the secure HTTPS version of
a site – https://thepiratebay
.org rather than http://
thepiratebay.org, for
example. If that doesn’t work,
use a VPN to make it look as
if you’re browsing from
outside the UK.
Use video-conversion sites
The video-conversion site YouTubeMP3-org (www.youtube-mp3.org) isn’t
currently blocked, but record labels are seeking a court order that will effectively
put it out of business (read more at bit.ly/tube409). The site, which converts
YouTube videos into MP3 files and which reportedly has over 60 million users
every month, is accused of four counts of copyright infringement (direct,
contributory, vicarious and inducement), as well as “circumvention of
technological measures”, which means breaking YouTube’s rules on copyright.
The world’s biggest record labels, including Universal, Sony and Warner Bros,
are behind the lawsuit, which is seeking $150,000 in compensation for every
alleged act of piracy. It’s asking a federal court in Los Angeles to stop web-
hosting companies and online advertisers “facilitating” access to the site.
How to beat the block
You can continue to use YouTubeMP3-org at the moment, but it’s probably
only a matter of time before the lawsuit has an effect. If it is blocked, you can try
other sites, such
FullRip.net
(www.fullrip.
net, see screen

as song title,

HOW MANY LINKS HAS
GOOGLE REMOVED?
In its Transparency Report, Google
reveals statistics on its removal of
links to news stories. Go to bit.ly/
google409, click ‘Requests to
remove content’ at the top, then
click ‘European privacy in search’.
Here, you’ll see that Google has
received requests to remove links
to 1.7 million URLs. Of those, almost
230,000 are from “individuals with
relationships to the UK”. This places
us third, behind France (354,000)
and Germany (303,000).
Google also shows which sites
it has removed the most links to.
Topping the list is Facebook, with
over 14,500 removals. YouTube,
Twitter, Google + and 192.com
are all in the top 10.
40 2 - 15 November 2016
sci-fi series Westworld (bit.ly/west409).
The broadcaster or the show’s creators
enforce this restriction, usually because
they don’t have the rights to show the
content outside of their home country
(often the US for a lot of current TV
that’s worth watching). Interestingly,
it’s often songs in the soundtrack that
are the problem, not the actual video.
How to beat the block
As always, a VPN is the easiest
solution. The latest version of the Opera
browser (www.opera.com) comes with
a built-in VPN that you can use to get
around the restriction. It lets you
pretend to be browsing from the USA,
Canada, Germany, Netherlands or
Singapore. To enable the feature, click
the Menu button and open Settings.
Click the ‘Privacy & security’ entry
on the left, then tick Enable VPN
(see screen grab above). A blue VPN
badge appears in the address bar.
Click this to change the location.
You might need to clear your
browsing data before the video will play.
Click the ‘Clear browsing data’ button
under ‘Privacy & security’ and refresh
the video page.
Watch blocked TV in the UK
When you try to watch a video in the
UK, you may sometimes receive a

You’ll see this if, for example, you want

Read BBC news that Google blocks
A European Court of Justice ruling in 2014 allows EU citizens to request that
Google removes search results that link to stories which can be deemed
“inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant” (Google extended it to include
non-EU European countries, such as Norway). Among the stories that Google
removes from its search results are ones from BBC News.
Google decides whether or not to remove search results, and it says that it
rejects more requests than it complies with. It’s important to point out that the
European Court of Justice ruling only requires Google to remove links to stories.
The stories themselves aren’t touched – they just become harder for people
to find online.
How to beat the block
In a move the BBC says is designed to maintain the integrity of its online
archives – which are “a matter of historic public record” – the corporation
has started publishing links to the stories from its news site that have been
removed from Google’s search results. You can see all of them up to June 2016
at bit.ly/bbcnews409.

Install mobile apps not
launched in the UK
Developers don’t always release new
apps globally. Often they will test an
app’s popularity in one country before
choosing to release it in others. This
happened in July when Pokémon Go
was launched first in the US, Australia
and New Zealand, leaving Brits
watching impatiently from afar as
the craze took hold.
The developer or publisher might
block an app because they don’t have
certain rights for it overseas. Or, as was
the case with Pokémon Go, an app’s
popularity may place too much strain
on its server. The solution is to stagger
the release across the world, so the app
works as intended.
How to beat the block
If you have an Android phone, you
could root it, although
that carries some risks.
Another option is to
install Rocket VPN
(bit.ly/rvpn409) to
disguise your location.
Launch the VPN and
choose the country
where the app you
want is available.
Google Play will be tied
to your Google
Account, and that will

BEAT THE SOFTWARE BLOCKS
a new Google Play account based in

You need to enter your phone number

that it’s a UK number won’t matter.
Afterwards, go to Settings, Apps,
Google Play Store and tap Storage.
Clear the app cache, then tap Force
Stop. Search Google for the app you
want, then click the link to open it.
Download Kodi and other
streaming services
The child-safety filters applied by ISPs
are also reportedly being used to block
videos in the popular (and highly
controversial) Kodi media player
(https://kodi.tv/download) and other
similar programs. If videos don’t load
for you in Kodi, or its add-ons are failing
to display lists, you might be a victim
of these filters.
How to beat the block
These filters are often enabled by
default for new customers, and might
be active without you knowing about it.
If you’re a Virgin Media customer, log in
at bit.ly/vmsafe409 and deactivate the
Child Safe filter. BT Broadband
customers can see instructions at bit.ly/
btsafe409, while Sky customers should
log into My Sky (bit.ly/mysky409).
If you have been unfairly blocked
from forums, social networks and
other online services, ‘unbanning’
yourself can be difficult. What
matters is how and why you ended
up on the blacklist.
The first step is to report the
problem. If, for example, Facebook
has blocked you, take a look at the
information in the Help Centre
(bit.ly/fbhelp409). You can fill
out a form to lodge an appeal
if you think your account was
“disabled by mistake” (see
screen grab right).
If Twitter has blocked you,
follow the instructions in its
help pages (bit.ly/
twithelp409). To unblock
a OneDrive account, visit bit.
ly/odhelp409.
Some forums rely on IP address
blacklists to block spammers and
trolls, but these can be unreliable. You
might find yourself being blocked
through no fault of your own because
your IP address has somehow ended
up on the list. You can try getting
your IP address off the list by
speaking to the forum owner. If that
doesn’t work, sign up or log in from a
different IP address by either
accessing the site from somewhere
else – such as a café – or by using a
VPN or proxy server.

Make sure the new Google account is
the one connected to Google Play, and
you should be able to download the app.
Rocket VPN is available for iOS (bit.ly/
vpnios409), but it’s harder to cheat
Apple’s system. You’ll need to create
a new Apple ID, and use a method of
payment for the country you’re choosing
as your location (an iTunes gift card for
that country will work). Changing your
ID will wipe any existing subscriptions
you might have through iOS.
Stop Facebook blocking
ad blockers
If you use an ad blocker on Facebook,
you may find it hasn’t stopped you from
seeing ads on the site recently. That’s
because the social network has started
showing adverts that display even if you
have ad-blocking software installed
(infuriating Adblock Plus in the process).
Facebook’s logic, apparently, is that
it can’t let ad-blocking renegades
jeopardise the billions it makes from
advertising. Well, that’s what we think,
anyway. What Facebook claims publicly
is that it isn’t about the money. Andrew
Bosworth, vice president of ads and
business platform at Facebook, said
(presumably with a straight face): “This
isn’t something that we need to do
for revenue, this is something that we
really believe in”.
So what exactly do they “believe” in?
Showing adverts that are “better” and
less “annoying and disruptive”. Bless
Facebook - it’s acting in our best
interests. How sweet.
How to beat the block
Adblock Plus (adblockplus.org) has
been fighting back against Facebook’s
tactics, but this has resulted in a game
of cat and mouse. Some days you won’t
see ads, some days you will. You can
manage the type of adverts Facebook
shows you by tweaking its new ‘advert
preferences’ (bit.ly/fbads409).
Meanwhile, read Adblock Plus’s blog
for its take on what it calls a game
of “ping pong” with Facebook:
bit.ly/adblock409.
Stop Netflix blocking VPNs
Netflix is spending a lot of money on
original and exclusive content, but not
all its films and TV shows are available in
all the countries that Netflix serves. For
example, Ricky Gervais’s film David
Brent: Life on the Road will be available
exclusively on US Netflix early next year,
but won’t be shown in the UK, Ireland,
Australia or New Zealand.
It’s easy to beat such geographical
restrictions using a VPN, but Netflix
is cracking down on these services,
blocking them where it can. The
company doesn’t suspend your account
or penalise you in any way – it just
recognises when VPN software is being
used and prevents you from accessing
its programmes.
How to beat the block
While Netflix will recognise and
block most popular VPNs, such as
CyberGhost (www.cyberghostvpn.com),
NordVPN (nordvpn.com) and
TunnelBear, it does so with varying
degrees of success. Switching the
location you use in your choice of VPN,
even those mentioned above, may
be enough to get around the block.
Something strange
happened in early
September, a couple of
weeks after the Windows 10
Anniversary Update (AU).
The operating system
appeared to be blocking
some browsers, including
Chrome and Firefox, forcing
people to use Edge,
Microsoft’s replacement for
Internet Explorer.
After many complaints,
Microsoft confirmed it had
tweaked its settings to
block default browsers whose web
filtering, it claims, isn’t strong
enough to “keep your children safe”.
Microsoft didn’t name the browsers it
considered unsafe, just referring to
them as “most commonly used”. That
can only mean Chrome and Firefox.
Some critics accused Microsoft of
driving people toward Edge by
exploiting parents’ fears. Recent
figures show that Edge’s market
share on computers is a puny 5%
(Chrome dominates the pack on
54%), so Microsoft desperately needs
to increase the numbers of people
using its browser. One way it’s doing
this in the US is to “reward” users
with credits to spend on Amazon and
Skype, and in Starbucks.
You’ll find the security settings in
the Microsoft Family section of
Windows 10 (see screen grab above).
– it’s called Family Safety in previous
versions of the operating system:
https://account.microsoft.com/
family. This provides useful tools for
restricting what your children can do
online, but we think the ban on
non-Microsoft browsers is an
overreaction. To unblock these
browsers, you need to add them to a
‘whitelist’ within the settings.

Stop BBC iPlayer blocking VPNs
Like Netflix, the BBC is clamping down on VPN use to stop users outside the
UK from accessing its content for free. If you live overseas or are holidaying
abroad, using a VPN to keep up with your favourite BBC programmes seems
like the perfect solution, but it breaks the corporation’s terms of service. Last
year, the Global Web Index (www.globalwebindex.net) claimed that more than
60 million people watched iPlayer content for free outside the UK.
In an effort to control this, the BBC makes regular updates to iPlayer to block
VPNs. It reportedly plans to launch its own paid-for
video service in America in the next few years, so it
wants to limit which programmes can be watched
beyond British shores.
How to beat the block
iPlayer doesn’t block all VPN services, so you
may be able to get around the restriction by trying
a different tool, or connecting to another network.
At the time of writing, TunnelBear still works with
iPlayer and lets you watch BBC content overseas.

What we liked:
Free software for
downloading and
converting video comes
in two main types, and
each has its benefits and
drawbacks. The first is
attractive and easy to use, but
often comes bundled with adware and
PUPs, which means you have to tread
carefully during intsallation. Our Silver
Award-winner Freemake Video
Converter is a classic example of this. On
the other side of the fence is TEncoder,
which is completely clean and free of
adware, but doesn’t have Freemake’s
slick and simple-to-use interface.
TEncoder’s main window has three
tabs to choose from, depending on
whether you want to convert video on
your hard drive; download video from
sites like YouTube; or extract the video
from DVDs. There’s a toolbar of buttons
across the top of each tab, which
control the list below of videos you
want to covert or download.
Once you’ve built up your list, you
have to delve into the settings to ensure
the video output is correct for your
device. TEncoder doesn’t offer any help,
so you need to research your device’s
requirements yourself if you don’t
already know
the resolution
and format
you need.
However,
if you have
all this
information
and know
what you’re
doing,
TEncoder
gives you a lot
of control over
the final video,
from the
resolution and
frame rate, right down to where the file
is saved. Advanced users will find lots to
tweak and adapt, and the software
doesn’t doctor the videos in any way, by
adding its own splash screens or
watermarks, for example.
How it can be improved:
Some preset profiles for specific mobile
devices would make TEncoder much
easier to use. You can save your own
profiles that you can load if you need to
change formats for different devices,
but you still need to know your device’s
settings in the first place.
The outdated interface is crying out
for an overhaul – there are a lot of ugly
drop-down menus and the few buttons
that do have icons look old-fashioned.
OUR VERDICT
TEncoder isn’t the easiest video
downloader and converter to get to
grips with, but it does both jobs
well, is crammed with options and
gets easier to use once you’ve set
up the profiles for your devices. It’s
also completely free of adware.
If you want to watch every
type of video on your mobile
devices, both online and off,
you’ll need a tool that can
download and convert them.

Freemake Video
Converter’s friendly
interface and integrated
downloader make it
incredibly easy to use.
However, you first have to
get past the installer, which is
crammed with adware and may even
get blocked by your security software.
We managed to install it cleanly, but you
should be aware of the risks.
Once it’s installed, though, it’s very
simple to use. Drop the videos you want
to convert into the queue and add
online video for downloading (from
most sites including YouTube and
Facebook) by copying the web address
and clicking the Paste URL button. The
editing tool can remove unwanted
sections, such as ads.
When you’re ready to convert, click
one of the video profiles, such as AVI or
Apple, then choose a device (such as an
iPhone) or a fixed resolution. For the
best compatibility, choose the 1080p
AVI or iPad 3 Apple profiles. Click the
Convert button to start the process.
Online videos are downloaded before
being converted.
What we liked:
If you don’t want to install
software on your
computer, try the online
conversion service
CloudConvert. This simple
site lets you upload your
video file and choose the
output format. When the conversion’s
done, you just download the new file.
By default, CloudConvert keeps the
output video at the same resolution as
the original, although you can click the
spanner icon and choose a different
resolution if you know which device you
want to play the converted video on.
You can also choose to remove ads or
other content from a video, although
you have to manually type in the start
and end times of the unwanted section.
As well as video, CloudConvert can
also handle documents, images and
audio files, so you can convert
practically any file type you like.
How it can be improved:
You are limited to 25 free conversion
minutes per day, which is to say that
you have 25 minutes of processing time.
The number of minutes a video file
uses depends on its size, complexity
and resolution. This makes
CloudConvert better for smaller files
unless you’re prepared to pay for extra
conversion minutes.
You can also create photo slideshows
by using the Photo option and turn
MP3s into videos with funky graphical
visualisations.
How it can be improved:
The YouTube downloader has no
download-only option, just download
and convert. With the free version, all
converted videos start with a Freemake
splash screen.
OUR VERDICT
Freemake Video Converter is very
easy to use, but the bundled adware
makes it tricky to install. You have to
pay $9 (around £7.50) to remove
the splash screen from your videos.
OUR VERDICT
CloudConvert is a handy tool for
converting short video files (or
other file types). It’s straightforward
to use and means you don’t have to
install any software on your PC.
Any Video Converter
bit.ly/avcf409
Any Video Converter comes with
optional adware so, like Freemake,
you need to
be careful
during
installation.
Our security
software
also blocked
an unknown
file that ran while we were installing,
although it continued to install
without it. AVC has the best
interface of all the software in this
test, but we can’t recommend it
while it continues to get tangled up
in security software.
HandBrake
www.handbrake.fr
HandBrake is a classic converter,
designed to change video files into
a format that’s compatible with
Apple devices. This isn’t as limiting
as it sounds because Apple video
formats
work with
virtually
every other
(non-Apple)
device.
HandBrake
is easy to
use and can
either convert a single file or add a
folder’s worth of videos in one go.
There are video profiles for most
Apple devices (iPhone, iPod and so
on), but choose Regular if you don’t
want to resize the video. Click
convert, and HandBrake completes
the job quickly and efficiently.
Convertilla
convertilla.com
Convertilla is brilliant for basic video
conversion. Just install the program
(untick any option written in Russian
in the wizard), select a file to
convert, choose the output format
and click Connect. For the best
compatibility, we recommend the
Gadget, Full HD (1080p) profile.
Convertilla
can only
work on one
file at a
time, but
this keeps
things
simple.

Browse the web
in different colours
You can choose from a rainbow of hues to apply to your browser and
bring some colour to the web. Daniel Booth explains how
CHROME
Turn black into white, and
white into black
Nothing quite prepares you for how
different your favourite websites look
when their colours are inverted. That’s
what happens when you install High
Contrast (bit.ly/highcontrast409),
an official Chrome extension from
Google that turns black into white and
vice versa (leaving photos untouched).
Look at the BBC News site, for example
(see screen grab, below): High Contrast
makes it show white text on a black
background, and turns the familiar
red banner turquoise.
The idea is to increase the contrast to
make it easier to read web pages. To
find the right contrast for you, and set
it as the default, click the extension’s
logo at the top right (it’s a grey-black
circle), then try the options (yellow on
black is particularly striking).
Change your Google
homepage
Despite stating otherwise, High Contrast
works on your Google ‘new tab’ page
– the page showing thumbnails of your
most visited sites. But its palette is
limited to contrasting colours, omitting
soothing pinks and blues. More calming
are the colours offered by the extension
‘Color Change for Google’ (bit.ly/
color409). Click the paint-tin icon to
open a rainbow of colours. We chose
a suitably autumnal reddish brown
(see screen grab, above).
A word of warning: if you don’t want
this extension to track your browsing,
untick the ‘Improve Your Experience’
box when you install the extension.
Look after your eyes
One of the main reasons for changing
the colour of a website is to minimise
eye strain. There are many tools that
have a ‘night mode’ which, like High
Contrast, darken the screen and turn
text white. Another option is to apply
a pastel hue to the screen,
which the extension ‘Care
your Eyes’ calls its Reseda
Mode. Install the extension
(bit.ly/care409), click the
sunglasses icon, then select
Reseda Mode. This will turn
your screen a pleasing shade
of green – like the Reseda
plant (commonly called
mignonette) after which it
is, presumably, named.
There are five more colours
available – click the small
arrow next to Reseda Mode to see the
rest, including this light blue that looks
rather fetching on the BBC News site
(see screen grab, below left).
FIREFOX
Add themes to Firefox
There are 410,000 Firefox themes,
which means you could try a different
one every day until the year 3139.
They all change the colour of the URL
bar and the space around it, including
any toolbars.
They’re easy to install, too. Visit bit.ly/
themes409, then choose a way to view
them – by category, for example, or by
how new they are. Click Most Popular
and you’ll see that the Dark Fox theme
– downloaded 243,000 times – tops the
list. It’s stylish, but a bit gloomy for our
tastes. Instead, we chose this cute
‘Snoopy Nap’ theme (bit.ly/snoopy409,
see screen grab, opposite top).
What’s really useful about Firefox’s
themes is that you don’t need to
download them to see what they will
look like. Just hover your mouse over
one then see the effect previewed at
the top of your screen. Visit Mozilla’s
website for more help on using themes,

You’ll have to supply the popcorn yourself, but ‘Turn Off the Lights’ does
everything else to make watching YouTube a cinematic experience. Install the
Chrome extension (bit.ly/turn409), then click the lightbulb icon to dim the
web page so only the video stands out. It works on Facebook, Vimeo,
Dailymotion and other video sites (visit www.turnoffthelights.com for more
information).
To save yourself repeatedly clicking the lightbulb icon, turn on ‘automatic
dimming’, which kicks in when you start watching a video. Right-click the icon,
click Options, then tick the ‘Automatically dim the background...’ box (see
screen grab, below). You can also select how soon after the video ends – up to
10 seconds – you want the background to return to normal.
‘Turn Off the Lights’ is also available for Firefox (bit.ly/foxlights409) and
Opera (bit.ly/operalights409) and has been available since September for
Edge, Microsoft’s replacement for Internet Explorer: bit.ly/edgelights409.

Set ‘Turn Off the Lights’ to automatically dim a website’s background when you
watch videos
including instructions on how to remove
them when you want a change: bit.ly/

Change text and link colour
Firefox’s powers of decoration don’t
end with themes. It also lets you change
the text, background and link colours.
Click the three-line menu icon in the
top-right corner and click the
Preferences cog. Select the Content tab
and click the Colours button (see screen
grab, below), then change the colour for
text and background, as well as for
visited and unvisited links. To make
these your default colours, select
Always in the drop-down menu.
Hack a website’s colour
scheme
Finding the best colour scheme for a
site (and for your eyes) involves trial and
error. This works best when there are
plenty of settings to tweak, as there are
in the add-on Color Transform (like
many web-colouring tools, it spells
‘colour’ the American way). Once you’ve
installed it and found a site you want
to experiment with, click the arrow next
to the add-on’s icon to reveal enough
colour schemes to make the Dulux dog
drool. In our example (see screen grab,
top right) we’ve applied a purple haze
to the official Jimi Hendrix website.
The colour panel looks rather
complicated, so take time to read the
instructions on the add-on’s page:
bit.ly/transform409. This tells you,
for example, that you can save your
colour changes by clicking the panel’s
star and plus buttons.
OPERA
Make Opera look
more ‘Stylish’
Downloaded more than 620,000 times,
Stylish is an extension that acts as a
gateway to hundreds of website themes
created by Opera users. Once you’ve
installed it (bit.ly/stylish409), browse
the web and click the ‘S’ icon when
you’re on a site you want to add a
theme to. Click ‘Find more styles for this
site’, then click one you like. Finally, click
the green ‘Install with Stylish’ button.
The more popular a website, the more
themes it will have: there are 100 pages
of themes for Google and Facebook,
85 for Twitter, 40 for Wikipedia and six
for BBC News. Searching on Google
feels like you’re picking the brains of
everyone on the planet, so we thought it
was fitting to add the ‘Our Earth’ theme
to the Google Search homepage (see
screen grab, below).

Firefox, at least)

Take your favourite browser
with you
Using Chrome’s portable app (bit.ly/
pchrome409), rather than simply
logging into your account in the
Desktop version, is more secure
because your browsing history and
other elements will be kept on the USB
stick and leave no trace on the PC.
However, there are some drawbacks.
For example, you can’t move saved
passwords – and some other settings –
from one PC to another, because of the
way Chrome stores them. They won’t be
left behind on a PC you’ve used, but
they can’t always be retrieved when you
log into another computer.
Like all apps packaged by
PortableApps.com (see box on the
opposite page), the portable version of
Chrome doesn’t need to be installed on
your PC. You just run a set-up file, which
is much quicker. When you click the
green download button, the file will be
automatically downloaded from
SourceForge (see the numbered screen
grabs below).
Firefox Portable (bit.ly/pfirefox409) is
virtually indistinguishable from the full
Mozilla browser. It offers the same range
of excellent features including a
customisable layout, Reading Mode and
Private Browsing, and you can even use
Firefox Sync to make sure that your
bookmarks, history, tabs, passwords
and add-ons are up to date across all
your devices.
Similarly, the portable version of
Opera (bit.ly/popera409) differs little
from the full, desktop browser. To save
your passwords (and some other
information) when you move from one
machine to another, use the browser’s
Synchronisation feature.
Work from anywhere
It’s frustrating to save your work to a
USB stick and then find that you can’t
open it because the PC you’re using
doesn’t have the right software
installed. You can avoid this problem by
downloading a free portable office
suite. Like its desktop counterpart, Libre
Office Portable (bit.ly/plibre409) offers
a comprehensive range of tools
When you run portable apps from a USB
stick, it’s vital to ensure that you eject it
safely before removing it from the port.
Failure to do so could corrupt the apps
and result in data loss. To avoid this,
close all portable apps and files saved to
the drive when you’ve finished with
them, then click ‘Safely Remove
Hardware and Eject Media’ from the
System Tray before selecting ‘Eject
JumpDrive’ for the appropriate drive.
AVOID CORRUPTING YOUR FILES
Saving your favourite software as portable apps to a USB means you
can use them on any PC. Edward Munn rounds up the best ones

Most of the apps in this feature are available from
PortableApps.com (see all links on this page
starting with ‘bit.ly/p’). The advantage of
downloading them from this site is that you can
also install the PortableApps.com Platform to
build your own suite of portable apps.
Visit portableapps.com/download, download
and run the setup file and choose where you
want to install the PortableApps Platform. Once
it’s set up, any PortableApps.com apps you
install will automatically be added to the
launcher when you first run them (see screen
grab, right). Apps you’ve already installed from
the site can be added by moving their folders to
the ‘PortableApps’ folder. Portable apps not
downloaded from the site can also be added to the launcher, but there’s no
guarantee they won’t leave information on the PCs they’re used on.
MANAGE YOUR PORTABLE APPS IN ONE PLACE
including a word processor,
spreadsheet and presentation
software. If you prefer
OpenOffice, grab its portable
version from bit.ly/popen409.
Take care when installing these
office apps because their
download pages often contain
download buttons for ads and
programs you don’t want. We saw
one of these on the page for
OpenOffice, and several
alongside other programs on
PortableApps.
Downloading the correct
language pack is similarly
confusing. Our screen grab
above shows three
download buttons: you need
number 2, which is 826MB when
installed and contains the ‘standard’
language pack containing UK English
(among others). The download to its
right contains more languages, and is a
bigger app (1.5GB).
Manage your emails and
contacts
If you don’t like webmail and miss your
email software when you’re away from
your PC, why not take it with you?
Mozilla’s Thunderbird (bit.ly/
pthunderbird409) is available as a
portable app that lets you open your
emails and address book on any PC.
Opera Mail Portable (bit.ly/
poperam409) is another excellent,
customisable option. It intelligently
sorts your emails to show all the
messages in a conversation, and
also has a built-in feed reader to
help you keep up to date with your
favourite websites.
Chat from anywhere
One of our favourite messaging
apps is Telegram, available as a
portable app directly from its
developer (desktop.telegram.org)
or bit.ly/ptelegram409 if you’re
building a PortableApps suite
– see box, right). It uses very
strong encryption, and you
can set your messages to self-destruct.
Skype is also available as a portable app
(bit.ly/pskype409) so you can make
audio and video calls from any PC and
avoid the inferior beta web app. Pidgin
Portable (bit.ly/ppidgin409) lets you
chat to AOL, MSN and Yahoo users.
Keep your passwords safe
Chrome and Firefox save your
passwords to speed up logins on the
web, but this makes your private data
vulnerable should your PC end up in the
wrong hands. For this reason, you might
prefer to save your passwords to a
portable password manager such as
KeePass, (keepass.info/download.html
or bit.ly/pkeepass409 from
PortableApps). This means you can be
confident that the only copy of your
passwords is encrypted and on your
person at all times.
LastPass users can use a portable
version, too. It’s available exclusively
from the LastPass site (bit.ly/
lastpass409) but it only works in Firefox
Portable and Chrome Portable.
Fix anyone’s PC
If you’re the person family members and
friends call on to fix their computers,
you can make your emergency visits
more successful by building a USB stick
containing essential PC-rescue tools,
including antivirus scanners, clean-up
programs and uninstallers.
The hugely popular junk-removal tool
CCleaner is available in portable form
(bit.ly/ccleaner409), as is
SUPERAntiSpyware (bit.ly/
superanti409), which scans and
removes more than a million malware
and spyware infections. Portable
versions of IObit Uninstaller (bit.ly/
piobit409) and Revo Uninstaller (bit.ly/
prevo409) are available from
PortableApps.com, should
you need to tackle stubborn
software that Windows
can’t remove.
If you’re trying to fix a
PC that won’t boot, use
YUMI Multiboot USB
Creator (bit.ly/
yumi409 or bit.ly/
pyumi409) to install
multiple operating
systems (Ubuntu in
the screen grab
above), diagnostic
tools and antivirus on
a USB.

T
he Milky Way is so large that the
very idea of cataloguing just 1% of
its stars (around 1 billion celestial
bodies) seems like an optimistic
endeavour, yet that’s exactly what the
European Space Agency’s five-year Gaia
mission is working towards. Its ultimate
aim is to build a three-dimensional map
of our galaxy, and last month it published
a preliminary billion-star catalogue.
Gaia Sky is an open-source, real-time
astronomy tool that lets you explore the
galaxy as seen by the Gaia satellite. The
software, which runs on Windows, Linux
and macOS, lets you fly freely throughout
the cosmos and even perform a close up
inspection of Gaia itself.
If the program crashes for any reason,
delete the C:\Users\[your user name]
\.gaiasky folder and restart the software.
Explore the galaxy with Gaia Sky
bit.ly/gaia409

Explore the galaxy using your mouse,
or search for a specific location by
pressing Ctrl+F and typing what you’re
looking for. 1 The sky will move to centre
in on the object as soon as it recognises
its name. Press Ctrl+G to jump straight
there, then zoom in with your mouse.
1
Start Gaia Sky and choose to view the
program in either Windowed or
Fullscreen mode. 1 Pick a resolution. 2
You can also adjust the graphics settings.
3 Use the bar on the left to customise
other settings, such as performance and
controls. 4 Click ‘Launch application’ 5
to begin.
2
Once Gaia Sky has loaded (this takes
a while, even on a fast PC, so be
patient), you’ll be presented with a view
of the Earth as seen from space. 1 Click
and drag with the left mouse button to
move the view, and use the mouse wheel
to zoom in and out. Click the mouse
button again to stop moving.
3
The information displayed on the
right shows details about the planet
1 and a link to its entry on Wikipedia. 2
You’ll also see your mouse pointer’s
coordinates 3 (which change as you
move your mouse) and camera details. 4
Click Controls in the top-left corner 5 to

The Controls panel has options to set
which elements are visible, including
stars, planets, moons, atmospheres,
orbits, labels and more. 1 We
recommend keeping labels switched on

Make your own Windows 10
Start menu tiles
2
TileIconifier automatically adjusts the icon to fit Medium
and Small tiles, and shows a preview. You can change the
size of the icon for each tile size independently using the
zoom buttons and sliders. 1 The Align Image buttons 2 let you
adjust the icon’s position within the tile.
1
Download and run TileIconifier. From the shortcut list, 1
select a program whose icon you want to enhance. Tick
the option to ‘Change Medium and Small image together’,
then double-click the ‘Medium icon’ box 2 and choose from the
icons on offer 3 or upload your own image. 4 Click OK.
3
If, after experimenting with an icon’s size and position,
you want to revert to TileIconifier’s default configuration,
use the Reset button. 1 You can also change the tile’s
background colour by making a selection in the drop-down
menu, clicking the colour chart or using the dropper tool. 2 4
If a program is easy to recognise from its icon alone, you
may want to remove the text that appears in the
foreground of Medium-size tiles. 1 TileIconifier also lets
you use dark text 2 instead of the usual white, which is handy if
you want to change the background to a lighter colour.
W
indows 10’s Start menu is better than its Windows
8 predecessor, but there aren’t many options for
customising how it looks. Shortcut tiles can look
dull, particularly when set to Medium size, because the icons
look small and lost in the surrounding blue box. TileIconifier
is a portable tool that lets you customise shortcuts so the
icon fills the tile, which looks a lot better. You can even use a
different icon and change the tile’s background colour to add
variety to the Start menu. In this Workshop, we’ve used
TileIconifier to improve the Firefox tile.
You’re not limited to changing icons for Desktop
applications, either. TileIconifier’s Custom Shortcut Manager
lets you create Start shortcuts to Chrome apps, Windows
apps, folders and URLs, all of which you can then alter
according to your preferences. The tool makes it easy to see
which shortcuts you’ve modified, and switching back to the
originals is as simple as clicking a button.

You can undo your changes (including background colour)
at any time by clicking Reset. 1 Once you’re happy with
both icons, click the Tile Iconify button 2 to update them.
You may need to unpin and repin the program to the Start
menu, or restart your PC, for the changes to take effect.
6
When you’ve changed a program’s icons, a tick appears
in TileIconifier’s shortcuts list to show that it has been
Iconified. 1 If you want to revert to the original Windows
icons for a particular program, select it from the list and click
the Remove Iconify button. 2
7
You can create Start shortcuts for items that don’t appear
in TileIconifier’s main list, too. Click Utilities and select
Custom Shortcut Manager, then Create New Shortcut.
From the Explorer tab, 1 you can create shortcuts to special
folders including Control Panel, Documents 2 and Downloads. 8
Alternatively, click the Chrome Apps tab 1 to add
shortcuts for Chrome apps, including Gmail, 2 Google
Docs and Play Music. You can also create custom
shortcuts for Windows apps 3 such as Microsoft Edge, whose
icons you can’t otherwise Iconify.
10
Once you’ve ‘Iconified’ your custom shortcuts, open
the Start menu and expand TileIconify to find them.
1 Right-click a shortcut and select ‘Pin to Start’ 2
to add it to the Start menu. You can then move and resize it
according to your preference.
9
Finally, the URI tab lets you create custom shortcuts for
a web address of your choice. Any custom shortcut you
generate appears in TileIconifier’s shortcut list, 1 where
you can customise its tiles. You can delete custom shortcuts
from the Custom Shortcut Manager.
Ed Munn says
In Step 1, we recommend ticking the option to ‘Change Medium and Small image together’. You
could untick it, but that doesn’t mean you can alter one size of tile while leaving the other as it is.
Instead, this option is designed to let you use a different image for each tile size.

Below the switch, there’s a graph 1 and a percentage
figure 2 that shows how much data you’ve saved over
the past month. Note that websites, images and videos
are compressed before being sent to your device, so you may
want to switch it off when you’re on an unlimited connection.

4
When you want to look at a page you’ve saved, tap the
menu button and choose Downloads. 1 This opens a

box, 2 as they do in the PC version. These are synced across all
your devices if you’re signed into your Google account.
6
Switch to the Beta version again and scroll down below
the shortcut icons. Here, you’ll find links to news stories

Don’t let web trackers spoil your surfing
G
hostery is a brilliant tool for blocking the unnecessary
trackers that adverts and other website elements use
to follow your movements around the web. The latest
version categorises these trackers and has new alerting tools.
These make it much easier to understand
what’s tracking you and let you block trackers
that slow down a site, leak personal information
or stop the page working properly.
Ghostery: bit.ly/ghost409 |
10 mins |
1
Install the appropriate add-on for your browser. Creating
an account is free and syncs all your settings across all
your browsers. When you visit a site containing trackers,
you’ll see them listed in a purple box on the right. 1 The
add-on’s button displays the number of trackers found. 2 2
Click the button for more information about the
trackers. They are colour-coded into categories and
shown on a pie chart. 1 Purple trackers are related to
advertising, blue ones are site analytics (collecting data on
visitors) and orange ones are categorised as ‘essential’.
3
Trackers with an orange icon 1 will trigger an alert. To
isolate them, click the pop-up link 2 or ‘x Alerts’. 3 A
snail icon 4 indicates a tracker that slows your browser;
an explosion stops a page loading properly; and a shark’s fin
leaks personal information on a supposedly secure site.
4
Hover your mouse over the tick box to see the options
to ‘Trust on this site’ 1 or ‘Restrict on this site’. 2 If you
tick the box next to each tracker, 3 it will stop that
tracker operating on every site you visit. If you change your
mind, just hover and click again to remove your choices.
5
If you want to stop a site tracking you, click the Restrict
Site button. 1 This is like going through every tracker
found in Step 4 and clicking the ‘Restrict on this site’
button. To undo this, click the button again. The Trust Site
button 2 does the reverse and lets everything through.
6
Click the heading bar of the purple box to shrink it to a
small button. This expands to a small bar showing the
alerts 1 when you hover your mouse over it. The
Settings, 2 accessed from the menu, 3 let you turn off this
bar, reduce its display time and move it to another location.

Tablet memory isn’t as sophisticated
but some manufacturers have their own
way of organising data, which occurs in
the background when a device is idle.
The next time you recharge your device
and don’t need to use it immediately, try
leaving it plugged in. While in this idle
state, your tablet may perform its own
housekeeping. Some people have
reported that leaving their device
plugged in and idle for 24 hours has
improved the performance, so it’s worth
a try.
Expand the tablet’s capacity
Some Android tablets have a microSD
slot, which you can use to increase the
device’s capacity. When you buy a
microSD card, it’s worth spending a little
extra money to get a faster model. SD
cards are categorised by speed and go
up to category 10, while category 10
cards can have a further two grades of
UHS (Ultra High Speed, graded at UHS-1
possible. Don’t let it drift over 75% full
if you want it to operate at peak
performance.
As well as regularly backing up and
removing videos and photos, and
deleting unused apps, you should use a
cleaning tool such as CCleaner for
Android (bit.ly/cclean409). Even a hard
reset – simply turning your device off
and back on again – can help clear
caches and the like, and may give a quick
performance boost.
Keep your tablet TRIM
The SSDs (solid-state drives) that you
plug in to your PC use a technology
called TRIM to manage the data on them.
This special command is built into the
drive and is used by Windows to better
manage the deleted space, which makes
the drives faster and more efficient.

To refresh your tablet and get it
running as speedily as it did when it
was new, it’s worth performing a
factory reset. Make sure you’ve backed
up absolutely everything before
proceeding. To reset an iPad, go to
Settings, General 1 and select Reset 2
at the bottom.

You are given two options. You can

iOS offers all sorts of fancy

Check your device’s specification and
buy the highest category card it can
handle. All the speed categories are
backwards-compatible, so faster cards

If your tablet doesn’t have a memory
slot, or you have an iPad, you can instead
connect a wireless hard drive or a dongle
to the tablet. Adam Elements’ iKlips Duo
(www.adamelements.com) is a flash
storage device for iPads that connects to
a tablet through its Lightning port (see
photo on page 59). It has a USB 3.1
adapter at the other end, so you can
easily copy files between an iPad and
a PC; or you can just use it to store
photos and videos, away from the iPad’s
main storage.
Minor tweaks to add speed
You might be able to speed things up a
fraction by carefully choosing which apps
you use. Apple’s apps are designed
specifically to run on Apple hardware,
which may give them the advantage over
apps by other developers. Safari, for
example, uses fewer resources than
Google Chrome. The pre-installed apps
may not have the same tools as the
alternatives in the app store, but they
should be faster and more stable.
Having Siri Suggestions turned on
during searches can hog your tablet’s
resources, so it’s worth turning it off if
you have no need for it. To do this, go to
Settings, General, then Spotlight Search.
Other resource-hogging search options
can be turned off, too.
Some people suggest you can free up
resources by closing apps that are
running in the background (in iOS, you
do this by double-clicking the Home
button and swiping away the open apps)
but, in fact, this is only of use if an app
has frozen or crashed.
We suggest more iPad settings to
tweak in our Mini Workshop, below,
including turning off some of the
interface’s animations. To do the same
thing in Android, go to Settings, About
and tap ‘Build Number’ seven times. This
unlocks Android’s ‘Developer options’,
which you’ll now find back in the main
Settings menu. Scroll down to the
‘Window animation scale’, ‘Transition
animation scale’ and ‘Animator duration

change the animation scale to ‘.5x’.

Web User’s Top Tips
Chrome Beta is one
version ahead of the
Stable public release
and it rarely crashes.
You can use it as your
main browser
because most of the
bugs have been fixed
and any new tools
or technologies are
almost ready for
public release. New
Beta versions of
Chrome come along
every six weeks, at
which point the
previous Beta
becomes the new
Stable release and a new Beta filters
down from the Dev version.
If you find that Canary is too buggy,
but the Beta doesn’t offer enough new
features, try the Dev version. It’s more
experimental than the Beta, but is still
reasonably stable. Chrome Dev is
updated once or twice a week and
shows what Google is currently
working on. You can download
all these versions of Chrome from
bit.ly/chrome409.
Become a Firefox Test Pilot
The Firefox beta version is
available from bit.ly/ffbeta409.
TOP TIPS FOR BROWSER BETAS
N
ew versions of web browsers often
improve performance as well as
increase efficiency and provide new
tools. However, it’s sometimes hard to tell
the difference between versions because
the internal tweaks that make it faster aren’t
visible. It’s therefore useful to benchmark
your regular browser before downloading
and installing a new one or trying a beta
version, so you can find out whether or not
your browser’s performance has improved.
Go to Speedometer at bit.ly/speedo409
and run the test. It mimics a range of
real-world web applications, so the
differences indicate what you will see when
you’re actually using the browser. Google
says Chrome’s performance has improved
by 15% this year, though more improvement
is predicted for Chrome version 55, which
halves the amount of memory it needs to
run on certain websites.
Benchmark your browser
Chrome beta and beyond
There are eight different versions
of Chrome: four 64-bit and four
32-bit versions. The four types are
called Stable (the public version that
most people use), Beta, Dev and Canary.
Each version represents one step in the
development process, so if the current
Stable version is 53, the Beta is 54, Dev
is 55 and Canary is 56.
New tools are first tested in Canary,
which is updated once or twice a week,
and is never more than a few days old.
It may have a few bugs but that’s to be
expected because it’s at the cutting
edge of new browser tools.
Our experts show you how to get the latest browser
tools before anyone else

TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
Here, you’ll also find a more advanced
version called the Developer Edition.
However, new tools are currently thin
on the ground in Firefox’s preview
versions because Mozilla is taking a new
approach to testing, which is built into
the regular version of the browser and
is called Firefox Test Pilot.
Go to testpilot.firefox.com and install
the Test Pilot add-on. This brings a
collection of new tools to your browser,
all of which are experimental and so may
or may not eventually reach the public
release. Click the Test Pilot button in the
toolbar to access the experiments. When
we looked, we found a range of tools
including Page Shot, Min Vid, Tracking
Protection, Activity Stream, Tab Center,
No More 404s and Universal Search.
Best Test Pilot tools
Our favourite Test Pilot tools are
Page Shot and Min Vid. Page Shot
adds a button to the toolbar that takes
screen grabs of web pages. Click the
button, then click and drag over the
area you want to save. The image is
saved and can easily be shared on
social-media sites such as Facebook
and Twitter.
Enabling Min Vid places a button
on any video you’re watching on sites
such as YouTube and Vimeo. Click the
button and the video will jump off the
page into its own frame. You can then
drag it anywhere you want and it will
continue to play while you carry out
other PC tasks. The video stays on
top of all your other windows, even if
you use the browser to visit another
site or switch to a different program.
exist side by side on your Android
device, with separate icons. This is
useful because if you encounter
a problem with a particular website
on the Beta, Dev or Canary version,
you can easily switch back to the
Stable release. Some of the tools in
our Workshop on page 56 use the
latest beta version.
Firefox beta is also in the Google
Play Store and is around a month
or two ahead of the stable release.
Listen in the background
A new tool in the Chrome
Beta for Android lets users
listen to videos in the background
while using another app. This is
particularly useful when listening to
music videos. To try it, go to a website
that streams video, such as YouTube
(www.youtube.com) or Vimeo (www
.vimeo.com), and start playing a
video. As it plays, switch to another
app. If the video pauses, just swipe
down from the top of the screen and
tap the play button to continue
playing the video in the background.
Getting the Edge beta
Microsoft doesn’t release beta
versions of Edge in the same way
as Chrome, Firefox and Opera (which
has beta and developer versions
available at bit.ly/opera409). The only
way to get the development version
of Edge is to switch to the Windows
10 Insider Program (insider.windows
.com), which you can join with your
Microsoft account. To switch to it in
the standard version of Windows,
press Windows+i to open Settings,
then click ‘Update & security’ followed
by Windows Insider Programme. Click
‘Get started’. The downside is that you
often have to update the whole of
Windows 10 just to get the latest
version of Edge. It’s like reinstalling
Windows 10 every week.
Try Chrome experiments
y
You can try some of Chrome’s
experimental tools without
having to install the Beta version of
the browser. Type chrome://flags
into the address bar to access a list of
experimental features. These come
and go, and some are more useful
than others. Each has an explanation
and a link to Enable or Disable it, or
a menu of further options. You can
search for an experiment by using the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F, then typing
its name and pressing Enter.
We particularly like ‘Fast tab/
window close’, which makes the
browser feel more responsive by
removing all the delays and pauses
that occur when closing tabs. If you
want to see what Chrome might look
like in the near future, enable the two
Material Design settings and the
‘Extension Toolbar Redesign’.
Enable ‘Password generation’ if
you’d like Chrome to create new
passwords for you automatically when
websites call
for them,
and disable
‘Hiding close
buttons
on inactive
tabs when
stacked’
to ensure
tab close
buttons
are always
visible.
‘Tab audio
muting UI
control’ adds
a speaker icon that you can click to
silence any audio playing in a tab.
Betas on Android
You can also
download beta
versions of mobile browsers. Go to
the Google Play Store on your
Android phone or tablet and search
for ‘Chrome beta’ to download and
install it, and access the latest tools.
The Beta is one version ahead of the
standard release (Chrome is currently
version 53 and the Beta is version 54).
Dev and Canary versions (55 and 56,
respectively) are also available.
They’re likely to have more new tools
but will also be more prone to bugs.

Record a soundtrack from a
DVD
Q
My wife and I have a collection
of musicals on DVD, which we
regularly play through our DVD
player, but I would like to transfer
the soundtracks to a CD so we can
play them in the car and elsewhere.
I have tried various methods without
success and have had some programs
recommended that will do the job, but
they are too expensive. Could you advise
me of an alternative method?
I am using a Toshiba laptop running
Windows 7 Professional. I appreciate
there’s a copyright problem but I’d only
be using the CDs for personal use.
Brian Foster, via email
A
Commercial DVDs often have
protection and security systems to
stop people copying them, so the only
option may be to buy the CD versions
of the soundtracks. However, there are
some free programs that, if used
together, might be able to help.
First, download and install HandBrake
(handbrake.fr), which can read a DVD
and save it as a video on the PC’s hard
drive. Put the DVD in the drive and run
HandBrake. Click Source and select the
DVD drive to scan the disc. Click the
Title button to select what to convert –
the biggest item is usually the main
content. Click the Browse button,
choose where to save the video file and
enter a filename. Select Normal in the
presets panel and click Start.
Next, use VLC Media Player (www
.videolan.org), which can read a video
file and save the audio track as an MP3.
Run VLC, click the Media menu and
select Convert/Save. Select the File tab,
click the Add button and select the
video file output from HandBrake. If the
button at the bottom doesn’t say
Convert/Save, click the arrow next to it
and select it. Click Convert/Save. Select
‘Audio – MP3’ on the Profile drop-down
menu, click the Browse button and
choose where to save the audio file.
Click Start to convert it.
If you’ve made it this far, you now
need CDBurnerXP (cdburnerxp.se),
which can create an audio CD from MP3
files. Put a recordable CD-R in the drive,
run CDBurnerXP and select ‘Audio disc’
on the home screen. Open Windows
Explorer and drag the MP3 audio file
created by VLC and drop it on the
CDBurnerXP window to add it. Then
select ‘Burn disc’ from the Disc menu.
Once that’s done, you can play the CD
in any CD player.

In Issue 404 (bit.ly/webuser404),
Castman complained that his DVD
drive had disappeared after installing
Windows 10, and suggestions were
made about uninstalling IDE/ATA

but my drives are SATA not IDE.
Judging by the number of complaints
on the internet, this is a serious fault in
Windows. Alas the Anniversary
Update hasn’t fixed it either.
Ron O’Brien, via email
A
There isn’t a simple answer to
this, and some solutions have
worked for some people but not for
others. One person we know fixed the
problem simply by putting a DVD
in the drive. Another suggests using
the Windows Troubleshooter: open
the Control Panel and click
Troubleshooting, then click ‘View all’
and run ‘Hardware and Devices’.
Someone else found that the DVD
drive had been disabled in the BIOS
security settings. To check this, turn
on your PC and immediately press F1,
F2, F10, Del or whichever key your PC
uses to enter the BIOS setup, then
check all the sections.
Another solution is to download a
driver-update tool and update all the
drivers. Try the free version of Driver
Booster (bit.ly/drive409) but be
careful to avoid installing any of its
unnecessary optional extras.
If you’ve tried everything and the
problem still isn’t fixed, you may have
to buy a new DVD drive. There are
budget models available online for
around £10. An external USB model
is the simplest to install – you just
plug it in and it works. If you have a
desktop PC that’s easy to open, you
could replace the internal DVD drive
as most are held in position with just
four screws and a cable.

S Allan, via email

Before upgrading to Windows 10,
make sure you have the latest
version of your security software. With
Kaspersky, you can do this from within
the program or download and install the
latest version on top of the old one.
There shouldn’t be any problems, but if
there are, you can uninstall Kaspersky
security software before upgrading and
reinstall afterwards. When uninstalling,
watch out for the Saving Objects screen
and keep the following items: ‘License
information’, ‘Operational settings of the

licence is the most important because it
tells the software that you have already
paid for it when it’s reinstalled.

If so, it must be enormous because I have

D C Fergusson, via email

Windows 10 Anniversary Update is
huge. It takes a long time to
download, partly because of its size and
partly because it runs slowly in the
background so as not to interrupt your
normal computer use. If it were to
download at your internet connection’s
maximum speed, it wouldn’t take as
long, but it would stop you doing
anything else online at the same time.
To see if you have the Anniversary

Move WhatsApp to a phone
with no SIM
I recently had to return my phone to
have it repaired. I backed up all my files
where possible, including saving my
WhatsApp chats to Google Drive.
However, I was worried about losing
access to important correspondence
while my phone was being fixed. How
would I know if somebody was trying to
contact me, and would they realise that
I was not seeing their messages?
I decided to try moving WhatsApp
across to an old phone I had knocking
about, so I could continue to receive
messages. Unfortunately, the old device
would not take my newer phone’s nano
SIM and I didn’t have an adapter, but I
managed to find a way around it.
First, after checking my backup was up
to date (open WhatsApp Settings, tap
Chats and ‘Chat backup’), I uninstalled
WhatsApp from my newer phone. I then
downloaded and installed WhatsApp on
my older device (via Wi-Fi) and, when
prompted, entered my phone number.
A verification code was sent via text to
the newer phone, which I entered into
WhatsApp on the older phone. This
meant I was able to trick it into thinking
the SIM was installed, so it then restored
my chats from the cloud.
When the phone came back from its
repair, I simply repeated the process in
reverse to move my WhatsApp account
back to my current device.

Start folder secrets
The Start menu in Windows 7 was the
best Microsoft ever came up with and
although the Windows 10 Start menu
looks pretty, it’s still not as good.
The Windows 7 Start menu had a
folder called Startup where you could
put programs that you wanted to
automatically start with Windows (or
remove them to stop them from starting).
The Windows 10 Start menu doesn’t have
this but if you know where to look, you
can still use this feature.
Press Windows+R, type appdata,
press Enter and then navigate to:
Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs
This is where the Start menu items are
stored and, here, you’ll see a Start-up
folder. It works the same way as the
Startup folder in Windows 7. If you copy
items from the Programs folder and put
them in the Start-up folder, they will
automatically run when Windows is
launched.
Just to confuse matters, there is
another place where Start menu items
are stored:
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\
Start Menu \Programs.
This has more Start menu items and
another Start-up folder.

Restore old Instagram filters
Some time ago, Instagram introduced
a range of new photographic filters and,
when it did so, a number of the older
ones seemed to disappear. However,
I have just discovered that these filters
have not been removed but are only
hidden. To restore a hidden filter, swipe
all the way to the left through the
available filters until you see the Manage
button. Tap this and you can not only
enable and disable filters, but also
change their order in the list. If there’s
one that you find yourself using again
and again, this lets you make the filter
more accessible. Likewise, if there’s an
effect you really don’t like, you can
remove it from the available options.

Blurred background in
portraits
I followed the launch of the iPhone 7 with
interest. It has some interesting new
options, but while some may be new to
iPhone users, they aren’t new to everyone
else. Take the new ‘portrait picture’ mode
in the iPhone 7 Plus, for example. When
taking portrait shots of people, you can
blur the background to make the subject
stand out. This has been available on my
Samsung phone for some time.
If you have a Samsung phone, press
the Mode button at the bottom of the
screen in the Camera app, then press
Selective Focus. Tap the subject of your
photo to focus on it, then take the photo.
Open the Gallery to view the photo and,
when you tap the button in the middle,
you’ll see three images with different
focus effects. Select the one with the
blurred background. Many people aren’t
aware of this tool.

Paste screenshots quickly
The most common way of taking screen
grabs is to press the Print Screen button,
open up a picture-editing program such
as Paint, then paste the image and save it
wherever you want. A far quicker way is
to use Screenshot2Disk (screenshot2disk
.codeplex.com). Once installed, this tool
adds the right-click option ‘Paste
clipboard-image here’. Simply take a
screen grab by pressing Print Screen,
browse to the folder where you want the
image to be saved, then right-click and
select the option to paste. Where
possible, I’d recommend taking screen
grabs in the PNG format.

Find bandwidth hogs
Last issue, Ed Wright explained how to
find the apps that are hogging your
internet bandwidth by using the ‘Data
usage’ tool in Windows 10. However, Task
Manager provides an even simpler way to
find out what’s slowing you down on the
web. First, press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open
Task Manager, then click the Network tab
to sort the processes by the amount of
bandwidth they’re using. If large amounts
of bandwidth are being used by a process
you don’t recognise, it’s important that
you check what it is before stopping it.
One service that frequently uses a lot
of bandwidth is svchost.exe, which is
used by a variety of different Windows
processes. The easiest way to stop it is
to disable Background Intelligent
Transfer Service, which can be found
under the Services tab. Simply right-click
it and select Stop, but remember to
re-enable it again when you can spare
the bandwidth.

Whenever I make major changes to

Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn’t let

Saving the web page using File, Save

Alternatively, if you want to view the

In Chrome, you can do this by pressing
Ctrl+P and choosing ‘Save as PDF’ as the

‘Bribed’ reviews: did Amazon
turn a blind eye?
While I’m glad that Amazon is making it
harder for companies to get positive
reviews by sending customers free and
discounted products (Webometer,
Issue 408), I’m alarmed that this practice
was tolerated in the ﬁrst place. It makes
me question all the reviews I’ve ever read
on Amazon, many of which played a
large part in my purchasing decisions.
I wonder how bothered Amazon was
by the plague of bribed reviews. As it
chases mega proﬁts, it needs all the
buyers it can get, and a glut of positive
reviews can only lead to more buyers.
Amazon may be cracking down now, but
has it turned a blind eye for years?

Without ‘nagging’,
Windows 10 wouldn’t be free
I think Windows users should be a bit
more realistic about how Microsoft
works. I say this after reading your news
story in Issue 408, in which you lament
the possible return of the ‘nagging’
message urging 7 and 8.1 users to
upgrade to 10. Let’s remember that
Microsoft didn’t make Windows 10 free
as an act of charity. It did so because it
was conﬁdent that it could persuade
millions of users to upgrade. I was one of
those millions, and I was grateful,
because it gave me an escape route from
Windows 8.1.
Let’s face facts – nothing is truly “free”.
Someone, somewhere always incurs a
cost, and in this case it was the 7 and 8.1
users who were ‘nagged’ into upgrading.
I’m not saying these messages weren’t
irritating, but such marketing is how
Microsoft justiﬁed giving Windows 10
away for free. So, you win some, you lose
some. Nothing to get irate about.

Terms like ‘doxxing’ trivialise
web abuse
I was pleased to read in Issue 408 (News)
about new guidelines to target people
who bully others online. Your news story
touched on one of the reasons why, in
my opinion, online abuse has never been
taken seriously enough. It’s because of
the bizarre names given to some types of
abuse, such as ‘doxxing’. I had no idea
what this meant until reading your story.
It sounds intriguing, almost exciting.
There’s no indication of the ugly truth,
that doxxing is when someone publishes
your personal details online. Suddenly it
sounds less fun. If we stopped using
these daft euphemisms, I think there
would be more stigma attached to online
abuse and fewer people would do it.

n News, Issue 408, you predict that
Chrome will remain the world’s most
popular browser “for years to come”.
You’re probably right, but I’m not sure
it’s a cause for celebration. You also
say that competition
among browsers is
“a positive force”, but
I’m not convinced.
The problem as
I see it is that Google
has become very
complacent with
Chrome. This is
because its rivals pose
no serious threat.
Nobody uses Internet
Explorer any more,
and the less said
about Edge the
better. Firefox is an old favourite for
many people, but it will never regain the
users it lost in the past ﬁve years.
That leaves Chrome as the emperor
among browsers. The only way it could
be challenged is if another
company as big and
respected as Google
launches a browser. But
does such a company exist?
Apple, you say? But it
wouldn’t make a Windows
browser. Facebook perhaps,
but would you trust it with
your data? I know I wouldn’t.
Amazon? It would probably
bombard you with product
‘recommendations’ (adverts,
in other words).
Cast your mind back to the
fuss that ensued when Chrome
launched. It made so many headlines
because it was a browser from the
mighty Google. I remember feeling
excited about its prospects. If it had
been from an obscure company, it
wouldn’t have grown beyond a cult
following – like Opera.
You may think that I don’t use
Chrome, but I do. It is the world’s best
browser, after all. But it’s not the most
innovative. That accolade belongs to
Opera, which has introduced
pioneering tools such as built-in VPN
because it can’t survive on brand
recognition alone. I wish Chrome’s
rivals were more popular, to force
Google into taking greater innovative
risks with its browser.

EU copyright laws: thank

I read it twice just to make sure I grasped

EU wants to force news websites to
charge Google to link to their stories,
even if some sites don’t want to do this

Revisiting Vectrex will make

It was one of the gaming systems that
you said Lakka (www.lakka.tv) was

(pictured above) was a games console
from the early Eighties that was a bit like
having an arcade machine in your
bedroom. I was 11 when I got it for
Christmas (1983, I think), and spent the
following six months playing games like
MineStorm, Solar Quest and Berzerk.
But times move on and my Vectrex
was replaced by a Spectrum, which itself
was replaced by a Commodore, and so
on. I’ve always had a soft spot for it,
though, so I will attempt to relive its
glory days by installing Lakka on my PC.

74 2 - 15 November 2016
Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
like you to think she’s playing tough cop,
heralding the “record £400,000 fine” as
the biggest it has ever levied on a
company. But it’s still £100,000 less
than the maximum she could have
imposed on TalkTalk, and it’s
inexplicably soft given that the ICO’s
own investigation revealed that the leak
resulted from an
attack on a
database that
“was affected by
a bug for which a
fix had been
made available
over three-and-a-
half years before the cyber-attack, but
which had not been applied”. That’s
gross incompetence, pure and simple.
Will £400,000 make much of a
difference to TalkTalk? Will it convince
the firm not to be so cavalier with
customers’ data in the future? Hardly.
The company’s CEO, Dido Harding,
The ﬁne imposed on TalkTalk for leaking
customer data is pitiful, argues Barry Collins
Page 404
didn’t even seem to know in the
immediate aftermath of the attack if
customers’ bank details had been
encrypted, and later admitted they
hadn’t. Yet, for this abject failure to
protect her own customers from an
everyday attack perpetrated by a
teenager, she was paid £2.8 million in
2016, including a
bonus of
£220,000 for the
year 2016 alone.
That £400,000
fine represents
only 6% of what
TalkTalk paid its
four executive directors last year – it
barely makes a dent.
Yet, the ICO isn’t so coy about
punishing those who really can’t afford
it – us. It has a long history of imposing
big fines on taxpayer-funded bodies
responsible for far less serious data
leaks. Take Hampshire County Council,
which was fined £100,000 in August
“after documents containing personal
details of over 100 people were found in
a disused building”. Or London NHS
Trust, given a £180,000 fine in May for
revealing the email addresses of more
than 700 users of an HIV service. Both
serious offences, both deserving of
punishment, but both far less likely to
cause the kind of widespread fraud and
distress that the TalkTalk leak did.
When I asked a spokesperson for the
ICO why she thought that customers’
personal data was only worth £2.55 a
pop, she refused to comment, pointing
me back to the press statement in which
the new Information Commissioner
Elizabeth Denham says “TalkTalk should
and could have done more to safeguard
its customer information”. They’re not
the only ones who should and could
have done more, Ms Denham.
That £400,000 fine
represents only 6% of what
TalkTalk paid its four executive
directors last year
H
ow much is your personal data
– your phone number, address,
date of birth, even your bank
account number and sort code
– worth to you? Hundreds of pounds?
Thousands? It certainly could be worth
that much if a thief used the information
to steal your identity, empty your bank
account and leave you with a years-long
ﬁght to get your money back and restore
your credit history.
According to the Information
Commissioner, however, that
information is worth precisely £2.55.
Less than the cost of two issues of Web
User. Because that’s how much the
Information Commissioner’s Office
(ICO) decided to fine TalkTalk for its
“failure to implement the most basic
cyber security measures”, resulting in
the theft of 156,959 customers’ personal
details, 15,656 of which included bank
account numbers and sort codes.
