Foreword
One of the first projects I worked on, nearly forty years ago, was for a utility. An 
electric power company hired me to determine the best route, among various alter­
natives, for a proposed high-voltage transmission line. The challenge was to balance 
many factors: the cost of construction, impact on the environment, risk of failure 
of the line, and opposition from various communities. This meant I had to gather 
hordes of information about the different potential routes. Then, I had to devise a 
way to assess different factors, such as terrain, access, and proximity to sensitive 
recreational areas and population centers. I also had to take into consideration the 
areas that were more susceptible to natural hazards including earthquakes, land­
slides, lightning, and flooding. 
Most of the data I gathered was in the form of maps of every imaginable vin­
tage, shape, scale, accuracy, and authenticity. All of the maps were on paper. Even 
the unmapped data most often referenced places on the Earth. Everything linked to 
the geography of the region. The next step of course was to reconcile the various 
maps and data into a common view, a common map. 
Once the data was reconciled, I planned to assign values and weights—from 
poor to excellent—to each geographic area for each factor. The result of this analy­
sis would be one map that illustrated the best alternative route. At this point, I 
turned to the computer to help sort out all of the details. I worked with a few col­
leagues, and we invented a way to organize spatial information in a computer fil­
ing system. (There were no database management systems then.) We created algo­
rithms that performed spatial relationships. We devised ways to show the various 
factors on computer-generated maps. We all discovered that mapping and informa­
tion technology were meant for each other. Nearly half a century later, the software 
we developed evolved into what we now call ArcGIS. 
Of course, today the world of geographic information systems (GIS) has 
changed dramatically. Database management systems are commonplace. Smart 
phones and tablets now display what we once viewed on huge, bulky graphics ter­
minals. Much of the world’s computing is performed in the Cloud. As I reflect upon 
the difficulty of accumulating old maps, the shortage of tools for analysis, and the 
lack of computing power then, I am amazed that we were able to accomplish all 
that we did. 
Technology has exploded in capability. Content is at everyone’s fingertips. And 
the science of spatial and location analytics is beyond anything we could have 
imagined even a decade ago. However, the mission of GIS has stayed consistent: 

xiv 
Foreword
to help solve the world’s many problems by showing solutions on a map. This is 
something no other technology can do.
Maps help us understand our world. GIS provides a way to organize informa­
tion, perform spatial analysis, visualize patterns that are not obvious, and make 
connections to solve problems. Maps are perhaps the oldest form of communica­
tion known to humankind. Maps are a language unto themselves. Geography mat­
ters, whether we are looking for a new place to build a substation or wind farm or 
we are identifying the riskiest piece of a distribution system. 
When I think back to the transmission routing problem, I realize that it was an 
enormous task back then even with the aid of computers. Today—because we can 
share information via the Cloud, perform spatial analysis in seconds, and display 
analysis results on a smart phone or tablet—the solutions to such problems are 
commonplace.
Bill Meehan’s book dives deep into many areas of the electric utility business, 
drawing connections between the greatest needs of a utility and the many ways 
GIS can help. Hundreds of workflows are covered in this book, whether you are 
trying to improve distribution planning, roll out smart grids, or better understand 
customer behavior. I have known Bill for more than thirty years. He has a unique 
background with experience running electric operations for a power company, 
heading up an engineering department, and pioneering the application of GIS to 
solve utility problems. Bill’s passion for GIS and for the electric utility business is 
contagious and motivational. What I find most interesting about Bill, as evidenced 
by his many articles, his speeches, and his books, is that he has the ability to make 
complicated concepts simple.
Finally, his book reminds me of my roots—using geography to help solve a 
complex utility problem. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain 
insight into the use of GIS technology to enhance the performance of a utility.

Preface
A decade ago, I ran the electric operations for a large power company in the north­
eastern part of the United States. My boss was a guy named Russ. He was the presi­
dent and the chief operating officer. He was also an accountant. My background 
was power system engineering. So you would think that our philosophies would be 
miles apart. Yet, I probably learned more about running a power company from 
Russ than I ever did from sitting in my Power System Engineering class in grad 
school. Russ had a few simple rules, and he stuck to them religiously:
•• Make money for the shareholders.
•• Keep customers happy.
•• Keep employees safe.
•• Obey all laws and regulations.
•• Keep the lights on.
•• Respect the environment.
His “goldenest” rule (if there is such a word): 
•• Keep us out of trouble and out of the newspapers.
If we did all of those things, Russ would argue, we would have done a pretty 
good job of running a power company. The trick, of course, was to put these guide­
lines into a practice.
Early in my career, when I was a young intern at the power company, I worked 
with two engineers who could not be more opposite. Nick was a friendly, help­
ful old protection engineer. He spent his entire career designing relay protection 
schemes. As far as I knew, Nick never aspired to do anything else in the world. 
Apparently, one day, years before I arrived, Nick wrote a three-page memo to his 
boss detailing his philosophy on relay protection. Back then, memos were typed 
on old manual typewriters on yellow memo paper. One of the first documents my 
boss told me to review and memorize was Nick’s memo. The subject of the memo 
was “Protection of the electric system using relays.” I discovered that people re­
ferred to this document regularly in their daily work. The managers would often 
ask the substation design engineers if what they were doing complied with Nick’s 
memo. In all the years I worked there, people must have referred to Nick’s memo 
thousands of times. I would have to assume that in his entire forty-plus years of 

xvi 
Preface
service at the power company, Nick only wrote one memo. (Imagine today only 
having written one email?) No one ever referred to Nick’s memo as his “January 
4, 1969, memo,” or “Nick’s first memo,” or “Nick’s newest memo,” or “Nick’s 
memo about relay protection.” No, it was simply “Nick’s memo.” But obviously it 
was enough. The performance of the relay protection system was stunning. Rarely 
was there a misoperation. Nick’s memo was simple and profound. When Nick re­
tired, his associate and protégé, Johnny, picked up Nick’s work. Johnny followed 
Nick’s philosophy to the letter and as far as I know, never wrote a single memo in 
this life. He didn’t have to. Nick’s memo would do just fine.
Dan was the other guy. He was one of the substation design engineers. Dan 
was arrogant, a know-it-all, and sometimes plain nasty. Dan was a genius of an 
engineer. Each one of his substation designs was new, unique, and a wonder to 
behold. The problem was that every substation was different. Each had a different 
grounding scheme, a different bus-bar arrangement, and a completely different 
substation control system. He loved to try out the latest substation automation 
systems, which back then were fairly primitive. The only thing consistent from one 
substation design to the next was the relay protection schemes. Even Dan wouldn’t 
mess with Nick’s schemes. Dan created a maintenance nightmare. When something 
went wrong, the substation technicians had to scour the wiring diagrams and sche­
matics to figure out what Dan had done. Dan’s brilliance and complexities cost the 
company extra millions, lengthened restoration times, and soured customers.
So what do Dan, Nick, Johnny, and Russ have to do with geographic informa­
tion systems (GIS) and electric utility performance? Russ challenged me to figure 
how to deploy technology to solve the big problems that electric utilities face, not 
to just invent solutions to problems that were challenging and interesting to work 
on. Engineers like me can get so mired in the details that we forget the relatively 
simple goals of the utility company. So as I work with utilities to deploy GIS, I 
try to help companies use this marvelous GIS technology to solve their biggest 
problems. Often these problems are simple to understand, but hard to solve. What 
I learned from Nick (and Johnny) was to keep things simple and consistent. As 
the director of software development at Esri has stated many times to me: simple 
scales, complex fails. Finally, what I learned from Dan was that great ideas don’t 
often translate into great projects. And, of course, Dan’s complex designs tended 
to fall down over time. Lack of simplicity and consistency can be expensive and 
disruptive.
My experience over the years working with GIS in utilities, responding to 
requests for GIS projects, and meeting with thousands of people engaged in GIS is 
that many of these projects don’t really solve the big problems well and are often 
just too complicated. So, in this book, I will describe ways in which GIS can solve 
the big problems in simple and consistent ways, because after all what could be 
simpler than to view business results on a map? People have been doing this for 
centuries, well before Nick wrote his one and only memo.
What Is This Book About?
GIS for Enhanced Electric Utility Performance describes the how geospatial tech­
nology in the form of a modern enterprise geographic information system (GIS) can 

Who Is This Book For? 
xvii
be applied to all aspects of the electric utility business from smart grid to generation 
to transmission to distribution to the retail supply of electricity to customers. It is a 
journey that leads to a full discussion of what spatial technology for electric utilities 
is all about. This book is for people interested not only in the technical details of a 
GIS-enabled electric system, but also how such a system works in the real business 
world. As we examine the complexities of the electric utility business in the book, I 
will often remind readers of Russ’s simple rules, which when you think about it, are 
the strategic mission of an electric company. I am hopeful that it can explain to us 
how GIS contributes to the solutions to our biggest problems.
Who Is This Book For?
This book is for information technology managers and executives, GIS managers, 
system integrators, and application providers. Utility executives, managers, and 
operating supervisors will also find the book helpful to gain an appreciation of the 
how GIS is structured and built. This book can also help organizations better man­
age, integrate, and use their GIS to add real value to their business.
What’s Inside?
Historically, a single electric utility handled the entire supply chain of power de­
livery, production, wholesale delivery, local delivery, and retail. Over the last de­
cade or so, utility regulators have required these vertically integrated utilities to 
unbundle their business into the component parts. Yet, many of these vertically 
integrated utilities remain. So the organization of this book is along the lines of a 
typical vertically integrated utility. Regardless of whether a separate company or a 
separate division handles generation or transmission, the use of GIS technology and 
the workflows are the same.
The book has eight chapters, an introduction, and two appendices. The intro­
duction describes what GIS is and provides a glimpse into what the future of GIS 
may well be, including the use of Cloud computing and the broader use of smart 
mobile devices. Chapter 1 is an overview of how GIS fits within the utility business 
model. It gives some history of how electric utilities have used GIS and includes 
some common barriers to its broader application. The following chapters detail 
how each major division within a utility has used GIS or could use GIS to enhance 
their business. They detail energy supply, which includes generation, wholesale or 
electric transmission, electric distribution, emergency management, customer care, 
and shared services. Appendix A provides an overview of generic GIS technology, 
while Appendix B focuses on GIS and smart grid.

This book would not be possible without the inspiration of the electric utility cus­
tomers of GIS around the world who inspired me with their work. It constantly 
amazes me to see their creativity in the application of spatial technology to their 
very real problems. The electric utility business is a tough one, with challenges rang­
ing from miserable weather to demanding regulators to economic downturns. Yet 
given all these challenges, the power gets restored, customers get connected, and 
power drives the economic engines of the globe. It is the work of the utility employ­
ees who rise to these challenges, with GIS playing a growing role.

Introduction
This bulk of this book deals with business uses of GIS. Given that information tech­
nology changes so quickly, a book on the exact technical nature of GIS would likely 
be out of date as soon as the publisher puts the book to print. For example, more 
and more software companies are adopting the notion of Software as a Service 
(SaaS). This means that instead of a company actually installing software on its own 
servers and computers and upgrading versions of software, SasS to some extent 
resurrects the old idea of timesharing. In the early days of computing, companies 
offered users the use of their software and their computers to solve their business 
needs on a timesharing basis. Users just needed to load their input data (on punched 
cards) into a card reader that communicated via modem to the timeshare company. 
Hours or days later, the user got their results on a computer printout. SaaS is the 
same concept, except the input devices are smart phones, tablets, and PCs using 
the web. The results are immediate. As is the trend with many platform software 
provides, GIS is offered as SaaS.
So What Exactly Is a Utility GIS?
Perhaps the best reference guide to GIS is Roger Tomlinson’s book Thinking About 
GIS. It answers the question of what exactly a GIS is. While it doesn’t deal with util­
ities, it provides an outstanding and practical guide to the implementation of GIS.
A Computerized or Digital Map?
There are a number of ways to draw a map or illustrate a utility operating map us­
ing a computer. Perhaps the simplest way is to scan a paper map into a JPEG file. 
It’s a map and is created by a computer. Anyone can edit, email, and store the file in 
a database. A user could draw a map from scratch using a simple drawing program 
that comes free with any PC, tablet, or smart phone. A drafting technician could 
create a very complex and detailed map with an expensive computer-aided design 
(CAD) program and store the map drawing in a file. Finally, users can create maps 
with a GIS. 

xxii 
Introduction
Each Is Very Different
The scanned image is basically a picture of the old paper map. While it is possible 
to extract features such as symbols of transformers and poles from the image, the 
process is not exact or fast, and users could not easily create intelligent features on 
demand. A simple drawing program does produce unique features such as lines, 
circles, and text. However, there is no easy way to associate attributes of features 
with the symbols of the features.
Designers use complex CAD tools to generate detailed design drawings, like 
structural details, automobile parts, and buildings. People can use CAD tools to 
create maps for sure. Also they can link attributes to symbols, like lines and circles. 
So, users can create an inventory of parts from a CAD file.
What differentiates a scanned image, a simple line drawing, and a complex 
CAD drawing from a GIS is that a GIS is an information system, not a drafting 
or drawing system. The primary purpose of each of these tools (scanned images, 
simple drawing programs, and CAD systems) is to automate in some fashion the 
process of making a drawing using computer technology. Each file they create rep­
resents a distinct drawing. A drawing has a boundary, a border, a finite limit to its 
extent. 
When utilities recognized that their sets of maps were getting more and more 
complicated and required more staff just to maintain them, they looked to comput­
ers to help solve the productivity problem of how to create the maps they needed 
and were used to using with computers. They invented ways to replicate the old 
maps using computers. If they needed map sheets at 1 in = 400 ft, they created 
separate files for those sheets. If they needed a map of the same area at 1 in = 50 
ft, they created yet another map sheet at that scale. If they needed an overview 
map at say 1 in =10,000 ft, they created yet another file. Each of these files repli­
cated a map sheet. If they modified one map sheet, they would have to remember 
to modify all other related map sheets. In effect, they automated a legacy process. 
Rather than attempting to understand and transform the larger and more strategic 
business processes that required mapping, they instead attempted to automate the 
tactical and legacy processes of map making. They retained the concept that maps 
were simply individual and standalone drawings. Once they automated the legacy 
mapping process, they simply plotted the maps from the computer, but used the 
printed maps in the exact same way they used the old paper maps. 
Since the GIS is an information system, not a map sheet creation machine, 
it can create maps on the fly that display new information each time. In effect, 
the GIS is a spatial data management system, like a database management system 
(DBMS). Like a DBMS, when someone queries it, it produces the result of the que­
ry in the form of a map. In fact, the GIS can produce results of a query in a table as 
well. It can produce a list of all transformers that the company has not maintained 
in the last two years in district 1. Unlike a map sheet system, there are no stored 
drawings. Instead each output is simply the result of a spatial database query. The 
output can be any scale, using any symbol, without worrying about the borders of 
a conventional map sheet. It can create a map from the query, “Show me all the 
power failure locations in the world for 2012 or show me all the power failures in 
Westerville, Illinois.” This query is all within the ability of the GIS—provided, of 
course, the GIS has the data it needs. 

So What Exactly Is a Utility GIS? 
xxiii
GIS can take information from sources not stored in its data files and include 
that data as part of the display as if the data were part of the GIS. In database 
terms, this concept is similar to a join. As long as there is some common key, two or 
more systems can seem as one. Although any feature in the GIS (e.g., a transformer) 
can be easily integrated with another system if the equipment has a common iden­
tifier. Thus, the GIS doesn’t have to replicate attributes of a piece of equipment if 
another system, like a materials system or enterprise asset management (EAM) 
system, maintains that data. The GIS can access that data, when and only when it 
needs it.
GIS can combine scanned images, rasters and light detection and ranging (Li­
DAR) imagery as long as the images have the same reference coordinate system as 
the GIS. As will be discussed a number of times in the text, the notion of combining 
spatial data sources produce some fascinating results.
It shouldn’t matter where the data is stored (in a private cloud, on premise 
cloud, the open Internet, or in light databases on tablets). Further, it shouldn’t 
matter how users get the data (over the web, on a heavy desktop client, or through 
web services). The notion that a GIS creates map products just like the old mapping 
department with its Mylar and linen original maps and India ink pens would be 
like using a chain saw to cut trees without turning the saw on. 
What is a GIS? A casual answer is that it’s a computer program that creates 
maps. People can display those maps on computer screens. Users can plot or print 
the computer-generated maps. In fact, the maps can look very much like the old-
fashioned maps that map makers have created for centuries. The fact that people 
have relied so heavily on maps suggests that there is something special about a 
map. It is a universal communication method for figuring out where things or 
people are located. No one really knows who created the very first map. What we 
do know is that maps are as popular today as they have ever been. The popularity 
of consumer mapping apps on smart phones and universal appeal of navigation 
systems has made most people map and location aware. Figure I.1 illustrates a 
modern web-based map of an electrical distribution system. Mapping of utility 
systems is natural.
Certainly a GIS does create maps. At its heart, it is not a map-making ma­
chine, a mapping app, or a computer program designed to make maps more easily 
or to make them clearer. A GIS is an information system whose main purpose is 
discovery. It manages data organized by location for the purpose of visualization, 
analysis, and dissemination throughout the organization. It creates new informa­
tion from raw data. If the primary use of a GIS is to replicate old manual maps, 
then users are vastly underutilizing it. If instead they use the GIS to transform a 
business by giving greater insight into a business problem that results in informed 
decision making, which in turn leads to focused action, then the GIS is doing its 
job. If they use the GIS to document the location of an underground cable, that’s 
valuable to be sure. If in addition, they use the GIS to discover which cable is most 
likely to fail, then that’s much more valuable. 
For example, a GIS could answer this question: “Where are there places in 
my electric network that a single event could have the most devastating impact?” 
The GIS results would show a simple map, with a big red circle around the most 
vulnerable parts of the network. The action resulting from this knowledge is that 
the utility takes action to mitigate the high risk. So, in this case, the business result 

xxiv 
Introduction
is not to create a better, neater, faster-produced map, but to save the utility lots of 
money and serve its customers better.
The litmus test of the GIS’s impact would be: “Can the utility document im­
provements in their key performance indicators that are directly attributed to the 
GIS?” If not, then the GIS has not served its purpose. 
Like most information systems, the GIS consists of several parts: a set of soft­
ware programs (desktop, applications, server software, database management sys­
tems, operating systems), hardware (servers, storage systems, the cloud, networks, 
smart phones, tablets, PCs), and data. Today a GIS is part of the overall informa­
tion technology (IT) infrastructure that includes the ability of its data and functions 
to be fully integrated with other key financial, customer, and real-time IT systems 
at the utility. This is relatively new.
What makes the GIS different from other information systems is the notion of 
information layers or themes. Figure I.2 illustrates the various layers of informa­
tion an electric company keeps. These themes or layers can exist in the GIS. Elec­
tric companies worry about their electric network, of course, but also about the 
attitudes of their customers and the sensitive habitat along their transmission right 
of ways. They may also worry about where they are spending maintenance dollars 
compared to other areas or where the infrastructure is most vulnerable to terrorist 
attack or weather events. They worry about where their employees are and where 
they are making or losing money. The network, supporting structures, customers, 
land, environmental features, and streets are common layers in a utility GIS. Less 
common, though interesting, are predictive themes or layers, like flood overlays, 
climate change impacts, lightning strike history, acid rain contamination, and even 
bird migration (critical for the site selection of wind turbines). Layers help define

what information products need to be produced to help in the utility’s decision 
making. A layer is analogous to the old system where people made transparent 
layers for, say, a city for each decade to see how the city progressed through time. 
Each layer added the changes to the city map. 
So just prior to a major hurricane event, for example, the utility might be inter­
ested in the layers that illustrate where shelters are located or where flood waters 
may rise to inundate their critical facilities. 
Geocentric Versus Geoenabled
There are two major categories of GIS usage, geocentric and geoenabled. Most 
utilities built their GIS to capture the essential elements of the electric network—the 
poles, wires, and transformers. This type of GIS application is geocentric. The work 
flow involves transactions to the map, particularly the authoring of the components 
of the map. So any process that creates the features of the map is geocentric. Tools 
like adding, modifying, and deleting elements in the map are geocentric. In a local 
government application, adding parcel layers, digitizing easements, and updating 
ownership attributes of land features are examples of the geocentric usage of the 
GIS.

Introduction
Taking Advantage of Mapping
There are dozens of workflows at an electric utility that historically have not lever­
aged location or the use of maps. For example, a utility may have been performing 
customer satisfaction surveys for years. For many utilities, customer satisfaction 
rankings are one of top key performance indicators. The results of those surveys are 
commonly delivered in a table, spreadsheet, business intelligence (BI) dashboard, or 
a report. So the customer satisfaction improvement workflow might look like this:
•• Hire a company to perform a customer satisfaction survey or participate in a 
regional customer satisfaction survey.
•• Review the results of the survey and compare to a benchmark or to a best-
performing utility in the region.
•• Develop a plan to improve customer satisfaction.
•• Take the survey again and see if the improvement program produced any 
change.
This workflow misses two important components. First, it doesn’t highlight 
where customer satisfaction is most severe, nor does it identify why customers 
might be unhappy. Plotting the results of the customer satisfaction in GIS identifies 
those regions of highest dissatisfaction. Plotting other factors like poor reliability 
allows the utility to correlate the poor customer satisfaction with other causes. The 
company could add other factors, like the locations of high bill complaints or un­
popular tree trimming activity to gain additional insight. Once the where and the 
why have been determined, the company can execute a focused program to address 
the core issues. Figure I.3 illustrates how the GIS can plot the results of a customer 
satisfaction survey.
This is an example of geoenabling a workflow. Just plotting the results of the 
survey alone gives some insight, but correlation of many layers of information 
sharply focuses the analysis and leads utilities to action that is based on science, 
not just on intuition. Correlation of spatial information is one of the key aspects of 
a modern GIS. Another example of geoenabling is the analysis of risk of transmis­
sion failure. In most cases, utilities determine the risk to the transmissions system 
by network analysis, like load flows, short circuit, state estimation, and stability. 
However, these systems do not take into account risk factors such as proximity to 
small airports, earthquakes, or landslides that could increase the risk of failure and 
extend the restoration time in the event of a transmission line failure. GIS routinely 
manages these factors. Adding the results of network analysis with the spatial ana­
lytics of the GIS greatly enhances the insight into transmission risk as well as helps 
focus risk-mitigation activities.
Geocentric Workflows Build Spatial Content
Geocentric workflows have been around for a long time. Most utilities have aban­
doned the use of paper maps to document their networks and have adopted some 
form of GIS to do this. Many have also implemented a design process within the 
GIS. These workflows are geocentric since the GIS directly does much of the work. 

The Future of Utility GIS 
xxvii
In these cases, the workflows actually create or author geographic content. Thus, a 
workflow that creates new or edits geographic content is geocentric.
Geoenabling Enriches Existing Information 
A workflow that uses the geographic content to supplement an existing workflow 
is geoenabled. Just displaying the results of a survey on a map is geoenabled, but to 
really get the benefit from the GIS, adding spatial analytics to the workflow adds 
insight and discovery. A common example of advanced analytics is in the analysis 
of elections. Election analysts plot projected voting patterns as the results pour in, 
but also add other factors, like demographic data, to get very accurate predictions 
of what will happen. Figure I.4 gives some examples of geocentric and geoenabled 
workflows.
The Future of Utility GIS
Client server technologies for GIS will continue for some time now. In this situa­
tion, the users operate a heavy client on a desktop computer to add content to the 
data stored by the data management server of the GIS. Due to the complexities of 
the data and the detail required to capture all the electric utility assets, users will 
continue to need the client horsepower to perform these tasks. There will be more 
evolutionary improvements in the technology. GIS desktop software will become 
faster, more user-oriented, and easier to use. The modeling of complex networks 
will continue to improve, particularly to meet the needs of the smart grid. However, 
even this desktop-client server model is evolving to incorporate web-based editing 
and cloud technologies. So the heavy client desktop user will be accessing data over 
the web, even though the desktop users may not even know it. Users will migrate 
to web-based or smart device technology for simple transactions, like adding an 
electric service drop to the network.

Introduction
Enormous strides have been made over the last several years to capture accu­
rate land features. Historically, utilities managed their base maps themselves. That 
will change. Utilities will soon abandon their private base maps and subscribe to 
a service that publishes up-to-date land information (that is based on cartographic 
standards) where the data (streets, topographic, imagery) is stored in the cloud. 
There will be new technologies to capture data. Despite the decades that utilities 
have been using GIS, studies have shown that they have only captured a fraction of 
the real facility data. Utilities have yet to incorporate in their corporate GIS much 
of the underground structural data or the pipe-type cable data for underground 
transmission. There will be more use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), a pro­
cess that captures points to detect three-dimensional features, and image capture 
to gather data. Also, there will be new technologies to automate data capture from 
laser scanning and imagery. Gone will be hordes of people doing field inventory.
There will be a movement toward viewing the facilities model of GIS (the old 
automated mapping/facility management systems—we will discuss this in Chap­
ter 1) as one component of an enterprise GIS, but not the center of GIS. Instead, 
this system will be simply a feeder system into an enterprise view of the utility, 
strongly spatially enabled. Corporate systems, like customer relationship manage­
ment (CRM), enterprise asset management (EAM), and distribution management 
systems (DMS), will all be spatially enabled, getting their functionality from web 
services using GIS technology, probably in a standard interoperability format. 
The cloud is the step change. While security and reliability concerns will con­
tinue, utilities will figure them out, like they did when they put in SCADA systems. 
Years ago, people fought tooth and nail to retain staffing of substations, saying 
that no way would they rely on remote switching over a telephone line that some­
one could easily hack. The utilities figured it out. Cloud vendors will host the vast 
majority of enterprise tasks in their cloud. This includes nearly all the applications 
that involve spatial technology.
Coupled with the cloud will be mobile technology. There has been an explosion 
of smart phones and tablets, all reliant on the cloud for their intelligence. There will 
be very little distinction between applications in the office and on the smart phone 
or tablets. GIS on the smart mobile device will become commonplace soon. Adding 
data or reporting an event or a problem in the electric system on a smart phone will

cause it to show up automatically in the GIS desktop, the web, and on everyone 
one else’s smart phone. The GIS is all about location. Today, nearly every device, 
smart phones, tablets, and Internet sites are location aware. The GIS will leverage 
that location awareness.
GIS at utilities are relatively closed to outside data. This will change. The ac­
cess to online spatial content continues to grow exponentially. A modern GIS will 
increasingly access and publish data to online communities enhancing communica­
tion and collaboration.
Nearly all the computing we do today will be based on some form of web 
services. Most utilities will move much of their IT infrastructure to a private cloud 
managed by someone else. Application development time for focused tasks will 
shrink from months to hours. Application time for more complex applications will 
shrink from years to weeks. This will be accompanied by a strong self-service trend 
in utilities, which will rely more on good data from the core GIS. For example, the 
days of electricians calling in to a call center for a new customer connection will be 
gone soon. This all will be done with a self-service app on a smart phone or tablet. 
The smart grid will change the face of IT in utilities forever. Since the smart grid 
relies so much on good data from the GIS, this evolving technology will push the 
GIS to take on a more mission-critical role. The smart grid will require better data 
management, particularly from the mountains of data that will be coming from 
smart meters (the so called big data). GIS will do more spatial analysis so utilities 
can better understand customer behavior in relationship to their delivery infra­
structure. The smart grid will demand solid data management, spatial analysis, and 
better visualization and dissemination of the information from their GIS.
So going forward, there will be a need for a number of desktop users of GIS 
creating new content. There will be a strong place for ruggedized devices in the 
field for the hardcore workers, but they will probably be more web enabled. How­
ever, there will be a greater need for servers and subscription services for the rest of 
the information in the cloud accessed through consumer-friendly mobile devices.

GIS and the Business of the Utility
Electric utilities face enormous challenges. They face increasing:
••
Regulatory pressure: including meeting demands to reduce carbon emissions 
and add renewable resources;
••
Demand: despite the financial downturn demand will surely rise, espe­
cially as the transportation sector moves away from petroleum and toward 
electricity;
••
Infrastructure age: as infrastructure is aging faster than it is being replaced;
••
Worker age: as utility workers represent one of the oldest workforces in 
industry;
••
Customer demands: as customers are used to instant gratification and online 
access to information, and they are far less tolerant of interruptions;
••
Costs: despite the economic downturn costs continue to rise, particularly 
labor costs;
••
Transparency: as utilities are easy targets.
At the same time the resources available to the electric companies are shrink­
ing. They face decreasing:
••
Revenues;
••
Fuel options;
••
Tolerance for mistakes;
••
Access to capital;
••
Public acceptance of rate increases;
••
Land resources to build their infrastructure.
Utilities will need to change quickly to meet these pressing challenges. They 
will need to rethink many of the ways they have been doing business for more than 
a century.
A GIS will not keep older workers from retiring, make access to capital easi­
er, or lower the expectations of customers. It will not stop wind farms from kill­
ing birds or make solar energy more affordable. However, a GIS will provide a 

2

spatial context for problem solving. The vast majority of problems facing power 
companies involve location, such as:
••
Where to site a wind farm;
••
Which transmission lines are at a high risk of failure;
••
Where to search for geothermal resources;
••
How to run a transmission line from a proposed power plant to the grid;
••
Where to place sensors on the electric transmission and distribution system 
to create a smart grid;
••
Where to run telecommunications systems to best communicate with smart 
meters;
••
Which customers hate their trees trimmed;
••
Whether there is a spatial correlation between customer satisfaction and high 
bill complaints;
••
Where there are sagging transmission lines out of compliance;
••
Which substations will be under water during a 100-year storm event;
••
Which transmission lines are located in tornado prone areas;
••
What the impact is of a rising water level of coastal electric equipment.
GIS: A Spatial Context for Solutions
GIS helps solve problems by making it simpler to discover relationships.
The problems listed here are tough. Since GIS is such an integrating frame­
work, and since the common denominator or theme of these questions is location, 
utilities can display a variety of data sources and results of analysis together in the 
same view. That consolidated view is often called a common operating picture or 
situational awareness dashboard like shown in Figure 1.1.
GIS is more than just seeing information on a map. It provides the ability to 
see relationships and help determine not only the “where” of something bad hap­
pening, but provide the spatial context of the “why” something might occur or has 
occurred. It extends the data to give answers to problems that otherwise would not 
have been seen. It connects the dots.
Transforming a Century-Old Industry
Utilities can apply GIS to many of the workflows in the various departments of the 
power company. Electric utilities have been around for over a century. Like most 
mature industries, work processes became compartmentalized. That’s a polite way 
of saying that departments and organizations operate in their own silos. As infor­
mation systems developed over the last several decades, the information systems 
supported the silos. Sharing data from one organization to the next became more 
and more difficult. As utility operations grew increasingly complex, data duplica­
tion became commonplace. 

GIS: A Spatial Context for Solutions 
3
Do You Know Where Your Poles Are?
One utility in the Southwest United States reported that data about a wood pole 
existed on as many as 40 records—some stored on spreadsheets, others in data­
bases, and even some still in notebooks. The information about poles was stored in 
so many different places because each business unit that dealt with poles kept their 
own records of pole information, either not trusting another business unit or more 
likely not even aware there was data duplication. That same utility did not have an 
accurate count of their poles. The accounting systems reported one number, while 
the engineering records had another. Since this utility and most utilities in the U.S. 
have to pay property taxes for their assets, they had no clear picture of what they 
should be paying in taxes. This same utility also had to report to their public utili­
ties commission (PUC) their total value of their installed plant on a regular basis in 
a rate case. Should either the local municipalities or the state PUC call for an audit, 
there was a good chance that the value of their pole plant would be incorrect. An 
audit would likely result in some kind of fine, back payment, or at the very mini­
mum public embarrassment. 
Bad things happen when a utility cannot coordinate its data. For example, if 
cable inspection data is not coordinated with age or capacity data, operators might 
run the cables too hot and they may fail. If up-to-date flood data is not coordinated 
with substation location, then substations could end up under water during a big 
storm.
Utilities deal with data in a variety of forms. In fact, some of the data that 
utilities use to run their business is not stored anywhere. Older workers pass vital 
information from their generation of workers to the next. Much of the data the 
utility uses, perhaps as much as 90 percent, has some degree of location associated 
with it. Where should a new transmission line run; what is the evacuation limits of

a nuclear plant; where do the emergency workers live; where is the current loca­
tion of a trouble truck; where are insulators coated with salt; where are lightning 
arrestors that were recently recalled due to a manufacturing flaw? Location is the 
common denominator for much of the disparate data a utility uses (and much of 
this lives only in the minds of its workers). 
GIS Helps to Put Locational Data in Order
A modern GIS has three main capabilities:
••
Managing data;
••
Performing spatial analysis;
••
Creating awareness.
Managing Data
The first capability of the GIS is data management. Regardless of the format of the 
digital locational data, the GIS has the ability to accept information as long as there 
is some kind of spatial reference, such as latitude/longitude or street address, and 
to organize the information in the form of a map. It can then create layers of one 
kind of spatial information displayed over another. If a utility has a customer sat­
isfaction problem, the utility could create one layer that is the result of a customer 
satisfaction survey with the average scores (for example, from 1 to 10) organized 
by zip code. Another layer could be average distribution reliability by zip code, 
measured say in average annual customer minutes out of power. Together they tell 
a story about which areas have poor reliability and low customer satisfaction. Then 
if the utility wanted to gain more insight, the utility could add a third layer that 
lists average income by zip code. With these three spatially coordinated layers, the 
utility could gain ever-greater insight into the how certain groups within income 
levels view reliability over other groups. The utility could add other layers such as 
where there is a concentration of high bill complaints. The GIS has the ability to 
organize these various layers, even if they have different projections and accuracies 
and simply visualize the layers together.
This notion of organizing layers of information together is not new. People 
used transparencies to illustrate how one set of images relates to another. Before 
GIS, planners created overlays that displayed street networks on one transparent 
layer. They then created another overlay, say, zoning boundaries. They created oth­
er overlays, such as vegetated wetland boundaries. Another layer might be vacant 
land or conservation land. They lined up the various overlays along some kind of 
reference, like grid lines and could then visualize all layers together. The purpose of 
combining these overlays was to gain a new understanding of the data. So these lay­
ers could show the city planner which areas could or could not be developed. The 
purpose of combining these layers together was for decision making and action.
The GIS does this process of combining different types of data digitally for the 
same purpose—to gain additional insight as to what action to take or what policies 
to develop. 

GIS Helps to Put Locational Data in Order 
5
Spatial Analysis
Just seeing the various layers is interesting, but the real power is to perform analy­
sis on the layers. This is the second capability of the GIS, spatial analysis. In the 
previous example, suppose the city planner wanted to find a parcel that was zoned 
industrial, was not in a vegetated wetland, and was within a mile of a major high­
way. Depending upon how large the area of study was, in the old days using the 
transparencies that process could take considerable time. The planner would have 
to study each parcel, measure how far each possible parcel is from a highway and 
then mark the parcels that met the planner’s qualifications. Using the GIS’s data 
management capabilities, that process would be easier, since the planner could eas­
ily pan and zoom around the display, turning on and off layers, but it would still 
be tedious. Using spatial analysis, the GIS could perform a spatial regression, along 
with a distance optimization, and discover those parcels within a mile of a highway, 
zoned industrial, and not in a vegetated wetland. This process would take seconds. 
Awareness
Once the GIS performs the analysis, the planner would like to show the results in a 
way that is meaningful to others. The notion of awareness is the third capability of 
GIS. In the previous example, once the GIS determined which parcels met the cri­
teria, the planner now needs a means to visualize and disseminate the results. This 
allows others to gain awareness of the analysis and to be able to take some kind 
of action. The GIS can package the various data layers (the zoning, the wetlands, 
the parcels) along with a new layer, which the GIS creates, that shows only those 
parcels that meet the criteria and publish the results to all interested parties. Today 
those results can be published to the web, desktops, and mobile devices (e.g., lap­
tops, tablets, and smart phones). 
The three essential capabilities of the GIS are as follows:
1.	 Data management—the ability to consume virtually any kind of data that 
has some spatial reference and organize the data along some common co­
ordinate system;
2.	 Spatial analysis—the ability to transform the spatial data (in whatever 
form) into new information using a wide variety of spatial operators, like 
intersections, unions, clusters, buffers, measures, regressions, and hundreds 
of other operators to produce new information that often is the answer to a 
business problem;
3.	 Awareness—the ability to visualize the collection of data as well as the 
results of spatial analysis in the form of a map (or a report, chart, or dia­
gram organized by location) that facilitates groups sharing that informa­
tion using a variety of delivery mechanisms (e.g., the web, a smart phone, 
a desktop).
In the previous example, the city planner used the GIS to collect data from a 
variety of sources, perform a spatial analysis on the data to produce a result, and 
publish the results to the city officials, other departments, and maybe even the 
general public. See Figure 1.2 for a diagram of the three GIS capabilities and how 
they interrelate.

GIS and the Business of the Utility
Development of GIS at Electric Utilities
To fully understand where GIS needs to go, it’s helpful to understand how GIS has 
developed at electric companies. GIS has its roots in the mapping departments. 
Utilities have used maps since the beginning of the electric utility industry. As they 
rolled out their new facilities, they needed a means to keep track of what was built 
in the streets, alleyways, and under the ground. The most convenient way was 
to show the poles, wires, pipes, and transformers on a map. Some utilities were 
better at this than others. Some just captured the medium voltages; some took 
careful measure of the phase relationships; some even detailed the type of open 
wire pole construction, such as that shown in Figure 1.3. Others were not so care­
ful or complete. While industry groups issued standard symbols for electric power 
equipment, rarely did these standardized symbols find their way onto the mapping 
systems. 
One other aspect of the old hand-drawn mapping systems was the lack of ad­
herence to any cartographic or coordinate standard. Utilities either created their 
own street maps or used whatever available map books happened to be published 
at the time. The notion of the map book became the standard format for the utili­
ties. In the early days of the utilities, map books were organized into pages and 
each page represented a piece of geography. Often across the top of the page was 
a series of letters, and along the side a series of numbers. In the back of the book, 
the map book publishers created an index. They assigned each street in the index 
to a page in the map book and a letter and number. This created a map grid, with 
each grid having some kind of identification. Utilities adapted this scheme to their 
early mapping systems. Often they made each grid into a separate map sheet. They

then drafted onto to this map sheet the electrical facilities that were contained 
within that map grid. Over the years, these map grid numbers found their way 
into other information systems, like customer information systems, and outage and 
work management systems.
Mapping Systems Get Dysfunctional
These map sheets got more crowded as the electric system developed, so utilities 
created additional map products, such as overview maps and index maps. Some­
times, they created one set of maps for different systems, like one for the medium-
voltage network and another for the low-voltage network. One utility created a 
completely different series of maps for their secondary network system, radial un­
derground system, and overhead primary system. Some separated their map prod­
ucts by voltage level. What happened, of course, was that these mapping systems 
became increasingly unwieldy. Utilities found that it became more and more dif­
ficult to keep these maps up to date. Changes came rapidly during periods of high 
expansion. Operating groups grew concerned about the currency of these maps and 
would keep their own separate maps, often not sharing their maps with the map­
ping department.
Old Mapping Workflows
Whenever the utility received a request for a new service or the engineers deter­
mined the distribution system needed to be upgraded, they created a work order 
or job order. The work orders started out as a description of the work to be done, 
like adding a new extension to an existing distribution line or installing a new 
transformer to feed a new shopping mall. Designers created construction docu­
ments that illustrated to the line crews exactly what they needed to build. They 
included sketches showing construction details. Almost always, these construction

documents included some kind of map, showing the location of the work to be done 
and the details of where they crews needed to install new equipment. 
The basis for these maps were the hand-drawn operating maps that illustrated 
the current location of the existing system, the so called as-is condition of the elec­
trical system. Once the crews completed the work detailed in the work order, the 
line foreman or supervisor marked up the construction drawings, including the 
maps, to show what actually had been built compared to what the designers had 
specified. Often what the designers actually specified was somewhat different from 
what the crews actually built in the field. These marked-up sketches then were re­
turned to the engineering department. There the designers or mappers would take 
the marked-up sketches, called as-built sketches, and incorporate this information 
onto to the various map sheets. Since these map sheets were hand drawn, the pro­
cess of updating these maps was extremely time consuming. 
It was not uncommon for a utility to accumulate a large backlog of these 
marked-up work order sketches. As the electric systems became more complicated 
and extensive, utilities needed to add more and more people to the mapping depart­
ment just to keep up with the backlog of data. If the utility allowed the backlog to 
grow too high, the engineers, designers, and field operating people ended up using 
information that was out of date. This created all kinds of problems and costs to 
the utility. Crews would be dispatched to wrong locations or customers would be 
out of power longer, since the trouble shooters, who searched for the cause of a 
failure, would not be using the most up-to-date information to determine the loca­
tion of a problem.
Development of Digital Mapping Systems—the Birth of AM/FM
Thus, utilities needed a faster way of updating the operating maps from the as-built 
sketches created by the field. Computer graphics developed during the late 1970s. 
Some utility early adopters converted their old hand-drawn maps to digital maps. 
These early systems continued to develop well into the 1980s. By the mid 1980s, 
digital utility mapping systems had grown popular. Utilities began to demand that 
these mapping systems do more than just make editing maps faster, but saw a need 
to somehow link attributes of the various equipment shown on the map to the car­
tographic representations of the features. These early utility mapping systems were 
called automated mapping/facilities management (AM/FM) systems. 
The term AM/FM still is used today, although it is often used interchangeably 
with GIS. Often, the term AM/FM/GIS is used to describe a digital mapping sys­
tem that is primarily used to document features of the electric system (most often 
the electric distribution system). For many utilities, the term GIS implies the same 
capabilities of an AM/FM system. While AM/FM systems helped the problems 
associated with the constant editing of the operating maps, their use was limited 
to the operations and engineering department. In effect the information products 
produced by these systems were essentially the same as the information products 
produced by hand-drawn maps, with the exception that it was easier to create some 
statistics (e.g., how many transformers were in a certain map grid). It was also 
easier to locate equipment by name using simple queries. 
The focus of AM/FM systems was (as the term implies) to create a digital oper­
ating map (that looked almost exactly like the manual maps) and to document the

facilities that made up the medium-voltage and sometimes low-voltage distribution 
systems. However, utilities soon discovered that the promise of using these systems 
for other business needs or for additional information products was sorely lack­
ing. When utilities began to see the value of combining their trouble call systems 
with digital mapping, they saw that critical information was either missing or inac­
curate. In the U.S., for example, much of the medium-voltage system consists of 
a mix of three-phase and single-phase lines. Yet in a large number of cases, phase 
determination was missing. In some cases, the connectivity of the lines was either 
missing or not precise. Thus, the value of using the AM/FM system as a foundation 
for outage management was less than they had hoped for.
Given the amount of data and the redundancy of the data sources themselves, 
just on the distribution system, the cost to convert this data to digital form was 
enormous. The idea of an AM/FM system was to replace the very labor-intensive 
hand-drawn mapping process and to reduce the steadily climbing backlog of work 
orders. However, utilities often failed to capture any additional information (like 
phasing or connectivity or underground structures) that they might need in the 
future. The result was that the vast majority of AM/FM systems were largely used 
only by the mapping department. The output products were cleaner and easier to 
read, but were no more informative than the hand-drawn maps that proceeded 
them.
Not Much Changed
The consumers of the AM/FM systems didn’t change their processes either. The 
mapping group plotted their computerized maps on to transparent paper. Just as 
they had been doing for decades, the mapping group copied the fresh plots using 
the old blueprint machine and mailed the prints all around the company. Other than 
the print quality, the consumers of the maps hardly knew the difference. In fact, 
whenever supervisors, dispatchers, and other field workers noticed discrepancies 
from the prints, they marked up these copies with red markers. They were reluctant 
to replace the newly copied revisions in their files, because someone would have 
to check the new print against the old marked up print to see if all the new print 
contained all the corrections from the old print. Too often, the new prints would 
pile up just waiting to be reconciled with the prints the field people used. This 
workflow was identical whether the AM/FM system created the new print or the 
print came from an old hand-drawn map. Figure 1.4 illustrates the workflow and 
how awkward it was.
After spending the millions of dollars converting data from the hand-drawn 
maps and records to the AM/FM system, the utilities didn’t really solve the problem 
of increasing backlog of work, out-of-date maps, and inconsistencies between the 
mapping system and the information about what was really going on in the field. 
Utilities rarely worried about the absolute accuracy of the location of what they 
depicted on the maps, as long as they were relatively correct. Many made sure that 
their old mapping grids and identification systems remained. These digital mapping 
systems were good at replicating the old mapping products and for some account­
ing and reporting data. Rarely did they have the ability to do any kind of spatial 
analysis. 
While utilities used computers to generate the maps, the concept of the map 
sheet, a finite piece of paper, with specific dimensions remained intact.

GIS Is Different
At about the same time that AM/FM systems were being developed, GIS in its tru­
est form was rapidly developing. GIS, unlike AM/FM, was about solving spatial 
problems, not just about documenting assets. One of the earliest applications of 
GIS in the utility field was electric transmission site selection. The problem facing a 
transmission operator is to find the best path for a new transmission line subject to 
a number of constraints (See Foreword.) Prior to GIS, transmission planners had to 
analyze different factors, such as slope, earthquake zones, proximity to population 
centers, environmental concerns, wildlife impacts, and access. The process involved 
gathering data from many different sources, then attempting to piece them together 
into some kind of rational map to help the designers come up with the lowest con­
struction cost and risk proposal, with the least amount of permitting and public re­
lations problems. These assessments could take months. What often happened then 
was that during the permitting process, citizen groups and other interveners could 
block the progress of the project. The result was that the utility would in effect go 
back to the drawing board and begin the route selection process all over again.
The idea of GIS was to create a way to capture geographic information in a 
database. Information such as the topography of the land, locations of problem­
atic areas, indigenous population burial grounds, sensitive habitat areas, or areas 
that were sensitive from an aesthetic perspective could be stored as separate GIS 
data sets or layers. Then, once the GIS normalized these factors, it displayed the 
results on a map. The map could show a variety of corridors, color coded by cost 
or risk. Once the GIS analyst builds the model gathered by the data, the planners 
could meet with the public and government officials to present their proposals. If 
things needed to be changed or some new factor came to light, the model could be 
run again quickly and the new plans created. With GIS, tweaking the model was 
simple. Of course, in the early days of GIS, the tools were less rigorous and harder 
to use, and computing power was substantially weaker.

The maps produced by GIS contained new information, never before seen. The 
maps produced by AM/FM systems documented what people already knew.
Networks Are Added to GIS
Where GIS was weak was in the modeling of linear networks, like electric lines. 
However, during the development of GIS, planners discovered that they could ap­
ply the same concept of discovery to linear networks. The idea of adding linear 
network data into a relational database along with the other spatial data helped 
solve routing problems—not just the routing of transmission lines, but of vehicles 
and people. Like spatial analysis with GIS, the result of the linear spatial analysis 
was a map showing new information. Once GIS modeled transportation networks, 
by the mid 1990s, most GISs were able to model linear networks. Utility networks, 
like water, gas, electric, and telecommunication systems, now could be modeled and 
more importantly analyzed using a GIS. 
Once utilities were able to model networks in the GIS, they began to abandon 
the old AM/FM systems. However, while many utilities have migrated from their 
legacy AM/FM system to GIS, the problems of missing and inconsistent data due 
to the lack of a standard coordinate system that the GIS inherited from the AM/FM 
limits its use for those utilities. For some, even though they migrated from their old 
AM/FM systems to GIS, they continued to use the GIS in the same way.
What’s the Difference Between CAD and GIS?
During this same time period, computer-aided design (CAD) systems developed and 
matured. Since CAD can produce any kind of drawing, some utilities had opted 
to use CAD to capture their mapping information, rather than to adopt an AM/
FM system or GIS. Utilities installed CAD systems in their design and drafting de­
partments, migrating from hand-drawn detail design drawings to CAD. It is still 
common and appropriate that most engineering departments today use CAD 
tools to design new substation, vaults, transmission towers, structural members, 
and power plants. The result of the design process is a set of detailed construction 
drawings. 
The design departments had the same problems as the mapping departments. It 
was hard and time consuming to make changes to hand-drawn plans. Early CAD 
systems were to drafting what word processing was to typing. Hand-drawn design 
drawings were very difficult to create and more difficult to edit. If a drafters needed 
to move a detail or even a piece of text on a manual drawing, they would have to 
erase large portions of the drawing only to have to redraw the same thing in differ­
ent place on the drawing. 
With CAD, like the word processer, the drafting process was enormously sim­
plified and automated. Drawings were much faster to create from scratch and sim­
ple to edit. They were also easier to read. They could be stored digitally, eliminating 
the costly drawing vaults. CAD systems developed further to automate the design 
process itself. CAD systems so simplified the drafting process. Since CAD worked 
so well designing structural steel details for substations, why not use the same sys­
tems for the mapping departments? Many did. So those utilities simply digitized 
their old circuit maps using CAD tools. 

12 
�����������������������������������
GIS and the Business of the Utility
What utilities discovered was that while CAD automated the drafting process, 
it was not able to perform the tasks of data management, spatial analysis, and 
spatial awareness that utilities needed. CAD treated the maps as a series of discrete 
drawings, not as a single information system. Typically each map was stored as a 
separate file, as if the distribution system consisted of a series of separated pieces 
within a map grid. The boundaries of an old map grid do not limit the GIS. It 
doesn’t store each map sheet (as they had been originally drawn manually) as a 
separate file. Instead the GIS provides new information—it does not just replicate 
old map sheets in an automated way. 
CAD, of course, is an important tool in an electric company. It is critical for 
creating complex designs of generating stations, for detailing projects, for provid­
ing structural details, and for developing construction plans. The purpose of a de­
sign drawing is straightforward: utilities use it once to document what a contractor 
has to build. For example, once the contractor embeds the rebar into a concrete 
foundation, there is very little need for the rebar detail design drawings. 
CAD is not a GIS. Once built, the utility needs the GIS to continuously manage 
the utility.
As noted before, GIS is a spatial data management system, built on top of a 
database management system. CAD is project based, typically file based, as each 
project or design drawing is created in a separate file. Can a utility use CAD for its 
GIS needs? Yes, with some work, compromises, and probably a significant amount 
of customization. Can a utility use GIS to create detail substation designs? Yes, 
with some work and a lot of compromises as well. A spreadsheet can certainly be 
used for word processing, but it would be much easier to use a word processer. Can 
a word processing program be used for balancing rows and columns of numbers? 
Yes, but not nearly as effectively as a spreadsheet. CAD has its place and GIS has 
its place.
GIS Architectures
Computerized mapping started as mainframe or mini-computer systems. They 
evolved into standard client server systems. Users worked on desktop PCs in a 
thick client environment. Data was stored in a proprietary or commercial relation­
ship database system on a database server. Integration with other corporate systems 
like supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), customer systems, 
and work management systems were largely custom built one-off interfaces. More 
often, data from one system was extracted from corporate systems then loaded into 
the GIS. Early uses of GIS in the field mainly consisted of extracted information 
from the GIS loaded into thick desktop-like mobile clients. See the typical “classic” 
configuration in Figure 1.5. 
GIS Is Changing Rapidly
Today, this architecture of GIS at electric companies is largely unchanged. Integra­
tion has improved and utilities are using thinner client mobile technology. This 
will change dramatically soon, as utilities fully leverage the cloud and as smart de­

GIS Architectures

vices become the dominant mobile devices of employees. Also utilities are adopting 
service-oriented architecture and web services more commonly.
Figure 1.6 shows a more modern approach to GIS, one in which some of the 
spatial data is not contained with a single GIS, but found using web services. That 
web services might be from the open Internet or a subscribed service or some com­
bination. Cadastral information, imagery, and parcel information may come from 
completely different sources and be consumed within the electric company GIS. 
The real estate department, for example, could maintain its own records of land 
ownership and easement records but publish that data through the company’s in­
tranet, and it would or could be consumed by a spatial analytic model in the system 
planning department’s view of the GIS.

GIS and the Business of the Utility
What Matters Most to the Electric Utility
GIS is growing up and growing in its importance in the electric company. Today 
most utility people recognize that GIS is essential for any reasonable smart grid 
deployment. 
The purpose of the GIS is to improve the work of the utility not to automate 
the mapping process, like in the old AM/FM days. It should positively impact what 
matters most to the company. So what really matters most to an electric company? 
The preface described what one savvy power company CEO thought: 
••
Make money for the shareholders;
••
Keep customers happy;
••
Keep employees safe;
••
Obey all laws and regulations;
••
Keep the lights on;
••
Respect the environment;
••
Keep us out of trouble and out of the newspapers. 
The Balanced Scorecard
Examining this list, there emerge four stakeholders that the utility must serve:
1.	 Shareholder—the owners of the company, either the actual stockholders 
in the case of an investor-owned utility or the government (city, regional, 
state, federal, tribal) or members of an electric cooperative;
2.	 Customer—the end use customer of the electric service;
3.	 Employee—actual employees, contractors, and vendors;
4.	 Community—the broad group of people who make up the service territory, 
including the representatives of the community such as the regulators (pub­
lic utility commissions, ministries of electricity, environmental agencies), 
government officials, special interest groups, and perhaps even the media.
Satisfy those stakeholders and the company accomplishes its mission. There 
are just a handful of strategic ways to satisfy these four stakeholders. To fully 
understand if the GIS is having a positive impact on the company, it is helpful to 
articulate the mission in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics for 
each of the stakeholders and then to measure the impact of the GIS on each of 
them. For example, one shareholder KPI for an investor-owned utility is earnings 
per share. This is essentially the profit of the company divided by the number of 
shares of common stock. Profit depends on revenue and expenses. So the GIS must 
show that it contributes to the improvements in productivity of the workers, reduc­
tions in travel time, savings in energy, effectiveness in planning for capital projects, 
and really anything the utility does that involves spending. The GIS could help to 
improve revenues by ferreting out places where theft of current occurs or helping 
collectors do their job to increase delinquent payments.

What Matters Most to the Electric Utility 
15
An example of a KPI for the customer stakeholder is “keep the lights on” or, 
to be a bit more precise, maintain reliability. Electric companies most often mea­
sure reliability using standard measures. One popular measure is system average 
interruption duration index (SAIDI), which is a measure of the number of minutes 
on average a customer experiences an outage annually. This is also referred to as 
customer minutes out. The GIS should have a positive impact on a utility’s SAIDI. 
Other important customer KPIs are the customer connect time—the time from 
when a customer requests a new electric service to when the utility connects the 
service and energizes the customer.
Electricity is dangerous. Utility must keep their employees safe. Employee safe­
ty is almost always one of the key performance indicators for a utility. Utilities 
measure safety performance as lost time accidents and responsible motor vehicle 
accidents. Other important measures are switching errors or near misses. Good 
facility data, accurate location, and easy accessibility to spatial data, served from 
the GIS, are critical safety nets that contribute to employee safety. 
Nearly all electric utilities worldwide are regulated. Regulators are the repre­
sentatives of the communities that the electric company serves. One important KPI 
of the electric company is the number of fines that the regulators impose. These 
fines could be for poor emergency response or late communication over excessive 
emission release or for a utility truck driving over a protected wetland. These viola­
tions are expensive, but more importantly they erode the position of the company 
in the community. In Russ’s words (from the Preface), these are the things that get 
us into trouble. The GIS is a critical tool for helping utilities better plan for emer­
gencies and mitigate risk.
Often, it is a difficult task to keep all these stakeholders happy. One way to do 
this that utilities have found useful is through the use of a balanced scorecard. The 
scorecard is a series of high-level KPIs organized by the four stakeholders. Figure 
1.7 lists an example of a typical balanced scorecard for a transmission and distribu­
tion utility.
GIS Helps Visualize What to Balance
The list of KPIs in the balanced scorecard is often an articulation of the company’s 
mission as well. Most electric companies strive to return earnings to their owners,

satisfy their customers with good service and reliability, provide a safe working 
environment, and be a good neighbor. When the executives gather to plan for the 
upcoming budget year, they will often set goals around these critical KPIs, like low­
ering operating and maintenance costs, increasing earnings, lowering SAIDI by a 
number of minutes, setting aggressive safety targets, and reductions in community 
issues. The gap between current performance and future targets represent the plan 
of action of the year as well as funding to achieve these targets. Most often, they 
close these gaps by improving upon processes, which almost universally involve the 
application of information technology. 
Since nearly all of the KPIs of an electric company involve some element of 
location, the GIS should play a pivotal role in the gap reduction to achieve the 
desired performance levels. However, given the GIS’s more traditional role as a 
mapping system or an engineering system, it has not had as dramatic an impact 
on the critical KPIs as it could have. One of the goals of this book is to help point 
out areas where the GIS can in fact be deployed to help close those gaps in the key 
performance areas.
What an Electric Company Does
As noted previously, what matters most to electric companies is articulated in their 
mission statement and is measured in their key performance indicators. There are 
thousands of workflows that contribute to a single KPI, from repairing a broken 
insulator to exercising a valve in a power plant to rendering a pay check to an em­
ployee. Most are rooted in location.
Workflows are organized around these themes:
••
Managing performance—these workflows center around keeping the system 
running smoothly and efficiently;
••
Managing the infrastructure—these workflows focus on the ongoing devel­
opment of the electric infrastructure and its ability to continue to meet the 
performance of the company;
••
Managing support services—these workflows support the ongoing work­
flows of managing performance and managing infrastructure;
••
Managing information—these workflows contribute to the knowledge the 
company needs to make decisions about performance and managing the 
infrastructure. 
Figure 1.8 illustrates the four strategic processes of the utility.
Managing Performance 
Performance separates good utilities from not so good ones. Power plants must 
continue to operate, the lights need to stay on, customers need to be able to get 
service, and bills have to be accurate and rendered on time. In other to sustain the 
business, utilities must make profit or, for government-run utilities, not lose money. 
Regulators, investors, and boards of directors generally measure utilities on how 

What an Electric Company Does 
17
well they perform, not so much on how hard they work. Performance workflows 
influence all four of the stakeholders. 
Common workflows that strongly influence performance are inspections, pre­
ventative repairs, tuning, dispatching, customer care services such as billing and ac­
count assistance, answering customers inquiries, monitoring the system, and emer­
gency management. Assuring cyber and physical security, collecting money from 
delinquent accounts, keeping inventory levels low, and calculating and mitigating 
risk are all examples of performance workflows. All have a strong locational com­
ponent, and all are driven by the need for good spatial information and the ability 
to analyze that information. 
Metrics that contribute to shareholder value include things like heat rate of a 
power plant, number of breaches of physical and cyber security, bad debt, electri­
cal losses, theft of current, and estimated meter reads. Metrics that impact the cus­
tomer are the reliability statistics like SAIDI, billing complaints, voltage dip, and 
low-voltage complaints. Metrics that impact the employee are accident frequency, 
near misses, employee morale, and employee turnover. Finally, metrics that impact 
the overall community include number of hazardous material accidents, fines for 
environmental violations, customer satisfaction, complaints, and negative (or posi­
tive) social networking mentions. 
Utilities categorized spending for these activities as operations and maintenance 
(O&M) expenses. O&M expenses directly impact the bottom line and earnings. 
Effective (or ineffective) management of performance directly impacts customer 
service, safety, community relations, and of course the ability to make money. The 
key for GIS managers is to clearly articulate the improvement in performance met­
rics directly attributable to the GIS.
One simple example, which will be covered in more detail in Chapter 8, is in 
the deployment of field work crews. A large number of employees work in the field. 
So, part of their work day is consumed by traveling from one work site to another. 
Many utilities do not take advantage of the capabilities of the GIS to optimally

dispatch crews. This goes well beyond finding the shortest direction from one point 
to another. This means taking the entire field group and determining the best use of 
all of the workers in the work group to minimize travel time. Reduction in travel 
time to perform the same series of tasks lowers labor expenses, saves fuel (and car­
bon emissions), and improves safety, since the crews are driving less.
Manage the Infrastructure
In order to keep the performance at a high level, utilities must continue to de­
velop their infrastructure to meet changing future demands. Ineffective projections 
of their customer demands and subsequent failure to upgrade their infrastructure 
could leave the system vulnerable to overloads, outages, and brownouts. Common 
workflows are system planning, load forecasting, work order taking, asset manage­
ment, engineering and design, site selection, construction, as-built documentation, 
provisioning for new service, obtaining easements for new facilities, and a host of 
other activities that support new infrastructure development. Again, these work­
flows depend heavily on location and of course good data about the current state 
of the infrastructure.
Measures that impact the shareholder are on time project performance, asset 
utilization, change orders as a percentage of project cost, construction variance 
from design, backlog of work orders, and closeout of construction documentation 
to the plant accounting records. Metrics that impact the customer are meeting 
customer in-service requirements, meeting interconnection schedules, and insuf­
ficient energy to meet the demand. Metrics dealing with employees for managing 
infrastructure are similar to those for managing performance and include project 
safety, union grievances, morale, and turnover. Metrics dealing with the commu­
nity are similar for both managing performance and managing the infrastructure 
and include complaints of noise, disruption of wildlife, complaints, and fines for 
contamination during construction.
Utilities amortize the spending for these workflows. This is capitalized (i.e., 
amortized over the life of the new assets being added to the system). The value of 
the assets includes all costs of the development of the new assets from planning 
costs, engineering, data development, and acquisition to labor, materials, and all 
administration of these activities. These costs indirectly hit the bottom line, since 
only the carrying costs directly impact earnings but they impact the total debt of 
the company. The value of assets is regularly a factor in determining the cost of 
service for a regulated utility, which in turn determines the rates the utility can 
charge, subject to regulatory approval. Transparency of these costs is critical for a 
successful rate case. (A rate case is a regulatory filing to the public utility commis­
sion, ministry of energy, or some other regulatory agency often held every three or 
four years to determine the rates a utility can charge.) 
Graphic design of new distribution facilities and as-built distribution network 
documentation are a few of the earliest applications of GIS in electric companies 
that deal with managing the infrastructure. These applications help the utility ac­
curately document what assets they added during a specific time period. Prior to 
GIS, utilities kept rooms full of asset information. During the rate case preparation, 
they needed to hire hordes of people to assemble the documentation of the costs

and time frames of what was added where. The utilities financial viability depends 
on knowing exactly what and where their assets are. 
Managing Supporting Resources
Support services include all of the workflows that support either ongoing perfor­
mance or managing the infrastructure. It’s in these areas that GIS has not played a 
significant role. However, much of the work of these support services, sometimes 
called shared services, has a strong spatial context. 
Shared services workflows and application of GIS will be detailed in Chapter 
8. Examples of these workflows are fleet management; supply chain (purchasing, 
warehousing, materials management, and delivery); and providing services such 
as legal, human resources, financial management, accounting, auditing, labor re­
lations, public relations, real estate management, and investor management. Yet, 
some of these areas represent where the company’s biggest problems may lie. For 
example, utilities write off bad debt each year. Once the debt is written off, it can 
longer be collected. They, in effect, sell off the receivables to collection agencies for 
pennies on the dollar. Utilities could use GIS to help them focus their collection ac­
tivities in those areas where collection activity is most likely, such as in high-income 
areas. Instead, they can get overwhelmed with the sheer volume of customers who 
do not pay their bills. 
Managing Information
Today data can inundate utilities. Workflows include the maintenance and opera­
tion of the IT infrastructure, managing services such as backup and security, appli­
cation development and deployment, data acquisition, planning, support, training, 
and network operations and often includes the management of the telecommunica­
tions networks, which are becoming more and more complex. 
Metrics relate back to how well IT is supporting the overall mission. GIS of 
course is one of the critical components of IT, but it is also or can be an impor­
tant tool to help manage the assets of IT and help with the emerging concerns of 
physical and cyber security of IT assets. In order to leverage that spatial component 
of the data, it’s critical that utilities incorporate their GIS with their other major 
corporate systems, like their financial, material management, network analysis, 
asset and work management systems, and their smart grid support systems such 
as SCADA, distribution management systems (DMS), and meter data management 
systems (MDM). 
The Utility Value Chain and Its Spatial Nature
Utilities are not organized along the lines of the managing performance, managing 
infrastructure, managing support services, and managing information. Rather they 
are organized along functional, business, or process lines. Electric utilities tend to 
organize themselves are around the energy delivery value chain. For much of the 
twentieth century, utilities were vertically integrated, meaning they managed all 

20 
�����������������������������������
GIS and the Business of the Utility
aspects of electric production, delivery, and the sale to the end user. They built and 
ran power plants, built and operated high-voltage lines, built and managed distribu­
tion systems and substations, read the meters, sent out the bills, and collected the 
cash. They often had their own testing labs and, in some cases, even manufactured 
their own equipment. Today, that is less common.
Location Critical for Energy Supply
The energy supply value chain consists of these master processes. Note that within 
each of the master processes, the operators manage performance, infrastructure, 
support, and information.
••
Exploration—this is the process in which the actual source of the energy is 
uncovered. This process is mostly performed by the fuel providers, but today 
utilities (or subsidiaries of the utility) are often involved in the discovery and 
validation of a fuel source or a commercially viable fuel source for electricity 
production. Today those sources are wind, solar, biofuels, and geothermal.
••
Development—once the fuel source is determined and validated, a produc­
tion facility is developed.
••
Gathering—in the cases of, say, a wind or solar farm that consists of many 
smaller production units, there exists a gathering system to collect the power.
••
Production—gathered energy is packaged for delivery or a power plant pro­
duces the energy.
The energy supply organization handles these processes. How GIS enhances 
the energy supply organization will be detailed in Chapter 2. In addition to the ac­
tual production, energy supply organizations also buy and sell power, issue power 
contracts, look at their financial risks, and hedge their purchases. Even though 
many utilities have divested of their generating assets, most electric companies still 
have to manage their energy supply portfolio. Location plays a strong role in the 
energy supply business, from discovery of new resources to site suitability studies 
to load forecasting based on weather and historic trends. Once they build plants or 
wind farms, GIS can play a strong role in managing these complex facilities.
GIS Plays a Strong Role in Transmission
The next process in the value chain is wholesale delivery or transmission. GIS plays 
a strong role in modeling the actual transmission facilities, transmission routing, 
vegetation management along the right of way, dealing with difficult land owner­
ship, encroachment concerns about electromagnetic fields (EMF), aesthetics, and 
lightning protection. There is a high degree of control and coordination that exists 
between production (energy supply) and transmission. GIS has been used to some 
extent in transmission, although rarely has it been leveraged beyond the ability 
to produce transmission strip plans or facility management plans. Transmission 
substations are rarely included in the GIS, but provide a critical component of the 
transmission system. Without including the transmission substations in the GIS, 
the ability to truly model the behavior of the transmission system is compromised. 
Chapter 3 deals with how GIS enhances the performance of electric transmission.

GIS Is Not Just About Mapping 
21
GIS Enhances Distribution
Utilities first used GIS to model their distribution assets as noted earlier as an out­
growth of their mapping systems. Distribution of electricity is the local transport 
throughout the streets, back alleys, and rural highways across the world. Chapters 
4 and 5 will cover how utilities use GIS in distribution in detail. Street lighting is 
often included as part of the distribution system, but in many cases street lights are 
owned and operated by the local municipality, which can create challenges for the 
electric distribution provider. Utilities rarely model high voltage to medium voltage 
(HV/MV) substations (i.e., those that tap off the transmission system in their GIS). 
They should be.
Customer Care Needs GIS
The next link in the value chain is the retail sale to the end use customer. This will 
be covered in Chapter 7. These will be the customer care processes. Every customer 
is located at a different place. GIS can play a vital role in managing the new smart 
meter rollouts, by supporting customer analytics and helping utilities understand 
their customers.
GIS Is Engaged in the Complete Utility Value Chain
Figure 1.9 shows the typical electric utility value chain. The energy supply organi­
zation manufactures the power, the transmission organizations delivers it in bulk, 
the distribution organization taps the power from the transmission system for lo­
cal delivery, and the customer care organization sells them the power and collects 
the money. Chapter 6 details emergency management and is covered separately 
because it often involves the integration of a number of different groups within the 
company. In addition, there are several other support organizations, such as supply 
chain, finance and accounting, and corporate services all included as part of shared 
services in Chapter 8.
GIS Is Not Just About Mapping
Electric utilities have used GIS for quite some time, yet the vast majority of its use 
has been for modeling the electric distribution system and mostly limited to the 
medium-voltage feeders and some of the lower-voltage equipment. While this has 
proved to be successful for providing better and clearer maps, its common applica­
tion still falls far short of its full potential to positively impact the big problems of 
the utility—the things that really matter. Given the challenges utilities face, they 
need to leverage every tool they can muster. 
What About the Data?
Most electric companies have a data problem. They have too much data, and the 
data is in different forms. They have authoritative data stored in the customer re­
lationship management system (CRM), financial, and enterprise asset management 

22 
�����������������������������������
GIS and the Business of the Utility
(EAM) systems. They have predictive information, like flood data or lightning 
strike data available but not in an easy to use form. For those that installed smart 
grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), they will have an order of mag­
nitude increase in consumption and power quality data. They also are getting data 
from social networking sites. Finally, they continue to capture normal real-time 
data from their control and monitoring systems such as SCADA and DMS. They 
also have data locked up in their workers’ minds with no easy way to capture the 
information. The business impact is that they may be making decisions based on an 
incomplete understanding of the situation at hand. 
Since utilities have so much data, it’s hard for them to consistently perform an 
analysis. The business impact is that they make decisions based on worker experi­
ence. As knowledge workers retire, that insight will be lost. Given the volume of 
data and the lack of analytics to deal with the data, it becomes difficult to commu­
nicate and collaborate with the work force.
GIS Helps Solve the Big Problems
The GIS capabilities of data management, spatial analysis, and awareness help 
lessen the problems facing utilities if they would take advantage of those capabili­
ties. Since the vast majority of that disparate data is spatial, the GIS can sift and 
sort through it, reconcile the various projections and accuracy levels, and provide 
a common view of the data sources. Then, once the data is organized and coordi­
nated, GIS can provide a whole host of spatial analytics to lend some clarity around

what exactly is going on. Figure 1.10 shows a common way that GIS takes many 
data layers and analyzes them to create a hot spot map. This map distills all the fac­
tors into a single display. The hot spot clearly stands out as a place that may be the 
most vulnerable to a storm or the place where customers are unhappy.
Finally, GIS is designed to display the results of the data fusion or analysis on 
a digital map. Data fusion simply means that data from different sources are com­
bined together on a common format (like in a map) for the purposes of seeing the 
relationship of many factors to each other. That map can be on a desktop, the web, 
or a tablet or smart phone. The idea is that once insight is generated (e.g., from a 
spatial analysis model or from a red line on a smart phone), information is dissemi­
nated throughout the organization. A convenient delivery mechanism is the cloud. 
Once information is stored, any authorized user can access it.
Need to Complete the Data
So utilities have grown from using hand-drawn maps (although there are still a 
surprising number of hand-drawn maps still in use at utilities around the world). 
They converted their hand-drawn maps to a digital format, but primarily for ease of 
drafting, not as a strategic information resource. Utilities are beginning to recognize 
the strategic importance of the GIS. Now that they have the right tool in place, the 
challenge will be to fix the data. Many utilities still have not modeled their struc­
tural data in the GIS (the conduits, manholes, and vaults). Many have not migrated 
their land information to a GPS-compatible base map. This also means that their 
facilities in their mapping system are not in the correct position from a GPS perspec­
tive. Often, phase designations are missing.
Many utilities take too long to get the data from field into their GIS. In their 
haste to take advantages of improved productivity from their mapping depart­
ments, they trimmed their staffs before they tackled the backlog of information

that had not made it into their GIS. Using mobile GIS in the field can significantly 
shorten the cycle time from when something has been installed to when the data 
about that change in the field gets posted into the GIS. Finally, many utilities have 
kept their GIS in the back room of the mapping department and have not embraced 
the notion of the GIS as one of just a few critical information systems.
GIS architectures are now fully embracing the new technologies of the cloud 
and the mobile devices. Thus, utilities are opening up the GIS to the electric utility 
enterprise, not just the few in the drafting department.

Location Matters for Energy Supply
When people think about an electric company, they often think about the actual 
product they are consuming, namely, electricity, and not so much about how it gets 
to them. Here, we will deal electrical energy supply and how location plays a criti­
cal role in the development and management of the sources that produce electric­
ity. Since location matters, GIS plays an important role in the management of the 
production and development of electricity sources. Unlike much of its history, the 
utility business today is actively looking for new ways to produce electricity. Two 
factors, climate change, due to the carbon dioxide emissions, and security and avail­
ability of fuel sources drive the need to diversify supply. 
Given that all forms of fossil fuel, from petroleum to coal to natural gas are 
nonrenewable (nuclear is nonrenewable as well), communities and regulators are 
demanding that utilities produce or procure electricity made from renewable re­
sources. While location matters in the management and development of conven­
tional sources of electricity production, location is perhaps even more prominent 
when dealing with renewable resources, given their variability and the strong rela­
tionship of these sources to the environment.
What Is in This Chapter?
This chapter discusses the changing nature of the generation business from one 
dominated by vertically integrated utilities to competitive entities and how this has 
changed the business. Further, this leads into why the use of geospatial technology 
can help them cope with the new challenges that come from a shift in the business 
model. 
The next several sections deal with how GIS can positively impact performance 
of the energy supply ecosystem: central plants to renewable energy sources. The 
chapter continues with how GIS deals with the actual development of the energy 
sources. A discussion on how GIS impacts the energy supply organizations follows. 
Finally, the chapter introduces the notion of an information model.

Location Matters for Energy Supply
A New Era for Electrical Energy Supply
The business model of the utility itself has changed dramatically over the last decade 
or so. There has been three major epochs in how electric companies operate. The 
first era is the free-for-all period. During the formative years, electric companies 
sprang up all over the world. In fact, there were battles over the technical nature of 
the business. The most well-known battle was between the advocates of direct cur­
rent (dc), spearheaded by Thomas Edison, and those who believed in the benefits 
of alternating current (ac), led by George Westinghouse and his inventor scientist, 
Nicola Tesla. A number of players entered the market, installing poles and wires in 
a frenzy to capture the market. In the free-for-all era, the early electric systems were 
simple. The early electric companies operated generators or dynamos with wires 
connecting directly to the end users. The result of all of this development was that 
competing systems cluttered city streets. As electric service became more developed 
and people relied more and more on it, governments recognized that having dupli­
cate infrastructure was getting intrusive. 
Moving from the Free-for-All Era
The notion of granting a single supplier of electricity an exclusive franchise terri­
tory appealed to governments around the world. Two models emerged: private and 
public. Many municipalities opted to simply buy out the electric producers and 
own and operate the electric system within their borders. However, the notion of 
government-owned businesses runs contrary to the principles of capitalism. 
Other communities granted franchises to private electric companies. The prob­
lem, however, was that these private companies would have to be monopolies. 
Capitalistic societies do not like monopolies either. So communities drew upon 
past business models set up for grain elevators, ports, and some railroads called 
the utility model. To protect the public from arbitrary price gouging, communities 
established regulating bodies that would require the utility company to submit 
prices for approval of the community. Thus, a privately owned company struck 
a regulatory deal with the community (in the U.S., the community was the state, 
since at that time electric companies rarely did business across state lines) that 
granted monopoly status (thus assuring no competition) in exchange for a fair and 
reasonable rate of return on the utility company’s investment. The final arbiter of 
any price increase would be the community. So this did a few things:
••
It created privately held regulated monopolies.
••
It established community-based regulating bodies. In the U.S., for example, 
these bodies are often called public utility commissions. These bodies regu­
lated rates charged by these private companies.
••
These changes ushered in the era of the regulated privately held vertically 
integrated utility.
Throughout the world, vertically integrated electric utilities were either inves­
tor owned (privately held) utilities or publicly owned (municipal, federal, tribal, 
special district owned). Electric cooperatives are a variation on publicly owned 

A New Era for Electrical Energy Supply 
27
utilities. Instead of the government, which represents consumers, owning the util­
ity, customers own the utility. Communities tend to think of electric cooperatives 
as publicly owned utilities.
Competition for Energy Supply Emerges
The long-standing assumption of the vertically integrated regulated utility era was 
that duplication of facilities for the purpose of competition was not in the public 
good. However, over time, with the development of the transmission grid, regula­
tors began to question this. Why, they argued, would duplicate generators not be 
in the public good? Each generator could plug into the transmission grid, creating 
a market, just like a food or flower market. Those generators that were efficient 
would win; the inefficient plants would lose. A vibrant competitive market would 
spur innovation, and the beneficiaries would be the consumers. Regulators across 
the globe restructured the electric market to unbundle vertically integrated utilities 
into the component parts, generation, transmission, distribution, and retail. 
The Era of Competition
This ushered in the current era of electric utility liberalization, which is character­
ized by these changes:
••
Generation shall be competitive.
••
Markets for generation shall be set up.
••
Transmission shall continue to operate as a regulated monopoly, but op­
erators shall be required to allow all generation operators open access to 
the transmission grid, charging tariffs that are the same across all market 
participants.
••
Distribution companies shall operate in a regulated monopoly as in the past, 
but may be excluded from offering metering and billing services. 
••
Competitive retail companies may be set up to offer consumers electricity 
service (not transmission or distribution services) at whatever price they 
want. 
This era is still under development. In the U.S., not all states implemented in­
dustry unbundling (often incorrectly called deregulation). So where this regulatory 
process is in effect, the role of energy supply (power generation) is now different. 
In the old vertically integrated utility era, as long as utilities built power plants rea­
sonably, kept good records, and operated the plants well enough, utilities by virtue 
of the regulatory deal would earn a return on their investment. In some cases, they 
would earn a return whether they actually operated the plant or not. In the new 
world of unbundling, only those plant operators of plants that actually produced 
electricity would make money. This is a bit oversimplified, since the electricity mar­
ket is quite complex, but the notion is clear. Operators of power plants in this new 
era are subject to the rules of competition, just like oil refineries or steel mills.
To deal with the generation as a competitive market, governments established 
electricity markets. Figure 2.1 illustrates a simplified diagram of how electricity 

28 
����������������������������������

markets works. So generators will be looking for every conceivable advantage to 
keep costs low and mishaps few. (Note that PX stands for power exchange, and is 
the entity that manages the power market.) Operators can predict or even avoid 
many of the mishaps by a careful assessment of what is exactly going on around 
them and at the plant itself. Most of what happens at the plant has something to 
do with location.
Shifting of Risk
In effect, the new regulatory framework has shifted the investment risk from the 
consumers or rate payers to the owners of the plants. At the same time, if the mar­
ket were to function completely unregulated, the consumers now are at risk of price 
instability. Given these new risks, all aspects of the business needs to meticulously 
scrutinized. With a misstep anywhere along the way, the investors could face serious 
financial consequences. What if the plant shut down for long periods of time? What 
if they spew greater than allowed emissions? What if something compromised the 
cooling water systems resulting in environmental damage? What if there is a secu­
rity breach? What if the plant runs at less than optimal efficiency? What if a natural 
disaster shuts the plant down? What if the wind doesn’t blow or sun doesn’t shine 
according to predictions?
Under the old regulatory scheme, these things would be bad for sure. Under the 
new regulatory framework, these events could be disastrous. On the other hand, if 
an operator owns a plant that has stunning efficiency and high availability, it will 
generate a high profit for its owners. If operators had to raise prices significantly, 
say due to fuel shortages, natural disasters, climate emergencies, or the inability to 
meet demand, communities may push toward returning to the old regulated model, 
which would create new uncertainties in the marketplace. While profit will be a 
strong motive, operators will be reluctant to drive up prices as well. Given this new 
regulatory framework and the drive toward renewable energy sources, utilities (or 
power plant operators) need all the help they get to gain a competitive advantage. 
The use of GIS is one of the tools that can help, since GIS can help utilities 
articulate risk using spatial analysis.

The Energy Supply Market 
29
The Energy Supply Market
While most of the world’s electric production comes from fossil fuels, this mix will 
certainly change over the next several decades. 
The Market Will Only Get More Complicated
Aside from the shift in risk, another shift will involve location. Today, the vast 
majority of electric generation plants are large. The model consists of thousands of 
very large centralized power plants, each plant having a huge geographic footprint. 
Some are as large as small cities. These large plants then feed into a huge intercon­
nected transmission system. Tapped off the transmission system are the various load 
centers. This is the present model.
In the future, there will be more decentralization of generation sources. These 
sources will be mix of renewable energy sources to be sure but also of smaller con­
ventional generators, powered by fossil fuels. This will result in the emergence of 
smaller independent grids, able to sustain themselves during a power failure. Utility 
people use the term microgrid for a self-sustaining electric supply and distribution 
system that can continue to operate while disconnected from the large utility grid. 
The microgrid could be as large as a city or as small as a single building or a college 
campus.
Energy Supply Gets Even More Complicated
These factors mean that the energy supply market will be much more complicated 
in this new era. Instead of market operators having to keep track of thousands of 
very large plants, they will need to monitor perhaps millions of small plants. In this 
new world of microgrids and distributed generation, location of those point sources 
will be paramount. Figure 2.2 illustrates how GIS can display the sources of small 
distributed generators. While every power plant produces the exact same product, 
electricity, each type of plant has its own uniqueness, advantages, and problems. 
The Energy Supply Organization
Whether a utility actually owns and operates the actual production of electricity, 
they still are responsible for procuring the power to deliver. Figure 2.3 shows the 
various processes involved in a typical energy supply organization of a utility. In 
addition to the actual production, energy supply organizations buy and sell power, 
issue power contracts, look at their financial risks, and hedge their purchases. Even 
though many utilities have divested their generating assets, most electric companies 
still have to manage their energy supply portfolio. 
Energy Contracts and Risk Management
Utilities will need to understand their sources of supply and the potential risk of los­
ing that supply. Loss of supply is primarily due to outside factors, such as weather 
events, natural disasters, vandalism, or terrorist attacks. So if a utility has entered 
into a long-term supply contract with an independent power producer, they will 

30 
����������������������������������
Location Matters for Energy Supply
need to understand the chances on a given day or hour what the risk of losing that 
energy is and make adjustments for those risks. In fact, in the determination of the 
contract itself, the utility must assess the risk profile of that plant to better under­
stand how much to pay for the power contract. They will need to build the risk 
profile into the terms and conditions of the power contract. 
There are a number of risk factors to be looked at that are not spatial, like age, 
historical availability, management controls, safety records, compliance records, 
and emission history. However, risks are also associated with its location. When 
making long-term power contracts, utilities can better determine the relative risk of 
an existing or potential power source by combining the nonspatial risks with those 
that have a spatial component to determine the relative risk of one plant verses 
another. Spatial risk factors include things like proximity to earthquake faults, tsu­
namis, rising tides, and landslides, and the proximity to a whole host of possible 
disasters. There are factors like crime, proximity to known terrorist cells, social up­
risings, floods, or any other factor that could impact the availability of the power.

Managing Power Generation Performance 
31
Figure 2.4 shows how GIS can take nonspatial and spatial data together to 
develop a map called a hot spot map that illustrates where power plants are most 
vulnerable or have the highest risk of something bad happening to them.
Like other parts of the utility value chain, those that own and operate genera­
tion plants have to manage the performance of the plants, more so under the new 
rules for competitive generation than ever.
Managing Power Generation Performance
Each type of power plant has its own unique characteristics that impact on its per­
formance and cost effectiveness. At the end of the day, a power plant’s performance 
depends on its fixed costs, like the amortized cost to build the plant in the first 
place; its operating costs, like labor and materials to run the plant, which may be 
more or less fixed; and its incremental or variable costs, which typically are the fuel 
costs. Other important considerations are its up time or availability—the volume 
of power produced annually, how fast a plant can start up when called upon, and 
the environmental impact. As the world moves closer to a carbon cap and trading 
system or a carbon tax situation, the cost of emissions will dominate the business 
model for a particular power plant. The better the plant operator manages its data, 
analytics, and data dissemination, the better the operator can make critical invest­
ments and operating decisions. GIS can be a part of that.
What follows is how GIS can improve the various operations of different types 
of generation.

Hydroelectric Generation
Hydroelectric generation systems are examples of power plants that are very ex­
pensive to build, have modest operating costs, and no fuel costs. A pumped storage 
hydro plant is a variation on the hydroelectric plant. That plant uses hydro power 
from an upstream water source to generate power during periods of high demands, 
then during periods of low demands, normally at night, reverses the process and 
pumps water back behind the dam. The consequences of a failure or misstep in the 
operation of a hydro plant or a pumped storage plant can be catastrophic. Should 
a dam break or overspill, massive flooding could occur, threatening whole commu­
nities while destroying wildlife and raising long-term havoc with the environment. 
Figure 2.5 illustrates how GIS is used to model the impact of a dam break. That is 
why hydro plant operators carefully model their plants in GIS to better understand 
the potential flood impacts. They use GIS to model upstream resources and down­
stream impacts.
While governments and communities consider hydroelectric plants renewable, 
the operators have to be concerned about methane emissions, which is a green­
house gas. Since hydroelectric plants dam water and in many instances flood areas 
of former vegetation, the vegetation will decompose under the flooded areas and 
emit methane gas. So a hydroelectric plant operator needs to monitor the emissions 
of methane and know exactly what type of vegetation formerly existed in the areas 
now holding the water. GIS models the flooded area and the former vegetation as 
well as illustrates the emission of methane gases.
Since the only fuel used to produce electricity is stored water, it is essential for 
the hydroelectric operator to model exactly the “fuel source” or the storage of the 
water, based on infiltration, rainfall, soil types, evaporation, and a host of other 
factors to make sure that the operator can predict the production of the plant. A 
hydroelectric plant operator who participates in the power exchange market must 
be able to bid into the market like every other participant. Figure 2.6 illustrates 
how GIS works in concert with a production-planning model to determine the

storage volume for water. The GIS determines the storage volume by merging a 
digital elevation model with imagery of the terrain along with polygon of the water 
extent, plus real-time readings of the water level.
Unlike, a fossil plant operator who knows how much coal is stored in a coal 
pile or natural gas is stored in a tank, it is more complicated to exactly determine 
production based on so many environmental considerations. Operators need to 
create a detailed model of all the land features in the GIS and adjust the model 
for shifting conditions. Hydroelectric plant operators have to have ready access to 
weather data, so they can accurately predict their “fuel.”
Hydroelectric plant operators, like operators of other kinds of power plants, 
must assess the environmental impact continuously. Since most plants have to un­
dergo relicensing on a periodic basis, they must be diligent in capturing the impact 
of the plant on the surrounding land and communities. The GIS provides the most 
complete picture of the plant and its impacts.
Nuclear Plant Performance
Unlike hydroelectric plants, nuclear performance is very predictable (provided 
nothing goes wrong). Operators can add new nuclear fuel only during a plant 
shutdown. Nuclear plant operators call this down time a refueling outage. Under 
ideal conditions, the plant runs continuously at full production until the fuel runs 
out. Since the variable cost of production for a nuclear plant is very low, the ideal 
situation for the power exchange and for the operators is to dispatch (select to 
run) every nuclear plant available. The most critical issue (aside from avoiding an 
accident) for a nuclear plant operator is to absolutely minimize the refueling outage 
time. It goes without saying that an unscheduled outage is devastating to operating 
Figure 2.6  GIS map showing volume levels as part of a production-planning model. (Source: Powel 
Corporation and Esri.)

revenues. Every hour the plant is not producing electricity, the operator loses vast 
sums of money. 
So from a performance perspective, the nuclear plant operator needs to keep 
track of every possible situation that could shut the plant down or force the op­
erator to curtail production. The use of GIS for performance then is more about 
risk management than direct production planning as in the case of the hydroelec­
tric plant. Risk management would include modeling the impact of any event that 
could interrupt operations and subsequent restart or delay the refueling outage. 
Operators need to model every conceivable risk that could occur during a refuel­
ing outage. Even a simple wind storm or heavy rain could impact the schedule of 
a refueling outage. Logistics are critical. Operators must carefully optimize every 
movement of every piece of material and personnel. GIS’s ability to model linear 
networks and optimize routing can be essential in the planning of the refueling out­
age. A one-day delay in the refueling outage of a typical nuclear plant could cost 
the operator millions of dollars.
GIS Helps Nuclear Organizations to Plan for Emergencies
Nuclear plant operators must keep ready access to the land features of the plant 
and surrounding communities should an abnormal event occur. The use of GIS for 
direct nuclear operations includes:
••
Modeling evacuation zone and routes;
••
Determination of severe weather on all equipment;
••
Earthquake and tsunami threats;
••
Wild fire threats;
••
Flooding;
••
Loss of electric transmission and backup power to plant;
••
Cooling water interruption;
••
Contamination of the water supply—modeling of ground water and proxim­
ity to rivers and streams.
The nuclear plant operator will be most concerned about modeling adverse 
impacts and crafting contingency plans should something bad happen. Figure 2.7 
shows a map of where nuclear plants are located. This helps communities under­
stand the impact of a nuclear evacuation should that be necessary. Operators can 
base their contingency plans are on GIS since location of events, evacuation routes, 
security breaches, and a whole host of other abnormal events involve location. 
Even during a routine refueling outage, operators may want to model the plant 
facilities in GIS to optimize the movement of people, materials, and machines.
GIS’s most effective tool for the determination of risk is called a spatial ana­
lytic model. This model will be illustrated later in this chapter for site selection. 
The model consists of three elements: spatial and nonspatial data sets as inputs; 
geoprocessing tools such as overlay, union, intersection, and buffer that operate on 
the inputs; and spatial representations of the results of the operations. Evacuation 
analysis involves modeling a number of scenarios, such as wind direction, road 

Managing Power Generation Performance 
35
capacity, weather, terrain, and a host of other variables depending on the reason 
for the evacuation. Evacuation planners must be able to model a nuclear accident 
under all kinds of disaster scenarios. The recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan 
illustrated how many different factors can complicate evacuation scenarios. 
Fossil Plant Performance
The design of the plant and its operation determines fossil plant performance. Just 
like nuclear plant operators, fossil plant operators must minimize plant down time. 
Unlike a nuclear plant, down times are not dependent on the fuel running out. 
Rather, operators schedule down times to perform major maintenance activities. 
Regardless of why they shut the plant down, operators will need to optimize the 
logistics in moving materials, staging activities, and any unscheduled activity to 
absolutely minimize the down time so that the plant can resume operations. Gas 
turbines have normal down times during off-peak times. Even then, significant cost 
penalties can accrue if the plants are unavailable when called upon, particularly 
during periods of peak clearing prices. Logistics around how well and fast main­
tenance is performed during a routine outage of the plant will impact the overall 
profitability of the plant. Also, as in the operation of hydroelectric and nuclear 
plants, planning for extreme weather events, earthquakes, loss of transmission, ter­
rorist attacks, and sabotage need to be planned for, and most of those plans require 
a solid understanding of location. 
Managing the Risk
Unlike nuclear and hydroelectric plants, the security of fuel supply is a critical is­
sue. Fuel sources usually depend on third parties, like natural gas pipeline operators 
Figure 2.7  GIS map showing nuclear plant locations. (Source: Esri et al.)

or railroads that haul the coal. Interruptions in the fuel supply will shut the plants 
down. So utilities need to be aware of the risks of those interruptions and model 
them in the GIS.
Emissions monitoring is essential for continued operations of the plant. If emis­
sion control devices fail and emissions violate regulations, regulators will fine plant 
operators and ask about the impact of the emission failure. Fossil plant operators 
need to continuously model current weather patterns and be able to model the 
emission violations in the GIS. Coal plant operators have to be particularly con­
cerned about possible ground water contamination of the coal piles. So monitoring 
the proximity of water resources near the coal storage facilities is essential. To do 
this, planners capture the water resources as a GIS data set and create a spatial 
analysis model that determines the proximity of water resources to possible leach­
ing areas from the coal sources. 
Some coal plant operators own and operate the coal mines that supply coal 
to the plant. Utilities have built power plants at the mouth of the coal mine it­
self. So they may need to model the logistics of the coal supply and optimize its 
transportation. 
Rail operations are critical to the fuel supply of coal plants. GIS is used exten­
sively to model railroad facilities and operations. Coal plant operations can work 
closely with railroad companies to access information from the railroad GIS and 
include the data sets as part of their spatial analysis and routing models for coal 
supply. There are a number of resources available that deal exclusively with GIS 
and railroad operations.
Performance of Wind Power
Like hydroelectric plants, nuclear plants, and many fossil plants, wind plants are 
expensive to build, and do require a fair amount of maintenance, but wind farms 
have no fuel costs and of course emit no greenhouse gases. Unlike nuclear, large 
base-loaded fossil plants and to large extent hydroelectric plants, the power gener­
ated from wind plants is variable. That means that production does not follow the 
demand. While the power production is variable, it is not entirely unpredictable. 
Wind power plant operators can use sophisticated wind forecasting models to help 
them in the daily load forecasts. The topology of the land, weather models, and 
historic wind patterns determine much of that analysis. 
These GIS prediction models use imagery and digital elevation data sets, along 
with accurate representation of the location of each of the wind turbines. Offshore 
wind farms must have a solid understanding of the topology of the ocean floor, 
wind patterns, and the constant shifting of the ocean floor that occurs. Figure 2.8 
shows the GIS map of the ocean floor.
Like every other type of power plant, operators need to maximize the invest­
ment in the wind plant. That means the operators must optimize the maintenance 
of the plants. The ideal situation would be to perform maintenance of each turbine 
during a time when there is low demand and when the GIS predicts the fuel source, 
the wind, to be the lowest. Since a wind power plant consists of many separate 
wind turbines, it is necessary for operators to have each turbine located exactly so 
they can perform the necessary modeling of wind prediction. Operators can use 

Managing Power Generation Performance 
37
GIS to perform optimal routing of field crews for inspection and maintenance to 
limit the downtime of each of the turbines.
With the purpose of maximizing availability, offshore wind farm operators 
must account for and model responses for unscheduled events due to extreme 
weather, sabotage, and errant ships with their anchors digging up cables entering 
the offshore wind farm areas. Here the GIS can model the perimeter of the offshore 
turbine locations and alert operators if a vessel enters the space of the wind power 
plant. Geofencing technology can be used to alert operators that a ship has entered 
within a range of a wind turbine platform. Geofencing uses sensors along with GIS 
that is like a virtual trip wire. Once a vessel enters into within a polygon around 
the wind turbine, the operators know about it immediately and can take action.
Wind Still Has Environmental Issues
Wind plants do not emit greenhouse gas, but they still pose an environmental im­
pact. GIS can model them in order to stay in compliance and assure smooth perfor­
mance. There are these factors:
••
Noise—noise level profiles can be overlaid on base maps of the region to 
determine the exact decibel levels near communities. This will be important 
for compliance and to avoid community disputes.

••
Birds—a common problem with wind farms is the interruption of bird 
migration patterns and the killing of birds. While bird migration patterns 
should have been dealt with during the siting process, many wind power 
plants continue to be plagued with bird issues.
••
Strobing—the rotation of the blades produces a sort of strobe light effect 
that can be very annoying for those that live near the turbine. Stobing can be 
modeled in GIS by examining the sun rising and setting and then creating an 
overlay where and when strobing is most severe.
••
General aesthetics—this issue is usually addressed during the siting phase. 
However, there still could be ongoing community concerns about the ob­
struction of views that a wind power plant operator must address. 
These issues are all location based and are part of a GIS model. Complaints 
about excessive noise, bird killings, and strobing in the worst of situations can shut 
down the operation of turbines and can have a devastating impact on the perfor­
mance of the plant. Having these issues accurately modeled helps operators work 
with the communities to mitigate the risks.
GIS Data Management Helps Wind Farms
When dealing with complex issues of siting a wind farm or any large facility, one of 
the most difficult processes is the gathering of up-to-date and complete data. In the 
case of a wind farm, developers must gather data from so many different sources. 
The challenge is to make sure that the sources are current. Most developers today 
still rely on the old process of gathering printouts of charts and maps, and then 
attempting to piece together all of the factors. Of course, this process takes time. 
While a critical piece of data or a map might have been current when the developer 
got a copy of the map, there is no way of knowing that the data on the map could 
have been updated. However, using a GIS spatial analysis model that accesses criti­
cal map data, like bird migration data using a web service, the developer will know 
that each time the analysis is run, the data used in the analysis will be the most cur­
rent digital map data available. 
Today agencies, governments, and think tanks publish their data over the web 
and store it in a private or public cloud. So access is searchable from the GIS and 
quickly accessible to the developers.
Solar Electric Power Generation
Like wind and hydroelectric power plants, solar plants are expensive to build, re­
quire some level of maintenance, and have no fuel costs. From a market perspec­
tive, these forms of generation have the lowest incremental costs. The vast majority 
of solar plants are small photovoltaic installations on rooftops and open fields. 
However operators are building and operating a number of large-scale central solar 
plants. Passive solar plants use mirrors to heat a fluid. The plant then pumps the 
fluid deep into the ground. The fluid is stored and used later. 
Aside from maintenance to keep the PV panels clean and the electronics run­
ning, there are few environmental factors inhibiting the use of solar generation. For 

Managing Power Generation Performance 
39
very large PV installations, it is important to keep track of the production of each 
of the panels, so that should a panel fail, the operator can easily locate and replace 
the failed panel. GIS models the exact location of each of the panels and can pro­
vide optimal routing for cleaning, replacement, and maintenance crews.
Given the distributed nature of some large-scale solar installations, utilities 
will need to know where they are located. There is an emerging business model 
for small-scale solar panels. Developers or even utilities provide solar systems to 
homeowners and small businesses without cost. They continue to own the solar 
panels, but provide a discount to the homeowner or small business for the right to 
install the solar panel on their property. As this process becomes increasingly com­
monplace, utilities will need to know information about these assets and exactly 
what these utility-owned panels are generating. The locations and attributes of 
these panels will be captured in the GIS. 
Geothermal Power Plants
Geothermal plants, like hydroelectric, wind, and solar, are expensive to build, re­
quire a fair amount of maintenance, and have no fuel costs. Geothermal plants rely 
on the heat well below the Earth’s surface for its energy source. This requires the 
pumping of a treated fluid deep into the ground and brought to the Earth’s surface 
to generate electricity. The cost of a geothermal plant to build is directly in relation 
to how close to the surface of the Earth the geothermal resources lie. Most large-
scale geothermal plants are located near areas of active volcanos and hot springs. 
Once built, the plant operates like any other power plant and is subject to the 
same threats to production as any other plant: extreme weather, earthquakes, sabo­
tage, and so on. Since the plant requires that a heat-conducting fluid be pumped 
deep into the Earth, operators must be concerned about any aquifer contamination 
should a pipe fail. So operators need GIS to model the sensitive underground water 
resources.
The recurring theme for most of the generation resources is that utilities need 
to understand the location of the plants along with risks and hazards near the 
plants. Utilities need to have spatial analysis models that calculate various risks 
should something happen, like in a geothermal plant if the conducting fluid pipe 
should rupture. The spatial analysis model determines how close the rupture is 
from a sensitive aquifer or other environmentally sensitive area and is able to de­
termine the impact of the damage. 
Distributed Generation
With the growing investment in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), utilities 
will shift their pricing from average monthly pricing to dynamic pricing. Utilities 
will strive to match the production cost (based on the clearing price for that time 
interval) to the price they charge consumers. The implications are that the cost of 
electricity at peak usage times to customers could rise substantially in this model. 
Today, utilities charge commercial and industrial customers for both an energy and 
power demand. They often base demand on the peak use of power during a par­
ticular billing cycle (normally one month). In the new model, the price of electricity 
could vary not just at the peak, but during periods of high production cost, (e.g., 

40 
����������������������������������
Location Matters for Energy Supply
during periods of draught or low wind production), which may or may not occur 
during a conventional peak time. The result will be that more and more consumers 
will install on site generation in an attempt to manage the dynamic pricing variance. 
Utilities will need a very precise model should distributed generation prolifer­
ate. They may need to monitor the production of this generation and certainly need 
to understand the location. They will also need to include the distributed genera­
tion resource models in their GIS. Many utilities have not focused very aggressively 
on capturing the data about their low voltage network (operating below 1000V). 
However with more and more distributed generation, utilities may find that the 
low-voltage networks may not be able to handle this additional stress. Widespread 
distributed generation (including wind and solar) plus an increasing number of 
electric charging stations could render the low-voltage network very vulnerable. 
There will be more on this in Chapter 4.
Energy Planning
With all these types of generating sources available, utilities and system operators 
will need to know in detail where all these sources are located and what the char­
acteristics of each type of source are. With a carbon tax or carbon cap and trade 
program in place, operators will need to understand the financial considerations as 
well as the load balancing considerations. This will become increasingly complex 
as the percentage of variable sources of renewable generation becomes higher. One 
of the components of this complex analysis will be the matching of fairly detailed 
load forecasting models to the generation mix. 
Today, the vast majority of generation sources are centralized, pumping power 
into the transmission grid. The vast majority of the world’s power requirements 
were met almost entirely from centralized generation plants. Each generator au­
tomatically adjusts for the increase or decrease in the demand. That model will 
shift to more and more decentralized generators, many variable, with automated 
demand response systems in place. To further complicate the situation, storage 
facilities will become more prominent, dispersed in communities, creating the pos­
sibility of smaller independent grids that sometimes are connected to the main grid 
and sometimes not. 
So it will become essential for utilities and system operators to know the loca­
tion of all the small generators and storage facilities. They will need to be modeled 
in the GIS. 
Managing the Infrastructure
The demand for electricity will continue to rise in the years to come, even though 
the industry has seen demands stagnate over the last several years due to the great 
recession. As the economy rebounds, the use of the electricity will increase. In addi­
tion, there will be shift away from petroleum to other sources of energy for trans­
portation. A simple calculation reveals that if everyone in the world were to convert 
from petroleum-fueled vehicles to electric vehicles (of some kind), the amount of 
raw electrical energy required would be about half of the entire worldwide elec­
tricity production. Clearly that’s not going to happen anytime soon. Yet suppliers 

Managing the Infrastructure 
41
of electricity need to be aware that as the transportation industry looks more to 
electricity for fuel, the demand for electricity could rise substantially. A significant 
increase in the price of petroleum over a long period of time will also accelerate 
the shift to electric forms of transportation. That shift would include freight rail 
perhaps as well, which for the most part is completely dependent on petroleum.
The problem for society will be producing enough electricity to supply the 
needs of the future. The drive toward renewable energy and the reduction in green­
house gases will move operators of generators to continue to build all forms of 
generation. They will replace those existing generators that will fail to meet carbon 
emission standards in the future.
What’s Involved in Building Electric Generation?
Two phases result in the building of a new electric energy source: 
••
Exploration—this is the process in which the optimal source of energy is 
discovered;
••
Development—once the source of energy for the production of electricity is 
determined and validated, the development of a facility (such as building a 
wind farm, for example) is undertaken. 
Exploration
Exploration involves finding the right place to develop a source of electrical energy. 
In the case of geothermal energy, for example, the exploration process involves a 
search for those areas where there exists significant seismic resources (i.e., areas 
where significant heat from the below the Earth’s surface is relatively close to the 
surface). Another example is the exploration of solar resources. Figure 2.9 shows 
a GIS map of solar density, which is really a map of various solar resources. Dur­
ing the exploration process, the GIS is used to determine where the resources are 
and the resources in relation to other factors that could determine if the resources 
are worthy of development. The GIS then uses spatial analysis to accumulate other 
factors, such as weather conditions, environmental situations, the topology, the 
proximity to electric transmission, the climate, land availability, and even social 
political situations. 
The exploration steps are to first determine or discover the resources using GIS 
and then analyze the suitability of developing those resources. Once developers 
discover that a resource is suitable, a detailed siting analysis follows. It’s critical 
that the information used to discover the resources and the suitability is maintained 
and accessible so that later, during a challenge, the data used in the analysis is read­
ily available during the development of the plant itself.
A simplified example of site selection spatial analysis would be the answer to 
the question, where is the best place to build a solar generator assuming we only 
have two criteria?
••
The highest solar density;
••
Nearest to an electric line.

42

In this simple example, the planners have a spreadsheet of solar readings spaced 
at different intervals within the study area. The spreadsheet includes solar intensity 
as a column and GPS location as another two columns. The first step in the spatial 
analysis is to convert the solar readings to a solar density map. The spatial analysis 
tool selects a cell size for the analysis, roughly selecting a square cell where the 
center of the cell is the location of the reading. Obviously the more readings and 
the nearer the readings are to one another, the better the density map. This is an 
example of a density analysis tool. The tool converts discrete points into cells or 
pixels that are uniform across their area. In effect, the analysis converts a series of 
points to a raster image of a series of pixels. 
The next step is to normalize the density map from the solar readings them­
selves into a ranking, such as 0 to 100. The reason for doing this is to be able to 
compare the solar density factor to other factors, like land suitability. The normal­
ization tool assigns each cell or pixel a ranking value based on the original point 
value. This produces a density map that shows different shades of color depending 
on the value in the cell. So areas of high solar density are in dark red, whereas areas 
of low density are in light blue, for example.
The next step is to assess the proximity to an electric line. The criterion is that 
the closer the proposed location of the solar system is to the line, the better. The 
base data for this analysis is a set of point measurements, with each point repre­
senting the distance to the closest electric line. The density analysis tool converts 
this data into a raster data set, in which each cell or pixel has a uniform value, 
based on the distance to the nearest electric line. In this case, where a low distance 
is desired, the raster data set would be reclassified to the same scale as the solar 
density map, with short distances having a high value, whereas long distances are 
assigned a low value. This produces a proximity area map that shows certain cells 
that are close to electric lines as darker and other cells that are farther away from 
electric lines as lighter.
The final analysis is to create a third map that combines the pixel values of 
the solar density map with the pixel values from the proximity map. The GIS tool 
that performs this is the overlay solver or tool. This tool will be used extensively

throughout this book. In a weighted analysis, the person performing the analysis 
might decide that solar density is more important than distance to an electric line. 
In this case, the weighted analysis gives greater weight to the more important factor 
before combining the values of each cell. The resultant data set consists of a series 
of cells, with each cell having the combined weighted value. The resultant GIS map 
shows areas that have the highest solar density that are the closest to an electric line 
in dark colors compared to other areas in lighter colors. The resultant map is often 
called a mashup. So this mashup fine-tunes the analysis and, in effect, narrows 
down the search for the best place to put a solar system.
Say, for example, the solar developers also had a map of certain parcels of land 
for sale or lease at different prices, the developer could create a raster map where 
each cell represents the lease value of the parcel. They would give pixels in parcels 
not for sale a 0 value. This map could be reclassified on a scale where the lowest 
lease cost for a parcel has pixel values that are the highest value, say, normalized 
on a scale from 0 to 100. In the same way, the three data sets (the solar density, the 
distance to electric lines, and the lease cost) can be combined to give yet another 
map where the dark areas are those with high solar densities, nearest an electric 
line, have parcels for sale, and at the lowest price. Again, the analyst can decide to 
weigh lease costs lower than solar density, since it might be more important that 
the land be available than the price. Figure 2.10 outlines the steps in the analysis.
The most important aspect of site selection is narrowing down all the factors 
that go into obtaining the right site. The more factors that are involved in the 
analysis, the better the selection. In a solar application, slope, soil stability, history 
of cloud cover, rainfall, and dust density are all factors that should be included into 
the analysis. Note that the site selection spatial analysis involves the following:
••
Converting all factors into simple raster images based on known or mea­
sured data;
••
Converting each pixel value of the raster data set into a common scale so that 
the values in each cell can be added together;
••
Weighing each data set if necessary;

••
Adding the pixels that occupy the same exact pixel location to form the 
output map.
The end result is a heat map, where the hot spot or darkest area represents the 
most optimal result. 
During the exploration phase, developers of power sources scour the landscape 
to determine the best place to develop a plant. That process involves land availabil­
ity, suitability, and economic evaluation. These factors are related to location and 
can be expressed separately as a GIS dataset. The analysis then involves performing 
a spatial analysis to uncover the best location that balances all the factors involved. 
The result is not a single answer, but a series of areas that represent the various 
grading of all the factors represented as a simple-to-understand map: the dark red 
areas, for example, represent the best locations; the light blue areas represent the 
worse locations, with other areas in between colors and densities
The factors will be quite different depending on the type of plant being consid­
ered. For example, a coal plant is highly dependent on a transportation system or 
needs to be near a coal mine of a certain type. A nuclear plant has to have the abil­
ity to store spent fuel, so proximity to sensitive habitat may be an issue. A natural 
gas–fired plant needs to be near a high-pressure gas pipeline. A wind farm needs 
to be in an area of high wind density. All plants need to be near existing electric 
infrastructure as much as possible. However, while the factors for each plant are 
quite different, the process of site selection using GIS is the same regardless of the 
type of plant.
Development
The next phase in the development of any plant involves the production of the plant 
itself. Once the general location of the plant is determined, the next steps involve 
the following:
••
Planning—here GIS is used for site development, plant logistics, drainage 
determination, and permitting.
••
Surveying—GIS is used to craft the legal rights and the exact determination 
of the land for the plant and surrounding support properties.
••
Environmental assessment and mitigation—GIS is the tool of choice to eval­
uate the impacts of the plant on the environment, including noise, pollution, 
possible contamination, and control.
••
Permitting—GIS is used to submit the documentation of the prior steps and 
as a visualization tool to communicate to the permitting authorities exactly 
the scope and impact of the project.
••
Engineering and design—CAD is typically used during this phase for the 
development of detailed construction plans, but GIS can also be used as a 
master management system to keep track of all issues and factors that arise 
during the design process, including back references to prior stages.
••
Construction—GIS is often used for major construction projects in conjunc­
tion with construction scheduling tools for logistics and organization of 
documentation.

Managing Support Services 
45
••
Commissioning—GIS can use be to organize the data in preparation for turn­
ing the plant over to the people who will operate the plant. This will be the 
phase that organizes the transition from a project to an operational facility. 
The location of all critical features of the plant will be captured in the GIS. 
••
As-built documentation—this is the process where the final documentation is 
completed for the plant. Changes due to field conditions and scope changes 
are incorporated into the final set of construction records. It is the lack of fol­
low through on this phase where information can get lost and create costly 
problems later during operations. The GIS can provide the bridge from the 
state of what was originally engineered to what was actually built. 
Figure 2.11 shows the typical lifecycle of plant development.
Managing Support Services
There are common process that must be considered when both running a plant and 
building one. These services involve supply chain, readiness for weather events, se­
curity, facilities management, ongoing environmental compliance monitoring, pub­
lic relations, and safety. Most of these processes are dependent on location.
The movement of construction material, fuel, people, or vehicles represents 
a significant cost to the developers as well as operators of a power plant. For ex­
ample, the routing of inspection personnel to hundreds of scattered wind turbines 
can be a significant logistics problem. GIS is widely used by delivery companies, 
warehouse managers, and fleet managers to optimize routes and select the best lo­
cation of warehouses or spare parts depots. Chapter 8 contains more information 
on routing and supply chain.
All plants, regardless of whether they are in operation or under construction, 
must be ready for adverse weather events. GIS coupled with weather services can 
accurately predict where weather events will occur. Plant operators can perform 
risk assessments of their facilities to see just how vulnerable parts of the plant are to 
certain events, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, or landslides. With the plant mod­
eled in GIS along with risk assessments, plant operators and developers can create 
risk scenarios and then create mitigation plans.

A GIS spatial risk model is quite similar to the siting model. Data for each risk 
factor, such as the areas of highest incidents of wild fires, are converted into a den­
sity map and then normalized over a consistent scale. Each risk factor represents a 
raster layer. For example, a wildfire prediction density map is one layer, a tornado 
incidence map is another layer, and flood zone is yet another layer. Then by per­
forming a weighted overlay process, a composite map that combines all the risk 
factors into a single density map is created. A heat map then shows the areas with 
the highest risk. Again the process is similar to the siting example, but the results 
serve quite a different purpose.
Plant physical security is critical. GIS can help with placement of cameras and 
sensors for optimal coverage. It’s not uncommon for operators of large plants that 
span many acres to create a GIS dashboard that illustrates the boundaries of the 
plant, location of security camera, and access areas. 
In addition to the actual plant equipment, power plants have a number of sup­
port buildings, warehouses, garages, sheds, storage fields, miles of roads, power 
and lighting systems, water distribution, waste and storm water systems, fire sup­
pression systems, and even housing. All of these facilities need tending to. GIS can 
provide a way to organize the activities to support these facilities as part of an 
overall facilities management function.
Environmental compliance is key to the successful and continuous operation of 
a power plant as well as the successful completion of a plant under construction. 
All aspects of the environment need to be modeled, including wetlands, habitat, 
burial grounds, sacred lands, bird migration patterns, aquifers, and the air qual­
ity. Given the enormous impact a power plant can have on its surroundings, it’s 
critical that operators and developers have a solid handle on the surroundings and 
potential hazards. Many electric devices are oil filled. A simple rupture of a power 
transformer could create a major environmental event. 
A power plant has a significant impact on the community. As such, the opera­
tors must assure the public that they are doing everything to protect the community 
and all the people who work at the plant. GIS can model areas of personnel risk 
and monitor if people wander into areas of high risk. Operators need to convey 
their risk mitigation plans to the community in a way that makes sense to them. A 
GIS map is one of the best ways to do this.
Managing Information
Utilities routinely stored their old design drawings in a secured vault. While the old 
drawing vault was inconvenient, at least it was the single place that people could go 
to find the history of why something was done this way or where a specific permit 
was granted or what the results of an deep sea survey were. 
Today, that information can get fragmented, often appearing in different forms, 
like spreadsheets, word processing documents, and private databases. One way to 
keep a better handle on the history of the development of the plant and to keep track 
of the current facilities (including any new additions to the plant) is to build an energy 
supply information model. The GIS is the framework, since location is so important 
to the information in the plant. The GIS can provide an easy guide for other related 
digital data and information systems, like CAD drawings, document management

files, and work management systems. An information model consists of (from 
Appendix A):
1.	 The data model—exactly what data the GIS directly manages;
2.	 Information products—what the users will see;
3.	 Workflows—exactly what the GIS does to the data to produce what the 
user will see.
Figure 2.12 details the elements of the information model.
The Energy Supply Data Model
Each type of plant has its own data model. However, in each case, the model would 
include the following:
••
Asset data—this would include a database schema of all the facilities within 
the power supply system;
••
Relationships—the model would document the relationship of asset features 
to other asset features, such as control cables to cable trays;
••
Base maps—the model would reference the core geography and terrain of 
the plant;
••
Raster data sets—these include data structures about weather, natural disas­
ters, and other nonasset-specific data. 
The data model includes authoritative data; predictive information; measured 
data; and perhaps even social media information about how a community feels 
about a power plant.
Authoritative data about a wind power plant, for example, would include tur­
bines, gathering cables, substations, control cables, conduit and auxiliary struc­
tures, and land features. Specific data would include physical and electric data 
about the turbines, such as height, weight, blade dimensions, and linkages to de­
tailed construction information, electrical ratings, and maintenance history and 
inspection results. Authoritative data about other kinds of plants would include all 
major plant components and their ratings and history.
Predictive information for all kinds of plants would include data about past tsu­
nami damage, flooding predictions, lightning, earthquake, community opposition,

crime, and any number of data sources that relate to things that might happen and 
where they might occur. GIS models this data. Combining authoritative data with 
predictive data can gain additional insight to operators and developers.
Measured data would include real-time information from a variety of sensors. 
These include standard electrical sensors, like power flow, current, and voltage, to 
fault detection, to land movement, to ocean bottom shifts, to all kinds of real-time 
weather and wind direction and speed data. The vast majority of sensor data has 
location as a key attribute. Adding measured data to authoritative and predictive 
information just enriches the information product.
Finally, operators can mine social media data to provide all kinds of insight 
into what the community at large is thinking. They can analyze the data and dis­
play it geographically. For example, it is possible to analyze millions of tweets to 
determine the overall mood of the tweets. GIS can plot these moods on a map. 
Operators and developers can gain a better insight into their operations and future 
expansion plans. One of the most costly and troublesome aspects of building any 
substantial project is the permitting process. Using GIS authoritative, predictive, 
measured, and social media data gives developers a more focused insight about 
what to expect during all phases of plant operation and development.
Information Products
The end result of a work product, like a design, a survey, and a risk assessment, is an 
information product. It is the information that appears as an output of a workflow. 
This is often displayed in the form of a map of some kind or at least referenced in 
some way to a map—to a location. When designing a GIS for particular process, it’s 
important to have a solid understanding of the elements and information that needs 
to be displayed. In other words, what information does the consumer of the process 
or workflow need to see to be able to proceed to the next process or workflow. Here 
are some examples within the energy supply business of what users need to see:
••
Hydro plant production planning map;
••
River topology showing potential flooding areas;
••

••
Upstream and downstream flow maps;
••

These represent just a sample of the types of information products that could 
be useful in the operations and development of a power plant. The information 
products contain data. This data is either stored directly within the GIS or is ac­
cessed by the GIS in order to produce the information product. The trend in com­
puting today is to keep the information products relatively simple and focused on 
conveying only a limited set of information.
Workflows 
Workflows are the part of the information model the details what the GIS does 
to the data, often along with input from the user to produce what the user sees—
the information product. Once the information products are determined—in other 
words, what information does the operator or developer need to get in order to 
more effectively run or build a plant—then they can develop the steps needed to 
bring that information together in a workflow. Once the workflow and information 
products have been determined, then the data needed to drive the application can 
be gathered and modeled.
For example, the information product needed to determine the production of 
a hydroelectric plant is the hydroelectric plant production-planning map. This in­
formation product is needed to determine exactly what the flows will be through 
the plant for the next production cycle. The workflow consists of gathering land 
feature data, projected and actual rainfall, and measured water levels; performing a 
spatial analysis; converting the spatial analysis results into actual projected produc­
tion values; and then producing the output.
Another example of a workflow is the determination of where to place secu­
rity devices at power plant installation. The workflow is to gather data about all 

50 
����������������������������������

possible paths leading into the plant: data about the access roads, land features, 
hiding places, areas of high risk, and places to install cameras. Then the next step 
is to perform a spatial analysis of the data to determine the areas of highest risk of 
intrusion based on all the factors. The analysis could include an optimization of 
costs compared to the risks. The information product is a map showing areas of 
highest risk and the proposed locations of security cameras, motion detectors, and 
any other detection devices.
A workflow to determine the risk of damage of a wind power plant due to 
earthquake can be performed by gathering data about earthquake fault lines, data 
layers of predictions of various earthquake intensities, slope data, and structural 
data of the turbines. The workflow involves modeling various earthquake scenari­
os, combining the scenarios into various GIS layers, and performing a weighed spa­
tial overlay to determine which turbines are most at risk during various earthquake 
intensities and locations.
A popular workflow is the one that shows the solar electric potential of an ur­
ban area. The workflow involves converting raster images of rooftops into numeri­
cal areas, gathering solar density data, calculating shadows and sun directions, and 
determining the degree of solar production from each rooftop. The information 
product is a GIS map that shows each rooftop in a different color that illustrates 
the relative merits of installing a solar system on the roof. 
Other workflows can be developed that relate to important community issues, 
such as showing a map of where people are most sensitive to the expansion of the 
plant. This workflow could include the results of a mailing campaign, an online 
survey, and data from news services, as well as real-time social networking feeds. 
The information product could show a map of where community activism is high­
est. This may result in a different long-term expansion plan.
So each information product will have its own workflow. As noted, once the 
information product and workflows are determined, then the data to support the 
workflow can be determined.
Location Matters in Energy Supply
The days of highly regulated prices for the generation of electricity are coming to 
an end. Power generation is a competitive business. As such, the developers and 
operators of power plants need all the tools they can get to gain a competitive ad­
vantage. Since nearly every aspect of power generation has something to do with 
where things are, GIS is a vital tool to help them keep the plants running well, keep 
employees safe and productive, make money, and stay out of trouble. GIS helps 
power generation operators and developers manage the disparate data sources in 
a more effective way by organizing the data by location, helping them see patterns 
and connections that they could not see, and distributing and disseminating infor­
mation in a simple-to-understand way, the way in fact that people have been doing 
for centuries: showing the data on a map.

Electric Transmission and GIS
Thomas Edison created the first electric power system when his Pearl Street Station 
in New York City went live in 1882. The system included a direct current (dc) gen­
erator and underground cables connecting less than 100 customers. Edison chose 
the voltage of the system to be around 100 volts as a way to balance the effective­
ness of the newly perfected light bulb and having a voltage not too high to be too 
dangerous. In this original system there was no notion of transmission or distribu­
tion. As we now know, the length of a wire from the generator to the customer was 
limited to about a half a mile. The only way for Edison to grow the system would be 
to add more and more generators separated by about a mile apart. In effect, Edison 
would have to create a network of distributed generation to be able to expand the 
system.
At about the same time George Westinghouse and his associate Nicola Tesla 
invented alternating current, which permitted the electric system to scale. The key 
of course, was the transformer, which allowed the fledgling utilities to raise volt­
ages for transmission of power over long distances. Transformers then could step 
down the voltage for safe delivery into homes and businesses.
Location Is Essential to Transmission
Even in these early days of the development of the power system, location was im­
portant, and most early utility operators mapped their systems. Figure 3.1 shows an 
early map of Edison’s original service territory. Note that electric utilities have used 
maps from the very beginning of the industry.
Along with the invention of alternating current and the transformer, Westing­
house and Tesla invented and created the electric transmission system. The notion 
of the transmission system emerged over the years to mean high-voltage current 
carrying equipment, supporting structures, and auxiliary equipment that delivered 
bulk electricity. The terms the grid, the high-voltage grid, and the bulk power sup­
ply system all are ways of describing the electric transmission system.
Today, in the U.S., the official definition of the bulk supply system is any elec­
trcial network with a voltage level of 100,000V or higher. Most other countries 
follow this general rule. Subtransmission lines that operate below 100,000V, such 
as at 69kV, are really just older transmission lines.
This chapter deals with the electric transmission and how the operations and 
system development of the transmission system depends heavily on location and of 
course GIS.

52 
�����������������������������
Electric Transmission and GIS
Transmission Lines
There are three types of transmission line construction: overhead, underground 
with solid dielectric cables, and underground pipe type cable. Underground trans­
mission lines consist of high-voltage cables that utilities bury directly in the ground. 
The last type, pipe type cable construction, consists of insulated high-voltage cables 
contained within metal pipes. Equipment pressurizes the insulating oil and pumps 
it through the pipes to increase the cooling of the cables. The system cools the oil at 
each end of the cable by forcing the oil through heat exchangers. The power deliv­
ery capability of this type of underground construction is higher than direct buried 
solid dielectric for the same conductor sizes due to the additional cooling provided. 
Here the location of the pipes are of course critical, but also the proximity to sensi­
tive environmental areas is important, should a pipe leak or rupture sending oil into 
these sensitive areas. So not only is location of the pipe and its assets important, but 
proximity is just as important.
Transmission Substations
The transmission from the power plant to the transmission or bulk power system 
occurs at the generator substation. Today’s modern generators utilize voltages in 
the medium voltage range. Typical values range from 12kV to 24kV. Most modern 
power plants link each generating unit with its own step up transformer that con­
verts the generator voltage from the medium voltage range to the transmission volt­
age range. The number of generating unit transformers at the plant depends on how 
many generating units a power plant has, typically one for each generator. Older

power plants may synchronize several smaller generators onto a single generator 
bus, but a one-for-one generator-to-unit transformer is more common. 
The generator substation then consists of the high-voltage feeds from each of 
the unit transformers often into a sophisticated bus arrangement. Figure 3.2 illus­
trates a typical generator substation schematic. Exiting the substation are one or 
more transmission lines, each one protected by one or more high-voltage circuit 
breakers. Thus, the generator substation marks one of the transition points be­
tween generation and transmission. Equipment measures the exact values of power, 
voltage, and current at the terminals of the unit transformers. These measurements 
provide insight into both the business and technical aspects of the transmission 
system. These values help enhance the visualization of the system by the GIS. 
The transition from bulk power delivery to local power delivery occurs at the 
many high-voltage (HV) to medium-voltage (MV) substations. There are a num­
ber of different configurations of bus work and medium-voltage feeders of these 
substations. The substation taps off the transmission system. Substation transform­
ers step down the voltage from high voltage to a medium voltage. The transformers 
in turn feed the medium-voltage switchgear. The medium-voltage switchgear sup­
plies the distribution feeders. These substations define termination points of the 
transmission system. Figure 3.3 illustrates a simple one-line schematic diagram of 
an HV/MV substation. Utilities locate metering equipment here to determine how 
much power the distribution system consumes. These metered values provide ad­
ditional business and technical insight to the behavior of the transmission system 
and are valuable for the transmission GIS.
Other important components of the transmission system are the high-voltage 
system switching substations. These are the HV/HV substations. They serve as a 
way of interconnecting several transmission lines to facilitate switching and line 
protection. Some substations also provide a transition between two (or more) high-
voltage transmission voltages. For example, a utility may have built and operated 
transmission lines at 230 kV. Later as the technology matured, they built and oper­
ated lines at 345 kV. An autotransformer connects two different high-voltage sys­
tems. The autotransformer consists of a single winding for the higher voltage and 
a tap off point for the lower voltage level. The switching substation provides the

breakers, protection, and measurement schemes to be able to manage these kinds 
of connections. Figure 3.4 shows a one-line schematic of an HV/HV switching sub­
station in which the two high-voltage levels are connected with an autotransformer.
Alternating current is not without its difficulties. In an alternating current sys­
tem, the waveform for the voltage and currents follow the patterns of trigono­
metric functions. What regularly happens is that the voltage and the current get 
out of phase. The more out of phase the voltage and the current, the less efficient 
the system is in delivering power. In fact, the cosine of this difference in phase 
between the voltage and the current is the power factor. A power factor of one, 
which represents a phase angle of zero (the cosine of zero is one) means that the 
voltage and current are exactly in phase. Utilities strive to keep the power factor as 
high as possible. In an ac system, voltage has two mathematical components, the 
voltage value (the voltage magnitude). A simple volt meter can measure this. The

other component is the relative phase angle from some reference angle. This is not 
so easy to measure. The difference in the phase angle has a strong influence on the 
amount of power that flows. Thus, utilities use phase-shifting transformers, which 
have the ability to increase or decrease the angle difference and thus control power 
flow. These represent an additional component of the transmission system. These 
phase-shifting transformers are large and most always located within the transmis­
sion switching stations. Phase shifting transformers make up an important part of 
the transmission GIS.
A new concept in the ongoing problem of actually measuring the phase angle 
is the so called phasor measurement unit or synchrophasor. Since voltages and cur­
rents vary with time according to trigonometric rules, these devices synchronize 
the timing with a GPS clock. The synchrophasor system measures, transmits, col­
lects, and analyzes the data to produce the phase angle at every measured point in 
the system. The result is the relative voltage phase angle at each point where the 
measurement has taken place. Prior to these systems, engineers had to perform 
complex network analysis to determine phase angles. The synchophasor system is 
highly dependent on location and GPS, so utilities will need to include this system 
in a transmission GIS.
HVDC
Today, Edison would certainly be vindicated. Direct current actually is quite ca­
pable of transmitting power over long distances but at high voltages. Standard ac 
transformers convert the voltage to high-voltage ac, and then power rectifiers con­
vert the high-voltage ac to high-voltage dc (HVDC). At the other end of the long 
transmission line, the voltage is then reconverted back to ac using power inverters. 
Unlike the ac system, there are no phase angles, power factors, or time-de­
pendent variables to worry about. HVDC lines have the advantage of isolating 
disturbances along the transmission system. Whenever ac transmission grids are 
interconnected, events such as a major failure of a line or a sudden loss of a number 
of generator units create a disturbance throughout the system and could cause the 
system to become unstable. Just prior to the 1965 Northeast blackout in the U.S., 
the electric system became unstable. The instability is largely a result of failure of 
an uncontrolled variation in the frequency of the network. With HVDC, there are 
no frequencies involved, so the HVDC lines prevent the instability of frequencies 
to propagate. In effect, an HVDC line provides a way of transporting large blocks 
of power from one grid to another while filtering out disturbances. 
Transmission System Components and GIS Data Model
While utilities will certainly maintain the information about each of the various 
parts and components of the elements of the transmission system, the location, type 
of part, and condition will play a major role in how well the system functions. 
The parts of the transmission system are as follows:
1.	 Generation substation, which receives power from the power plants;
2.	 Transmission lines, which deliver the bulk power to the HV/MV substations;

56 
�����������������������������
Electric Transmission and GIS
3.	 HV/MV substations, which deliver power from the transmission system to 
the distribution system (or large industrial loads);
4.	 Switching stations, which provide a means to switch and configure an in­
tegrated system of transmission lines, and often includes autotransformers 
and phase-shifting transformers;
5.	 HVDC stations, which include power electronics and the ac power trans­
formers and associated protection and accessories;
6.	 Sychrophasors, or measurement systems that capture the relative voltage 
phase angles;
7.	 Measurement systems at the various transmission transition points and 
changes of ownership;
8.	 Structures;
9.	 Transmission corridors and parcels.
From strictly an inventory perspective, utilities need to know where each of 
these components are, their relationship to one another, and their surroundings. 
This is what the GIS does. In addition, the GIS enhances the understanding of 
the system by spatial data management (where things are) analysis (what the data 
means in a spatial context), data enrichment (adding more meaning to the data by 
combining spatial information and analysis), and visualization (providing a frame­
work for decision making).
A System in Transition
As primitive as it was, looking back at Edison’s original delivery system, its purpose 
was clear—deliver power from the source, the generator, to the load. For the greater 
part of the twentieth century, the transmission system’s function was the same—to 
provide a means of delivering energy from generators to loads. Since late in the last 
century, the transmission system now is an open access vehicle for a competitive 
generation and wheeling marketplace. The transmission system has evolved into a 
vehicle for financial transactions as well as a vehicle for delivering power. In the 
past, the interruption or failure of a transmission system component prior to the 
open market could have resulted in outage. Today, a failure of the transmission 
system component results in both an interruption in power and a disruption in the 
market. Thus, the accurate understanding of the system using GIS is more critical 
today than ever before. 
The Business of Electric Transmission
The industry is in a transition regarding electric transmission. As noted in Chapter 
2, electric generation and energy supply are moving to full competition. In many 
countries and in a several states in the U.S., governments have required the industry 
to unbundle into its four component parts—generation, transmission, distribution, 
and retail. In some countries, the communities have created a single transmission 
utility. Nonetheless, the transmission business is still a regulated monopoly. The 
challenges and concerns from a business and operating perspective have not changed 

What Does GIS Have to Do with Transmission? 
57
much from the vertically integrated utility days. So, whether the transmission is a 
separate company, a state-owned transmission agency, or still part of a vertical 
electric company, the work, processes, and organization of a transmission system 
are the same. Figure 3.5 illustrates the main processes of a transmission business.
In addition to the actual transmission operators and owners, there are a num­
ber of regulating authorities that actually coordinate and in some cases take control 
of the transmission system. In the U.S., for example, there are independent system 
operators, like the California Independent System Operator (CALISO). There are 
regional transmission operators (RTOs) such as the PJM Interconnections. RTOs 
are similar to ISOs, except the U.S. government has required that they comply 
with the definition of an RTO. Overseeing the reliability of the grid is the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC). NERC has legal authority to direct 
transmission operations regarding reliability. In essence, the owner and operator 
of a transmission system has to coordinate its activities with a power pool, an ISO 
or an RTO, as well as NERC. By coordination, the owner must seek permission to 
perform certain actions, like switch a line out for maintenance. 
What’s critical for the smooth operation of all these entities is communication 
and collaboration. The GIS provides one additional way of making sure that every­
one involved in the transmission system from the line worker in the field doing an 
inspection or maintenance activity to the reliability assessors at one of the NERC 
reliability centers has access to the same information. Collaboration among the 
various parties making up the transmission system can get complicated.
What Does GIS Have to Do with Transmission?
Transmission is strategic. In August of 2003, the United States experienced a major 
blackout. The trigger event was when two small trees came too close to one of sev­
eral transmission lines interconnecting the Canadian grid with the U.S. grid in New 
York state. Under normal situations, this should not have caused a major blackout, 
Figure 3.5  The common processes of a transmission business unit.

58

Electric Transmission and GIS
but some technology did not function properly and some of the operators did not 
take appropriate action. When referring to this particular event, people say the 
three “T’s,” namely, trees, training, and technology, caused the blackout. The lack 
of solid situational awareness, tools for collaboration, and up-to-date data prob­
ably contributed just as much to the blackout. 
GIS is about creating a means to collect information on a common visualiza­
tion platform, namely, a map, and tell a story, often a story of what’s actually go­
ing on right now. During major events (like the 2003 blackout) the community of 
operators regularly do not have a single picture of the event, nor do they have a 
spatially oriented risk profile of the transmission system to see where vulnerabili­
ties might lie (e.g., a map of the transmission segments where vegetation manage­
ment had not occurred in recent years, overlaid with transmission lines that were 
identified as critical tie lines).
All transmission entities from operators to power pools to RTOs perform com­
plex network analysis, like power flows, short circuit analysis, stability analysis, 
and state estimation. These analyses, while essential, only tell part of the story. GIS 
provides the spatial context to the network analysis. Today’s modern GIS can easily 
consume data from these analysis systems. GIS can provide a single view of data 
from a variety of sources into a common operating picture or dashboard. 
What is involved in transmission and what does GIS have to do with it? This 
remaining part of this chapter will examine in more detail how GIS impacts the 
following:

Operations;

System development;

Support services.
What Transmission Operators Worry About
A transmission operator like the power plant operator has four important stake­
holders (shareholder, customer, employee, and community) and essentially four 
missions. Paraphrasing from the preface and the former CEO of a power company, 
transmission operators need to make money, keep their customers happy, keep em­
ployees safe and productive, and of course stay out of trouble.
Make Money
The transmission operator’s mission is to make money for the owners—to keep the 
power flowing. The system is very complicated to run. The owner invested in the 
system. The end goal is push as much power through the existing infrastructure as 
the operator can possibly do without damaging anything. If, for example, opera­
tors run the system conservatively, then they leave money on the table. If they run 
the system too hard, they risk damaging the investment and could lose the revenue 
from the power flow over the line. So having good information about the system is 
essential to running the system at its optimum flow. 

What Transmission Operators Worry About 
59
In addition to keeping the revenue flowing, transmission operators also need to 
keep expenses down. GIS tools such as routing, vehicle location, optimizing expen­
sive vegetation management, and analysis of when to replace sections of the system 
are critical for keeping expenses under control. 
Transmission owners also want to be as effective as they can when building 
new transmission facilities. Building a new line can be a minefield: acquiring land, 
knowing what the best route is, permitting, dealing with abutters, and optimizing 
the costs to provide the largest capacity line for the lowest cost. The land, the line 
configuration (the number of turns, changes in elevation), and the potential haz­
ards drive the cost. GIS plays a strong role in managing new infrastructure.
Keep Customers Happy
Direct customers of the transmission business units are the distribution utilities and 
large industrial customers who tap off the transmission system, the generators who 
pay the transmission company to use their lines to carry the power to the retailers, 
or the indirect customers—everyone else who might be impacted by a failure of the 
transmission system. The goal here is to keep the system running without failure to 
keep the power and the money flowing.
Keep Employees Safe and Productive
Safety and good information go together. The transmission system is complex and 
physically diverse. Certainly employees will know where the towers and lines are. 
However, it may be difficult for employees to access the transmission right of way 
due to flooding, hazards, fires, earthquakes, or even terrorist activities. Much of 
this information is geographic. For example, in the case of a wildfire, utility work­
ers inspecting, maintaining, or troubleshooting the transmission may find a wildfire 
has trapped them. Having a solid geographic reference for escape routes, the fire 
path, and the wind patterns could save lives and prevent disasters. 
Giving employees correct and timely information about their work, and rout­
ing them in a scientific and orderly way, improves the overall performance of the 
utility workers or contractors. Labor is one of largest costs for a utility. Field labor 
represents the bulk of that labor costs. Utilities can fine-tune the movement of 
people and material using GIS. 
Mapping tends to be a language that everyone understands. It was one of the 
earliest communication tools of society. GIS allows groups, teams, and individu­
als to communicate problems, risks, status and locations for the purpose of col­
laboration. With GIS readily available on desktops, the web, smart phones, and 
tablets, utilities can collaborate using the ancient tool of mapping to better support 
the business. Giving employees tools that better foster communication and col­
laboration results in fewer missteps and an overall safer and more effective work 
environment.
Stay Out of Trouble
On July 31, 2012, one tenth of the world’s population suffered a blackout. It was 
the most severe blackout in history, 130 years after Edison switched on the first

electric grid. The problem was the failure and collapse of much of the bulk supply 
system, the transmission system. The cost of a blackout of this size to society is 
enormous. The cost to a utility can be catastrophic in real dollars and in diminished 
reputation. GIS cannot make the grid more robust or add a single kw to generating 
capacity or improve the voltage. What GIS can do is provide a framework for better 
insight into what is happening and what could happen. 
Managing Transmission System Operations
The main drivers of the transmission system operator are as follows:
••
Keep the power flowing at all times to the customers.
••
Run the system as efficiently as possible.
••
Prevent accidents.
••
Comply with all regulations.
GIS in the Control Room
The people huddled in the control room operate the transmission system on a 
second-by-second basis. The transmission dispatchers watch the transmission sys­
tem carefully, monitoring its every movement. When a sensor buried deep within a 
power transformer at a switching substation sends an alert that the nitrogen levels 
are too high, the transmission system operator or dispatcher makes a decision. That 
decision could involve a switching action like taking the transformer out of service 
and rerouting power along a different path, creating a work order for the mainte­
nance crews, doing nothing and waiting, or a variety of other actions.
The main tool of the dispatcher is the supervisory control and data acquisi­
tion (SCADA) system. It allows dispatchers to remotely control the transmission 
system from within the control room or energy management center (EMC). Nearly 
all transmission SCADA systems consist of the control computers located at the 
EMC and remote terminal units (RTU) at each of the substations and other loca­
tions throughout the transmission system. The RTUs marshal all alerts and trans­
mit those alerts to SCADA. In the example of the nitrogen gas alarm, the RTU 
sends the signal to SCADA indicating that a particular transformer had an alarm. 
Depending on how comprehensive the SCADA system is, the alarm could be that 
something is amiss at the substation, that something is amiss at a particular trans­
former, or that there is a high nitrogen alarm at transformer 1B. SCADA receives 
this information and displays it to the operator.
The vast majority of visualization tools in SCADA systems are schematic. They 
show detailed substation schematics, like those in Figure 3.4. They show the trans­
mission lines that interconnect the substations but do not show the physical repre­
sentation of the transmission lines or substations. For example, if a fault occurs on 
a 25-mile section of a transmission line, SCADA creates an alarm that a fault has 
occurred and it will show which breakers tripped. SCADA has no mechanism to 
show the operators where the fault is or what conditions might be at that location. 

Managing Transmission System Operations

GIS in the Field
The next step for the dispatcher is to send a troubleshooter to the area of the trans­
mission system to locate the fault. The dispatcher may get other clues as to where 
the problem might be, such as a police report of a fire near the line or a report of a 
loud noise or flash or plane crash or some other event that may (or may not) help 
the troubleshooter narrow the search for the problem. Of course, if the fault hap­
pens to be in an area that is inaccessible by a truck, the troubleshooter would then 
have to perform a foot patrol or obtain a snowmobile or an offroad vehicle. The 
point is that given that the line is 25 miles long, the process to actually locate the 
fault could take several hours. 
A loss of an element of the transmission system results in a loss of capacity, 
which could result in a loss of revenue if the line results in outage. It is thus critical 
for the operators to assess the damage, put processes in place to fix the problem, 
and get the line back in service as quickly as possible. One line out of service in­
creases the risk of the failure of the entire transmission system. If, for example, 
another line has a fault, this again increases the risk of catastrophic failure of the 
system. At some point, utilities know that there is a tipping point in which the loss 
of one more component could cause the system to go unstable. Utilities know that 
they must never get to that tipping point. What they need to do before they ever 
get to that point is to shed (drop) load. Load shedding does what every transmis­
sion operator and owner does not want to do, shut the power off for some of the 
customers. Sometimes the term for shedding customers’ loads is rolling blackouts. 
Whatever the term, it is a bad thing, but necessary to preserve grid operations. 
Utilities perform contingency analyses and study the impact of losing one or more 
components to see exactly what conditions would need to exist to get to that tip­
ping point.
While SCADA doesn’t know exactly where the fault is, parts of the utilities’ 
automation systems and other available information provide clues. The GIS can 
pull together these clues to help pinpoint the location of the fault and help assess 
what the conditions are near the fault so that repair crews don’t have to guess what 
to bring to the fault site. For example, when a fault occurs on a transmission line, 
it generates a large volume of current. The control system reads the fault current 
value and takes action. A breaker opens, clearing the fault. After the breaker opens, 
no more current flows. Impedance relays accurately measure the volume of fault 
current and can calculate distance from the breaker to the fault. Since SCADA 
doesn’t capture the location of the lines, it can’t provide much help as to exactly 
where the fault is. However, the transmission system GIS can accurately locate the 
position of the fault based on information from the impedance relays. This gives 
troubleshooters and repair crews insight well before they have to go to the field to 
investigate. This information helps crews find the shortest path to the problems 
and gives them the nearest access roads.
The GIS helps to add additional information to the restoration and fault 
location effort. If there were other clues, like someone saw a fire and called the po­
lice, the GIS could display their location. The GIS then would provide a means to 
take authoritative automation data, as well as other information, such as fire lo­
cation, to pinpoint the location of the fault. The GIS can also help determine the 
cause of the fault, by bringing in data from additional outside sources and systems. 

62 
�����������������������������
Electric Transmission and GIS
A major cause of a transmission line fault is lightning. Most transmission op­
erators have a lightning-monitoring system or service. Merging data from the light­
ning system into the GIS could tell if strong lightning was in the area. If the utility 
had a feed from the forest fire agency and discovered there was a wildfire in the 
region, the utility would know that the line may be inaccessible and dangerous to 
try to repair. Figure 3.6 shows a GIS map with real-time lightning strike data.
Understanding the Variables
The GIS does not replace the SCADA system in any way. It provides the missing 
spatial context and facilitates the workflow for transmission line repair.
Transmission operators regularly perform offline network analysis to help 
them understand the nature of the system. This network analysis simulates what 
might happen during a contingency or during high load levels. The result of the 
analysis is a listing of voltage (magnitude and phase angle) at each junction in the 
network. The GIS can consume this data to give operators a sense of where issues 
might occur, not from a schematic perspective but from a spatial one.
Compliance
Another significant problem for transmission operators is to make sure that the 
system is compliant with regulations. Most regulators have the same goals as the 
transmission operators themselves: keep the power flowing. So they reward utilities 
that do that and punish utilities that do not. A key element of compliance is the 
strict maintenance of good information. In the United States, NERC issued an alert 
that indicated that they believed that some transmission operators did not have ac­
curate information about the location of their towers. They ordered the transmis­
sion operators to do whatever was necessary to assure accurate location of towers. 
They suggested that operators use light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to do this.

LiDAR uses laser technology to send signals from an aircraft to the ground. 
Each returned signal represents a data point. The round-trip time of the signal 
determines the distance from the source. So LiDAR is a very accurate way of mea­
suring the location of devices, land elevation, tower location, and tree canopy. The 
output of LiDAR is millions of points. LiDAR providers can characterize sets of 
points, called point clouds, into specific categories, like ground elevations, trees, 
and transmission towers and lines. GIS can display the characterized point clouds 
to determine additional information like any encroachment or clearance problem 
for the lines. LiDAR data can enhance GIS data by feature data recognition and 
feature data extraction. Most LiDAR data sets also come with detailed imagery of 
the areas as well, which can be incorporated into the GIS data. 
For example, if operators do not have an exact representation of the ground 
elevation under a segment of line and do not know exactly where the towers are, or 
what the weather is, or wind speed, or age of the conductor, or the last time some­
one trimmed the trees, operators will of course make assumptions—conservative 
ones or risky ones. With a solid GIS model of the transmission system, including 
the ground clearances and good facilities data, the operators can make the right 
decision about how hard to push the line. Figure 3.7 shows a simplified profile of a 
transmission line with the data as the operator believes is correct. Figure 3.8 shows 
the line with the exact locations, but the operator is not aware of this real situation. 
When a line is heavily loaded, the conductors sag. Add wind, and the conductors 
sway. The degree of sag depends on a number of factors, but loading is certainly the 
most critical and controllable factor. Note the location of the knoll under the line. 
Since the operator does not know the exact location of the knoll in relationship to 
the towers and the line conductors, the operator does not know the maximum sag 
that would be allowable in this line section. In the first case, the operator will be 
too optimistic in rating the line based on a misunderstanding of the clearance of the 
sagged conductor to the ground.
While SCADA and substation automation systems provide insight into what 
is actually going on the transmission system, GIS with additional data sets from 
LiDAR gives the operators the exact location of their facilities. Of course, this will 
assure the regulators that the operators will make the right decisions about how

hard to push the transmission lines. Further, it gives the dispatchers the tools to 
minimize problems along the transmission lines.
Vegetation Is the Transmission Line’s Enemy
Failure to manage the vegetation of an overhead transmission line invariability 
leads to failure or flashover of a transmission line. The traditional way to manage 
vegetation along a transmission right of way is to schedule the clearing or trimming 
of the right of way on a multiyear basis. So vegetation management planners would 
assign sections of the right of way to be trimmed or cleared based strictly on a fre­
quency basis. For example, section 5 of right of way 7 would be trimmed or cleared 
every five years. Every section of every right of way, then would trimmed every five 
years on a rotating basis. The problem with this approach is that it does not take 
into account the natural variations in the vegetation along the sections of the right 
of way. It may be better to trim or clear some sections (or parts of sections) more 
aggressively and others less aggressively.
When expenses are tight, utilities can be tempted to extend the trimming cycle 
an additional year. Yet there may be places along the right of way—even short sec­
tions—that have fast growing trees. Extending the trimming or clearing just one 
more year could result in a clearance violation and a flashover of a transmission 
line. 
Planners can take into account the variations of species and the variation in 
factors that contribute to tree growth by using GIS. This gives utilities the ability 
to optimize their spending on vegetation management, while focusing their efforts 
on those areas that are most problematic. Utilities can also use GIS to manage the 
various work packages that utilities create for trimming and clearing contractors.
A simple example of a GIS analysis is to discover which areas of the transmis­
sion corridor contain fast-growing trees. Of course this is a simplistic notion of 
vegetation management, but it is another example of the GIS overlay analysis. Here 
are the steps:

••
Obtain a GIS-based fast-growing tree polygon raster data set along the trans­
mission line or right of way corridor. 
••
Obtain a GIS-based raster data set showing average rainfall in areas along 
the right of way for a period of several years.
••
Create a simple raster data set showing the transmission rights of way for a 
particular study area. The raster data set can be easily created from the vec­
tor data set of easement parcels.
••
Obtain a GIS-based raster soil permeability data set. 
••
Obtain other data sets that may influence tree growth (e.g., sunshine, cloud 
cover, insect contamination, wetland area, slopes, areas of low or high drain­
age, etc.)
••
Normalize each data set based on a common scale (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 
10). 
••
Establish a weighting factor for each factor. 
••
Perform a GIS weighted overlay analysis—this creates a new map that il­
lustrates the most likely location where trees will grow into the transmission 
lines.
Often the results will be displayed along with detailed imagery of the area. 
Utilities can also perform “tree growth analysis” based on the factors in each of 
the polygons. 
The resultant fast-growing tree raster data set consists of regions or polygons 
with each pixel having a value that represents a ranking of how fast or slow the 
trees in the areas grow. When displayed in the GIS, fast-growing areas are shown 
in dark colors while slow-growing areas are shown in light colors. 
Many of the data sets would come from the local conservation commissions, 
the government, or an analysis of detailed imagery. If a government commission 
provides the data as a GIS layer, the utility could request the data set be provided 
electronically through a web service. This simplifies the data-gathering process. 
The output product of the analysis is a series of line segments or, in the GIS ter­
minology, a new feature showing only those rights of way that cross a fast-growing 
tree zone or a new feature showing each right of way segment in a different color or 
a different shade of the same color, with each color representing the degree of tree 
growth (the darker the color, the faster the tree growth in that area). The analysis 
creates a new line feature having the same location as the original right of way.
Figure 3.9 illustrates the simple workflow of how to overlay polygon features 
to simple line features.
Asset Management
Transmission operators must have a solid understanding of their assets to be able to 
understand whether to continue to maintain the assets as they have been doing or to 
consider replacements. This is the essential nature of asset management. There are a 
variety of tools at the transmission operators’ disposal for doing sophisticated anal­
ysis to getting to this answer. They can use historical data, equipment failure rates, 
spending information, and algorithms that can predict when a piece of equipment 

66 
�����������������������������
Electric Transmission and GIS
is likely to fail. The one piece of data that often is the most difficult to obtain is the 
condition information, since that will often involve a visit to the field. 
Foot and helicopter patrols are common workflows. The most common way 
to collect this condition information is with the use of mobile device with GIS and 
GPS functionality. Once the field workers capture the condition data as an attribute 
of the asset, then the utility can perform effective asset management.
Once the analysis is performed using asset management tools, such as an en­
terprise asset management (EAM) system, utilities will often want to express the 
results in the form of a map. However, GIS can actually add more insight into the 
results by including a spatial context. For example, if a section of a transmission 
line is deemed to require replacement, the GIS may show obstacles or difficulty fac­
tors, such as the proximity to wetlands, slopes, or landslide areas that may trigger 
additional study. GIS provides the inventory of the equipment, the location, and 
the condition and can provide additional insight near the lines that may impact the 
decision to repair or replace. 
Risk Profiling
A question that every transmission operator would like to know is what parts of the 
system are more likely to fail than others. An EAM can provide some of that infor­
mation, but not all. A line that is of a certain age or is subject to continuous heavy 
loading are clearly at higher risk, but there are other factors that are purely spatial.
Utilities use GIS to refine risk. Transmission system risk has two compo­
nents: how likely the equipment is to fail and how hard it will be to repair. If a 
transmission line is crossing a mountain pass, regardless of its age and service duty, 
it will be more difficult to repair than a line running along a freeway in the middle 
of a city. 
The concept behind risk assessment is to combine all the known data about 
risk into a weighted overlay analysis using the same tools that are used for vegeta­
tion management. The difference is that the data sources are different. In this case, 
the analysis uses the attributes of the transmission line itself from the facilities 
model of the GIS, like age, failure rate, and any other factor. For a simplified risk 
assessment for a transmission line, the process would include the following:

••
Identify every transmission line segment in the study area.
••
Provide inputs from EAM systems and GIS attributes for each line segment 
including the age, failure history, cost of maintenance, and any additional 
risk analysis results.
••
Normalize the attribute values so they can be added numerically. For ex­
ample, age can be expressed on scale of 1 to 10. An age greater than 50 years 
gets a 10, new gets a 1. Weightings can be used at this step if needed.
••
Create a raster data set from the vector representation of the transmission 
line. 
••
Assign attribute values to the pixels along the transmission line location 
based on the combined transmission line attributes. 
••
The resultant map will then show transmission lines with various shades, 
based on the combined attributes. A section of line that is old and has been 
repaired frequently will be shown in dark red, for example.
••
Obtain or create a GIS raster data set of lightning strike historic data prepro­
cessed into lightning activity zones.
••
Obtain or create a GIS raster data set of earthquake fault lines.
••
Obtain or create a GIS raster data sets with landslide zones added.
••
Use the vegetation management age zones—the time from when the vegeta­
tion was last attended to.
••
Obtain or create a GIS raster data sets that show proximity to hazardous sit­
uations (like near municipal airports) or known high crime areas or known 
hunting areas.
This is just a short list. Planners can add more hazards. For example does the 
line segment cross a river? If so that represents an additional risk value.
The analysis involves taking each of these GIS data sources and normalizing 
them into a similar format. GIS tools perform this. So for example, if a lightning 
map is a raster map where each pixel shows a value of basic insulation level (BIL) 
for each location, the spatial analysis model would be convert or normalize the 
data to a scale of between 1 to 10, 10 being high. Likewise each factor would be 
converted to a similar scale, where the highest risk represents the higher value, 
again with 10 being the highest risk. 
Once all the nonspatial and spatial data are normalized into a consistent set 
of spatial information all based on the same risk scale, the spatial analysis model 
performs a weighted overlay process plus a proximity analysis for those hazards 
near the line, creating a new line feature that inherits all the attributes of the other 
layers. Then each line segment can be visualized on a map. The GIS displays the 
segment with the highest risk score in the darkest color. 
Other Uses of GIS for Operations
The following is a list of other transmission line workflows that use GIS:
••
Call before you dig—digging into a high-voltage underground transmis­
sion line is deadly. The energy unleashed during a transmission short circuit 

68 
�����������������������������
Electric Transmission and GIS
is enormous. So it is critical for each operator to have precise information 
about where an underground cable is located. The GIS is convenient to fa­
cilitate the process of taking call before you dig requests and locating under­
ground cables.
••
Insulation coordination—transmission operators must make sure that the 
insulation ratings for the system are correct and represent the best design 
for possibly changing situations. Most insulation coordination software is 
available only as a standalone application. It is not often sold as part of an 
enterprise solution. So modeling the insulation systems in GIS helps to coor­
dinate the data. Reporting the results of insulation coordination studies in 
GIS provide a means of giving greater insight into any insulation breakdown 
issues. As noted earlier, a common cause of transmission line outage is due to 
lightning. Flashovers from lightning are caused by a failure of the insulation 
to protect the line. The GIS can provide a convenient way of coordinating 
lightning protection with the results of insulation coordination studies.
••
Electromagnetic fields (EMF)—in the 1990s, utilities were involved in a 
number of battles over the issue of EMF. The controversy centered on the 
claim that EMF from transmission lines caused a health risk. Every transmis­
sion line produces EMF. The strength of the EMF diminishes with distance. 
Utilities can use GIS to determine exactly the extent of EMF from their lines 
and see what lies within what levels of EMF. 
••
Grounding—deterioration of the grounding equipment can lead to failure 
of the insulation to protect the transmission equipment. So, having a good 
inventory and condition of the transmission grounding system provides the 
utility with better asset management and risk mitigation. The GIS could 
provide an analysis that studied unaccounted for flashovers and correlate 
that information to field inspections of grounding systems answering the 
questions of where have there been unexplained flashovers and where are 
grounding systems are in need of repair.
••
Environmental—power transformers, breakers, pipe type cable, and other 
equipment are filled with large volumes of insulating oil. Should a leak or 
rupture occur, the transmission operator will be responsible for the cleanup 
of any environmental issue caused by the oil. So GIS can manage the proxim­
ity of any kind of sensitive environmental area near oil-filled equipment. The 
GIS can also model the various leak or rupture analysis to determine what 
impact that a spill might have.
Substation Management
The most common representation of the data about substations in the transmis­
sion network in GIS is the typical substation schematic or one-line diagram, like 
those shown in Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3, and Figure 3.4. However, in the GIS, these 
diagrams should be part of the connected network of the transmission system and 
stored at the correct location/position of the substation. In addition, each element 
of the substation, such as the transformers, switches, and breakers can be key refer­
ence for other data. For example, the GIS can reference the entire catalog of shop 

Managing Transmission System Development 
69
drawings, design details, wiring diagrams, and panel schematics to the particular 
breaker feature in the GIS. The symbol of the substation yard or building can be 
the locational reference for all the site-related documents, such as general layout, 
building, and grounding plans. The GIS can reference other auxiliary systems such 
as batteries, RTUs, and annunciator boards to the substation location feature.
Utilities maintain hundreds of documents for each of their substations. Having 
a way to organize the documents with information in the GIS provides a conve­
nient way to add a spatial component to the management of substation drawings 
and documents either directly or in concert with a commercial document manage­
ment system.
Managing Transmission System Development
Transmission operators perform system simulation all throughout the day to help 
understand what will happen in the next hour or even minute. To do that success­
fully, they need an accurate model of the transmission system. The GIS provides 
the data about connectivity, materials, and of course location. Transmission system 
planners need the same information about the network for future planning and 
development. They need to know what plans have been approved and when. So, 
if planners are studying the needs of the network in five years, they need to know 
what the network will look like based on the projects that they will complete be­
tween the present and the study year. 
While not commonly done, the GIS can be a place to hold each future network 
configuration based on the projects that the company plans to complete. The GIS 
can identify what elements of the system they will add, modify, and remove so that 
the planners can have a projected complete transmission network representation at 
any point in the future. They can do this by tagging the equipment in-service date 
as an attribute or by creating different versions for different future years. Thus, the 
GIS can serve as a record of the progress of the transmission system from today 
forward to answer the question of what the system will look like in one year, two 
years, or five years. 
Load Forecasting
The most basic input to a system planner’s work is a projection of what the load 
will be in a future study year. GIS is a common tool for load forecasting for both 
transmission and distribution. The distribution planners of course will need more 
of a subregional approach, whereas the transmission system planners need a more 
macro approach. The workflows are similar and involve GIS spatial analysis. 
The planners begin the process with a regional analysis of the current loads. 
From the consumption and loading information, planners create density maps of 
population. Planners look at the demographics and income levels for today’s load 
mix. Figure 3.10 shows a simple GIS web map illustrating regions (polygons) of 
income levels.
Planners can use other data sources like the average age of the population. De­
mographic data such as population profiles (urban, green aware, NASCAR aficio­
nados, people most likely to buy electric cars, and so on) is well known and easily 

70 
�����������������������������
Electric Transmission and GIS
obtainable. Each of these data sources is displayed as a map layer. The spatial anal­
ysis can associate load levels with a weighted overlay of these different data sources 
to get a picture of how the current electric load patterns are associated with differ­
ent demographics. Other nondemographic data can be added to the analysis, such 
as land that is not developable (e.g., protected wetlands, mountainous regions, and 
badlands). The analysis can include present and projected zoning information from 
community master plans.
Once the planners complete the spatial analysis for the present day, they can 
then project these factors into the future using available prediction patterns from 
a number of different commercial sources. Factors such as planned transportation 
additions (like high-speed rail or subway systems) can be included. The net result 
of the load-forecasting model is a load density map. The final step is to overlay the 
current transmission system and perform a new power flow analysis based on the 
new load projections and see where deficiencies emerge.
In the past, planners simply took the load data (at, say, each of the HV/MV 
substations) and projected load growth uniformly. However, this ignores the sig­
nificant variations in the regions. Figure 3.11 illustrates a simplified GIS load-fore­
casting analysis.
Line Siting
One of the most interesting aspects of transmission planning is the science of line 
siting. The concept was introduced in the introduction and this as noted was one of 
the earliest applications of GIS spatial analysis. Once the planning for a new trans­
mission line is completed or once a demand for a new transmission line is estab­
lished (say, for a new wind farm or power plant), the process of line siting begins. 
The process starts with: find the best route for a new transmission line from point a 
to b or from point a to the existing transmission grid. The best route is the one that 
minimizes the cost, the risk, and problems of permitting.

71
This process is similar to the risk analysis. In the case of risk analysis, the line 
is already built. In line siting, planners want to limit the risk, so the factors are 
similar. They need to avoid areas of high natural risk, like fault lines, areas where 
tornadoes are likely to strike, and regions where it will be difficult to access the 
new line. In the line siting analysis, additional factors such as cost, the number of 
proposed bends in the transmission line, the construction difficulty (like crossing a 
river or significant change in elevation), sensitive environmental areas, aesthetics, 
avoiding population areas, and land availability are added to the mix.
The analysis follows the same pattern as other spatial analysis processes. The 
planners assemble all the input data sources. The sources are normalized to a simi­
lar scale. Weighting is added to each source. The result is a new map that illustrates 
areas of optimal route. The map combines all the factors together and displays 
the results as a graded or shaded map, and the darker the shade is, the highest the 
favorability is for the line. It doesn’t show one solution but a map with continuous 
regions of favorability. It is not uncommon to do a preliminary design to see if the 
actual construction costs of the various routes are optimized. The routes then are 
sent to standard transmission design software packages, where costs are created. 
Then, the costs can be used as another input factor in the spatial analysis and the 
analysis reperformed. 
The process is iterative. Once the planners create the preliminary analysis, they 
will often meet with community groups to determine exactly what the community 
reaction is. This meeting may result in adjusting some of the factors or changing 
the weighting. Permitting is often the most difficult and time consuming part of line 
siting, so having a GIS model that can immediately adjust factors provides a way to 
move the permitting process along much quicker. 
Construction Management
The process of building a new transmission line or substation involves complex 
coordination of resources. Regardless of the project, whether it is a roadway, an air­
port, a substation, or a transmission line, nearly every aspect of the project involves

location. The GIS can provide the project with the means to coordinate activities, 
to show progress, to show delays, and to help with the overall effort.
Managing Transmission Support Services
Whether the transmission operator is in the middle of a major upgrade to the facili­
ties, building a new line, performing maintenance, or tracking down a fault, the 
transmission operator needs a number of support functions. 
In order to stay out of trouble, the transmission operator must have an active 
compliance tracking mechanism. In the U.S., NERC has issued a number of regula­
tions called critical infrastructure protection (CIP) requirements. While the prime 
driver behind these regulations is cyber security, the tracking of compliance can be 
facilitated by GIS elucidating where a company is compliant and where it is at risk. 
Of course, physical security is a high priority for a company with strategic and dan­
gerous assets. The GIS provides visualization of the threats and helps to associate 
the threats with other activity in the area.
Supply Chain
Whether building or maintaining, utilities need to manage materials and people. 
They have to deal with spare parts, sourcing, and locating spare parts. When a 
transmission line is out of service, either during an unplanned or planned outage 
event, even if there is no customer outage, every transmission operator knows that 
the longer the line is out, the greater the risk of a catastrophic failure of the system. 
So, having ready access to the needed resources is essential. If a utility is investing 
in a new line, every hour of delay getting the line in service means lost revenue. So 
the support process of the supply chain is critical.
GIS can provide a means to optimize the locations where utilities can best stage 
material, locate the shortest path for routing of inspection crews, and identify areas 
of construction risk, such as the proximity to sensitive environmental or cultural 
areas. Chapter 8 will deal in greater detail with general utility supply chain issues 
and opportunities. 
Corridor Management
Transmission operators have to access the land the transmission equipment is built 
upon. Often, the land is not owned directly by the transmission utility. The trans­
mission right of way consists of a patchwork of parcels, with different owners and 
possibly different rights granted to the utility. The utility must understand the rights 
that the landowner has granted it. For example, a transmission operator regularly 
installs ground conductors with fiber-optic cables embedded in them. Or, the op­
erator might install cell phone equipment at a substation. The utility may wish to 
lease a set of spare fibers to a commercial telecommunications provider. However, 
before they can legally do that, they have to understand if the easement or lease 
grants the utility the right to use the land for something other than the purpose of 
transmitting electricity. If not, then the utility cannot legally lease a fiber stand for 

The Transmission Information Model 
73
commercial use. The utility needs to capture each parcel along the right of way and 
capture exactly what rights the easement in that parcel grants. This information is 
most often captured in or accessed by the GIS.
As stated earlier, the elevations of all the land along the right of way needs to 
be captured for clearances. During inspections, the utility has to capture encroach­
ments along the right of way. Encroachments consist of any kind of material or 
construction that is not allowed in the easement according to the easement agree­
ment. Common examples of encroachments are abandoned vehicles, sheds and out 
buildings, and paving. Encroachments can be unsafe and an additional risk factor 
for the transmission line segment. Encroachments are most often captured dur­
ing the inspection process, which is performed using a mobile GIS application. As 
noted earlier, LiDAR is a convenient method of capturing encroachments.
Often a transmission line right of way is not located directly near paved streets 
and roads. It can be a challenge for the utility troubleshooter to gain access to the 
transmission right of way. The utility has no right to drive a vehicle across right 
of way abutter’s land, even if the troubleshooter sees a problem. The only way a 
utility vehicle can legally gain access to the right of way is through an access road, 
which is either owned by the utility or the utility has gained an easement from the 
landowners. Since these access roads are rarely used, they can deteriorate or get 
overgrown with vegetation. It is important for the utility to clearly document the 
location of the access roads in their transmission GIS. Regular imagery captured 
along the right of way managed by the GIS is an excellent way to see the actual 
conditions of the access road.
Change Detection
One interesting GIS spatial analysis tool that transmission operators can use to help 
in corridor management is called change detection. Change detection is simply the 
comparison of two raster input files that were created at different times. Each pixel 
is compared producing an output product that highlights areas of change. This is 
helpful to uncover recent encroachments and to assess the condition of the access 
roads. If, for example, there is a bridge as part of an access road, change detection 
could uncover a washed out bridge. Change detection is especially useful before and 
after severe weather events and where flooding has occurred.
The Transmission Information Model
As noted in Chapter 2, an information model consists of a data model or data mod­
els, information products, and workflows. Perhaps the most important mission of 
the transmission operator is to keep the power flowing over the system. The second 
is to be absolutely certain that the company is complying with all regulations. So 
the operator needs information products that support this mission. In the long term, 
the operator needs to understand exactly when the system needs to be upgraded 
or added to. They also have to be keenly aware of the generation market, since in 
addition to keeping the power flowing, they are required to provide open access to 
any and all generation companies.

The Transmission Data Model
The transmission data model consists of data about the following:
••
The land corridor—this includes all the ownership, rights, permits, access 
points, vegetation types, and conditions;
••
Surroundings—the sensitive areas, habitat, hazards, historic weather 
patterns, and environment; 
••
Real-time data—the power flows, voltages, and outages;
••
Assets—the location of every piece and part of the system or a way to locate 
all the assets;
••
The community—who they are, what they are thinking, and the density;
••
The customers—what their demands are;
••
The generators—what their plans are and what their generation capability 
will be.
The GIS should not store all this information in a giant database. Instead, the 
GIS needs access to this information from a variety of sources, some of it created 
in other systems, some coming from internal systems such as SCADA or EAM 
and other information accessed from various agencies and governments. The 
GIS provides the spatial representation, the analysis, the dissemination, and the 
visualization.
The data model for the transmission system is really the collection of various 
raster data sets or layers, plus a detailed representation of the actual facilities that 
make up the transmission network, including the transmission lines and the high-
voltage substations and generator substations. 
Information Products
The main information product are the maps that show what is happening now, 
where there are faults, and how best to get to those faults. Since lightning and 
vegetation are the main culprits of line damage, transmission operators need infor­
mation products that illustrate where the hazards are likely to exist. From an engi­
neering perspective, they need GIS maps that locate every asset and its condition. 
Other examples of important information products:
••
Boundary maps—jurisdictions;
••
Overview maps of the transmission interconnection spatially reference;
••
Schematics;
••
Property acquisition maps;
••
Environmental maps showing sensitive areas in proximity to oil-filled 
equipment;
••
Spill-mitigation plans;
••
LiDAR maps for line clearances;
••
Future loads, proposed and current projects;

Workflows 
Workflows take the data, sometimes user input, and display what the user will see 
on their screen, tablet, or smart phone from the web, their hard drive, or the cloud. 
The workflows that create the products are driven by the business requirements. 
The applications and workflows tend to be organized into four categories: data 
management, analysis, field integration, and awareness. 
Transmission operators are faced with an enormous array of data sources; 
some of the data is within their control and creation, but much of it is controlled by 
outside forces, like the weather or angry citizens opposed to a new line or substa­
tion. The GIS workflows help pull the data together. One example is a maintenance 
application that helps workers bring data together from prior inspections, field 
hazard information, sensitive habitat, land ownership, current weather, and more. 
The application then helps maintenance planners craft the best daily work plan to 
optimize the cost and effectiveness of the maintenance plan.
The application that determines the best route for a new transmission line com­
bines data management and sophisticated analysis to answer the question of what 
the best route is for this line. Applications for the field provide data management 
and analysis, and allow the field workers to provide feedback from actual situa­
tions to the decision makers. Finally, applications provide the utility with the situa­
tion as it currently exists, which brings data management, analysis, and field intel­
ligence to the decision makers so they can shorten outage time, prevent damage, 
and keep workers and the public safe.
Getting data from other systems provides a rich environment for decision mak­
ing. Keeping good historical records based on spatial data keeps utilities out of 
trouble and provides transparency. Making sure that all parties know the exact 
configuration of the system is critical and often very difficult to achieve.
GIS Matters for Electric Transmission
Transmission is spatial by nature. Transmission is everywhere. The GIS provides a 
convenient means to see all aspects of the system as it exists today as well as how it 
could look tomorrow. Historically transmission has been represented in schematic 

76

form. The vast majority of SCADA systems are schematic. While this provides an 
easy way to visualize the relationship of lines to each other and lines to substations, 
it does not provide the spatial context of exactly what’s going on in the system.
Transmission operators are gaining a better appreciation of the value of spatial 
analysis for risk profiling, siting, and planning. GIS doesn’t replace the design sys­
tems, the security systems, or SCADA. Instead, it compliments all of these systems 
by answering the questions of where things are, what’s going on where, and per­
haps even why that might be the case.

The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities 
Model
This chapter will cover the distribution system itself, detailing the various compo­
nents of a GIS facilities model. Chapter 5 will cover electric distribution business 
problems, such as new designs, inspections, asset and risk management, mainte­
nance, and restoration. This is a growing area within the utility GIS users. Rather 
than restrict the GIS to technical information that they know, such as the location 
of a pole, the business applications are more about discovery or data enrichment. It 
combines the authoritative data (from the facility model) with business intelligence, 
such as predictive and real-time information, to gain business insight that leads to 
more informed decisions. Chapter 6 will address restoration and emergency man­
agement of both transmission and distribution. See Figure 4.1 for a breakdown of 
the workflows for the two different categories of GIS in electric distribution.
Distribution Business Versus Retail

for the utility. Today, the tasks of metering, billing, and customer engagement define 
the retail business. In many countries and in several states within the U.S., govern­
ments have required formerly integrated utilities to unbundle their retail business. 
Further, the governments do not regulate the retail businesses, and therefore they 
can set their own prices and terms. However, the only aspect of the price that is not 
regulated is the price of the electricity itself, not the transmission and distribution 
delivery charges. This chapter and Chapter 5 will cover the distribution delivery 
business. Chapter 7 will address customer care, which for many distribution utili­
ties is essentially the retail business. Many deregulated electric retailers or competi­
tive suppliers can bundle other services such as broadband, gas, and telephone. As 
detailed in Chapter 7, GIS will play a strong role in the retail business, particularly 
regarding marketing new products, services, and demand response programs.
Who Owns the Meter?
The role of the meter in the delineation of the distribution business from the retail 
business is still not fully settled. As utilities roll out smart meters, the data from 
these devices have two users, the distribution business and the retail business. The 
distribution business needs the data to render the bills for the delivery charges 
(which include transmission charges as well.) The retail business uses the data for 
billing, too, but also for marketing other services. Soon, utilities will use the data 
to manage demand. Globally, the dust has not settled on the issue of who actually 
should own, operate, and maintain the electric meter—the distribution utility, the 
competitive supplier (the retail business), a third party who manages just the me­
ters, or the customer. For the purposes of this chapter, the meter is part of the cus­
tomer care organization, but the data about the location of the meter is important 
for both the distribution business and the retail business. Regardless of who owns 
it, the meter location or at least the location of the end point of the service line is 
managed by the distribution business and is normally managed by the GIS.
The Business Drivers for Distribution
The business drivers of electric distribution like the transmission business are as 
follows:
••
Make money—that is, the company must make a profit to exist or, in the 
case of government utilities, not lose money;
••
Keep customers happy—that is, to maintain high availability and quality of 
power;
••
Keep employees and consumers safe;
••
Be a responsible member of the community. It must be able to provide service 
to all that seek service. 
To accomplish this mission, the electric distribution business must manage day-
to-day operations, make sure that the infrastructure will support the future de­
mands, provide connections to new customers, and provide support services to fa­
cilitate the mission, like having fleet support, logistics, and materials management. 

Distribution System Mapping Started a Century Ago 
79
Figure 4.2 shows the organization of a distribution electric business. The next 
two chapters will focus entirely on the distribution delivery tasks. Chapter 6 will 
detail emergency and operational management, related to power failures and resto­
ration, and the following chapters will deal with customer care (the retail business) 
supply chain (the support for the business, finance and accounting, and corporate 
services).
To meet the lofty goals of making money, keeping customers happy and em­
ployees safe, and being a good neighbor, utilities recognized early on that they 
needed the right information. Given the nature of a distribution system where their 
equipment is scattered throughout their service area, they knew they needed a way 
to keep track of all of their assets. So they used maps.
Distribution System Mapping Started a Century Ago
While integrated electric utilities’ use of GIS in the generation and transmission 
business has been spotty, they have modeled their electric distribution systems in 
some form of digital mapping systems since the 1970s. The reason is simple. The 
electric distribution facilities are everywhere. The number of elements in a distribu­
tion system is an order of magnitude greater than elements in a transmission system. 
Results Have Been Mixed
Over the years, utilities have viewed the extent, degree, and success of these early 
digital mapping systems with some skepticism. Even today, many distribution utili­
ties view their digital mapping systems, often misnamed GIS, as a network docu­
mentation system. They misname the system since many of these digital mapping 
systems are simply replications of their early hand-drawn maps on a computer. A 
real GIS can manage and process, spatially adjust, and fuse a variety of spatial data 
sets, enrich the data with spatial intelligence, and publish the result over the web 
to decision makers in the company and customers outside the company. The most 
common (and sometimes the only) workflow of these digital mapping systems is 
updating the digital maps with as-built sketches of new construction and mainte­
nance, then printing and distributing the maps for use by field crews and maybe 
distribution planners—essentially the same workflow (only faster) that utilities had 
been using a century ago.
For the most part, utilities implemented early digital mapping systems to au­
tomate the mapmaking process, not to help run the business in a more effective 
Figure 4.2  The common process of an electrical distribution business unit.

����������������������������������������������
The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
way. In fact, for some utilities a hard and fast requirement of the digital mapping 
system was that the output products had to exactly mirror the old paper maps. 
The only difference between the old paper maps and the computer-generated maps 
was that the text and symbols were clearer. Ironically, as it turned out, the early 
computer-generated maps actually had trouble replicating the old maps, because 
the drafting people could take all kinds of liberties with the placement of symbols 
and text. Since the use of paper maps and the old mapping grid systems dominated 
the workflow of utilities, digital mapping systems that simply replicated the old 
processes are not much more effective than the hand-drawn systems they replaced. 
Why Paper Anyway?
The problem that early users of digital mapping systems were trying to solve was 
strictly a map production problem. The problems they were trying to fix were: 
how can they make changes faster (like a word processor for drawings), not have 
to erase large sections of the maps, and how to keep better records of exactly what 
is in the field? So the design of these early systems never foresaw the use of these 
systems for outage analysis, risk profiling, asset management, or as a critical com­
ponent for smart grid.
The other issue is that since maps took a long time to make and the old hand-
drawn maps were hard to edit, utilities put as much information into them as they 
possibly could. The maps then served all kinds of workflows, from restoration to 
engineering. With a modern GIS, the maps can be tailored specifically to the work­
flow. Despite all the advances in today’s modern GIS, and technology in general, 
utilities still attempt to create their GIS maps to look just like the old hand-drawn 
maps.
A very simple example of a modern way of conveying information on a GIS 
map is in the use of pop-ups. Pop-ups are used extensively in smart phones and 
tablet apps. Text is kept to a minimum since displaying text takes additional com­
puting power. Instead, most tablet mapping apps simply display atrtributes or in­
formaiton about a feature or point of interest on demand. A user clicks on a symbol 
of say a point of interest, like a bank symbol and the system displays the details of 
the bank in a pop-up. In an old printed map, all of the attributes of every system 
needed to be printed. Figure 4.3 is an example of a simple electric distribution map 
with a pop-up that shows information about a device. Very little text is actually 
displayed all the time, unlike in a paper map.
The main reason that distribution digital mapping systems have had mixed 
results is because the use, development, and dissemination of the digital maps and 
ancient grid systems are tightly linked to old business processes and the comfort 
and familiarity users had with the old paper maps.
Digital Mapping Systems Evolve
Utilities and vendors coined the term automated mapping/facilities management 
(AM/FM) to describe digital mapping systems of electric distribution systems and 
gas and water distribution systems as well. Utilities adopted AM/FM systems pri­
marily to document the location of electric distribution assets, create an editing 
workflow, and then plot the results. Once utilities created the plots, they would 

Distribution System Mapping Started a Century Ago 
81
distribute copies of the plots, just like in the old days, when they made copies of old 
linen and Mylar maps. Once the plotted copies arrived in the field, the staff treated 
them exactly like the old-fashioned maps. The new prints sat in a pile, waiting for 
someone to transfer the redlines from the old file copy print to the new one just 
issued by the GIS. Figure 4.4 is an example of how utilities marked up old paper 
maps.
As noted in Chapter 1, the main capabilities of a “real” GIS include data man­
agement, analysis, and awareness. Eliminating the idea that someone has to cap­
ture spatial information on a printed map or a map display that looks like a printed 
Figure 4.3  Pop-ups help convey information on a map. (Source: Esri et al.)
Figure 4.4  Typical redline markings on an old map.

map helps turn the conversation from the GIS being used as a better, faster map 
maker to using GIS as an information system. Field personnel can capture correc­
tion information in the field directly in the GIS, not by marking up a paper print 
with a red pen. Utilities can use the GIS to discover things that they can’t see di­
rectly, such as the location of the electric distribution system that is most vulnerable 
to failure based on real-time information. Finally, the whole process of map pro­
duction, editing, printing, and distribution can be eliminated entirely by providing 
direct access to the GIS to everyone in the company on the their desktop, over the 
Web, on their internet TV, or their smart phones. Figure 4.5 details the evolution of 
the electric distribution business from hand mapping on linen to cloud-based GIS.
The next several sections detail how the electric distribution system is modeled 
in GIS.
The Electric Distribution System Facility Model
In the early days of electric utilities, there were only two systems: generation and 
electricity delivery. Edison’s plants generated the electricity and Edison’s wires de­
livered the electricity to the homes and businesses. With the advent of the transmis­
sion system, the distribution system as a separate entity evolved. Today, the U.S.’s 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) defines transmission as any electric 
delivery system operating at 100,000V or greater. Similar definitions exist outside 
the U.S. That implies that any electric delivery system operating below that voltage 
level is something else: distribution. Old legacy transmission lines that operate at 
lower voltages such as 69 kV or even 35 kV don’t really function in the classic sense 
as distribution lines. For the purposes of this book and this chapter, these subtrans­
mission lines are just old transmission lines, and when utilities model them in the 
GIS, they treated them just like transmission.
The distribution network has two voltage levels: medium and low.

83
Medium Voltages 
Medium voltages have a wide range of values. The term medium simply means not 
high voltage, such as voltages common for transmission systems, such as 100,000V 
and above, and not low voltage, such as voltages below 1000V. Like transmission 
systems, the medium-voltage network has evolved over the years. Many electric 
distribution systems have several medium-voltage networks. This is not by design. 
Early medium-voltage networks consisted of equipment designed for relatively low-
medium voltages, such as 2300V or 4000V. Over time, utilities installed equipment 
designed for higher medium voltages, such as 11,000V and 15,000 V. Utilities have 
adopted medium voltages at 35,000V for new installations. The reason utilities 
still operate lower-medium–voltage networks is simply that the older networks are 
adequate and the expense and disruption of a change out of these older networks 
does not make financial sense. To deal with multiple medium-voltage systems, utili­
ties installed medium-voltage to medium-voltage substations. The substations can 
be as simple as a single three-phase step down transformer to a complete sub­
station with breakers and bus bars. Even within a single nation, there may be a 
number of variations of medium-voltage levels, even within general categories. For 
example, utilities in the U.S. operate equipment rated at 15,000V at voltages such 
as 13,200V, 13,800V, 14,000V, and 14,400V due mainly to their past practice and 
the difficulty of reconfiguring their systems. This makes it difficult to interconnect 
medium-voltage systems from neighboring utilities.
Low Voltages
The low-voltage networks also can have several different voltage levels, but for 
more practical reasons. Normally, the voltage of the low-voltage network is the 
actual utilization voltage of the customers. In North America, the normal utiliza­
tion voltage is 240V single phase. Most North American single-phase transformers 
have a mid-tap connection, which provides 120V for receptacles and small loads. 
Outside of North America, the low-voltage system provides 220V phase to ground 
based on a three-phase voltage of 380V. (This value also varies somewhat from 
country to country.) For larger commercial loads, higher low-voltage networks of 
480V and even 600V three phase occur. In mesh secondary networks, voltages of 
208V three phase are common in the U.S.
Parts of the Distribution System and the GIS Data Model
The facility model as captured in the GIS is the inventory of all the various parts and 
pieces of the distribution system located on a digital representation of the world, 
that is, a map, or base map. There will be considerable discussion of the base map 
or, as it is sometimes called, the landbase later in Chapter 8. Distribution systems 
have six parts, as illustrated in Figure 4.6. 
The Electric Distribution System GIS Facility Information Model
These parts form the basis for the facility electric distribution system information 
model:

The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
••
Distribution substations—for the purposes of this book, these substations 
are called high-voltage to medium-voltage (HV/MV) substations.
••
The medium-voltage network—these are the energized equipment operating 
at medium voltage, such as wires, arrestors, switches, capacitors, and voltage 
regulators.
••
Medium- to medium-voltage (MV/MV) substations—these provide the 
bridge between newer medium voltage networks to older ones.
••
Low-voltage substations—these provide the bridge from the medium-voltage 
network to the low-voltage network.
••
The low-voltage network—these consist of the energized equipment that 
operates at low voltages, such as wires, fuses, and fault limiters.
••
The structural elements (noncurrent carrying)—that support the distribu­
tion system, like poles, platforms, cross-arms, manholes, conduits, pipes, 
duct banks, pad mounted structures, trenches, tunnels and a host of other 
hardware.
The next several sections provide additional detail about the various parts of 
the electric distribution system, along with issues that often arise when modeling 
these components in the GIS. In addition, these sections include a discussion of the 
data model for each of the components at a high level. The next level of detail of 
the data model is the actual database table or schema for each of the parts or fea­
tures. This book will not describe this level of detail. The detailed schema depends 
on the requirements of the GIS software selected, the industry standards that may 
be followed, the level and method of integration with other systems, the semantics 
used, and the information products expected from the GIS.

The core GIS attributes of the each of the various components are the unique 
identification of the feature itself and any relationship the feature has to some other 
feature. For example, the GIS needs to identify a regulating transformer uniquely 
by a name or identification tag. The GIS also must establish a relationship to its 
support structure location. The other key attribute of each feature is its connectiv­
ity to other current-carrying features, such as one conductor span to the next span. 
The GIS creates this type of modeling implicitly. The GIS has a built-in workflow 
that understands that if one end of the representation of a conductor is coincident 
with one end of another conductor, it creates the connectivity of the two conduc­
tors. Users can create a connectivity model in which the user explicitly creates con­
nectivity by selecting which features are connected. Another approach is a hybrid 
in which most connectivity is implicit, but in special cases the user can override the 
implicit connectivity and force nonspatial coincidence connectivity.
A good rule is to only include attributes within the GIS if the GIS is the only 
system that creates and stores the attributes. Modelers often include many other at­
tributes such as age of conductor, manufacturer, impedance, short circuit, and volt­
age ratings. However, other systems such as enterprise asset management (EAM) or 
meter data management (MDM) create and store the vast majority of these kinds 
of attributes. Just because users want these attributes to appear on an information 
product produced by the GIS does not mean that the GIS must directly store the 
attribute values. If two different systems update and store the same information, 
data synchronization can become difficult. The GIS can hold temporary data from 
other systems for performance reasons, but storing and editing of attribute data in 
one place is the best design.
HV/MV Substations
High-voltage to medium-voltage substations technically exist in both the transmis­
sion system (Chapter 3) and the distribution system, and provide the transition 
place between the two networks. Using a transport analogy, if the transmission is a 
wholesale bulk delivery system (such as cross-country rail) the substation would be 
the depot where material is off-loaded to local delivery trucks.
There are three sections of the substation: the high-voltage section, which 
consists of the tap off the transmission line, with switches and often high-voltage 
breakers; the transformer section; and the medium-voltage section. All the sections 
consist of three-phase equipment.
The High-Voltage Section
The high-voltage section will often have metering equipment that measures the 
power supplied from the transmission system to the distribution system. This be­
comes especially important when a different entity from the distribution utility 
owns the transmission system. In many parts of the world, the transmission owner 
and operator is a single entity within the country, often owned by the government. 
These transmission operators then supply power to distributors, some private and 
other public. The high-voltage section also includes equipment to protect and to

isolate the HV/MV substation should problems occur within the substation or the 
transmission system.
The Transformer Section
The transformer section consists of the bulk power transformers themselves, any 
grounding equipment directly connected to the neutrals of the transformers, and 
breakers on the medium-voltage side of the transformer. Technically the demarca­
tion point between transmission and distribution is buried deep within the power 
transformers. Since the HV/MV substation is more often owned completely by the 
distribution utility, utilities create the demarcation point between the transmission 
and distribution system at the tap point off the transmission lines.
The Medium-Voltage Section
Each transformer’s medium-voltage winding supplies power to a medium-voltage 
bus, through a transformer medium-voltage breaker. A bus is a three-phase copper 
structure that facilitates the distribution of power to the various feeders. In cases 
where there is more than one medium-voltage bus, it is common design to connect 
each bus by a normally open bus tie breaker. Should a transformer fail or transmis­
sion line trip out, the bus tie breaker closes. This allows the feeders from both buses 
to continue to supply power to medium-voltage feeders. Medium-voltage feeder 
breakers connect to the bus. Each bus supplies a number of feeder breakers. The 
medium-voltage section distributes the power from the transformers to the various 
feeders that will distribute the power throughout the territory supplied by the HV/
MV substations. Many GIS implementations do not include the HV/MV substa­
tions within the GIS and begin at the medium-voltage breakers.
Other Equipment in the Substations
In addition, substations have sophisticated control and relaying schemes that take 
automated action should a fault occur within the substation. They have backup 
power systems, automation systems, telecommunication equipment, annunciation, 
and a host of other equipment in the substation.
Issues of GIS with HV/MV Substations
Most early electric utility digital mapping systems focused almost entirely on the 
medium-voltage network. As noted earlier, the majority of electric utility GISs start 
or end at the HV/MV substation feeder breakers and include the low-voltage sub­
stations but don’t always model the low-voltage network. That means that the HV/
MV substations are regularly not included in the GIS at all. They should be.
Most electric utilities are organized along functional lines. The line groups 
manage the distribution networks. Often a different group manages substations. 
The demarcation point for line operations and substation operations is frequently 
the substation property boundary. 
Utilities established mapping departments within the distribution areas, so it is 
not surprising that the maps and thus early digital maps did not include the feeding 

HV/MV Substations

substations. Perhaps another reason for not including the HV/MV substations is 
that the personnel who dealt most with substations used schematic diagrams to 
visualize the operations of substations. Further, most SCADA systems had auto­
mated the control and monitoring of the HV/MV substations, so they had a tool 
that could serve as a way of analyzing these substations. The problem was and still 
is that without modeling the substations in GIS, even in schematic form, utilities 
find it difficult to do analysis on the complete distribution system. If an engineer 
needs to perform a relatively routine analysis to determine the cause of circulating 
currents through a substation, the engineer has to collect information from two 
very disparate systems, a SCADA system or a CAD representation of the substa­
tions and the GIS. Automating the analysis under these situations is difficult.
While utilities can represent substation equipment in their actual physical or 
geographical position, most utilities that model the substations in the GIS model 
substations in their schematic forms. Even in schematic form, the equipment can 
still maintain a reference to the actual geographic position, though not the exact 
location within the substation. For example, the GIS can perform a systemwide 
query asking questions like, where are there differential relays that the utility has 
not maintained in the last four years? To successfully accomplish this query, the 
GIS must have a link to information about the relays. As long as the GIS locates 
the busbar geographically and the link exists, the query will produce the results. 
This is a good example of the GIS locating a piece of substation equipment, 
say, a transformer breaker, and linking it to other information in the substation, 
like relays. In this example, another system stores the relay information, such as a 
relay management system or work management system. Locating the transformer 
breaker spatially in effect locates all linked information such as relays spatially 
even though there is no direct spatial reference for the relays in the system that 
manages them.
The Data Model
The data model of the HV/MV substations includes the current-carrying features of 
the substation along with basic characteristics. The features in the GIS fall into sev­
eral categories such as disconnecting devices, instrument transformers, monitoring 
points, conductors, transformers, and shunt devices. The data model can include 
other features, such as station batteries. Modelers could include other features as 
belonging to a building feature class of substations, which relate only to the build­
ing itself. This modeling belongs in the general category of facilities management. 
Utilities often include the tasks of facilities management in the supply chain support 
function. Table 4.1 summarizes the features of the HV/MV substation.
Depending on the information products (that is, the displays required by a 
particular workflow), attributes can be accessed from other corporate systems. For 
example, the date a substation mechanic repaired or inspected a transformer or the 
age of a transformer may be needed for a GIS query, but that data is better man­
aged by an EAM system.

The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
Medium-Voltage Network and Feeders
The medium-voltage network includes the conductors, switches, fuses, and protec­
tive devices, such as lightning arrestors. They include voltage-control devices like 
capacitors and voltage regulators. The medium-voltage network consists of indi­
vidual feeders that supply power to local neighborhoods, factories, and commercial 
facilities up and down the city streets and country roads mounted on overhead 
structures, directly buried in the ground, or encased in pipe, duct banks, conduits, 
and a host of other structures. Using the transportation analogy, the medium-volt­
age circuits are like the trucks that take material to from the depot to the stores. 
The vast majority of customer outage occurs due to a failure or problem with 
the medium-voltage feeders. It is not surprising that distribution utilities focus 
heavily on the maintenance and upkeep of these feeders. Further, it’s not surprising 
that most utilities started their digital mapping systems with the medium-voltage 
feeders since keeping good records of exactly what is in the field is critical for the 
good operations, maintenance, and construction of the distribution system.
GIS Modeling Issues on Medium-Voltage Feeders
The facility model of the GIS has the task of creating an easy-to-use and visualized 
view of the medium-voltage feeders displayed on a base map, usually along with the

structures that hold or carry the medium-voltage feeders. It also has the task of rep­
resenting an electrically correct connectivity model of the feeders. Utilities need to 
know what is connected to what for the purpose of tracing, fuse coordination, load­
ing, determining transfer capability, planning, and providing the logical network 
to other digital systems like load flow and short circuit analysis programs, outage 
management systems, or distribution management systems. So this dual role of the 
model of the medium-voltage network (which is really the collection of medium-
voltage feeders) of cartography and the basis for connectivity can be a challenge.
The original reason for the creation of the digital representation of the net­
work was to improve upon the logistical mess of keeping feeder maps current and 
to deliver the most current maps to the various users throughout the company. So 
initially, cartography was entirely the focus of the digital systems. Later, utilities 
discovered that as they automated other parts of their systems, such as outage 
management systems, they realized that they needed network connectivity as well. 
However, by then, many utilities had already committed to a cartographic repre­
sentation, so retrofitting these early systems became complicated. For example, 
from a cartographic perspective, a single line from one pole to another represents 
a three-phase overhead feeder, even though there are three phase conductors and a 
neutral. Additionally, a variety of insulator and cross arm configurations exists. If 
the utility wanted to show only the location of a single-phase MV/LV substation, 
they could represent that substation as a symbol at a point that connects to the 
medium-voltage three-phase line. Figure 4.7 shows an example of a simple repre­
sentation of the single phase MV/LV substation. However, the single phase MV/
LV substation in reality does not intersect the medium-voltage line at all. Rather, 
the actual construction consists of a tap conductor off one of the medium-voltage 
phase conductors that connects to one side of a fuse holder. Then, another single 
conductor connects to the medium-voltage bushing of the single phase transformer. 
Figure 4.8 shows this.
So the cartographic representation may not always represent the logical con­
nectivity of the system. In this simple representation of Figure 4.7, the single-phase 
fuse is in the wrong place from a connectivity perspective. The transformer appears 
to be in series with all three phases of the medium-voltage feeder. This configura­
tion is more like a regulating transformer. In fact, the transformer and fuse are ac­
tually tapped off only one phase of the medium-voltage feeder. Unless the modeler 
identifies the transformer as one that is tapped off phase a or b or c by including 
an attribute for the phase, the utility will have no way of knowing which phase the 
substation (in fact, a simple single phase transformer) is connected to. Even if the 
utility was diligent in making sure that they correctly updated the phase as an at­
tribute, the utility could at some point swap phases, thus creating a situation where 
the topological model is incorrect.

The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
Esri performed a benchmark study called “Is Your GIS Smart Grid Ready?” at 
www.esri.com/smartgrid. In that study 250 utilities responded. One of the ques­
tions asked if the utility had accurate phase designation. Only 30 percent of the 
respondents thought that they adequately maintained phase information. The im­
plications of this are that utilities won’t be precise about the impact of outages, 
even with a complete smart metering implementation.
Utilities must balance simplicity of cartographic representation with the need 
for precise logical representation. Adding tiny tap lines clutters up the data and 
creates a more awkward representation. As utilities use GIS more and more as 
the foundation for their smart grid implementations, they will craft more flexible 
modeling options, such as scale dependency models that are simple at lower scales, 
showing a single line for all three phases zoomed out (smaller scales) and detailed 
three-phase representations at larger scales and perhaps detailed three-dimensional 
representations at even larger scales.
The representation of complex underground implementations poses significant 
cartographic and logical challenges. In many large cities, utilities built systems of 
underground duct banks containing a matrix of conduits. To represent each cable, 
let alone each phase of each cable, as a separate cartographic feature can be ex­
traordinarily cumbersome. If, for example, within a 30-ft street in the old part of 
the city, the electric utility had installed 6 duct banks, each with 12 conduits, the 
total number of possible cables could be 72 three-phase cables. Even at very large 
scales (zoomed way in), the representation of 72 unique linear features within a 
30-ft section of street is difficult. Assume that the scale of display is 1 in = 100 
ft (a relatively large scale), a 30-ft street at that scale is less than one half an inch 
wide. So to display 72 parallel cables within less than half an inch would result in a 
meaningless display. Only until the zoom level at 1 in = 5 ft would the user be able 
to distinguish one cable feature from another. Then, if the utility wanted to display 
each phase and neutral as a separate feature, they would have to increase the num­
ber of cable features by four. Even at very large scales, they would be compromising 
the location of the cables.

So the simple underground GIS models will need to address the complexity of 
features within features for displays that conform to the specific situations, not a 
replication of standard map products based on traditional printed maps.
GIS Medium-Voltage Network Data Model
The data model of the medium-voltage network includes the current-carrying fea­
tures of the network along with basic characteristics. The features in the GIS fall 
into several categories, such as disconnecting devices, in line transformers, monitor­
ing points, conductors, transformers, and shunt devices. Table 4.2 summarizes the 
features of the medium-voltage network.
Medium- to Medium-Voltage (MV/MV) Substations
The medium- to medium-voltage substations connect one medium-voltage level to 
another. These substations can be as simple as a single three-phase pole mounted 
step down transformer to a complete substation with switchgear and control build­
ings surrounded by a chain link fence. The sole purpose of this type of substation 
is to provide a transition point between one medium-voltage network to an older 
legacy network. Like HV/MV substations, there are three sections: the high-voltage 
section or, more precisely, the higher of the medium-voltage section; the transformer 
section; and the lower-medium–voltage section. 
Other kinds of substations include medium-voltage switchgear that distributes 
power to various parts of large campuses. These would not include transformers 
but would include feeder switches and medium-voltage switchgear. 
The GIS could have significant gaps in the continuity of the medium-voltage 
network if utilities don’t model these substations. Since many digital mapping sys­
tems and later GISs do not model substations at all, this gap is still quite common.

GIS Issues on MV/MV Substations
The representation of MV/MV substations is similar to the representation of HV/
MV substations. The difference is there are two medium-voltage sections, not a 
high-voltage section and medium-voltage section. The higher of the medium-volt­
age sections is the primary side, while the lower of the medium-voltage sections 
is the secondary side. Each side will have disconnecting switches, breakers, cable 
connectors, and bus work. Transformers will step down from the higher voltage to 
the lower voltage. 
What will change is the traceability of the phase conductors from one side to 
the other if the transformers have different phase configurations. For example, a 
transformer connected in a typical delta-wye configuration shifts the phase con­
figuration. Phase 1 on the primary side does not correspond to a phase a on the 
secondary side. So if a utility wanted to know which customers are connected on 
phase 1 from the primary side of the substation, that query is impossible to deter­
mine on the secondary side (assuming a delta-wye transformer in between), since 
phase 1 may correspond to the line to line represented by both phases a and b. 
Modelers have to account for this. This situation exists even for simple step down 
transformers (which are simplified MV/MV substations).
GIS Data Model for MV/MV Substations
The data model of the MV/MV is quite similar to the data model or the HV/MV 
substations. Table 4.3 summarizes the features of the MV/MV substation.

Low-Voltage Substations 
93
Low-Voltage Substations
Low-voltage substations bridge the gap between the medium-voltage level and the 
low-voltage level. They consist of the tap off the medium-voltage feeder, medium-
voltage fused disconnects or switches, one or more transformers, and low-voltage 
switchgear. These substations can be single or three phase. The simplest example 
and a very common one of a low-voltage substation is a single phase tap off a 
single-phase medium-voltage line, no fuse, a single transformer, and no low-voltage 
switchgear. Most utilities in the U.S. do not refer to these implementations as sub­
stations. They commonly refer to this equipment as simply a distribution trans­
former. However, technically, this equipment serves the purpose of a substation. 
Network and Spot Network Substations
A network substation is a special type of low-voltage substation. It feeds a low-volt­
age mesh network or a low-voltage spot network. These network substations are 
common in congested downtown areas where reliability is critical. Like other sub­
stations, they consist of three parts: the medium-voltage section with three-phase 
switches that isolate the substation from the medium-voltage feeder, the network 
transformer, and low-voltage section. The low-voltage section includes a specialized 
piece of equipment, called a network protector, which provides protection against 
the low-voltage mesh network from back feeding from low voltage to the medium 
voltage in the case of a fault on the medium-voltage feeder. These substations are 
often in sidewalk vaults or special rooms within office buildings or malls. The 
medium-voltage feeders supplying these substations are typically of underground 
construction and often are dedicated only to feeding these network substations. In 
fact, in most cases, even the HV/MV substations that provide the feeders to these 
low-voltage substations provide dedicated service to these very reliable network 
substations. Again, like other substations, utilities do not commonly model these 
network substations in GIS. Paper drawings or CAD files are often the only repre­
sentation of these network substations.
Surface Mounted Substations
Common in suburbs and rural areas are MV/LV substations contained within cabi­
nets mounted on fiberglass or concrete pads. Both three-phase and single-phase 
units are common. The substations are surface mounted, but both the medium- 
and low-voltage feeders are buried, sometimes in pipe, but regularly directly in 
the ground. Instead of medium-voltage switches, many of these substations have 
specialized connectors that can be removed with a tool that when pulled can sepa­
rate the cable from the transformer medium-voltage terminal. These connectors are 
sometimes call elbows, because they resemble the shape of a human elbow.
GIS Issues for MV/LV Substations
Utilities model the medium-voltage connections for pad-mounted low-voltage sub­
stations in the GIS. Low-voltage substations range from very simple to very sophis­
ticated network substations with all levels of complexity in between. As with other 

94 
����������������������������������������������
The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
substations, the representation in a GIS is a compromise between a true spatially 
correct representation and a schematic one. For complex low-voltage connections, 
like in network substations, the GIS representation is hybrid with the overall repre­
sentation of the equipment being spatially correct to a point and the connectivity of 
the parts, like the low-voltage fuses, buses, and switches represented schematically. 
Since most GISs represent the distribution system equipment on a two-dimensional 
map, vertical connections between the feeding lines and the substations are difficult 
to represent in two dimensions; thus, utilities take liberty with the actual physical 
location for the sake of logical connectivity. As long as the users understand the rep­
resentation, this usually works well enough. This will likely change as GIS vendors 
add more and more three-dimensional capability directly in the GIS.
Low-Voltage GIS Data Model
The data model of the MV/LV substations is a simpler version of the other substa­
tion data models. Table 4.4 summarizes the features of the MV/LV substation.
The Low-Voltage Network
Low-voltage networks have several components:
••
Low-voltage mains. Three-phase or single-phase wires or cables whose 
source is the low-voltage substation. These mains are generally radial in na­
ture, but in some configurations they can be manually switched to be con­
nected to other low-voltage substations at junction points. Some utilities call 
these low-voltage mains secondary mains.
••
Street lights. Street lights are supplied from dedicated low-voltage circuits or 
are connected directly off low-voltage mains. The ownership of street lights 
is with the distribution utility, the municipality, or individual customers.

The Low-Voltage Network

••
Low-voltage services. These are wires or cables that tap off the low-voltage 
circuits that feed directly to customer meters or service points. The owner­
ship of the low-voltage services is with the distribution utility, the end use 
customer, or some combination of the two.
••
Customer meters. The distribution system ends at the customer meter. Own­
ership of the customer meter is with the distribution utility, a retail competi­
tive supplier, or rarely with the end use customer. The ownership of the meter 
varies around the world and is determined by the regulating authority. 
••
Low-voltage generation. While end use customers own the vast majority 
of low-voltage distributed generators, they still are part of the distribution 
system because they have direct impact on the low-voltage network. When 
they are generating more power than the customer is consuming, they supply 
power back into the low-voltage network.
••
Low-voltage mesh networks. These networks consist of cables that are fed 
from secondary network or spot network substations. The cables are all in­
terconnected forming a tight mesh of conductors. Should a fault occur in this 
network, the cable often burns clear with no customer outage.
GIS Issues with Low-Voltage Networks
The reason that utilities did not include the low-voltage networks in their GIS is 
probably because they are simple (like in North America). Another reason is that 
the cost of detailed conversion from the old paper maps of a lower priority system 
was too expensive. In any case, many utilities have not converted their low-volt­
age systems to any great detail. With the increasing popularity of local generation 
sources, like wind and solar systems, that connect directly into the low-voltage 
network and the increasing (or projected increase) use of electric vehicles connect­
ing to the low-voltage network, low-voltage networks could be subject to increased 
stress. Thus, modeling this system will be critical so that utilities can determine if 
overloads are likely to occur.
Utilities have also neglected to model the low-voltage secondary or spot net­
works, which are extremely dense and complex. Very often, special groups within 
the utilities manage and operate these unique networks and have their own net­
work documentation systems. Rarely do these mesh networks make it into their 
corporate GIS. One reason is that they rarely fail. However, when they do fail, the 
restoration can be quite difficult. In addition, if they fail, large sections of down­
town cities will be without power. Another issue is that over time these networks 
can become compromised. In a conventional low-voltage network, failures always 
result in customer outage and the utilities simply repair what has failed. In a mesh 
network, failure of a cable does not result in customer outage, since there are so 
many paths the power can take to supply the customers. That’s the good news. The 
bad news is that unless utilities have sensors and monitors along sections of the 
network, they never know when a failure has occurred. Documenting the network 
in the GIS allows the utilities the ability to model flows and uncover where gaps 
exist in the mesh as a result of equipment or cable failure.

GIS Low-Voltage Networks Data Model
The data model of the low-voltage network includes the current carrying features 
of the network along with basic characteristics. Table 4.5 summarizes the features 
of the low-voltage network.
Distribution Structural Elements
Structural elements of the distribution system consist of all the equipment support­
ing or encasing current-carrying equipment. There are several types of distribution 
system construction.
Overhead Construction
Overhead construction is the simplest to build and maintain. It is also the easier 
type of construction to represent in GIS. The most common structural element of 
the distribution system is the ubiquitous wood or concrete pole. Of course there 
are many variations on pole construction from cross arm, spacer, and wooden plat­
forms mounted on poles. Most digital mapping systems and GISs represent poles, 
but few actually detail the variations in the construction. While wood poles are 
most common, Figure 4.9 shows an example of a concrete pole commonly used in 
the state of Parana, Brazil.
Wood pole construction is most vulnerable to severe weather, so it’s not sur­
prising that utilities focused heavily on mapping their overhead systems. Overhead 
construction consists mainly of wood, concrete, and steel poles with various types 
of mounting hardware. Utilities regularly capture pole information in the GIS. 
Figure 4.10 shows a typical wood pole.

Surface System Construction
Surface systems consist of cabinets mounted on concrete or fiberglass pads. Utili­
ties either directly bury the cables in trenches or pull the cables through conduit 
that they bury in the ground. Utilities capture the location of the pad-mounted 
equipment in their GIS. However, utilities often do not document exactly the loca­
tion of the trenches or the conduits that make up the structural network. Figure 
4.11 illustrates a simple cabinet that houses a single-phase surface- (pad-) mounted 
transformer.
Underground Construction
A complex network of underground manholes, vaults, duct banks, pipes, and con­
duits make up a sort of transportation network for the electrical cables. Utilities 
occasionally model the underground structural elements such as manholes, duct 
banks, and conduits but rarely in any level of detail. To gain information about these

structural elements, utility personnel have to refer to other sources of information 
like construction sketches or CAD drawings.
GIS Issues with Structural Elements
Utilities have a spotty record of maintaining the structural elements of the distri­
bution system such as the poles, trenches, duct banks, conduits, pipes, manholes, 
hand-holes, vaults, tunnels, and service pipes in the GIS.
What is particularly important is the relationship of the structural elements 
to the current-carrying elements like the cables, conductors, and medium- and 
low-voltage equipment. During problems or when utilities need to construct new 
equipment on or within existing structural elements, workers lose precious time 
by trying to coordinate disparate sources of data. The main purpose of modeling 
the distribution GIS is to improve the awareness of the location, condition, and 
relationship of the entire distribution system, including the structural elements. As 
noted in Chapter 1, the GIS is able to perform spatial analysis, which can discover 
problems before they occur, but only if all the information is available. If, for ex­
ample, a network vault is subject to tidewater flooding, then corrosion of equip­
ment would be more severe than one that is not. Or, if that same network vaults 
need to be switched out, knowing that the vault is actually flooded when switching

is needed would be good to know, before the crew shows up and is faced with a 
situation they were not prepared for.
The Density of Underground Structural Systems Is a Problem
Underground structural systems proved to be challenging to represent cartographi­
cally. This is the same problem as noted earlier for the cables as well. If, for ex­
ample, mappers wanted to properly show a 12 × 12 duct bank down the middle 
of a city street, they would somehow have to show 144 conduits in a section of 
a 30- or 40-ft street. At scales of greater than 400 feet to the inch, this would be 
impossible. Mappers had to create additional products like reference sheets, duct 
bank plans, manhole elevation drawings, pull sheets, and a variety of other draw­
ings to be a able to understand the complex configuration of the underground 
structural system and the relationship of the structures to the electric networks that 
they house. For each new product they developed, they created a new problem of 
having to synchronize all the related data together. The utility might have created, 
printed, copied, and distributed a feeder map on day one, while the utility might 
have created, printed, copied, and distributed the associated manhole card on day 
100. In the meantime, field crews and dispatchers don’t have a consistent picture of 
the exact configuration of the electrical network and the structural support system 
at any given time.

The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
GIS Data Model for Structural Systems
There are three unique types of structural systems: the simple overhead, surface, 
and underground network. The overhead system consists of discrete locations of 
poles. The surface system is a connected network of cabinets, trenches or conduits, 
splice boxes, and customer termination points. The underground network is com­
plex system of rooms, vaults, manholes, splice boxes, and customer termination 
cabinets connected together by duct banks, containing conduits, tunnels, and pipes 
that form a complete underground network. Table 4.6 summarizes the structural 
systems.
The structural system by itself is a network similar to a subway system with 
tunnels and stations or a storm water system with catch basins and piping. If mod­
eled as a network, utility planners can trace the network to discover proposed 
routing of new cables or to determine possible paths and distances through the 
network. Since the purpose of the strurctural network is to contain the current-
carrying equipment, such as cables, switches, and transformers, the data model 
can include the relationships of the electric systems to the structural systems. For 
example, a section of cable is contained within a conduit that is contained within a 
duct bank that connects between two manholes. Another relationship is a surface-
mounted transformer contained within a surface-mounted cabinet that is the ter­
mination of two conduits, which connect to other surface-mounted cabinets. It is 
common for GIS modelers to combine the cabinet with the contained equipment 
as a single feature, yet they are really quite different. A cabinet not only serves as a 
container for the transformer, but also as a slicing and pulling location.
Modelers also often combine underground cable with the containing conduit 
as a single feature, but they are different and from an asset accounting perspec­
tive are two unique assets with different attributes. For true asset management

and asset accounting, utilities should account structural systems separately. Rather 
than combining conduit and cable together (or ignoring the conduit in the model 
entirely), the data model should separately account for the structural element and 
build the spatial relationship between the structural elements and the electrical ele­
ments. Often those relationships are one to many and even many to many. Rarely 
do GISs keep track of exactly which conduit contains exactly what cable. However, 
this information can be critical during a fire in a manhole or a dig in to a duct bank.
Utilities have been more rigorous in the collection of pole information. Many 
utilities build the relationship between pole and electrical equipment. The reason 
for this is probably because poles are more vulnerable to damage.
Summary of the Current State of GIS and the Electric Facilities Model 
This is the current state of the GIS facilities model for electric distribution:
••
Many utitlity GIS implementations consist only of the complete medium-
voltage feeders—precise phase designations are often missing.
••
Structural elements are included where there is medium-voltage equipment.
••
Rarely are underground cables associated with the structural elements that 
contain them.
••
High-voltage to medium-voltage substations are often not managed in the 
GIS—the documentation consists of one-line station schematics and as-built 
design documents, not integrated with the GIS.
••
Low-voltage systems substations (really medium-voltage to low-voltage or 
MV/LV substations) are modeled.
••
Low-voltage networks (including low-voltage services) are not universally 
modeled.
The utility organization structure can sometimes result in fragmented data 
sources for the successful operations and planning for the distribution system. The 
implication is that utilities spend time on data synchronization and harmonization 
with no one system the single source of the distribution infrastructure data or at 
least the single source to be able to access distribution infrastructure data. Since the 
vision of smart grid relies heavily on information and particularly the distribution 
system, a complete electric distribution system GIS will be required.
Cartographic representation of the distribution can be a challenge due to the 
density of the equipment involved and difficulty in representing vertical informa­
tion or essentially three-dimensional data in a two-dimensional form. For example, 
the middle phase of an overhead three-phase feeder is often right on top of the 
pole. The low-voltage circuit is nearly directly under it. So attempting to display 
both the medium-voltage feeder together with the low-voltage circuit or circuits in 
their exact locations is impossible in two dimensions, so modelers have to make 
some cartographic compromise, which usually involves offsetting the medium- or 
low-voltage conductors or accepting that they cannot display both medium and 
low-voltage conductors on the same display. More use of three-dimensional tools 
in the GIS will lessen the need for these cartographic compromises.

Additional Challenges of Distribution System GIS
If things were that easy, they would have done them long ago is a common 
lament. Early mappers and the GIS technicians that followed had to balance two very 
different demands on the map. The first is to make a linear network system 
cartographically pleasing. That meant that the cartographic representation of 
electric distribution lines had to be easy to understand. In the old days before 
computers, mappers created symbols for things like poles. They represented a pole 
as a circle and the mappers tried to locate the pole symbol as close to the same 
location as the pole was in reality. Then the mappers had to create symbols for 
the  overhead wires. This represented a more challenging prospect, since most 
overhead medium-voltage lines consisted of three, sometimes four, wires: the 
three phases and the neutral. The problem was that the three overhead wires are 
separated apart by several feet and the neutral is actually below the three-phase 
conductors. At large scales, the mappers could show each wire in their approximate 
location. However at small scales (higher zoom levels), the wires would be too 
close  together to be able to displayed correctly. At, say, a scale of 1 inch = 1,000 
feet, a distance of 4 ft is 0.004 of an inch on a display (or drawing), so the distance 
between conductors is smaller than the width of a line on a drawing. Map­
pers decided to use a single line to represent all four conductors, since at small 
scales, actual location was impractical. This worked well for a single feeder on 
a pole, but for more than one feeder the mapping problem got more difficult. 
If the mappers wanted to add the low-voltage mains to the drawing and had 
multiple medium-voltage lines, the cartographic problem became difficult. To 
solve this problem, mappers created one set of drawings for medium-voltage at 
one scale and another set for detailed low-voltage maps (if they did this at all). 
As the  network grew in complexity, the maps become more and more difficult to 
manage.
The Problem of Scale
Even though feeders had three and often four actual assets between poles, map­
pers created a one-to-many representation and often were not able to capture the 
exact location of one phase to the other. As mappers added symbols for equipment 
on poles or in manholes, they found that to capture the exact connectivity of the 
equipment, like a switch, lightning arrestor, or low-voltage substation, they had to 
comprise connectivity and asset correctness to be able to represent the equipment 
cartographically so viewers could understand them. If multiple medium-voltage 
equipment was on a single pole, mappers would have to offset many symbols from 
the pole line. 
At the heart of the problem is that many utilities do not take advantage of 
the ability of the GIS to creatively model assets. They continue to use the GIS to 
replicate the same cartography of the old paper mapping systems. Fortunately, this 
is changing rapidly, perhaps by the popularity of tablets and smart phones. Users 
understand that not every display has to contain all the information one will ever 
need. It is the interactive nature of the web, tablets, and smart phones that effec­
tively convey just the right information needed for the task at hand.

The Facility Information Model for Electric Distribution 
103
The Facility Information Model for Electric Distribution
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, the most common and most developed 
use of GIS at an electric utility was for the electric distribution, so at this stage in 
the history of utility GIS, the distribution system is the most mature (compared to 
generation and transmission). It is also the most complex in that it has the most 
number of elements. Updates to the distribution system GIS are done frequently due 
to the number of changes utilities make to the distribution network. Crews replace 
lines and cables, adding new services, fixing problems, and inspecting the system 
every minute of the day.
Facility Model Workflows
The workflows to simply keep the facility GIS current involve simple tasks of­
ten starting with identifying a feature, selecting it, and then doing something with 
it. That involves editing, adding, moving, rotating, deleting, changing the symbol, 
building a relationship of one feature to another, and editing an attribute. A work­
flows for finding equipment is to query by name, draw a box around an area to 
select, trace a feeder to find all the equipment connected, pan and zoom, and then 
count specific features by area, by query, by trace, and by simple selection. These 
tasks are all involved in the simple workflow of maintaining the facility model. 
Figure 4.12 illustrates a web map showing the details of the electric facility model.
Advanced workflows involve performing quality checks on the data, like mak­
ing sure that sections of the feeders are not isolated, testing for connected loops in 
a radial system, or checking for missing relationships like a feeder not connected 
to a pole.

The GIS Electric Distribution Facilities Model
Facility Model Information Products
The final element of the facility information model is the set of information prod­
ucts. These products are just the documentation of the various parts and pieces of 
the network as they currently exist. They do not include other applications that re­
sult in form of analysis. These business-oriented workflows, information products, 
and data models will be described in Chapter 5 and 6. Due to the complexity of the 
distribution system and the various levels of detail required by the utility, the infor­
mation products can be extensive. Utilities will often define output templates that 
describe the scale of the output product (whether printed or displayed), the level 
of detail, the color scheme, the line weights and format, the extent, and any other 
information of interest. Normally, the utility will organize the output products by 
component, such as by substation, by feeder, and by voltage. The GIS functionality 
to create these products involve a query (i.e., find all the elements or features that 
meet a certain criteria), such as find all the medium-voltage conductors belonging 
to feeder ABC. It also adds the query, include all switches that are controlled by 
SCADA. The query could then add more information, such as to include  only MV/
LV substations that are three-phase. Finally, the query could be structured to create 
an output product at 1 in = 400 ft, display pole number for only those poles where 
medium-voltage equipment is located, and show normally open switches in red and 
closed switches in green.
Some examples of typical information products derived just from the facilities 
model are as follows:
••
Overview maps—showing high-level medium-voltage feeders and substation 
location with only feeder tie switches shown. Often, the system displays each 
feeder in a different color. This is probably the smallest scale of all output 
products, zoomed out.
••
Medium-voltage feeder maps—these show the layout of each feeder often 
by itself with all the medium-voltage equipment shown. These would be at a 
larger scale than the overview maps.
••
Medium-voltage feeder switching diagrams—these are schematic representa­
tions of the feeders and are not to scale. These are derived products. They 
often only show main switches.
••
Low-voltage maps—these show the low-voltage circuits at a very large scale 
since the level of detail is quite high. Often they are produced in a map 
book format by defined by standard grid boundaries. These are normally 
highly detailed, showing cadastral data, such as street easements, travelled 
way, building footprints, address ranges, street lights, and other small loads. 
These maps would detail service connections to customers.
••
Secondary network maps—where secondary or mesh networks exist, these 
maps show all the detail of the low-voltage cable connections, along with 
all the cadastral detail of the low-voltage maps. These are essentially special 
cases of the low-voltage maps.
••
Station diagrams—these are the schematic representations of the substations, 
and not built to scale. In the GIS, substations are displayed only in schematic 

The Facilities Model of the Electric Distribution System 
105
form, so these would simply be redisplay of the information contained in the 
GIS.
••
Conduit and duct bank layouts—these represent a set of output products 
that detail the structural network of duct banks and conduit.
••
Manhole, building, and vault layouts—these are layouts of the inside of the 
various electrical rooms that detail exactly the configuration of the conduit 
and duct banks as they enter and exit the buildings, manholes, and vaults.
••
Underground follow sheets—these are geographically correct representa­
tions of the feeders as they traverse the underground conduit and duct bank 
system. These show the route of each of the feeders through the structural 
network.
••
Pole diagrams—separate output products can be produced that show just 
the location of poles, or this information can be conveyed on the low-voltage 
circuit maps.
There are any number of information products that the GIS can produce for 
any combination of features, scales, and representations. Given that utilities are us­
ing mobile devices more and more, they will need to manage the amount of detail 
on a display carefully. In fact, utilities need to work at limiting the amount of detail 
and instead use interactive processes to produce the information they need at the 
time, like the use of pop-ups versus extensive labeling.
The Facilities Model of the Electric Distribution System
The distribution system consists of many parts. To be complete, utilities must ac­
count for and be able to locate each piece and part of the electrical distribution 
network. The focus of this chapter is on how to model the core components of the 
system. The next two chapters will focus on what additional functionality utilities 
can be add to the GIS to leverage this data for operations, infrastructure manage­
ment, and emergency operations.
Where the Facility Model Is Going
The common use of the GIS facility model has been for network documentation. 
Utilities then built more and more applications on this model, adding more and 
data to it. Integration with other corporate systems often meant extracting data 
from one system, transforming the data, and then loading the data into the GIS. 
This of course meant that the data existed in multiple systems. That is not necessary 
anymore. The GIS can serve its facility data in many forms. One form may be as 
a simple map service in which the vast majority of the information is published in 
high-performing cached format for rapid display, yet detailed levels can be accessed 
only when needed.
Modern facility models will migrate to two-/three-dimensional hybrids. Users 
will see conventional maps at small scales, but when zoomed in to large scales, they

see the actual configuration of the conduits or overhead wires. These configura­
tions will be rule based and intelligent. Even though the electric distribution GIS 
facilities model has been around the longest, it will develop and evolve to meet the 
needs of the users, and it will be easier to use, faster, simpler to display, and yet 
much more focused and effective.

Electric Distribution Development and 
Operations
The electric distribution GIS has two very different uses—one for carefully and 
completely managing all the assets owned by the distribution company as outlined 
in Chapter 4 and one that helps utilities make business decisions. This chapter will 
cover how GIS supports the business applications of electric distribution. The most 
difficult part of an electric distribution GIS is the actual building of the facilities 
model. In fact, it is often so difficult and so time consuming that utilities fail to take 
advantage of the GIS to use the facilities model for business applications other than 
to just make maps and keep the data up to date.
GIS Means Business for Electric Distribution
In addition to acting as a network documentation system that feeds data to other 
systems, such as outage management systems or distribution management systems, 
the GIS is a decision support system, enriched by all kinds of information, from the 
results of a business intelligence system to the mashing up of predictive information 
(e.g., the spatial analysis model on transmission risk in Chapter 3). It is one thing 
to know where a certain pole is; it is just as important to know if the pole will fall 
over during a wind storm. 
GIS for the Business
GIS for the business helps answer questions, such as, where is the company spend­
ing too much money on maintenance compared to other areas? Or, where are their 
places that are more vulnerable to salt contamination? Or, where could the company 
violate environmental rules? The key element is location, just as it is in the facilities 
model, but it is the use of the assets within the context of the distribution business 
that is important. The information model for the business GIS can be dependent 
on the connectivity of the network and the detailed relationships of components to 
one another, but it is more dependent on the location of where things happen or 
what relationships exist to business results. Information products are not limited 
to displays or plots of the distribution assets at various scales and colors but would 
include hot spot maps that show areas of highest risk of failure or of vulnerability, 

108 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
or area maps that show where spending is highest or lowest. Here the notion of spa­
tial analytics is more important than detailed network documentation. The network 
documentation serves as one of many data sources used in the analysis. 
Figure 5.1 illustrates the GIS-related workflows for the two types of business 
activities: network documentation and business applications. 
The Two Categories of Business Applications: System Development and 
Operations
There are two major business categories for the electric distribution business: sys­
tem development (building the system) and operations and maintenance (running 
the system). Figure 5.2 details the differences between the workflows for develop­
ment of the operations and maintenance (O&M) of the network.
System development deals with planning for future load growth, assessing 
where the infrastructure needs reinforcing, and engineering solutions for system 
expansion to meet growth or to improve reliability. Using the GIS for system devel­
opment requires designing, and building those solutions. In addition, this activity 
involves meeting the needs of new customers, who require the utility to connect 
them to the electric distribution network. The process of connecting new customers

is a customer care issue as well as an electric distribution business issue, and Chap­
ter 7 will address this from the customer perspective.
Operations deals with the day-to-day activities of maintaining the system. It 
involves assessing the condition and making decisions about whether to replace or 
repair part of the system. If the decision is to replace part of the system, the replace­
ment workflows are part of system development. The operations staff must re­
spond to requests such as providing information to developers, dealing with blown 
street lights, and a number of other tasks. They schedule some of the tasks and 
others are ad hoc. The last section of this chapter will deal with these routine and 
nonemergency situations.
The most important activity of operations, however, is keeping the power on 
at all times. When the power does goes out, the operations people must put it back 
on. Chapter 6 will deal with outage and emergency management 
Electric System Development Using GIS
Smart grid will change the complexion of the distribution network, but utilities 
will incorporate the smart grid initiatives alongside the routine development of the 
network to meet future loads and customer requirements. This section details the 
workflows of the development of the electric distribution system and the role of 
GIS. See Appendix B for a discussion of smart grid and GIS.
The Distribution System Never Stays the Same
The electric distribution system is in a constant state of change. That is because the 
distribution system links directly to end use customers. Customers move around, 
neighborhoods expand and contract, manufacturing plants open and close, and 
population shifts from cities to the suburbs and back again. Since the electric dis­
tribution system must meet the demands of the customer base, the utilities must 
perform a continuous state of assessment as to the adequacy of the distribution 
network, from the HV/MV substations to the low-voltage circuits to meet current 
and future demands.
Development of the electric distribution system has these major work processes:
••
Distribution planning;
••
Engineering, design, and construction;
••
Documenting what has been built.
Distribution Planning
Utilities must perform planning on a regular basis and must look out into the future 
to predict what the loads will be one, two, even five years from today. Once they 
figure out the demands, they then must perform analysis on the electric distribu­
tion system to assess where the network is deficient and create a plan and projects 

110 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
to rectify the deficits. Of course, the planners have to account for and base their 
designs on the network as it is today. Further, they must estimate projects that might 
materialize from situations they do not control. 
Predicting the Future
The key workflow for distribution planning is load forecasting. Load forecasting 
is the art and science of predicting the demand at some time in the future. Utilities 
look at load growth based on average values over the entire service territory (e.g., 
the load for the company will grow 2 percent or shrink 1 percent). Utilities will 
project load growth on a feeder-by-feeder basis. In both cases, the areas are too 
large or distances too long to rely on average values of load growth. 
The load forecasting workflow is a classic example of GIS spatial analysis. The 
spatial analysis relies on spatial data sets, such as the location of businesses and 
data about demographics, zoning overlays, wetland overlays, vacant land, crime, 
migration patterns, income, road construction, and proposed projects. Each one of 
these factors comes from different sources, but each are map based. 
As in the prior examples of transmission risk and siting, taking different data 
sets, converting them to data sets based on a common projection, normalizing the 
scales of the data, then applying a weighting to each of the data sets forms the basis 
for the analysis. Figure 5.3 shows the result in GIS display showing areas of equal 
load growth. 
Within an area of several hundred square miles, it would not be surprising 
to see significant variation of load growth. Planners would run this exercise for 
each year in the study period. Some data might have to be created manually. For 
example, if the government is planning to install a new off ramp from an exist­
ing freeway, planners might create a polygon of larger than normal load growth 
as soon as the contractors complete the off ramp, assuming that service stations, 
fast food restaurants, and other service business may relocate near the freeway 
and the off ramp. That manually created map is just simply an additional layer in 
the model. GIS statistical tools can convert point data to areas of equal growth 
intensity.

The Work Order Process 
111
GIS Can Bring Together Predictive Information from the Source
Many of the factors described earlier form the basis for the information products, 
which are a series of maps or map displays showing areas of equal predicted loads 
for each year. Using GIS, planners build GIS prediction models that access informa­
tion from various sources, often using Web services, rather than having to extract, 
transfer, and load (ETL) and then store the data locally. They can, for example, con­
sume a web service from a conservation commission that displays wetland bound­
aries and buffer zones or flood maps. The advantage is that once the planners build 
the GIS models, they can run the models regularly, thus tuning the forecast as things 
change. For example, if the freeway project is behind schedule, the modelers can 
move the project to the year the highway department completes the project.
So the planners create a load map for today’s load profile, based on the infor­
mation available, scaling it up or down based on the actual peak loads experienced. 
This provides a baseline for analysis. 
The next step is to create a GIS map that displays critical electrical components 
and their current spare capacity. For example, a medium-voltage feeder section 
might have 10 percent spare capacity. Then the planners need to add to the facility 
map any additions and upgrades to the facility network that they know about for 
each year of the study period. 
Finally, the model intersects the projected facility model for each study year 
with the load forecasting model for the same study year. The result is a map that 
highlights those key electrical components that will exceed their ratings. Contrast 
this with a simple load projection by area or by feeder. The GIS-based load fore­
casting model fine-tunes the analysis, by bringing in as much information as is 
known, not just by the utility, but by the entire community, and performs a scien­
tific assessment of where demands will exceed capacity. This analysis will be even 
more critical as customers rely more on electricity for their transportation needs 
and as customers install onsite generation. 
This analysis mixes very different data types, from predictive demographic 
studies that look at age, income, and buying habits to authoritative data such as 
zoning overlays to measured data like present load levels. GIS provides the plat­
form to normalize this data in a systematic, repeatable, and scientific way. Figure 
5.4 shows a GIS map that displays substations that will be overloaded in the study 
year.
Once the distribution planners determine that the company needs to build or 
upgrade a substation, feeder, or some other facility, they create a project to do so. 
The GIS plays a crucial role in that process, often called the work order process.
The Work Order Process
At some point, utilities receive a request for a change in electric facilities. Often 
that request comes from the distribution planners. However, there are many other 
requests that result in a project to develop the system. Someone needs a new service, 
a town needs some poles relocated due to a street widening, or a shopping mall is 
expanding, which requires increasing the capacity of their supplying transformer. 
As a result, someone at the utility has to create a design document that includes 

112 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
the detail of what the utility construction crews have to build, remove, or relocate. 
Often this document is in the form of a hand-drawn sketch or a diagram created 
on CAD system. 
The GIS Design Process
Utilities recognized that involving the GIS prior to the construction of the facilities 
could simplify the entire workflow. If designers created the original design docu­
ments in the GIS, then they or someone else wouldn’t have to re-create the design 
into the GIS after the crews completed the work. Since the people who actually 
created the designs were using map-based information to convey construction de­
tails to the construction crews anyway, using the GIS for the design documents was 
simple to understand.
Utilities get information from load forecasting studies that tell them exactly 
where the network needs to be reinforced due to the projected loading shortfall. As 
a result of these studies, they create projects, such as the following:
••
Reconductoring lines—increasing the cable or conductor size to be able to 
carry the new load;
••
Adding new transformers or low-voltage substations due to the increase in 
more localized load;
••
Reconfiguring circuits to move load from heavier loaded feeders or circuits 
to lower loaded ones;
••
Upgrading older lower-voltage medium-voltage feeders to higher-voltages 
feeders;
••
Adding new breaker sections to substations, thus creating additional feeders;
••
Adding new HV/MV transformers to substations;
••
Adding new substations;
••
Replacing legacy systems;
••
Replacing obsolete equipment;
••
Doing make ready work—that is, working on poles in preparation for new 
facilities, like smart grid cell relays or upgraded medium-voltage feeders;
Figure 5.4  GIS map that illustrates when a substation will be overloaded. (Source: Esri et al.)

The Work Order Process 
113
••
Creating automation projects—such as the addition of remotely controlled 
switches.
In addition to the planning process, there are other actions that trigger projects, 
unrelated to load growth. They are as follows:
••
Customer requests for new service;
••
Reliability of the part of the network falls below standards;
••
Complaints from customers or regulators;
••
Public works project that result in utility relocations;
••
Major repairs due to emergency situations.
All of these actions create projects. The projects involve engineering, design, 
construction, and commissioning. Some projects are large (e.g., the building of a 
new HV/MV substation). Some are small, such as upgrading a single-phase trans­
former. All the projects have these things in common: 
••
Have a spatial dimension;
••
Need detailed information as to what the current state of the electric distri­
bution network is now;
••
Need to create documentation as to what the state of the electric distribution 
will be;

Need to create documentation of what the crews built compared to what the 
engineers and designers had specified to be built. This work product is called 
“as-built” documentation.
Since the GIS describes the facilities model of the electric distribution at a spe­
cific point in time, utilities have seen a need to develop a process that continues 
to keep the facilities model up to date. In other words, they needed a way to take 
the documentation that designers created and incorporate the new designs along 
with any deviations to the design that the crews documented back into the GIS. 
They also needed to make sure that it was kept up to date in an automated and 
controlled way, recognizing that the distribution system will not be static during 
the process of engineering, design, and construction. Dealing with an ever-changing 
network, utilities created a workflow called the long transaction. 
The Long Transaction
The notion of the long transaction goes like this: the utility initiates a project result­
ing from any number of actions listed previously—a new customer connection, a 
reliability upgrade, or a public works project, for example. The distribution util­
ity creates a work order for each of these projects. The utility receives an order to 
do some work (thus, the term work order). Often, the first thing the utility does 

114 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
is assign the project a work order number. From then on, they track all material, 
designs, costs, documents, invoices, and labor charges to this work order. 
Early in the project, the designer needs to capture the current state of the elec­
trical distribution network. In the old days before computers or GIS, the designer 
simply copied the operating map or maps of the area where the new work was go­
ing to take place. Then the designer used the map copies as the basis for the new 
design, documenting things such as which poles to remove, where to install a new 
switch, or where to install a new pole. Once the designer completed the work, the 
project then went on to others for approval, costing, assignment, and eventually 
construction. Sometimes the projects never actually were completed due to things 
such as a customer failed to get project funding, or higher priorities bumped the 
project, or perhaps a recession pushed off the need for additional capacity. 
After the construction crews completed the work, they documented deviations 
from the original design. All of the documentation, from the original designs to the 
marked documents to material order sheets, were often placed in a folder called 
the work order folder. Eventually, the work order folders arrived at the desks of 
the people assigned to update the maps. The time from when the order was placed 
and the designer took the copy of the map to when the work order finally arrived 
at the mapper’s desk could be days, weeks, or even months, depending on how big 
the project was or how slow and how many steps were in the process. The transac­
tion is complete when the drafting people updated the old maps; plant accountants 
update the accounting data, reconcile all material, and close the work order. Un­
like a short transaction, like the updating of a database field or correcting a simple 
error on a paper map, the transaction takes a long time—thus, the term long trans­
action. See Figure 5.5 for a graphic representation of the typical long transaction.
Note that the basis for the design was the original copy of the state of the elec­
tric distribution system captured at the very beginning of the transaction. However, 
since the network is always in a constant state of change, it is entirely possible 
that between the time that the designer took the copy of the network and the time 
the mapping person attempted to update the map, the network data could have 
changed. A car might have struck a pole and a repair crews replaced it with the 
taller one. A switch might have failed and been removed. Someone might have 
discovered that a piece of equipment was in the wrong place. So utilities needed a 
way of reconciling these changes in the area of interest of each design to alert the 
people working on the design that the design basis itself might have changed during 
this progress of the design.

The Work Order Process 
115
GIS Design
To deal with this problem of long transactions, GIS implementations adopted the 
concept of versioning of long transactions. It works like this. The designers cre­
ate the new work directly in the GIS itself. However, they can’t simply update the 
GIS to reflect the new design, since this would eliminate the information about the 
present state of the network. Instead the GIS creates a version of the new design or 
even multiple versions of a new design, which are not disconnected from the as-is 
situation, but are sort of layers of what the network will look like when the crews 
complete the work. Utilities often name the as-is network data set the default ver­
sion. The idea is that as soon as there are changes to the default version, the GIS can 
reconcile the outstanding versions with the changes in the default version. The GIS 
then notifies the in-process work orders there is a change in the design basis. See 
Figure 5.5 for a graphic representation of the typical long transaction.
Given that it takes perhaps several months for a work order to go from design 
to construction, it is entirely likely that something would have changed within the 
area of the work order during that time. The idea is to have the GIS constantly 
notify each outstanding design that something has happened within the area of the 
work order that may have an impact on the design. The implications of not having 
reconciliation is that by the time the crews got the designs, ordered material, and 
scheduled the work, the situation in the field may have changed from when the 
designer first copied the map. That means that the crews would have to either stop 
the project or have to adjust the work in the field based on some new and unfore­
seen situation. Figure 5.6 illustrates the concept of versioning within the GIS.
The final step in the GIS design is that the GIS mappers update the design ver­
sion with the as-built changes and simply post the completed and corrected design 
version back into the default version. The utility then deletes or archives the design 
version.
The GIS Design and Construction Work Flow
The process of GIS design involves the following:
••
Create a linked version of the area of interest of the design—a new version.
••
Perform the new design work in the version.
••
Perform all network analysis and calculations in the version.
••
Continuously reconcile the design version with the default version.
••
Resolve conflicts when there are discrepancies between the design version 
and the default version. For example, if an emergency crew replaced a 35-ft 
pole with the 40-ft pole due to a car accident, the design version would show 
a 35-ft pole, whereas the default version shows a 40-ft pole. The GIS design 
application provides tools to detect these conflicts and allows the users to 
resolve them as soon as a discrepancy is detected.
••
Finally the design version is posted to the default version after all conflicts 
have been resolved.

This process works extremely well for the work on the medium-voltage and 
low-voltage networks, and less so for additions and modifications to HV/MV sub­
station work. Here, due to the complexity of the work involved and the time lines, 
utilities resort to conventional project management techniques. 
Integration with Corporate Systems
Best practices for GIS design of distribution networks involve close integration with 
work management systems. During the engineering and design processes, utilities 
will often directly access work management systems or EAM systems to make sure 
that any new assets they add during a design is accounted for in both systems. Ide­
ally of course, very little duplication of information exists in both systems. In ad­
dition, utilities will track and create work orders within the work management or

EAM system. So a linkage between the two is very helpful, if not essential. The GIS 
can display the extent of the work in a simple polygon in the default version, identi­
fied by a work order number. The EAM manages all other aspects of the work or­
der, such as who initiated it, accounting information, descriptions, dates, and costs. 
Using a GIS design shortens the overall design process, since the utility creates 
the original design only once, rather than having one person create the design and 
then another person re-enter the design features into the GIS after the crews fin­
ished their work.
Compatible Units
Some utilities have adopted the concept of compatible units to help with their dis­
tribution network process. A compatible unit consists of a list of all the material, 
labor costs, miscellaneous tasks such as police details, plant accounting informa­
tion, and often a link to a construction standard. The idea is that designers do not 
have to specify the pieces and parts of design. Instead, they simply specify one or 
more compatible units at a point or between two places. If the utility uses compat­
ible units for design, the GIS design version can show the location of each of the 
compatible units on the map, but the GIS can also access additional data about the 
compatible unit from the EAM or work management system through whatever 
integration framework is in place. 
Longer-Term Projects
Utilities also need to document projects that they know they will design and build in 
the future. They do not need to detail the projects, only account for them at a high 
level for planning purposes. They can create these longer-term conceptual projects 
in GIS versions. This helps to do a better job of load forecasting. While the utility 
will not know the details of the design until later in the process, it helps to have 
the present and future information about the state of the network accessible in one 
place.
Integration with Network Analysis
During the design and longer-term distribution planning process, utilities must per­
form complex network calculations to actually determine the flow of power, short 
circuit issues, and voltage profiles. They also need to understand the extent of the 
losses that exist or will exist in the network. Utilities also need to know quickly 
when they receive a customer request for a new service, whether the network has 
the capacity to serve the customer directly or if they will need to invest in a major 
upgrade of some part of the system. If they need a larger cable or transformer to 
meet the proposed new load, they will need to notify the customer of any additional 
cost or delay that may introduce.
Much of the information needed to run a network analysis is contained within 
the GIS or is accessible by the GIS. So the workflow is for the GIS to export or 
extract that part of the network impacted by the new load. This may be simply 
the low-voltage substation and the low-voltage network, or it could be several 
medium-voltage feeders. The network analysis application extracts the network 

118 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
elements and their connectivity, extracts additional information, such as loads and 
impedances from other systems (smart meters, load estimates from the billing sys­
tem), and calculates the power flow, short circuit, and voltage drops throughout 
the network. Often, the analysis modules present the results directly back into the 
GIS for visualization and dissemination.
Keeping the GIS Up to Date
The simplest workflow to accomplish updating of the GIS facility model is the as-
built process. GIS users receive changes to the network based on the marked up 
maps, memos, emails, phone calls, or notes on scraps of paper showing changes 
or additions to the network. Those changes are a result of all the constant flow 
of projects that occur daily in the distribution network. This documentation indi­
cates what the crews actually constructed in the field. As noted previously, collec­
tively, utilities call this documentation as-built drawings or sketches. The users of 
the GIS simply update the facilities model using standard editing workflows, like 
pan, zoom, add, delete, move, rotate, and view, based on the information on these 
as-built documents. After they make the changes, utilities then publish, plot, or 
display the updated network. 
In addition to simple editing, the GIS provides quality control within the edit­
ing process and often shortcuts to simplify the updating process. For example, the 
GIS would prevent an editor from connecting a medium-voltage cable feeder sec­
tion directly to a low-voltage cable section. 
Many utilities today use the GIS only for updating the facilities model. So the 
GIS in this case is simply a network documentation system (i.e., a system that docu­
ments where the location of the network elements are and provides some informa­
tion about each of the elements, such as size or rating). The GIS used as network 
documentation is not to be trivialized. Many processes within the distribution busi­
ness rely heavily on the information products that result from this process, such as 
those listed in the last chapter. Further, the utilities often extract the data from the 
network documentation system for input to outage management systems, distribu­
tion management systems, and plant accounting systems.
The facility model that the GIS manages, the as-built workflow that keeps it 
current, the workflows that extract data from the GIS, and the resultant informa­
tion products are powerful tools for planning, design, and operations. 
Issues with GIS Design
As noted the electric distribution system is in a constant state of change. Utilities 
add new customers continuously. They replace worn out equipment, extend lines, 
and replace poles struck by errant drives. Overhead electrical systems are constantly 
under attack by the elements. This means that it is a considerable challenge to have 
exact documentation of the electric distribution at any given time. The idea of the 
electric distribution GIS is that it represents the exact state of the assets in the field, 
their condition, and their connectivity. However, many utilities are unable to pro­
cess the transactions in a timely manner. So there may exist a backlog of changes to 
the distribution system that the utility has not posted into the GIS. This may have 

Substation Planning, Design, and Construction 
119
been tolerated during the manual mapping days, but in the smart grid world, hav­
ing unposted work in the GIS could seriously jeopardize the integrity of any smart 
grid operation.
Another issue occurs during the reconciliation process between one version and 
the default version or other versions that exist in the same geographic region. As 
noted earlier, conflicts occur when the existing state of the network changes while 
a work order or orders are still in process. What can happen is that these conflicts 
are not resolved quickly and can pile up over time, resulting in a bottleneck dur­
ing the final posting process after the crews finish the work. The result is that the 
completed work orders are missing from the default GIS. Conflicts then create their 
own backlog. What some utilities insist upon is that when work order areas of in­
terest overlap, the involved parties resolve the conflicts first before they begin the 
design. This involves a meeting. Sometimes the areas of interest can be adjusted so 
they don’t overlap, and sometimes the parties just have to decide to communicate 
their designs to each other. The other option is to opt for feature locking of the 
design. Once designers specify an area of interest, the GIS prevents any feature in 
that area to be modified in any way. Then, if other designers attempt to create a 
version that encroaches on that someone else’s area, they would get notified and 
would have to discuss their plans with the other designer. There are pros and cons 
to each situation. 
False Conflicts
GIS modelers need to be careful not to artificially create conflicts by allowing GIS 
users to update attributes of features indirectly that have little impact on the design 
process. For example, an inspection process may update the date a pole has been 
inspected from one date to another. If, for example, the modeler created an attribute 
of the pole of date inspected, the attribute of the pole would have changed during 
the design process. During reconciliation, a conflict could occur that states that the 
pole has changed since the designer created the version. However, this conflict does 
not impact the designer’s work and could hold up the work or cause needless extra 
work. So modelers must take care not to create conflicts that do not impact the de­
sign process. The key to conflict resolution is to prevent the possibility of conflicts 
in the first place by good communication among the parties engaged in updating 
the data.
Substation Planning, Design, and Construction
Once the distribution planners have completed the long-term load forecasting, dis­
tribution engineers assess the need for additional equipment. Sometimes the need 
is so great within an area that the solution is to build a new HV/MV substation or 
significantly add new equipment to an existing substation.
The process for siting a new substation involves finding the right blend of tech­
nical, environmental, social, and financial conditions. It’s not enough to say that 
new substation needs be built in this or that location. Siting a complex structure 

120 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
like a substation involves community involvement, permitting, land acquisition, 
transmission extension, land suitability, impact analysis, and logistics. Most of the 
factors have a spatial dimension. 
The general process is as follows:
••
Gather the data.
••
Perform spatial analysis on the data to provide a number of alternatives.
••
Select the best several options.
••
Present those options to interested parties in a way that is easy to understand.
••
Prepare to adjust.
Utilities will need to gather all kinds of data, both spatial and nonspatial, from 
a variety of sources. Key data sources include the latest flood studies of the region, 
high crime areas, and environmental and aesthetic concerns. Since GIS can con­
sume data from different sources and from different organizations, the ideal way to 
gather the data is to access the data at the source. For example, rather than obtain 
a collection of hard-copy maps from conservation commissions, municipalities, 
and police departments, it would be better to access the data through some kind of 
service, like a web service that is up to date, each time the data is accessed. Figure 
5.7 illustrates the substation planning process using GIS.
Zoning and master plan digital maps from the government can help show the 
future landscape of any proposed area. The idea is to collect as much relevant data 
as possible and build a model that processes that data into a single map using the 
tools of GIS to discover the best locations for the substation, given all the variables 
and constraints.
Once the planners and the community have agreed to the substation location, 
the unity can develop the detailed engineering and design documents and then 
actually build the substation using the GIS to facilitate the logistics, the construc­
tion, the environmental monitoring, and the final commissioning. Once the utility

completes and energizes the substation, they can incorporate the one-line diagram 
into the GIS.
The Information Model of the Electric Distribution Infrastructure Development
Recall that the information model includes the workflows, the information prod­
ucts, and the data model. The workflows consist of the planning, the as-built pro­
cess, and the GIS design process. The information products of the planning are the 
maps of the load studies, the areas of equal load growth, and the maps that detail 
where the distribution network will need reenforcement. The information products 
of the as-built process are those described in Chapter 4. 
The information products for GIS design consists of the documentation of 
what the contractor or construction crews need to do to perform their work as the 
designer had specified. If the utility uses compatible units, the designers will include 
those units on the map display at their location. Utilities will include items like the 
bill of material (list of parts) for the work involved and often the cost of the work 
directly on the work order design. 
Some utilities call these construction documents staking sheets. Utilities often 
perform the design in the field and during that design process, the designers would 
actually drive stakes in the ground to illustrate where they wanted the crews to in­
stall the equipment—thus, the name staking sheets. Other utilities call these docu­
ments work order designs or work order sketches. Regardless of the name, they 
are maps that show what work the electric construction crews need to perform to 
complete the work.
Today, for work in the field, mobile devices are becoming the tools of choice 
(versus paper maps). This allows the crews to use the mobile device to communi­
cate changes to the designs. The workflow would be to deliver the designs to the 
crews to their mobile devices and for the crews to communicate any deviations to 
the office so that when the designers post the new design to the default version 
(or as-is version), they would easily see the deviations. The trend is that the com­
munication from the field to the office is performed through wireless connectivity, 
sometimes using cloud computing as the broker to manage these services. Typically, 
the crews would indicate a correction or as-built change in the form of a redline 
change, not a direct correction to the design. Figure 5.8 shows a typical informa­
tion product from a GIS design.
The data model for the infrastructure management process is an extension of 
the facilities model. Depending upon the architecture, the data can be included 
within the facility model or can be outside the data model and integrated with the 
facility model whenever needed. 
Typically load forecasting data models consist of simply the services needed for 
the analysis, such as demographics, environmental overlays, and other information 
not typically under the control of the utility. 
For the GIS design, modelers would design the system to access data from the 
EAM systems, such as compatible units. The facility data model would then be 
supplemented by the location of the compatible unit. However, the detail of the 
compatible unit would be accessed from the EAM, not stored directly in the GIS.

Electric Distribution Development and Operations
Summary of the Role of GIS in Electric Distribution Infrastructure 
Development
As noted in Chapter 4, the electric distribution consists of a large number of facili­
ties, current-carrying and structural equipment, and of course customers. Utilities 
must know the location and relationships of this equipment to meet their mission. 
The better they know the state of their system, the more effective they will be. His­
torically, this has been a challenge for electric distribution companies. The process 
of keeping this data current can be daunting. 
The workflow of designing a change to the distribution system to actually 
building it and tracking all the steps in between is the work order process. It in­
volves starting with a solid understanding of the present state of the network as 
documented in the GIS, then continues with the documentation from the GIS of 
what will be altered (new transformers, poles, wires), communicating that infor­
mation to many players in the company for approval, ordering material, and col­
lecting payment. Then the utility must communicate those requirements created in 
the GIS to people who actually do the work. Those people can be utility crews or 
contractors. Once the work is completed, the crews document that the work has 
been accomplished and they indicate what if any deviations they may have made. 
They document those deviations in the form of as-built comments or symbols. The 
utility then updates the new work and any deviations from the design back into the 
GIS. The GIS then reflects the new work. 
Requests for new additions can come from a variety of sources: the planning 
group, new customer requests, the asset management group, and outside parties 
like cities and towns who need the utility to relocate their facilities. 
Utilities capitalize the work associated with the process. That means that regu­
lators allow utilities to amortize all of the costs of performing any aspect of this 
work over a period of time. This is because the end result of the work is an increase 
in the overall capital assets of the utility. That would include the labor cost of a GIS 
technician incorporating as-built sketches into the GIS.

Nonemergency Business Operations and Maintenance 
123
At any given time, the GIS represents the best source of what exactly exists in 
the electric distribution system if the utility is diligent in capturing all the assets in a 
timely way. This facilities model of the distribution system is essential for nearly ev­
ery business application of system development. Knowing exactly the current state 
of the distribution system is critical for the operations as well. The most critical 
operations, of course, is dealing with power failures during emergencies. Chapter 6 
is devoted entirely to emergencies. The following sections deal with nonemergency, 
but important, business situations of operations (i.e., running the system on a day-
to-day basis).
Nonemergency Business Operations and Maintenance
The first part of this chapter dealt with the process of growing the electric distribu­
tion network, which is the capital work (or expenses related to capital work) of 
the distribution system. The following sections deal with how GIS supports the 
nonemergency daily O&M of the electric distribution network. 
Maintenance
Of course, every utility must keep its equipment in good working order, so they 
have extensive maintenance programs. Since the distribution network has so much 
equipment distributed over such a wide area, it is a challenge. Utilities fix things 
in one location; other equipment fails somewhere else. Generally, when a piece of 
distribution equipment fails, customers experience an outage. So, the time and ef­
fort spent on maintenance often pays off in better reliability. However, since there 
is so much equipment and finite resources, utilities always have to choose what 
facilities to maintain and when and how often. In the past, utilities performed most 
maintenance on a scheduled basis, just like most people maintain their automobile. 
They change the oil every 3000 miles or three months, regardless of the duty on 
their vehicle.
However, utilities today generally maintain equipment on the basis of reliabil­
ity impact. So utilities implement reliability centered maintenance (RCM). For ex­
ample, the utility looks at more than just the last time they maintained a piece of 
equipment. They look at how often they operated the equipment, the conditions, 
the past performance of similar equipment, and a host of other variables. This 
helps them fine-tune the time when they need to service the equipment. Ideally, they 
will put off the maintenance longer, based on the results of the RCM algorithms. 
GIS provides an additional framework for RCM work, adding spatial analytics to 
the solution. So, for example, RCM may determine that the utility needs to main­
tain a piece of equipment. However, a spatial analysis shows salt contamination 
of that equipment due to its proximity to the ocean and a three-month history of 
winds blowing in from the water. So GIS spatial analysis supplements RCM. The 
GIS can also display the results of the maintenance process for visualization and 
dissemination. 
Maintenance activities include the following:

124 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
••
Asset management—this is the study of whether to replace the asset (creat­
ing a capital project) or repair the asset. Age, failure history, cost of repair, 
location, and condition are key elements of the analysis. The GIS provides 
the data management framework from the facilities model (Chapter 4) to be 
able to organize the work and to supplement asset management with some 
spatial analysis. 
••
Inspection—this is the capture of condition information. The GIS provides 
the guidance to organize where the inspections should occur. Often the GIS 
is used to collect the condition data and provide a means of updating where 
the condition data actually goes. Some utilities prefer to keep condition data 
directly in the GIS; others move the data into their EAM systems. In either 
case, condition data is critical to asset management, so the asset management 
analysis must have ready access to this data. Ideally, EAM and GIS are well 
integrated, so the users never need to know where the data is actually stored.
••
Testing—testing and inspection often go together. The results of the test de­
termine the condition of the equipment. 
••
Repair—is really a form of maintenance. If a handle is bent or a door or 
access panel is missing a part, the maintenance person repairs the problem.
••
Replacement—when the field workers determine that a part is beyond repair, 
they will replace the part. If the equipment is a major, the field worker cre­
ates a work order and generates a capital project. If the replacement is minor, 
like a blown out lamp on an indicator panel or a rusted out cover, the field 
worker replaces the equipment directly. 
Substation Maintenance
Substation maintenance involves the same activities as network maintenance except 
that much of the equipment is not directly modeled in the GIS or not tied to specific 
equipment that is modeled in the GIS. For example, utilities need to maintain sub­
station batteries. Substation batteries are not modeled in the GIS, since they are not 
linked directly to any one current-carrying device but are critical for the operation 
of a substation. 
There are two ways to deal with this. The substation building structure itself of 
course can be modeled in the GIS as a polygon feature. Then the GIS modeler can 
create a relationship to nongraphic features called substation batteries. The condi­
tion data and maintenance information would be stored in the EAM, but a spatial 
query could expose the location of the substation battery equipment within the 
specific substation. The other way is to create a specific feature within the 
boundary of the substation polygon of a station battery probably as a simple point 
feature. Then the specific batteries can be identified directly. The same process 
could be used for annunciators and other substation equipment not specific to a 
particular transformer or breaker. Other substation features, not specific to the 
electric operations, like doors, buildings, pumps, heaters, and lights, are best mod­
eled as a building information model and dealt with like other buildings the utility 
operates.

Nonemergency Business Operations and Maintenance 
125
Special Maintenance Activities
GIS provides the means to organize the work of maintenance, because the GIS helps 
utilities identify the priorities of maintenance activities. It shows where the field 
crews need to do the work. It shows where they have done the work and collects 
the condition of the equipment. Two additional maintenance activities require more 
discussion and have different impacts: vegetation management or tree trimming and 
street light management.
Tree Trimming
Like transmission companies, distribution companies that operate overhead lines 
pay constant attention to the condition of trees that are in close proximity to their 
lines. The best way to mitigate some of the risks associated with trees falling on 
wires is to regularly trim tree branches around the distribution lines. There are two 
types of tree trimming work: programmatic and corrective. Utilities schedule tree 
trimming activities on individual feeders, often based on a programmed cycle. For 
example, utilities will schedule specific feeders to have tree trimming once every 
three, four, or five years. During outages or for construction activity, utilities trim 
trees on an unscheduled basis often called corrective tree trimming. In many, if not 
most, cases, utilities contract tree trimming to specialists.
While distribution organizations often manage tree trimming, regularly shared 
services groups manage the overall vegetation management activities. Additional 
discussions of vegetation management is covered in Chapter 8.
The output product for tree trimming are GIS maps showing trimming work 
polygons, with imagery of the area to be managed, coded with the results of the 
spatial analysis showing greater or less need, work sequence, budgeted versus ac­
tual cost of the work, progress of the work, and specific tree hazards in the area. 
Work crews can directly enter their data into the GIS using a mobile device along 
with photos showing the quality of the work performed. The utility botanist can 
manage a greater number of contractors and work areas by accumulating the field 
data in the GIS, can see the progress of the work, and track the overall costs and be 
alerted to any unusual situations that may require additional funding.
The planning and execution of tree trimming can be significantly tuned to low­
er the overall costs and improve the effectiveness with the use of GIS. Figure 5.9 
shows tree trimming work in GIS.
Street Light Management
Not all utilities own and operate street light systems. In some cities, like Boston, 
the power company owns some, the city owns some, and the park district owns 
others. Even customers own some of the lights. Many regulators of utilities require 
that utilities repair street lights within a fixed period of time from when customers 
notified them of a street light complaint. Most often the repair is a simple replace­
ment of the lamp. 
The process is that someone reports that a street light is dark. The utility must 
verify that the street light is in fact one of theirs, exactly where it is, and what type 
of fixture and lamp it is. Then they must record exactly when the report was made 

126 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
(for regulatory reporting), and then they must dispatch a crew to the location to 
fix the street light.
As part of the facilities model, utilities capture the street light location and its 
characteristics (whether directly in the GIS or accessed from another system) within 
the GIS. When a utility receives a report of a street light out, they can determine 
the location exactly, determine if in fact they are responsible for the repair, make 
sure the repair person has the right replacement parts, organize all the work nearby 
to optimize the work, then make the repair, and finally report exactly when they 
made the repair. 
Many utilities offer a GIS-based online or mobile app for reporting of a street 
light outage. Using GIS, the person making the report can easily identify which 
light is out and the utility can automatically determine the ownership and respon­
sibility for the repair. In fact, the app can route the repair order immediately to 
the lamp repair person directly. In a non-GIS-centric street light repair scenario, 
the utility will often ask (online or over the phone) what the pole number is of the 
street light in question. Since in the vast majority of cases, the report of street light 
outage occurs at night, and with the street light out, it is probably too dark for the 
customer to read the pole number. If instead, the customer could simply click on 
the street light location in the GIS, enabled in the smart phone, they specify the 
exact location, without having to know the pole number. They can also add other 
data, like damage to the pole or to the street fixture. 
A self-service-driven GIS-enabled street light application shortens the entire 
process of reporting, checking records, dispatching, and repairing the lamp. Other 
than the actual replacement of the lamp, the GIS entirely automates the process. 
See Figure 5.10 for an example of GIS-enabled street light application.
Utilities can also take the street light outage reports and use them in conjunc­
tion with crime statistics to help law enforcement correlate frequent street light

outages with crime activity. Rapid repair of street lights in high crime areas can 
provide a significant community benefit.
Nonemergency Operations
In addition to power failures, utilities have to main adequate levels of power qual­
ity. This involves avoiding flicker, high and low voltage, excesses losses, and mo­
mentary interruptions. Utilities can help mitigate these issues by identifying the 
sources and measuring the results. 
For example, flicker, or the rapid changing of voltage, which causes notice­
able changes in the lighting (that is, “the lights are flickering”) is often caused by 
specific kinds of loads, particularly arc-welders. The GIS can identify where these 
offending loads are and then craft solutions to mitigate their impacts. 
Voltage variations are usually a result of operational situations that have 
changed since the initial design of some portion of the network. For example, if 
customers connected to a particular transformer and secondary main over the years 
have increased their loads significantly, then they are apt to experience low voltage. 
Customers adding additional air conditioning, high-definition TVs, or extra refrig­
erators, could drive the voltage lower than what the system can handle. Should the 
customer add an electric vehicle charger, that might well create a low-voltage situ­
ation, particularly if the customer is at the end of a secondary main. 
Momentary Outages Are Annoying
Momentary outages occur during switching events and during power failure resto­
ration events. The common medium-voltage recloser is a circuit breaker that when 
it senses a fault condition, (i.e., when it senses that the current exceeds normal 
Figure 5.10  GIS-enabled street light application. (Source: Esri et al.)

128 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
values, most often during a short-circuit situation), it trips the breaker, causing a 
power failure. However, a timer in the recloser closes the breaker allowing current 
to flow again after a short interval. If the recloser senses high current again, it opens 
again and stays open. It could also be set to perform this open and closing several 
times. The idea is that if a tree limb falls across a line or a squirrel’s tail shorts across 
a transformer’s bushing, the short circuit current occurs only for a short period of 
time. After the fault, the tree limb or dead squirrel falls to the ground. When the 
reclosers closes back in, if the source of the fault is gone, the recloser restores the 
power and customers do not experience a lengthy power failure. 
All this is positive, except that this opening and closing of switches creates a 
momentary outage, which could create problems for customers. Digital clocks stop 
working. Maybe computers lose files or the situation causes data corruption. As 
networks get smarter, these momentary outages in fact may become more frequent. 
As noted in Appendix B, smart grid provides this concept of self-healing, which 
means that the electric network will attempt to configure itself to minimize total 
customer outage time. In effect, total outage duration will drop, but the number of 
momentary outages might actually increase.
Nonetheless, utilities have to manage power quality issues. They do this by 
monitoring and measuring what goes on in the network. Utilities measure the total 
impact on their system of momentary outages using a metric called momentary 
average interruption frequency index (MAIFI). The definition of a momentary out­
age is somewhat vague and varies around the world. It is a measure of outages that 
lasts for less than a minute. Some utilities use 5 minutes. The calculation is the total 
number of times a momentary outage occurs during a calendar year divided by the 
total number of customers served in that area. In effect, it is the measure of how 
many times per year the average customer experiences this kind of disturbance, 
regardless of the cause. The cause could be lightning, switching, or reclosing. If the 
momentary outage is the result of a planned event, like the cutting over of one line 
to another, the utility will not include that event in the MAIFI calculation, even 
though the customer may not know the difference.
Often utilities report a single MAIFI number for their entire service territory. 
A typical MAIFI in the southeastern U.S. is around 10. The problem with that 
number is that it averages over such a wide area. Using GIS, utilities can plot mo­
mentary outages over a much smaller resolution of service territory. So while the 
average of MAIFI might be 10, there may be areas of MAIFI of 1 or 0 and another 
of 100. Utilities can use GIS to continuously monitor MAIFI and be able to uncover 
where their areas of poor power quality lie. Then they could analyze the areas 
more closely to determine if tree trimming needs to be increased (or decreased) or 
whether they need to examine the types of loads, like sensitive manufacturing, to 
help customers deal with annoying power quality events. GIS not only provides a 
visualization of the problem, in other words, shows where the problems are most 
severe, but allows utilities to correlate the problem in a more effective way. Figure 
5.11 shows MAIFI on a GIS map by zip code.
Transformer Load Management
Utilities rarely measure the loading on distribution transformers. So today, the 
biggest mystery of the electric distribution network is the past, current, and future 

Nonemergency Business Operations and Maintenance

projected loads on distribution transformers. The result of this lack of knowledge 
is unexpected failures of distribution transformers particularly during periods of 
heavy demand. This can be particularly problematic during hot and humid evenings 
when crews are off shift. Customers are out of power for long periods of time with­
out air conditioning. 
Without smart meters, utilities have to estimate the load on each distribution 
transformer during a projected heavy load period. Short of monitoring the loads 
on the transformers in real time, the utilities do not have an effective means of cal­
culating coincident peak loads. They have to take billing data from the customer 
information system and apply some sort of estimated load pattern to the billing 
data to estimate the peak load. They then have to determine the coincident demand 
of all the customers connected to the same transformer. 
Smart meters and GIS solve this problem. With smart meters, utilities can de­
termine the exact customer load at every time interval in the day. If the utility 
created a good low-voltage model in the GIS or at least linked customers to the 
transformers in the GIS, then the utility can calculate the total coincident loading 
for each of its transformers for each interval that the utility measures consumption. 
They will then know which transformers have experienced excessive loading and 
which have experienced loss of life. The GIS can display which transformers are 
vulnerable to failure. 
Utilities rarely monitor each smart meter in real time. Smart meters will typi­
cally store interval consumption data, typically from 5 to 15 minutes and then 
transmit the data several times during the day. So while the utilities will not know 
exactly when a transformer is overloaded in real time, they will be able to know 
exactly what the transformers experienced several hours later or at worst, the next 
day. In the past, they would have no knowledge of transformer coincident loading. 
When utilities project the load to increase, they will know which transformers 
are most likely to fail and take action to mitigate that failure. They can use GIS to 
determine which transformers to upgrade or which areas of the network to apply 
load management or demand response to. Rather than shedding load unilaterally, 
Figure 5.11  GIS map showing MAIFI by zip code. (Source: Esri et al.)

130 
������������������������������������������������
Electric Distribution Development and Operations
utilities could shed load to only those areas that are at risk of losing a distribution 
transformer. This might mean a tradeoff of a 15-minute outage for an extended 
outage to replace a failed transformer during a particularly busy time.
This illustrates how GIS helps utilities narrow the problem down to smaller 
areas to help prioritize issues to avoid problems in the future.
Call Before You Dig
Most jurisdictions require utilities to participate in a program variously called “call 
before you dig,” “dig safe,” and “safe dig.” An agency within a state, a region, a 
province, or a country coordinates all digging within the jurisdiction. In the U.S., 
each state has such an agency. The rule is that if anyone—a contractor, a home 
owner, a utility, or the municipality—needs to dig a hole, they must first notify the 
call before you dig agency of their intention to dig and precisely locate where the 
dig is to occur. 
The workflow is a utility receives a request from the call before you dig agency 
and determines if they have underground facilities in the area. Then, if they do, 
they must mark the area where their facilities are located and notify the agency 
that there is an underground facility that they have successfuly marked in the field.
Some utilities set up a self-service system in which the call before you dig agen­
cy can directly query the GIS. Then, if the query results in a discovery of an un­
derground facility, the GIS creates the marking work order, which includes a GIS 
display of the facilities as part of the work order. The GIS-based work order auto­
matically delivers the information to the field personal on a laptop or mobile device 
with details on where to mark. Once complete, the field technician completes the 
work order in the field on the mobile GIS device, closes the work order, and notifies 
the agency. The information products are the original request, the map showing the 
request, and the discovered underground facilities. The self-service process closes 
the work order immediately if there are no underground facilities in the area.
Third-Party Attachment/Use Management
Entities such as wireline, wireless, cable, and fiber-optics companies regularly use 
electric company structures such as poles, towers, and even buildings for their 
equipment. Municipal fire departments often attach fire alarm equipment and ca­
bles to electric poles. It is not uncommon that over time, utilities that own the poles 
lose track of exactly what equipment other companies have attached to their poles. 
Utilities almost exclusively use GIS to document these third-party attachments 
and manage a workflow to calculate the various attachment fees. Utilities can use 
GIS to facilitate the collection of these attachments should the utility wish to per­
form a full audit. Some utilities find that the lost revenue from collection of these 
third-party attachment fees is substantial. The information product consists of a 
simple map illustrating the electrical feature, like the poles with symbology of the 
various attachment types shown. GIS can perform a simple count analysis for each 
region identified on the map. For example, the GIS can determine the number of 
fire alarm boxes within a town boundary and the length of the fire alarm circuit. 
They can display this as a table or chart on the map, and they could update the 
display whenever a third party adds, edits, or removes an attachment.

GIS Used in Electric Distribution Development and Operations 
131
It is also not uncommon for utilities to lease space within their electrical duct 
bank system. As detailed in Chapter 4, many utilities have built underground net­
works of duct banks, manholes, and conduits traveling up and down the city streets 
and into and out of all the basements of all the buildings in the city. If the utility has 
unused pipes, it can lease the space to other companies, like fiber or cable compa­
nies. The GIS is the most common tool to manage these cable locations and be part 
of the workflow to render bills to companies leasing the ducts. 
Another important consideration is that the utility may have to notify the third 
party should damage occur. If, for example, an electrical cable faults in a manhole 
causing a fire to erupt, the utility will need to know not only which electrical equip­
ment may be damaged, but also what third-party equipment may be damaged. The 
GIS provides this if there is a good process to keep this data updated. 
GIS Used in Electric Distribution Development and Operations
Electric distribution departments were the first to embrace the notion of digital 
mapping, mainly to solve the messy process of constantly updating their distribu­
tion operations maps. Many built digital mapping systems that solved only the map 
production process. Over time, utilities realized that the information they main­
tained in their GIS had enormous value for more than just creating clearer and 
easier-to-produce maps.
They realized that they could use GIS technology to better plan for the devel­
opment of their electric distribution network by fine-tuning the process of load 
forecasting. They could use GIS to actually design the network itself and communi­
cate the designs to the construction crews and contractors. They could use the GIS 
to manage street lights, call before you dig requests, third-party attachment and 
power quality issues, transformer loadings, and smart grid deployments. 
In many parts of the world, falling trees and tree branches cause many of the 
outages on the distribution system. Often the cost of tree trimming is the third 
largest expense behind labor and material for a distribution utility department. 
The GIS can organize and analyze the work to optimize tree trimming activities by 
bringing in relevant data (like historic rainfall) from outside the company and com­
bining the data with information within the utility to produce a more intelligent 
and cost-effective plan. 
Finally, the GIS is essential to mitigate the risk of failure, help ready the system 
for weather events, help in the restoration of power, and provide assistance in the 
rebuilding of the network after a major outage event. Chapter 6 will cover this in 
detail.

Emergency and Outage Management
Emergency Management
An electric utility’s primary mission is to keep the lights on at all times. So when the 
lights do go out, a utility’s single most important activity is to get the lights back on 
as quickly as possible. Society rates how good an electric utility is by how reliable 
it is. So, whenever there is an unexpected or unscheduled power outage, utilities 
execute a workflow to find out what caused the problem, assess the damage, and fix 
the problem. Utilities have been doing this since the day Edison turned the switch 
on Pearl Street Station in New York City more than a century ago. Of course, loca­
tion and mapping play a critical role in the workflow of doing just that.
There are two types of power failures that result in two very different respons­
es: the major emergency and the routine outage. The difference is stark. There is 
no real hard and fast rule that differentiates a major emergency outage from the 
routine, but generally if the majority of customers served by a utility are out of 
power, that is a major emergency outage. While a large power failure is an emer­
gency, if the existing utility staff can restore the outage using standard processes, 
then utilities consider this routine. The media may report the outage, but once they 
do, most people not out of power quickly forget about it. Most power failures are 
routine and for many utilities occur every day. The restoration process is fairly 
predictable. However, the quality of performance of utilities to manage this process 
varies widely. Accurate information, timely communication, and a high degree of 
collaboration of all parties involved often determines how well a utility deals with 
power failures. 
GIS plays a major role in a managing the information about the location, char­
acteristics, and condition of the utility assets, and provides a framework for com­
municating the state of the electric network. It also provides an effective way of 
getting all workers on the same page—in other words, of facilitating communica­
tion. After all, every utility uses maps to pin-point places where problems exist. 
However, unlike in the old days, when people pinned hard-copy maps to a wall, 
GIS delivers the map and the events electronically to everyone in the company on 
whatever digital device the workers happen to have. Of course, that’s the ideal. 
Today many utilities still use old processes to deal with outages. Figure 6.1 shows 
the differences between major outages and routine events.

Emergency and Outage Management
How Well Does the Utility Manage Its Reliability?
Utilities have come up with standard ways of measuring reliability. Nearly every 
utility measures the total accumulated time that an average customer is out of 
power over a year. The industry uses the term system average interruption duration 
index (SAIDI) as a way of comparing reliability peformance of electric utilities.
SAIDI equals the total number of minutes of power outage experienced for 
every customer for the year divided by the total number of customers.
If a 100,000-customer utility experienced 12,000,000 minutes of total cus­
tomer outage, SAIDI would be 12,000,000 divided by 100,000, or 120 minutes. Of 
course, of those 100,000 customers, perhaps only a fraction actually experienced 
any power failures at all, while some may experience many hours of power outage 
many times. So SAIDI may not resonate with customers, since it is just an average. 
In the U.S., 120 minutes or 2 hours is about the average of all utilities. This value 
varies widely around the world. In parts of the world, SAIDI is below a minute. In 
other areas, SAIDI can be multiple hours, days, or even longer. Despite its flaws, 
SAIDI is a good indicator of how well a utility operates and its commitment to a 
culture of restoration. It would not be uncommon to find SAIDI as a key perfor­
mance metric at the highest levels of management in a utility company.
SAIDI doesn’t tell the whole story of response to emergency or routine outages. 
Often the calculation of SAIDI excludes some events, like major storms or other 
natural disasters. Some utilities exclude outages lasting less than 5 minutes in the 
calculation, since they include these short outages in the calculation of MAIFI (see 
Chapter 5). Some utilities report SAIDI with and without abnormally large events. 
There is no standard measure of outages for those events excluded in the calcu­
lation of SAIDI, although the Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 
has developed a metric to measure these abnormal or nonroutine events [1]. 
Other Reliability Measures
SAIDI measures the total accumulated time of an average customer to be out of 
power during the year. System average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) mea­
sures the number of times an average customer is out of power. Like SAIDI, SAIFI 
probably wouldn’t resonate with any customer.

How Well Does the Utility Manage Its Reliability? 
135
SAIFI equals the total number of power failure occurrences over a year divided 
by the total number of customers.
Like SAIDI, the calculation of SAIFI often excludes major storm events and 
outages that last less than five minutes. An additional metric is customer average 
interruption duration index (CAIDI), which calculates how long on average a cus­
tomer experiences an outage. 
CAIDI equals the SAIDI divided by the SAIFI.
Since CAIDI is a derived metric, it is less frequently used. Thus, the major met­
rics for reliability are SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI. 
Reliability and GIS
Aside from the varying ways utilities measure SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI and what 
they include or do not include, they are averages and are not particularly good 
proxies for what customers actually experience. Utilities have attempted to get a 
better handle on the values by assigning these metrics to individual medium-voltage 
feeders. In this way, they can determine which feeders are more reliable. However, 
higher-voltage medium-voltage feeders can be quite long and cover vast areas, so 
this practice might still not be a good indication of how customers feel about out­
ages. In addition, unless utilities are able to associate customers to feeders at all 
times, they won’t be able to determine an accurate reliability ranking for feeders. 
During outages, for example, utilities will regularly configure sections of feeders 
to provide alternate paths. More utilities will implement automated self-healing 
processes, which will involve automated switching of remotely controlled switches 
during outages or periods of heavy loading. This means that any number of feeders 
in all kinds of configurations may supply customers. Thus, customers assigned to 
specific feeders will become less common. The notion of self-healing is a character­
istic of smart grid.
GIS, coupled with smart meters, provide a fuller picture of the customer experi­
ence of reliability than simply relying on system averages. With smart meters, utili­
ties know exactly when customers lose power and when the utility restores power. 
During a single event, for example, a customer may experience several periods of 
power outage. Utilities would know precisely the duration of any single event; thus, 
their calculation of MAIFI and SAIFI would be completely consistent. Without 
smart meters, utilities cannot accurately represent every instance of a power failure. 
Since GIS knows the location of every customer, it can simply map areas of reli­
ability. It can map by block, zip plus four, or any other spatial grouping. The util­
ity can then use the commonly used terms like SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI but base 
the results on much smaller areas. Then the utility can use the areas of high SAIDI 
(high is bad) and intersect those areas with the distribution infrastructure within 
that area. In this case, the utility would expect to see wide variations from one area 
to the next and be able to fine-tune their reliability program to areas rather than to 
long medium voltage distribution feeders or substation regions. Further, the utility 
could better understand the underlying causes of why exactly one area is more reli­
able than another. With that information in hand, the utility could craft a reliability 
program that focuses on the very worse areas. 
Using spatial analysis, the utility can correlate voltage levels, equipment age, 
types of vegetation, weather, and tree-trimming history to discover the underlying 

136 
�������������������������������
Emergency and Outage Management
cause of the reliability issues. They may want to obtain additional information, 
such as motor vehicle accidents or winding roads in the area, or that this neighbor­
hood is at the end of a long feeder or is subjected to salt contamination or a variety 
of factors that could answer the question of why the reliability is so bad in this 
area. The GIS would be able to illustrate the average interruption frequency and 
duration over a relatively small area compared to averages over the entire service 
territory. Figure 6.2 shows a GIS map with SAIDI rankings by zip code.
In addition to providing accurate network data, the GIS can help focus the util­
ity on where it needs to improve.
Risk Profiling 
There are many elements of risk for the distribution business: the risk of overspend­
ing, of employees getting hurt, or of damaging the environment by having oil-filled 
equipment rupture. Perhaps the most common kind of risk for an electric distribu­
tion business is the risk of equipment failure creating a power failure. While utilities 
cannot control the weather or earthquakes or wildfires, utilities can determine their 
vulnerability to these risks. This section will create one of the illustrations of the 
power of GIS spatial analysis to determine the risk profile of a distribution network 
to failure and of power loss.
There are two elements of risk:
••
The likelihood of the failure itself;
••
The consequences of the failure. 
Together they determine the relative risk. For example, the likelihood of an 
overhead line being taking down by a falling tree branch depends on whether the

Risk Profiling  
137
line is near a tree, the type of tree, when the nearby tree was last trimmed, and 
how likely the area is subject to severe weather. It also depends on how strong the 
wire is, the type of construction, and a host of other factors. The consequences of 
the damage depends on whether the section of line is at the end of a long feeder 
or at the beginning, or if the feeder supplies critical load and if the area is easy to 
get to or on the wrong side of washed out bridge on an island, for example. Other 
consequences can be revenue lost, or a large outage possibly caused by damage to 
the feeder. Perhaps the damaged feeder has had a number of prior failures; the util­
ity may consider that section a high-risk section. If the feeder supplies prominent 
members of the community, the loss of that feeder section could have political con­
sequences. What if the feeder supplies power to a hockey rink during the playoffs? 
The GIS helps to illustrate the risks in an orderly and scientific way.
GIS Tools for Risk Assessment
The more information that is available in the risk assessment, the better able the 
utility is to determine risk, and consequently the better able the utility is to mitigate 
or at least prepare for the risk. If a distribution utility knew that a certain line was 
particularly vulnerable to 75-mile-per-hour winds, then they could harden the line 
section or at least have crews ready to repair the line should those winds materi­
alize. Regulators judge utilities not simply on the speed of restoration but on the 
degree of planning and analysis of outage events. 
Equipment failures often come as surprises to utilities. For example, during 
hot summer months, transformers can become overloaded and fail, often to the 
surprise of utilities. Yet, utilities have information that could determine if a trans­
former or other device is vulnerable to failure if they perform a comprehensive 
risk assessment. They can base much of the information for the risk assessment on 
location in combination with other data readily available in the utility and over the 
web. 
The following example illustrates the use of spatial analysis for a storm plan­
ning risk model. The idea is for the utility to create a dynamic model that queries 
a variety of factors, many of them from different sources, normalizes and weights 
the factors and presents the results as a GIS map showing the relative risk of an 
overhead electric distribution system to a storm event. They can perform the same 
type of analysis for vulnerability to a high heat event or a flooding event.
Vulnerability Factors
Recall that risk involves vulnerability and consequence. So the first step is to iden­
tify the vulnerabilities of an overhead electric system to a possible storm event. 
In this case the storm event is high winds; say, more than 75 miles per hour. Data 
sources include the following:
••
Map of historic high wind events over the last many years. The idea here is 
that the baseline for vulnerability of the event is the relative likelihood of the 
event from even happening. So a data source is a map that shows polygons 
of the occurrence of high wind events. The map would show polygons of 

138 
�������������������������������
Emergency and Outage Management
frequencies of storm events having greater than 75-mile-per-hour winds over 
some historic period. The map is a raster image with each polygon having a 
uniform value of likelihood of storm event—say, in a scale of hours per year 
on average
••
Map showing age of conductor. This map would show each conductor seg­
ment highlighted by some age interval, such as 10 years or newer, 10 years to 
25 years, and older than 25 years. The data source for this map would come 
from the company’s work management or plant accounting system.
••
Map showing pole inspection data. Here the condition of the poles would 
be plotted based on the last time the poles were inspected. For simplicity, the 
map data would have several levels of condition, such as poor, fair, good, or 
excellent or have some scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, depending on the condition.
••
Map showing age of poles. This data would come from the company’s mate­
rial system or asset system. Similarly, the map showing the pole age would 
be bracketed into a few intervals.
••
Map showing soil types. This map details the soil configuration from clay to 
sandy over a few bracketed intervals. The idea here is that poles are more apt 
to topple if they are buried in sandy soil. Also trees will also be less stable.
••
Map showing feeder tree-trimming history. Falling tree branches cause the 
majority of outages during wind events, so knowing when the last time trees 
were trimmed gives a good indication about the chances of branches falling 
on lines. 
Each of these maps of course are digital maps from internal or external sources. 
The utility’s GIS would likely access these maps as web services from the organiza­
tion that manages this kind of data. The above data sources are just samples of data 
that goes into the vulnerability analysis. The utility could add other factors such 
as past rainfall, type of vegetation (pine trees versus hardwoods), elevation, line 
maintenance, guying, and pole loading, among others, into the analysis.
The GIS vulnerability model accesses all these data sources from the core sys­
tems that maintain them. For example, soil type data might arrive into the analysis 
as a web service from the local conservation commission. The idea is that every 
time the utility runs the model in the GIS, the model accesses the data sources from 
the most recent available source. If the utility recently replaced a pole and docu­
mented that replacement in the work management system, the next time the utility 
ran the model it would use the new pole information.
Since each of the data sources may be coming from different systems with dif­
ferent map projections, the first step is to convert all the data sources to the same 
map projection. The GIS performs this by examining the metadata, or data about 
the data, to determine the map projection of the source data and if necessary con­
verts the data to the target projection, most likely of the company’s electric distri­
bution GIS.
The next step is to convert the vector data, such as the map that shows con­
ductor age as a line segment into a raster data set. In this illustrative example, the 
model converts all data sets to raster images. 

Risk Profiling

The next step is to normalize each raster data set to a common scale of values. 
For example, age may be bracketed into a scale of one to ten, with ten being the 
newest, or age may be displayed explicitly as the actual age of the conductor. All 
the data sets need to be converted to the same scale. While is it interesting to view 
many data sets displayed together as layers, it becomes difficult to extract real 
meaning from these layers if there are too many of them. 
The next step is called weighted overlay. This spatial analysis tool was illustrat­
ed for transmission routing in Chapter 3. Since all of the layers now are based on 
the same map projections and have the same relative scales of vulnerability severity, 
the GIS can add up the various values in each raster cell to create a new map that 
displays the total vulnerability of each raster cell. However, the model can include 
logic whereby each data source can be given a different weighting factor. So, for 
example, in the vulnerability assessment, utilities may believe that historic rainfall 
or soil type has lesser or greater importance than pole condition, so they can assign 
a weighting factor to one or more of the data sets.
The resultant map is the total vulnerability to a wind event based on many 
factors. In fact, a utility could even include a map layer created by experienced dis­
tribution workers that outlines areas that they think are most vulnerable without 
regard to any scientific data, just their own intuition or experience. As every insur­
ance industry expert will tell you, the more information you have, the better handle 
you have on vulnerability. The final map shows a heat map (i.e., those areas whose 
combined scores of vulnerability fall within a certain range are shown in a differ­
ent color or shade). Normally the darker the shade is, the higher the vulnerability.
Consequence Analysis
Once the GIS creates the vulnerability map, it can create a similar consequence 
map. This can be done in a number of ways. Utilities can assign each feeder seg­
ment a value based on the criticality of the feeder section, such as the number of 
critical loads served by the feeder section or the total number of customers served or 
perhaps areas that are hard to get to. Planners can then perform a similar weighted 
overlay analysis to the vulnerability analysis by taking all the consequence factors 
creating a single consequence map.
Total Risk 
The total risk profile is the combining or mashing up of or simultaneously display­
ing of the vulnerability map with the consequence map. Once the GIS creates the to­
tal risk map, it can be run regularly as situations and the feeder data sources change. 
To test for electrical loading, the analysis can include real-time data from SCADA 
or DMS to be able to perform more ad hoc risk profiles during outage events.
Of course, once the utility maps the total risk, they now have the tools to be 
able to perform risk mitigation, which may include replacing key poles in areas 
of high risk or staging replacement poles and other equipment near areas that are 
more likely to fail. A proximity analysis could be used to answer the query: show 
me the closest parcel of land owned by the utility or available for lease to the ar­
eas of high vulnerability large enough to store emergency equipment. The spatial

analysis could compare the various lease costs to do this. See Figure 6.3 for the 
steps involved in a GIS risk analysis.

Emergency Management for Major Outage Events 
141
Emergency Management for Major Outage Events
When some very serious emergency or disaster strikes that results in significant 
numbers of customers without power, utilities often initiate some form of major 
emergency plan. These plans will usually differ considerably from the workflows 
that utilities use for routine outages. As stated earlier, there are no hard and fast 
rules that determine when a utility in effect crosses the line from a routine outage 
to a major outage. Often utilities make the assessment that if they cannot restore 
the vast majority of customers within one day with their existing workforce, they 
declare a major emergency. This declaration often determines if the customer out­
age is or is not included within its SAIDI numbers. Since utilities must report SAIDI 
(and SAIFI) to regulators, they want to be sure that the emergency is justifiable, 
since they do not want to be accused of calling an emergency without cause, just to 
make the numbers look good. 
The most common form of emergency is, of course, bad weather: blizzards, 
tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and ice storms. Other less common emergencies are 
wildfires, earthquakes, and mudslides. Emergencies can be nonnatural, such as cy­
ber attacks, terrorist, wars, and vandalism. Even cycles of drought and heavy rain 
can cause underground pipes to break, causing widespread damage and outages. 
People even theorize that sun storms could cause electromagnetic equipment like 
transformers to fail, which would cause widespread blackouts.
Major Emergency Plans of Operations 
As noted when these major events occur, utilities often execute a completely differ­
ent workflow for restoration. Some of the elements of the plan include decentral­
ization, establishment of temporary local restoration centers, importing crews from 
other utilities, suspending union work rules, and using office workers for damage 
assessment.
When utilities decide to decentralize operations, they may relocate distribution 
dispatchers to the local service centers. Of course, this leads to a greater need for 
communication and collaboration. During the critical periods when the event is 
still under way, outage management systems are not particularly effective, since 
their prediction engines depend on customer calls (or smart meter feeds) to help 
them determine the location of damage. When there is widespread damage, when 
everyone is out of power or many medium voltage feeders have tripped out, an 
OMS does not provide knowledge about the extent of the damage. Decentraliza­
tion is an attempt to break the problem into manageable sizes. The utility calls 
upon other utility employees who have normal “day jobs” to help with the logistics 
of restoration during major events and to establish regular local media and political 
contact processes. 
In cases where an emergency event causes significant damage, the utility must 
establish an enhanced process for materials management. 
Utilities will often establish local restoration centers, in shopping malls, schools, 
and police and fire stations. These facilities often serve as local control centers 
and places where restoration officials house and manage temporary employees and 
foreign crews (crews from other utilities on loan). 

142 
�������������������������������
Emergency and Outage Management
Once a utility realizes that the impact of the event is beyond their ability to ad­
equately restore with in-house facilities, they will regularly contact other utilities. 
They normally have mutual assistance agreements in place. This action has serious 
financial and logistical consequences. Further, timing is critical. If, for example, the 
event is a fast-moving hurricane, causing widespread damage, getting assistance 
from any utility that either has been hit with the hurricane or expects to be hit is 
extremely unlikely. So the utility will have to ask for assistance outside the area 
the storm is hammering. However, other utilities in the region are also looking for 
crews or a commitment to send crews. 
It becomes critical for the utility to properly assess the need for crews early 
enough to get them deployed and not so early as to have the crews show up and 
not be needed. 
The cost of these foreign crews, of course, is borne by the requesting utility. 
Once the impacted utility requests mutual assistance, they must manage those re­
sources. This includes providing food and housing. The utility must be careful to 
keep good records of all the costs incurred by foreign crews. They also must be 
ready to provide meaningful work for the crews when they arrive. 
Damage Assessment
Perhaps the most critical workflow for the utility during and right after a storm 
event is the assessment of exactly what the damage is. During routine outages, 
utilities call upon shift troubleshooters to assess the damage, and in many cases 
they actually fix the problem causing the outage. When the damage is extensive, 
they need to call upon other employees, the day job employees or foreign crews, to 
assess the damage. Many utilities still use relatively primitive tools to capture that 
knowledge. While it is important to know how many customers are out of power, it 
is more important to know the exact extent of the damage to its equipment. Having 
an accurate and early assessment of the damage helps utilities decide just how much 
help and materials they need. It further helps them to set the proper expectations 
to the community as to exactly how long the outages will last. GIS in the field can 
provide an accurate method of pin-pointing damage to the electrical facilities to 
exactly where the problem exists, like forms, reports, and scribbles on yellow pads 
can’t. Figure 6.5 illustrates a GIS map showing the location of damaged facilities.
Utilities that fail to properly assess damage and set realistic expectations often 
find themselves in after-the-event audit sessions with regulators.
Labor Issues
Accurate prediction and damage assessment avoids labor issues during and after 
the event. Many union contracts stipulate that the company and union can suspend 
some work rules during periods of a major declared outage emergency. So the util­
ity needs to notify the collective bargaining unit of exactly when they suspend the 
rules and when they declare the emergency over. Of course, this means that union 
leadership will be looking for assurances that the event actually warranted being 
called an emergency and will want assurances that the company did not keep the 
emergency active after the situation is back to a relatively routine state. So damage

143
assessment, prediction, and communication are critical to maintaining transparency 
with the unions all facilitated by GIS.
Tools of the Emergency Trade
Utilities have been dealing with major emergencies since the beginning of the in­
dustry. Since emergencies are relatively infrequent, utilities often do not implement 
special automation and information technology equipment just for special circum­
stances like major emergencies. Also, emergencies are unpredictable, so it would 
be hard to design a system to handle every conceivable type of emergency. The 
result is that most utilities resort to procedures that have worked in the past. Many 
of these tried and true procedures are manual and paper based. So utilities will 
use printed maps. Many will print map books and wall maps for distribution to 
their decentralized emergency centers. Some still resort to clip boards, pencils, and 
yellow pads. 
They will use their conventional automated systems, like their customer sys­
tems, outage management systems, and SCADA. However, these systems quickly 
get overwhelmed if the vast majority of customers are out of power. During a major 
power failure, utilities do not need to figure out who is out of power. They already 
know: everyone is out of power in a widespread area. SCADA tells them which 
medium-voltage circuits or transmission lines are out. They already know that. 
So, while helpful, the tools the utility uses during “routine” outages are much less 
effective during a major event.
Instead utilities rely heavily on weather and news services, TV, phones, their 
radio systems, spreadsheets, police and fire calls, government agencies like FEMA, 
the media, and calls from volunteers—and forms and more forms. They also hear 
from disgruntled customers. Rarely have utilities truly automated their emergency

management program in a comprehensive way. What follows is how GIS can help 
create a holistic approach to electric utility emergency management, without hav­
ing it linked to a particular type of emergency. 
The Four Rs of Emergency Management for Electric Utilities
Emergency management begins well before the threat of an emergency and ends 
well after the lights go back on. There are four major components of electric util­
ity emergency management: the four “Rs.” They are risk mitigation, readiness, 
response, and recovery. Each of these components or phases of emergency manage­
ment deals with location. Figure 6.6 illustrates the activities in each component of 
emergency management.
Risk Mitigation
As noted earlier in the chapter and throughout this book, the GIS is a critical tool 
to help determine risk. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 illustrated how GIS can lower the risk 
of building a power plant, a transmission line, or a substation in an unsuitable 
location by taking a number of data sources, performing spatial analysis, and dis­
playing suitable locations. Not doing that increases the risk that a utility will build 
the plant, transmission line, or substation in an area that may be more vulnerable 
to damage. Chapter 5 detailed how utilities use GIS to manage a number of risks,

including the risk of digging into a distribution line. Risk mitigation as part of emer­
gency management deals with looking at various threat scenarios and identifying 
which parts of the system are most vulnerable. With that information in hand, the 
utility can at least know in advance which parts of the system are most vulnerable 
to specific kinds of events. For example, an early winter storm in the Northeast will 
impact areas when leaves are still on the trees. Flooding an area of trees with shal­
low roots creates high risk of falling trees. Modeling this in the GIS allows utilities 
to do a better job of mitigating some of the risks. Certainly knowing that a major 
flood event may inundate a substation well in advance of bad weather gives the 
utility the time to install barriers, pumps, or simply to have plenty of sandbags at 
the substation. 
GIS and Risk Mitigation and Planning for All the Disasters
The GIS provides the ideal framework for modeling the impact of a variety of emer­
gency events on the electric infrastructure. Or, the GIS can help utilities in the site 
selection for new facilities by minimizing risk. So risk mitigation activities involve 
knowing where vulnerability is greatest and planning new facilities to minimize 
vulnerabilities. The GIS can model the worst-case scenarios.
Mitigation of risk can be relatively straightforward, like increasing tree trim­
ming in those areas where trees are most likely to cause the most damage or repair­
ing and clearing transmission access roads in critical and vulnerable areas. In areas 
where an important transmission line section is not easily accessible, for example, 
utilities will at least know what they would need to do should those transmission 
line segments fail. 
Once a utility has a solid understanding of the risk, using standard GIS risk 
models and implementing mitigation measures, they will be in better position to 
create readiness when the real thing approaches.
Readiness
The next component of emergency management is readiness. At this point, utili­
ties will know what the threat is. The threat is imminent. A hurricane is barreling 
up the coast or a blizzard is within hours of striking. Of course, some events, like 
earthquakes, which happen with no warning, require utilities to be in a constant 
state of readiness. 
Utilities that have modeled an event in advance will have a better chance of 
predicting the event’s impact and will be able to act in a timely manner to ready 
itself. As stated earlier, one or two of the most difficult decisions a utility emergency 
management officer has to make is to declare the emergency itself, since this sets 
in motion a host of other activities. The second decision deals with foreign crews: 
when to order and how many. With good data and accurate prediction models per­
formed well in advance, the utility will have a solid understanding of how bad the 
event is going to be. If they wait too long, no crews will be available. If they jump 
too soon, the utility may end up with too many crews (if the event doesn’t material­
ize) and a costly bill. Utilities have struggled with this for years.

146 
�������������������������������
Emergency and Outage Management
GIS and Readiness
The tasks in the readiness phase includes the following:
••
Weather forecasting and weather’s impact on the facilities and the surround­
ings. If utilities have built vulnerability models in GIS, they can mash them 
up with the weather predictions. Critical parameters include predicted wind 
speeds, flood depths, icing, landslide intensities, and fire directions. 
••
Staging. Once the utilities have a solid prediction of the potential impact of 
the event, they can stage people and material where the models predict the 
most damage, rather than waiting until the event is over to do the staging. 
It is often too late to do adequate staging after the event and certainly not 
during the event.
••
Logistics. Utilities can build in plans for the movement of people and mate­
rial during the readiness phase and during the response to the storm. They 
can identify where roads and bridges are likely to be damaged and take that 
into effect well before they find out the bridge is out or the road is closed. 
If the model is done in advance, they will have much more data to rely on, 
versus having to do extensive field assessment of damage.
The critical readiness phase occurs during the “calm before the storm,” when 
danger is coming, but there still is enough time to become ready, without over- or 
underreacting. Then when the event hits, the utility will have a solid plan for re­
sponse. Figure 6.7 shows a GIS map with areas identified where crews should be 
staged.

The Four Rs of Emergency Management for Electric Utilities 
147
Response
The response component of emergency management occurs during the event or 
very shortly thereafter. Depending upon the event, it may be too dangerous for the 
utility to do anything. Things are often happening too fast. The media, regulators, 
and public officials are looking for answers. There may be foreign crews showing 
up during the event. There is a pressure to perform. Customers will often be angry.
Perhaps the most critical thing the utility can do during this response phase is 
to perform ongoing situational analysis. Here it is critical to gain an ongoing ac­
curate assessment of what’s actually going on on the ground. Here the GIS provides 
a repository for the damage assessment from both the utility and all the agencies 
involved in the event. Also, the GIS can consume a number of services and map-
based data feeds, such as real-time flood data, social media feeds of issues, and 
any available imagery that may be available that gives utilities a better handle on 
exactly what they are facing. During this phase, utilities plan their restoration strat­
egies by assessing where they can restore as many customers as possible as quickly 
as possible. They can plan to isolate those areas hardest hit.
The GIS can consume critical public health and safety information, showing 
shelters and vital facilities, like water pumping stations, so they will have a ratio­
nal plan for recovery and restoration. Figure 6.8 shows a GIS map with shelters 
identified.
The first step during this chaotic period is to gain control over the situation 
and understand as best as possible the number and location of downed lines and 
blown fuses.
Recovery
Once the event has passed or it is safe for the restoration effort to begin, the recov­
ery process begins. The challenges during this phase is that there may be difficulty 
communicating. Customers may have been out of power for several hours and

are impatient. The media may be asking when the utility will restore the power. 
Having built solid plans during the response process will help answer the questions 
and set proper expectations. During this process, the utility has to be careful to 
keep track of the material that the crews are installing. Due to the urgency of the 
situation, the tendency is to get people their power back. However, if the utility fails 
to document what they replaced during the recovery, they will lose the accuracy of 
their data.
Utilities need to continuously monitor the situation. They need to fully un­
derstand what they have repaired, where the crews are working, and exactly how 
many customers are still out of power at all times. GIS provides the means to track 
damage and progress. Utilities use GIS for confirmation of the damage the event 
has done to their system. Handheld devices are most effective for data gathering 
and progress reporting. Utilities then adjust their plans based on the continuously 
monitoring of the situation. Utilities often make the mistake of building GIS mobile 
applications that are as comprehensive as the office applications used by the GIS 
professionals. Mobile GIS should be sharply focused on the task at hand. This is 
especially necessary during the response and recovery phase, where workers in the 
field are those either from outside the area or are workers pulled from their day 
jobs. 
By having a GIS situational awareness system in place during the recovery 
phase, utilities can make constant adjustments to their staffing and materials man­
agement. Many utilities still use static wall maps and push pins to manage the res­
toration efforts. Having a solid and agile approach to recover will result in shorter 
outages, better communication of the situation to outside parties, better cost con­
trol, happier customers (if that is ever possible during a major outage), transpar­
ency to regulators, and fewer after-the-fact audits.
GIS and Major Emergency Management
GIS is not the only automated tool utilities use to manage a major event, yet it can 
be a critical element in the response effort. When large proportions of customers are 
out of power due to catastrophic events, normal processes often get overwhelmed 
and prove to be inadequate to deal with situation. A well-planned-out approach to 
a major event using GIS really starts with fully understanding the risk. This may in­
volve elements that are well beyond the control of the utility, but utilities must fully 
understand them. For example, during the super storm Sandy in the fall of 2012, 
levies along the Hackensack River apparently breached, flooding the surrounding 
communities. Utilities need to understand these risk factors and make provisions 
should such events actually materialize. 
Perhaps the most critical information product during the major emergency 
event is map-based situational awareness. Utilities continuously gain control of a 
rapidly changing situation by monitoring the situation on the ground and making 
decisions accordingly. Losing that control increases costs, extends outages times, 
and results in mistakes and missteps.
The next section deals with the role of GIS during outage management. 
For any utilities, these smaller outages are just part of the routine of running a 
utility.

Outage Management 
149
Outage Management
Today most utilities have specialized systems that deal exclusively with outage man­
agement (i.e., “routine” outage management). The components and associated out­
age management of these systems include the following:
••
Information capture modules—these capture the raw data about outages 
from customer, police, and fire phone calls, as well as real-time systems like 
SCADA, and more recently from smart meters.
••
Prediction engines—these engines take the raw data captured and attempt 
to group the data into specific events. For example, if all meters reporting an 
outage are from a single transformer or low-voltage substation, the predic­
tion engine will associate all the meters to a single event. The idea is to locate 
the actual source of the outage (like a tree falling on a wire) and the location 
of the disconnecting device in order to disconnect the damaged section from 
the rest of the system. The output of the prediction engine is a list of jobs that 
require attention of the field crews.
••
Work management module—this model takes the list of outage jobs and as­
signs resources to repair the problems. These modules track the progress of 
the various outage events from identified, dispatched, and in progress repair 
to complete.
••
Statistical reporting module—this module reports on the overall outage 
management progress, calculating the total number of customers out of the 
power, the reliability statistics, and often the accumulated cost of the restora­
tion effort.
These specialized systems, called outage management systems (OMSs), are all 
based directly on a GIS or derive their data from a GIS. Today, utilities are com­
bining the elements of SCADA systems with OMSs into specialized systems called 
distribution management systems (DMSs). DMSs add functionality to OMSs for 
real-time data capture, power flow, and real-time switching. As more utilities add 
sensors to the distribution network and with complete implementation of smart 
meters, the less the utilities will need to rely on phone calls from customers to de­
termine outages locations. However, the workflows for outage management still 
remain—the need to determine the location of the outage (whether from calls or 
from meters), isolate the problem to the fewest possible customers, and to dispatch 
crews to the right location with the right materials to fix the problem.
Whether a utility uses an OMS or a DMS, the data that each of these systems 
needs for outage management is the same:
••
Accurate representation of the electric distribution system, including a com­
plete inventory of the pieces and parts of the distribution system and their 
location.
••
A logically connected model of the electric network.
••
Adequate attribution of the network. This includes essential information 
about the parts and pieces such as transformer, fuse, and conductor sizes. 

150 
�������������������������������
Emergency and Outage Management
••
Status of disconnecting devices. 
••
The condition of the assets. This helps dispatchers determine repair or re­
placement strategies during restoration. 
These requirements define an electric distribution GIS data model at a high 
level at least for use for outage management. Location, connectivity, attribution, 
status, and condition are essential for outage management and for most smart grid 
workflows as well. Not all of this information needs to reside directly in the GIS. 
The GIS can access attribution, status, and condition from other systems. The key 
is that the data must be complete and up to date. If, for example, the data used by 
the OMS or DMS is missing phase designation, then the determination of the exact 
location of an event will be difficult. Without accurate and up-to-date data, the 
prediction engine cannot precisely determine the number of actual outage events. If 
there is a large time gap between when the GIS and the OMS was updated, utilities 
will have to rely on costly and time-consuming field visits to uncover exactly where 
the problems are located.
Outage Management Information Products and Workflows 
Information products for outage management workflows are as follows:
••
Transmission maps (overhead and underground)—these will show access 
routes and dangerous vegetation.
••
Feeder maps (overhead and underground)—these maps show each feeder 
from the substation;
••
Color-coded actual circuit feeder situations—with actual switch positions;
••
Outage maps;
••
Spot and secondary network maps with outages or problems areas displayed;
••
Substation schematics with current operating conditions;
••
Display of crew locations;
••
Results of system analysis displayed on the map;
••
Situational awareness maps—these maps show a combined view of a number 
of situations that may occur during an outage event, like weather or storm 
patterns, social network feeds, SCADA feeds, and imagery. 
The critical information model for outage management is the complete electric 
distribution GIS ideally showing the complete transmission network, with HV/HV, 
HV/MV, MV/MV, and generator substations, the medium-voltage network, the 
low-voltage substations, and the low-voltage network up to the customer meter 
or service locaion, plus any equipment, such as a customer-owned generator that 
could impact safe restoration efforts. The workflow is straightforward—gather 
all data about where power is out, associate each individual power failure to a 
cause, determine the location of the cause of the failure, determine the location of 
the disconnecting device that isolated the power failure, determine the extent of 
the problem, dispatch repair crews to fix the problem, and document the results. 

Outage Management 
151
Specialized outage management systems using the GIS information model directly 
or as an input to the OMS perform these functions.
In cases of widespread outages, utilities will dispatch scouts to assess the 
damage and gather the data into the GIS to help manage a longer-term restoration 
effort. Often these damage assessment applications are quite simple, but of course 
they are just simple focused GIS applications. Figure 6.5 shows an example of a 
simple damage assessment application that a scout can use in the field on a simple 
mobile device like a smart phone or tablet . The information product for this simple 
app is the map with a series of symbols that show the location of damage to the 
electrical system. The pop-up would simply display the damage and often a photo 
of damage site. The damage assessment data then can be transmitted to the corpo­
rate GIS where it is combined with the full GIS data to give the dispatchers a better 
picture of the extent of the restoration effort. This data then becomes available to 
an overview situational awareness map as shown in Figure 6.9.
GIS Tools for Outage Management
The core workflows of outage management require GIS to perform network trac­
ing. Tracing the network from the customer reports (or smart meter reports) of a 
power failure up the network determines the most upstream location of the net­
work that feeds the known outages. This trace answers the query of where the most 
likely upstream location is where power has been lost. Tracing is a core capability 
of a GIS, provided of course that the network is complete and accurate. Switch posi­
tions (open/close) must also be available to the trace process to accurately predict 
the location of the outage event. Figure 6.10 describes the process for determining 
outage location.

Emergency and Outage Management
A variation on the tracing function is to collect network elements used in de­
termining the loading on a section of the network. This application of tracing is 
needed to determine what the load on a feeder section might be if load were to be 
transferred from a feeder that is currently out of power to an adjacent circuit. The 
GIS would trace the feeder, simulate a new feeder section attached to an adjacent 
feeder section, and then perform a load calculation to determine if the adjacent 
feeder could in fact handle the added load from the faulted feeder.
Other GIS functions helpful during outage management are statistical func­
tions, such as creating a polygon that adds the total number of point features 
representing individual outages or point features representing individual damage 
reports, and then reporting them statistically by a polygon region or shown as a 
cluster with the total number of outages or damages represented as a point with the 
values displayed. Figure 6.11 illustrates this concept.
GIS can also provide a way of summarizing outages for reporting externally, 
such as on a utility’s web site. While not showing specific outages, this reporting

The Emergency Management Information Model 
153
can be effective when communicating to a community the regions without power. 
When reporting outage locations to the public, the utility must balance giving too 
much detail with not giving enough. Providing detailed feeder information with 
exact details of the damages would probably not be effective.
The Emergency Management Information Model
The data required for emergency management is captured from both outside sources, 
such as pre- and post-storm imagery; historic, current, and predicted weather data 
or from internal systems, like outage management or distribution management 
systems; SCADA; fleet tracking systems; work management systems; and financial 
and materials systems. Workflows require the use of all the network information 
as discussed in Chapter 4. Common information products are varied, but the most 
important are the damage assessment maps and situational awareness maps. In ad­
dition to the information products noted here, these will also be helpful:
••
The location of crews.
••
The results of system analysis displayed on the map—as utilities back feed 
other parts of the system impacted by outages, utilities must be aware of 
possible overloads, so these maps show the result of load flow analysis us­
ing real-time data. It can also simulate the loading in advance of switching 
to make sure that a switching action doesn’t create overloads. Often the 
analytics are performed by other systems such as OMS, DMS, and network 
simulation software.
••
Risk profile maps—utilities can display areas of the system that have higher 
vulnerability and display that along with the current situation like an ap­
proaching storm.
••
Overloaded transformer maps—if the utility has access to real-time trans­
former data (from smart meters, for example), they can carefully monitor the 
overloading of transformers and display the results within the GIS as part of 
an overall situational awareness.
••
Critical customer locations—during outage events, utilities need to visualize 
the location of critical customers. Utilities can publish the locations of these 
customers from whatever system captures this information, and the GIS can 
display them along with other relevant data.
Perhaps the most important information product and workflow is the one that 
no one anticipated. Emergency response is not an exact science, since the extent, 
location, and cause varies so much. However, GIS is flexible enough to be able to 
adapt quickly to any number of events, if data about the event is available in a 
timely fashion. Utilities can create flexible risk models that can adjust to nearly any 
kind of event.

Emergency and Outage Management
GIS and Emergency and Operations Management
All emergencies are different. However, utilities tend to handle emergencies (which 
cause power outages) as either small enough to be able to handle routinely or large 
enough to declare a major emergency. If the outage event is manageable, the utility 
has routine processes and procedures in place to handle in a repeatable way. They 
have systems in place, like outage management systems or distribution management 
systems, coupled with their customer information system (CIS) that deal with out­
ages in a routine way. During these events, the GIS provides clues to better restora­
tion efforts, a clear situational awareness of the exact progress of the restoration 
work, and a way to bring disparate data together. Ideally, the OMS or DMS works 
in close integration with the GIS.
During the abnormal and large events, the OMS and DMS or smart meters 
don’t provide the guidance needed during the early stages of response, since the 
effort is more focused on logistics, staging, and deployment than understanding 
which customers are out from which cause. GIS provides the ability to bring to­
gether many sources of information, not managed by OMS or DMS, such as road 
closures, shelters with or without power, flooding, landslides, collapsed buildings, 
and large areas of devastation. 
In all cases, whether the outage event is routine or major, GIS provides tools to 
help determine vulnerability, help to focus on the consequences of the vulnerability, 
visualize risk, and provide a means of collecting disparate data, analyzing the data, 
and providing continuous situational awareness to critical decision makers during 
a time when customers are most inconvenienced.

GIS Enhances the Retail Business
In the old days before utility restructuring, integrated utilities did everything from 
generating the electricity to rendering a bill to each customer. Today, separate 
standalone businesses called retailers or competitive suppliers often handle cus­
tomer care. Yet regardless of who performs the functions of the retail business, the 
tasks still are the same as in the days before utility restructuring. The distribution 
business does some of the tasks, while the retailers do others. For example, even 
though the retailer may render the electricity bill (perhaps even bundled with other 
services); the distribution company still has to manage customer interaction during 
a power failure. Or when a customer needs a new service, the distribution company 
manages that work, not the retailer.
There continues to be a debate globally about which entity—the retailer or the 
distribution company—should own, install, and manage the electrical meter, smart 
or otherwise. Both entities need information from the meter. In the U.S., the distri­
bution company universally owns and manages the meters. As a result, the onus is 
on the distribution company to deliver the meter readings to the various retailers. 
This chapter will treat all matters of retail and customer care as if the distribution 
company performs all tasks.
As noted in prior chapters, there are four distinct businesses within the utility: 
energy supply (production, generation, or energy procurement), wholesale delivery 
(transmission), retail delivery (distribution), and retail. In each of these businesses, 
there is a distinct physical demarcation point. The demarcation point for retail is 
the load side of the electric meter. The distribution business (or retailer) owns the 
meter and the service to the meter. The customer owns and is responsible for all of 
the equipment connected to the load side of the meter. There is some inconsistency 
even with this statement. The service drop is often the responsibility of the cus­
tomer, even though it is on the supply side of the meter. 
The Meter
The meter is at the heart of the retail business. Nearly everything the retail utility 
business does revolves around the meter. It is the cash register for all four business 
units. It would seem to make sense that from a GIS facilities inventory viewpoint 
that GIS captures the location of each of the meters. However, there may be cus­
tomer equipment between the service entrance or service drop location and the 

156 
��������������������������������

meter. Figure 7.1 shows a simple service with customer equipment and utility equip­
ment shown. Or, there may be a bank of meters in an apartment building base­
ment. Each meter serves a separate apartment. Between the exact location where 
the service cable enters the basement of the building and the bank of meters, there 
will be a main service cables, conduit, cable trays, or raceways that run from the 
where the cable enters the apartment building to the meter bank. There will likely 
be a splice box where the service cable splits into many cables to feed each meter. 
All that equipment is customer equipment, including the meter mounting cabinet. 
If something goes wrong with that equipment, the customer is responsible for the 
repair or replacement. The only equipment the utility owns is the meter itself. 
From a strict asset management perspective, the utility may not want to model 
assets owned by the customer. There may be some exceptions to this for very large 
customers, but for most customers the termination point of the GIS should be at 
the demarcation point of ownership or responsibility between the customer and 
the utility. That point is usually at the service entrance or service attachment, not 
at the actual meter location. That means that utilities must maintain a relationship 
between the actual meter or meters and the service point of the GIS. Sometimes, 
GIS modelers call this point the premise point, which the utility will often uniquely 
identify. So the utility creates a one (premise point) to many (meters) relationship 
within the GIS. In addition, the utility can also maintain a one-to-one relationship 
between the premise and the service address.
As an aside to this point, utilities should attempt to keep edits to the GIS infor­
mation to as few as possible, if nothing else to save the labor of constantly editing 
the GIS. Whenever the utility creates a data structure, it needs to make sure that it 
doesn’t model the data structure in a way that creates unnecessary work for it. A 
simple example is that some utilities might want to include the customer account 
number or meter number as an attribute of a point feature called meter. The prob­
lem is that meters and customer account numbers can change often, each time a 
customer moves. However, the only time the premise point changes is when the 
physical location moves, which is much less frequent and probably would only

happen if someone was renovating a building. What utilities don’t want to hap­
pen is that every time a customer moves or they replace a meter, someone has to 
perform an edit to the GIS. Instead, the utility can create a relationship (outside the 
GIS) in which the meter (and account number) are related to a fixed premise point. 
In this way, whenever the utility replaces, shuts off, or disconnects a meter, the 
GIS accesses this information easily from other systems, without having to perform 
an edit on the GIS. In the same way, utilities shouldn’t maintain the exact switch 
position or condition of a fuse directly in the GIS, since they would have to update 
the GIS every time a switch changes position or a fuse blows. They may want to 
maintain the desired or scheduled position of a switch, since that is not likely to 
change much at all. Recall that the GIS is an integration framework, not simply an­
other database to store information. The key information stored in the GIS should 
be that information uniquely handled by the GIS. Customer information systems, 
meter data management systems, financial systems, and SCADA better handle real-
time status, meter, billing, and customer information. The GIS, however, is the 
place to bring data from various sources to visualize, analyze, and discover patterns 
for decision making as well as storing the physical location of all of the utility assets 
and their relationship to one another.
The Smart Meter
The smart meter will fundamentally change the electric utility business. Utilities 
that have implemented truly smart meters will no longer have to estimate customer 
behavior. Utilities will know precisely when every customer loses power, when they 
have a momentary interruption, what their consumption patterns are (within some 
time interval), and what the utilities need to do to manage demand. For the entire 
history of electric companies, utilities have relied solely on customer calls to deter­
mine who exactly is out of power. Further, they never knew how much power was 
flowing through their distribution equipment. For the most part, utilities only knew 
about power outages when they impacted large portions of the network. For nearly 
all residential customers, they only knew the average consumption over a large 
interval, often a month.
The industry refers to the smart meter, its associated communication network, 
and head end gear as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). Industry leaders 
crafted this term to differentiate AMI from automated meter reading (AMR). While 
AMR reads consumption in a somewhat automated way using various techniques, 
it does not provide the complete infrastructure for two-way communication with 
the meter. In addition to the utility communicating with the customer meter, the 
AMI infrastructure allows the utility to communicate to devices beyond the meter. 
So the utility could, if allowed to, disconnect individual loads inside the customers’ 
facilities. When fully deployed, utilities could control demand at a very granular 
level during high peak demand days or even adjust demand for dynamic pricing. 
However, AMI still does not have knowledge of how the utility delivers the electric­
ity. It doesn’t know which feeder is supplying power to the customers. Further, AMI 
has no knowledge of causes of customer behavior. AMI reports only outcomes. The 
GIS, together with AMI, SCADA, generation control, and DMS, provide utilities 
with a complete picture of the entire supply chain of the utility delivery in nearly 

158

real time. The GIS provides the network infrastructure information, plus the spatial 
analytic capabilities to tie all the pieces together from the outcomes to the causes. 
AMI Network
There are three major components of AMI: the collection of smart meters, the meter 
data management (MDM) system, and the communication infrastructure or AMI 
network. The purpose of the MDM is to consume the data from the meters via the 
network and process the data for use by other systems, like billing or outage man­
agement systems. 
The AMI network consists of all the devices and equipment between the smart 
meters and the MDM. Utilities have a number of options regarding the AMI net­
work. Some utilities have decided to build, own, and operate this network them­
selves. Others decided to use commercial networks, while still others use a combi­
nation of commercial and private networks, in which one backs up the other. Most 
utilities have some form of telecommunications network already. Many will lever­
age the investment in their existing network. Figure 7.2 illustrates the components 
of AMI and their major functions.
In all these cases, the location of the equipment is critical for operation of the 
AMI network. Modeling any telecommunications network in GIS is beyond the 
scope of this book and is as complicated, if not more complicated, than an electri­
cal GIS. It merits an entire book of its own. The option the utility used for their 
AMI network (private, commercial, or hybrid) determines how much control they 
have over the physical communications network itself. Just because the utility does 
not operate the AMI network, doesn’t mean that it cannot access the information 
about the AMI network. If the utility utilizes a communication network they do 
not own, they can craft an information-sharing agreement with the carrier. For 
example, the carrier could publish data as a GIS web service to the utility of all 
their critical facilities that impact the AMI network. The web service doesn’t have 
to have the detail that the carrier owns, but it does have to have enough detail to 
be able to correlate the AMI network components with the utility’s infrastructure.

For example, if an errant driver knocks down a pole that has the electric equipment 
and a critical cell relay for the AMI network, the utility needs to know that com­
munication from a group of meters may be impacted. 
If, on the other hand, the utility has built out a completely private network, 
then they need to create a telecommunications GIS in much the same way that a 
commercial carrier would. The electric and the telecommunications GIS can share 
layers about structures (such as poles and conduits) and base maps, but they can 
manage the facilities separately. However, both the electric and the telecommunica­
tions GIS can easily share information with each other. They can both participate in 
an output products and spatial analysis models. As noted, they certainly can share 
base map information from the same source.
Meter Data Management (MDM) Systems
The MDM processes the raw data that it receives from the smart meters (and other 
meters as well), analyzes network performance, reports on meters not reporting, 
and creates meter-to-cash processes in preparation for billing. The vision of smart 
grid is to use the MDM-processed data to give customers and utilities information 
they can use to manage consumption. 
One of the original concepts of smart grid was to reduce greenhouse gas pro­
duction. Figure 7.3 illustrates the principles of smart grid as outlined from the 
U.S. perspective in the law that the U.S. Congress passed in 2007. One way to 
do that is to manage demand. This notion called demand response started with 
providing consumers ready access to their consumption information, well before 
they received their monthly bill. Given that information, proponents of the smart 
grid argued, consumers could alter their consumption behavior well in advance of 
receiving their bill. The other way to impact demand was for utilities to actually 
take direct control of a consumer’s consumption. This would happen by actually 
disconnecting devices during times of heavy demand. The other concept was to 
alter pricing of retail electricity depending on the wholesale pricing. Utilities call 
this dynamic pricing. Dynamic pricing is an extension of the time of use pricing. 
Time of use pricing assumes that the wholesale cost of electricity is lower during 
off-peak times (from, say, 6 PM to 6 AM) than during peak times. Dynamic pricing 
extends the concept to actually follow the wholesale cost of electricity, so, theoreti­
cally, pricing of electricity could vary throughout the day depending on the cost of 
power produced. 
MDM provides the means of analyzing the raw data, processing the data, and 
providing utilities the knowledge of how to best utilize demand response.
Role of GIS in AMI
Clearly AMI will improve the billing process. It will provide an automated means of 
disconnecting and reconnecting service to customers. Without AMI, utilities either 
have to visit the site of a meter to disconnect or reconnect or leave the service con­
nected. Neither situation is ideal. Remote disconnection avoids what utilities call 
a truck roll, having a truck drive to a location to disconnect or reconnect a meter, 

160 
��������������������������������

which is expensive. Leaving the meter connected often results in unauthorized use 
of the electricity. Utilities can immediately get a final read of the meter for custom­
ers vacating or an initial read when a new customer moves in. In the unfortunate 
cases of customers not paying their bills, the utility can shut off a customer for 
nonpayment remotely and reinstate power as soon as the bill is paid.
Utilities can enrich the data from AMI by integrating the consumption data 
with GIS. In these cases, utilities can see patterns of consumption. Then they can 
see where potential demand problems may be developing well before situations get 
critical. They will be able to see where to target marketing programs for demand 
response. The idea would be to discourage usage in those areas where electrical 
capability is limited. They could encourage customers to participate in remote dis­
connection of appliances in those areas where it makes the most sense. Figure 7.4 
shows smart meter information on a GIS map.
In effect, the GIS together with the MDM provide a situational awareness of 
exactly what the consumption patterns are much faster than ever before. Generally, 
they can view consumption accurately the next day for the prior day.

GIS and the New Customer Connect Process
Chapter 5 dealt with the work order process. In this process, the utility receives a 
request to alter the distribution system in some way. The request may come from 
the planning or asset management department for an upgrade to a feeder or from 
the city to relocate wires due to a street widening project or from a reliability engi­
neer to break up a feeder into smaller sections or add a new automated sectional­
izing switch. Perhaps the most common request comes from a prospective customer 
for new service. This request ranges from a new overhead service from an existing 
overhead distribution line to a feeder supplying a new shopping mall or housing 
subdivision. 
While the work order process is the same as outlined in Chapter 5, the nu­
ances for customer care are a bit different, since the requestor of the change to the 
infrastructure is a customer. Processes need to be in place to satisfy the customer 
as well as to assure that company implements the proper metering and starts the 
revenue flowing correctly. The major difference between a work order to upgrade 
a feeder to a new customer connection is that the new customer connection request 
happens randomly and unexpectedly. This means that the utility needs to have agile 
processes in place to move the request along to get the project completed when the 
customer needs the service. The utility could receive a flurry of new connections at 
any time.
The new customer connect process involves a number of steps; the very first is 
negotiating an in-service date with the customer. The second is negotiating a price 
for the new service. Utilities pride themselves on providing good customer service. 
One common metric of customer service is meeting customer in-service dates. Once 
the utility and the customer agree on an in-service date, the customer in-service 
clock starts clicking. If the utility fails to supply power to the customer on that 
date, the company has an unhappy customer and the failure detracts from meet­
ing a key performance metric. Delaying electric service can have a direct revenue 
impact on revenues as well. 
The utility must make a rapid assessment of the request to determine whether 
the present infrastructure has adequate capacity to handle the new load. Whether 
or not it does impacts both the cost and the schedule of the project. It also has to 
determine whether the new construction requires governmental permits, such as 
easements, street opening permits, or grants of location for new equipment. Finally, 
the utility must determine if it needs any special metering equipment or if it needs 
to extend or upgrade the AMI system. 

GIS and the New Customer Connect Process 
163
Role of GIS in the New Customer Process
GIS can help automate this process and provide visibility into how well the utility 
is performing. Figure 7.6 shows a GIS map with customer work orders identified. 
The GIS will have the key data to determine whether the utility needs to upgrade 
the infrastructure (both electric power and smart grid). The faster this is done, the 
sooner the utility and the customer can determine both the costs and the schedule 
of completing the new service. 
The traditional way utilities handle this process often goes like this:
••
The electrical contractor contacts the municipal agency requesting a wiring 
permit for the electrical work they need to do, including the new electrical 
service. The contractor will likely have to explain all the details of the project 
to the agency.
••
The electrical contractor, with wiring permit in hand, either meets with a 
utility representative or calls the utility with a request for a new service. The 
contractor repeats the same information to the utility contact person that he 
or she told the municipal agency. The contractor requests an in service date. 
The utility accepts the date but does not confirm it. The utility then explains 
about possible costs, but due to a lack of information cannot provide exact 
costs, nor can they collect any fees in advance of the work.
••
The utility representative places the request in a work management queue. 
The contractor does not have any guarantee on price or schedule.
••
Depending on the workload, the utility engineers or designers review the 
request to see if the present infrastructure can handle the new service. Of 
course, this has to be done in relation to other requests that may be in the 
same area. To adequately do this, the engineers must request loading in­
Figure 7.6  GIS map showing customer work orders. (Source: Esri et al.)

164 
��������������������������������
GIS Enhances the Retail Business
formation from the billing department. They then must perform a network 
calculation to determine if they need to upgrade the infrastructure. 
••
If the infrastructure is adequate, then the engineers perform a preliminary 
design and determine the cost of the service. They then need to schedule 
the work based on the current workload and the available resources. If 
they determine that they need a new transformer or they have to upgrade 
a feeder, for example, the project becomes much more complicated, costly, 
and uncertain. 
••
Once the designers complete the design, they determine if they will need to 
obtain any permits from the government. Of course, they won’t be able to 
determine if they need permits until they understand the full scope of the 
work. For example, if the utility needs to install a new transformer because 
the new load will exceed the existing transformer, that work may involve 
permits. 
••
Once the utility knows the scope of the work, they can they predict when the 
work will be completed and what the costs will be.
••
Once they receive the notice to proceed from the customer, the work pro­
ceeds like any other new construction project.
The problem with this workflow is that this assessment process can take quite 
some time, delaying the project and introducing a degree of uncertainty for the 
customer. One way to avoid this delay is to provide a GIS portal for customers 
(contractors) that allow them to enter their load data and any special requirements 
directly into an application that is either GIS-based or has GIS functionality. The 
portal can quickly determine if the utility will need to provide additional infrastruc­
ture or not. If the service request is routine, meaning that it will not require any­
thing special, the contractor can directly initiate the work order, pay the connection 
fee, and receive an automatically created in-service date. For special situations, the 
contractor will receive a notice that the request requires additional engineering. 
This process eliminates routine projects from clogging up engineering queues.
The utility could create a simple arrangement with the municipality to auto­
matically transmit wiring permit data to the utility. Having this arrangement in 
place, the utility would know much of the information it needs for the project, well 
in advance of the time the contractor actually contacts the utility. It’s possible that 
those more complex tasks could be pre-engineered as well. This self-service idea 
shortens the time between when the contractor initiates the wiring permit and the 
determination of the in-service date. In fact, the contractor could communicate 
with the utility directly at the job site in the field using a mobile device. 
For very simple connections, the utility could automate the entire process right 
up to construction. When the utility receives a request for service, the self-service 
GIS-based application validates that it is a simple request, initiates the work order, 
receives payment by credit card, and submits the request directly to the field. It is 
possible that the utility could connect the customer within hours of the request. To 
do this, the GIS, the work management system, and perhaps a network analysis 
system (depending on the complexity) needs to communicate and integrate. The 
GIS application also has to have up-to-date loading information available from 

GIS and Billing, Credit, and Collections 
165
the MDM or customer information system has to be able to determine the current 
loading. 
Most requests for new service are simple. Yet many utilities take days or weeks 
just to get the requests into the field for construction. The delays are a result of 
handoffs from one group to another—from the work order group to the engineer­
ing group, to the permit group, to the billing group, to the meter group, and back 
to the work order group, with approvals and wait times in between. Since the GIS 
accesses nearly all the information needed to satisfy the request (along with integra­
tion with other corporate systems), utilities can eliminate much of this delay.
GIS and Billing, Credit, and Collections
Billing is the processing of consumption information, applying the rates to the raw 
metering data, and rendering a bill to a customer. Historically, the vertically in­
tegrated utility performed this process. For most of the utility’s customers, this 
process is routine. The utility sends the bill, and the customer pays. However, there 
are certain customers who do not pay or do not pay on time. These customers cre­
ate the most work for the billing department, and the lack of payment negatively 
impacts the company’s revenues. Every year, utilities give up on collecting money 
from delinquent customers and simply write off the receivable. The accumulated 
write-offs are referred to as bad debt. Bad debt for some utilities can be high. For 
some utilities, the dollar amounts can be in the multimillion-dollar range. Utilities 
may decide certain approaches prior to writing this debt off. They can actually visit 
with customers (knocking on doors), call, email, or threaten disconnection. All of 
these approaches are expensive. 
The utility can use GIS to help them cluster delinquent customers to optimize 
the visits. They can map the distribution of customers based on the time they are 
late. They can analyze the patterns of payment for certain customers in certain 
areas.
Utilities must be very careful not to profile groups of customers. However, by 
knowing payment patterns and demographics, they can fine-tune their collection 
activity to optimize collection success while minimizing disrupting disconnections. 
Figure 7.7 shows how GIS maps can illustrate demographic patterns.
Utilities can also market prepayment plans to certain customers. For example, a 
utility might wish to market prepayment to areas with a high percentage of college 
student populations. Prepayment avoids the collection activity completely. Utilities 
can map historic areas of their service territory where people move frequently. This 
gives them the focus for their prepayment marketing activity.
GIS and Metering
Metering, smart or otherwise, involves the entire process of the management of the 
customer meter. When a customer requests a new service, the utility must provide, 
install, and commission a meter for that customer. The utility must set up a new 
account, and the utility must notify the GIS that they have created a new service 

166 
��������������������������������

location. The process has to be tightly coordinated with the new customer connect 
process noted earlier. 
Meters fail and get old. In cases where the utility migrates from old meters to 
new smart meters, they have to schedule the work. The logistics can be daunting.
Since the GIS maintains the service location, utilities can use it to manage the 
logistics of meter repair, meter testing, and replacement. Chapter 8 will go into 
more detail on routing and field force management. Utilities use GIS as a situation­
al awareness tool to visualize what is going on specifically regarding meter issues. 
Knowing the clusters of smart meters not reporting, the utility can determine if 
meters are failing or, more likely, coverage is lacking, or perhaps the network has a 
problem. Figure 7.8 shows how GIS is used to identify problems with smart meters.
Customers will complain about high bills. Most often these complaints are 
a result of high consumption. However, if the GIS notes a pattern of high bill 
complaints clustered in a certain area, they may be able to determine that there is 
something going wrong in the area. GIS provides the tools to give the entire meter­
ing process a spatial context. It can help optimize meter testing and schedule new 
meter installations routes. With an entirely new replacement of meters, the utility 
can use GIS to report on progress, program in the best paths for replacement, and 
create reports for senior management that shows the progress of the deployment.
For those utilities that have not deployed smart meters, they can utilize GIS to 
identify tough-to-read meters. Utilities do not like to estimate bills. They like to 
read each meter on a scheduled basis, so they can be sure that the bill that they send 
to the customer accurately reflects the customer’s consumption. When they cannot 
gain access to the meter to read, they resort to sending an estimated bill until they 
can gain access to the meter. If they have underestimated a customer bill for several 
billing periods, when they finally get an accurate reading, the customer could get a 
very large bill. This situation creates problems for the call center, the billing depart­
ment, and, if the situation is severe enough, a story about this ends up in the news­
papers. Estimated meter reads can be very expensive for the utility. So utilities can

map where accessibly problems exist and help utilities to target areas for a limited 
deployment of smart meters to those areas with the greatest accessibility problems.
Today, many of the countries in the world and states in the U.S. have un­
bundled the retail and billing processes. In the U.K., for example, there are seven 
distribution companies and nearly twenty energy supply companies. The distribu­
tion companies and the energy supply companies need to share the consumption 
information. In Texas, for example, the distribution companies own and operate 
the meters but deliver the data to a central clearing house where the retailers access 
the data. 
GIS can be used as a collaboration tool for the distribution companies to be 
able to identify exactly which retailers service which customers. When things do go 
wrong, the retailers will be better informed when customers contact them.
The Call Center
The call center consists of a number of employees (with access to the utility’s cor­
porate information systems) who wait for customer calls. The call center employees 
have access to data about the customers. Often utilities will have overflow call 
centers in other parts of the world to deal with times when the volume of calls ex­
ceeds the capacity of the utility call center. Some utilities outsource the entire call 
center. For many customers, the interaction between themselves and the call center 
staff is their only touch point with the utility. This means that the responsibility for 
customer satisfaction depends heavily on how well the employees handle the calls 
from customers. Call centers handle the following:

••
Outage calls—though most utilities now handle outages via an interactive 
voice response (IVR) system;
••
Exit or entering calls—customers who plan to move contact the call center 
to cancel or move their service to a new address;
••
New customer calls— a customer who moves into an existing facility that 
has an existing service already installed;
••
Billing inquiries—calls from customers complaining about a high bill or 
want information about their bill; often a customer will complain about an 
outage due to a disconnection for nonpayment;
••
New customer connections—calls from a customer representative (often an 
electrical contractor) requesting that the utility install a new service (and 
meter); see earlier discussion in this chapter;
••
Street light outages—calls from customers or others reporting a street light 
not operational;
••
General complaints—these are calls from customers and others complaining 
about nonelectrical situations like utility trucks parked on the street blocking 
passage or tree trimming crews cutting down trees.
The key to successful resolution of customer calls at the call center is to make 
sure that the call center representatives have timely and complete information avail­
able to them. Most of the calls they receive have some kind of spatial component 
to them. Certainly it is helpful for the call center representative to know where the 
customer is calling from based on access to the GIS. 
Street lights are not only for public convenience; they provide a protection 
against crime in neighborhoods. Often utilities are measured on their response to 
street light outages. In some cases, street lights are owned by a number of enti­
ties, so the utility needs to know which lights are theirs. When a customer reports 
a street light out, the call center person needs to be able to visualize on the GIS 
exactly which light the customer is talking about. Asking the customer to identify 
the street light by some pole number attached to the pole is not effective, since the 
customer is likely calling at night and the street light is out, so identification will 
be difficult. Instead, the call center representative can see on the GIS which street 
light the customer is reporting. Utilities can use the GIS to automate this process 
as well. Customers can call an online GIS map (on their smart phones or tablets) 
showing street light symbols. The customer can simply click on the symbol and 
report the outage. Then, if a customer does call the call center, the representatives 
have immediate access to the status of the street light problem and could confirm 
that someone else has reported the problem.
A GIS-based street light self-service system routes the report to the street light 
crew. Having these GIS displays available to call center staff enhances employee 
morale since employees will have the right tools to satisfy customer requests at their 
fingertips. Not having good tools can frustrate staff, since they will be dealing with 
frustrated customers. Customers appreciate accurate answers to their questions. 
Giving employees timely and complete information improves cutomer satisfaction.
During outage events, the call center representatives need to know the extent 
of an outage, where the crews are located, and the estimated restoration time. This

will help customers and business owners impacted by the outage. Business owners 
will have a better handle on whether to close, stay open, or when to let employees 
go home.
As noted, utilities use GIS as a situational awareness tool to give to call center 
staff the locations of outages and of crews. In addition, many utilities publish an 
online outage visualization tool, driven by GIS. Often, if power out is widespread 
and customers don’t have access to information, the call center is the only source of 
information for them. Many utilities use social media to help get more information 
about what is going on in their service territory, as noted in Figure 7.9.
Certain jurisdictions allow utilities to disconnect customers when they are de­
linquent on their bill. It’s important for the call center staff to understand the tim­
ing of this event. If the customer pays the bill, but the utility has a crew on the way 
to disconnect the customer, the call center person will need to have visibility into 
the progress of the disconnection process. They will need to know the location of 
the crew assigned to disconnect. If they have not disconnected the customer they 
will need to notify the crew that the bill has been paid. This avoids the problem of 
a crew disconnecting a customer after the bill has been paid, as well as the added 
cost of returning to reconnect service to the customer. Using the GIS for situational 
awareness into the status of disconnections is critical. This will be especially valu­
able for a utility with smart meters. 
Geomarketing for the Retail Business
Geomarketing is the practice of using location to fine-tune messaging to targeted 
segments for the purpose of increasing the attention of a particular segment. For 
example, if a utility wants to market a prepay program, they need to segment the 
customer base into those areas where prepay has a high degree of favorability. If, for 
example, the utility wants to market green power, then they would target the seg­
ment of their customer base that they know would be willing to pay more for green 
power. These two programs would appeal to two very different types of customers.

GIS Enhances the Retail Business
Those types of customers, however, do not tend to live in the same neighborhoods. 
The notion of geomarketing is to match the demand—the product or service being 
promoted by the utility to the most likely customers who live or work within certain 
areas of the service territory.
The criteria for these areas tend to be based on demographic studies, including 
the average age of customer, their average income, their buying habits, their hob­
bies, and their interests. Utilities (and retailers) use this demographic segmenting to 
effectively market a particular program to the audience. 
For many years, utilities used the term ratepayer to describe the consumer of 
electricity. Only recently have utilities abandoned using ratepayer and adopted the 
more appropriate term: the customer. The only real differentiation utilities per­
formed on their ratepayers was, not surprisingly, by their rate class. So when a 
utility did marketing, their only real source of data was their customer information 
system (CIS). The CIS takes the rate and the consumption to create the bill. Utili­
ties have adapted CISs to capture customer interactions, but utility CISs are often 
not designed to help utilities truly understand customer behavior beyond their pay­
ment, complaint, and maybe outage and inquiry history. 
What utilities have discovered is that for years the consumer retail business 
has been segmenting customer behavior so they can match their offerings to the 
segmented and targeted customers who are most likely to buy their product. What 
retail businesses have learned is that location really matters when attempting to 
understand customer behavior and their propensity or affinity to certain products 
and services. Location helps businesses understand demographic, psychographic, 
purchasing, and spending characteristics.
The first step in target marketing is knowing where the customers are. A util­
ity knows this exactly since all their “ratepayers” are located within a defined 
service territory. Knowing the concentration of their segmented customers saves 
utilities from canvassing their entire service territory to uncover that only a certain 
demographic is interested in a specific product offering. In other words, using GIS, 
utilities can discover their customers’ lifestyle characteristics, buying habits, how 
far they are willing to travel, and what they are buying. They will be able to see 
where people of similar characteristics are clustered. Then they can target market 
directly to them.
Utilities that operate overhead electric lines will most likely have to perform 
tree trimming. Some utilities spend enormous sums on tree trimming alone. Yet, 
despite the obvious benefit of tree trimming, there is a segment of the population 
that abhors any tree trimming done by utilities. Utilities continue to trim trees in 
areas where opposition is high, without regard to marketing to that segment of 
the population. Then the utilities are surprised when they get negative press about 
their “callous trimming of the beautiful palm trees.” Utilities could segment their 
customer base, market a healthy-tree program, and invite customers to learn about 
the advantages of trimming trees. While this isn’t marketing a product or service 
directly, it uses the principles of target marketing to achieve the goal of matching 
customer needs to business offerings.
The next step is to segment the customer base by lifestyle characteristics. The 
result of this analysis is a series of polygons, with each polygon sharing a dominant 
set of lifestyle characteristics, like enjoying golf, dining out frequently, and owning 
luxury cars. Other lifestyle profiles are those people who might be likely to camp 

Economic Development 
171
out, buy from health stores, wear jeans, and ride bicycles. With this data, utilities 
can learn much about what their customers are like, not just what rate class they 
belong to.
The third step is understanding the targeted customer segment’s needs and de­
sires. This matches who the customer is to what the customer is likely to buy or 
respond to. If, for example, the utility is targeting customers for a time-of-use rate 
structure, they would target people who are likely to change their consumption 
behavior.
The last step in geomarketing is to analyze the offering and match the offering 
to the segment most likely to benefit or buy into the offering. Customer segmenta­
tion based on geographic and lifestyle characteristics plays an important role in 
determining what segment to target. This assures that utilities are not spending 
marketing resources in areas unlikely to produce results. So as utilities move from 
thinking of customers by their rate class to their lifestyle characteristics, they can 
better match their offerings or even their core services to the right customers. 
Today, demographic, psychographic, spending patterns, and customer segmen­
tation data is widely available over the web. Utilities can simply mash up lifestyle 
data with their customer information data and easily perform spatial and location 
analytics to properly segment customers.
While many utilities participate in social media, few use social media tools 
to help in their marketing. In addition to the customer segmentation, utilities can 
mine social media to determine what customers are thinking (and tweeting) and 
where they are located. Utilities then can perform spatial analysis on demographic 
data and social media data to uncover how customers may react to a specific pro­
gram well before they even launch the campaign.
Economic Development
Utilities can perform a different kind of marketing that attracts new business into 
their service territory. Unlike target marketing, in which the targets are existing cus­
tomers, utilities will market to prospective customers. What a utility is marketing 
is not a product or service, but an actual pricing structure or discount on electric 
prices if a new business locates within their service territory. 
The reason a utility would do this is to increase the utilization of their in­
frastructure, particularly in areas where the infrastructure is lightly loaded. If a 
substation or feeder is loaded to only 50 percent of its rated capacity, then a utility 
could generate additional revenue without having to invest in infrastructure if they 
can encourage a business to relocate to where the electrical capacity is plentiful. 
Here the utility can use the GIS to answer the question: find vacant parcels or 
buildings of a certain size connected to the targeted substation or feeder. They can 
add other criteria, such as finding a parcel near a freeway off ramp or near a com­
mercial airport or close to rail transportation.
Utilities can create a GIS spatial analysis model that allows the utility to vary 
the requirements (e.g., parcel size, available parking, costs, and distances). Again, 
like in target marketing, the GIS matches a customer need to the utility’s offering. 
For target marking, location is critical.

GIS Enhances the Retail Business
GIS and Customer Care
The customer care organization in a utility is essentially the retail business. The 
installing, testing, management, and reading of the meters are fundamental to bill­
ing, and so this is one of the most critical aspects of the customer care processes. 
GIS allows utilities to locate where problems are, provide locational data as to how 
to respond, and provide logistics support for the meter process. As more utilities 
implement smart meters and AMI, they will want to leverage the consumption data 
and map it and analyze the patterns. This will provide input into their demand 
response programs.
The new customer connection work order process for new business is a key 
business activity. Customers will rate utilities on how fast and responsive they are 
to their requests. Utilities need to be agile since they don’t know when these re­
quests will happen. They can use GIS to help manage this process and even auto­
mate many of the more routine requests.
Location matters for billing and collections. Utilities continue to struggle with 
collection activity. Utilities can use GIS to locate areas where delinquent accounts 
are most prevalent and help them craft programs to mitigate collection activities by 
matching customer behavior with collection activity. 
The call center staff often provides the only interaction between a customer 
and the utility. Giving them the right tools and the visibility to what is actually go­
ing on within the service territory goes a long way toward improving employee mo­
rale, since an uninformed employee in a call center is apt to get frustrated quickly. 
Giving call center staff tools such as being able to locate a burnt out street light, 
knowing where repairs crews are working, and seeing where customers have been 
disconnected for nonpayment helps to provide superior customer service.
Finally, GIS provides a fundamental tool for marketing activities, from target 
marketing for products and services to influencing behavior for operational issues 
or new construction issues to economic development activities. Utilities will need 
more than rate class to differentiate their customers if they plan to fine-tune their 
demand response and other marketing activities. Since customers are distributed 
throughout the service territory, location matters. That’s why GIS enhances the 
retail business for utilities.

GIS and Shared Support Services
Electric utilities have used GIS (or at least digital mapping) for several decades. 
However, the primary use has been for documenting the location of facilities and, 
of course, creating operating maps. So the users have tended to be engineering 
and operations employees. As noted throughout this book, even in those organiza­
tions, GIS has not played a prominent role in spatial analysis or location analytics. 
Neither has GIS played a role as a framework for integration of many kinds of 
data and systems. The use of geospatial technologies to view information coming 
from real-time systems (like SCADA, DMS, weather, and traffic systems) semi-real-
time systems from meter data management (MDM) systems, predictive engines like 
lightning and flooding prediction services, in additon to identifying the location of 
work orders and crews have not been widely adopted, although this seems to be 
changing.
So while plenty of opportunities for GIS in engineering and operation are still 
untapped, there are many opportunities in areas that rarely utilize geospatial tech­
nology. Yet much of what an electric company does, even outside of operational 
areas, involves the dimension of location. For example, where are utilities spend­
ing money, having environmental issues, having customer satisfaction problems, or 
having higher than average motor vehicle accidents? Where should utilities locate 
their warehouses, storage yards, and spare parts? What land do they own? What 
land use licenses are about to expire? Where do employees live? This chapter de­
tails how GIS can support the many other departments within a utility and how the 
information from operations and engineering can influence decisions in the support 
areas and the other way around. A true enterprise GIS would serve a maintenance 
worker repairing a coal conveyor in a power plant to the CEO watching spend­
ing distributed throughout the distribution system. Figures 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 show 
the processes associated with shared services activities in a typical electric utility 
company.
Managing Land Information in GIS
A GIS is of no value without information about the land. Utilities select sites 
for power plants. Transmission lines deal daily with issues of the right of way.

Distribution utility trucks drive up and down city streets. Retailers need to know 
where customers live. Clearly, the GIS has to have a model of the land features. 
Most utilities deal with land information in several organizations, namely, the real 
estate, the surveying, and the rights and permits groups. 
GIS for Real Estate
The real estate group manages land holdings of the utility: buys and sells property, 
pays real estate taxes, and perhaps maps the holdings. The survey group creates 
the property attributes of holdings, easements, and licenses and records the legal

descriptions of all property the company has interest in. They may also make maps 
of the utility’s various land holdings and easements. The rights and permits group 
requests various grants of location and permits from the government to be able to 
install electrical facilities in the public ways. They, too, will create maps showing 
where the utility will need rights and permits. They may also create maps that show 
the result of the grant from the government. They will record any time limits on 
any grant, right, or license. They will record any and all conditions associated with 
an easement. 
The Land Base
Regardless of who actually manages these functions, the end result is informa­
tion about land ownership in the form of maps. Each of these groups act indepen­
dently—the data they create is often contained within their own group and is hard 
to share. Even if they use GIS technology, these maps and systems are rarely part of 
an overall enterprise GIS.
In addition, many utilities maintain what they often call a land base for their 
GIS or digital mapping system. This land base consists of the land features such as 
street layouts, building footprints, points of interest, and other land features such 
as water bodies and rail lines. It is not uncommon for utilities to keep different 
versions of the land base for different departments. For example, a map-based fleet 
management system might have a digital file for the land base that comes with a 
fleet-tracking system. The transmission group maintains a different land base for 
the transmission line and the distribution group keeps a separate one as the founda­
tion for their digital mapping system or GIS.
Often the problem is that none of the land bases match, yet conceptually, they 
are modeling the same information. They might have different projections, come 
from different sources, have different degrees of accuracy, or have no formal ac­
curacy standards whatsoever. As noted previously, layers of information form the 
basis for a GIS. If the land base data set is not accurate, then the location of the 
electrical device layers will be equally inaccurate. In these cases, utilities find that 
when they want to combine different GIS data sets together, they do not coordi­
nate. In the case of a distribution line that shares a pole with a transmission line, 
the two systems often will show the distribution pole in a different location than 
the pole in the transmission system, even though they share the same pole. If the 
utility then were to accurately locate the pole using a GPS device, they may find 
that neither the pole in the distribution GIS nor the pole in the transmission system 
has a GPS-accurate location.
As commercial GIS map content providers create more and more accurate digi­
tal data, utilities discover that they find it difficult or very expensive to leverage the­
ses sources because their land base, as well as their facility locations, is incorrect. 
As noted, utilities call their land information layer a land base, while today 
most commercial providers use the term base map. The solution to this base map 
issue is difficult, since utilities must abandon their old land bases and adopt accu­
rate base maps or conform their land base information to known control points. In 
either case, they must adjust the locations of all their assets to the new or corrected 
land base. Conflation is the process of adjusting facilities to new locations. The end 

176 
�������������������������������
GIS and Shared Support Services
result of conflation is that the facilities are in the correct location within a defined 
level of accuracy. Conflation projects are labor intensive and expensive. 
There are several issues with the current practice of having each department 
maintain their own land base, accurate or not:
••
Utilities do not control the information in the land base data, so they won’t 
know when the city or county cadastral agency changes the information un­
less utility personnel proactively check with the agencies. Of course, this is 
expensive and hit-or-miss.
••
The authoritative information managed by the real estate, survey groups, 
and rights and permit groups have no easy way to coordinate the data with 
the utility’s multiple versions of their land base.
••
The real estate, survey, and permit group data needs to be accurate, so even 
if the utility wanted to incorporate the data into their land base, it probably 
wouldn’t match.
••
Utilities have to spend money digitizing changes to the land information. 
They are, in effect, duplicating the work that someone else (a city, town, 
or cadastral agency) has done already. If the utility maintains multiple land 
bases, the situation is simply worse.
The Simple Solution
The utility can decide to abandon the process of maintaining land base data sets 
and rely solely on information provided by others who either have direct responsi­
bility for the data (such as a city or county), rely on an agency that is charged with 
maintaining good land information (such as a cadastral agency), or rely on a com­
mercial base map provider that has done all the adjustments and coordination with 
the various jurisdictions. The real estate group, survey group, or rights and permit 
groups then could have ownership for the acquisition and republishing of this land 
base data via a web service to anyone in the organization needing core digital land 
information. In other words, these support groups would be responsible for the GIS 
for land information, which would include information they get from outside the 
company plus information they capture about their specific interests, like company-
owned parcels or company-granted rights and easements. 
This land base or base map then serves the entire enterprise and none of the 
operating groups has to manage it. In this way, as soon as the responsible party 
(the city or cadastral group) updates any aspect of the base map, the utility would 
automatically have access to the latest information.
Preliminary Information
Sometimes utilities need information about land features before the features are of­
ficial. For example, a developer may have a preliminary subdivision plan approved 
and submits this plan to the utility as part of a request for the utility to design the 
electrical network for the subdivision. Since the subdivision is still in the planning 
stage and the developer has yet to build anything, the utility would need to include 

Managing Land Information in GIS 
177
that data in the base map in order to do the proper planning for the electrical sup­
ply of the subdivision. In this case, the utility could create a “proposed” layer in 
the land base of the GIS. Since the agency in charge of the base map would provide 
access to the utility via an automated service (such as a Web service), the utility 
would have immediate access to the updated information about the subdivision. 
Once the new subdivision has been included in the official base map, the utility 
would simply delete the proposed layer. This proposed layer could show much 
more detail of the street construction, which would be helpful during the building 
of the electrical infrastructure. However, after contractors complete the street, this 
information is not particularly useful going forward. So the extra details needed 
during design and construction only need be available during that limited time. The 
permanent base information would consist of only information needed for ongoing 
operations.
Using the official base map instead of the utility maintaining its own base map 
solves another problem. Often a utility will only have access to the preliminary subdi­
vision street layout and have no knowledge of any changes between the preliminary 
subdivision layout and the final approved as-built layout that the developer submits 
well after they complete construction of the subdivision. The utility could be main­
taining incorrect information and not know it. It is common for changes to occur 
between the time a developer submits a preliminary plan for approval and the 
completion of construction. These could include relocation of the street align­
ment, shifting property lines, and the addition of easements. By incorporating 
official plans the utility is assured access to actual street layouts, building foot­
prints, property lines, and easements. This will help the utility in the future when 
performing maintenance or working on new construction.
Utilities can separate the maintenance of the land information from the opera­
tions groups and centralize it in a support group that already has responsibility for 
land information. The group can serve as a broker between the outside agencies (or 
agencies) that have direct responsibility and control over the data. They can then 
provide the data to the operating groups in a way that gives them easy and consis­
tent access to just the information they need and no more. 
Different Levels of Accuracy and Display
The traditional way that utilities deal with land base is to treat the land features 
like the electrical and structural features. So street boundaries, building footprints, 
rivers and railroads are often intelligent features within the GIS databases. Yet for 
the vast majority of workflows, an operating group needs to see only the electrical 
and structural features displayed along with the land features. They do not need 
to edit the land base data. Utilities can structure the land base data for fast display. 
Caching this data in effect takes a “picture” of the core intelligent data. Display­
ing the results of a cached data set is orders of magnitude faster for panning and 
zooming than having to re-create images of streets from raw vector representations. 
Caching also involves establishing varying levels of detail depending on the zoom 
level a user needs. If a user is zoomed into a display at, for example, 1 in = 200 ft, 
the cached data set could show street level detail, building footprints, street labels 
every 5 in at a type size of, say, 8 points. If the user zooms out to a display scale 

178 
�������������������������������
GIS and Shared Support Services
of, say, 1 in = 1000 ft, then the level of detail should be less, since the user cannot 
possibly see a high level of detail from being zoomed that far out. The GIS displays 
street names at much farther apart intervals. The GIS no longer displays building 
footprints but more generalized footprints at this zoom level. Zooming way out 
would eliminate the display of many of the side streets entirely. The idea is that 
at each zoom level, a different “picture” of the base map is displayed. As the user 
zooms in, the resolution increases, but the extent of the image decreases, meaning 
that in effect, the same number of pixels are being displayed. With enough zoom 
levels, zooming in and out appears to be seamless. Behind the scenes, the GIS man­
ages exactly what data is being accessed to be displayed. 
Optimizing the Use of Land Information
A better way to manage land information is to do the following:
••
Centralize the management and publishing of base maps in a support group.
••
Utilize as much commercially available or centrally available (from a ca­
dastral agency or from a commercial base map provider) base map data as 
possible.
••
Optimize the data for display performance for all users of the GIS.
••
Supplement the data with near-real-time imagery to aid in restoration efforts 
or emergency management. This frees up the operations group to only have 
to deal with information they control.
••
Work arrangements with other utilities (e.g., gas, water, telecommunications, 
cable TV, and public transit) that serve the same area to receive their data as 
a web service. Optimize those layers for performance.
••
Add as much data from as many sources as possible, such as municipal 
boundaries and overlays—wetlands, zoning, school districts, state and coun­
ties, and location of sensitive areas.
••
Add generic services like geocoding, street-level routing, and real-time 
weather and traffic services so that if the users needed these layers, they 
could easily turn them on.
Users can easily manage this data in a private cloud, where each user can access 
the information from any device wherever they are. In effect, the company could 
repackage a number of data sources and services and publish these services as web 
services that the users from any department could utilize. One of the key depart­
ments that would need this data is the environmental group.
Environmental Issues 
Utilities involved in all phases of the business have to be concerned with their im­
pact on the environment. Certainly, utilities that generate power from fossil fuels 
are intimately involved in emission management. Most will have sophisticated air 
monitoring equipment. Governments require utilities to rigorously report emissions 

Environmental Issues  
179
and any deviation from environmental regulation. Wind farm operators and de­
velopers are concerned about bird migration, noise pollution, and strobing effects. 
Transmission operators are concerned about where to build lines and substations, 
and containing insulation oil from contaminating waterways and wetlands. They 
worry about endangered species nesting in towers. Distribution operations likewise 
need to be concerned about spills from oil-filled equipment. When siting any equip­
ment, utilities must deal with the impact of their plans on the surroundings. 
There are several areas in which GIS can be deployed to help manage environ­
mental issues:
••
Monitoring—since most monitoring of air, water, and noise pollution in­
volves the location of the sources and the extent of the impact, GIS is a 
natural tool for reporting the current state of emissions, spills, and pollution.
••
Environmental risk assessment—GIS can alert utilities about the risk of a 
nearby environmentally sensitive area by performing a spatial analysis.
••
Project management of past incidents—GIS can also be used to manage the 
recovery of past environmental incidents by showing what’s happening, the 
extent of cleanup, and the progress toward completion.
••
Site selection—GIS can alert planners and developers of utility projects of 
areas of environmental concern during the planning process. GIS is a critical 
tool for environmental impact report, which models the project in relation 
to environmental impacts.
GIS and Environmental Incident Management
Nearly every aspect of the monitoring of environmental issues involves location. 
This management involves understanding exactly where the environmental con­
cerns exist. For example, the utility monitors the emissions from a power genera­
tion source. The measures then determine exactly what the emissions are at that 
location. Utilities can map the real-time measures and see the impact on those areas. 
If emissions exceed tolerable levels due to a malfunction of equipment, utilities can 
use GIS to identify what areas are impacted and notify authorities in that area as 
to the extent of the issue and under extreme situations to evacuate people from the 
area or at least notify them of the situation. So GIS links the extent of the event to 
those impacted.
When a piece of oil-filled equipment ruptures, utilities must do everything they 
can to contain the oil. However, that isn’t always possible. So they must model the 
dispersion of the oil and remediate any damage. Most governments will require the 
utility to report the event within a very small time window. The GIS is often the 
best tool to illustrate where the spilled oil went. GIS can pinpoint the location of a 
particularly sensitive area and determine if the path of the spill will reach that area. 
Figure 8.4 illustrates a GIS map that shows where spills have occurred.
So GIS can function as an environmental situational awareness tool that brings 
together monitoring of air, water, and noise contamination in relationship to the 
areas that may be impacted. From that awareness, utilities can make rapid deci­
sions to notify and to respond.

Risk Assessment
This book has illustrated the natural use of GIS for determining risk, which is 
vulnerability plus consequence. Spatial analysis and particularly weighed overlay 
analysis allows utilities to combine risk factors and impact factors together from a 
spatial perspective to determine the relative risk over a wide area. Environmental 
risk assessment works the same way. Spatial analysis looks at the proximity of a risk 
source, for example, a large oil-filled transformer to a known sensitive area, such 
as a vegetated wetland. The vulnerability of the source is the age of the equipment, 
maintenance history, evidence of leaking, history of failure, and the duty cycle. 
Other vulnerability issues might be proximity to salt contamination, corrosion due 
to high acid rain levels, and critical equipment near earthquake areas. A GIS spatial 
analysis model then plots a heat map or hot spot analysis of areas with highest vul­
nerability of an oil rupture against the highest impact of an incident (proximity to 
a sensitive area). The outcome of this analysis would be a risk mitigation plan that 
might include building higher drainage berms around the equipment or installing 
retention basins. The analysis helps utilities focus their environmental risk mitiga­
tion activities to those areas with the highest vulnerability and the highest negative 
consequences—in other words, mapping the environmental risk profile.
GIS for Environmental Remediation and Compliance
Utilities face clean up or remediation when an environmental event occurs. Some­
times the cleanup can be fast with no long-term environmental damage. Other 
times, the damage can be more problematic and may require long-term clean up 
and continued monitoring and reporting. Utilities will then need the GIS to map the 
extent of the damage, show the actions they are performing to restore the area, and 
provide progress to the environmental regulators to assure them that the utility is 
complying with whatever remediation plan they and the regulators have agreed to. 
Often noncompliance can result in stiff fines and bad press, so the more transparent 
the process is, the better for the utility.

Environmental Issues  
181
GIS for Planning in Relationship to the Environment
Planning for low environmental risk is essentially the same exercise as risk mapping 
for electric equipment failure or the risk of environmental damage, except the goal 
is to plan to minimize future risk. While every significant project involves some en­
vironmental impact, utilities can avoid costly project delays if they plan for the least 
environmental impact upfront in the initial planning process. If the utility wishes to 
build a new transmission line, as noted in Chapter 3, they could perform a spatial 
analysis that minimizes disruption of sensitive habitat, wetlands, or beautiful vistas. 
By building the environmental impacts into the site selection process, utilities can 
avoid some of the permitting issues. 
Continuously monitoring environmental issues during site selection, engineer­
ing design, and construction can help avoid costly surprises, help facilitate trans­
parency, and ultimately assure a better overall project.
Vegetation Management
Transmission and distribution maintenance groups manage the vegetation along 
transmission rights of ways and city streets. See Chapters 3 and 4 for a discussion 
on the subject of vegetation management, specifically in relation to transmission 
and distribution maintenance.
The intent of vegetation management is to control the growth of vegetation, 
typically trees, to provide adequate clearance between the trees and overhead elec­
trical conductors. Utilities are looking more holistically at the subject of vegetation 
management. In the past, utilities have simply mowed down right of ways, clearing 
anything and everything down to the bare ground. Often, that had the effect of 
stimulating the vegetation growth. Today, utilities understand that low-growing 
bushes can inhibit the growth of fast-growing trees, so utilities might even plant 
low-growing bushes along rights of way to inhibit the growth of fast-growing trees. 
Rather than simply clearing a transmission right of way of all vegetation, they 
instead encourage growth of certain species while chemically treating others to 
inhibit their growth.
GIS provides a way of organizing the work of vegetation along a corridor. It 
allows utilities to analyze areas (polygons in the GIS) of similar growth and treat­
ment patterns. Utilities can look at factors, such as the average rainfall within the 
polygon, the soil type, drainage patterns, and other environmental factors that 
help the vegetation manager find the right treatment, cut, and planning plan suited 
specifically for the area for the purpose of preventing trees from growing into or 
near the lines.
Vegetation management for rights of way using GIS involves a change in pro­
cess from simply mowing a right of way every 5 or 6 years on a schedule to cleverly 
determining which areas need the most attention and have the greatest impact. Us­
ing the old cyclical approach, parts of the right of way may not need treatment that 
soon, while other sections of the right-of-way may need attention much sooner. 
Since vegetaion growth is not uniform over the entire right-of-way, using GIS to 
fine tune vegetation management saves money and avoids costly outages.
Vegetation management for distribution involves trimming trees along the city 
streets. GIS utilities find that they can better manage tree trimming contractors by

segmenting the work by work area, performing audits of the work, and document­
ing within the GIS exactly what work was done, as well as the characteristics of 
the area to be trimmed (e.g., the dominant species and any unusual situations, like 
trees that are unusually at risk of falling into the lines). Further, the GIS can assist 
in better analyzing the need for certain areas to be trimmed on a more frequent or 
less frequent basis by performing a spatial analysis of the tree trimming work areas. 
Instead of simply scheduling a 15-mile feeder to be trimmed every five years, 
the GIS can create areas of greater or lesser need for trimming based on factors 
such as rainfall, soil types, tree species, types of overhead line construction (open 
wire versus spacer cable), and many other factors. The same principles that the risk 
models have can be applied to tree trimming. Trim the areas that have the greatest 
risk of tree growth or encroachment into the lines and delay the trimming areas 
where there is less risk of tree encroachment, based on a consistent GIS spatial 
analysis model.
Utilities can add impact to the tree trimming plan. For example, they can assess 
what areas of the distribution system have the biggest impact on customer reliabil­
ity should a storm come through. Or they can correlate what feeder sections have 
the poorest reliability or power quality performance. The GIS can identify those 
areas. By performing a vulnerability and impact assessment, utilities can focus their 
efforts on what areas to trim and when that will give them the highest payback for 
their vegetation management dollars. Vegetation management for some utilities can 
be the highest expense after labor and materials. Some utilities have used GIS for 
vegetation management for years, while others continue to cling to the past prac­
tice of simply scheduling vegetation management by feeder or municipality.
Logistics and Supply Chain
Movement, storage, procurement, testing, and repair of materials is the job of the 
supply chain or logistics organization. Sometimes the management of buildings 
grounds is also one of the functions of the supply chain organization. These activi­
ties are essential to the successful operations of the utility and often rely on spatial 
information. The three major components of supply chain are as follows:
••
Materials management;
••
Fleet management;
••
Facilities management.
Each of these groups deals with heavily with location. Historically, GIS has not 
played a strong role in these organizations. The purpose of this section is to exam­
ine what role GIS could potentially play.
Materials Management
Utilities are a very material-intensive industry. Maintaining a century-old infra­
structure can be a significant challenge and requires a constant supply of parts 
for repair and replacement. The infrastructure is growing as well. Utilities need a 

Logistics and Supply Chain 
183
stream of new equipment to meet the demands of a growing society hungry for en­
ergy. Keeping track of all that material can be daunting. Not doing a good job can 
be extremely costly. Groups within the materials management organization include 
purchasing, inventory, warehousing, asset tracking, and often materials testing.
A common GIS application in materials management is determining the best 
location for a service center or warehouse. Utilities, particularly distribution utili­
ties, break up their service area into districts. They build one or more service cen­
ters within each district. They store and dispatch crews and vehicles from these 
locations. Utilities use service centers as local warehouses, where they store a se­
lection of material, such as transformers, wire, cable reels, switches, and poles. 
There, they will keep lobby stock (e.g., connectors, small hardware). Sometimes, 
they will locate vehicle repair facilities within the service center. These facilities 
are often self-contained operations centers. The issue for utilities is whether these 
service centers are in the optimal location. Are there too many, just enough, or not 
enough? Should the company consolidate or add new service centers? The decision 
impacts the logistics of how the company responds to routine and emergency work.
Over time, the demographics of the area served by the service centers change. 
What may have been an ideal location for a service center 20 years ago may not be 
valid today. Logistics organizations routinely use GIS to answer these questions.
Solving the Serviceability and Accessibility Problems with GIS
The GIS problem is to find the driving distance from the existing or proposed ser­
vice center along all possible routes. The idea is to determine if the driving distances 
are too long to meet service levels. This requires a network analysis of all possible 
routes from the service center on out. If, for example, the utility wishes to get to all 
locations within a given time frame, it can create a map that illustrates the driving 
distances from that location. The GIS solves the problem: find all routes that are 
within, say, 20 minutes of each service center. The results may show overlapping 
areas or large gaps in the ability to serve other areas. 
The GIS can determine how easy it is to get to various equipment or custom­
ers in the service territory in terms of travel time or distance or a combination of 
both. In effect, the GIS creates a buffer around the service center based not on a 
polygon buffer, but a distance buffer using the streets and the street characteristics, 
like speed limit or traffic lights. 
Utilities then can optimize the location of service centers based on criteria such 
as customer population, density of equipment, and even criticality of the areas 
served. The GIS can provide location allocation, which answers the query: given 
the set of existing service centers or proposed locations, provide the best response 
times to cover the community, as well as find the optimal cost for servicing an area. 
Fleet Management
Utilities have large fleets. Many of their vehicles are heavy duty, expensive to 
maintain, and require care in handling and dispatching. Most heavy duty utility 
trucks have poor fuel efficiency. Crafting a fleet management strategy to lower 
miles driven while still performing the same amount of work is essential. Work 
can range from delivering materials to visiting customers to repairing or reading 

184

meters (the old-fashioned way). GIS provides the basis to solve the vehicle rout­
ing problem—not just finding the shortest path from one location to another, but 
minimizing the total miles driven for a fleet or a work group. Figure 8.5 illustrates 
a GIS with the optimal routing identified. The benefits of fleet optimal routing are 
many. The fewer miles the fleet drives, the fewer accidents will occur. By reducing 
the total travel time, the wear and tear on the vehicles decreases. Finally, shorter 
total distances traveled translate into lower labor costs. People will accomplish 
more work during the day. Travel time can represent a significant portion of a field 
worker’s day.
Navigation and Automated Vehicle Location (AVL)
Utilities simply need to know where their crews are. Crews also need to know 
where they are in relationship to where they need to go. AVL systems use GPS to 
identify the location of each vehicle in real time. Since the GPS locations are also 
available within the GIS, a dispatcher can receive the vehicle’s GPS location and the 
GIS can display the location of the vehicle. Each time the GIS refreshes the display, 
the GIS redisplays the location of the vehicle in its new location. So the dispatcher 
sees “in effect” the motion of the tracked vehicle in the GIS. While AVL systems 
are effective, they can be more effective if they are integrated with the enterprise 
GIS. Most often, the AVL system (even if based on a GIS-like system) only shows 
standard base map information such as streets and standard points of interest. Inte­
grating AVL technology with GIS allows dispatchers and crews to see utility assets 

Logistics and Supply Chain 
185
along with the vehicle location. In effect, the utility assets become points of interest. 
So a crew could navigate from their current location to a damaged pole, where the 
pole is discoverable within the AVL.
Since vehicles are critical utility assets, the integration of AVL technology with 
the enterprise GIS adds these critical assets to all the other assets the utility must 
manage within one geospatial technology.
Vehicle Routing Problem
The GIS solves the problem of how to sequence and schedule a fleet of vehicle visits 
to a group of locations taking into account certain time windows that the locations 
are available to be visited. For example, assume that a fleet of meter repair crews 
needs to visit customers to repair, test, or replace their meters. The utility has prear­
ranged a time when the customer or electrician is at the site. The idea is to complete 
the routes with the available crews within the time imposed by the schedule. This 
assumes specific driver shifts, speed limits, and any obstacle the dispatcher knows 
about. GIS solves this problem by the simultaneous processing of the routing in an 
iterative manner, converging on the optimal solution of routes and visits. Other fac­
tors can be included, like the efficiencies of the specific vehicle.
The GIS can determine the best route taken by a utility crew. It could be the 
shortest, the quickest, or the one that gets the vehicle closest to the depot or service 
center. The GIS effectively assigns an impedance (not electrical impedance) to the 
route. Time or distance can be an impedance, depending on what parameter the 
dispatcher wants to minimize.
Closest Facility
Another common routing problem is the closest facility solver within the GIS. Here, 
the problem is to find the closest crew to a trouble location, like a blown fuse. Once 
the closest facility (a trouble shooter crew, for example) is found, the next problem 
is to find the shortest path (distance or time) from the problem location to the near­
est crew. Figure 8.6 shows the results of a closest facility solver model.
Routing in real-life situations needs to take into account real-time situational 
data, such as the status of traffic lights, traffic itself, rainfall, road repairs, and 
bridges out of service. The analysis can also take into account the time of day the 
routing is taking place (e.g., at night when traffic is light or during the summer 
when visibility is clearer).
Asset Tracking—Fixed and Mobile
GIS can help utilities keep track of where fixed and mobile assets are located. For 
example, a utility may want to track the location of hazardous material they are 
shipping from a warehouse to a disposal facility, noting exactly when there is in­
creased environmental vulnerability along the route.
During major outages, when winds, downed trees, or floods damage many 
pieces of equipment, utilities can lose track of what material went where. Crews can 
be more concerned about getting the power restored than worrying about exactly 
which transformer or switch they installed. However, later, during the recovery 

186 
�������������������������������

stage, utilities need to know the disposition of each piece of critical equipment. Us­
ing GIS to track assets can help. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags can be 
included as an attribute of the asset. 
Utilities use the concept of geofencing for asset tracing. Dispatchers create a 
polygon within the GIS that they use to demarcate an area they want to track. 
They may want to make sure material stays within the area, and they want the 
system to notify them when material enters or leaves the area. This technology is 
often combined with GPS tracking and RFID technology. Figure 8.7 illustrates the 
notion of geofencing. 
Facilities Management
Utilities own and operate a number of facilities in addition to the assets dedicated to 
power generation, transmission, and distribution. They have service centers, ware­
houses, storage yards, office buildings, vehicle repair facilities, and storage sheds. 
They own some and lease others. How they manage facilities could well determine 
how well the entire operation works. Utilities use GIS to help them manage these 
valuable assets. 
As noted throughout this book, many utilities view GIS as an electrical net­
work documentation system. That is, its use is limited to dealing with electrical 
facilities, such as cables, wires, poles, and transformers. Utilities will use the GIS to 
help manage those assets, identifying where the assets are and what their condition 
is and determining what they need to do about them. However, utilities also need 
to make sure that they properly maintain support facilities, and they likewise need 
to know whether to repair or replace components of these facilities. GIS is a tool 
that can help utilities organize their maintenance and asset management of support 
facilities. For example, they need to keep track of the facilities maintenance activi­
ties of the facilities maintenance crews and contractors. They need to know where 
Figure 8.6  GIS map shows the results of a closest facility solver.

Logistics and Supply Chain 
187
work is going on and what impact that work has on their operations. They need 
to clear brush, plow snow, landscape, remove graffiti, paint and replace windows 
and doors, repair roofs, and a host of other activities. The GIS can provide a way 
to visualize and organize that work.
Facilities maintenance is part of supply chain and logistics. As such, it is criti­
cal to be able to view how support facilities play a role in the electric operations. 
Electric operations needs to have visibility into what support services have been 
scheduled, should conflicts occur.
Green and Space Planning
Utilities can use GIS to help utilities in their space planning. This can be for both 
personnel as well as equipment. They may need to discover where best to stage 
equipment in advance of a weather event or a major project. Utilities have employ­
ees that need office space. GIS can help with employee space planning as utilities 
attempt to optimize their use of office space and assure that employees are as close 
to their work as possible. 
While the vast majority of emissions from utility operations come from carbon 
sources of generation, utilities must also be aware of their use of energy for support 
services, particularly in their use of energy for their facilities, such as office build­
ings, warehouses, and service centers. GIS can help utilities track and report on 
their progress toward green buildings and energy management within their facili­
ties. They can use GIS to analyze their energy use and potentially discover ways to 
save energy within their own support facilities. Since utilities have many employees 
in office spaces, they need to manage the cost of these spaces by making those 
spaces as energy efficient as possible.

Finance, Accounting, and Corporate Management
While utilities rarely use GIS outside of operations, they may find that seeing finan­
cial, accounting, and corporate management information in a spatial context can be 
helpful. For example, a utility may want to know where the company is spending 
money on operations or maintenance so they can better determine the reasons for 
spending in certain areas compared to others. 
The term location analytics describes a process whereby business intelligence 
information, such as spending on maintenance or new construction, can be dis­
played in the form of a digital map. The map can show areas of spending based on 
asset investment, per customer, per district, or even by time intervals. Once the GIS 
captures or creates the information, then it can publish that information as a ser­
vice, like a web service or a map service. Then the GIS can merge or mash up other 
data to help the utility uncover the underlying factors that might have contributed 
to the variations in spending across the region served by the utility. The analysis is 
quite similar to other spatial analysis processes for routing a transmission line or 
detecting where a distribution utility is at risk during a storm. 
So financial managers can gain insight into not only the where of the spending 
but perhaps even the reasons for the variation in spending. A simple analysis might 
show the variation in spending on maintenance correlated with weather patterns 
or wind conditions. Salt spray along the coast will have a much more corrosive 
impact on equipment near the coast then further inland. While business intelligence 
systems provide consolidated reporting of metrics, adding a spatial context often 
provides additional insight into what is really going on.
Plant Accounting and Taxes
A fundamental requirement of a regulated utility is to accurately report the value of 
its assets. There are several compelling reasons for this:
••
Transparency to investors;
••
Rate setting;
••
Property tax accounting.
Utilities need to account for their assets for transparency to investors and for 
the accuracy of their balance sheet. In the U.S., for example, the Security and Ex­
change Commission has strict reporting rules to protect investors. Thus, utilities 
are obliged to accurately report on their investments. Not having an accurate ac­
counting of their plant can cause embarrassing audits and fines.
State or federal authorities approve rates proposed by the utilities. For exam­
ple, every state in the U.S. has a public utility commission that does exactly that for 
the investor-owned utilities that operate with the state. An important factor in rate 
setting is the determination of the rate of return granted the utility on its invest­
ments based on the value of its assets. If a utility files a rate case, they must be able 
to prove that they have correctly accounted for all their assets and the valuation of 
their assets. Knowing when they installed a pole or wire is critical. If they underre­
port their asset base, they face getting a smaller rate relief than they are entitled to. 

Finance, Accounting, and Corporate Management 
189
Overestimating their asset base will result in overcharging their customers, which 
if discovered could lead to serious consequences. 
In most places in the world, utilities pay property taxes to local, state, and 
federal governments based on the assets they have installed within a particular tax­
ing jurisdiction. If utilities over report their assets, then they will pay too much in 
property taxes, which simply ends up as an unnecessary expense on their income 
statement. If they underreport and are audited or discovered, they become respon­
sible for paying back taxes.
The ideal situation is that utilities record their plant assets consistently and 
with a single source of data. The GIS is the ideal location for the collection and 
documentation of the utility assets. As noted in Chapter 4, utilities use GIS for de­
signing new facilities within the overall work order process, so the GIS keeps track 
of what assets the utility has added and retired. They can extend this process to 
automate the task of keeping an accurate count of assets. One of the most funda­
mental functions of the GIS is to count things, within areas. Linking the GIS into 
the design process as outlined in Chapter 5 creates a documented process as utilities 
add new and retire old assets. This makes the documentation clear and the validity 
of the equipment counts defendable. 
Some utilities find that the records as recorded in their plant accounting sys­
tems do not match those held in their engineering systems (e.g., on their operat­
ing maps). By using the work order process and the GIS, the GIS becomes the 
authoritative source of asset data. Once the utility posts within the GIS that they 
have installed and put into service an asset, the GIS can publish a service or app 
that lists which asset has been added or retired, including data about when it was 
installed originally, where it is located, and the date and time they utility installed 
or removed the asset. The plant accounting system can then accurately determine 
the value of the plant at any point in time. 
Sales Tax
In some jurisdictions, utilities have to collect sales tax on the use of electricity. The 
sales tax will depend on a number of factors, many of them spatial. For example, a 
school district, a water district, a special political boundary, or any number of spe­
cial districts might determine sales tax. Some of these districts might even overlap. 
A hard way to determine the sales tax is to have the billing system carry complex 
tables of where each customer location is compared to a particular tax district. The 
GIS handles districts as a matter of routine. The billing system can issue request to 
the GIS passing an address of a new customer and the GIS determines which tax 
districts the address is located within. The billing system can then simply apply the 
rate associated with the set of districts the GIS returned to calculate the sales tax on 
the use of electricity.
Revenue Protection
The term revenue protection refers to theft of current. This can be a serious issue in 
many parts of the world, with some nations seeing illegal connections siphoning off 
more than half of its potential revenue. In most developed nations, theft of current 

190 
�������������������������������
GIS and Shared Support Services
is a much smaller issue but still can be a significant loss of revenue. There are two 
parts of this concern. The first is gaining an understanding of the problem itself. 
The second is in the enforcement and prosecution of the people stealing the electric­
ity. For most utilities, particularly those with very high theft, they do not have a 
good handle on the extent of the problem or where the problems are most severe. 
Here, GIS can help frame the problem, identify where theft is greatest, and perhaps 
use the GIS as a tool to uncover some of the underlying problems. For example, if 
there are areas of extreme poverty, the GIS can identify those areas and correlate 
those areas with a high degree of theft. Enforcement in these cases may not be ap­
propriate. Rather, documentation to relief agencies or appeals to the government 
may be the best approach. The GIS helps utilities make the compelling cases.
For the more routine cases of theft of current, the GIS in combination with 
smart meter data can easily pinpoint where consumption at the service level doesn’t 
match consumption at the supply level. The GIS can also use other sources of data 
such as presumed vacant property that shouldn’t have consumption but the data 
says otherwise. Theft of current drains the resources of an electric utility. Having 
a rational plan of recovery using the tools of GIS can help utilities gain control of 
the problem and focus their efforts on those areas that offer the greatest chance of 
success.
Safety
The safety of employees and the community is of great concern to all electric com­
panies. There are at least two ways that GIS can play a role in the company’s safety 
program. The first and most obvious way is to visualize where accidents and safety 
issues have occurred. Utilities can form the company’s safety performance into an 
online story map, which shows each accident, safety statistics by region or division, 
and even some additional insight into why safety issues may be higher in one region 
over another. Certainly weather might be a factor in motor vehicle accidents. The 
frequency of motor vehicle accidents may be impacted by street lighting (or lack of 
street lighting), curves in the road, treed areas versus open areas, and any number 
of factors that vary by location. Utilities can spatially enable their safety reports, 
giving senior management better insight into the nature of accidents (motor vehicle 
or otherwise). By combining accident statistics with network maintenance activi­
ties, utilities can discover patterns of where accidents are more likely to occur. Us­
ing temporal data in conjunction with spatial data can provide additional insight. 
Knowing where and when accidents tend to occur provides utilities with additional 
tools to gain better insight into the times and places to be most diligent. 
The other important aspect of the safe operation of an electrical network is 
having accurate information of where all the assets are located and giving field 
workers ready access to the most up-to-date information. Accidents tend to oc­
cur when a combination of bad things happen at the same time. For example, 
utilities train employees to assume all energized equipment is alive, even though 
they have been told the equipment is de-energized. They are supposed to test to 
make sure a current-carrying device is dead before working on the equipment. In 
addition, they are supposed to wear protective equipment even when working on 
de-energized equipment. However, employees don’t always test, don’t always fol­
low procedure, and don’t always wear protective gear. A GIS can act as a safety 

Finance, Accounting, and Corporate Management 
191
net to give employees the most accurate and up-to-date information about where 
equipment is located. If employees are using old marked-up prints to locate equip­
ment, they run the risk of going to the wrong location, setting themselves up for a 
potential accident. 
Security
Most utilities have a corporate security department. The mission is to protect the 
network and all its assets from harm. They must monitor the comings and goings 
of all employees, contractors, and guests. GIS often plays a role in conjunction with 
security systems, which use video monitoring systems. For large facilities such as 
a power plant the locations of the cameras are linked to the location on a map of 
the facilities. Since most utilities have many facilities located throughout the service 
territory, it becomes difficult to monitor exactly where every monitored device is 
located. The GIS serves as a dashboard to guide the security personnel to the loca­
tion of any security violation. 
Other Corporate Functions
The term spatially enable has been used throughout this book. In its simplest form, 
the term refers to taking company data that has any kind of spatial representa­
tion, such as a coordinate, a longitude and latitude, an address, a zip code, or a 
block identification, and simply map the information within the GIS. For example, 
utilities know the addresses of all their employees. Should an emergency occur and 
they have to call in employees to help out, it could be helpful to know where the 
employees live in relationship to where they are needed or where there are hazards 
for their employees to drive near. Utilities can spatially enable their human resource 
systems. Once spatially enabled in GIS, they can combine that spatial information 
with other maps, such as maps of work, problems, or security breaches.
On a regular basis, senior management reviews the key performance indica­
tors (KPIs) of the company. In the vast majority of cases, they can spatially enable 
those KPIs and often gain additional insight about what is going on. Often KPIs are 
averages. Mapping the KPIs gives management better insight into where hot spots 
(areas where the KIPs are showing the biggest problems) are located and what the 
demographics of those hot spots represent.
Utilities will do customer satisfaction surveys. While their rankings may be 
acceptable, it would be instructive to map where they are having satisfaction prob­
lems. Then they can combine this customer satisfaction data with other data, such 
as high bills or any other metric to gain a better understanding of what is really 
going on. Then they can craft more focused solutions to improve customer satis­
faction. They may discover that their tree trimming program, while good for reli­
ability, is creating ill will in certain neighborhoods. This is very easy to visualize 
in a GIS but virtually impossible to ascertain from reams of charts and graphs. 
Figure 8.8 shows how a utility can simply map the results of a customer satisfac­
tion survey within the GIS. While this information is certainly interesting in and of 
itself, the utility could overlay demographic information to uncover what types of 
people tend to be unsatisfied. They could also overlay reliability data or any other 
data that might give the utility greater insight into how customers are feeling about 

192 
�������������������������������

their electric service. Utilities could also overlay social media data so they gain even 
further insight into why customers are feeling the way they are.
GIS Is Critical to Shared Support Services
Most utilities think of a GIS as an engineering system designed to support op­
erations. And it does. However, the same technology that determines the risk pro­
file of a transmission line or the optimal path of a new transmission line can be 
used to model many other processes within an electric utility, whether or not the 
government has unbundled the generation, transmission, distribution, and retail 
businesses. As in most other companies, utilities do marketing and outreach, deal 
with materials and buildings, and have employees and accidents. For many of these 
functions, if not the vast majority of them, location matters and mapping business 
functions can be transformative. It allows utilities to see patterns that are difficult 
or impossible to see any other way. 
A modern GIS is not a departmental system where data sharing is difficult. The 
simple task of mapping a business function throughout the entire enterprise with 
the ability to combine maps with different data creates a discovery process. If visu­
alization alone is not enough, GIS can perform sophisticated spatial analysis that 
combines layers of information into a single map that often surprises users who see 
patterns that they have never seen before.

GIS 101 for Electric Utilities
Utility users need to understand what makes up a GIS, even if a cloud vendor or 
someone else mangers the GIS. The key to understanding the technology of the GIS 
is a concept called the GIS information model. While there are as many definitions 
of information model as there are opinions of what it means, for the purposes of 
this book, it consists of three components:
1.	 The data model—exactly what data the GIS directly manages;
2.	 Information products—this is the definition of exactly what the users will 
see;
3.	 Workflows—exactly what the GIS does to the data to produce what the 
user will see.
Data Model
Whether the utility manages the GIS in house completely or using SaaS (software 
as a service), someone has to define what data to be included in the GIS. This is the 
data model. As noted all throughout this book, each business unit has a unique set 
of things that is important for that business in relation to some kind of location. For 
example, a customer care organization needs to know where every customer meter 
is located. A transmission organization needs an inventory of every tower and its 
location as well as every other piece of equipment.
At the heart of the data model is the notion of a feature. A feature is anything 
that the GIS represents, like a street, a cable, a switch, or a lightning arrestor. It can 
also represent a boundary, such as that of a city or country or it can represent the 
result of an analysis. 
There are three kinds of data commonly used by the GIS:
1.	 Vector;
2.	 Raster;
3.	 Network.
In each case, the GIS stores characteristics or attributes about each of the ele­
ments in these three data types.

Vector Data
If one were to view a line on a computer screen, the line actually represents a series 
of pixels that are displayed close enough together to give the appearance of a line. 
To store all these pixels would take considerable storage, particularly if the line is 
long and the resolution of the screen is high (meaning many pixels on the display). 
An alternate way to store the line would be to store the fact that the feature is a line 
along with parameters that define the line, such as the coordinates of the end points. 
Thus, there are two ways to store data about a line: in raster form or a large set of 
pixels or in vector form, which is a small set of values that define the mathematical 
parameters for the line. 
The advantage of vector data is storage is small. The disadvantage is that in or­
der to actually display the feature (e.g., the line), the computer system must convert 
the vector representation to raster. So that process takes computing cycles. Raster 
data types have large storage requirements, but the data is in the correct form to be 
displayed without much translation. 
Vector data tends to be in the form of point, line, and area or polygon fea­
tures. A fourth kind of feature is a volume feature, in which the feature can be 
represented in three dimensions. In all cases, the feature data is a collection of co­
ordinate pairs (or triplets, if considering three dimensions); a point represented by 
one pair; a line by two; and polygon feature by as many coordinator pairs as there 
are vertices. An area feature by definition has to close in on itself. Area or polygon 
features often represent phenomena like areas of similar elevation or sensitive areas 
like vegetated wetland areas or corridors which represent the best area to route a 
transmission line. 
For simplicity and ease of visualization, GIS modelers represent electrical fea­
tures as one of the core data types for standard two-dimensional representation of 
mapping information. A pole is certainly not a point on a two-dimensional plane. 
However, most modelers use a single point to represent a pole feature. The point is 
actually located at the center of the pole on the ground. Conductors are cylinders, 
but most modelers abstract them as lines on the map with no width. 
Vector Layers and Features
To some extent, the data model is similar to the database schema of a standard 
relational database management system (DBMS). A standard DBMS stores unique 
entities in tables. The tables are very similar to spreadsheet work sheets. Each table 
has a number of rows and columns. So, if a DBMS were managing utility poles, it 
would create something called a pole table. The table would consist of rows and 
columns, with each row representing a specific pole, while each column in the table 
would represent attributes of the specific pole. In other words, the column headings 
would represent various characteristic possibilities for a pole, such as pole height, 
class, date manufactured, and date installed. The column headings represent the 
possible attributes of the entity or feature. In a GIS vector data model, the same 
structure exists. There is a table for each feature classification. 
The difference between a standard DBMS table and a GIS database table is the 
inclusion of geographic representation, the shape (point, line, polygon, volume), 
and the values for the location (sets of coordinates). Just like a normal relational 

Data Model 
195
DBMS, GIS tables can have cardinality relationships (one to one, one to many, 
many to many). GIS tables can have relationships to other non-GIS tables as well.
While it is possible to have a table for every single variation of a feature, such 
as one table for wood poles and one for steel poles, most modelers group features 
of similar type and shape (point, line, polygon, and volume) into single tables. 
The GIS data model consists of a set of tables, defining attributes, and relation­
ships. As in most DBMSs, the GIS data model defines behavior, such as the domain 
or range values of certain attributes. For example, a rule would be that a 5-ft or 
500-ft pole is not an acceptable value for pole height. In fact, only specific poles 
values would be valid, such as 35 ft, 40 ft, 50 ft, and 75 ft. The data model would 
not allow other values. Disconnecting devices are also modeled as point features 
(although, some utilities model these types of devices as line features, since they 
have two or more terminals), but have a completely different set of attributes. So 
the GIS data model will include a disconnecting device table. The disconnecting 
device table would include a variety of different types of disconnecting devices, 
such as fuses, circuit breakers, and reclosers. The model would include other tables 
such as are high-voltage conductors, transmission towers, guy wires, and medium-
voltage transformers. The features represented by a single feature table must have 
the same shape (point, line, or polygon or volume).
Layers represent the way the GIS displays features. A layer displays a single 
feature. In a typical GIS, the software presents the user with a check box next to the 
layer label. When the user checks the check box, the GIS software displays the lay­
er. A display could show a base map, the medium-voltage overhead feeder sections, 
and only the disconnecting devices, but not the low-voltage or transformer layers. 
Any combination of layers is possible for display. Most GIS software systems are 
smart enough to provide additional filtering to display features with certain char­
acteristics, like voltage level or condition.
The idea is that the data model defines the complete list of features that the 
modeler wants to include within the GIS, plus all the attributes that needs to be 
included in the GIS as well as relationships of features to each other and the rela­
tionships of features to other data sources outside the GIS. An example of a feature 
in which data is accessed outside the GIS is a SCADA point. The GIS defines the 
shape—in this case a point, the location of each specific point, a relationship to 
other features (e.g., a substation breaker and some kind of identification attribute, 
say, the SCADA point identification). The SCADA point identification is the same 
point identification that exists within the SCADA system. Thus, the SCADA system 
would export a table or publish a Web service listing the real-time value or values 
of the SCADA point on a periodic basis. The GIS then accesses the web service or 
the table to retrieve the current value of the data. Thus, the GIS could display the 
real-time data from SCADA on the map while not storing any of the real-time data. 
Any event data can be treated the same way. 
Raster Data
Early utility GISs did not use raster data for anything other than the scanned images 
of their old paper maps and records. This was not so much to take advantage of the 
unique abilities of raster data, but more in an attempt to avoid having to convert 
old paper drawings to vector format.

GIS 101 for Electric Utilities
Raster data, as noted earlier, consists of a matrix of cells or pixels. Most people 
are familiar with raster displays. Television displays are series of cells, with each 
cell firing a point with a color and intensity. The resolution simply is the number of 
pixels or cells. The idea is that each cell contains one and only one point. The value 
of the point determines the color and the intensity or shade. When viewed from 
afar, the picture looks like a continuous display or image. 
A typical raster data set used for a utility might be vegetation type over a trans­
mission right of way. Each pixel could have a value of 1 to 10, where 1 represents 
the area with very slow growing vegetation and 10 represents an area with very 
fast growing vegetation. When the GIS displays this image, it has a rule that states 
a value of 1 is very light green, whereas a value of 10 is very dark red, with various 
color combinations in between. The result is a map that shows continuous color 
patterns from light green to dark red. The darker red areas represent the areas the 
utility has to perform intensive vegetation management compared to the lighter 
green areas, which show the areas that the utility can put off vegetation manage­
ment for longer periods of time.
The data model for this data set is quite simple: the data model is the descrip­
tion of what the pixels represent (e.g., elevation, vegetation, or risk). It also in­
cludes a definition of what values the attributes of the pixel mean. Examples are 
dark is bad, light is good, red is bad, and green is good. 
In some situations, raster data sets can represent discrete features. For example 
a river can be represented as a series of pixels in which the pixels of the river are 
colored while the other pixels are not. 
Raster Layers
A full-featured GIS includes both raster and vector images together. Typically a 
raster data set is a single layer, turned on or off. For example, a customer care em­
ployee might want to look at meter consumption in relationship to the population 
demographics of age. The meter consumption data might be point vector informa­
tion, with each point representing a single meter or service, while the demographic 
data is a raster data set, with each pixel representing an average age bracket of 
people living in the area represented by the pixel. Together, they could show a cor­
relation of age with consumption patterns. The GIS could also convert the vector 
consumption data into a raster image as well, in which the pixel shows the average 
consumption values of all meter points that lie within the area represented by the 
pixel. 
Network Data
A network data set is a special case of vector data and is especially valuable for 
electric utilities. In the case of a simple vector feature, each feature represents a 
shape: point or line. The fact that a point and a line occupy the same space or are 
very close may or may not be significant. A network data set defines that a set of 
features participates in a network. That is, the network data set defines connectiv­
ity. So, a disconnecting device, which may be a point feature, represents a node in a 
connected network, whereas a conductor represents a line in a connected network. 
If a data model defines both the disconnecting device table and the conductor table 

Data Model 
197
as belonging to the network data set, then the GIS assumes that if they share one 
end point, they are connected. This is the notion of GIS network data. 
The application of a network data set for electric companies is obvious—the 
network data defines the relationship of current-carrying features to one another 
for the purpose of network tracing and to define the network connectivity for 
network calculations like load flow or short-circuit analysis. A less obvious use of 
network data is in structural networks, such as underground duct bank networks. 
These networks contain manholes, vaults, hand holes, boxes, pipes, and tunnels. 
These networks can be fairly complex. Planners can automate the routing of power 
or communication cables through the network automatically if the models define 
structural elements as part of a structural network. 
The term raceway is a generic term for any piece of equipment designed to 
hold or contain cables, power or otherwise. Examples of raceways include above-
ground cable trays (in power plants and substations), tubes, conducts and junction 
boxes (underground or mounted on walls). So even within a power plant or sub­
station (or in fact any industrial facility), modelers can create extensive raceway 
networks. These networks can connect to other structural networks outside the 
substations or power plants. This gives utility operators the ability to determine 
routing throughout all of the various utility facilities. For example, a utility many 
want to understand the location of a medium-voltage feeder from the last manhole 
outside the substation, within the substation basement conduit system, to the cable 
tray feeding the specific circuit breaker. This would be particularly valuable to 
know during a mishap such as a fire at the substation. The raceway network is, in 
effect, the containers for the electric network equipment. The raceway network can 
also provide an undesirable pathway. For example, during a flood, water will flow 
through the raceway network. Or, the raceway network could provide a pathway 
for smoke, fire, or pests. 
The other common use of a network data set is for routing of vehicles to proj­
ect sites, warehouses, customers, and inspection locations. As noted in Chapter 
8, GIS can provide significant benefit within the utility’s supply chain operation. 
Much of the benefit comes from the use of a network data set within the GIS.
The Data Model Development
For vector data sets, there are a number of techniques for developing an electric 
utility data model. Most GIS vendors provide templates to get started. The process 
to create vector data sets often starts with a description of very high-level kinds 
of data (e.g., conductors, transformers, disconnecting devices, and customer loca­
tions). Then, each high-level type is broken into more specific types, such as over­
head conductors and underground cables. 
The raster data models often consist of the different types of raster data sets 
required for utility use, such as base maps of streets, topological data sets, and 
imagery. In each case, these raster data sets have multiple representations for vari­
ous display scales. For example if the utility wanted to view the location of their 
facilities at a small scale (zoomed way out), the image is low resolution. As the user 
zooms in, the GIS uses a different raster image at a much finer resolution showing 
more detail, but at a much smaller extent. As the user zooms further in, the GIS 
calls an even finer image, showing just a few blocks of data, but at a very sharp 

198 
������������������������������
GIS 101 for Electric Utilities
resolution. Eventually, the GIS reaches the highest resolution data set. As the user 
zooms in further, the image blurs, since the pixels simply get further apart. Techni­
cally, there is no limit to the detail with which the GIS can display imagery. The 
only limit is the availability of an extraordinarily high- resolution imagery data set. 
Of course, the greater the resolution the larger the data set is (since the data for 
each pixel has to be stored) and the more expensive and difficult it is to capture.
Modelers create network data sets by assigning certain features to a named 
network, such as medium-voltage network or a secondary network duct bank net­
work or a pipe type cable transmission network.
Information Products
As stated earlier, an information product is what the user will see. In the not-so-
recent past, the user would see only output products from their GIS. These were a 
set of standard map products that utilities created with the GIS or in the past on 
paper. In the vast majority of cases, utilities printed the maps on a plotter. In the old 
days, utilities printed the maps on translucent paper so they could be copied using 
blueprint technology. Once copied, utilities shipped the maps to the various depart­
ments. Of course, this process was awkward, time consuming, and expensive. The 
most obvious problem was that as soon as a department received their new paper 
print, the print was out of date. 
While paper maps are still common, utilities are migrating to the use of mobile 
technology (laptops, tablets, and smart phones). Then, the user gets the most up-
to-date version of the GIS. However, this change may not be particularly transfor­
mational, since the output product might well be the same image as the paper map, 
just more current. The more subtle and transformational change is the idea not so 
much of output products, but of information products. That is, the users get just 
the right information they need at that time for the job they need to perform. 
Designers of the original paper maps (a century ago) created all-purpose maps. 
They had to, since they had to draw each map by hand. They couldn’t afford to 
create hundreds of specialty maps for every conceivable process or workflow the 
consumers of their maps might need. So they invented standard map products, like 
one-line diagrams, feeder maps at standard scales or grid maps. Each of these maps 
contained as much information as possible so as to make the map-making process 
as efficient as possible. With the advent of digital mapping, the new mappers repli­
cated the old maps, only digitally. They then printed them to look exactly like the 
old maps. 
With the advent of mobile devices, users continued to demand the same look 
of the old maps on their mobile devices. The good news or bad news, looking at 
it from different perspectives, was that mobile devices were limited in the amount 
of information they could reasonably show. The good news was that designers of 
mobile information products, while limited by display capability and screen real 
estate, were not constrained by the variability or variety in what they could show. 
For example, an old-fashioned feeder map displayed labels for a number of equip­
ment parameters, whereas a mobile map user can simply hover over a symbol for 
a transformer for example and see its kVA, voltage, or impedance rating. This cre­
ated the opportunity to create an infinite number of displays. 

Information Products 
199
This led to the notion that information products were not defined by a strict set 
of layout requirements but were more about what information could be presented 
to users, not what information is presented. Thus, as displays become less clut­
tered, the information presented becomes significantly enriched and more sharply 
focused. The shift is from standardized static maps to interactive maps where the 
information created is on user demand.
The transformation from standard output products to information products 
means that what people see is simpler, more relevant to their job at hand, and more 
effective and more consumer like. 
What are common information products for utilities? They really are driv­
en from use cases for common tasks that utility workers perform. For example, 
suppose workers have a job to make sure that the utility complies with a state 
or federal regulation that all pad-mounted transformers must be inspected every 
other year. They can use a simple GIS tablet app that tracks the location of their 
vehicle, creates a buffer around their location, searches for a pad-mounted trans­
former location (even if it is buried in snow or hidden from view), and queries the 
work management system (integrated with GIS) to see if the pad-mounted trans­
former was recently inspected. If the answer is yes, then nothing happens. If it 
is no, the app alerts the users that they passed a pad-mounted transformer that 
they need to inspect. The app displays the transformer and a simple form filled in 
with only the attributes required for the inspection, along with the location of the 
transformer. The workers then stop their vehicle, discover the equipment, do the 
inspection, complete the form, and are on their way. The users could also take a 
picture or video of the equipment as well. Behind the scenes the app collects the 
inspection information, wirelessly transmits the new information to corporate, and 
delivers it to the work management system. In this case the information prod­
uct is simply a map that displays the workers’ location and a transformer only if 
the transformer meets a certain requirement—in this case, one that they need to 
inspect. This same information product scenario could be applied to any inspection-
related activity. 
The key to the information product is the use case—what specific tasks do 
workers need to perform? For example, the distribution planners need to analyze 
feeders for future loads. Repair workers need to inspect and repair equipment. In 
the old days, the distribution planners and the repair workers might have used the 
same cluttered output products. Since the GIS is an information system, it can serve 
information to meet the specific needs of the user. 
The information product is linked closely to the use case:
••
Who is doing what?
••
What is the exact information they need to perform their task and no more?
••
For each step along the way, what visualization do they need that helps them 
to proceed to the next step?
The key is what information they need to do their job. Too much information 
will slow the workers or the process down. Too many buttons or options creates 
confusion and increases training.

Workflows
The third component of the information model is the set of workflows that the 
GIS applications need to perform. There are thousands of tasks in an electric util­
ity that could involve the use of spatial information. Many of the major ones are 
documented in the main body of this book.
A workflow links the data model to the information product.
In the previous example of the inspection process, there were several work­
flows—most of them automated. The GIS facilities information model of course in­
cludes a complete inventory of every electrical piece of equipment, structural equip­
ment, and customer equipment, all linked to their correct spatial position. The GIS 
data model also includes specific identification tags for each piece of equipment to 
which the GIS could link other systems within the utility, such as the work manage­
ment system. The workflow for this simple inspection app is as follows:
••
Compare the inspector’s vehicle location to the known location of all pad-
mounted transformers.
••
Query the information contained within the GIS facilities model for pad-
mounted transformers only at a location within a fixed buffer distance. 
••
Once the GIS app discovers a pad-mounted transformer within the buffer 
zone, query the work management system (all behind the scenes using some 
form of integration technology).
••
If it discovers that the equipment complies with the inspection criteria, the 
app does nothing (or performs some other function, like notifying the inspec­
tor of some special situation—for example, there was a fault on the second­
ary of the transformer and it might be worth checking anyway).
••
If the transformer is not in compliance, the GIS app alerts the inspector. The 
app highlights the exact location of the transformer on the map.
••
Presents the inspector with a panel indicating what fields the inspector must 
fill in to complete the inspection. It might even show the prior inspection 
results.
••
The inspector completes the inspection, fills in the form, and indicates 
“Complete.” If a photo or video is required, the inspector can take a picture 
or video. The picture or video is linked with the inspection report. 
••
GIS app automatically records the date and time of the inspection.
••
Transmits the data to the corporate network where the appropriate systems 
are updated with the current information.
Of course, there are variations on this workflow. For example, if the inspec­
tors discover a pad-mounted transformer that is not in the GIS or one that is in the 
wrong location, that would trigger a new app with a new workflow. This is a very 
simplified example of an inspection use case. 
For each of the business applications, utilities need to create use cases that 
define each step, what information is needed for each step, what visualization is 
needed at each step, what the user needs to do (for example fill in a form or take a 

Spatial analysis 
201
picture), what the app will do after the user does something and what visualization 
needs to happen then. This process is repeated for each step in the use case. 
Spatial analysis
One of the most powerful workflows a GIS performs is spatial analysis. There are 
perhaps hundreds of spatial analytic algorithms. Some of them are fairly complex. 
However, most companies can easily implement them if they have the data. The 
most common for utilities consists of the following:
••
Queries—where is something?
••
Counts—how many are there?
••
Relationships—where is something in relationship to something else?
••
Buffering—what is surrounding something?
••
Overlays—how can we combine disparate spatial data sets?
••
Union and intersection analysis—how do things relate or not?
••
View shed—what impact does terrain and elevation have on viewing?
Queries
A spatial query can be as simple as finding the location of something by an address, 
ID, or equipment number. An example is to have the GIS find the location of a pole 
by its pole ID or pole number. The user types in the pole number and clicks. The GIS 
app zooms to the location, highlights the pole, and perhaps highlights some other 
aspect of the pole. Maybe it has a street light attached or was recently replaced. 
More complex queries are indirect. For example, “Find all the lightning arrestors 
within District A that were made by Acme Lightning arrestor and installed between 
April 1996 and March of 2003.” This query looks at all the lightning arrestors in 
District A, then narrows the search to only those that meet the query requirement.
The result of a spatial query is a selection set (i.e., the set of features that meet 
the requirement). Often in a spatial analysis, the GIS saves the selection set and 
uses it for further analysis. Suppose, for example, that the reason for the previous 
query was that Acme Lighting Arrestor Company’s products manufactured during 
a certain period failed more regularly during high periods of lightning or in areas 
more susceptible to lightning. The selection set can be combined with a lightning 
frequency and intensity map to alert the utility to replace those arrestors only in the 
severe lightning areas. The idea is that after the query, a selection set of arrestors is 
available for further analysis.
Counts
Utilities will often want to know how many of a certain type of equipment are 
located within certain boundaries. For example, a utility may want to know how 
many street lights they operate within a municipal boundary or how many street 

202 
������������������������������
GIS 101 for Electric Utilities
lights have not had their lamps replaced over the last three years within a certain 
maintenance area. The result of the analysis is not a map, but a number. Plant ac­
counting departments would like to know how many poles were damaged during 
the last storm so they can account for the replacement costs. GIS performs spatial 
analysis to determine how many things are included where.
Relationships 
Utilities want to know how far their equipment is from something else. Often, that 
“something else” is something to be avoided. For example, many utilities operate 
vehicle repair facilities. Some utilities even have body and paint shops. They need 
to know how close these facilities are to sensitive environmental areas, such as 
vegetated wetlands. Should a spill occur, the utility needs to know well in advance 
how fast to respond and how best to mitigate the risk of damage and resultant fines 
and bad press. There are still concerns about the impact of electromagnetic waves 
to health. Utilities can determine if there are sensitive populations or facilities in 
relationship to transmission lines. 
A relationship analysis might be “show me the distances from all nuclear pow­
er plants to population densities.”
Buffering
Buffering is similar to relationships except that a buffer analysis determines a fixed 
distance from a feature. Once the GIS establishes the buffer, the spatial analysis de­
termines what is contained within the buffer. The common use of buffer analysis is 
the answer to this question “find all the property owners within a certain distance 
from the proposed location of a new substation project boundary.” The buffer cre­
ates a boundary a fixed distance from the substation parcel. The GIS then produces 
a selection set of only those parcels contained within the buffer. An option of the 
query would be either completely contained or partially contained within the buffer 
zone. The result of the query is a list of parcel owners within the buffer that must 
be contacted. The resultant selection set would have to contain parcel numbers that 
could be linked to the parcel owners.
Buffering can also be used to determine if there are any zoning or other kinds of 
land overlays within a work zone. For example, some jurisdictions require a special 
permit to do work within a certain distance from protected lands, such as habitat 
protected areas or even burial grounds. Buffer analysis can help uncover areas that 
the utility may want to avoid, whether performing design, site selection, or looking 
at where to route transmission lines. 
Overlays
Overlay analysis is one of the most powerful aspects of GIS and spatial analysis. 
Society has used the concept of overlay analysis for centuries to help people visual­
ize the relationship of one factor to another. The idea is to create a series of scaled 
drawings of something, each drawing created on a transparent layer. When an ana­
lyst lays the drawings on top of each other, they can see the relationship of the vari­
ous factors. For example, if crime analysts wanted to gain a better understanding 

Spatial analysis 
203
of certain patterns of crime, they could create a street map and then create a trans­
parent layer of where certain crimes have occurred over the last several years. They 
could then create an additional transparent layer of where known drug activity was 
happening and another layer of where abandoned houses were located. When all 
the layers are lined up and layered on top of one another, the analytics could dis­
cover if there was a correlation of certain types of crime with poverty or abandoned 
property or drug use.
With a fair amount of work, the analyst could create a new map that illustrated 
where the three factors of a certain type of crime, together with drug use and aban­
doned property come together. In effect, GIS does this automatically by using the 
process called overlay analysis. Before an overlay analysis can be performed, the 
data sets must be converted or have the same coordinate system.
In concept here is how it works for raster data sets:
1.	 Each pixel in the data set has a value. For each data set, the GIS must 
normalize the values to the same scale. For example, if analysts wants to 
create a risk assessment using a flooding zone data set and lighting intensity 
data set, the GIS must first convert the flood map from different flooding 
depths (feet) to an flood intensity map (on a scale of 1 to 10, for example). 
The GIS must create a lightning intensity map (again on a scale of, say, 1 
to 10) from a basic insulation level (BIL) scale to a lightning intensity scale. 
In each case, the number 10 represents the highest possible risk, whether 
lightning or flood risk. The GIS does this process for each data set in the 
analysis. 
2.	 Now each pixel value for each data set is based on the same scale. The GIS 
then simply adds up the values of each pixel in the same location, which are 
lined up geographically.
3.	 The GIS then creates an additional data set based on the combined pixel 
values and displays the results.
4.	 The analysts can optionally assign a weighing factor to each data set, so 
when the GIS adds up the values for each pixel, it uses the weighting fac­
tors. This allows the analyst to perform a sensitivity analysis based on a 
combination of different weights for each factor.
5.	 The GIS (or user) can assign different textures or colors to the map data set 
based on the value of each of the pixels. The common practice is to assign 
dark colors to the areas that have the highest pixel values.
6.	 The final data set then can be stored as a new data set and used in subse­
quent analysis.
If in fact, there is a confluence of factors within a certain area, the resultant 
data set will have different areas with different colors or shades of colors. This type 
of map is called a heat map, since the result (if there is a correlation of factors) will 
show the most intense areas in the darkest colors. 
The GIS can also perform this analysis using vector data sets. For example, 
suppose analysts want to discover which older underground conduits lie in areas 
of unstable soils. The GIS stores the values of the underground conduits in a vector 
data set, whereas the data set for unstable soils is a raster data set. The GIS would 
convert the vector data set to a raster data set. The age of conduits would be stored 

204 
������������������������������
GIS 101 for Electric Utilities
with the pixel value that represented the location of the conduit. The GIS would 
then normalize the resultant conduit raster data set on a scale of, say, 1 to 10, with 
10 being conduits older than say 50 years old. The GIS would then normalize the 
soil stability map having a similar scale. So the overlay analysis would simply add 
the pixel values. If an old conduit pixel shared the same location as an unstable soil 
pixel, the resultant pixel value would be 20. So the resultant map would show a 
conduit map, with at-risk conduits (old and in unstable soils) painted in dark red.
Union and Intersection Analysis
GIS can combine different data sets using a process of union and intersection. This 
analysis is similar to overlay analysis. If, for example, analysts want to understand 
where two different demographic groups overlapped in their customer opinion sur­
veys, they could perform an intersection analysis. In this case, GIS discovers where 
the values within each data set are the same. Again, the data sets have to be nor­
malized to the same values. Instead of adding the pixels, as was done in overlay 
analysis, the pixels are checked so see they have the same value. If they do, then 
the GIS creates an new output data set that includes only those areas that have the 
same pixel value.
Unions work in a similar way. A union data set attempts to combine two or 
more different data sets into one. So, depending on what the analysts want to ac­
complish, the union process combines pixels of one data set value or range to a 
data set range of the other data sets and creates a resultant data set in which areas 
of interest are combined together.
View Shed Analysis
A common problem for utilities is visualizing what a proposed facility will look 
like after it is built. This is a common question asked during public hearings. The 
view shed analysis requires an input raster data asset. The concept is that each cell 
or pixel within the raster data set is assigned a value (normally a 1 or 0) depending 
upon if an observer, such as a neighbor near a wind turbine, can see each point of 
the raster data set. The resultant data set illustrates what if anything the observer 
can see. 
View shed analysis is also helpful in the determination of wireless coverage for 
smart meters that use cell technology. The smart meter is the observer, and the loca­
tion of the receivers are part of the raster input image. If the cell tower or receiver 
cannot be seen by the smart meter, then the utility must find an alternative location 
or additional location for the receiver. 
Learning More About Spatial Analysis
This presentation of spatial analysis is meant only to convey the ideas behind the 
concept. Perhaps the best source on spatial analysis is the excellent three-volume 
series by Andy Mitchell, The Esri Guide to GIS Analysis, which is referenced in the 
bibliography.

Coordinate Systems and Accuracy 
205
Coordinate Systems and Accuracy
It goes without saying that any GIS should start with some form of standard coor­
dinate system, so that utilities can take advantage of widely available data sets. GIS 
can perform transformations from one coordinate system to another. Some utilities 
built their GIS from base maps that have no specific coordinate system. They will 
find it more difficult to perform spatial analysis, since the data sources they could 
get from the other sources will not line up with their data. Different levels of ac­
curacy can co-exist if they are all based on the same coordinate system. This is not 
the case if the utilities created their base map or land base information from some 
arbitrary coordinate or no coordinate system.
If utilities want to integrate their workflows with GPS tracking, then they must 
migrate from their old legacy mapping systems to a coordinate system consistent 
with GPS.
Cloud and Web-Based GIS
Over the last several years, the web has allowed many users to publish their map-
based data. This means that utilities can take advantage of a huge number of data 
sets hitherto hidden in file cabinets of governments, commissions, organizations, 
and agencies. These data sets range from environmental overlays to soil types to 
crime statistics (utilities can use these as well) to flood and sensitive areas to zoning 
maps. Other utilities, such as water and sewer utilities, can publish their utilities 
over the web to be consumed by the electric utilities. Utilities can access accurate 
base maps so they don’t have to maintain their own. Likewise utilities can publish 
their work over the web for use by other agencies (with proper security, of course). 
The era where data has to be stored locally to be used in the GIS is over. Modern 
GIS can consume data sets created by others stored in the cloud easily. GIS can un­
derstand the data by reading the metadata (data about the data) so that it can easily 
consume and transform the data sets.
This will make spatial analysis more powerful and more common. Utilities will 
be able to share spatial data sets across their organizations like people currently 
share social media data. 
More Study Is Required
Volumes and volumes of technical work have been written on the technical aspects 
of GIS. The reader is encouraged to dig deeper into the use of GIS for improving 
utility workflows. There are many other examples of spatial analysis that can be 
applied. Only the most common examples are cited here. The purpose of this ap­
pendix was to give a conceptual understanding of GIS, not to provide precise work­
flows. Certainly every GIS project has its own unique way of implemention. The 
purpose here is to give the reader an appreciation of the most common uses of GIS 
for use by the electric utility industry.

The Facility Model, GIS, and Smart Grid
Smart grid has a number of different meanings, and the term is often overused. 
Many utility people would argue that the electric grid is in fact very smart. Smart 
essentially means automated. When a problem occurs on the electric transmission 
system, such as when a high-voltage line comes too close in contact with a tree, 
the line flashes over. What happens after that happens automatically. Relays detect 
the rapid change in current and take virtually instantaneous action. Huge circuit 
breakers interrupt the high current in a number of locations, isolating the faulted 
transmission line. If for some reason the breaker fails to operate, a stuck breaker 
scheme starts and opens additional breakers to clear the fault and stop the flow of 
fault current. Failing to do this quickly and automatically can create a situation of 
instability leading to all kinds of catastrophic situations. So the transmission system 
is quite smart.
Smart Grid Automates the Distribution System
Distribution substations have smart logic that triggers when something bad hap­
pens as well. Breakers open, systems transfer loads, historian systems and data 
warehouses record and store events. These smart systems have been around for 
decades. Utilities have installed more and more automation at substations using 
modern digital technology to replace the older analog systems. So why is there all 
the discussion today about the smart grid if the grid is already smart? What isn’t so 
smart in today’s electrical network is what’s going on in the medium-voltage and 
low-voltage networks. Many utilities have been totally blind to what goes on with 
an individual customer in real time or even within hours.
Smart Meters Are the Heart of the Smart Grid
The vast majority of smart grid work involves the conversion from simple electro­
mechanical meters to smart meters. Utilities around the world are installing smart 
meters. Smart meters measure electricity consumption and other factors like voltage 
and power factor at very small time intervals. The intervals can be seconds. Utili­
ties have been using interval meters for years for large commercial and industrial 
users. However, in these cases, the meter stores the interval readings locally in the 
meter itself. Simple residential meters typically are mechanical and simply record 

208 
���������������������������������������
The Facility Model, GIS, and Smart Grid
an accumulated consumption. Utilities commonly read interval meters and simple 
meters monthly using various techniques by sending people to the meter location 
to get the data.
Smart meters use telecommunication technology to transmit the meter reads 
automatically and are able to receive messages from the power company to the me­
ter to take an action. That action may involve taking additional readings or simply 
shutting off the electrical supply. Most smart meters are able to communicate to 
other devices such as customer equipment directly. 
Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) collectively describes the smart meters 
plus the telecommunications technology and the systems to process and capture the 
information. A meter data management (MDM) system processes the meter data 
for billing and dissemination. For many people, an AMI is essentially the technol­
ogy of smart grid. Smart meters can notify utilities of a power failure, momentary 
interruption in power, and voltage sag, and some even can detect harmful harmon­
ics in the lines.
Aside from the obvious benefit of not having to send meter readers to the field 
every month, the real long-term benefit of the smart meter is to be able to control 
the consumption—to be able to turn on and off individual loads inside a customer’s 
facility for the purpose of demand control. Or, in the simplest application, to sim­
ply shut off the supply of power on the day the customers move out or when they 
don’t pay their bill. 
AMI Will Introduce Dynamic Pricing
Another aspect of AMI is the future ability of utilities to provide dynamic pricing of 
power. Say, for example, the wind is blowing like crazy, the weather is mild, and it’s 
on a weekend. Even during peak times, the cost of the power may actually be quite 
low due to increased use of wind power and solar energy. On the other hand, during 
the hottest part of the day, dispatchers predict there could be a shortage of power, 
and the pricing of power may be quite high. Without interval consumption data, 
the utilities and the customers have no way of knowing whether they are using or 
conserving during high or low consumption times. Today, the total energy used in 
the billing period (typically one month) determines the customers’ bills. With smart 
meters, utilities can link the price of power with the cost of power on a very short 
time interval. Further, customers will be able to query their usage to better manage 
their cost of power.
Self-Healing
Another element of smart grid is the installation of equipment to help make the dis­
tribution network smarter and more responsive to problems. Since smart meters are 
sensors, they can help determine what’s going on in the medium- and low-voltage 
networks. In addition, as part of the smart grid initiatives, utilities are installing 
additional sensor devices and automated switching systems in the medium-voltage 
network and maybe someday even in the low-voltage network to respond much 
more quickly to power failures. 
Without human intervention, given the smart meter data, the medium-voltage 
sensors, and automated switches, the medium-voltage network can reconfigure 

Smart Grid Automates the Distribution System 
209
itself (like the transmission system does today) to minimize the number of cus­
tomer out of power. Utilities call this self-healing. Today field troubleshooters and 
dispatchers switch and reconfigure the network manually. Self-healing processes 
can restore large numbers of customers in seconds automatically.
What Really Is Smart Grid?
So smart grid really means a few different things:
••
Demand response between customers and the utilities with the ability of 
customers and utilities to measure consumption in a very short interval and 
respond when necessary to control or manage consumption.
••
Automation of the medium voltage system to restore customers much faster. 
With the addition of sensors on the network, the utility can do a better job 
managing the voltage of the lines to optimize power flow and lower losses.
••
Automation of the integration of renewable resources and energy storage of 
the system.
The idea is that the smart grid is the merging of two networks, the traditional 
electric network with an intelligent communication system for the purpose of man­
aging consumption and improving reliability.
What Does GIS Have to Do with Smart Grid?
The smart grid needs the facility model of the electric network to figure out what 
the sensors are communicating. The GIS provides the single source of information 
about the configuration and data of the electrical network. Since the smart grid 
adds new equipment to the electrical distribution system, it will become more im­
portant to understand the relationship of this new equipment to the existing grid. 
The facility model described in Chapter 4 serves as the basis for nearly all smart 
grid initiatives.
In addition to the facility model created by the GIS, the ability of the GIS to 
perform additional data manipulation and analysis provides greater insight into the 
smart grid. The GIS helps to identify where gaps might exist in the communication 
coverage of the smart meters to helping utilities understand consumption patterns. 
The GIS performs spatial analysis to determine where utilities can focus their ef­
forts on demand response and conservation programs. Figure B.1 show a GIS map 
displaying smart meter locations.
GIS Issues Dealing with Smart Grid
Three issues will inhibit the full usefulness of the smart grid related to GIS. The first 
is the incompleteness of the electric distribution facilities models within the GIS 
itself. A smart grid needs to understand exactly the phase connectivity of each ele­
ment and the exact representation of the low-voltage network. Many utilities have 
not captured the specific phase information.

210 
���������������������������������������
The Facility Model, GIS, and Smart Grid
The second issue is the timeliness of the data in the facility model. Even if the 
utilities had a complete representation of the facilities model, if the workflow to 
keep the data current takes too long or there is a backlog of unposted changes or 
unresolved conflicts to the GIS, then the smart grid will be operating on imprecise 
information. If the smart grid automatically opens and closes switches, it will need 
to know the exact representation of the network, not some representation that is 
a week, month, or, worse, several months old. The notion of self-healing, of auto­
matically reconfiguring the network during a power failure, requires an up-to-the-
minute representation of the network coming from the GIS, so the workflow of 
updating the network needs to be streamlined.
Finally, as noted earlier, some utilities built their GISs on base maps that had no 
standard coordinate system, so the GIS does not represent the electrical and struc­
tural facilities in their correct position. So utilities cannot use GPS in conjunction 
with the GIS to locate equipment. This will be more critical as utilities install more 
and more sensors. Location of these sensors will be critical.
Smart Grid Is also About Renewable Energy
The mix of generation is changing. Today, utilities generate the vast majority of 
electricity from large centrally managed power plants, fueled by nuclear power, 
coal, water power, and oil. In relative terms, utilities understand exactly how to 
manage these power plants. When the demand for power increases, the smart sys­
tems of these plants adjust their output. When the demand falls, the plants respond 
in a controlled automated way. In the near future, utilities will produce more and 
more electricity from variable sources of power, like wind and solar energy. When 
the demand increases, the utilities can’t just add more wind fuel to wind farms or 
turn up the sun to provide more solar energy. While the utilities have a very smart 
way of dealing with the present mix of power plants, they will need to figure out 
a smart way of dealing with power sources that are far more unpredictable. As a 
Figure B.1  GIS map displaying meter installations. (Source: Centerpoint Energy.)

A Grid Cannot Be Smart Without GIS 
211
result of the drive toward renewable power, utilities will install more and more 
energy storage facilities to help mitigate the variability of these new generation 
sources. Further, customers, developers, and utilities will install many of these new 
renewable sources of power to the medium- and low-voltage networks, which cur­
rently have the least automation, monitoring, and control.
Utilities will need to understand the exact relationship of all renewable energy 
sources to fully determine the impact of shifting generation and demand on their 
distribution systems.
A Grid Cannot Be Smart Without GIS
The notion of smart grid implies that the grid operates on information not on intu­
ition, observation, or customer calls. To be smart, the utility must have workflows 
in place to quickly capture any changes to the grid, be able to differentiate a power 
failure from a communication failure, and have the right analysis tools in place to 
provide situational awareness of the various smart grid systems. GIS provides the 
needed data management, analysis, and awareness to help the smart grid really be 
smart.

Summary
In the preface, I wrote about one of my bosses, Russ, the president and COO of an 
electric and gas utility. Russ thought that simplicity was the key to success. In the 
preface, I listed the few guidelines that Russ liked to follow. He said, “if you follow 
these guidelines, you will run a successful utility.”
••
Make money for the shareholders.
••
Keep customers happy.
••
Keep employees safe.
••
Obey all laws and regulations.
••
Keep the lights on.
••
Respect the environment.
His last guideline, which I liked to call the “goldenest” rule was:
••
Keep us out of trouble and out of the newspapers. 
I also shared my recollections with several of my coworkers at the utility. Nick 
strongly believes in simplicity and consistency. Recall from the preface that Nick 
wrote a memo that became so trusted for its wisdom and simplicity about relay 
protection that it earned the simple name of Nick’s Memo. This was presumably his 
only memo. I contrast Nick with Dan, who loved technology, but made things so 
complicated that maintenance and upkeep of his complex substation schemes cost 
the company a fortune. Johnny, Nick’s predecessor, followed Nick’s philosophy to 
the letter, and never had to write a single memo in his long career. 
What do Russ, Nick, Dan, and Johnny have to do with enhancing electric 
utility performance with GIS? GIS provides the simplest and most elegant form 
of communication:  displaying complex business and engineering situations in the 
form of a map. Maps are as old as civilization. Maps are about discovery. From 
finding buried treasure to charting mineral deposits on Mars, to seeing voting pat­
terns on cable news to locating the best place to site a coffee shop or a nuclear 
power plant. While the underlying technology of GIS can be very technical, the 
concept is simple and consistent; GIS organizes information by location, analyzes 
the results, and creates awareness of the results in the most common user interface 
known to humanity—the map.

Summary
Make Money
So Russ outlined the main stakeholders in his simple guidelines. His first one was 
to make money. Russ understood that if a business enterprise didn’t make money, it 
would fail. A quick examination of any utility’s income statement discovers where 
they make and spend the bulk of their money. They get their money from cus­
tomers, either wholesale or retail customers. Improving collections, reducing theft 
and losses, and better marketing of conservation programs improves their revenue. 
Understanding where losses are, where people aren’t paying bills, where are people 
most likely to steal electricity, and where to market gives utilities gives better insight 
into the effectiveness of their revenue enhancing programs. 
Utilities spend the bulk of their money on fuel (either directly or purchased), 
people (including contractors), and materials. GIS improves productivity and mate­
rial use by organizing the data and giving utilities the tools to better assess whether 
people are working more effectively. This is done by understanding where parts of 
the system are at most risk and which parts of the system need upgrading. GIS is 
fundamental to asset management.
The common theme of each of the chapters in this book is the concept of 
spatial analysis. Taking the map’s ancient user interface and coupling it with 
modern data management and display technology, GIS discovers the hidden 
treasures. In this case, the hidden treasure is not marked with an X, but simply a 
display showing where productivity is low, where materials are wasted, or where 
crews are taking longer to find things. Without the map, no one finds the hidden 
treasure.
The notion of making and saving money applies to all parts of the business, 
from generation of energy supply to transmission, to distribution to emergency 
management to customer care to shared services. Every one of these organizations 
has processes that depend on location, some more than others. Ignoring location 
handicaps the organization.
Keep Customers Happy
For years, utilities referred to their customers as ratepayers. Not long ago, when 
customers wanted electric service, they had to fill out an application, like ap­
plying for college or a mortgage. Maybe the bank would grant the loan or the 
college would admit the applicant to college, if the applicant was lucky. Today, most 
utilities are very concerned about customer service. This is even truer today after 
unbundling, with parts of the energy supply chain deregulated. Even the regulated 
elements of the business need to be very concerned about happy customers. Today, 
consumer, business, and political groups motivate utilities more than ever. Unhappy 
customers can result in a violation of Russ’s guideline about making money. In 
extreme cases, regulated utilities might even lose their franchise.
All throughout this book, I make the case that GIS discovers the best route, 
the places of greatest risk of failure, the places where customers are most unhap­
py, where to apply programs, and even how to discover the underlying causes of 
why customers are unhappy by performing what GIS professionals call mash ups. 
The powerful concept of layering different kinds of spatial information today and 

Obey All Laws and Regulations 
215
performing an overlay analysis gives utilities insight as to where things are most 
severe. In this case, the “X marks the spot” is not where the treasure is located, 
but where a confluence of customer events and impressions direct a utility to make 
changes.
GIS helps keep customers happy by mapping the pulse of the customer.
Obey All Laws and Regulations
Utilities, of course, make every attempt to obey all laws and regulations. However, 
things happen, accidents occur, and violations of laws and regulations result. In 
many cases, the violations are location based. A misguided line truck drives over a 
vegetated wetland. An unfortunate back hoe operator digs into a 345 kV pipe type 
cable. A substation transformer ruptures, sending insulating oil into a stream. A 
power plant mistake causes a plume of soot to blanket a residential neighborhood.
In most cases, each event has a spatial component. The notion of proximity 
is extremely helpful in avoiding many accidents. GIS routing, distance to nearest 
facility, environmental risk assessment, and simple counts of areas where utilities 
have violation issues are all standard GIS functions. Obeying laws and regulations 
also involves an understanding of where potential issues might arise, like using 
spare fibers in transmission lines for commercial use, over easements that do not 
permit such use. In these cases, GIS can help utilities avoid violations that may not 
be so obvious. 
Keep the Lights On
Perhaps the most fundamental rule of success in running a utility can be the most 
challenging. Keeping the power flowing. The three main capabilities of GIS are 
data management, spatial analysis, and providing awareness, as detailed in the in­
troduction. Keeping the lights on requires the gathering of all kinds of information 
about where facilities are located, what their specific condition is, and what other 
factors might contribute to an equipment failure. Using spatial analysis, utilities 
can combine any number of data layers to clearly discover where the risk of failure 
is greatest, and then visualize the results. During major emergencies, as detailed in 
Chapter 5, GIS can provide awareness of where customers are out of power, and 
how best to respond to the emergency by creating a heightened awareness of fac­
tors that may make restoration more difficult, such as flooding areas or landslides 
are downed trees or impassible roads. GIS’s use of imagery can provide enhanced 
understanding of the situation by performing change detection between pre- and 
post-event images. Instead of relying solely on field investigation, utilities can arm 
themselves with intelligence to better respond to power failures, so when the lights 
do go out, they will have the tools to respond and rebuild in the best possible way.
Of course, the best case is to harden the power system so as to avoid power 
failures. GIS can pinpoint areas where hardening provides the biggest bang for the 
buck. GIS can help utilities mitigate risk, be ready, rapidly respond, and effectively 
recover in the event of a major power failure. 

216

Summary
Respect the Environment
Nearly every aspect of power generation and delivery involves challenges to the 
environment. Power plants create emissions. Wind farms may endanger certain 
birds and migratory patterns. Coals storage can harm water aquifers. Gas pipelines 
supplying turbines can explode. Transmission lines create electromagnetic waves 
causing issues. Many transformers are oil-filled, which do rupture. Utilities have 
lots of heavy-duty trucks that generate emissions. Many have garages with hazard­
ous materials, which if not cared for, could cause harm.
The key for utilities is to fully capture the location of the potential environ­
mental source of harm (like the location of transformers) and the location of any 
sensitive environmental area. GIS connects the dots between the source of poten­
tial damage and the at-risk area. This is a classic GIS problem. Knowing before­
hand the environmental risks gives the utility the tools it needs to mitigate the risk. 
Should an accident happen, the utility will have the information to deal with the 
risk in a timely and efficient manner.
Keep Us Out of Trouble and Out of the Newspapers
A variety of factors create most accidents or problems. For example, accidents 
are often the result of a number of failures, such as not knowing where a sensitive 
environmental area is in relation to a project, or not assessing the potential of a 
substation being flooded during a 100-year storm. The common expression that 
ends up in the newspapers after some troublesome situation is, “the utility should 
have known.” Unlike any other technology, GIS adds a spatial context to data that 
pinpoints where problems can happen. GIS is really about the where of a utility. 
With an enterprise GIS, where information is shared throughout the company, utili­
ties gain a better understanding of the connection of all of the factors. Utilities are 
notoriously run as independent silos of departments. The idea that the utility should 
have known is often a result of one department not knowing what the other is do­
ing. GIS provides a common framework of understanding: the map.
GIS is not simply about creating maps that used to be created by hand. Yes it 
does that, but it is so much more. As stated a number of times, it is about discovery 
and fully understanding where the utility’s biggest problems might be so that the 
utility can take action to deal with the problem effectively or to avoid it altogether.
GIS Technology for Enhanced Electric Utility Performance
GIS helps utilities see the operations in a simple and consistent way in the form of a 
map. This book breaks down each organization of the utility into its major compo­
nents. It illustrates the value of location to the business. Nearly every aspect of the 
business involves location. GIS helps utilities solve their biggest problems in each 
of the areas of their company by helping providing a simple, elegant, and ancient 
context to their business—taking the complexities of the business with all of its fac­
tors and metrics and finding where X marks the spot—on the map.

ing maintenance, construction, vegetation control, system operations, and GIS. In 
1999, Bill comanaged the merger of the Boston Edison Company with Common­
wealth Energy to form the company called NSTAR. In 1998, senior management 
tapped him to restructure systems and processes in anticipation of electric utility 
deregulation. Bill spent many years as manager of engineering at Boston Edison. It 
was while managing engineering that Bill conceived of and led the Boston Edison 
GIS project to successful completion. 
Bill earned a master of engineering in power systems from Rensselaer Polytech­
nic Institute and a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from Northeastern 
University. He completed the executive management program at the Sloan School 
of Management at MIT. Bill taught a number of engineering courses at the Gradu­
ate School of Engineering of Northeastern University and at the School of Engi­
neering of the University of Massachusetts. He is a registered professional engineer 
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and a member of IEEE and Eta Kappa 
Nu.
Bill has been heavily involved in community work, having spent ten years on 
the Planning and Zoning Board in Easton, Massachusetts. He served the board of 
directors of Easton Cooperative Bank, was a member of the Easton Lion’s Club, 
chaired the United Way Campaign for Boston Edison, and served on the advisory
