PREFACE
Electrical engineering is a ﬁeld of engineering that in general deals with the study and
application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. Depending on how it is
intended in different areas of the world, it may cover a wide range of subﬁelds,
including electronics, digital computers, power engineering, telecommunications,
control systems, and signal processing.
This broad range of ﬁelds of interest can be split into two main areas:
• what we could call signal-oriented electrical engineering, for which electric
quantities (voltage, current, etc.) are used to carry signals—for example, inside
TV sets or computers or through electromagnetic waves;
• what we could call power-oriented electrical engineering, for which electric
quantities are used to manage and transfer power—for example, in power lines,
electric machines, rectiﬁers, or inverters.
Indeed, from a practical point of view, these two kinds of electrical engineering are
very different from each other. The approach to analysing applications is different; the
physical objects that fulﬁl different functions tend also to be very different. For
instance, while the dimensions of signal-oriented electric devices have shrunk by
several orders of magnitude in the last decades (think of computers or mobile phones,
for instance), the dimensions of apparatuses tend to be much more stable whenever
large powers are involved (e.g., the size of a 100 kW electric motor or a 100 MW
power station has not changed signiﬁcantly).
xv

Electric power engineering is a branch of industrial engineering, while signal
electrical engineering is generally not considered as such.
University students of nonelectrical engineering, such as students of civil,
mechanical, aerospace, chemical, or even control engineering, will be interested
in power-oriented electrical engineering. Mechanical or aerospace engineers, for
instance, should be able to understand in detail how an electric motor or an
electric drive works. Civil engineers might need to understand how electrical
installations are built and how the external power system feeding them operates.
Basic information about the safety aspects of electricity might interest all of
them.
This book aims to give university teachers support to teach nonelectrical
engineering students all they need to know about basic electric phenomena, circuits,
and electric machines and drives, as well as the basics of electric safety and an
introduction to how large power systems are built and operated.
It might also be useful for professional engineers who want to have a source of
updated, though concise, information of nearly everything that happens in power-
oriented electrical engineering.
We have made every effort to explain each subject in the simplest way.
However, in the case of more complex concepts, we have tried, rather than feigning
simplicity, to illustrate them as clearly as possible. Taking our cue from Albert
Einstein, we have adopted the approach of making everything as simple as possible,
but not simpler.
This book tends to say things in a concise way. This is because we believe
that this way it offers a stimulus to students: were we to describe each path of
reasoning in detail, we would not stimulate the student’s independent ﬂow of
reasoning.
In Chapters 3 and 4, special attention has been devoted to ensuring that a clear
distinction is made between physical systems and their mathematical models. This is
important, not only for the study of the topics in this book, but also as a lesson to
students on how engineering proceeds: ﬁrst we model reality, then we analyse the
models. If the results of our analysis are not satisfactory, this might depend on the
model we originally chose, and perhaps a more accurate version must be selected and
used.
A few ﬁnal comments:
• We have used graphic symbols, mathematical formulations, and even wording
in compliance with the standards of the International Electrotechnical
Commission. Details of this are in Chapter 1.
• We have tried to ensure that the exercises offer not only the chance to
consolidate theoretical knowledge but also an opportunity for further learn-
ing. The reader is ﬁrst led by hand through worked examples embedded in the
text. At the end of Chapters 4–7 and 10–12 there are several exercises of
increasing complexity and a solution is outlined for the least straightforward
of these.
xvi
PREFACE

• At the end of some chapters we have added short biographies of the scientists
who have given their names to the laws described in the chapter. Although very
concise, these biographies offer some idea of the period and background of each
scientist’s discoveries. Whenever available, the correct pronunciation of the
scientists’ names is given, based on the International Phonetic Association
Alphabet.
READERSHIP AND PREREQUISITES
This book is aimed at all students of engineering, with the exception of electrical
engineering students (who require additional details of each topic). The book should
also be very useful for nonelectrical qualiﬁed engineers, who may not have retained
good support material from their student years or who may need to brush up on their
knowledge of the fundamentals of electrical engineering without resorting to
specialist books.
The most important prerequisite in order to take full advantage of the book is some
knowledge of electromagnetics. The best results will be obtained easily by students
who have already attended a university-level electromagnetics course. However, we
have made every effort to make the book accessible to students who have only basic
knowledge of electromagnetic phenomena from their secondary school studies.
Chapter 2 will help these students to refresh their memory and to become acquainted
with the symbols and approach used in the book.
LEVELS OF READING
This book caters to different levels of study. The most important example concerns
electronic power conversion and Chapter 8. Electronic power conversion is widely
used in electric drives and power systems. However, to fully understand it requires
time. Although Chapter 8 contains a fairly lengthy description of how power
electronics components are composed and operate, this chapter is not essential to an
understanding of Chapters 10–12 (which deal with electric drives in addition to
electric machines). Chapter 15 also deals with electronic converters in power
systems, but, again, students are not required to have ﬁrst studied Chapter 8.
Needless to say, if there is time available in a university course to include Chapter 8,
it follows that Chapters 10–12 and 15 can then be studied at a higher level of
understanding.
The book also has some “more in depth” boxes. These contain extra information
that is not essential for a clear understanding of the rest of the chapter to which they
belong. “More in depth” boxes are included to trigger the curiosity of the reader, who
can decide whether or not to read or study them.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
THE SCOPE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
It is universally agreed that Electrical Engineering is a branch of engineering that
deals with the phenomena of electricity. Apart from this vague statement, however,
there is no worldwide agreement on the actual scope of an electrical engineer. In
particular, there are two main approaches:
• In some cases, electrical engineering is considered as encompassing those
disciplines in which electrical quantities (voltages, currents) are used to transfer
signals (e.g., in computers, radio and TV sets, etc.) and those in which electrical
quantities are used to manage and transfer energy and power (electrical
machines and lines, electrical household installations, etc.). This approach
is, for instance, normally followed in North America.
• In other cases, electrical engineering is considered to be involved only when
electrical quantities are used to transfer and convert energy and power. This
approach is usually followed in Europe. This kind of electrical engineering is
often called electric power engineering.
This book follows this second approach, hence its title. Generally speaking, the
whole scope of Electric Power Engineering comprises everything needed to manage
electric energy, from its generation to its ﬁnal utilization.

The word “generation” might be a bit misleading since energy cannot, indeed, be
generated: the term means production of electricity by conversion from other forms of
energy. For instance, the electric alternators of large oil or gas power plants “generate”
electricity by conversion from mechanical energy, in turn obtained by using other
machines, like steam or gas turbines. Photovoltaic panels are another example of
electricity generators: they produce electric energy through the conversion of solar
radiation.
The ﬁnal utilization of electricity very often involves another conversion; for
example, the ﬁnal energy form can be heat (in heaters or ovens) or mechanical energy
(in industrial electric motors, in electric cars, etc.). There are cases, however, in which
electric energy is used as such; the most signiﬁcant example is for supplying
computers or other electronic apparatuses.
Between generation and ﬁnal utilization, electric energy can be transformed
several times (for instance in power transformers, which raise the voltage while
lowering the current and vice versa), and transferred for distances of up to hundreds or
thousands of kilometres, by means of power lines.
Indeed, it will be seen in this book, especially in Part IV, that the more power to be
transmitted, the higher the required voltage level. Therefore, the power system has
low voltage (LV) parts (for instance, power in homes and ofﬁces is always LV),
medium voltage (MV) parts (the alternators of large power plants generate power at
MV level), and high voltage (HV) and extra high voltage (EHV) levels.
All these apparatuses, which convert or transfer energy, are therefore parts of a
great system, one of the largest that mankind has ever built, that encompasses the
generation, transformation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric
energy and is called a power system. All this can be visualized in the diagram in
Figure 1.1, which shows the main functions of a power system along with the different
energy forms involved.
A typical situation includes electricity generation in power plants, transformation
toward high voltage in transformers, transmission toward load centres, transformation
into medium or low voltage, distribution to single loads, and conversion to ﬁnal usage.
In the ﬁgure, the term “Bulk Generation” refers to large-scale centralized facilities,
which inject their production into the transmission grid. “Distributed Generation”
(DG) is instead composed of a large number of small-scale power plants, installed

close to the ﬁnal users and directly connected to a distribution network. In the same
ﬁgure, “T” represents the transformation performed by power transformers; other
forms of electric-to-electric transformation are usually made inside the biggest blocks;
for instance, utilization could involve a combined rectiﬁer/inverter pair that allows
maximum ﬂexibility to the electric motor speed variation. The DG can be provided
with power transformers, depending on the voltage of the generator and of the
receiving network.
The outline of the electric power system shown in Figure 1.1 is much simpliﬁed, in line
with the aims of this chapter. A more detailed and accurate description of the electric
power system will be given in Part IV of this book.
When a power system is mentioned, what is usually intended is one of the very
large networks that link power plants (large or small) to loads, by means of an electric
grid that may be as large as a continent, such as the whole of Europe or North
America. A power system, in this sense, extends from a very large power plant (e.g.,
having thousands of MW of generated power) right up to either the lamp that might
now be lit on your table or the sockets giving electricity to loads from the nearest wall!
Smaller power systems could be made of sections of a larger system. Examples are
shown in Figure 1.2.
Figure 1.2a contains several components (breaker, cable, motor), which operate
together and are connected to a feeding network. The subsystem represented in

Figure 1.2a could be one of the ﬁnal users of the electric energy in the utilization block
shown in Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.2b contains many of the same components as Figure 1.2a, but its purpose
is totally different. Instead of the fan, we have a wind turbine, which has some
similarities to a large fan, but with the power ﬂow reversed: it receives power from an
air ﬂow to produce mechanical energy, while a fan uses mechanical energy to obtain
an air ﬂow. The subsystem represented in Figure 1.2c could be one of the small power
plants contained in the block of distributed generation shown in Figure 1.1.
Finally, Figure 1.2c contains a variation of the system in Figure 1.2a. The presence
of the electronic converter allows much greater ﬂexibility in the use of the electric
motor and, in particular, allows variable speed operation of the fan. The electronic
converter modiﬁes electrical quantities, thus transforming electricity into electricity,
differently from motors and generators that convert, respectively, mechanical energy
into electricity and vice versa. Electronic converters tend to be increasingly present in
power systems, even though they are not in evidence in the simpliﬁed diagram in
Figure 1.1.
A very large number of power systems like the ones shown in Figure 1.2 operate
only when connected to the mains—for example, a feeding network.
A power system such as that shown in Figure 1.1 is called a full power system,
since its operation does not require feeding points from other electricity sources and
the produced electricity is supplied to loads.
Power systems that are fed instead by an external electricity source or that produce
(by conversion from other sources) electricity and convey it to a larger grid are called
partial power systems.
There are also full power systems that are much smaller than the large power
systems (such as those of Europe or North America) discussed earlier, but still, on a
smaller scale, perform the basic functions of generation, distribution, and utilization
of energy. An example is the small system created to feed a building yard, along with
the cables and loads. Another example is the electric system on board electric cars:
battery, inverter, motor, and accessory parts.
It should be stressed that a power system is basically composed of power lines and
apparatuses that convert energy (energy converters). Power lines are relatively simple
in their inner structure and do not need a great deal of explanation, especially in an
introductory book.
The energy converters that are of interest to electric power engineering can be
divided into two categories:
• Apparatuses for converting electricity into other forms of energy and vice versa.
With reference to Figure 1.1, these are usually at the source of the system (“Bulk
Generation” block), where electric energy is produced through conversion from
other forms of energy and at its end (“Utilization” block), where electricity,
when not used as such, is converted into other forms. Of great importance are
the apparatuses that convert electricity into mechanical energy and vice versa—
that is, those used for electromechanical-energy conversion (electromechanical
converters).
6
INTRODUCTION

• Conversion from electrical energy into electrical energy with different char-
acteristics—that is, electric-to-electric energy conversion. This kind of conver-
sion is carried out by power transformers (like those shown in Figure 1.1), but
also in other situations. For instance, electricity can be converted from
alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) (using rectiﬁers) or from
DC into AC (using inverters), and so on. This kind of conversion, not explicitly
shown in the simpliﬁed diagram of Figure 1.1, is becoming increasingly
frequent in power systems; each of the larger blocks in Figure 1.1 can contain
electric-to-electric conversion apparatuses. For instance, an electric motor is
often fed by an inverter, to form a system called electric drive.

THIS BOOK’S SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION
Nonelectrical engineers do not need to know the details of electric power systems;
however, they need to master its basic functions in order to be able to exploit their
application and to effectively collaborate with electrical engineers in more complex
cases.
Since this book is intended for use in courses of one or two semesters, the authors
have had to make important decisions on how deeply each topic should be dealt with.
Our ﬁnal decision was to focus on showing (a) how a physical system can be modelled
using circuits and (b) how circuits can be analysed. Once readers have gained the
ability to “solve” circuits—that is, to numerically compute currents, voltages, and
power—they will have gained sufﬁcient knowledge of the phenomena in any electric
device; at that point, the way has been paved for learning more about electric
machines, drives, and power systems.
To pursue its objectives, the book has been divided into the following four parts:
Part I: Preliminary Material. This part contains two very different chapters, both
of which are introductory to the book’s core material. Chapter 1 includes
miscellaneous topics such as a discussion of the very meaning of electrical (or
electric power) engineering, as well as an overview of the scope and organiza-
tion of the book. Chapter 2, on the other hand, creates a bridge between the core
material of this book and the student’s previous knowledge. It is organized into
two levels, and students can select the one most appropriate to their previous
knowledge of electromagnetism.
Part II: Electric circuit Concept and Analysis. The main purpose of this part, as
mentioned previously, is to show readers how to handle electric circuits. For
this, we have adopted an innovative approach: readers will learn that circuits are
mathematical/graphic tools to model physical systems operating with electric
quantities. We will show that, because they are models, the results we obtain
from mathematically solving circuits are accurate only to the extent to which
they correctly model physical systems. We will also explain that they are zero-
dimensional models, while actual systems are distributed-parameter, that is,
three-dimensional. This explanation is useful not only for building a sound base
THIS BOOK’S SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION
7

of electrical engineering knowledge, but also as a signiﬁcant example of how
engineering is practiced in all of its ﬁelds.
Part III: Electric Machines and Power Converters. We saw in the previous
paragraph that electric power systems contain several apparatuses to convert
energy. These are the main subjects of Part II of this book.
This part combines three disciplines that are traditionally distinct: electric
machines (machines for electromechanical conversions, plus the power trans-
former), power electronics (dealing with electric-to-electric conversion, differ-
ent from that of power transformers), and electric drives.
The aim is to interpret the modern world, where these disciplines are
strictly related to each other, and to present information in the form best
suited to readers of this book, whether or not they are electric engineering
students.
Part IV: Power Systems Basics. The description of power systems in Section 1.1 is
very concise. Depending on how this book is used, more detailed information
about the whole electric power system may be required. This is given in Part IV
of the book, which contains (a) a description of the structure and operation of
the system and (b) basic information about the risks of electricity for livestock
and about how to prevent accidents.
Since this book is intended for courses of one or two semesters, some parts have
been written in such a way that they can be omitted for shorter programmes.
Each chapter of the book starts with a “For the Instructor” box explaining the
approach to be followed, along with (whenever possible) advice as to what can be
safely omitted in shorter courses.
Examples of one-semester courses that can be taught using this book are:
• A course subsequent to a circuit course. In this case, Part II can be omitted and
the material for the course can be drawn from Parts III and IV.
• A one-semester course on the fundamentals of electric power engineering, as the
only electrical engineering course in a programme. In this case, Chapters 8, 14,
and 15 can be totally omitted. If further reductions are necessary, Chapter 13 can
also be omitted.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND THEIR USAGE
IN THIS BOOK
1.3.1
International Standardization Bodies
Since it is written in the third millennium, this must be a global book. It is therefore
intended for any reader from anywhere in the world. This means that the graphics and
conventions for drawings and writing equations must be independent, as far as
possible, of individual country preferences.

INTRODUCTION

To ease the reciprocal exchange of information (and objects), common standards
have been set by international organisations, in particular:
• The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), whose task is (“to
ensure world-wide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the
International System of Units (SI).”1 It thus provides indications on how to
numerically evaluate and indicate measurements of different quantities.
• The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which is “the world’s
leading organization that prepares and publishes International Standards for
all electrical, electronic and related technologies.”2 The IEC is one of three
global sister organizations (IEC, ISO, ITU) that develop International Standards
for global use.
• The IEEE standards Association (IEEE-SA), which “brings together a broad
range of individuals and organizations from a wide range of technical and
geographic points of origin to facilitate standards development and standards
related collaboration.”3
Of these, the most important organization for the purposes of this book is the IEC;
however, some basic information from the SI can be found in the publication [s2],
which provides a good interpretation of the BIPM documents; some ISO standards,
such as [s9], might also be of interest.
There are some ﬁelds of Electrical Engineering in which IEEE standards are an
acknowledged important international reference; in these cases, reference is also made
to IEEE standards (such as [s5] for harmonics control, quoted in Chapter 8).
A detailed presentation of standards is far beyond the scope of this book, but a
systematic adoption of all the agreed standards (with some minor deviations) will
help the reader to become accustomed to them and to remember them for many years
to come.
1.3.2
The International System of Units (SI)
The International System of Units, SI4 for short, deﬁnes the units of measure to be
used all over the world, for measuring the different quantities used in any ﬁeld of
science or technology, from physics to engineering.
However, there are many situations in which people do not comply with the SI and
use other units of measure. For instance, aeroplane altitudes are commonly indicated
in feet, ship speeds in knots, and engine powers in HP. This is totally unjustiﬁed in the
majority of cases. Dealing with thousands of different units of measure traditionally
used in different countries, and with the corresponding conversion factors, only adds

undue effort and uncertainty to the work of technicians as well as ordinary people. The
use of non-SI units, except in very limited cases for which speciﬁc justiﬁcations may
exist, is even more questionable in books addressed to the younger generations since
this could cause the perpetuation of these errors, thus slowing, if not jeopardising, the
whole process of universal dissemination of the SI and the beneﬁts it can bring.
In this book, therefore, the SI units of measure are always used, with virtually no
exceptions. Only units considered by the SI itself to be “non-SI units accepted for use
with the SI” are used, such as minutes (min), hours (h), and days (d), because of their
widespread use in everyday life.5
Students are strongly advised to use SI units as much as possible. Once accustomed
to them, they will ﬁnd it natural to use them always. This way, one day in the future,
the entire population (or most of it) will use a single unit for a single quantity, which
will make life easier for everyone.
The SI deﬁnes seven base units, which by convention are independent, as well as
many other derived units, one for each quantity, expressed in relation to the base units.
In this book, only quantities in relation to a subsystem of ﬁve of the SI base units
will be used; the base units of interest of this book will thus only be those shown
in Table 1.1. Please note the style of writing in accordance with international standards,
applied both to base and derived units:
• The initial letter of a unit is in lowercase and no accents are used (see the
example of the unit for electric currents).
• The symbol of a unit must always be written either uppercase or lowercase as
given. For example, kilogram has the symbol kg (not Kg), ampere A, and so on.
Symbols may be composed of more than a single letter (such as Pa for pascal,
the standard unit of pressure).6 Finally, symbols must be written in roman
5For a complete list of such SI-accepted, non-SI units and notes on their usage, see [s2].
6The ISO standard provides a strict rule for the case of units: when the unit is represented by the initial of a
scientist’s name, it must be uppercase: V for volt, A for ampere, and so on; otherwise it should be lowercase:
kg for kilogram, lx for lux, and so on. The only exception is the liter, for which the use of “L” instead of “l” is
accepted, to avoid confusion with the number 1 (one).

(not italic) type, regardless of the type used in the surrounding text, and must not
be followed by a dot, unless at the end of the sentence (e.g., “a current of 2 A is
generated”, and not “a current of 2 A. is generated”).
As far as temperature is concerned, thermodynamic temperature is mentioned in
Table 1.1 because in the SI it is used to deﬁne the Celsius temperature, using the very
well-known equation
t  T  T0
where t and T are the same temperature, measured in degrees Celsius and kelvin,
respectively, while the reference temperature T0 equals 273.15 K.7
When the numerical value of a quantity is given, its unit of measure must be shown
alongside its numerical value: I  2 A means that I is twice the value of the SI standard
current, the ampere. What is not widely known is that the same expression can also be
written I/A  2. As surprising as this might be, it is very rational: the numerical value
of any quantity is always the ratio of the quantity to the reference value (in this case the
SI base quantity).
This way of expressing units of measure of quantities is recommended also when
the unit of measure refers to several numerical values, such as in tables or plots. This is
visually expressed in the following tables, in which the recommended way is
compared to another common way of expressing units of measure in table or plot
headings—that is, within square brackets:

Graphic Symbols for Circuit Drawings
The circuit drawings in this book are written according to the latest international
standards. A summary of the symbols used is contained in the following table.
7Here there is a clear exception to the general rule requiring the units of measure to be lowercase: the
addition of word “degree” changes the word “Celsius” from a unit name to the name of the scientist, thus
requiring an initial capital.

The following symbols are a selection from International ISO/IEC/IEEE standards ([s6], [s9]
and [s10]). In rare cases some small deviation from the standard is used, and the reason for this
choice is to be found in the notes column.

The IEC does not provide speciﬁc symbols for
ideal transformers (circuit elements) and
transformers (machines that can be modeled
with varying degrees of detail). In this book the
ideal transformer will be indicated using a letter
i in the scheme.
Coil
The IEC considers this symbol to be obsolete.
However, it does not provide a speciﬁc symbol
for coils. In this book, coils are intended as
physical objects (usually with some resistance
and inductance) while inductors are ideal
components with inductance only.

The IEC symbol requires the textual information to
be as follows:
• M for asynchronous motor
• G for asynchronous generator
• MS for synchronous motor
• GS for synchronous generator
In this book, deviation is made from this standard,
since circuit elements represent objects, and the
object is the synchronous or asynchronous
machine; motor and generator are just operating
modes of the object.

Names, Symbols, and Units
Equations relating to electric phenomena and circuits appear in this book according to
the latest international standards. This is because of the global nature of this book and
to ease communication between people of different countries or regions of the world.
Readers can thus be conﬁdent that the graphic conventions used throughout the book
closely match (with very few, well-motivated exceptions) those of internationally
agreed standards, and they are strongly advised to become familiar with them and to
use them now and in the future.
The basic rules set by these standards for writing SI units of measure have already been
presented in Section. 1.3.2. Other rules, closely followed in this book, are as follows:
• Symbols that identify physical quantities are written in italics (e.g., V or v for
potential, V for volume, m for mass, I or i for currents, and so on.8 Subscripts are
8The only exception in this book, in line with the majority of books, regards quantities represented by
uppercase Greek characters: these are not written in italics, simply because this makes them easier to
distinguish. For example, when a mechanical speed is indicated using an uppercase omega, it will be written
as Ω rather than Ω.
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND THEIR USAGE IN THIS BOOK
13

written in italics when they refer to physical quantities (e.g., Cp for thermal
capacitance at constant pressure p), but in roman (upright) in all other cases (Cg
for gas thermal capacitance, Uav for average voltage).
• Vectors and matrixes are represented using bold type (e.g., E and B for electric
and magnetic ﬁelds);
• Time-varying quantities, whenever possible, are expressed using lowercase
letters (such as i for currents, u for voltages) while quantities that are constant
over time are expressed using uppercase symbols (I and U, respectively, for
current and voltage).
• Complex numbers, as stated in [s9], are indicated by underlining the related
symbol; for example, U Z I is Ohm’s law for alternating circuits, expressed by
means of complex numbers. Conjugates of complex numbers are referred to
using an asterisk: Z* is the conjugate of Z.
In addition to these general rules, the following additional conventions, compliant
with standards, though not mandatory, are used in this book:
• When sinusoidal voltages are given, their peak values are indicated by the peak
sign “^” above the relevant symbol (e.g., the peak of a sinusoidal voltage u is ^U).
• Symbols representing integer numbers (e.g.,i, j, k, . . . ) are shown in italics since
this makes them easier to read and is very common practice in books and articles.
The names of the quantities used in the book, their symbols, and their unit of
measure are also taken from the above-mentioned international standards and are
shown in the following table.
The ofﬁcial standard has been simpliﬁed in some cases. For instance, “electric ﬁeld” is used
instead of the ofﬁcial name “electric ﬁeld strength.” This is for reasons of both simplicity and
rationality; other names would otherwise also need to be changed: for instance, “electric current
intensity” would have to be used instead of “electric current.”

Other Conventions
An important decision, and one for which no solution is suggested by international
standards, regards the decimal marker. The 22nd General Conference on Weights and
Measures (CGPM) decided in 2003 that “the symbol for the decimal marker shall be
either the point on the line or the comma on the line.”
In this book the decimal marker is shown as a point on the line.
For vector products, the two following symbols, again from International Stan-
dards, are used everywhere:
• Result c of dot product between a and b: c  a ? b
• Result c of cross product (or vector product) between a and b: c  a  b

Boxes Around Text
For easy reference, boxes are used to emphasize very important pieces of information.
The following types of boxes are used:
Convention: Name of convention
Contains adopted conventions, such as the one used to indicate voltage polarity.
Normally the adopted conventions are drawn from International standards; when
this does not occur, the decision is commented on and justiﬁed.
Definition: Name of deﬁnition
Contains the deﬁnition of new concepts (such as a circuit) or quantities (such as the
ampere as unit of measure of a current).
Law: Name of law
States some fundamental laws of electromagnetism or circuits, such as the charge
conservation law or Kirchhoff’s laws.
Result: Name of result
The main results of the analyses carried out are evidenced in boxes, so that they are
easily spotted at a glance.
Rule: Name of rule
Practical rules to be applied to obtain particular results are also boxed. An example
is the rule that allows a circuit-like physical system to be dealt with using the
abstract circuit concept.
1.4.2
Grayed Boxes
Sometimes the text is evidenced in grayed boxes. Two types are used: more in depth
boxes and for the instructor boxes.
The “more in depth” boxes can be found throughout the chapters, and offer in-
depth insight to the basic concepts in the general text. Although not essential for

acquiring a basic knowledge of the topics, their visual appearance is such that the
reader is stimulated to read (and possibly study) them.
The “for the instructor” boxes are to be found only at the beginning of a chapter,
just below the table of contents, and explain the rationale behind the choices made, to
help teachers plan their presentation of topics in class.
The appearance of these boxes is as follows:

Terminology in any textbook should be free from strict standards. However, when a
lot of books share the same terminology, this is useful for readers wishing to refer to
several sources. Therefore, whenever possible, terms drawn from International
Standards such as [s4] or [s7] are used.
As regards circuits, some deviation from standards was advisable in some cases;
therefore in Chapter 2, in the section “deﬁnitions”, the most important deﬁnitions
relating to circuits arereviewed, anddeviations from International Standards evidenced.

THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS
OF ELECTROMAGNETISM
For the Instructor
Readers of this book are expected to have at least some knowledge of the basic
laws of electromagnetism—that is, the laws of Gauss, Ampère (with Maxwell’s
added displacement current), and Faraday, as well as Gauss’s law for magnetism
and the deﬁnitions of E and B by means of induced forces.
Nevertheless, in this chapter we offer a concise presentation of all these laws.
This way we provide some basic knowledge to those who have not previously
encountered them; however we also recommend that you read this chapter even if
you have previous knowledge of electromagnetics, so as to refresh your memory
and to become acquainted with the symbols used in this book (which are basically
the ones recommended by international standardization bodies).
Generally speaking, you can omit to read the More in Depth boxes. If, however,
you have already attended an electromagnetics course at university level, these
boxes will act as a bridge between your previous studies and the material in this
book.
We will start with the deﬁnitions of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which link the
worlds of mechanical and electromagnetic phenomena.

Fundamentals of Electric Power Engineering: From Electromagnetics to Power Systems, First Edition.

2014 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. Published 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This chapter cannot substitute a good book of electromagnetism. Engineers, in
particular, may want to have stronger knowledge of applied electromagnetics. For
this purpose, a good book is reference [be2].
Note. In this chapter the general rule that lowercase symbols are used for time-
varying quantities and uppercase for constant quantities is not followed. Forces,
currents, potentials, and ﬁelds used in this chapter can all be time-varying.
2.1
VECTOR FIELDS
In physics and engineering, it is very frequent to evaluate actions among objects
occurring at a distance. For instance, when two point masses are considered in a space
which is ideally free from any other mass, the gravitational force exists between them
that is expressed by the well-known formula
Fg  γ Mm
d2
(2.1)
where γ is a constant, d is the distance between the two masses M and m, and the force
is attractive and directed from one mass to the other.
Similarly, when two positive charges Q and q are present in a space free from any
other charge, the force exerted is
FC  k Qq
d2
(2.2)
where k is a constant, d is the distance between the two charges, and the force is
repulsive and directed from one charge to the other.
Near the surface of the earth, the gravity force is instead given by
Fg0  mg
(2.3)
and is always directed vertically toward the ground.
This formula is immediately obtained from (2.1), considering the value of the universal
constant γ, the earth’s mass M, and the earth’s radius r.
However, instead of considering the forces as being due to two objects (two
masses, two charges, etc.), it is very useful in these cases to imagine that the ﬁrst of
these has somewhat altered the space, so that when the second system is present, it
feels a force applied to it. For instance, the presence of a ﬁrst mass M can cause the
space to be altered so that, at any point, a force per unit mass exists, whose value is
obtained from the expression
Fgu  γ M
r2 ru
where ru is a unit length vector having its head in the centre of the space occupied by
M and its tail in the position where Fgu is computed.
20
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

Thus we think of the space as having at each point, by effect of the presence of M, a
virtual force Fgu, per unit mass. In other words, once a mass m is positioned at a
point P, this mass will feel an attractive force toward M, whose strength is Fg  Fgum.
This virtual force, deﬁned for the different points of space, is what we call a force
ﬁeld. The process is very similar for the Coulomb force (2.2). In this case, the force is
considered to be due to a ﬁrst charge (let it be Q) and evaluated per unit of the second
charge, according to the relation
FCu  k Q
r2 ru
(2.4)
In comparison to the gravitational ﬁeld, here we have the difﬁculty that charges can be
either positive or negative. FCu is the force exerted, by effect of the presence of charge Q,
on a unit charge assumed to be positive.
This is another example of force ﬁeld. In this case, once a charge q is positioned at a
point P, this charge will feel a force toward Q, whose strength is F  FCuq.
Equation (2.4) is valid also with regard to signs. When the product Qq is positive,
the force tends to move the two charges apart from each other; otherwise the force is
attractive.
More in general, a vector ﬁeld is a mathematical expression deﬁning a vector in all
points of a subset of space. Vector ﬁelds are very useful in analysing natural
phenomena, as we will soon see later in this chapter.
An important scalar quantity that can be derived for a generic vector ﬁeld G is the
so-called line integral or path integral. If we consider a path l through space followed
by a point (e.g., a point mass or a point charge), the corresponding line integral I is the
integral of the scalar product of vector ﬁeld G and the line element of the path dl (an
inﬁnitesimal vector whose direction is the path tangent):
I  ∫l
G  dl
Note that when the vector ﬁeld is a per unit force ﬁeld, the path integral is the per unit
work the ﬁeld produces. For instance, the quantity
WABu  m∫
B
A
Fu  dl
is the work the ﬁeld per unit mass Fu produces when the mass m moves (by whatever
cause) from point A to point B, along a given path.
Some of the vector ﬁelds are conservative. A force ﬁeld is said to be conservative if
the work it does between two generic points A and B does not depend on the path
chosen between A and B, or, equivalently, if the work done along any closed curve is
always null.
F is conservative ⇔Wl  ∮l
F  dl  0
whatever closed curve l is chosen:1
1Line integrals along closed curves are often called cyclic integrals.
VECTOR FIELDS

or, equivalently,
Fis conservative⇔WAB  ∫
B
A
Fdl is the same whatever the path fromAtoB:
This is true in particular for the force ﬁelds we have considered per unit charge or per
unit mass:
Fu is conservative⇔WABu ∫
B
A
Fu dl is the same whatever the path fromAtoB:
Since the work between A and B does not depend on the path followed, it is a function
of points A and B only. This function is called potential and is normally indicated in
physics textbooks using the letter V.
WABu ∫
B

Fu dl VAVB
(2.5)
If we consider the Coulomb ﬁeld, Fu  FC/m and the potential V is called electric
potential.
Potential is of the utmost importance in electricity. The common voltage of our
household electrical installation is indeed an “electric potential difference”—that is,
the difference assumed by the potential function V between the two terminals of the
electricity supply.
2.2
DEFINITION OF E AND B; LORENTZ’S FORCE LAW
You may have learned in your previous studies of electromagnetics that a charge q in
the vicinity of another charge Q is subject to a force, which can be expressed using
Coulomb’s law. Coulomb’s law was also mentioned in Section 2.1 as a very
signiﬁcant example of force ﬁeld.
Because of its importance, what in Section 2.1 was called FCu, i.e., Coulomb force
per unit charge has a name of its own, the electric ﬁeld, and the speciﬁc symbol E.
Now we can express Coulomb’s law in more detail than in equation (2.4), as
follows:
E 
Q
4πεr2 ru
(2.6)
where
• ru is a unit length vector with its tail in the centre of the space occupied by Q and
its head directed toward the position where E is computed.
• ε is a physical characteristic of the medium in the position where E is computed,
called the permittivity. Values of permittivity of different materials are easily
found in books and on the Internet.
22
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

Remember that, using the electric ﬁeld concept, the force exerted on a charge q
located in the point of space where E exists is subject to the force
FC  qE
(2.7)
Equation (2.7) deﬁnes the electric ﬁeld (for stationary charges) E, as the force per
unit charge occurring to a charge at distance r from the ﬁeld of origin (where Q
resides) and with the same direction as ru. So we can issue the following:
Definition: Electric ﬁeld
The electric ﬁeld strength or electric ﬁeld in a point of space is the force per unit
charge that acts on a stationary charge located in that point of space.
Equation (2.7) deﬁnes the electric ﬁeld in a point of space without direct link to
(2.6). This is intentional, since the electric ﬁeld in a point of space is in general
produced by a system of several charges in different zones of space, and therefore the
electric ﬁeld conﬁguration is typically much more complex than the one indicated by
equation (2.6).
The electric ﬁeld E is conservative, and therefore it allows a potential function V so
that:
∫
B
A
E  dl  VA  VB
(2.8)
Because of its importance, the potential V has its own unit of measure, the volt,
whose symbol is V. Hence it follows that the electric ﬁeld E can be expressed in N/C
(newton per coulomb) or V/m (volt per meter).
If the same charge q is moving in a point of space at a speed v in the vicinity of a
magnet, it is also subject to a force which is orthogonal to v. This can be experimented
by observing a current-carrying conductor (inside which charges ﬂow) near a
permanent magnet, such as a compass needle.
In a similar manner to (2.2) the magnet can be imagined as altering the behaviour of
space in which q moves by creating a ﬁeld B, which is related to the force produced on
the moving charge by the law
FL  q v  B
(2.9)
This expression clariﬁes that the force is orthogonal to v and B, proportional to q, and
that it also deﬁnes its direction.
Equation (2.9) deﬁnes the magnetic ﬂux density ﬁeld B. So we can issue the
following:
DEFINITION OF E AND B; LORENTZ’S FORCE LAW
23

Definition: Magnetic ﬂux density
Magnetic ﬂux density in a point of space is a vector that creates a force exerted on a
moving charge, in that point of space where no electric ﬁeld exists, according to
the relation FL  q v  B:
The general expression of the electric ﬁeld is obtained by summing the terms FC
and FL:
F  FC  FL  qE  v  B
(2.10)
Equation (2.10) is called the Lorentz force law, and F is called the Lorentz force.2
We will often need to deal with charges continuously ﬂowing within wires instead
of point charges. For these, a modiﬁed version of equation (2.9) can be derived.
Consider the left part of Figure 2.1.
During the time dt the charge dq traverses section x of the conductor shown. The
current i(t) is deﬁned (this concept will be discussed several times in this book) as the
rate at which the charge traverses any conductor’s cross section at a given time:
it  dq
dt
Therefore it is
dqv  i dt dx
dt  i dx
The effects of an existing ﬂux density B on the conductor current i that ﬂows through
the full conductor length (cf. the right-hand part of Figure 2.1) can be imagined as the
sum of the forces generated on each conductor segment dx: Ft  ∫l
dF. The force
dF, in turn, can be imagined as being due to the current element dI  Idx. Therefore,
x + dx

I = dq/dt 
FIGURE 2.1. Charges ﬂowing inside a conductor.
2Some authors call equation (2.9) the Lorentz force law, and this has suggested our subscript. However,
modern texts tend to call (2.10) the Lorentz law. Just for your curiosity: one of Lorentz’s greatest
achievements is the so-called Lorentz transformation, which is the basic foundation of main pillar relativity
theory. Lorentz’s transformation applied to Coulomb’s law gives (2.10).
24
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

an equivalent representation of formula (2.9), but referring to a current on a conductor
instead of a free charge q, is
dF  ∫l
I dx  B  dI  B  I  B dx
(2.11)
where dx is an inﬁnitesimal length of the conductor carrying current I, directed as I.
Equation (2.11) is normally referred to as Laplace’s equation of electromagneti-
cally induced force, or Laplace’s force law.
The forces produced on charge ﬂows by a magnetic ﬂux density ﬁeld B are
expressed in a simple way when the speed v or the direction of the conductor in which
the current l ﬂows are orthogonal to B:
F  v ? B ? q
F  I ? B ? l
when v ? B
(2.12)
To ﬁnd the direction of the force vector, we can use the right-hand rule: we consider,
in the order given, the directions of the ﬁrst and second factors of (2.12). If they are
oriented like the index and middle ﬁngers of the right hand, then the corresponding
forces are oriented like the thumb of the same hand. Similarly, if the thumb has the
same direction as v or I while the index has the same direction as B, the force will have
the direction of the middle ﬁnger. Finally, the procedure can be repeated by aligning
the middle ﬁnger with v or I and aligning the thumb with B.
If the order of the indexes were considered in the wrong way, the direction of the
third ﬁnger would give an erroneous (opposite) direction for the force.
2.3
GAUSS’S LAW
An important consequence of Coulomb’s law (2.6) is Gauss’s law.
Before proceeding to Gauss’s law, let us ﬁrst deﬁne the ﬂux ϕ of a vector ﬁeld G
across a surface A. It is a scalar quantity deﬁned as follows:
ϕ  ∫∫
A
G  dA
(2.13)
where dA is the elemental surface—that is, a vector having as magnitude the
elemental scalar surface dA which is orthogonal to the surface itself. Particularly
important is the ﬂux traversing a closed surface A (a closed surface is one surrounding
a volume, e.g. the surface of a sphere, a cube, etc.).
Gauss’s theorem states that:
Law: Gauss’s law
The ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld through any closed surface A(v), surrounding volume v
of space containing the electric charge Q, measured as coming out, equals Q/ε.
GAUSS’S LAW
25

Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows:
∫∫
A
E  dA  Q=ε
(2.14)
A more precise formulation of Gauss’s law is provided in the following More in
Depth box.
More in Depth A: Gauss’s law
Gauss’s law is one of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism; however, it can
simply be regarded as a consequence of (2.2) and thus will not often be mentioned
in relation to electric power engineering.
To express Gauss’s law, it is useful to ﬁrst deﬁne the vector D as the electrical ﬂux
density proportional to the electric ﬁeld, by means of the permittivity deﬁned when
discussing equation (2.6):
D  εE
The ﬂux across a surface A of the electrical ﬂux density is called electric ﬂux Ψ:
Ψ  ∫∫
A
D  dA
Gauss’s law can be stated a follows: the electrical ﬂux through a closed surface
A(v) surrounding volume v of space containing the electric charge Q equals Q,

2.4
AMPÈRE’S LAW AND CHARGE CONSERVATION
In the previous section, we introduced equation (2.9), allowing us to evaluate the force
exerted on a moving charge q by what has been called magnetic ﬁeld B. Indeed that
equation was introduced thinking of the force exerted on a moving charge by a nearby
magnet, and the magnetic ﬂux density B is thought of as a modiﬁcation of the space at
the point in which q resides, due to the presence of the magnet.
26
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

It can be experimentally observed that the same effect on a moving charge q can be
induced by an electric current (i.e., a continuous ﬂow of charge) in a conductor.
The situation can be visualized in Figure 2.2. The dot in the centre of the
conductor’s cross-sectional area in the right-hand part of the ﬁgure indicates, by
convention, that the current in this conductor is moving upward from the page (i.e., it
is directed toward the reader’s eyes).
Therefore, current I in the conductor produces, at the point of the moving charge, a
magnetic ﬂux density B.
Another ﬁeld used in electromagnetics, closely related to the magnetic ﬂux density,
is the magnetic ﬁeld H. Fields H and B are related to each other by the following
relation:
B  μH
(2.15)
in which μ, called magnetic permeability, is a constant characteristic of the matter
existing in the point of space in which H and B are evaluated.
A relation which is more complex than equation (2.15) will be discussed in the latter part
of Chapter 7.
The correlation between H, B, and I for the system shown in Figure 2.2 is
B  μI
2πr
(2.16)
where H  H
j
j and the direction of H is along the circumference in the plane
orthogonal to the wire direction containing the point where H is evaluated.
Another signiﬁcant case is when a coil with N turns is wound along a toroid such as
the one in the ﬁgure below. Here the toroid length l is much greater than the cross-
sectional diameter in all points of the toroid:
H ≅NI

The quantity NI, interpreted as a “force” that tends to generate the magnetic ﬁeld, is
called “magnetomotive force” (MMF).
Magnetic ﬁeld H (and therefore magnetic ﬂux density B, related to it by the
proportionality relation (2.15), is nonconservative. Therefore the work along a closed
path can be nonzero.
For instance, the works of H and B along the circular path shown in the ﬁgure
above are
WH  ∮l
H  dl  Hl  NI ≠0;
WB  ∮l
B  dl  μNI ≠0
Equations (2.16) and (2.17) constitute two common forms of Ampère’s law.
More in Depth B: Pointwise Ampère’s law and Maxwell’s extension
To generalize equation (2.16), we consider current I as the ﬂux of a vector “current
density” J through the cross section of a conductor:
I  ∫∫

J  dA
The current density J is due to moving charges in a conductive material (metal,
electrolytic solution), so that dI  J  dA is the current ﬂowing into the inﬁnitesi-
mal surface dA, as indicated in the diagram below.

THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

This way we can introduce a new version of Ampère’s law, of which the ﬁrst of
(2.16) is just a particular application as follows:
∮
l
H  dl  ∫∫
Al
J  dA
(2.B.1)
that is, the work of the magnetic ﬁeld along a path l is equal to the current crossing
any surface A(l) with l as contour. From (2.B.1) we can immediately obtain (2.16):
in this case the left-hand term of (2.B.1) is equal to 2πrH and the right-hand term is
equal to I.
Ampère’s law was modiﬁed by Maxwell, who expanded on the term “current
density” to create total current density, that is, the sum of conduction and
displacement current densities:
Jt  J  @D
@t
where @D=@t is by deﬁnition the displacement current density (D is deﬁned in the
More in Depth box A).
The Ampère–Maxwell law is therefore

Al
Jt  dA  ∫∫
Al
J  @D



 dA
(2.B.2)
Remember that for the equation signs to be correct, the curve l must be traversed
in a direction that an observer, looking at the head of vector A, sees as counter-
clockwise.
Maxwell’s addition to Ampère’s law has had a tremendous impact on electro-
magnetics and enables the explanation and mathematical description of the
generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Although Maxwell’s
addition to Ampère’s law is never used in this book in the form (2.B.2), its
consequences are always present behind the scenes.
Another important law of electromagnetism is the so-called continuity law (or
charge conservation law). In its simplest formulation it states the following:
Law: Continuity equation (charge conservation)
In steady state, the electric charge contained in a given region of space is constant.
AMPÈRE’S LAW AND CHARGE CONSERVATION
29

However, in variable conditions, the charge contained in a given region of space
can change.
A more general and complete approach to the continuity equation makes use of
Ampère’s, Maxwell’s, and Gauss’s equations and produces a result that is valid not
only in steady state but also in variable conditions. It is provided in the following
More in Depth box.
More in Depth C: Continuity equation
The most complete version of the continuity equation law can be obtained by
merging (2.A.1) with (2.B.2).
Consider a volume v bound by surface A, as in the diagram below. If the surface is
crossed by an arbitrary plane π, the curve l is determined and A is decomposed into
its constituting parts A1 and A2.
Equation (2.B.2) says that ∮l
H  dl  ∫∫

Therefore, since A  A1  A2, ∫∫

(2.C.1)
that is, “the total charge leaving a ﬁxed volume v bound by surface A is always
null,” where the total charge ﬂow is obviously the ﬂow of the total current density
as deﬁned in (2.B.2).
An equivalent form is

This relation in fact states that ‘the charge leaving any ﬁxed volume v bound by

accumulated inside v’.

2.4.1
Magnetic Field and Matter
Equation (2.15) indicates generic proportionality between magnetic ﬁeld and mag-
netic ﬂux density. The magnetic permeability μ of the matter containing the two ﬁelds
is important.
The reference value is the permeability of vacuum μ0  4π.107 H/m. For many
materials, permeability is very close to this value (air, water, lead, copper, aluminium,
etc.) Some have slightly greater permeability than a vacuum and are called para-
magnetic, while others have slightly less and are called diamagnetic.
Other materials, which are very important in electric power engineering, are called
ferromagnetic and have μ  μ0. The ratio for ferromagnetic materials μ/μ0 is usually
greater than 105; for instance, highly puriﬁed iron (from which the name ferromag-
netic derives) is around 2 ? 105.
Indeed, in ferromagnetic materials the link between H and B is not a simple
proportionality like that of (2.15); rather, a more complex relation applies. This
complexity is discussed to some extent in Chapter 7 of this book.
It is demonstrated in electromagnetics that a consequence of μ  μ0 for
ferromagnetic materials is that whenever there is some source of magnetic ﬁeld
in a space containing air (or other nonferromagnetic material) and ferromagnetic
material, the magnetic ﬁeld concentrates in the latter, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.

AMPÈRE’S LAW AND CHARGE CONSERVATION
31

In particular, the right-hand part of the ﬁgure shows a coil wound around a
ferromagnetic toroid. If it carries some current, the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂows nearly entirely within the toroid itself, as a consequence of the very high
ratio μFe/μair. This can be visualized by considering that the great majority of ﬁeld
lines are inside the toroid and only a small part ﬂows, at least partly, through air;
or, equivalently, by considering that the largest part of the ﬂux in the cross section
of the coil ﬂows in the toroid and only a small percentage of it, called leakage ﬂux,
ﬂows, at least partly, through air.
This is the basic reason why electric machines always have iron cores: they are
based on magnetic phenomena, and the iron core is very important for causing
magnetic ﬂux to ﬂow, in a concentrated manner, inside predeﬁned ﬂux tubes. This
will be ﬁrst discussed in Chapter 7, in which we introduce magnetic circuits, and then
in all the other chapters in Part III of this book.
2.5
FARADAY’S LAW
Before introducing Faraday’s law, consider again deﬁnition (2.13) of the ﬂux of a
vector ﬁeld across a surface. If this deﬁnition is applied to magnetic ﬂux density B, it
becomes
ϕ  ∫∫
A
B  dA
(2.18)
which deﬁnes the magnetic ﬂux ϕ.
In addition, we need to deﬁne the concept of “electromotive force,” often
abbreviated as EMF. The name of this quantity suggests that it is an entity that
causes charges to ﬂow in a wire. If, for instance, we connect a small battery to a
portable lamp, the battery exerts some force on the charges inside the conductors, and
inside the lamp itself, and causes them to ﬂow through the lamp wires (see diagram
below). Because of this behaviour, this entity is called electromotive force.

Although the entity causing charges to ﬂow in the conductor is called electro-
motive force, it is not a real “force” according to the concept of force used in
32
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

mechanics. In fact, more strictly speaking, an electromotive force is any cause that
creates a difference of electric potentials in two points of an electric wire. For instance
the battery of the previous ﬁgure can be imagined as creating a difference of potentials
UAB  VAVB. Any such difference of potentials is called voltage. Referring again to
(2.5) and (2.8), it is clear that UAB is the work done by the battery per unit charge
ﬂowing. So if in a given time charge Q ﬂows, the total energy delivered by the battery
is the work done, that is,
E  WABuQ  VA  VBQ  UABQ
(2.19)
The battery’s electromotive force is the cause that creates UAB, and it is equal to UAB
as measured when the load (here the lamp) is disconnected from the circuit.
Equation (2.19) conﬁrms that “electromotive forces” are not actual forces because
they are conceived in mechanics but, instead, work per unit charge.
The mathematical expression of EMF will depend on the physical mechanism that
produces it. The mechanism of producing electromotive forces in batteries will not be
discussed here.
Naturally, batteries create electromotive forces that are constant over time (in
reality they vary, but very slowly). In many cases in electric engineering we use time-
varying electromotive forces that can be produced, for instance, through the applica-
tion of Faraday’s law.
Faraday’s law indicates that when a coil (i.e., one or more loops of a wire) is
traversed by time-varying magnetic ﬂux, an electromotive force is produced that tends
to circulate charges in the load to which the coil is connected, and this law expresses a
mathematical formulation of that EMF. Consider the diagram below. It shows a coil
(also called winding) constituted by N turns, traversed by the same ﬂux ϕ which is a
function of time. Faraday’s law states that
Ef   dψ
dt  N dϕ
dt
(2.20)
+
Ef
I
Load 
N
ϕ
where ϕ is the magnetic ﬂux traversing the coil and Ef is the electromotive force
produced by the ﬂux variation. The so-called linked ﬂux ψ is simply equal to Nϕ.
The minus sign of Ef has a special meaning. It shows that the induced Ef is such
that, if connected to an outside load, it tends to cause a current that generates a ﬂux in
opposition to the variation of ϕ.
In other words, when ϕ is increasing, Ef tends to cause a current in a load that
produces a ﬂux opposite to ϕ (such as a positive I in the ﬁgure); when ϕ is decreasing,
FARADAY’S LAW
33

Ef tends to cause a current that enforces ϕ (i.e. a current in the opposite direction to I).
The “” marker in the previous diagram thus indicates the positive terminal when the
ﬂux is increasing.
The fact that current I in the ﬁgure creates a ﬂux which is opposite to ϕ can be
veriﬁed using the right-hand rule.3
Often ﬂux ϕ and linked ﬂux ψ are simply due to the current circulating in the wire
where Ef appears. In this case, it is useful to evaluate Ef in relation to I instead of ϕ or
ψ  Nϕ. This is easily done by relating the reference directions of I and ϕ to each other
through the right-hand rule. I and ϕ in the diagram below correspond to the right-hand
rule.

In this case Faraday’s law is simply

Now (as always in circuits) the “” marker indicates the reference sign: when
Ef > 0 the actual polarity will correspond to the marker, if Ef < 0 is opposite to it. The
expression “electromotive force” is often abbreviated as e.m.f. or EMF.
We can summarise Faraday’s law as follows:
Law: Faraday’s law
When a time-varying magnetic ﬂux traverses a coil, an electromotive force is
produced that is proportional to the linked ﬂux ψ time derivative.
The sign of this electromotive force tends to cause the ﬂow of a current which
opposes the change of ψ.
3The rule is applied as follows. Using the right hand, curl the ﬁngers and align them to the wire loop
windings in such a way that the ﬁnger tips are oriented like arrowheads in the direction of the loop current;
the thumb indicates the reference direction of ﬂux (the arrowhead is its tip).

More in Depth D: Pointwise Faraday’s law
Using the magnetic and electric ﬁelds of different points of space, Faraday’s law
can be stated as follows: “The line integral of the electric ﬁeld strength E over a
closed path l equals the ﬂux of the magnetic ﬂux density time derivative across any
surface A(l) bound by l.”

(2.D.1)
The minus sign in equation (2.D.1) is a consequence of the deﬁnition assumed
for E, B.
Clearly, changing a sign in the deﬁnition for E or B would turn that sign into a
plus. However, this is not advisable since the signs assumed here are the same
as those used all over the world and are even included in International
standards.
2.6
GAUSS’S LAW FOR MAGNETISM
The solenoidal nature of magnetic ﬁelds implies that the ﬂux of B (or, equivalently,
the ﬂux of H) across any closed surface is always zero, whatever the ﬁeld and the
surface:
∯

B  dA  0
(2.21)
Note that relation (2.21) has the same structure as Gauss’s law (2.14), except that the
right-hand term is zero. This is sometimes interpreted as “no magnetic charge exists in
nature.”4
The distinct similarity between (2.21) and (2.14) justiﬁes the name given to this
law, even though it is the result of several studies and has no speciﬁc link with Gauss’s
work.
Gauss’s law for magnetism can be expressed in simpler terms as follows:
The force lines of B and H  B/μ are always closed loops.
4In fact, magnets are always constituted by magnetic dipoles: no individual “positive” or “negative”
magnetic charges have ever been experimentally found.

CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS OF MATTER
2.7.1
General Considerations
In general, electric and magnetic phenomena occur in different ways depending on
whether they occur in an empty space or in point of space where matter exists.
In fact, matter reacts to electric and magnetic phenomena, modifying them: the
way in which matter interacts with ﬁelds is deﬁned by the so-called constitutive
equations (or constitutive relations).
Here we disregard the possibility of anisotropic behaviour—that is, behaviour of
matter that depends on the direction of ﬁelds applied to it—since it is well beyond the
scope of this book. Thus the constitutive equations of matter are the following:
D  εE
B  μH
J  σE
where ε, μ, and σ are constants, in general depending on the point of space considered,
and are called permittivity, permeability, and conductibility, respectively. These
constants were used in the preceding sections in the description of electromagnetic
laws in basic terms, since in basic electromagnetics, by tradition, there is no rigorous
distinction between laws and constitutive equations.
The third of these constitutive equations—that is, σE  J or E  ρJ (where
ρ  1/σ is the resistivity of the substance considered)—is often called pointwise
Ohm’s law.
2.7.2
Continuous Charge Flow Across Conductors
Because of its importance, pointwise Ohm’s law requires some further explanation. It
can be helpful to have a look inside a current-carrying conductor.
Classic electromagnetics theory assumes that conductors contain electrons, that is,
charges able to move freely within the conductor. Indeed, these charges move very
rapidly as a consequence of thermal agitation, with speeds on the order of 106 m/s.
This movement, however, causes them to collide with the conductor lattice. When an
external electric ﬁeld (i.e., a force per unit charge) is applied, the charges are
accelerated in such a way that a drift speed, on the order of 104 m/s, is superimposed
on the thermal speed. This drift speed of charges is macroscopically seen as a current
(charge per unit of time) ﬂow.
This justiﬁes the fact that an electric ﬁeld causes some current to ﬂow and that the
greater the electric ﬁeld, the greater the charge ﬂow, and therefore the current.
The force applied to the charges induces them to accelerate, so the resulting speed,
if there were no collisions, would increase indeﬁnitely. The effect of collisions is,
however, similar to some damping of the charging movement; therefore, applying an
external force to a charge cloud causes the speed to rise to a regime value determined
by the equilibrium between force applied and force due to damping, in turn due to
36
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

collisions. It can be demonstrated, however, that this regime speed is reached in times
that are very small with respect to the application of the external electrical ﬁeld, on the
order of 1014 s: this time is so small that it can be neglected in all the applications of
electric power engineering. It is thus possible to state pointwise Ohm’s law, in which
the electric ﬁeld is assumed to be proportional to the electric current density, that is,
the force applied to the charges is proportional to the charge (regime) drift speed.
This result can be obtained mathematically by taking into account only the effects
of electric ﬁeld E, and therefore force F1 of (2.10). Using this simpliﬁcation, the
electric charge speed can be found as the solution of the following equation:
m dv
dt  m
τ v  eE
(°)
where m and e are the electron mass and charge, respectively, and E is the electric
ﬁeld; τ, the time constant of the equation, can be computed from known physical
parameters: for copper, as already mentioned, it is around 1014 s.
Given equation (°), if an external ﬁeld E is applied to a charge q, it will ﬁrst be
accelerated, but will soon (3–5 times the value of τ) reach the regime velocity vreg  eE
τ/m. The value of τ is so small that in nearly all the circuits and systems studied by
electrical engineers the transient in which v varies can be neglected and electrons can
be assumed as all having the same regime velocity:
v ≅τ
m eE
Drift speed and current are related to each other. Consider the diagram below,
showing a piece of conducting material carrying current. In the inﬁnitesimal time
interval dt the charges ﬂow in the conductor at the drift speed v  dx/dt, and the charge
contained in the volume of conductor along dx at the end of dt will have ﬂown through
the cross section of the conductor.
x x + dx 
dx 
The charge ﬂow can be correlated to the charges in the conductor. If n indicates the
number of electrons per unit volume and e the electric charge of an electron it will be:
dQ  ne dxS  I dt
and
dx  v dt  τ
m eE ? dt see also footnote 5
5Note that this equation allows us to write a relation between electric current and charge speed on the
conductor: I  dQ=dt  neS dx=dt  neSv.
CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS OF MATTER
37

Consequently,
ne τ
m eE ? dt ? S  I dt ) J  I
S  ne2 τ
m ? E
or
J  σE
with σ  ne2 τ
m
which allows us, using reasonable values for n, e, m, and σ, to evaluate τ, again giving
a value of about 1014 s.
The formula obtained, expressing the dependence of conductivity on various
parameters, is able to explain the experimental result that the conductivity of
conducting materials decreases with temperature. In metals, nearly all the electrons
move freely through the lattice, and therefore any increase in temperature will not
increase the number of free electrons; however, the temperature increase will cause
the lattice atoms to vibrate strongly, thus raising the probability of electrons hitting
them during their free movement and reducing the mean free time between
collisions τ.
It is also interesting to note that even in insulating materials, the proposed model
for (very small) conductions works well, even though the free electrons are very
limited in number. For insulating materials, however, the increase in free electrons
according to temperature will be signiﬁcant, and the effect of the increased atom
vibration will be more so. This explains the experimental result that the resistivity of
insulating materials reduces as temperature increases.
A ﬁnal point on pointwise Ohm’s law is that it relates the total force ﬁeld acting on
the charge within conductors in the direction of charge ﬂow and not only that
produced by electric charges in the space near the point considered.6 In cases when
more than a force ﬁeld is present, we can write
Et  ρJ
where Et is the total force ﬁeld acting on the charges, per unit of charge. For instance,
in Section 3.3.1, when a microscopic view of circuits justiﬁes the use of the abstract
circuit concept in physical DC circuits, the following is used:
Et  Ec  Es
where Ec is due to chemical reactions and Es is due to electric charges.
2.8
MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
During the eighteenth century the great scientist James Clerk Maxwell made an
outstanding contribution to the study of electromagnetism. He revised all the
equations previously introduced by other scientists and put them in good order.
6The demonstration based on equation (°) neglected the second term of equation (2.10). However, the
demonstration could be repeated, with more complex mathematical passages, for the more general case.
38
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

The whole set of electromagnetic phenomena could then be studied by making use of
his four equations, which were a reworking of Faraday’s, Ampere’s and Gauss’ laws,
as well as Gauss’s law for magnetism. All these laws have been recalled in this
chapter. Naturally the three constitutive equations of matter recalled in Section 2.7
should be added.
Maxwell also wrote these laws in differential forms, which have proven to be very
useful to scientists who study complex electromagnetic phenomena. These forms are,
however, beyond the scope of this book and will not be discussed here.
In addition to this activity of reordering previous laws, Maxwell gave another
exceptional contribution to electromagnetics: he modiﬁed Ampere’s law, adding the
term @D=@t to the current density vector J to obtain the total current density Jt (see
More in Depth B). This addition dramatically changed the whole landscape of
electromagnetic phenomena.
With this addition, Maxwell was able to mathematically show that a variable
electric ﬁeld produces a magnetic ﬁeld, and vice versa. The two ﬁelds are closely
concatenated to form a unique comprehensive phenomenon, called the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld is ubiquitous in our lives: all wireless transmissions,
from radio and TV signals to mobile phone communication and Wi-Fi networks, to
name just a few, make use of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a medium. Even light is a
form of electromagnetic ﬁeld. Electromagnetic ﬁelds, however, are beyond the scope
of this book.
Is it possible to study electric and magnetic phenomena while disregarding the fact
that time-varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds are concatenated? The answer is yes,
within given limits. It can indeed be said that physical systems in which electric and
magnetic phenomena occur can be studied while disregarding electromagnetic ﬁeld
propagation whenever their size is small in comparison to the length of the electro-
magnetic wave.
It could be demonstrated, starting from Maxwell’s equations written in their
differential form, that the electromagnetic wave moves at the speed c  1=

which, for empty space and air, equals:
c 

If we want to study systems with a maximum size of a few metres while disregarding
radiation of electromagnetic ﬁelds, we must limit the study to relatively slow variation
of all the quantities (voltages, currents, etc.).
In fact for the electromagnetic wave, as for all waves, the following simple relation
between frequency f, speed v, and wavelength λ applies:
ν  λf
MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
39

As a consequence, if we want, for instance, to limit our scope to systems not larger
than 10–100 metres, all analyses can be made while disregarding the radiation of
electromagnetic ﬁelds if the following constraint is met:
λ  10  100 m ) f  300 ? 106 m=s=10  100 m  3  30 MHz
(2.22)
Rule: Validity of analysis of electric and magnetic phenomena while disregard-
ing the concatenation of electric and magnetic ﬁelds
In the case of systems of up to 10–100 m in size, electric and magnetic ﬁeld
concatenation can be disregarded when operational frequencies up to a few
megahertz are considered.
This entire book up to Chapter 15 is written on the basis that rule (2.22) is valid!
Chapter 15, indeed, deals with much larger systems, up to a few thousand
kilometres. These are studied at the so-called industrial frequency, that is, 50 Hz
or 60 Hz. For these frequencies, the wavelength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is 5000–
6000 km. Thus, even for these large systems, when they are operated at the industrial
frequency, electromagnetic radiation can be neglected.

HISTORICAL NOTES
2.9.1
Short Biography of Faraday
Michael Faraday7 (London, England 1791–London, England 1867) was a chemist
and physicist and is considered one of the best experimentalists who ever lived. He
ﬁrst taught himself chemistry, working in particular on electrochemistry. He founded
the fundamental laws of electrolysis. Later he also worked successfully on
electromagnetism.
His main achievements were the quantitative evaluation of the electric charge per
mole of electrons, today called Faraday’s constant, and the mathematical expression
of induction law, today called Faraday’s law. This law is very important in Electrical
Engineering and will be quoted many times throughout this book.
He also made important contributions in other ﬁelds of physics.
His importance in electromagnetism is sealed by the adoption in the SI of the farad
(symbol: F) for the unit of measure of capacitance of capacitors.

Short Biography of Gauss
Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss8 (Braunschweig, Germany 1777–Hannover, Germany,
1855) is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians ever. He was also an

excellent physicist and astronomer. As a mathematician he made many contributions
to various ﬁelds: the demonstration of the fundamental theorem of algebra, the
graphical representation of complex numbers, and the distribution of statistical errors
(today called the Gaussian curve) and theorems relating to the curvature of surfaces.
He also ﬁrst hypothesized the existence of non-Euclidean geometries.
His contribution to electromagnetics was also very important. His fundamental
theory is today called Gauss’s ﬂux theorem.
2.9.3
Short Biography of Maxwell
James Clerk Maxwell (Edinburgh, Scotland, 1831–Cambridge, England, 1879) was
one of the greatest physicists of all times, whose work is often compared to that of
Newton and Einstein. His most important contributions are in gas kinetic theory and
electromagnetism. As regards the latter, he uniﬁed all the electromagnetism laws,
which proved to be highly effective; all electromagnetics phenomena were then
summarized in his four famous equations. From these equations, he demonstrated the
existence of electromagnetic waves and that electricity, magnetism and even light are
all manifestations of the same phenomenon, the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
His analyses included the introduction of a new term in Ampère’s law [the term
@D=@t in (2.B.2)], with the concept of displacement current, allowing him to develop
his theory and demonstrate the electromagnetic wave.
At the time of his death, Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism was one of several.
Its validity was established only in 1887, when it was experimentally veriﬁed by
Hertz.
2.9.4
Short Biography of Ampère
André Marie Ampère (Lyon 1775, Marseille 1836) was a French physicist and
mathematician, credited for laying down some of the basis of electromagnetism.
Ampère showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel
each other, depending on whether the currents ﬂow in the same or opposite directions,
respectively. On the basis of these experiments and by applying his deep knowledge
of mathematics, he formulated the famous law that bears his name (see Section 2.4).
Ampère offered courses in mathematics, theoretical and experimental physics,
philosophy, and astronomy at the University of Paris, at the prestigious Collège de
France, and at the new École Polytechnique.
The SI unit of measurement of electric current, the ampere, is named after him.
2.9.5
Short Biography of Lorentz
Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (Arnhem—The Netherlands 1853, Haarlem 1928) was a
Dutch physicist who reﬁned Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory since his doctoral
thesis, “The theory of the reﬂection and refraction of light,” presented in 1875.
Before the existence of electrons was proved, he proposed that light waves were
due to oscillations of an electric charge in the atom. Lorentz developed a rigorous

mathematical theory of the electron’s behaviour, for which he received the Nobel
Prize in 1902.
Professor of mathematical physics at Leiden University, he also derived the
transformation equations subsequently used by Albert Einstein to describe space
and time in his relativity theory. Lorentz’s transformation applied to Coulomb’s law
gives the Lorentz’s force law described in Section 2.2.

For the Instructor
This chapter differs in approach from similar textbooks, in that it makes a clear
distinction between physical systems and models.
Since no uniform terminology exists in common books, the following deﬁnitions
have been adopted:
• Circuital systems, that is, physical systems constituted by devices connected by
wires, which make good candidates for modelling using lumped-component
models.
• Circuits, that is, actual (lumped-component) models.
This approach has several advantages:
• It helps the student (i.e., the future engineer) to become accustomed to (a) the
importance of modelling a physical system and (b) the corresponding need to
evaluate the effects of what is disregarded in the process. This activity will be
useful throughout the student’s working life.

• It allows a clear distinction between electromagnetism laws (i.e., Maxwell’s
equations written in more or less complicated forms) and Kirchhoff’s laws,
which are assumed to be valid, by deﬁnition, for all circuits.
The authors’ decision to make this shift from the more frequent approach was
based on years of teaching experience and of tackling students’ daily needs and
doubts. It is hoped that this approach will be appreciated by teachers and,
consequently, that students will also ﬁnd it useful.
3.1
INTRODUCTION
Electrical engineers spend much of their time working with electric circuits, or
simply circuits. The word circuits is used to indicate graphical/mathematical tools
used in descriptions of systems in which charges ﬂow constantly (so-called direct-
current circuits), or are sinusoidal (so-called alternating-current circuits), or in
which they vary in a general way. They are able to model electronic boards, home
and industrial electrical installations, the inner behaviour of electrical machines,
and so on.
In this book, the physical systems that circuits are intended to model, whenever
precision is necessary, will be called circuital systems.
More in Depth
Written texts (textbooks, articles, brochures) often fail to emphasize the difference
between a physical system and its model. This is erroneous, because physical
systems have a given behaviour that can be modelled with different degrees of
precision.
For instance, the wheel of a car may simply be an ideal rigid, rolling cylinder for
some purposes. But if we want to evaluate the forces generated by collisions,
elasticity must be taken into account; to evaluate energy losses we must also
consider rubber hysteresis, and if we want to evaluate the response to lateral forces,
further characteristics must be assessed.
Differentiating between physical systems and their models is very important
because in order to draw a model from a system, assumptions have to be made, and
the results of the model analysis can be applied to the given system only if these
assumptions are met to a sufﬁcient degree of precision.
That is why in this book we have taken great care to distinguish between physical
systems and their models—that is, circuital systems and circuits.
46
CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Consider, for instance, the simple system shown in Figure 3.1. It shows an electric
sinusoidal generator feeding two lamps with the interposition of a couple of wires,
which are represented ‘thick’ because, in a physical system, they not only have length
but also width and depth.
Obviously, our analysis of this system would be greatly simpliﬁed if, instead of
having to simultaneously analyse all points of space using the laws of electro-
magnetism (see Chapter 1), it were possible to write independent equations of the
individual elements involved and link them using additional congruence equations.
A qualitative analysis of Figure 3.1 shows that the generator is connected to the
lamps with long wires, while there are short connections at the two horizontal sides of
the circuit.
It is intuitively understood that, if the effect of space around the wires is not
signiﬁcant for what happens inside the system components, the system in Figure 3.1
can be studied as being constituted by connection of its main elements, as indicated in
Figure 3.2. The elements are the generator, the two lamps, and the two long wires,
while the short wires used for connecting the lamps to the longer wires can be ignored.
All elements have terminals—that is, points used to connect them to the other circuital
elements. In the ﬁgure, terminals are indicated as small white circles. Thin lines
represent ideal wires—that is, graphical symbols indicating that what happens in the
circuit is exactly the same as if the components at each end were directly connected to
each other. Thin lines are therefore like ideal wires, able to transfer electric charge
from one point to another of space in an ideal way—that is, in such a way that charges
at one end are immediately transferred to the other end.
This step from the system in Figure 3.1 to the one in Figure 3.2 is dramatically
important: it implies that we have modelled a spatially distributed system (for which
all the ﬁelds connected to electromagnetic phenomena, such as electric ﬁeld E,
magnetic ﬁeld H, current density ﬁeld J, etc., have a value at each point of space) as a

lumped-elements system, whose behaviour is uniquely determined by the behaviour of
the boxes connected by ideal wires—expressed in terms of equations we will call
constitutive equations of the components (or elements)—and by the connections
made by the wires.
More speciﬁcally, we have modelled the distributed-parameter circuital system we
started out with, through a circuit which is a lumped-parameter model and much
simpler to analyse.
The ease of analysing electromagnetic systems using circuits will become increas-
ingly clear as the study of this book proceeds. But what kind of systems can be studied
as circuits?
To give a very simpliﬁed answer, we can say that these are what we earlier
called circuital systems—that is, systems which are physically constituted by (a)
devices (such as the generator, lamps, and long wires of Figure 3.1) that perform
complex actions, (b) the wires connecting them, and (c) some space around
these elements whose effects on the electrical phenomena inside them can be
disregarded.
These qualitative considerations are often too simpliﬁed. It must be stressed that if
a circuit is not correctly modelled on a physical system, the results of its analysis
(calculated currents and voltages) will differ from the actual values of the original
circuit, and this could lead to signiﬁcant, or even serious, errors. Therefore, in this and
the next two chapters, some discussion on the basic hypotheses of allowing a circuital
system to be modelled as a circuit will be presented.
The construction of a lumped-parameter model of a physical system is not unique.
For instance, if the current between the upper and lower conductors of the system in
Figure 3.1 cannot be ignored, the model shown in Figure 3.3 may be considered; here
the transmission line is a single lumped component which can also take into account
phenomena occurring between its upper and lower conductors.

signiﬁcant differences exist. Therefore, it is useful to summarise here all the major
deﬁnitions related to circuits used in this book.
The authors have carefully consulted the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary
(IEV) [s4], which is the most authoritative source of standardized terminology for all
electrical engineers all over the world. Therefore, the deﬁnitions used here usually
comply with those in the IEV. However, our wording is original and rather simpliﬁed,
given the book’s scope and readership. Where there are signiﬁcant differences from the
IEV, brief explanatory notes are added.
The following deﬁnitions are given in alphabetical order for the reader’s
convenience.
Branch. A branch is a circuit element with two terminals.
Branch-Based Circuit. A branch-based circuit is an electric circuit in which all
elements, except nodes, have two terminals.
The IEV does not give any deﬁnition for circuits with only two terminal components,
other than nodes. A deﬁnition speciﬁc to this book is necessary because of the
importance of this circuit topology.
Circuit (Electric Circuit). An electric circuit, or simply circuit, is a graphical—
mathematical tool that constitutes a lumped-component model of a circuital
system, consisting of lumped components connected to each other. These
components are the circuit elements. Since circuits are models of real systems,
circuits with different levels of accuracy can be produced for the same physical
system.
Notes
1. See note on the deﬁnition of circuital systems.
2. Circuit behaviour is deﬁned by the inner behaviour of circuit elements and by
their interconnection: no inﬂuence is possible between what happens outside
and what happens inside circuit wires and elements.
3. In this deﬁnition, no constraints are shown on the inner structure or behaviour
of the circuit elements. However, ideal transformers, very special circuit
elements which will be discussed in Chapter 5, play a particular role in circuits:
they are interconnecting elements for forming electric networks.
Circuit Element. A circuit element is a component of a circuit that is connected to
other components by means of connection points, called terminals.
Circuital System. A circuital system is a physical system containing elements
connected to each other through wires in such a way as to form one or more
closed loops. A circuital system is a spatially distributed (three-dimension)
system.
DEFINITIONS
49

IEV does not provide speciﬁc terminology to distinguish between physical systems and
mathematical models.
Ideal Wire. An ideal wire is a branch with terminals of the same potential value, so
that the voltage across its terminals is zero.
Node. A node is a point in a circuit in which three or more circuit elements are
connected to each other. A node may be represented in expanded form, when
connection of several elements is graphically represented as two or more
connections. See the example in Figure 3.17a.
Although this deﬁnition does not conform exactly to the one in the IEV, it is very
commonly used in textbooks.
Network (Electric Network). An electric network, or simply network, is a set of
circuits separated from each other by ideal transformers. Two circuits separated
by ideal transformers are also normally called magnetically coupled circuits.
Notes
1. In IEV, electric circuits and electric networks are treated as being equivalent.
2. Networks and ideal transformers will be introduced in this book in Section 5.3.3.

CHARGE CONSERVATION AND KIRCHHOFF’S
CURRENT LAW
3.3.1
The Charge Conservation Law
The reader should be already acquainted with the idea of charge conservation.
The charge conservation principle states that “the charge in a given region of space
remains constant over time.” However, studies carried out mainly in the nineteenth
century show that a charge which is the sum of individual charged elements
(electrons, ions) is not conserved, but can accumulate in elements of space. The
issue was solved by Maxwell, who deﬁned a new form of charge, called displacement
charge, which enables us to state the following:
Law: Total charge conservation
The total charge (sum of conduction and displacement charge) in any given region
of space remains perfectly constant over time.
Conduction charge is the charge that moves through conductor wires (electrons) or
conductive solutions (ions), while the displacement current is caused by the variation

This block is intended for those with some previous knowledge of the electro-
magnetic behaviour of a capacitor, and some basic knowledge of the behaviour of
a simple R-C circuit in which a capacitor is charged.
In the circuit shown below, if initially there is no charge in the conducting plates of
capacitor C, when switch sw is closed, some current ﬂows in the circuit, and net
charge enters the closed curve L.

Charge is thus accumulated inside the conducting plates, and therefore the charge
conservation principle does not apply. If, however, we assume that a special
current, called displacement current, ﬂows in the insulating layer (also called the
dielectric), i.e. the space between the conducting plates, and that this current is
exactly equal to the current i ﬂowing in the conductors outside the capacitor, then
total charge conservation applies, the total charge being due to both conduction
and displacement currents. In this case the total conducting plate charge will not
change, since the dielectric will absorb a displacement current that is equivalent to
the conduction current entering the upper conducting wire.
3.3.2
Charge Conservation and Circuits
In the qualitative analysis shown in Section 3.1, it was stated that circuital systems
may be correctly modelled by means of circuits when “the effects of space around the
wires is not signiﬁcant for what happens inside the system components.”
If the space around system components must not affect what occurs inside them, no
charge must ﬂow in that space. Consider again the system in Figure 3.1, shown also in
Figure 3.4.
The reader will already know that although materials are commonly classiﬁed as
either conducting or insulating, a perfect conductive material does not exist,1 nor does
1The case of “superconductivity,” which occurs at very low temperatures, is a separate subject and is not
discussed here.

a perfectly insulating one. Therefore, even though air is a well-insulating material,
some stray currents can also ﬂow through the air surrounding the wires—for example,
ﬂowing from the upper conductor toward the lower one (as indicated in Figure 3.4),
and vice versa.
If the system shown in Figure 3.1 is represented by the circuit of Figure 3.2, it
should be possible to neglect these stray currents. Indeed, this is very often acceptable;
although in some rare cases, stray currents are taken into account and different models
are used.
It is not enough to consider that the air surrounding the conductors is perfectly
insulating in the step from Figure 3.1 to Figure 3.2. It must be noted that the system of
Figure 3.1 is subject to variable quantities, since the generator is a component (which
we have not yet discussed in depth) able to determine a variable voltage at its ends.
Therefore all the quantities of the system in Figure 3.1 (currents, voltages, ﬁelds at all
of the points of space) vary with time. When quantities vary with time, displacement
currents can ﬂow between the upper and lower wires even though the air might be
assumed to be perfectly insulating. Indeed, upper and lower conductors can be
thought as being the two conductor plates of a capacitor whose insulating layer is the
air between them (Figure 3.5). Again, in the process that leads from circuital systems
to lumped-parameter circuits, neither conductive nor displacement currents must ﬂow
through the air (or space) interspersed between the ideal wires of any circuit.
Consider again one of the lumped-component models proposed for the system of
Figure 3.1—that is, the circuit also shown in Figure 3.3 and in Figure 3.6. Here, for
simplicity’s sake, the terminals are no longer speciﬁcally shown (the reader should
keep in mind that they always exist).

CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

In this ﬁgure, three different closed curves cross the circuit: a curve surrounding a
circuit node (type 1), one surrounding a single lumped element (type 2), and another
surrounding a group of elements and wires (type 3).
The charge conservation principle applies to these; therefore the global charge
entering the curves, whether conductive or displacement, must be equal to zero. But it
was also said that whenever a circuit is created, all displacement currents between
wires are negligible.
This is equivalent to saying that displacement currents can occur only inside circuit
elements.
Consequently, it can be concluded that the total (conductive) charge entering
through some of the wires that traverse any of the curves must be exactly equal to the
sum of those that ﬂow out. This is equivalent to saying that the sum of the charge
entering though some of the wires is identical to the sum of the charge exiting from the
others.
This is the rationale behind Kirchhoff’s law—that is, the charge conservation law
for circuits. In the next sections it will be expressed in a way which is more formal
(and more useful for practical computations).
3.3.3
The Electric Current
From their basic knowledge of electromagnetic phenomena, readers should already be
aware that electric charges inside conductor materials (namely electrons) are not
linked to atoms, but can move freely. If, therefore, a wire is made of conducting
material, these charges can move freely from one end of it to another.
Also in other conductors, such as electrolytic solutions, there are charges which are
free to move; while in conductor media the charge carriers are just electrons and are
negatively charged, in an electrolytic solution the charges are carried by ions that can
be either positive or negative.
In general, therefore, charge carriers in a conducting wire can move from left to
right or from right to left, and they can be positively or negatively charged.
It has been experimentally veriﬁed that a positive charge moving from left to right
is equivalent to a charge of the same size but with an opposite sign moving from right
to left (Figure 3.7a)2 and that the combined effect of a positive charge Q and a
negative charge Q is equivalent to a generic charge Q, assumed to be positive,
moving in the same direction as Q (Figure 3.7b).
Therefore, in the general case in which both positive charges move in either
direction in a conductor medium, the analysis can be performed by computing an
equivalent positive charge deﬁned as
Q  Q1  Q2
2For simplicity’s sake, this book, like most textbooks, will often say “a charge moves” rather than “a charge
carrier moves.”
CHARGE CONSERVATION AND KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW
53

where:
• Q1 is the algebraic sum of charges in the same direction as the direction assumed
for Q;
• Q2 is the algebraic sum of charges moving in the opposite direction to that
assumed for Q.
If we consider this equivalent charge Q (ﬂowing in time t through a cross section Σ
of a conductor (Figure 3.7b), the current I ﬂowing in the conductor is deﬁned as
I  Q
t
for continuous flow at a constant rate
If the ﬂow of charge varies over time, an inﬁnitesimal time interval dt can be
considered in which the charge ﬂowing through Σ is also inﬁnitesimal, and it can be
indicated as dq (remember that by convention, lowercase letters indicate quantities
that vary with time; see Section 1.3.4). In this case the current i(t), by deﬁnition, is
it  dqt
dt
for any flow constant or variable
Thus, the electric current is deﬁned as the rate at which the charges ﬂow. Since
charges are measured in coulomb (symbol: C) in the SI, the electric current will
therefore be measured in coulomb per second. Because of its importance, the electric
current has a unit of measure of its own, called ampere (symbol: A): one ampere is one
coulomb per second.

Definition: Ampere (unit of measure of current)
The unit of measure of current is the ampere (symbol: A).
One ampere is the charge ﬂow of one coulomb per second.3 In formula: 1 A 
(1 C)/(1 s)
To further clarify the deﬁnition and its sign, it can be stated that a current of 1 A
moving from left to right can be equivalent to either (a) one positive coulomb charge
crossing a given surface in one second from left to right or (b) one negative coulomb
charge crossing a given surface in one second from right to left.
3.3.4
Formulations of Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Consider a generic closed curve drawn in a circuit, in such a way that it does not cross
any lumped component of the circuit, but only wires.
The situation is represented in Figure 3.8a, where just the curve and the traversing
wires are shown (the parts of the circuit inside and outside the curve are omitted).
Since we are considering a circuit, no charge can ﬂow outside conductors and
lumped elements; only conductive charge can ﬂow from the inner to the outer curve
and vice versa, through wires.
Needless to say that while for clarity we have shown only ﬁve wires traversing the closed
curve, our reasoning is valid for any number of wires.
Imagine that this charge (considered as a positive charge, as discussed earlier)
ﬂows from the outside of the loop toward the inside, as shown by the arrows near the
currents in the ﬁgure.
3Students should know from their study of electromagnetism that this is not the SI’s deﬁnition, although the
SI does not contradict it; it is proposed here because it is more effective for students’ understanding at this
point of the book.

Let dqk be the inﬁnitesimal charge entering or exiting the curve in the inﬁnitesimal
time interval dt from wire k, where the directions are represented by arrows. The
charge conservation for circuits (Section 3.2.2) tells us that the charge inside
the dashed curve must remain constant, and therefore the charge entering must equal
the one exiting:
dq2  dq4  dq5  dq1  dq3
charge flows as per Figure 3:8a
dq2  dq3  dq5  dq1  dq4
charge flows as per Figure 3:8b
and, dividing by the corresponding time interval dt and moving all terms on the left-
hand sides, we obtain
i1t  i2t  i3t  i4t  i5t  0
currents directed as per Figure 3:8a
i1t  i2t  i3t  i4t  i5t  0
currents directed as per Figure 3:8b
Note that in some cases dependence on time t is explicitly shown by i(t), while in other
cases it is implicit. In all cases, however, the equations indicating the charge conservation
law, whether expressed in terms of charges or currents, are valid at any time.
Unfortunately, we do not know in advance the actual direction of charge ﬂows. To
allow writing of equations ahead of knowing them, we consider the numbers q(t) and
i(t) as real numbers, which can therefore have positive or negative values.
Now we must remember what we already discussed in Section 3.2.3—that is, that
charge ﬂowing in one direction is exactly equivalent to a ﬂow in the opposite direction
of a charge having the opposite sign. Therefore it is very natural to state the following
convention:
Convention: Current sign
The number indicating a current i is a real number indicating the charge ﬂow per
unit of time; its positive or negative sign indicates whether or not the ﬂow direction
is in agreement with the arrow near the current name i. The arrow is called
reference direction of current i.
With the help of this convention, instead of dealing with actual charge ﬂow
directions, we can use the reference directions. Therefore, the current equations of
Figure 3.8 are still valid when the arrows are not the actual current directions, but just
reference (or, for some authors, assumed) current directions.
This means that we can write the equations shown in Figure 3.8, considering
currents as being real numbers, whose value will be positive whenever the actual
charge ﬂow4 is in agreement to the assumed directions and negative in the
opposite case.
4Remember that we consider ﬂow of positive charges.
56
CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Now consider a special set of assumed directions: all directions entering the zone
for which we want to state charge conservation law. In this case this law can be stated
simply as follows: the sum of currents at all terminals of a circuit element, assumed to
be entering, must always be identically zero.
This is obviously mathematically equivalent to saying that the sum of currents of
all terminals of an element, assumed to be leaving it, must always be identically zero.
In the following, whenever this does not cause ambiguity, the word “assumed” is
omitted; therefore, for a branch current indicated by a symbol, the expressions “current
assumed entering . . .” and “current assumed exiting . . .” will be substituted by
“current entering . . .” and “current exiting. . . .”
When analysing a circuit, it often occurs that current reference directions do not all
enter or leave a curve. Thus, alternative formulations are needed for generic assumed
directions. They can be as follows (subscript “in” indicating assumed sign entering the
curve, “out” indicating signs assumed exiting):
X
n_in
k1
ik;int 
X
n_out
k1
ik;outt  0;
the sum of all currents entering a closed
curve in a circuit identically equals
the sum of all currents leaving it:
(3.1)
X
n_in
k1
ik;int 
X
n_out
k1
ik;outt  0;
if all currents are taken as entering; the
algebraic sum of all currents entering a
closed curve in a circuit is identically zero:
(3.2)
When charge conservation is applied to a curve of types 1, 2, or 3 in Figure 3.6, it
gives rise to speciﬁc versions, stating that the sum of currents assumed to be entering
any node, any circuit element, or any subcircuit is always zero.
In the previous examples (for instance, those shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3), circuit
elements have two or more terminals, through which they can exchange charge with
their exterior. It will be seen that, except for nodes, in the large majority of cases
circuit elements will have two terminals. Given their importance, they need a name of
their own; therefore they will be called branches.5
When analysing circuit branches, the charge conservation law is applied from the
very ﬁrst stage, simply using a unique value for the currents at their two ends.
Consider Figure 3.9. It is clear that the use of a single current ﬂowing in branch A
(e.g., iA shown in Figure 3.9b is more convenient than using different names for the
currents at the two sides of element A, as indicated in Figure 3.9a); and add equations
stating their algebraic equality.
Now we can state Kirchhoff’s current law in three equivalent forms used in circuit
analysis.
5The reader is advised to refer to Section 3.2 for deﬁnitions of branches and branch-based circuits.
CHARGE CONSERVATION AND KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW
57

Since in the large majority of cases in everyday work situations Kirchhoff’s law
is applied to nodes, it is expressed here with reference to nodes. However, it should
now be clear that it is still valid if we substitute the word “node” with “closed
curve”:
Law: Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)
In any circuit:
Form 1:
The algebraic sum of all of the currents entering any node in a circuit is
zero.
Form 2:
The algebraic sum of all of the currents leaving any node in a circuit is
zero.
Form 3:
The sum of the currents entering any node in a circuit equals the sum of
the currents leaving it.
KCL applies to any circuit; the three forms are still valid and the word “entering”
or “leaving” is replaced with “assumed to enter” or “assumed to leave,”
respectively.
Example 1. Consider the circuit represented in Figure 3.10a.
The KCL equations—for instance, written in all forms 1—are shown in Table 3.1
below.
The assumed directions for currents are totally arbitrary. In Figure 3.10b, which
refers to the same circuit as Figure 3.10a, some of them are different, resulting in the
different systems of equations listed in Table 3.2.
Once solved, these systems will obviously give the same values for iA, iB, iE, iFG,
and opposite values for iC and iD. This means that once any result is evaluated
according to a given direction, it is the same, regardless of the direction assumed for
writing the equations.

Consider now the circuit represented in Figure 3.10c. It is different from the
previous ones, because element D has been eliminated. In this circuit, node N1 is a
unique node which is just shown in expanded form. Indeed the same circuit could be
rewritten as in Figure 3.10d, perfectly equivalent to the one in Figure 3.10c, but with
node N1 unexpanded.
These two ﬁgures show that expanded representation may render the circuit more
readable, for instance allowing reporting all the elements in horizontal or vertical
circuit branches. The KCL equations for the circuits shown in Figures 3.10c and d are
listed in Table 3.3.

The Electric Field Inside Conductors
Consider the very simple circuital system shown in Figure 3.11, containing just a
battery, a conductor, and an electric load in the form of a lamp.
Remember that inside the conductor, as everywhere in space, there is proportion-
ality between current density J and the total electrical ﬁeld Et (see Section 2.7):
Et  ρJ
Et  Eb  Ec
(3.1)
where ρ  1/σ is the resistivity of the material at the point where Et and J are
evaluated.
Equation (3.1) is discussed in Section 2.7.2.
Electric ﬁeld Eb is caused by the input of external power that the battery receives
from chemical potential energy, while Ec is due to charges distributed along the
surfaces of conductor wires; it is therefore conservative and its work along the circuit
is null.
These surface charges might have the appearance of those depicted in Figure 3.11 with
plus () and minus () signs. Much more on surface charges in conductors can be found
in Chapter 8 of [be1].

instance “b” means “battery”, while “b” indicates point b of the system in Figure 3.11.

which shows that the power generated by the battery is dissipated in the circuit
elements (including battery inner resistance) as a result of their resistivity.
The example given, however, also has the very important purpose of showing that
in this circuit an electric ﬁeld Ec is generated all around the loop, because of surface
charges, and therefore has the nature of an electrostatic ﬁeld; it is conservative and
thus has a potential function V.
Between any two points of the circuital system we can deﬁne a potential difference
or voltage U. For instance, between a and b or c and d it is:
Uba  Vb  Va;
Ucd  Vc  Vd
A voltage expressed as potential difference is often called voltage across terminals.
For instance, Uba is the voltage across terminals b and a.
A circuit that most naturally represents the system of Figure 3.11 is the one shown
in Figure 3.12.
The ideal wires are needed to separate the four basic elements, but obviously the
potentials at the ends of ideal wires must be the same (e.g., Va  Va0, etc.). If all the
consecutive branch voltages are summed, we have

CIRCUIT POTENTIALS AND KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW

where the equality of zero is due to the fact that all the potential values appear twice,
with opposite signs.
Equation (3.3) shows that the consecutive voltages across terminals (i.e., potential
differences) in the loop constituted by the circuit have a sum equal to zero. This is very
similar to the well-known law of physics which states that the work performed by a
conservative ﬁeld in any closed loop is zero: the sum of the voltages is indeed the
work, per unit charge, performed by the electric ﬁeld Ec present in the conductor.
Equation (3.3) is interesting, but it would be much more useful if it could be
extended to larger families of circuital systems and to the related circuits.
A question arises immediately: does this result depend on the fact that the electric
source is a battery (i.e., a constant voltage), or is it valid also in the case of time-
varying sources, such as the sinusoidal voltage source considered in Figure 3.1?
Indeed, result (3.3) comes from the physical model of the system in Figure 3.11,
which led us to consider the presence of the electric ﬁeld Ec inside the conductor,
created only by the charges appearing on the surface of the circuit conductors. It was
implicitly assumed that no other ﬁelds were induced by the possible presence of other
electromagnetic phenomena outside the system shown in Figure 3.11—for example,
time-varying magnetic ﬁelds produced by other systems not shown, which, according
to Faraday’s law, would have induced an additional contribution to (that would have
increased or decreased) the conductor’s inner electric ﬁeld.
An analysis of this topic requires knowledge that we will acquire in Chapter 5. The
following is a preview of the result to be found there.
The result (3.3) will be valid also in cases in which the voltage source varies with
time, given that the induction phenomena have negligible effects; that is, the voltage
induced by effect of Faraday’s law in the considered loop is negligible.
Or, in other words, the consecutive voltages across terminals (i.e., potential
differences) in a one-loop circuital system have a sum that is equal to zero whenever
the voltage induced by effect of Faraday’s law in the considered loop is negligible.
Faraday’s law is discussed in Section 2.5.
This is congruent with the initial rule stated above, for creating circuits from
circuital systems; that is, any action in the space around the wires or what happens in
the wires themselves should be negligible—in this case the electric ﬁeld induced by
the presence of a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld around the circuit and in the space
occupied by the circuit loop.
A second very important question that arises from an analysis of the simple circuit
shown in Figure 3.11 is this: can the result (3.3) be extended also to more complex
circuits containing more than a single loop, such as the system in Figure 3.1?
Consider again the system of Figure 3.1, shown again in slightly modiﬁed form in
Figure 3.13. At any given instant the situation inside the conductors can be imagined
as shown in the ﬁgure: the ﬁeld inside generator EG fulﬁls the same role as Eb in the
previous example; and at any given point of the conductors, ﬁeld Ec is present. Note
that the value of Ec varies with the point of the conductor (it is an electric ﬁeld with a
value at any point of space) and both EG and Ec vary with time. As in the previous
62

example, Ec is due to the surface charges present in the conductors, including the
surfaces of the conductive parts fa and fb that interface G with the wires. Ec thus has
the nature of an electrostatic ﬁeld, even though it varies with time, and therefore will
admit a potential v(p), function of the point p of the circuit, variable with time and
therefore represented by a lowercase symbol.
Since v is a function of the point, the potential differences in any closed loop sum to
zero, which is identical to the process that led to equation (3.3). For instance, for the
loops L1, L2, L3 in the system of Figure 3.13, it will be
L1: uba  ucb  udc  uad  vb  va  vc  vb  vd  vc  va  vd  0
L2: ucd  uec  ufe  udf  vc  vd  ve  vc  vf  ve  vd  vf   0
L3: uba  ueb  ufe  uaf  vb  va  ve  vb  vf  ve  va  vf   0
(3.4)
where the equality to zero is due to the fact that all the potential values appear twice,
with opposite signs.
The voltages (or potential differences) can be shown in the circuit corresponding to
the circuital system, as shown for the generator, the lamps, and the lower conductor in
Figure 3.14. Whenever a voltage appears in a circuit, the reference polarities must be
indicated: a plus sign or a pair of plus–minus signs. They indicate the references for
measuring the corresponding voltages: the number indicate that a voltage is equal to
the difference of potentials between the point of the circuit marked “” and the one
marked “”.

For instance, in the next ﬁgure it is uG(t)  vb(t)  va(t). Since the negative sign
must always be at the side opposite to the positive one, it can be omitted, as in the
ﬁgure for the conductor voltages uuc and ulc. A time-varying voltage u(t) will
normally assume, as time passes, positive and negative values; so the part of circuit
marked “” will actually have a higher potential than the one marked “” when u(t)
has a positive value.
Because of its importance, the voltage sign convention is shown in the following
box:
Convention: Voltage sign
The number indicating a circuit voltage u is equal to the difference between the
potential of the circuit wire marked “” and that marked “”.
3.4.2
Formulations of Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
It should now be clear that the results obtained in Figures 3.11 and 3.13 can be
extended to circuital systems and related circuits of varying complexity and with any
number of loops.
These results are summarised by equations (3.3 and (3.4)): in all circuits a function
V of terminals exists, called potential, so that the voltages across terminals are
expressed as the difference of the corresponding potentials.
The very existence of V implies that the sum of consecutive branch voltages around
any loop is equal to zero.
In this section these results are expressed in a more formal and practical way. Prior
to this, however, the concepts of voltage rises and voltage drops must ﬁrst be
introduced. Consider again Figure 3.13. Before writing equations (3.4), possible loops
in the circuit were indicated and reference directions were assumed (indicated by the
arrows on the lines representing the loop). These reference directions are arbitrary. If
the loop is followed, starting from one point and returning to the same point, in the
reference direction, branches are traversed. The negatively marked terminal of a
traversed branch will be encountered either before the positively marked one or after
it. In the former case the branch voltage is considered to be a voltage rise, whereas in
the latter case it is considered to be a voltage drop.
For instance, in loop L3 in Figure 3.14, uG and ulc are voltage rises, while uuc and
uL2 are voltage drops. The third of equations (3.4) could be written using the symbols
in Figure 3.14, as follows:
L3: uG  uuc  uL2  ulc  0
or, equivalently,
L3: uG  ulc  uuc  uL2
64
CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Now we can express the rationale behind loop equations like those in equations (3.4)
in a general and formal way. This constitutes a fundamental law of circuits called
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL). Similarly to KCL, it can be expressed in three
possible forms:
Law: Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)
In any circuit, if any loop is traversed in an arbitrary direction (either clockwise or
counter clockwise):
Form 1:
The algebraic sum of all voltages across terminals, considered as
voltage rises, is zero.
Form 2:
The algebraic sum of all voltages across terminals, considered as
voltage drops, is zero.
Form 3:
The sum of all voltage rises across terminals equals that of all voltage
drops across terminals.
KVL applies to any circuit.
For example, the three forms applied to loop L3 of Figure 3.14 give rise to
(uL1  uL2 indicated as uL12) the following:
Form 1
Form 2
Form 3
L3:
ulc  uG  uuc  uL12
ulc  uG  uuc  uL12  0
ulc  uG  uuc  uL12
In Chapter 5 the circuit concept will be expanded, and the possibility of
magnetically coupled circuits, will be introduced. We will then see that KVL applies
individually to each circuit that is magnetically coupled with others.
3.5
SOLUTION OF A CIRCUIT
Solving a circuit normally means ﬁnding a value for all node potentials and wire
currents. For branch-based circuits, this simply means calculating the values of all
branch voltages and currents.
Some of these equations will be KCL and KVL equations; others will give the
description of the branches’ inner behaviour and will be referred to as “constitutive
equations.”
This section will provide information on how to write linearly independent
Kirchhoff equations and constitutive equations; in addition, we will examine
whether or not the resulting equations are sufﬁcient to determine all currents
and voltages.

3.5.1
Determining Linearly Independent Kirchhoff Equations
(Loop-Cuts Method)
Let us consider a branch-based circuit with b branches and n nodes. To ﬁx ideas,
consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.15, where names for nodes, reference direction
of currents, and some possible loops have already been arbitrarily proposed. Note that
the displayed loops do not cover all possibilities (for instance, there could also be a
loop sequentially traversing B, C, F, G, and D).
Consider the KCL for all the circuit nodes (written using form 1):
N1: iA  iB  iD  0
N2: iA  iB  iC  0
N3: iC  iE  iFG  0
N4: iD  iE  iFG  0
(3.5)
It can be immediately veriﬁed that these equations are not linearly independent, since
N4  N1  N2  N3
It is also easy to verify [using the usual algebraic techniques to solve linear
systems, e.g. computing the determinant of subsystems of the system (3.5)] that only
three of the equations in (3.5) are linearly independent.
The four KVL equations relating to the loops shown in Figure 3.15 can also be
written, again using form 1, as follows:
L1: uA  uB  0
L2: uB  uC  uE  uD  0
L3: uE  uF  uG  0
L4: uC  uF  uG  uD  uA  0
(3.6)
Again, it is easy to see that these equations are not linearly independent, since
L4  L1  L2  L3
andit can be easily veriﬁed that only four of the equations (3.6) are linearlyindependent.

CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Let us now introduce a technique that allows us to write only linearly independent
Kirchhoff equations.
The simple case of a circuit without nodes obviously requires no KCL equations
and a single KVL equation. In the other cases the following simple procedure, which
in this book will be called the loop-cuts method, can be used:
• The KCL is applied to any set of nodes amounting to the total number of nodes
n diminished by one.
• The KVL can be determined in the following recursive manner:
a. Write an equation for an arbitrary circuit loop; a cross can then be applied (or
imagined to be applied) to a branch of that circuit. Application of a cross can be
imaginedtocreatetheeffectof“cutting”thebranch,hencethenameofthemethod.
b. If one or more loops are still present in the circuit, return to step a, but loops
must not contain branches already crossed.
c. In the case of branches in parallel, if a single voltage name is used across the
branches, a cross must be applied to all branches in parallel but one, before
starting to write the KVL equations.
It is apparent that the procedure proposed allows determination of linearly independent
equations. If for instance the KVL is considered, crossing a branch ensures that the
equation later chosen does not contain the voltage across that branch and is therefore
linearly independent of the previous one. Since this reasoning can be repeated recur-
sively, we can conclude that the set obtained is constituted by linearly independent
equations. It can also be demonstrated that the number of equations that can be obtained
this way is equal to b  n  1.
Rule: Determination of independent Kirchhoff equations (loop-cuts method)
(1) Independent KCL equations can be obtained by applying the law to all the
circuit nodes except one (arbitrarily chosen).
(2) Independent KVL equations can be obtained by crossing (“cutting”), in a loop
equation, an arbitrary branch of the loop and choosing the next loop equation
in such a way that no crossed branch is traversed.
Example 2. Figure 3.16 shows two possible ways to determine linearly independent
KVL sets. After L1 is determined, crossing C1 excludes branch A from subsequent
loops; and after L2 is determined, crossing C2 excludes branches B1, C, and D from the
subsequent ﬁnal loop L3, which excludes previously crossed or unconnected branches.
The corresponding sets of linearly independent equations are
Set 1:
L1: uA  uB  0
L2: uB  uC  uE  uD  0
L3: uE  uF  0

The fact that the two sets are equivalent is conﬁrmed by the fact that set 2 can be
obtained from set 1 by substituting L2 with L1  L2.
3.5.2
Constitutive Equations
Clearly, Kirchhoff’s equations themselves are not sufﬁcient to determine the full
behaviour of a circuit (i.e., all the currents and voltages), since information is also
necessary on how the circuit elements (i.e., for branch-based circuits, the circuit
branches) operate internally.
We may say that Kirchhoff’s laws only deﬁne the topology of the circuit; no
information is given about the inner behaviour of the circuit branches. This behaviour
is introduced by means of equations, called constitutive equations; they will often be
referred to by their acronym CE.
Constitutive equations of matter have already been introduced in Chapter 2. Here,
instead, we deﬁne constitutive equations of lumped circuit components.
The same expression in these two cases indicates different but similar concepts. Indeed,
when dealing with the three-dimensional space, at any point of space the existing matter
imposes relations between local ﬁelds existing in that point: the constitutive equations
discussed in Chapter 2. For instance B  μH indicates a precise relation between
magnetic and ﬂux density ﬁelds at the considered point.
When dealing with circuits, the “atomic” element to consider is a single branch, and its
constitutive equation characterises how that branch contributes to the deﬁnition of circuit
variables (i.e., voltage and current). This way a circuit constitutive equation is a relation
(algebraic or differential) between branch voltage and current.
Constitutive equations for the most important components will be introduced and
discussed in the next two chapters. Here, we will limit ourselves to stating that a
constitutive equation is a relation between the branch current and voltage.6 Examples
of constitutive equations are shown in Table 3.4.

6Note that for any circuit, it is assumed that the effects on the behaviour of any branch of the potentials at its
terminals p1 and p2 are only through the potential difference u  vp1  vp2. This is coherent with the
assumption, valid for any potential, that single potential values cannot have any effect: only potential
differences can have measurable effects.

CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Readers might recognise the equations of typical circuit components already
encountered in their previous studies; as regards constitutive equations with a current
and voltage, the coefﬁcients are positive (i.e., R, L, C); branch voltage and current
must be associated in such a way that the assumed direction of current enters the
branch in the positively marked terminal. This combination of reference signs will be
later referred to as the load sign convention:
Convention: Load and generator sign convention
References for current and voltage in a branch follow the load sign convention
when the assumed current direction enters the branch from the positively marked
terminal.
If the current exits the branch from the positively marked terminal, the references
follow the generator sign convention.
Not all constitutive equations are possible in all positions in a circuit.

It is impractical to deal with this issue in a general way. As signiﬁcant examples,
however, consider that:
• Since two branches in a series share the same current, they cannot be
characterised by current source constitutive equations since even a slight
difference between the two currents would contradict the topological constraint
imposing perfect equivalence of the two currents.
• Since two branches in parallel share the same voltage, they cannot be char-
acterised by voltage source constitutive equations since even a slight difference
between the two voltages would contradict the topological constraint imposing
the perfect equivalence of the two voltages.
A quantity which is constant over time is indicated using uppercase symbols. For
instance, a constant voltage source can be indicated as equal to Us. Conversely,
lowercase symbols indicate variable quantities, such as u(t), or simply u.
The list of constitutive equations in Table 3.4 does not include branches whose
current or voltage is a function of the current or voltage in another branch.
Different kinds exist, including, for instance, current-controlled voltage sources
or voltage-controlled current sources, which have theoretical and practical
signiﬁcance.
However, their usage is beyond the scope of this book, with one important
exception: the ideal transformer component. To study this component, we need to
expand the deﬁnition of circuit given in this chapter, which is the reason why it is not
included in Table 3.4. This component, along with these new, expanded circuits (i.e.,
the magnetically coupled circuits) will be discussed in Chapter 5.
3.5.3
Number of Variables and Equations
We have seen that solving a circuit entails ﬁnding a value for all node potentials and
wire currents; for branch-based circuits, this simply means ﬁnding the values of all
branch voltages and currents.
A branch-based circuit containing b branches has, in general, b voltages and b
currents as independent variables, for a total of 2b variables. Solving this kind of
circuit, therefore, requires ﬁnding a set of 2b independent equations that make
mathematical connections between all the branch voltages and currents.
It could be demonstrated that ﬁnding the solution to a circuit is well-posed since we
can write both b Kirchhoff equations and b constitutive equations. However, such a
large number of equations is typically written only by algorithms for a computerised
solution of the circuits; for a manual solution, this number is typically dramatically
reduced by visual analysis of the circuit.
Take, for instance, the circuit shown in Figure 3.17a. It contains 5 branches, and
therefore in general we can write a system of 10 equations in 10 unknowns.
If the circuit has to be manually solved, however, it can be immediately understood
that branches A, B, and C share the same voltage, for which a unique variable can be
used, and that branches D and E share the same current, for which a unique variable
70
CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

can be used, leading to the circuit shown in Figure 3.17b, in which there are now 7
instead of 10 variables (currents and voltages).
Obviously, this reduction in system variables implies a corresponding reduction in
Kirchhoff equations, so that the number of equations and variables will be balanced:
in this case 7  7.
The circuit can be simpliﬁed further, as will be seen in more practical cases in the
next two chapters. In a case like the system of Figure 3.17, the system could be
reduced to four equations in four variables.
Figure 3.17a also gives us the opportunity to view a particular visual representation
of nodes: what is inside of curves N1 and N2 is something that connects three or more
circuit elements; therefore they are actually nodes. The black circles they contain
might be considered nodes as well. However, black circles are connected to each other
by wires; it is common and convenient to consider them aggregate into “expanded”
nodes such as N1 and N2.
Example 3. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.18a. For some of the currents, the
numerical values are already known, while the others, namely i1, i2, and i3, are
unknowns. The circuit contains four nodes, which lead to 4  1  3 independent KCL
equations, for example,
N1 (form 1): i3  2  3  0 (implying i3  5 A)
N3 (form 1): i1  1  1  0 (implying i1  2 A)

It can thus be veriﬁed that the n  1 equations (n  4 being the number of circuit
nodes) are linearly independent, allowing us to determine the three unknown currents;
moreover, the assumed directions for the currents are useful for writing the equations,
but in no way indicate the actual currents. In the example of Figure 3.18, the actual
ﬂow directions are all opposite the assumed ones.
In Figure 3.18b, the four voltages uB, uF, uH, and uI are unknowns. Using a
somewhat wise choice of loop equations, four linearly independent ones can be
determined, for example:
L2 (form 1): uB  2  5  0 (implies uB  3 V; cut C2 is made)
L1 (form 1): uH  1  uB  0 (implies uH  1  uB  2 V; cut C1 is made)
L3 (form 2): uF  3  5  0 (implies uF  8 V; cut C3 is made)
L4 (form 3): uI  4  uF (implies uI  uF  4  4 V)
More in Depth: Number of Kirchhoff equations
It could be demonstrated that for any circuit, the number of Kirchhoff equations is
equal to the number of branches, computing only once the branches sharing the
same current.
In the example of Figure 3.18, A–H, and G–I share the same current (they are
called branches in series); therefore the total number of independent equations
should be equal to the total number of branches, reduced by two, that is, seven.
In fact, we wrote three KCL and four KVL equations.

In this example, some currents and voltages are known, and others, seven in
number, remain unknown. In more frequent cases, instead of currents or voltages,
some constitutive equations would be known. In these cases, unique constitutive
equations must be written for the branches in series, such as A–H and G–I for the
example of Figure 3.18.
The circuit can then be solved whenever nc constitutive equations, nu branch
voltages and ni branch currents are known, and it is

number of branches with unknown current
(N is 7 in the example of Figure 3.18)
Constitutive equations of branches in series are easily determined by summing the
partial constitutive equations expressed in terms of voltages as a function of
currents. If, in the example of Figure 3.18 for instance, A, H, G, and I were all
resistors, the four equations would be
UA  RAIA;
UB  RBIB;
UG  RGIIGI;
UI  RIII
which allows us to determine the following constitutive equations of the equiv-
alent branches:
UAB  RA  RBIAB;
UGH  RG  RHIGH
3.6
THE SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
Consider a branch-based circuit.
Without loss of generality, we can study the one in Figure 3.17, shown again,
slightly simpliﬁed, in Figure 3.19.
Any given closed curve such as curve C in the ﬁgure, which selects a part of the
circuit connected to the remaining part by only two wires, has the structure of a
2-terminal element—that is, a branch.
Is it possible to consider this an actual branch, so that a single box Eq can be
substituted for the whole circuit section inside C, without changing the solution of the
remaining part of the circuit?
Consider the full solution of the left part of the circuit. It allows us to determine, in
particular, voltage u and current i.
It is apparent that KCL equations can be written for the part of the circuit outside C,
as well as for the part inside it using the value of i instead of the missing part. For
instance, the equation for node N will, in both cases, be iA  iB  i  0.
It is also apparent that KVL equations can be written for the part of the circuit
outside C, as well as for the part inside it using the value of u instead of the missing
THE SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
73

part. For instance, the KVL equation for the loop involving B, C, and u will in both
cases be uB  uC  u  0.
It should be clear that this conclusion is valid in general for any circuit. The result is
therefore as follows:
Result: Substitution principle of circuits I
A circuit portion with two terminals can always be substituted by an equivalent
branch—that is, a branch whose constitutive equation has the same relation
between its voltage and current as in the subcircuit it substitutes.
The substitution principle is often used with voltage source branches. Consider,
for instance, the circuit shown in Figure 3.20, which is a slightly modiﬁed version of

the one in Figure 3.19 and in which the constitutive equation for branch E is
uE  us  const (it does not depend on the current ﬂowing through E). Since our
knowledge of the voltage across E (i.e., us) is sufﬁcient to write all Kirchhoff
equations for the left part, this part can be solved without knowing what is in the
circuit to the right of us. Therefore, the bottom-left circuit can be used. Similarly, the
right part of the circuit can be solved without knowing what is in the circuit to the left
of us. Therefore, the bottom-right circuit can be used.
This way of using the substitution principle is possible even when the component is
not a voltage source component but the voltage between two terminals is known. This
voltage value will enter the equations as a known value, and the system of equations
will be identical to those which are valid when there is a voltage source between the
terminals.
Finally, this result is valid also when the current in a branch instead of the voltage
across two terminals is known in advance. These considerations lead to the following
second formulation of the substitution principle.
Result: Substitution principle of circuits II
If a current in a branch is known in advance, the circuit can be solved by
substituting the branch with a source component.
If a voltage between two terminals of a branch is known in advance, the circuit can
be solved by substituting the branch with a voltage source component.
This substitution will often enable large circuits to be solved in sequence. Compare
Figure 3.20.

How do Kirchhoff’s equations compare to electromagnetism? This is a question
that very few people are able to answer immediately. But to the reader of this book the
answer should be straightforward, since they will now know that:
Kirchhoff’s laws apply to circuits—that is, to mathematical models of physical
systems—while the electromagnetism laws (and therefore Maxwell’s equations)
apply to actual physical systems.
Therefore, from this perspective, Kirchhoff’s laws can be applied to circuits, while
their applicability to physical systems is undeﬁned.
In other words, whether or not Kirchhoff’s equations are valid for a given circuit or
a circuital system is not well-posed: the actual problem is whether and when a given
system can be modelled using a given circuit.
It was seen in this chapter that in the so-called DC circuits, where all quantities are
constant over time, circuits can be used as models of physical systems whenever the
space between wires is perfectly insulating, and this is very often the case.
On the other hand, in the so-called AC circuits, where all quantities vary with time,
circuits can be used as models of physical systems, whenever conductive and
displacement currents between wires have negligible effects, and voltages induced
in the circuit loops, by effect of mutual induction or self-induction, are also negligible.
It will be seen in Chapter 5 that this is not a big limitation and it allows circuits to
correctly model a large quantity of systems, but not all. For instance, in long
transmission lines, in which conductors remain parallel to each other for kilometres,
self-inductance is not negligible. This special case can still be solved if we extend the
circuit concept, as will be discussed in Section 5.3.2 and the Appendix.
3.8
POWER IN CIRCUITS
We have mentioned several times that physical systems modelled through circuits
have to be independent from other systems, in the sense that no mutual induction with
external systems must occur.
In this case, any physical system modelled through a circuit will be energetically
autonomous, in the sense that the energy generated by some parts of the given systems
will be absorbed by others.
Consider again the basic example proposed throughout this chapter, i.e. the system
shown in Figure 3.1. It is apparent that the generator will introduce power into the
system from an external source(e.g.,a rotating shaft), and that power will be equal to the
power which is dissipated in wires and lamps, i.e. converted into heat and luminous
energy. This power neutrality is a very important characteristic of systems, and will be
retained in any well-made model. It will soon be demonstrated that this power neutrality
exists in all circuits; that is, the energy conservation principle applies.
Let us ﬁrst consider how to mathematically evaluate the power ﬂowing in a section
of a circuital system.
76
CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Consider the system of Figure 3.1, again presented in Figure 3.13, and reproduced,
with some modiﬁcations, in Figure 3.21. The work per unit of charge W that the
electric ﬁeld inside the conductor performs on the conductor charges, is the integral of
Ec ? dl by an arbitrary path connecting A to B. Note that if only Ec is to be accounted
for in the following equation, the path should be chosen in the right part of the
circuit—for example, B–c–d–A or B–e–f–A.
P  dW
dt  ∫
B
A
Ec  dl  vB  vA  uBA
where v is the potential of electric ﬁeld Ec.
The work per unit of time P—that is, the power that traverses the circuit and goes
from the left part of points AB to the right of them—is therefore
P  dW
dt
dq
dt  uBA  i
(3.7)
Equation (3.7) states that the power ﬂowing through two wires in a circuital system is
equal to the product voltage times current. Attention must be paid to the signs, since the
voltage uBA  vB  vA is the opposite of uAB: the power measured by p  ui is toward the
right part of the circuit, when i represents a current that enters the right part of the circuit
through the positively marked terminal that gives the reference polarity for u.
When a circuit models a circuital system, it shares the point of interconnection of
elements, voltages, and currents with the system to be modelled.
Circuits are power-neutral; that is, the power delivered by branches perfectly equals
the power absorbed by the others; the energy conservation principle thus applies:
Law: Energy conservation in circuits
In any circuit, at any time interval, the sum of energy absorbed by all branches is
zero. This is equivalent to saying that, at any time, the power delivered by the
branches acting as generators equals the power absorbed by those acting as loads.
The demonstration of this law is in the next section.

Example 4. As an example consider again the circuit used in Figure 3.18, shown
again in Figure 3.22, containing the assumed current signs and voltage polarities used
in the same ﬁgure, and the corresponding numerical values of voltages and currents as
already computed in Section 3.4.3. For each branch, the product ui will be a power
produced or absorbed by the branch, depending on the combination of references in
the circuit: they are absorbed if the assumed sign for current enters the positively
marked terminal.
Voltages, currents (measured as entering into the positively marked terminals) and
absorbed powers are shown in Table 3.5, which shows that power conservation
applies to the circuit: the algebraic sum of the powers absorbed by all branches is
equal to zero.

CIRCUITS AS MODELLING TOOLS

Without loss of generality let the circuit have only a single branch (possibly
equivalent of several branches7) between each pair of nodes.
Consider the current between node i and j as having the assumed direction
indicated in the ﬁgure—that is, from i to j. Tellegen’s theorem states the following:
If
• {v0, v1, . . . vn} is a set of node voltages satisfying KVL for the circuit in
question
• {i01, i02, . . . i0n, . . . i12, i13, . . . i1n, . . . i1n1,n, i1n} is a set of currents
potentially ﬂowing in the circuit branches (from the ﬁrst node to the second
one) satisfying KCL for the circuit in question

There is a special application of Tellegen’s theorem, which occurs when uij and iij
are not only compatible with Kirchhoff’s laws, but are also present simultaneously in
a circuit. In this case, in accordance with what was stated in Section 3.6, the quantity
pij  uijiij  vi  vjiij
(3.9)
is the power absorbed by the branch existing between nodes i and j.
Therefore equation (3.8) can be written as

(3.10)
Equation (3.10), which is an immediate consequence of Tellegen’s theorem, states
exactly what was anticipated—that is, that the sum of all branch powers, assumed to
be absorbed, is identically null. This means that the power delivered by branches that
deliver power is exactly equal, at any time, to the powers absorbed at that time by
branches that absorb power.

HISTORICAL NOTES
3.9.1
Short Biography of Kirchhoff
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff8 (1824–1887) was a German physicist and inventor of the
two laws that carry his name. He was teacher of physics and later of mathematical
physics at the University of Berlin and Breslau.
He worked mainly in the ﬁelds of spectroscopy, electric circuit theory, and
thermodynamics. In 1860, together with Bunsen, he found the luminous spectra
signature of chemical elements. He founded spectroscopy analysis and made it
possible to discover new chemical elements.
In circuit analysis he developed the two circuit laws that carry his name—
Kirchhoff’s Current Law and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law—while updating the results
previously obtained by Ohm (whose short biography is in Chapter 4) and elimina-
ting their points of contrast with the already generally accepted theory of
electromagnetism.
In thermodynamics he studied radiation emitted by the so-called black body.

the gyrator. In circuit theory he produced a very important theorem which carries his
name.
He obtained his master’s degree in electrical engineering in 1923 and then joined
the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven. In the period 1946–1966, Tellegen
was professor of circuit theory at the University of Delft.
He invented the penthode vacuum tube (adding a ﬁfth electrode to the tetrode) in
1926 and invented the gyrator around 1948. Since its discovery, Tellegen’s theorem
has attracted increasing interest and is now one of the main pillars of circuit theory.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING
DC CIRCUITS
For the Instructor
This chapter differs in approach from similar books in that, for a time, it keeps the
distinction between Kirchhoff’s laws and constitutive equations, as clearly stated
in Chapter 3. This is a reminder to students that Kirchhoff’s equations are valid not
just for DC, but for all circuits.
However, soon we will see how the constitutive equations typical of DC circuits
are integrated and combined within Kirchhoff’s.
Because of the book’s expected use and readership, we have made a selection
of the most effective solving techniques available. Basic usage of combined
Kirchhoff-constitutive equations and nodal analysis have been selected here—the
ﬁrst because it naturally completes the knowledge we acquired in chapter three, the
second because it allows a dramatic reduction in the number of equations that need
to be simultaneously solved.
The mesh current method, which is also very important for experts in circuit
analysis, is outlined here.

INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapter, circuits were introduced as a graphical-mathematical tool,
useful for analysing physical systems composed of electric elements connected to
each other by means of wires. It was also shown that, under given assumptions,
circuits can effectively model physical systems that work with either constant or
variable quantities.
In this chapter, we develop our analysis of circuits while working exclusively with
constant quantities (voltages, currents, powers, etc.), so as to enable the reader to solve
these kinds of circuit.
Circuits that operate with constant quantities are by tradition called direct current
circuits or DC circuits.
Examples of DC systems, which can be modelled well by DC circuits, are:
• toys, which are fed by batteries (the most common DC energy source);
• the electrical systems of cars which, when the engine is stopped, are fed by a
battery and, when the engine is operating, by a DC generator, consisting of an
electromechanical system that draws mechanical power from the engine and
converts it into electricity in the DC form.
4.2
MODELLING CIRCUITAL SYSTEMS WITH CONSTANT
QUANTITIES AS CIRCUITS
In the previous chapter, in which we explored circuital systems and circuits, we
introduced KCL and KVL, referring to examples in which all quantities in the
system were constant: currents, voltages, ﬁelds, and so on. These systems are
traditionally called direct current systems or DC systems, even though the name is
not strictly correct; rather than “direct” the term “constant” would be more
appropriate.
Since KCL and KVL were analysed using DC systems, it is quite natural to apply
the circuit concept to circuital systems operating with constant quantities.
However, it must always be remembered that circuits are models of physical
systems, and modelling always implies making assumptions, which in the systems
themselves are satisﬁed only up to a degree.
This is discussed in the next section.
4.2.1
The Basic Rule
To evaluate the assumptions to make so as to model a circuit system as a circuit,
consider again the example discussed in the previous chapter, and in particular
the version with constant quantities (voltages, currents, etc., constant over time) in
Figure 3.13 and also in Figure 4.1a.
84
TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING DC CIRCUITS

Since in the conductor there is electric ﬁeld Ec, caused by the surface charges on
the conductors, KVL is satisﬁed, as already seen in Chapter 3. Moreover, if the charge
ﬂows through wires, or wires and elements are negligible, KCL also applies.
Note that this is equivalent to saying that the air surrounding the wires has inﬁnite
resistivity, or zero conductivity.
Three different models for the same physical system are shown in Figures 4.1b
to 4.1d. The model in Figure 4.1b clearly shows the terminals a, b, c, d, e, f, as well as
the subsystems for which these terminals form borders with other circuit elements. Note
that two of the elements have three terminals. The reader might remember that circuits
can have multiterminal elements, although circuits with only two terminal elements,
called branch-based circuits in this book, are by far the most widely used ones.
The model in Figure 4.1c is equivalent to the one in Figure 4.1b, but the two points
N1 and N2 of the physical system to be modelled, representing the two nodes N1 and
N2 in Figure 4.1a, turn it into a branch-based circuit. Finally, the model in Figure 4.1d

is a simpliﬁed version of the one in Figure 4.1c and is therefore less accurate but easier
to deal with.
KCL is assumed to be wholly valid in circuits. Therefore, in the transformation of
the system in Figure 4.1a into the circuits of Figures 4.1b to 4.1d, any charge ﬂow in
the air surrounding the wires and through the element boundaries is negligible.
For DC circuits, the rule for modelling a given system as a circuit is thus very
simple:
Rule: Modelling of DC systems through circuits
A circuital system, composed of components that can be modelled as circuit
elements connected to each other by conducting wires if all quantities are constant,
is a DC system.
It can be modelled by a DC circuit if all charge ﬂow in the air between the wires
and around the elements is negligible.
It was earlier stated that in DC circuits all the quantities are constant. Why are they
constant? This simply depends on the constitutive equations.
Consider a circuit whose branches have constitutive equations only of the types
shown in Table 4.1, a subsystem of those already shown in Table 2.4. In such a circuit,
some of the branches impose constant voltages at their terminals, others constant
currents (voltage and current sources respectively), while others impose proportion-
ality between current and voltage (resistors).
In this case it can be intuited that all voltages and currents of the circuit will be
constant and can be formally demonstrated.
More in Depth: Equation-only formulation of DC circuit models
In this chapter the reader will learn that voltages and currents can be determined as
the solution of a linear system of equations of the type

where
x is the vector of unknowns (voltages across all branches that are not of the
voltage source type and currents through all the branches that are not of the
constant current type)
b is the vector of known terms (voltages across all voltage source branches and
currents through constant current branches)
A is a matrix of coefﬁcients that will contain constant terms, a function of the
resistances of the resistors
Since A and b are both constant, solution x will constitute a vector of constants
Therefore, circuits containing elements having only the constitutive equations
shown in Table 4.1 will be DC circuits.
In the following sections, the three basic types of constitutive equations shown in
Table 4.1 will be discussed in more detail.
4.2.2
Resistors: Ohm’s Law
Consider the load in Figure 4.2. Suppose that if the applied voltage U changes, the
current ﬂowing into the load changes in proportion; that is, whenever the voltage
doubles, the current doubles; or more generally, when the voltage is multiplied by a
given factor, the current varies by the same factor.
This implies direct proportionality between voltage and current:
U  kI
(4.1)
This example is far from rare in nature; indeed this law is valid to a high degree of
accuracy for any load composed of conducting material of any shape, such as wire
distributing energy along an electric installation (long cylinder of copper) or a spiral
(such as in domestic heaters, ovens, and bulb lamps).
The ﬁrst one that formulated a law that resembles (4.1) was Georg Simon Ohm in
1827 (cf. Section 4.7.1); this equation thus is known today as Ohm’s law. The factor

of proportionality is a quality of the conductor: the higher this factor, the lower the
current at a given voltage, or the higher the voltage needed for a given current ﬂow.
This factor thus measures the ability of a conductor to resist charge transfer. It is
therefore called the “resistance” of the load and is consequently normally given the
symbol R. Ohm’s law is usually written as
U  RI
(4.2)
which not only relates the amplitudes of voltage and current of a given conductor, but
also relates the signs. U and I can therefore be positive or negative numbers; however,
if the load sign convention is used for the branch to which Ohm’s law applies,
resistance R is always a positive number (see Figure 4.2).
Resistance R has the dimensions of a voltage times a current; because of its
importance, this quantity has its own name in the SI, that is, “ohm” (note the
lowercase initial as for all units of SI measures). One ohm is the resistance of a resistor
in which, when subjected to a voltage of one volt, a current of one ampere ﬂows.
Definition: The ohm (the unit of measure of resistance)
The unit of measure of resistance is the ohm (symbol: Ω).
One ohm is the resistance of a conductor which, under a voltage of 1 V, absorbs a
current of 1 A. In formula: 1 Ω  (1 V)/(1 A)
A conductor shows a resistance that is a function of the characteristics of the
material used, and of the conductor’s geometry. For the most important case of a
cylindrical conductor having the length l and the cross-sectional area A, the following
relation applies:
R  ρ l
A  l
σA
where ρ and σ  1/ρ constitute a characteristic of the material with which the
conductor is made, and they are called resistivity or conductivity of the material,
respectively.
Resistivity (and therefore also conductivity) is rather dependent on temperature. Its
dependence is normally considered linear around the value at a reference temperature,
according to the law
ρ  ρ01  αθ  θ0
where θ0 is the reference temperature and α is a coefﬁcient characteristic of the
material used, deﬁned as
α  Δρ

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING DC CIRCUITS

The numerical values of the best conductors are shown in Table 4.2; among them,
widely used in electrical engineering applications, are aluminium and copper.
Ohm’s law can be written in a slightly different form from (4.2):
I  1
R U  GU
(4.3)
where G, by deﬁnition, is equal to the reciprocal of R, is called conductance of the
element with R as resistance, and has a unit of measure of its own, called siemens,
whose symbol is S:
Definition: The siemens (the unit of measure of conductance)
The unit of measure of resistance is the siemens (symbol: S).
One siemens is the conductance of a conductor which, under a voltage of 1 V,
absorbs a current of 1 A. In formula: 1 S  (1 A)/(1 V)

and power). A battery shows nonzero voltage (see Figure 4.3), as measured by the
voltmeter Vm, even when it is unconnected to any load. When it is connected to
the load, it starts delivering current, as measured by the ammeter Am displayed in the
ﬁgure; the higher the current delivered, the lower the voltage.
The voltage–current relationship of a battery is very complex and depends on
several parameters such as the battery type, the environment temperature, how
charged the battery is, and so on. However, it is often sufﬁcient to resort to simpliﬁed
modelling. The simplest way of modelling this complex behaviour is by resorting to a
linear constitutive equation of the type
U  Us  RiI
(4.4)
It is interesting to note that this simple constitutive equation allows it to be
“translated” into two very basic circuital elements: an ideal, constant voltage source
element, in series with an ideal resistor with resistance Ri. Indeed, it is very easy to see
that equation (4.4) can immediately be found by applying the KVL to the rightmost
upper circuit of Figure 4.3.
Another equivalent circuital interpretation of equation (4.4) is in the lower
rightmost circuit of Figure 4.3:
U  Ri ? IRi  RiUs=Ri  I
where I(Ri) indicates the current ﬂowing through Ri.
The characteristics of a real or ideal generator can also be seen in a U–I plane, as
shown in Figure 4.4. Consider the leftmost diagram. It is simply a graphical
representation of equation (4.4), taking into account the fact that Ri must be a real
positive quantity. However, in the case of real batteries, good practice requires not
to load the battery with too high currents; therefore, the operating point P is near the
no-load voltage point P0 (for which U  Us). The useful part of the left plot of
Figure 4.4 will thus correspond to the one shown in the central diagram of this
ﬁgure. For this part, it is more intuitive to use the generator shown in the top-right
part of Figure 4.3, since it highlights the ideal generator Us, plus the deviation from

ideal behaviour induced by Ri, which causes the actual voltage to be lower than the
ideal one.
If the terminals of a real voltage source (i.e., composed of the ideal generator Us plus the
inner resistance Ri) are directly connected to each other, the voltage between them
becomes zero and the current ﬂowing is Us/Ri. This current will usually be very high and
must be interrupted quickly to avoid source damage and/or the excessive generation of
heat in the conductors, with the risk of ﬁre. These very high currents are normally called
short-circuit currents; possible interrupting devices are called breaker and fuses. Some
information about them will be supplied in Part IV of this book.
There are some rare cases, however, in which feeders are used in the vicinity of
point Psc—that is, when voltage is near zero (subscript stands for “short circuit”).
In these cases, the useful part of the leftmost diagram of Figure 4.3 is the one
shown in the rightmost diagram of Figure 4.4. For this part, it is more intuitive to
use the generator shown in the bottom-right part of Figure 4.3, since it shows the
ideal current generator Us/Ri, plus the deviation from ideal behaviour induced by
Ri, which causes the actual current to be lower than the ideal one.
Where the element Ri is omitted from the circuital representations, the actual
characteristics of the circuital equivalents shown in Figure 4.3 would be the line of
dashes in the middle and right-hand diagrams of Figure 4.4.

SOLVING TECHNIQUES
In Chapter 3 we stated that solving a circuit means ﬁnding a value for all node
potentials and wire currents. For branch-based circuits, this simply means ﬁnding the
values of all branch voltages and currents.
We also stated that we need to write Kirchhoff and constitutive equations, in
exactly the number needed to solve the circuit.
However, by restricting the possible constitutive equations for DC circuits to the
very limited number shown in Table 4.1, it is possible to greatly simplify this general
approach, which allows relatively easy manual computation of circuits.
While computer programmes solve circuits simply by just assembling Kirchhoff and
constitutive equations in a mechanical way, electrical engineers (and nonelectrical
engineers with some basic knowledge of electrical engineering) use specialised solving

techniques for DC circuits. The easiest and more common of these are discussed in the
following sections. In particular:
• Basic usage of combined Kirchhoff-constitutive equations allows us to limit the
system rank to be solved to the number of Kirchhoff equations themselves, since
constitutive equations are directly substituted into Kirchhoff’s.
• Nodal analysis allows a further reduction of equations, resulting in a system
whose rank is equal to the number of circuit nodes minus one.
• Mesh analysis is another method that allows the number of equations to be
reduced to the number of KVL equations.
Because of the introductory nature of this book, mesh analysis is merely mentioned
as a possible technique and is not dealt with in detail.
4.3.1
Basic Usage of Combined Kirchhoff-Constitutive Equations
Consider as an example the system shown in Figure 4.5. In this circuit, specialised
symbols of the types considered in Table 4.1 (i.e., constant voltage, constant current,
and resistors) are used instead of generic branches.
These symbols are commonly used in textbooks. Other symbols are often used, but
the ones adopted in this book are those recommended by international standardization
bodies (see Chapter 1 for details). Note that the resistor symbol is similar to the
generic branch symbol, but it has an aspect ratio of 3:1 instead of 2:1.
The circuit shows all voltage polarities and current ﬂow references ( assumed
directions). The reference current directions here always enter positively marked
terminals; it goes without saying that any choice of voltage polarities and current
references would be acceptable.
A full set of Kirchhoff’s equations and constitutive equations (c.e.) would be as
follows:
N1: IC  I1  IE  0
N2: IE  ID  I1  0
N3:  IA  IC  IB  0
L1: U0  UA  UB  0
L2: UB  UC  UE  UD  0
c:e:: U0  US; UA  RAIA; UB  RBIB; UC  RCIC; UD  RDID; UE  REIE; I1  Is
There are 12 equations in 12 unknowns,1 which in this form appears lengthy to
solve. This system, however, can be simpliﬁed immediately by substituting the
1In principle the unknowns are all branch voltages and currents—that is, there would be 14 since there are 7
branches; however, the system was written on the basis that Us is traversed by the same current as RA and
that U1 shares its current with RF.

constitutive equations into Kirchhoff’s, resulting in the following much leaner
system:
N1:

N2:

N3:

L1:
Us  RAIA  RBIE  0
L2:
RBIB  RCIC  REIE  RDID  0
(4.5)
It is apparent from this example that, instead of ﬁrst writing the full set of Kirchhoff
and constitutive equations and then doing the substitution, it is much faster to directly
write KVL equations in order that voltages are already expressed, whenever resistors
are involved, as a function of the corresponding currents:
Rule: Combined Kirchhoff-Constitutive Equations (KCE)
When dealing with DC circuits, combined Kirchhoff-constitutive equations are
written.
These are Kirchhoff’s equations, in which resistor voltages are expressed as
products of currents and resistances (with appropriate signs).
This way, the rank of the system to solve is just the number of Kirchhoff’s
equations.
The reader may have noticed that in the writing of Kirchhoff’s equations for the
system of Figure 4.5, the loop-cuts rule introduced in Chapter 3 would have caused an
additional loop equation to be written
L3:
REIE  RFI1  U1  0
(4.6)
This equation, however, once added to the system (4.5), will raise its rank by one,
due to this additional equation and the new variable U1, which does not appear

anywhere else in the system. It is, therefore, wise to leave this equation out of the
system (4.5), which should be then solved. If U1 is needed, it can be found
immediately from eq. (4.6).
This is a general situation whenever current sources are present in the circuit.
Therefore, in DC circuits, the loop-cuts rule is applied without considering loops
branches containing current sources, in order to reduce the system rank:
Rule: Kirchhoff-constitutive equations when current sources are present
When determining combined Kirchhoff-constitutive equations (KCEs) using the
loop-cuts method described in Chapter 3, any branch with a current source can be
considered already cut.
If the voltage of the current source is needed, the loop in which it is contained can
be evaluated after the main system is solved.
The system (4.5) is a linear one with ﬁve unknowns IA, IB, IC, ID, IE. Once it is
solved and all of these have become known, all the branch voltages are easily
determined through very simple application of constitutive equations.
This system, as for any circuit in general, can also be represented in the standard
form of linear systems:
Ax  b
(4.7)
in which
x is the vector of unknowns
b is the vector of known terms
A is the matrix of coefﬁcients
When circuit equations are taken into account, vector b contains the voltages
across all voltage source branches and currents through constant current branches;
A is a function of the resistances of the resistors; x contains the unknown
currents.
For instance, the system (4.5) can be written as follows:
IC  IE  Is
ID  IE  Is
IA  IB  IC  0

4.3.2
Nodal Analysis
In basic usage of combined Kirchhoff’s and constitutive equations, constitutive
equations are directly inserted into Kirchhoff’s equations, resulting in a system
whose rank corresponds to the number of the latter.
In reality, this number can be further reduced, often dramatically, using the
solution method called the nodal analysis technique.2 This is a somewhat advanced
use of combined Kirchhoff and constitutive equations.
The method consists of writing KCL equations in such a way that KVL is
automatically satisﬁed. The order of the obtained system of equations is therefore
just n  1, where n is the number of circuit nodes. For instance, the order of the circuit
used as an example in Section 4.3.1 can be reduced (after all simpliﬁcations described
there have been carried out) from ﬁve to three.
Indeed, in Chapter 3, we stated that the KVL is equivalent to saying that a potential
exists—that is, that it is possible to deﬁne a potential function V with a value at each
circuit terminal, so that the constitutive equations are a function of potential
differences only.
It follows that if the circuit is analysed in terms of terminal potentials instead of
branch voltages, KVL is automatically satisﬁed.
Example 2. Write nodal analysis equations for the circuit reported in Figure 4.5.
Let us assume the potential of nodes N1, N2, etc., to be V1, V2, etc.
Since constitutive equations are a function only of branch voltages (i.e., potential
differences), the voltage of a terminal, usually one of those in the bottom line of the
circuit, can have an arbitrary value and is given the conventional value of zero for
simplicity. It can, for instance, be assumed as V0  0.
The equations of the circuit are now as follows (we have chosen to write the KCL
in form 1):
N1:
V3  V1
RC
 V1  V2
RE
 Is  0
N2:
V0  V2

 Is  0
N3:

 V3  V0
RB
 V3  V1

 0
2In other textbooks it is called “node voltage analysis” or “node voltage method.”
SOLVING TECHNIQUES
95

The equations to be written are not always exactly n  1. There are cases in which
their number is even lower.
Consider, for instance, the circuit shown in the top left part of Figure 4.6. Since it
has three nodes (node N0 is in expanded form), two nodal analysis equations can be
written. For instance, taking N0 as reference, we obtain
N1:
U0  V1
R0
 V1
R0
 V2  V1
R12
 0
N2:
V1  V2
R12
 U2  V2
R2
 U3  V2
R3
 0
(°)
which allows V1 and V2 to be determined; when these potentials are known, every
other quantity can be easily computed.
But what happens when R0 is zero? (top right-hand part of Figure 4.6). We need to
write something different from (°).
Circuits like the one shown in the top-right part of Figure 4.6 require special
treatment. Indeed, U1 is exactly equal to V1 (assuming as usual V0  0), and the circuit
can be solved referring only to the part in the lower diagram of Figure 4.6, with the
following equation:
N2:
U0  V2
R12
 U2  V2
R2
 U3  V2

which allows immediate computation of V2; once V2 is known, all node potentials are
known and everything else is then easily computed.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING DC CIRCUITS

Following these two examples, a general rule for nodal analysis can be written as
follows:
Rule: Nodal analysis equations
To write a nodal analysis equation, the following procedure applies (let the number
of circuit nodes be n):
1. Choose a reference node arbitrarily whose potential is set to zero.
2. Evaluate nodes whose voltage is known in advance. Let their number be m.
3. Write a KCL equation for each node, excluding the reference node and the
nodes for which the voltage is known in advance.
The total number of equations will thus be e  n  1  m.
Two further examples clarify the application of nodal analysis in some special
situations.
Example 3. Write nodal analysis equations for the following circuit:
Is
R1
+
R2
Us
V0 = 0 
N2
R3
R4

This circuit has two peculiarities:
• It contains a current source.
• It contains a voltage source without a terminal connected to the reference node.
The fact that there is a current source does not create difﬁculties. The voltage
source creates a situation similar to that of the circuit shown in Figure 4.6. Here,
however, the voltage source does not determine the potential of a node, but
instead determines the mathematical relation between the potentials of two
nodes:
V3  V2  Us
(°)
SOLVING TECHNIQUES

We can still reduce the number of nodal equations to be written. We can arbitrarily
decide whether to drop from the KCL equations that of node N2 or of N3. If we drop
N3, the following equations can be written:
N1:
Is  V1  V2
R1
 V1  V3
R4
 0
N2:
V2  V1

 I23  0
in which obviously
I23  V2  Us

After substituting the expression of I23 in the equations N1, N2, we produce a 2  2
system. Having solved this system, we know V1 and V2; thus, using (°), V3 is also
known.

U1 +
R1
+
+
R2

V0 = 0

N1
This example is really peculiar since node N1 potential is known, and therefore the
number of nodal analysis equations becomes n  m  1  2  1  1  0.
In this case no nodal analysis equation can be written, which is coherent with the
fact that the unique circuit node present in the circuit in addition to the reference one
has a known voltage.
Since all node potentials are known, from them all branch currents are easily
obtained by immediate application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Nodal analysis is extremely powerful and tends to be the preferred method for the
manual solution of circuits because of the very low number of equations it usually
generates.
4.3.3
Mesh Analysis
In the previous section we presented nodal analysis, showing how it is able to produce
simultaneous equations to be solved in a number as low as n  1, where n is the number
of circuit nodes. It is thus the favoured method for the manual solution of circuits.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING DC CIRCUITS

Many other techniques can be used and indeed are used by circuit experts;
however, to avoid confusion for readers, for whom circuit analysis is simply a tool
toward electrical engineering knowledge, these will not be dealt with here.
We wish only to mention mesh analysis,3 which allows us to write, for any given
circuit, a number of equations to be solved simultaneously, equal to the number of
KVL equations and usually greater than n  1.
The interested reader can ﬁnd details of this technique in references [bc1] and
[bc2].
4.3.4
Series and Parallel Resistors; Star/Delta Conversion
Consider the left part of Figure 4.7. Branch currents of resistors R1, R2, . . . Rn have
the same value and can therefore be represented by a single variable name: branches
sharing the same current are called branches in series. The voltage across each resistor
is proportional to this current.
By simple mathematical computations, it can be seen that the total voltage is also
proportional to this current, and therefore the whole set of resistors in series behave
like an equivalent resistor Reqs:

In the particularly simple case of a series of resistors all having equal resistance R,
this is obviously
Reqs  nR
Example 5. Calculate the equivalent resistance Reqs of the branch constituted by the
series of the following resistances: R1  20 Ω, R2  10 Ω, R3  5 Ω.
Reqs  R1  R2  R3  20  10  5  35 Ω
Now consider the right part of Figure 4.7. Branch voltages of resistors R1,
R2, . . . Rn have the same value and can therefore be represented by a single variable
name. Branches sharing the same voltage are called branches in parallel. The current
entering each resistor is proportional to this voltage.
By simple mathematical computations, it can be seen that the total current is also
proportional to this voltage, and therefore the whole set of resistors in parallel behaves
like an equivalent resistor Reqp. Computing is easier when, instead of the resistances in
parallel, we consider the corresponding conductances (equal to the reciprocal of the
resistances):
Ueqp  U1  U2  ∙∙∙ Un  G1I  G2I  ∙∙∙ GnI  G1  G2  ∙∙∙ GnI  GeqpI
In any circuit containing branches in parallel, the whole parallel can be substituted
by a single branch, with a conductance
Geqp  G1  G2  ∙∙∙ Gn
In everyday work situations, resistances are more common than conductances; it is
therefore useful and easy to show this formula in terms of resistors:

formula becomes

Please note that Reqp is always lower than all the resistances being paralleled.
Following the same approach, other equivalents can be found on particular circuit
sections. One important case is the so-called delta-star conversion (also named Δ–Y
or Δ–Wye conversion).
In circuital terms a star is a group of three resistors with one terminal in common
and the others free, while a delta is a connection of resistors one after the other, in such
a way as to form a closed shape resembling a triangle or a Greek uppercase delta
(Figure 4.8).
The equivalence formulas must be found in such a way that their behaviour, as seen
from the outside terminals (shown in Figure 4.8), is indistinguishable.
The conversion formulas are as follows (demonstration is omitted):

Voltage and Current Division
When resistors are in series or in parallel, special relations occur between voltages and
currents that are useful to investigate because of their practical implications.
Consider several resistors in series with resistances R1, R2, . . . Rn (left part of
Figure 4.7).
The ratio of the voltage applied to any of the individual branches, to the total
voltage applied to the series is:

Linearity and Superposition
It was seen in Section 4.3.1 that sets of Kirchhoff’s equations and constitutive
equations of DC circuits can be expressed in the standard form of linear systems:
Ax  b
The vector of known quantities b in circuits contains the numerical values of
voltage source voltages and current source currents, while the matrix A contains
information on the circuit topology carried by Kirchhoff’s equations and on the
constitutive equations of the nonsource branches, that is, the resistors.
To solve the system (4.7), any of the existing algorithms to solve linear systems
might be used. This can be visualised in Figure 4.9.
If b is composed of a sum of n terms
b  b1  b2  ∙∙∙ bn
it will be
Ax  b;
with
x  x1  x2  ∙∙∙ xn
where Ax1  b1; . . . ; Axn  bn
Therefore, the solution of the given circuit can be thought of as being the sum of
partial solutions x1, x2, xn obtained by the individual application of a partial set of
sources b1, b2, bn:
Result: Superposition principle
In a linear system such as a DC circuit, should the input vector be the sum of
several partial input vectors, the output vector is equal to the sum of the partial
output vectors.
The terminology of this result is explained in Figure 4.9.

The graphical nature of circuits facilitates several actions, one of which is the
application of the superposition principle. Instead of working with the matrix
description (4.7) of the circuit, it appears much more natural to work directly in
its graphical representation.
In circuit language, the decomposition of input vector b into several addends is
achieved by applying the sources one at a time, or in groups.
When a source is not applied, it is deactivated, that is, its value is equalled to
zero; this means, for voltage sources, that when it is deactivated, it must be
substituted by a wire directly connecting its two terminals (so that the voltage
across them is zero); for current sources it means that it must be substituted by the
disconnection of any wire between the two terminal ends, so that the current
through them is zero (Figure 4.10).
In circuit terminology, when a voltage source is to be deactivated, its terminals
must be short-circuited; however, when a current source is deactivated, they must be
open-circuited. Two terminals connected to each other are called a short circuit, two
terminals without any connections constitute an open circuit. This allows us to
summarize superposition in circuits as follows:
Rule: Superposition principle in circuits
Linear circuits can be solved by applying voltage and current sources one at a time,
and partial summing results. It is possible to use them in groups.
When a voltage or current source is not applied (or is deactivated), the corre-
sponding branch is short- or open-circuited, respectively.
Example 11. The use of the superposition principle can be effectively illustrated if
we refer again to the circuit of Figure 4.5, as shown in Figure 4.11. The inputs are Us
and Is.
deactivating Us
means setting Us = 0; 
this implies

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING DC CIRCUITS

Example 12. Figures 4.12 and 4.13 show possible ways to apply the superposition
principle to a more complex circuit. Since this circuit has three sources, either each of
them is considered individually, in which case the result includes the three contribu-
tions, or they are grouped differently—that is, ﬁrst the two voltage sources and then
the current source.
Any other grouping would be acceptable, so the user can choose whatever is
deemed to be more useful or practical.
From the examples shown, it should be clear to the reader that using the
superposition principle to solve a circuit is normally not advantageous, since it
requires the solution of several circuits, however simpliﬁed, rather than one only.
It is, however, very important and useful in understanding how circuits work and
can generate simpliﬁed computations in several practical situations.
Moreover, it is the basis for demonstrating the very important Thévenin theorem
which is very useful and widely used in normal circuit-solving practice.
4.3.7
Thévenin’s Theorem
Consider a circuit. If two wires are highlighted (w1 and w2), the circuit will be
composed of two subcircuits, interfaced by means of them (Figure 4.14a). Any of
the two subcircuits can contain an arbitrary number of voltage and current sources
and resistors, connected to each other in an arbitrary fashion; it is, however,

mandatory to suppose that one of the two parts (let this be the left-hand one) is
linear.
For a circuit section to be linear, it is sufﬁcient that the constitutive equations of all circuit
branches are linear. All the constitutive equations used in this book are linear.
Let the current ﬂowing in the upper wire in the right direction be I, and let the voltage
across the two wires be U12. By applying the substitution principle (Section 3.6), the
electric equilibrium of the left-hand part of the circuit can be obtained simply by
substituting the right-hand, part with the current source I (Figure 4.14b).
Now the superposition principle can be applied; since the hand grouping of sources
can be arbitrary, we can decide that in the ﬁrst circuit all the sources belonging to the
left-hand part of the circuit are activated, and I is considered to be inactive (therefore
the corresponding branch is eliminated from the circuit); then we can suppose that I is
active, but all other sources (i.e., all the sources present in the left-hand part of the
circuit) are deactivated.
Therefore (Figure 4.14c),

SOLVING TECHNIQUES

The ﬁrst term of the sum, U0
12, is the voltage appearing across the left-hand circuit
terminals when I is applied and internal sources are deactivated; in these conditions,
the left circuit is a network of resistances, for which the voltage to current ratio is a
constant, a function of the resistor network. This constant, which has the dimensions
of a resistance, is the so-called equivalent resistance of the left part of the circuit:
Therefore we can describe equation (4.9) as follows:
Law: Thévenin’s theorem
In a circuit composed of two parts, connected to each other by means of two wires,
one part, if linear, can be substituted by the series of a voltage source and a resistor.
The voltage source voltage is the voltage appearing across the two terminals of
this part when disconnected from the other one; the resistor’s resistance is the
value “seen” from the terminals, when all the internal sources are deactivated
(cf. Figure 4.10).
The Thévenin equivalent of a subcircuit is therefore composed of the series of two
simple components (Figure 4.14d). It is apparent that this theorem can greatly
simplify circuit analysis: If knowledge of the voltages and currents inside the left
part is not necessary, then the whole part, which might be composed of an arbitrary
number of branches, loops, and nodes, is substituted by a very simple equivalent,
which enables us to analyse all the right part of the circuit.

POWER AND ENERGY AND JOULE’S LAW
Power and energy in circuits have already been discussed in Chapter 3. It was shown
that the power that ﬂows from one part of a circuit to another is
p  ui
In DC circuits, everything is constant and uppercase letters are used to advantage to
underline this:
P  UI
112
TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING DC CIRCUITS

Attention must be paid to signs, since P is directed toward the part of the
circuit into which the assumed current enters from the positively marked terminal
(Figure 4.15). As usual, we must remember that the arrow for I and the “” for U are
only assumed ﬂow direction and polarity: actual values of I and U will be positive or
negative depending on whether the actual charge ﬂow and voltage polarity4 are in
agreement with the assumed signs or opposite to them.
This also transfers to the value of power. In Figure 4.15, P will be in accordance
with the assumed direction, represented by the arrow, if (and only if) its numerical
value is positive.
What happens if subcircuit 2 is composed of just a single resistor? Ohm’s equation
U  RI applies, with U and I again measured according to the load convention—that
is, current entering the positive terminal. Therefore,
P  UI  RI ? I  RI2
(4.11)
Thus the resistor always absorbs power, whatever the sign of the applied current
and voltage. This power will be converted into heat in the resistor, and the thermal
power generated is given by (4.11). The law (4.11) is very important since it
establishes a link between the worlds of electricity and thermal phenomena. Since
it was ﬁrst stated by James Prescott Joule, it is called Joule’s law.
Law: Joule’s law
The power absorbed by any resistor is always positive, and equal to RI2  U2/R.
This power is converted into electromagnetic radiation, usually at a frequency
corresponding to heat.

when I is positive.

Consider again Example 3 discussed in Section 3.5.3, for reasons of clarity shown
again in Figure 4.16.
If the constitutive equations are known, all voltages and currents can be obtained
by integrating the latter into Kirchhoff’s equations and reducing the set of equations
even more by making use of the nodal analysis technique.
Following the procedure in Section 4.3.1, once the branch constitutive equations
are known, the circuit is written directly containing speciﬁc symbols for the
branches. For instance, the circuit in Figure 4.17 is just a speciﬁc version of the

one in Figure 4.16, where A is a voltage source, B is a current source, C is a resistor,
and so on. This circuit can be solved using one of the techniques introduced in this
chapter:
• direct use of constitutive equations in KCL and KVL (Section 4.3.1);
• nodal analysis (Section 4.3.2).
Other techniques such as mesh analysis can be used, but these are not considered in
this book.
The circuit can also be ﬁrst transformed into a set of simpler circuits using the
principle of superposition, and these simpler circuits can be solved using one of the
circuit-solving techniques.
It has already been noted in Section 4.3.6 that adoption of the principle of
superposition is normally a lengthy process and is not recommended, except in
special cases. Therefore, a basic combination of Kirchhoff-constitutive equations, as
well as the more advanced nodal analysis, is used here, both to illustrate their practical
application and to demonstrate, once again, that node voltage analysis is more
effective for manual computations.
Basic Usage of Combined Kirchhoff-Constitutive Equations.
This leads us to
equations whose structure depends on the choices of nodes for KCL and loops for
KVL equations. Choosing, for instance, nodes N1, N2, N3 for KCL and L1 and L2 for
KVL, the following equations are obtained (remember that currents are taken as
entering branches from “” signs with the obvious exceptions of IB and IF):

For instance, the following equations can be written from Ohm’s law and/or from

currents once they are computed using the system (4.12):
V2  RDID;
Ohm’s law on RD

KVL in loop La1 in Figure 4:18
V3  V2  REIE

In a similar way, the following trivial equations can be written from Ohm’s law
and/or KCL equations, which allow the node voltages to be determined from the
currents, once they are computed using (4.13):
ID  V2=RD

(4.15)
The full numerical solution of the circuit is shown in Table 4.3, with two
different sets of values for resistances and for voltage and current sources. From the
values of Table 4.3, the power absorbed by all branches can be easily computed and
the energy conservation can be easily veriﬁed. The numerical data are shown in
Table 4.4.
In all cases, resistors absorb power, as they should. In example no. 1 the current
generators globally deliver 3 W, while the voltage generators and the resistors absorb
1 W and 2 W, respectively. In example no. 2 the current generators globally deliver 9 W,
while the voltage generators and the resistors absorb 2.5 W and 6.5 W, respectively.
Clearly, in both cases the power delivered by the current generators perfectly equates that
absorbed by the other resistors and the voltage generators.

Example 15. Consider Figure 4.19, which shows Thévenin’s theorem applied to
compute the current ID. Instead of solving the full circuit, the simple circuit containing
UTh, RTh, and RD can be solved.
The value of UTh is easily computed considering that this quantity is the open-
circuit voltage—that is, the voltage that would appear at the RD terminals if RD were
disconnected from the circuit (see the central circuit of Figure 4.19). RTh, in turn, is the
resistance “seen” from the RD terminals when the circuit to which RD is connected is
made passive, by deactivation of all the inner sources. This is shown in the bottom
drawing of Figure 4.19, in which current sources are deactivated and substituted by
open circuits, thus forcing the current to zero, while the electromotive force is
deactivated and substituted by ideal wires, forcing the corresponding branch voltage
to zero.
In order to ﬁnd UTh, it is much simpler to solve the central circuit of Figure 4.19
than to solve the original (at top of ﬁgure). It can be solved using any of the circuit-
solving techniques—that is, for the reader of this book, the direct application of
Kirchhoff’s laws, or nodal analysis.

However, the cases considered in the previous examples, shown in Table 4.3,
involved special numerical values, for which
UA  UG  Us;
IB  IF  Is;
RC  RE  RH  RI  R
These conditions create a special symmetry that can be exploited, with the help of
the superposition technique (Section 4.3.6), to ﬁnd the ﬁnal solution with virtually no
computations. Indeed, the circuit can be decomposed in two parts to be superposed, as
shown in Figure 4.20.
In the upper circuit of Figure 4.20, it is apparent that no current circulates, and
therefore UTh  Us. In the lower part, because of symmetry, the currents in the right
part of the circuit must be the mirror version of the ones in the left part. Therefore, the
currents ﬂowing in the right and left wires connected to node N2, measured toward the
right part of the circuit must be opposite to each other. But their sums must also be
equal, because of the charge conservation in node N2, and therefore both must be null.
Consequently the currents of the current generators ﬂow in the bottom resistances,
which implies that U00
Th is equal to RI. As regards RTh, it is easy to verify (Figure 4.21)
that it is equal to R.

The example examined in this section contains components (the two current
sources) shown inclined. As discussed in Chapter 3, if it is preferable to have all
components shown either horizontally or vertically, it is normally sufﬁcient to draw
some voltages in an expanded fashion. For instance, the circuit of Figure 4.16 (and
therefore also Figure 4.17) can be drawn as shown in Figure 4.22.

RESISTIVE CIRCUITS OPERATING
WITH VARIABLE QUANTITIES
All the developments in this chapter derive from the conclusions of Chapter 3, which
are valid for any circuit and for the list of constitutive equations in Table 4.1.
It could be very easy to demonstrate that all the results obtained here—for
example, the use of combined Kirchhoff-constitutive equations, nodal analysis,
superposition, and Thevenin’s theorem—are still valid when the constitutive equa-
tions are as shown in Table 4.5, that is, when current and voltage sources are not
constant, but all nonsource branches are resistive.

HISTORICAL NOTES
4.7.1
Short Biography of Ohm
The physicist George Simon Ohm5 (Germany) is mainly famous for the law named
after him, which relates voltage and potential in a conductor.
He graduated from the University of Erlangen in 1811 and then taught for several
years at primary and secondary schools. In 1826 he became physics professor ﬁrst at
the Military Academy of Berlin and then at the universities of Nuremberg and
Munich.
His main studies concerned current ﬂow in conductors, which resulted (after
further contributions from other scientists) in the law known today as “Ohm’s law.”
He also conducted studies on light interference and on the ear’s perception of
complex sounds.
4.7.2
Short Biography of Thévenin
Léon Charles Thévenin (1857–1926) was a French engineer who is mainly famous for
his theorem for circuits. Born in Meaux, near Paris, he graduated from the Ecole
polytéchnique in 1876. Two years later he joined France’s national electrical
communication company (Postes et Télégraphes), which he never left.
After studying circuit laws (by Kirchhoff and Ohm), he developed what is now
called Thévenin’s theorem, which allowed people to reduce complex circuits into
simpler ones, containing “Thévenin’s equivalent”.
Science biographies show that the same theorem had already been developed 30 years
earlier, by Hermann von Helmholtz. Credit is given to Thévenin for developing his own
version of the same theorem while unaware of Helmholtz’s work.
When Thévenin issued his theorem, it was widely disputed. Shortly before his
death, however, it became accepted all over the world.

Short Biography of Joule
James Prescott Joule6 (1818–1889) was born in Salford, Manchester. He spent his life
managing his brewery in Salford and studying physics. Despite his lack of a formal
education, his important scientiﬁc achievements led to an honoris causa degree from
the University of Leida.
His most signiﬁcant achievement was a mathematical relation that links the heat
produced by a current-carrying conductor, its resistance, and the current itself. This
relationship is today universally referred to as Joule’s law. Also very important
were his studies leading to his paper on the “mechanical equivalent of heat” which
gave vital impetus to the deﬁnition of the First Law of Thermodynamics. He also
worked with W. Thompson (Lord Kelvin) to develop the absolute scale of
temperature.
The S.I. unit of energy (as well as of work and heat), the joule, is named after him.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING
AC CIRCUITS
For the Instructor
This chapter has some special features that should make circuit study clearer.
(1) Use of R–L models for AC transmission lines. The use of R–L models for AC
transmission lines in circuits is tricky: the user could be induced to consider
transmission lines as true “circuits”—that is, to determine voltage between
sending-end and receiving-end terminals as a difference of terminal potentials.
This is not possible, and only voltages between top and bottom terminals at
either ends can be computed. This limitation is normally disregarded in
textbooks, thus inducing potential errors. It is, instead, analysed here in a
simple but effective way; a deeper analysis can be found in the Appendix.
(2) Transformer modelling. In textbooks for electrical engineers, transformers
are dealt with both through the T model containing an ideal transformer (and
other components such as leakage inductances and coil resistances) and using
the mutual inductance concept. To simplify things to our readers, in this book
we have adopted only the approach based on the ideal transformer.
(3) KVL in networks containing transformers. In this chapter it is explicitly noted
that Kirchhoff’s voltage equations must be written separately for the parts of
the network separated by the ideal transformer. This is so important that the

word “network,” often considered to be a synonym of “circuit,” is used here to
indicate a set of circuits separated from each other by ideal transformers—that
is, one or more magnetically coupled circuits.
Some ﬁnal words regarding the deﬁnition of phasors: in some books phasors are
deﬁned as having amplitudes equal to the rms values of the corresponding sine
waves, instead of their peak values. Other books ﬁrst use peak-oriented phasors,
then, following a presentation of AC power, rms-oriented phasors. The latter is
preferable in courses for electrical engineering students, since to some extent it
facilitates computations. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, this book uses only
peak-oriented phasors—that is, phasors whose amplitude is equal to the peak of
the corresponding wave.
5.1
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 3, “circuits” were introduced as a mathematical–graphical tool, useful for
analysing physical systems composed of electric elements connected to each other by
meansof wires.It was also shownthat,under givenassumptions, circuits caneffectively
model physical systems that work with either constant or variable quantities.
In Chapter 4 we focused on DC circuits, in which all quantities (mainly currents,
voltages, powers) do not vary over time.
This chapter is mainly devoted to the analysis of alternating current (AC) circuits,
in which all the quantities (mainly currents, voltages, powers) vary as sinusoids over
time. AC circuits are the most common ones in everyday life, since the energy
provided by the mains into all of our homes, industries, and so on, is in this form.
In addition, we will deal with two kinds of circuits in which the quantities do not
vary as sinusoids, namely the R–L circuit (containing a resistor and an inductor) and
the R–C circuit (containing a resistor and a capacitor). This is because of their general
importance and because they need to be understood in order to fully master the
analysis of power electronic components and devices, which is in Chapter 8.
5.2
ENERGY STORAGE ELEMENTS
In Chapter 3 we introduced several possible constitutive equations of circuit branches
in their mathematical formulations.
In Chapter 4 we studied circuits with special constitutive equations, which cause
all currents and voltages to be constant.
Here we introduce other branches, whose idealized behaviour can be mathemati-
cally described by other constitutive equations enclosed in the set in Table 3.4. Since
these are differential equations, we will show that the corresponding components have
some energy storage capability and are therefore called globally energy storage
elements.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

5.2.1
Power in Time-Varying Circuits
Consider again the analysis in Chapter 4 (Section 4.4) for developing an expression
relating voltage, current, and power in DC circuits. The reader is invited to personally
verify that the same considerations developed there can be repeated for any time t.
Therefore, the result obtained can be repeated also for circuits working with time-
varying quantities:
Result: Power ﬂowing through two circuit terminals
In any circuit, operating with either constant or variable quantities, the power
exchanged by any two-terminal subcircuit to the other subcircuit is numerically
equal to the product of voltage and current.
Power is delivered by the subcircuit in which the current leaves from the positive
of the two terminals.
Figure 5.1 shows this result.
5.2.2
The Capacitor
Consider the system depicted in Figure 5.2.
This is composed of two large conductor surfaces, separated by a thin insulating
layer (called the dielectric). Conductors are connected to the surface by means of the
two terminals: access is given to the voltage across terminals.
Since the surfaces are very large in comparison to the distance between them
d (i.e., h >> d and b >> d), it can be assumed that the electric ﬁeld in the space
between them is uniform, with the force lines parallel to each other and orthogonal to
the surfaces.
This allows us to determine the relation between the charge stored on the two
surfaces (assumed to be equal in value but opposite in sign) and the electric ﬁeld inside

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

Any systems constituted by two large conductors separated by a thin layer of
insulating material have the same basic characteristics as the system shown in
Figure 5.2 and are thus capacitors, whose capacitance has a ﬁxed value which
can be computed with formulas that are very similar to (5.1).
Equation (5.1) is the constitutive equation of a capacitor. For a discussion of what a
constitutive equation is, see Section 3.5.2.
The constitutive equation is useful to analyse the behaviour of capacitors inside
circuits.
Consider the scheme in Figure 5.3. Imagine the two terminals t1 and t2 as being
connected internally to the two plates, in such a way that current can ﬂow freely
between the outside wires and the plates. The testing circuit, this time, also contains
the ideal switch S.
An ideal switch is a circuit component that can be either in the so-called closed
state, in which case it behaves like an ideal wire, or in the so-called open state, in
which it behaves as if nothing was present between its terminals—that is, as an open
circuit, as it is usually termed.
Note that the terminology of electric switches is opposite to that of hydraulics circuits:
when a hydraulic valve or a water tap is open, it allows ﬂuid to ﬂow; when it is closed, no
ﬂow can occur.

Attention must be paid to the various signs: As clearly indicated in Figure 5.3, the
proportionality coefﬁcient is C > 0 if the current is assumed to be entering the
component through the positively marked terminal.
It goes without saying that if the choice of reference signs for voltage and current is
different—that is, if the current is assumed to be entering the pin with an assumed
negative potential—the equation should be written with the minus sign, as already
stated in Table 3.4.
Equation (5.2) indicates that the physical system shown in the ﬁgure between
terminals t1 and t2 can be mathematically described in a given circuit, with a close
approximation, using the “capacitive element” constitutive equation. This component
is very important in electrical engineering and is widely used. The actual physical
construction of a capacitor can be different from the basic structure shown in
Figure 5.3. For instance, a capacitor can be physically built in a cylindrical shape,
so as to occupy less space.
When a capacitor is being charged or discharged, it stores or delivers energy to the
circuit. When it is charged, the energy can be imagined to accumulate in the electric
ﬁeld in the space around the capacitor conducting plates.

Evaluating the energy transfer during capacitor charge is quite simple. Consider a
charge starting at t  t0 (with a null capacitor voltage, and therefore null stored charge q)
and ending at t  tf. It is

Inductors and Magnetic Circuits
Consider the system depicted in Figure 5.4. It is composed of a coil with N turns of
conductive material around a toroid made of magnetic material (e.g., iron). Since
the toroid constitutes a loop in which the magnetic ﬁeld circulates, it resembles a
mesh in an electric circuit and is therefore also called magnetic circuit. If current i
ﬂows through the coil, a magnetic ﬁeld is generated around it. It can be demon-
strated that, as a consequence of iron’s much higher permeability compared to air,
most magnetic ﬂux ﬂows through iron; the ﬂux traversing the coil but ﬂowing at
least partially in air is called leakage ﬂux. For simplicity’s sake, let us disregard the
leakage ﬂux for a while.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

In this case, all the force lines of magnetic ﬁeld inside the iron coil share the same
length l, and therefore Ampère’s law (Section 2.4) can be applied to the system in
Figure 5.4 as follows:
H  N i
l
This magnetic ﬁeld inside the iron torus produces a ﬂux density B expressed as
B  μH
Throughout this book, iron nonlinearity is disregarded; as a consequence the
permeability μ is assumed to be constant in the previous equation.
This ﬂux density produces the ﬂux (B being assumed to be constant along the area
Am) in the iron toroid
ϕ  BAm  μBAm
and the ﬂux linkage
ψ  Nϕ  μNBAm
All the constants introduced can be combined in a global constant L, called
inductance, which is the coefﬁcient between current and ﬂux linkage:
ψ  μNBAm  μNHSAm  μ N2Am
l
i  Li
(5.3)
The inductance L is composed of a characteristic of the coil (the number N) and other
variables which are characteristic of the magnetic circuit. This is clearer if it is written
L  N2
R ;
where
R 
l
μAm
(5.4)
The quantity R is called reluctance of the magnetic circuit.
The system shown in Figure 5.4 can be interfaced with other systems by means of
its terminals A–B. Therefore, it is very useful to describe the behaviour of the whole
system by means of an equation that relates the potential difference across its
terminals uAB  vA  vB with the current i entering terminal A. This is easily done
by combining Faraday’s law (Chapter 2) with result (5.3):
Ef   dψ
dt  L di

(5.5)
Equation (5.5) is the constitutive equation of an inductor.
The sign “” in this equation depends on how the reference signs for Ef and i are
set in a circuit. Compare the discussion in Section 2.5, and the circuital representations
of inductors and reference signs immediately before More in Depth box D of
Chapter 2.
ENERGY STORAGE ELEMENTS
137

Equation (5.5) remains valid also in the event that leakage ﬂux is not neglected:
The formulation of L is different from that obtained earlier when all the ﬂux ﬂowing
through the iron toroid was taken into account.
A particularly signiﬁcant case is that of a circuit which mainly traverses iron (i.e.,
material with very high permeability), but has a small part constituted by air. Two
examples are shown in Figure 5.5.
Consider ﬁrst the magnetic circuit shown in the left-hand part of Figure 5.5. The
force lines of magnetic ﬁeld H are closed loops that mostly traverse iron, but also
traverse the air gap whose width is indicated as x in the ﬁgure.
It could easily be demonstrated that equations (5.3), (5.4) and (5.5) are still valid, with
an appropriate evaluation of the circuit reluctance as (subscripts “ag” stands for “air-gap”)

Since iron permeability is thousands of times that of air, in many cases it can be more
simply assumed as
R ≅Rag
The same considerations apply to the more complex magnetic circuit shown in the
right-hand part of Figure 5.5. Here iron reluctance must be computed by taking into
account the two paths in parallel and summing two air gaps to the iron path, as follows:
R  Rf e;tot  Rag;tot  Rf e;path=2  2 ? Rag
and, approximately
R ≅Rf e;tot
The constitutive equation is useful to analyse the behaviour of inductors inside
circuits.
Consider the scheme in Figure 5.6. Imagine the two terminals t1 and t2 as being
connected internally to the two coil terminals. The testing circuit this time also
contains the ideal switch S, whose concept was introduced in Section 5.2.2.

Suppose that the current i ﬂowing into terminal t1 is zero at t  0, and that at t  0
the switch S, which was previously open, is closed. If the coil ﬂux linkage and the
current i ﬂowing in the circuit are measured over time, it can be concluded from the
laws of electromagnetism (Chapter 2) and experimentally veriﬁed that ﬂux linkage is
proportional to the current:
ψt  Lit
A practical way to experimentally evaluate the ﬂux linkage is by using Faraday’s
law (see Chapter 2 again), coupled with Ohm’s law:
ut  Rit  dψt

Therefore, the equation deﬁning the proportionality coefﬁcient L between ﬂux linkage
and current is
ut  Rit  L dit
dt
(5.6)
As with the capacitor, attention must be paid to signs. Signs are to be determined
using Lenz’s rule: a rising current generates a positive polarity in the terminal where
the current is entering the coil. The result is the positive sign shown in equation (5.6).
Moreover, to allow ﬂux linkage to be related to the current that generates it by a
positive proportionality coefﬁcient, its reference direction must be combined with the
current reference direction according to the right-hand rule, as shown in Figure 5.3.
The rule is applied as follows. Using the right hand, curl the ﬁngers and align them with
the coil windings in such a way that ﬁngertips are oriented as arrowheads of the reference
direction of the coil current; the thumb indicates the reference direction of ﬂux (the
arrowhead is its tip).
The sign rule for inductors can be concisely expressed in the following way: if
current and voltage reference signs are paired in such a way that the current enters the
feeder

positively marked terminal, then Faraday’s electromotive force has the same sign as
the corresponding ohmic voltage drop, as in (5.6).
When an inductor is being charged or discharged, it stores or delivers energy to the
circuit. When it is charged, the energy can be imagined as accumulating in the
magnetic ﬁeld in the space around the inductor coil.
As for the capacitor, evaluating the energy transfer during capacitor charge is quite
simple: consider a charge starting at t  t0 and ending at t  tf. This is shown here, for
simplicity sake, for an ideal inductor—that is, an inductor for which the effects or
resistance R are negligible. It is

current is also null (i.e., zero). Therefore, the energy accumulated in the inductor,
whose inductance is L and in which the current i ﬂows is E  1
2Li2; this charge is sent
back to the circuit when the inductor is discharged. Again, note the evident similarity
with the energy accumulated in a translating mass m moving at a velocity v: E  1

MODELLING TIME-VARYING CIRCUITAL
SYSTEMS AS CIRCUITS
In Chapter 3, Kirchhoff’s laws were introduced for circuits. In Chapter 4 it was shown
that circuital systems (physical systems with circuital shape, i.e., composed of sub-
systems connected to each other by wires), operating with all constant quantities—
commonly known as “DC circuits”—can be modelled through circuits (i.e., lumped-
component models of circuital systems) containing a branch between each pair of points
in space through which non-negligible current can ﬂow.
Modelling a physical system as a circuit gives us the power of using Kirchhoff’s laws.
The hypotheses which in DC allowed a physical circuital system to be modelled by
a circuit, relied on the fact that all quantities were constant (this in turn implied that the
branches were either resistors or constant voltage or constant current sources).
These hypotheses are not valid when time-varying circuital systems are consid-
ered. Analysis of these systems will be dealt with in the following sections.
5.3.1
The Basic Rule
Consider the physical system shown in Figure 5.7a. To understand this, we must
postulate that it is possible to build a “generator”—that is, a device able to generate a
140
TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

time-varying voltage at its left-hand side (i.e., between terminals t0 and t1). From
engineering practice, this is known to be true and should be part of the student’s
previous knowledge.
This device is postulated as having a border b1, which isolates it from the external
world, in such a way that no electric phenomena can cross its borders: no electric
charge, no displacement current, and no effects of electric and magnetic ﬁelds inside
this source inﬂuence the external world, and vice versa, except for what occurs
through the component terminals.
This characteristic of interacting with the external world through the terminals is
also postulated for the load.
The remainder of the circuit is constituted by a two-conductor line (imagine them
to be constituted by two copper cylinders), connecting the generator with the load
constituted by an inductor, whose behaviour was summarised in Section 5.2.3.
It appears natural to build, as a candidate circuit for modelling the physical system
of Figure 5.7a, a circuit with four terminals at the connection points of the two line
conductors with source and load, as shown in Figure 5.7b.
To do this, the actual system behaviour should be mainly conﬁned to the four
boxes, meaning that:
• Conduction and displacement currents outside the circuit wires are negligible.
• Any other inﬂuence of what happens in the space around the conductors on what
occurs inside them must be negligible. Therefore, the effects of induced
electromotive force on the loop constituted by the two wires, the source and
the load must be negligible.
Under these assumptions, the conductor wires connecting source and load can be
modelled by their ohmic resistance, and therefore the equation governing the system

Therefore
u10t  u21t  u32t  u03t  0
It is possible to deﬁne, at any given time t, a potential function of the circuit
terminal T v(t, T), thus allowing branch voltages to be computed as the difference
between the values this function assumes, at any given time, at the corresponding
terminals; in fact, if such a function exists, it can be written as
v1  v0  v2  v1  v3  v2  v3  v0  0
The result of the above sum is zero because each term occurs once with a positive sign
and once with a negative one.
This mathematical analysis allows the system of Figure 5.7a to be modelled, under
the given hypotheses, by the circuit in Figure 5.7b, with the following constitutive
equations:
A: uAt  et;
B: uBt  RBiBt;
C:uCt  RCiCt;
D: uDt  RuiD  LudiDt=dt
The constitutive equation of block D is not in one of the forms considered in
Table 3.4; to obtain this, the component’s behaviour needs to be split into two parts,
one purely ohmic (modelled by Ru) and another purely inductive (modelled by Lu) as
shown in Figure 5.7c.
It should now be clear that this analysis could be repeated for any circuital system
with components that can be modelled as circuit elements, connected to each other by
142
TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

their terminals, and a unique potential function v can be deﬁned to evaluate circuit
terminal potentials.
For instance, Figure 5.8 shows the example of a circuital system containing
multiple loops. It should be clear that also in this example the boundaries around the
circuit devices deﬁne the latter as circuit elements. If, in addition, conduction and
displacement currents around the conductors are disregarded, along with the effects of
the time-varying magnetic ﬁeld around the wires, then the system can be modelled
using the circuit in Figure 5.9 and, possibly, if the wire resistances are disregarded, the
one in Figure 5.10.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

The systems proposed in this section should make it clear under which hypotheses
circuital systems can be modelled as circuits. They can be expressed as follows.
Rule Modelling of time-varying systems through circuits
In a circuital system made of components that can be modelled as circuit elements,
connected to each other by conducting wires, the following statement is true:
If conduction and displacement currents in the air surrounding circuit wires are
negligible, as are voltages induced according to Faraday’s law in the areas between
wires,
then the conductor wires can be represented by their equivalent resistance, and
KVL applies to the system, which can therefore be modelled as a circuit. Branch
voltages can be written as the difference of corresponding terminal potentials.
Time-varying systems to be modelled as circuits will contain elements whose
constitutive equations are those reported in Table 3.4. It is fairly obvious that in order
for at least some of the quantities to have actual variation over time, at least one of the
sources (either voltage or current source) will have to be a function of time.
5.3.2
Modelling Circuital Systems When Induced EMFs
Between Wires Cannot Be Neglected
There are some cases in which magnetic induction by Faraday’s law is not negligible
and thus we need to extend the analysis of the previous section to accommodate
this need.
Consider again Figure 5.7a. Let us now analyse it without ignoring the effect of
induction in the area between the upper and lower conductors. This ﬁgure is shown in
Figure 5.11 with minor modiﬁcations.
If the two wires cover a long distance, it may be of interest to compute only the
voltage between terminals t1 and t0, and between t2 and t3. For instance, the line could
be a transmission line and only the voltage at the sending and receiving ends are of
interest.

145

In this case, even though a potential cannot be deﬁned for each of the shown
terminals, we can derive the mathematical relation between them.
Indeed, the two constitutive equations of sending-end and receiving-end blocks:
u10t  ust;
u23t  Ruit  Lu

(5.7)
can be associated with the equation of the line containing Ohm’s and Faraday’s laws:

dt ψAt  Rlit  Ll
d
dt it
(5.8)
in which Rl and Ll are line resistance and inductance respectively, and ψA is the
magnetic ﬂux linked with area A.
Equation (5.8) is similar to a constitutive equation since it relates electrical
quantities as seen from the line terminals; however, it is not exactly the same, since
it does not allow us to determine “cross-voltages” such as u13(t) or u20(t) since they are
undeﬁned.
The set of (5.7 and (5.8)) is able to describe the behaviour of the metacircuit shown
in Figure 5.12.
The word “metacircuit” is introduced here. The dashed lines indicate that this is not
a true circuit, since it cannot be used to compute potential differences between a
terminal at the sending end of the transmission line and one at the receiving end, but
only potential differences between terminals at the same end of the line.
In common engineering practice, the two dashed lines are not drawn, and circuits
containing transmission lines (i.e., systems in which the effects of induction are not
negligible) are written as normal circuits; any electrical engineer, however, knows that
in these cases it is not correct to evaluate potential differences between terminals
situated at two opposite ends of the line.
For those interested, the topic is further developed in the Appendix.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

Consider a component constituted as shown in Figure 5.13. It is composed of two
conductors, each of them wound several times around a toroid of ferromagnetic
material. The very high magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials, compared
to air, causes the magnetic ﬁeld produced by any current ﬂowing in the conductor to
be conﬁned, for the most part, within the toroid itself.
A simpliﬁed description of the behaviour of the system in Figure 5.13 can be found
under the hypothesis of proportionality of electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density
within the iron core B  μFe H when iron magnetic permeability is much greater than
the surrounding air permeability: μFe >> μair.
In Chapter 7, where the system in Figure 5.13 will be analysed in much more detail,
it will be shown that under these hypotheses the following equations apply (ϕ is the
magnetic ﬂux ﬂowing in the torus):
u1t  R1i1t  N1
dϕt
dt
u2t  R2i2t  N2
dϕt
dt
N1i1t  N2i2t  0
(5.9)
Different ways of winding the two conductors around the torus are possible. In the
left coil of the ﬁgure, the wire winds from top to bottom in a counterclockwise direction
(as seen from the upper part of the drawing); the opposite occurs in the right coil.
Different winding orientations have effects on the signs of the different terms of
equations (5.9).
Dots “•” reported on the ﬁgure give useful information about the coil winding
orientation. They indicate that the second terms of equations (5.9)—that is, those
expressing Faraday’s law—are in phase, when voltages u1 and u2 are expressed as
potentials at the dot-marked minus potentials at the unmarked terminals.
In the third equation, we make an algebraic sum of two magnetomotive forces. The
minus sign is a consequence of how the coils are wound and the directions assumed for i1
and i2. In fact, applying the right-hand rule it is easily seen that i1 creates a magneto-
motive force that tends to “push” the magnetic ﬁeld (thus the magnetic ﬂux) in the
direction of the symbol ϕ shown; i2, on the contrary, creates a magnetomotive force that
acts against the one created by i1.

147

The dots “•” reported in the drawing also indicate this. They can be interpreted as
follows: If both currents enter or leave the dot-marked terminals, the magneto motive
forces created by the two coils contribute together to the ﬂux and they must be summed
using plus signs; if on the contrary one of them leaves a dot, one of the two
magnetomotive forces receives minus signs, as in the third of (5.9).
The sign of the term of Faraday’s law is such that the induced electromotive forces tend
to create currents in the circuits outside the transformer, and these tend to oppose the ﬂux
change, according to Lenz’s law.
Consider for instance the left coil. When ϕ is increasing, it must produce a voltage that,
when applied to an external resistor, would circulate a current opposite in direction to ϕ.
Such a current, according to the right-hand rule, would have the opposite direction to i1.
Therefore the Faraday’s law induced voltage must have the plus sign in the upper
terminal, as u1 in ﬁgure. The same reason can be repeated for the right coil and voltage u2.
If the further assumption that the ﬁrst terms of the right-hand sums (i.e., Ohm’s law
terms) are negligible in comparison to the second ones is correct, the following can be
written:
u1t ≅u10t  N1
dϕt
dt
u2t ≅u10t  N2
dϕt

which, combined with the third equation of (5.9), give the following set of equations
(equations of the ideal transformer):
u1t ≅N1

u2t
i2t ≅N1

(5.10)
An ideal transformer—that is, a device characterised by the two equations in
(5.10)—transfers to one side, for instance the right side (called the secondary side),
exactly the same power that it receives from the other side (called the primary side).
So power conservation applies to ideal transformers (see Figure 5.14b)
Note that if ϕ(t) varies slowly with time, or even if it does not vary at all, (5.10)
cannot be inferred from (5.9), because the ﬁrst terms of the sums on the right of (5.9)
are not negligible, which was the assumption that enabled us to obtain (5.10).
Therefore, the ideal transformer concept is used in physical transformers only in
AC, since the commonly used frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz allow us to infer (5.10)
from (5.9) with reasonable approximation for basic analysis. In no way can physical
transformers based on Faraday’s laws be used in DC.
The device shown in Figure 5.13, as seen from its exterior, has four terminals, two
on its left side, two on the right. When inserted into a circuit, it should be represented
148

as “a box” with two terminals on the left and two on the right. Indeed, the importance
of the component is such as to merit a speciﬁc symbol rather than a generic box, as
shown in Figure 5.14b.
The symbol must be such that the electric behaviour must be determined even
though the inner structure of the windings and magnetic circuit are not known. This is
obtained by means of the two dots “•”. The interpretation of these dots is immediate
after looking at Figure 5.13 or at the left part of Figure 5.14b: the ratio of voltages
measured with positive signs both at the dot-marked terminals is a positive number
(equal to the turns ratio); similarly, the ratio of currents supposedly entering the dot-
marked terminals is a positive value and is equal to the reciprocal turns ratio.
Whatever the signs, however, the power entering one side of an ideal transformer is
equal to the power leaving the other side. It is very important to understand that an
ideal transformer is characterised by equations which relate voltage and current at the
two sides (windings), but does not imply any relation between the voltages at the
primary and secondary side.
Therefore, they operate as a link between circuits, since, according to the
developments in Chapter 3, in a single circuit a unique potential function must be
known for the whole circuit, and the potential difference between all circuit terminals
must be determined as a difference of the values the potential function assumes in
correspondence to terminals.
The consequences of the inclusion of ideal transformers in circuits will be
discussed in the next section. The ideal transformer does not accumulate any energy,
since the power entering the primary coil is identically equal to the power leaving the
secondary one: p1(t)  p2(t).

However, we will see in Chapter 7 that a nonideal transformer in addition to
transferring energy from one of its sides to the other, accumulates a little energy in the
magnetic ﬁeld around the coils.

Systems Containing Ideal Transformers: Magnetically
Coupled Circuits
Consider a system composed of two circuital systems, connected to each other by an
ideal transformer; a very simple paradigm of this system can be seen in Figure 5.15.
Ifwesubstitute the physicalsystems at thetwo ends ofthe ideal transformer with their
circuit counterparts, we build the object represented in Figure 5.15b. What kind of object
is it? It is not a physical system, nor is it a circuit of the types encountered up to now.
Indeed, no relation exists between the potentials of terminals of the left-hand part
of the circuit and those of the right-hand part. For these “expanded circuits” the
following deﬁnitions are issued:
Definition: Magnetically coupled circuits
Two circuits, each connected to the coil of an ideal transformer, are called
magnetically coupled circuits.

More in Depth: Terminology
The terminology used in books and papers for magnetically coupled circuits tends
to vary. They are sometimes called mutually coupled circuits.
More confusing still, however, is the fact that often, in books and papers, the set of
the two circuits connected to each other by the ideal transformer is called a single
“magnetically coupled circuit.” This is to be avoided since it suggests that KVL
equations can be written for loops containing branches of both circuits, which is
not possible.
Finally, the words “network” and “circuit” are often used as synonyms. In this
book a network is a set of one or more circuits, separated from each other by ideal
transformers. A circuit, therefore, cannot contain ideal transformers.
Each of the two magnetically coupled circuits has a potential function v of its own,
and thus there is no way of determining cross voltages, that is, “differences of
potentials between two terminals.” Similarly, no current can ﬂow between the two
sides of an ideal transformer.
Therefore the following applies:
Result: Kirchhoff’s laws in magnetically coupled circuits
In a network of two magnetically coupled circuits, each of the circuits has a set of
KCL and KVL equations of its own.
Now we verify that magnetically coupled circuits allow all branch voltages and
currents to be determined, just like ordinary circuits.
Let’s ﬁrst consider the simple network shown in Figure 5.15b and again, with some
more information, in Figure 5.16.
This can be analysed by writing the loop equations of the two individual
circuits and the constitutive equations of the ideal transformer as follows (α 

Generalising this procedure, it can be shown that in networks containing magneti-
cally coupled circuits the number of linearly independent Kirchhoff equations is equal
in number to the unknowns, and therefore the network be solved.

SIMPLE R–L AND R–C TRANSIENTS
The introductory nature of this book does not allow sufﬁcient scope for the inclusion
of complex transients. However, because simple transients are given importance
elsewhere, namely in Chapter 8, they need to be dealt with here.
Consider the transient in the circuit shown in Figure 5.17, activated by closing the
ideal switch at time t  0. The equations describing the behaviour of the current are
also included in the ﬁgure. The differential equation to be solved is a ﬁrst-order,
constant-coefﬁcient linear equation of the type
y0  ay  b
(5.12)
where y is the dependent variable, x the independent variable, and the apostrophe
indicates the x derivative of y. The solution of this simple equation is

Another simple transient which is important to know even at an introductory level
is a simple R–C transient, as shown in Figure 5.19. The equation of the circuit, also
shown in Figure 5.19, has an integral form in accordance with the characteristic
equation of a capacitor, that is,

and already contains the initial condition constituted by the voltage on the capacitor at

This is due to the writing of the whole equation, instead of the usual differential form.

5.5.1
Sinusoidal Functions
By and large, the majority of applications of electricity rely on the so-called
“alternating current.” It is a rather confusing name, whose actual meaning is
“applications in which currents and voltages are sine waves.”
Indeed, the sinusoidal variation of voltages and currents over time makes the actual
behaviour of electrical systems very smooth; it therefore constitutes an ideal
behaviour very often used in applications.
A generic sinusoidal function of time, having a given frequency f and a given
angular frequency ω  2πf, has the following formulation:
xt  A sinωt  α  A sin2πf t  α
(5.14)
where
• A is the amplitude of the function.
• α is its phase angle.
Therefore, all possible sinusoidal functions of given frequency or angular fre-
quency differ from each other by their amplitude or phase angle.
They are periodic; that is, whatever the time, we have
xt  xt  T
(5.15)
where T  1/f is their period.
The validity of (5.15) can be immediately veriﬁed by substituting it into (5.14).
The meaning of period, amplitude, and phase of a sinusoidal time function are
graphically represented in Figure 5.20:

5.5.2
Steady-State Behaviour of Linear Circuits Using Phasors
In AC circuits all the sources—that is, branches having constitutive equations of the
voltage source or current source type—are sinusoids with the same frequency, which
is, therefore, the frequency of the circuit.
Consider a sinusoid, with angular frequency ω, as in equation (5.14). Its instanta-
neous value is equal to the projection of a vector, rotating counterclockwise, having its
tail constantly positioned in the origin of a pair of Cartesian axes x–y, and its
amplitude equal to the sinusoid amplitude A. This rotating vector is represented in the
x–y plane at time t  0, and is therefore called phasor (its position at t  0 clearly
indicates its phase, Figure 5.21).
It is apparent that the phasor indicates not only the value of the sine wave at the
time in which it is represented (i.e., t  0), but also the previous and subsequent times.
Figure 5.22 shows two different phasors, as well as the corresponding time
functions. Again, the rotating vectors effectively show all the functions with a single
time shot.
Thephasorcorrespondingtoasinusoidalfunctionat  A sinωt  α,accordingto
international standards, is to be indicated as A, that is, an underlined uppercase letter.
This convention is followed throughout this book. The phasor can also be represented in
amplitude and phase using one of the following graphical ways: A  Aejα  Aα.
When circuits are operating in AC, current and voltages will be sine waves. Their
KVL equations will often contain derivatives or integrals. For instance, the current
derivative is needed to solve the circuit in Figure 5.17, as expressed in the circuit

equation shown in the same ﬁgure; similarly, the integral of the capacitor current is
used to solve the circuit reported in Figure 5.19.
The time derivative and integral of a sine wave have a special form as follows:
xt  A sinωt  α ) dx
dt  ωA cosωt  α  ωA sinωt  α  π=2
∫xτ dτ   A
ω cosωt  α  C  A
ω sinωt  α  π=2  C
(5.16)
Therefore, the time derivative of a sine wave corresponds to multiplication by ω and
phase advance by π/2 radians, while the integral (here the presence of the constant C is
negligible) corresponds to division by ω and phase reduction by π/2 radians.
Is it possible to enhance our representation of sine waves by phasors so that
derivation and integration (i.e., phase shift of π/2), are easily taken into account? The
answer is yes: in mathematics an operator already exists which adds π/2 to the phase
of a vector. This is the imaginary unit j, and axes x and y would be the real and
imaginary axes of Gauss’s plane (Figure 5.23): multiplication by j corresponds to
phase advance by π/2 radians, or 90° degrees, division by j to phase reduction. If X is a
phasor representing the sine wave
xt  A sinωt  α
the derivation rule of sinusoids recalled in (5.16) becomes
dX
dt  jωX;
∫Xdt  X
jω
Because of this easy treatment of derivation and integration of sinusoidal time
functions, the preferable plane in which to represent the phasors, rather than a
generic one, is Gauss’s plane,1 and therefore the phasors are numerically represented
by complex numbers.
1In a generic Cartesian plane, no internal vector product is deﬁned: dot product gives a scalar (not a vector)
as output, while cross product gives a vector which does not belong to the original plane. On the other hand,
a product between complex numbers is deﬁned that gives as output a complex number. Therefore Gauss’s
plane can be imagined as a specialised version of a Cartesian plane, in which an internal product between
vectors is deﬁned.

Consider now a ﬁrst example of application to circuits, the one-loop circuit shown
in Figure 5.24.
The symbol of the voltage source us(t) has been integrated, as often happens, with a
sinusoid symbol ∼, in order to make explicit the sinusoidal shape of the source (cf.
Section 1.3.3). A single KVL loop equation can be written, with block constitutive
equations already taken into account:

(5.18)
where the condition that the capacitor voltage at t  0 must be equal to uC(0), as built
into equation (5.17), is explicitly added to (5.18).
From mathematics, we know that (5.18), as a linear differential equation, has a
solution with both a transient term, which vanishes with time, and a permanent term,
the only term that stays in the circuit when the transient term has become zero.
Very often in electrical engineering we are interested in the steady-state
behaviour of circuits—that is, how the circuit behaves when initial transients
have vanished.

If only the steady-state part of the solution is of interest, the term uC(0) can be
omitted from equation (5.17). Moreover, if us(t) is a sinusoid and has ω radian
frequency, the solution of the equation—that is, the current i(t)—is also a sinusoid and
has the same frequency ω.
Equation (5.17), therefore, can be written in phasor form, in which phasors
represent sinusoids with a given frequency ω. The circuit equation (5.17), without
the term uC(0), thus becomes
E  RI  L dI

is a “complex operator,” called impedance, that does not represent a phasor, just a
ratio of phasors.
The great advantage of using (5.19) for solving the circuit instead of (5.17) or
(5.18) should now be apparent: instead of solving a differential equation, only an
algebraic equation needs to be solved, albeit in the domain of complex numbers. It
must be remembered, however, that this works only in ﬁnding the steady-state
solution of the starting equation.

Is this process applicable to more complex circuits? The answer is yes: any linear
circuit—that is, a circuit with linear constitutive equations of its components (such as
those speciﬁed in Table 3.4), in which all the sources are sinusoidal functions with the
same frequency—can be treated this way.
This is a direct consequence of the fact that, as demonstrated in books on
differential equations, systems of linear differential equations, whose forcing func-
tions are sinusoids sharing the same frequency, have a steady-state solution in which
all the variables are again sinusoids with the same frequency as the forcing functions.
Since circuits with branches that have linear constitutive equations, whose sources
are all sinusoids with the same frequency, are described by systems of linear
differential equations, it can be concluded that the phasor method can also be applied
to all these circuits.
As a more complex application of the phasor analysis, consider the two-loop
circuit in Figure 5.25. Note that if a voltage source has a sinusoidal shape, this can be
reﬂected in the symbol, thus giving more graphical information, as in the example in
Figure 5.25b.

Phasor analysis of an AC circuit involves a three-step procedure:
1. The circuit is converted into its complex-plane form: the voltage and current
sources, all sinusoidal functions with a given frequency ω, are converted into
phasors using the correspondence rule in Figure 5.21, and the circuit elements
are written in their complex operator form: R–L–C elements are written as a
Z  R  j [ωL1/(ωC)].
2. The complex form of circuit equations have the same structure as DC circuits in
which, however, currents voltages and factors between voltages and currents
are complex numbers instead of real numbers. This can be solved as an ordinary
algebraic system of complex equations.

3. Once all the phasors (or all the phasors corresponding to all the required electric
quantities) are computed, they are converted back into sinusoidal functions of time.
The process is summarised in the scheme of Figure 5.26. It shows that instead of
ﬁnding the direct solution while staying in the domain of sinusoidal functions and real
parameters, it is simpler to ﬁrst transfer (“transform”) the problem into the domain of
complex numbers and then solve the problem, afterwards converting the results back
into the domain of sinusoidal functions and real parameters (“untransform”). This is
an example of a general technique used in all ﬁelds of engineering called the “use of
transformations”: the problem is ﬁrst translated into another domain, where it is much
simpler to solve, and then the result is untransformed.

The two choices are almost exactly equivalent. When solving a circuit with a
single source containing all functions expressed as sinusoids—for example, of the
type x(t)  X sin (ωt  α)—the correspondence (°) is the more immediate, since it
does not require conversion of a sine into a cosine; vice versa, the correspondence
(°°) is more immediate if all the source functions are expressed as cosinusoids—for
example, are of the type x(t)  X cos (ωt  α).
Some books adopt the correspondence (°), others (°°), while others suggest
adopting one or another on a case-by-case basis. In the examples developed in
this book, the correspondence (°) is used.

AC Circuit Passive Parameters
The concept of impedance was introduced in the previous section; this is the ratio of
voltage to current phasors measured at the ends of any circuit branch as follows:
+
U
I
–
ZI
U =
(5:20)
where the complex number:
Z  R  jX  Zejφ
impedance across voltage U, is a complex operator, that is, a ratio of phasors.
Since the impedance is not a phasor it cannot be converted into a sine wave. Its
modulus Z is the ratio of moduli of U and I, while its phase angle φ is the phase
difference between them: the phase angle of U is the phase angle of I plus φ.
Because of its importance, the imaginary part of Z has a symbol and name of its
own: it is normally represented by the symbol X (or x) and called reactance. Reactance
is a factor describing the behaviour of inductors or capacitors and has a value which is
respectively positive or negative:
• Inductor with inductance L ) XL  ωL
• Capacitor with capacitance C ) XC  1/(ωC)
The reactance of a generic passive branch may be positive or negative, depending
on whether the prevailing effect is that of inductive or capacitive parts.
The ratio of current to voltage is often of interest and has a new symbol and name:
I  YU;
Y  G  jB  Yejφ  1=Z
where, for the branch in question,
AC CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
163

• Y, the ratio of current to voltage phasors, is a complex number called
admittance;
• G, the real part of Y, is called conductance (in the case of real impedance, i.e.
with zero imaginary part, it coincides with the reciprocal of the resistance);
• B, the imaginary part of Y, is called susceptance.
Since the phase angle of the admittance is the opposite of the phase angle φ of the
impedance of the same branch, when the reactance of a branch is positive, the
corresponding susceptance is negative, and vice versa.
Often the impedance parameters are represented as a triangle, shown here, called
“triangle of impedance”. It is useful to ﬁnd ratios between quantities, such as X/Z 
sin φ or X/R  tan φ.

The Phasor Circuit
Consider again Figure 5.25. It contains Figure 5.25a, showing a circuit in which
voltages and currents are sine waves, and Figure 5.25b, in which they are phasors. The
latter is called phasor circuit. It is structurally identical to the original one; just the
quantities are complex numbers (i.e., phasors) instead of time functions.
The introduction of complex impedance Z enables the writing phasor circuits in a
more compact way: series of resistors, inductors, and/or capacitors are thought of as
single entities, which correspond to circuit impedances.
For instance, the circuit in Figure 5.25a can be drawn as indicated in Figure 5.27.
Circuits represented using the impedance symbol for components containing
resistors, inductors and capacitors are called phasor circuits. They are structurally
similar to DC circuits: instead of constant real quantities, however, constant complex
quantities are used.
Phasor diagrams of different circuits are shown in Figure 5.28. To draw the
diagrams, it is important to pay due attention to the reference signs in the circuit. In
the case, for instance, of the central diagrams of Figure 5.28, referring to R–L loads,
Z 1 = –j /(ωC) 
Z 2 = R2+jωL

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

the current was assumed to have two opposite reference directions. Two opposite
values of current correspond (i.e., I0  I), and the corresponding phasor diagrams
must be changed accordingly, as shown in the ﬁgure.
If the load is composed of a pure reactance (i.e., its resistance is zero), the phase
displacement between current and voltage phasors is 90 degrees. The current lags the
voltage if the reactance is positive (it is constituted by an inductor), while it leads the
voltage if the reactance is constituted by a capacitor, and therefore is negative.
In the case of a generic R–X load, the angle between voltage and current phasors
(voltage angle minus current angle), when the current is assumed to be entering the
load from the positively marked terminal, is between 90° and 90°. Negative values
refer to negative reactances.
Finally, R–L–C load is taken into account. As seen from the voltage source, it
behaves in a way that could be R–L-like or R–C-like in ωL > 1/(ωC) or ωL < 1/(ωC),
respectively—that is, whether the effects of inductance prevail over the effects of the
capacitor or vice versa.
Phasor circuits also effectively describe circuits containing mutually coupled induc-
tive elements. In fact, the mathematical behaviour of any time-varying circuit in which

thebrancheshaveconstitutiveequationsofthetypesshowninTable3.4 isdescribedbya
systemof lineardifferentialequations.Should all the sources besinusoidal with thesame
frequency, the solution of this system is composed entirely of sinusoidal quantities
(voltages and currents) and therefore the phasor circuit can be used.
An example of a circuit containing an ideal transformer (two mutually coupled
inductors) is shown in Figure 5.29, along with its phasor circuit.
Phasor circuits can be seen as circuits having branches with constitutive equations
expressed as complex numbers. The only equations of interest are those seen in Table 5.1.
Note that the presence of the component ideal transformer, which does not exist in DC,
requires a special row which is not a constitutive equation of a branch; this can be
imagined to be a system of constitutive equations of a four-terminal circuit element.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

Because of its great similarity to DC circuits (see Table 3.4: the only structural
difference, in addition to the use of complex numbers instead of real numbers, is the
presence of ideal transformers), nearly all the formal results obtained in Chapter 4 for DC
circuits can be replicated in AC circuits, studied using phasors and complex impedances.
Here they are shown for clarity’s sake.
Nodal Analysis.
Nodal analysis can be applied to AC circuits exactly in the same way
as in DC circuits, except for the use of complex variables. For instance, the circuit in
Figure 5.27 can be solved using a unique equation, written using nodal analysis:
U A  U N
Z 1
 U B  U N
Z 2
 U N
Z 3
whose unique unknown is voltage UN.
Series, Parallel, and Star/Delta Conversion of Impedances.
The formulas seen in
Chapter 3 for resistor conversions are immediately extended to AC circuits, simply by
substituting resistances with impedances:
• Equivalent impedance of n impedances in series: Z eqs  Z 1  Z 2  ∙∙∙ Z n
• Equivalent impedance of two impedances in parallel: Z eqp 
Z 1Z 2

Finally, it is to be noted that since any phasor circuit is described by linear-
algebraic (though complex) equations, linearity applies, then superposition and
Thévenin’s theorem also apply.
Voltage and Current Division.
Again, the formulas found in Chapter 4 are
immediately extended to AC circuits substituting resistances with impedances:
• Voltage division. Consider the following impedances in series: Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn.
The ratio of the voltage applied to any of the individual branches to the total
voltage applied to the series is
U k
U eqs
 Z k I
Z eqs I  Z k

(5.21)
• Current division. Consider branches in parallel with impedances Z1, Z2, . . . ,

5.5.5
Circuits Containing Sources with Different Frequencies
In Section 5.5.2 we stated that the phasor circuit concept can be used only when all the
sources are sinusoidal functions sharing the same frequency.
AC CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
169

It often happens in practice, however, that circuits contain sources with
different frequencies, or else some sources are constant while other are sinusoids.
This case will be treated in this book only for linear systems, for which
superposition applies.
Superposition was dealt with in Chapter 3, in which it was shown that when the
branches are either known voltages (constant or variable) or known currents (constant
or variable), or are characterised by a linear relation between voltage and current, the
circuit can be solved by applying the different known voltages and currents in
sequence and then summing the results.
The process is exempliﬁed using the example in Figure 5.30.
The solution of the circuit shown on the left-hand side of the ﬁgure can be found by
solving the three circuits on the right side and then summing all the electrical
quantities. Just as an example, it can be said that uA(t)  uA0(t)  uA00(t)  UA000,
iA(t)  iA0(t)  iA00(t)  IA000.
Naturally, uA0(t) and iA0(t) can be found using the phasor circuit at frequency f1,
uA00(t) and iA00(t) can be found using the phasor circuit at frequency f2 6 f1, and UA000
and IA000 can be found using the solving techniques of DC circuits. It is important to
remember that phasors computed in the circuit operating at frequency f1 cannot
be summed to phasors computed in the circuit operating at f2: the sum can only be
done when the phasor circuit solutions have already been converted into time
functions.

This function of time is called the “instantaneous power” absorbed by the resistor.
This instantaneous power is composed of an average value and a ﬂuctuating term
around it, as shown in Figure 5.31.
For the majority of applications, it is sufﬁcient to consider the average value of p(t).
Take, for instance, a home heater. The fact that heat is produced at a rapidly variable
speed (with periodical cycling every 10 ms for a standard 50-Hz frequency, or 8.33 ms
for a frequency of 60 Hz) is of no practical signiﬁcance: the user feels only the average
of this power. The same applies for the light of an incandescence bulb: luminance
ﬂuctuations are very small due to the thermal inertia of the bulb ﬁlament and are
hardly discerned by the human eye.
Therefore, the time average of the instantaneous power transferred to the resistor
has a name and a symbol of its own: it is called power (without any attributes) and its
symbol is an uppercase P:

(5.23)
The quantity I, uppercase and without any additional sign, is called root mean square
(rms) of i(t).
The rms value of a generic periodic quantity x(t)—that is, a function x(t) having the
characteristic that x(t)  x(t  T), where t is any generic time and T is a ﬁxed
quantity—is deﬁned as

because the integral extended to the period T of the quantity cos(2ωt  α) which is
periodic with a period T/2 is zero.
The expression P  RI2 of the (average) power absorbed by resistor R is exactly the
same as that which applies to DC circuits. This justiﬁes the deﬁnition adopted for the
rms value of the current: it is the value of a constant current that has the same thermal
effect of the actual i(t) which is sinusoid in shape.
The equation (5.23) can now be written as follows:

Therefore, the instantaneous power transferred to the inductor has a null average, and
this is coherent with the fact, demonstrated in Section 5.2.3, that it is a storage
component that stores energy whenever the absolute value of current rises, and
delivers it back whenever it reduces.

force), it can be considered to be equivalent to an impedance Zeq  R  jX. In this
case, angle φ is the characteristic angle of the impedance Zeq and it is

in which P is the power absorbed by the real part R of Z eq—that is, since
reactors absorb no active power by the whole Z eq. In turn, Q is the reactive power
absorbed by the reactor X—that is, since resistors absorb no reactive power by the
whole Z eq.
It can be concluded that, at least when the receiving network is passive, this is
P  UI cos φ;
Q  UI sin φ
(5.24)
It could be easily seen that also in the more general case of a generic (active or passive)
receiving network, identities (5.24) apply.
Result: Active and reactive power
When two subnetworks A and B are connected to each other by a pair of wires,
the active and reactive powers going from A to B are P  UI cos φ and
Q  UI sin φ, where U and I are the rms values of voltage and current exchanged
(I entering B through the positively marked terminal), and φ is the phase
difference between voltage and current phasors, measured positive when current
lags voltage.
The term cos φ reduces the power transferred with the maximum available when
instantaneous voltage and current are proportional to each other, or, equivalently,
voltage and current phasors have the same phase.
The quantity cos φ is of sufﬁcient importance to merit a name of its own: it is called
power factor. The importance for power factors to be near unity will be discussed in
Section 5.6.4.
Note that angle φ is, by deﬁnition, the difference between phase angle of voltage
phasor and phase angle of current phasor. A rapid look at Figure 5.32 immediately
tells us that this angle can be either positive (e.g., in the case of an R–L load) or
POWER IN AC CIRCUITS
175

negative (e.g., for an R–C load). Two opposite values of φ imply the same power
factor, but a different positioning of phasors. Because of its importance, speciﬁc terms
are used to avoid ambiguity. These terms refer to the position of current phasor with
respect to voltage phasor: the power factor is said to be lagging when current lags
voltage (and φ is positive), but leading when current leads voltage. For instance, in
the situation represented in Figure 5.32 there is a lagging power factor. In circuits
feeding R–C loads the power factor is of the leading type. This is remembered in the
following box:
Definition: leading and lagging power factor
If the difference between voltage phasor angle and current phasor angle is called φ,
the power factor is, by deﬁnition, f  cos φ.
A power factor is said to be leading when the current phasor leads the voltage
phasor (the angle φ is negative) and lagging in the opposite situation (the angle φ is
positive).
Note that we refer to the power factor of a load. When we consider the U–I couple to
determine the displacement angle φ, we consider that it is deﬁned with reference to the
load with the load sign convention (see Section 3.5.2)—that is, with I assumed to be
entering the positively marked load terminal. This is important in order to evaluate
whether the power factor is leading or lagging.
When a phasor circuit is solved, phasors of voltages and currents are computed. It
is very important to also have active and reactive powers expressed in terms of these
phasors, using minimal computations. This is easily done by using the concept of
complex power. The complex power S, ﬂowing through a pair of wires, is deﬁned as
half the product of the phasor of voltage across the wires and the conjugate of the
phasor of the ﬂowing current:

In some books, phasors are deﬁned as having amplitudes equal to the rms values of
the corresponding sine waves, instead of their peak values. In other books, peak-
oriented phasors are used ﬁrst and then, after the introduction of AC power, rms-
oriented ones.
The latter is the preferred choice in courses for electrical engineering students, since it
makes computations somewhat easier. In this book, for the sake of the greatest simplicity
and clarity, just peak-oriented phasors—that is, phasors whose amplitude is equal to the
peak of the corresponding wave—are used.

Therefore, in its real and imaginary parts respectively, complex power contains
active and reactive powers, and therefore it summarises them in a unique complex
number.
The modulus of complex power,

is called apparent power.
All the “powers” considered in this section—active, reactive, complex, and
apparent—are homogeneous with physical power and should in principle be meas-
ured in the unit of measure of power (i.e., watt) in the S.I.
However, it appears slightly confusing to attribute the same unit of measure to Ps,
which are really powers in terms of derivative of energy ﬂows, and Qs, which have
a totally different deﬁnition; these have a conservation law of their own (see Sec-
tion 5.6.3), but are never obtainable by conversion of real power. Apparent power is
even trickier, since no conservation law applies to it. The latter statement will be clear
once Section 5.6.3 has been read.
By international convention, therefore, the following units of measure have to be
used (care should be taken with uppercase and lowercase letters and with roman and

Circuits Containing Sources Having Different Frequencies
It was shown earlier that the solution to linear circuits containing different frequencies
can be found using superposition.
Once the current i(t) and voltage u(t) entering a branch are found—that is, measured
using the load convention (current entering the positively marked terminal)—the
instantaneous power entering that branch will obviously be

whose shape will depend on the shapes of u(t) and i(t), but will be periodic, in the sense
that it will replicate itself after a period T.2
Itisthereforeusefultocomputetheaveragevalueofp(t)overtheperiodT.Thisaverage
will be referred to, in a manner similar to the case of AC circuits, with the symbol P:

(5.25)
The instant t in (5.25) is arbitrary since, given the periodic nature of p(t), the integral in
this equation does not depend on the instant t.
By expressing both u(t) and i(t) as the sum of contributions at different frequencies
(see Section 5.5.5), it is possible to demonstrate that P simply equals the sum of active
powers calculated at each frequency separately:

In fact, each term uj(t)ik(t), j 6 k, has a null average, since it represents the product
between two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies.
In other terms, the mutual interaction between voltages and currents at different
frequencies affects p(t), but adds nothing to P.
Reactive power has much less importance in periodic, nonsinusoidal circuits and
will not be dealt with in this book.
5.6.3
Conservation of Complex, Active, and Reactive Powers
In the previous section the reactive power in an AC circuit was deﬁned in a mathematical
way, as the peak value of the alternating instantaneous power ﬂowing through a reactive
element, specifying that reactive power absorbed by a reactor is the same as its reactance.
This, however, in no way justiﬁes the use of the word power in its name. The real
importance and usefulness of reactive power comes from Boucherot’s theorem, which
can be very rapidly derived as an application of Tellegen’s theorem.3
In Section 3.8.1,Tellegen’s theorem was stated as follows. Consider a generic circuit.
If
• {v0, v1, . . . , vn} is a set of potential values for the circuit node, satisfying KVL
for the circuit in question;
• {i01, i02, . . . i0n, . . . i12, i13, . . . i1n, . . . i1n-1,n, i1n} is a set of currents ﬂowing
in the circuit branches (from the ﬁrst to the second node) satisfying KCL for the
circuit in question,
2More information about periodic waveforms and how they are to be treated in circuits will be given in Chapter 8.
3The theorem is named after Paul, Boucherot, who ﬁrst discovered and demonstrated it. Later, Tellegen’s
theorem made it faster to demonstrate.

In this chapter the phasors circuit was introduced, showing that Kirchhoff’s equations
can be written directly in terms of phasors.
Since (5.26) is a direct consequence of Kirchhoff’s laws, and Kirchhoff’s laws
apply to phasors in the phasor circuit, it can also be written in phasor form:
X
U ij I ij  0
Consider that if a given set of phasor currents,

(5.27)
Result (5.27) shows the conservation of active power in a circuit, which is also a fairly
obvious consequence of the conservation of instantaneous power, plus the conservation
of reactivepower. The conservationof reactive power in circuits is a very importantlaw.
It allows conservation techniques to be applied in circuit analysis: for example, if the
Q absorbed by some of the branches is known or computed, this equals the Q globally
delivered by the set of the remaining branches. This is summarised as follows:
Law: Power conservation in AC circuits
This law can be expressed in one of the following equivalent formulations:
1. In any AC circuit, the sum of complex power values absorbed by all its
branches is identically null.
2. In any AC circuit, the sum of active power values absorbed by all its branches
and the sum of reactive power values absorbed by all its branches are
identically null.
POWER IN AC CIRCUITS
179

Note that the fact that the sum of all complex Sk is zero does not imply that the sum
of their moduli is zero, and in fact this is not generally true.
The conservation of reactive power [second of equations (5.27)] in a circuit is often
called Boucherot’s theorem.

5.6.4
Power Factor Correction
Consider the system represented in Figure 5.33. It contains an ideal AC
generator—that is, a device which produces at its terminals a perfectly sinus-
oidal voltage and feeds through conductor wires a linear, passive system which
operates as a load. Under the hypotheses, normally satisﬁed, that displacement
currents and self-induced voltage are negligible between wires, this system
can be represented by the equivalent circuit shown in the central part of the
ﬁgure.
Should only the steady-state behaviour be of interest, the load can be represented
by its Thévenin equivalent which in our case, since the load is passive, is reduced to
the simple impedance Zeq. The line wires are modelled through resistors Rlu and Rld
(bottom part of Figure 5.33).
In general it is not known whether the reactive part of Zeq is positive or negative,
although in the large majority of cases it is positive. In Figure 5.34, it is modelled as
positive, and therefore Zeq can be represented as an equivalent series Req–Leq. The
sum of Rlu and Rld is reported as a single resistor, named R0.

TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING AC CIRCUITS

Firstly, consider the circuit in Figure 5.34a, in which the switch T is open (i.e.,
no current can ﬂow through it). In this case, the phasor diagram is of the type
shown alongside the same ﬁgure. It is clearly seen that the current I 0 ﬂowing
through the line, and causing a net power loss equal to R0 I0
2, is composed of a
part which is in phase with the user voltage U, and a part that is in quadrature4
with it.
4In electrical engineering, to be “in quadrature” means having a phase difference of 90°.

While the component in phase is associated with a ﬂow of active power, the one in
quadrature can be generated locally by a capacitor, since capacitors absorb currents in
quadrature leading the voltage phasor, which can offset the quadrature component of
the Zeq current.
The concept is illustrated in Figure 5.34b, which considers the steady-state circuit
operation when switch T is closed. Now the line transfers only the part of the load
current in phase with the voltage. Naturally, this implies an advantage in terms of
power lost in the line, since the modulus of I0 is reduced. The reduction can be
substantial, as in the case shown in the ﬁgure, when the initial phase difference
between load voltage and current (i.e., the characteristic angle of the impedance Zeq)
is large (around 90°).
The quantity cos φ, as discussed in Section 5.6.1, is the power factor of the load.
The closer the power factor of a load gets to unity, the more effectively the power can
be transferred to it. Which is why, when the power factor is too small (e.g., below 0.8),
it might be advisable to correct it by bringing it nearer to unity.
The example of Figure 5.34 shows that this can be done by absorbing, in the
vicinity of the load, a current that is the same size (or nearly) as the quadrature
component of the load current, and opposite in phase. Since, as already noted, typical
loads have positive φ angles, this operation normally requires placing a capacitor with
suitable capacity in parallel to the load.
The operation of installing a reactive component near the load, which is able to
eliminate, or at least strongly reduce, the phase difference between the voltage applied
to the load and the current that it absorbs, is called power factor correction. Should the
displacement be reduced to zero, the correction is total, otherwise it is partial.
Let us now compute the value of the capacitance of the capacitor which has to
perform a total power factor correction. The formula can be derived by reasoning in
terms of powers: the reactive power delivered by the correcting capacitor must match
the reactive power absorbed by the R–L load,
QabsorbedZeq  UI1 sinφeq  U2

When a total power factor correction is carried out, the line feeding the parallel of Zeq
and C “sees” a load that absorbs a current that is in phase with the voltage—that is, an
impedance having null ( zero) reactance or, equivalently, a pure resistor.
The reader can verify this by computing the equivalent impedance of Zeq and
ZC  j/(ωC).

Short Biography of Boucherot
Paul Boucherot (1869–1943) was an electrical engineer, known for several important
studies in the ﬁeld of electrical engineering.
In circuit theory, he introduced the distinction of active, reactive, and apparent
power and demonstrated the theorem that today carries his name (discussed in
Section 5.6.3).
In the ﬁeld of electrical machines, he carried out important studies on asynchro-
nous motors, thus contributing greatly to their increased use.
In power system engineering, he built an innovative power station able to exploit
the ocean’s thermal energy.

THREE-PHASE CIRCUITS
For the Instructor
In this chapter, consistently with the approach adopted in Chapter 5, the three-
phase system is introduced by initially modelling the lines connecting generators
and loads as purely resistive branches; that is, we ignore cross conduction between
wires (both conductive and displacement currents) as well as the effect of EMF
induced in meshes containing the lines due to the alternating current circulating in
the line conductors.
The inductive effects are introduced later, even though it is remarked that in low
voltage lines, line reactances are normally negligible in comparison to resistances.
Details on transmission line issues when they are modelled as circuits are included
in the Appendix.

INTRODUCTION
Every reader of this book has surely seen overhead high-voltage transmission lines,
such as the ones depicted in Figure 6.1. It can be seen from the pictures that energy is
transferred using three-wire lines: the left-hand pole has three wires, the right-hand

tower holds four, but the highest wire just has the purpose of protecting the line from
lightning and does not contribute to carrying electric energy. This is highly visible
evidence of the fact that electric energy is used and transferred, when power surpasses
a few kilowatts, by means of so-called three-phase systems that are based on three
wires for transferring electric power.
This chapter shows the genesis of three-phase lines and systems and provides
information on how to make computations with these systems in the particularly
important (and easy) case of balanced three-phase systems.

FROM SINGLE-PHASE TO THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
Imagine we want to feed three load impedances Z u by means of a voltage source,
situated relatively far from the load, at distance d (Figure 6.2a). The electrical
behaviour of this system, if induced EMF between wires is negligible, can be
analysed as represented in Figure 6.2b.

THREE-PHASE CIRCUITS

Consider that the total load requires a power S  P  jQ to be delivered at a voltage
Uu  U (1). The current ﬂowing through the line is I  S/U  3Iu and the power lost
through the line is
Pjl  2RlI2  2Rl3Iu2  2 ? 9RlI2

Now we will show a technique that allows the same power to be transferred under the
same voltage to the three loads while reducing the line losses, if the quantity of copper
for the lines is the same, or reducing the quantity of copper involved, at equal line losses.
Consider the arrangement shown in Figure 6.3. The three voltage sources have
equal amplitudes, and they are displaced in phase with each other by 2π/3 rad. Such
sets of voltages are called balanced three-phase sets of voltages. It will be shown in
the next chapter that these sets are very easily created by means of electrical machines.
The amplitude of voltages applied to single load impedances will have to be the
same as U u in the scheme of Figure 6.2.
This implies that the voltage sources U sa, U sb, U sc are equal in amplitude to U u

as will be demonstrated later.
The load impedances, as all sets of three equal impedances, is called a balanced
three-phase load.
Figure 6.3b shows a circuit modelling the system of Figure 6.3a, valid if induced
EMFs between wires are negligible. Using this arrangement, it can be easily
demonstrated that the three loads are fed with the same active and reactive power
as the arrangement of Figure 6.2, but with reduced losses in the lines.
Consider Figure 6.4. The left part of the ﬁgure shows the balanced set of voltage
composed of U sa, U sb, U sc, as well as the voltages between wires at the source
terminals, that are determined using the usual rule for vector differences (Figure 6.4a);
the voltages between the corresponding phases at the load terminals (indicated in
ﬁgures with uppercase subscripts) will be similar to them, and they are shown with a

common tail in Figure 6.4b. Considering that, by hypothesis, the three load imped-
ances are equal to each other, the currents absorbed by the three loads will have the
same amplitudes and phase displacements with respect to the corresponding voltages.
Therefore, they will be of the type shown in Figure 6.4b. Considering KCL at nodes
A, B, C, the corresponding line currents are found by the difference of the currents
ﬂowing in the load impedances, and they will be of the type shown in Figure 6.4b for
the ﬁrst wire (I a). The amplitudes of the line currents will therefore be equal to those
of load currents, multiplied by

The ratio of the two powers is therefore

which demonstrates that the transmission of electric power shown in Figure 6.3, called
three-phase transmission, is more effective than single-phase transmission).2 Natu-
rally, if the power loss is required to be unchanged, the total copper used for the three-
phase transmission can be reduced. In this case, instead of having a reduction in power
loss, we would have a reduction in line cost.
Another very important advantage of three-phase systems is the fact that,
differently from single-phase transmission, the instantaneous power delivered by

2The analysis carried out considered only the amount of copper at equal line-to-line voltages. A more
detailed analysis should also have considered the cost of insulating three wires from each other instead of
two. However, it can be seen that even with this more detailed analysis, the advantages of three-phase
transmission remain sound.

three-phase generators and transferred to three-phase loads is constant. This will be
demonstrated in the next section.
The three load impedances discussed earlier were connected between the line wires,
forming a triangle (“delta connection”). This was because equality of the voltage at the
load terminals was required to compare with the single-phase transmission.
Consider now the diagram in Figure 6.5. In this case the load is constituted by three
“star-connected” impedances.3
As usual, the left-hand part of the ﬁgure represents a physical system whose
mathematical model is the circuit in the right-hand part of the ﬁgure.
This circuit, as any three-phase circuit, can be studied using the usual rules for
solving AC circuits. In particular, nodal analysis can be used, assuming that the
reference node is O. The following equation can thus be written:
U sa  V N
Rl  Z a
 U sb  V N
Rl  Z b
 U sc  V N
Rl  Z c
 0
or
U sa  U sb  U sc
Rl  Z
 3 V N
Rl  Z
(°)
It must now be observed that any balanced three-phase set of quantities (voltages,
currents) sums to zero, as can be immediately inferred from the diagram shown here,
evidently:

As a consequence, equation (°) yields
0  3 V N
Rl  Z ) V N  0
This shows that, in the circuit of Figure 6.5, nodes O and N have the same potential.
Points O and N are called star centres or neutral points of the three-phase system.
It is easy to convince ourselves that this is a rather general conclusion:
Result: Potential of neutral points in three-phase balanced systems
In a three-phase system fed by a balanced set of voltages, if all the impedances
present in the three phases are equal to each other, all the neutral points of the star-
connected impedances and voltage sources share the same potential.
Therefore, entire three-phase networks can be built, where several three-phase
loads might be present—for example, constituted by star- or delta-connected imped-
ances. In the case of balanced networks, in which the impedances present in the three
phases are equal to each other and the sources are all constituted by balanced three-
phase sets, all the star centres have the same potential.
In the example of Figure 6.6, for instance, this common potential is
V N1  V N2  V N3  V O. When impedances are delta-connected, they can be
replaced by three star-connected equivalents. The star-delta conversion formulas
are the same as those used in Chapter 5 for generic AC circuits. In the case considered
here, where impedances are equal to each other, such formulas become simply

where Z Δ and Z λ are respectively the delta-connected and the star-connected
impedances.
It is apparent that when large balanced three-phase networks are to be represented,
it is superﬂuous to always replicate circuit parameters for the three phases. Therefore,
very often in these cases, we resort to the uniﬁlar representation, such as that shown in
Figure 6.6b, where a single line is shown to indicate three elements by the use of three
small slanting lines: ///. Three-phase systems are characterised by two kinds of
voltages: line-to-line and line-to-neutral voltages.
Line-to-line voltages can be measured between two of the three wires, while line-
to-neutral are the voltages between lines and the neutral point. Both are normally
expressed as rms values.
There is always a very simple and important relation between line and phase
voltages of a three-phase system:

The same relationship applies to rms values that are amplitudes divided by

p
.
The duality of line and phase voltages is so important that it is very common for
three-phase systems to be named after two numbers, representing the two
voltages.
For instance, in European Union countries the voltage used for distributing energy
to users needing slightly more power than for domestic use homes is the following:
400=230 V
The ﬁrst number represents the line-to-line nominal voltage of this system, while the
second one represents the phase voltage. Note that the ratio between the two is only
approximately
ﬃﬃﬃ
3
p
; this was chosen to avoid decimal numbers in the representation of
any of the two nominal values.
When a three-phase system is named using just a single value, it always refers
to the rms value of the line-to-line voltages; for instances some standard voltage
levels are 10 kV, 15 kV, 20 kV, 130 kV, and 220 kV. All these values are line rms
voltages.

6.2.1
Modelling Three-Phase Lines When Induced EMFs Between Wires
Are Not Negligible
Consider again the system in Figure 6.5a. Let us now discuss what happens when the
EMFs between wires are not negligible.
To understand the situation, we consider a three-phase wire of the line such as that
shown in Figure 6.7a. There are ﬂuxes linked with the three different meshes
constituted by the different pairs of conductors. The following equations can be
written, in general, for time-varying functions (left) and for phasors (right):
usab  uab  Raia  Rbib  dϕab

usbc  ubc  Rbib  Rcic  dϕbc

U sbc  U bc  RbI b  RcI c  dΦ bc

In this book we only consider balanced three-phase systems. They are fed by
balanced sets of voltages, and loaded by balanced loads. Similarly, we assume that
the three conductors have the same resistances and that the rectangular areas
between conductors a–b, b–c, c–a, are equal to each other.4 It will constitute a
three-phase balanced line.
Consider now a three-phase system of voltages (phase voltages U sa, U sb, U sc)
feeding a balanced load (equal impedances Z ld) through a balanced line (resistance

U sa  U a  U sa  Z ldI a  Rln I a  jωLln I a
U sb  U b  Usb  Z ldI b  Rln I b  jωLln I b
U sc  U c  U sc  Z ldI c  Rln I c  jωLln I c
The parameter Lln is a function of line geometry and is called line inductance.
The system can therefore be studied by the metacircuit5 shown in Figure 6.8.
The line inductance can be expressed as
Lln  kl ln d
krr
(6.2)
where l is the line length, d is the distance between two conductors of the line, r is their
radius, and k and kr are constant values. More details on the value of Lln are not
supplied here, because they are well beyond the scope of this book and because even
electrical engineers tend to read about them in manuals rather than compute them
directly. Equation (6.2) is given just to show that Lln is proportional to the line length,
increases when d increases, and decreases when r increases; the dependence on d and
r is a logarithmic one.
As a ﬁnal comment on this section, it is worthwhile noticing that in low voltage
lines (up to 1 kV), inductances Lln are very small and designers very often ignore
them. In other terms, at the usual frequency, in low voltage lines it can often be
assumed that ωLln  Rln. Only in the case of very large LV cables, having a cross
section of copper larger than 95 square millimetres, Lln has some importance.
On the other hand, in medium voltage lines (say between 1 and 35 kV)6 this line
inductance becomes important, and the corresponding reactance Xln  ωLln usually
reaches the same order of magnitude of line resistances Rln.
When much higher voltage lines are considered line reactances tend to become
dominant with respect to line resistances.

6The threshold of 35 kV has been set here because it is considered in the International Standard IEC 60038.
Individual countries might have slightly different thresholds; for instance, in Italy this value is set to 30 kV.

6.3
THE SINGLE-PHASE EQUIVALENT
OF THE THREE-PHASE CIRCUIT
As we saw in the previous chapter, in a balanced three-phase system whatever occurs in
phase a also occurs in phase b, only with a phase lag of 120°; it then occurs in phase c,
with another phase lag of 120°.
Thus, in order to understand the full behaviour of the three-phase system, it is
sufﬁcient to evaluate what happens in one of the three phases: all voltages and current
phasors in the other phases will have the same amplitudes and will just be rotated
counterclockwise by 120 or 240 degrees.
By convention, the phase considered is the ﬁrst of the three: phase a, if phases are
named a, b, c; phase 1 if they are named 1, 2, 3; phase r if the naming convention
dictates r, s, t. The circuit constituted by only the ﬁrst phase of a three-phase system is
called the single-phase equivalent of the three-phase circuit.
Just to make this approach more explicit, consider again the circuit shown in
Figure 6.6. Its behaviour can be easily evaluated by referring to the single-phase
equivalent shown in Figure 6.9. The process for determining the single-phase
equivalent of a three-phase circuit should now be clear: since the potential of all
neutral points are the same, they are connected to each other, creating the lower
common node of the circuit. The upper nodes of the single equivalent represent the
corresponding nodes in phase a of the three-phase circuit. To make things clearer, in
both ﬁgures voltage U 2a and current I 2a are shown.
The same process can be used when EMFs between wires of transmission lines are
not negligible. For instance, the metacircuit shown in Figure 6.8 can be studied by its
single-phase equivalent, inFigure6.10.Thecurrentsandvoltages ﬂowingin this single-
phase equivalent are the ones ﬂowing in conductor a of the actual three-phase system.

POWER IN THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
First of all consider a generic circuital system constituted by two parts, connected to
each other by means of several wires, and the corresponding circuit (Figure 6.11a).
The charges ﬂowing through the wires are moved by the electric ﬁeld present
inside the conductor, whose potential values, written with reference to node O, are

v1(t), v2(t), v3(t) (the two circuit sections are imagined to be so near to each other
that the potentials of all points of the lower conductor are assumed to be equal to
each other).
Therefore, the work that the electric ﬁeld does inside the conductors onto the
charges ﬂowing in the conductors is

With the signs assumed in Figure 6.11, the electric ﬁelds inside the conductors
transfer energy into the charges assumed to be moving from the left to the right part of
the system. Therefore, this energy is assumed to be generated at the left part and
received (absorbed) at the right part. This justiﬁes the reference signs assumed for p(t)
in the same ﬁgure.
Consider now the three-phase circuit shown in Figure 6.5 and Figure 6.12, where
the three loads are generic linear boxes, and the electric quantities are indicated as time
functions. Since the voltage sources are sinusoidal, also the currents are sinusoidal;
since the three loads are equal (they share the same constitutive equation u  f(i)) and
the three voltage sources constitute a three-phase balanced system, the currents also
constitute a three-phase balanced system.
Similar to the process in Chapters 4 and 5, we can evaluate the power p(t)
transferred across the curved line of Figure 6.12.
The charges ﬂowing through the three phases are moved by the electric ﬁeld
present inside the conductor, whose potential values, written with reference to node
O, are v1(t), v2(t), v3(t).

THREE-PHASE CIRCUITS

Equation (6.4) is a very important result:
Result: Instantaneous power in three-phase balanced systems
The instantaneous power ﬂowing in three-phase balanced systems is constant over
time and is expressed by the simple formula (6.4).
This is different from what happens in single-phase circuits and is therefore another
big advantage of three-phase over single-phase circuits.
It will be seen in the next chapters that this implies a very uniform transfer of power
to mechanical shafts when three-phase machines are involved, since when the
machine shafts rotate at constant speed, they receive constant torque, therefore
with no vibration induced.
As far as active, reactive and apparent powers are concerned, their values can
be obtained trivially considering that a three-phase phasor circuit is still an AC
circuit:

b U cI *c=2; S3ph  3UI
(6.5)
It is again remembered that in (6.5), U is the rms value of the line-to-neutral voltages.

line-to-line voltage Ul. From the fundamental relation Ul 

Remembering that the three-phase powers can be obtained by multiplying by 3 the
powers calculated in the single-phase circuit, we obtain

SINGLE-PHASE FEEDING FROM THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
In Part IV of this book, there will be a description of how practical power systems are
designed and built. The analysis of these systems makes use of circuit knowledge
acquired in this part.
It is worthwhile, at this point, to examine the general usage of three-phase and
single-phase AC systems.
It was already mentioned at the beginning of this chapter that large power systems
are three-phase, and the rationale behind this was also discussed. However, inside
houses and homes it is much more common to ﬁnd electricity distributed through just
two wires—that is, single-phase AC. This is a natural consequence of the fact that the
lower powers of low-voltage installations do not justify the adoption of the more
complex three-phase structure for the installation themselves.
206
THREE-PHASE CIRCUITS

How do we generate single-phase systems from three-phase systems? It must be
remembered here that the domestic installations are supplied by low-voltage systems.
The low-voltage supply comes from MV/LV transformers.
A very basic discussion of what transformers are has been made in Section 1.1; a more
detailed idea of transformers was introduced in Chapter 5, where ideal transformers were
dealt with. More comprehensive analysis of this subject is in Chapter 7.
Finally, more information about the structure of power systems and why MV/LV
transformers are needed is discussed in Chapter 15.
It is often in this transformer that the generation of single-phase systems from a
three-phase system occurs.
This is explained in Figures 6.13 and 6.14 in the two most widely used cases. Here,
just for graphical simplicity, wires are indicated by unique lines, but these ﬁgures
represent physical systems, not circuits. So, the line named “conductor a” is a real
conductor, with its own conductor material and insulation, resistance, and so on.
The three-phase transformer is constituted by mutually coupled windings: for instance,
the secondary winding s1 is mutually coupled with p1, s2 with p2, and s3 with p3.
As a consequence, the voltage at the s1 terminals is proportional to the voltage at
p1 terminals, and the same applies to s2 and s3, the proportionality coefﬁcients being
the same [in ideal transformers they are exactly equal to the turn ratios (see Chapter 5),
and in real transformers they are near to them (Chapter 7)].
Equation(6.1)indicates a fundamental mathematical relationbetweenlineandphase
voltages. In Europe, the standard LV levels for these two voltages are 400 and 230 V.7
Finally, note that the neutral point of the LV transformer is connected to ground, so that
its potential is maintained in all situations very near to the ground potential. Since the

round numbers instead of more precise numbers with some decimal digits is 0.4%, much lower the usual

ground is where human beings place their feet, having this connection to ground is
valuable for safety. This topic will be dealt with in detail in Chapter 15.8
Figure 6.13 shows the four-wire distribution system, which allows true three-phase
users to be fed from the three conductors a–b–c, at a line-to-line voltage level of
400 V, while single-phase users are fed through neutral and one phase conductor.
Naturally, since an important target is to achieve balanced operation of the three-phase
systems, the electricity distributor allocates individual LV users along the three
conductors, in such a way that their combined effect is a three-phase system which is
as balanced as possible. For instance, since the single-phase user of Figure 6.14 draws
its current from conductor c, additional users who must be served will be connected to
conductors b and c, also taking into account the amount of current each of them draws.
The four-wire distribution system is usually used in Europe.
Figure 6.14 shows a single-phase three-wire distribution system that allows single-
phaseuserstobefedfromthethreeconductorsoftheLVsideofadistributiontransformer.
As for the scheme of Figure 6.14, to pursue the target of drawing balanced currents
from the three-phase network, the connection of different transformers is allocated by
rotating between conductors. For instance, since the single-phase MV/LV transformer
of Figure 6.14 draws its current from conductor a, additional users will be served
through transformers connected to conductors b and c, also taking into account the
amount of current each of them draws. If the three currents are equal to each other (and
their phase displacement with respect to the corresponding voltage is equal to each
other), they will constitute a balanced set of currents and therefore the current globally
ﬂowing through the MV neutral conductor will be null. In real life situations it will be
very small in comparison with the currents ﬂowing through the phase conductors.
Also in this case, the connection to ground guarantees that in all the systems fed by
the transformer involved, all potential differences with reference to the ground will be
limited, which is useful for safety.

HISTORICAL NOTES
6.6.1
Short Biography of Tesla
Nicolas Tesla (Croatia, 1865–New York, USA, 1943) was a scientist and engineer
who gave an outstanding contribution to the development and diffusion of electri-
ﬁcation in the United States in the early years of the twentieth century.
Born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he moved to the United States in 1884.
There, he participated in the so-called “war of the currents” between those promoting
DC current for commercial electricity distribution, led by Edison, and those promot-
ing AC, led by Westinghouse.
One of the big advantages of AC is the existence of polyphase systems, especially
three-phase systems, developed by Tesla, whose patents were bought by
Westinghouse.
Tesla ﬁrst worked under Edison but then, because he felt underrated, moved to
Westinghouse, where he was able to deploy all his ideas and knowledge on AC and
polyphase AC systems.
Tesla is also credited with discovering the rotating magnetic ﬁeld (to be introduced
and discussed in the next chapter), independently of Galileo Ferraris, who made the
same discovery in the same period.
The S.I. unit of magnetic ﬂux density is the tesla in his honour.

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND
TRANSFORMERS
For the Instructor
This short chapter contains basic concepts that can be used for all rotating
machines and for power transformers. This, along with Chapter 9, avoids the
repetition of common topics in chapters relating speciﬁcally to electric machines
(Chapters 10, 11 and 12).
7.1
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 5 we introduced the ideal transformer. Here we present a more complete
analysis and more detailed circuit models of real-life transformers.
7.2
MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND SINGLE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS
Consider the basic correspondence between magnetic ﬂux density B and magnetic
ﬁeld H, as known from the study of electromagnetism:
B  μ H

where μ is the permeability of the material at the point in which H and B are
evaluated.
In a subsequent section we will brieﬂy examine magnetic hysteresis; here, however, we
can disregard it, thus assuming pure proportionality between the two ﬁelds indicated by
equation (7.1).
A magnetic circuit is composed of loops of ferromagnetic material containing
magnetic ﬂux, which is conveyed by means of coils made of conducting material,
wound around some parts of the loops. The simplest and most important magnetic
circuit has a single loop, usually with a rectangular cross section, like that illustrated in
Figure 7.1. More complex shapes are used in some three-phase transformers which,
however, are not dealt with in this book.
Consider what happens in the system of Figure 7.1 when a current i ﬂows through
the coil, which consists of N turns wound along the magnetic core. As a result of this
current, a magnetic ﬁeld is produced in all points of space. However, it can be
demonstrated that, as a consequence of the much higher permeability of iron
compared to air, most of the magnetic ﬂux ﬂows through iron; the ﬂux that traverses
the coil but which passes, at least partially, through air is called leakage ﬂux (this is
also discussed in Section 5.2.3).
For simplicity’s sake, let us ignore the leakage ﬂux. Under this hypothesis, the
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂows only inside iron. The magnetic ﬂux ﬂowing through a cross
section of the iron having a cross-sectional area A is
ϕ  ∫∫
A
B  dA  BavA
in which Bav is the average value of B over the whole cross-sectional area A, and dA is
the versor of the inﬁnitesimal area element dA.
Since the magnetic ﬁeld is supposed to ﬂow only inside iron, ϕ is constant
throughout the magnetic circuit. Moreover, because the area A is constant along the
circuit (without considering the effects of singularities near the circuit corners), Bav
also has the same value all around the circuit.

FIGURE 7.1. The structure of a simple magnetic circuit with a coil.

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND TRANSFORMERS

Moreover, it is
ϕ  BavA  μHavA
The magnetic ﬁeld Hav is related to the current ﬂowing in the coil around the magnetic
circuit by Ampère’s law (the path l of the integral may be any path inside iron, not
just lav):
ϕ  ∮
l
H  dl  Havlav  Ni
Finally it is
ϕ  ∫∫
A
B  dA  μNiA=lav  Ni=R
(7.2)
where the quantity
R  lav=μA
is a characteristic of the magnetic circuit and is called circuit reluctance. The
corresponding linked ﬂux is
ψ  Nϕ  N2i=R  Li
in which
L  N2=R
(7.3)
is the circuit self-inductance, that is, the proportionality coefﬁcient between current
and linked ﬂux, as introduced in Chapter 5 in our study of inductors.
Result: Simpliﬁed behaviour of a one-coil magnetic circuit
In a magnetic circuit having a constant cross section, current and linked ﬂux are
proportional, the proportionality coefﬁcient being the inductance L, whose
expression is (7.3).
The computation performed here is practically identical to those made in the Appendix,
when computing the inductor constitutive equation.
Consider now a magnetic circuit with two different coils, as shown in Figure 7.2.
Now both currents, i1 ﬂowing in coil 1 and i2 ﬂowing in coil 2, contribute to

generating the magnetic ﬁeld H. Again, because μfe@ μair, the force lines of magnetic
ﬁeld H (and therefore B) are much denser inside the iron core than in air.
As a result of these currents, a magnetic ﬁeld is produced in all points of space.
However, as before, because iron has a much higher permeability than air, most of the
magnetic ﬂux is through iron; again the ﬂuxes traversing the coils but ﬂowing at least
partially in the air (ﬁeld lines containing Bair, Hair in Figure 7.2) are called leakage
ﬂuxes.
Let us for a moment disregard the leakage ﬂuxes. In this case the total ﬂux ϕ
traversing coils 1 and 2 is the same and can be computed using Ampère’s law as
follows:
∮H  dl  Havlav  N1i1  N2i2
Therefore,
ϕ  μAHav  μAN1i1  N2i2=lav  N1i1  N2i2=R
or
N1i1  N2i2  Rϕ
(7.4)
The quantity R is the reluctance of the magnetic circuit as before.
If, instead, we take the leakage ﬂuxes into account, Faraday’s law as applied to the
two coils is

where ψ1 is the ﬂux linked to coil 1, equal to N1 times the iron ﬂux ϕ plus ϕ1l—that is,
primary leakage ﬂux. In a similar manner, ϕ2 is also composed of the iron ﬂux ϕ and
its leakage ﬂux ϕ12, and ψ2 equals N2 times ϕ2.

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND TRANSFORMERS

The leakage ﬂuxes are also proportional to the corresponding coil currents, because
all points of space surrounding the iron are supposed to be linear. This is written in
equation (7.5). Using the same terminology as equation (7.4), it can, in fact, be written
as follows:
ϕl1  N1i1=Rl1
ϕl2  N2i2=Rl2
and
ψl1  Ll1i1
ψl2  Ll2i2
where Ll1  N1
2/Rl1 and Ll2  N2
2/Rl2 can be interpreted as equivalent inductances of
the leakage path through air.
Equation (7.4) describes the basic behaviour of transformers, which, however,
needs some correction when leakage inductances are taken into account. Equa-
tions (7.5) complete the description of the transformer.
These two equations allow a more detailed description of transformers than that offered
by the ideal transformer discussed in Chapter 5. If we ignore the term on the right-hand
side in equation (7.4) and leakage ﬂuxes in (7.5), we immediately obtain the following
equations of ideal transformers:
e1tott ≅e1t  N1

e2t ≅e2tott;
i2t ≅N1
N2
i1t
Remember that e1 and e2 are in phase, since they indicate voltages between the dot-
marked terminals and the others (unmarked).
A complete analysis of transformer behaviour is beyond the scope of this section.
Here we present only the ﬁnal result, under the hypothesis that magnetic linearity,
stated by equation (7.1) with constant μ.
When the transformer operates in sinusoidal steady state, the corresponding phasor
circuit can be used to analyse it. A fairly complete version of this circuit, which takes
into account the leakage circuits, the coil resistances, and the term Rϕ in equa-
tion (7.4), is shown in Figure 7.3; this circuit is the classic equivalent of a single-phase
transformer, used (with minor variations) in all textbooks and also when a fairly high
level of detail in the transformer modelling is required. Only one component is still
missing: a resistor simulating iron losses, which will be introduced in the ﬁnal section
of this chapter.
The circuit shown in Figure 7.3 contains the following elements:
• an ideal transformer between E 1 and E 2;
• resistors R1 and R2 corresponding to the ohmic resistance of primary and
secondary winding;

• reactances X1  ωLl1 and X2  ωLl2 which model the effects of the leakage
inductances;
• reactance Xm  ωLm which absorbs a ﬁctitious current I m deﬁned from (7.4) as
follows:
N1I 1  N2I 2  RΦ  N1I m
This circuit can be used like any phasor circuit proposed in the previous chapters.
Whenever possible, the transformer model can be made simpler than the one in
Figure 7.3. For instance, often the inductance Xm is removed from the circuit, since the
current it absorbs, except when the secondary is disconnected from any load, is very
small with respect to the other currents I 1 and I 2.
When this is done, the equations of the circuit of Figure 7.3 become

As usual, here uppercase underlined quantities indicate phasors corresponding to
sinusoidal quantities. Compare with equations (7.5).
If we further ignore all the leakage ﬂuxes, the equations of the circuit of Figure 7.3
become

described with reference to the drawings of Figure 7.4. In the case of the model of
Figure 7.4a, all the primary voltages, currents, and impedances are referred or moved
to secondary: for instance, R001 is the resistance R1 referred to secondary. In the case of
Figure 7.4b) all the secondary impedances and voltages are referred to primary: R02 is
R2 referred to primary; and so on.
Indeed the ideal transformer is still present in the shaded areas of the circuits, but
they are often not considered (i.e., they are omitted) since the circuits are studied “as
seen from” the secondary or primary winding, respectively. What mathematical
operation is performed on voltages, currents, and impedance to transfer them from one
side of the ideal transformer to the other?
For simplicity, the general rule is drawn here in the case in which the reactance Xm
is disregarded (Figure 7.5a). The part of the circuit containing the primary and the
ideal transformer can be substituted by its Thévenin equivalent. Thévenin voltage is
obtained under the condition I 2  0 (Figure 7.5b).
Posing as usual α  N2/N1, it is
U Th  E 2  αE 1  αU 1
The equality of E 1 and U 1 is a consequence of I 2  0 and therefore I 1  0, since
I 1  N2/N1 ? I 2.
Thévenin’s inner impedance is obtained by deactivating the primary voltage U 1
and feeding the circuit from the secondary (Figure 7.5c).

Therefore, the circuit shown in Figure 7.5a can be transformed using Thévenin’s
equivalent of the part in the box, thus obtaining the circuit in Figure 7.6. The total
impedance (α2R1 R2) j(α2X1 X2) is also called “secondary short-circuit impedance”
(Z sc00). In fact, dividing by Z sc00 the secondary no-load voltage αU 1, we obtain the
secondary short-circuit current (when the transformer is fed at its full voltage).
Now the result can be generalised as follows:
Rule: Referring (or moving) quantities from one side of an ideal transformer to
the other
Quantities can be transferred from one side of the ideal transformer to the other,
multiplying them by a suitable factor. If α  Nd/Ns indicates the ratio destination
turns/source turns):
• Voltages referred to destination are the original voltages multiplied by α.
• Currents referred to destination are the original currents divided by α.
• Impedances referred (or moved) to destination are the original impedances
multiplied by α2.

It was already shown in Chapter 5 that the ideal transformer, in terms of energy, is
transparent, that is, p1  u1i1  p2  u2i2 (using reference ﬂows and polarities shown in
Figure 7.2), which, in AC (sinusoidal) circuits, implies conservation of active and

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND SINGLE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS

Example 1. The primary winding of an ideal single-phase transformer is fed by a
120-V 50-Hz voltage source. The turn ratio is N1/N2  1:2. The secondary winding
feeds an impedance of 32 Ω, 0.9 power factor (lagging). Calculate:
(a) the impedance seen by the primary voltage source;
(b) the primary and secondary current;
(c) the active power delivered to the load.
The load impedance Z2 can be referred to the primary, multiplying it by
(N1/N2)2  1/4:

I1  U1=Z0
2  120=8  15 A
I2  I1=N2=N1  7:5 A
I2 can also be calculated as U2/Z2  (U1 ? N2/N1)/Z2  120 ? 2/32  7.5 A.
The power delivered to the load can be calculated as P2  U2I2 cos φ2 
240 ? 7.5 ? 0.9  1620 W (P1  U1I1 cos φ1  120 ? 7.5 ? 0.9  1620 W  P2, the trans-
former being ideal).
Example 2. An ideal single-phase transformer is fed by a 100-V sinusoidal voltage
source, thus providing 25 V at the secondary winding. If N1 is 40 turns, f  50 Hz, and
the net cross-sectional area of the core is A  100 cm2, calculate N2, the ﬂux ϕ, and ^B.
If the load absorbs 12 A and cos φ2  0.9, calculate the primary current and the
active and reactive power provided to the transformer by the electric grid.
The turn ratio N1/N2 equals U1/U2  100/25  4, thus N2  N1/4  40/4  10 turns.
Since u1(t)  e1(t)  d/dt(N1 ϕ), U1  jωN1Φ and U1  ωN1ϕ:

Example 3. A single-phase transformer has the following parameters (see Fig-
ure 7.3): R1  2.8 Ω, R2  30 mΩ, X1  5 Ω, X2  60 mΩ, N1/N2  10. The transformer
is fed by a primary voltage of 230 V. Calculate the equivalent circuit referred to the
secondary.
The equivalent voltage source seen by the secondary is, disregarding Im with
respect to I1, 230/10  23 V.
The primary impedance referred to the secondary can be easily calculated as
R100  jX100  (R1  jX1)/(N1/N2)2  28  j50 mΩ.
The secondary short-circuit impedance is then R100  jX100  R2  jX2  58 
j110 mΩ  124 mΩ  62.2°.
The secondary short-circuit current, when the primary is rated fed, is
23/0.124  185 A.

THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS
Three-phase transformers can have different construction modes. Here we brieﬂy
present only the transformers created as a three-phase bank of single-phase
transformers.
The three-phase bank is constituted by a simple connection of single phase
transformers.
Possible connections are star2/star, star/delta, and delta/delta. For example, star/
star and star/delta are shown in Figure 7.8.

FIGURE 7.8. Three-phase transformers obtained interconnecting single-phase transformers.
2As already discussed in Chapter 6, star connection is also referred to as “wye” connection.
THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS
225

It easy to verify in the previous ﬁgure that in a three-phase star connection the three
single-phase windings share one terminal, and the other terminals connect with the
transformer exterior. In the delta connection, on the other hand, the terminals are
connected in sequence, and the connection points constitute the points of junction
with the transformer exterior.
The principal difference between the star-connected side and the delta-
connected side of a three-phase transformer is that in the star-connected side it
is possible to access the neutral point. Therefore both phase and line voltages can
be accessed.
However, this is not very important in perfectly balanced systems, such as those dealt
with in this book, since the phase voltages are easily reproduced in the phase of any star-
connected impedances connected to the three-phase system in question.
Numerical relationships between line and phase voltage and currents are derived
directly as we saw in Chapter 6:
in a star connection : Ul 

Il  Iphase
(7.8)
in a delta connection : Ul  Uphase;

p
Iphase
(7.9)
where Ul is the line (phase-to-phase) voltage and Il is the line current, that is, the
current ﬂowing in each conductor of the three-phase power line (see Figure 7.8).
Phase voltage and currents are instead applied to each single-phase transformer which
constitutes the three-phase bank.
Once the phase voltage and currents are determined, models made for single-phase
transformers can be used.
Regardless of the winding connections, in an ideal three-phase transformer the
complex power S1 entering the machine equals the complex power S2 provided to the
load by the secondary winding:
S 1  P1  jQ1  P2  jQ2  S 2
(7.10)
Using (7.8), (7.9), and (7.10), the reader can easily demonstrate that, regardless of
the winding connections, the three-phase bank powers are three times those of each
single-phase transformer.
Example 4. The primary and secondary winding of a three-phase transformer are
respectively delta- and wye-connected. The rated power is 100 kVA and the rated
primary voltage is 10 kV (phase-to-phase). If each phase has N1/N2  50, calculate:
(a) the secondary rated voltage (both phase and phase-to-phase);
(b) the primary rated current (both line and phase);
(c) the secondary rated current (both line and phase);
(d) ^B if f  50 Hz and the magnetic circuit section is 250 cm2, if N1  2000 turns.

7.4
MAGNETIC HYSTERESIS AND CORE LOSSES
In the previous sections we examined a simple linear relation between magnetic ﬂux
density and ﬁeld:
B  μH
The ferromagnetic material of which the transformer core is made (like other
machines, as will be seen in the following chapters) does not show a linear
correspondence between these two quantities. The two vectors share the same
direction, but the amplitude ratio is not constant.
The real behaviour shows a hysteresis loop like the one shown in Figure 7.9. While
the general shape depicted in the ﬁgure can be attributed to any ferromagnetic
material, the numerical values are typical of ordinary polycrystalline metal, such as
fairly pure iron.
The user can verify that the ratio B/H on the parts of the curve far from the axes is much
larger than μ0, the value valid for nonferromagnetic materials.
If the magnetic ﬁeld varies as a sine, with an amplitude cycling between ^H and
^H, the ﬂux density B will be obtained from the plot, following the shown hysteresis
loop. Clearly it will not have a sinusoidal shape. This creates a problem: in order to
accurately model the hysteresis characteristic of a transformer, we would have to
abandon the phasor circuit, which requires linearity, which is well beyond the scope of
this book.
MAGNETIC HYSTERESIS AND CORE LOSSES
227

Magnetic hysteresis is important also from an energy point of view: it can be
demonstrated that hysteresis phenomenon implies loss of energy in the magnetic
circuit of the transformer, which reduces efﬁciency and heats the iron.
Another important phenomenon inside the iron core that dissipates power and
contributes to heating is that of “eddy currents.” The alternating ﬁeld in the core
generates, in accordance with Faraday’s law, EMFs in the core itself; these in turn
produce currents, since iron is conductive. These currents generate heat within the
iron in accordance with Joule’s law.
Consider a side of the toroidal structure of a transformer. The alternating ﬂux inside
creates a magnetic ﬁeld in the iron itself, whose force lines belong to the plane
orthogonal to the side axis. Thus currents, called eddy currents because of their shape,
ﬂow along these force lines and generate heat in the iron, dissipating otherwise useful
energy (Figure 7.10a).

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND TRANSFORMERS

This phenomenon must be reduced. In fact, in all electric machines (i.e., trans-
formers and rotating machines), whenever iron is traversed by a variable magnetic
ﬁeld, the iron is laminated. This means that the iron core is not solid; instead, it is
composed of several thin layers covered in very thin insulating material stuck to each
other. The possibilities for the current to ﬂow are therefore reduced to very
narrow paths inside the layer, and the global losses are thus dramatically reduced
(Figure 7.10b).
Eddy current and hysteresis losses can be roughly taken into account by slightly
modifying the equivalent circuit as shown in Figure 7.3, with the addition of a new
resistor Rm (Figure 7.11).
It must be noted that the law linking the dissipated power to the circuit voltage on Rm is
not the same of a ohmic resistor. Therefore this usage of Rm gives reasonable results only
in small ranges of the E1 (i.e., voltage across Rm) and therefore on small ranges of U1
and U2.
To conclude, consider Figure 7.12, which shows graphically (and qualitatively) the
power ﬂuxes of a transformer. It shows that in a real transformer the output power is
only a fraction of the input. Losses are in the primary and secondary resistances
(called copper losses), as well as in the iron, constituted by hysteresis and eddy-
current losses.

OPEN-CIRCUIT AND SHORT-CIRCUIT TESTS
A method for determining the parameters of the equivalent circuit of a transformer
(see Figure 7.11) consists of two tests: the “open-circuit test” and the “short-circuit
test.”
To perform these tests, the following hardware is needed:
• An ammeter, that is, a two-terminal device that measures current in circuits. In
the case of AC ammeters, they normally directly give their rms values.
Obviously an ammeter must be connected to the circuit in such a way that
the current to be measured ﬂows through it (“series” connection). The voltage
between the two terminals of an ideal ammeter is null; that is, its internal
impedance can be neglected with respect to the Thévenin impedance of the
circuit to which it is connected.
• A voltmeter, that is, a two-terminal device that measures voltage in circuits. In
the case of AC voltmeters, these normally directly give their rms values.
Obviously, a voltmeter must be connected to the circuit in such a way that
its terminals are applied to the points of the circuit, whose potential difference
must be measured (“shunt” connection). The current absorbed by an ideal
voltmeter is null; that is, its internal impedance is extremely high with respect to
the Thévenin impedance of the circuit to which it is connected.
• A wattmeter, that is, a device that measures powers in circuits. AC wattmeters
measure the (average) active power P  pt  utit. Since P is a function of
both current and voltage, the wattmeter is provided with two current terminals
(to be connected in series with the current, exactly like an ammeter) and with
two voltage terminals (to be connected parallel to the voltage, exactly like a
voltmeter).
In the open-circuit test (Figure 7.13) the nominal voltage is applied to the primary
side of the transformer, while leaving the secondary side open. The current I0 into the
primary winding is measured, as well as the active power P0 absorbed by the
transformer, which corresponds to the sums of powers dissipated by R1 and Rm.
Since it is always R1  Rm, P0 is a good estimation of iron losses, due to eddy currents
and magnetic hysteresis. Such losses, which strictly depend on the voltage across Rm,

The short-circuit test (Figure 7.14) requires the secondary winding terminals to
be connected to each other (Figure 7.14). This is called short-circuiting. Under
these conditions, applying the nominal voltage at the primary winding would
cause very high currents which, if lasting more than just a few milliseconds, would
seriously damage the transformer. Therefore, a much smaller voltage Usc is
applied to the primary winding of the transformer in such a manner that the
primary current equals the nominal primary transformer current; Usc corresponds
to a few cents of the nominal winding voltage.
During this test, Im can be neglected with respect to I1 (the core is poorly
magnetised); thus the power absorbed by Rm is much lower than the one consumed
by R1 and R2. For this reason, the power Psc measured by the wattmeter is a good
estimation of copper losses at rated current; in any other loading condition we have

PERMANENT MAGNETS
In Section 7.4 we introduced the magnetic hysteresis curve of ferromagnetic
materials, shown again in Figure 7.16, with some additions. The curve shows that
when the applied magnetic ﬁeld H is gradually reduced from its maximum value ^H to
zero, the effect (i.e., ﬂux density B) does not go to zero, but reaches a residual value Br.

This residual ﬂux density, however, disappears when the negative ﬁeld Hc is reached,
called coercive force.
If the same material is used at a larger ^H, the loop vertex (indicated in the ﬁgure by
the point P) moves along the straight line indicated in the ﬁgure as the P-point locus.
This line appears to be horizontal in the scale of the ﬁgure, but indeed it is not: its slope
is the air permeability μ0.
When ordinary iron is used (i.e., the one shown in Figure 7.9), the magnetic ﬁeld
present in the machine iron oscillates between values much higher than 100 A/m, and
the Br is just a point of the magnetic hysteresis loop experienced by the machine.
There are special materials, however, that have a coercive force several orders of
magnitude higher than that of simple pure iron, and this allows them to be used in a
completely different way inside electric machines. For these, the most signiﬁcant part
of the magnetising curve is the one in the second quadrant, called demagnetisation
curve, and is shown for some common materials in Figure 7.17. The Alnicos are
materials containing Al, Ni, Co, and Fe, which have been widely used in the past
century. The demagnetisation curve on one of the alnicos is shown, having Hc 
50 kA/m, much larger than that of common iron.
Barium and strontium ferrites, invented in the 1950s, have higher Hc
j
j than Alnico,
but lower Br. More recently, samarium–cobalt (Sm–Co) and neodymium–iron–boron
(Nd–Fe–Br) were introduced, both of which have excellent characteristics in terms of
Br and Hc, but cost more than ferrites. Sm–Co and Nd–Fe–Br materials belong to the
family of rare-earth permanent magnets (PMs).
Ferrites and rare-earth PMs have a slope equal to μ0. This is very important in their
usage in electrical machines: in a magnetic circuit they behave like air, into which the
ﬁxed ﬂux density bias Br is introduced.
Therefore, we can draw up the following rule, which will be exploited in the
following chapters, when permanent-magnet DC and synchronous machines will be
discussed.

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS AND TRANSFORMERS

Rule: Permanent-magnet equivalent
If ferrite or rare-earth permanent magnets are used, their effect is the production of
a ﬁxed ﬂux density Br (equal to the PM residual ﬂux density), combined with the
magnetic behaviour of the space occupied by the magnet, which is the same as that
of air.

For the Instructor
This chapter aims to give students sufﬁcient knowledge of how electric power is
converted using electronic power converters, in order to facilitate the study of
electric drives, which will be dealt with in later chapters. Furthermore, students
will learn how inverters operate to allow power to be fed into grids from low-
power power plants such as small photovoltaic generators. However, since it is not
essential to an understanding of subsequent chapters, this chapter is optional.
Moreover, the teacher may choose to limit the study of this chapter to Sections
8.1–8.3 on time-domain analysis, or to approach it as a whole in order to explore
frequency-domain analysis, which is used to explain ﬁltering.
8.1
INTRODUCTION
In the next chapter we will introduce electromechanical energy conversion—that is,
conversion of energy from electricity to mechanical energy and vice versa. In
Chapters 10, 11, and 12 we will explore how this kind of conversion can be attained
in practice—that is, how rotating electrical machines are constructed and operate.

Nowadays, however, another kind of conversion of electric energy is carried out
with increasing frequency: conversion from one electrical form into another, such as
the conversion of DC power into AC and vice versa, or of a DC system into another
DC system operating at a different voltage level.
This kind of electrical-to-electrical power conversion is normally effected using
systems without moving parts—that is, without the interposition of mechanical
energy. This is called static power conversion or electronic power conversion and
is achieved using apparatuses and techniques which are analysed within the discipline
of power electronics.
The systems that carry out these conversions are called electronic power converters or
power electronics converters, or simply converters. It is also worth mentioning the name
used by an authoritative source [bm4] for such converters—that is, power processing
units (or PPUs).
In power electronics, typical electronics components (such as diodes and transis-
tors) are used to process not signals, but power (and energy).
8.2
POWER ELECTRONIC DEVICES
8.2.1
Diodes, Thyristors, Controllable Switches
As mentioned in the introduction, the power electronics converter is an assembly of
elementary components (devices). Readers should be familiar with some of these
from their study of Part II of this book—that is, resistors, capacitors, inductors,
mutually coupled inductors.
Others, however, are totally different. A fairly comprehensive list is shown in
Figure 8.1. In the ﬁgure, they are divided into three zones according to their
behaviour. It will soon be seen that all these devices can reasonably be considered
as on/off switches. Therefore, the devices are classiﬁed according to how the
commutation between on and off states can occur, as follows:
• Diodes, for which the commutation between on and off states is determined by
the circuit into which the diode is inserted.
• Thyristors (or silicon-controlled rectiﬁers, often designated by the acronym
SCRs), for which commutation from off to on is determined by an electrical
current pulse sent into the gate terminal G, while commutation from on to off is
determined by the circuit into which the thyristor is inserted (the three different
symbols shown in Figure 8.1 indicate minor differences in operation that are
beyond the scope of this book; only the uppermost symbol, which indicates a
generic thyristor, will be used).
• Controllable switches, for which commutation between on and off is determined
by electrical signals applied to the control terminal (named gate - G). Since all
240
FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

the controllable switches show approximately the same behaviour, a single
symbol is used for all of them; this symbol, though not included in the
International standards, is very common in good-quality books, such as
[bm2]. Since all controllable switches allow substantial amounts of current
to ﬂow only from one terminal toward another (and not vice versa), the chosen
symbol is asymmetrical, and indicates preferred current ﬂow direction by means
of an arrow. The control terminal G is very often omitted in circuit representa-
tions, and it will be used very rarely in this book.
Figure 8.1 shows the commonly used letters for the device terminals. When used within
circuits, these letters are often omitted. The letters are the initials of the common terminal
names which, in turn, describe the inner structure of the device:

The same ﬁgure shows that the control terminal of the controllable switch, when not
omitted, is called gate (G).
The following sections include a concise description of the behaviour of these
devices, as well as an introduction to approximations in such a way that they can be
analysed using the linear circuit concepts. In all cases, we will analyse the behaviour
of these devices as a “black box”—that is, presenting their behaviour in terms of a
terminal voltage–current relationship, without analysing their inner structure or how
they are produced.

8.2.2
The Branch Approximation of Thyristors and Controllable Switches
The reader may have noticed that all the power electronic devices listed in Figure 8.1,
except for the diode, are three-terminal devices and are therefore not “branches”
according to the deﬁnition given in Chapter 3.
In this same chapter, Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) was ﬁrst used for a generic
circuit zone comprised within a closed curve (see Figure 3.8); a special version was
introduced for branch-based circuits. We have not yet needed to resort to the more
general version of KCL.
Consider now two examples of power electronic devices, the SCR and the IGBT
(Figure 8.2).
In both cases the more general KCL states
i1  iG  i2  0
(8.1)
However, it must be noted that in the vast majority of cases, the current ﬂowing in the
control terminal G is much smaller than those ﬂowing in the other terminals.
Therefore in these cases, (8.1) reduces to
i1  i2  0
(8.2)
which is the usual KCL for branches.
This approach is usually adopted by all textbooks and will be followed here. The
following rule can now be formally stated.
Rule: Branch approximation of power electronic devices
In the case of three-terminal power electronic components (either thyristors or
controllable switches), the current entering the control terminal is disregarded, and
therefore the sum of currents entering the other terminals is assumed to be zero.
Some controllable switches (i.e., GTOs and IGCTs), draw fairly large currents from the
gate for very brief periods during commutation. Gate currents are supplied by a gate
driver, normally assembled with the GTO or IGCT. In this case, equation (8.2) is still
valid, if i1 and i2 are the currents entering the device-gate driver assembly.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

Using this rule, all electronic devices can be considered as branches, in which the
two main terminals can absorb currents having zero as their algebraic sum; the third
terminal is represented just as a reminder that a signal is transmitted to send
information to the devices (a command to switch on or off), but it carries no current.
8.2.3
Diodes
The diode is a two-terminal component. It can thus be connected to other components
in circuits. Its speciﬁc behaviour is summarized by its constitutive equation, which, in
general, describes the voltage across terminals, the current ﬂowing in the component,
and, possibly, their derivatives (see Chapter 3, and in particular Section 3.5.2 on
“constitutive equations”).
The constitutive equation of a diode is that of a nonlinear algebraic element and can
be expressed in one of the following forms:
ud  f uid
or
id  f iud
Function f has a very special form, as can be seen in Figure 8.3, in which ud and id
are measured according to references that follow the load sign convention.
Three zones can be singled out in the diode characteristic:
• The conducting zone (or forward zone), in which the voltage across terminals is
very low (in the order of magnitude of 1 volt) and the current, it can be said, can
ﬂow freely, without signiﬁcant further increases in voltage.
• The blocking zone (or reverse zone), in which the current is near zero (slightly
negative), while the voltage is negative and can increase freely in absolute
value, though only up to the point at which the third zone begins.
• The breakdown zone, in which both current and voltage are negative and not
near zero.
In the blocking zone (id < 0), the diode absorbs very low power pd  ud id, because
id is near zero. In the conducting zone (id > 0), the diode absorbs relatively low power

because the voltage is very low. In the breakdown zone, the absorbed power is much
greater than in the other two zones.
The breakdown zone is used only in special diodes called zener diodes (or,
sometimes, breakdown diodes), which will not be dealt with in further detail in this
book. Only the forward and reverse zones are, then, of interest in this chapter.
Obviously, the systems into which the diodes are to be inserted will be such that the
voltage is never lower than uz.
The reader might wonder how voltages and currents can be determined in a circuit
containing a diode. Consider, for instance, the circuit shown in Figure 8.4. This can be
seen as the composition of the part of the circuit to the left of nodes A–B and the one to
the right. Both parts are algebraic. An algebraic two-terminal element (i.e., branch,
according to this book’s terminology) is characterised by a constitutive equation that
contains neither derivative nor integral and is therefore an ordinary function, which
can be represented by a curve in the U–I plane.
The operation of the circuit of Figure 8.4 in the U–I plane is represented in
Figure 8.5. The operating point P determines the voltage and current UP and IP
across terminals A – B. The area of the rectangle having, as opposite vertices, the
axis origin and point P is a graphical indication of the power lost in the component
(Plost  Up Ip).
In the analysis of electronic power converters, a simpliﬁed version of the diode
characteristic can very often be used, and this greatly facilitates circuit analysis. This is
shown in Figure 8.6b. The breakdown zone is disregarded, since the converters are
designed so that it is never reached. The blocking zone is idealized in such a way that the
current,insteadofbeingverylow,isexactlyzero.Theconductingzonevoltageisidealized
also: the voltage across terminals, instead of being relatively low, is exactly zero.
In this way, the blocking zone of the actual diode is substituted by a nonconducting
zone in the idealized diode, called off-state. Similarly, the forward zone is converted

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

into an ideal conducting zone, called on-state zone. With this idealization, the diode
operates as a switch open (no current ﬂow) in the off-state zone and closed (null
voltage across terminals) in the on-state zone.
The opening/closing action is determined by the conditions in the circuit outside
the diode, as is clear from the examples below.
Any change in the diode state (from on to off and vice versa) is called diode
commutation.
In the following circuits we will need to evaluate the diode states in a couple of
signiﬁcant cases, which are analysed here.
Consider what happens when two diodes are connected in series, having cathodes
in common (Figure 8.7a).
If VA > VB, the lower diode is off because it is reverse-biased; when i0  0, the very
small (negligible) reverse current of diode DB will be transferred from terminal A to B.
But when the load is such that some signiﬁcant current i0 ﬂows (much greater than the
diode’s inverse current), this current can ﬂow only through the diode DA, which,
therefore, becomes conductive.
If VA  VB the situation is undetermined and the share of current between the two diodes
will be determined by the details of the two real characteristics that will never be
perfectly equal to each other. This condition is, however, of little interest.
Consider now three diodes with cathodes in common (Figure 8.7b). The condition
in which two potentials have exactly the same value is of little interest and can be

ignored. We can therefore give terminals their names in such a way that it is
VA > VC > VB. Applying what we have just learned in the case of two diodes
connected by their cathodes, we infer that diode DB is necessarily off, because
both UAB > 0 and UCB > 0.
Applying the two-diode rule to the DA–DC couple, we can infer that also DC is off.
When i0  0, the diode DA will transfer only their very small inverse currents toward
DB and DC. But when the load is such that a signiﬁcant current i0 ﬂows (much greater
than the inverse current of the diodes), it can ﬂow only through the diode DA (the only
non-reverse biased), which therefore becomes conductive.
These two examples justify the following general rule:
Rule: State of diodes connected by their cathodes to a common point
When two or more diodes are connected to each other by their cathodes the diode
having at its anode the highest potential will be conducting, the others will be
blocked.
This is graphically expressed in Figure 8.8, in which conducting diodes are shaded.
It should now be quite easy to understand the rule for diodes with anodes in
common:
Rule: State of diodes connected by their anodes to a common point
When two or more diodes are connected to each other by their anodes, the diode
having at its anode the lowest potential will be conducting, the others will be
blocked.
These are pictorially described in Figure 8.9.

diffusion of other more economical semiconductor devices, such as IGBTs, which we
will study later.
Thyristors are still used in very large power applications (greater than a few tens of
megawatts); but since their assessment and selection needs electric power engineers,
they are beyond the scope of this book. Thyristor-based electronic converters, then,
will not be dealt with in this chapter.
For the sake of completeness, the basic behaviour of thyristors is however
explained below.
From Figure 8.10, it is clear that the thyristor has an on-state characteristic very
similar to a diode. However, when an adequate signal is sent into the gate terminal,
constituted by a pulse of very short duration (in the order of tens of microseconds) and
very low value (several orders of magnitude below the maximum current that can ﬂow
in anode and cathode), the SCR is switched from off to on.
The reverse switch action (i.e., from on to off) cannot be obtained by using the
gate terminal: it occurs naturally when the SCR enters the reverse zone, and it stays
there for at least a characteristic time, called “turn-off time.” Typical turn-off times are
some tens of microseconds. As a consequence, the thyristor can be imagined as a
device which operates as a switch; only the switching action from off to on is
controllable, while the reverse occurs naturally.
As for the diode, any change in the SCR state (from on to off and vice versa) is
called SCR commutation.

8.2.5
Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)
Insulated-gate bipolar transistors, like SCRs, appear from the outside to be three-
terminal devices. However, they can be turned on and off by suitable action on gate
terminal.
A qualitative representation of the IGBT’s characteristics is shown in the left-hand
part of Figure 8.11. The power terminals are collector (C) and emitter (E); the control
terminal gate (G) always draws negligible current in comparison to the current
ﬂowing through the power terminals. The voltage uGE between collector and emitter
determines the behaviour of the IGBT on the C–E side.
To understand this more clearly, consider the IGBT connected to external circuits
both at the GE and CE sides, as shown in Figure 8.12. The operating point P of the
circuit can be determined in a very similar manner to that explained in Section 8.2.3
for diodes—that is, by ﬁnding the intersection of the u–i characteristics of the parts of
the circuit to the left and right of the A–B pair.
The circuit to the right of the A–B points can be described by a constitutive
equation which is equivalent to the Us–Ri pair in series, whose intercepts to the uCE–ic
axes are Us and Us/Ri respectively.
The circuit to the left of A–B is dependent on uGE voltage. However, once the
uGE is known, the speciﬁc characteristic of the IGBT (i.e., the constitutive
equation between C and E), which must intersect with the straight line repre-
senting Us/Ri, is also immediately known: this is shown in black in the right-hand
part of Figure 8.12.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

It must be said, however, that points like P in Figure 8.12 are never (at least as
regards this book) used in power electronics. The only zone of the C–E IGBT
characteristics of interest to electronic power converters is the one before the knee
bend—that is, the black part as shown in Figure 8.13.
Moreover, in the vast majority of power electronics applications, only the ﬁrst
quadrant part of the characteristics is of interest—that is, the lines shown in black in
the left-hand part of Figure 8.13. It is now natural to identify an idealized version of
these characteristics, which are shown in the right part of the same ﬁgure. According
to these characteristics, the IGBT operates as a switch that can be in on-state (voltage
is zero) or off-state (current is zero).
The transition from on to off and vice versa is controlled by acting on the voltage
applied between gate and emitter.
The idealized characteristics shown in the right-hand part of Figure 8.13 contain
only positive values of voltage and current; this is acceptable in all situations in which
a diode is connected in antiparallel with the collector-emitter terminals (Figure 8.14).
In general the word “antiparallel” can be used to indicate a special connection of
two branches having a preferential direction of current ﬂow. When these two
preferential directions are opposite each other, they are said to be connected in
antiparallel.
Using the connection shown in Figure 8.14, the IGBT is required to operate as a
controllable switch, to be traversed by current and subject to voltage only when iC and
uCE are non-negative. Whenever each of them tends to be negative, the diode switches
on, and the current ﬂows in the diode instead of in the IGBT.

8.2.6
Summary of Power Electronic Devices
In Section 8.2.1 we presented a list of possible controllable switches. In Section 8.2.5
we looked at the way in which an IGBT can operate as a controllable, one-directional
switch.
It would be easy to repeat the analysis presented in Section 8.2.5 also for MOSs,
GTOs, BJTs, and so on. However, this is not necessary for a basic understanding of
the operation of power electronics conversion. What must be known is that, except for
minor details, all of them operate as controllable (one-directional) switches, and
indeed they are very often represented in circuits using a single, generic symbol as
shown in the right part of Figure 8.1.
When a controllable switch is switched from on to off or vice versa, it is
commutated and the switching action is called commutation.
Differences, however, exist:
• Not all of them have the same losses. The differences can be in terms of on-state
losses (caused, as already noted, by the fact that the voltage is not exactly zero
and the product voltage times current determines the losses) and switching
losses—that is, the losses created each time a switch is moved from on-state to
off-state and vice versa.
• Some of them are more suitable for fast commutation. For instance, Mosfets can
be commutated at frequencies that can reach 100 kHz and more, while GTOs
can be switched at a few hundred hertz at most.
• Some of them are able to carry huge on-state currents and/or withstand large off-
state voltages, others are more limited in this respect. The high-voltage/high-
current devices are more suitable as basic elements of large power converters;
In Table 8.1 the switches are compared in terms of power (product of maximum
on-state direct current, and off-state reverse voltage) and commutation speeds. In
general, it happens that the fastest switching devices are limited in terms of on-state
current and reverse-voltage capability and vice versa. Also, power electronic devices
obey the general rule of nature; that is, big is slow, small is fast!
The two opposite extremes in this respect are GTOs-IGCTs and MOSFETS, the
ﬁrst being powerful and slow, the latter fast and suitable for low powers. IGBTs are
becoming more and more common because they are suitable for both average and
high powers and speeds. MOSFETs are used inside converters up to a few kilowatts,
while GTOs and IGCTs are required inside converters larger than a few megawatts.

POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS
8.3.1
Rectiﬁers
A very important static power conversion frequently carried out in electric power
systems is unidirectional AC to DC. This is performed using converters based on
diodes, called rectiﬁers.
Rectiﬁers are devices that convert AC power into DC without affecting (if we
disregard inner power losses) the transferred power. This concept is illustrated in
Figure 8.15, showing single-phase and three-phase rectiﬁers. This is a generic black-
box representation concealing inner details, which is useful when all that matters is
their external behaviour.
In practice, output power will be slightly lower than input power. Normal
efﬁciency (i.e., ratio of output power to input power) is around 95–98%.
It is now time to look inside the black boxes shown in Figure 8.15, showing how
AC (either single-phase or three-phase) can be converted to DC using the power
electronic components examined in the previous section.
In its basic form, a single-phase rectiﬁer has an architecture called single-phase
bridge, as shown in the left-hand part of Figure 8.16. To analyse the behaviour of

this bridge, we observe that the upper diodes are connected as depicted in the left-
hand part of Figure 8.8, and therefore the diode corresponding to the higher
potential is conducting while the other is reverse-biased (off). On the other hand,
the lower diodes are connected as depicted in the left-hand part of Figure 8.9, and
therefore the diode corresponding to the lower potential is conducting while the
other is reverse-biased (off). Therefore, during the time interval between 0 and T/2,
D1 and D2 are conducting (and the other diodes blocked), and between T/2 and T the
opposite states occur.
As a consequence of this simple analysis, the output voltage will have the shape
shown in Figure 8.16b; that is, it is unidirectional and has a nonzero mean value. It is
not exactly what we would call a DC voltage, but the fact that it has an average
signiﬁcantly greater than zero means that, by appropriate ﬁltering, a reasonably
quasi-constant voltage can be obtained. Filtering techniques will be discussed in
Section 8.4. In this ﬁgure, U  rms(ur(t)).1
There are, however, some DC loads that only require unidirectional voltages, like
the one shown in Figure 8.16b; these can be fed directly from the output of the single-
phase rectiﬁer.
It is interesting to evaluate what happens in the same circuit if the load is
constituted by an R–L couple, instead of a simple resistance (Figure 8.17). In this
case, the current is not proportional to the voltage, but has a different shape: it is
somewhat ﬁltered [(imax  imin)/iavg is lower than (umax  umin)/uavg)] as well as
delayed. The current i2(t) refers to a larger L/R than i1(t). It is apparent that the
higher this L/R ratio, the smoother the current.
The output voltage waveform is easily evaluated simply by checking the polarity
of the voltage source, as was done for the example of Figure 8.16; the current wave is
normally computed using one of many available simulation programmes. In this
ﬁgure, U  rms(ur(t)).

sine wave is discussed in Chapter 5.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

Current id(t) can also be determined by means of harmonic analysis, using
procedures based on the theory or Fourier series, shown in Section 8.4 and 8.5.
However, because of the above-mentioned availability of computer programmes, the
length of this procedure, and the introductory nature of this book, details of how to do
this are not a priority here.
As a second, very signiﬁcant example of rectiﬁers, we now introduce the three-
phase rectiﬁer, shown in Figure 8.18, as fed by ideal sinusoidal voltages and loaded
with a resistor R. The conducting diodes are determined by potentials of points A,
B, C, according to the rule stated in Section 8.2.3: the upper load terminal is the
common cathode of the three upper diodes, and will therefore have the highest
potential from among VA, VB, and VC. Similarly, the lower load terminal will have
the lowest potential from among VA, VB, and VC. There will thus be a voltage
ud(t)  max(VA, VB, VC)  min(VA, VB, VC). This voltage will cause a current
id  ud/R to ﬂow.
This is applied at all times t in the plot in the right part of Figure 8.18. In this ﬁgure,
U  rms(ur(t))  rms(us(t)  rms(ut(t)).
The ﬁgure also shows the commutation times in which diodes change their state
(for instance, t  T/6, t  2T/6, etc.) Clearly, at these times actual voltages and
currents are determined by the real, not ideal, diode characteristics, but this more
detailed analysis will not change the results shown in Figure 8.18 except for minor
details.
The reader might have noted how the diodes are numbered. This choice of subscripts is
fairly standard and has a mnemonic advantage. It can indeed be seen that, using this
numbering, the upper diodes, with odd numbers, enter their on-state in natural sequence:
1-3-5-1-3-5, etc. Similarly, the lower diodes, having even subscripts, enter their on-state
in natural sequence as well: 2-4-6-2-4-6, etc.
It is also to be noted that while commutation takes place every sixth of the period, each
diode stays in its on-state for a third of the period.

This result is easily interpreted by looking at the right-hand part of Figure 8.18: the
average value should be slightly lower than the maximum of ud(t) because of the
ripple, and in fact it is reduced by a factor of 3/π  0.955.
To understand the behaviour of the currents delivered by the AC three-phase
network, consider that at each circuit conﬁguration (each commutation causes a
conﬁguration change) one of the three voltage sources delivers current (which is thus
equal to the DC load current), another receives this current back, and no current ﬂows
through the third one.
Referring again to time t1 of Figure 8.18, it is apparent that ir(t1)  id(t),
is(t1)  id(t1), it(t1)  0.
The global situation is shown in Figure 8.19 for ir(t). Obviously, is(t) has the
same shape as ir(t) but 120 degrees (i.e., T/3 seconds) later, and it(t) is delayed by
another T/3 seconds.
Finally consider a three-phase diode bridge with an R–L load (Figure 8.20). To
show a more realistic situation on the AC side, three inductors are also shown, to
simulate Thévenin’s impedance of a three-phase transformer, normally present at the
supply side of three phase diode rectiﬁers.
As for the single-phase rectiﬁer, the load inductance makes the load current much
smoother than the voltage. Moreover, the presence of inductances at the supply side
has an effect on commutation; this can be veriﬁed by theoretical analysis, disregarded
here for the sake of simplicity.

As usual, the situation can be evaluated using a simulation programme, which
would produce, for instance, the results shown in Figure 8.21. In the left part of this
ﬁgure, the behaviour of the bridge, shown in Figure 8.20, is viewed under the
hypothesis that Lc  0 and the inductance/resistance ratio in the load part is much
greater than the period T of the supply voltages.

Some comments can be made:
• In the ideal case, shown in the left-hand part of the ﬁgure, the DC current is ﬂat.
The corresponding AC current equals the DC one for one-third of T, is zero for
T/6, and is equal to the DC current but with opposite sign for another T/3.
• In the realistic case, the DC current presents some ripple, even though in the full
scale of the plot it is still not visible. The AC side current no longer has vertical
segments, which are substituted by curved segments.
• In the realistic case, the DC voltage has some notches, which cause the average
value to be lower than in the ideal case. It can be demonstrated that the reduction
of the average DC voltage due to this phenomenon is proportional to the average
DC current.
Moreover, it can be demonstrated that those curved segments which in the real case
substitute the vertical segment of the AC current, are parts of sine curves. It is worth
noticing that, because the constitutive equation of inductors is uL  Ldi/dt, the vertical
segments are not allowed, since otherwise the voltages across Lc terminals would be
inﬁnite. This further justiﬁes the fact that the presence of Lc causes these vertical
segments to disappear.
To avoid the complexity of analysing all the details of the three-phase bridge when
it is inserted into a more complex system, an equivalent DC-side circuit is shown in
Figure 8.22.
In this circuit:
• Ud0 represents the average DC voltage which is present when Id or Lc is
negligible. As already said, this is Ud0  3=π
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
U.
• Rc represents the voltage drop due to the presence of LC’s on the AC side; as
already mentioned, voltage drop is proportional to the DC current. It can be
demonstrated that it is Rc  3=πωLc  3=πXc (ω being 2π/T) such a
mathematical detail is beyond the scope of this book.
• The diode is needed to ensure that the current cannot be reversed.
Needless to say, this equivalent disregards any ripple in the quantities and takes
into account only average values.
It must also be noted that Rc models the effects of Lc’s, and does not imply energy
losses. It is not a real resistor, but only a way to indicate that the DC voltage is reduced
by an amount proportional to the delivered current.

8.3.2
DC–DC Converters
DC–DC converters can modify the two parameters that deﬁne DC power—that is,
voltage and current—while leaving their product nearly unchanged. In this respect
they can be represented as black boxes as indicated in Figure 8.23.
The generic DC–DC converter shown in the left-hand part of the ﬁgure gives no
indication of the possible power ﬂows. Indeed, some DC–DC converters can transfer
power only from one side to the other and not vice versa; in this case the symbol
shown in the central part of Figure 8.23 is more informative. If power is able to go in
either direction, the symbol shown in the right-hand part of the same ﬁgure may be
used.
Ideally, a DC–DC converter operates in such a way that
U1I1  U2I2
In this respect, a DC–DC converter is very similar to the ideal transformer [Chapter 5,
Figure 5.14 and Chapter 7, equation (7.7)], and is similar to a “transformer operating
in DC systems.”
The operating principle of the transformer is based on Faraday’s law and is thus
unable to transform voltage or current while in DC; until the last two decades of the
twentieth century, when static DC–DC converters ﬁrst appeared, this limitation was a
signiﬁcant hindrance to the diffusion of DC as a means to carry and distribute electric
power.
Today, static energy conversion is a reality and this kind of transformation is easy
and cheap, even though it does not achieve the very high efﬁciency of the best
transformers. However, using relatively high quality components and architecture,
conversion efﬁciencies of around 98% are quite easy to obtain.
In its basic form, a DC–DC converter is simply composed of a controllable switch
and a diode. Consider, as a ﬁrst example, the step-down DC–DC converter (also
known as buck DC–DC converter). This is able to transfer power from a system 1 to a
system 2 under the condition that U1 > U2 (hence its name). The power cannot be
reversed.
Two typical uses of a step-down converter are (a) to create a constant DC source
whose voltage U2 is lower than the input voltage U1 and (b) to feed some quasi-
constant current into an already-existing constant DC voltage.

FIGURE 8.23. Black-box representation of DC–DC converters.
POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS
257

These two cases are shown in Figure 8.24. Remember that the controllable switch
may represent any of the devices able to operate as a controllable unidirectional on-off
switch (such as BJTs, GTOs, IGBTs, etc.; see Section 8.2). The output of the basic
converter is far from constant and has to be improved using a ﬁlter to obtain a
reasonably constant DC voltage at the load terminals; we will see in Section 8.4 how
the scheme shown in the ﬁgure can effectively operate as a ﬁlter.
In the second case the load just requires some current in-feed. Both load and basic
converter require the current to be constant or quasi constant; this is achieved with the
help of inductor L, exploiting the inherent capability of inductances to impede current
ﬂuctuation, and no explicit ﬁlter is needed. This is the case of a DC–DC converter that
feeds a DC machine: it will be seen in Chapter 10 that the machine can be effectively
modelled as a voltage source E in series with an inductor and a resistor.
Imagine the ﬁlter is operating correctly; the voltage across capacitor C is, therefore,
almost perfectly constant, and the behaviour of the basic converter can then be
analysed in either case using the circuit shown in the right part of Figure 8.24.
In DC–DC converters the controlled switch S is continually switched on and off
in a repetitive manner (Figure 8.25): it is held on—that is, in a forward conduction
state—for a time Tc, and Off for a blocking time Tb. After this, it is again switched
on and held in such a state for Tc, and the process continues. The process therefore
repeats itself in such a way that the periodicity of all the quantities is T  Tc  Tb.

If the inductance L is large enough to keep the converter output current i2(t) really
constant,2 it can be written i2(t)  I2 and the shapes of basic converter voltage and
current are those shown in Figure 8.25.
They can be explained as follows. During Tc, S is on, and therefore the input
voltage U is transferred at the output of the basic converter: u2  U. Moreover, the
input current will be equal to the output current: i1  I2.
At the end of Tc, S is switched off (by action on its gate terminal, not shown in the
circuit). The inductance connected at the output terminals of the basic converter will
prevent the output current from suddenly stopping, thus generating an overvoltage
that counteracts any reduction of current; that is, the potential of the wire to which the
diode anode is connected will rise above that of the cathode, thus causing the diode to
switch on. When the diode is on, as discussed in Section 8.2.1, it can be analysed
using the idealized characteristic—that is, disregarding the voltage across its
terminals.
We conclude that when S is switched off, the diode is forced by the inductance
action to switch on, and thus during this interval it will be u2  0. During the same
interval it is i1  0, since S is off and therefore no path exists for the current to ﬂow.
This analysis justiﬁes the shape of the plots shown in Figure 8.25. The corre-
sponding averages of the time-varying quantities—that is, u2(t) and i1(t)—are easily
computed:

Consequently;
U1I1  U2I2
as expected. The quantity
c  Tc

(8.3)
is called here conduction ratio (according to some books, duty ratio or duty cycle).
It should be apparent that the proposed circuit is only able to transfer power from
the left-hand side to the right-hand side, and the left-hand side of the basic converter
must have a higher voltage than the one required to supply the load—hence the name
step-down converter for this circuit. The very disposition of elements in the circuit
(the wire connecting U1 to the circuit is shown higher than that leaving the diode
suggests this voltage relationship.
The plots shown in Figure 8.25 consider primary secondary current as being
perfectly constant. A more realistic picture of what happens is shown in Figure 8.26.
Here the voltage is exactly the same as in Figure 8.25, but the secondary current is not

perfectly constant. The current i2 rises when S is On, and falls when it is off. During
these intervals it can be considered with a fair degree of accuracy to be composed of
segments of a straight line.
The derivative of i2(t) is related to the voltage appearing across the inductor L
according to the inductor constitutive equation (written considering the voltage and
current references shown in Figure 8.24):
uL  L di
dt
Indeed, during Tc the voltage uL is positive and equal to U1  U2 (disregarding the
drop across R), while during Tb it is uL  E and is therefore negative. In steady state
the average of i2 over Tc and Tb must be equal to each other, and this occurs when
U2T  U1Tc, conﬁrming our earlier ﬁndings.
More in Depth: Actual current and voltage shapes.
On examining again the circuits that are determined when substituting devices
with on-state or off-state switches students will realize that during both Tc and Tb
they are composed of a loop containing just a constant voltage, a resistor, and an
inductor.
Therefore, the theory of Us–R–L circuits applies (that was dealt with in Section 5.4),
and the shape of currents is exponential. However, for times which are much shorter
than the time constant of Us–R–L circuits τ  L/R, the exponential function can be
approximated a segment of a straight line, as seen in this section outside this more
in depth box.
The output voltage u2(t), while having a nonzero average, is far from constant, as
an ideal DC source should be.
However, a ﬁlter can be interposed between the DC–DC converter and the load. A
ﬁlter is able to transfer the average value of a signal to the load, while (almost totally)
blocking its ﬂuctuation around this average.
Some information on how ﬁlters can be made in practice will be provided in
Section 8.5.

More in Depth: Harmonic spectrum of the produced voltage.
This box can be studied at a second reading of the chapter, after reading
Section 8.4.
To gain better knowledge of how to deal with this voltage in circuits, it is useful to
examine its frequency spectrum. It is composed of a constant component U0, and
several harmonics. Two examples are shown in Figure 8.27.
Consider now the DC–DC converter shown in Figure 8.28. This circuit is designed
to transfer power from the lower voltage side (represented on the right-hand side of
Figure 8.28) toward the higher voltage side of the converter. It is thus called step-up
DC–DC converter (aka boost DC–DC converter).
The principle of operation is very similar to that of the step-down, and it can be
illustrated by referring to the plots shown in Figure 8.29. In this case also, the
inductance L must be so large as to keep substantially constant the current i2(t) ﬂowing
through it.

The shapes shown in Figure 8.29 can be explained as follows. During Tc, S is on,
and the current i2(t), coming from the source’s R–L, ﬂows through it; u2(t) will be zero
under our assumption of the idealized switch characteristic.
At the end of Tc, S is switched off (by action on its gate terminal, not shown in the
circuit). The inductance connected to the right-hand part of the basic converter will
prevent the output current from suddenly stopping, and therefore it will generate
overvoltage that acts in opposition to current reduction, and will be positive,
according to the signs shown at the L terminals in Figure 8.28. This will cause
the diode to switch on, and current to ﬂow through it, so that power is delivered to the
active load.
During Tc (disregarding the drop across R) it will be
uLt  Esrc
while Tb, on the contrary (again ignoring the drop across R), will be

Note that during Tc the current i2 will increase while during Tb it will decrease.

As the last DC–DC converter considered here, we now show a possible construction
of a step-up/step-down converter, as shown in Figure 8.30.
This is a combination of the two circuits previously described. When only switch
Su is operated, Sd is held continuously in off-state and the converter works as an
ordinary step-down converter; in this case the load/source in the ﬁgure operates as a
load (absorbing power).
When, on the contrary, Su is kept off and the on–off operation takes place only on
switch Sd, the converter operates as a step-up; in this case the load/source in the ﬁgure
operates as source (delivering power).
Applications of this kind of converter are common. An interesting example is
vehicle propulsion.
Consider a battery–electric vehicle. These vehicles get their power from a battery
which is charged from the mains when the vehicle is parked, but also partially during
braking. This is an advantage over conventional cars, in which kinetic energy is
converted into heat in mechanical brakes and is no longer usable.
A possible way to calculate the power train of an electric vehicle is shown in
Figure 8.31. Mechanical propulsion power is produced by a DC electric machine
that must be fed by a variable-voltage DC source (DC machines will be discussed
further in Chapter 10). The DC voltage needs to be slowly varied to accommodate
different vehicular speeds.
The propulsion energy is drawn from an electrochemical battery, whose voltage
varies in a way that is completely different from what is needed by the electric
machine. In this case a very good solution is to connect the battery to the machine by

means of a step-up/step-down converter of the type shown in this section, for which
U2  U1.
When the battery delivers power (e.g., when the vehicle accelerates or operates at
constant speed), the converter operates as a step-down and only switch Su is operated;
the higher the conduction ratio and U2, the higher the propulsion torque. When,
however, the vehicle has to brake, power is sent back into the battery by reversing the
power ﬂux: the DC machine converts mechanical energy into electricity, and this
power is sent back into the battery (excluding the unavoidable inner losses) so that it
can be stored inside the battery. This is achieved by operating the converter as a step-
up, keeping Su blocked off, and turning switch Sd on/off, using the technique seen
above. The higher the blocking ratio, the lower the braking action.
To summarize, in this example the converter has two roles:
• It adapts the voltage at its two ends to each other; this adaptation is dynamic,
since different voltage ratios correspond to different vehicular speeds.
• It transfers power from its left side to its right, and vice versa, as required for the
vehicle run. This allows the propulsion power to be positive or negative; in the
latter case, regenerative braking takes place.
8.3.3
Inverters
Inverters are, strictly speaking, converters designed to convert power from DC into
AC. However, today’s inverters have an internal structure that allows them to transfer
power in both directions, and therefore they can operate as either inverters or rectiﬁers
while being designated as inverters.
Thus, when the word inverter designates a converter, in today’s terminology it
indicates a bidirectional DC–AC converter; the inverter, in turn, can operate in inverter
mode and in this mode it actually converts from DC into AC, or in rectiﬁer mode and the
opposite is true.
To avoid confusion, it is therefore advisable to call these “bidirectional AC–DC
converters,” even though the more simple term “inverter” is much more common.
An AC–DC converter can be represented as a black box using drawings similar to
those already seen in the previous sections for rectiﬁers and DC–DC converters, as
shown in Figure 8.32.
Figures 8.32a and 8.32b show single-phase and three-phase inverters respectively,
without speciﬁc indications as to the allowable power ﬂux direction. Figure 8.32c
shows a three-phase inverter, explicitly indicating its bidirectional (or reversible)

power ﬂow capability. This is obtained by the bidirectional arrow shown in the lower
part of its rectangular shape.
There exist different types of inverters. One much-used classiﬁcation divides
current source inverters (CSIs) from voltage source inverters (VSIs).
The former interface with a DC circuit that can be modelled as a current source (the
DC current is somehow obliged to stay constant in the short term, e.g. using an
inductor in series, through which ﬂows the current entering the DC side of the
inverter).
VSIs, instead, interface with a DC circuit that can be modelled as a voltage source
(the DC voltage is somehow obliged to stay constant in the short term—e.g., using a
capacitor across the DC terminals of the inverter—so that the inverter DC voltage is
equal to the voltage across the capacitor).
VSIs have been increasingly used in recent years, while CSIs are used only for very
large power applications and other niche markets.
The inverters studied in detail in this section are all VSIs.
The inner structure of a (VSI) single-phase inverter is shown in Figure 8.33 and is
indicated as usual as a basic inverter by a dashed rectangle, in which a possible

connection to an R–L load is also shown. In the literature this structure is also called a
one-leg inverter; this terminology will be clearer later when two-leg and three-leg
inverters are introduced.
Remember that the controllable switch may represent any of the devices able to
operate as a controllable unidirectional on-off device (such as BJTs, GTOs, IGBTs,
etc., see Section 8.2).
This is a basic form, rarely used in practice but a useful starting point for our
discussion.
The inverter operation is determined by controlling the on/off state of switches Su
and Sd, acting on suitable signals that are sent from an electronic board called gate
driver. It is normal for the gate driver to be omitted in drawings so as to facilitate the
representation of the power part of the inverter circuitry; this approach is also adopted
here for the next ﬁgures.
The way in which Sd and Su are commutated is called the inverter’s switching
scheme. In all main switching schemes used in practice, and in particular all those
discussed here, Su and Sd are always in opposite states: when one is on, the other is off.
Therefore, whenever needed (as in the lower right-hand part of Figure 8.34), only the
state of Su is shown, since Sd is always its opposite.
The reader may object that the commutation of Su and Sd cannot be exactly simultaneous:
If commutation times are evaluated with sufﬁcient precision, it is logical to expect that
one commutates ahead of the other. This is correct: indeed, when switch commutation
takes place, the switch that is going to be commutated into the on state is switched a short
time after the other, in such a way as to ensure that Su and Sd are never on at the same
time. This is to avoid short-circuiting the two DC sources, which in theory would cause a
theoretical inﬁnity (in practice very high) current to ﬂow.
Once it is stated that Su and Sd must be operated with opposite states, it has to be
decided when to switch one on and the other off. Different switching schemes have
been introduced for this inverter.
In Figure 8.34 the one-leg inverter is again shown, along with the waveforms
obtained when the so-called square-wave switching scheme is used.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

We can understand how the inverter operates under this switching scheme by
separately analysing the time intervals in which Su is on and off.
When Su is on (and thus Sd is off), the voltage that appears at the load terminals, uo,
is equal to Us. The current could thus be evaluated simply by analysing what happens
in an Us–R–L circuit, exactly as seen in Chapter 5. The current shape is thus an
exponential curve, with the continuity condition that its value at the beginning of the
time interval started after a commutation must equal the value reached at the end of the
previous one (i.e., before commutation).
When Su is off, the load voltage is uo  Us; again, the load circuit is an Us–L–R
circuit, with the new value of the source (Us instead of Us).
A global representation of voltages and currents is in the top right-hand part of
Figure 8.34: the shape of the voltage might be deemed to be alternating with
distortion,3 and the same can be said of the current, although it has a different shape.
Note that the ﬁgure shows a transient starting from i  0, but after a few periods it
stabilizes at a shape which is nonzero at the beginning and end of each interval
between commutations (these values are opposite numbers).
As far as power is concerned, it was seen in Chapter 5 that the instantaneous power
of an AC circuit ﬂuctuates around an average. This is true also in this case: the
instantaneous and average powers relating to the circuit shown in Figure 8.34 are
shown in the upper right-hand part of the ﬁgure itself. The average power is positive
and corresponds to the average power converted into heat in R, while the instanta-
neous power has positive and negative values. If the diode and controllable switch
characteristic are those indicated as idealized in Section 8.2, the power delivered by
the two DC sources is exactly equal to that delivered to the AC load. In more realistic
situations it will be

PDC  pDC ≅PAC  pAC
The purpose of the anti parallel diodes is to allow current ﬂow when the voltage
changes its sign and the current has not yet changed its direction.
Consider, for instance, interval (t1,t2) in Figure 8.34. During this interval the
current path is as indicated in the top left-hand part of Figure 8.35: the current ﬂows
through the upper Us and Su. Then Su is switched off; the load voltage reverses, but the
presence of inductance L in the load impedes instantaneous change in the current
which is therefore forced to continue in the same direction as before. The current
cannot get to the load by ﬂowing through Su (open) or Du (the direction is opposite to
the diode direction) and therefore ﬂows through Dd. Indeed, even when a switch is on,
when current must ﬂow in the reverse direction, it will ﬂow through its antiparallel
3We have seen in Chapter 5 that what is called “alternating current” and “alternating voltage” indeed
indicates “sinusoidal current” and “sinusoidal voltage,” respectively. The shapes shown in the top right-
hand part of Figure 8.34 are not sinusoidal, but in some way are understood as “near to sinusoidal” or
“sinusoidal with some distortion added.” These concepts will be much clearer after Sections 8.4 and 8.5
have been studied.

diode. This is shown in the top right-hand part of Figure 8.35. During this interval,
however, the current path contains a voltage source Us, oriented so that it tends to
reverse the current direction. Therefore the current progressively reduces its value,
and at t  t3 reverses its direction.
In the interval (t3, t4) the situation is as depicted at the bottom of Figure 8.35. The
last situation (i.e., immediately after t4) is not examined here, but the reader is invited
to reﬂect on it to become accustomed to the behaviour of circuits containing
controllable switches with antiparallel diodes.
It can be concluded that in the inverter the current ﬂows through an antiparallel
diode whenever the delivered power is negative (i.e., actual power goes from AC
to DC).
The square-wave switching scheme is not very common since in order to vary the
amplitude of the output voltage, the amplitude of Us (i.e., of the DC input voltage),
must be varied, and this is not very desirable. This issue is overcome through use of
the PWM switching scheme.
The acronym PWM stands for pulse-width-modulation, since, as we will soon see,
the width (i.e., time duration) of pulses is continuously modiﬁed according to circuit
needs.
The PWM switching scheme can be analysed by referring to Figure 8.36. This
shows a triangular-shaped carrier wave c(t) with frequency fc  1/Tc, a control sine
signal s(t) with a sinusoidal shape, and the same frequency fs as required at the load
terminals.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

The ratio of signal amplitude to that of carrier wave is called amplitude modulation
ratio ma; ma  ^s=^c, and it will prove to be very important for controlling the inverter
operation.
The PWM switching scheme operates as follows:
• when s(t) > c(t) ) Su is on
• when s(t) < c(t) ) Su is off
The effects of this switching scheme can be seen in the curves shown in
Figure 8.37. Using this scheme, the circuit can again be analysed as a sequence
of Us–R–L circuits, in which the value of the source is either Us (at times in
which Su is on) or Us (when Su is off). Therefore, the current is a sequence of
exponential curves which, since their duration is very short, can be approximated
with straight lines.
This causes the current to have a shape of the type shown in the right-hand part of
Figure 8.37—that is, similar to a sinusoid as expected.
When the load of the PWM inverter is characterized by a large inductance (i.e.,
L/R  fc), and its behaviour depends just on this current (and not on the applied
voltage), the PWM inverter can feed it without the need of interposing ﬁlters. It will be
seen later that this is the case of three-phase machines (motors), which can be fed by

inverters that are a three-phase extension of the one shown in Figure 8.37 without any
interposition of ﬁlters.
To feed a load that requires to be fed by a near-sinusoidal voltage shape, a ﬁlter
must be interposed between the inverter and the load. This ﬁlter will have to transfer
to the load the fundamental component of the produced voltage (i.e., the sinusoidal
part) while (almost totally) blocking its ﬂuctuation around that sine wave (see also
Section 8.3.3.1).
A more precise deﬁnition of the fundamental component and an explanation of
how ﬁlters can be made will be provided in Sections 8.4 and 8.5, respectively.
More in Depth: Harmonic spectrum of the produced voltage
This box can be studied during a second reading of the chapter, after reading
Section 8.4.
To gain better knowledge of how to deal with voltage u0(t) in circuits, it is useful to
examine its frequency spectrum. This is composed of the fundamental component
bar, plus a group of harmonics around the carrier-wave frequency. Two examples
are shown in Figure 8.38.
The examples show a general situation: the harmonic content of the voltage
produced by a PWM inverter contains a bar in correspondence with the funda-
mental frequency (fk/f  1), then a group of bars around the frequency of the
carrier wave, here 20 times the fundamental frequency.
In between there is a region substantially devoid of harmonics.
It will be seen in Section 8.4 that this situation will greatly facilitate ﬁltering: a
ﬁlter has the purpose of allowing the fundamental component to pass through and
reach the load while blocking (or greatly reducing) the other components. It can be
intuited that the greater the distance separating what passes through and what is
blocked, the easier it is to ﬁlter.

It could be demonstrated that there is a very simple relationship between the
amplitude of the fundamental AC voltage component and the DC voltage:
^U1  maUs  maUDC=2
one-leg inverter
(8.4)
Therefore, it is very easy to control ^U1, by acting on ma, which is arbitrarily chosen by
the gate driver software.
The phase of the fundamental component of the voltage produced by the PWM
inverter can also be easily controlled, since it is equal to the phase of the sine signal
used inside the gate driver to generate the switch commutation signals (see again
Figure 8.36).
The single-phase inverter shown in Figure 8.33 requires that the DC side be split
into two parts and that the middle point be made available to the load. This split
is normally obtained by connecting two capacitors in series to each other and
connecting this series in parallel with a unique DC source. The point where the
two capacitors are connected to each other constitutes the midpoint connection
(compare Figure 8.43a).
Another scheme, very often used in practice to create a single-phase inverter, is the
so-called full bridge, or two-leg inverter, shown in Figure 8.39.
Switches are controlled in a similar fashion to the one leg inverter, since as it also
has two states:
• In up state, Slu and Srd are on and the other two switches are off.
• In down state, Slu and Srd, are off and the other two switches are on.
When the bridge is in an up state, the upper and lower terminals of the source Us are
in connection with the upper and lower terminal of the load, respectively, and u0  Us;

The shape of the voltage uo(t) does not differ from those shown in Figure 8.34 and

has the advantage of not needing user access to the central point of the DC source, and,

Finally, Figure 8.40 shows the arrangement used for three-phase inverters. The
switching scheme for each of the three legs is the same as the one seen for the one-leg
inverter. It can thus be either square-wave or PWM.
The three-phase bridge allows the generation of a three-phase system of voltages,
without the need to access the midpoint of the DC side. This can be easily obtained by,
for instance, considering the voltage uab(t) as a difference between, ua(t) and ub(t).
This is shown in Figure 8.41 for the square-wave switching scheme and in Figure 8.42
for PWM.
It is typical for an electric motor to be connected to the output terminals of the
inverter (terminals a, b, and c of Figure 8.40).
It could easily be demonstrated that for the three-phase line-to-neutral voltage,

More in Depth
The switching scheme described here as PWM is one of several adoptable PWM
techniques: every switching scheme that modulates voltages using pulses with
variable widths falls into this category. The PWM switching scheme described
here is more correctly called sine-PWM.
In recent years, for three-phase systems, the PWM technique called space-vector
PWM (SV-PWM) has become more and more common since it has the advantage
of allowing for a given DC source to obtain larger AC voltages, roughly 15%
larger than the sine-PWM.
From equation (8.5) the maximum line-to-line peak voltage is immediately

Using SV-PWM, instead, it is max ^Ull ≅UDC, which therefore allows better

reference [bm3].
8.3.3.1
Inverters for Sinusoidal Supply
All the inverter switching schemes
introduced in this section produce voltages that are far from sinusoidal, even though,
if the load contains a sufﬁciently large inductance, the absorbed current tends to be
much nearer to sine wave.
Inverters are normally directly connected to loads to feed motors; when a whole
network requires AC supply, near-sinusoidal waveforms, thus ﬁltering, is mandatory.
This applies to both single-phase and three-phase networks. This is summarised in
Figure 8.43, where the inverter switching scheme can be square-wave or PWM.

The ﬁltered voltage at the load side of ﬁlters is very near to the fundamental
component of the voltage appearing at their inverter side. How ﬁlters can be built and
how they operate will be discussed in Section 8.4.
The relationship between the amplitude of the fundamental component and DC
voltage is the same as that for the one-leg inverter:
^U1  ma
Us
2  ma

Therefore, acting on ma (compare with Figure 8.36), the amplitude of the voltage seen
by the AC network can be modiﬁed at will.
It has been mentioned that the networks feeding the AC networks in Figure 8.43
apply to the AC system quasi-sinusoidal voltages. Disregarding the deviation from
sine wave, they are thus AC sources, to which Thévenin’s equivalents apply. For
the purposes of this section the resistive part of Thévenin’s impedance can be
disregarded, and therefore Thévenin’s equivalent of inverter plus ﬁlter is simply
that represented in the left-hand part of Figure 8.44. Obviously, for three-phase
inverters the equivalent represents the single-phase equivalent of the three-phase
circuit.
It is very easy to express the relationship between the modulus of UTh and U and
their phase difference β and the active and reactive power that the inverter is able to

Note that in these equations P and Q are real numbers, which can have positive or

For instance, when β is negative, P is negative as well, and the inverter operates in
rectiﬁer mode; that is, it transfers net power from AC into DC.
The Thévenin electromotive force U Th is controlled by action on the sine voltage
of the gate driver:
• The amplitude of U Th is proportional to ma. Indeed, it can be seen that it is
^U Th ≅^U1  maUDC=2.
• The phase angle of U Th is equal to the phase angle of the control sine wave:
aTh ≅angleU 1  maUDC=2 and the angle of U 1 is the same as the sine-signal
of Figure 8.36.

or decrease in the angle of the PWM sine signal will imply an equal variation of angle
β; and any variation in the amplitude of that sine signal will cause a proportional
variation of UTh. Therefore, acting only on the PWM sine signal, the power ﬂuxes of
the inverter can be set arbitrarily, in amplitude and sign, according to equations (8.6).
This can be summarised as follows:
Result: P and Q control of a sinusoidal voltage PWM inverter
If a PWM inverter with ﬁltering is connected to a prevailing network, active and
reactive powers can be controlled in amplitude and sign by direct action of the

ANALYSIS OF PERIODIC QUANTITIES
8.4.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we introduced several power electronic converters. As already
mentioned, the waveforms of voltages and currents in these circuits are usually
far from sinusoidal. Therefore, in principle, none of the circuit analysis techniques
described in Chapters 5 and 6 based on phasors can be used.
However, all the waveforms, when systems are in steady state, are periodic
quantities; that is, they repeat themselves after a given time interval, called a period.
Some techniques to analyse circuits operating in periodic mode (i.e., with periodic
quantities) must therefore be introduced to enable us to analyse circuits based on
power electronics, and especially to understand how to ﬁlter quantities to obtain
quasi-constant values (for DC circuits and systems) or quasi sinusoidal shapes (for AC
circuits and systems).
This is the purpose of this section—that is, to deal with ways to analyse circuits
operating in periodic mode, by expanding and reusing the knowledge gained for
solving DC and AC circuits.
8.4.2
Periodic Quantities and Fourier’s Series
A signal x(t) that varies with time is said to be periodic if it repeats itself after a ﬁxed
time T, called period.
FIGURE 8.46. An example of a periodic quantity having T as period.
276
FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONIC POWER CONVERSION

An example of a periodic quantity is shown in Figure 8.46, which also shows how
all corresponding points share a horizontal distance equal to T.
More in Depth
A periodic quantity can be given a more formal deﬁnition; that is, a quantity x(t) is
periodic if a time T* exists so that
xt  xt  T*
for each possible value of t
If such T* exists, also 2T*, 3T*, and so on, share the same characteristic of
causing x(t) to repeat itself after that time:
xt  T*  xt
∀t ) xt  2T*  xt  T*  T*  xt  T*  xt
The period T of x(t) is deﬁned as the minimum of all the possible T*s.
The inverse of a signal period is its frequency f:
f  1=T
Frequency is measured in hertz: one hertz is the frequency of the signal having a
period of 1 s. It is also useful to deﬁne the radian frequency ω as follows:
ω  2π=T
The radian frequency is expressed in radians per second.
A very important result, called Fourier’s theorem, applies to periodic quantities.
Consider a generic periodic signal x(t), whose radian frequency is ω. Fourier’s
theorem demonstrates that under some assumptions regarding x(t), always satisﬁed in
the case of voltages, currents, and other circuit quantities, there exist two sequences of
real numbers a0, a1, a2, . . . and b1, b2, b3, . . . so that:
xt  a0

(8.7)
Relation (8.7) is called Fourier’s series of x(t). Fourier’s demonstration of this theorem
also provides a way to compute all the terms of the two sequences, that is,

It can easily be seen that the term outside the two summation symbols is x, that is, the
average value of x(t):
a0
2  x  1
T ∫
T
0
xt dt
The numbers of the two sequences tend to approach 0 when their subscripts tend to
inﬁnity. This is quite reasonable, considering that the two summations in (8.7) must
have a ﬁnite value—hence the practical and, for engineering purposes, necessary
decision to approximate the sums using their ﬁrst N terms:
xt ≅a0

N

The value of N depends on the objective of Fourier’s decomposition, but in practical
cases is kept below 40, often even below 20.

A0, as already noted, is the average value of x(t), while x1t  A1sin ωt  αk is
called its fundamental component; all the other terms of the summation in (8.8)
are called harmonic components of x(t): xkt  Ak sinkωt  αk is the harmonic
component at the frequency fk  kf. The set of harmonic components is called
harmonic contents of x(t). The number k equal to the ratio of kth harmonic
frequency and signal frequency is called harmonic order of the relative harmonic
component.
The average value of signal x(t) (i.e., A0), being constant over time, is also called,
when referring to circuits, the DC component of x(t).
In AC circuits it is usually desirable to have quantities that are as similar as
possible to sinusoids in shape. They will be so if, when decomposed into Fourier
series, all coefﬁcients of (8.8) except A1 are null. Very often A0 is null as a
consequence of the nature of the circuits, while the other terms are different from

The higher the THD, the higher the distortion, which means deviation from the sine-
wave shape. However, rigorous analysis must not also disregard A0.
International standards state the maximum voltage distortion in terms of individual
values of harmonic components, both for DC systems (for which all components Ak
with k 6 0 must be low in comparison with A0) and AC systems (for which all
components Ak with k 6 0 must be low in comparison with A1). In the case of AC
systems, N is taken6 as 40 or 50 and maximum acceptable voltage THD levels are 5%
or 8%.7
8.4.3
Properties of Periodic Quantities and Examples
Some characteristics of periodic quantities x(t) have immediate effects on Fourier’s
coefﬁcients—for example, the coefﬁcients in (8.7).
Here we mention only the half-wave symmetry because of its importance. A
periodic signal x(t) having a period T has half-wave symmetry if it is
xt  xt  T=2
for each value of t
An example of a x(t) with half-wave symmetry is shown in Figure 8.47.
Table 8.2 shows mathematical expressions of Fourier coefﬁcients for some typical
waveforms. Table 8.3 shows approximations obtained by summing limited numbers
of terms in their Fourier series. These give an idea on how the original waveforms are
produced with increasing accuracy as the number of terms grows.
FIGURE 8.47. Example of periodic signal with half-wave symmetry.

ANALYSIS OF PERIODIC QUANTITIES
279

The minimum approximation is constituted only by A0. For the half sine wave,
which has a nonzero average value, this can be useful.
The DC component with the addition of the fundamental component gives a
slightly better approximation of the waveforms, but still does not include much of the
information content of the original waveforms. The higher the number of harmonics,
the closer the reproduced form becomes to the original.
8.4.4
Frequency Spectrum of Periodic Signals
A very effective way of showing the harmonic contents of a signal x(t) is to plot the
amplitudes and phases of different harmonics as bar plots. This bar plot is normally
called frequency spectrum of x(t).
Since bar plots can also be made for phases of different harmonic components, the plots
in Figure 8.48 are more precisely indicated as amplitude (frequency) spectra, in contrast
with phase spectra, not shown here.
Just to give an idea, Figure 8.48 shows the frequency spectrum of amplitudes of the
square and saw-tooth waves (having unity amplitudes) already presented in Table 8.2.

The variable shown in the abscissa of the plots is the harmonic order of the various
harmonic components of the given signals. The bar corresponding to fk/f  0 refers to
the average of the signal A0; the bar corresponding to fk/f  1 is the fundamental
component. Perfect DC signals (e.g., the voltage across a DC voltage source) have a
frequency spectrum constituted by only one bar for fk/f  0; ideal signals (e.g., the
voltage across a AC voltage source) have a frequency spectrum constituted by only
one bar, for fk/f  1.

FILTERING BASICS
8.5.1
The Basic Principle
We saw in Section 8.3 that converters are not usually able to produce output voltages
as intended: converters designed to produce DC output produce voltages that have a
nonzero average, but whose shape is far from constant. Similarly, inverters, which are
intended to generate sinusoidal output voltages, produce voltages that have a nonzero
fundamental frequency, but are far from sinusoidal.
A ﬁlter is usually used to bring the output voltage closer to what was intended. This
is recalled in Figure 8.49, in which the subscript “u” stands for “unﬁltered.”
How can a ﬁlter obtain this result? Consider that the input voltage of the ﬁlter
uu can be expressed in a Fourier series (imagine that the summation is stopped at
the N-term):

A ﬁlter requested to ﬁlter DC voltages will have the purpose to leave unchanged
Uf0 ≅Uu0
and will have to reduce the size of the other components of the Fourier series:
Ufk  Uf0
with k > 0
Similarly, a ﬁlter required to ﬁlter AC voltages will have the purpose of leaving
unchanged
Uf1 ≅Uu1
and will have to reduce the size of the other components of the Fourier series
Ufk  Uf0
with k ≠1
In several cases, however, the component Uu0 is already much lower than Uu1, and
therefore a good ﬁlter could simply try to ﬁlter out Uuk when k > 1, while also
leaving Uu0 unchanged.
Filters vary in schemes and complexity. Very often ﬁlters are composed of
networks of the usual circuit components: resistors, inductors, and capacitors. A
very effective and widely used solution is to have an R and L in series and a C in
parallel (Figure 8.50).
Now let us try to verify whether this ﬁlter is able to fulﬁl its purpose—that is, to
transfer (almost), unchanged, the useful part of the signal, while (almost) blocking all
the other components.

If the ﬁlter is sized well, its effectiveness will not be inﬂuenced too much by the
presence of the load. This concept is used here, and the ﬁlter behaviour is analysed in a
condition in which the load is disconnected (no-load operation), under the assumption
that when the load is connected, ﬁlter effectiveness remains substantially unchanged.
Once the load is disconnected, the circuit is composed of the source whose input
voltage ui is supposedly known (a periodic quantity).
The circuit is as represented in the left-hand part of Figure 8.51. Since this circuit is
fed by a periodic quantity, phasor analysis cannot be directly used, since it applies to
sinusoidal circuits only. However, the input voltage uu can be decomposed as a
summationofsinusoidshavingdifferentfrequencies,accordingtoFourier’sseries(8.7):

This allows the substitution of the circuit in the left-hand part of Figure 8.51 with the one
inits right. Atthis pointthe superpositionprinciple canbeapplied,andthiscircuit canbe
solved by applying sources u0, u1, . . . , uN, one at a time. The N circuits shown in the

Therefore they can all be solved by using the usual phasor analysis. Once they are
solved, the complex vectors are converted back into functions of time, to ﬁnd the
functions of time of the original circuit.
This process can be used to ﬁnd the voltage between A and B terminals (the
terminals to which the load will be connected, uAB(t)  uf(t)). To do this, consider the
generic kth circuit shown in the right part of Figure 8.51. Since it is a single-frequency
circuit, it can be converted into the phasor circuit, shown in Figure 8.52. The generic
angular frequency is indicated as ωk (obviously ωk  kω).
Let us ﬁrst analyse this circuit, ignoring the resistance Rf. It is

angular frequency of the ﬁlter (and f 0  ω0=2π is called cutoff frequency).

Therefore, if (8.9) is valid, the harmonic voltages will be transferred from input to

zero as long as ωk increases. On the opposite side, harmonic components with a
frequency of

The values of U f=U u

If the computation U f=U u

 is repeated with a ﬁnite value of Rf, the asymptote
disappears from the diagram and is substituted by a peak (called resonance peak)
whose value depends on the value of Rf.
In general, the resonance peak depends only on the ratio of Rf and the resonance
reactance X0  ω0 Lf  1/(ω0 Cf), that is, the absolute value of the reactance of Lf and
Cf (they are equal to each other) at the resonance frequency ω0.
The values of U f=U u

 in the case of Rf  0:5ω0L as a function of ωk/ω0 are
shown in Figure 8.53 (continuous curve). The plot shows several points worth noting:
• For frequencies much lower than ω0 the output voltage is nearly equal to the
input (as was already observed through the analysis carried out while dis-
regarding Rf.
• For frequencies much greater than ω0 the output voltage decreases fast as
frequency grows: there is a ﬁxed slope that relates the two, indicated in the plot
as “ﬁnal slope.” This shows that for a 10-fold increase in the frequency there is a
100-fold decrease in voltage.
• The difference between the case with Rf  0 and the case with Rf  0.5X0 is
apparent only around ωk  ω0.
This suggests how to exploit this kind of ﬁlter to obtain our purposes: We must
determine the size of the ﬁlter in such a way that the useful part of the signal (DC
component or fundamental component) is located well to the left-hand side of
ω/ω0  1; on the opposite side, the components of the input voltages that we wish
to be reduced as much as possible shall be located in the right-hand part of ω/ω0  1.

In this way, when separately computing the harmonic components according to the
procedure described in Figure 8.51, the output voltage will have a very different shape
from the input one: the harmonic components well below ω0 will remain unchanged;
the ones well above this limit will be much reduced in size, while no non-negligible
harmonic component with frequencies around ω0 should be present. If there were
some, they would be ampliﬁed by an amount that depends on their vicinity to ω0;
moreover, the lower the Rf, value of the higher the ampliﬁcation factor.
The ﬁltering action of a ﬁlter can be evaluated by using, in the same plot, the
frequency spectrum of the ﬁlter input and the ratio U f=U u

.
This is shown in Figure 8.54 for a DC/DC converter (the height of the bars are the
amplitudes of uu(t) harmonic components divided by DC voltage).
It can easily be seen from the ﬁgure that if the frequency at which the DC/DC
converter operates is much greater than the resonance frequency of the inverter ω0, all
the harmonic components are dramatically reduced. In Figure 8.54 the ratio between
these two frequencies is 10, and the ﬁrst harmonic component, having an amplitude
that is 71% of the DC component, is reduced by a factor of 100; therefore, in the
output of the ﬁlter it will hardly be visible. The other harmonic components
are reduced even further.
Now it is clear how the ﬁlter output voltage has the shape shown in the right-hand
part of Figure 8.54, where the unﬁltered voltage input is also shown for greater clarity.
The example shown in Figure 8.54 refers to the case of c  0.7. Naturally, a similar
level of effectiveness will also be obtained with other values of c, since the ﬁrst
harmonic will always be at a frequency 10 times ω0 and therefore will be reduced by a
factor of 100, and the others will be reduced even further.
In a similar way, the same ﬁlter structure can dramatically enhance the quality of
the voltage at the AC terminals of a basic PWM inverter, as shown in Figure 8.55.
Here the carrier angular frequency was set at 10 times ω0. Again it can be seen both in
the frequency spectrum and in the time-domain plots that the ﬁlter effectively
improves the voltage output of the basic inverter.

The example shown in Figure 8.55 refers to the case of ma  0.8; a similar level of
effectiveness will also be obtained with other values of c, since the ﬁrst harmonic will
always be at a frequency of 10 times ω0 and therefore will be reduced by a factor of

SUMMARY
In this chapter we have seen that the advent of power electronics has made the
conversion of electric energy very ﬂexible.
It is possible to convert from DC to DC, by raising or lowering the voltage at equal
power (i.e., maintaining constant the product U ? I) and from AC to DC either one-
way, using a diode rectiﬁer, or bi in directionally, using an inverter which, despite its
name, can normally operate both in inverter modes and in rectiﬁer modes.
Power electronic converters operate by switching circuits; therefore, the voltages
and/or currents produced when creating a DC system are never really constant, but can
be rendered very nearly so by adequate ﬁltering action.
Similarly, converters required to create AC from DC actually create nonsinusoidal
(i.e., distorted) voltages and/or currents; however, particularly if the PWM technique
is adopted, these distorted quantities can easily be rendered quasi-sinusoidal by proper
ﬁltering action.
The faster the basic converter (i.e., the higher the commutation frequency), the
smaller and cheaper the ﬁlter. However, there is always a need to ﬁnd the right
compromise between speed and power: the fastest controllable switches are not able
to withstand large currents and/or voltages; that is, if hundreds of amperes or
thousands of volts are required, slower and stronger switches are needed (such as
GTOs).
The PWM inverters can generate AC at variable frequency and amplitude, with fast
and effective control also of the phase of the produced sinusoid (after ﬁltering).

SUMMARY

Therefore they can be used to feed variable-frequency motors, as will be seen in the
(following) chapters regarding electric machines and drives. They can also be used to
interface with AC networks to exchange, in either direction, either active or reactive
powers. This can be exploited, for instance, to interface a photovoltaic or wind plant
with the grid. This concept will be discussed with some degree of detail in Part IV of
this book.
When the converters are used to feed electric motors, ﬁlters are often omitted, since the
presence of large inductances inside the machines creates a natural ﬁltering action. Thus
the DC machine currents are much nearer to constant values and the AC machine
currents are much more similar to sine waves than the corresponding voltages. This will
also be seen in detail in the following chapters.

For the Instructor
This chapter aims to provide a basic understanding of the rotating machines
analysed in subsequent chapters.
In order to simplify the topic of electric machines, we take the radial component of
magnetic ﬂux density as sinusoidal.
The equation (9.1) is ﬁrst derived from Lorentz’s force equation (thus capitalizing
on electromagnetics knowledge) and then transformed into the forms (9.8) and
(9.9), which are easier for use in electric machines. The order in which the
numerical factors are written in these formulas was chosen so that the vector
(Lorentz’s force) equation, from which they derive, is in some way reproduced.
Equation (9.12) is called here (possibly for the ﬁrst time) Faraday’s law for
rotating coils; we believe this terminology will simplify learning.
We have followed a similar approach for forces and torque created on machine
coils which, starting from Lorentz’s force expression, produces ﬁrst (9.5), then
(9.10), and ﬁnally (9.13).
Today, electric machines are introduced with increasing frequency through the
space phasor concept. However, for this introductory book we did not deem this
powerful approach appropriate.

INTRODUCTION
Electricity in modern life is an energy carrier more than an energy source or sink.
Electric energy is rarely produced in nature; one example is lightning, a kind of
electricity not used by humans. Manmade electricity comes from other sources of
energy, such as the potential energy of water (in hydraulic power plants), or the
chemical energy of fuels like petroleum or natural gas (in thermal power plants), or
nuclear energy from nuclear forces. In all these examples, energy is ﬁrst converted
into mechanical energy, making shafts rotate, and then this mechanical energy is
converted into electricity, to be later transferred to load centres and used there.
On the other hand, electricity itself normally is not consumed directly but is instead
converted into other forms such as heat (ovens), mechanical power (motors), light
(lamps), and so on. One of the greatest uses of ﬁnal energy from electricity is again in
mechanical form, whenever electricity feeds electric motors.
There are, however, important cases in which electricity is consumed as electric energy
in addition to being a carrier—for example, in electronic appliances such as TV sets or
personal computers, which use electricity as electricity: any other possible forms of
energy must ﬁrst be converted into electricity before they can be used by these
appliances.
These examples illustrate the great importance of electromechanical conversion—
that is, conversion from mechanical energy into electricity, and vice versa.

ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION IN A
TRANSLATING BAR
Consider the system shown in Figure 9.1. It consists of a conducting bar b which
translates (i.e., it moves without any rotation) within a space where there is a uniform
magnetic ﬂux density B, at a constant speed v. The bar is in electric contact with two

rails rA and rB, which, in turn, are connected with the two terminals A and B of a
voltmeter measuring the induced electromotive force eAB.
Let the ﬂux density be orthogonal to the plane formed by this page and directed
downwards. This is indicated, as usual, by several plus sign.
The convention for indicating directions orthogonal to the page implies the use of a dot
() for quantities directed toward the observer (i.e., upwards from the page) and a plus
sign () for the opposite direction.
To remember this convention, the reader can visualize the situation with the help of the
sketch below, which shows a 3D arrow with a cross at its tail and a dot at the very end of
its tip.
Consider a positive charge q inside the conducting bar. It shares the bar speed and
because of this speed and the ﬂux density B, it will be subject to Lorentz’s force:
FL  qv  B
and will therefore be forced to move upward in our situation (remember the right-hand
rule for determining the result of a vector product). In a very short time, charge
separation will occur inside the bar, with positive charges accumulated in the top part
of the bar and negative ones accumulated at the bottom. The process stops when the
electric ﬁeld caused by the accumulated charge exactly matches Lorentz’s force, as
shown in the right-hand part of Figure 9.1:
FE  FL
and therefore
E  FE=q  FL=q  v  B
The rearrangement of charges inside the bar is very fast because of the tiny mass of
electrons; therefore, in nearly all applications of electrical engineering, this
rearrangement can be taken as being instantaneous.
Consider, now, the potential of the electric ﬁeld inside the bar:

Note that the polarity of eAB can be determined using the right-hand rule: if the thumb
is in the direction of v and the index ﬁnger in the direction of B, the tip of the middle
ﬁnger indicates the positive polarity of the induced EMF.
It is advisable to remember equation (9.1) by leaving the three factors in the given order;
this way, v and B are in the same order as in Lorentz’s law, and the induced EMF will
tend to push charges in the direction of Lorentz’s law.
Expression (9.1) is valid only when the directions of the sliding bar v, B, are all
orthogonal to each other. In rotating electrical machines the directions of the sliding
bars are always orthogonal to v, while B can have a different orientation. Therefore,
the following more general expression is of the utmost importance for rotating
electrical machines:
eAB  vB?l
(9.2)
This result, often called Hall’s effect, is a fundamental law for electromechanical
conversion:
Result: Faraday’s law for sliding conductors
If a conductor with length l is moving at a speed v orthogonal to the conductor
direction in a magnetic ﬁeld having density B, an electromotive force appears at
either end. Its value is e  vB?l, with polarity given by the right-hand rule, in
which B? is the component of B orthogonal to the plane deﬁned by v and l.
It is worth mentioning that the same result (9.1) would have been found by
considering that the bar, along with the rails and the connections with the voltmeter,
create a mesh, in which, in accordance with Faraday’s law, the following electro-
motive force is induced:
e  dϕ
dt  dl ? x ? B
dt
 lB dx
dt  vBl
(9.3)
Let us now slightly change the system by allowing some current to circulate in the bar
and the rails. The situation is depicted in Figure 9.2. The situation is pretty similar to
what happens in a circuit fed by an electrochemical battery, as examined in
Section 4.2.1. Lorentz’s force “pumps” charges upward inside the bar, and these
charges create, in the circuit outside the bar (rails, circuit containing resistor R), an
electric ﬁeld that causes the current i to circulate.
The very circulation of i causes the charges inside the bars to move vertically, thus
causing Lorentz’s force to act in an orthogonal direction to charge ﬂow. This is again
294
PRINCIPLES OF ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION

in accordance with Lorentz’s force expression, which, in the case of currents, takes the
form (see the Appendix)
dF  i dl  B  i  B ? dl
which is normally referred to as Laplace’s equation of electromagnetically induced
force.
Given that the current direction and magnetic ﬁeld are orthogonal to each other,
and considering the right-hand rule for vector products, the total force on the bar
will be

(9.4)
It is of great interest in electromechanical conversion to compute the component of F
in the direction of the sliding bar speed v.
Fv  iB?l
(9.5)
Equation (9.5) has the same importance in electromagnetic conversion as (9.2), thus:
Result: Force on a conductor carrying current inside a magnetic ﬁeld
If a conductor with length l carrying current i crosses a magnetic ﬁeld having
density B, a force orthogonal to l and B is generated, whose value is F  iBl, with
polarity determined by the right-hand rule. If the conductor is moving at a speed v,
the component of F along v is Fv  iB?l, in which B?is the component of B
orthogonal to the plane deﬁned by v and l.
The two equations (9.2) and (9.5) together constitute the basis for the analysis
methodology of electrical machines, or, better, electromechanical converters. By

ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION IN A TRANSLATING BAR

combining these two equations, for instance, we can easily ﬁnd the equation of
mechanical to electrical energy conversion. Indeed, to keep the bar b moving with
speed v, some external action is needed to produce a force that exactly counteracts the
one produced by (9.4).
This external force will then deploy the power
P  F  v  Fv ? v  iBl ? E
Bl  i ? e
(9.6)
where the values of Fv and v are taken from equations (9.5) and (9.1), respectively.
Equation (9.6) expresses the energy conservation law for electromechanical
conversion:
Result: Energy conservation in electromechanical conversions
When a conductor constituting part of a circuit loop moves in a magnetic ﬁeld,
voltages, currents, and forces are generated in such a way that it is
F  v  e ? i
Therefore, the mechanical power needed to keep the conductor moving is
converted into electrical power which is generated and deployed in the circuit.
Our analysis highlights the presence of force F on the sliding bar. Naturally, the
principle of action and reaction (Newton’s third law) requires that another force,
opposite F, must be generated. Indeed, it was not shown in the analysis how the ﬂux
density B was produced. We would have seen that other currents produced B, and
applying Lorentz’s force equation to these other currents would give rise to a force
system equivalent to a force opposite to F.
Our analysis of the system of Figure 9.2 shows a basic form of electric generator:
power is converted from mechanical into electrical form.
It is now very easy to construct a similar system capable of effecting the opposite
conversion. It can be structured as depicted in Figure 9.3. At the right-hand-side of the

two rail terminals A and B, a system capable of producing a voltage source e (e.g., a
battery, or another system with a sliding bar) is connected by the interposition of an
element which can be modelled as a pure resistor R. The current i will circulate in the
system which, if the resistance of the rails and the bar is disregarded as before, is
i  e=R
As a consequence of (9.5), this circulation of current will cause force F whose
orientation is found using the right-hand rule. This will tend to cause a movement of
the bar toward the right.
If the bar starts moving to the right with speed v, the mechanical power F  v  Fv
is produced and transferred to a mechanical system. For instance, if a new force F
counteracts F, mechanical power Fv will be transferred to the mechanical system
producing this force. At the same time, the speed v will cause the EMF vBl to be
produced and again it is
P  F  v  Fv ? v  iBl ? E
Bl  i ? e
(9.7)
So power conservation still applies. The system of Figure 9.3 is therefore a basic form
of electric motor.
9.3
BASIC ELECTROMECHANICS IN ROTATING MACHINES
9.3.1
Rotating Electrical Machines and Faraday’s Law
In the previous section, the principle of electromechanical conversion was shown for a
sliding bar.
A practical problem of the sliding bar is that it cannot be used for electro-
mechanical conversion in a limited space, due to the fact that the bar needs to move
further and further away. Another problem is that a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is an
abstraction and can only be obtained in limited regions of space.
The more natural way to exploit electromechanical conversion in practice as
shown for the sliding bar is to “curl” its path—that is, to perform a closed loop. This
concept is shown in Figure 9.4. Figure 9.4a shows the basic structure of a rotating
machine. The main elements of the machine are:
• A stationary (i.e., nonrotating) circular structure called stator, which is mechan-
ically connected to a mechanical support. The stator is made of ferromagnetic
material to ease the circulation of ﬂux density.
• A rotating part which, in principle, is cylindrical and able to rotate around its
axis. The drawings in Figure 9.4 show a view of the machine in a plane which is
orthogonal to the axis of rotation. The rotor is also made of ferromagnetic
material to facilitate the circulation of ﬂux density.
• The space between stator and rotor is constituted by air, to allow free rotation of
the rotor, and is therefore called air gap.
BASIC ELECTROMECHANICS IN ROTATING MACHINES
297

Given this structure, relative motion between magnetic ﬁeld and conducting bars
can be obtained by installing the conductive bars either in the rotor (Figure 9.4b) or in
the stator (Figure 9.4c). Here symbols N and S indicate “north pole” and “south pole”
respectively. By convention, the ﬂux exits from north poles and enters south poles.
In both cases, the machine can easily be analysed using one of the sliding bars, by
“rectifying” the air gap; this is done by imagining to cut it in the position in which
θ  2π and uncurling the cylindrical surface as a rectangle in a plane. In this rectiﬁed
representation, the radial component of magnetic ﬁeld density B is orthogonal to the
page and represented as usual by plus sign (downward) or dots (upward).
This process can be carried out for the air gap in Figures 9.4b and c, showing in
particular the situation of conductor a0, as shown in Figure 9.5. The position of a0 is
such that Br, measured with the given reference (a plus sign indicating the direction
with respect to the page), is positive.
The indicated speed v is the speed of the sliding bar, measured in a reference ﬁxed
to the map of B over space.

The direction of this is coherent with the situation depicted in Figure 9.4b—that is,
when the rotor has the angular speed Ω and the map of B over space is constant, or
rotates less than the rotor.
The direction of indicated speed v is also coherent with the situation depicted in
Figure 9.4c, where the map of B over space rotates at an angular speed Ω in the
direction shown in the ﬁgure.
In the bar position shown in Figure 9.5, Br has just passed its maximum and is now
decreasing.Thevoltageproducedat theconductorendsis,accordingto(9.2),eAB vBrl.
Note that the situations shown in Figures 9.4b and 9.4c deﬁne ﬁeld–conductor
interactions that are directly exploited in the most important electric machines. This
will be analysed with some details in the following chapters:
• DC machine: situation of Figure 9.4b with B map stationary.
• Synchronous machine: situation of Figure 9.4c with rotating B map.
• Asynchronous machine: situation of Figure 9.4b with B map and rotor both
rotating, but at different angular speeds.
The shape of the radial component of Br along the air-gap periphery is normally not an
exact sine wave. However, the machine is constructed in such a way that Br(θ) is a near-
sine shape.
Naturally, for all this to be useful, the voltage generated at the ends of conductors
must be captured and possibly applied to a load so that some current, and then power,
ﬂows through the load at the expense of mechanical power.

Figure 9.4, so they can be visualized in the axial section. The positions of the north
and south poles are also different, so that a radial component is present where the
conductors reside.
Moreover, to make the drawing more similar to what is done in practice, the two
conductive bars are shown inserted in slots (here square, and therefore represented by
white squares), which are grooves explicitly created in the stator so that the
conductors, and the insulating layer around them, can be inserted into the stator
during manufacture.
Figure 9.6 shows that when the two conductive bars are connected at one end of the
machine, the total EMF produced at the other end is the sum of the EMFs of the two
active conductors a and a0. The connections undergo negligible electromotive forces,
because the ﬂux density in the air surrounding the machine is scarce, due to the
concentration of ﬂux occurring in the space where iron is present.

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION

It must be noted that in order to apply the right-hand rule and to determine the
polarity of induced voltages, the velocity v to be taken into account is the velocity of
the conductor relative to the ﬁeld, and not vice versa. This is the reason why the
conductor a, a v directed to the right, should be considered, since the magnetic ﬂux
density B is imagined to be produced by the rotor and is ﬁxed to it, thus rotating
counterclockwise.
Equation (9.8) can be further processed considering that in the machine it is
v  ΩR, R being the radius of the coil—that is, the distance of the conductor centre
from the machine centre—and 2Rl can be assumed to be the coil effective surface
area A. Therefore it is
eturn  2lΩRBr  ΩBr A
(9.9)
Note that equation (9.9) gives the EMF produced by the couple of conductors a–a0,
while Br is the radial ﬂux density corresponding to conductor a, which will therefore
be called the base conductor of the couple a–a0.
It should be explicitly noted that equation (9.9) is valid whatever the shape of Br(θ).
However, in practical machines, as already mentioned, all efforts are made so that this
shape resembles a sinusoid as closely as possible, as already shown in Figure 9.5.
Given the introductory nature of this book, a sinusoidal shape of Br(θ), and
therefore of eturn, will always be assumed. For a sinusoidal shape, along with a rotor
rotating at constant angular speed Ω, equation (9.9) becomes:
eturn  ΩBA sinΩt  θ0

Generation of Torques in Rotating Machines
Let us now consider what happens in our two-wire coil when its two terminals are
connected to a load. We only consider what happens in steady state—that is, when all
transients are complete.
The situation is depicted in Figure 9.7, showing a physical representation to the left
of terminals A–B and an equivalent circuit on the right. The torque created by the

force applied to the bar displayed in the right part of the ﬁgure, with respect to the
rotational axis, will be [see equation (9.5)]:

where, considering the turn constituted by this bar and the opposite one, A  2Rl is the
area of the turn. Therefore,
Tturn  2Tbar  iBr A
(9.10)
Equation (9.10) is the twin equation (9.9) and is also very important.
It should ﬁrst be noted that the torque acting on the turn, as a consequence of
Newton’s action and reaction law, is numerically equivalent to the one acting on the
machine rotor.
Thus, replicating what was seen in equation (9.7), it is immediately apparent that
P  TΩ  iBrA ?
e
BrA  i ? e
(°)
which conﬁrms that the electric power absorbed by the turn is perfectly equal to the
one generated on the machine’s rotor.
The requirement of operating in steady state to produce this result is important, since
during transients the variation of current i will imply some accumulation of energy in the
machine’s magnetic ﬁeld, and therefore the electric energy is partly stored as magnetic
ﬁeld energy and partly converted into mechanical form. Indeed the machine acts as an
inductor and inductors accumulate energy, in accordance with the law already seen in
Chapter 5: E  1=2Li2. In three-phase machines a generalization of (°) applies (as will
be further discussed in the next chapters with the form P  i1 ? e1  i2 ? e2  i3 ? e3).
The behaviour of the system in Figure 9.7 is that of a basic electric motor.
If the system outside the machine generates electric power and the current ﬂow is
reversed at equal voltage polarity, the system will behave as an electric generator:
Electric power will be converted into mechanical power.
Again, in the following chapters these concepts will be used to create more realistic
DC and AC electric motors.
9.3.3
Electromotive Force and Torque in Distributed Coils
In the basic analysis of rotating machines performed in the previous two sections, the
coil was assumed to have a single turn. In reality, this would generate too little
voltage; this is easily seen using equation (9.9), considering that in normal iron the
peak value of B is just over one tesla. A one pole-pair machine with a coil surface of
2 dm2, with a rotor rotating at 3000 rpm, would have just 6–7 V of peak voltage.
302
PRINCIPLES OF ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION

To use N turns with large values of N is not as easy as in transformers, because of
the different physical structure of the machine. However, signiﬁcantly larger numbers
of turns per coil can be obtained by distributing the turns along the air gap, according
to the scheme shown in Figure 9.8.
It is obvious that the EMFs generated in each turn are not in phase with each other,
because of the angular displacement between one coil and the adjacent one. Therefore,
differently from transformers, the voltages on different turns do not sum algebraically,
but as vectors; the result is that the peak of the total induced electromotive force is
lower than N times the peak of EMF induced on a single turn. The EMF induced on a
coil with area A will therefore be
ecoil  kwNΩBr A
(9.11)
where
• N is the number of turns per pole per phase;
• kw, called the winding distribution factor, takes into account the fact that the
sum of single EMFs has an amplitude lower than N times the single EMFs1;
• Br is radial induction at the centre turn of the coil (a2 in Figure 9.8).
We can introduce the ﬂux ϕ  BrA and the linked ﬂux ψ  kwNBrA  kwNϕ;
therefore equation (9.11) can be written as
ecoil  Ωψ
(9.12)
Equation (9.12) constitutes a special version of equation (A.11) and will therefore
sometimes called in this book Faraday’s law for rotating machines.

numerical value of kw considers all these details. For more information on this, see reference [bm1].

303

A similar procedure can be followed for torques, and therefore the (9.10) for a
distributed coil with N turns will become:
Tcoil  kwNiBr A  ψi
(9.13)
Again, considering that the torque acting on the coil must be equal (by Newton’s
action–reaction law) to a torque generated on the machine’s rotor, mixing (9.13) and
(9.11) it is immediate that
P  TΩ  i ? e
that is, again the electric power associated with i and e is converted into mechanical
power generated in the machine’s rotor.
9.3.4
The Uniform Magnetic Field Equivalent
Although the radial component Br(θ) of magnetic ﬂux density as a function of the air-
gap angle θ can have a large variety of shapes, it was already noted that in actual
machines, very often the manufacturer tends to realise a sinusoidal shape. This
hypothesis is always taken for granted from now on.2
Beq
θ
θB
Br(θ) = B cos(θB – θ) =
B sin(θ – θB+ π/2) 
Br
r
Remember that a sine wave can always be expressed as a translated cosine.
Therefore the two formulas immediately above the sketch are equivalent if θ0c 
θ0s  π=2 (subscripts “c” and “s” stand for “cosine” and “sine”). The same radial
component of magnetic ﬂux density can be obtained considering a uniform distribu-
tion Beq having in all points of space a modulus with a maximum value of Br; the
actual ﬂux has direction the same as that of a vector with its tail in the rotor’s centre
and its head in the air-gap point in which Br is maximum.
This can be easily veriﬁed looking at the sketch above: the projection of Beq on a
generic ray r constitutes a sinusoidal wave:
Brθ  B sinθ  θ0s  B cosθ  θ0c
2In reality, actual machines implement a shape that is sinusoidal with θ, but can contain more than one
period in a complete rotation around the air-gap circumference: Brθ  B sinpθ  θ0, where p is an integer
number ﬁxed for a given machine. This will be explained in the next chapter, but does not cause loss of
generality of the reasoning shown here.
304
PRINCIPLES OF ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION

where
θ0s  θB  π=2;
θ0c  θB
Therefore in all cases in which the Br shape is sinusoidal—that is, in all cases dealt
with in this book—instead of considering the actual map of B, such as those depicted
using force lines in Figures 9.4b and 7.4c, just a single uniform equivalent ﬁeld can be
considered:
Result: The uniform equivalent magnetic ﬁeld
Therefore in all cases in which the Br shape is sinusoidal, instead of considering the
actual map of Beq, we can consider an equivalent uniform ﬁeld whose modulus is
equal to Br(θ), and whose direction has its tail in the rotor’s centre and its head in
the air-gap point where Br(θ) is maximum. This ﬁeld is called “uniform equivalent
magnetic ﬁeld”.
This result will obviously ease the analysis and will be well exploited in the
following chapters.
When rotating machines operate, as has already been noted, the corresponding
wave of radial ﬂux density translates in a θ–Br Cartesian diagram (Figure 9.5), or,
equivalently, the map of B force lines rotates. Using the uniform magnetic ﬁeld
equivalent, it is simply a matter of visualizing a unique Beq rotating.
This rotation is very similar to the rotation of phasors representing sinusoidal time
functions (remember the theory of phasors in Chapter 5). Therefore this rotating ﬁeld
equivalent is called, in modern analysis of rotating machines, space phasor. Space
phasors are a very powerful tool to analyse electric machines, but, because of its
introductory nature, it will not be used in this book.
9.4
RELUCTANCE-BASED ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION
In the previous sections, electromechanical conversion was obtained using the
principle of the translating bar, in which there is explicit interaction between the
moving charge in the translating bar, and an external magnetic ﬁeld produced by other
means.
It is, however, also possible to produce or absorb mechanical power using current
that interacts with the ﬁeld it produces.
These cases are normally studied through use of magnetic circuit reluctance, which
has been used several times already in this book; in this chapter the corresponding
conversion is therefore called reluctance-based electromechanical conversion.
The principle of reluctance-based electromechanical conversion can be understood
by analysing an electromagnet (Figure 9.9). In this example, the moving armature
rotates around a pivot, thus causing the air-gap length x to vary.
RELUCTANCE-BASED ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION
305

A simple evaluation of the force generated on the armature by the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld in the magnetic circuit is carried out by ignoring any energy dissipa-
tion, and in particular the energy dissipated in the coil resistance and in the pivoting
hinge friction. Under this assumption, for an inﬁnitesimal increase dx in the air gap,
the following energy balance applies:
dE e  dE m  dWx
(9.14)
where
dE e  eidt  idψ  idLi  i2dL  Li di
dE m  d 1
2 Li2


 1
2 i2dL  Li di
dWx  F dx
(9.15)
where dE e is the electric energy absorbed by the electromagnet and dE m and dWx are,
respectively, the corresponding increase in the energy accumulated in the magnetic
ﬁeld and the mechanical work produced. As a consequence of these signs, F is
positive when it tends to increase x. Substituting the (9.15) into (9.14) gives
Fdx  dE e  dE m  1
2 i2dL
)
F  1
2 i2 dL
dx
(9.16)
To ﬁnd a practical estimate of the force based on the general equation (9.15), consider
that the reluctance of the whole magnetic circuit is composed of the sum of the
reluctance of its iron and air-gap parts3:
Rtot  RFe  Rag  lFe
μFeA 
x
μagA ≅Rag
(9.17)

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION

where lFe is the length of the iron part of the line over which the ﬁelds B and H lie
(dashed in Figure 9.9) and A is the cross-sectional area of the magnetic circuit.4 The
approximate equality is justiﬁed by the fact that the iron magnetic permeability is
usually thousands of times more than the permeability of air and this prevails,
whenever x is not very small, over another characteristic of the circuit—that is,
that lFe  x.
When the approximation in (9.17) is made, equation (9.16) becomes

(9.18)
Therefore the force is negative and tends to attract the armature toward the rest of the
magnetic circuit.
Equation (9.18) is often shown in textbooks in other, equivalent forms, that is,
F   1
2
B2A
μ
  1

ϕ2

These forms are practical to evaluate the force when a permanent magnet is involved,
of which the magnetic ﬂux ϕ is usually known.
It also shows that, within the limits of its applicability, the lower the area A of ﬂux
passage, the higher the force produced. This is exploited in practical electromagnets,
in which the area A is kept rather small.5
The mechanical work dWx is produced at the expense of other systems.
The balance of the three energies shown in (9.14) depends on how the electric
circuit is fed. It is traditional (and useful) to consider the two special cases separately:
1. Electric circuit feeding at i _const.
From (9.15) it is
dE m
dx  1
2 i2 dL
dx ;
dE e
dx  i2 dL
dx
Therefore when the current is constant, and x reduces, energy is drawn from the
circuit that is equally shared between mechanical work and accumulation in the
magnetic ﬁeld:
dWx  dE m
4For a more precise evaluation, A should be slightly adjusted to take into account the fact that the magnetic
ﬁeld force lines are more dispersed in the air gap, and therefore the actual surface of the passage of B is a bit
larger than A.
5Not too small, otherwise the hypotheses under which the formulas are drawn are no longer valid. For
instance, small sections which are too small cause iron to saturate, thus reducing the force produced.
RELUCTANCE-BASED ELECTROMECHANICAL CONVERSION
307

2. Electric circuit feeding with energy _const.
From (9.14) it immediately follows that
dE m
dx   dWx
dx   1
2 i2 dL
dx
It is clear, therefore, that when no energy is supplied by the external circuit,
mechanical work is produced at the expense of the previously accumulated
magnetic energy.
Principle of minimum reluctance
Let us consider again equation (9.16):
F  dWx
dx  1
2 i2 dL
dx
This says that in a magnetic circuit (operating at constant current), forces are
generated that tend to raise the circuit inductance. Since it is also
L  N2=R
this force tends to minimize circuit reluctance. In the example of Figure 9.9 the
process continues up to when x  0; the reluctance is minimized since the part of it due
to air gap Ra is no longer added.
This explains that all magnetic circuits always tend to reach a condition of
minimum reluctance; this fact is sometimes called the principle of minimum reluc-
tance. This principle is exploited not only in electromagnets, but also in some rotating
machines, called reluctance machines and switched reluctance machines.
Although these have applications of some importance, they will not be dealt with
further in this book and the interested reader is advised to refer to more speciﬁc
textbooks, such as [bm1] or [bm4].

DC MACHINES AND DRIVES
AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS
For the Instructor
It is well known that DC machines are increasingly substituted by AC machines,
since their competitiveness in variable speed drives is greatly reduced by the lower
cost of inverters. However, this chapter has been included in this book for the
following reasons:
• DC machines have not yet abandoned the market, and they are forecast to be
around for years to come.
• The operation of linear DC machines and drives is very simple and can be a
useful introduction for students to more complex machines and drives.
However, if time is insufﬁcient, the teacher may choose to omit this chapter and
directly proceed to the next one.
As explained in the “For the Instructor” box of Chapter 8, the reader is not required
to study power electronics before approaching this chapter. Conversely, readers
who have already studied Chapter 8 will ﬁnd an interesting recapitulation of
electronic converters in Section 10.6, which deals with electric drives for DC
motors.

10.1
INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, the phrase “electric machine” refers to either a transformer or a rotating
electric machine. This is justiﬁed by the fact that transformers share many physical
similarities with rotating machines: both are based on magnetic circuits made of
ferromagnetic materials in which variable ﬂux is produced, so that EMFs are
generated by Faraday’s law action.
Rotating machines are also based on the principles of electromechanical conver-
sion discussed in the previous chapter. The majority of machines used in practice are
AC machines. However, it is common for basic textbooks to also examine DC
machines. This approach is followed in this book for the following reasons:
• The reader has already studied DC circuits and may wish to see how this type of
electric energy can be used to generate mechanical power.
• Machines which are structurally very similar to simple DC machines are used
very frequently as single-phase AC motors (universal motors).
• Small DC machines are still used whenever a DC source is easily and cheaply
available—for example, on board vehicles, where the basic energy source is an
electrochemical battery.
Nevertheless, because of their reduced use nowadays, we will deal with DC
machines in a particularly simpliﬁed way.
10.2
THE BASIC IDEA AND GENERATION
OF QUASI-CONSTANT VOLTAGE
The general arrangement of a DC machine is shown in Figure 10.1. It is composed of a
stationary part: the stator; a rotating part: the rotor; and a space of air, called air gap,
between the two.
The stator contains a winding made by connecting in series all the conductors
shown in the cross section in the ﬁgure. A simpliﬁed idea on how these connections
are made can be inferred from the small sketch shown in the lower part of Figure 10.1.
This winding, called ﬁeld winding for reasons that will be clear presently, is
connected to a DC source and is therefore traversed by a DC current.
To analyse what happens in the machine, the ﬁeld winding current can be imagined
to be ﬂowing according to the signs indicated in Figure 10.1; that is, it leave the page
surface when a small dot is shown in the conductors, and enters it when a cross is
shown (to understand the rationale beyond this graphical code, the reader is advised to
revert to Section 9.2).
By effect of this current, a magnetic ﬁeld is created, whose force lines ﬂow in the
stator, traverse the small air gap, enter the rotor, traverse it, and then return to the
stator, as qualitatively indicated in Figure 10.1. As mentioned in Section 9.3.1, by
convention magnetic ﬂux abandons north poles (indicated with N), and enters south
poles (indicated as S).
310
DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

In basic analysis of DC machines and in this book also, the ﬁeld H produced in the
air gap, and therefore the corresponding ﬂux density B, can be assumed to be uniform.
B will be proportional to the current If circulating in the ﬁeld winding.
The two machines represented in Figure 10.1 differ from each other with regard to
their pole pairs: the machine on the left has one pole pair, while the one on the right
has two; machines can have even more pole pairs. In all cases, all the windings are
connected in series, and are thus traversed by the same current. The analysis of the
machine behaviour that will be proposed presently is based on the interaction between
rotor conductors and the ﬂux density produced by the stator and is therefore applicable
to either type of machine. Some differences between the two will be discussed later.
The rotor of a DC machine contains conductors at its periphery, as represented in
Figure 10.2.
These conductors are inserted into slots, which are spaces from which iron has
been removed, and are able to keep the conductors mechanically tightly connected to
(but electrically insulated from) the basic iron structure of the rotor.
In the terminology of electric machines, the armature is the part of the machine in
which an EMF is induced by Faraday’s law. Therefore, in a DC machine the armature
is the rotor. In other machines (such as the synchronous machine, as will be seen in
Chapter 11) it is located in the stator.

THE BASIC IDEA AND GENERATION OF QUASI-CONSTANT VOLTAGE
311

The rotor conductors are connected to each other by means of connections not
shown in Figure 10.2, in such a way that the voltage across the collectors are the sum
of all the voltages appearing in the two (left and right) parts of the rotor.
The two collectors are shown in Figure 10.2 (as black elements) in a position
different from the real one, as will be commented below (when the commutator is
discussed); however, the real position of the collectors is electrically equivalent to the
one in the ﬁgure.
In fact even in the real position the two collectors, which must be imagined to be
made of conductive material (e.g., carbon), are continuously in close, but sliding,
contact with the rotor, so that from time to time it is in electric connection with the
two extreme conductors (the highest and the lowest). Each rotor conductor moves
in the uniform ﬂux density distribution B and has a local speed v, whose amplitude
is ΩR (R being the rotor’s radius) but whose direction is different from one
conductor to another. On each conductor, an electric ﬁeld will be generated (see
Section 9.2):
Ec  v  B
which will produce a potential difference on the conductor:
ect  vB?l  v^Bl sinΩt  αc
(10.1)
This varies as a sine wave with time, and the angle αc is speciﬁc for each conductor.
For instance, in the position shown in the left-hand part of Figure 10.2, the angle of
conductor 4 is αc  α4  30°.

312
DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

As long as the rotor rotates, the collectors connect to different conductors, so that
the total EMF E shown in the right-hand part of Figure 10.2, and corresponding to the
instantaneous sum the voltages generate on half-conductors (left or right half), always
maintains roughly the same amplitude.
More precisely, the amplitude ﬂuctuates slightly, since it is always equal to the vertical
distance connecting the upper and lower points of the polygon shown in the right-hand
part of Figure 10.2.
This EMF is thus is composed of an average, to which a slight ﬂuctuation is
superposed. Ignoring this small ﬂuctuation, we can write
E  kNav^Bl
k is a dimensionless factor that can be easily demonstrated to be equal for the armature
structure illustrated in Figure 10.2 and for large numbers of conductors, to 2/π. Na is half
the number of armature conductors (it is 6 in the example of Figure 10.2).
Other machine structures have different values of k, which is, however, always a ﬁxed
dimensionless number for a given machine.
Furthermore, if we consider that it is v  ΩR (R being the rotor radius), it will be
E  kNaΩR^Bl  kNaΩΦ
(10.2)
and ﬁnally, considering the new variable Ψfa  kNaΦ, linked ﬂux with armature:
E  ΩΨfa
(10.3)
The procedure followed is very similar to that shown in Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.3 for
AC machines. The student is recommended to re-read this analysis and make
comparisons.
The ﬂux Φf, in turn, is produced by the ﬁeld winding and is proportional to the ﬁeld
current If:
Φf  Lf=NfIf
(10.4)
The proportionality factor between Φf and If is written as Lf/Nf since, if Nf indicates
the number of turns of the ﬁeld winding, Lf has a precise meaning: it is the inductance
of the ﬁeld winding.

313

Thus,
Ψfa  kNaΦf  k Na
Nf
LfIf  LmIf
with
Lm  k Na
Nf
Lf
This may also be written as τ  k Na
Nf
; Lm  τLf. The quantity τ is called turns ratio of
the machine.
The rotor conductors are linked to a commutator, which contains conductive
segments separated by small layers of insulating material, as depicted in Figure 10.3.
The conductive elements are connected to the active conductor in the rotor periphery,
creating a situation that reproduces the principle scheme of Figure 10.2.
The collector is mounted on the machine shaft, and the conductive sectors are
connected to the rotor active conductors and rotate with the rotor; the brushes do not
rotate and are pressed using special springs against the commutator. The brushes are
made of a carbon-based material, which is much softer than copper so the sliding
tends to wear out the brushes rather than the commutator. Although this means that
they have to be periodically replaced, this dramatically reduces the wear and tear of
the commutator, which would be much more expensive to replace.
In a reference integral with the rotor, the ﬂux produced by the stator poles rotates,
and therefore the rotor of the machine must be laminated.1 The stator, instead, is
subject (except for the tips) to constant ﬂux and does not need to be laminated.
However, it often happens that manufacturers laminate all parts of their DC machines,
simply because it facilitates machine assembly or because it makes the manufacturing
process easier as a whole.
If the machine is operated with a continuously varying ﬁeld current, stator lamination
also reduces losses.

10.3
OPERATION OF A DC GENERATOR UNDER LOAD
In the previous section it was seen that a DC machine is composed of a stator, which
contains a coil to be fed in DC, and a rotor, to which two brushes are connected to
gather the voltage produced by the interaction of the stator ﬁeld and the rotor motion.
This is summarized in Figure 10.4a, in which the brushes, in turn, feed a DC load.
The system shown in Figure 10.4a can be sufﬁciently modelled using the circuital
equivalent shown in Figure 10.4b.
In fact, since the ﬁeld coil is fed by an external DC source, it is constituted by a
simple DC circuit, and the ﬁeld current If is simply If  Ef/Rf, where Ef is the voltage
applied to the ﬁeld winding.
The armature of the DC machine can be modelled by means of an electromotive
force, whose value is given by (10.2), an inner resistance, corresponding to all the
conductors that constitute the armature winding (active conductors, connections
between them), and an inductance that has effect only during transients, when current
Ia varies with time.
In the case of Ia which is constant or slowly varying, it will be
Ia  E=Ra  RL  kNaΩ=Ra  RL
From the equivalent circuit of the machine, the U–I characteristic can also be easily
determined. Ideally, this has the shape shown in Figure 10.4c. Indeed, in the case of
real machines, the nonlinear behaviour of the iron that constitutes stator and rotor
causes the actual characteristic to be nonlinear; this, however, is beyond the scope of

this book. For small armature currents, the actual machine characteristic can be
assumed to be linear.
The current ﬂowing in the machine armature (i.e., in the rotor) will ﬂow in the
active conductors in the rotor periphery, as shown in Figure 10.2. This will produce a
force on each rotor conductor generated according to Lorentz’s law:
F  I  B ? l
where I has as amplitude the current Ia and the conductor’s direction, and l is the
length of the conductor. These forces will have tangential components Ft whose
amplitudes will depend on their position (Figure 10.5).
The set of all these forces will globally create a torque that will evidently be
proportional to the current Ia, the stator ﬂux Φf and the number of conductors
(remember that Na is half the number of armature conductors):
T  kNaΦfIa
(10.5)
It would be easy to demonstrate that the constant k of equation (10.5) is exactly the
same as the one that appears in equation (10.2). Assuming this, we obtain
T  IaΨfa
(10.6)
Considering equation (10.3), we have ﬁnally
TΩ  EIa
(10.7)
Equation (10.7) is very important, since it states the basic electromechanical
conversion in the DC machine: the power inserted into the system as mechanical
power TΩ is converted into an electrical form, generating the power EIa.

DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

Equations (10.8) must be combined with the equation of the electrical circuit created
when the machine is connected to a source with voltage U. This circuit is shown in
Figure 10.6.
Between the EMF E and the terminal voltage U, there are two circuital
components:
• The resistance Ra, which takes into account the resistance of the conductors
making up the machine’s armature.
• the armature inductance La. This causes a voltage drop that tends to counteract
any variation in the armature current Ia: uLa  LadIa=dt.2 Its presence is
justiﬁed, considering that when the current Ia ﬂows in the machine’s armature
it creates a magnetic ﬁeld across the machine. Associated with this ﬁeld there is
an armature ﬂux Ψa  LaIa.
Example 1. A DC generator runs at n  1000 rpm, supplying 200 V to an electric
load. If the stator ﬂux per pole Φf is 25 mWb, the constant kNa equals 90 and the
armature copper losses are 300 W, calculate:
(a) the electromotive force E
(b) the armature current Ia
(c) the armature resistance
(d) the electric power Pe provided to the load
(e) the mechanical power Pm and the torque T required to move the generator
(f) the efﬁciency, ignoring the losses in the ﬁeld winding
For steady-state studies, we can use a model where the armature inductance La does

DIFFERENT TYPES OF DC MACHINES
In the previous description, the operation of the DC machine as a generator was taken
as reference. Although this operation of DC machines was common in the past,
nowadays it is obsolete. It was proposed here because it is simpler to introduce the DC
generator ﬁrst rather than the motor. In Section 10.4.1 we will look at how the DC
machine operates as a motor.
Moreover, in the previous description, the ﬁeld current If was generated using an
independent DC source on the armature circuit. This corresponds to the independent
excitation DC machine which is not very frequently used, since it requires that an
independent DC source is available. In Section 10.4.3 other important ways to create
the ﬂux density B in the machine are introduced brieﬂy, with reference to its operation
as a motor, which, as we have just said, is the only one used today.
10.4.1
Generators and Motors
The DC machine is intrinsically reversible and can therefore operate as a generator or
as a motor. In the upper part of Figure 10.7, where generator operation is shown, the
shaft is connected to a mechanical source of power, and the electrical load is
connected to the armature. Some means of generating the ﬁeld must be provided,
and this can be done in several ways, as will be discussed in Section 10.4.3. Here, for
simplicity sake, we refer to a DC source, which is totally independent from the
armature circuit.
In the lower part of the ﬁgure, instead, motor operation is depicted. The armature is
to be connected to a DC source; some source of current is to be provided, as before, for
the ﬁeld coil. The motor generates mechanical power, which is transferred to the
mechanical load through the machine shaft.
318
DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

The right-hand part of the ﬁgure shows a circuit equivalent to the arrangements
shown in the left part. The only difference is in the reference sign assumed for current
Ia, which is combined with the voltage reference signs according to generator and
motor conventions respectively.
Naturally, inductances play a role in the circuits only during transients, since when
in steady state the voltage across them is null.
Understanding what happens in the machine when it is operating as a motor is
simply a matter of repeating the reasoning behind its operation as generator, though in
a slightly different order. This is rapidly done in this section.
Consider that the machine is initially still. Its connection to the sources causes a
ﬂux density B to be created inside the machine, and an armature current to ﬂow in the
rotor active conductors. The two interact and Lorentz’s forces are generated:
F  I  B ? l
which globally produce a torque T that will make the rotor start rotating according to
equation (10.5):
T  IaΨfa

Similarly to when it operates as a generator, the electric power EIa is converted into
the mechanical power T:
EIa  TΩ
(10.9)
The general equations of the DC machine (10.8) are therefore still valid. These are
combined with the circuit equation which is normally written with generator or motor
signs according to the relative operation, shown in Figure 10.7. In steady-state
conditions (Ia  const), we have

10.4.2
Starting a DC Motor with Constant Field Current
The fundamental equations (10.8) are valid for any value of the ﬁeld current If. To
understand better how a DC motor operates, let us now study a starting transient when
the machine is operated with If  const. This is the case in Figure 10.7, if the voltage
source of the ﬁeld circuit Uf is held constant. In the next section, other options of
generating If will be examined.
Consider the transient illustrated in Figure 10.8. Initially consider that the transient
is due to the closing of switch S, while holding closed S1 and S2.

DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

For a given Ω, this allows us to determine the current Ia and therefore the produced
machine torque:
Tmach  IaΨfa  IaLmIf
(10.12)
The produced torque will cause the angular speed to grow according to the
equation
Tmach  TLΩ  Jeq _Ω
(10.13)
where TL(Ω) is the torque produced by the load and Jeq  Jmach  JL is the moment of
inertia of load and machine combined.
Equations (10.11), (10.12), and (10.13) must be solved simultaneously step by
step, for which a simulation programme is required.
However, they give some qualitative indications. For instance, they show that in
the beginning, when the speed Ω is very low, the EMF E will be near zero and
according to (10.11) current Ia tends to grow rapidly. Were it not limited by the
presence of La, it would reach the very high value I0  U/Ra.
This current is often too large for the machine, which would be damaged if started
up directly. In these cases, use is made of the starting resistors. The number of starting
resistors may vary, depending on the applications; in Figure 10.8, two of these are
considered as an example.
When these resistors are used, the starting procedure is as follows:
• At the beginning, S is closed, with S1 and S2 kept open. Their presence will limit
the initial current peak to below U/(Ra  Rs1  Rs2).
• When the speed grows, the term ΩΨfa will increasingly limit the current in
equation (10.11).

• When the current is sufﬁciently reduced, S1 is closed; the current initially grows
and then, as Ω is increased further, will decrease again.
• Finally, S2 is closed, and the system reaches the ﬁnal steady-state speed.
This is clariﬁed in Figure 10.9, which shows realistic values of torque, current, and
speed, as obtainable by numerical simulation when no (left) and two (right) starting
resistors are used.
The simulation refers to a 100-V, 100-A machine with a load requiring a torque that
varies with speed: T  T0  kΩ2 with T0  35 Nm and at the ﬁnal speed T  70 Nm. The
combined moment of inertia of the machine and load is 3.0 kg m2.
In the absence of a starting resistor, a huge current is initially generated with a peak
of around 1700 A, which, depending on the machine design, could seriously damage
it. In fact, even though currents a few times higher than the rated value are permissible
for limited periods, 17 times this value is normally unacceptable.
In the transient shown in the right-hand part of the ﬁgure, the presence of sui-
table starting resistors reduces the peak current to below 500 A, which is acceptable.

With two starting resistors. Horizontal variable is time in seconds (the total transient is 4 s).
322
DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

The torque is reduced in proportion, and the transient is slower but still lasts less than
four seconds.
We can understand the two transients even better by looking at the steady-state
machine and load torques shown in Figure 10.10.
The steady-state machine torque, which is roughly Tmach in equation (10.13), is
obtained by substituting the steady-state current from equation (10.11) (i.e., the
current value that can be obtained when the voltage across inductance La is neglected):
Ia;ss  U  ΩΨfa=Ra;
Tmach;ss  ΨfaIa;ss
in which Ψfa  LmIf  const.
This torque, in the T–Ia plane, is a straight line; its value at zero speed is T0 
U/RaΨfa, while it reaches 0 at a virtual speed Ωlim  U/Ψfa.
The left-hand and right-hand parts of Figure 10.10 show the steady-state character-
istics when the motor is started both with and without two starting resistors.
Differently from the values used for transients shown in Figure 10.9, for a more
general picture we consider a torque load TL as a function of the mechanical speed Ω.
In both cases, a rough estimate of the accelerating torque can be obtained from the
difference Tmach(Ω)  TL(Ω). By evaluating this difference, we can interpret the plots
of Figure 10.9. Equilibrium is reached when Tmach  TL and therefore, from equation

In the case of TL  const, as in the transient shown in Figure 10.9, equation (°) allows
us to determine Ω∞immediately.
Note that nowadays, with increasing frequency, large motors are started without a
starting resistor and without the motor absorbing the current I0; instead they are fed
during starting with a reduced voltage. This will be discussed in Section 10.6.
Example 3. Consider the machine simulated in Figure 10.9, having the following
nominal data:
Un  100 V; In  100 A; nn  1425 rpm; Ra  0:05 Ω:
Evaluate the initial steady-state current I0, as well as Ωlim, Ω∞, and T0, if the load
requires a torque T  70 Nm.
I0  U=Ra  100=0:05  2000 A
The nominal EMF is the one corresponding to the nominal current:
En  Un  RaIn  100  0:05 ? 100  95 V
Thus
Ωn  2πnn=60  2π ? 1425=60  149:2 rad=s
Ψfa  En=Ωn  0:6366 Wb
T0  ΨfaU=Ra  0:6366 ? 100=0:05  1273 Nm

Ω∞ Ωlim1  T=T0  1500 ? 1  70=1273  1417 rpm
The latter value is exactly the one obtained with both simulations proposed in
Figure 10.9.
The peak torque obtained from the simulation without starting resistors is 849 Nm,
which is below the value of T0 calculated here. This is as it should be, because of the
effect of La, not considered in the steady-state machine torque curve.
Similarly, the peak current from the simulation is 1300 A, compared to the higher
I0  2 kA calculated here.
More in Depth: Effects of saturation
The analysis of the DC machine performed here was based on a linear model of the
machine.

This is correct only as an approximation since, due to the nonlinear behaviour of
stator and rotor iron, actual machines signiﬁcantly deviate from linearity when
saturation occurs. The main deviation from linearity in the relationship between
the ﬁeld current If and the generated EMF is indicated in the ﬁgure alongside.
In real machines, however, the actual operating point of excitation is held in the
linear zone, or at most at the knee, since going further would increase excitation
losses without increasing the EMF. The simulations shown disregard any satura-
tion effect.

10.4.3
Independent, Shunt, PM, and Series Excitation Motors
In the previous sections the fundamental equations (10.8) were demonstrated in both
generator and motor operation. They contain the ﬁeld ﬂux Φf.
The only way previously examined to generate this ﬂux Φf was by means of an
external DC source. As already discussed, this is just one option, normally referred to
as independent excitation. Other ways are possible and are commonly used. Some of
them are shown in Figure 10.11 and are brieﬂy discussed here.
In Figure 10.11a, excitation is independent (or separate), as discussed in the
previous section. In Figure 10.11b the supply to the ﬁeld coil is the same source that
feeds the armature. This is called shunt excitation. If the DC source is ideal (i.e., with
zero internal resistance), this solution is perfectly equivalent to independent excita-
tion. The electric model of a DC source is shown in Figure 10.11e.
In the case of a nonzero inner (or Thévenin) resistance of the DC, a (frequently minor)
difference lies in the fact that when the machine absorbs a very high current Ia, the
voltage Uf feeding the ﬁeld coil is signiﬁcantly lower than UTh. Thus, with shunt
excitation, a high armature current tends to reduce the ﬁeld current.
Therefore, except for minor differences, the voltage–current and torque–current
characteristics are the same as shown in the previous section for the case of
independent excitation.
In Figure 10.11c, the ﬁeld is created not by an actual coil, but by the insertion of
permanent magnets in the stator circuit. Their effect is to create a ﬁxed ﬁeld ﬂux Φf,
exactly in the same way as if a ﬁxed current ﬂowed in an excitation coil. Therefore,
PM excitation is equivalent to independent excitation; and like the latter, it is nearly
equivalent to shunt excitation.

FIGURE 10.12. Equivalent circuit of series-excited DC motor.
Some important, though obvious, differences regarding these types of excitation are:
• Independent excitation requires an independent DC source; it allows easy
modiﬁcation of If, acting on the value of the voltage applied to the ﬁeld coil.
• Shunt excitation is cheaper than independent excitation since it does not require
an external energy source; modiﬁcation of If is possible by inserting an
additional resistance in series with the ﬁeld coil, so that If is reduced (at equal
voltage applied to the series, the total resistance is increased).
• PM excitation allows easy and robust machine construction, but does not allow
ﬂux modiﬁcations. It is usually used in small DC motors.
Finally, in Figure 10.11d, the ﬁeld winding is connected in series with the machine
armature. In this case the two equivalent circuits of Figure 10.7b are in series, giving
rise to the combined circuit shown in Figure 10.12, whose KVL equation is (let

(10.14)
The resulting shape, drawn considering U  const, is summarized in Figure 10.13.
Starting from the value T0  LmU2/Ra
2 at standstill, the torque decreases continuously
as Ω increases, and it is always positive. At high speeds, the term Ra in the
denominator is negligible and can therefore be ignored; thus the curve decreases
proportionally to 1/Ω2.
The standstill current I0 (and the standstill torque T0) is normally too high and can
cause damage to the machine. Therefore, the machine is started at a reduced voltage,
and the reduction is obtained at low speeds by interposition of a starting resistor Rs,
which is then bypassed when the current has become acceptable, in correspondence to
the speed Ω*. (The curve of I0 when S1 is open is not shown in the current plot, just to
avoid too many curves on the same ﬁgure).
Series-excited machines are used when the load might have sudden peaks of torque;
in this case this machine slows down and raises its torque by large amounts, thus
overcoming the difﬁculty. These machines were widely used in the past on board trains,
mainly because of their high torque capability at low speeds, even though trains were
started by temporarily inserting series resistances (such as the Rs in Figure 10.13).
DIFFERENT TYPES OF DC MACHINES

Today they are used as small motors, often sized to be able to start without Rs, and
as “universal motors,” which will be discussed in Section 10.5.

UNIVERSAL MOTORS

steady-state torque formula of a series-excited DC motor is (10.14):
T  LmI2
a  Lm
U2


2
This formula shows that the torque generated does not depend on the voltage sign. If,
therefore, the source polarity is reversed, torque T and speed Ω do not change their
signs.
Consequently, if a series-excited “DC machine” is connected to an alternating
source that continuously reverses its polarity, it will operate as a series-excited DC
machine, with a torque–speed relationship similar to that discussed in the previous
section.
A motor with commutator, designed to be fed by an AC source, is normally called
universal motor.3 Under AC operation, the motor will draw a current that can be
assumed to be sinusoidal:

329

This will generate a torque:
Tt  LmI21  cos 2ωt
which has an average value and has a ﬂuctuation around that value at twice the
frequency of the supply voltage.
The presence of the large inductors La  Lf, however, tends to oppose the current
variation, and therefore the current ﬂowing in the circuit will fall as long as the circuit
frequency rises.
The higher the frequency applied to the universal motor, the more its operation will
differ from DC characteristics. For instance, the torque–speed relationship of the same
machine operating at different frequency is qualitatively represented in Figure 10.15.
In the recent past, when electric trains were usually operated using commutator motors,
very large AC commutator motors—up to hundreds of kilowatts—were used. To keep
the advantage of AC (allowing the use of transformers to feed the contact lines) and
obtain a torque behaviour similar to the case of a DC supply, many railway contact lines
were operated at a frequency lower than the one typically used for stationary applica-
tions: 25 Hz in some American states, 50/3  16.67 Hz in some European countries. In
Europe, thousands of kilometres are still operated at 16.67 Hz, even though modern
trains ﬁrst internally convert electricity into DC and then supply power trains that are
usually based on synchronous or induction motor drives.
Today, small universal motors are used very frequently in small domestic
appliances, where simple construction and high torque at small speeds are required.
Therefore, typical applications are in drills, food mixers, saws, and vacuum cleaners.
Characteristic of these motors is a loud noise and small arcs in the commutator; both
are mainly due to the continuous switching of current between the armature
conductors, commanded by the switching of brushes from one commutator sector
to another.
Needless to say, universal motors must always be laminated in both stator and
rotor.

DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

10.6
DC ELECTRIC DRIVES
The characteristic of a standard supply does not always meet the requirements of an
electric machine for optimal behaviour.
We have already encountered one such situation in this chapter, when it was seen
that a constant voltage is not normally adequate for starting a DC machine, since when
its mechanical speed is null or very low, its electromotive force E is null or very low,
and the machine draws a very large current which can damage it.
The characteristics of the supply system used to be matched to the machine by
electromechanical means. As regards the DC motors, it was seen in Section 10.4.2 that
one or more starting resistors Rs placed in series with the armature, can carry out this
matching. These electromechanical means, however, have distinct disadvantages. For
instance, the resistor Rs dissipates signiﬁcant quantities of energy during starting and
does not easily allow continuous variation of the DC voltage during start-up or during
operation at low speeds.
In recent years, new apparatuses called electronic converters have appeared which
allow very ﬂexible and effective modiﬁcation of the supply characteristic and which
allow machines to be more easily and more effectively matched to their supply
system.
Electronic converters are sometimes also called power processing units (PPUs), to
evidence their characteristic of changing the terms (voltage and current) of the power
transferred to the load.4
Therefore we can insert an electronic converter between the source and the
machine, so that voltage current at the machine’s terminals are different from those
at the DC source (Figure 10.16a). This is normally done when a cheap DC source is
available to feed the converter—for example, in a system in which the main source
uses an electrochemical battery.5 In the majority of cases, however, an AC source is
easily available. For powers larger than just a kilowatt, this is typically a three-phase
source, as shown in Figure 10.16b.
The general purpose of the electronic converter is to modify the parameters of the
electricity supply, ideally leaving the power unchanged. Should the main source be
DC, the following equation will ideally apply:
P  UsIs  UmIm
(10.15)
In cases in which the source is three-phase AC, indicating with the symbols Ul
and Il the rms value of the line-to-line voltages and line currents, respectively, and
4The acronym PPU is used throughout the recent book [bm3]. We dealt with electronic converters in
Chapter 8. However, it is not mandatory to study Chapter 8 to be able to understand this analysis of electric
drives.
5This is, for instance, the case of some Italian submarines. Submarines are indeed often fed by electro-
chemical sources, because when submerged they cannot consume the oxygen required by combustion-
based engines.

It is fairly obvious that it is not possible to achieve the exact equivalence of input
and output power, because, to effect voltage and current conversion, some power loss
would unavoidably occur. For the purpose of basic analysis of electric drives, these
losses can be initially disregarded: they are considered only at a later stage to evaluate
global efﬁciencies. Therefore in this section (10.15) or (10.16) can be assumed to be
true.
Actual electronic converters can have very high efﬁciencies. It is not uncommon to have
efﬁciencies6 of around 97–98%.
A converter corresponding to the basic equation (10.15) is called DC–DC
converter or chopper. It performs in much the same way as an ideal transformer:
It is like the transformer, but operates in DC.

can be set by a control action on the inner operation of the converter, differently from
the transformer, in which this ratio is ﬁxed because it equals the turns ratio.
A converter corresponding to the basic equation (10.16) is called AC–DC
converter or rectiﬁer. Rectiﬁers can be created in different ways in practice. To
obtain an effective drive, a controlled rectiﬁer is needed—for example, a system able
to transfer power from an AC source to a DC load in a controlled way—so that at
given AC voltages, the produced DC voltage can be modiﬁed by control action.
A second electronic converter can be used to vary the voltage applied to the ﬁeld
coil, so that the ﬁeld current If  Uf/Rf is modiﬁed according to requirements. The
arrangements in this case can be of the type shown in Figure 10.17.
It is important to evaluate the maximum torque and power performance of an
electric drive of the type shown in Figure 10.17. This can be easily done by referring
to the fundamental equations of the DC motor (10.8):
E  ΩΨfa
T  IaΨfa
in conjunction with the circuit equation, considered for slow-varying currents:
U  E  RaIa
and considering that the machine will have maximum values of armature voltage and
current Umax and Imax (which cannot be overcome) and that in normal operation U ≈E
can be assumed.

Consider the machine operating at steady state at a speed Ω. For low, increasing
speeds, in the beginning the linked ﬂux Ψfa is held equal to its maximum value.
The armature voltage will be approximately linearly increasing with Ω, because
U  E  ΩΨfa (left-hand side of Figure 10.18a). Correspondingly, the maximum
torque available will stay at the ﬁxed value T  ΨfaImax (left-hand side of Fig-
ure 10.18b). When the maximum voltage has reached its maximum value Umax at
speed Ωbase, it cannot increase further.
The machine speed can further increase over Ωbase, while maintaining the armature
voltage constant. This can be done by reducing the linked ﬂux Ψfa; this is the ﬁeld
weakening region, which can continue up to the point in which the maximum machine
speed Ωmax is reached (right-hand part of Figures 10.18a and 10.18b).
Note that this behaviour allows exploitation of the maximum torque the machine is
able to deliver, up to the point at which the machine has reached its maximum power;
starting from that point, the machine is able to deliver its maximum power up to the
maximum allowed speed.
Clearly, the drive is able to make the machine deliver torque and power that are
lower than the maximum admissible values shown in Figure 10.18; it is just a matter
of making the machine absorb currents that are lower than Imax. Controlling the drawn
current is easy done. Consider the equation
U  E  RaIa  ΩΨfa  RaIa
where, at given ﬂux Ψfa, E varies slowly since its variation is connected with the
mechanical inertia of the machine rotor and its mechanical load.
Any variation in the applied armature voltage U will therefore result in a
corresponding variation of the drawn current:
Ia  U  E

and therefore of the torque produced: T  ΨfaIa.

DC MACHINES AND DRIVES AND UNIVERSAL MOTORS

The usual rule for controlling the DC drive at partial load is to keep the ﬂux Φf at its
maximum value—that is, that shown as a function of Ω in Figure 10.18. In this way,
for a given torque request the armature current Ia and the corresponding Joule losses
are at their minimum (remember that T  ΨfaIa).

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES
AND DRIVES
For the Instructor
Synchronous machines are very important as generators, as they are the main way
of producing electricity in power stations. Today, however, they are frequently
used as motors when, usually with permanent magnets on the rotor, they are
coupled to inverters to form brushless drives.
Therefore a signiﬁcant part of this chapter is devoted to the presentation of a
simpliﬁed analysis of synchronous drives.
Naturally, we had to ﬁnd a way to analyse synchronous drives while avoiding the
complexity Park’s equations. We thus decided to take as a reference the isotropic
construction of the permanent-magnet synchronous machine, and we analysed the
drive by making use of phasors, a technique used throughout the book. Although it
is probably new (we had not it seen previously in books or papers), we hope that
this simpliﬁed way of analysing synchronous drives will be useful for instructors
and students.

11.1
THE BASIC IDEA AND GENERATION OF EMF
The synchronous machine is a three-phase machine, able to exchange power with a
three-phase network. Although it can also operate as a motor (absorbing electric
energy) in the majority of applications, it is used as a generator (delivering electric
energy).
The vast majority of power stations generate electricity in three-phase form, using
synchronous machines.
To explain the basic operation of a synchronous machine, we start from what we
learned in Chapter 9 regarding rotating machines. The reader will recall that the basic
components of a rotating machine are a stator and a rotor.
Figure 11.1 is a simpliﬁed representation of a three-phase machine stator. This is
similar to the one already shown in Chapter 9, but here there are three coils,
constituted by the six conductors a–a0, b–b0, c–c0 and distributed evenly along the
air-gap circumference.
Each of the coils is composed of the active conductors and the connections at their
ends, as discussed in Chapter 9 (see Figure 9.6) and recalled in the right-hand part of
Figure 11.1 for coil a (constituted by conductors a and a0) only. The coil terminals
are named like the corresponding conductors (a and a for coil a–a0). When the
machine operates under load, it will obviously deliver current through the coil
terminals; the reference signs for these currents are shown in Figure 11.1 by the
dot–cross convention (introduced in Section 9.2) in the left-hand sketch and with the
usual arrow used also in circuits in the right-hand one.
These reference directions also allow oriented axes to be deﬁned for the three coils:
the ones represented by the bold symbols a, b, and c in Figure 11.1; their orientations
are chosen in conjunction with the reference signs for currents, and they are related to
each other by the right-hand rule for coils.

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

The right-hand arrow rule for coils can be expressed in two ways:
1. If the hand is positioned with the longer ﬁngers curved to simulate a coil, and their tips
are thought to be arrow heads of the current, the thumb tip will indicate the arrowhead of
the oriented axis.
2. If an eye looks at the tip of the oriented axis, it will see the current, imagined to be
ﬂowing according to the assumed direction, moving counterclockwise. An eye is
schematically shown in Figure 11.1 for axis a.
Figure 11.1 also shows an angular abscissa θ which is able to represent any air-gap
position in terms of an angle between 0 and 2π radians, as seen in Chapter 9. The
origin of this abscissa is obviously arbitrary, but should be clearly deﬁned. In the
ﬁgure, an angle θ  0 is chosen in such a way that the oriented axis a of coil a has an
abscissa of π/2 radians.
Finally, it is also important to represent the whole set of coils with axis a
( oriented axis of the ﬁrst coil) in vertical position and oriented upward; this
will facilitate analysis, as will be seen later.
As far as the rotor is concerned, two versions of them exist: cylindrical,
Figure 11.2a, or salient-pole (or simply salient), Figure 11.2b; that is, a synchronous
machine can be built with cylindrical or salient pole rotor.
The salient-pole version allows savings in iron and therefore in cost, but is not
suitable for machines that are operated at very fast speeds because of the higher
centrifugal forces. Therefore, salient-pole rotors are used for lower speeds, while
cylindrical ones are used for machines that rotate faster (say above 1000–1500 rpm).
There are signiﬁcant differences in the electromechanical behaviour of the two
kinds of machines, stemming from the fact that cylindrical machines have radial
symmetry, since the path of magnetic forces has the same reluctance whatever the
angle; conversely, salient-pole machines have a lower reluctance in the axis joining
N-S poles of the rotor—that is, the parts of the rotor where the ﬂux abandons the rotor

itself or enters it, respectively. This axis is the direct axis. It has larger inductance than
in the direction orthogonal to it, the quadrature axis.
Since cylindrical rotor machines have isotropic behaviour (reluctance does not depend
on the radial position of the ray considered), they are often called isotropic; conversely,
salient-pole are also called anisotropic.
These differences, however, are not so great as to merit analysis in an introductory
course such as the one offered by this book. Therefore we state the following:
Assumption: Synchronous machine isotropy
The mathematical model of the synchronous machine proposed in this book does
not take into account reluctance differences between the direct and quadrature
axes. It is, therefore, better suited to the analysis of cylindrical-rotor machines,
although it is also sufﬁcient, for basic purposes, for salient-pole machines.
Following the practice of most textbooks, drawings will, however, usually be made
using salient-pole machines because they allow more immediate visual analysis.
Consider the drawing in Figure 11.2a, referring to a cylindrical rotor. The rotor
contains conductor bars parallel to the rotation axis, through which ﬂows a DC
current, commonly called ﬁeld current (and therefore indicated as If). Later we will
explain how this current can be transferred to a moving part such as a rotor.
This current creates a distribution of ﬂux density Br (here the subscript “r” does not
mean radial but, instead, “rotor”), two force lines of which are represented. When the
rotor is rotated at a speed Ω, by means of mechanical connection to an external
supplier of mechanical energy such as a diesel engine or a turbine, all the Br map
rotates along with the rotor.
Figure 11.2 also shows angle θ discussed earlier.
The radial component Brr of Br as a function of angle θ can be approximated by a
sinusoidal function, as discussed in Chapter 9, each time. Let it be represented as a
cosine1:
Brrt; θ  B cosθ  ~θ;
~θ  ωt  t0
(11.1)
where, for the machine depicted in the ﬁgure,2 the ω equals Ω. We can choose as the
initial time t0 the time when Br is aligned to the ray (half-line) θ  0. In this case it is
simply ~θ  ωt. For instance, in the situation depicted in Figure 11.2, with this choice
of t0, ωt is slightly above 90°.
1It should be totally clear to the reader that any sine wave can be represented either as a sine or as a cosine,
since one of these functions can be converted into the other by horizontal translation.
2The reader will soon learn that in general ω  pΩ, where p is the number of pole pairs of the machine.
340
SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

Using (11.1) and Faraday’s law for rotating coils, as seen in Chapter 9, we
obtain
e  ωBrr A
where e is the induced electromotive force and A is the coil surface area; it is easy to
ﬁnd expressions of electromotive forces of the three machine coils.
Remember that Brr is the component of the ﬂux density Br produced by the rotor,
measured in radial direction in the position where the conductor with the quotation
mark (a0, for the couple a–a0, etc.) is positioned. So the value of Brr to be considered at
a given time is different for the three coils and is the one corresponding to angle θ
describing the position of the base conductor of the three coils. With the disposition of
coils shown in the ﬁgures of this section, and in particular in Figure 11.2b, it will be

which shows that the machine produces a three-phase balanced system of sinusoidal
electromotive forces that can be represented by their phasors, as shown in the right-

THE BASIC IDEA AND GENERATION OF EMF
341

To provide the three-phase source required by loads, the three coils are normally
connected to each other in a star conﬁguration: conductor terminals a, b, and c are
connected to each other and ends a, b, and c constitute the three machine
terminals, to be connected to phases a, b, and c of loads.3 This way, the three-phase
balanced system of EMFs is applied to the line and to the loads connected to it. An
example is shown in Figure 11.4, in which the machine is represented with its rotating
shaft (carrying torque T and having angular speed Ω) and with its ﬁeld current If
supplied by the DC voltage source Uf, called ﬁeld voltage.
In the following sections there is a drawing of an equivalent circuit, able to analyse
systems such as that shown in Figure 11.4 using the single-phase equivalent concept
discussed in Chapter 6.
The DC current can be transferred to the rotor with a brushed or a brushless system.
For simplicity’s sake, this book will only deal with the former and simpler of the two.
The brushed system can be arranged as depicted in Figure 11.5 in which, for
simplicity, the rotor has a single-turn coil, while in reality there are several turns,
connected in series to each other at the two ends of the machine rotor as displayed in
the ﬁgure.

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

A stationary DC voltage source is electrically connected to two brushes, which are
conductive elements of carbon-like material and pressed, using springs, to two slip
rings that are mechanically connected to the rotor and therefore rotate along with it.
When the rotor rotates, electricity is transferred from the stationary brushes to the
rings, even though there is relative movement between the two parts.
It can be said that this mechanism is similar to the trolley-catenary contact so
widely used to feed trains by means of overhead lines: there the carbon-like elements
are in the trolley and the contact line is in copper.
These sliding couples allow DC current to be transferred to the rotor. The brushes
are made of a material which is much softer than copper, so that the brushes have to be
periodically replaced; the slip rings, which would probably be much more difﬁcult to
replace, last much longer.
Ignoring any iron saturation phenomenon, it can be said that the ﬁeld produced is
proportional to the producing current If:
B  If;
^E  ωAB ) ^E  ωLfIf
(11.2)
in which Lf, the proportionality coefﬁcient between ωIf and ^E (that is, the peak of any
of the electromotive forces induced in the stator), has the dimensions of an inductor.
The machine structure shown in Figure 11.2, and reproduced in Figure 11.6a only as a
salient-pole conﬁguration, has for both stator and rotor one pole pair (one N-S
couple). The corresponding wave of radial ﬂux density is of the type shown in the
same ﬁgure below the machine drawing. It is also possible, and indeed very frequent,

to produce machines with more than one pole pair. To clarify the concept, a machine
with two pole pairs and the corresponding wave of radial induction density is shown
in Figure 11.6b.
It is apparent that every complete rotation of the rotor is seen by the stator windings
as if there were two rotations: the radial induction wave contains two full sine waves,
and as such they are seen by all the coil conductors.
In general, for a machine containing p pole pairs (p can reach values much greater
than 10), each rotation of the rotor causes the coil conductors to be subjected to p
periods of the radial wave.
Consequently, if Ω  dθ=dt is the physical angular speed of the rotor, and the
induced EMF is et  ^E sinωt  α, it is obviously
ω  pΩ
(11.3)
Despite its simplicity, (11.3) is a fundamental law for synchronous machines, and a
very similar relation will play a very important role also for induction machines, to be
dealt with in the next chapter.
Quantities ω and Ω are also called electrical and mechanical angular speed,
respectively. The same equation is also often written using different units of measure:
n  60f
p
where
• n is the number of revolutions per minute (rpm),
• f is the electrical frequency (Hz), and
• p is the number of pole pairs.
The great importance of (11.3) is immediately apparent, when we consider that all the
interconnected circuits and networks share the same frequency. For instance the
whole of Europe operates at 50 Hz and European nations, along with their houses,
factories, ofﬁces, etc. are all connected to each other. The result is that all the one-
pole-pair synchronous machines of Europe rotate at 3000 rpm, and all the two-pair
machines at 1500 rpm, and so on.
The rotational speeds of all the synchronous machines of an interconnected system
are integer submultiples of 60f—that is, of 3000 rpm for 50-Hz systems (e.g., Europe,
some American countries) and of 3600 for the 60-Hz systems (e.g., the United States,
some American countries, some Japanese islands).
In a multiple-pole-pair machine there are multiple conductors per coil. For
instance, in Figure 11.6a, while the coil for phase a is constituted only by conductor
a and a0, Figure 11.6b will be constituted by a–a0–A–A0; the voltages induced in a and
A and in a0 and A0 will be exactly the same and therefore they can be connected in
series, according to the sketch shown in Figure 11.7.

11.2.1
The Rotating Magnetic Field
Consider a three-phase machine connected to a balanced load—for example, consti-
tuted by three impedances Z equal to each other (Figure 11.8). The centre of the coils
star is shown for completeness (conductor n), but this is not connected to the load. It
was seen in the previous section that the synchronous machine generates, by effect of
the ﬁeld current and physical rotation, a three-phase balanced set of EMFs. Because of
the symmetry of the machine and of the load, it is unquestionable that when the
machine is connected to a balanced load, these EMFs will cause a three-phase
balanced set of currents to circulate.4
Now it is time to see what this symmetrical set of currents do inside the machine.
The situation can be analysed with reference to Figure 11.9. It shows, just for
simplicity and as a general example, a two-pole machine. The time at which the currents
are considered is the one shown by the phasor diagram to the right of the ﬁgure—that is,
a time in which the current in phase a is at its maximum. As discussed in Section 11.1,
the directions of coil axes a, b, and c also set the reference signs for coil currents, which
are also shown for greater clarity using the cross–dot convention in Figure 11.1.
Therefore, the component of the displayed vector Ba on axis a, also has a maximum;
the value of its radial component Bar, as a function of both time and angle θ, is

however, be demonstrated, and will be discussed later, that even for salient-pole machines, this conclusion
holds true.

Since all the three currents circulate in the three stator coils, not only is Ba generated,
but so also are the corresponding ﬂux densities of phases b and c, that is, Bb and Bc.

We can use a very fast method to demonstrate the latter identity. If we write x  ωt, its left
member is the sum of three phasors that constitute a balanced star of phasors. It is
therefore, as we saw in Chapter 6, identically null.

(11.5)
where θe  pθ is also called electrical angle, while θ is called mechanical angle.
Equation (11.5) represents a translating wave in the θe axis, with speed ω
(Figure 11.10). If we stick to a given abscissa θe we see a sine-wave radial Br;
the same Br is a sinusoid also at a given time t, throughout the θe span.
Equation (11.5) shows that at a time in which the instantaneous current in phase a
is at its maximum (e.g., ωt  0), the maximum value of Br(θ) is when θe  π/2—that is,
along the direction of the oriented axis of coil a (cf. Figure 11.9). In a similar way, the
maximum of the Br wave is along b or c when the respective currents are at their
maxima, respectively.
We have seen in Section 9.3.4 that a sinusoidal translating radial wave can be
imagined as being obtained from a uniform ﬁeld distribution, rotating at the angular
electrical speed ω (and mechanical Ω  ω/p). Therefore, the result (11.5) is often
referred to as the “rotating ﬁeld theorem”:

Result: The rotating ﬁeld theorem
If a balanced set of currents with angular frequency ω is introduced in windings
that are separated from each other by 120° (electrical), this produces a ﬁeld that is
equivalent to a uniform ﬁeld Beq rotating at a constant electrical speed ω (and
mechanical Ω  ω/p), called rotating ﬁeld.
The rotating ﬁeld has the direction of the oriented axis of a coil when the
instantaneous value of the coil current is at its maximum.
It is commonly agreed that the rotating ﬁeld theorem was independently discov-
ered by Nicholas Tesla and Galileo Ferraris, in the years 1882–1889.
11.2.2
Stator–Rotor Interaction
The rotating ﬁeld theorem indicates that the stator currents generate a ﬁeld similar to
the one generated by the rotor. Both are rotating ﬁelds: the one produced by stator
currents rotates by effect of the amplitudes and phases of stator currents (and of the
arrangement of conductors around the air gap), while the one produced by the rotor
rotates because of mechanical rotor rotation.
The two ﬁelds are synchronous, in the sense that they rotate at exactly the same
speed.
The effects of the interaction of the two rotating ﬁelds can easily be qualitatively
evaluated, bearing in mind the “permanent magnet equivalent” as shown in
Figure 11.11, which shows the two ﬁelds. When a ﬁeld abandons the iron part in
which it is produced, a north pole (N) is shown with an opposite, a south pole (S). The
interaction of the two ﬁelds can be qualitatively evaluated through our understanding
of permanent magnets: similar poles repel each other, whereas opposite poles attract.

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

In the position represented in Figure 11.11, the ﬁeld caused by the three stator
currents is directed upward, because in that instant the current ﬂowing in phase a is at
its maximum (the corresponding phasor is oriented upward). As shown in the
previous paragraph, the rotating ﬁeld is aligned with the oriented axis of a phase
when the current in that phase is at its maximum.
This means that the rotating ﬁeld is, in all points of space, oriented upward: say it
is the vector Bs shown in Figure 11.11. The magnetic ﬂux thus abandons the stator
in the bottom position, ﬂows through the rotor, and enters the stator again in the
stator S pole.
Correspondingly, N and S poles can be determined on the rotor. Two different rotor
positions are depicted in Figures 11.11a and 11.11b. In the case of Figure 11.11a, an
attractive force between opposite poles generates a torque that counteracts the rotor’s
movement; mechanical power is thus deliveredby the rotor andconverted into electrical
power. In this case the machine is operating as an electric generator.
In the case indicated in Figure 11.11b, the relative positions of magnetic ﬁelds, and
therefore of poles, are different; the net result is the production on the rotor of a torque
that draws it in the direction of positive angular speeds, and power is converted from
electricity into mechanical power. In this case the machine is operating as an electric
motor.
The switch from motor and generator operations is very smooth and can occur at
any time while the machine is working. Therefore the expressions “synchronous
motor” and “synchronous generator” should be understood as shortened versions of
“synchronous machine operating as a motor” and “synchronous machine operating as
a generator,” respectively.
More in Depth
An explanation of torque generation can also be derived using Lorentz’s force law
(in particular, FL in (2.7)) and the procedure indicated in Sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3.
In the case of anisotropic machines, there is an additional mechanism of torque
generation, based on the reluctance differences existing on the machine’s d and q
directions (see Figure 11.2a). This mechanism is very similar to that occurring in
electromagnets, as discussed in Section 9.4. In practice, the generated torque tends
to force the d direction (i.e., the lower reluctance direction) of the rotor to be
aligned with the stator ﬁeld direction.
This can also be visualized using the North–South pole attraction rule as shown in
Figure 11.11: even in the absence of current in the rotor coils, a south pole is
induced (by the so-called magnetic induction effect) in the rotor’s iron where the
stator ﬂux enters, and a north pole on the opposite side, thus creating the reluctance
torque.
This detailed evaluation of where forces are actually produced is often not required
for global machine operation evaluation.

11.2.3
The Phasor Diagram and the Single-Phase Equivalent Circuit
Now that we have a fair knowledge of the physical phenomena occurring inside the
machine, it is time to try to ﬁnd a single-phase equivalent circuit for it. Such a
circuit could allow steady-state analysis of the machine, even when it is connected
to other systems, using the highly effective phasor circuit analysis and the single-
phase equivalent circuit concept, with which the reader is now familiar from
Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. To do this, it is convenient to introduce the linked
ﬂux phasor Ψ.
As seen in the previous sections, the ﬂux linked with any stator phase varies, as a
sine wave, with time. Consider, for instance, the ﬂux ψa linked with phase coil a of the
machine and produced by a rotating ﬁeld B. It was observed in Section 11.2.1 that for
analysis, this ﬁeld can be considered as being uniform. Therefore ψa is equal to the
component of B along the oriented axis a of the coil times the surface area A of the
coil:
ψat  Brθea; t ? A  ^B cosθea  ωt  Ψ cosωt  θea
As far as the phase of this ﬂux is considered, it is recalled that, because of the rotating
ﬁeld theorem, ψa(t) has its maximum when the current in phase a has its maximum.
Therefore, the phasor representing it has to be parallel to Ia. Therefore it will be
Ψ sa  Lsa I sa
or; simply;
Ψ s  Ls I s
where:
• the subscript “a” may be omitted when writing the single-phase equivalent of
the machine since, by convention, it always refers to phase a;
• the proportionality coefﬁcient between current and ﬂux is dimensionally
equivalent to an inductance and has therefore been indicated with the usual
symbol of inductances (Lsa or Ls);
• the subscript “s” has, traditionally, both the meaning of “stator” and “synchro-
nous,” since it refers to the synchronous machine and recalls that the ﬁeld
produced by the stator currents is synchronous (rotates at the same angular
speed) with the rotor.
When the machine operates under load, two different ﬁelds rotate and generate
radial waves on the air gap: stator and rotor ﬂux density waves.
The voltage generated by these two ﬁelds can be found using Faraday’s law in their
phasor form:
E tot  E r  E s   dΨ r
dt  dΨ s
dt  jωΨ r  jωΨ s  E r  jXsI
(11.6)
350
SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

where, obviously, Xs  jωLs.
Equation (11.6) can be written when there exists a linear relationship between magnetic
ﬁeld H and ﬂux density ﬁeld B. This is valid only as an approximation in electric
machines, as already noted in the study of DC machines.
The electromotive force E tot  E r can be measured at the coil terminals, as U a
shown in Figure 11.8 before connecting the three impedances.
When the load impedances are connected, the currents ﬂowing in the stator’s coils
cause E s to be produced, as well as an ohmic drop:
U  E tot  Rs I  E r  jXs I  Rs I  E r  Z s I
where, obviously, Z s  Rs  jXs.
This can be interpreted in a very easy and effective way using the phasor diagram
and the corresponding single-phase equivalent circuit shown in Figure 11.12.
In the phasor diagram it is noted that:
• all the electromotive forces are lagging by 90° the corresponding ﬂux phasors,
since they are obtained by multiplying the latter by a positive constant and j
(which rotates counterclockwise by 90°);
• the stator ﬂux phasor is aligned with the current; this is a consequence of the
already noted peculiarity of the rotating ﬁeld theorem—that is, that the rotating
ﬁeld is aligned with the axis of a coil when the current in that coil is at its
maximum. Therefore, the ﬂux linked with that coil reaches its maximum when
the current is at its maximum.
The synchronous machine model shown in Figure 11.12 and the corresponding
equivalent circuit deﬁne a model often called Behn-Eschemburg’s model, named after
the scientist that ﬁrst introduced it.
More complex models, such as Park’s model, are beyond the scope of this book.
To have an idea of the usage of the single-phase equivalent circuit of the
synchronous machine, take, for instance, the system shown in Figure 11.13. It
can be effectively analysed using its single-phase equivalent, as shown in the
right-hand part of the ﬁgure.

More in Depth
Should we need to take into account the saliency of a salient-pole synchronous
machine, the phasor diagram and circuit shown in Figure 11.12 can still be valid,
but the value of Xs is a function of the angle between U and I—that is, what
happens outside the machine. As a consequence, a phasor circuit cannot be used in
the way shown in this book.
It should also be added that both cylinder and salient-pole machines are not totally

Power Exchanges
It is very important to evaluate the relationship between the quantities shown in
Figure 11.12 and the exchanges of active and reactive powers P and Q with the
external network.
It would be especially useful to have very simple formulas which can give
immediate information of what happens, for instance, if the ﬁeld current is raised
or if the mechanical power entering the machine is increased. To pursue this simple
task, analysis is carried out while disregarding the stator coil resistance from the
single-phase circuit. Therefore, the circuit and phasor diagram shown in Figure 11.14
can be used.

which obviously refer to the powers ﬂowing (going out of the machine) in the single-
phase equivalent circuit—that is, one-third of the whole power leaving the machine.
Equations (11.7) are able to offer an immediate interpretation of a machine
connected with a so-called prevailing network—that is, a network so powerful
that its voltage phasors remain the same, in amplitude and angle, whatever the
machine does (Figure 11.15).5
In terms of circuit analysis, a prevailing network is characterized by a single-phase
equivalent whose Thévenin equivalent has null impedance. Therefore, the interaction
of the machine and the network, disregarding the coil resistance, can be evaluated
using the single-phase equivalent shown in the right-hand part of Figure 11.15.
One consequence of the constancy of U is the constancy of its phase, and
therefore of its frequency. Bearing in mind the fundamental law of the synchronous
machine ω  pΩ, in steady state, the machine mechanical rotational speed Ω is also
constant.
5Other names for such a component frequently found in the literature are: prevailing power system or inﬁnite
power system.

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

Using (11.7) and ignoring all the active power losses within the machine (hence
Pm  P), several pieces of information can be inferred regarding the situation depicted
in Figure 11.15.
First of all, it should be recalled, from (11.2), that Er and If are proportional. At If
constant, therefore, the mechanical power Pm entering the machine, assumed to be
equal to the active power delivered to the prevailing network, is proportional to the
sinus of the so-called torque angle β. Under these conditions the maximum power that
the machine can generate is
^P  UEr
Xs
This is an electrical limit to the power that can be transferred, even when there exists
more than this power available at the mechanical shaft and even if the stator and rotor
conductors have not reached their thermal limit (maximum current).
The situation can be visualized in the plotted power-angle relationship shown in
Figure 11.16. It is possible to demonstrate that the power exchange between the
machine and the network is usually stable only for β  90°; however, the machine
does not work safely in proximity to β  90° because any further increase of power
would cause the system to collapse. In a typical power system, where synchronous
machines are used to generate power to be transferred to the network (see Part IV of
this book), when the system operates in steady state, angle β is often maintained below
45°, to keep within adequate operational limits.
Under the assumptions made, mechanical and electrical powers are equal to each
other. The reactive power ﬂow, indeed, is governed by modiﬁcation in the ﬁeld
current If.
In fact, the second equation of (11.7) shows that any increase in If causes a
corresponding increase in Q. The effects of If can be made even clearer if it is assumed
that cos β  1. In this case we have
Q ≅U Er  U
Xs
(11.8)
which indicates that the machine absorbs or delivers reactive power when Er is lower
or higher than U, respectively.
Synchronous machines used in power stations, therefore, not only generate active
power for the loads, but also contribute to supplying the loads with the needed reactive
power. While the active power production is regulated by acting on the source of
P

mechanical power connected to the shaft (turbine, internal combustion engines, etc.),
the reactive power production is controlled acting on the ﬁeld current If, which in turn
controls the EMF Er.
Example 4. A wye-connected synchronous machine is connected to a three-phase
3000-V (phase-to-phase) prevailing network. The synchronous reactance is 2 Ω,
while the stator resistance can be disregarded. Calculate the electromotive force, the

Generators and Motors
Synchronous machines were discussed previously in their more usual mode of
operation—that is, as generators. Indeed, they can operate equally as generators
or motors. The equivalent circuit of Figure 11.12 is still valid, as is the phasor
diagram, but with different angles.
Indeed, in the motor operation U leads E, since the value of P in equation (11.7)
must reverse, and therefore angle β has to change its sign.
The phasor diagram in the motor operation has the appearance shown in
Figure 11.17, which was drawn with the current I oriented as shown in the single-
phase circuit alongside.

FIGURE 11.18. The attempt of a synchronous machine to start up from a network with
constant voltage and frequency (prevailing network).
Motor operation of a synchronous machine is somewhat tricky. Indeed in common
use, motors have to be frequently started up—that is, moved from Ω  0 up to their
steady-state angular operation. Unfortunately, starting a synchronous motor is not
easy, unless the motor is connected to a special device called an inverter (see
Section 11.5).
If, for instance, a machine which is already fed with the ﬁeld voltage Uf (making
the ﬁeld current If circulate in the rotor coils) is abruptly connected to a three-phase
network (Figure 11.18), it will absorb currents that generate forces incapable of
accelerating the machine. It is easier to understand what happens if we remember the
rotating ﬁeld theory. If we imagine that after the switch S is closed, a three-phase
balanced system of currents ﬂows in the stator, it generates rotating poles in the air
gap, which interact with the (ﬁxed) rotor poles (see Figure 11.11). The interaction of
these pole pairs will generate an alternating torque, with a null average, and therefore
the rotor will continue to oscillate without picking up useful speed.
One way to start up a synchronous machine is to feed it using a variable-
frequency source: its frequency will start from zero and will be progressively
raised: for instance, the torque angle β can be maintained constant during this
acceleration transient. Details on how to do this in a special case are discussed in
Section 11.5.2.
Another way is to move the machine rotor mechanically by an external method
(another electric machine, a diesel engine, etc.), connecting the stator with the external
three-phase network and/or starting to excite the rotor through the ﬁeld current If only
when the actual rotor speed is very near to that of the rotating ﬁeld, that is, Ω  ω/p.
Example 6. A 400-V three-phase wye-connected synchronous motor has synchro-
nous impedance of 0.3  j3 Ω per phase. Calculate the electromotive force, the
angle β, and the active and reactive power absorbed from the grid, if the stator current

PERMANENT-MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES
In Chapter 7 it was shown that a ﬁxed value of ﬂux density Br can be obtained by the
introduction into a magnetic circuit of a permanent magnet (PM) having Br as residual
ﬂux. In a synchronous machine rotor, therefore, the insertion of PMs can have the
same effect as a DC-fed coil with a ﬁxed current ﬂowing in it. To evaluate the circuit
reluctance, the space occupied by the PMs must be considered as pure air—that is,
having the same magnetic permeability of empty space.
Practical arrangements PM synchronous machine rotors are shown in Figure 11.19.
In all cases, the permanent magnets generate a ﬁeld B with arrows indicating the
direction.
Two of the three arrangements cause the machine to behave in a particular way by
effect of their anisotropic iron structure. Consider, for instance, the central drawing:
the reluctance along direct axis is lower than the one along quadrature axis, since the
PERMANENT-MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES
359

space occupied by the PMs is to be considered as air. However, in this book,
according to the “synchronous machine” isotropy assumption, the analyses are made
disregarding any anisotropy effects.
The presence of the magnets is equivalent to conductors traversed by a DC current
and producing the same ﬂux density as the magnets.
The advantages of PM machines over conventional machines with ﬁeld coils are as
follows:
• Slip rings are avoided, with advantages in terms of machine cost, complexity
and maintenance.
• The rotor copper losses are avoided, which in turn brings advantages in term of
efﬁciency and heat dissipation needs.
An obvious disadvantage of this solution is that these machines have no ability to
regulate the produced ﬁeld, and, therefore, they cannot be used for reactive power
regulation (see Section 11.3.1). Thus they tend to be used mainly as motors, within
synchronous motor drives (Section 11.5).
Permanent magnet synchronous machines can also be seen as synchronous
machines without brushes. They are therefore very often called brushless machines.

SYNCHRONOUS ELECTRIC DRIVES

Introduction
In Section 11.1 the fundamental equation (11.3) was obtained, telling us that a
machine fed by a constant-frequency source rotates at a constant speed. It is therefore
impossible for a synchronous machine to work at variable speeds if it is fed by a
constant-frequency source.
In recent years, electronic devices have appeared that are able to convert constant-
frequency sources into variable frequency, thus allowing modiﬁcation of voltage and
frequency characteristics of a three-phase source. The set consisting of a suitable
electronic converter (also called power processing unit or PPU) and a motor is

generally called an electric drive; if the motor is synchronous, the drive is called a
synchronous electric drive. Two different kinds of synchronous motor drives are
shown in Figure 11.20: part (a) refers to a case in which the drive supply is an AC
source, while Part b to the case of a DC supply.
Details of the converters able to perform the functions shown in Figure 11.20 are given in
Chapter 8. The present chapter was deliberately written in such a way that it can be
understood without the need to read Chapter 8. The latter can thus be considered as a
more in-depth analysis of converters and drives.
11.5.2
PM, Inverter-Fed, Synchronous Motor Drives
In Section 11.3.2 we examined the operation of synchronous machines as motors, and
saw that for starting and variable speed operation it is mandatory to feed the
synchronous machine from a variable frequency source.
Information on how this can be done in practice is given here. Consider the
circuit and phasor diagrams shown in Figure 11.17. For the evaluation of the
machine at a variable speed, to make things even simpler the machine losses
are disregarded, and the simpler circuit and diagram shown in Figure 11.21 are
taken as reference.
The shaft mechanical power, when losses are disregarded, equals the one absorbed
from the electric supply and is equal to6

Φ PM and Ψ PM are respectively the ﬂux and the linked ﬂux produced by the
permanent magnets, and k is a proportionality factor that takes into account the
number of turns and the number of pole pairs. As a consequence, it is also
Tmecc  Pmecc=Ω ≅3ωΨPMI cos γ=Ω  3pΨPMI cos γ
(11.10)
Remember that ΨPM and I are rms values of corresponding sinusoidally varying quantities.
Equation (11.10) is often found in the literature as Tmecc  (3/2)pΨPM I cos γ; in this case,
ΨPM and I indicate peak values of the corresponding sinusoidal quantities.
Also, the synchronous reactance Xs is proportional to ω, and therefore can be
written as
Xs  ωLs
where Ls is the proportionality factor and has the dimensions of an inductance.
Since the copper losses are related to the current ﬂowing in the machine’s stator, it
is convenient, whenever possible, to operate the machine so that γ is zero; this way, for
a given power, there will be minimum current (and thus copper losses).
When γ is zero, the phasor diagram of the machine will be a specialized version of
the diagram of Figure 11.21, and will appear as indicated in Figure 11.22 (from now
on, ΨPM is simply indicated as Ψ).

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

During operation at zero γ, if the machine current is held constant when speed
varies, equation (11.10) says that the torque also stays constant. If this constant value
of the current is the maximum current (also called nominal current,) the torque will
stay constant at its maximum value.
As long as the machine’s angular speed Ω and the angular frequency (ω  pΩ
increase, the machine voltage increases proportionally. Certainly, the process cannot
continue endlessly: when the maximum voltage is reached, control of the machine
must be changed to avoid exceeding this value. The maximum allowed voltage may
be due to the need not to exceed machine insulation or because of the needs of the
electronic converter connected to the machine (remember Figure 11.20).
Once the maximum value Umax for the machine phase voltage has been reached, to
avoid further voltage increases, angle γ must become greater than 0, and the vector
diagram takes the shape already seen in Figure 11.21.
The maximum speed compatible with the condition U  Umax and with γ  0 at the
maximum continuous current In is called base speed of the machine, similar to what
we have already seen for DC and asynchronous AC drives.
By way of an example, at a speed four times the base speed, the diagram has a
shape of the type shown in Figure 11.23.
The condition to be satisﬁed at all speeds, namely,
U £ Umax
can be written in terms of the various quantities applying Carnot’s theorem at the
triangle shown in Figures 11.21 or Figure 11.23 (written for the maximum continuous
current In)7:

At angular speeds higher than Ωb  ωb/p, the condition (11.11) determines the value
of angle γ.
As an example, Figure 11.24 shows, for a wide speed range, the trends of torque,
power voltage, and γ angle for a given couple of Ψ and Ls. To make the numerical
values of both quantities more useful, they are expressed as ratios to signiﬁcant
machine quantities, as directly shown in Figure 11.24 and in its caption.
Figure 11.24 can be commented upon as follows:
• Below the base speed the machine voltage increases proportionally with speed,
and the torque stays at its maximum value.
• Once the base speed has been surpassed, γ must become larger than 0 and the
torque reduces; however, according to equation (11.9), at the beginning the
decrease in power due to the increase of γ does not compensate for the increase
due to the ω growth.
• However, around ω  2.5ωb, the power reaches a maximum, after which the
reduction effect prevails. When at maximum, the current absorbed by the
machine is in phase with the voltage, and therefore the power is 3Umax In.
• Above ω  2.5ωb the current leads the terminal voltage, and the phasor diagram
could be the one represented in Figure 11.23.
During the Whole range of speeds displayed, from base to maximum, power is
sustained; therefore, due to this, this diagram is suitable for installation in a vehicle:
within a speed ratio of 6 (ratio between maximum and base speed) the available power
always remains above 50% of its maximum value.

There is a condition for which the power never reaches its maximum, at least
with our simpliﬁed model. In fact, if the triangle of Figure 11.22 is equilateral,
that is, if it is

the relation (11.11) becomes

(11.12)
At very large values of ω, this relation tends to be satisﬁed with values of γ
approaching 90° that implies (remember Figure 11.23) that the terminal voltage U is
in phase with the current I.
The curves of Figure 11.24, under condition (11.12), thus take the shape of those
shown in Figure 11.25.
Our analysis of the PM machine disregards magnetic anisotropy (see again
Figure 11.19). Anisotropic machines can be demonstrated as having much better
overloading capabilities than isotropic ones (the topic is discussed in [p2]).
Some details on how to determine the currents to be fed into the PM synchronous
machine to obtain the desired value of torque at the various speeds will be discussed in
the next section.
The diagrams shown in Figures 11.24 and 11.25 show only one of the possible
quadrants in the speed–torque plane. Indeed, in many cases more than a single
quadrant is exploited. For instance, for vehicular propulsion, even only for forward
driving, the electrical machine can give positive propulsion force (e.g., when
accelerating) or negative propulsion force (when regenerative braking) when mechan-
ical power is converted into electricity. In this case the drive operates in the two
quadrants in which speed is positive and the torque can have either sign.
In other cases all the four quadrants are needed.
This is possible and easy with all electric drives: DC drives, asynchronous
machine-based drives, and synchronous drives. Therefore, in some cases, the
operating region is often shown as two, or even four, quadrants—that is, all four
regions, as in the two diagrams shown in Figure 11.26.

11.5.3
Control Implementation
The control of PM synchronous machines, when analysed in detail, is very complex.
The basic operation of the control algorithms, however, can be explained rather
simply, since it is a direct consequence of what was said in the previous section
regarding the case of the isotropic machine.
Similarly to the control of the DC machine in Chapter 10, the purpose of the control
system is to deliver a given torque while preventing the machine from exceeding the
maximum current and voltage allowed.
Consider again (11.10):
T  P
Ω  3pΨPM I cos γ
(11.10)
This is the fundamental equation governing our control actions.
As we said in the previous section, at low speeds the control strategy will ﬁrst be to
try to maintain the gamma angle equal to zero and also control the torque acting on the
current entering the machine; at a higher speed, if the maximum current is requested, γ
cannot be maintained at 0, but instead must be raised according to equation (11.11)
and the corresponding diagrams, such as the one shown in Figure 11.24.
Since the angle γ is so important for the machine control, let us ﬁrst recall, before
discussing the control diagrams, what the physical meaning of the γ angle is.
Consider Figure 11.27. In the left-hand part an isotropic rotor of the type shown in
Figure 11.19 is inserted into a synchronous machine stator (whose stator coils are not
represented) while the right-hand one is a slightly modiﬁed version of Figure 11.21.
Since the machine represented has a number of pole pairs p  2, the physical angles
are half the corresponding electrical angles.
Once the physical angles are multiplied by two, the situation is represented as the
phasor diagram shown in the right-hand part of the ﬁgure. The direction of the phasor
current I (which, as discussed in the ﬁrst part of this chapter, is the current ﬂowing in
the coil a of the machine) represents the direction of the rotating ﬁeld produced by the
set of stator currents. Therefore, in the phasor diagram, Ψ a is aligned with I.

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

Consequently, when γ  0 there always exists an angle of 90 degrees between the
angle of the rotor and stator ﬁelds, the latter lagging with respect to the former.
To keep γ  0 the angular position of rotor is measured by a speciﬁc sensor, since
Ψ PM is constant (in amplitude and phase) in a rotor-ﬁxed frame, the rotor position
gives the Ψ PM position; therefore it is possible to operate the converter feeding our
motor so that there is a 90° angle between Ψ PM and I.
Usually, the controller of PM synchronous machines indicates the phasor I, instead
of with its modulus and angle, with its two components along d and q axes, which are
the same as those used in the ﬁrst part of this chapter and also shown in Figure 11.27:
d axis is oriented with the direction of the north pole of the permanent magnets, and q
axis is leading d axis by 90 electrical degrees.
Once I has been decomposed in its d and q components Id and Iq,8 equations (11.9)
and (11.10) can be written as follows:
P  3
2 ω^ΨPMIq;
T  P
Ω  3
2 p^ΨPMIq
(11.13)
This leads to a very effective interpretation of the role of Id and Iq in the machine’s
operation: the torque is produced only by effect of Iq, while Id has the purpose of
weakening the total ﬂux in the machine at higher speeds, and indeed, when γ > 0, it
creates a magnetic ﬁeld component that is opposite to the one created by the rotor’s
permanent magnets (check again Figure 11.27).

Result: Role of Id and Iq in an isotropic PMSM
In a permanent-magnet isotropic synchronous machine:
• The q-axis component Iq of a current is the sole component causing torque
generation. At low speeds (below base speed), only Iq is made to ﬂow in the
machine, since nonzero Id would not have beneﬁcial effects and would increase
copper losses.
• The d-axis component Id of current is null at low speeds. At speeds higher than
base speed, it is negative in value and creates a rotating ﬁeld that counteracts the
PM ﬁeld, to avoid that the machine voltage exceeds the maximum allowed
value Umax. This component causes a reduction in the current available for
torque generation, since it must be I2

q £ 2I2
n (if In is the nominal rms current
value).
Now that we have examined the control strategy (in Section 11.5.2) and recalled
the correspondence between the phasor diagram and physical quantities, the simpli-
ﬁed control diagram shown in Figure 11.28 can be introduced and examined.
The diagram operates as follows:
• Block 1 converts the torque request (T*) into current amplitude (I*) and phase
(γ*) requests: below ωbase angle, γ is set to zero and current I  Iq is determined
by equation (11.12); above ωbase, at a ﬁrst attempt I  Iq is assumed and it is
veriﬁed whether or not a value of γ exists to satisfy equation (11.11); if this is
not possible, I 

and the delivered torque will be lower than T*; the voltage limit Umax is an input,
since it can depend on quantities external to the machine itself—for example,
the DC source voltage.

SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND DRIVES

• Once the three current references are computed, they are compared with the
corresponding values measured on the machine, and the corresponding errors
are derived (one per phase).
• The errors are entered into block 4, the regulator, which computes the actions to
be performed on the electronic converter feeding the machine to offset the
errors, acting on the n signals entering the converter (n is normally equal to six).
• The system is the physical system, depicted in Figure 11.29: it contains the DC
source, the converter, the machine, and the measures of U, UDC, and θ. The
measures UDC and U are usually integrated into the converter, since they must
already be available internally for reasonable converter control.
It must be stressed that actual PMSM controllers are more complicated than those
represented in Figure 11.29, and may also have signiﬁcant differences in architecture.
However, the principle of operation is very often very similar to the one shown in
Figure 11.28 and is therefore useful as a ﬁrst reference.
More in Depth: Ud–Uq control
The diagram shown in Figure 11.28, where phase currents are directly regulated by
block 4, can be implemented in a PPU control which is called “hysteresis control”;
this has not been dealt with in this book and is not frequently used.
A more common control in important drives works in the d–q plane (thus avoiding
hysteresis control), but this requires an intermediate stage in which components Ud
and Uq of voltages (which have never been introduced in this book) are computed.
It can be demonstrated that a conversion can be effected between phase and d–q
quantities by multiplication by a matrix, whose coefﬁcients are a function of angle
θ (under the hypothesis that Aa  Ab  Ac  0):

transformed back into phase quantities in block 4, which also determines the
control signals for the inverter of the system, again the ones shown in Figure 11.28.
Block 5 makes a d–q transformation on the current quantities.
The use of the T transformation (called Park’s transformation after the scientist
who ﬁrst introduced it) has a lot of advantages for the study of synchronous
machines and drives, since it allows analysis during transients and also allows the
analysis of anisotropic machines.

and therefore the condition U £ Umax
can be veriﬁed by closed loop control using the measure of U from Ud and Uq,
instead of open loop from (11.11), as indicated in the above diagram, with the
dashed box and lines. When U tends to overcome Umax, a reduction in Id is
imposed, that limits the availability of Iq, and therefore of torque, according to the
plots of ﬁgure (11.24).
It is ﬁnally to be noted that Umax is not only due to the need to keep within the
maximum machine voltage, but also to the need to allow the PPU to generate the
wanted voltage: in fact, as was seen in Chapter 7, the maximum voltage the PPU
can generate is limited by the available DC-side voltage. Therefore, in applications
in which the DC voltage can vary signiﬁcantly, Umax is proportional to the
measured UDC voltage.

INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES
For the Instructor
This chapter ﬁrst introduces the induction machine, starting with a physical analysis
in a natural progression from the basic analysis described in Chapter 9, and also
drawing on the reader’s knowledge of electromagnetism.
This is followed by an explanation of the commonly used single-phase steady-state
model of induction machines. This model, in addition to steady-state operation, is
able to reproduce slow transients (in which electrical dynamics are disregarded and
the only dynamic taken into account relates to the acceleration of rotating inertias).
Structurally, this is the same as the power transformer-like model found in most
books, already encountered in Chapter 7. All our mathematical analysis is based on
this model, which allows understanding many of the induction machine features in
a very simple way.
As regards induction-motor drives, however, we present a simulation using a more
detailed model. This will help toward a clearer understanding of the limits of
applicability of the steady-state single-phase model.
Finally, we examine single-phase induction motors to see what the most common
household AC machines look like inside and to determine how they work.

12.1
INDUCTION MACHINE BASICS
The induction machine is also called an asynchronous machine. While, in our
opinion, the latter name is more correct (since induction plays a fundamental role
both in synchronous and induction machines), it has the drawback of being very
similar to synchronous machines, which may be confusing.
Like the synchronous machine, the induction machine is a bidirectional electro-
mechanical converter—that is, a system able to convert electrical energy into
mechanical form (when it operates as a motor) and vice versa (when it operates
as a generator). It is, however, much more frequently used as a motor than as a
generator, for reasons that will be discussed later.
As regards its construction, the machine stator is substantially identical to the
one used for the synchronous machine, and discussed in Chapters 9 and 11 (see
Figure 12.1a). For the induction machine also, the windings are normally distributed
along the air gap, although for simplicity’s sake in the ﬁgures of this chapter they are
represented as being concentrated in a single turn. Moreover, also for this machine,
the windings can have a number of pole pairs p, different from one.
The rotor is constituted by a three-phase system of windings, such as the one
shown in Figure 12.1b, but with conductor bars distributed along the air gap and not
concentrated in single turns. These three windings are connected to each other, or, to
use a common expression, they are short-circuited, as in Figure 12.1b, which refers to
the winding star connection.
To be more accurate, we could say that the induction machine rotors can have two
possible constructions: wound and squirrel cage. The wound rotor is constituted by
three coils that are star- or delta-connected, whose free ends are short-circuited. A
wound rotor with a single turn per phase has the appearance of Figure 12.1b.
Normally, and similarly to the synchronous machine, both stator and rotor coils
are distributed along the air gap, spanned through several slots; the different turns of
the same coil are connected in series using connections at the two machine ends.

INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES

Induction machines with wound rotors have the advantage of giving access, when
needed, to the rotor windings, mainly for starting the machine, as discussed in the
more in depth text of Section 12.2. The more frequent rotor construction, however, is
the so-called squirrel-cage rotor, depicted in Figure 12.2.
The right-hand part of the ﬁgure shows a view orthogonal to the rotor axis, while
the left-hand part is a perspective view of the conductors only. The longitudinal
conductor bars are connected to the two front rings. This construction makes the rotor
equivalent to a multiphase system of windings: each phase is constituted by a single
bar; one of the two rings is the centre of the star connection of the bars, white the other
is the short-circuit connection.
The squirrel-cage construction gives no access to the rotor conductors, but is much
simpler, more rugged, and cheaper than the wound rotor. In fact, the wound
construction nowadays tends to be phased out.
In cases in which frequent starting operations or even a continuous variation of
speed is required (e.g., in the operation of a lift1 or an electric car) a much more
ﬂexible operation of an induction machine can be obtained by varying stator feeding
frequency, as discussed in Section 12.4. This, however, requires the addition of a
complex power electronic converter between the machine and the power supply.
To understand the operating principle of an induction machine, imagine its stator
winding, whose rotor is initially at standstill, connected to an external three-phase
source of power, which, for our purposes, is constituted by an ideal three-phase set of
ideal sinusoidal sources (Figure 12.3).
We analyse the machine under the assumption that the electric parts of the machine
are in steady state; that is, all electrical transients can be ignored, and all the AC
quantities are sinusoidal. Under this assumption, we understand, from what we know
from the study of Chapters 5 and 6, that all voltages and currents in the machine are
sine waves. In particular, we can state that the three currents drawn by the machine
from the source are sinusoids. We can also assume that the machine has full three-
phase symmetry: there is no reason to think that what happens in phase a should be
different from what happens in phase b or c, except for the time displacement induced
by one of the three sources.

acceleration/deceleration phases, which require variable-speed operation of the machine.
INDUCTION MACHINE BASICS

Therefore, after this simple qualitative reasoning, we can conclude that the three
currents constitute a three-phase balanced set, as shown also in Figure 12.3.
This set of currents, because of the rotating ﬁeld theorem (Section 11.2.1), will
create a rotating ﬁeld Bs that produces—in any of the rotor windings—sine ﬂux
linkages which, in turn, induce a three-phase set of EMFs, by Faraday’s law.
These EMFs induced in the rotor, since the rotor windings are short-circuited,
create a three-phase set of currents. These, in turn, generate a new rotating ﬁeld which
combines with the one produced by the stator currents.
So the global operation of the machine is determined by the total ﬂux density ﬁeld
B—that is, the combination of stator and rotor ones:
B  Bstat  Brot
The EMF created on any of the rotor conductors can be evaluated using equation (9.2):
ePQ  vrel  B
j
jl  vrelB?l
(9.2)
Now the speed vrel is the speed of the rotor conductor as measured in a frame that is
rotating along with B, or a B-ﬁxed frame,2 and B? is the component orthogonal to vrel,
and therefore is the radial component Br.
The reference polarity of ePQ should be set in such a way that v, B, and a vector
going from Q to P have a right-hand orientation; therefore the “” marking on e must
be set using the right-hand rule, as shown in Figure 12.4, for which B is assumed to be
rotating (in a stationary frame of reference) counter clockwise.
The stator windings can be created using just two poles, or several pole pairs.
The construction of multi-pole-pair windings is the same as that of synchronous
machines and some details can thus be found in Chapter 12. Moreover, the stator
coils are distributed along the air gap, so the voltage produced by N turns is kwN
times the voltage of a single turn, where kw is the dimensionless factor discussed in
Section 9.3.3.

2The rotating ﬁeld theorem states that a balanced set of currents will generate an induction wave on the air
gap, which is sinusoidal and rotates at a speed that for a p pole-pair machine is Ω0  ω/p, ω being the radian
frequency of the currents. When we state here “a B-ﬁxed frame,” therefore, we refer to a frame of reference
that is rotating at the same angular speed Ω0 and the same direction as the rotating ﬁeld. It will be soon seen
that both ﬁelds Bstat and Brot rotate at the same speed Ω0.
376
INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES

Therefore, the total voltage amplitude of a coil containing N distributed turns and p
pole pairs can be expressed using equation (9.11), that is:
^Ecoil  kNωBA  kNpΩBA
Any of the rotor conductors is thus subject to ﬁeld B, which belongs to the plane
orthogonal to the conductors itself. Being traversed by currents, each rotor conductor
is therefore subject to Lorentz’s force (9.5):
F  I  B ? l;
F  I ? B? ? l
(9.5)
in which the direction of F is determined by using the right-hand rule with vectors I
(having the same direction as the conductor and arrowhead at the same end as the
arrowhead of I) and B. The force has the direction shown in Figure 12.4. It tends to
move the rotor in a direction which opposes the ﬂux variation—that is, in the example
given, counterclockwise.
Now that the rotor is rotating, what happens inside the machine? The reasoning
above can be repeated: there still exist three stator currents which create a stator
rotating ﬁeld that generates three EMFs on the rotor. These, in turn, generate three
currents, and forces, on the rotor conductors.
The ﬁeld rotational speed is the same as before, since it depends only on the
angular frequency ω of the supply voltages and on the number of the machine’s pole
pairs p:
Ω0  ω=p

center.
INDUCTION MACHINE BASICS
377

By effect of this speed, EMFs are induced in the rotor, constituting a three-phase set.
The angular frequency of these voltages is related to the relative movement of rotor
and stator ﬁeld:
ωrot  pΩ0  Ω
and therefore each of the three induced voltages will have as amplitude
^Ecoil  kNωrotBA
In the rotor coils, these voltages will induce currents that constitute a three-phase
balanced set, which in turn will generate a rotating ﬁeld. This, in a frame reference
rotating with the rotor, will rotate at the speed
ωrot=p  Ω0  Ω
(12.1)
The ﬁeld produced by the rotor currents, evaluated in a stationary frame, will then
rotate at a speed equal to Ω0—that is, the same speed as the stator ﬁeld.
This is an important conclusion:
Result: Rotational speed of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the rotor
In an induction machine, the rotating ﬁeld generated by the rotor’s currents rotates
at the same speed as the ﬁeld produced by the stator’s currents. This speed is called
synchronous speed and is equal to the angular frequency of the source, divided by
the number of machine pole pairs.
As long as the rotor speed Ω remains lower than the synchronous speed Ω0, forces
will be generated on the rotor conductors which will globally produce a positive
torque that will tend to accelerate the rotor. But when the actual speed approaches Ω0,
the reason for the torque to be generated (i.e. a relative motion between rotor and
rotating ﬁelds) will tend to vanish. When the speed is exactly synchronous, the torque
will be zero, because in a rotor-ﬁxed frame of reference, the machine ﬁeld will be seen
to be stationary, and therefore no EMF is generated.
In the next section a very simple and effective mathematical model will be
presented that allows the electrical and mechanical quantities of the machine to be
quantitatively evaluated at the various speeds.
12.2
MACHINE MODEL AND ANALYSIS
In the previous section, a description of the physical phenomena occurring within the
induction machine was shown under the hypothesis that the machine operates in
steady state, it is physically symmetric, and it is connected to a three-phase balanced
system of voltages.
378
INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES

Under these assumptions, the currents absorbed by the machine also constitute a
balanced three-phase system of currents, and the behaviour of the machine can be
analysed using the single-phase equivalent concept (see the relevant section of
Chapter 6 for a reminder of this concept).
We will now examine this equivalent circuit and its usage. It is not derived from
electromagnetic equations so as to reduce the mathematical burden for the reader.
Before introducing the single-phase equivalent of an asynchronous machine, a
very important quantity is to be deﬁned, the so-called slip s of the machine:
s  Ω0  Ω
Ω0
(12.2)
When a machine is at a standstill, its speed Ω is zero and the slip is unity. When the
rotor rotates at the same speed as the rotating ﬁelds Ω0—that is, when no current is
induced in the rotor and therefore no torque is produced—slip is zero. In all the other
cases, some power is converted between the electrical circuit and the mechanical shaft
of the machine.
Using equation (12.1) and (12.2), it can be immediately demonstrated that the
frequency of rotor currents and EMFs is
f r  ωrot=2π  sf
(12.3)
where f is the frequency of electrical (stator) supply. Equation (12.2) can also be
written expressing speeds in terms of revolutions per minute (rpm):
s  n0  n

n0  60Ω0

the synchronous speed n0, the rotor speed n, the frequency fr of rotor currents, and
the speed of the rotor rotating ﬁeld with respect to the rotor (nrr) and with respect to the
ground (nr).
Expressing speeds in revolutions per minute (rpm), we obtain

Readers will have certainly noted a strong similarity to the transformer circuit. Indeed the
very mechanism of power transfer from the stator to the rotor has a lot in common with
the power transfer from the primary to secondary windings of a transformer. Readers are
invited to ﬁnd similarities between the two machines, after reading and studying this
chapter.
The two curved dashed lines indicate important physical transformations: The
leftmost part of the circuit models the stator quantities, the air-gap dashed curve is
then crossed, and the circuit section describes what happens in the rotor. The right-
most section of the circuit represents the mechanical shaft.
Let’s ﬁrst analyse the circuit in terms of power. The powers shown in the circuit
are, obviously, always one-third of those circulating in the actual machine.
Therefore, the power Us Is cos φ entering the leftmost terminals is one-third of

(12.7)
From this gross mechanical power, with the obvious deduction of mechanical losses
in the bearings and in the resistance encountered by the rotor by effect of the air

The power ﬂows in the machine are summarized in Figure 12.6.

being constant, if the mechanical load and the machine speed are constant, also the
delivered torque is not ﬂuctuating. This is one of the main advantages of three-phase
induction machines with respect to its single-phase counterpart, which will be brieﬂy
discussed in Section 12.5.

Let us now brieﬂy consider the meaning of the reactances present in the machine
equivalent circuit:
• reactance Xs  ωLs, where Ls is the proportionality coefﬁcient between the stator
current and the stator leakage linked ﬂux—that is, the quote of the linked ﬂux
created by the stator currents that does not cross the air gap, and therefore does
not interact with the rotor;
• reactance X0
r  α2ωLr, where Lr is the proportionality coefﬁcient between the
rotor current and the rotor leakage linked ﬂux—that is, the quote of the linked
ﬂux created by the rotor currents that does not cross the air gap, and therefore
does not interact with the stator;
• Xi  ωLi where Li is the proportionality coefﬁcient between the stator currents
and the linked ﬂux that crosses the air gap.
The equivalent circuit has longitudinal components Rs, Xs, R0
r, and X0
r and
transverse components Xi and Ri. In normal machine operation, all the longitudinal
impedances are much smaller than the transverse one. Only when s is near to one is the
situation different, since the load resistor Rm,eq is null. In this situation, which occurs
at start-up, very large currents are drawn from the mains and ﬂow through the
machine, a situation which is similar to short-circuit conditions in power systems. For
this reason, the longitudinal impedance Rs  R0
r  jXs  X0
r is also called “short-
circuit impedance” (Z sc). In fact, dividing the supply voltage by Z sc, we obtain the
“short-circuit current,” which corresponds (neglecting I i) both to the starting current
and to the current absorbed by the machine when it is kept blocked and is fed from the
mains. As discussed below, this test is used by engineers to evaluate the numerical
values of the equivalent circuit parameters; obviously the test is operated at reduced
voltage, in order to avoid damages due to the high currents that would otherwise
circulate.
This gives us a ﬁrst indication that the start-up currents of this kind of machine are
much larger than the currents occurring in steady state, and therefore either frequent
start-ups must be avoided or the machine must be sized to withstand these larger
currents. A typical application in which the machine operates with frequent start-ups
is in lifts.
Since the single-phase equivalent circuit contains only reactors and resistors, it is
obvious that in all its operating conditions the machine will absorb active and reactive
power, and therefore its power factor is always lagging.
MACHINE MODEL AND ANALYSIS
385

Indeed, the statement that the machine “always absorbs active power” needs to be
corrected since the load resistance is a ﬁctitious one and, for negative slips, it has a
negative value. Under these conditions—that is, when the machine rotor rotates at
a speed Ω larger than Ω0—the slip s becomes negative, the resistor Rm,eq (equa-
tion 12.6) actually delivers power, and the machine operates as a generator.
Even when the machine generates active power, however, it still absorbs reactive
power, since the reactive components of the equivalent circuit remain positive.
The single-phase equivalent enables important parameters to be determined as a
function of the rotational speed Ω of the machine rotor, like the current absorbed from
the supply network and the generated mechanical torque.
Here, for simplicity’s sake, this is computed disregarding the effects of the
transversal components Ri and Xi. This will introduce some error, but the results
obtained are qualitatively correct. The simpliﬁed circuit can be expressed in one of the
two forms shown in Figure 12.7, in which, obviously, X  Xs  X0
r. Note that if the
two resistances R0
r and Rm,eq are summed, the resulting resistor will absorb Pag, which
is equal to the sum of the generated mechanical power and the rotor’s copper losses.
We want now to derive the absorbed current and produced torque under the
condition Us  const. Indeed, as a further approximation, we consider here that the
voltage U1 instead of Us is constant.
Using the right-hand circuit in Figure 12.7, the following can be written:

If we imagine the rotor speed Ω to go from zero to Ω0, the corresponding slip will
go from one to zero; the denominator of the fraction describing I2 will steadily grow,
and therefore the current I will decrease monotonically.

Note that while ^s depends on the rotor’s resistance, ^Tmg does not.
^Tmg is normally called the pull-out torque of the machine.7

MACHINE MODEL AND ANALYSIS

These curves were derived using realistic numerical parameters of a 50-kW
squirrel-cage machine, which has a pull-out torque that is 2.35 times the starting
torque. The starting torque can be higher than the value depicted in the ﬁgure, but this
is obtained using a larger rotor resistance, thus reducing machine efﬁciency.
Conversely, in order to have high efﬁciency, the copper losses and the rotor resistance
must be small, but this reduces the starting torque (if pull-out torque is left
unchanged).
The torque, as expected, becomes zero when the synchronism speed Ω0 is reached,
then it reverses, s becomes negative, and the machine operates as a generator. Obviou-
sly, for the generator region to be actually reached, a mechanical motor (i.e., a device
able to supply mechanical power) should attached to the machine shaft.
Normally, however, as already noted, induction machines are operated as motors.
The curves shown in Figure 12.8 clearly show that the normal operation zone of the
machine is between the pull-out torque (either positive or negative) and the synchro-
nous speed. For example, the torque T1 can be delivered at the speed corresponding to
points P and Q; but point P, while corresponding to a much lower mechanical power,
implies the absorption of a much higher current and losses! In the next section it will
be shown that by using a motor drive it is possible to deliver a given torque at different
speeds while absorbing roughly the same current from the supply.
The nominal torque Tnom normally indicates the torque that can be delivered
continuously, without damage; its product by the corresponding speed will give the
nominal machine power. Tnom is much lower than the maximum torque ^Tmg;
for example, it could be ^Tmg=3. The speed at which nominal torque and powers
are delivered (“full load” condition) is the machine’s nominal speed; the current
absorbed when the nominal power is delivered is the nominal current Inom and is
typically 5–7 times lower than the starting current.

for any working condition. This observation is very useful to correlate Tmg0, ^Tmg, and
Tnom with their correspondent currents.

current is six times the nominal one. Calculate the ratio between the starting and the

The zone between Ω  0 and Ω  ^Ω is normally referred to as an unstable region,
while the region between ^Ω and Ω0 is considered stable. This is not completely correct
since stability depends on the dynamic behaviour of a system, while the torque curves
we are discussing are stationary. However, there is some truth in it: In the more
common cases, indeed, equilibrium points between the torque characteristic of the
machine and of the load are stable only (in the machine operating as a motor) between
^Ω and Ω0.
The operation of an induction machine as a motor with its mechanical load is
depicted in Figure 12.9, which shows both the motive torque Tm delivered by the
machine and the resistive one absorbed by the load Tload (a fan is shown as an
example).
Just to give a qualitative explanation of “stable and unstable regions” of the torque
curve of the machine, consider that the system operates at the equilibrium point P
between the machine torque and a possible load torque Tunst. Should there be a slight
increase in Ω, the machine torque becomes larger than the load, and the speed tends to
increase further. Also, should there be a speed decrease, the system tends to move far
from the equilibrium point. This does not happen in the case of point P and load curve
Tst, nor in the case of point Q of intersection with curve Tload, which shows stable
behaviour.
From Figure 12.9 it is possible to form an idea of a starting-up transient of the
machine, using the mechanical equation

where J is obviously the combined moment of inertia of machine and mechanical
load. The difference between the motive and the load torque is called accelerating
torque, since it is proportional to the rotational acceleration _Ω.
It must, however, be clariﬁed that the shapes shown in Figures 12.8 and 12.9 are
valid only as a ﬁrst approximation, since they are computed using the equivalent
circuit that was drawn assuming steady-state operation of the machine, while during
the transient, especially the ﬁrst part, their actual behaviour is rather different.
The shape of the torque of an induction machine has the inconvenience that its
start-up value is smaller—often much smaller—than the peak torque and that during
start-up the currents absorbed by the machine are very high. This can be mitigated by
the use of wound-rotor machines or can be solved, but at greater cost, by adopting
electric drives instead of simple machines.
As seen earlier, wound–rotor machines allow access to the rotor windings, to
connect them electrically to a stationary circuit, usually for limited durations.
Consider now that according to equation (12.11) the slip at which the machine
torque has its maximum is ^s  R0
r=X  α2Rr=X and is therefore proportional to the
rotor resistance, while the corresponding maximum torque ^Tdoes not depend on this
resistance. Wound-rotor machines can thus be started by inserting, in series with the
rotor windings at slow speed, additional resistors R1, R2, . . . which are progressively
bypassed, as far as the speed increases (Figure 12.10). This is done by collecting
currents to the rotor coils through slip-ring/brush coupling, of the same type as those
present in synchronous machines, using three rings to obtain the three-phase set of
currents.
When the system is near to its steady-state speed, all the external resistors are
bypassed and, by means of a special mechanical arrangement, the rotor windings are
short-circuited; the brushes are then lifted from the rings to avoid friction and the wear
and tear of brushes.
This system is now becoming obsolete, since it has several disadvantages
compared to the more modern solution of using induction motor drives, which are
discussed in the next section: the external resistors produce extra losses, and the ring–
brush connection is mechanically complicated and expensive and requires mainte-
nance; furthermore, the change between the different torque curves is discrete and not
continuous.
To enhance the machine’s starting torque without reducing its efﬁciency too much,
some means must be provided to enlarge rotor resistance at starting time, without

signiﬁcantly affecting it near synchronous speed. For example, some dependence of
Rr from slip s can be introduced. This is done by using techniques that cannot be
described here. The interested user is advised to refer to [bm1] or [bm5].
The ﬁnal result is a torque curve that has a similar trend to the one shown in
Figures 12.8 and 12.9 near synchronous speed, while experiencing higher values at
larger slips.
The induction machine’s torque–speed curves are classiﬁed by NEMA (National
Electric Manufacturer’s Association) of the United States. The most common
standard design types, named B, C, and D, have curves that are qualitatively shown
in Figure 12.11. On the vertical axes the torques are shown as a ratio to the nominal
torque. As previously stated, usually the higher the ratio pull-out/starting torque, the
higher the efﬁciency. This is true also for the NEMA curves. For instance, design D is
very good for starting but has a low efﬁciency; design B has reasonable starting and
pull-out torques and therefore is the most widely used design for general-purpose
applications, while design C has a high starting torque (but lower than design D) but
intermediate efﬁciency and pull-out torque.
When an induction machine is required to operate at continuously variable speed,
such as in electric trains or cars, the mechanical characteristic of the machine fed at
constant voltage and frequency, such as that shown in Figure 12.8 and 12.9, is totally
inadequate.
In these cases, induction machines can be used and are indeed used frequently
today, using special devices to feed them, which are able to generate voltages with the
desired frequency and amplitude. The machine and the feeding system constitute a
subsystem that is called “motor drive.” Some basic information about induction
machine-based motor drives is given in Section 12.4.
12.3
NO-LOAD AND BLOCKED-ROTOR TESTS
A method for determining the parameters of the equivalent circuit of an induction
machine consists of two tests: the no-load test and the blocked-rotor test.
In the former, the nominal voltage is applied to the machine while leaving the rotor
free to rotate (no mechanical load is applied, thus Ω ≅Ω0 and Ir ≅0). The current I0

absorbed by the motor is measured, as well as the correspondent active power P0
(dissipated by Rs and Ri; see Figure 12.5). Since the stator current and the corre-
sponding copper losses are small, P0 is a good estimation of stator iron losses8 (at low
slip, rotor losses are always negligible in an induction machine, since the rotor
frequency is low). Such losses, which strictly depend on the voltage applied to Ri,
remain practically constant for any loading condition, provided that the machine is
supplied around its nominal voltage.

The second test is performed by increasing the supply voltage until the nominal
current Inom is absorbed by the motor, the rotor being mechanically blocked. The
corresponding voltage Usc is then measured, as well as the active power Psc. Since Usc
is usually only a low percentage of the nominal voltage, during this test Ii it can be
disregarded because it is much smaller than Is  Inom; thus the power absorbed by Ri is
much lower than the one consumed by Rs and R0
r. For this reason, Psc is a good
estimation of copper losses at rated current; in any other loading condition, total
copper losses can be estimated as follows:

particular, AC electric drives were examined in Section 11.5.1, to which the
reader is referred. Here only the ﬁgure describing a DC-fed electric drive is recalled
(Figure 12.12).
Details of the converters able to perform the functions shown in Figure 12.12 are given in
Chapter 8. The present chapter was deliberately written in such a way that it can be
understood without the need to read Chapter 8, which should thus be considered a more-
in-depth analysis of converters and drives.
In this section we will learn how to operate the inverter in order to obtain a good
performance in variable-speed operation from the machine.
Consider the expressions of the machine current and torque, derived in Sec-

Let us evaluate what happens to these expressions when the machine is fed in such a
way that it is

(12.12)
that is, the machine is fed in such a way that the supply frequency and voltage always
remain proportional to each other (remember that Ω0  ω/p  2πf/p).
Because of its importance, a supply compliant with (12.12) has a name of its own:
It is normally called constant voltage/frequency supply.

Equations (12.13) and (12.14) indicate that when the machine is fed according to
(12.12) the current absorbed and the torque produced depend only on ΔΩ  Ω0  Ω
and not on Ω0 alone.
Since the shape of Tmg as a function of ΔΩ does not depend on Ω0, it can be derived
as seen in the previous section. Evidently, the function T(Ω) is the same one as in
previous ﬁgures, shown again in Figure 12.13. Changing Ω0 leaves the shape intact;
only the curve is translated in such a way that the torque becomes zero for the given
value of Ω0.
This technique can be used so that the machine always operates in the most
efﬁcient region of the curve T(Ω), i.e. between ^Ω and Ω0. In this region, as was seen
earlier, the torque is delivered at the lowest current and highest efﬁciency.
As an example, Figure 12.14 shows the same machine starting, as simulated, with
sufﬁciently detailed PPU machine models, under two conditions: using a constant
terminal voltage and using the technique (12.12). In the latter case, during start-up, Ω0
is continuously changed in such a way that ΔΩ  Ω0Ω  constant, and therefore, the
torque generated according to the theory developed is constant. The value of ΔΩ is
such that the machine-generated torque is larger than the load torque. When the radian
frequency ωbase  Ωbase/p is reached,9 however, the electric supply system works at
that frequency and the system reaches its equilibrium point. The ﬁgure is obtained
using a simulation programme that models the machine with a higher level of detail.

INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES

To understand the shown plots, it must ﬁrst be noted that the time span is ﬁve
seconds; therefore sinusoids operating at 50 Hz are seen as a thick band, since they
evolve too rapidly to be seen well in the shown scale. This is particularly true for the
top left-hand plot, in which the uniform band represents a constant-amplitude,
constant-frequency 50-Hz sinusoid.
To facilitate comparisons, the vertical range of left- and right-hand plots are equal
to each other for corresponding variables.
We want to make the following remarks:
• At the beginning of the transient, in the case of constant-frequency supply, the
torque shows a high-frequency ﬂuctuation around a steadily increasing value.
This ﬂuctuation is basically due to the fact that initially the three stator currents
are not balanced, and the corresponding rotating ﬁeld has a variable amplitude.
This actually occurs in real machines but cannot be highlighted here by the
equivalent circuit-based model used, since all electrical transients are disre-
garded. In the variable-frequency supply the torque ﬂuctuation is reduced to a
minimum.
• In the simulation proposed here, the variable-frequency supply allows the
machine to be started up in the same time, but at a much lower current and
torque ﬂuctuations.
The supply voltages and frequencies required to obtain the curves shown in the
right-hand part of Figure 12.14 are obtained using a control logic of the type described
in Figure 12.15.
The reference torque during the start-up T* is ﬁrst converted into a ΔΩ signal

value Δ^Ω to impose operation of the machine in the more efﬁcient zone of its torque.
Adding the measured value Ωmeas of Ω determines the synchronous speed Ω0, which
is converted into frequency using the pole pairs number p. Before this, the Ω0 signal is
saturated to the steady-state desired value Ω0ss, since the machine is to be started up at
this value of synchronous speed. Once the frequency is known, the voltage U1  kf * is
known and from it, using the estimate I* of the current computed from T*, we can
determine the voltage U* desired at the machine terminals.
As already mentioned, a start-up which is faster than that shown in the right-hand
part of Figure 12.15 is simply obtained by raising T*, which in turn will raise ΔΩ in
proportion.
The values of the voltage U* and frequency f* to be applied to the machine are then
transferred to the supply system, which creates a three-phase voltage supply with this
amplitude and frequency.
It is apparent that variable-frequency control allows the machine to stay stable at
any speed, because the currents are kept under control. The value of ΔΩ determines
the torque and the current, the latter being the value corresponding to the more
efﬁcient region of the torque-speed curve of the machine—that is, the one between ^Ω
and Ω0.
The operation of the induction machine under (12.12) is also called constant ﬂux
operation. This is because the voltage U1 corresponds in the machine to the EMF
produced by the ﬂux linked with the stator Ψ . For each phase we have
U1  jωΨ
and therefore U1/f  const implies Ψ  const.
As speed increases, the voltage to be applied to the machine terminals increases.
When the maximum continuous voltage of the machine is reached (normally called
nominal voltage), this quantity cannot be increased further, while it may happen that a
further increase in speed is required. The speed that corresponds to the nominal
voltage is normally called the base speed of the machine. Beyond the base speed,
the voltage is kept constant while Ω0 is raised, increasing the frequency of the supply
voltages. In these conditions, the curve of the torque is progressively reduced, being
proportional to 1/Ω0

The full picture of the machine, showing the constant ﬂux and ﬂux weakening parts,
is shown in Figure 12.16. It shows the zone below Ωbase, in which the torque
characteristics translate, and also shows the zone above this value where the torque
reduces in proportion to 1/Ω0
2. A possible shape of the load torque Tload and a possible
locus of the machine operating points Tm  T1oad  J _Ω are also shown.
Using this Tm, the mechanical power increases linearly in the constant ﬂux region;
when Ωbase is overcome, the Tm locus shown in the ﬁgure is such that the power P is

maintained constant and therefore the actual torque reduces in proportion to Ω0. Since
the machine torque shape reduces in proportion to 1/Ω0
2, the machine operating point
becomes increasingly near to the peak torque.
It is fairly obvious that the zone with the ﬂux reduction cannot be very large,
because of the corresponding torque reduction. A typical ratio of Ωmax/Ωbase does not
exceed 2 in a normal induction drive.
A few ﬁnal words about induction motor drives.
The constant voltage/frequency control enables the machine to be used smoothly
and efﬁciently at all speeds. However, in fast-changing conditions it is not optimal
because its theory comes from a steady-state model of the machine.
More advanced control techniques, normally called vector control, which keep the
inner machine magnetic ﬁeld under control, are used today in advanced drives and
perform better in dynamic conditions.
These techniques, however, are well beyond the scope of this book and will not be
dealt with here.

SINGLE-PHASE INDUCTION MOTORS
12.5.1
Introduction
In this book we will use the term single-phase induction motors for small motors with
an operating principle similar to the three-phase motors dealt with in this chapter, but
fed by a single phase sinusoidal supply. In some books, such as reference [bm6], they
are also called two-phase motors since they have two stator windings.
While three-phase induction motors are prevalent in medium and large-power
applications, for domestic appliances, where distribution is single phase and power is
very low, it is usual to use single-phase induction motors. They are common in
washing machines, fans, refrigerators, air conditioners, and so on.
In this section, single-phase induction motors are qualitatively evaluated. A more
analytical treatment of the topic can be found in reference [bm6].
Consider at ﬁrst an asynchronous (aka induction) machine containing a single
winding on the stator and fed by a single-phase, constant-frequency AC source.

It could be experimentally veriﬁed that it would have a torque–speed curve with the
shape, as qualitatively represented in Figure 12.17, with a solid line. In the region near
to synchronous speed, it is very similar to the shape already seen for three-phase
machines, but the behaviour is very different at low speeds: the single-phase machine
develops zero torque at zero speed! This impedes the natural starting of this motor,
since there always exists some—large or small—load torque at zero speed.
This characteristic can be explained by considering what happens when a machine
contains a single winding. An alternating current ﬂowing across it generates, along the
winding axis (and at the air-gap position), an induction B whose values do vary as a
sine wave over time but do not constitute a wave moving along the air gap.
This induction can be assumed to be composed of two different B’s, Bc and Bcc,
which rotate clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively:
ω 
ω 
Bcc
Bc
B
a
|B|=B 
|Bcc|=|Bc|=B/2
If the rotational speed is ω, the component of B along axis a (the axis of the unique
winding of the machine) is
Ba  Bc;a  Bcc;a  B
2 cos ωt  B
2 cos ωt  B cos ωt
The machine’s behaviour is, according to this simple explanation, determined by the
presence of both Bc and Bcc. Therefore, the torque generated can be imagined to be the
sum of two different curves: one due to Bc, the other to Bcc. The machine’s rotor,
however, rotates in one of two possible directions: either Bc’s or Bcc’s (see again
Figure 12.17, in which it is supposed that Bc is rotating in the same direction as the
machine’s rotor).
This is a simpliﬁed explanation of the machine’s behaviour which, however, is
sufﬁcient for our purposes.

INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES

The explanation of the machine’s behaviour based on the two counter-rotating
ﬁelds also explains torque oscillation which is present in single-phase induction
motors. This is caused by interaction between the two ﬁelds. If we analyse the
machine from a system rotating at the (positive) synchronous speed, the ﬁeld Bc is
stationary within this reference, as discussed at the end of Section 12.1 and shown in a
“Result” box. Therefore, the torque produced is constant. However, as seen from this
same reference, Bcc is rotating at 2ω. The interaction between Bc and Bcc produces an
oscillating torque with an angular frequency of 2ω.
The ﬂuctuation of the machine’s torque is related also to the ﬂuctuation of the
instantaneous power of any single-phase AC circuit (see Chapter 5): if the instanta-
neous power at the electric terminals were converted into mechanical power, because
of the rotor’s inertia, the ﬂuctuation would immediately be transferred onto the
electromechanical torque.
In fact it is
Pm  TmΩ
(°)
Pm ﬂuctuates, as mentioned, at twice the synchronous speeds:
Ωfluct  2Ω0  2pω
where Ω0 is the synchronous speed, ω is the angular frequency, and p is the number of the
machine’s pole pairs. The rotor’s inertia causes the Ω variation to be much lower than the
Pm variation, and therefore speed ﬂuctuation is negligible; thus the ﬂuctuation of power
is nearly totally transferred into the ﬂuctuation of the torque [consider again equation (°)].
A reduction of the mechanical power ﬂuctuation can be obtained by introducing
some ﬂuctuating storage of energy between the machine’s terminals and air gap. This
is exploited in the capacitor-start/capacitor-run motor, discussed in the next section.
To make a single-phase AC machine perform more like a three-phase machine, the
stator is made using two windings instead of one, physically displaced in the
machine’s air-gap periphery by 90° (electrical).
These two windings, if fed with currents with a phase difference of 90°, are able to
create a rotating ﬁeld just like the one created by a three-phase machine. The
demonstration is omitted here, but it is very similar to the demonstration of three-
windings physically displaced by 120°, shown in Section 10.2.1:
Result: The rotating ﬁeld on two-phase machines
If two sine currents with equal amplitudes, 90° relative phase displacement and
angular frequency ω, are introduced into windings that are physically separated by
90° (electrical), a ﬁeld is produced that is equivalent to a uniform distribution ﬁeld
rotating at a constant electrical speed ω.
SINGLE-PHASE INDUCTION MOTORS
401

The vast majority of single-phase AC machines are fed from a single-phase source
containing these two windings. The difference between one machine type and another
resides in the physical structure (e.g., the conductor’s cross-sectional area) of these
windings and depends on how these are fed, exploiting the unique single-phase AC
source available.
12.5.2
Different Motor Types
It was mentioned at the end of the previous section that the single-phase machines
considered here have two windings. Since in general they are not identical to each
other, normally they are indicated as main (subscript “m”) and auxiliary (subscript
“a”) coils.
A possible single-phase AC machine is the so-called capacitor-less motor
(Figure 12.18). In this machine, the auxiliary winding uses conductors with smaller
cross-sectional area A than those of the main. This will imply a larger resistance
according to the resistance law (Section 4.2.2):
R  ρ l
A  l
σA
Its structure is sketched in the left-hand part of Figure 12.18.
As a consequence, currents I m and I a will have a qualitative relative position like
those shown in the phasor diagram in Figure 12.18: since the displacement is not 90°
and the amplitudes are not equal, the ﬁeld will be composed of a rotating and a
stationary part; the rotating component will cause enough torque to be generated at
starting.
When the machine has started, near 75% of the synchronous speed, the switch S is
opened, and only the main coil operates. The opening of S is automatic, usually by
means of a centrifugal device.
Another solution, called permanent-capacitor motor, is described in Figure 12.19.
In this case, the presence of a capacitor in series with the auxiliary winding causes
it to absorb a current that leads voltage U and has large phase displacement with I m
(which is lagging); this allows the generation of some starting torque.

INDUCTION MACHINES AND DRIVES

The capacitor value is optimized for the rated load, for which it can create a near-
ideal condition, with I a and I m equal in amplitude and displaced by 90°, which could
in principle create a pure rotating ﬁeld and no ﬂuctuating torque.
To enhance the starting torque, while keeping the optimization of the two currents
in nominal conditions, a common solution is the capacitor-start/capacitor-run motor,
shown in Figure 12.20.
The circuit with S closed is optimized for start-up, while the circuit with S open for
a normal run. The commutation (opening of S) normally occurs at around 75% of the
synchronous speed and is automatic, usually by means of a centrifugal device.
Another possibility is the capacitor-start motor (Figure 12.21). Here the capacitor
is used only for starting; it is sized for intermittent operation and is therefore cheap,
while near synchronous speed the machine operates with a single active winding.
This gives enough torque, albeit signiﬁcant ﬂuctuating torque which creates vibra-
tion and noise.

The four single-phase induction motors are in a kind of order: the capacitor-less
motor capacitor has the lowest cost and worst performance, next comes the permanent
capacitor motor, and then the capacitor-start motor. The capacitor-start/capacitor-run
is the most effective and expensive solution.
The choice between the different options depends on cost, quality (quietness), and
starting torque required.

LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL
INSTALLATIONS
For the Instructor
The main purpose of this chapter is to give students an understanding of how low-
voltage electrical installations are structured and how to determine the required
sizes of cables and circuit breakers. We will develop a theory and supply numerical
tables to facilitate the explanation of simple examples. However, we are unable,
within the limits of this book, to show enough numerical tables to allow readers to
determine the cables and breakers of electrical installations in a sufﬁciently large
number of cases.
A good guide on how to design electrical installations, covering the topics of this
chapter and much more, is the [bp2].
13.1
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE CONCEPT OF THE ELECTRIC
POWER SYSTEM
Electric power systems were introduced in Chapter 1. We said there that power
systems are either full power systems, which manage electric power by generating it
and supplying it to loads, or partial power systems that need energy in-feed from an
external electricity source and/or send the electricity produced to an external grid.

A full power systemcanbeas bigas a continent, such as Europe or NorthAmerica; in
this case it constitutes the general reference for electricity of that region and is called the
Power System (with uppercase initials), for example, the European Power System. A
full power system can also be much smaller. Examples of small full power systems are:
• the electric system of a ship or a car (which involves the generation, distribution
and utilization of energy);
• the electric system of a hospital which, in the event of a mains failure,
disconnects from the external grid and obtains its electricity from a diesel
generator;
• a toy or an electric torch, which are even smaller examples.
In Parts I and II of this book, we bridged the gap between electromagnetics and
circuits. Circuits, as we have noted several times, are mathematical/graphical models
that very effectively model many physical systems (called “circuital systems”) and
can be analysed with fast and fairly simple tools.
In Part III, we presented some very important components of power systems—that
is, rotating and static converters, which are able to convert energy from one form to
another (from mechanical to electrical and vice versa) and between electrical forms
with different characteristics. We introduced these components both on their own and
combined in electric drives.
An electric drive is a partial power system, since it gets energy from a source and
manipulates it, ﬁrst by changing the characteristic of the electric energy, then by
converting it into mechanical form, and ﬁnally by using it for ﬁnal purposes. An
example of an electric drive as a partial power system was already provided in
Chapter 1 and is repeated here for convenience (Figure 13.1). In Figure 13.1 a fan is
operated by an electric drive (instead of the simple electric motor) to be able to operate
at variable speed.
Two examples in which variable-speed fans may be required are:
1. In a computer. Mother-board fans are usually capable of operating at up to several
thousand rpms (e.g., 5000 rpm), but this is required in a worst-case scenario when the
room is hot and the computer is heavily loaded. In most cases, much lower speeds, even
as low as 1000 rpm, are acceptable, thus dramatically reducing both fan noise and power
consumption. The best PC manufacturers install variable speed drives for CPU (Central
Processing Unit) fans, thus lowering noise and power consumption considerably.

LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

2. In vehicle-testing laboratories, where cars are put on rollers. When the car is asked to
rotate its wheels, the rollers rotate and the torque on the rollers simulates the real-life
torque generated on wheels by the wheel-road contact. In these labs, vehicles are tested
at variable speeds (they are actually still, but their wheels rotate at variable speeds).
Under these conditions, the evaluation of vehicle performance must take realistic
cooling into account. Since in real life vehicles move against air, in these labs variable
speed fans must be provided to produce an air ﬂux against the car that has the same speed
as the air hitting the vehicle when it is on the road, taking actual wheel speed into
account.
Other very important examples of partial power systems are the electric installa-
tions. They are deﬁned and dealt with in the following section.
13.2
ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS: A BASIC INTRODUCTION
Electrical installations are power systems aimed at ﬁnal electricity consumption—
that is, in homes, ofﬁces, and small companies. In electrical installation, electricity is
generally taken from the public distribution network.
Recently the concept of electrical installation has slightly evolved, since the possibility
of partial electricity generation inside electrical installations today is not uncommon.
Indeed, today small companies or individual users can have in-house small photovoltaic
electricity generators, whose energy adds up to that taken from the mains.
In small electrical installations such as those of homes or ofﬁces, the public
distribution
network
delivers
energy
at
a
low-voltage
level
(LV).
Larger
installations—for example, for large companies or industries—may receive power
at the medium voltage level or even at the high voltage level, but their analysis is far
beyond the scope of this book. An example is shown in Figure 13.2, by means of an
uniﬁlar representation (compare with Figure 6.6).
Downstream of the point of connection (the so-called “point of common coupling”
or PCC) with the public distribution network, a meter measures the energy consumed
by the installation—that is, by the sum of all individual loads.
The energy (and power) entering the installation is conveyed, by means of a
distribution board, to different sections of it. In a home, for instance, one section might
be the kitchen, which is normally full of electrical appliances, and the other two or
three could feed other zones of the home.
Normally it is a good rule to use an installation section for every home zone, so that
when the circuit breaker situated at the beginning of a section is open (i.e., no current
or voltage can be transferred downstream) the whole home zone is free of electricity
hazards, while the other zones continue to function normally.
Each installation section has several potential loads, such as plugs (for sockets
connection), lamps, or other loads. Except for sockets loads, these can be connected or
disconnected from the main feeding line of the section through connection/dis-
connection switches (“sw” in the ﬁgure).
ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS: A BASIC INTRODUCTION
413

The different sections of the installation are fed though circuit breakers (b1 to bn in
Figure 13.2), which are able to interrupt currents either manually, because the
installation user wants to disconnect electricity from a home zone, for instance, or
automatically. An example of automatic operation is when the electricity supply must
be interrupted because of a short-circuit to avoid damage to things or living bodies.
Focus on: Terminology
What we call section is instead called circuit in technical literature. It is very
important to realize that in the electrical installation ﬁeld of electrical engineering
the word “circuit” has a totally different meaning from the way this word is used in
Part II of this book and in all circuit theory books and scientiﬁc literature. This is
why, since readers are not required to be electricity experts, a different word,—that
is, installation section,—has been used to facilitate understanding.
The distribution scheme illustrated in Figure 13.2, which is typical for homes and
small ofﬁces, is called “radial,” since there is a central point (the distribution panel) from
which different sections come and from which the distribution lines radiate outwards.
For more complex situations a multilevel radial scheme may be used, as illustrated
in Figure 13.3. In this case, there are several distribution boards with two (or maybe
more) levels of importance, representing a more hierarchical structure of the
installation: a Main Distribution Board (MDB) and some Secondary Distribution
Boards (SDB1 to SDBn). Also this case, the size of the area to be covered means that
individual zones have to be grouped into larger installation areas, so as to reduce the
number of lines from individual zones toward the main distribution board.

LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

When a secondary distribution board breaker such ad sb1.1 opens, it interrupts
electricity supply only to Section 1.1, while if a main breaker such as mb2 opens,
supply to a larger installation area is interrupted. Therefore, whenever possible,
only the breakers immediately upstream of the fault must open. Breakers such as
mb1 and mb2 are needed to protect the system in case of faults along the line
connecting the main (or primary) to a secondary distribution board. If, for
instance, the short circuit ss1 occurs, it is mandatory for mb1 to open, since
the action of the downstream breakers sb11 to sbn1 will not interrupt the supply to
the short circuit.
The purpose of these circuit breakers is to interrupt supply in three cases:
a. whenever a fault can cause a short circuit, which in turn can damage equipment
and indirectly incur safety risks (because the short-circuit current is very large
and causes cables to overheat which in turn might cause ﬁre);
b. whenever damage to the insulation of cables could cause voltage to be applied
to outside parts of electrical appliances that may be touched by humans or
livestock, thus creating a high risk of injury or even death;
c. when the user wants to eliminate the supply of parts of the installation, to allow
maintenance for example.
These three functions are commonly (but not mandatorily) combined into single
devices, such as the circuit breakers shown in Figure 13.3.

ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS: A BASIC INTRODUCTION
415

The number of levels of distribution boards can be greater than two. For instance, a
multiple-storey house, containing a single family, might have three-level architecture:
• a main distribution board, located on the ground ﬂoor, immediately after the
point of supply for the public distribution network;
• ﬂoor subdistribution boards on each ﬂoor;
• possibly some ﬁnal distribution boards in different zones of the most loaded
ﬂoors.
The examples shown in Figures 13.2 and 13.3 refer to smaller, single-phase
installations, in which the conductors of each line connecting switchboards to loads
are constituted by two wires. Only for more complex installations, especially in
Europe, connection with the public distribution network is three-phase, and at least
some of the lines connecting switchboards to loads are three-phase. An example of
three-phase installation is shown in Figure 13.4. In this example the lines up to
Secondary Distribution Boards SDB1 and SDB2 are three-phase four-wire, while the
lines going out from these boards are single phase (phase-to-neutral supply). These
lines are designed in such a way that the load is as uniform as possible between phases
r, s, t. Thus, the three-phase lines are as uniformly loaded as possible, and the three-
phase system as balanced as possible (remember that only balanced three-phase
systems were examined in Chapter 6).
This can be achieved, for instance, when several phase-to-neutral lines are fed by
MDB, connecting them from to line-neutral pairs: one can be r, n, another s, n, and
another t, n.
More information about the way users’ installations are connected to the public
distribution network will be provided in Chapter 15.

LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

More in Depth: Series and shunt distribution
In the previous section, even if not explicitly stated, it was taken for granted that
the best way of distributing electricity to loads is by the so-called shunt connection.
However, this was not the case at the beginning of electriﬁcation, in the two ﬁrst
decades of the twentieth century, when a lot of discussion took place on this.
Therefore, to satisfy the reader’s curiosity, here are some comments about shunt
and series connection.
In principle, a distribution system aims to deliver the electricity produced by a
generator, which is usually very large, to a considerable number of users ( loads),
each one usually very small. The autonomy of each load must be ensured, so that
each device can modify its power request without changing the operating
conditions of the others. Basically, the connection between a generator and a
set of users can be carried out in two ways, illustrated in Figure 13.5. In the ﬁrst
case, loads are shunt-connected, and in the second they are series-connected.
In order to allow each user to change his or her own consumption—or even to be
connected or disconnected without disturbing others—the generator must be
regulated in such a way as to keep constant the common voltage in the ﬁrst
case and keep constant the common current in the second.
In a distribution system operated at constant voltage, each user is connected to the
power line by a switch, which guarantees independence from the other loads. As the
number of users grows, the voltage is kept constant, while the current provided by
the generator increases. A short-circuit between the conductors of the power line
causes a severe malfunction called “fault”, because the regulating system, which is
aimed at keeping the voltage constant, gives rise to a dangerous overcurrent.

ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS: A BASIC INTRODUCTION
417

Conversely, an interruption of the circuit has rather less severe consequences, since
it simply shuts off the supply to downstream users, who are put “out of service”.
In the series distribution system, each user is rigidly connected to the power line
and is excluded from the service through a bypass switch; the higher the number of
users fed at a constant current, the higher the voltage required at the generator
terminals. In this case, a short circuit in the power line is not a fault, rather a
disservice, because only downstream users are unsupplied. An interruption of the
circuit is, instead, a proper fault: the current vanishes but the generator tends to
keep it constant; thus very high voltages are generated and distributed to all users
located upstream of the interruption.
The shunt distribution system has prevailed since the beginning of electriﬁcation,
for many reasons. Among them is the possibility of connecting and disconnecting
small devices with independent plug–socket couplings without requiring any other
action in the system; in the series system, instead, the bypass switch must always
be manoeuvred before connecting or disconnecting the user. The main advantage
of the shunt distribution system derives from the fact that it maintains the voltage at
a constant value everywhere, so that it is not dangerous for humans, regardless of
the extension of the system and the presence of faults. It is known, in fact, that a
voltage exceeding a few hundred volts is unsafe for residential use and small
industrial applications—that is, in environments where no special precautions are
adopted and no specialized personnel are employed.
For these reasons, electricity distribution systems, except in rare, special cases, were
developed according to the shunt connection of loads, operated at constant voltage.
Looking at Figures 13.2 and 13.3, it can be seen that basically electrical installations
are composed of lines, loads, and distribution boards (with their circuit breakers).
However, itisnotenoughtodescribeaninstallationjust bytheindividualobjectsand
the functions they perform. A good electrical installation also needs to have all its parts
operating together, in order to perform the function they are designed for—that is,
supplying its loads safely and reliably.
Therefore, in the remainder of this chapter, following a description of the individual
objects, we will look at some details of the function of overcurrent protection, which
means that we will look simultaneously at electricity source, distribution lines, and
protection devices.
Another very important protection issue for humans and livestock, the so-called
protection against contacts, is dealt with in the next chapter.
13.3
LOADS
Loads of a low-voltage installation are small devices that absorb power. More
precisely, in general they absorb active and reactive powers (P and Q: see Chapter 5).
418
LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

Active power absorption means that some power drawn from the installation
(coming from the public electricity distribution grid) is converted inside the load into
some other form of energy, normally heat.
Heat is directly produced in heaters and ovens. It is indirectly produced in other cases.
Consider a fan, for example. In this case electricity is ﬁrst converted (after some power
loss) into kinetic energy of air, but when air movement stops, this kinetic energy has been
converted into heat.
The absorption of reactive power is related to the fast oscillation of instantaneous
power around a null average (again, see Chapter 5), which occurs when inductors or
capacitors are involved. The amplitude of these oscillations, with the addition of the
appropriate sign, is what is called reactive power Q. By convention, positive reactive
power is absorbed by inductors and generated by capacitors.
Examples of loads of a home installation are heaters (and ovens), fans, electronic
appliances such as TV sets and PCs, and subsystems containing several elementary
loads, such as dishwashers containing heaters and motors.
It is common practice to consider home loads as modelled by equivalent imped-
ances, based on the absorption of P and Q. Consider Figure 13.6: the voltage U is
shown without a polarity reference, because U is only the rms value and is a positive
number without the need of a reference. This representation simply says that the rms
value of the AC voltage between the two conductors of the line is equal to U. From

Equations (°) and (°°) give the amplitude and angle of the complex impedance
Z  Zejφ as a function of line voltage and absorbed active and reactive power.
Therefore, they allow our loads to be modelled as impedances.
Electric appliances normally bear a nameplate containing useful information
such as
• nominal voltage Un,
• nominal frequency fn,
• nominal absorbed power Pn, and
• nominal current In (optional).
Nominal values, frequently referred to as rated, are those for which the appliance is
designed. For the appliance to perform correctly, actual values should not differ too
widely from these nominal values.
In particular, the actual (rms) voltage to which the load is connected must not differ
from Un by more than ±10%.
As far as frequency tolerance is concerned, loads not containing electric motors are
highly tolerant of frequency variations. Thus frequency is really not a concern since in
most countries it is kept under strict control to ensure the correct operation of the
power system (some details in Chapter 15).
In the previous list, nominal power Pn and current In are absorbed by the load when
it is fed by a source having as voltage the nominal voltage.1
From the nameplate data, it is easy to compute Qn (the reactive power absorbed
when the load itself is fed from a source with voltage Un) and Z n, the impedance
equivalent to the load, which constitutes a valid model of this load:

It is apparent that the equivalent impedance correctly models the load only when the
voltage at its terminals is exactly equal to the nominal value Un. As an approximation
it can, however, be assumed that the computed equivalent impedance in nominal
conditions Z n stays sufﬁciently valid also when voltage is not exactly equal to Un, but
it is very near to it.
1And as frequency the nominal frequency, although this parameter, as mentioned above, is normally not
critical.

More in Depth: Load modelling
Modelling loads as impedances is common practice in electric power engineer-
ing, when loads are fed at voltages close to the nominal values (a common
situation), and the values of P and Q are required, rather than their variation with
voltage U.
If the variation of P and Q is to be evaluated as a function of voltage, the
impedance model is often not adequate. In fact for an impedance it is
P  U2
Z cosφ  U2;
Q  U2
Z sinφ  U2
since cosφ does not usually
vary with voltage
This quadratic dependence of P and Q on voltage is not the only possibility.
Consider, for instance (here k means a quantity that remains constant when U
varies):
1. Asynchronous motors. When the voltage is modiﬁed, the motor speed
remains substantially constant and therefore also the steady-state load torque,
which depends on this speed, is constant. Therefore P  k; moreover, it can be
seen that Q  k U2.
2. Electronic converters feeding their loads (e.g., controlled rectiﬁers). These
converters are normally feedback-regulated so as to supply their loads at the
set power. Therefore it is: P  k, Q  k.
When aggregate loads are involved (for instance, the whole load of a home or a
building), their behaviour as a whole is a weighted average of the behaviour of its
individual components.

13.4
CABLES
In electrical installations the lines that connect switchboards to loads or sockets are
constituted by cables, which have a structure very different from that of overhead
lines, pictures of which are shown at the very beginning of Chapter 6.
Cables are composed of conductors and their insulation, as shown in Figures 13.2
and 13.3. They can contain one or more conductors, usually three, which are adequate
for three-phase systems. They are shaped like wires. From their cross section, shown
in Figure 13.7, it can be seen that the conductor is a cylinder (whose length is greater
than its diameter) which carries current; the conductor is covered with an external
layer that insulates it from the outside; a three- or multiple-conductor cable needs
additional ﬁlling material and protective covering.
13.4.1
Maximum Permissible Current and Choice of the
Cross-Sectional Area
When current ﬂows through a cable, it generates heat according to Joule’s law. In fact,
the cable has its own resistance R, and resistance per unit length Rl, and therefore the
heat produced per unit of time and length is
Pj  RlI2
(13.1)
If current is in ampere and resistance in ohm/metre, Pj is in W/m or J/(m ? s).
Consider a cable initially without current, in thermal equilibrium with its environ-
ment: it will have the same temperature as the air (or other substance) surrounding it.
When current starts to ﬂow, let it, for simplicity’s sake, be constant: heat is
generated according to equation (13.1). This partly heats the cable and partly is
dispersed to the outside.
To consolidate this idea, consider a free-standing cable surrounded only by air.
Thermal analysis can be carried out according to the sketch shown in the left-hand part
of Figure 13.8, in which Rθl1 and Rθl2 represent the thermal resistances, per unit
length, between conductor and air: Rθl1, in particular, represents the resistance due to

the insulation, and Rθl2 is related to the convection phenomenon of air around the
cable.
If the reader is not familiar with conduction and convection, it is sufﬁcient to know that
the thermal power (joule per second) that ﬂows through a thermal resistance is
proportional to the temperature difference at its two ends. For instance, for the insulator
it is Pθf  (θc  θ1)*Rθl1, Pθf being the heat ﬂowing in J/s. The two thermal resistances
can be combined as a series, exactly like electrical resistances, and therefore it can also be
written that Pθf  Rθleq(θc  θa), with Rθleq  Rθl1  Rθl2.
The behaviour of conductor temperatures over time can be obtained by solving the
following simple differential equation which equates the heat produced, per unit
length, to the sum of that absorbed by the conductor heat capacitance and that
dispersed in the environment:
Pjl  Cθl
dθc
dt  θc  θa=Rθleq
(13.2)
where Cθl is the thermal capacity (also known as heat capacity) of the conductor, per
unit length. To ﬁnd the solution of equation (13.2), it is easier if the following
auxiliary variable is deﬁned:
θ  θc  θa
Consequently, equation (13.2) can be rewritten as
Pjl  Cθl

or:
θ ∞ τ dθ

where θ∞ Pjl Rθleq and τ  Rθleq Cθl.

423

It is easy to verify that equation (°) is solved by
θ  θ ∞ θ ∞et=τ
The situation is described by the plot shown in the right-hand part of Figure 13.8.
Before the transient starts, the conductor has the same temperature as the
surrounding air; when the current, rms value, suddenly reaches I*, thus generating
constant thermal power per unit length Pjl, the temperature begins to change. At ﬁrst
the heat produced is almost entirely accumulated in the conductor heat capacity. If no
heat were dispersed in the environment through the thermal resistance Rθleq, the
conductor temperature θc(t) would continue along the straight line indicated as
“adiabatic behaviour” in Figure 13.8. In reality, as long as the conductor temperature
rises above θa, the heat dispersion in the environment increases; therefore, more and
more of the generated heat is transferred to the air surrounding the cable. The analysis
and design of the initial (adiabatic) behaviour and ﬁnal (steady-state) behaviour are of
interest in electrical installation.
An important part of the plot of the right-hand part of Figure 13.8 is the horizontal
straight line characterizing the steady-state thermal behaviour of the cable. It clearly
shows that the steady-state temperature of the cable depends on room temperature θa
and the product between the power dissipated in the cable per unit length and the
thermal resistance per unit length.
On the other hand, all cables can be subjected to their maximum operating
temperature for unlimited time.2 The maximum operating temperatures for the
most common types of insulation are shown in Table 13.1. The shown data are
those used in International standards.
The data on the table give the amount of heat that can be afforded for a given room

LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

Definition: Maximum permissible current (of an insulated conductor, of a cable) Iz
The maximum permissible current is the maximum value of current that an
insulated conductor or cable can carry indeﬁnitely without reducing its normal life
expectancy. It is normally indicated by the symbol Iz.
In some standards it is named current-carrying capacity.
For instance, at a room temperature of 30 °C, a PVC cable has a margin of over-
temperature of 40 °C that in turn will determine the maximum current the cable can
carry. If room temperature is 40 °C, the over-temperature margin will be reduced
to 30 °C.
In the case of free-standing conductors in air, equation (13.3) allows us to compute
the maximum continuous current for the cable Iz.
Indeed, for the sake of conciseness, the value of Rθleq was not developed in equation
(13.3). Readers who feel at ease with thermal computations can easily verify that it is
Rθleq  α ? s  k=2πrhk, where h is the heat transfer coefﬁcient (for convection) and k
and s are the thermal conductivity and thickness of the insulation layer, respectively.
Unfortunately, real-life situations are different from the free-standing reference,
mainly because:
• The cable is placed in conduits or on trays (see Figure 13.9).
• In the vicinity of the cable there are other loaded cables that contribute to
warming the surrounding air.
These two difﬁculties make computation more involved, and it is preferable to ﬁnd
the actual values on tables that are available also in International standards (as IEC
60364-5-52).
By way of some simple examples, Table 13.2 shows the values of Iz in two
common situations. It is apparent that the higher the number of loaded cables, the

lower the current capability (each cable warms the air surrounding the others).
Moreover, installation in an insulated wall is a poorer means of dispersing heat than a
conduit on a wooden wall.
It is fairly easy to ﬁnd current-carrying capabilities at room temperatures which are
different from the one to which a current-carrying capability table such as Table 13.2
refers.
Consider again the formula (13.3):

If Iz1 is at room temperature θa1 and Iz2 at θa2, it is

tables), Iz*. The Iz at the generic temperature is then

All cables of an installation must be designed to carry currents that are below their
maximum permissible current.
Therefore the electrician or installation designer must ﬁnd an estimate of the
maximum current the cable is called to carry for long periods of time during the

permissible currents must be coordinated with IB, according to the following
simple rule:
IB £ Iz
(13.4)
Moreover, some means must be provided to guarantee that currents much larger
than Iz cannot ﬂow through the cable, except for limited times. This is a topic called
overload protection and will be dealt with in Section 13.6.
13.5
DETERMINING VOLTAGE DROP
A cable line between a source and a load can be modelled using the metacircuit
introduced in Chapter 5, as shown in Figure 13.10. The resistance Rl contains the sum
of the resistance of the upper and lower conductors of the line. The inductance L1
models the effects of self-induction in the rectangular surface of the transmission line,
bound by the conductors and source and load.
When dealing with electrical installations, it is often necessary to evaluate the so-
called scalar voltage drop (or simply voltage drop)

that is, the difference in the rms values of the voltages one can measure near the source
and near the load.3
A formula which gives a sufﬁciently close approximation of this scalar voltage
drop can be easily found by referring to the phasor diagram of the circuit shown in
Figure 13.11. Here, to ease analysis, think the phasors as having as amplitude the rms
values of the corresponding sine waves.
Instead of evaluating the difference in the moduli of U s and U u, we compute, as an
approximation, the difference between the projection of U s on the direction of U u and

In low-voltage installations, except for cases of cables with cross-sectional areas
greater than 95 mm2, it easy to verify (by consulting the cable manufacturer’s
documentation) that it is Rl  Xl; and therefore

In large installations, much larger cross-sectional areas are used, and in these cases the
full formula is adopted (13.5).
Example 2. A two-wire copper, PVC-insulated cable must be installed in a conduit
on a wooden wall and must supply a 2-kW 500-var single-phase load at a distance of
30 m from a 120-V AC source. Determine the cross-sectional area of the cable,
considering a maximum voltage drop of 4%.

From Table 13.2 it can be seen that a cross-sectional area A  1.5 mm2 is adequate for
this purpose (it will imply Iz  17.5 A) from a thermal point of view. However, the
voltage-drop criterion must also be satisﬁed. Since it is apparent that A will be much
smaller than 95 mm2, formula (13.6) can be used. So

Using this conductor it will be Iz  32 A  IB and ΔU < 4%.
13.6
OVERCURRENTS AND OVERCURRENT PROTECTION
Any current exceeding the maximum permissible current is called an overcurrent.
Measures are taken to protect electrical cables from the effects of overcurrents, that is,
currents exceeding Iz. In practical installations two scenarios of overcurrents can
occur:
• Overcurrents can occur in an electrically undamaged circuit, caused by excess
load on a cable, for instance, when all the sockets in a room are loaded with
heavy loads. In this case the current exceeds Iz by a limited amount and is called
overload current or simply overload; overloads can be left on the system for a
signiﬁcant time without signiﬁcant cable insulation damage.
• The overcurrent is caused by a “short circuit”. A short circuit is a fault in which
two conductors, intended as having different potentials in normal service, come
into contact with each other. This can happen, for instance, when the cord
connecting an iron to its plug is damaged and the two live conductors touch each
other. In these cases the current ﬂowing in the cable is much greater than Iz, and
must be eliminated as fast as possible. Such currents are called short-circuit
currents.
Overload and short-circuit currents must be dealt with in different ways, and this will
be discussed in the next two sections; however, it is very common to combine
protection against overcurrents and short-circuit currents in single devices—that is,
the commonly used circuit breakers, which will be discussed in Section 13.6.3.
13.6.1
Overloads
Overloads having a small entity and time are tolerated in electrical installations. To
facilitate the determination of protection, overloads are dealt with, by international
agreement, in a conventional way: overloads up to 45% can persist, while overloads
over 45% must be eliminated within a conventional tripping time (i.e., one or two
hours depending on various factors, including local standards).
OVERCURRENTS AND OVERCURRENT PROTECTION
429

This is summarized by the following formula4:
I2 £ 1:45Iz
(13.7)
This condition will be discussed again in Section 13.6.3.
where I2 is the current that is certainly interrupted within the conventional tripping
time.
All the breakers shown in Figures 13.2 and 13.3 must have the ability to protect the
cables they feed from overload. For instance, mb1 will protect the cable between mb1
and SDB1, while sb11 will protect the cable feeding section 1.1.
13.6.2
Short Circuits
Short-circuit currents must be interrupted as fast as possible. What does “as fast as
possible” mean in quantitative terms?
The immediate effect of very large currents ﬂowing during a short circuit is that the
conductor and its insulating material heat up considerably. We must ensure that the
temporary high temperature reached by the conductor does not damage the insulator
excessively.
This is obtained using the following formula:
I2ti < k2A2
(13.8)
where:
• I is the rms value of the short-circuit current
• ti is the time needed by the circuit breaker to interrupt the short-circuit current
• A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor in mm2
• k is a function of the material of the conductor and insulation material and can be
read from Table 13.3.
The maximum tolerable temperature in short-circuit conditions are those shown in
Table 13.3, thus completing the information shown in Table 13.1, which show only
temperatures θc that can persist continuously over time. In the following the subscript
“i” of t will often be dropped.

The reader might wonder where (13.8) comes from.
Consider the transient shown in Figure 13.8. Short circuits must be interrupted
very fast. Therefore, in the thermal transient shown in the right part of the ﬁgure,
the part to be taken into account is that immediately after the onset of current I*, for
a shorter duration than the thermal time constant τ. This means that the short circuit
can be analysed under the assumption that the thermal transient is substantially
adiabatic.

13.6.3
Breaker Characteristics and Protection Against Overcurrents
There are different kinds of switching devices in electrical installations. The main
symbols and names are shown in Table 13.4. The corresponding switches are:
• Disconnector (or Isolator). This has the purpose of isolating part of an
installation from another, so that when they are open it is guaranteed that
the voltage and current cannot be transferred between the two parts. If, for
instance, in the drawing of Figure 13.2 switch b1 (which combines the functions
of a disconnector and a circuit breaker) is open, personnel can operate safely on
section 1 of the installation.
• Load-Break Switch. These are switches normally used in houses—for instance,
to switch a lamp on and off. They are capable of opening the normal load current
and are manually operated. They do not provide automatic protection of the
circuit they control.
• Circuit Breaker. These are capable of tripping (i.e., switching from on to off
position) automatically, when the current exceeds given thresholds. They are
capable of cutting short-circuit currents. Circuit breakers are always capable of
performing the functions of load-break switches. Although not always guar-
anteed, they usually also have the functions of a disconnector.
Circuit breakers have signiﬁcant parameters that must be deﬁned and understood,
before we go on to explore how they must be chosen to guarantee adequate protection:
Definitions: Characteristic circuit-breaker parameters
• Nominal Current In. This is the reference current that breaker characteristics
refer to. A breaker can be called to carry In indeﬁnitely, without any damage to
the breaker and without tripping.
• Regulated Current Ir. In some breakers it is possible to set the overload
tripping threshold to a value lower than In, in order to comply with different
installation conditions. This set value is the regulated current Ir, which can be
carried indeﬁnitely without tripping.

432
LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

• Conventional Overload Trip Current I2. This is the current that certainly
causes the breaker to trip within a conventional tripping time t2. Time t2 may be
1 hour or 2 hours according to local standards.
• Breaking Capacity. This is the maximum current the breaker is capable of
breaking (under given conditions).
Since any breaker can be called to carry In (or Ir) indeﬁnitely, the following
prescription must be set:
Rule: Coordination of IB and breaker nominal or regulated current
IB £ In
or IB £ Ir for breakers that have Ir instead of In
For a breaker to be able to protect a cable against overcurrents, the overload
protection rule (13.7) must also be veriﬁed. However, standards require that circuit
breakers comply with the following correspondence between In (or Ir) and I2:
I2 £ 1:45In
or I2 £ 1:45Ir
Therefore the condition (13.7) is veriﬁed simply by using the following rule:
Rule: Circuit breaker overload protection condition
When a cable is protected from overload by a circuit breaker, it must be
In £ Iz
or Ir £ Iz for breakers that have Ir instead of In
Overload protection can be ensured also by other devices called fuses. For them the
general rule (13.7) still applies, but IB  In  Iz will no longer be sufﬁcient, since for fuses
I2 > 1:45In. However, this is beyond the scope of this book.
Before issuing the third rule—that is, the short-circuit protection rule—we ﬁrst
consider how circuit breakers trip.
Circuit breakers normally have delayed-instantaneous (or thermal-magnetic)
tripping curves. An example is shown in Figure 13.12a. Note the two curves, related
to minimum and maximum tripping time, respectively. Indeed, the breaker is not able
to guarantee a single time value for which a current can persist before tripping, but
OVERCURRENTS AND OVERCURRENT PROTECTION
433

only a range. Similarly, for a given time, an interval of currents that cause tripping in
that time is given.
For instance, the minimum and maximum currents I1 and I2 are determined according to
the conventional overload tripping time which, as we already said, is one or two hours,
depending on national standards.
There is a zone (i.e., for currents below Im1) for which the time to open the circuit
is dependent on current: the larger the current, the shorter the time. This is normally
achieved by sensors based on thermal effects. Since they require some time to heat
up, they have a natural tendency to operate with times that depend on the value of
the current. In another zone of the protective scheme—that is, for currents above
Im2—the intervention (tripping) is as fast as possible, and tripping time is quasi-
independent of the amount of current ﬂowing through the breaker. The zone above
Im2 is called range of instantaneous tripping, since no intentional time delay has
been added.
It is natural to combine the breaker and cable characteristics in such a way that the
thermal part protects against overloads, thus avoiding tripping for only temporary
overcurrents, while the instantaneous (magnetic) part operates against short circuits,
since they require tripping which is as fast as possible.
The transition zone between the two regions of the curves is very important: low
values of Im guarantee better cable protection, but could more easily cause unwanted
tripping for temporary overloads. The opposite occurs for large values of Im.
By international convention, the breakers are classiﬁed according to where
the transition zone lies between time-delayed and instantaneous tripping: this

classiﬁcation5 is shown in Table 13.5. For each type, both Im1 and Im2 must be within
the indicated range.
To ensure that a cable is well protected against short circuits, equation (13.8) must
be satisﬁed:
Rule: Short-circuit protection condition for circuit breaker
When a cable is protected from short circuit by a circuit breaker, equation (13.8)
must be satisﬁed; that is, the I2t allowed by the breaker to ﬂow through the cable
during tripping time ti must not exceed the maximum permissible cable I2t.
This can be graphically shown as indicated in Figure 13.12b. In practice, cable and
breaker are correctly coordinated if all the possible short-circuit currents fall between
Ia and Ib; if a circuit breaker is protecting a line such as that shown in Figure 13.13,

OVERCURRENTS AND OVERCURRENT PROTECTION
435

short-circuit currents at the beginning and at the end of the line must be evaluated. The
farther a short-circuit current is from the power source, the smaller it is, so it will
always be Isc2 < Isc1. Therefore, the electrician will verify that: Isc2 > Ia and Isc1 < Ib. If
one of these cannot be veriﬁed, either the cable or the breaker must be changed so that
both can be veriﬁed.
To summarize, a circuit breaker must protect a cable both against overload and
short-circuit currents.
Overload protection is obtained by:
• First estimating the maximum design cable current IB
• Choosing a cable which, in the given installation conditions, is such that IB < Iz
• Choosing a breaker which is such that IB £ In £ Iz
In addition to overload, short-circuit protection is achieved by obtaining the let-
through energy of cb and the cable and then verifying this (see again Figure 13.13):
• Isc2 > Ia
• Isc1 < Ib

be modelled as a Thévenin equivalent, having as impedance a pure reactance

Finally, the computed values of Isc1, Isc2, and cable I2t will have to be compared to
the breaker I2t in the manufacturer’s documents.
In the large majority of cases (like this example), conditions IB  In  Iz will
automatically single out a breaker that satisﬁes the short-circuit condition.
If this does not happen, a breaker with lower I2t or a cable with a larger cross-
sectional area A (and therefore larger I2t) will have to be chosen.
Circuit-breaker manufacturers supply I2t characteristics of their circuit breakers
that facilitate the graphical veriﬁcation of short-circuit conditions.

PROTECTION IN INSTALLATIONS: A LONG LIST
In Section 13.6, only thermal effects were taken into account in the coordination of
circuit breakers and cables.
Electrical installations are very useful in our lives, but they must be well designed
to be safe. This involves much more that protection against overcurrent. Just to give an
idea, consider that International Standards6 require the following kinds of protection:
• Protection against electric shock
• Protection against thermal effects
• Protection against overcurrents (overloads and short circuits)
• Protection against voltage disturbances and measures against electromagnetic
inﬂuences
• Protection against power supply interruption
The aim of this book is not to train readers to become designers of electrical
installations. However, it is important to understand how designers operate, in order to
understand the results of what they do and to be able to communicate in a technically
effective way with them if necessary.
Because of its great importance, protection against electric shock is the topic of the
next chapter.

ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE
MEASURES
For the Instructor
The topic of safety has an important place in a book on Electric Power Engineering
Basics. We believe that any engineer with some knowledge of electricity should
also have some basic knowledge of (a) the dangers associated with its use and
(b) the main measures adopted by designers to minimize these risks.
The aim of this chapter is not to teach students to design a safe electric system, but
rather to build their awareness of the potential risks of electricity and to help them
understand the purpose behind the measures they see in existing installations.
This will also be useful to avoid practices that could lead to potential risks.
14.1
INTRODUCTION
This is a very special chapter. Design safety does not just involve technical knowledge
and analysis, but also entails the designer’s personal responsibility.
This is why the procedures for designing the safety aspects in any kind of
engineering system are carefully deﬁned in International Standards, thereby reducing
individual discretion as much as possible. International Standards will thus be referred
to frequently in this chapter.

Safety also involves complying with laws, which may vary according to the
country and state in which the electrical installation is built and operates. An
international book like this one can only provide some basic knowledge relating
to international agreements on electricity safety. Engineers in charge of the actual
designs must refer to national standards and law.
In this chapter, time-varying shapes are not used. All currents or voltages are
represented by uppercase letters such as U or I. These symbols, as always in this
book, indicate constant values when in DC and indicate rms values of sinusoids
when in AC.

ELECTRICITY AND THE HUMAN BODY
14.2.1
Effects of Current on Human Beings
Current ﬂowing in the body of a human being may have several types of effect, some
of them harmful or even deadly. The greater the current or the exposition time, the
more serious the effects. Frequency is also an important factor: the greatest dangers
are caused by currents in the 15 to 100-Hz range, which includes the most commonly
used frequencies of power systems all over the world, that is, 50 and 60 Hz.
DC currents are also dangerous, but in general they are signiﬁcantly less dangerous
than AC currents, when equal current (comparing DC current with rms AC) and
exposition time are considered.
The following are the main effects of currents ﬂowing through a human body.
They are listed in increasing order of gravity, consequently also in order of intensity
and/or duration of the current.
Involuntary Muscular Contraction. This is not harmful in itself if the current is
kept under control (it is even used in gyms for stimulating muscular exercise).
However, since it prevents voluntary muscle action, the victim may not be able
to let go of the live part, so that the current continues to ﬂow in the body, causing
greater harm.
Respiratory Difﬁculties. Depending on its intensity, duration, and path, current
ﬂowing in the body can cause the involuntary contraction of respiratory
muscles, as well as damage to (a) the neural activation pathways for these
muscles and (b) the respiratory control mechanism in the brain. This respiratory
block may prevent the victim from shouting for help. Normally, breathing
difﬁculties disappear when the cause (i.e., the current) is removed; it may
happen, however, that there is still some need for artiﬁcial respiration. If the
respiratory block persists—for example, because the current is not inter-
rupted—death will follow.
Ventricular Fibrillation. If a substantial part of the current entering the body
traverses the heart, this current dominates over the physiological electrical
impulses that coordinate the heart, causing ventricular ﬁbrillation. This is a
chaotic state in which the heart’s ﬁbres oscillate rapidly, preventing it from
440
ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES

pumping blood. When ventricular ﬁbrillation has started, it does not disappear
naturally. Only fast medical treatment, usually with a deﬁbrillator, can prevent
sudden death.
From studies of the effects of current on animals, corpses, and other sources of
information, a plot has been deﬁned and internationally agreed upon. This contains
the regions in which the various effects are more likely to occur. A simpliﬁed version
of it is shown in Figure 14.1: the standard also deﬁnes a curve a and curves c2 and c3,
not shown here for the sake of simplicity.
Naturally the zones have only statistical signiﬁcance, since actual effects depend
on the subject’s age, sex, state of health, and so on.
The two curves in the plot deﬁne three zones with different levels of danger:
• AC-1. In this zone the current is perceived by the victim, but it is usually not
enough to startle him or her.
• AC-2. In this zone perception is clear; it is also possible that involuntary
muscular contractions occur, but usually there are no harmful effects.
• AC-3: This zone is characterized by extreme danger; the further away from
curve c1 (toward higher currents or longer duration), the likelier death becomes.
The reader might ﬁnd it useful to draw a few facts from these plots and to always
bear them in mind:
1. Currents below 5 mA can be considered entirely safe, regardless of the time
they ﬂow in the body.
2. Currents below 30 mA are fairly safe, since they are not likely to have very
dangerous effects, whatever the duration.

3. Currents above 500 mA are always very dangerous, regardless of the time they
ﬂow in the body.
4. Curve c1’s dependence on time is negligible over 5 s; a current lasting 5 s is just
as dangerous as one lasting much longer.
The zones deﬁned in Figure 14.1 refer to left-hand-to-feet current paths; however,
risks relating to other paths are also known and are obtained by the values shown in
Figure 14.1 by multiplication by correction factors. For example:
• Right-hand-to-feet paths are 20% less dangerous: the plots in Figure 14.1 are
thus often considered to be valid for any hand-to-feet (thus favouring safety);
this is important since hand-to-feet is by and large the most common current
path during accidents.
• A current ﬂowing from both hands to both feet is as dangerous as from the left
hand to both feet.
• A current ﬂowing from hand to hand is 2.5 times less severe than from left hand
to feet.
Example. A current of 225 mA, hand to hand, has the same likelihood of producing
ventricular ﬁbrillation as a current of 90 mA, left hand to both feet.
The plots shown in Figure 14.1, as mentioned, are valid for AC currents, at so-
called “industrial frequencies,” deﬁned for the plot as the range 15–100 Hz. It was
previously stated, however, that DC currents are less dangerous than AC ones, mainly
because they interfere much less with the physiological currents that normally ﬂow in
the body. The latter have an impulse shape and are therefore much more similar to AC
than DC. The danger limits of DC power systems are shown in Figure 14.2, which
thus complements Figure 14.1.

ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES

It is clear that DC currents are much less dangerous than AC ones for long
durations while for very short durations the limits are the same; this is apparent
considering that a current lasting 10 ms is seen by the body as a 10-ms impulse
regardless of whether the electric system is DC or AC.
As we have seen, the dangers of electricity are related to the current ﬂowing in the
body, but it is more useful, for electrical installation design purposes, to derive from
these curves other ones taking into account, instead of the current ﬂowing in the body,
the voltage between the conductive parts that can be touched by people and the
ground. In other words, it would be useful to be able to express safety limits in terms
of voltage-time couples instead of current–time couples.
To do so, an electrical model of the ground and of the human body is necessary, as
shown in the next two sections.
14.2.2
The Mechanism of Current Dispersion in the Earth
When someone touches with a hand a part that has a potential different from that of the
ﬂoor, and has his feet on the ﬂoor itself, he is traversed by a current (from hand to feet
and vice versa) that depends on the voltage, the body, and the characteristics of the
ground. The earth’s behaviour is very important: clearly, for instance, no current ﬂows
in a ﬂoor made of perfectly insulating material, while in the case of wet earth in a
garden, the current could be deadly.
In order to understand the earth’s behaviour when traversed by a current, consider
the system represented in Figure 14.3. The horizontal line represents the soil surface,
that is, the ground.
In the ground are two ﬁxed electrodes A, and C, which can be imagined as being
vertical cylinders of about 1 metre in length. An additional electrode B can also be
inserted into the earth at a distance x from A which can be anything from 0 to the
distance between A and C. A voltmeter connects the wires connected with A and C.

ELECTRICITY AND THE HUMAN BODY
443

In the lower of the Figure 14.3 is a possible plot of the voltage U(x) measured by
voltmeter V.
The whole system can thus be imagined to be split into three zones:
• zone 1, around A, in which the voltage initially rises fast, then gradually reduces
its slope;
• central zone 2, in which the voltage can be assumed to be stable;
• zone 3, around C, in which the voltage increases, with increasing slope, up to the
voltage UAB.
Furthermore, note that the voltage plot U(x) is proportional to the current I
circulating through the electrodes. Therefore, the earth below our feet has linear
relation to current, although it is a distributed-parameter system. Therefore Ohm’s law
applies to it, and it can be effectively modelled by lumped resistors, choosing three
important points: the two connections to electrodes A and B, and the intermediate
point between the two in which the voltage is most stable.
In Figure 14.4, note the earth symbol (
) used to represent the intermediate point
with stable voltage.
The resistances RTA and RTB are the earth resistances of earth electrodes A and B.
Their actual values depend on soil resistivity and electrode shape and size. In
particular, they are proportional to soil resistivity; they decrease, if shape is not
modiﬁed, when the electrode size increases.
The actual computation of earth resistance might be complicated in the case of
complex shapes; however, for the simple case of a linear vertical element inserted by a
length l into soil with resistivity ρe, the following approximated formula can be used:
Rr  ρe=l
Unfortunately, soil resistivity varies dramatically with soil type. Values of 25–
100 Ωm are typical for vegetal earth while it can reach 1000–5000 Ωm in rocks.
It will soon be seen that smaller earth resistances enhance safety; therefore, it is much
more difﬁcult (requiring much larger electrodes) to make good earth electrodes in
rocky ground than in ordinary soil.
14.2.3
A Circuital Model for the Human Body
In order to prevent electric shock, it is essential to correctly evaluate the behaviour of
the human body when it is traversed by a current. Many studies have been carried out,
mainly based on corpses and on animals.

ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES

One of the basic results is that the human body normally behaves algebraically.
This means that if the body is seen from two points P and Q (e.g., the two hands), its
constitutive equation is an algebraic equation, without derivatives or integrals:
UPQ  f IPQ
(14.1)
Equation (14.1) does not satisfy Ohm’s law
U  RI
since the ratio U/I is not constant.
There are cases in which an algebraic model of the body is not sufﬁcient, and a model
also containing capacitors must be used; these are, however, beyond the scope of this
book; for details see [1].
Even though the nonlinear nature of function f in (14.1) indicates that Ohm’s law
cannot be used, the fact that it is algebraic suggests that it can be described as a
“resistance variable with the voltage applied”:
UPQ  RUPQIPQ
This can always be done when algebraic equations are used as constitutive equations,
just deﬁning
RPQ  UPQ=IPQ
The reader might not feel comfortable about using nonlinear constitutive equations, since
they are not among those studied in Part II of the book.
However, in Part II it was clearly stated that the validity of Kirchhoff’s equations does
not depend on the form of constitutive equations of the circuit elements. Therefore, the
fact that they are nonlinear does not mean that circuits cannot be used to describe
physical systems, including human bodies. It should simply be observed that non-
linearity implies that superposition cannot be used.
Studies performed on the electrical behaviour of the human body have led to a
model that considers it to be composed of subelements that represent the four arts and
the trunk. However, they have also shown that it can be safely assumed that the
trunk’s resistance is negligible, and the four limbs share approximately the same
resistance Rip (the subscript standing for internal-partial).
The equivalent lumped component model of the body, therefore, can be assumed to
be the one shown in the right-hand part of Figure 14.5. It allows equivalent resistances
to be computed in different conﬁgurations:
• Hand-to-hand resistance Rh-h  2Rip
• Hand-to-both-feet resistance Rh-ff  1.5Rip
• Both-hands-to-both-feet resistance Rhh-ff  Rip
ELECTRICITY AND THE HUMAN BODY
445

The value of Rip, depends on the speciﬁc characteristics of the individual, on the
applied voltage, and on the characteristic of the contact between body and live part.
International standards supply information about hand-to-hand resistance in
various conditions. Table 14.1 only shows the impedance as a function of exceeded
the voltage for 5% of the population in the case of contact in dry conditions.
This can be assumed to be the “statistical minimum resistance” of hand-to-hand
resistance, that is, twice Rip.
14.2.4
The Human Body in a Live Circuit
Now that we have drawn lumped parameter models (i.e., constitutive equations) of
both earth and body, we can effectively evaluate what happens when the body comes
into contact with a live part.
By and large, the most common scenario is when someone touches a live part with
his hand while his feet are placed on the ground. This can be analysed with reference
to Figure 14.6. The contents of the block “MV/LV transformer” change from country
to country. The most common situations have already been discussed and presented in
Figures 5.14 and 5.15, to which the reader is referred.
Point A is connected to, and thus (from a circuital point of view) coincides with, the
LV transformer neutral N. The earth electrode of the source MV/LV transformer is
connected to A  N.
Point C is the point at which the hand touches a live part, while point B represents
the contact between the feet and the earth (ground).
This system can be transformed into a circuit (lumped-parameter model of the
system), as shown in Figure 14.7a), in which:
• The whole power system feeding, through terminals A and C, the right-hand
part of the system displayed in Figure 14.6, has been modelled by means of its
Thévenin equivalent (E CA, Z CA).

• The earth’s behaviour is modelled by means of its equivalent model of the type
shown in Figure 14.4.
• The body’s behaviour is modelled by means of a voltage-dependant resistance,
as discussed in section 14.2.3.
• The person’s feet on the ground work like an electrode: if the shoes’ resistance is
disregarded (i.e., is considered to be zero, this simpliﬁes things and boosts
safety), they are a conductor in Electrical contact with the earth; the corre-
sponding earth resistance is named RBT.
• The subscript “b” stands for “body,” while “B” stands for “point B.”
In practical situations, it is safe to say that the neutral to earth resistance RNE and
the Thévenin impedance ZCA are negligible compared to the body’s resistance and to
RBT. Indeed, Rb and RBT are on the order of hundreds of ohms, while RNT and ZCA are
at most one or two. Therefore, it is normal practice to work on the simpliﬁed version of
the circuit of Figure 14.7a, shown in Figure 14.7b.

As regards the numerical value of RBT, it is fairly obvious that this is extremely
variable and depends on the material below the person’s feet and on any metallic
piping just below the ﬂoor.
Following extensive research, it has been internationally agreed to assume two
conventional values of RBT:
• A value of 1000 Ω, when feet-ground contact and the body’s sensitivity to
current are normal;
• A lower value of 200 Ω when a general increase in safety is required.
This happens in medical locations (details in [11]) and, for some nations, such as Italy, in
locations where the feet make contact with wet ground, such as agricultural and
horticultural premises and construction and demolition sites.
When designing safety of installations, it is useful to take as a reference the total
voltage between ﬂoor and the parts likely to be touched before actual contact takes
place. In Figure 14.7b, this is indicated as U0. When the person touches point C with
his hand, the voltage between hand and feet will be lower, equal to UC.
Now, the simple circuit shown in Figure 14.7b, along with what we’ve learned
regarding resistance Rb and RBT, allows us to determine the maximum value of U0
which can persist safely for long periods in an electrical installation: this is the one that
causes the current limit that can safely traverse the body for long periods (i.e., 30 mA
for AC, 150 mA for DC).
With simple computations (not included here) and some approximations, we can
draw the maximum values for voltages Ulim which can remain in an installation for
long periods since they are not expected to cause an electric shock. These are shown
in Table 14.2.
This table shows, once again, that, when voltage is equal, DC systems are much
safer than AC ones.
14.2.5
System Earthing: TT, TN, and IT
The majority of risks come from contact between hands or other body parts and live
elements of the electric circuit—that is, at a different potential from that in the ground
where the user places his feet. For this reason, some parts of the system are usually
earthed (i.e., connected to earth) in such a way as to reduce risk.
In order to understand electrical safety, it is also very important to understand
exposed conductive parts (here also called ECPs).

Definition: Exposed Conductive Parts (ECPs)
These are conductive parts which can be readily touched and which are not
normally live, but which may become live under faulty conditions.
Typical exposed conductive parts are the enclosure walls of electrical appliances,
operating handles, and so on.
Conductive parts that can readily be touched that are enclosures containing live
parts do not necessarily belong to the category of ECPs; indeed, some devices are built
with such high levels of insulation between live parts and enclosures that the
probability of external parts even (if they are conductive) becoming live as a
consequence of a fault is negligible. Equipment with this characteristic is called
Class II equipment and is identiﬁed by the symbol
.
The basic system earthing structures are called TT, TN, and IT. The individual
letters have the following meaning:
• T indicates direct connection of the point to earth (T stands for terra, the Latin
word for earth).
• N indicates direct connection of the element to the neutral point (N stands for
neutral).
• Iindicates that the point is insulated from earth.
Moreover:
• The ﬁrst letter always indicates the connection of a point of the electrical system
(usually the neutral point or when a neutral point is not available, a line
conductor).
• The second letter indicates the connection of all the ECPs of an electrical
installation.
These codes can be better understood by using the system drawings shown in
Figures 14.8 to 14.10, which also show the meaning of the residual current Ir, as
discussed and explained in Section 14.4.
Figure 14.8 refers to a TT system. The upper part of the ﬁgure shows a three-wire
three-phase system, while in the lower part is a single-phase installation (such as the
one usually found in homes), taking energy from one of the three conductors of a
three-phase system. Both neutral point of the electricity source and exposed
conductive parts are connected to the earth, thus producing the earth resistances
RN and RT.
Figure 14.9 refers to two different versions of a TN system: the so-called TN-C
(“C” stands for combined), in which the functions of protection (PE) and neutral (N)
are combined in a single conductor called PEN, and the so-called TN-S (“S” stands for
separated), in which the two conductors are distinct from each other.
ELECTRICITY AND THE HUMAN BODY
449

In any case, the neutral point of the source (i.e., the star centre of the secondary
winding of the MV/LV transformer) is connected directly to earth (i.e., to the earth
electrode), while the ECPs are connected to the neutral point through the PE/PEN
conductor: this justiﬁes the code TN. Some information on how these systems operate
to guarantee the user’s safety will be given in Section 14.3.3, along with their
advantages and disadvantages.
Finally, Figure 14.10 refers to an IT system: the neutral point of the source is
isolated from the earth, while the ECPs are earthed by connecting them the earth by
means of the PE conductor.
Again, information on how these systems operate to guarantee the user’s safety
will be shown in Section 14.3.3.

Direct contact, by deﬁnition,1 is when people or animals come into electric contact
with live parts. By contrast, an indirect contact is, by deﬁnition,2 when people or
animals come into electric contact with exposed conductive parts which have become
live under faulty conditions.
These two modes of contact are very different from both a technical and
behavioural point of view and are dealt with in very different ways both in the
relevant standards and when designing electrical installations. The very deﬁnitions of
direct and indirect contacts show that only indirect contacts involve a fault in the
installation. Therefore, protection against direct contacts is also called basic protec-
tion, and protection against indirect contact is also called fault protection.
14.3.2
Basic Protection (Protection Against Direct Contact)
Basic protection is mainly achieved by surrounding the live parts with insulating
material. In civil environments, except for very low voltage appliances, everything
live (conductor wires, live parts inside appliances) is surrounded by insulating
materials. The minimal requirement for live parts in environments which are

accessible to the public (i.e., excluding spaces where only people with speciﬁc
training in electricity are allowed to enter) is that the so-called jointed test ﬁnger
generally should not be able to enter. If able to enter partially, it must have adequate
clearance from hazardous parts; that is, it must not be able to touch or get too near to
any live part. The test ﬁnger is a device with articulation similar to that of a biological
ﬁnger, with three joints and phalanges.
In some cases, requirements are more stringent. For instance, for holes on
horizontal surfaces (onto which conducting wires could accidentally fall), connecting
with something below that contains live parts, the testing wire must not be able to gain
enter. The testing wire is a straight conducting wire with a diameter of one millimetre.
In spaces accessible to trained personnel, requirements are less rigid.
All components of electrical installations must have an IP code. IP codes express
the ability of these components to resist access by solid or liquid materials. While the
reader is invited to check standards [12] for complete information about IP codes,
some basic information is given here.

ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES

IP codes, composed of the code “IP” and two digits, are easily understood as follows:
• The ﬁrst digit indicates the degree of protection against the penetration of solid
objects.
• The second digit indicates the degree of protection against the penetration of
water.
Table 14.3 shows the meaning of some of the numerical digits employed.
If we consult Table 14.3, we can see that an enclosure with IP20 degree protection
is protected against penetration by the back of a hand (simulated by a sphere) and a
ﬁnger (simulated by the jointed test ﬁnger), but it has no protection against water. For
outdoor installation (in gardens, etc.), it is common to require at least IP34.
When the value of one digit is not speciﬁed, it can be replaced by the letter X. This
way, a IPX4 degree indicates level 4 protection against the penetration of water, as
well as unspeciﬁed protection against the penetration of solid objects.
In some cases, IP codes also have a letter in addition to the two digits. Here it is
only stated that code IPXXB is a slightly less strict version of IP2X, and IP XXD is
slightly less strict than IP4X.
The qualitative prescriptions shown above regarding horizontal and vertical
surfaces are thus translated into quantitative measures by the following prescriptions
(IEC 60364):
• Live parts shall be inside enclosures or behind barriers providing at least a
degree of protection of IPXXB or IP2X.
• Horizontal top surfaces of barriers or enclosures which are readily accessible
shall provide a degree of protection of at least IPXXD or IP4X.
14.3.3
Fault Protection (Protection Against Indirect Contact)
Fault protection, except in the case of SELV systems which are discussed in the next
section, are attained using protective earthing, protective equipotential bonding, and
automatic disconnection in the event of a fault.
Protective Earthing. Exposed conductive parts (clearly deﬁned in Section 14.2.5)
must be connected by means of protective conductors to a system earthing. This
will contribute to maintaining the ECP potential as close as possible to the
potential of the earth on which humans place their feet. This minimizes the
chance of being exposed to a dangerous difference of potential between hands
and feet.
Protective Equipotential Bonding. This is constituted by conductors connecting all
large metallic parts in a building to the building’s system earthing, in such a way
as to enhance even greater “equipotentiality.” Otherwise, in some circum-
stances, non-negligible potential differences could appear between the ground
and these large parts (e.g., the water piping), thus introducing dangers in the
environments.
PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTRIC SHOCK
453



Automatic Disconnection in the Event of a Fault: General Case. The above two
measures are combined with automatic disconnection in the event of a fault: a
protective device automatically interrupts the electricity supply in the event of a
fault of negligible impedance between the line conductor and an ECP; this
interruption will remove any dangerous potential on ECPs. Subsequently,
electricians can analyse the installation, ﬁnd the fault, and remove it before
activating the power supply again.
The protective device may be a circuit breaker, with the appropriate fault
protection characteristics, already in the installation for overcurrent protection
(Chapter 13). This can only happen for TN systems, in which, because of their
nature, faults to ECPs create large currents which can cause a circuit breaker
designed to protect against overcurrent (short-circuit) to trip.
It is instead impossible in TT systems, for which the currents created by
faults to ECPs are much weaker. It will be seen in Section 14.4 that for these
systems special protective devices exist, called RCDs, that are able to fulﬁl the
purpose of disconnecting supply in the event of a fault to ECPs.
Automatic Disconnection in Case of a Fault; TN Systems. To ensure that the
disconnection is fast enough, in the case of TN systems the following
requirement must be fulﬁlled:
Za?Ia £ U0
(14.2)
where:
Za is the impedance of the fault loop comprising the source, the line conductor up to
the point of the fault, and the protective conductor between the point of the fault
and the source;
Ia is the current causing automatic tripping (i.e., opening) of the disconnecting
device in a time ti-TN speciﬁed by the standards, which is in the most common
case (i.e., nominal system voltage not higher than 230 V) equal to 0.4 s;
U0 is the nominal line-to-earth voltage (e.g., in Europe 230 V, in the USA 120 V).
The rationale behind this rule can easily be understood by looking at the circuit
which occurs when a fault to ECP occurs in a TN system (Figure 14.11, showing only
the case of TN-S system, for the sake of brevity). During the fault it is obviously
Za ? If  U0, where If is the fault current (rms value). Equation (14.2) therefore
prescribes
Ia £ If
that is, the current Ia, which the device is able to interrupt in a very short time ti-TN,
must be lower than the actual fault current.
This, combined with the fact that all protection devices have an interruption curve
that is an decreasing function of time (i.e., lower times correspond to larger currents),
justiﬁes what is asserted in the following rule:
456
ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES

Rule: TN systems fault protection
In TN systems equation (14.2) applies, which prescribes that every fault current is
interrupted in a time lower than ti-TN ( 0.4 s for nominal line to earth voltages
lower than 230 V).
Automatic Disconnection in the Event of a Fault: TT Systems. In the case of TT
systems, fault-to-ECP currents are much lower than those of TN systems, and in
order to be detected they require that the protective device be a residual current
device (RCD, see Section 14.4), which is very sensitive even to small currents
toward the system earthing.
The rule to ensure that the disconnection is fast enough in the case of TT
systems is as follows:
Ra?IΔn £ Ulim
(14.3)
where:
Ra is the sum RT  RPE  RT of the resistance of the earth electrode and the
protective conductor for the exposed conductive parts (normally RT dominates);
IΔn is the rated residual operating current of the RCD; that is, the residual current
the RCD is able to interrupt in a time ti-TT, speciﬁed by the standards, which in
the most common case is equal to 0.2 s;
Ulim is the maximum voltage that can stay for unlimited time between the ECPs
and the ground without disconnection; its values are those shown in Table 14.2.
The rationale behind this rule can easily be understood by looking at the circuit that
we have when there is a fault to ECP in a TT system (Figure 14.12). The residual

current sensor will sense the residual current I r which will be equal to the fault current
If. The fault product If  Ra will be equal to the rms voltage on the ECPs—that is, the
voltage that the body touches and that can cause electric shock.
It is thus clear that protection intervenes whenever the voltage between the ECP
and the far earth (point in the circuit indicated by the earth symbol
, overcomes the
voltage limit Ulim—that is, the safety limit shown in Table 14.2 at the end of Section
14.2.4, which is normally, for AC systems, equal to 50 V.
This is summarized in the following rule:
Rule: TT systems fault protection.
In TT systems equation (14.3) applies, which prescribes that every fault current
causing voltages on ECPs higher than Ulim is interrupted in a time lower than ti-TT
( 0.2 s for nominal line-to-earth voltages up to 230 V).
14.3.4
SELV Protection System
It is widely known that electricity at very low voltage is totally safe. For instance,
children’s and even babies’ toys are operated with battery cells with voltages on the
order of a few volts. Voltages that are considered to be intrinsically safe are called
extra-low voltages and, in normal conditions, are up to 25 V if in AC and up to 60 V if
in DC.
Very low voltages can be used to protect against direct and indirect contacts: they
are ofﬁcially called safety extra-low voltage (SELV) and protective extra-low voltage
(PELV) systems.

ELECTRIC SHOCK AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES

The difference between SELV and PELV is beyond the scope of this book; note
only that the maximum safety level is reached in SELV systems.
SELV and PELV systems are designed so that voltage cannot exceed the value of
extra-low voltage: under normal conditions and under single-fault conditions. This
means that the source of energy must have extra-low voltage, and the electrical
separation from systems having higher voltage must be very clear-cut.
The concept is clariﬁed in Figure 14.13, in which a possible fault inside the
transformer separating a 230-V system from a 24-V system can cause unsafe voltages
in the installation connected to the secondary of the transformer.
14.4
THE RESIDUAL CURRENT DEVICE (RCD) PRINCIPLE
OF OPERATION
In previous sections it was stated that the most common and effective device for
automatic disconnection of the electric supply caused by a fault is the so-called
residual current device.
Let us deﬁne, in compliance with international standards, the residual current:
Definition: Residual current
A residual current is the sum of instantaneous values of all currents ﬂowing in a
single-phase or in a three-phase system.
To better understand this concept see Figures 14.8, 14.9, and 14.10, where the
value Ir of the residual current is shown as a function of the currents ﬂowing in the
wires, paying attention to correct directions.
In a healthy single-phase or three-phase system, the sum of all instantaneous
currents delivered by the supply (i.e., the residual current) is virtually zero. This can be
easily understood, considering that Kirchhoff’s law applies to all loads and all the
conductors.

THE RESIDUAL CURRENT DEVICE (RCD) PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
459

Naturally, actual residual currents are only approximately null, since the insulator
material of all the installation components is not perfectly insulating; and some drainage
current, albeit very small, ﬂows between the conductors and the ECPs. This results in a
net residual current ﬂow, which is again small. It should be stressed that in the circuits
shown in Figures 14.8, 14.9, and 14.10, in the absence of fault, the residual current is
exactly zero, since circuits are ideal models of reality; however, more detailed models
dealing with phenomena related to the dispersion of current between conductors and
ECPs, will be able to show the presence of those small residual currents also in healthy
systems. The entity of residual currents in healthy systems depends on their physical
extension, ranging from a few milliamperes in small systems and reaching up to several
hundred milliamperes in the largest ones.
This situation of null residual current Ir changes dramatically when a fault occurs
between one of the conductors and one exposed conductive part, as shown just as an
example for a TT system in Figure 14.12. In this example, the single-phase residual
current Ir, which could be measured by the shown residual current sensor, is far from
zero, being
I r  I ph  I N  I f
A residual current sensor can therefore be effectively used to measure the fault to ECP
currents.
Residual currents can be detected in several ways. One typical means is shown in
Figure 14.14. This method is interesting because its operation is very easy to
understand, being based on Faraday’s and Ampère’s laws. Here the residual current
sensor is constituted by a rectangular torus of ferromagnetic material containing three
windings. Windings one and two have exactly the same number of turns:
N1  N2  N12.
If we ignore the leakage ﬂux, which is acceptable in these devices, the ﬂux
circulating in the magnetic circuit is
Φ  N1I 1 	 N2I 2=R  NI 1 	 I 2=R  N12I r=R
In which R is the magnetic circuit reluctance and the residual current is
I r  I 1 	 I 2
The ﬂux Φ, or any other quantity proportional to it, is therefore a measure of the
residual current Ir. In particular the electromotive force at the terminals of coil 3 (with
N3 turns) is proportional to Ir and thus constitutes a good measure of it.
When this device feeds a healthy installation, we have Ir  0, and also the voltage
across coil 3 is zero.
If, on the contrary, a fault in the installation fed by the wires 1 and 2 (in which I1
and I2 ﬂow) causes some residual current to be present, a signiﬁcant residual ﬂux is
induced in the torus, which causes an electromotive force to be generated on winding
460

three. This then feeds the actuator a, which causes the breaker to trip (i.e., to open the
circuit).
The a box absorbs a very low current I a, which does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence Φ.
14.5
WHAT ELSE?
This section simply aims to stress that we have only dealt with the basics of safety.
Designing an electrical installation requires attention to many aspects which could not
be included in this or the previous chapter, simply because of the introductory nature
of this book.
Protective actions to be considered were listed at the end of Chapter 13. Here they
are again, with an indication in brackets of the standards containing the corresponding
measures to be taken, if available.

inﬂuences [6]

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS:
STRUCTURE AND OPERATION
For the Instructor
This chapter is not concerned with turning readers into experts on large power
systems; there are speciﬁc textbooks available which serve this purpose. Instead,
its aim is to provide readers with a basic idea of these systems so they have
sufﬁcient background when dealing with the LV installation of an electric machine
or drive.
A good introductory book in electrical power systems, covering the topics of this
chapter and much more, is the [bp1].
15.1
AGGREGATION OF LOADS AND INSTALLATIONS: THE
POWER SYSTEM
In the previous chapter, we provided information on the structure of LV installations.
LV installations, both single-phase and three-phase, are usually just the extreme
terminal parts of a much larger system which comprises power plants, transformation
power stations, and extra-high voltage, high-voltage, and medium-voltage lines, as
well as, in many cases, trunks of low-voltage lines. The development and operation of
these large power systems require special expertise.

In this chapter we provide some basic characteristics of large power system
structures and operations, starting with an explanation of why they are built this way.
15.2
TOWARD AC THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
The number of users supplied by a single generator can be very high. In fact, the
power of user devices rarely exceeds a few kilowatts and in many cases it is a fraction
of a kW. Conventional generators, instead, have sizes ranging from 10 MW to
1000 MW. The basic scheme for feeding such a large number of users at constant
voltage using a single generator is the tree structure ideally depicted in Figure 15.1,
assuming, for instance, that a 100-MW generator is required to supply 100,000 1-kW
users. In this example, the system voltage was set at a value which was not dangerous
for humans, 100 V. Each peripheral line supplies 10 users; proceeding upstream,
toward the generator, each node gathers 10 branches. The voltage being constant, at
each node the currents are multiplied by 10. The practical unfeasibility of such a
distribution system is evident, since it would require a generator rated for 1 MA and
power lines able to transport 100 kA.
To reduce the current to reasonable values, it is essential to renounce the 100 V
voltage in the parts of the system that are not directly in contact with users, which
means increasing voltages in the upstream branches where the transmitted power is
higher. This can be achieved in economic terms, but only in alternating current (AC),
using transformers,1 invented around 1885 (by Tesla and others).
This consideration is one of the main reasons why electric power systems,
initially conceived and built in DC in the early 1880s,2 rapidly converted to AC as
soon as their extension grew and transformers were made available on an industrial

1Nowadays, the introduction of DC/DC converters (see Chapter 8) extends the potential uses of DC
distribution systems, at least for small-power applications. In large plants, for reasons of reliability, cost, and
efﬁciency, transformers and AC distribution systems are used.
2In 1881 the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of New York inaugurated the very ﬁrst electricity
distribution system worldwide, consisting of short underground cables. The Pearl Street station was fed by
four 250-hp boilers, supplying steam to six 110-V DC generators. Similar plants were installed in the next
two years in London and Milan.

scale. The ﬁrst commercial single-phase AC distribution system was installed in
Oregon in 1889–1890.
It is worth noting that the invention and improvement of the incandescent light
bulb in the 1870s made lighting the ﬁrst publicly available energy application of
electrical power. Previously, electricity was basically applied to telecommunications
(telegraph, 1837).
Using transformers, it is possible to choose the most convenient voltage–current pair
for each point of the system on the basis of safety, efﬁciency, and capability. This can be
done, for instance, for the system presented in Figure 15.1, as described in Figure 15.2.
Another reason which fostered the development of the alternating current is that
circuit breakers—that is, devices designed to interrupt short-circuit currents—can
take advantage of it.
Indeed, breakers contain two mechanical contacts which separate from each other
when the breaker is required to trip. If current is ﬂowing when the opening action is
required, an electric arc is generated through these contacts that must somehow be
extinguished. This is much easier in AC than in DC, since in AC the breaker can
exploit the current’s periodical zero crossing.
Circuit breakers soon proved to be essential in order to eliminate the faulty part of the
systemandtolimittheeffectsofshortcircuitsonsystemreliability,safety,andcontinuity
of supply. Lastly, AC alternators are deﬁnitely more reliable than DC generators.
The discovery of the rotating magnetic ﬁeld by G. Ferraris in 1885 and the advent
of the induction motor (Tesla, 1888) ﬁnally led to the use of the polyphase AC system,
in particular the three-phase system. The polyphase system prevailed over the single-
phase system because of the possibility of generating rotating magnetic ﬁelds using
ﬁxed windings (see Section 10.2.1); this opportunity simpliﬁed all rotating machines
used to convert electrical energy into mechanical and vice versa,3 and made them
more reliable and efﬁcient. Only the peripheral branches of the system, to which
small-size users are connected, are single-phase for reasons of economy.

torque (see Section 11.2).
TOWARD AC THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
467

The ﬁrst commercial, three-phase 2.3-kV system was installed by the Southern
California Edison Company in 1893. Since then, electric power networks have always
been three-phase AC systems, operating at constant4 voltage as we saw in Section 12.2
(shunt connection).
15.3
ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS
In order to supply a huge number of small users by means of a single barycentric
power plant, which was the usual task of the earliest power systems, the most basic
distribution network has a tree structure. As we saw previously, this tree has branches
which decrease in importance from the centre to the periphery, while links have a
voltage proportional to their power ﬂow. The ﬁnal ones, to which the majority of users
are connected, always operate at low voltage (LV); this makes it safe for people
without any professional skills to use electricity for domestic purposes. Voltages of up
to 1 kV (phase-to-phase, rms), in AC are normally considered to be LV.
The number of voltage levels, starting from the power plant to reach the smallest
loads, is variable. Nowadays the most common is a three-level distribution system,
which includes a high-voltage (HV) level, a medium-voltage (MV) level, and, ﬁnally,
a LV distribution network.5 For reasons we will see later, the three levels are
commonly referred to as subtransmission grid and as primary and secondary
distribution network. Normally, voltages larger than LV levels and up to 35 kV
(line–line, rms) are considered as MV.6 More information about the voltage levels
used in different regions is given in Section 15.4.
Figure 15.3 shows the evolution from a simple subtransmission grid to a power
system comprising downstream distribution networks. The corresponding single-line
diagrams are also shown.
In single-line diagrams, readers can recognize symbols already shown in the previous
chapters of this book for the generator and the transformer. In the same diagrams, long
longitudinal links indicate power lines. A short transversal dash represents a “busbar”—
that is, a conductor used to enable a common connection between several components.
Oblique dashes emanating from this busbar indicate the beginning of other power lines,
which correspond to other branches of the tree.
Voltages are chosen by distribution companies according to load density and for local
historical reasons.
4In the case of AC systems, this terminology obviously means that voltage is constant in amplitude.
5Generally speaking, LV networks have nominal (phase-to-phase, rms) voltages up to 1 kV. The boundary
between MV and HV depends on the country concerned and is normally between 30 kV and 100 kV.
International standards tend to treat voltages of up to 35 kV differently from those beyond; this value is
therefore a natural threshold between MV and HV systems and is internationally recognized as such.
6In many European countries the same levels are often called primary, secondary and tertiary (or LV)
distribution networks, which can cause misunderstandings.
468
LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

In Europe, LV networks are all three-phase systems (see Chapter 6), whose
structure is shown in Figure 6.13. LV distribution systems have a radius of action of a
few hundred metres and all operate at 400 V (phase-to-phase, for supplying three-
phase users) to 230 V (phase-to-neutral, for feeding single-phase users). With
reference to Chapter 6, note that the ratio between phase-to-phase and phase-to-
neutral voltages is close to
ﬃﬃﬃ
3
p
. MV networks range from 6–10 kV to 20–35 kV
(depending on the considered country and on the load density), covering a radius of a
few kilometres, while HV networks can reach 150 kV, with a radius on the order of a
few tens of kilometres.
In North America, power for a typical home is derived from a transformer that
reduces the voltage to 240/120 V (both for single-phase users) distributing electricity
with a three-wire line, as shown in Figure 6.14. The transformer is single-phase, with a
secondary voltage of 240 V; a plug in the midpoint of its secondary winding allows a
third wire to be used to supply 120-V users. Three-phase four-wire systems, similar to
the one depicted in Figure 5.13, are also in use; in this case, voltages are usually 120/
208 V or 277/480 V.7
The tree structure, while very simple and cheap, does not guarantee the best quality
of service in terms of continuity of supply, because each node has only one feeding
source. To provide backup power to the main nodes, power networks soon become
meshed, especially at the level of HV distribution, where per-kilowatt costs required
to increase the continuity of supply are lower. Here the “mesh” word takes a slightly

different meaning from that used in circuit analysis: it indicates a loop of three-phase
transmission lines and covers areas of square kilometres, where they are loops inside
circuits (see Figure 15.4). Note how the single-line diagram is modiﬁed at the
receiving subtransmission busbar (highlighted by a circle): the oblique dashes
indicate incoming power lines, hence a meshed structure.
MV and LV distribution networks may be meshed (usually in urban districts) or
radial (as in many rural areas), depending on their extension and on the load density.
Some networks have a meshed structure but are radially operated, keeping open some
links, basically to simplify automatic disconnection of faults.
15.4
TRANSMISSION AND INTERCONNECTION GRIDS
In the earliest power systems, during the two last decades of the nineteenth century, it
was possible to install small power plants in a barycentric position with respect to the
users, often in the city centre (Manhattan 1881, London 1882, Milan 1883).
Afterwards, as power systems rapidly grew in size and number of users, for reasons
of layout, environmental impact, and localization of the primary energy, power plants
supplying large urban areas were required to be placed far away from the load centres.
In this case, a distribution network like the one shown in Figure 15.5a, where
many HV nodes are supplied by the same power plant, is in general not economical.
It is, in fact, much cheaper and efﬁcient to convey energy up to the centre of gravity
of the loads by means of a single higher capacity power line (see Figure 15.5b). Such a
line, usually operated at a higher voltage than the supplied HV distribution system,
performs the so-called functions of energy “transmission.” Please note how the single-
line diagram is modiﬁed to incorporate a further voltage level (thicker line).

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

For evident reasons of continuity of service, the main nodes of the HV distribution
system require a second power supply. This usually comes from the power station
intended to serve as an adjacent distribution system (see Figure 15.6). Such a function
is generally referred to as “interconnection” and corresponds to the meshing of the
transmission grid. Note how the single-line diagram is modiﬁed at the receiving
transmission busbar to indicate a meshed structure, similar to what we have seen for
the subtransmission grid.
This scheme soon prevailed over the idea (typical of the earliest power systems) of
independent electric islands, each one supplied by its own power plant. The
synchronous operation of contiguous islands, up to a single, large, interconnected
system, brings many advantages, such as:
• the existence of a common reserve for the generation system, in order to increase
the continuity of service to consumers, ensuring reliability in the event of
contingencies such as unscheduled outages;

• a peak value of the total load which is lower than the sum of the peak values of
the single islands, which are generally not simultaneous;
• cheaper operation, thanks to a better integration between different forms of
generation installed in adjacent areas, like thermoelectric units and hydro power
plants;
• lower frequency deviation from nominal value, as will be discussed in
Section 15.6.
In many countries, where loads and generators are distributed in a relatively
uniform way, the link between all contiguous distribution systems leads to the
creation of an extensive meshed grid with very high voltage, which simultaneously
performs the functions of transmission and interconnection, as happens in many
portions of the European and US grids. Within these grids, which collect the energy
generated by the large-scale production plants to the main HV nodes, the func-
tions of transmission and interconnection are intimately related and almost
indistinguishable.
In some particular cases, however, it is possible to identify power lines which
explicitly fulﬁl the typical function of transmission paths, usually for conveying
energy toward regions with high levels of consumption by exploiting primary
resources available in scarcely inhabited areas or even desert. This happens, for
example, to transmit the hydropower produced in subarctic Sweden or in northern
Québec to the more populated southern regions (Figure 15.7).
In Europe, the transmission–interconnection grid is operated at 400 kV and
partially at 230 kV. In the United States and Canada, voltages of 230 kV, 345 kV,
500 kV, 735 kV, and 765 kV are commonplace. Transmission voltages above 230 kV
are usually referred to as extra-high voltages (EHV). Since the early 1990s, also 1000-
kV and 1100-kV lines for long-distance transmission purposes were energized. It is

evident that a lot has happened since 1896, when an 11-kV three-phase line was
transmitting 10 MW from Niagara Falls to Buffalo, over a distance of 20 miles.
Since the 1950s, interconnection between power systems can also be ensured for
very long distances (overhead lines) or across the sea (submarine cables), using DC
lines, the so-called high-voltage direct-current links (HVDC), currently operating at
up to 800 kV. Two stations, used for converting AC to DC and DC to AC
respectively, are placed at the extremes of the line. If two AC power systems
are connected only through a DC link, they can be operated at different frequencies,
as shown in Figure 15.8.

MODERN STRUCTURE OF POWER SYSTEMS
AND DISTRIBUTED GENERATION
Based on what we have learned, Figure 15.9 summarizes the typical structure of a
traditional power system. The depicted scheme includes:
• a production park composed of large-scale synchronous generators, connected
to the transmission–interconnection grid by means of step-up transformers; the
alternator’s voltage is usually in the range 15–30 kV, depending on its power
size: higher voltages are not allowed due to insulation requirements; the prime
movers are usually hydraulic turbines, steam turbines (from coal, oil, nuclear
fuel), or gas turbines;
• a meshed EHV transmission–interconnection grid (not less than 230 kV),
whose nodes are the so-called “main stations,” which in turn feed downstream
grids;
• a meshed HV subtransmission grid (60–150 kV); for traditional reasons,
medium-scale old generators (10–50 MW) are still connected to this grid
through step-up transformers; also large industrial customers (the so-called
“HV loads”) are directly supplied by this grid, in the sense that they operate

• an MV primary distribution network, fed by HV/MV “substations” and usually
radial, except in areas of high load density; this network supplies MV loads and
MV/LV step-down “distribution transformers”;
• an LV secondary, radial, distribution network that supplies small industrial
loads, as well as residential and commercial users.
Since the last decades of the twentieth century, the progressive advent of the
so-called distributed generation8 (DG) has introduced the installation of small-
scale power plants directly connected to the MV and LV distribution networks
(Figure 15.10). DG uses a wide range of technologies, including gas turbines, diesel
engines, solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines, fuel cells, biomass, and small
hydroelectric generators. Compared to traditional power systems, basically supplied
by a few large-scale production plants located far away from load centres, this huge
ﬂeet of small-scale generators disseminated over the whole system constitutes a real
novelty. Such a change of paradigm is full of opportunities but is not exempt from
operational difﬁculties, as discussed in Section 15.8.
The recent success of DG generation is mainly due to the frequent use of well-
subsidized renewable sources and to the improved efﬁciency performances of modern
small-scale plants. Electricity production close to load centres not only reduces long-
distance transmission losses, but also enables the exploitation of “waste heat”

8Also referred to as embedded generation. Distributed generation is distinct from “dispersed generation,”
which is typiﬁed by generators (usually based on diesel engines) that provide power to their loads as
“electric islands”—that is, without connection to an external large grid.

resulting from many forms of thermoelectric generation; long-distance heat trans-
mission, in fact, would not be cost-effective. Some DG units that use conventional
fuel-burning engines are then designed to operate as combined heat and power
systems (CHP, or cogeneration), capable of providing heat to buildings or industrial
processes. Combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP, or trigeneration) is also
possible, using absorption chillers that convert waste heat into cooling.
The installation of a DG unit by an electricity user, in combination with a
preexistent load, is also referred to as “self-production”. The perfect balance between
production and consumption power proﬁles is not strictly required; in fact the self-
producer can buy extra demand from the network and sell (at other times) production
surplus to the distributor.
The impact of distributed generation can be so signiﬁcant that the power produced
at medium and low voltage can even exceed the load supplied by the corresponding
distribution network; in this case, the power ﬂow at the local HV/MV substation
reverses and the primary distribution network supplies the upstream subtransmission
grid. For the sake of simplicity, Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1 did not take this possibility
into account. A more rigorous scheme is depicted in Figure 15.11, where double
arrows indicate the possibility of reverse power ﬂow at the HV/MV substation.

BASICS OF POWER SYSTEM OPERATION
A signiﬁcant peculiarity marks a deep distinction between electric power systems and
any other energy infrastructure: since electricity cannot be directly stored, generation
and load must be continuously kept in perfect balance.

Direct storage of electricity might be possible inside capacitors or inductors whose stored
energy is, as seen in Chapter 5, (1/2)CU2 and (1/2)LI2 respectively (U being the capacitor
voltage and I the conductor current). However, the quantity of energy stored in an
ordinary capacitor or an inductor is very low with respect to needs. Electricity can be
indirectly stored by ﬁrst converting it into other forms of energy. This can be done, for
instance, in electrochemical (batteries), kinetic (ﬂywheels), or gravitational form (water
reservoirs). Even indirect storage is rather limited, due to economic and technical
reasons.
Any mismatch between power supply and demand causes the loss of torque
equilibrium at the rotors of all synchronous generators: their rotational speed, thus
the frequency of generated electromotive force, increases or decreases depending on
the sign of the imbalance. The need for keeping the rotor’s speed within strict
tolerances,9 as well as contractual requirements in terms of power quality,10 require
that the power balance between generation and load be kept constant and, if needed,
promptly restored.
The master rule that electricity has to be promptly available on demand permeates
any consideration in the planning and operation of power systems. On the other hand,
the strict relationship between system balance and grid frequency is another important
reason (in addition to those already mentioned in Section 15.2) why AC systems soon
surpassed the ﬁrst DC grids: the frequency value can be used as a common signal to
highlight and correct imbalances, without requiring any other communication infra-
structure between generators and loads.
9Underspeed operation can be dangerous for the generator shaft due to possible mechanical resonances,
while overspeed operation must be limited due to centrifugal forces.
10Frequency of voltage provided to the users must be very close to its rated value (usually ±1%), since it
inﬂuences the performance of many appliances—for instance, motor speed.

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

Traditionally, single users are left free to modify their own power consumption, provided
that it does not overcome a contractual limit, basically set to avoid network overload. The
power balance used to be ensured by generators, required to meet the constantly
changing load demand and to cope with unscheduled outages, by means of “frequency
regulation” (see Section 15.6.1). Nowadays the increasing share of intermittent and
nonprogrammable generations, like photovoltaic plants and wind farms, requires more
complex balancing methods, where energy storage and controllable loads are directly
involved in maintaining a constant equilibrium between supply and demand. This will be
discussed in Section 15.8.
However, operating a real-time frequency regulation is not enough to guarantee the
load demand to be met over time (“followed”). In fact, all generators in operation11
must always keep an adequate power margin between their nominal rating and their
present production level, for regulation and balancing purposes. Furthermore, the
number of generators required to meet the load can differ widely between night and
day due to the signiﬁcant variation in demand; last but not least, the start-up of a cold
thermoelectric unit can require up to 12–15 hours12 and must be scheduled ahead of
time. For all these reasons, a complex organizational machine is required, over
different time periods, in order to ensure the load is met.
• Planning: With regard to the timing of installing generation, transmission, and
distribution infrastructures, system adequacy must be guaranteed years or
decades in advance to forecast future load peaks; strategic planning involves
long-term choices like grid development and the amount, type, size, and
location of power plants.
• Mid-term operation: The time span is usually one year; typical issues are
scheduling the maintenance of power plants and allocating the use of hydro
resources to each week of the year.
• Short-term operation: This is run 24 hours before the energy delivery, with
15 or 60 minute steps. Main tasks are load forecasting, unit commitment (which
power plant must be spinning at each hour of the following day?) and Power
Dispatching (what power will each spinning generator deliver?). The selected
solution must not only meet the load without congesting the power links, but
also guarantee security margins for real-time balancing operations (spinning
and nonspinning generation reserve).
• Real-time operation: Rigorous compliance with unit commitment and power
dispatching ensures that frequency regulation operated by generators constantly
meets the load demand, which ﬂuctuates continuously and randomly. Sudden
contingencies like generator outages, unexpected load variations, and line faults
are still possible; a quick protection system and constant supervision by a
system control room are then required. In the most severe cases, defence plans
are activated for emergency corrective actions like load shedding.
11Also called spinning generators.

BASICS OF POWER SYSTEM OPERATION

15.6.1
Frequency Regulation
To keep the power system in balance, most spinning generators are provided with
an automatic control device, which regulates the mechanical power supplied by the
local prime mover (i.e., the mechanical source of power) depending on the
measured difference between the actual and the nominal rotor speed. This mecha-
nism is called load-frequency control or, especially in Europe, primary fre-
quency regulation.
Figure 15.12 illustrates how this control is effected by a single generator. When
the frequency—hence the rotor speed—equals its nominal value f0 (typically 50 or
60 Hz), the prime mover provides the mechanical power Pref, corresponding to the
desired power output of the generator. If rotors slow down and the frequency
drops—for example, due to a sudden increase in load demand—the controller boosts
the power output provided by the prime mover,13 according to the characteristic
shown in Figure 15.12. As a result, the active power supplied by this generator
increases, thus helping to meet the additional load: the lower the slope of the load-
frequency characteristic, the higher the share of the extra demand that is met by the
generator.
In large power systems, load-frequency control is performed by hundreds or
thousands of generators that run synchronously to supply the load, meeting its
random variations and coping with unexpected outages of electrical components.
Thanks to the simultaneous action of this huge number of generators, constantly
ready to provide balance, the frequency ﬂuctuations in highly interconnected
systems are very small.
Primary regulation is able to quickly restore the power balance, usually within
20–30 seconds. However, the ﬁnal frequency always differs from the initial one;
otherwise the balancing action provided by primary regulators would be null:
Figure 15.12 clearly shows that if f  f0, P would be brought back to Pref.
Moreover, primary regulation is autonomously provided by generators without
any kind of central supervision; power ﬂows in the transmission grid, particularly in
the links between adjacent countries (“tie-lines”), are consequently modiﬁed. To
13This can be done by operating the valve which regulates the ﬂow of steam or water to the turbine, in the
case of thermoelectric or hydroelectric power plants respectively.

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

restore nominal frequency and the commercial value of power ﬂows at intercon-
nections, a further frequency regulation is required.
This secondary frequency regulation, or automatic generation control (AGC),
is slower (its ﬁnal steady state is reached in 10–15 minutes); it is activated by a central
controller (one for each interconnected country) and is performed by a predeﬁned
subset of large generators. In the previous example, these would be committed to
providing extra power in order to re-increase the frequency up to its nominal value,
thus relieving primary regulators and ﬁnally meeting the entire additional load. They
do this by shifting their load-frequency characteristic (Figure 15.13), so they can
provide a higher power output P0
ref when the nominal frequency is restored. The sum
of terms P0
ref  Pref, extended to all generators performing AGC, must equal the extra
load demand.
Scheduled power ﬂows at interconnections can be restored simply by activating the
secondary regulation exclusively in the country where the initial event occurred that
caused the power mismatch. This area can be easily identiﬁed even when the reasons
for the power imbalance are unknown; in fact, a parameter called Area Control Error
(ACE), which is an opportune combination of measures of frequency and power ﬂows
across tie-lines, is constantly calculated and monitored in each country: secondary
regulation must be carried out only in the area where ACE is non-null.
Other supplementary controls periodically reduce the integral of the frequency
error to zero, so that appliances that depend on the grid frequency—like many
clocks—can run correctly.
Primary and then secondary regulations modify the working point of the power
system, thus altering the scheduled operation of the generators which perform AGC.
The valuable power margin made available by these generators for balancing
purposes must, however, be restored to be ready to cope with future contingencies;
furthermore, power plants under AGC are not necessarily the cheapest ones. For this
reason, a third, even slower, regulation is usually activated to restore their scheduled
production within a few hours. This tertiary regulation is carried out on an economic
basis by selecting the cheapest power plants available to relieve generators under
AGC and meet the entire extra demand (economic dispatching).
Primary and secondary frequency regulations are always performed by automatic
controllers, which act on spinning generators. Conversely, the times involved in
tertiary regulation are long enough to also allow the use of nonspinning generators,

committing the cheapest and quickest of them to start-up. In many countries,
economic dispatching is manually operated.
The described balancing methods basically rely on conventional generators, like
thermoelectric and hydroelectric power plants, which are relatively consistent and easily
to control. On the contrary, new forms of production, like solar or wind power plants,
inject a power proﬁle into the grid which strictly depends on the real, current, and random
availability of sun or wind. The increasing penetration of such an intermittent non-
controllable generation is today pushing toward a deep revision of balancing methods.
This will be discussed in Section 15.8.
15.6.2
Voltage Regulation
The operation of an electric system is not limited to maintaining the balance
between production and load, which means dispatching the active power. In fact,
the system operator must also keep voltages at grid nodes close to their nominal
value, usually within a range of ±5%. This is because electric appliances do not
tolerate large voltage variations, both for safety and performance reasons. Low
voltages dim lights and slow down induction motors14; high voltages can cause the
saturation of the magnetic cores of all electrical machines or, even worse, the
ﬂashover of insulation materials.
The primary way of keeping voltages in the desired range is by controlling the
excitation of synchronous generators in power plants. As discussed in Chapter 11,
the ﬁeld current of an alternator directly affects the amplitude of its electromotive
force (EMF). Unless the machine is connected to a prevailing network, changing
EMF Er results in the voltage U being modiﬁed at the machine terminals. This is
evident from Figure 15.14, where the external grid is described by its Thévenin
equivalent.
14As we saw in Chapter 12, for a given value of slip, the mechanical torque provided by an induction motor
is proportional to the square of its terminal voltage (see for instance eq. 12.10, considering that, except at the
very beginning of the motor starting, Us  U1). As a consequence, if supply voltage drops, the torque-speed
curve depicted in Figure 12.8 or 12.9 ﬂattens, thus crossing the load curve at a lower speed.

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

Every synchronous generator is then provided with an automatic voltage
regulator (AVR) that controls the ﬁeld current in such a way that the voltage
U at the machine terminals is kept at a desired value, or setpoint (primary voltage
regulation). Moreover, system operators make opportune real-time calibrations of
setpoints (secondary voltage regulation) in order to also keep the voltage of
contiguous load nodes within a proper range. While frequency regulation is
operated at system level (frequency is the same at all nodes15), voltage regulation
has more local features, since an AVR has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence only on nearby
nodes.
As we have already seen [see equation (10.8)], the amplitude of the electromotive
force directly affects the reactive power Q exchanged between the synchronous
machine and the network it is connected to: overexcitation corresponds to injecting
reactive power into the grid, and vice versa. For this reason:
• Secondary voltage regulation is also called “reactive power dispatching,” since
it deﬁnes how the reactive power required by the loads is generated by different
power plants; as the load demand of reactive power changes throughout the day,
also reactive power dispatching is time-varying.
• Any appliance supplying reactive power, like R–C loads, increases voltage at
the local and nearby nodes; any device absorbing reactive power, like R–L
loads, decreases voltage at the local and nearby nodes;
• Any device able to adjust its supply or absorption of reactive power can provide
voltage regulation, exactly like a synchronous machine. Among shunt-con-
nected passive devices, inductive reactors, capacitors, and their combination
(Static Var Controllers, SVC) are usual. Power electronics is nowadays
providing converters which generate AC electromotive forces which are
controllable in amplitude and phase, and capable of exchanging P and Q in
the four quadrants exactly like a synchronous machine (obviously P must be
supported by an energy source or a storage). Among them, STATCOM are
devices unable to exchange active power, so they appear similar to a synchro-
nous machine without the prime mover: since they provide a voltage which is
always in phase with UTh, they can be used for the purposes of voltage
regulation, by absorbing or providing reactive power.
Voltage regulation can be performed by installing special types of transformers
called tap-changer transformers in the grid. These have an adjustable turns ratio N2/
N1, and therefore the on-line changing of this ratio changes the ratio of its output
voltage to input. If coil number one is connected to a constant voltage, for instance, an
increase of N2/N1 implies a rise in the secondary voltage (i.e., connected with the coil
with N2 turns). Changing the turns ratio is called tap-changing.
15Transient phenomena involving the presence of different frequencies at grid nodes (rotor oscillations) are
beyond the scope of this book.
BASICS OF POWER SYSTEM OPERATION
481

On-load tap-changing, which means tap-changing without disconnecting loads, is
usual for EHV/HV and for HV/MV transformers.
Tap-changing used to be the main tool for voltage regulation on the distribution
networks. Nowadays the massive presence of distributed generation offers new
opportunities to network operators, provided that DG is involved in frequency
and voltage regulation.
15.7
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES
AND DEREGULATED POWER SYSTEMS
The ﬁrst power systems were installed and operated by private business companies.
As the social importance of electricity grew, such companies became providers of a
“public service,” the so-called investor-owned monopolistic utilities. Free enterprise,
natural monopoly over a given territory, and a relatively weak regulatory framework
were the features of this ﬁrst era.
In many countries, after World War II, mass electriﬁcation required common
standards to be applied to the different regional contexts, especially as far as the
connection of rural users was concerned. Business initiatives pursued by investor-
owned companies could not always guarantee the same connection rights and uniform
quality levels. For these reasons, in many countries the electric service was nationalized.
Both investor-owned and public utilities were usually organized as vertically
integrated companies, in the sense that they were directly responsible for most of the
generation capacity and for transmission and distribution facilities.
The rationale for combining all functions in a single ﬁrm, also including long-term
planning, dispatching, R&D, and sales, was basically related to the physics of
electricity delivery and to the need to keep generation and consumption always in
balance. This challenging task requires a central authority to govern supply and
demand of electricity along the power grid. There were also economic reasons for
vertical integration. Low-cost production requires the simultaneous optimization of
generator dispatching and transmission capacity; long-run proﬁtability requires the
coordination of investment decisions at all stages of the chain, from generators to the
LV distribution network.
Vertically integrated utilities performed all the activities described in the previous
paragraph at minimum cost, optimizing the use of their own assets under predeﬁned
quality standards. Tariffs applied to users were basically cost-driven.
Following the success of deregulation in many sectors of the economy, such as
telecommunications, electricity systems have undergone a similar transition since the
early 1990s. In many countries, vertically integrated utilities were progressively
“unbundled”; that is, their functions of generating power, transmitting it over EHV
and HV lines and distributing power to ﬁnal users, were assigned to different
companies, introducing competition both in generation and supply. Nowadays market
structures and regulatory policies are extremely diversiﬁed around the world; various
gradations of unbundling are in use, and there is no standard market model. However,
some common features can be outlined.
482
LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

• Transmission and distribution remain most efﬁciently organized as natural
monopolies whose activities are strictly regulated in order to ensure non-
discriminatory access to the transport infrastructure by all commercial operators
(third-party access).
• On the wholesale market, generating companies (GENCOs) offer their energy
output to retailers and, almost always, to large end-users; this can be performed
through yearly agreements (bilateral contracts) or in more complex market-
places managed by an independent market operator, like the day-ahead spot
market. In the latter case, bid-based, security-constrained economic dispatching
derives from a classic supply and demand equilibrium, usually setting prices on
an hourly basis. Pay-as-bid or marginal price mechanisms can be adopted. In
order to avoid congestions on grid bottlenecks, market clearing is performed by
superimposing power ﬂow constraints, which results in zonal or nodal pricing.
• In the retail market, retailers sell energy to end-use customers in the form of
bilateral contracts; small clients can usually purchase electricity also from their
local distributor at a regulated tariff. Consumers rarely face real-time pricing; in
any case in the mid-term the retail market reﬂects the average prices set by the
wholesale market.
• An independent system operator (ISO) is responsible for system reliability and
security; for this reason, it must always ensure an adequate amount of generation
reserve for real-time balancing; generators offer this availability in “ancillary
service markets” operated by the ISO in the afternoon before the day of energy
delivery, just after the end of the energy market sessions. The economic
settlement can be ex-ante (generators are paid for their availability) or ex-
post (only actual real-time balancing operations are remunerated). In the ﬁrst
case, the ISO usually charges all customers for power reserve, pro-quota; in the
latter, balancing costs can be charged to the producers or consumers who caused
the mismatch between demand and supply the ISO is also responsible for
defence plans and for system restoration after a blackout. In many countries, the
ISO directly operates the transmission system.
In many countries, competition has promoted efﬁciency and stimulated the refur-
bishment of old power plants. Short-term operation of deregulated power systems has
frequently reduced energy prices, at least net of other factors like fuel costs. Never-
theless, there is no clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of the electricity market
in terms of long-term system adequacy—that is, its structural capacity for meeting
load. According to many economists, market-driven planning can cause dangerous
ﬂuctuations of available resources, namely the generating park, which means the
uncontrolled alternation between long periods of lack and of excess generation
capacity. These “boom–bust cycles” have a serious impact on system reliability
and quality of supply. In some cases, regulators and policy makers are currently
introducing “capacity payment” mechanisms to stimulate GENCOs to install new
plants also during low-price periods, instead of postponing investments until the next
price spikes.

RECENT CHALLENGES AND SMART GRIDS
The transition toward a low-carbon economy, while coping with an increasing energy
demand,16 is rapidly changing the way electricity is produced and consumed. The
electric sector is today undergoing fundamental changes, mainly due to the opportu-
nities, but also the challenges, relating to the increasing impact of distributed
generation.
The interaction between this huge number of new producers/consumers
(“prosumers”), randomly embedded into networks, requires a higher level of
“intelligence” for the power systems of the future. This appears crucial for
balancing the electric system, if we consider that the major part of DG is
from intermittent, nonprogrammable, and nondispatchable energy sources like
wind and sun.
Smart grids (SG) are an essential element in facilitating this transformation. The
smart grid is an electricity network that can intelligently integrate the actions of all
users connected to it—generators, consumers, and those that do both—in order to
efﬁciently deliver sustainable, economic, and secure electricity supplies (Figure 15.15).
A smart grid employs innovative ICT tools for communication, control, and self-
healing purposes, in order to:
• better facilitate the connection and operation of generators of all sizes and
technologies;
• make wide use of energy storage technologies to keep the power system in
balance even with increasing penetration of nonprogrammable renewable
energy sources (Figure 15.16);

• provide consumers with more information and options for choosing energy
providers;
• allow consumers to play a part in optimizing the operation of the system—for
example, reducing power spikes and shifting consumption to off-peak hours;
• signiﬁcantly reduce the environmental impact of the whole electricity supply
system;
• optimize the use of present assets, deferring new installations;
• maintain or improve the existing levels of system reliability, quality, and
security of supply, while operating resiliently against (cyber) attacks and natural
disasters;
• foster the development of integrated transnational markets and the interaction
between different infrastructures (electricity, gas, mobility, water, etc.).
To cope with increasing energy demand, SGs use more brain (i.e., a better use of the
existing assets), rather than more muscles (i.e., the installation of new generation and
transmission facilities).
The power systems of the future aspire to be more reliable, secure, economic,
environment-friendly and efﬁcient. Large-scale central generators will be joined by a
huge ﬂeet of small prosumers, thereby substituting the top-down approach shown in
Figure 15.9 (unidirectional power ﬂows going from bulk generation toward users)
with a more democratic network of resources, as depicted in Figure 15.17.
Smart grids will also enable active participation by small end-users (demand
response and demand side management). The grids will give consumers information,
control, and options that enable them to engage in new electricity and ancillary
markets. Distribution system operators will treat willing consumers as resources in the
day-to-day operation of the grid. Well-informed consumers will modify consumption
as they balance their demands and resources with the electric system’s capability of
meeting these demands.

RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND ENERGY STORAGE
It has been seen that new distribution grids and future smart grids take advantage of
renewable energy sources, and of energy storage.
To better understand these networks, in this section some information about these
components is provided.
15.9.1
Photovoltaic Plants
Photovoltaic (PV) cells directly convert the energy of solar radiation into DC
electricity. A typical silicon PV cell is composed of a thin wafer, consisting of an
ultra-thin layer of phosphorus-doped (N-type) silicon, on top of a thicker layer of
boron-doped (P-type) silicon; this is what is called a P–N junction. When sunlight
strikes the surface of the cell, the photons contained in the sun’s rays cause extra
electrons and holes to be generated above their normal equilibrium and an electrical
ﬁeld originates through the junction (photovoltaic effect). If the cell is connected to a
load, this potential gives rise to a ﬂow of current (electrons).
The performance of a solar cell is measured in terms of its efﬁciency in turning the
power of sunlight (around 1 kW/m2 at noon on a cloudless day at the equator) into
electricity. There are many kinds of photovoltaic cells. Monocrystalline cells use very
pure silicon, thus obtaining efﬁciencies of 17–20% (2013) at greater investment
expense; they give their best with direct solar radiation and perfect alignment with
solar rays. Polycrystalline silicon consists of multiple small crystals; efﬁciencies are
usually around 13–16% (2013); these cells are particularly appreciated for locations

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

with prevailing diffused solar radiation or when alignment with solar rays is not
perfect due to installation constraints. Thin-ﬁlm solar cells are obtained by depositing
one or more thin layers of photovoltaic material onto a substrate.17 These cells are the
newest and cheapest, their strongpoints being their ﬂexibility and their increasing
efﬁciencies; at present (2013), commercial modules operate at around 9%, but future
panels are expected to have performances similar to polycrystalline modules. The
efﬁciency of the ﬁrst solar cells, built in the 1950s, was lower than 4%.
Groups of 35–50 cells are electrically conﬁgured into modules (or “panels,”
usually ranging from 150 to 300 W) and these into arrays. Many arrays constitute a
solar ﬁeld (Figure 15.18). Using inverters, PV systems can produce AC electricity
compatible with any conventional appliances (islanded or “stand-alone” systems) or
inject their production into the distribution network with which they are in parallel
(grid-connected systems).
Although the photovoltaic effect was discovered by the French physicist Edmond
Becquerel as early as 1839, the ﬁrst photovoltaic cells were produced in the late 1950s
and throughout the 1960s were principally used to provide electrical power for
satellites. During the 1970s, improvements in the performance and quality of PV
modules helped to reduce costs and opened up a number of opportunities for powering
remote islanded applications, including battery charging for navigational aids,
signals, telecommunications equipment, and other critical, low power needs. Follow-
ing the energy crises of the same years, there were signiﬁcant efforts to increase the
use of renewable energies to substitute fossil fuels, thus improving the efﬁciency of
solar energy conversion and developing increasingly larger grid-connected PV
systems. These produce electricity for residential, industrial, and commercial uses
or simply inject electricity into the grid like a conventional power.
Nowadays, photovoltaic applications range from fractions of watts (consumer
electronic devices, including calculators, watches, radios, and other small battery
charging applications) to many megawatts (large grid-connected power plants).

(CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIS/CIGS), and organic photovoltaic cells (OPC).

Figure 15.19 shows the typical I–U characteristics of a photovoltaic cell, which are
strongly dependent on solar radiation and cells, in terms of both short-circuit current
(the current in the diagrams corresponding to zero voltage) and no-load voltage (the
voltage corresponding to zero current).
A PV array consists of several cells in series, to produce reasonably high DC
voltage. Voltages between 50 and 100 V are common. To interface the arrays with
an AC grid, it is thus necessary to ﬁrst raise the electricity produced then convert it
into AC.
The conventional structure of a grid-connected photovoltaic system is depicted in
Figure 15.20. The inverter can be operated by controlling the amplitude and the
displacement of the generated voltage with respect to the grid voltage, so as to handle
the active and reactive power injected into the network (see Section 8.3.3.1). It is usual
to operate at cos φ  1, that is, without exchange of reactive power with the external
grid; in this case, the inverter is controlled so as to obtain an AC current that is in phase
with the grid voltage; the amplitude of the AC current is instead controlled in order to
keep Udc2 constant, which corresponds to injecting exactly the active power coming
from the PV cells into the grid; the presence of the capacitor also reduces voltage
oscillations at the DC circuit section.
Assuming Udc2 to be perfectly regulated by the inverter, from the point of view of
the DC–DC converter it is a constant voltage source, while the panels can be
considered as a current source. Readers can easily recognise the typical structure
of a step-up DC–DC converter,18 with active power ﬂowing from left to right (see
Section 8.3.2): since Udc2 is pretty much ﬁxed, the converter’s conduction ratio entails
the voltage Udc1, hence the working point of the cells on the actual I–U characteristic.

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) algorithm is aimed at searching for the
conduction ratio that maximizes the active power provided by the cells, as far as
selecting the working point shown in the following ﬁgure. Since the actual I–U
characteristic is not known beforehand, this search is usually heuristic (“perturb and
observe” techniques), based on the maximization of the product of measured voltage
and current (Figure 15.21).
Single-axis or dual-axis trackers, able to slowly move panels to follow the sun’s
trajectory, are particularly effective in regions that receive a large amount of direct
radiation (production increased by 20–30%). In diffused light (i.e., under cloud or
fog), tracking has little or no value.
With respect to conventional power plants, photovoltaic systems are penalized by a
lower yearly kilowatt-hour production per installed kilowatt, which is usually in the
range of 800–1700 kWh/kW depending on the latitude. To promote the installation of
photovoltaic systems, state incentives are usually provided in the form of capital
support or tariff bonus, in addition to the normal remuneration of electricity. At lower
latitudes, the progressive decrease of installation costs per kilowatt makes the
investment cost-effective also in the absence of incentives (“grid parity”).

Wind Power Plants
The total wind power ﬂowing through an imaginary area A, perpendicular to wind
speed, is related to the kinetic energy of the air in motion:
Ptot  1
2 _mv2  1
2 ρAvv2  1
2 ρAv3
where _m is the mass ﬂow rate (kg/s), v is the wind speed, and ρ is the density of air.
Wind power is then proportional to the third power of the wind speed. The power
actually provided by a wind turbine is clearly lower:
Pw  Cp
1
2 ρAv3
where Cp is the so-called coefﬁcient of performance. According to theory, Cp cannot
be higher than 16/27 (0.5927, Betz limit); otherwise the wind speed behind the turbine
would be null. As depicted in Figure 15.22, for a given turbine, Cp is a function of the
pitch angle θ (which is null when the blades are vertical to the wind direction) and of
the tip-speed ratio λ:
λ  Ωr
v
where Ω is the turbine rotational speed and r is the radius of blades, hence Ωr equals
the tangential speed at the blade tip.
Empirically, the maximum Cp is obtained for θ ≅0° and λ  λmax ≅4π/n, where n
is the number of blades; in the speciﬁc case depicted in the previous ﬁgure, λmax ≈4.2,

but the function Cp(λ) is strongly dependent on the actual shape of blades. Optimal
performance is then achieved by operating the turbine always at point P, for any wind
speed: θ is kept constant at a very low value, while Ω is modiﬁed according to the
wind speed in order to maintain λ ≈λmax. If λmax is not known beforehand or the wind
speed cannot be measured, “perturb and observe” algorithms can be used in real time
to perform a heuristic search for the optimal rotational speed, in analogy with MPPT
procedures of photovoltaic plants.
If wind speed overtakes the so-called “rated speed” (12–15 m/s), the available
power Pw would exceed the design power of the turbine, Prated. The pitch-angle θ is
then intentionally increased so as to reduce Cp and curtail Pw. In Figure 15.23, observe
the cubic dependency of Pw on wind speed, below vrated. When wind speed exceeds
the “cut-off” value (usually around 25 m/s), the turbine is stopped for security reasons.
Conversely, under the “cut-on” wind speed (3–4 m/s) the turbine is not able to start up,
due to the very low value of Pw.
Three main schemes are currently in use:
Scheme A: Induction Machine, Directly Connected to the Grid.
In this scheme,
restricted to small-size turbines, the wind pushes a squirrel-cage induction machine
above its synchronous speed. As discussed in Chapter 12, the slip is negative and the
machine operates as a generator. According to Figure 12.8, the rotational speed is
practically constant for any value of the torque provided by the turbine (for generator
operation it is between Ω0 and ~Ω, but typically nearer to Ω0); for this reason, Ω cannot
be controlled to achieve the optimum Cp at all times and efﬁciency is jeopardized,
especially at low and high wind speeds.
Another disadvantage of this scheme is that the electrical machine always draws
reactive power from the grid, and shunt-connected capacitors are then required to
overcome the lagging power factor.
In very small turbines, the pitch-angle regulation is not available. In this case, Pw is
roughly limited to Prated, taking advantage of the torsional rigidity of blades, designed
to stall above vrated.

Scheme B: Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG).
As we saw in Chapter 12, in
a normal (“singly fed”) induction machine only the stator is fed, while the rotor is in
short-circuit; the frequency fr of electromagnetic forces and currents induced in the
rotor depends on stator frequency and on slip: fr  sf. The slip s, in turn, is deﬁned by
the balance between traction and load torques, as depicted in Figure 12.9. As
discussed in Example 1 of Chapter 12, fr determines the speed nrr of the rotor
magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the rotor itself: nrr  60fr/p, where p is the number of
pole pairs and nrr is measured in rpm. Whatever the mechanical load, the rotor and
stator magnetic ﬁelds are synchronous; therefore nrr  n  n0, where n is the rotor
speed and n0 is the speed of the stator rotating ﬁeld (synchronous speed, strictly ﬁxed
by the grid frequency and the number of pole pairs).
In a doubly fed wound-rotor induction machine, fr and consequently nrr are imposed
by an external electrical supply. Since the two magnetic ﬁelds must be synchronous, the
equation nrr  n  n0 remains valid: by setting fr, hence nrr, the operator can regulate the
rotor speed n, regardless of load conditions and stator frequency.
Let us assume n*rr and n* to be the values corresponding to the singly fed induction
generator in the present wind conditions, where n*rr is slightly lower than zero. If
nrr < n*rr < 0, then n is higher than n* and the doubly fed machine increases its speed.
If n*rr < nrr < 0, and even more so when nrr > 0 (currents injected into the rotor change
their sequence and the rotor ﬁeld reverses its sense of rotation with respect to the
rotor), then the machine slows down: n < n*.
The rotor winding is supplied through the slip-rings/brushes coupling already
described in Chapter 11 concerning additional rotor resistors and motor starting.
Brushes are usually supplied by power electronics, which allows fr to be set as desired
(Figure 15.24). Both converters are PWM devices (see Section 8.3.3). The generator-
side converter simply imposes voltages with desired fr to the rotor; the other converter
is operated in order to keep the DC-busbar at constant voltage.
When fr is set so that n > n*, the generator-side converter receives active power
through the rotor (usually 1
4  1
3 of the turbine’s mechanical power) and operates as a
rectiﬁer; the other converter must inject such power into the grid; hence it works as an
inverter, generating voltages always ahead of the grid reference (like a synchronous
generator; see Section 11.3.1).
Conversely, when n < n* the rotor winding draws active power from the generator-
side converter,whichoperatesasaninverter; theotherconverterdrawssuchpowerfrom
the grid, thus operating as a rectiﬁer (its voltages are lagging to the grid reference).

LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

The main advantage of this scheme is that turbine speed can be regulated at will in a
typical range of ±30 percent around the synchronous speed, thus achieving the
maximum Cp for many wind conditions.19 Furthermore, by controlling the amplitude
of the currents injected into the rotor windings, it is possible to regulate the reactive
power absorbed or provided by the generator, exactly as in a synchronous machine;
this should not surprise readers, since a synchronous machine can be thought of as a
particular doubly fed induction machine, where the rotor is DC-supplied (fr  nrr  0).
The only drawback of this scheme with respect to the squirrel-cage machine is that
slip-rings and brushes require maintenance and can reduce machine reliability.
Scheme C: Power Electronics Connected Generator.
In this case, a permanent-
magnet synchronous generator is connected to the network through a power elec-
tronics interface (Figure 15.25).
The grid-side converter is a PWM inverter. The converter provides voltages whose
amplitude and phase are both controllable at will; they determine the reactive and
active power exchanged with the external network, exactly like a conventional
synchronous generator. In particular, their amplitude can be varied at will, according
to a desired power factor (leading or lagging). Their phase is instead regulated so as to
maintain Udc constant, thus injecting into the grid all the active power coming from
the generator; this phase control also makes sure that the inverter follows the grid
frequency, however much it varies.
Also the generator-side converter is a PWM device, but in this case it operates as a
rectiﬁer: the active power ﬂows from the AC to the DC side. The frequency f1 of the
voltages imposed by the converter at the machine terminals determines the rotational
speed of the synchronous generator: The electrical machine simply operates as if it
were in parallel to a (frequency-varying) network, its electromotive forces being
pushed by the prime mover always ahead of the converter’s voltages. Since the turbine
speed can be set at will by changing f1, the maximum Cp is achieved in a very wide
wind-speed range.
Schemes (a) and (b) require gearing mechanisms that adapt the slow turbine speed
with the high synchronous speed of the generator; for practical reasons, in fact, the
number of magnetic poles of the electrical machine cannot exceed 4–6. The gear box

affects both the efﬁciency and reliability of the plant. In scheme C, f1 can be low at will
and the gear box is not required.
The only drawback of this scheme with respect to the DFIG is that the converter
must be sized for the entire nominal power of the turbine, which in the past limited the
maximum power rating of scheme (c), due to economic and technical reasons.
15.9.3
Energy Storage
It was seen in Section 15.6 that electricity cannot be directly stored, and therefore
generation (meaning the sum of all the electric powers delivered by generators) and
load (i.e., the sum of powers absorbed by all the individual loads) must be kept in
perfect balance. The situation is depicted in Figure 15.26a.
This is a very simpliﬁed scheme of a large power system. The system involves
some components that generate power (gen 1 to gen n) and others that absorb power
(load 1 to load m).
In fact, the sum of the powers delivered by the generators must equal the power
absorbed by the loads. The black lines between generators and loads represent ideal

lines (which therefore neither absorb nor deliver energy) linking all the components
to a virtual common node, which summarizes and represents the transmission
and distribution grid. This is what is called a “single-busbar model” of the power
system.
The transverse arrow, which in diagrams in general indicates the adjustability,
here shows that the power produced by the corresponding generators can be suitably
varied to meet system needs. When this happens, the generators are said to be
dispatchable.
In Figure 15.26a all the generators are dispatchable. However, it often happens that
we are not able to, or do not want to, modify the power some of the generators
produce. This is often the case of electric generators fed by renewable energy sources:
whenever sun or wind is available, we want to convert the whole power they are able
to produce into electricity; otherwise it is lost forever. These generators are called
nondispatchable, and they are shown in the ﬁgure without transverse arrows. As
discussed in Section 15.6, power dispatching involves both short-term generation
scheduling and real-time operation of power plants.
On the other hand, we usually want to give loads the freedom to vary at will (within
given technical or commercial limits). For instance, in households we can turn lights,
heaters, and machines on or off at will, with the only limitation that the maximum
allotted power must not be overcome.
In this framework, any load variation is promptly compensated for by an equal
variation of generation only from dispatchable generators (Figure 15.26b). The others
continue to produce all the power coming from their source. This might cause the
dispatchable generators to be called to operate in low-efﬁciency regions. Indeed a
power plant will have lower efﬁciency when it is called to operate loads which are too
low or when the variation of the required power over time is too fast.
It might even happen that the variability of nondispatchable generation and/or
loads is too much or too fast to be compensated for by dispatchable generators. In
these cases, if the network arrangement is the one shown in Figure 15.26b, it might
happen that we are forced to shed some loads or some generators from the grid, in
order to keep the power system in balance.
The situation can be improved by resorting to the scheme depicted in
Figure 15.26c, in which one or more energy storage systems are added to the
network, like the ones indicated in the ﬁgure as sto 1 to sto s. These systems can
be physically placed near generators or loads, or far from both. The effects of their
position, indeed, are not very signiﬁcant for the purposes of system balancing and can
be neglected for our purposes.
A storage system is normally thought of as a system which is able to store electric
energy. Indeed it does something different: it converts energy into a form that can be
stored when it is absorbing power and then converts it back into electricity, when it is
delivering power.
Typical storage systems are:
• Hydraulic Reservoirs. In this case, when electric power must be absorbed,
water is moved by electric pumps from a lower location to a higher one, so
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND ENERGY STORAGE
495

electricity is converted into the gravitational potential energy of water (pumping
operation). When the plant is required to deliver power, water is released by the
upper location and sent to the lower one, and the potential energy is converted
into kinetic energy by a turbine that in turn moves an alternator, thus generating
electricity (turbine operation). The round-cycle efﬁciency of a hydraulic reser-
voir might be in the range 70–85%. In some cases, pumping and turbine
operations are performed using the same, reversible hydraulic machine, and in
others they are performed by employing a pump and a turbine.
• Electrochemical Batteries. Batteries used in electric systems are very similar to
the batteries commonly used in everyday life, like the batteries of our cars,
laptop computers, or mobile phones. When they are required to store energy,
electrochemical batteries convert energy into potential chemical energy. This
potential energy can be converted back into electricity when the grid needs
power (and energy). The round-cycle efﬁciency of modern electrochemical
batteries is around 90%.
• Other Systems. A lot of other possibilities are potentially usable, and sometimes
actually used, as energy storage systems. Energy can be stored as kinetic energy
into ﬂywheels, into potential energy of compressed air, and even into the
magnetic energy of very large inductors, operating at extremely low tempera-
tures, so that superconductivity is exploited.20 These other systems are,
however, much rarer than hydraulic or electrochemical energy reservoirs
and will therefore not be dealt with hereafter.
In order to operate, hydraulic reservoirs require a special land conformation: there
must be a lower and higher basin, and space to allocate pumps, turbines and electric
machines. Therefore these reservoirs are typically very large, allowing energy storage
of at least several tens or hundreds of megawatt-hours, and can even be in the range of
gigawatt-hours.
On the other hand, electrochemical batteries can be very small, and therefore they
are more adequate for distributed, small storage systems. That’s why they are
becoming more and more important in modern distribution grids—that is, grids
with distributed generation and smart grids. Battery energy storage systems used in
power systems can range from 1 kWh to a few tens of megawatt-hours.
The building block of a battery energy storage is the electrochemical reversible
cell. Cells can be produced using different technologies. Here we list the two most
important ones.
• Lead-Acid Cells. These are based on chemical reactions that take advantage of
the speciﬁc electrochemical properties of lead. Lead-acid cells are very widely
20Superconductivity is a special mode of operation of some conductors that occurs at very low temperatures.
In these conditions the electric resistance of the material is practically null, and therefore current can
virtually ﬂow in a superconductive material for an indeﬁnite time. For instance, mercury becomes
superconductive at a temperature of around 6 K. Storage systems based on superconductivity are called
superconductive magnetic energy storage systems (SMES).
496
LARGE POWER SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE AND OPERATION

used in engineering applications. For instance, they are the source of energy
of nearly all cars in the world, when the internal-combustion engine is off.
They are a mature and cheap technology. For distributed generation systems,
however, they are not so attractive, since the number of charge/discharge
cycles allowed (before the battery reaches its end-of-life) is relatively low:
typically 500 cycles.
• Lithium-Based Cells. These are based on chemical reactions that take advan-
tage of the speciﬁc electrochemical properties of lithium. Lithium cells are very
widely used in engineering applications, speciﬁcally in consumer electronics:
nearly all of today’s mobile phones, tablets, and laptop computers are fed by
lithium-based cells. Cells of consumer electronics devices contain very small
amounts of energy compared to power system needs. Today there is a fast-
growing offer of larger lithium-based cells, for stationary and vehicular
applications. However, their technology is less mature than lead-acid batteries,
and their cost per unit of stored energy is higher. Nevertheless, they are the most
important technology for new applications, because of their fast-growing
competitiveness and also because their cycle life ( life measured in cycles)
is much larger than lead-acid’s: typically 5000 cycles. Lithium cells are not of
one single type. At the time of this writing (fall 2013), the most common types
are NCA (nickel–cobalt–aluminium), NMC (nickel–manganese–cobalt), LMO
(lithium–manganese oxide), LTO (lithium–titanate oxide), and LFP (lithium-
iron phosphate), but the situation might change in the coming years.
Cells are characterized mainly by their nominal capacity, usually expressed in Ah.
This represents the electric charge the considered cell can deliver under speciﬁc
testing conditions. When discharged at currents which are different from the nominal
current, the delivered charge varies.
For instance, when delivering a constant current of 5 A, a cell having Cn  50 Ah
(measured using a 10-A constant discharge current), will be totally discharged after
more than 10 hours.
When discharged at currents which are higher than the nominal current, the charge the
cell is able to deliver reduces. The amount of reduction depends on the type of cell.
A typical “power–oriented” lithium cell21 that delivers 50 Ah when discharged at 5 A
might deliver something around 45 Ah when discharged at 10 A. The delivered charge of
lead-acid batteries is much more highly dependent on the discharge current.
Although batteries are designated by their nominal capacity (in Ah), the user is mainly
interested in the energy the cell can deliver.
21When a cell is “power-oriented,” it is designed for large discharge currents (and relatively low discharge
times, say a few minutes or tens of minutes, even though longer discharge times are always possible).
“Energy-oriented” cells do their best when discharged at smaller currents—that is, with discharge times of at
least one hour.
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND ENERGY STORAGE
497

Conversion from capacity to energy is easy when constant current discharge is
involved. When cells are discharged at constant current (Figure 15.27), their voltage
continuously reduces, with a slope which is initially quite constant. Toward the end of
discharge the voltage reaches a “knee,” and then decreases rapidly. The cell is
considered to be discharged when its end-of-discharge voltage Ueod is reached.
The energy the cell delivers during discharge can be computed as follows:
Edisch  ∫Td
UtIt dt  I∫Td
Ut dt  QUavg
with
Q  ITd and Uavg  1
Td ∫Td
Ut dt
Therefore Edisch is the delivered charge times that average voltage.
For instance, a typical lead-acid battery with C  50 Ah, when discharged rather slowly,
shows an average discharge voltage of 2 V per cell, thus delivering 50 ? 2  100 Wh.
A typical lithium NMC cell, when discharged in approximately one hour, might have an
average discharge voltage of 3.9 V and, therefore, a 50-Ah cell might deliver 195 Wh.
The energy and power available from a single cell are not adequate for power system
applications. Normally, several cells in series are used. Depending on the case, the
number of cells in series can be very large (even several hundred cells in series!).
In some cases, cells in parallel are also considered. A battery is a set of several
cells, in either series or series/parallel combinations. Naturally, the energy of a battery
composed of all equal cells is equal to the energy stored in a single cell, multiplied by
the total number of cells.

Consider a battery composed of m parallel rows, each composed in turn of n cells in
series. The whole battery has nm cells. The following formulas apply (“batt” stands
for battery):
Qrow  Qcell;

Ebatt  mErow  mUavg;row?I  mUbatt;row?I

In these formulas we disregarded the effects of connections between cells to create rows
and batteries. Indeed, since the connection cables have a ﬁnite resistance, when the
battery is discharged it converts a very small quantity of energy into loss (heat), which is
not transferred to the load. Therefore, the battery energy is slightly smaller than nmEcell.

through circuits, which required us to neglect (a) conduction and displacement
currents through wires and (b) EMF induced by the effects of Faraday’s law in
the circuital systems space between wires.
There are cases, however, in which these cannot be neglected. The most important
is the example of very long high-voltage power lines that transmit power over a
distance of many kilometres, for which the cumulative effects of displacement
currents between conductors and of the self-induced voltages can be signiﬁcant in
line operation.
In other cases, such as medium-voltage lines, it could be advisable to take into
account the effects of self-induction while still neglecting displacement currents
between conductors.
In this appendix we show that if self-induction cannot be disregarded, the very
concept of circuit becomes loose, and special constraints must be introduced to
continue to use the usual circuit analysis techniques, and in particular Kirchhoff’s
laws.
We do this by taking as reference a two-wire transmission line, the most important
case for theoretical and practical reasons.

A.1.1
Issues and Solutions When Displacement Currents are Neglected
Consider the physical system depicted in Figure A.1a, for which we postulate that it is
possible to build a voltage source—that is, a device able to generate a time-varying
voltage—on its left side. This is known to be true from common engineering practice,
and it should be part of the student’s previous knowledge.
The remainder of the circuit is constituted by a two-conductor line (let these
conductors be two copper cylinders), connecting the voltage source with the load
which is another cylindrical conductor possibly made of a different conducting
material whose resistivity is higher than that of the line.
Although simple, this is a distributed-parameter physical system, governed by
electromagnetics equations. Can this system be modelled by a circuit of the type
shown in Figures A.1b and A.1c, where the four conductive circuit elements are
substituted by branches?
If we look now at Figure A.1b, terminals are set exactly at the borders of lumped
components and are connected to each other by ideal wires, as graphically shown. Once
this is clear, the terminal representation is normally omitted, and the circuit is written as
in Figure A.1c, where terminals are not shown and no distinction is made between the
points of ideal wires, since all these points share the same current and the same potential.
The time variability of electrical quantities changes things radically with respect to
the DC case:
• Faraday’s law applies and must be taken into account.
• Current ﬂows not only within wires, but also between the upper and lower wire.
In fact, the two wires, along with the insulating material between them, behave

as a capacitor, the dielectric being the insulating material. Therefore there are
displacement currents between them.
The practical experience of electrical engineers has highlighted the fact that it is
possible to analyse transmission lines which are not very long (i.e., no longer than 50–
80 km), operating at 50 or 60 Hz, while neglecting the effects of conduction and
displacement currents between the wires.
For now, then, we will disregard the effects of these wire-to-wire currents; they will
be considered at a later stage. As a consequence of this hypothesis, the current ﬂowing
inside the wires remains the same, from left-end terminals to right-end ones.
The ﬁrst question to answer for the circuital system of Figure A.1a, is whether it is
possible to deﬁne a potential function at the four terminals t0, t1, t2, and t3, if self-
induction EMF cannot be neglected. If the answer is yes, KVL applies and a circuit
can be used to effectively model the system. The existence of a potential function for
the circuital system of Figure A.1a is equivalent to stating that the voltage across two
of the terminals does not depend on the path used for measuring it. Therefore, we can
imagine installing an ideal voltmeter in the circuital system and evaluating whether
the voltmeter reading depends on its position.
A voltmeter is a device which is able to show the difference of potential at the two points
of the circuital system to which it is connected. An ideal voltmeter is a device that draws
no current (or an inﬁnitesimal current) when it is inserted into the circuit and therefore its
insertion does not alter the previous equilibrium of the system.
Consider the two ideal voltmeters V1, and V2, and the corresponding measuring
wires depicted in Figure A.2. Because the voltmeters are ideal, the currents ﬂowing
in the wires connecting t1 and t2 with the voltmeters are negligible with respect to the

main circuit current i(t). The following equations can be written, combining Faraday’s
law and Ohm’s law for the shaded areas A1, and A2:
A1 : u1t  R12it  d
dt ψA1t
A2 : u2t  R12it  d
dt ψA2t
(A.1)
where
• R12 is the resistance of the system’s upper wire between t1 and t2.
• ψA1, ψA2 ﬂuxes are linked with surfaces of areas A1 and A2, respectively.
Undoubtedly, voltages u1 and u2 measured by voltmeters V1 and V2, respectively,
are different from each other, because the two ﬂux linkages ψA1 and ψA2 are different,
being caused by the same electric ﬁeld due to i(t) but integrated in two different areas
A1 and A2  A1.
Therefore, since the quantity measured as voltage between two points depends on
the path in which we install the voltmeters, it is impossible to deﬁne the potentials of
terminals t1 and t2. Since the existence of potential in all the connection points
(element terminals) implies the applicability of the KVL and vice versa, KVL itself
cannot be applied in the standard way, and therefore no standard circuit can be created
for the system containing the transmission line. These results can be repeated
whenever it is not deemed possible in a circuital system to neglect self-induction
EMFs in the space between the wires that connect the components of the system
component. The following can thus be stated:
Result: Circuit modelling of transmission lines
In a circuital system, when the self-induction electromotive force cannot be
neglected in the meshes created by lines connecting devices, a potential function
of all the points of the system cannot be deﬁned, and therefore no standard circuit
can be deﬁned to model the system.
A system containing a long transmission line, however, in which the length is
much greater than the distance between the conductors, can be analysed.
Consider Fig. A.3, in which Ll  Hl. In this case, the following equations can be
written as

where Rc is the sum of upper and lower conductor resistance.

Since it is assumed L  H, it can also be said that A1  A0 and A2  A0, and
therefore the ﬂux ψA0  A1 linked with area A0  A1 and the ﬂux ψA0  A1 linked with
A0  A2 can be assumed to be equal to each other, as follows:

where L is the self-inductance coefﬁcient of the line and is related to the area A0.
The two equations (A.2) can therefore be collapsed into a single equation:

(A.3)
Equation (A.3) can be the equation describing the electrical behaviour of the
metacircuit1 shown in Figure A.4.
The word “metacircuit” and the dashed lines indicate that this is not a true circuit
since it cannot be used to compute voltage differences between a terminal existing at
the sending end of the transmission line and one existing at the receiving end, but only
voltage differences between terminals at the same end of the line. This metacircuit
concept, though important, is usually ignored in circuit and electrical engineering
textbooks.
Nevertheless, any electrical engineer knows that when long transmission lines are
involved, it is not correct to evaluate voltage differences between terminals situated at
two opposite ends of the line. To our knowledge, a rational analysis of why this

since not all potential differences between terminals have physical meaning and can be computed.

happens has not been previously published, at least in the more widespread literature;
the contribution of this appendix is thus signiﬁcant.
In the next section the analysis is repeated while also taking displacement currents
into account.
A.1.2
Steady-State Analysis Considering Displacement Currents
Consider again a two-wire transmission line (Figure A.5), this time taking into account
the displacement current. Consider in particular a single line segment of length dx
(the shaded area in the ﬁgure).
This segment will have an inﬁnitesimal inductance dL  L0dx if L0 indicates the
inductance per unit length, and it will have an inﬁnitesimal resistance dR  R0dx if R0
indicates the resistance per unit length.

Z  B;

It is easy to verify that equations (A.6) are valid for both circuits. However, it would
be erroneous to state that the circuits in Figure A.6 are “steady-state equivalents” of
the transmission line: those circuits, indeed, are branch-based circuits and, as such,
allow the determination of quantities such as voltage U AC, something which is
impossible (because it has no physical meaning) through the equations of the
physical line.
Therefore, the obtained steady-state line model can again (see Section A.1.1) be
better represented graphically using the metacircuit concept (Figure A.7)

More in Depth: Line models with circuits containing 1:1 transformers
One could be tempted to avoid the introduction of the metacircuit concept for
transmission lines operating in steady state and instead introduce a 1:1 ideal
transformer at the beginning or the end of the models as shown in the case of the PI
line model in the upper part of the diagram below.
This, however, would be tricky and is better avoided, since the use of this line
equivalent would not prevent cross-impedances being added, such as the Znew
shown in the lower part of the diagram below. This is indeed erroneous because
analysis of this network using Kirchhoff’s equations would lead to results that do
not correspond to the system physics.

Practical Considerations
For low-voltage and medium-voltage lines (up to 35 kV nominal), considering the
actual parameters (inductances per unit length and capacitances per unit length) and
the limited lengths, the admittances Y can be neglected and the line can be
represented by a metacircuit containing only the longitudinal impedance Z or
Z 1  Z 2.
Moreover, for low-voltage lines (1 kV nominal and below), for conductor sections
up to 95 mm2, the longitudinal reactance can also be neglected with respect to the
resistance. For those lines, by and large the most common in domestic and civil
environments, lines are modelled just by an equivalent resistor.
MODELLING TRANSMISSION LINES THROUGH CIRCUITS
509

A more formal approach showing how to use modiﬁed circuits in steady state to
analyse systems in which displacement currents between wires and self-induction
voltages cannot be neglected is illustrated in the next section.
In high-voltage lines and very high voltage lines (e.g., in the range 132–800 kV) the Y
component of the model can be neglected only for short line trunks, usually up to 100 km.
A.2
MODELLING LINES AS TWO-PORT COMPONENTS
A.2.1
Port-Based Circuits
In the previous section it was shown that transmission lines, which are very important
and frequently used components, do not ﬁt easily with the circuit concept used in this
book (and introduced in Chapter 3) in either their general or branch-based form. This
is mainly because, differently from circuits, the mathematical line model should
reﬂect the fact that a voltage across two terminals at the sending end and receiving end
of the line is undeﬁned. Therefore, so as not to miss out on the considerable
advantages of the circuit-based technique in analysing physical systems with a
circuital nature (devices connected by wires), a new deﬁnition of circuits must be
introduced.
Consider the components shown in Figure A.8.
Consider ﬁrst the upper part of the ﬁgure. The 4-terminal component of
Figure A.8a, by its very constitution, places constraints on the terminal’s electrical
voltages and currents. The independent voltages (differences between terminal
potentials) and currents amount to six quantities, since the fourth current is
determined by Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), and all potential differences can
be determined as differences between the three potentials between terminals 1 to 3
and terminal 0.
The component shown in Figure A.8b still has four terminals, but these are
grouped into two ports. Something similar happens with Figures A.8c and A.8a,
where more terminals are involved, and each port contains m terminals instead of two.
The deﬁnition of the two-portm component outlined here is as follows3:
A two-portm component is an n-terminal component with the following special
features:
1. The n terminals, which must be even in number, are grouped into two groups of
m  n/2 terminals, called ports.
2. It is postulated that the sum of all currents entering any port is always zero.
3. When the two-port component is inserted into a circuit, the circuit must never be
used to determine voltage differences between potentials of terminals belong-
ing to different ports, since they are meaningless.
3This is a more structured deﬁnition of two-port components that can be found in textbooks (see Chapter 19
of [bc2]). The expression two-portm component is equivalent to “component with two m-terminal ports”.
510
APPENDIX: TRANSMISSION LINE MODELLING AND PORT-BASED CIRCUITS

Items 2 and 3 mean that KCL and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) must be valid
separately for each port (and each circuit section connected to that port) but not for the
circuit as a whole.
A.2.2
Port-Based Circuit and Transmission Lines
The two-port2 component is a suitable tool for modelling a circuit containing a
transmission line such as the one depicted in Figure A.5.
When subsystems are connected to the left end and right end of the line, the whole
system can be modelled by connecting the branch-based circuit modelling the left-
hand subsystem on the left, the two-port2 component modelling the line, and a branch-
based circuit modelling the right-hand subsystem on the right.
The situation is summarized in Figure A.9. The circuital system containing the line
is recalled in Figure A.9a for simplicity considering very simple subsystems at the left
and right end of the line.
The line can be effectively modelled as a two-port2 component as in Figure A.9b.
Should conductive and displacement currents between the wires be disregarded, the
two-port component behaviour is described by the single equation in Figure A.9c,
while in the more general case in which these currents between wires are taken into
consideration, in steady state, the line is described by a two-port component with the
equations in Figure A.9d. The values of A; B; C; D are those immediately given below
equation (A.6).
Figures A.9e and A.9f show the metacircuit counterparts of the port-based
representations of Figures A.9c and A.9d. The metacircuit approach is equivalent

to the port-based one, but port-based components are more usually represented by
their equations, rather than by circuit-like drawings.
In normal engineering usage, these curved–dashed lines are omitted. Normally this
does not create problems, since the engineer retains a visual memory of them and will
avoid the mistake of evaluating cross voltages between the ports, even when they are
not explicitly shown.
A.2.3
A Sample Application
Transmission lines are used largely to transmit electric power at distances that range
from some metres (household installations) to hundreds of kilometres (high-voltage
three-phase transmission lines).
A signiﬁcant example of a three-phase transmission system is shown in
Figure A.10. It is composed of a generator (electric machine that generates electric
power from mechanical power), some transformers, two three-phase electric lines,
composed of three wires (e.g., the overhead conductors of high voltage lines) and the
ground below them, and, ﬁnally, the distribution network, which acts as a load for the
rest of the system shown.
In the ﬁgure, transformer 1 transfers electrical energy from the medium-voltage
level to the high-voltage level and transformer 2 does the opposite.

APPENDIX: TRANSMISSION LINE MODELLING AND PORT-BASED CIRCUITS

As usual in power system analysis, only a one-wire equivalent is shown. Indeed all
apparatuses shown (generator, transformer, etc.) have four-terminal ports: the three
phases plus an additional terminal which is normally connected to the ground.
Consequently, the power system depicted in Figure A.10 can be represented as in
Figure A.11.
The different apparatuses are either 4-terminal components (generator, distribution
network), or two-port4 components (lines, transformers).
The behaviour of each apparatus is described by its constitutive equation, similar to
those given for the two-wire transmission line in Figure A.9, but more complex
because of the higher number of terminals per port.
The connections between the port-based components shown in Figure A.10
indicate the equality of voltage of terminals connected to each other, as well as
the equality of the current in the shown wires, paying attention to their signs.
This representation does not allow evaluation of the voltage difference between
terminals belonging to two different ports of any two-port components, for example,
U12  Up1  Up2. This does not create limitations in the applications, because ports 1
and 2, and therefore the terminals p1 and p2, might be as much as several hundred
kilometres from each other.

FINAL COMMENTS
This appendix has described a way to model transmission lines in circuit analysis even
in cases in which it is not possible to neglect self-induced voltages (Faraday’s law)
and/or displacement currents between wires.
The approach outlined here is useful, and commonly adopted, in the analysis of
very high voltage transmission networks.

The analysis presented in this appendix, however, gives only basic information
geared to making the problem and the approach clear to students, but it is not
sufﬁciently in-depth to give them adequate know-how for dealing with three-phase
transmission systems containing long lines in a quantitative way.
