Second Law of Thermodynamics
6	 Second Law of Thermodynamics
Learning objectives:
1.	 First Law is a Law of conservation of Energy. Satisfying the I Law, however, does not 
necessarily ensure that the process will actually occur.
2.	 Second Law dictates the direction in which the process will occur.
3.	 Only when both the I Law and II law are satisfied, will the process actually take place.
4.	 First, concepts of Thermal reservoir, Heat Engine, Refrigerator and Heat Pump and their 
efficiency / coefficient of performance (COP) are explained.
5.	 Then, two important statements of II Law, viz. Kelvin – Plank statement and Clausius 
statement are given; Clausius inequality is also mentioned.
6.	 Reversible and irreversible processes, Carnot cycle, its efficiency etc are explained next.
6.1	
Definitions, Statements and Formulas used [1,2,4]:
1.	 A Thermal reservoir can absorb or reject finite amounts of heat isothermally.
2.	 Work can be converted to heat directly, but heat can be converted to work only by a device 
called ‘heat engine’.
3.	 Source is a high temperature reservoir from which engine receives heat.
4.	 Sink is a low temperature reservoir to which the engine rejects heat.
5.	 Heat engine is a cyclically operating device which receives heat from a ‘source’ and rejects 
heat to a ‘sink’ and produces ‘net work’.
6.	 Refrigerator, whose objective is to produce low temperature, is a cyclically operating device 
which absorbs heat from a low temp body and rejects heat to a high temp body and work is 
required to be done on this device. Generally, atmosphere is the high temp reservoir.
7.	 Heat Pump, whose objective is to reject heat to a high temp reservoir, is a cyclically 
operating device which absorbs heat from a low temp body and rejects heat to a high temp 
body and work is required to be done on this device. Generally, atmosphere is the low 
temp reservoir.
8.	 Schematic diagrams of Heat Engine, Refrigerator and Heat Pump are shown below:

9.	 Kelvin – Planck statement of II Law: No heat engine can produce a net amount of work 
while exchanging heat with a single reservoir only.
10.	Clausius statement of II Law: No device can transfer heat from a cooler body to a warmer 
one without leaving an effect on the surroundings.
11.	Any device which violates the first or the second Law is called a perpetual motion machine.
12.	Efficiency of a Heat Engine:
	
13.	Coefficient of Performance (COP) of a Refrigerator:
	
14.	COP of a Heat Pump:

Second Law of Thermodynamics
15.	A process is said to be reversible if both the system and the surroundings can be restored to 
their original conditions. Any other process is irreversible.
16.	Effects such as friction, non-quasi-equilibrium expansion or compression, and heat transfer 
through a finite temp difference render a process irreversible.
17.	Carnot cycle is a reversible cycle consisting of four reversible processes, two isothermal and 
two adiabatic.
18.	A Carnot Engine is a hypothetical device and is not practical, since it consists of reversible 
processes which have to proceed at very slow rate without any temp and pressure differences.
19.	However, Carnot Engine serves as a standard to compare the performance of any other engine.
20.	The Carnot Principles state that (i) thermal efficiencies of all reversible heat engines 
operating between the same two reservoirs are the same, and (ii) no heat engine is more 
efficient than a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs.
21.	These principles form the basis for establishing a thermodynamic temperature scale.
22.	Thus, efficiency of a Carnot engine and COPs of Carnot refrigerator and Carnot Heat 
Pump are:

23.	Clausius Inequality: is useful when you have to analyze many other processes in addition to 
Engines, Refrigerators and Heat Pumps. This is another way of stating II Law. It is stated as:

Out is +ve)

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Entropy
7	 Entropy
Learning objectives:
1.	 First Law leads to a property, ‘energy’ and the Second Law leads to another property called 
‘entropy’.
2.	 Entropy, being an ‘abstract’ concept, is better studied by seeing how it is applied in the 
analysis of commonly encountered processes.
3.	 Rather than absolute value of entropy, ‘entropy change’ is of practical use and we study 
entropy changes for various processes involving pure substances, incompressible substances 
and ideal gases.
4.	 Application of entropy principle in analyzing some practically important cases are studied.
5.	 ‘Entropy balance’ for various systems is studied.
6.	 Above topics are illustrated by solving several problems.
7.1	
Definitions, Statements and Formulas used [1,2,4]:
1.	 Remember: we had the Clausius Inequality for a cycle:
Considering the usual sign conventions for Heat and Work, (i.e. Heat going In is +ve, Work going 
Out is +ve)
σ ܳ
ܶ= 0 ……for a Reversible engine (Carnot Engine) 	 ……eqn. 6.7
σ ܳ
ܶ< 0 ……for an Irreversible engine 	
	
……eqn. 6.8
If σ ܳ
ܶ> 0 ……It is an Impossible engine 	
	
……eqn. 6.9
2.	 Clausius defined entropy as:
Entropy is an extensive property. Entropy per unit mass, ‘s’ is an intensive property.
3.	 ‘Entropy change’ for a process is defined by:

Entropy
4.	 For an Isothermal process:
5.	 ‘Increase of Entropy’ principle:
In the above, equality sign holds for an internally reversible process, and the inequality for an irreversible 
process.
i.e. entropy change for an irreversible process is greater than the integral of (dQ/T) evaluated for that 
process. Note that T is the absolute temp at the boundary where dQ is transferred between the system 
and the surroundings.
Integral of (dQ/T) represents ‘entropy transfer’ with heat.
Note that in an irreversible process, for a closed system, entropy change is greater than the entropy transfer. 
i.e. there is some ‘entropy generation’, Sgen in an irreversible process.

Entropy
We write this as:
Also, for an ‘isolated system’, above equation reduces to:
i.e. Entropy of an isolated system during a process always increases or, in the limiting case of a 
reversible process, remains constant. It never decreases.
6. Viewing the System and its Surroundings as two sub-systems of an isolated system, we write:
Thus,
‘Entropy generation’ is a measure of irreversibilities present in a process.
6.	 Entropy change of ‘pure substances’:
Ex: Steam/Water. Steam Tables give the values of properties. Also, see Chapter 2 of Part-I to see the use 
of different software to get all the properties, including entropy.
Note that in Steam Tables, entropy of sat. liquid, sf at 0.01 C is taken as zero. For R-134a, sf of sat. liq. is 
taken as zero at -40 C. Entropy values are therefore, -ve below these reference values.
In the sat. mixture region, entropy is determined as:
where x is the quality.

For a closed system containing simple, compressible substance:
For unit mass:
Eqn. 7.9 is known as the first Tds eqn, or Gibbs eqn.
Eqn. 7.10 is known as second Tds eqn.
Now, entropy changes during a process for a simple compressible system can be obtained by 
integrating the following equations:

Liquids and solids are taken as incompressible. i.e. dv = 0. Therefore, eqn. 7.11 reduces to:

Then, entropy change, for liquids/solids is:
For an isentropic process (for a liquid/solid), we have: (s2-s1) = 0, i.e. T2 = T1, i.e. for liquids/solids, an 
isentropic process is also an isothermal process.
9.	 Entropy changes for ideal gases:
For an Ideal gas: du = cv . dT and P = R.T/v. Substituting in eqn. 7.11, we get:

Entropy
For a general steady flow process, it simplifies to:
Note:
ΔSsystem = Sfinal – Sinitial = S2 – S1, since entropy is a property and does not change unless the state of the 
system changes.
Entropy transfer:
1. By heat transfer: Sheat = Q/T
(No entropy transfer by Work. i.e. Swork = 0)
2. Mass flow: Smass = m.s
Entropy generation:
Sin - Sout + Sgen = ǻSsystem .... kJ/K
And, for a reversible process, entropy generation is zero.
13.	Available and Unavailable energy:
Note that according to the Second Law, all the energy supplied to a heat engine can not be converted in 
to work; part of the energy must be rejected to a sink.
Available energy is that portion of the energy supplied as heat which can be converted in to work by 
a reversible engine.
Unavailable energy is that portion of the energy supplied as heat which can not be converted in to work 
by a reversible engine.

ii)	 For a reversible engine absorbing heat from a finite body (not an infinite source), and 
rejecting heat to a sink at T0, we have:
In this case, Available energy = Q – T0.Δs, 
where T0 is the ambient temp and Δs is the entropy change of Source.
iii)	 When Q is transferred as heat from a body at temp T1 to a body at temp T2, the loss in 
available energy is equal to the difference in the available energy at T1 and the available 
energy at T2.
i.e. Loss in available energy = Q. (1 – T0/T1) – Q. (1 – T0/T2)
= T0. (Q/T2 – Q.T1) 
= T0. ΔSu
In the above, ΔSu denotes entropy change of the universe.
If there is any irreversibility in heat transfer, ΔSu > 0 and there is a loss in available energy.
So, all spontaneous processes are associated with a loss in available energy.

“Prob.7.1. An inventor claims that his engine has the following specifications: Power developed = 76 
kW, Fuel burnt per hr = 4 kg, heating value of fuel = 75000 kJ/kg, Temp limits: 727 C and 27 C. Discuss 
the possibility of the claim. [VTU-Aug.-Sept. 2000]”
EES Solution:
"Data:"
T1=(727+273) "K"
T2=(27+273) "K"
W=76*3600 "kJ/h"
m_fuel=4 "kg/h"
CV=75000 "kJ/kg"
"Calculations:"
Q1=m_fuel*CV "kJ/h"
eta_carnot=1-T2/T1
eta_actual=W/Q1
Results:
Thus:
eta_actual = 0.912, eta_carnot = 0.7
i.e. eta_actual > eta_carnot. This is not possible, as per II Law.
Therefore, the claim of the inventor is not feasible …. Ans.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Entropy
Results:
We see that the entropy change of fluid = -0.04697 kJ/kg.K
And entropy change of surroundings = 0, since the pipe is insulated.
Therefore: entropy change of universe = 0 + (– 0.04697) = -0.04697 kJ/kg … i.e. < 0
This is impossible.
Therefore, flow is from B to A …. Ans.

Prob.7.17. A well insulated Shell & Tube heat exchanger is used to heat water (cp = 4.18 kJ/kg.C) in the 
tubes from 20 to 70 C at a rate of 4.5 kg/s. Heat is supplied by hot oil (cp = 2.3 kJ/kg.C) that enters the 
shell side at 170 C at a rate of 10 kg/s. Disregarding any heat loss from the heat exchanger, determine: 
(i) the exit temp of the oil, and (ii) the rate of entropy generation in the heat exchanger. [Ref: 1]

Problems solved with The Expert System for Thermodynamics (TEST):
Prob.7.18. 1.2 m^3 of air is heated reversibly at constant pressure from 300 K to 600 K and is then 
cooled reversibly at constant volume back to the initial temp. If the initial pressure is 1 bar, calculate the 
net heat flow and overall change in entropy. Also, represent the processes on a T-s diagram. Take cp = 
1.005 kJ/kg.K and R = 0.287 kJ/kg.K [VTU-BTD-June-July 2009]
Note: This is the same as Prob.7.12, solved with Mathcad.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

4.	 Go to Device Panel. Enter State 1 and State 2 for i-State and e-State respectively. Also 
Qdot = o since compressor is taken as insulated (i.e. no heat transfer), and Wdot-ext = 0 = 
external work. Press Enter. We get:
Thus:
Entropy generated in compressor = Sdot_gen = 0.05449 kW/K …. Ans.
Note: Entropy change of surrounding is zero, since there is no heat transfer to surroundings. And, entropy 
change of universe = entropy change of system (i.e. compressor) + entropy change of surroundings =

Prob.7.27. An open, insulated vessel contains 10 kg of water at 30 C. A mass of 2 kg of ice at a temp 
of -4 C is added to the water and after a time, the temp of the contents of the vessel becomes uniform. 
Assuming the heat transfer to the atmosphere to be zero, determine the final temp and the change in 
entropy of the mixture. [VTU-BTD-July 2007]

Prob.7.29. A rigid tank is divided in to two equal parts by a partition. One part of the tank contains 
2.5 kg of compressed liquid water at 400 kPa and 60 C while the other part is evacuated. The partition 
is now removed, and the water expands to fill the entire tank. Determine the entropy change of water 
during this process, if the final pressure in the tank is 40 kPa. [Ref:1]

3.	 Choose H2O as the working substance and enter for State 1: P1= 400 kPa, T1 = 60 C, 
m1= 2.5 kg, and hit Enter. We get:
4.	 Now, for State 2: enter P2 = 0 and m2 = 0 (since chamber is evacuated), and Vol2 = Vol1 
(since two chambers are equal, by data). Hit Enter:
5.	 For State 3, enter: P1 = 40 kPa, m3 = (m1 + m2), and Vol3 = (Vol1 + Vol2), since that 
partition is now removed. Hit Enter. We get:
