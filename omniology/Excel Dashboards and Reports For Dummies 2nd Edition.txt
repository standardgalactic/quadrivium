Introduction
T

he term business intelligence (BI), coined by Howard Dresner of the Gartner 
Inc., describes the set of concepts and methods to improve business 
decision-making by using fact-based support systems. Practically ­speaking, BI 
is what you get when you analyze raw data and turn that ­analysis into knowl­
edge. BI can help an organization identify cost-cutting ­opportunities, uncover 
new business opportunities, recognize changing business ­environments, iden­
tify data anomalies, and create widely accessible reports.
Over the last few years, the BI concept has overtaken corporate executives 
who are eager to turn impossible amounts of data into knowledge. As a result 
of this trend, whole industries have been created. Software vendors that 
focus on BI and dashboarding are coming out of the woodwork. New consult­
ing firms touting their BI knowledge are popping up virtually every week. And 
even the traditional enterprise solution providers like Business Objects and 
SAP are offering new BI capabilities.
This need for BI has manifested itself in many forms. Most recently, it has 
come in the form of dashboard fever. Dashboards are reporting mechanisms 
that deliver business intelligence in a graphical form.
Maybe you’ve been hit with dashboard fever. Or maybe your manager is hit­
ting you with dashboard fever. Nevertheless, you’re probably holding this 
book because you’re being asked to create BI solutions (that is, dashboards) 
in Excel.
Although many IT managers would scoff at the thought of using Excel as a BI 
tool, Excel is inherently part of the enterprise BI tool portfolio. Whether or 
not IT managers are keen to acknowledge it, most of the data analysis and 
reporting done in business today is done by using a spreadsheet. There are 
several significant reasons to use Excel as the platform for your dashboards 
and reports, including the following:
	
✓	Tool familiarity: If you work in corporate America, you are conversant 
in the language of Excel. You can send even the most seasoned of senior 
vice presidents an Excel-based reporting tool and trust he will know 
what to do with it. With an Excel reporting process, your users spend 
less time figuring out how to use the tool and more time looking at 
the data.

2
Excel Dashboards & Reports For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
	
✓	Built-in flexibility: With most enterprise dashboarding solutions, the 
capability to perform analyses outside the predefined views is either dis­
abled or unavailable. How many times have you dumped enterprise-level 
data into Excel so you can analyze it yourself? I know I have. You can bet 
that if you give users an inflexible reporting mechanism, they’ll do what 
it takes to create their own usable reports. In Excel, features such as 
pivot tables, autofilters, and Form controls allow you to create mecha­
nisms that don’t lock your audience into one view. And because you can 
have multiple worksheets in one workbook, you can give them space to 
do their own side analysis as needed.
	
✓	Rapid development: Building your own reporting capabilities in Excel 
can liberate you from the IT Department’s resource and time limitations. 
With Excel, you can not only develop reporting mechanisms faster, 
but you also have the flexibility to adapt more quickly to changing 
requirements.
	
✓	Powerful data connectivity and automation capabilities: Excel is not the 
toy application some IT managers make it out to be. With its own native 
programming language and its robust object model, Excel can be used to 
automate processes and even connect to various data sources. With a few 
advanced techniques, you can make Excel a hands-off reporting mechanism 
that practically runs on its own.
	
✓	Little to no incremental costs: Not all of us can work for multibillion 
dollar companies that can afford enterprise-level reporting solutions. In 
most companies, funding for new computers and servers is limited, let 
alone funding for expensive BI reporting packages. For those ­companies, 
leveraging Microsoft Office is frankly the most cost-effective way to 
deliver key business reporting tools without compromising too deeply 
on usability and functionality.
All that being said, there are so many reporting functions and tools in Excel 
that it’s difficult to know where to start. Enter your humble author, spirited 
into your hands via this book. Here, I show you how you can turn Excel into 
your own personal BI tool. With a few fundamentals and some of the new BI 
functionality Microsoft has included in this latest version of Excel, you can 
go from reporting data with simple tables to creating meaningful reporting 
­components that are sure to wow management.
About This Book
The goal of this book is to show you how to leverage Excel functionality to 
build and manage better reporting mechanisms. Each chapter in this book 
provides a comprehensive review of the technical and analytical concepts 

3
 Introduction 
that help you create better reporting components — components that can be 
used for both dashboards and reports. It’s important to note that this book 
is not a guide to visualizations or dashboarding best practices — although 
those subjects are worthy of their own book. This book is focused on the 
technical aspects of using Excel’s various tools and functionality and ­
applying them to reporting.
The chapters in this book are designed to be stand-alone chapters that you 
can selectively refer to as needed. As you move through this book, you’ll be 
able to create increasingly sophisticated dashboard and report components. 
After reading this book, you’ll be able to:
	
✓	Analyze large amounts of data and report them in a meaningful way
	
✓	Get better visibility into data from different perspectives
	
✓	Quickly slice data into various views on the fly
	
✓	Automate redundant reporting and analyses
	
✓	Create interactive reporting processes
Foolish Assumptions 
I make three assumptions about you as the reader:
	
✓	I assume you’ve already installed Microsoft Excel.
	
✓	I assume you have some familiarity with the basic concepts of data 
analysis such as working with tables, aggregating data, and performing 
calculations.
	
✓	I assume you have a strong grasp of basic Excel concepts such as man­
aging table structures, creating formulas, referencing cells, filtering, and 
sorting.
Icons Used In This Book
As you read this book, you’ll see icons in the margins that indicate material of 
interest (or not, as the case may be).This section briefly describes each icon 
in this book.
	
Tips are nice because they help you save time or perform some task without a 
lot of extra work. The tips in this book are time-saving techniques or pointers 
to resources that you should try to get the maximum benefit from Excel.

4
Excel Dashboards & Reports For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
	
Try to avoid doing anything marked with a Warning icon, which (as you might 
expect) represents a danger of one sort or another.
	
Whenever you see this icon, think advanced tip or technique. You might find 
these tidbits of useful information just too boring for words, or they could 
contain the solution you need to get a program running. Skip these bits of 
information whenever you like.
	
If you don’t get anything else out of a particular chapter or section, remember 
the material marked by this icon. This text usually contains an essential process 
or a bit of information you ought to remember.

n his song, “New York State of Mind,” Billy Joel laments the differences 
between California and New York. In this homage to the Big Apple, he 
implies a mood and a feeling that comes with thinking about New York. 
I admit it’s a stretch, but I’ll extend this analogy to Excel — don’t laugh.
In Excel, the differences between building a dashboard and creating standard 
table-driven analyses are as great as the differences between California and 
New York. To approach a dashboarding project, you truly have to get into the 
dashboard state of mind. As you’ll come to realize in the next few chapters, 
dashboarding requires far more preparation than standard Excel analyses. 
It calls for closer communication with business leaders, stricter data modeling 
techniques, and the following of certain best practices. It’s beneficial to have 
a base familiarity with fundamental dashboarding concepts before venturing 
off into the mechanics of building a dashboard.
In this chapter, you get a solid understanding of these basic dashboard 
­concepts and design principles as well as what it takes to prepare for a 
­dashboarding project.
Defining Dashboards and Reports
It isn’t difficult to use report and dashboard interchangeably. In fact, the 
line between reports and dashboards frequently gets muddied. I’ve seen 
­countless reports referred to as dashboards just because they included a 
few charts. Likewise, I’ve seen many examples of what could be considered 
­dashboards but have been called reports.

Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
Now this may all seem like semantics to you, but it’s helpful to clear the air a 
bit and understand the core attributes of what are considered to be reports 
and dashboards.
Defining reports
Reports are probably the most common application of business intelligence. 
A report can be described as a document that contains data used for reading 
or viewing. It can be as simple as a data table or as complex as a subtotaled 
view with interactive drill downs, similar to Excel’s Subtotal or pivot table 
functionality.
The key attribute of a report is that it doesn’t lead a reader to a predefined 
conclusion. Although a report can include analysis, aggregations, and even 
charts, reports often allow for the end users to apply their own judgment and 
analysis to the data.
To clarify this concept, Figure 1-1 shows an example of a report. This report 
shows the National Park overnight visitor statistics by period. Although 
this data can be useful, it’s clear this report isn’t steering the reader in any 
­predefined judgment or analysis; it’s simply presenting the aggregated data.

 Chapter 1: Getting in the Dashboard State of Mind
Defining dashboards
A dashboard is a visual interface that provides at-a-glance views into key 
measures relevant to a particular objective or business process. Dashboards 
have three main attributes:
	
✓	Dashboards are typically graphical in nature, providing visualizations 
that help focus attention on key trends, comparisons, and exceptions.
	
✓	Dashboards often display only data that are relevant to the goal of the 
dashboard.
	
✓	Because dashboards are designed with a specific purpose or goal, they 
inherently contain predefined conclusions that relieve the end user from 
performing his own analysis.
Figure 1-2 illustrates a dashboard that uses the same data shown in Figure 1-1. 
This dashboard displays key information about the National Park overnight 
visitor stats. As you can see, this presentation has all the main attributes 
that define a dashboard. First, it’s a visual display that allows you to quickly 
recognize the overall trending of the overnight visitor stats. Second, you 
can see that not all the detailed data is shown here — only the key pieces of 
­information relevant to support the goal of this dashboard. Finally, by virtue 
of its objective, this dashboard effectively presents you with analysis and 
conclusions about the trending of overnight visitors.

Preparing for Greatness
Imagine your manager asks you to create a dashboard that tells him 
everything he should know about monthly service subscriptions. Do you 
jump to action and slap together whatever comes to mind? Do you take a 
guess at what he wants to see and hope it’s useful? These questions sound 
ridiculous, but such situations happen more than you think. I’m constantly 
called to create the next great reporting tool but am rarely provided the 
time to gather the true requirements for it. Between limited information 
and unrealistic deadlines, the end product often ends up being unused or 
having little value.
This brings me to one of the key steps in preparing for dashboarding — 
collecting user requirements.
In the non-IT world of the Excel analyst, user requirements are practically 
useless because of sudden changes in project scope, constantly changing 
­priorities, and shifting deadlines. The gathering of user requirements is viewed 
to be a lot of work and a waste of valuable time in the ever-changing business 
environment. But as I mention at the start of this chapter, it’s time to get into 
the dashboard state of mind.
Consider how many times a manager has asked you for an analysis and then 
said “No, I meant this.” Or, “Now that I see it, I realize I need this.” As frustrat­
ing as this can be for a single analysis, imagine running into it again and again 
during the creation of a complex dashboard with several data integration 
processes. The question is, would you rather spend your time on the front 
end gathering user requirements or spend time painstakingly redesigning the 
dashboard you’ll surely come to hate?
The process of gathering user requirements doesn’t have to be an overly 
complicated or formal one. Here are some simple things you can do to ensure 
you have a solid idea of the purpose of the dashboard.
Establish the audience and purpose 
for the dashboard
Chances are your manager has been asked to create the reporting mechanism, 
and he has passed the task to you. Don’t be afraid to ask about the source 
of the initial request. Talk to the requestors about what they’re really asking 
for. Discuss the purpose of the dashboard and the triggers that caused them 
to ask for a dashboard in the first place. You may find, after discussing the 
matter, that a simple Excel report meets their needs, foregoing the need for a 
full-on dashboard.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting in the Dashboard State of Mind
If a dashboard is indeed warranted, talk about who the end users are. Take 
some time to meet with a few of the end users to talk about how they’d use 
the dashboard. Will the dashboard be used as a performance tool for regional 
managers? Will the dashboard be used to share data with external ­customers? 
Talking through these fundamentals with the right people helps align your 
thoughts and avoids the creation of a dashboard that doesn’t fulfill the 
­necessary requirements.
Delineate the measures for the dashboard
Most dashboards are designed around a set of measures, or key performance 
indicators (KPIs). A KPI is an indicator of the performance of a task deemed 
to be essential to daily operations or processes. The idea is that a KPI reveals 
performance that is outside the normal range for a particular measure, so 
it therefore often signals the need for attention and intervention. Although 
the measures you place into your dashboards may not officially be called 
KPIs, they undoubtedly serve the same purpose — to draw attention to 
problem areas.
	
The topic of creating effective KPIs for your organization is a subject worthy 
of its own book and is out of the scope of this endeavor. For a detailed guide 
on KPI development strategies, pick up David Parmenter’s Key Performance 
Indicators: Developing, Implementing, and Using Winning KPIs (John Wiley & 
Sons, Inc.). This book provides an excellent step-by-step approach to 
­developing and implementing KPIs.
The measures used on a dashboard should absolutely support the initial 
­purpose of that dashboard. For example, if you’re creating a dashboard 
focused on supply chain processes, it may not make sense to have human 
resources headcount data incorporated. It’s generally good practice to avoid 
nice-to-know data in your dashboards simply to fill white space or because 
the data is available. If the data doesn’t support the core purpose of the 
­dashboard, leave it out.
	
Here’s another tip: When gathering the measures required for the dashboard, 
I find that it often helps to write a sentence to describe the measure needed. 
For example, instead of simply adding the word Revenue into my user require­
ments, I write what I call a component question, such as, “What is the overall 
revenue trend for the last two years?” I call it a component question because 
I intend to create a single component, such as a chart or a table, to answer 
the question. For instance, if the component question is, “What is the overall 
revenue trend for the last two years?” you can imagine a chart component 
answering that question by showing the two-year revenue trend.
I sometimes take this a step further and actually incorporate the component 
questions into a mock layout of the dashboard to get a high-level sense of the 
data the dashboard will require. Figure 1-3 illustrates an example.

Figure 1-3:

board layout

and the

create the 
measures.
	
Each box in this dashboard layout mockup represents a component on the 
dashboard and its approximate position. The questions within each box 
provide a sense of the types of data required to create the measures for 
the dashboard.
Catalog the required data sources
When you have the list of measures that need to be included on the dashboard, 
it’s important to take a tally of the available systems to determine if the data 
required to produce those measures are available. Ask yourself the following 
questions:
	
✓	Do you have access to the data sources necessary?
	
✓	How often are those data sources refreshed?
	
✓	Who owns and maintains those data sources?
	
✓	What are the processes to get the data from those resources?
	
✓	Does the data even exist?
These are all questions you need answered when negotiating dashboard 
development time, data refresh intervals, and change management.
	
Conventional wisdom says that the measures on your dashboard shouldn’t be 
governed by the availability of data. Instead, you should let dashboard KPIs 
and measures govern the data sources in your organization. Although I agree 
with the spirit of that statement, I’ve been involved in too many dashboard 
projects that have fallen apart because of lack of data. Real-world experience 
has taught me the difference between the ideal and the ordeal.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting in the Dashboard State of Mind
If your organizational strategy requires that you collect and measure data 
that is nonexistent or not available, press pause on the dashboard project 
and turn your attention to creating a data collection mechanism that will get 
the data you need.
Define the dimensions and filters 
for the dashboard
In the context of reporting, a dimension is a data category used to organize 
business data. Examples of dimensions are Region, Market, Branch, Manager, 
or Employee. When you define a dimension in the user requirements stage 
of development, you’re determining how the measures should be grouped or 
distributed. For example, if your dashboard should report data by employee, 
you need to ensure that your data collection and aggregation processes 
include employee detail. As you can imagine, adding a new dimension after 
the dashboard is built can get complicated, especially when your processes 
require many aggregations across multiple data sources. The bottom line 
is that locking down the dimensions for a dashboard early in the process 
­definitely saves you headaches.
Along those same lines, you want to get a clear sense of the types of filters that 
are required. In the context of dashboards, filters are mechanisms that allow 
you to narrow the scope of the data to a single dimension. For example, you can 
filter on Year, Employee, or Region. Again, if you don’t account for a particular 
filter while building your dashboarding process, you’ll likely be forced into an 
unpleasant redesign of both your data collection processes and your dashboard.
If you’re confused by the difference between dimensions and filters, think 
about a simple Excel table. A dimension is like a column of data (such as a 
column containing employee names) in an Excel table. A filter, then, is the 
mechanism that allows you to narrow your table to show only the data for 
a particular employee. For example, if you apply Excel’s AutoFilter to the 
employee column, you are building a filter mechanism into your table.
Determine the need for drill-down features
Many dashboards provide drill-down features that allow users to “drill” into 
the details of a specific measure. You want to get a clear understanding of the 
types of drill-downs your users have in mind.
To most users, drill-down feature means the ability to get a raw data table 
­supporting the measures shown on the dashboard. Although getting raw data 
isn’t always practical or possible, discussing these requests will at a minimum 
allow you to talk to your users about additional reporting, links to other data 
sources, and other solutions that may help them get the data they need.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
Establish the refresh schedule
A refresh schedule refers to the schedule by which a dashboard is updated to 
show the latest information available. Because you’re the one responsible for 
building and maintaining the dashboard, you should have a say in the refresh 
schedules — your manager may not know what it takes to refresh the dash­
board in question.
While you’re determining the refresh schedule, keep in mind the refresh rates 
of the different data sources whose measures you need to get. You can’t refresh 
your dashboard any faster than your data sources. Also, negotiate enough 
development time to build macros that aid in automation of redundant and 
time-consuming refresh tasks.
A Quick Look at Dashboard
Design Principles
When collecting user requirements for your dashboarding project, there’s a 
heavy focus on the data aspects of the dashboard: The types of data needed, 
the dimensions of data required, the data sources to be used, and so on. This is 
a good thing — without solid data processes, your dashboards won’t be effec­
tive or maintainable. That being said, here’s another aspect to your dashboard­
ing project that calls for the same fervor in preparation: the design aspect.
Excel users live in a world of numbers and tables, not visualization and 
design. Your typical Excel analysts have no background in visual design 
and are often left to rely on their own visual instincts to design their dash­
boards. As a result, most Excel-based dashboards have little thought given 
to effective visual design, often resulting in overly cluttered and ineffective 
user interfaces.
The good news is that dashboarding has been around for such a long time 
that there’s a vast knowledge base of prescribed visualization and dashboard 
design principles. Many of these principles seem like common sense; even 
so, these are concepts that Excel users don’t often find themselves ­thinking 
about. Because this chapter is about getting into the dashboard state of mind, 
I break that trend and review a few dashboard design principles that improve 
the look and feel of your Excel dashboards.
	
Many of the concepts in this section come from the work of Stephen Few, visu­
alization expert and author of several books and articles on dashboard design 
principles. This book is primarily focused on the technical aspects of building 
reporting components in Excel, but this section offers a high-level look at dash­
board design. If you find that you’re captivated by the subject, feel free to visit 
Stephen Few’s website at www.perceptualedge.com.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting in the Dashboard State of Mind
Rule number 1: Keep it simple
Dashboard design expert, Stephen Few, has the mantra, “Simplify, Simplify, 
Simplify.” The basic idea is that dashboards cluttered with too many mea­
sures or too much eye candy can dilute the significant information you’re 
trying to present. How many times has someone told you that your reports 
look “busy”? In essence, this complaint means that too much is going on in 
the page or screen, making it hard to see the actual data.
Here are a few actions you can take to ensure simpler and more effective 
dashboard designs.
Don’t turn your dashboard into a data repository
Admit it. You include as much information onto a report as possible, primarily 
to avoid being asked for additional information. We all do it. But in the dash­
board state of mind, you have to fight the urge to force every piece of data 
available onto your dashboards.
Overwhelming users with too much data can cause them to lose sight of 
the primary goal of the dashboard and focus on inconsequential data. The 
measures used on a dashboard should support the initial purpose of that 
dashboard. Avoid the urge to fill white space for the sake of symmetry and 
appearances. Don’t include nice-to-know data just because the data is avail­
able. If the data doesn’t support the core purpose of the dashboard, leave 
it out.
Avoid the fancy formatting
The key to communicating effectively with your dashboards is to present 
your data as simply as possible. There’s no need to wrap it in eye candy to 
make it more interesting. It’s okay to have a dashboard with little to no color 
or formatting. You’ll find that the lack of fancy formatting only serves to 
call attention to the actual data. Focus on the data and not the shiny happy 
graphics. Here are a few guidelines:
	
✓	Avoid using colors or background fills to partition your dashboards. 
Colors, in general, should be used sparingly, reserved for providing 
information about key data points. For example, assigning the colors 
red, yellow, and green to measures traditionally indicates performance 
level. Adding these colors to other sections of your dashboard only 
serves to distract your audience.
	
✓	De-emphasize borders, backgrounds, and other elements that define 
dashboard areas. Try to use the natural white space between your com­
ponents to partition your dashboard. If borders are necessary, format 
them to hues lighter than the ones you’ve used for your data. Light 
grays are typically ideal for borders. The idea is to indicate sections 
without distracting from the information displayed.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
	
✓	Avoid applying fancy effects such as gradients, pattern fills, shadows, 
glows, soft edges, and other formatting. Excel 2007 makes it easy to 
apply effects that make everything look shiny, glittery, and generally 
happy. Although these formatting features make for great marketing 
tools, they don’t do your reporting mechanisms any favors.
	
✓	Don’t try to enhance your dashboards with clip art or pictures. Not only 
do they do nothing to further data presentation, they often just look tacky.
Limit each dashboard to one printable page
Dashboards, in general, should provide at-a-glance views into key measures 
relevant to particular objectives or business processes. This implies that all 
the data is immediately viewable on the one page. Although including all 
your data on one page isn’t always the easiest thing to do, there’s much ben­
efit to being able to see everything on one page or screen. You can compare 
­sections more easily, you can process cause and effect relationships more 
effectively, and you rely less on short-term memory. When a user has to scroll 
left, right, or down, these benefits are diminished. Furthermore, users tend 
to believe that when information is placed out of normal view (areas that 
require scrolling), it’s somehow less important.
But what if you can’t fit all the data on one sheet? First, review the measures 
on your dashboard and determine if they really need to be there. Next, format 
your dashboard to use less space (format fonts, reduce white space, and 
adjust column and row widths). Finally, try adding interactivity to your 
dashboard, allowing users to dynamically change views to show only those 
­measures that are relevant to them.
Use layout and placement to draw focus
As I discuss earlier in this chapter, only measures that support the ­dashboard’s 
utility and purpose should be included on the dashboard. However, it should 
be said that just because all measures on your dashboard are significant, they 
may not always have the same level of importance. In other words, you’ll 
­frequently want one component of your dashboard to stand out from the 
others.
Instead of using bright colors or exaggerated sizing differences, you can 
leverage location and placement to draw focus to the most important 
­components on your dashboard.
Various studies have shown that readers have a natural tendency to focus on 
particular regions of a document. For example, researchers at the Poynter 
Institute’s Eyetrack III project have found that readers view various regions 
on a screen in a certain order, paying particular attention to ­specific regions 
onscreen. They use the diagram in Figure 1-4 to illustrate what they call 

19
 Chapter 1: Getting in the Dashboard State of Mind
priority zones. Regions with the number 1 in the diagram seem to have high 
prominence, attracting the most attention for longer periods of time. 
Meanwhile, number 3 regions seem to have low prominence.
	
Figure 1-4: 
Studies 
show that 
users pay 
particular 
attention to 
the upper-
left and mid-
dle-left of a 
document.
	
You can leverage these priority zones to promote or demote certain ­components 
based on significance. If one of the charts on your dashboard warrants special 
focus, you can simply place that chart in a region of prominence.
	
Note that surrounding colors, borders, fonts, and other formatting can affect 
the viewing patterns of your readers, de-emphasizing a previously high 
­prominence region.
Format numbers effectively
There will undoubtedly be lots of numbers on your dashboards. Some of 
them will be in charts, and others will be in tables. Remember that every 
piece of information on your dashboard should have a reason for being there. 
It’s important that you format your numbers effectively to allow your users to 
understand the information they represent without confusion or hindrance. 
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when formatting the numbers on 
your dashboards and reports:
	
✓	Always use commas to make numbers easier to read. For example, 
instead of 2345, show 2,345.
	
✓	Only use decimal places if that level of precision is required. For 
instance, there’s rarely a benefit for showing the decimal places in a 
dollar amount, such as $123.45. In most cases, the $123 will suffice. 
Likewise in percentages, use only the minimum number of decimals 
required to represent the data effectively. For example instead of 43.21%, 
you may be able to get away with 43%.

20
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
	
✓	Only use the dollar symbol when you need to clarify that you’re 
­referring to monetary values. If you have a chart or table that contains 
all revenue values, and there’s a label clearly stating this, you can save 
room and pixels by leaving out the dollar symbol.
	
✓	Format very large numbers to the thousands or millions place. For 
instance, instead of displaying 16,906,714, you can format the number 
to read 17M.
	
In Chapter 3 of this book, you explore how to leverage number formatting 
tricks to enhance the readability of your dashboards and reports.
Use titles and labels effectively
It’s common sense, but many people often fail to label items on dashboards 
effectively. If your manager looks at your dashboard and asks you, “What is 
this telling me?” you likely have labeling issues. Here are a few guidelines for 
effective labeling on your dashboards and reports:
	
✓	Always include a timestamp on your reporting mechanisms. This 
minimizes confusion when distributing the same dashboard or report in 
monthly or weekly installments.
	
✓	Always include some text indicating when the data for the measures 
was retrieved. In many cases, the timing of the data is a critical piece of 
information when analyzing a measure.
	
✓	Use descriptive titles for each component on your dashboard. This 
allows users to clearly identify what they’re looking at. Be sure to avoid 
cryptic titles with lots of acronyms and symbols.
	
✓	Although it may seem counterintuitive, it’s generally good practice 
to de-emphasize labels by formatting them to hues lighter than the 
ones used for your data. Lightly colored labels give your users the 
­information they need without distracting them from the information 
displayed. Ideal colors for labels are colors commonly found in nature: 
soft grays, browns, blues, and greens.

Building a Super Model
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the best data modeling practices
▶	Leveraging Excel functions to deliver data
▶	Creating smart tables that expand with data
O

ne of Excel’s most attractive features is its flexibility. You can create an 
intricate system of interlocking calculations, linked cells, and format­
ted summaries that work together to create a final analysis. However, years 
of experience has brought me face to face with an ugly truth: Excel is like 
the cool gym teacher that lets you do anything you want — the freedom can 
be fun, but a lack of structure in your data models can lead to some serious 
headaches in the long run.
What’s a data model? A data model provides the foundation upon which your 
reporting mechanism is built. When you build a spreadsheet that imports, 
aggregates, and shapes data, you’re essentially building a data model that 
feeds your dashboards and reports.
Creating a poorly designed data model can mean hours of manual labor 
maintaining and refreshing your reporting mechanisms. On the other hand, 
creating an effective model allows you to easily repeat monthly reporting 
­processes without damaging your reports or your sanity.
The goal of this chapter is to show you the concepts and techniques that help 
you build effective data models. In this chapter, you discover that creating 
a successful reporting mechanism requires more than slapping data onto a 
spreadsheet. Although you see how to build cool dashboard components in 
later chapters, those components won’t do you any good if you can’t effectively 
manage your data models. On that note, let’s get started.

22
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
Data Modeling Best Practices
Building an effective model isn’t as complicated as you may think. It’s pri­
marily a matter of thinking about your reporting processes differently. Most 
people spend very little time thinking about the supporting data model 
behind a reporting process. If they think about it at all, they usually start by 
imagining a mockup of the finished dashboard and work backward from there.
Instead of seeing just the finished dashboard in your head, try to think of 
the end-to-end process. Where will you get the data? How should the data be 
structured? What analysis will need to be performed? How will the data be 
fed to the dashboard? How will the dashboard be refreshed?
Obviously the answers to these questions are highly situation specific. However, 
some data modeling best practices will guide you to a new way of thinking 
about your reporting process. These are discussed in the next few sections.
Separating data, analysis, 
and presentation
One of the most important concepts in a data model is the separation of data, 
analysis, and presentation. The fundamental idea is that you don’t want your 
data to become too tied into any one particular way of presenting that data.
To get your mind around this concept, think about an invoice. When you 
receive an invoice, you don’t assume the financial data on that invoice is the 
true source of your data. It’s merely a presentation of data that’s actually 
stored in some database. That data can be analyzed and presented to you in 
many other manners: in charts, in tables, or even on websites. This sounds 
obvious, but Excel users often fuse data, analysis, and presentation together.
For instance, I’ve seen Excel workbooks that contain 12 tabs, each represent­
ing a month. On each tab, data for that month is listed along with formulas, 
pivot tables, and summaries. Now what happens when you’re asked to pro­
vide summary by quarter? Do you add more formulas and tabs to consoli­
date the data on each of the month tabs? The fundamental problem in this 
scenario is that the tabs actually represent data values that are fused into the 
presentation of your analysis.
For an example more in-line with reporting, take a look at Figure 2-1. Hard-
coded tables like this are common. This table is an amalgamation of data, 
analysis, and presentation. Not only does this table tie you to a specific analy­
sis, but there’s little to no transparency into what the analysis exactly con­
sists of. Also, what happens when you need to report by quarters or when 
another dimension of analysis is needed? Do you import a table that consists 
of more columns and rows? How does that affect your model?

23
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
	
Figure 2-1: 
Avoid using 
hard-coded 
tables that 
fuse data, 
analysis, and 
presentation.
	
The alternative is to create three layers in your data model: a data layer, an 
analysis layer, and a presentation layer. You can think of these layers as three 
different spreadsheets in an Excel workbook. One sheet to hold the raw data 
that feeds your report, one sheet to serve as a staging area where the data is 
analyzed and shaped, and one to serve as the presentation layer. Figure 2-2 
illustrates the three layers of an effective data model.
As you can see in Figure 2-2, the raw dataset is located on its own sheet. 
Although the dataset has some level of aggregation applied to keep it 
­manageably small, no further analysis is done on the data sheet.
The analysis layer consists primarily of formulas that analyze and pull data 
from the data layer into formatted tables commonly referred to as staging 
tables. These staging tables ultimately feed the reporting components in 
your presentation layer. In short, the sheet that contains the analysis layer 
becomes the staging area where data is summarized and shaped to feed 
the reporting components. Notice in the analysis tab in Figure 2-2, the for­
mula bar illustrates that the table consists of formulas that reference the 
data tab.
There are a couple of benefits to this setup. First, the entire reporting model 
can be refreshed easily by simply replacing the raw data with an updated 
dataset. The formulas in the analysis tab continue to work with the latest 
data. Second, any additional analysis can easily be created by using different 
combinations of formulas on the analysis tab. If you need data that doesn’t 
exist in the data sheet, you can easily append a column to the end of the raw 
dataset without disturbing the analysis or presentation sheets.
	
Note that you don’t necessarily have to place your data, analysis, and presen­
tation layers on different spreadsheets. In small data models, you may find 
it easier to place your data in one area of a spreadsheet while building your 
staging tables in another area of the same spreadsheet.
Along those same lines, remember that you’re not limited to just three 
spreadsheets either. That is to say, you can have several sheets that provide
the raw data, several sheets that analyze, and several that serve as the 
­presentation layer.

25
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
Wherever you choose to place the different layers, keep in mind that the idea 
remains the same. The analysis layer should primarily consist of formulas 
that pull data from the data sheets into staging tables used to feed your pre­
sentation. Later in this chapter, you explore some of the formulas that can be 
used in your analysis sheets.
Starting with appropriately 
structured data
Not all datasets are created equal. Although some datasets work in a stan­
dard Excel environment, they may not work for data modeling purposes. 
Before building your data model, ensure your source data is appropriately 
structured for dashboarding purposes.
At the risk of oversimplification, I assert that datasets typically used in Excel 
come in three fundamental forms:
	
✓	The spreadsheet report
	
✓	The flat data file
	
✓	The tabular dataset
The punch line is that only flat data files and tabular datasets make for effec­
tive data models. I review and discuss each of these different forms in the 
next few sections.
Spreadsheet reports make for ineffective data models
Spreadsheet reports display highly formatted, summarized data and are often 
designed as presentation tools for management or executive users. A typi­
cal spreadsheet report makes judicious use of empty space for formatting, 
repeats data for aesthetic purposes, and presents only high-level analysis. 
Figure 2-3 illustrates a spreadsheet report.
Although a spreadsheet report may look nice, it doesn’t make for an effective 
data model. Why? The primary reason is that these reports offer you no sepa­
ration of data, analysis, and presentation. You’re essentially locked into one 
analysis.
Although you could make charts from the report shown in Figure 2-3, it’d be 
impractical to apply any analysis outside what’s already there. For instance, 
how would you calculate and present the average of all bike sales? How 
would you calculate a list of the top ten best performing markets?

26
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
With this setup, you’re forced into very manual processes that are difficult to 
maintain month after month. Any analysis outside the high-level ones already 
in the report is basic at best — even with fancy formulas. Furthermore, what 
happens when you’re required to show bike sales by month? When your data 
model requires analysis with data that isn’t in the spreadsheet report, you’re 
forced to search for another dataset.
Flat data files lend themselves nicely to data models
The next type of file format is a flat file. Flat files are data repositories orga­
nized by row and column. Each row corresponds to a set of data elements, or 
a record. Each column is a field. A field corresponds to a unique data element 
in a record. Figure 2-4 contains the same data as the report in Figure 2-3 but 
expressed in a flat data file format.
Notice that every data field has a column, and every column corresponds to 
one data element. Furthermore, there’s no extra spacing, and each row (or 
record) corresponds to a unique set of information. But the key attribute that 
makes this a flat file is that no single field uniquely identifies a record. In fact, 
you’d have to specify four separate fields (Region, Market, Business Segment, 
and a month’s sales amount) before you could uniquely identify the record.
Flat files lend themselves nicely to data modeling in Excel because they can 
be detailed enough to hold the data you need and still be conducive to a 
wide array of analysis with simple formulas — SUM, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP, and 
SUMIF, just to name a few. Later in this chapter, you explore formulas that 
come in handy in a reporting data model.

 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
Tabular datasets are perfect for pivot table–driven data models
Many effective data models are driven primarily by pivot tables. Pivot tables 
(which I cover in Chapter 3) are Excel’s premier analysis tools. For those 
of you who have used pivot tables before, you know they offer an excellent 
way to summarize and shape data for use by reporting components, such as 
charts and tables.
Tabular datasets are ideal for pivot table–driven data models. Figure 2-5 illus­
trates a tabular dataset. Note that the primary difference between a tabular 
dataset, as shown in Figure 2-5, and a flat data file is that in tabular datasets 
the column labels don’t double as actual data. For instance, in Figure 2-4, 
the month identifiers are integrated into the column labels. In Figure 2-5, the 
Sales Period column contains the month identifier. This subtle difference 
in structure is what makes tabular datasets optimal data sources for pivot 
tables. This structure ensures that key pivot table functions, such as sorting 
and grouping, work the way they should.
The attributes of a tabular dataset are as follows:
	
✓	The first row of the dataset contains field labels that describe the infor­
mation in each column.
	
✓	The column labels don’t pull double-duty as data items that can be used 
as filters or query criterion (such as months, dates, years, regions, mar­
kets, and so on).
	
✓	There are no blank rows or columns — every column has a heading, and 
a value is in every row.
	
✓	Each column represents a unique category of data.
	
✓	Each row represents individual items in each column.

Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
Avoiding turning your data model 
into a database
In Chapter 1, you might have read that measures used on a dashboard should 
absolutely support the initial purpose of that dashboard. The same concept 
applies to the back-end data model. You should only import data that’s 
­necessary to fulfill the purpose of your dashboard or report.
In an effort to have as much data as possible at their fingertips, many Excel 
users bring into their spreadsheets every piece of data they can get their 
hands on. You can spot these people by the 40 megabyte files they send 
through e-mail. You’ve seen these spreadsheets — two tabs that contain 
presentation and then six hidden tabs that contain thousands of lines of 
data (most of which isn’t used). They essentially build a database in their 
spreadsheet.
What’s wrong with utilizing as much data as possible? Well, here are a few issues:
	
✓	Aggregating data within Excel increases the number of formulas. If 
you’re bringing in all raw data, you have to aggregate that data in Excel. 
This inevitably causes you to exponentially increase the number of 
formulas you have to employ and maintain. Remember that your data 
model is a vehicle for presenting analyses, not processing raw data. The 
data that works best in reporting mechanisms is what’s already been 
aggregated and summarized into useful views that can be navigated and 
fed to dashboard components. Importing data that’s already been aggre­
gated as much as possible is far better. For example, if you need to report 
	
Figure 2-5: 
A tabular 
dataset.
	

29
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
on Revenue by Region and Month, there’s no need to import sales trans­
actions into your data model. Instead, use an aggregated table consisting 
of Region, Month, and Sum of Revenue.
	
✓	Your data model will be distributed with your dashboard. In other 
words, because your dashboard is fed by your data model, you need 
to maintain the model behind the scenes (likely in hidden tabs) when 
distributing the dashboard. Besides the fact that it causes the file size 
to be unwieldy, including too much data in your data model can actually 
degrade the performance of your dashboard. Why? When you open an 
Excel file, the entire file is loaded into memory or RAM to ensure quick 
data processing and access. The drawback to this behavior is that Excel 
requires a great deal of RAM to process even the smallest change in 
your spreadsheet. You may have noticed that when you try to perform 
an action on a large formula-intensive dataset, Excel is slow to respond, 
giving you a Calculating indicator in the status bar. The larger your data­
set is, the less efficient the data crunching in Excel is.
	
✓	Large datasets can cause difficulty in scalability. Imagine that you’re 
working in a small company and you’re using monthly transactions in 
your data model. Each month holds 80,000 lines of data. As time goes 
on, you build a robust process complete with all the formulas, pivot 
tables, and macros you need to analyze the data that’s stored in your 
neatly maintained tab. Now what happens after one year? Do you start 
a new tab? How do you analyze two datasets on two different tabs as 
one entity? Are your formulas still good? Do you have to write new 
macros?
These are all issues that can be avoided by importing only aggregated and 
summarized data that’s useful to the core purpose of your reporting needs.
Using tabs to document and 
organize your data model
Wanting to keep your data model limited to one worksheet tab is natural. In 
my mind, keeping track of one tab is much simpler than using different tabs. 
However, limiting your data model to one tab has its drawbacks, including 
the following:
	
✓	Using one tab typically places limits on your analysis. Because only 
so many datasets can fit on a tab, using one tab limits the number of 
analyses that can be represented in your data model. This in turn limits 
the analysis your dashboard can offer. Consider adding tabs to your data 
model to provide additional data and analysis that may not fit on just 
one tab.

30
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
	
✓	Too much on one tab makes for a confusing data model. When work­
ing with large datasets, you need plenty of staging tables to aggregate 
and shape the raw data so that it can be fed to your reporting compo­
nents. If you use only one tab, you’re forced to position these staging 
tables below or to the right of your datasets. Although this may provide 
all the elements needed to feed your presentation layer, a good deal 
of scrolling is necessary to view all the elements positioned in a wide 
range of areas. This makes the data model difficult to understand and 
maintain. Use separate tabs to hold your analysis and staging tables, 
particularly in data models that contain large datasets occupying a lot 
of real estate.
	
✓	Using one tab limits the amount of documentation you can include. 
You’ll find that your data models easily become a complex system of 
intertwining links among components, input ranges, output ranges, and 
formulas. Sure, it all makes sense while you’re building your data model, 
but try coming back to it after a few months. You’ll find you’ve forgot­
ten what each data range does and how each range interacts with the 
final presentation layer. To avoid this problem, consider adding a model 
map tab to your data model. The model map tab essentially summarizes 
the key ranges in the data model and allows you to document how each 
range interacts with the reporting components in the final presentation 
layer. As you can see in Figure 2-6 the model map is nothing fancy, just a 
table that lists some key information about each range in the model.
You can include any information you think appropriate in your model map. 
The idea is to give yourself a handy reference that guides you through the 
elements in your data model.

map allows 
you to docu-
ment how

 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
Testing your data model before building 
reporting components on top of it
This best practice is simple. Make sure your data model does what it’s sup­
posed to do before building dashboard components on top of it. In that vein, 
here are a few things to watch for:
	
✓	Test your formulas to ensure they’re working properly: Make sure 
your formulas don’t produce errors and that each formula outputs 
expected results.
	
✓	Double-check your main dataset to ensure it’s complete: Check that 
your data table has not truncated when transferring to Excel. Also, be 
sure that each column of data is present with appropriate data labels.
	
✓	Make sure all numeric formatting is appropriate: Be sure that the 
formatting of your data is appropriate for the field. For example, check 
to see that dates are formatted as dates, currency values are formatted 
properly, and that the correct number of decimal places is displayed 
where needed.
The obvious goal here is to eliminate easily avoidable errors that may cause 
complications later.
Speaking of documenting your data model . . .
Another way to document the logic in your data 
model is to use comments and labels liberally. 
It’s amazing how a few explanatory comments 
and labels can help clarify your spreadsheets. 
The general idea here is that the logic in your 
model should be clear to you even after you’ve 
been away from your data model for a long time.
Also, consider using colors to identify the 
ranges in your data model. Using colors in 
your data model enables you to quickly look 
at a range of cells and get a basic indication 
of what that range does. The general concept 
behind this best practice is that each color rep­
resents a range type. For example, you could 
use yellow to represent staging tables used to 
feed the charts and the tables in your presenta­
tion layer. You could use gray to represent for­
mulas that aren’t to be altered or touched, or 
purple to represent reference tables used for 
lookups and drop-down lists.
You can use any color you want; it’s up to you to 
give these colors meaning. The important thing 
is that you have a visual distinction between the 
various ranges being used in your data model.

Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
Excel Functions That Really Deliver
As you discover in this chapter, the optimal data model for any reporting 
mechanism is one in which data, analysis, and presentation are separated 
into three layers. Although all three layers are important, the analysis layer is 
where the real art comes into play. The fundamental task of the analysis layer 
is to pull information from the data layer and then create staging tables that 
feed your charts, tables, and other reporting components. To do this effec­
tively, you need to employ formulas that serve as data delivery 
mechanisms — formulas that deliver data to a destination range.
You see, the information you need lives in your data layer (typically a table 
containing aggregated data). Data delivery formulas are designed to get that 
data and deliver it to the analysis layer so it can be analyzed and shaped. The 
cool thing is that after you’ve set up you data delivery formulas, your analy­
sis layer automatically updates each time your data layer is refreshed.
Confused? Don’t worry — in this section, I show you a few Excel functions 
that work particularly well in data delivery formulas. As you go through the 
examples here, you’ll start to see how these concepts come together.
The VLOOKUP function
The VLOOKUP function is the king of all lookup functions in Excel. I’d be willing 
to bet you’ve at least heard of VLOOKUP, if not used it a few times yourself. 
The purpose of VLOOKUP is to find a specific value from a column of data 
where the leftmost row value matches a given criterion.
VLOOKUP basics
Take a look at Figure 2-7 to get the general idea. The table on the left shows 
sales by month and product number. The bottom table translates those prod­
uct numbers to actual product names. The VLOOKUP function can help in 
associating the appropriate name to each respective product number.
To understand how VLOOKUP formulas work, take a moment to review the 
basic syntax. A VLOOKUP formula requires four arguments:
VLOOKUP(Lookup_value, Table_array, Col_index_num, Range_lookup)
Lookup_value: The Lookup_value argument identifies the value being 
looked up. This is the value that needs to be matched to the lookup table. 
In the example in Figure 2-7, the Lookup_value is the product number. 
Therefore the first argument for all the formulas shown in Figure 2-7 
­references column C (the column that contains the product number).

33
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
Table_array: The Table_array argument specifies the range that 
contains the lookup values. In Figure 2-7, that range is D16:E22. Here are 
a couple points to keep in mind with this argument. First, for a VLOOKUP 
to work, the leftmost column of the table must be the matching value. For 
instance, if you’re trying to match product numbers, the leftmost column 
of the lookup table must contain product numbers. Second, notice that 
the reference used for this argument is an absolute reference. This means 
the column and row references are prefixed with dollar ($) signs — as 
in $D$16:$E$22. This ensures that the references don’t shift while you 
copy the formulas down or across.
Col_index_num: The Col_index_num argument identifies the column 
number in the lookup table that contains the value to be returned. In the 
example in Figure 2-7, the second column contains the product name 
(the value being looked up), so the formula uses the number 2. If the 
product name column was the fourth column in the lookup table, the 
number 4 would be used.
Range_lookup: The Range_lookup argument specifies whether you’re 
looking for an exact match or an approximate match. If an exact match is 
needed, you’d enter FALSE for this argument. If the closest match will do, 
you’d enter TRUE or leave the argument blank.
Applying VLOOKUP formulas in a data model
As you can imagine, there are countless ways to apply a VLOOKUP formula in 
your data model. No reason to start bland though. One of the more intriguing 
ways is to implement VLOOKUPs.
With a few VLOOKUP formulas and a simple drop-down list, you can create a 
data model that not only delivers data to the appropriate staging table, but 
allows you to dynamically change data views based on a selection you make. 
Figure 2-8 illustrates the setup.

In this 
example, the 
VLOOKUP 
function

look up the 
appropriate  
product 
names for 
each prodct  
number.

function to

shape data.
	
	
To see this effect in action, get the Chapter  2 Samples.xlsx workbook from 
this book’s companion website. Open that workbook to see a 
VLOOKUP1 tab.
The data layer in the model shown in Figure 2-8 resides in the range 
A9:F209. The analysis layer is held in range E2:F6. The data layer consists 
of all formulas that extract and shape the data as needed. As you can see, 
the VLOOKUP formulas use the Customer Name value in cell C3 to look up the 
appropriate data from the data layer. So, if you entered Chevron in cell C3, 
the VLOOKUP formulas would extract the data for Chevron.
	
You may have noticed that the VLOOKUP formulas in Figure 2-8 specify a 
Table_array argument of $C$9:$F$5000. This means that the lookup table 
they’re pointing to stretches from C9 to F5000. That seems strange because 
the table ends at F209. Why would you force your VLOOKUP formulas to look 
at a range far past the end of the data table?
Well, remember the idea behind separating the data layer and the analysis 
layer is so that your analysis layer can be automatically updated when your 
data is refreshed. When you get new data next month, you should be able 
to simply replace the data layer in the model without having to rework your 
analysis layer. Allowing for more rows than necessary in your VLOOKUP for­
mulas ensures that if your data layer grows, records won’t fall outside the 
lookup range of the formulas.

35
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
Later in this chapter, I show you how to automatically keep up with growing 
data tables by using smart tables.
Using data validation drop-down lists in your data model
In the example illustrated in Figure 2-8, the data model allows you to select 
customer names from a drop-down list when you click cell C3. The customer 
name serves as the lookup value for the VLOOKUP formulas. Changing the 
customer name extracts a new set of data from the data layer. This allows 
you to quickly switch from one customer to another without having to 
remember and type the customer name.
Now, as cool as this seems, the reasons for this setup aren’t all cosmetic. 
There are practical reasons for adding drop-down lists to your data models.
Many of your models consist of multiple analytical layers in which each 
shows a different set of analyses. Although each analysis layer is differ­
ent, they often need to revolve around a shared dimension, such as the 
same customer name, the same market, or the same region. For instance, 
when you have a data model that reports on Financials, Labor Statistics, 
and Operational Volumes, you want to make certain that when the model 
is reporting financials for the South region, the Labor Statistics are for the 
South region as well.
An effective way to ensure this happens is to force your formulas to use the 
same dimension references. If cell C3 is where you switch customers, every 
analysis that is customer-dependent should reference cell C3. Drop-down 
lists allow you to have a predefined list of valid variables located in a single 
cell. With a drop-down list, you can easily switch dimensions while building 
and testing multiple analysis layers.
Adding a drop-down list is relatively easy with Excel’s Data Validation func­
tionality. To add a drop-down list, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the Data tab on the Ribbon.
	
2.	Click the Data Validation button.
	
3.	Select the Settings tab in the newly activated Data Validation dialog 
box; see Figure 2-9.
	
4.	In the Allow drop-down list, choose List.
	
5.	In the Source input box, reference the range of cells that contain your 
predefined selection list.
	
6.	Click OK.

The HLookup function
The HLOOKUP function is the less popular cousin of the VLOOKUP function. 
The H in HLOOKUP stands for horizontal. Because Excel data is typically 
vertically oriented, most situations require a vertical lookup, or VLOOKUP. 
However, some data structures are horizontally oriented, requiring a hori­
zontal lookup; thus the HLOOKUP function comes in handy. The HLOOKUP 
searches a lookup table to find a single value from a row of data where the 
column label matches a given criterion.
HLOOKUP basics
Figure 2-10 demonstrates a typical scenario in which HLOOKUP formulas are 
used. The table in C5 requires quarter-end numbers (March and June) for 
2011. The HLOOKUP formulas use the column labels to find the correct month 
columns and then locate the 2011 data by moving down the appropriate 
number of rows. In this case, 2011 data is in row 4, so the number 4 is used in 
the formulas.
To get your mind around how this works, take a look at the basic syntax of 
the HLOOKUP function.
HLOOKUP(Lookup_value, Table_array, Row_index_num, Range_lookup)
Lookup_value: The Lookup_value argument identifies the value being 
looked up. In most cases, these values are column names. In the example 
in Figure 2-10, the column labels are being referenced for the Lookup_
value. This points the HLOOKUP function to the appropriate column in 
the lookup table.

37
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
Table_array: The Table_array argument identifies the range that 
contains the lookup table. In Figure 2-10, that range is B9:H12. Like the 
VLOOKUP examples earlier in this chapter, notice that the references 
used for this argument are absolute. This means the column and row 
references are prefixed with dollar ($) signs — as in $B$9:$H$12. This 
ensures that the reference doesn’t shift while you copy the formula down 
or across.
Row_index_num: The Row_index_num argument identifies the row 
number that contains the value you’re looking for. In the example 
in Figure 2-10, the 2011 data is located in row 4 of the lookup table. 
Therefore, the formulas use the number 4.
Range_lookup: The Range_lookup argument specifies whether you’re 
looking for an exact match or an approximate match. If an exact match is 
needed, you’d enter FALSE for this argument. If the closest match will do, 
you’d enter TRUE or leave the argument blank.
Applying HLOOKUP formulas in a data model
HLOOKUPs are especially handy for shaping data into structures appropriate 
for charting or other types of reporting. A simple example is demonstrated 
in Figure 2-11. With HLOOKUPs, the data shown in the raw data table at the 
bottom of the figure is reoriented in a staging table at the top. When the raw 
data is changed or refreshed, the staging table captures the changes.
The Sumproduct function
The SUMPRODUCT function is actually listed under the math and trigonometry 
category of Excel functions. Because the primary purpose of SUMPRODUCT is 
to calculate the sum product, most people don’t know you can actually use it 
to look up values. In fact, you can use this versatile function quite effectively 
in most data models.

March and 
June num-
bers from

38
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
SUMPRODUCT basics
The SUMPRODUCT function is designed to multiply values from two or more 
ranges of data and then add the results together to return the sum of the 
products. Take a look at Figure 2-12 to see a typical scenario in which the 
SUMPRODUCT is useful.
	
Figure 2-12: 
Without 
the SUM­
PRODUCT, 
getting 
the total 
sales for 
each year 
involves a 
two-step 
process: 
first multiply 
price and 
units and 
then sum 
the results.
	
	
Figure 2-11: 
In this 
example, 
HLOOKUP 
formulas pull 
and reshape 
data without 
disturbing 
the raw data 
table.
	

39
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
In Figure 2-12, you see a common analysis in which you need the total sales 
for the years 2011 and 2012. As you can see, to get the total sales for each 
year, you first have to multiply Price by the number of Units to get the total 
for each Region. Then you have to sum those results to get the total sales for 
each year.
With the SUMPRODUCT function, you can perform the two-step analysis with 
just one formula. Figure 2-13 shows the same analysis with SUMPRODUCT for­
mulas. Instead of using 11 formulas, you can accomplish the same analysis 
with just 3!
The syntax of the SUMPRODUCT function is fairly simple:
SUMPRODUCT(Array1, Array2, . . .)
Array: Array represents a range of data. You can use anywhere from 
2 to 255 arrays in a SUMPRODUCT formula. The arrays get multiplied 
together and then added. The only hard and fast rule you have to remem­
ber is that all the arrays must have the same number of values. That is to 
say, you can’t use the SUMPRODUCT if range X has 10 values and range Y 
has 11 values. Otherwise, you get the #VALUE! error.
A twist on the SUMPRODUCT function
The interesting thing about the SUMPRODUCT function is that it can be used to 
filter out values. Take a look at Figure 2-14 to see what I mean.
	
Figure 2-13: 
The SUM­
PRODUCT 
function 
allows you 
to perform 
the same 
analysis 
with just 3 
formulas 
instead 
of 11.
	

40
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
	
Figure 2-14: 
The SUM­
PRODUCT 
function can 
be used to 
filter data 
based on 
criteria.
	
The formula in cell E12 is pulling the sum of total units for just the North 
region. Meanwhile, cell E13 is pulling the units logged for the North region in 
the year 2011.
To understand how this works, take a look at the formula in cell E12 shown 
in Figure 2-14. That formula reads SUMPRODUCT((C3:C10="North")*
(E3:E10)).
In Excel, TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Every value in 
column C that equals North evaluates to TRUE or 1. Where the value is 
not North, it evaluates to FALSE or 0.The part of the formula that reads 
(C3:C10="North") enumerates through each value in the range C3:C10, 
assigning a 1 or 0 to each value. Then internally, the SUMPRODUCT formula 
translates to
(1*E3)+(0*E4)+(0*E5)+(0*E6)+(1*E7)+(0*E8)+(0*E9)+(0*E10).
This gives you the answer of 1628 because
(1*751)+(0*483)+(0*789)+(0*932)+(1*877)+(0*162)+(0*258)+(0*517)
equals 1628.
Applying SUMPRODUCT formulas in a data model
As always in Excel, you don’t have to hard-code the criteria in your formulas. 
Instead of explicitly using "North" in the SUMPRODUCT formula, you could 
reference a cell that contains the filter value. You can imagine that cell A3 

41
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
contains the word North, in which case you can use (C3:C10=A3) instead 
of (C3:C10="North"). This way, you can dynamically change your filter 
criteria, and your formula keeps up.
Figure 2-15 demonstrates how you can use this concept to pull data into a 
staging table based on multiple criteria. Note that each of the SUMPRODUCT 
formulas shown here reference cells B3 and C3 to filter on Account and 
Product Line. Again, you can add data validation drop-down lists to 
cells B3 and C3, allowing you to easily change criteria.
	
Figure 2-15: 
The SUM­
PRODUCT 
function can 
be used to 
pull sum-
marized 
numbers 
from the 
data layer 
into staging 
tables.
	
The Choose function
The CHOOSE function returns a value from a specified list of values based 
on a specified position number. For instance, if you enter the formulas 
CHOOSE(3, “Red”, “Yellow”, “Green”, “Blue”) into a cell, Excel 
returns Green because Green is the third item in the list of values. The for­
mula CHOOSE(1, “Red”, “Yellow”, “Green”, “Blue”) would return 
Red. Although this may not look useful on the surface, the CHOOSE function 
can dramatically enhance your data models.
CHOOSE basics
Figure 2-16 illustrates how CHOOSE formulas can help pinpoint and extract 
numbers from a range of cells. Note that instead of using hard-coded values, 
like Red, Green, and so on, you can use cell references to list the choices.

Figure 2-16: 
The 
CHOOSE 
function 
allows 
you to find 
values from 
a defined 
set of 
choices.
	
Take a moment to review the basic syntax of the CHOOSE function:
CHOOSE(Index_num, Value1, Value2, . . .)
Index_num: The Index_num argument specifies the position number 
of the chosen value in the list of values. If the third value in the list is 
needed, the Index_num is 3. The Index_num argument must be an inte­
ger between one and the maximum number of values in the defined list 
of values. That is to say, if there are ten choices defined in the CHOOSE 
formula, the Index_num argument can’t be more than ten.
Value: Each Value argument represents a choice in the defined list of 
choices for that CHOOSE formula. The Value> arguments can be hard-
coded values, cell references, defined names, formulas, or functions. You 
can have up to 255 choices listed in your CHOOSE formulas.
Applying CHOOSE formulas in a data model
The CHOOSE function is especially valuable in data models in which there 
are multiple layers of data that need to be brought together. Figure 2-17 
­illustrates an example in which CHOOSE formulas help pull data together.
In this example, you have two data tables: one for Revenues and one for Net 
Income. Each contains numbers for separate regions. The idea is to create a 
staging table that pulls data from both tables so that the data corresponds to 
a selected region.
To understand what’s going on, focus on the formula in cell F3, shown in 
Figure 2-17. The formula is CHOOSE($C$2,F7,F8,F9,F10). The Index_num 
argument is actually a cell reference that looks at the value in cell C2, which 
happens to be the number 2. As you can see, cell C2 is actually a VLOOKUP 
formula that pulls the appropriate index number for the selected region. 

43
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
The list of defined choices in the CHOOSE formula is essentially the cell refer­
ences that make up the revenue values for each region: F7, F8, F9, and F10. So 
the formula in cell F3 translates to CHOOSE(2, 27474, 41767, 18911, 
10590). The answer is 41,767.
	
Figure 2-17: 
The 
CHOOSE 
formulas 
ensure the 
appropriate 
data is syn-
chronously 
pulled from 
multiple 
data feeds.
	
Using Smart Tables That 
Expand with Data
One of the challenges you can encounter when building data models is a data 
table that expands over time. That is to say, the table grows in the number of 
records it holds due to new data being added. To get a basic understanding 
of this challenge, take a look at Figure 2-18. In this figure, you see a simple 
table that serves as the source for the chart. Notice that the table lists data 
for January through June.
Imagine that next month, this table expands to include July data. You’ll have 
to manually update your chart to include July data. Now imagine you had this 
same issue across your data model, with multiple data tables that link to mul­
tiple staging tables and dashboard components. You can imagine it’d be an 
extremely painful task to keep up with changes each month.
To solve this issue, you can use Excel’s Table feature (you can tell they spent 
all night coming up with that name). The Table feature allows you to convert 
a range of data into a defined table that’s treated independently of other rows 
and columns on the worksheet. After a range is converted to a table, Excel 
views the individual cells in the table as a single object with functionality that 
a typical data range doesn’t have.

44
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
	
Figure 2-18: 
The date 
in both the 
table and 
chart ends 
in June.
	
For instance, Excel tables offer the following features:
	
✓	They’re automatically enabled with autofilter drop-down headers so that 
you can filter and sort easily.
	
✓	They come with the ability to quickly add a Total row with various 
­aggregate functions.
	
✓	You can apply special formatting to Excel tables independent of the rest 
of the spreadsheet.
	
✓	Most importantly for data modeling purposes, they automatically 
expand to allow for new data.
	
The Table feature exists in Excel 2003 under a different name: the List feature 
(found in Excel’s Data menu). The benefit of this fact is that Excel Tables are 
fully compatible with Excel 2003 Lists.
Converting a range to an Excel table
To convert a range of data to an Excel table, follow these steps:
	
1.	Highlight the range of cells that contain the data you want included in 
your Excel table.
	
2.	On the Insert tab of the Ribbon, click the Table button.
	
	 This opens the Create Table dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-19.
	
3.	In the Create Table dialog box, verify the range for the table and 
specify whether the first row of the selected range is a header row.
	
4.	Click OK to apply the changes.

45
 Chapter 2: Building a Super Model
	
Figure 2-19: 
Converting 
a range of 
data to an 
Excel table.
	
After the conversion takes place, notice a few small changes. Excel put autofil­
ter drop-downs on your header rows, the rows in your table now have alternate 
shading, and any header that didn’t have a value has been named by Excel.
You can use Excel tables as the source for charts, pivot tables, list boxes, 
or anything else for which you’d typically use a data range. In Figure 2-20, 
a chart has been linked to the Excel table.
	
Figure 2-20: 
Excel tables 
can be 
used as 
the source 
for charts, 
pivot tables, 
named 
ranges, and 
so on.
	
Here’s the impressive bit. When data is added to the table, Excel automatically 
expands the range of the table and incorporates the new range into any linked 
object. That’s just a fancy way of saying that any chart or pivot table tied to an 
Excel table automatically captures new data without manual intervention.

46
Part I: Getting Started with Excel Dashboards and Reports 
For example, if I add July and August data to the end of the Excel table, the 
chart automatically updates to capture the new data. In Figure 2-21, I added 
July with no data and August with data to show you that the chart captures 
any new records and automatically plots the data given.
	
Figure 2-21: 
Excel tables 
automati-
cally expand 
when new 
data is 
added.
	
Take a moment to think about what Excel tables mean to a data model. They 
mean pivot tables that never have to be reconfigured, charts that automati­
cally capture new data, and ranges that automatically keep up with changes.
Converting an Excel table back to a range
If you want to convert an Excel table back to a range, you can follow these steps:
	
1.	Place your cursor in any cell inside the Excel table and select the 
Table Tools’ Design subtab on the Ribbon.
	
2.	Click the Convert to Range button, as shown in Figure 2-22.
	
3.	When asked if you’re sure (via a message box), click the Yes button.

T

he Excel table is the perfect way to consolidate and relay information. 
Data tables are very common — you’ll find one in any Excel report. And 
yet, the concept of making tables easier to read and more visually appealing 
escapes most of us.
Maybe it’s because the nicely structured rows and columns of a table lull us 
into believing that the data is already presented in the best way possible. 
Maybe the options of adding color and borders make the table seem nicely 
packaged. Excel makes table creation easy, but even so, you can use several 
design principles to make your Excel table a more effective platform for 
c­onveying your data.
In this chapter, you explore how easy it is to apply a handful of table design 
best practices. The tips found here ultimately help you create visually 
appealing tables that make the data within them easier to consume and 
comprehend.
Table Design Principles
Table design is one of the most underestimated endeavors in Excel ­reporting. 
How a table is designed has a direct effect on how well an audience absorbs 
and interprets the data in that table. Unfortunately, putting together a data 
table with an eye for economy and ease of consumption is an ­uncommon skill.

50
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Take for example the table shown in Figure 3-1. This table is similar to many 
found in Excel reports. The thick borders, the variety of colors, and the 
poorly formatted numbers are all unfortunate trademarks of tables that come 
from the average Excel analyst.
Figure 3-1: 
A poorly 
designed 
table.
Throughout this chapter, you improve upon this table by applying these four 
basic design principles:
	
✓	Use colors sparingly, reserving them only for information about key 
data points.
	
✓	De-emphasize borders, using the natural white space between your 
components to partition your dashboard.
	
✓	Use effective number formatting to avoid inundating your table with 
too much ink.
	
✓	Subdue your labels and headers.
Use colors sparingly
Color is most often used to separate the various sections of a table. The basic 
idea is that the colors applied to a table suggest the relationship between 
the rows and columns. The problem is that colors often distract and draw 
attention away from the important data. In addition, printed tables with dark-
colored cells are notoriously difficult to read (especially on black-and-white 
printers). They are also hard on the toner budget, if that holds any ­importance 
to you.

51
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
Colors in general should be used sparingly, reserved for providing informa­
tion about key data points. The headers, labels, and natural structure of your 
table are more than enough to guide your audience. There is no real need to 
add a layer of color as demarcation for your rows and columns.
Figure 3-2 shows the table from Figure 3-1 with the colors removed. As you 
can see, it’s already easier to read.
Figure 3-2: 
Remove 
unneces-
sary cell 
coloring.
If you’re working with a table that contains colored cells, you can quickly 
remove the color by highlighting the cells and choosing the No Fill option 
under the Theme Colors drop-down on the Home tab. See Figure 3-3.
	
Figure 3-3: 
Use the No 
Fill option 
to clear cell 
colors.
	

52
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
De-emphasize borders
Believe it or not, borders get in the way of quickly reading the data in a table. 
Because borders help separate data in nicely partitioned sections, this may 
seem counterintuitive, but the reality is that a table’s borders are the first 
thing your eyes see when you look at a table. Don’t believe it? Stand back a 
bit from an Excel table and squint. The borders will come popping out at you.
You should always endeavor to de-emphasize borders and gridlines wherever 
you can. Try to use the natural white space between the columns to parti­
tion sections. If borders are necessary, format them to lighter hues than your 
data; light grays are typically ideal. The idea is to indicate sections without 
distracting from the information displayed.
Figure 3-4 demonstrates these concepts with the table from Figure 3-1. Notice 
how the numbers are no longer caged in gridlines and that headings now 
jump out at you with the addition of Single Accounting underlines.
Figure 3-4: 
Minimize 
the use of 
borders 
and use 
the single 
accounting 
underlines 
to accent 
the column 
headers.
	
Single accounting underlines are different from the standard underlining 
you typically apply by pressing Ctrl+U on the keyboard. Standard underlines 
draw a line only as far as the text goes — that is to say, if you underline the 
word YES, standard underlines give you a line under the three letters. Single 
accounting underlines, on the other hand, draw a line across the entire 
column, regardless of how big or small the word is. This makes for a minimal, 
but apparent visual demarcation that calls out your column headers nicely.

53
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
To format your borders, highlight the cells you are working with, right-click, 
and select Format Cells. On the Border tab of the Format Cells dialog box, 
take the following steps as shown in Figure 3-5:
	
1.	Select an appropriate line thickness.
	
	 Typically, this means you should select the line with the lightest 
weight.
	
2.	Select an appropriate color.
	
	 Again, lighter hues are the best option.
	
3.	Use the border buttons to control where your borders are 
placed.
	
Figure 3-5: 
Use the 
Border 
tab of the 
Format Cells 
dialog box 
to ­customize 
your 
borders.
	
To apply the single accounting underline, right-click the column headings 
and select Format Cells. Click the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box and 
in the Underline drop-down menu, choose the Single Accounting option as 
­demonstrated in Figure 3-6.

Use effective number formatting
Every piece of information in your table should have a reason for being there. 
In an effort to clarify, tables often inundate the audience with superfluous 
ink that doesn’t add value to the information. For example, you’ll often see 
tables that show a number like $145.57 when a simple 145 would be just fine. 
Why include the extra decimal places, which serve only to add to the mass of 
numbers that your audience has to plow through?
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when applying formats to the 
­numbers in your table:
	
✓	Use decimal places only if that level of precision is required.
	
✓	In percentages, use only the minimum number of decimals required to 
represent the data effectively.
	
✓	Instead of using currency symbols (like $ or £), let your labels clarify 
that you are referring to monetary values.
	
✓	Format very large numbers to the thousands or millions place.
	
✓	Right-align numbers so that they are easier to read and compare.
Figure 3-7 shows the table from Figure 3-1 with appropriate number format­
ting applied. Notice that the large revenue and margin dollar amounts have 
been converted to the thousands place. In addition, the labels above the 
numbers now clearly indicate as such.

55
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
Figure 3-7: 
Use number 
formatting 
to eliminate 
clutter in 
your table 
and draw 
attention to 
key metrics.
The percentages have been truncated to show no decimal places. Also, the 
color coding draws attention to the Margin % column, the key metric in this 
table.
Amazingly, all of these improvements have been made simply with number 
formatting. That’s right; no formulas were used to convert large numbers to 
the thousands place, no conditional formatting was used to color code the 
Margin % field, and there were no other peripheral tricks of any kind.
Subdue your labels and headers
No one would argue that the labels and headers of a table aren’t important. 
On the contrary, they provide your audience with the guidance and structure 
needed to make sense of the data within. However, many of us have a habit of 
overemphasizing labels and headers to the point that they overshadow the 
data within the table. How many times have you seen bold or oversized font 
applied to headers? The reality is that your audience will benefit more with 
subdued labels.
De-emphasizing labels by formatting them to lighter hues actually makes the 
table easier to read and draws more attention to the data within the table. 
Lightly colored labels give your users the information they need without 
­distracting them from the information being presented. Ideal colors to use for 
labels are soft grays, light browns, soft blues, and greens.
Font size and alignment also factor in the effective display of tables. Aligning 
column headers to the same alignment as the numbers beneath them helps 
reinforce the column structures in your table. Keeping the font size of your 
labels close to that of the data within the table helps keep your eyes focused 
on the data — not the labels.

56
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Figure 3-8 illustrates how the original table from Figure 3-1 looks with 
­subdued headers and labels. Note how the data now becomes the focus, 
while the muted labels work in the background.
Figure 3-8: 
Send your 
labels and 
headers to 
the back-
ground by 
subduing 
their colors 
and keeping 
their font 
sizes in line 
with the 
data.
	
Sorting is another key factor in the readability of your data. Many tables sort 
based on labels (alphabetical by route for example). Sorting the table based 
on a key data point within the data helps establish a pattern your audience 
can use to quickly analyze the top and bottom values. Note in Figure 3-8 that 
the data has been sorted by the Revenue dollars. This again adds a layer of 
analysis, providing a quick look at the top and bottom generating routes.
After making all these improvements, you can see the before and after for the 
table in Figure 3-9. It’s difficult not to see how a few table design principles 
can greatly enhance your ability to present table driven data.

and after

table design 
principles.
	

57
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
	
If possible, consider using modern-looking fonts such as Calibri and Segoe UI 
in your reports and dashboards. Fonts such as Times New Roman or Arial can 
make your reports look old compared with the rounded edges of the more 
trendy fonts used now. This change in font perception is primarily driven by 
popular online sites that often use fonts with rounded edges.
Getting Fancy with Custom 
Number Formatting
You can apply number formatting to cells in several ways. Most people just use the 
convenient number commands found on the Home tab. By using these commands, 
you can quickly apply some default formatting (number, percent, currency, and so 
on) and just be done with it, but a better way is to use the Format Cells dialog box, 
in which you have the ability to create your own custom number formatting.
Number formatting basics
Follow these steps to apply basic number formatting:
	
1.	Right-click a range of cells and select Format Cells.
	
	 The Format Cells dialog box appears.
	
2.	Open the Number tab and choose a starting format that makes the 
most sense for your scenario.
	
	 In Figure 3-10, the format chosen is Number and the selected options are 
to use a comma separator, to include no decimal places, and to enclose 
negative numbers in parentheses.
	
Figure 3-10: 
Choose a 
base format.
	

58
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
3.	Click the Custom option as shown in Figure 3-11.
	
	 Excel takes you to a screen that exposes the syntax that makes up the 
format you selected. Here, you can edit the syntax in the Type input box 
to customize the number format.
	
Figure 3-11: 
The Type 
input box 
allows you 
to ­customize 
the syntax 
for the 
number 
format.
	
The number formatting syntax tells Excel how a number should look in 
­various scenarios. Number formatting syntax consists of different individual 
number formats separated by semicolons.
In this case, you see:
#,##0_);(#,##0)
Here you see two different formats: the format to the left of the semicolon, 
and the format to the right of the semicolon.
By default, any formatting to the left of the first semicolon is applied to posi­
tive numbers and any formatting to the right of the first semicolon is applied 
to negative numbers. So with this choice, negative numbers will be formatted 
with parentheses, whereas positive numbers will be formatted as a simple 
number, like
(1,890)
 1,982
	
Note that the syntax for the positive formatting in the previous example ends 
with _). This tells Excel to leave a space the width of a parenthesis charac­
ter at the end of positive numbers, which ensures that positive and negative 
­numbers align nicely when negative numbers are wrapped in parentheses.

59
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
You can edit the syntax in the Type input box so that the numbers are 
­formatted differently. For example, try changing the syntax to
+#,##0;-#,##0
When this syntax is applied, positive numbers will start with the + symbol 
and negative numbers will start with a – symbol. Like so:
+1,200
-15,000
This comes in handy when formatting percentages. For instance, you can 
apply a custom percent format by entering the following syntax into the 
Type input box:
+0%;-0%
This syntax gives you percentages that look like this:
+43%
-54%
You can get fancy and wrap your negative percentages with parentheses with 
this syntax:
0%_);(0%)
This syntax gives you percentages that look like this:
 43%
(54%)
	
If you include only one format syntax, meaning you don’t add a second format­
ting option with the use of a semicolon separator, that one format will be 
applied to all numbers — negative or positive.
Formatting numbers in thousands 
and millions
Earlier in this chapter, you format your revenue numbers to appear in 
­thousands. This allows us to present cleaner numbers and avoid inundating 
your audience with overlarge numbers. To show your numbers in thousands, 
highlight them, right-click, and select Format Cells.

60
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
After the Format Cells dialog box opens, click the Custom option to get to the 
screen shown in Figure 3-12.
	
Figure 3-12: 
Go to the 
Custom 
screen of 
the Format 
Cells dialog 
box.
	
In the Type input box, add a comma after the format syntax.
#,##0,
After confirming your changes, your numbers will automatically appear in the 
thousands place!
The beautiful thing here is that this technique doesn’t change the integrity or 
truncate your numeric values in any way. Excel is simply applying a cosmetic 
effect to the number. To see what this means, take a look at Figure 3-13.
	
Figure 3-13: 
Formatting 
numbers 
applies only 
a cosmetic 
look. Look in 
the formula 
bar to see 
the real, 
unformatted 
number.
	

61
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
The selected cell has been formatted to show in thousands; you see 118. 
But if you look in the formula bar above it, you’ll see the real unformatted 
number (117943.605787004). The 118 you are seeing in the cell is a cosmeti­
cally formatted version of the real number shown in the formula bar.
	
Custom number formatting has obvious advantages over using other tech­
niques to format numbers to thousands. For instance, many beginning 
­analysts would convert numbers to thousands by dividing them by 1,000 in 
a formula. But that changes the integrity of the number dramatically. When 
you perform a mathematical operation into a cell, you are literally ­changing 
the value represented in that cell. This forces you to carefully keep track 
of and maintain the formulas you introduced to simply achieve a cosmetic 
effect. Using custom number formatting avoids that by changing only how the 
number looks, keeping the actual number intact.
If needed, you can even indicate that the number is in thousands by adding 
"k" to the number syntax.
#,##0,"k"
This would show your numbers like this:
118k
318k
You can use this technique on both positive and negative numbers.
#,##0,"k"; (#,##0,"k")
After applying this syntax, your negative numbers also appear in thousands.
 118k
(318k)
Need to show numbers in millions? Easy. Simply add two commas to the 
number format syntax in the Type input box.
#,##0.00,, "m"
Note the use of the extra decimal places (.00). When converting numbers to 
millions, it’s often useful to show additional precision points, as in
24.65 m

62
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Hiding and suppressing zeroes
In addition to formatting positive and negative numbers, Excel allows you to 
provide a format for zeroes. You do this by adding another semicolon to your 
custom number syntax. By default, any format syntax placed after the second 
semicolon is applied to any number that evaluates to zero.
For example, the following syntax applies a format that shows n/a for any 
cells that contain zeroes.
#,##0_);(#,##0);"n/a"
You can also use this to suppress zeroes entirely. If you add the second 
­semicolon but don’t follow it with any syntax, cells containing zeroes will 
appear blank.
#,##0_);(#,##0);
Again, custom number formatting only affects the cosmetic look of the cell. 
The actual data in the cell is not affected. Figure 3-14 demonstrates this. The 
selected cell is formatted so that zeroes appear as n/a, but if you look at the 
formula bar, you can see the actual unformatted cell contents.
	
Figure 3-14: 
Custom 
number 
formatting 
that shows 
zeroes as 
n/a.
	
Applying custom format colors
Have you ever set the formatting on a cell so that negative numbers appear 
red? If you have, you essentially applied a custom format color. In addition 
to controlling the look of your numbers with custom number formatting, you 
can also control their color.

63
 Chapter 3: Dressing Up Your Data Tables
In this example, you format the percentages so that positive percentages 
appear blue with a + symbol, whereas negative percentages appear red with 
a – symbol. Enter this syntax in the Type input box shown in Figure 3-11.
[Blue]+0%;[Red]-0%
Notice that all it takes to apply a color is to enter the color name wrapped in 
square brackets [ ].
Now, there are only certain colors — the eight Visual Basic colors — you can 
call out by name like this. These colors make up the first eight colors of the 
default Excel color pallet:
[Black]
[Blue]
[Cyan]
[Green]
[Magenta]
[Red]
[White]
[Yellow]
Formatting dates and times
Custom number formatting isn’t just for numbers. You can also format dates 
and times. As you can see in Figure 3-15, you use the same dialog box to 
apply date and time formats using the Type input box.
	
Figure 3-15: 
Dates and 
times can 
also be 
formatted 
using the 
Format Cells 
dialog box.
	

64
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Figure 3-15 demonstrates that date and time formatting involves little more 
than stringing date-specific or time-specific syntax together. The syntax used 
is fairly intuitive. For example, ddd is the syntax for the three-letter day, 
mmm is the syntax for the three-letter month, and yyyy is the syntax for the 
four-digit year.
There are several variations on the format for days, months, years, hours, 
and minutes. It’s worthwhile to take some time and experiment with different 
combinations of syntax strings.
Table 3-1 lists some common date and time format codes you can use as 
starter syntax for your reports and dashboards.

his chapter introduces you to sparklines. These magically named visual­
izations are essentially mini word-sized charts placed in and among the 
textual data in tables. Sparklines enable you to see trends and patterns within 
your data at a glance using minimal real estate on your dashboard.
Before getting into the nuts and bolts of using sparklines, it’s important to 
understand just how they can enhance your reporting. This chapter introduces 
you to the concept of sparklines and then shows you how to customize and 
add them to your tables.
Introducing Sparklines
As mentioned in Chapter 3, much of the reporting done in Excel is table-based, 
in which precise numbers are more important than pretty charts. However, 
in table-based reporting, you often lose the ability to show important aspects 
of the data such as trends. The number of columns needed to show adequate 
trend data in a table makes it impractical to do so. Any attempt to add trend 
data to a table usually does nothing more than render your report unreadable.
Take the example in Figure 4-1. The data here represents a compact KPI (key 
performance indicator) summary designed to be an at-a-glance view of key 
metrics. Although the table compares various time periods (in columns D, E, 
and F), it does so only by averaging, which tells us nothing about trends over 
time. It quickly becomes evident that seeing a full year trend would be helpful.

Figure 4-1: 
Although 
this KPI 
summary 
is useful, it 
lacks the 
ability show 
a full-year 
trend.
	
Figure 4-2 illustrates the same KPI summary with Excel sparklines added to 
visually show the 12-month trend. With the sparklines added, you can see 
the broader story behind each metric. For example, based solely on the 
numbers, the Passengers metric appears to be slightly up from the average. 
But the sparkline tells the story of a heroic comeback from a huge hit at 
the beginning of the year.
	
Figure 4-2: 
Sparklines

add trending 
in a com-
pact space, 
enabling 
you to see 
a broader 
picture for 
each metric.
	
Again, it’s not about adding flash and pizzaz to your tables. It’s about building 
the most effective message in the limited space you have. Sparklines are 
another tool you can use to add another dimension to your table-based reports.

67
 Chapter 4: Sparking Inspiration with Sparklines
	
Sparklines are available only with Excel 2010 and Excel 2013. If you open a 
workbook with sparklines using a previous version of Excel, the sparkline 
cells will be empty. If your organization is not fully using Excel 2010 or 2013, 
you may want to search for alternatives to the built-in Excel sparklines. Many 
third-party add-ins bring sparkline features to earlier versions of Excel. Some 
of these products support additional sparkline types, and most have custom­
ization options. Search the web for sparklines excel, and you’ll find several 
add-ins to choose from.
Understanding Sparklines
Although sparklines look like miniature charts (and can sometimes take the 
place of a chart), this feature is completely separate from the Excel chart 
feature (covered in Chapters 7, 8, and 9 of this book). For example, charts are 
placed on a worksheet’s drawing layer, and a single chart can display several 
series of data. In contrast, a sparkline is displayed inside of a worksheet cell, 
and displays only one series of data.
Excel 2013 supports three types of sparklines: Line, Column, and Win/Loss. 
Figure 4-3 shows examples of each type of sparkline graphic, displayed in 
column H. Each sparkline depicts the six data points to the left.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Three 
types of 
sparklines.
	

68
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
✓	Line: Similar to a line chart, the Line type of sparkline can appear with 
or without a marker for each data point. The first group in Figure 4-3 
shows Line sparklines with markers. A quick glance reveals that with the 
exception of Fund Number W-91, the funds have been losing value over 
the six-month period.
	
✓	Column: Similar to a column chart, the second group shows the same 
data with Column sparklines.
	
✓	Win/Loss: A Win/Loss sparkline is a binary-type chart that displays each 
data point as a high block or a low block. The third group shows Win/
Loss sparklines. Notice that the data is different. Each cell displays the 
change from the previous month. In the sparkline, each data point is 
depicted as a high block (win) or a low block (loss). In this example, a 
positive change from the previous month is a win, and a negative change 
from the previous month is a loss.
Creating sparklines
Figure 4-4 shows some weather data that you can summarize with sparklines. To 
create sparkline graphics for the values in these nine rows, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the data range that you want to summarize. In this example, 
select B4:M12.
	
	 If you are creating multiple sparklines, select all the data.
	
Figure 4-4: 
Data that 
you want 
to sum-
marize with 
sparkline 
graphics.
	
	
2.	With the data selected, click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and find the 
Sparklines group. There, select any one of the three sparkline types: 
Line, Column, or Win/Loss. In this case, select the Column option.
	
	 Excel displays the Create Sparklines dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5.

69
 Chapter 4: Sparking Inspiration with Sparklines
	
Figure 4-5: 
Use the 
Create 
Sparklines 
dialog box 
to specify 
the data 
range and 
the loca-
tion for the 
sparkline 
graphics.
	
	
3.	Specify the data range and the location for the sparklines. For this 
example, specify N4:N12 as the Location Range.
	
	 Typically, you’ll put the sparklines next to the data, but that’s not 
required. Most of the time, you’ll use an empty range to hold the spar­
klines. However, Excel does not prevent you from inserting sparklines 
into filled-in cells. The sparkline location that you specify must match 
the source data in terms of number of rows or number of columns.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 Excel creates the sparklines graphics of the type you specified, as shown 
in Figure 4-6.
	
	 The sparklines are linked to the data, so if you change any of the values 
in the data range, the sparkline graphic will update.
	
Figure 4-6: 
Column 
sparklines

the precipi-
tation data

cities.
	

70
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Most of the time, you’ll create sparklines on the same sheet that contains the 
data. If you want to create sparklines on a different sheet, start by activating 
the sheet where the sparklines will be displayed. Then, in the Create Sparklines 
dialog box, specify the source data either by selecting the cell range or by 
typing the complete sheet reference (for example, Sheet1!A1:C12). The Create 
Sparklines dialog box lets you specify a different sheet for the Data Range, but 
not for the Location Range.
Understanding sparkline groups
Most of the time, you’ll probably create a group of sparklines — one for each 
row or column of data. A worksheet can hold any number of sparkline groups. 
Excel remembers each group, and you can work with the group as a single 
unit. For example, you can select one sparkline in a group and then modify 
the formatting of all sparklines in the group. When you select one sparkline 
cell, Excel displays an outline of all the other sparklines in the group.
You can, however, perform some operations on an individual sparkline 
in a group:
	
✓	Change the sparkline’s data source. Click the sparkline cell and go 
to the Sparkline Tools tab on the Ribbon. There you can click 
Design➪Sparkline➪Edit Data➪Edit Single Sparkline’s Data. Excel displays 
a dialog box that lets you change the data source for the selected 
sparkline.
	
✓	Delete the sparkline. Click the sparkline, click the Sparkline Tools tab 
on the Ribbon, and then select Design➪Group➪Clear➪Clear Selected 
Sparklines.
Both of these operations are available from the shortcut menu that appears 
when you right-click a sparkline cell.
You can also ungroup a set of sparklines. Select any sparkline in the group 
and select Design➪Group➪Ungroup from the Sparkline Tools tab. After you 
ungroup a set of sparklines, you can work with each sparkline individually.
	
You can add a new sparkline to an existing group by first selecting any sparkline 
in the existing group, and then selecting Design➪Edit Data➪Edit Group Location 
& Data. This activates the Edit Sparklines dialog box. Simply edit the Data Range 
and Location Range to include the new data you want added.

71
 Chapter 4: Sparking Inspiration with Sparklines
Customizing Sparklines
When you activate a cell that contains a sparkline, Excel displays an outline 
around all the sparklines in its group. You can then use the commands on the 
Sparkline Tools➪Design tab to customize the group of sparklines.
Sizing and merging sparkline cells
When you change the width or height of a cell that contains a sparkline, the 
sparkline adjusts to fill the new cell size. In addition, you can put a sparkline 
into merged cells. To merge cells, select at least two cells and choose 
Home➪Alignment➪Merge & Center.
Figure 4-7 shows the same sparkline displayed at four sizes resulting from 
changing column width and row height, and from merging cells.
	
Figure 4-7: 
A sparkline 
at various 
sizes.
	
It’s important to note that a skewed aspect ratio can distort your visualizations, 
exaggerating the trend in sparklines that are too tall, and flattening the trend in 
sparklines that are too wide. Generally speaking, the most appropriate aspect 
ratio for a chart is one where the width of the chart is about twice as long as 
the height. In Figure 4-7, the sparkline with the most appropriate aspect ratio is 
the one located in cell M4.
	
If you merge cells, and the merged cells occupy more than one row or one 
column, Excel won’t let you insert a group of sparklines into those merged 
cells. Rather, you need to insert the sparklines into a normal range (with no 
merged cells), and then merge the cells.

72
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
You can also put a sparkline in non-empty cells, including merged cells. 
Figure 4-8 shows two sparklines that occupy merged cells alongside text that 
describes the graphics.
Figure 4-8: 
Sparklines 
in merged 
cells (E2:I7 
and E9:I14).
Handling hidden or missing data
In some cases, you just want to present a sparkline visualization without the 
numbers. One way to do this is to hide the rows or columns that contain 
the data. Figure 4-9 shows a table with the values displayed, and the same 
table with the values hidden (by hiding the columns).
Figure 4-9: 
Sparklines 
can use 
data in 
hidden rows 
or columns.
By default, if you hide rows or columns that contain data used in a sparkline 
graphic, the hidden data does not appear in the sparkline. In addition, blank 
cells are displayed as a gap in the graphic.
To change these default settings, go to the Sparkline Tools tab on the Ribbon, 
and select Design➪Sparkline➪Edit Data➪Hidden & Empty Cells. In the 
Hidden and Empty Cell Settings dialog box, specify how to handle hidden 
data and empty cells.

73
 Chapter 4: Sparking Inspiration with Sparklines
Changing the sparkline type
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Excel supports three sparkline types: Line, 
Column, and Win/Loss. After you create a sparkline or group of sparklines, you 
can easily change the type by clicking the sparkline and selecting one of the 
three icons located under Sparkline Tools➪Design➪Type. If the selected spar­
kline is part of a group, all sparklines in the group are changed to the new type.
	
If you’ve customized the appearance, Excel remembers your customization 
settings for each sparkline type if you switch among different sparkline types.
Changing sparkline colors and line width
After you create a sparkline, changing the color is easy. Simply click the 
sparkline, click to open the Sparkline Tools tab on the Ribbon, and select 
Design➪Style. There you find various options to change the color and style of 
your sparkline.
For Line sparklines, you can also specify the line width. Choose Sparkline 
Tools➪Design➪Style➪Sparkline Color➪Weight.
	
Colors used in sparkline graphics are tied to the document theme. If you 
change the theme (by choosing Page Layout➪Themes➪Themes), the 
sparkline colors then change to the new theme colors.
Using color to emphasize key data points
Use the commands under Sparkline Tools➪Design➪Show to customize the 
sparklines to emphasize key aspects of the data. The options in the Show 
group are:
	
✓	High Point: Apply a different color to the highest data point in the 
sparkline.
	
✓	Low Point: Apply a different color to the lowest data point in the 
sparkline.
	
✓	Negative Points: Apply a different color to negative values in the 
sparkline.
	
✓	First Point: Apply a different color to the first data point in the sparkline.
	
✓	Last Point: Apply a different color to the last data point in the sparkline.
	
✓	Markers: Show data markers in the sparkline. This option is available 
only for Line sparklines.

74
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
You can control the color of the sparkline by using the Marker Color control 
in the Sparkline Tools➪Design➪Style group. Unfortunately, you cannot 
change the size of the markers in Line sparklines.
Adjusting sparkline axis scaling
When you create one or more sparklines, they all use (by default) automatic 
axis scaling. In other words, Excel determines the minimum and maximum 
vertical axis values for each sparkline in the group based on the numeric 
range of the sparkline data.
The Sparkline Tools➪Design➪Group➪Axis command lets you override this 
automatic behavior and control the minimum and maximum value for each 
sparkline, or for a group of sparklines. For even more control, you can use 
the Custom Value option and specify the minimum and maximum for the 
sparkline group.
Axis scaling can make a huge difference in the sparklines. Figure 4-10 
shows two groups of sparklines. The group at the top uses the default axis 
settings (Automatic For Each Sparkline option). Each sparkline in this group 
shows the six-month trend for the product, but there is no indication of the 
magnitude of the values.
	
Figure 4-10: 
The bottom 
group of 
sparklines 
shows the 
effect of 
using the 
same axis 
minimum 
and maxi-
mum values 
for all spar-
klines in a 
group.
	
The sparkline group at the bottom (which uses the same data), uses the Same 
For All Sparklines setting for the minimum and maximum axis values. With 
these settings in effect, the magnitude of the values across the products is 
apparent — but the trend across the months within a product is not apparent.

75
 Chapter 4: Sparking Inspiration with Sparklines
The axis scaling option you choose depends upon what aspect of the data 
you want to emphasize.
Faking a reference line
One useful feature that’s missing in the Excel 2013 implementation of 
sparklines is a reference line. For example, it might be useful to show 
performance relative to a goal. If the goal is displayed as a reference line in a 
sparkline, the viewer can quickly see whether the performance for a period 
exceeded the goal.
One approach is to write formulas that transform the data and then use 
a sparkline axis as a fake reference line. Figure 4-11 shows an example. 
Students have a monthly reading goal of 500 pages. The range of data shows 
the actual pages read, with sparklines in column H. The sparklines show the 
six-month page data, but it’s impossible to tell who exceeded the goal, and 
when they did it.
	
Figure 4-11: 
Sparklines 
display the 
number of 
pages read 
per month.
	
The lower set of sparklines in Figure 4-12 shows another approach: Transforming 
the data such that meeting the goal is expressed as a 1, and failing to meet the 
goal is expressed as a -1. The following formula (in cell B18) transforms the 
original data:
=IF(B6>$C$2,1,-1)

76
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 4-12: 
Using Win/
Loss spar-
klines to 
display goal 
status.
	
This formula was copied to the other cells in B18:G25 range.
Using the transformed data, Win/Loss sparklines are used to visualize the 
results. This approach is better than the original, but it doesn’t convey any 
magnitude differences. For example, you cannot tell whether the student 
missed the goal by 1 page or by 500 pages.
Figure 4-13 shows a better approach. Here, the original data is transformed 
by subtracting the goal from the pages read. The formula in cell B30 is:
=B6-C$2
	
Figure 4-13: 
The axis in 
the spar-
klines rep-
resents the 
goal.
	

77
 Chapter 4: Sparking Inspiration with Sparklines
This formula was copied to the other cells in the B30:G37 range, and a group 
of Line sparklines display the resulting values. This group has the Show Axis 
setting enabled, and also uses Negative Point markers so the negative values 
(failure to meet the goal) clearly stand out.
Specifying a date axis
By default, data displayed in a sparkline is assumed to be at equal intervals. 
For example, a sparkline might display a daily account balance, sales by 
month, or profits by year. But what if the data aren’t at equal intervals?
Figure 4-14 shows data, by date, along with a sparklines graphic created from 
column B. Notice that some dates are missing, but the sparkline shows the 
columns as if the values were spaced at equal intervals.
	
Figure 4-14: 
The spar-
kline dis-
plays the 
values as if 
they are at 
equal time 
intervals.
	
To better depict this type of time-based data, the solution is to specify a date axis. 
Select the sparkline and choose Sparkline Tools➪Design➪Group➪Axis➪Date 
Axis Type.
Excel displays a dialog box asking for the range that contains the corresponding 
dates. In this example, specify range A2:A11.
Click OK, and the sparkline displays gaps for the missing dates, as shown in 
Figure 4-15.

78
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 4-15: 
After speci-
fying a date 
axis, the 
sparkline 
shows 
the values 
accurately.
	
Autoupdating sparkline ranges
If a sparkline uses data in a normal range of cells, adding new data to the 
beginning or end of the range does not force the sparkline to use the new 
data. You need to use the Edit Sparklines dialog box to update the data range 
(Sparkline Tools➪Design➪Sparkline➪Edit Data).
However, if the sparkline data is in a column within a table object (created 
using Insert➪Tables➪Table as described in Chapter 2), then the sparkline uses 
new data that’s added to the end of the table without requiring an update.
Figure 4-16 shows an example. The sparkline was created using the data in 
the Rate column of the table. When you add the new rate for September, the 
sparkline automatically updates its data range.

to Visualizations
In This Chapter

▶	Working with symbols in formulas
▶	Using the Camera tool

Visualization is the presentation of abstract concepts or data in visual terms 
through some sort of graphical imagery. A traffic light, for example, is a 
visualization of the abstract concepts of stop and go.
In the business world, visualizations help us communication and process the 
meaning of data faster than simple tables of numbers. Excel offers business 
analysts a wide array of features that can be used to add visualizations to 
dashboards and reports.
In this chapter, you explore some of the formatting techniques you can leverage 
to add layers of visualizations that can turn your data into meaningful views.
Enhancing Reports with 
Conditional Formatting
Conditional formatting is the term given to Excel’s capability to dynamically 
change the formatting of a value, cell, or range of cells based on a set of con­
ditions you define. Conditional formatting adds a level of visualization that 
allows you to look at your Excel reports and make split-second determinations 
on which values are “good” and which are “bad,” simply based on formatting.

80
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
In this section, you are introduced to the world of conditional formatting, 
learning how to leverage this functionality to enhance your reports and 
dashboards.
Applying basic conditional formatting
Thanks to the many pre-defined scenarios offered with Excel 2013, you can 
apply some basic conditional formatting with a few clicks of the mouse. To 
get a first taste of what you can do, click the Conditional Formatting button 
found on the Home tab of the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 5-1.
	
Figure 5-1: 
The 
pre-defined 
conditional 
formatting 
scenarios 
available in 
Excel.
	
As you can see, there are five categories of pre-defined scenarios: Highlight 
Cells Rules, Top/Bottom Rules, Data Bars, Color Scales, and Icon Sets.
Take a moment to review what each category of pre-defined scenarios allows 
you to do.
Using the Highlight Cells Rules
The formatting scenarios under the Highlight Cells Rules category, shown 
in Figure 5-2, allow you to highlight those cells whose values meet a specific 
condition.
The thing to remember about these scenarios is that they work very much 
like an IF ... THEN ... ELSE statement. That is to say, if the condition 
is met, the cell is formatted and if the condition is not met, the cell remains 
untouched.

81
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
	
Figure 5-2: 
The 
Highlight 
Cells Rules 
scenarios 
apply 
formats if 
specific 
conditions 
are met.
	
The scenarios under the Highlight Cells Rules category are pretty self-explanatory. 
Here is a breakdown of each scenario:
	
✓	Greater Than: This scenario allows you to conditionally format a cell 
whose value is greater than a specified amount. For instance, you can 
tell Excel to format those cells that contain a value greater than 50.
	
✓	Less Than: This scenario allows you to conditionally format a cell whose 
value is less than a specified amount. For instance, you can tell Excel to 
format those cells that contain a value less than 100.
	
✓	Between: This scenario allows you to conditionally format a cell whose 
value is between two given amounts. For example, you can tell Excel to 
format those cells that contain a value between 50 and 100.
	
✓	Equal To: This scenario allows you to conditionally format a cell whose 
value is equal to a given amount. For example, you can tell Excel to 
format those cells that contain a value that is exactly 50.
	
✓	Text That Contains: This scenario allows you to conditionally format a cell 
whose contents contain any form of a given text you specify as a criterion. For 
example, you can tell Excel to format those cells that contain the text “North.”
	
✓	A Date Occurring: This scenario allows you to conditionally format a 
cell whose contents contain a date occurring in a specified period rela­
tive to today’s date. For example, Yesterday, Last Week, Last Month, Next 
Month, Next Week, and so on.
	
✓	Duplicate Values: This scenario allows you to conditionally format both 
duplicate values and unique values in a given range of cells. This rule 
was designed more for data cleanup than dashboarding, enabling you to 
quickly identify either duplicates or unique values in your dataset.
Take a moment to go through an example of how to apply one of these scenarios. 
In this simple example, you highlight all values greater than a certain amount.

82
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
1.	Start by selecting the range of cells to which you need to apply the 
conditional formatting.
	
2.	Choose the Greater Than scenario found under the Highlight Cells 
Rules category shown in Figure 5-2.
	
	 This opens the dialog box shown in Figure 5-3. In this dialog box, the 
idea is to define a value that will trigger the conditional formatting.
	
Figure 5-3: 
Each 
scenario 
has its own 
dialog box 
you can use 
to define 
the trigger 
values and 
the format 
for each 
rule.
	
	
3.	  Either type the value (400 in this example) or reference a cell that 
contains the trigger value. Also in this dialog box, use the drop-down 
box to specify the format you want applied.
	
4.	  Click the OK button.
	
	 Immediately, Excel applies the formatting rule to the selected cells; see 
Figure 5-4.
	
Figure 5-4: 
Cells 
greater 
than 400 are 
formatted.
	

83
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
The benefit of a conditional formatting rule is that Excel automatically reevalu­
ates the rule each time a cell is changed (provided that cell has a conditional 
formatting rule applied to it). For instance, if I were to change any of the 
low values to 450, the formatting for that value would automatically change 
because all of the cells in the dataset have the formatting applied to it.
Applying Top/Bottom Rules
The formatting scenarios under the Top/Bottom Rules category, shown in 
Figure 5-5, allow you to highlight those cells whose values meet a given threshold.
	
Figure 5-5: 
The Top/
Bottom 
Rules 
scenarios 
apply 
formats if 
specific 
thresholds 
are met.
	
Like the Highlight Cells Rules, these scenarios work like IF ... THEN ... 
ELSE statements — meaning, if the condition is met, the cell is formatted, 
and if the condition is not met, the cell remains untouched.
Here is a breakdown of each scenario under the Top/Bottom Rules category:
	
✓	Top 10 Items: Although the name doesn’t suggest it, this scenario allows 
you to specify any number of cells to highlight based on individual cell 
values (not just ten). For example, you can highlight the top five cells 
whose values are among the five largest numbers of all the cells selected.
	
✓	Top 10 %: This scenario is similar to the Top 10 Items scenario: Only 
the selected cells are evaluated on a percentage basis. Again, don’t let 
the name fool you; the percent selection does not have to be ten. For 
instance, you can highlight the cells whose values make up the top 20% 
of the total values of all the selected cells.
	
✓	Bottom 10 Items: This scenario allows you to specify the number of cells 
to highlight based on the lowest individual cell values. Again, don’t let 
the name fool you: You can specify any number of cells to highlight — not 
just ten. For example, you can highlight the bottom 15 cells whose values 
are within the 15 smallest numbers among all the cells selected.

84
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
✓	Bottom 10 %: This scenario is similar to the Bottom 10 Items scenario. 
However, in this scenario, only the selected cells are evaluated on a 
percentage basis. For instance, you can highlight the cells whose values 
make up the bottom 15% of the total values of all the selected cells.
	
✓	Above Average: This scenario allows you to conditionally format each 
cell whose value is above the average of all cells selected.
	
✓	Below Average: Allows you to conditionally format each cell whose 
value is below the average of all cells selected.
	
To avoid overlapping different conditional formatting scenarios, you may want 
to clear any conditional formatting you’ve previously applied before applying 
a new scenario. To clear the conditional formatting for a given range of cells, 
select the cells and select Conditional Formatting from the Home tab of the 
Ribbon. Here you find the Clear Rules selection. Click Clear Rules and select 
whether you want to clear conditional formatting for the entire sheet or only 
the selected workbook.
In the following example, you conditionally format all cells whose values are 
within the top 40% of the total values of all cells.
	
1.	Start by selecting the range of cells to which you need to apply the 
conditional formatting.
	
2.	Choose the Top 10 % scenario found under the Top/Bottom Rules 
category; refer to Figure 5-5.
	
	 This opens the Top 10% dialog box shown in Figure 5-6. The idea here is 
to define the threshold that that will trigger the conditional formatting.
	
Figure 5-6: 
Each 
­scenario 
has its own 
dialog box 
you can use 
to define 
the trigger 
values and 
the format 
for each 
scenario.
	
	
3.	In this example, enter 40. Also in this dialog box, use the drop-down 
box to specify the format you want applied.
	
4.	Click OK. Immediately, Excel applies the formatting scenario to the 
selected cells. See Figure 5-7.

Creating Data Bars
Data Bars fill each cell you are formatting with mini-bars in varying length, 
indicating the value in each cell relative to other formatted cells. Excel essen­
tially takes the largest and smallest values in the selected range and calculates 
the length for each bar. To apply Data Bars to a range, do the following:
	
1.	Select the target range of cells to which you need to apply the 
conditional formatting.
	
2.	Choose Data Bars from the Conditional Formatting menu on the Home 
tab, as demonstrated in Figure 5-8.
	
Figure 5-8: 
Applying 
Data Bars.
	
	
	 As you can see in Figure 5-9, the result is essentially a mini-chart within 
the cells you selected. Also note that by default the Data Bars scenario 
accounts for negative numbers nicely by changing the direction of the 
bar and inverting the color to red.

Applying Color Scales
Color Scales fill each cell you are formatting with a color varying in scale based 
on the value in each cell relative to other formatted cells. Excel essentially 
takes the largest and smallest values in the selected range and determines the 
color for each cell. To apply Color Scales to a range, do the following:
	
1.	Select the target range of cells to which you need to apply the 
conditional formatting.
	
2.	Choose Color Scales from the Conditional Formatting menu on the 
Home tab. See Figure 5-10.
	
Figure 5-10: 
Applying 
Color 
Scales.
	
	
	 As you can see in Figure 5-11, the result is a kind of heat-map within the 
cells you selected.

Using Icon Sets
Icon Sets are sets of symbols that are inserted in each cell you are formatting. 
Excel determines which symbol to use based on the value in each cell relative 
to other formatted cells. To apply an Icon Set to a range, do the following:
	
1.	Select the target range of cells to which you need to apply the 
conditional formatting.
	
2.	Choose Icon Sets from the Conditional Formatting menu on the Home 
tab. As you can see in Figure 5-12, you can choose from a menu of 
Icon Sets varying in shape and color.
	
Figure 5-12: 
Applying 
Icon Sets.
	
	
	 Figure 5-13 illustrates how each cell is formatted with a symbol indicating 
each cell’s value based on the other cells.

Adding your own formatting 
rules manually
You don’t have to use one of the pre-defined scenarios offered by Excel. 
Excel gives you the flexibility to create your own formatting rules manually. 
Creating your own formatting rules helps you better control how cells are 
formatted and allows you to do things you wouldn’t be able to do with the 
pre-defined scenarios.
For example, a useful conditional formatting rule is to tag all above-average 
values with a Check icon and all below-average values with an X icon. 
Figure 5-14 demonstrates this.
	
Figure 5-14: 
With a 
custom for-
matting rule, 
you can tag 
the above-
average 
values with 
a check and 
the below 
average 
values with 
an X.
	

89
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
	
Although it’s true that the Above Average and Below Average scenarios built 
into Excel allow you to format cell and font attributes, they don’t enable the 
use of Icon Sets. You can imagine why Icon Sets would be better on a dash­
board than just color variances. Icons and shapes do a much better job at 
conveying your message, especially when your dashboard is printed in black 
and white.
To get started in creating your first custom formatting rule, open the 
Chapter 5 Samples file found among the sample files on this book’s compan­
ion website. After the file is open, go to the Create Rule by Hand tab, then 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the target range of cells to which you need to apply the condi­
tional formatting and select New Rule as demonstrated in Figure 5-15.
	
Figure 5-15: 
Select 
the target 
range, then 
select New 
Rule.
	
	
	 This opens the New Formatting Rule dialog box shown in Figure 5-16. 
As you look through the rule types at the top of the dialog box, you may 
recognize some of them from the pre-defined scenario choices discussed 
earlier in this chapter. The types are as follows:
 
• Format All Cells Based on Their Values: This selection measures the 
values in the selected range against each other. This selection is 
handy for finding general anomalies in your dataset.
 
• Format Only Cells That Contain: This selection applies conditional 
formatting to those cells that meet specific criteria you define. 
This selection is perfect for comparing values against a defined 
benchmark.
 
• Format Only Top or Bottom Ranked Values: This selection applies 
conditional formatting to those cells that are ranked in the top or 
bottom Nth number or percent of all the values in the range.

90
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
 
• Format Only Values That Are Above or Below Average: This applies 
conditional formatting to those values that are mathematically 
above or below the average of all values in the selected range.
 
• Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format: This selection 
evaluates values based on a formula you specify. If a particular 
value evaluates to true, then the conditional formatting is applied 
to that cell. This selection is typically used when applying condi­
tions based on the results of an advanced formula or mathematical 
operation.
	
	 Data Bars, Color Scales, and Icon Sets can be used only with the Format 
All Cells Based on Their Values rule type.
	
2.	Ensure that the Format All Cells Based on Their Values rule type is 
selected, then use the Format Style drop-down box to switch to Icon Sets.
	
3.	Click the Icon Style drop-down box to select your desired Icon Set.
	
Figure 5-16: 
Select the 
Format All 
Cells Based 
on Their 
Values rule, 
then use 
the Format 
Style drop-
down box 
to switch to 
Icon Sets.
	
	
4.	Change both Type drop-down boxes to Formula.
	
5.	In each Value box, enter =Average($C$2:$C$22).
	
	 This tells Excel that the value in each cell must be greater than the 
average of the entire dataset in order to get the Check icon.
	
	 At this point, your dialog box looks similar to the one in Figure 5-17.

91
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
	
Figure 5-17: 
Change 
the Type 
drop-down 
boxes to 
Formula and 
enter the 
appropriate 
formulas in 
the Value 
boxes.
	
	
6.	Click OK to apply your conditional formatting.
It’s worth taking some time to understand how this conditional formatting 
rule works. Excel assesses every cell in your target range to see if its contents 
match the logic in each Value box in order (top box first). If a cell contains 
a number or text that evaluates true to the first Value box, the first icon is 
applied and Excel moves on to the next cell in your range. If not, Excel contin­
ues down each Value box until one of them evaluates to true. If the cell being 
assessed does not fit any of the logic placed in the Value boxes, Excel auto­
matically tags that cell with the last icon.
In this example, you want your cells to get a Check icon only if the value 
of that cell is greater than (or equal to) the average of the total values. 
Otherwise, you want Excel to skip right to the X icon and apply the X.
Show only one icon
In many cases, you may not need to show all icons when applying the Icon 
Set. In fact, showing too many icons at one time may serve only to obstruct 
the data you’re trying to convey on your dashboard.
In the earlier example, you apply a Check icon to values above the average for 
the range, and an X icon to all below-average values; see Figure 5-18. However, 
in the real world, you often need only to bring attention to the below-average 
values. This way, your eyes aren’t inundated with superfluous icons.

92
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 5-18: 
Too many 
icons can 
hide the 
items you 
want to 
draw 
attention to.
	
Excel provides a clever mechanism to allow you to stop evaluating and 
formatting values if a condition is true.
In this example, you want to remove the Check icons. The cells that contain 
those icons all have values above the average for the range. Therefore, you 
first need to add a condition for all cells whose values are above average. To 
do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the target range of cells, then go to the Home tab and select 
Conditional Formatting➪Manage Rules.
	
	 This opens the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box shown 
in Figure 5-19.
	
2.	Click the New Rule button to start a new rule.
	
	 The New Formatting Rule dialog box appears.

Open the 
Conditional 
Formatting 
Rules 
Manager 
and click

93
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
	
3.	Click the Format Only Cells That Contain rule type. Then configure 
the rule so that the format applies only to cell values greater than the 
average; see Figure 5-20.
	
Figure 5-20: 
This new 
rule is

this case,

that’s 
greater than 
the aver-
age of your 
range.	
	
4.	Click OK without changing any of the formatting options.
	
5.	Back in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager, select the Stop If 
True check box, as demonstrated in Figure 5-21.

6.	Click OK to apply your changes.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 5-22, only the X icons are now shown. Again, 
this allows your audience to focus on the exceptions rather than 
determining which icons are good and bad.

Show Data Bars and icons outside of cells
Although Data Bars and Icon Sets give you a snazzy way of adding visualiza­
tions to your dashboards, you don’t have a lot of say in where they appear 
within your cell. Take a look at Figure 5-23 to see what I mean.
	
Figure 5-23: 
Showing 
Data Bars 
inside the 
same cell as 
your values 
can make it 
difficult to 
analyze the 
data.
	

95
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
By default, the Data Bars are placed directly inside each cell, which in this 
case almost obfuscates the data. From a dashboarding perspective, this is 
less than ideal for two reasons. First, the numbers can get lost in the colors 
of the Data Bars, making them difficult to read — especially when printed in 
black-and-white. Second, it’s difficult to see the ends of each bar.
The solution to this problem is to show the Data Bars outside the cell that 
contains the value. Here’s how:
	
1.	To the right of each cell, enter a formula that references the cell that 
contains your data value. For example, if your data is in B2, go to cell 
C2 and enter =B2.
	
2.	Apply the Data Bar conditional formatting to the formulas you just 
created.
	
3.	Select the formatted range of cells and select Manage Rules under the 
Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
	
4.	In the dialog box that opens, click the Edit Rule button.
	
5.	Select the Show Bar Only option, as demonstrated in Figure 5-24.
	
Figure 5-24: 
Edit the  
formatting 
rule to show 
only the 
Data Bars, 
not the data.
	
	
6.	Click OK to apply your change.
The reward for your efforts is a cleaner view that’s much better suited for 
reporting in a dashboard environment. Figure 5-25 illustrates the improvement 
gained with this technique.

96
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 5-25:

to the data 
values.
	
Using the same technique, you can separate Icon Sets from the data — allowing 
you to position the icons where they best suit your dashboard.
Representing trends with Icon Sets
In a dashboard environment, there may not always be enough space avail­
able to add a chart that shows trending. In these cases, Icon Sets are an ideal 
replacement, enabling you to visually represent the overall trending without 
taking up a lot of space. Figure 5-26 illustrates this with a table that provides 
a nice visual element, allowing for an at-a-glance view of which markets are 
up, down, and flat over the previous month.
	
Figure 5-26:

Formatting 
Icon Sets

tions.
	

97
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
You may want to do the same type of thing with your reports. The key is to 
create a formula that gives you a variance or trending of some sort.
To achieve this type of view, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the target range of cells to which you need to apply the con­
ditional formatting. In this case, the target range will be the cells that 
hold your variance formulas.
	
2.	Choose Icon Sets from the Conditional Formatting menu on the 
Home tab, and then choose the most appropriate icons for your situ­
ation. For this example, choose the set with three arrows shown in 
Figure 5-27.
	
Figure 5-27: 
The up 
arrow 
indicates 
an upward 
trend; the 
down arrow 
indicates a 
downward 
trend; and 
the right 
arrow indi-
cates a flat 
trend.
	
	
	 In most cases, you’ll want to adjust the thresholds that define what up, 
down, and flat mean. Imagine that you need any variance above 3% to 
be tagged with an up arrow, any variance below -3% to be tagged with a 
down arrow, and all others to show flat.
	
3.	Select the target range of cells and select Manage Rules under the 
Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
	
4.	In the dialog box that opens, click the Edit Rule button.
	
5.	Adjust the properties as shown in Figure 5-28.

98
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 5-28: 
You can 
adjust the 
thresholds 
that define 
what up, 
down, and 
flat mean.
	
	
6.	Click OK to apply your change.
	
Notice in Figure 5-28 that the Type property for the formatting rule is set to 
Number even though the data you’re working with (the variances) are 
percentages. You’ll find that working with the Number setting gives you more 
control and predictability when setting thresholds.
Using Symbols to Enhance Reporting
Symbols are essentially tiny graphics, not unlike those you see when you 
use the Wingdings, Webdings, or other fancy fonts. However, symbols are 
not really fonts. They’re Unicode characters. Unicode characters are a set of 
industry standard text elements designed to provide a reliable character-
set that remains viable on any platform regardless of international font 
differences.
One example of a commonly used symbol is the copyright symbol (©). 
This symbol is a Unicode character. You can use this symbol on a Chinese, 
Turkish, French, and American PC and it will reliably be available with no 
international differences.
In terms of Excel presentations, Unicode characters (or symbols) can be 
used in places where conditional formatting cannot. For instance, in the chart 
labels that you see in Figure 5-29, the x-axis shows some trending arrows that 
allow for an extra layer of analysis. This couldn’t be done with conditional 
formatting.

99
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
	
Figure 5-29: 
Use symbols 
to add an 
extra layer 
of analysis 
to charts.
	
Let’s take some time to review the steps that led to the chart in Figure 5-29.
Start with the data shown in Figure 5-30. Note that you have a designated 
cell — C1 in this case — to hold any symbols you’re going to use. This cell 
isn’t really all that important. It’s just a holding cell for the symbols you’ll 
insert. Now, follow these steps:
	
Figure 5-30: 
Our starting 
data with 
a holding 
cell for our 
symbols.
	
	
1.	Click in C1 and then select the Symbol command on the Insert tab.
	
	 The Symbol dialog box shown in Figure 5-31 opens.

Figure 5-31: 
Use the 
Symbol 
dialog box 
to insert 
the desired 
symbols into 
your holding 
cell.
	
	
2.	Find and select your desired symbols by clicking the Insert button 
after each symbol. In this scenario, select the down-pointing triangle, 
and click Insert. Then click the up-pointing triangle and click Insert. 
Close the dialog box when you’re done.
	
	 At this point, you have the up triangle and down triangle symbols in cell 
C1, as shown in Figure 5-32.
	
Figure 5-32: 
Copy the 
newly 
inserted 
symbols 
to the 
Clipboard.
	
	
3.	Click the C1 cell, go to the Formula bar, and copy the two symbols by 
highlighting them and pressing Ctrl+C on your keyboard.
	
4.	Go to your data table, right-click the percentages, and then select 
Format Cells.
	
5.	In the Format Cells dialog box, create a new custom format by pasting 
the up- and down-triangle symbols into the appropriate syntax parts; 
see Figure 5-33. In this case, any positive percentage will be preceded 
with the up-triangle symbol, and any negative percentage will be 
­preceded with the down-triangle symbol.

101
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations

Create a 
custom 
number 
format using 
the symbols.
	
	
	 Not familiar with custom number formatting? Chapter 3 covers the ins 
and outs of custom number formatting in detail.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 The symbols are now part of your number formatting! Figure 5-34 
illustrates what your percentages look like. Change any number from 
positive to negative (or vice versa) and Excel automatically applies the 
appropriate symbol.
	
Figure 5-34: 
Your 
symbols are 
now part of 
your number 
formatting.
	
Because charts automatically adopt number formatting, a chart created from 
this data will show the symbols as part of the labels. Simply use this data as 
the source for the chart.
This is just one way to use symbols in your reporting. With this basic tech­
nique, you can insert symbols to add visual appeal to tables, pivot tables, 
formulas, or any other object you can think of.

The Magical Camera Tool
Excel’s Camera tool enables you to take a live picture of a range of cells that 
updates dynamically while the data in that range updates. If you’ve never 
heard of it, don’t feel too bad. This nifty tool has been hidden away in the last 
few versions of Excel. Although Microsoft has chosen not to include this tool 
on the mainstream Ribbon, it’s actually quite useful for those of us building 
dashboards and reports.
Finding the Camera tool
Before you can use the Camera tool, you have to find it and add it to your 
Quick Access toolbar.
	
The Quick Access toolbar is a customizable toolbar in which you can store 
frequently used commands so that they’re always accessible with just one 
click. You can add commands to the Quick Access toolbar by dragging them 
directly from the Ribbon or by going through the Customize menu.
Follow these steps to add the Camera tool to the Quick Access toolbar:
	
1.	Click the File button.
	
2.	Open the Excel Options dialog box by clicking the Options button.
	
3.	Click the Quick Access Toolbar button.
	
4.	In the Choose Commands From drop-down list, select Commands Not 
in the Ribbon.
	
5.	Scroll down the alphabetical list of commands shown in Figure 5-35 
and find Camera; double-click it to add it to the Quick Access toolbar.
Figure 5-35: 
Add the 
Camera tool 
to the Quick 
Access 
toolbar.

103
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 When you’ve taken these steps, you’ll see the Camera tool in your Quick 
Access toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-36.
	
Figure 5-36: 
Not surpris-
ingly, the 
icon for the 
Camera tool 
looks like a 
camera.
	
Using the Camera tool
To use the Camera tool, you simply highlight a range of cells to then capture 
everything in that range in a live picture. The cool thing about the Camera 
tool is that you’re not limited to showing a single cell’s value like you are with 
a linked text box. And because the picture is live, any updates made to the 
source range automatically changes the picture.
Take a moment to walk through this basic demonstration of the Camera tool. 
In Figure 5-37, you see some simple numbers and a chart based on those 
numbers. The goal here is to create a live picture of the range that holds both 
the numbers and the chart. Just follow these steps:
	
Figure 5-37: 
Enter some 
simple 
numbers in 
a range and 
create a 
basic chart 
from those 
numbers.
	

104
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
1.	Highlight the range that contains the information you want to capture. 
In this scenario, you select B3:F13 to capture the area with the chart.
	
2.	Select the Camera tool icon in the Quick Access toolbar.
	
	 You add the Camera tool to the Quick Access toolbar in the preceding 
section.
	
3.	Click the worksheet in the location where you want to place the 
picture.
	
	 Excel immediately creates a live picture of the entire range, as shown in 
Figure 5-38.
	
Figure 5-38: 
A live 
picture is 
created via 
the Camera 
tool.
	
	
	 Changing any number in the original range automatically causes the 
picture to update.
	
By default, the picture that’s created has a border around it. To remove the 
border, right-click the picture and select Format Picture. This opens the 
Format Picture dialog box. In the Colors and Lines tab, you see a Line Color 
drop-down list. Here you can select No Color, thereby removing the border. On 
a similar note, to get a picture without gridlines, simply remove the gridlines 
from the source range.

105
 Chapter 5: Formatting Your Way to Visualizations
Enhancing a dashboard 
with the Camera tool
Here are a few ways to go beyond the basics and use the Camera tool to 
enhance your dashboards and reports:
	
✓	Consolidating disparate ranges into one print area: Sometimes a data 
model gets so complex that it’s difficult to keep all the final data in one 
printable area. This often forces you to print multiple pages inconsis­
tent in layout and size. Given that dashboards are most effective when 
contained in a compact area that can be printed in a page or two, com­
plex data models prove to be problematic when it comes to layout and 
design.
	
	You can use the Camera tool in these situations to create live pictures 
of various ranges that you can place on a single page. Figure 5-39 shows 
a workbook that contains data from various worksheets. The secret 
here is that these are nothing more than linked pictures created by the 
Camera tool.
	
	As you can see, you can create and manage multiple analyses on dif­
ferent tabs and then bring together all your presentation pieces into a 
nicely formatted presentation layer.
	
Figure 5-39: 
Use the 
Camera tool 
to get mul-
tiple source 
ranges into 
a compact 
area.
	

106
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
✓	Rotating objects to save time: Again, because the Camera tool outputs 
pictures, you can rotate the pictures in situations in which placing the 
copied range on its side can help save time. A great example is a chart. 
Certain charts are relatively easy to create in a vertical orientation but 
extremely difficult to create in a horizontal orientation.
	
	The Camera tool to the rescue! When the live picture of the chart is cre­
ated, all you have to do is change the alignment of the chart labels and 
then rotate the picture using the rotate handle to create a horizontal 
version.
	
✓	Creating small charts: When you create pictures with the Camera Tool, 
you can resize and move the pictures around freely. This gives you the 
freedom to test different layouts and chart sizes without the need to 
work around column widths, hidden rows, or other such nonsense.

The Pivotal Pivot Table
In This Chapter
▶	Introducing pivot tables
▶	Building your first pivot table
▶	Creating top and bottom reports
▶	Using pivot-driven views
I

 know what you’re thinking. Am I supposed to be jumping right in with 
pivot tables? My answer is an emphatic yes!
In Chapter 2, I introduce the concept of reporting models that separate the 
data, analysis, and presentation layers. As you discover in this chapter, 
pivot tables lend themselves nicely to this concept. With pivot tables, you 
can build reporting models that are not only easy to set up, but also can be 
refreshed with a simple press of a button. This allows you to spend less time 
maintaining your dashboards and reports and more time doing other useful 
things. No utility in the whole of Excel allows you to achieve this efficient 
data model better than a pivot table.
Pivot tables have a reputation for being complicated, but if you’re new to 
pivot tables, relax a bit. After going through this introduction, you’ll be pleas­
antly surprised at how easy it is to create and use pivot tables. Later, you’ll 
find some time-saving techniques to help create useful pivot-driven views for 
your dashboards and reports.
An Introduction to the Pivot Table
A pivot table is a robust tool that allows you to create an interactive view of 
your dataset, commonly referred to as a pivot table report. With a pivot table 
report, you can quickly and easily categorize your data into groups, summarize 
large amounts of data into meaningful analyses, and interactively perform a 
wide variety of calculations.
Pivot tables get their name from the way they allow you to drag and drop 
fields within the pivot table report to dynamically change (or pivot) perspec­
tive and give you an entirely new analysis using the same data source.

108
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Think of a pivot table as an object you can point at your dataset. When you look 
at your dataset through a pivot table, you can see your data from different per­
spectives. The dataset itself doesn’t change, and it’s not connected to the pivot 
table. The pivot table is simply a tool you’re using to dynamically change analy­
ses, apply varying calculations, and interactively drill down to the detail records.
The reason a pivot table is so well suited for dashboarding and reporting is 
that you can refresh the analyses shown through your pivot table simply by 
updating the dataset it’s pointed to. This allows you to set up your analysis 
and presentation layers only one time; then, to refresh your reporting mecha­
nism, all you have to do is press a button.
Let’s start this exploration of pivot tables with a lesson on the anatomy of a 
pivot table.
The Four Areas of a Pivot Table
A pivot table is composed of four areas. The data you place in these areas 
defines both the utility and appearance of the pivot table. Take a moment to 
understand the function of each of these four areas.
Values area
The values area, as shown in Figure 6-1, is the large rectangular area below 
and to the right of the column and row headings. In the example in Figure 6-1, 
the values area contains a sum of the values in the Sales Amount field. 
	
Figure 6-1: 
The values 
area of a 
pivot table 
calculates 
and counts 
data.
	
Values area

109
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
The values area calculates and counts data. The data fields that you drag and 
drop here are typically those that you want to measure — fields, such as Sum 
of Revenue, Count of Units, or Average of Price.
Row area
The row area is shown in Figure 6-2. Placing a data field into the row area 
displays the unique values from that field down the rows of the left side of 
the pivot table. The row area typically has at least one field, although it’s 
possible to have no fields.

Row area
The types of data fields that you would drop here include those that you 
want to group and categorize, such as Products, Names, and Locations.
Column area
The column area is composed of headings that stretch across the top of columns 
in the pivot table.
As you can see in Figure 6-3, the column area stretches across the top 
of the columns. In this example, it contains the unique list of business 
segments.
Placing a data field into the column area displays the unique values from that 
field in a column-oriented perspective. The column area is ideal for creating a 
data matrix or showing trends over time.

Filter area
The filter area is an optional set of one or more drop-downs at the top of the 
pivot table. In Figure 6-4, the filter area contains the Region field, and the 
pivot table is set to show all regions.

Placing data fields into the filter area allows you to filter the entire pivot 
table based on your selections. The types of data fields that you’d drop here 
include those that you want to isolate and focus on; for example, Region, Line 
of Business, and Employees.

 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
Creating Your First Pivot Table
If you’ve followed along so far, you now have a good understanding of the 
basic structure of a pivot table, so let’s quit all the talking and use the follow­
ing steps to walk through the creation of your first pivot table:
	
You can find the sample file for this chapter on this book’s companion 
website.
	
1.	Click any single cell inside your data source — the table you’ll use to 
feed the pivot table.
	
2.	Select the Insert tab on the Ribbon. Here, find the PivotTable icon, 
as shown in Figure 6-5. Choose PivotTable from the drop-down list 
beneath the icon.
	
Figure 6-5: 
Start a pivot 
table via the 
Insert tab.
	
	
	 This activates the Create PivotTable dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-6. 
As you can see, this dialog box asks you to specify the location of your 
source data and the place you want to put the pivot table.
	
	 Notice that in the Create PivotTable dialog box, Excel makes an attempt 
to fill in the range of your data for you. In most cases, Excel gets this 
right. However, always make sure the correct range is selected.
	
	 You will also note in Figure 6-6 that the default location for a new pivot 
table is New Worksheet. This means your pivot table will be placed in 
a new worksheet within the current workbook. You can change this by 
selecting the Existing Worksheet option and specifying the worksheet 
where you want the pivot table placed.

112
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 6-6: 
The Create 
PivotTable 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	Click OK.
	
	 At this point, you have an empty pivot table report on a new worksheet. 
Next to the empty pivot table, you see the PivotTable Fields dialog box, 
shown in Figure 6-7.
	
	 The idea here is to add the fields you need into the pivot table by using 
the four drop zones found in the PivotTable Field List — Filters, Columns, 
Rows and Values. Pleasantly enough, these drop zones correspond to the 
four areas of the pivot table you review at the beginning of this chapter.
	
Figure 6-7: 
The 
PivotTable 
Fields dialog 
box.
	
	
	 If clicking the pivot table doesn’t activate the PivotTable Fields dialog 
box, you can manually activate it by right-clicking anywhere inside the 
pivot table and selecting Show Field List.

113
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
	 Now, before you go wild and start dropping fields into the various drop 
zones, it’s important that you ask yourself two questions; “What am I 
measuring?” and “How do I want to see it?” The answers to these ques­
tions give you some guidance when determining which fields go where.
	
	 For your first pivot table report, you want to measure the dollar sales by 
market. This automatically tells you that you will need to work with the 
Sales Amount field and the Market field.
	
	 How do you want to see that? You want markets to go down the left side 
of the report and sales amount to be calculated next to each market. 
Remembering the four areas of the pivot table, you’ll need to add the 
Market field to the Rows drop zone, and the Sales Amount field to the 
Values drop zone.
	
4.	Select the Market check box in the list, as demonstrated in Figure 6-8.
	
	 Now that you have regions in your pivot table, it’s time to add the dollar 
sales.
	
Figure 6-8: 
Select the 
Market 
check box.
	
	
5.	Select the Sales Amount check box in the list, as demonstrated in 
Figure 6-9.
	
	 Selecting a check box that is non-numeric (text or date) automatically places 
that field into the row area of the pivot table. Selecting a check box that is 
numeric automatically places that field in the values area of the pivot table.
	
	 What happens if you need fields in the other areas of the pivot table? 
Well, instead of selecting the field’s check box, you can drag any field 
directly to the different drop zones.
	
	 One more thing: When you add fields to the drop zones, you may find it dif­
ficult to see all the fields in each drop zone. You can expand the PivotTable 
Fields dialog box by clicking and dragging the borders of the dialog box.

114
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Figure 6-9: 
Add the 
Sales 
Amount field 
by selecting 
its check 
box.
As you can see, you have just analyzed the sales for each market in just five 
steps! That’s an amazing feat considering you start with more than 60,000 
rows of data. With a little formatting, this modest pivot table can become the 
starting point for a management dashboard or report.
Changing and rearranging your pivot table
Now here’s the wonderful thing about pivot tables: You can add as many 
layers of analysis as made possible by the fields in your source data table. 
Say that you want to show the dollar sales each market earned by business 
segment. Because your pivot table already contains the Market and Sales 
Amount fields, all you have to add is the Business Segment field.
So, simply click anywhere on your pivot table to reactivate the PivotTable 
Fields dialog box and then select the Business Segment check box. Figure 6-10 
illustrates what your pivot table should look like now.
	
If clicking the pivot table doesn’t activate the PivotTable Fields dialog box, you 
can manually activate it by right-clicking anywhere inside the pivot table and 
selecting Show Field List.

115
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
Figure 6-10: 
Adding a 
layer of 
analysis is 
as easy as 
bringing 
in another 
field.
Imagine that your manager says that this layout doesn’t work for him. He 
wants to see business segments going across the top of the pivot table 
report. No problem. Simply drag the Business Segment field from the Rows 
drop zone to the Columns drop zone. As you can see in Figure 6-11, this 
instantly restructures the pivot table to his specifications.
Adding a report filter
Often, you’re asked to produce reports for one particular region, market, 
product, and so on. Instead of working hours and hours building separate 
reports for every possible analysis scenario, you can leverage pivot tables to 
help create multiple views of the same data. For example, you can do so by 
creating a region filter in your pivot table.
Click anywhere on your pivot table to reactivate the PivotTable Fields dialog 
box and then drag the Region field to the Filters drop zone. This adds a drop-
down selector to your pivot table, shown in Figure 6-12. You can then use this 
selector to analyze one particular region at a time.

Keeping your pivot table fresh
In Hollywood, it’s important to stay fresh and relevant. As boring as your pivot 
tables may seem, they’ll eventually become the stars of your reports and dash­
boards. So it’s just as important to keep your pivot tables fresh and relevant.

117
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
As time goes by, your data may change and grow with newly added rows 
and columns. The action of updating your pivot table with these changes 
is refreshing your data.
Your pivot table report can be refreshed by simply right-clicking inside your 
pivot table report and selecting Refresh, as demonstrated in Figure 6-13.
	
Figure 6-13: 
Refreshing

table

made to 
your data.
	
Pivot tables and spreadsheet bloat
It’s important to understand that pivot tables 
come with space and memory implications for 
your reporting processes. When you create 
a pivot table, Excel takes a snapshot of your 
dataset and stores it in a pivot cache. A pivot 
cache is essentially a memory container that 
holds this snapshot of your dataset. Each pivot 
table report you create from a separate data 
source creates its own pivot cache, which 
increases your workbook’s memory usage and 
file size. The increase in memory usage and file 
size depends on the size of the original data 
source that’s being duplicated to create the 
pivot cache.
Simple enough, right? Well here’s the rub: You 
often need to create separate pivot tables from 
the same data source in order to analyze the 
same data in different ways. If you create two 
pivot tables from the data source, a new pivot 
cache is automatically created even though 
one may already exist for the dataset being 
used. This means that you’re bloating your 
spreadsheet with redundant data each time 
you create a new pivot table using the same 
dataset.
To work around this potential problem, you can 
employ Copy and then Paste. That’s right; simply 
copying a pivot table and pasting it somewhere 
else will create another pivot table, without 
duplicating the pivot cache. This allows you to 
create multiple pivot tables that use the same 
source data, with negligible increase in memory 
and file size.

118
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Sometimes, you’re the data source that feeds your pivot table changes in 
structure. For example, you may have added or deleted rows or columns 
from your data table. These types of changes affect the range of your data 
source, not just a few data items in the table.
In these cases, performing a simple Refresh of your pivot table won’t do. 
You have to update the range being captured by the pivot table. Here’s how:
	
1.	Click anywhere inside your pivot table to activate the PivotTable 
Tools context tab in the Ribbon.
	
2.	Select the Analyze tab on the Ribbon.
	
3.	Click Change Data Source, as demonstrated in Figure 6-14.
	
	 The Change PivotTable Data Source dialog box appears.
	
4.	Change the range selection to include any new rows or columns. See 
Figure 6-15.
	
5.	Click OK to apply the change.

 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
Customizing Your Pivot Table Reports
The pivot tables you create often need to be tweaked to get the look and feel 
you’re looking for. In this section, I cover some of the options you can adjust 
to customize your pivot tables to suit your reporting needs.
Changing the pivot table layout
Excel gives you a choice in the layout of your data in a pivot table. The three 
layouts, shown side by side in Figure 6-16, are the Compact Form, Outline 
Form, and Tabular Form. Although no layout stands out as better than the 
others, I prefer using the Tabular Form layout because it seems easiest to read, 
and it’s the layout that most people who have seen pivot tables are used to.
	
Figure 6-16: 
The three 
layouts for 
a pivot table 
report.
	
The layout you choose not only affects the look and feel of your reporting 
mechanisms, but it may also affect the way you build and interact with any 
dashboard models based on your pivot tables.
Changing the layout of a pivot table is easy. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Click anywhere inside your pivot table to activate the PivotTable 
Tools context tab on the Ribbon.
	
2.	Select the Design tab on the Ribbon.
	
3.	Click the Report Layout icon and choose the layout you like. See 
Figure 6-17.

120
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 6-17: 
Changing 
the layout 
for your 
pivot table.
	
Customizing field names
Notice that every field in your pivot table has a name. The fields in the row, 
column, and filter areas inherit their names from the data labels in your 
source table. The fields in the values area are given a name, such as Sum of 
Sales Amount.
Sometimes you might prefer the name Total Sales instead of the unattractive 
default name, like Sum of Sales Amount. In these situations, the ability to 
change your field names is handy. To change a field name, do the following:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
	 For example, if you want to change the name of the field Sum of Sales 
Amount, you right-click any value under that field.
	
2.	Select Value Field Settings, as shown in Figure 6-18.
	
	 The Value Field Settings dialog box appears.
	
	 Note that if you were changing the name of a field in the row or column 
area, this selection is Field Settings.

121
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
3.	Enter the new name in the Custom Name input box, shown in Figure 6-19.
	
4.	Click OK to apply the change.
	
Figure 6-18: 
Right-click 
any value in 
the target 
field to 
select the 
Value Field 
Settings 
option.
	
	
Figure 6-19: 
Use the 
Custom 
Name input 
box to 
change the 
name of the 
field.
	

122
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
If you use the name of the data label used in your source table, you receive 
an error. For example, if you rename Sum of Sales Amount as Sales Amount, 
you get an error message because there’s already a Sales Amount field in the 
source data table. Well, this is kinda lame, especially if Sales Amount is exactly 
what you want to name the field in your pivot table.
To get around this, you can name the field and add a space to the end of the 
name. Excel considers Sales Amount (followed by a space) to be different 
from Sales Amount. This way you can use the name you want, and no one will 
notice it’s any different.
Applying numeric formats to data fields
Numbers in pivot tables can be formatted to fit your needs — that is, format­
ted as currency, percentage, or number. You can easily control the numeric 
formatting of a field using the Value Field Settings dialog box. Here’s how:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
	 For example, if you want to change the format of the values in the Sales 
Amount field, right-click any value under that field.
	
2.	Select Value Field Settings.
	
	 The Value Field Settings dialog box appears.
	
3.	Click the Number Format button.
	
	 The Format Cells dialog box opens.
	
4.	Apply the number format you desire, just as you typically would on 
your spreadsheet.
	
5.	Click OK to apply the changes.
	
	 After you set the formatting for a field, the applied formatting will persist 
even if you refresh or rearrange your pivot table.
Changing summary calculations
When creating your pivot table report, Excel will, by default, summarize your 
data by either counting or summing the items. Instead of Sum or Count, you 
might want to choose functions, such as Average, Min, Max, and so on. In all, 
11 options are available, including
	
✓	Sum: Adds all numeric data.
	
✓	Count: Counts all data items within a given field, including numeric-, 
text-, and date-formatted cells.
	
✓	Average: Calculates an average for the target data items.

123
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
✓	Max: Displays the largest value in the target data items.
	
✓	Min: Displays the smallest value in the target data items.
	
✓	Product: Multiplies all target data items together.
	
✓	Count Nums: Counts only the numeric cells in the target data items.
	
✓	StdDevP and StdDev: Calculates the standard deviation for the target 
data items. Use StdDevP if your dataset contains the complete popula­
tion. Use StdDev if your dataset contains a sample of the population.
	
✓	VarP and Var: Calculates the statistical variance for the target data 
items. Use VarP if your data contains a complete population. If your 
data contains only a sampling of the complete population, use Var to 
estimate the variance.
You can easily change the summary calculation for any given field by taking 
the following actions:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
2.	Select Value Field Settings.
	
	 The Value Field Settings dialog box appears.
	
3.	Choose the type of calculation you want to use from the list of calcula­
tions. See Figure 6-20.
	
4.	Click OK to apply the changes.
	
Figure 6-20: 
Changing 
the type of 
summary 
calculation 
used in a 
field.
	

124
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Did you know that a single blank cell causes Excel to count instead of sum? 
That’s right. If all the cells in a column contain numeric data, Excel chooses 
Sum. If just one cell is either blank or contains text, Excel chooses Count.
Be sure to pay attention to the fields that you place into the values area of 
the pivot table. If the field name starts with Count Of, Excel’s counting the 
items in the field instead of summing the values.
Suppressing subtotals
Notice that each time you add a field to your pivot table, Excel adds a subto­
tal for that field. There may be times however, when the inclusion of subto­
tals either doesn’t make sense or just hinders a clear view of your pivot table 
report. For example, Figure 6-21 shows a pivot table in which the subtotals 
inundate the report with totals that hide the real data you’re trying to report.
Figure 6-21: 
Subtotals 
sometimes 
muddle the 
data you’re 
trying to 
show.
Removing all subtotals at one time
You can remove all subtotals at once by taking these actions:
	
1.	Click anywhere inside your pivot table to activate the PivotTable 
Tools context tab on the Ribbon.

125
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
2.	Select the Design tab on the Ribbon.
	
3.	Click the Subtotals icon and select Do Not Show Subtotals, as shown in 
Figure 6-22.
	
Figure 6-22: 
Use the Do 
Not Show

option to

As you can see in Figure 6-23, the same report without subtotals is much 
more pleasant to review.

Removing the subtotals for only one field
Maybe you want to remove the subtotals for only one field? In such a case, 
you can take the following actions:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
2.	Select Field Settings.
	
	 The Field Settings dialog box appears.
	
3.	Choose the None option under Subtotals, as demonstrated in 
Figure 6-24.

Removing grand totals
There may be instances when you want to remove the grand totals from your 
pivot table.

127
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
1.	Right-click anywhere on your pivot table.
	
2.	Select PivotTable Options.
	
	 The PivotTable Options dialog box appears.
	
3.	Click the Totals & Filters tab.
	
4.	Click the Show Grand Totals for Rows check box to deselect it.
	
5.	Click the Show Grand Totals for Columns check box to deselect it.
Showing and hiding data items
A pivot table summarizes and displays all the records in your source data 
table. There may be situations however, when you want to inhibit certain 
data items from being included in your pivot table summary. In these situa­
tions, you can choose to hide a data item.
In terms of pivot tables, hiding doesn’t just mean preventing the data item 
from being shown on the report. Hiding a data item also prevents it from 
being factored into the summary calculations.
In the pivot table illustrated in Figure 6-25, I show sales amounts for all 
Business Segments by Market. In this example, I want to show totals without 
taking sales from the Bikes segment into consideration. In other words, I want 
to hide the Bikes segment.
	
Figure 6-25: 
To remove 
Bikes 
from this 
analysis . . .
	

128
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
I can hide the Bikes Business Segment by clicking the Business Segment drop-
down list arrow and deselecting the Bikes check box, as shown in Figure 6-26.
Figure 6-26: 
. . . deselect 
the Bikes 
check box.
After choosing OK to close the selection box, the pivot table instantly recal­
culates, leaving out the Bikes segment. As you can see in Figure 6-27, the 
Market total sales now reflect the sales without Bikes.
I can just as quickly reinstate all hidden data items for my field. I simply click 
the Business Segment drop-down list arrow and click the Select All check 
box, as shown in Figure 6-28.
Hiding or showing items without data
By default, your pivot table shows only data items that have data. This inher­
ent behavior may cause unintended problems for your data analysis.
Look at Figure 6-29, which shows a pivot table with the SalesPeriod field in 
the row area and the Region field in the filter area. Note that the Region field 
is set to (All), and every sales period appears in the report.

129
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
If I choose Europe in the filter area, only a portion of all the sales periods will 
show. See Figure 6-30. The pivot table will show only those sales periods that 
apply to the Europe region.
	
Figure 6-27:

sis from 
Figure 6-25

data items 
in that field

periods are

Figure 6-30: 
Filtering for 
the Europe 
region 
causes 
some of 
the sales 
periods to

Displaying only those items with data could cause trouble if I plan on using 
this pivot table as the feeder for my charts or other dashboard components. 
From a dashboarding-and-reporting perspective, it isn’t ideal if half the year’s 
data disappeared each time customers selected Europe.
Here’s how you can prevent Excel from hiding pivot items without data:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
	 In this example, the target field is the SalesPeriod field.
	
2.	Select Field Settings.
	
	 The Field Settings dialog box appears.

131

3.	Select the Layout & Print tab in the Field Settings dialog box.

5.	Click OK to apply the change.
As you can see in Figure 6-32, after choosing the Show Items with No Data 
option, all the sales periods appear whether the selected region had sales 
that period or not.
Now that I’m confident that the structure of the pivot table is locked, I can 
use it to feed charts and other components on my dashboard.

Sorting your pivot table
By default, items in each pivot field are sorted in ascending sequence based 
on the item name. Excel gives you the freedom to change the sort order of 
the items in your pivot table.
Like many actions you can perform in Excel, there are lots of different ways 
to sort data within a pivot table. The easiest way, and the way that I use the 
most, is to apply the sort directly in the pivot table. Here’s how:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field — the field you need to sort.
	
	 In the example shown in Figure 6-33, I want to sort by Sales Amount.
	
Figure 6-33: 
Applying 
a sort to a

field.
	
	
2.	Select Sort and then select the sort direction.
	
	 The changes take effect immediately and persist while you work with 
your pivot table.

 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
Creating Useful Pivot-Driven Views
At this point in your exploration of pivot tables, you have covered enough of 
the fundamentals to start creating your own pivot table reports. In this last 
section, I share with you a few of the techniques I use to create some of the 
more useful report views. Although you could create these views by hand, 
creating them with pivot tables helps save you hours of work and allows you 
to more easily update and maintain them.
Producing top and bottom views
You’ll often find that managers are interested in the top and bottom of things: 
the top 50 customers, the bottom 5 sales reps, the top 10 products. Although 
you may think this is because managers have the attention span of a four-
year-old, there’s a more logical reason for focusing on the outliers.
Dashboarding and reporting is often about showing actionable data. If you, as 
a manager, know who the bottom ten revenue-generating accounts are, you 
could apply your effort and resources in building up those accounts. Because 
you most likely wouldn’t have the resources to focus on all accounts, viewing 
a manageable subset of accounts would be more useful.
Luckily, pivot tables make it easy to filter your data for the top five, the 
bottom ten, or any conceivable combination of top or bottom records. Here’s 
an example.
Imagine that in your company, the Accessories Business Segment is a high-
margin business — you make the most profit for each dollar of sales in the 
Accessories segment. To increase sales, your manager wants to focus on the 
50 customers who spend the least amount of money on accessories. He obvi­
ously wants to spend his time and resources on getting those customers to 
buy more accessories. Here’s what to do:
	
1.	Build a pivot table with Business Segment in the filter area, Customer 
in the row area, and Sales Amount in the values area; see Figure 6-34. 
For cosmetic value, change the layout to Tabular Form. See the earlier 
section “Changing the pivot table layout,” to find out how to do that.
	
	 You can find the sample file for this chapter on this book’s companion 
website.
	
2.	Right-click any customer name in the Customer field, select Filter, and 
then Top 10 — as demonstrated in Figure 6-35.
	
	 Don’t let the label Top 10 confuse you. You can use the Top 10 option to 
filter both top and bottom records.

can go a step further and format the report a bit by sorting on the Sum 
of Sales Amount and applying a currency format to the numbers. See 
Figure 6-38.

Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
Note that because you built this view using a pivot table, you can easily adapt 
your newly created report to create a whole new view. For example, you can 
add the SubRegion field — shown in Figure 6-39 — to the filter area to get 
the 50 United Kingdom customers who spend the least amount of money on 
accessories. This, my friends, is the power of using pivot tables for the basis 
of your dashboards and reports. Continue to play around with the Top 10 
filter option to see what kind of reports you can come up with.
	
Figure 6-39: 
You can 
easily adapt 
this report 
to produce 
any com-
bination of 
views.
	
	
You may notice that in Figure 6-39, the bottom 50 report is showing only 23 
records. This is because there are fewer than 50 customers in the United 
Kingdom market that have accessories sales. Because I asked for the bottom 50, 
Excel shows up to 50 accounts, but fewer if there are fewer than 50. If there’s a 
tie for any rank in the bottom 50, Excel shows you all the tied records.
You can remove the applied filters in your pivot tables by taking these 
actions:
	
1.	Click anywhere inside your pivot table to activate the PivotTable 
Tools context tab on the Ribbon.
	
2.	Select the Options tab on the Ribbon.
	
3.	Click the Clear icon and select Clear Filters, as demonstrated in 
Figure 6-40.

Creating views by month, 
quarter, and year
Raw transactional data is rarely aggregated by month, quarter, or year for you. 
This type of data is often captured by the day. However, managers often want 
reports by month or quarters instead of detail by day. Fortunately, pivot tables 
make it easy to group date fields into various time dimensions. Here’s how:
	
1.	Build a pivot table with Sales Date in the row area and Sales Amount 
in the values area, similar to the one in Figure 6-41.
	
Figure 6-41: 
Build this 
pivot table 
to start.
	
	
2.	Right-click any date and select Group, as demonstrated in Figure 6-42.
	
	 The Grouping dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-43.

138
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 6-42: 
Select 
the Group 
option.
	
	
Figure 6-43: 
Select the 
time dimen-
sions that 
suit your 
needs.
	
	
3.	Select the time dimensions you want. In this example, select Months, 
Quarters and Years.
	
4.	Click OK to apply the change.
Here are several interesting things to note about the resulting pivot table. 
First, notice that Quarters and Years have been added to your field list. Keep 
in mind that your source data hasn’t changed to include these new fields; 
instead, these fields are now part of your pivot table. Another interesting 
thing to note is that by default, the Years and Quarters fields are automati­
cally added next to the original date field in the pivot table layout, as shown 
in Figure 6-44.

139
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
Figure 6-44: 
Adding 
Years and 
Quarters 
fields.
	
After your date field is grouped, you can use each added time grouping just as 
you would any other field in your pivot table. In Figure 6-45, I use the newly 
created time groupings to show sales for each market by quarter for 2010.
	
Figure 6-45: 
You can use 
your newly 
created time 
dimensions 
just like a 
typical pivot 
field.
	
Creating a percent distribution view
A percent distribution (or percent contribution) view allows you to see how 
much of the total is made up of a specific data item. This view is useful when 
you’re trying to measure the general impact of a particular item.

140
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
The pivot table, as shown in Figure 6-46, gives you a view into the percent of 
sales that comes from each business segment. Here, you can tell that bikes 
make up 81 percent of Canada’s sales whereas only 77 percent of France’s 
sales come from bikes.
	
Figure 6-46: 
This view 
shows per-
cent of total 
for the row.
	
Here are the steps to create this type of view:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
	 For example, if you want to change the settings for the Sales Amount 
field, right-click any value under that field.
	
2.	Select Value Field Settings.
	
	 The Value Field Settings dialog box appears.
	
3.	Click the Show Values As tab.
	
4.	  Select % of Row Total from the drop-down list.
	
5.	  Click OK to apply your change.
The pivot table in Figure 6-47 gives you a view into the percent of sales that 
comes from each market. Here, you have the same type of view, but this time, 
you use the % of Column Total option.
	
Figure 6-47: 
This view 
shows 
percent of 
total for the 
column.
	

141
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
Again, remember that because you built these views in a pivot table, you 
have the flexibility to slice the data by region, bring in new fields, rearrange 
data, and most importantly, refresh this view when new data comes in.
Creating a YTD totals view
Sometimes it’s useful to capture a running-totals view to analyze the move­
ment of numbers on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Figure 6-48 illustrates a pivot 
table that shows a running total of revenue by month for each year. In this 
view, you can see where the YTD sales stand at any given month in each year. 
For example, you can see that in August 2010, revenues were about a million 
dollars lower than the same point in 2009.
	
Figure 6-48: 
This view 
shows a 
running total 
of sales for 
each month.
	
	
In the sample data for this chapter, you don’t see Months and Years. You have 
to create them by grouping the SalesDate field. Feel free to review the section, 
“Creating views by month, quarter, and year,” earlier in this chapter to find 
out how.
To create this type of view, take these actions:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
	 For example, if you want to change the settings for the Sales Amount 
field, right-click any value under that field.
	
2.	Select Value Field Settings.
	
	 The Value Field Settings dialog box appears.

142
Part II: Building Basic Dashboard Components 
	
3.	Click the Show Values As tab.
	
4.	Select Running Total In from the drop-down list.
	
5.	In the Base Field list, select the field that you want the running totals 
to be calculated against.
	
	 In most cases, this would be a time series such as, in this example, the 
SalesDate field.
	
6.	Click OK to apply your change.
Creating a month-over-month 
variance view
Another commonly requested view is a month-over-month variance. How 
did this month’s sales compare to last month’s sales? The best way to create 
these types of views is to show the raw number and the percent variance 
together.
In that light, you can start creating this view by building a pivot table similar 
to the one shown in Figure 6-49. Notice that you bring in the Sales Amount 
field twice. One of these remains untouched, showing the raw data. The other 
is changed to show the month-over-month variance.
	
Figure 6-49: 
Build a pivot 
table that 
contains 
the Sum 
of Sales 
Amount 
twice.
	
Figure 6-50 illustrates the settings that convert the second Sum of Sales 
Amount field into a month-over-month variance calculation.

143
 Chapter 6: The Pivotal Pivot Table
	
Figure 6-50: 
Configure 
the second 
Sum of 
Sales 
Amount field 
to show 
month-
over-month 
variance.
	
As you can see, after the settings are applied, the pivot table gives you a nice 
view of raw sales dollars and the variance over last month. You can obviously 
change the field names (see the section, “Customizing field names,” earlier in 
this chapter) to reflect the appropriate labels for each column.
	
In the sample data for this chapter, you don’t see Months and Years. You have 
to create them by grouping the SalesDate field. Feel free to review the section, 
“Creating views by month, quarter, and year,” earlier in this chapter to find out 
how.
To create the view in Figure 6-50, take these actions:
	
1.	Right-click any value within the target field.
	
	 In this case, the target field is the second Sum of Sales Amount field.
	
2.	Select Value Field Settings.
	
	 The Value Field Settings dialog box appears.
	
3.	Click the Show Values As tab.
	
4.	Select % Difference From from the drop-down list.
	
5.	In the Base Field list, select the field that you want the running totals 
to be calculated against.
	
	 In most cases, this is a time series like, in this example, the SalesDate field.
	
6.	In the Base Item list, select the item you want to compare against 
when calculating the percent variance.
	
	 In this example, you want to calculate each month’s variance to the 
previous month. Therefore, select the (Previous) item.

o matter what business you’re in, you can’t escape the tendency to 
trend. In fact, one of the most common concepts used in dashboards 
and reports is the concept of trending. A trend is a measure of variance over 
some defined interval — typically time periods such as days, months, or 
years.
The reason trending is so popular is that trending provides a rational 
­expectation of what might happen in the future. If I know this book has sold 
10,000 copies a month over the last 12 months (I wish), I have reasonable 
expectation to believe sales next month will be around 10,000 copies. In 
short, trending tells you where you’ve been and where you might be going.
In this chapter, you explore basic trending concepts and some of the 
advanced techniques you can use to take your trending components beyond 
simple line charts.
Trending Dos and Don’ts
Building trending components for your dashboards has some dos and don’ts. 
This section helps you avoid some common trending faux pas.

148
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
Using chart types appropriate 
for trending
It would be nice if you could definitively say which chart type you should use 
when building trending components. But, the truth is, no chart type is the 
silver bullet for all situations. For effective trending, you want to understand 
which chart types are most effective in different trending scenarios.
Using line charts
Line charts are the kings of trending. In business presentations, a line chart 
almost always indicates movement across time. Even in areas not related to 
business, the concept of lines is used to indicate time — consider timelines, 
family lines, bloodlines, and so on. The benefit of using a line chart for trend­
ing is that it’s instantly recognized as a trending component, avoiding any 
delay in information processing.
Line charts are especially effective in presenting trends with many data 
points — as the top chart in Figure 7-1 shows. You can also use a line chart to 
present trends for more than one time period, as shown in the bottom chart 
in Figure 7-1.
	
Figure 7-1: 
Line charts 
are the 
chart of 
choice 
when you 
need to 
show 
trending 
over time.
	
Using area charts
An area chart is essentially a line chart that’s been filled in. So, technically, 
area charts are appropriate for trending. They’re particularly good at high­
lighting trends over a large time span. For example, the chart in Figure 7-2 
spans over 120 days of data.

149
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
	
Figure 7-2: 
Area charts 
can be used 
to trend 
over a large 
time span.
	
Using column charts
If you’re trending one series of time, a line chart is absolutely the way to go. 
However, if you’re comparing two or more time periods on the same chart, 
columns may best bring out the comparisons.
Figure 7-3 demonstrates how a combination chart can instantly call attention 
to the exact months when 2010 sales fell below 2009 sales. A combination of 
line and column charts is an extremely effective way to show the difference in 
units sold between two time periods. You see how to create this type of chart 
later in this chapter.
	
Figure 7-3: 
Using 
columns 
and lines 
emphasizes 
the trending 
differences 
between 
two time 
periods.
	

150
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
Starting the vertical scale at zero
The vertical axis on trending charts should almost always start at zero. 
The reason I say almost is because you may have trending data that contains 
negative values or fractions. In those situations, it’s generally best to keep 
Excel’s default scaling. However, if you have only non-negative integers, 
ensure that your vertical axis starts at zero.
This is because the vertical scale of a chart can have a significant impact on 
the representation of a trend. For instance, compare the two charts shown in 
Figure 7-4. Both charts contain the same data. The only difference is that in 
the top chart, I did nothing to fix the vertical scale assigned by Excel (it starts 
at 96), but in the bottom chart, I fixed the scale to start at zero.
	
Figure 7-4: 
Vertical 
scales 
should 
always start 
at zero.
	
Now, you may think the top chart is more accurate because it shows the ups 
and downs of the trend. However, if you look at the numbers closely, you 
see that the units represented went from 100 to 107 in 12 months. That’s not 
exactly a material change, and it certainly doesn’t warrant such a dramatic 
chart. In truth, the trend is relatively flat, yet the top chart makes it look as 
though the trend is way up.
The bottom chart more accurately reflects the true nature of the trend. 
I achieved this effect by locking the Minimum value on the vertical axis 
to zero.

151
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
To adjust the scale of your vertical axis, follow these simple steps:
	
1.	Right-click the vertical axis and choose Format Axis.
	
	 The Format Axis dialog box appears; see Figure 7-5.
	
Figure 7-5: 
Always 
set the 
Minimum 
value of 
your vertical 
axis to zero.
	
	
2.	In the Format Axis dialog box, expand the Axis Options section and 
set the Minimum value to 0.
	
3.	(Optional) Set the Major Unit value to twice the Maximum value in 
your data.
	
	 Setting this value ensures that your trend line gets placed in the middle 
of your chart.
	
4.	Click Close to apply your changes.
	
Many would argue that the bottom chart shown in Figure 7-4 hides the 
­small-scale trending that may be important. That is, a seven unit difference 
may be very significant in some businesses. Well, if that’s true, why use a 
chart at all? If each unit has such an impact on the analysis, why use a broad-
sweep representation like a chart? A table with conditional formatting would 
do a better job at highlighting small-scale changes than any chart ever could.
Leveraging Excel’s logarithmic scale
In some situations, your trending may start with very small numbers and 
end with very large numbers. In these cases, you end up with charts that 
don’t accurately represent the true trend. Take Figure 7-6, for instance. In this 
figure, you see the unit trending for both 2009 and 2010. As you can see in the 

152
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
source data, 2009 started with a modest 50 units. As the months progressed, 
the monthly unit count increased to 11,100 units through December 2010. 
Because the two years are on such different scales, it’s difficult to discern a 
comparative trending for the two years together.
	
Figure 7-6: 
A standard 
linear scale 
doesn’t 
allow for 
accurate 
trending in 
this chart.
	
The solution is to use a logarithmic scale instead of a standard linear scale.
Without going into high school math, a logarithmic scale allows your axis to 
jump from 1 to 10; to 100 to 1,000; and so on without changing the spacing 
between axis points. In other words, the distance between 1 and 10 is the 
same as the distance between 100 and 1,000.
Figure 7-7 shows the same chart as that in Figure 7-6, but in a logarithmic scale. 
Notice that the trending for both years is now clear and accurately represented.
Figure 7-7: 
Using the 
logarithmic 
scale helps 
bring out 
trending in 
charts that 
contain very 
small and 
very large 
values.

153
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
To change the vertical axis of a chart to logarithmic scaling, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Right-click the vertical axis and choose Format Axis.
	
	 The Format Axis dialog box appears.
	
2.	Expand the Axis Options section and select the Logarithmic Scale 
check box as shown in Figure 7-8.
	
Figure 7-8:

vertical axis

mic scale.
	
	
Logarithmic scales work only with positive numbers.
Applying creative label management
As trivial as it may sound, labeling can be one of the sticking points to 
­creating effective trending components. Trending charts tend to hold lots of 
data points, whose category axis labels take up lots of room. Inundating users 
with a gaggle of data labels can definitely distract from the main message of 
the chart. In this section, you find a few tips to help manage the labels in your 
trending components.
Abbreviating instead of changing alignment
Month names look and feel very long when you place them in a chart — 
especially when that chart has to fit on a dashboard. However, the solution 
isn’t to change their alignment, as shown in Figure 7-9. Words placed on their 

154
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
sides inherently cause a reader to stop for a moment and read the labels. 
This isn’t ideal when you want them to think about your data and not spend 
time ­reading with their heads tilted.
Although it’s not always possible, the first option is always to keep your 
labels normally aligned. So instead of jumping right to the alignment option 
to squeeze them in, try abbreviating the month names. As you can see in 
Figure 7-9, even using the first letter of the month name is appropriate.
	
Figure 7-9: 
Choose to 
abbreviate 
category 
names 
instead of 
changing 
alignment.
	
Implying labels to reduce clutter
When you’re listing the same months over the course of multiple years, you 
may be able to imply the labels for months instead of labeling each and every 
one of them.
Take Figure 7-10, for example. The chart in this figure shows trending through 
two years. There are so many data points that the labels are forced to be 
vertically aligned. To reduce clutter, as you can see, only certain months are 
explicitly labeled. The others are implied by a dot. To achieve this effect, you 
can simply replace the label in the original source data with a dot (or ­whatever 
character you like).

155
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
	
Figure 7-10: 
To save real 
estate on 
your dash-
board, try 
labeling only 
certain data 
points.
	
Going vertical when you have too many data points for horizontal
Trending data by day is common, but it does prove to be painful if the trend­
ing extends to 30 days or more. In these scenarios, it becomes difficult to keep 
the chart to a reasonable size and even more difficult to effectively label it.
One solution is to show the trending vertically using a bar chart. See 
Figure 7-11 for an example. With a bar chart, you have room to label the data 
points and keep the chart to a reasonable size. This isn’t something to aspire 
to, however. Trending vertically isn’t as intuitive and may not convey your 
information in a very readable form. Nevertheless, this solution can be just 
the work-around you need when the horizontal view is impractical.
	
Figure 7-11: 
A bar chart 
can prove to 
be effective 
when trend-
ing days 
extend to 
30 or more 
data points.
	

156
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
Nesting labels for clarity
Often, the data you’re trying to chart has multiple time dimensions. In these 
cases, you can call out these dimensions by nesting your labels. Figure 7-12 
demonstrates how including a year column next to the month labels clearly 
partitions each year’s data. You would simply include the year column when 
identifying the data source for your chart.
	
Figure 7-12: 
Excel is 
smart 
enough to 
recognize 
and plot 
multiple 
layers of 
labels.
	
Comparative Trending
Although the name is fancy, comparative trending is a simple concept. You 
chart two or more data series on the same chart so that the trends from 
those series can be visually compared. In this section, you walk through a 
few techniques that allow you to build components that present comparative 
trending.
Creating side-by-side time comparisons
Figure 7-13 shows a chart that presents a side-by-side time comparison of 
three time periods. With this technique, you can show different time periods 
in different colors without breaking the continuity of the overall trending. 
Here’s how to create this type of chart:
	
1.	Structure your source data similar to the structure shown in 
Figure 7-14.
	
	 Note that instead of placing all the data into one column, you’re ­staggering 
the data into respective years. This tells the chart to create three separate 
lines, allowing for the three colors.

157
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending

show trends 
for different 
time periods 
side by side.

data needed 
to display 
side-by-side 
trends.
	
	
2.	Select the entire table and create a line chart.
	
	 This creates the chart shown in Figure 7-13.
	
3.	If you want to get a bit fancy, click the chart to select it, then right-
click and select Change Chart Type from the context menu that opens.
	
4.	When the Change Chart Type dialog box opens, select Stacked 
Column Chart.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 7-15, your chart now shows the trending for 
each year in columns.

instead of

Would you like a space between the years? Adding a space in the source data 
(between each 12 month sequence) adds a space in the chart, as shown in 
Figure 7-16.
	
Figure 7-16: 
If you want 
to sepa-
rate each 
year with 
a space, 
simply add 
a space into 
the source 
data.
	
Creating stacked time comparisons
The stacked time comparison places two series on top of each other instead 
of side by side. Although this removes the benefit of having an unbroken 
overall trending, it replaces it with the benefit of an at-a-glance comparison 
within a compact space. Figure 7-17 illustrates a common stacked time 
comparison.

159
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
	
Figure 7-17: 
A stacked 
time com-
parison 
allows you 
to view and 
compare 
two years 
of data in 
a compact 
space.	
To create a stacked time comparison, follow these steps:
	
1.	Create a new structure and add data to it like the one shown in 
Figure 7-18.
	
Figure 7-18: 
Start with 
a structure 
containing 
the data for 
two time 
periods.
	
	
2.	Highlight the entire structure and create a column chart.
	
3.	Select and right-click any of the bars for the 2010 data series and then 
choose Change Series Chart Type.
	
	 The Change Chart Type dialog box appears.
	
4.	In the Change Chart Type dialog box, select the line type in the Line 
section.

160
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
This technique works well with two time series. You generally want to avoid 
stacking any more than that. Stacking more than two series often muddies 
the view and causes users to constantly reference the legend to keep track of 
the series they’re evaluating.
Trending with a secondary axis
In some trending components, you have series that trend two very ­different 
units of measure. For instance, the table in Figure 7-19 shows a trend for 
People Count and a trend for % of Labor Cost.
	
Figure 7-19: 
You often 
need to 
trend two 
very differ-
ent units of 
measure, 
such as 
counts and 
percentages.
	
These are two very different units of measure that, when charted, produce 
the unimpressive chart you see in Figure 7-20. Because Excel builds the 
­vertical axis to accommodate the largest number, the percentage of labor 
cost trending gets lost at the bottom of the chart. Even a logarithmic scale 
doesn’t help in this scenario.

161
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
	
Figure 7-20: 
The trending 
for percent-
age of labor 
cost gets 
lost at the 
bottom of 
the chart.
	
Because the default vertical axis (or primary axis) doesn’t work for both 
series, the solution is to create another axis to accommodate the series that 
doesn’t fit into the primary axis. This other axis is the secondary axis.
To place a data series on the secondary axis, follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click the data series and select Format Data Series.
	
	 The Format Data Series dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-21.
	
Figure 7-21:

data series

ondary axis.

2.	In the Format Data Series dialog box, expand the Series Options 
­section and then click the Secondary Axis radio button.
	
	 Figure 7-22 illustrates the newly added axis to the right of the chart. Any 
data series on the secondary axis has its vertical axis labels shown on 
the right.
	
Figure 7-22: 
Thanks to 
the second-
ary axis, 
both trends 
are clearly 
defined.
	
Again, changing the chart type of any one of the data series can help in 
­comparing the two trends. In Figure 7-23, the chart type for the People Count 
trend has been changed to a column. Now you can easily see that although 
the number of people has gone down in November and December, the 
­percentage of labor cost continues to rise.

163
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
	
Technically, it doesn’t matter which data series you place on the secondary 
axis. A general rule is to place the problem data series on the secondary axis. 
In this scenario, because the data series for percentage of labor cost seems to 
be the problem, I place that series on the secondary axis.
Emphasizing Periods of Time
Some of your trending components may contain certain periods in which 
a special event occurred, causing an anomaly in the trending pattern. For 
instance, you may have an unusually large spike or dip in the trend caused by 
some occurrence in your organization. Or maybe you need to mix actual data 
with forecasts in your charting component. In such cases, it could be helpful 
to emphasize specific periods in your trending with special formatting.
Formatting specific periods
Imagine you just created the chart component illustrated in Figure 7-24 and 
you want to explain the spike in October. You could, of course, use a footnote 
somewhere, but that would force your audience to look for an explanation 
elsewhere on your dashboard. Calling attention to an anomaly directly on the 
chart helps give your audience context without the need to look away from 
the chart.
	
Figure 7-24: 
The spike 
in October 
warrants 
emphasis.	

164
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
A simple solution is to format the data point for October to appear in a 
­different color and then add a simple text box that explains the spike.
To format a single data point:
	
1.	Click the data point once.
	
	 This places dots on all the data points in the series.
	
2.	Click the data point again to ensure Excel knows you’re formatting 
only that one data point.
	
	 The dots disappear from all but the target data point.
	
3.	Right-click and select Format Data Point.
	
	 This opens the Format Data Point dialog box shown in Figure 7-25. The 
idea is to adjust the formatting properties of the data point as you 
see fit.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 7-25 is for a column chart. Different 
chart types have different options in the Format Data Point dialog box. 
Nevertheless, the idea remains the same in that you can adjust the 
properties in the Format Data Point dialog to change the formatting of a 
single data point.
	
	 After changing the fill color of the October data point and adding a text 
box with some context, the chart nicely explains the spike, as shown in 
Figure 7-26.
	
Figure 7-25: 
The Format 
Data Point 
dialog box

options for a

Figure 7-26:

attention to

instant con-
text via a 
text box.
	
	
To add a text box to a chart, click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and select the 
Text Box icon. Then click inside the chart to create an empty text box, which 
you can fill with your words.
Using dividers to mark significant events
Every now and then a particular event shifts the entire paradigm of your 
data permanently. A good example is a price increase. The trend shown in 
Figure 7-27 has been permanently affected by a price increase implemented in 
October. As you can see, a dividing line (along with some labeling) ­provides 
a distinct marker for the price increase, effectively separating the old trend 
from the new.
	
Figure 7-27: 
Use a 
simple line 
to mark 
particular 
events 
along a

166
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
Although there are lots of fancy ways to create this effect, you’ll rarely need 
to get any fancier than manually drawing a line yourself. To draw a dividing 
line inside a chart, take the following steps:
	
1.	Click the chart to select it.
	
2.	Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and click the Shapes button.
	
3.	Select the line shape, go to your chart, and draw the line where you 
want it.
	
4.	Right-click your newly drawn line and select Format Shape.
	
5.	Use the Format Shape dialog box to format your line’s color, thickness, 
and style.
Representing forecasts in your 
trending components
It’s common to be asked to show both actual data and forecast data as a 
single trending component. When you do show the two together, you want to 
ensure that your audience can clearly distinguish where actual data ends and 
where forecasting begins. Take a look at Figure 7-28.
	
Figure 7-28: 
You can 
easily see 
where sales 
trending 
ends and 
forecast 
trending 
begins.
	
The best way to achieve this effect is to start with a data structure similar 
to the one shown in Figure 7-29. As you can see, sales and forecasts are in 
separate columns so that when charted, you get two distinct data series. Also 
note the value in cell B14 is actually a formula referencing C14. This value 
serves to ensure a continuous trend line (with no gaps) when the two data 
series are charted together.

167
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
	
Figure 7-29: 
Start with 
a table that 
places your 
actual data 
and your 
forecasts 
in separate 
columns.
	
When you have the appropriately structured dataset, you can create a line 
chart. At this point, you can apply special formatting to the 2013 Forecast 
data series. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the data series that represents 2013 Forecast.
	
	 This places dots on all the data points in the series.
	
2.	Right-click and select Format Data Series.
	
	 This opens the Format Data Series dialog box.
	
3.	In this dialog box, you can adjust the properties to format the series 
color, thickness, and style.
Other Trending Techniques
In this section, you explore a few techniques that go beyond the basic 
­concepts covered so far.
Avoiding overload with 
directional trending
Do you work with a manager that’s crazy for data? Are you getting ­headaches 
from trying to squeeze three years of monthly data into a single chart? 
Although it’s understandable to want to see a three-year trend, placing too 
much information on a single chart can make for a convoluted trending 
­component that tells you almost nothing.

168
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
When you’re faced with the need to display impossible amounts of data, step 
back and think about the true purpose of the analysis. When your manager 
asks for a three-year sales trend by month, what’s he really looking for? It 
could be that he’s really asking whether current monthly sales are declining 
versus history. Do you really need to show each and every month or can you 
show the directional trend?
A directional trend is one that uses simple analysis to imply a relative direc­
tion of performance. The key attribute of a directional trend is that the data 
used is often a set of calculated values as opposed to actual data values. For 
instance, instead of charting each month’s sales for a single year, you could 
chart the average sales for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. With such a chart, you’d get a 
directional idea of monthly sales, without the need to look into detailed data.
Take a look at Figure 7-30, which shows two charts. The bottom chart trends 
each year’s monthly data in a single chart. You can see how difficult it is to 
discern much from this chart. It looks like monthly sales are dropping in 
all three years. The top chart shows the same data in a directional trend, 
­showing average sales for key time periods. The trend really jumps at you, 
showing that sales have flattened out after healthy growth in 2011 and 2012.
	
Figure 7-30: 
Directional 
trending 
(top) can 
help you 
reveal 
trends that 
may be 
hidden in 
more com-
plex charts.
	
Smoothing data
Certain lines of business lend themselves to wide fluctuations in data from 
month to month. For instance, a consulting practice may go months without 
a steady revenue stream before a big contract comes along and spikes the 
sales figures for a few months. Some call these ups and downs seasonality or 
business cycles.

169
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
Whatever you call them, wild fluctuations in data can prevent you from 
­effectively analyzing and presenting trends. Figure 7-31 demonstrates how 
highly volatile data can conceal underlying trends.
	
Figure 7-31: 
The volatile 
nature of 
this data 
makes it dif-
ficult to see 
the underly-
ing trend.
	
This is where the concept of smoothing comes in. Smoothing does just what it 
sounds like — it forces the range between the highest and lowest values in a 
dataset to smooth to a predictable range without disturbing the proportions 
of the dataset.
Now, you can use lots of different techniques to smooth a dataset. Take a 
moment to walk through two of the easier ways to apply smoothing.
Smoothing with Excel’s moving average functionality
Excel has a built-in smoothing mechanism in the form of a moving average 
trend line. That is, a trend line that calculates and plots the moving average 
at each data point. A moving average is a statistical operation used to track 
daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. A typical moving average starts calculat­
ing the average of a fixed number of data points, then with each new day’s 
(or week’s or month’s) numbers, the oldest number is dropped, and the 
newest number is included in the average. This calculation is repeated over 
the entire dataset, creating a trend that represents the average at specific 
points in time.
Figure 7-32 illustrates how Excel’s moving average trend line can help smooth 
volatile data, highlighting a predictable range.

170
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 7-32: 
A four-
month 
moving 
average 
trend line 
has been 
added to 
smooth 
the volatile 
nature of 
the original 
data.
	
In this example, a four-month moving average has been applied.
To add a moving average trend line, follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click the data series that represents the volatile data, and then 
select Add Trendline.
	
	 The Format Trendline dialog box appears, shown in Figure 7-33.
	
Figure 7-33: 
Applying a 
four-month 
moving 
average 
trend line.
	
	
2.	In the Format Trendline dialog box, select Moving Average, and then 
specify the number of periods.
In this case, Excel will average a four-month moving trend line.

171
 Chapter 7: Charts That Show Trending
Creating your own smoothing calculation
As an alternative to Excel’s built-in trend lines, you can create your own 
smoothing calculation and simply include it as a data series in your chart. In 
Figure 7-34, a calculated column (appropriately called Smoothing) provides 
the data points needed to create a smoothed data series.
	
Figure 7-34: 
A calculated 
smoothing 
column 
feeds a new 
series to 
your chart.
	
In this example, the second row of the smoothing column contains a simple 
average formula that averages the first data point and the second data point. 
Note that the reference to the first data point (cell D2) is locked as an abso­
lute value with dollar ($) signs. This ensures that when this formula is copied 
down, the range grows to include all previous data points.
After the formula is copied down to fill the entire smoothing column, it can 
simply be included in the data source for the chart. Figure 7-35 illustrates the 
smoothed data plotted as a line chart.

Plotting the 
smoothed 
data reveals 
the underly-
ing trend.

Grouping and Bucketing Data
In This Chapter

▶	Creating histograms with pivot tables
▶	Highlighting top and bottom values in charts
I

t’s often helpful to organize your analyses into logical groups of data. 
Grouping allows you to focus on manageable sets that have key attributes. 
For example, instead of looking at all customers in one giant view, you can 
analyze customers who buy only one product. This allows you to focus atten­
tion and resources on those customers who have the potential of buying 
more products.
The benefit of grouping data is that it allows you to more easily pick out 
groups that fall outside the norm for your business.
In this chapter, you explore some of the techniques you can use to create 
components that group and bucket data.
Creating Top and Bottom Displays
When you look at the list of Fortune 500 companies, you often look for the 
top 20 companies. Then perhaps you look at who eeked out at the bottom 
20 slots. It’s unlikely that you would check to see which company came in at 
number 251. It’s not necessarily because you don’t care about number 251; 
it’s just that you can’t spend the time or energy to process all 500 companies. 
So you process the top and bottom of the list.

174
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
This is the same concept behind creating top and bottom displays. Your 
audience has only a certain amount of time and resources to dedicate to 
solving any issues you can emphasize on your dashboard. Showing them 
the top and bottom values in your data can help them pinpoint where 
and how they can have the most impact with the time and resources they 
do have.
Incorporating top and bottom 
displays into dashboards
The top and bottom displays you create can be as simple as source data that 
you incorporate into your dashboard. Typically placed to the right of a dash­
board, this data can emphasize details a manager may use to take action on 
a metric. For example, the simple dashboard shown in Figure 8-1 shows sales 
information with top and bottom sales reps.
	
Figure 8-1: 
Top and 
bottom dis-
plays that 
emphasize 
certain 
metrics.
 	
To get a little fancier, you can supplement your top and bottom displays with 
some ranking information, some in-cell bar charts, or some conditional for­
matting; see Figure 8-2.

175
 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
	
Figure 8-2: 
You can 
use some 
conditional 
formatting 
to add visual 
components 
to your top 
and bottom 
displays.
	
You can create the in-cell bar charts with the Data Bars conditional format­
ting function, covered in Chapter 5. The arrows are also simple conditional 
formatting rules that are evaluated against the variance in current and last 
months’ ranks.
Using pivot tables to get 
top and bottom views
If you’ve read Chapter 6, you know that a pivot table is an amazing tool that 
can help create interactive reporting. Take a moment now to look over an 
example of how pivot tables can help you build interactive top and bottom 
displays.
	
Open the Chapter 8 Samples file, found on this book’s companion website to 
follow along.
Follow these steps to display a Top and a Bottom filter with a pivot table:
	
1.	Start with a pivot table that shows the data you want to display with 
your top and bottom views.
	
	 In this case, the pivot table shows Sales Rep and Sales_Amount; see 
Figure 8-3.

176
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 8-3: 
Start with 
a pivot 
table that 
contains 
the data 
you want to 
filter.
	
	
2.	Right-click the field you want to use to determine the top values. In 
this example, use the Sales Rep field. Choose Filter➪Top 10, shown 
in Figure 8-4.
	
	 The Top 10 Filter (Sales Rep) dialog box appears, shown in Figure 8-5.
	
Figure 8-4: 
Select the 
Top 10 filter 
option.
	

177
 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
	
Figure 8-5: 
Specify the 
filter you 
want to 
apply.
	
	
3.	In the Top 10 Filter (Sales Rep) dialog box, define the view you’re 
looking for. In this example, you want the Top 10 Items (Sales Reps) as 
defined by the Sales_Amount field.
	
4.	  Click OK to apply the filter.
	
	 At this point, your pivot table is filtered to show the top ten sales reps 
for the selected region and market. You can change the Market filter to 
Charlotte and get the top ten sales reps for Charlotte only; see Figure 8-6.
	
Figure 8-6: 
You can 
interactively 
filter your 
pivot table 
report to 
instantly 
show the 
top ten 
sales reps 
for any 
region and 
market.
	
	
5.	To view the bottom ten Sales Rep list, copy the entire pivot table and 
paste it next to the existing one.
	
6.	Repeat Steps 2 through 4 in the newly copied pivot table — except 
this time, choose to filter the bottom ten items as defined by the 
Sales_Amount field.

178
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
	 If all goes well, you now have two pivot tables similar to those in Figure 8-7: 
one that shows the top ten sales reps, and one that shows the bottom ten. 
You can link back to these two pivot tables in the analysis layer of your data 
model using formulas. This way, when you update the data, your top and 
bottom values display the new information.
	
Figure 8-7: 
You now 
have two 
pivot tables 
that show 
top and 
bottom 
displays.
	
	
If there’s a tie for any rank in the top or bottom values, Excel shows you all the 
tied records. This means you may get more than the number you filtered for. 
If you filtered for the top 10 sales reps and there’s a tie for the number 5 rank, 
Excel shows you 11 sales reps (both reps ranked at number 5 will be shown).
Using Histograms to Track Relationships 
and Frequency
A histogram is a graph that plots frequency distribution. A frequency distribu­
tion shows how often an event or category of data occurs. With a histogram, 
you can visually see the general distribution of a certain attribute.
Take a look at the histogram shown in Figure 8-8. This histogram represents 
the distribution of units sold in one month among your sales reps. As you 
can see, most reps sell somewhere between 5 and 25 units a month. As 
a manager, you want the hump in the chart to move to the right — more 
people selling a higher number of units per month. So you set a goal for a 
majority of your sales reps to sell between 15 and 25 units within the next 
three months. With this histogram, you can visually track the progress 
toward that goal.

179
 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
	
Figure 8-8: 
A histogram 
showing the 
distribution 
of units sold 
per month 
among your 
sales force.
	
This section discusses how to create a histogram using formulas and pivot 
tables. The techniques covered here fit nicely in data models in which you 
separate data, analysis, and presentation information. In addition, these 
techniques allow for a level of automation and interactivity, which comes in 
handy when updating dashboards each month.
	
See how to develop a data model in Chapter 2.
Adding formulas to group data
Follow these steps to create a formula-driven histogram:
	
1.	Before you create your histogram, you need a table that contains your 
raw data, and you need to create a bin table; see Figure 8-9.
	
	 The raw data should ideally consist of records that represent unique 
counts for the data you want to group. For instance, the raw data table 
in Figure 8-9 contains unique sales reps and the number of units each 
has sold.
	
	 The bin table dictates the grouping parameters used to break your raw 
data into the frequency groups. The bin table tells Excel to cluster all 
sales reps selling fewer than 5 units into the first frequency group, any 
sales reps selling 5 to 14 units in the second frequency group, and so on.
	
	 You can freely set your own grouping parameters when you build your 
bin table. However, it’s generally a good idea to keep your parameters 
as equally spaced as possible. You typically want to end your bin tables 
with the largest number in the dataset. This allows you to have clean 
groupings that end in a finite number — not in an open-ended greater-
than designation.

180
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 8-9: 
Start with 
your raw 
data table 
and a bin 
table.
	
	
2.	Create a new column in the bin table to hold the FREQUENCY formulas. 
Name the new column Frequency Formulas, as shown in Figure 8-10.
	
	 Excel’s FREQUENCY function counts how often values occur within the 
ranges you specify in a bin table.
Figure 8-10: 
Type the 
FRE-
QUENCY 
formula you 
see here, 
and then be 
sure to hold 
down the 
Ctrl+Shift+ 
Enter keys 
on your 
keyboard.
	
3.	Select the cells in the newly created column.
	
4.	Type the FREQUENCY formula you see in Figure 8-10 and then press 
Ctrl+Shift+Enter on your keyboard.

181
 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
	
	 The FREQUENCY function has a quirk that often confuses first-time users. 
The FREQUENCY function is an array formula — a formula that returns 
many values at one time. In order for this formula to work properly, you 
have to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter on your keyboard after typing the for­
mula. If you just press the Enter key, you won’t get the results you need.
	
	 At this point, you should have a table that shows the number of sales 
reps that fall into each of your bins. You could chart this table, but the 
data labels would come out wonky. For the best results, you should 
build a simple chart feeder table that creates appropriate labels for each 
bin. You do this in the next step.
	
5.	Create a new table that feeds the charts a bit more cleanly; see 
Figure 8-11. Use a simple formula that concatenates bins into appro­
priate labels. Use another formula to bring in the results of your 
FREQUENCY calculations.
	
	 In Figure 8-11, the formulas in the first record of the chart feeder table 
are visible. These formulas are essentially copied down to create a table 
appropriate for charting.
Figure 8-11: 
Build a 
simple chart 
feeder table 
that creates 
appropriate 
labels for 
each bin.
	
6.	Use your newly created chart feeder table to plot the data into a 
column chart.
	
	 Figure 8-12 illustrates the resulting chart. You can very well use the ini­
tial column chart as your histogram.
	
	 If you like your histograms to have spaces between the data points, 
you’re done. If you like the continuous, blocked look you get with no 
gaps between the data points, follow the next few steps.

 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
Adding a cumulative percent
A nice feature to add to your histograms is a cumulative percent series. With 
a cumulative percent series, you can show the percent distribution of the 
data points to the left of the point of interest.
Figure 8-14 shows an example of a cumulative percent series. At each data 
point in the histogram, the cumulative percent series tells you the percent of 
the population that fills all the bins up to that point. For instance, you can see 
that 25% of the sales reps represented sold 15 units or less. In other words, 
75% of the sales reps sold more than 15 units.
	
Figure 8-14: 
The cumula-
tive percent 
series 
shows the 
percent of 
the popula-
tion that fills 
all the bins 
up to each 
point in the 
histogram.
	
Take another look at the chart in Figure 8-14 and find the point where you see 
75% on the cumulative series. At 75%, look at the label for that bin range (you 
see 35–45). The 75% mark tells you that 75% of sales reps sold between 0 and 
45 units. This means that only 25% of sales reps sold more than 45 units.
To create a cumulative percent series for your histogram, follow these steps:
	
1.	Perform Steps 1 through 5 of creating a histogram (in the “Adding for­
mulas to group data” section), then add a column to your chart feeder 
table that calculates the percent of total sales reps for the first bin; see 
Figure 8-15.
	
	 Note the dollar symbols ($) used in the formula to lock the references 
while you copy the formula down.

In a new 
column,

formula that 
calculates 
the percent 
of total sales 
reps for the 
first bin.
	
2.	Copy the formula down for all the bins in the table.
	
3.	Use the chart feeder table to plot the data into a line chart.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 8-16, the resulting chart needs some additional 
formatting.
	
Figure 8-16: 
Your initial 
chart will

to make it 
look like a

4.	Right-click the series that makes up your histogram (Count of Sales 
Reps), select Change Chart Type, and then change the chart type to a 
column chart.
	
5.	Right-click any of the columns in the chart and choose Format Data 
Series.

6.	Adjust the Gap Width property to 0%, as demonstrated in Figure 8-13.

8.	In the Format Data Series dialog box, change the Plot Series On option 
to Secondary Axis.
	
9.	Right-click Cumulative % series in the chart and choose Add Data 
Labels.
	
	 At this point, your base chart is complete. It should look similar to the 
one shown at the beginning of this section in Figure 8-14. When you get 
to this point, you can adjust the colors, labels, and other formatting.
Using a pivot table to create a histogram
Did you know you can use a pivot table as the source for a histogram? That’s 
right. With a little-known trick, you can create a histogram that’s as interac­
tive as a pivot table!
As in the formula-driven histogram, the first step in creating a histogram with 
a pivot table is to create a frequency distribution. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Create a pivot table and plot the data values in the row area (not the 
data area). As you can see in Figure 8-17, the SumOfSales_Amount 
field is placed in the ROWS drop zone. Place the Sales Rep field in the 
VALUES dropzone.
	
Figure 8-17: 
Place your 
data values 
in the ROWS 
dropzone

2.	Right-click any value in the ROWS area and choose Group.
	
	 The Grouping dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-18.
	
Figure 8-18: 
The 
Grouping 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	In this dialog box, set the Starting At and Ending At values and then 
set the interval.
	
	 This creates your frequency distribution. In Figure 8-18, the distribution 
is set to start at 5,000 and to create groups in increments of 1,000 until it 
ends at 100,000.
	
4.	Click OK to confirm your settings.
	
	 The pivot table calculates the number of sales reps for each defined 
increment, just as in a frequency distribution; see Figure 8-19. You can 
now leverage this result to create a histogram!
	
Figure 8-19: 
The result of 
grouping the 
values in the 
row area is 
a frequency 
distribution 
that can be 
charted into 
a histogram.
	

187
 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
The obvious benefit to this technique is that after you have a frequency dis­
tribution and a histogram, you can interactively filter the data based on other 
dimensions, like region and market. For instance, you can see the histogram 
for the Canada market and then quickly switch to see the histogram for the 
California market.
	
Note that you can’t add cumulative percentages to a histogram based on a 
pivot table.
Emphasizing Top Values in Charts
Sometimes a chart is indeed the best way to display a set of data, but you 
still would like to call attention to the top values in that chart. In these 
cases, you can use a technique that actually highlights the top values in 
your charts. That is to say, you can use Excel to figure out which values in 
your data series are in the top nth value and then apply special formatting 
to them. Figure 8-20 illustrates an example in which the top five quarters are 
highlighted and given a label.
	
Figure 8-20: 
This chart 
highlights 
the top five 
quarters 
with differ-
ent font and 
labeling.
	
The secret to this technique is Excel’s obscure LARGE function. The LARGE 
function returns the nth largest number from a dataset. In other words, you 
tell it where to look and the number rank you want.
To find the largest number in the dataset, you enter the formula LARGE(Data_
Range, 1). To find the fifth largest number in the dataset, use LARGE(Data_
Range, 5). Figure 8-21 illustrates how the LARGE function works.

188
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 8-21: 
Using the 
LARGE 
function 
returns the 
nth largest 
number 
from a 
dataset.
	
The idea is fairly simple. In order to identify the top five values in a dataset, 
you first need to identify the fifth largest number (LARGE function to the 
rescue) and then test each value in the dataset to see if it’s bigger than the 
fifth largest number. Here’s what you do:
	
1.	Build a chart feeder that consists of formulas that link back to your raw 
data. The feeder should have two columns: one to hold data that isn’t in 
the top five and one to hold data that is in the top five; see Figure 8-22.
	
Figure 8-22: 
Build a 
new chart 
feeder that 
consists of 
formulas 
that plot 
values into 
one of two 
columns.
	
	
2.	In the first row of the chart feeder, enter the formulas shown in 
Figure 8-22.
	
	 The formula for the first column (F4) checks to see if the value in cell C4 
is less than the number returned by the LARGE formula (the fifth largest 
value). If it is, the value in cell C4 is returned. Otherwise, NA is used. The 

189
 Chapter 8: Grouping and Bucketing Data
formula for the second column works in the same way, except the IF 
statement is reversed: If the value in cell C4 is greater than or equal to 
the number returned by the LARGE formula, then the value is returned; 
otherwise, NA is used.
	
3.	Copy the formulas down to fill the table.
	
4.	Use the chart feeder table to plot the data into a stacked column chart.
	
	 You immediately see a chart that displays two data series: one for data 
points not in the top five, and one for data points in the top five; see 
Figure 8-23.
	
	 Notice that the chart in Figure 8-23 shows some rogue zeros. You can fix 
the chart so that the zeros don’t appear by performing the next few steps.
	
Figure 8-23: 
After adding 
data labels 
to the top 
five data 
series and 
doing a bit 
of format-
ting, your 
chart should 
look similar 
to the one 
shown here.
	
	
5.	Right-click any of the data labels for the “not in top 5” series and 
choose Format Data Labels.
	
	 The Format Data Labels dialog box appears.
	
6.	In this dialog box, expand the Numbers section and select Custom in 
the Category list.
	
7.	Enter #,##0;; as the custom number format, as shown in Figure 8-24.
	
8.	Click Add and then click Close.
When you go back to your chart, you see that the rogue zeros are now hidden 
and your chart is ready for colors, labels, and other formatting you want to 
apply.

190
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
You can apply the same technique to highlight the bottom five values in your 
dataset. The only difference is that instead of using the LARGE function, you 
use the SMALL function. Whereas the LARGE function returns the largest nth 
value from a range, the SMALL function returns the smallest nth value.
	
Figure 8-24: 
Entering 
#,##0;; as 
the custom 
format for a 
data label 
hides all 
zeroes in 
that data 
series.
	
Figure 8-25 illustrates the formulas you use to apply the same technique out­
lined here for the bottom five values.
	
Figure 8-25: 
Use the 
SMALL 
function to 
highlight 
the bottom 
values in a 
chart.
	
The formula for the first column (F22) checks to see if the value in cell C22 is 
greater than the number returned by the SMALL formula (the fifth smallest 
value). If it is, the value in cell C22 is returned. Otherwise, NA is used. The for­
mula for the second column works in the same way except the IF statement 
is reversed: If the value in cell C22 is greater than the number returned by the 
SMALL formula, then NA is used; otherwise the value is returned.

Displaying Performance 
against a Target
In This Chapter

▶	Using progress bars
▶	Creating bullet graphs
▶	Showing performance against a range
H

opefully, this is an easy one to grasp. Someone sets a target, and 
someone else tries to reach that target. The target could be anything 
from a certain amount of revenue to a number of boxes shipped or to phone 
calls made. The business world is full of targets and goals. Your job is to find 
effective ways to represent performance against those targets.
What do I mean by performance against a target? Imagine your goal is to 
break the land speed record, which is currently 763 miles per hour. That 
makes your target 764 miles per hour, which will break the record. After you 
jump into your car and go as fast as you can, you will have a final speed. That 
number is your performance against the target.
In this chapter, I explore some new and interesting ways to create 
­components that show performance against a target.
Showing Performance with Variances
The standard way of displaying performance against a target is to plot the 
target and then plot the performance. This is usually done with a line chart 
or a combination chart, such as the one shown in Figure 9-1.

192
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
	
Figure 9-1: 
A typical 
chart show-
ing per-
formance 
against a 
target.
	
Although this chart allows you to visually pick the points where performance 
exceeded or fell below targets, it gives you a rather one-dimensional view and 
provides minimal information. Even if this chart offered labels that showed 
the actual percent of sales revenue versus target, you’d still get only a mildly 
informative view.
A more effective and informative way to display performance against a target 
is to plot the variances between the target and the performance. Figure 9-2 
shows the same performance data you see in Figure 9-1, but includes the vari­
ances (sales revenue minus target) under the month label. This way, you see 
not only where performance exceeded or fell below targets, but you also get 
an extra layer of information showing the dollar impact of each rise and fall.
Figure 9-2: 
Consider 
using vari-
ances to 
plot per-
formance 
against a 
target.

193
 Chapter 9: Displaying Performance against a Target
Showing Performance against 
Organizational Trends
The target you use to measure performance doesn’t necessarily have to be 
set by management or organizational policy. In fact, some of the things you 
measure may never have a formal target or goal set for them. In situations in 
which you don’t have a target to measure against, it’s often helpful to mea­
sure performance against some organizational statistic.
For example, the component in Figure 9-3 measures the sales performance for 
each division against the median sales for all the divisions. You can see that 
divisions 1, 3, and 6 fall well below the median for the group.
	
Figure 9-3: 
Measuring 
data when 
there’s no 
target for a 
measure.
	
Here’s how you’d create a median line similar to the one you see in Figure 9-3:
	
1.	Start a new column next to your data and type the simple MEDIAN 
formula, as shown in Figure 9-4.
	
	 Note that this formula can be any mathematical or statistical operation 
that works for the data you’re representing. Just make sure that the 
values returned are the same for the entire column. This gives you a 
straight line.
	
2.	Copy the formula down to fill the table.
	
	 Again, all the numbers in the newly created column should be the same.
	
3.	Plot the table into a column chart.

4.	Right-click the Median data series and choose Change Series Chart Type.
	
5.	Change the chart type to a line chart.
	
Figure 9-4: 
Start a new 
column 
and enter a 
formula.
	
Using a Thermometer-Style Chart
A thermometer-style chart offers a unique way to view performance against a 
goal. As the name implies, the data points shown in this type of chart resemble a 
thermometer. Each performance value and its corresponding target are stacked 
on top of one another, giving an appearance similar to that of mercury rising in a 
thermometer. In Figure 9-5, you see an example of a thermometer-style chart.
	
Figure 9-5: 
Thermo- 
meter-style 
charts offer 
a unique 
way to 
show per-
formance 
against a 
goal.
	

195
 Chapter 9: Displaying Performance against a Target
To create this type of chart, follow these steps:
	
1.	Starting with a table that contains revenue and target data, plot the 
data into a new column chart.
	
2.	Right-click the Revenue data series and choose Format Data Series.
	
3.	In the Format Data Series dialog box, select Secondary Axis.
	
4.	Go back to your chart and delete the new vertical axis that was 
added; it’s the vertical axis to the right of the chart.
	
5.	Right-click the Target series and choose Format Data Series.
	
6.	In the dialog box, adjust the Gap Width property so that the Target 
series is slightly wider than the Revenue series — between 45% and 
55% is typically fine.
Using a Bullet Graph
A bullet graph is a type of column/bar graph developed by visualization 
expert Stephen Few to serve as a replacement for dashboard gauges and 
meters. He developed bullet graphs to allow you to clearly display multiple 
layers of information without occupying a lot of space on a dashboard. 
A bullet graph, as seen in Figure 9-6, contains a single performance measure 
(such as YTD [year-to-date] revenue), compares that measure with a target, 
and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges, such as Poor, Fair, Good, and 
Very Good.
	
Figure 9-6: 
Bullet

perspec-
tives in an

196
Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
Figure 9-7 breaks down the three main parts of a bullet graph. The single bar 
represents the performance measure. The horizontal marker represents the 
comparative measure. And the background color banding represents the 
qualitative ranges.
	
Figure 9-7: 
The parts 
of a bullet 
graph.
	
Creating a bullet graph
Creating a bullet graph in Excel involves quite a few steps, but the process 
isn’t necessarily difficult. Follow these steps to create your first bullet graph:
	
1.	Start with a data table that gives you all the data points you need to 
create the three main parts of the bullet graph.
	
	 Figure 9-8 illustrates what that data table looks like. The first four values 
in the dataset (Poor, Fair, Good, and Very Good) make up the qualitative 
range. You don’t have to have four values — you can have as many or as 
few as you need. In this scenario, we want our qualitative range to span 
from 0 to 100%. Therefore, the percentages (70%, 15%, 10%, and 5%) 
must add up to 100%. Again, this can be adjusted to suit your needs. The 
fifth value in Figure 9-8 (Value) creates the performance bar. The sixth 
value (Target) makes the target marker.
	
2.	Select the entire table and plot the data on a stacked column chart.
	
	 The chart that’s created is initially plotted in the wrong direction.
	
3.	To fix the direction, click the chart and select the Switch Row/Column 
button, as shown in Figure 9-9.

4.	Right-click the Target series and choose Change Series Chart Type. 
Use the Change Chart Type dialog box to change the Target series to a 
Line with Markers and to place it on the secondary axis; see Figure 9-10. 
After confirming your change, the Target series appears on the chart 
as a single dot.
	
5.	Right-click the Target series again and choose Format Data Series to 
open that dialog box. Click the Marker option, and adjust the marker 
to look like a dash, as shown in Figure 9-11.
	
6.	Still in the Format Data Series dialog box, expand the Fill section and 
in the Solid Fill property, set the color of the marker to a noticeable 
color such as red.
	
7.	Still in the Format Data Series dialog box, expand the Border section 
and set the Border to No Line.

	 This is an important step to ensure the scale of the chart is correct for 
all data points.
	
9.	Right-click the Value series and choose Format Data Series.
	
10.	In the Format Data Series dialog box, click Secondary Axis.
	
11.	Still in the Format Data Series dialog box, under Series Options, adjust 
the Gap Width property so that the Value series is slightly narrower 
than the other columns in the chart — between 205% and 225% is 
typically okay.

12.	Still in the Format Data Series dialog box, click the Fill icon (the paint 
bucket), expand the Fill section, and then select the Solid Fill option 
to set the color of the Value series to black.
	
13.	All that’s left to do is change the color for each qualitative range to 
incrementally lighter hues.
	
	 At this point, your bullet graph is essentially done! You can apply what­
ever minor formatting adjustments to size and shape of the chart to 
make it look the way you want. Figure 9-13 shows our newly created 
bullet graph formatted with a legend and horizontal labels.

Adding data to your bullet graph
After you’ve built your chart for the first performance measure, you can use 
the same chart for any additional measures. Take a look at Figure 9-14.
	
Figure 9-14: 
To add more 
data to your 
chart, man-
ually expand 
the chart’s 
data source 
range.
	
As you can see in Figure 9-14, you’ve already created this bullet graph with 
the first performance measure. Imagine that you add two more measures and 
want to graph those. Here’s how to do it:
	
1.	Click the chart so that the blue outline appears around the original 
source data.
	
2.	Hover your mouse pointer over the blue dot in the lower-right corner 
of the blue box.
	
	 Your cursor turns into an arrow, as seen in Figure 9-14.
	
3.	Click and drag the blue dot to the last column in your expanded dataset.
	
	 Figure 9-15 illustrates how the new data points are added without one 
ounce of extra work!
Final thoughts on formatting bullet graphs
Before wrapping up this introduction to bullet graphs, I discuss two final 
thoughts on formatting:
	
✓	Creating qualitative bands
	
✓	Creating horizontal bullet graphs

Figure 9-15: 
Expanding

cally cre-
ates new

Creating qualitative bands
First, if the qualitative ranges are the same for all the performance measures 
in your bullet graphs, you can format the qualitative range series to have no 
gaps between them. For instance, Figure 9-16 shows a set of bullet graphs in 
which the qualitative ranges have been set to 0% Gap Width. This creates the 
clever effect of qualitative bands. Here’s how to do it:
	
1.	Right-click any one of the qualitative series and choose Format Data 
Series.
	
2.	In the Format Series dialog box, adjust the Gap Width property to 0%.
	
Figure 9-16: 
Try setting 
gap widths 
to zero 
to create

looking

bands.

Part III: Building Advanced Dashboard Components 
Creating horizontal bullet graphs
For those of you waiting on the section about horizontal bullet graphs, there’s 
good and bad news. The bad news is that creating a horizontal bullet graph from 
scratch in Excel is a much more complex endeavor than creating a vertical bullet 
graph — one that doesn’t warrant the time and effort it takes to create them.
The good news is that there is a clever way to get a horizontal bullet graph 
from a vertical one — and in three steps, no less. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	Create a vertical bullet graph.
	
	 For how to do this, see the “Creating a bullet graph” section earlier in 
this chapter.
	
2.	Change the alignment for the axis and other labels on the bullet graph 
so that they’re rotated 270 degrees; see Figure 9-17.
	
Figure 9-17: 
Rotate all 
labels so 
that they’re 
on their 
sides.
	
	
3.	Use Excel’s Camera tool to take a picture of the bullet graph.
	
	 After you have a picture, you can rotate it to be horizontal. Figure 9-18 
illustrates a horizontal bullet graph.
	
	 The nifty thing about this trick is that because the picture is taken with 
the Camera tool, the picture automatically updates when the source 
table changes.

Showing Performance against 
a Target Range
In some businesses, a target isn’t one value — it’s a range of values. That is 
to say, the goal is to stay within a defined target range. Imagine you manage 
a small business selling boxes of meat. Part of your job is to keep your 
inventory stocked between 25 and 35 boxes in a month. If you have too 
many boxes of meat, the meat will go bad. If you have too few boxes, you’ll 
lose money.
To track how well you do at keeping your inventory of meat between 25 and 
35 boxes, you need a performance component that displays on-hand boxes 
against a target range. Figure 9-19 illustrates a component you can build to 
track performance against a target range. The gray band represents the target 
range you must stay within each month. The line represents the trend of 
on-hand meat.
Obviously, the trick to this type of component is to set up the band that rep­
resents the target range. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	Set up a limit table in which you can define and adjust the upper and 
lower limits of your target range.
	
	 Cells B2 and B3 in Figure 9-20 serve as the place to define the limits for 
the range.

2.	Build a chart feeder that’s used to plot the data points for the target 
range.
	
	 This feeder consists of the formulas revealed in cells B8 and B9 in 
Figure 9-20. The idea is to copy these formulas across all the data. The 
values you see for Feb, Mar, and Apr are the results of these formulas.
	
3.	Add a row for the actual performance values, as shown in Figure 9-21.
	
	 These data points create the performance trend line.
	
4.	Select the entire chart feeder table and plot the data on a stacked 
area chart.

5.	Right-click the Values series and choose Change Series Chart Type. 
Use the Change Chart Type dialog box to change the Values series to

After confirming your change, the Values series appears on the chart 
as a line.

6.	Go back to your chart and delete the new vertical axis that was 
added; it’s the vertical axis to the right of the chart.
	
7.	Right-click the Lower Limit data series and choose Format Data Series.
	
8.	In the Format Data Series dialog, click the Fill icon. Choose the No Fill 
option under Fill, and the No Line option under Border; see Figure 9-23.

labels, and other formatting.

Macro-Charged Dashboarding
In This Chapter
▶	Introducing macros
▶	Recording macros
▶	Setting up trusted locations for your macros
▶	Adding macros to your dashboards and reports
A

macro is essentially a set of instructions or code that you create to tell 
Excel to execute any number of actions. In Excel, macros can be written 
or recorded. The key word here is recorded.
Recording a macro is like programming a phone number into your cell phone. 
You first manually dial and save a number. Then when you want, you can 
redial those numbers with the touch of a button. Just as on a cell phone, you 
can record your actions in Excel while you perform them. While you record, 
Excel gets busy in the background, translating your keystrokes and mouse 
clicks to written code, also known as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). 
After you record a macro, you can play back those actions anytime you want.
In this chapter, you explore macros and learn how you can use them to auto­
mate your recurring processes to simplify your life.
Why Use a Macro?
The first step in using macros is admitting you have a problem. Actually, you 
may have several problems:
Problem 1: Repetitive tasks. As each new month rolls around, you have to 
make the donuts — that is, crank out those reports. You have to import that 
data. You have to update those pivot tables. You have to delete those columns, 
and so on. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could fire up a macro and have those 
more redundant parts of your dashboard processes done automatically?
Problem 2: You’re making mistakes. When you go hand-to-hand combat 
with Excel, you’re bound to make mistakes. When you’re repeatedly 
applying formulas, sorting, and moving things around manually, there’s 

210
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
always that risk of catastrophe. Add to that the looming deadlines and 
constant change requests, and your error rate goes up. Why not calmly 
record a macro, ensure that everything is running correctly, and then 
forget it? The macro is sure to perform every action the same way every 
time you run it, reducing the chance of errors.
Problem 3: Awkward navigation. Remember that you’re creating these 
dashboards and reports for an audience that probably has a limited 
knowledge of Excel. If your reports are a bit too difficult to use and navi­
gate, you’ll find that you’ll slowly lose support for your cause. It’s always 
helpful to make your dashboard more user-friendly.
Here are some ideas for macros that make things easier for everyone:
	
✓	A macro that formats and prints a worksheet or range of worksheets at 
the touch of a button
	
✓	Macros that navigate a multisheet worksheet with a navigation page or 
with a go-to button for each sheet in your workbook
	
✓	A macro that saves the open document in a specified location and then 
closes the application at the touch of a button
Obviously, you can perform each of the preceding examples in Excel with­
out the aid of a macro. However, your audience will appreciate these little 
touches that help make perusal of your dashboard a bit more pleasant.
Recording Your First Macro
If you’re a beginner to dashboard automation, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able 
to write the VBA code by hand. Without full knowledge of Excel’s object 
model and syntax, writing the needed code would be impossible for most 
beginning users. This is where recording a macro comes in handy. The idea 
is that you record the desired action, and then run the macro each time you 
want that action performed.
	
To get started in creating your first macro, open the Chapter 10 Samples file 
found on this book’s companion website. After the file is open, go to the 
Recording your First Macro tab.
To begin, you first need to unhide the Developer tab. You can find the full 
macro toolset in Excel 2013 on the Developer tab, which is initially hidden. 
You have to explicitly tell Excel to make it visible. To enable the Developer 
tab, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the Ribbon and click the File button.
	
2.	To open the Excel Options dialog box, click the Options button.

211
 Chapter 10: Macro-Charged Dashboarding
	
3.	Click the Customize Ribbon button.
	
	 In the list box on the right, you see all the available tabs.
	
4.	Select the Developer tab, as shown in Figure 10-1.
	
Figure 10-1: 
Enabling the 
Developer 
tab.
	
	
5.	  Click OK.
Now that you have the Developer tab, select it and click the Record Macro 
command. This opens the Record Macro dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-2.
	
Figure 10-2: 
The Record 
Macro 
dialog box.
	

212
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
Here are the four fields in the Record Macro dialog box:
	
✓	Macro Name: Excel gives a default name to your macro, such as Macro1, 
but it’s best practice to give your macro a name more descriptive of what 
it actually does. For example, you might name a macro that formats a 
generic table as AddDataBars.
	
✓	Shortcut Key: This field is optional. Every macro needs an event, or 
something to happen, for it to run. This event can be a button press, a 
workbook opening, or in this case, a keystroke combination. When you 
assign a shortcut key to your macro, entering that combination of keys 
triggers your macro to run. You need not enter a shortcut key to run 
your macro.
	
✓	Store Macro In: This Workbook is the default option. Storing your macro 
in This Workbook simply means that the macro is stored along with the 
active Excel file. The next time you open that particular workbook, the 
macro will be available to run. Similarly, if you send the workbook to 
another user, that user can run the macro as well, provided the macro 
security is properly set by your user — but more on that later.
	
✓	Description: This field is optional, but it’s useful if you have numerous 
macros in a spreadsheet or if you need to give a user a more detailed 
description about what the macro does.
In this first example, enter AddDataBars into the Macro Name field and select 
This Workbook from the Store Macro In drop-down menu; see Figure 10-3. 
Press OK.
	
Figure 10-3: 
Start 
recording a 
new Macro 
called 
AddData- 
Bars.
	
Excel is now recording your actions. While Excel is recording, you can per­
form any actions you’d like. In this scenario, you record a macro to add Data 
Bars to a column of numbers.

213
 Chapter 10: Macro-Charged Dashboarding
Follow along using these steps:
	
1.	Highlight cells C1:C21.
	
2.	Go to the Home tab and select Conditional Formatting➪New Rule.
	
3.	In the New Formatting Rule dialog box, go to the Format Style drop-
down menu and select Data Bar.
	
4.	Another dialog box appears. Here, select the Show Bar Only 
check box.
	
5.	Press OK to apply your change.
	
6.	Go to the Developer tab and click the Stop Recording command.
	
	 At this point, Excel stops recording. You now have a macro that replaces 
the data in C1:C21 with Data Bars. Now, let’s record a new macro to 
remove the Data Bars.
	
7.	Go to the Developer tab and click the Record Macro command.
	
8.	Enter RemoveDataBars into the Macro Name field and select the This 
Workbook from the Store Macro In drop-down menu; see Figure 10-4. 
Press OK.
	
Figure 10-4: 
Start 
recording a

9.	Highlight cells C1:C21.
	
10.	Go to the Home tab and select Conditional Formatting➪Clear 
Rules➪Clear Rules from Selected Cells.
	
11.	Go to the Developer tab and click the Stop Recording command.
	
	 Again, Excel stops recording. You now have a new macro that removes 
conditional formatting rules from cells C1:C21.

Running Your Macros
To see your macros in action, select the Macros command from the 
Developer tab. The dialog box in Figure 10-5 appears, allowing you to select 
the macro you want to run. Select the AddDataBars macro and click the 
Run button.
	
Figure 10-5: 
Use the 
Macro 
dialog box 
to select a 
macro and 
run it.
	
If all goes well, the macro plays back your actions to a T and applies the Data 
Bars as designed; see Figure 10-6.
	
Figure 10-6: 
Your macro 
applies Data 
Bars auto-
matically!
	

215
 Chapter 10: Macro-Charged Dashboarding
You can now call up the Macro dialog box again and test the RemoveDataBars 
macro shown in Figure 10-7.
	
Figure 10-7: 
The 
Remove- 
DataBars 
macro

When you create macros, you want to give your audience a clear and easy 
way to run each macro. A button, used directly on the dashboard or report, 
can provide a simple but effective user interface.
Excel Form controls enable you to create user interfaces directly on 
your worksheets, simplifying work for your users. Form controls range 
from buttons (the most commonly used control) to scroll bars and check 
boxes.
For a macro, you can place a Form control in a worksheet and then assign 
that macro to it — that is, a macro you’ve already recorded. When a macro 
is assigned to the control, that macro is executed, or played, each time the 
control is clicked.
Take a moment to create buttons for the two macros (AddDataBars and 
RemoveDataBars) you create earlier in this chapter. Here’s how:
	
1.	Click the Insert drop-down list under the Developer tab.
	
2.	Select the Button Form control, as shown in Figure 10-8.
	
3.	Click the location you want to place your button.
	
	 When you drop the Button control into your worksheet, the Assign 
Macro dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-9, opens and asks you to assign 
a macro to this button.

216
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
Figure 10-8: 
You can find 
the Form 
Controls 
menu on the 
Developer 
tab.
	
	
Figure 10-9: 
Assign a 
macro to 
the newly 
added 
button.
	
	
4.	Select the macro that you want to assign. In this case, select the 
AddDataBars macro and click OK.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1 through 4 for the RemoveDataBars macro.
	
The buttons you create come with a default name, such as Button3. To rename 
your button, right-click the button and then click the existing name. Then you 
can delete the existing name and replace it with a name of your choosing.
Keep in mind that all the controls in the Form Controls menu work in the 
same way as the command button, in that you assign a macro to run when 
the control is selected.

217
 Chapter 10: Macro-Charged Dashboarding
	
Notice the Form Controls and ActiveX Controls in Figure 10-8. Although they 
look similar, they’re quite different. Form controls are designed specifically 
for use on a worksheet, and ActiveX controls are typically used on Excel 
UserForms. As a general rule, you always want to use Form controls when 
working on a worksheet. Why? Form controls need less overhead, so they per­
form better, and configuring Form controls is far easier than configuring their 
ActiveX counterparts.
Enabling and Trusting Macros
With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft introduced significant changes 
to its Office security model. One of the most significant changes is the 
concept of trusted documents. Without getting into the technical minutia, 
a trusted document is essentially a workbook you have deemed safe by 
enabling macros.
Macro-enabled file extensions
It’s important to note that Microsoft has created a separate file extension for 
workbooks that contain macros.
Excel 2007, 2010, and 2013 workbooks have the standard file extension 
.xlsx. Files with the xlsx extension cannot contain macros. If your work­
book contains macros and you then save that workbook as an .xlsx file, 
your macros are removed automatically. Of course, Excel warns you that 
macro content will be disabled when saving a workbook with macros as an 
.xlsx file.
If you want to retain the macros, you must save your file as an Excel Macro-
Enabled Workbook. This gives your file an .xlsm extension. All workbooks 
with an .xlsx file extension are automatically known to be safe, whereas you 
can recognize .xlsm files as a potential threat.
Enabling macro content
If you open a workbook that contains macros in Excel 2013, you’ll get a 
message in the form of a yellow bar under the Ribbon stating that Macros 
(active content) have in effect, been disabled.

218
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
If you click Enable, it automatically becomes a trusted document. This means 
you will no longer be prompted to enable the content as long as you open 
that file on your computer. If you told Excel that you trust a particular work­
book by enabling macros, it’s highly likely that you will enable macros each 
time you open it. Thus, Excel remembers that you’ve enabled macros before 
and inhibits any further messages about macros for that workbook.
This is great news for you and your clients. After enabling your macros just 
one time, they won’t be annoyed at the constant messages about macros, 
and you won’t have to worry that your macro-enabled dashboard will fall flat 
because macros have been disabled.
Setting up trusted locations
If the thought of any macro message coming up (even one time) unnerves 
you, you can set up a trusted location for your files. A trusted location is 
a directory deemed a safe zone where only trusted workbooks are placed. 
A trusted location allows you and your clients to run a macro-enabled work­
book with no security restrictions as long as the workbook is in that location.
To set up a trusted location, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the Macro Security button on the Developer tab.
	
2.	Click the Trusted Locations button.
	
	 This opens the Trusted Locations menu shown in Figure 10-10. Here you 
see all the directories that Excel considers trusted.
	
Figure 10-10: 
The Trusted 
Locations 
menu allows 
you to add 
directories 
that are 
considered 
trusted.
	

219
 Chapter 10: Macro-Charged Dashboarding
	
3.	Click the Add New Location button.
	
4.	Click Browse to find and specify the directory that will be considered 
a trusted location.
	
	 After you specify a trusted location, any Excel file that’s opened from 
this location will have macros automatically enabled. Have your clients 
specify a trusted location and use your Excel files from there.
Excel Macro Examples
Covering the fundamentals of building and using macros is one thing. Coming 
up with good ways to incorporate them into your reporting processes is 
another. Take a moment to review a few examples of how you can implement 
macros in your dashboards and reports.
	
Open the Chapter 10 Samples.xlsm file found on this book’s companion 
website to follow along in the next section.
Building navigation buttons
The most common use of macros is navigation. Workbooks that have many 
worksheets or tabs can be frustrating to navigate. To help your audience, you 
can create some sort of a switchboard, like the one shown in Figure 10-11. When 
users click the Example 1 button, they’re taken to the Example 1 sheet.
	
Figure 10-11: 
Use macros 
to build 
buttons 
that help 
users navi-
gate your 
reports.
	

220
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
Creating a macro to navigate to a sheet is quite simple:
	
1.	Start at the sheet that will become your switchboard or starting point.
	
2.	Start recording a macro.
	
3.	While recording, click the destination sheet — the sheet this macro 
will navigate to.
	
4.	After you click in the destination sheet, stop recording the macro.
	
5.	Assign the macro to a button.
	
It’s useful to know that Excel has a built-in hyperlink feature, allowing you to 
convert the contents of a cell into a hyperlink that links to another location. 
That location can be a separate Excel workbook, a website, or even another 
tab in the current workbook. Although using a hyperlink may be easier 
than setting up a macro, you can’t apply a hyperlink to Form controls (like 
buttons). Instead of a button, you use text to let users know where they’ll 
go when they click the link.
Dynamically rearranging pivot table data
In the example illustrated in Figure 10-12, macros allow a user to change the 
perspective of the chart simply by selecting any one of the buttons shown.
	
Figure 10-12: 
This report 
allows 
users to 
choose their 
perspective.
	
Figure 10-13 reveals that the chart is actually a pivot chart tied to a pivot 
table. The recorded macros assigned to each button are doing nothing more 
than rearranging the pivot table to slice the data using various pivot fields.

221
 Chapter 10: Macro-Charged Dashboarding
	
Figure 10-13: 
The macros 
behind 
these 
buttons 
rearrange 
the data 
fields in a 
pivot table.
	
Here are the high-level steps needed to create this type of setup:
	
1.	Create your pivot table add a pivot chart by clicking inside the pivot 
table and then selecting Insert➪Charts➪Bar.
	
2.	Start recording a macro.
	
3.	While recording, move a pivot field from one area of the pivot table 
to the other. When you’re done, stop recording the macro.
	
4.	Record another macro to move the data field back to its original 
position.
	
5.	After both macros are set up, assign each one to a separate button.
You can fire your new macros in turn to see your pivot field dynamically 
move back and forth.
Offering one-touch reporting options
The last two examples demonstrate that you can record any action that you 
find of value. That is, if you think users would appreciate a certain feature 
being automated for them, why not record a macro to do so?
In Figure 10-14, notice that you can filter the pivot table for top or bottom 
20 customers. Because the steps to filter a pivot table for the top and bottom 20 
have been recorded, anyone can get the benefit of this functionality without 
knowing how to do it themselves. Also, recording specific actions allows you 
to manage risk a bit. That is to say, you’ll know that your users will interact 
with your reports in a method that has been developed and tested by you.

222
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
Figure 10-14:

views not 
only saves 
time and 
effort, but it 
also allows

features to 
benefit from 
them.	
This not only saves them time and effort, but it also allows users that don’t 
know how to take these actions to benefit from them.
Figure 10-15 demonstrates how you can give your audience a quick and easy 
way to see the same data on different charts. Don’t laugh too quickly at the 
uselessness of this example. It’s not uncommon to be asked to see the same 
data different ways. Instead of taking up real estate, just record a macro 
that changes the chart type. Your clients can switch views to their hearts’ 
content.

T

oday, business professionals increasingly want to be empowered to 
switch from one view of data to another with a simple list of choices. For 
those who build dashboards and reports, this empowerment comes with a 
whole new set of issues. The overarching question is — how do you handle a 
user who wants to see multiple views for multiple regions or markets?
Fortunately, Excel offers a handful of tools that enable you to add ­interactivity 
into your presentations. With these tools and a bit of creative data ­modeling, 
you can accomplish these goals with relative ease. In this chapter, you dis­
cover how to incorporate various controls, such as ­buttons, check boxes, and 
scroll bars, into your dashboards and reports. Also, I ­present you with several 
solutions that you can implement.
Getting Started with Form Controls
Excel offers a set of controls called Form controls, designed specifically for 
adding user interface elements directly onto a worksheet. After you place a 
Form control on a worksheet, you can then configure it to perform a ­specific 
task. Later in the chapter, I demonstrate how to apply the most useful 
­controls to a presentation.

224
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
Finding Form controls
You can find Excel’s Form controls on the Developer tab, which is initially 
hidden in Excel 2013. To enable the Developer tab, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the Ribbon and click the File button.
	
2.	To open the Excel Options dialog box, click the Options button.
	
3.	Click the Customize Ribbon button.
	
	 In the list box on the right, you see all the available tabs.
	
4.	Select the check box next to the Developer tab; see Figure 11-1.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
Figure 11-1: 
Enabling the 
Developer 
tab.
	
Now, click the Developer tab and choose the Insert command, as shown in 
Figure 11-2. Here you find two sets of controls: Form controls and ActiveX 
controls. Form controls are designed specifically for use on a spreadsheet, 
whereas ActiveX controls are typically used on Excel UserForms. Because 
Form controls need less overhead and can be configured far easier than their 
ActiveX counterparts, you generally want to use Form controls.

225
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
	
Figure 11-2: 
Form 
controls and  
ActiveX 
controls.
	
Here are the nine Form controls that you can add directly to a worksheet. 
Shown in Figure 11-3, they are as follows:
	
✓	Button: Executes an assigned macro when a user clicks the button.
	
✓	Combo Box: Gives a user an expandable list of options from which to 
choose.
	
✓	Check Box: Provides a mechanism for a select/deselect scenario. When 
selected, it returns a value of True. Otherwise, it returns False.
	
✓	Spin Button: Enables a user to easily increase or decrease a value by 
clicking the up and down arrows.
	
✓	List Box: Gives a user a list of options from which to choose.
	
✓	Option Button: Enables a user to toggle through two or more options 
one at a time. Selecting one option automatically deselects the others.
	
✓	Scroll Bar: Enables a user to scroll to a value or position using a sliding 
scale that can be moved by clicking and dragging the mouse.
	
✓	Label: Allows you to add text labels to your worksheet. You can also 
assign a macro to the label, effectively using it as a button of sorts.
	
✓	Group Box: Typically used for cosmetic purposes, this control serves as 
a container for groups of other controls.

Adding a control to a worksheet
To add a control to a worksheet, simply click the control that you require and 
click the approximate location that you want to place the control. You can 
easily move and resize the control later just as you would a chart or shape.
After you add a control, you want to configure it to define its look, behavior, 
and utility. Each control has its own set of configuration options that allow 
you to customize it for your purposes. To get to these options, right-click the 
control and select Format Control. This opens the Format Control dialog box, 
illustrated in Figure 11-4, with all the configuration options for that control.

227
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
Each control has its own set of tabs that allow you to customize everything 
from formatting to security to configuration arguments. You see different 
tabs based on which control you’re using, but most Form controls have 
the Control tab, where the meat of the configuration lies. Here, you find the 
­variables and settings that need to be defined for the control to function.
	
The Button and Label controls don’t have the Control tab. They have no need 
for one. The button simply fires whichever macro you assign it. As for the 
label, it’s not designed to run macro events.
Throughout the rest of the chapter, you walk through a few exercises that 
demonstrate how to use the most useful controls in a reporting environment. 
At the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of Form controls 
and how they can enhance your dashboards and reports.
Using the Button Control
The Button control gives your audience a clear and easy way to execute the 
macros you’ve recorded. To insert and configure a Button control, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Click the Insert drop-down list under the Developer tab.
	
2.	Select the Button Form control.
	
3.	Click the location in your spreadsheet where you want to place your 
button.
	
	 The Assign Macro dialog box appears and asks you to assign a macro to 
this button, as shown in Figure 11-5.
	
4.	Edit the text shown on the button by right-clicking the button, high­
lighting the existing text, and then overwriting it with your own.
	
Figure 11-5: 
Assign a 
macro to 
the newly 
added

228
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
	 To assign a different macro to the button, simply right-click and select 
Assign Macro to reactivate the Assign Macro dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 11-5.
	
	 When you add macros to a workbook, you’ll have to save that workbook 
as an .xlsm file in order to share your macros with others. If you save the 
workbook as a standard .xlsx file, Excel will strip your macros out of the 
workbook.
Using the Check Box Control
The Check Box control provides a mechanism for selecting/deselecting 
options. When a check box is selected, it returns a value of True. When it 
isn’t selected, False is returned. To add and configure a Check Box control, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Insert drop-down list under the Developer tab.
	
2.	Select the Check Box Form control.
	
3.	Click the location in your spreadsheet where you want to place your 
check box.
	
4.	After you drop the Check Box control onto your spreadsheet, ­right-click 
the control and select Format Control.
	
5.	Click the Control tab to see the configuration options shown in 
Figure 11-6.
	
6.	Select the state in which the check box should open.
	
	 The default selection (Unchecked) typically works for most scenarios, 
so it’s rare that you’d have to change this selection.
	
7.	In the Cell Link box, enter the cell to which you want the check box to 
output its value.
	
	 By default, a Check Box control outputs either True or False, ­depending 
on whether it’s checked. Notice in Figure 11-6 that this ­particular check 
box outputs to cell A5.
	
8.	(Optional) You can select the 3-D Shading check box if you want the 
control to have a three-dimensional appearance.
	
9.	Click OK to apply your changes.
	
To rename the Check Box control, right-click the control, select Edit Text, and 
then overwrite the existing text with your own.

Box control.
	
As Figure 11-7 illustrates, the check box outputs its value to the specified cell. 
If the check box is selected, a value of True is output. If the check box isn’t 
selected, a value of False is output.
	
Figure 11-7:

states of the

If you’re having a hard time figuring out how this could be useful, take a stab 
at this next exercise, which illustrates how you can use a check box to toggle 
a chart series on and off.
Check box example: Toggling 
a chart series on and off
Figure 11-8 shows the same chart twice. Notice that the top chart contains only 
one series, with a check box offering to show 2011 trend data. The bottom chart 
shows the same chart with the check box selected. The on/off nature of the 
Check Box control is ideal for interactivity that calls for a visible/not visible state.

To download the Chapter 11 Samples.xlsx file, go to this book’s ­companion 
website.
You start with the raw data (in Chapter 11 Samples.xlsx) that contains 
both 2011 and 2012 data; see Figure 11-9. The first column has a cell in which 
the Check Box control will output its value (cell A12, in this example). This 
cell will contain either True or False.
Figure 11-9: 
Start with 
raw data 
and a cell 
in which a 
Check Box 
control can 
output its 
value.
Next, create the analysis layer (staging table) that consists of all formulas, as 
shown in Figure 11-10. The chart actually reads from this data, not the raw 
data. This way, you can control what the chart sees.
As you can see in Figure 11-10, the formulas for the 2012 row simply reference 
the cells in the raw data for each respective month. You do that because you 
want the 2012 data to appear at all times.

231
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
Figure 11-10: 
Create a 
staging table 
that will feed 
the chart. 
The values of 
this data are 
all formulas.
For the 2011 row, test the value of cell A12 (the cell that contains the output 
from the check box). If A12 reads True, you reference the respective 2011 
cell in the raw data. If A12 doesn’t read True, the formula uses Excel’s NA() 
function to return an #N/A error. Excel charts can’t read a cell with the #N/A 
error. Therefore, they simply don’t show the data series for any cell that con­
tains #N/A. This is ideal when you don’t want a data series to be shown at all.
	
Notice that the formula shown in Figure 11-10 uses an absolute reference with 
cell A12 — that is, the reference to cell A12 in the formula is prefixed with a 
$ sign ($A12). This ensures that the column references in the formulas don’t 
shift when they’re copied across.
Figure 11-11 illustrates the two scenarios in action in the staging tables. In 
the scenario shown at the bottom of Figure 11-11, cell A12 is True, so the 
staging table actually brings in 2011 data. In the scenario shown at the top of 
Figure 11-11, cell A12 is False, so the staging table returns #N/A for 2011.
	
Figure 11-11: 
When cell 
A12 reads 
True, 2011 
data is  
displayed; 
when it reads 
False, the 
2011 row 
shows only 
#N/A errors.

Finally, create the chart that you saw earlier in this section (refer to Figure 11-8) 
using the staging table. Keep in mind that you can scale this to as many series 
as you like.
Figure 11-12 illustrates a chart that has multiple series whose visibility is 
controlled by Check Box controls. This allows you to make all but two series 
invisible so you can compare those two series unhindered. Then you can 
make another two visible, comparing those.
	
Figure 11-12: 
You can 
use check 
boxes to 
control how 
much data 
is shown in 
your chart at 
one time.
	
Using the Option Button Control
Option buttons allow users to toggle through several options one at a time. 
The idea is to have two or more option buttons in a group. Then selecting 
one option button automatically deselects the others. To add option buttons 
to your worksheet, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Insert drop-down list under the Developer tab.
	
2.	Select the Option Button Form control.
	
3.	Click the location in your spreadsheet where you want to place your 
option button.
	
4.	After you drop the control onto your spreadsheet, right-click the ­control 
and select Format Control.
	
5.	Click the Control tab to see the configuration options shown in 
Figure 11-13.
	
6.	First, select the state in which the option button should open.
	
	 The default selection (Unchecked) typically works for most scenarios, 
so it’s rare that you’d have to change this selection.

233
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
	
7.	In the Cell Link box, enter the cell to which you want the option 
button to output its value.
	
	 By default, an Option Button control outputs a number that corresponds 
to the order it was put onto the worksheet. For instance, the first option 
button you place on your worksheet outputs a number 1, the second 
outputs a number 2, the third outputs a number 3, and so on. Notice in 
Figure 11-13 that this particular control outputs to cell A1.
	
8.	(Optional) You can select the 3-D Shading check box if you want the 
control to have a three-dimensional appearance.
	
9.	Click OK to apply your changes.
	
10.	To add another option button, simply copy the button you created and 
paste as many option buttons as you need.
	
	 The nice thing about copying and pasting is that all the configurations 
you made to the original persist in all the copies.
	
	 To give your option button a meaningful label, right-click the control, 
select Edit Text, and then overwrite the existing text with your own.
Option Button Example: Showing Many 
Views through One Chart
One of the ways you can use option buttons is to feed a single chart with dif­
ferent data, based on the option selected. Figure 11-14 illustrates an example 
of this. When each category is selected, the single chart is updated to show 
the data for that selection.
	
Figure 11-13: 
Formatting 
the Option 
Button 
control.
	

234
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
Figure 11-14: 
This chart is 
dynamically 
fed different 
data based 
on the 
selected 
option 
button.
	
Now, you could create three separate charts and show them all on your 
dashboard at the same time. However, using option buttons as an alternative 
saves valuable real estate by not having to show three separate charts. Plus, 
it’s much easier to troubleshoot, format, and maintain one chart than three.
To create this example, start with three raw datasets — as shown in 
Figure 11-15 — that contain three categories of data; Income, Expense, and 
Net. Near the raw data, reserve a cell where the option buttons output their 
values (cell A8, in this example). This cell contains the ID of the option 
selected: 1, 2, or 3.
	
Figure 11-15: 
Start with  
the raw  
datasets  
and a cell 
where the 
option 
buttons  
can output 
their values.
	

235
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
You then create the analysis layer (the staging table) that consists of all 
formulas, as shown in Figure 11-16. The chart reads from this staging table, 
allowing you to control what the chart sees. The first cell of the staging table 
contains the following formula:
=IF($A$8=1,B9,IF($A$8=2,B13,B17))
	
Figure 11-16: 
Create a 
staging table 
and enter 
this formula 
in the first 
cell.
	
This formula tells Excel to check the value of cell A8 (the cell where the option 
buttons output their values). If the value of cell A8 is 1, which represents the 
value of the Income option, the formula returns the value in the Income dataset 
(cell B9). If the value of cell A8 is 2, which represents the value of the Expense 
option, the formula returns the value in the Expense dataset (cell B13). If the 
value of cell A8 is not 1 or 2, the value in cell B17 is returned.
	
Notice that the formula shown in Figure 11-16 uses absolute references 
with cell A8. That is, the reference to cell A8 in the formula is prefixed with 
$ signs ($A$8). This ensures that the cell references in the formulas don’t 
shift when they’re copied down and across.
To test that the formula is working fine, you could change the value of cell A8 
manually, from 1 to 3. When the formula works, you simply copy the formula 
across and down to fill the rest of the staging table.
When the setup is created, all that’s left to do is create the chart using the 
­staging table. Again, the two major benefits you get from this type of setup are 
that you can make any formatting changes to one chart and it’s easy to add 
another dataset by adding another option button and you can edit your formulas 
easily.

Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
Using the Combo Box Control
The Combo Box control allows users to select from a drop-down list of 
­predefined options. When an item from the Combo Box control is selected, 
some action is taken with that selection. To add a combo box to your 
­worksheet, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Insert drop-down list under the Developer tab.
	
2.	Select the Combo Box Form control.
	
3.	Click the location in your spreadsheet where you want to place your 
combo box.
	
4.	After you drop the control onto your spreadsheet, right-click the ­control 
and select Format Control.
	
5.	Click the Control tab to see the configuration options shown in 
Figure 11-17.
	
6.	In the Input Range setting, identify the range that holds the ­predefined 
items you want to present as choices in the combo box.
	
7.	In the Cell Link box, enter the cell to which you want the combo box 
to output its value.
	
	 A Combo Box control outputs the index number of the selected item. This 
means that if the second item on the list is selected, the number 2 will be 
output. If the fifth item on the list is selected, the number 5 will be output. 
Notice in Figure 11-17 that this particular control outputs to cell E15.

 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
	
8.	In the Drop Down Lines box, enter the number of items you want 
shown at one time.
	
	 You see in Figure 11-17 that this control is formatted to show 12 items at 
one time. This means that when users expand the combo box, they see 
12 items.
	
9.	(Optional) You can select the 3-D Shading check box if you want the 
control to have a three-dimensional appearance.
	
10.	Click OK to apply your changes.
Combo Box Example: Changing Chart 
Data with a Drop-Down Selector
You can use Combo Box controls to give your users an intuitive way to 
select data via a drop-down selector. Figure 11-18 shows a thermometer 
chart that’s controlled by the combo box above it. When a user selects the 
Southwest region, the chart responds by plotting the data for the selected 
region.
	
Figure 11-18: 
Use combo 
boxes to  
give your 
users an 
intuitive 
drop-down 
selector.
	
To create this example, start with the raw dataset shown in Figure 11-19. This 
dataset contains the data for each region. Near the raw data, reserve a cell 
where the combo box will output its value (cell M7, in this example). This cell 
will catch the index number of the combo box entry selected.

238
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
Figure 11-19: 
Start with 
the raw 
dataset and 
a cell where 
the combo 
box can 
output its 
value.
	
You then create the analysis layer (the staging table) that consists of all 
formulas, as shown in Figure 11-20. The chart reads from this staging table, 
allowing you to control what the chart sees. The first cell of the staging table 
contains the following INDEX formula:
=INDEX(P7:P14,$M$7)
	
Figure 11-20: 
Create a 
staging 
table that 
uses the 
INDEX 
function to 
extract the 
appropriate 
data from 
the raw 
dataset.
	
The INDEX function converts an index number to a value that can be 
­recognized. An INDEX function requires two arguments to work properly. 
The first argument is the range of the list you’re working with. The second 
­argument is the index number.

239
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
In this example, you’re using the index number from the combo box (in cell M7) 
and extracting the value from the appropriate range (2012 data in P7:P14). Again, 
notice the use of the absolute $ signs. This ensures that the cell references in the 
formulas don’t shift when they’re copied down and across.
Take another look at Figure 11-20 to see what’s happening. The INDEX for­
mula in cell P2 points to the range that contains the 2012 data. It then cap­
tures the index number in cell M7 (which traps the output value of the combo 
box). The index number happens to be 7. So the formula in cell P2 will extract 
the seventh value from the 2012 data range (in this case, Southwest).
When you copy the formula across, Excel adjusts the formula to extract the 
seventh value from each year’s data range.
After your INDEX formulas are in place, you have a clean staging table that 
you can use to create your chart; see Figure 11-21.
	
Figure 11-21: 
Create a 
chart using 
this clean 
staging 
table.
	
Using the List Box Control
The List Box control allows users to select from a list of predefined choices. 
When an item from the List Box control is selected, some action is taken with 
that selection. To add a list box to your worksheet, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the Insert drop-down list under the Developer tab.
	
2.	Select the List Box Form control.

240
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
3.	Click the location in your spreadsheet where you want to place your 
list box.
	
4.	After you drop the control onto your worksheet, right-click the control 
and select Format Control.
	
5.	Click the Control tab to see the configuration options shown in 
Figure 11-22.
	
Figure 11-22: 
Formatting 
the List Box 
control.
	
	
6.	In the Input Range setting, identify the range that holds the pre­
defined items you want to present as choices in the list box.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 11-22, this list box is filled with region 
selections.
	
7.	In the Cell Link box, enter the cell where you want the list box to 
output its value.
	
	 By default, a List Box control outputs the index number of the selected 
item. This means that if the second item on the list is selected, the 
number 2 will be output. If the fifth item on the list is selected, the 
number 5 will be output. Notice in Figure 11-22 that this particular con­
trol outputs to cell P2. The Selection Type setting allows users to choose 
more than one selection in the list box. The choices here are Single, 
Multi, and Extend. Always leave this setting on Single because Multi and 
Extend work only in the VBA environment.
	
8.	(Optional) You can select the 3-D Shading check box if you want the 
control to have a three-dimensional appearance.
	
9.	Click OK to apply your changes.

241
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
List Box Example: Controlling Multiple 
Charts with One Selector
One of the more useful ways to use a list box is to control multiple charts 
with one selector. Figure 11-23 illustrates an example of this. As a region 
selection is made in the list box, all three charts are fed the data for that 
region, adjusting the charts to correspond with the selection made. Happily, 
all this is done without VBA code, just a handful of formulas and a list box.
Figure 11-23: 
This list 
box feeds 
the region 
selection 
to mul-
tiple charts, 
changing 
each chart 
to corre-
spond with 
the selec-
tion made.
To create this example, start with three raw datasets — as shown in 
Figure 11-24 — that contain three categories of data: Revenues, Net Income %, 
and Gross Margin. Each dataset contains a separate line for each region, 
including one for All Regions.
Figure 11-24: 
Start with 
the raw 
datasets 
that contain 
one line per 
region.

242
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
You then add a list box that outputs the index number of the selected item to 
cell P2; see Figure 11-25.
	
Figure 11-25: 
Add a list 
box and 
note the 
cell where 
the output 
value will be 
placed.
	
Next, create a staging table that consists of all formulas. In this staging table, 
you use the Excel’s CHOOSE function to select the correct value from the raw 
data tables based on the selected region.
	
In Excel, the CHOOSE function returns a value from a specified list of values based 
on a specified position number. For instance, the formula CHOOSE(3,"Red", 
"Yellow", "Green", "Blue") returns Green because Green is the third item 
in the list of values. The formula CHOOSE(1, "Red", "Yellow", "Green", 
"Blue") returns Red. See Chapter 2 to get a detailed look at the CHOOSE 
function.
As you can see in Figure 11-26, the CHOOSE formula retrieves the target ­position 
number from cell P2 (the cell where the list box outputs the index number of 
the selected item) and then matches that position number to the list of cell ref­
erences given. The cell references come directly from the raw data table.
Figure 11-26: 
Use the 
CHOOSE 
function to 
capture the 
correct data 
correspond-
ing to the 
selected 
region.

243
 Chapter 11: Giving Users an Interactive Interface
In the example shown in Figure 11-26, the data that will be returned with this 
CHOOSE formula is 41767. Why? Because cell P2 contains the number 3, and 
the third cell reference within the CHOOSE formula is cell B9.
You enter the same type of CHOOSE formula into the Jan column and then 
copy it across; see Figure 11-27.
	
Figure 11-27: 
Create simi-
lar CHOOSE 
formulas for 
each row/
category 
of data and 
then copy 
the CHOOSE 
formulas 
across 
months.
	
To test that your formulas are working, change the value of cell P2 manually 
by entering 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. When the formulas work, all that’s left to do is create 
the charts using the staging table.
	
If Excel functions like CHOOSE or INDEX are a bit intimidating for you, don’t 
worry. There are literally hundreds of ways to use various combinations of 
Form controls and Excel functions to achieve interactive reporting. The exam­
ples I give in this chapter are designed to give you a sense of how you can 
incorporate Form controls into your dashboards and reports. There are no 
set rules on which Form controls or Excel functions you need to use in your 
model.
Start with basic improvements to your dashboard, using controls and 
­formulas you’re comfortable with. Then gradually try to introduce some 
of the more complex controls and functions. With a little imagination and 
creativity, you can take the basics in this chapter and customize your own 
dynamic dashboards.

Adding Interactivity with 
Pivot Slicers
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding slicers
▶	Creating and formatting standard slicers
▶	Using Timeline slicers
▶	Using slicers as command buttons
S

licers allow you to filter your pivot table in a way that’s similar to the 
way Filter fields filter a pivot table. The difference is that slicers offer 
a user-friendly interface, enabling you to better manage the filter state of 
your pivot table reports. Happily, Microsoft has added another dimension to 
­slicers with the introduction of Timeline slicers. Timeline slicers are designed 
to work specifically with date-based filtering.
In this chapter, you explore slicers and their potential to add an attractive as 
well as interactive user interface to your dashboards and reports.
Understanding Slicers
If you worked your way through Chapter 6, “The Pivotal Pivot Table, you 
know that pivot tables allow for interactive filtering using Filter fields. Filter 
fields are the drop-down lists you can include at the top of your pivot table, 
allowing users to interactively filter for specific data items. As useful as Filter 
fields are, they have always had a couple of drawbacks.
First of all, Filter fields are not cascading filters — meaning, the filters don’t 
work together to limit selections when needed. Take, for example, Figure 12-1. 
You can see that the Region filter is set to the North region. However, the 
Market filter still allows you to select markets that are clearly not in the North 
region (California, for example). Because the Market filter is not in any way 
limited based on the Region Filter field, you have the annoying possibility of 
selecting a market that could yield no data because it’s not in the North region.

246
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
Figure 12-1: 
Default pivot 
table Filter 
fields do 
not work 
together to 
limit filter 
selections.
	
Another drawback is that Filter fields don’t provide an easy way to tell what 
exactly is being filtered when you select multiple items. In Figure 12-2, you 
can see an example of this. The Region filter has been limited to three 
regions: Midwest, North, and Northeast. However, notice that the Region 
filter value shows (Multiple Items). By default, Filter fields show 
(Multiple Items) when you select more than one item. The only way to 
tell what has been selected is to click the drop-down menu. You can imagine 
the confusion on a printed version of this report, in which you can’t click 
down to see which data items make up the numbers on the page.
	
Figure 12-2: 
Filter fields 
show the 
words 
(Multiple 
Items) when 
multiple 
selections 
are made.
	
By contrast, slicers don’t have these issues. Slicers respond to one another. 
As you can see in Figure 12-3, the Market slicer visibly highlights the relevant 
markets when the North region is selected. The rest of the markets are 
muted, signaling that they are not part of the North region.

247
 Chapter 12: Adding Interactivity with Pivot Slicers
	
Figure 12-3: 
Slicers work 
together to 
show you 
relevant 
data items 
based 
on your 
selection.
	
When selecting multiple items in a slicer, you can easily see that multiple 
items have been chosen. In Figure 12-4, you can see that the pivot table 
is being filtered by the Midwest, North, and Northeast regions. No more 
(Multiple Items).
Figure 12-4: 
Slicers do  
a better job 
at displaying

Creating a Standard Slicer
Enough talk. It’s time to create your first slicer. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Place your cursor anywhere inside your pivot table, then go up to the 
Ribbon and click the Analyze tab. There, click the Insert Slicer icon 
shown in Figure 12-5.
	
	 This activates the Insert Slicers dialog box shown in Figure 12-6. Select 
the dimensions you want to filter. In this example, the Region and Market 
slicers are created.

dimensions 
for which 
you want 
slicers 
created.
	
	
2.	After the slicers are created, simply click the filter values to filter your 
pivot table.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 12-7, clicking Midwest in the Region slicer not 
only filters your pivot table, but the Market slicer also responds by high­
lighting the markets that belong to the Midwest region.
	
	 You can also select multiple values by holding down the Ctrl key on your 
keyboard while selecting the needed filters. In Figure 12-8, I held down 
the Ctrl key while selecting Baltimore, California, Charlotte, and Chicago. 
This not only highlights the selected markets in the Market slicer, but it 
also highlights their associated regions in the Region slicer.
	
	 To clear the filtering on a slicer, simply click the Clear Filter icon on the 
target slicer, as shown in Figure 12-9.

Formatting Slicers
If you’re going to use slicers on a dashboard, you should do a bit of 
­formatting to have your slicers match the theme and layout of your 
­dashboard. The ­following sections cover a few common formatting 
­adjustments you can make to your slicers.
Size and placement
A slicer behaves like a standard Excel shape object in that you can move it 
around and adjust its size by clicking it and dragging its position points; 
see Figure 12-10.
	
Figure 12-10: 
Adjust 
the slicer 
size and 
placement 
by dragging 
its position 
points.
	
You can also right-click the slicer and select Size and Properties. This brings 
up the Format Slicer pane illustrated in Figure 12-11, allowing you to adjust 
the size of the slicer, how the slicer should behave when cells are shifted, and 
whether the slicer should appear on a printed copy of your dashboard.
Data item columns
By default, all slicers are created with one column of data items. You can change 
this by right-clicking the slicer and selecting Size and Properties. This brings up 
the Format Slicer pane. Under the Position and Layout section, you can specify 
the number of columns in the slicer. Adjusting the number to 2, as ­demonstrated 
in Figure 12-12, forces the data items to be displayed in 2 ­columns, adjusting the 
number to 3 forces the data items to be displayed in 3 columns, and so on.

Slicer color and style
To change the color and style of your slicer, click it and select a style from 
the Slicer Style gallery on the Slicer Tools Options tab shown in Figure 12-13. 
The default styles available suit a majority of your dashboards, but if you 
want more control over the color and style of your slicer, click the New Slicer 
Style button in the lower-left corner of the Slicer Style gallery, as shown 
in Figure 12-13. This activates a dialog box that enables you to format each 
­component part of the slicer.

Other slicer settings
Right-clicking your slicer and selecting Slicer Settings activates the Slicer 
Settings dialog box shown in Figure 12-14. With this dialog box, you can 
control the look of your slicer’s header, how your slicer is sorted, and how 
filtered items are handled.
	
Figure 12-14:

With minimal effort, your slicers can be integrated nicely into your dashboard 
layout. Figure 12-15 illustrates two slicers and a pivot chart working together 
as a cohesive dashboard component.

253

With a little

the look 
and feel of 
your overall

Controlling Multiple Pivot Tables 
with One Slicer
Another advantage you gain with slicers is that each slicer can be tied to 
more than one pivot table; that is to say, any filter you apply to your slicer 
can be applied to multiple pivot tables.
To connect your slicer to more than one pivot table, simply right-click the 
slicer and select Report Connections. This activates the Report Connections 
dialog box shown in Figure 12-16. Place a check next to any pivot table that 
you want to filter using the current slicer.
	
Figure 12-16: 
Choose the 
pivot tables 
that will be 
filtered by 
this slicer.
	

254
Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
At this point, any filter you apply to your slicer will be applied to all the 
­connected pivot tables. Controlling the filter state of multiple pivot tables is 
a powerful feature, especially in dashboards that run on multiple pivot tables.
Creating a Timeline Slicer
New in Excel 2013 is the Timeline slicer. The Timeline slicer works in the 
same way a standard slicer does, in that it lets you filter a pivot table using a 
visual selection mechanism instead of the old Filter fields. The difference is 
the Timeline slicer is designed to work exclusively with date fields, providing 
an excellent visual method to filter and group the dates in your pivot table.
To create a Timeline slicer, your pivot table must contain a field where all 
the data is formatted as a date. It’s not enough to have a column of data that 
contains a few dates. All the values in your date field must be a valid date and 
formatted as such.
To create a Timeline slicer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Place your cursor anywhere inside your pivot table, and then click the 
Analyze tab on the Ribbon. There, click the Insert Timeline ­command 
shown in Figure 12-17.
	
Figure 12-17: 
Inserting 
a Timeline 
slicer.
	
	
	 The Insert Timelines dialog box shown in Figure 12-18 appears, showing 
you all the available date fields in the chosen pivot table.
	
2.	In the Insert Timelines dialog box, select the date fields for which you 
want to create the timeline.
After your Timeline slicer is created, you can filter the data in your pivot 
table and pivot chart, using this dynamic data selection mechanism. 
Figure 12-19 demonstrates how selecting Mar, Apr, and May in the Timeline 
slicer automatically filters the pivot chart.

Figure 12-19: 
Click a date 
selection to 
filter your 
pivot table or 
pivot chart.
	
Figure 12-20 illustrates how you can expand the slicer range with the mouse 
to include a wider range of dates in your filtered numbers.
Want to quickly filter your pivot table by quarters? Well, that’s easy with 
a Timeline slicer. Simply click the time period drop-down menu and select 
Quarters. As you can see in Figure 12-21, you can also switch to Years or 
Days, if needed.
	
Timeline slicers are not backward compatible; meaning they are usable only 
in Excel 2013. If you open a workbook with Timeline slicers in Excel 2010 or 
previous versions, the Timeline slicers will be disabled.

Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
Using Slicers as Form Controls
In Chapter 11, “Giving Users an Interactive Interface,” you see how to add 
interactivity to a dashboard using data modeling techniques and Form 
­controls. Although the techniques in that chapter are powerful, the one draw­
back is that Excel Form controls are starting to look a bit dated, especially 
when paired with the modern-looking charts that come with Excel 2013.
One clever way to alleviate this problem is to hijack the slicer feature for use as 
a proxy Form control of sorts. Figure 12-22 demonstrates this with a chart that 
responds to the slicer on the left. When you click the Income selection, the chart 
fills with income data. When you click Expense, the chart fills with expense data. 
Keep in mind that the chart itself is in no way connected to a pivot table.

Figure 12-22: 
You can 
hijack pivot 
slicers and 
use them as 
more attrac-
tive Form 
controls for 
models not 
built on pivot 
tables.
To build this basic model, follow these steps:
	
1.	Create a simple table that holds the names you’d like for your 
controls, along with some index numbering.
	
	 In this case, the table should contain three rows under a field called 
Metric. Each row should contain a metric name and index number for 
each metric (Income, Expense, and Net).
	
2.	Create a pivot table using that simple table, illustrated in Figure 12-23.
	
3.	Place your cursor anywhere inside your newly created pivot table, 
click the Analyze tab, and then click the Insert Slicer icon. In the 
Insert Slicers dialog box, create a slicer for the Metric field.
	
	 At this point, you have a slicer with the three metric names.
	
Figure 12-23:

that holds

for your

After you 
have that, 
create a 
pivot table 
from it.

Part IV: Advanced Reporting Techniques 
	
4.	Right-click the slicer and choose Slicer Settings to activate the Slicer 
Settings dialog box.
	
5.	In the Slicer Settings dialog box, deselect the Display Header check 
box shown in Figure 12-24.
	
	 Each time you click the Metric slicer, the associated pivot table is 
filtered to show only the selected metric. Figure 12-25 demonstrates 
that this also filters the index number for that metric. The filtered index 
number will always show up in the same cell (N8 in this case). So this 
cell can now be used as a trigger cell for: VLOOKUP formulas, index 
formulas, IF statements, and so on.
	
6.	Use the slicer-fed trigger cell (N8) to drive the formulas in your 
staging area as demonstrated in Figure 12-26.
	
	 This formula tells Excel to check the value of cell N8. If the value of cell N8 
is 1, which represents the value of the Income option, the formula returns 
the value in the Income dataset (cell G9). If the value of cell N8 is 2, which

represents the value of the Expense option, the formula returns the value 
in the Expense dataset (cell G13). If the value of cell N8 is not 1 or 2, the 
value in cell G17 is returned.
	
7.	Copy the formula down and across to build out the full staging table; 
see Figure 12-27.
	
8.	The final step is to simply create a chart using the staging table as 
the source.
	
	 With this simple technique, you can provide your customers with an 
attractive interactive menu that more effectively adheres to the look and 
feel of their dashboards.

W

ouldn’t it be wonderful if all the data you come across could be neatly 
packed into one easy-to-use Excel table? The reality is that sometimes 
the data you need comes from external data sources. External data is exactly 
what it sounds like: data that isn’t located in the Excel workbook in which you’re 
operating. Some examples of external data sources are text files, Access tables, 
SQL Server tables, and even other Excel workbooks.
This chapter explores some efficient ways to get external data into your Excel 
data models. Before jumping in, however, your humble author wants to throw 
out one disclaimer: There are numerous ways to get data into Excel. In fact, 
between the functionality found in the UI and the VBA/code techniques, there 
are too many techniques to focus on in one chapter. Instead, then, in this 
chapter I focus on a handful of techniques that can be implemented in most 
situations and don’t come with a lot of pitfalls and gotchas.
Importing Data from Microsoft Access
Microsoft Access is used in many organizations to manage a series of tables 
that interact with each other, such as a Customers table, an Orders table, and 
an Invoices table. Managing data in Access provides the benefit of a relational 
database in which you can ensure data integrity, prevent redundancy, and 
easily generate datasets via queries.
Excel 2013 offers several methods for getting your Access data into your 
Excel data model.

264
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
The drag-and-drop method
For simplicity, you just can’t beat the drag-and-drop method. You can simulta­
neously open an empty Excel workbook and an Access database from which 
you want to import a table or query. When both are open, resize each appli­
cation’s window so that they’re both fully visible on your screen.
Hover the mouse pointer over the Access table or query you want to copy 
into Excel. Now click the table and drag it to the blank worksheet in Excel, 
illustrated in Figure 13-1.
	
Figure 13-1: 
Copy an 
Access 
table using 
the drag-
and-drop 
method.
	
The drag-and-drop method comes in handy when you’re doing a quick one-time 
analysis in which you need a specific set of data in Excel. However, the method 
isn’t so useful under the following conditions:
	
✓	You expect this step to occur routinely, as part of a repeated analysis or 
report.
	
✓	You expect the users of your Excel presentation to get or update the 
data via this method.
	
✓	It’s not possible or convenient for you to simply open up Access every 
time you need the information.
In these scenarios, it’s much better to use another technique.

265
 Chapter 13: Using External Data for Your Dashboards and Reports
The Microsoft Access Export wizard
Access has an Export wizard, and it’s relatively simple to use. Just follow 
these steps:
	
1.	With your Access database open, click your target table or query to 
select it.
	
2.	On the External Data tab on the Ribbon, select the Excel icon under 
the Export group.
	
	 The wizard that you see in Figure 13-2 opens.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 13-2, you can specify certain options in the 
Excel Export wizard. You can specify the file location, the file type, and 
some format preservation options.
	
Figure 13-2: 
Export 
data to 
Excel using 
the Excel

wizard.
	
	
3.	In the Excel Export wizard, select Export Data with Formatting 
and Layout; then select Open the Destination File After the Export 
Operation is Complete.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 Excel opens to show you the exported data.
	
	 In Access, the last page in the Export wizard, shown in Figure 13-3, asks 
if you want to save your export steps. Saving your export steps can be 
useful if you expect to frequently send that particular query or table to 
Excel. The benefit to this method is that, unlike dragging and dropping, 
the ability to save export steps allows you to automate your exports by 
using Access macros.

266
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
	
Figure 13-3: 
Use the 
Save  
Export 
Steps 
option if 
you export 
your data 
frequently.
	
	
	
You may export your Access table or query to an existing Excel file instead 
of creating a new file. But note the following: the name of the exported 
object is the name of the table or query in Access. Be careful if you have 
an Excel object with that same name in your workbook because it may be 
overwritten. For example, exporting an Access table named PriceMaster 
to an Excel worksheet that already has a worksheet named PriceMaster 
causes the original Excel PriceMaster worksheet to be overwritten. Also, 
make sure the workbook to which you’re exporting is closed. If you try to 
export to an open workbook, you’ll likely receive an error in Access.
The Get External Data icon
The option to pull data from Access has been available in Excel for many 
versions; it was just buried several layers deep in somewhat cryptic menu 
titles. This made getting Access data into Excel seem like a mysterious and 
tenuous proposition for many Excel analysts. With the introduction of the 
Ribbon in Excel 2007, Microsoft put the Get External Data group of commands 
right on the Ribbon under the Data tab, making it easier to import data from 
Access and other external data sources.
Excel allows you to establish an updatable data connection between Excel 
and Access. To see the power of this technique, walk through these steps:
	
1.	Open a new Excel workbook and click the Data tab on the Ribbon.
	
2.	In the Get External Data group, select the From Access icon.
	
	 The Select Data Source dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-4. If the 
database from which you want to import data is local, browse to the file’s 
location and select it. If your target Access database resides on a network 
drive at another location, you need the proper authorization to select it.

267
 Chapter 13: Using External Data for Your Dashboards and Reports
	
Figure 13-4: 
Choose 
your source 
database.
	
	
3.	Navigate to your sample database and click Open.
	
	 In some environments, a series of Data Link Properties dialog boxes 
opens asking for credentials (that is, username and password). Most 
Access databases don’t require logon credentials, but if your database 
does require a username and password, type them in the Data Link 
Properties dialog box.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 The Select Table dialog box shown in Figure 13-5 opens. This dialog box 
lists all the available tables and queries in the selected database.
	
	 The Select Table dialog box contains a column called Type. There are 
two types of Access objects you can work with: views and tables. VIEW 
indicates that the dataset listed is an Access query, and TABLE indicates 
that the dataset is an Access table. In this example, Sales_By_Employee 
is actually an Access query. This means that you import the results of 
the query. This is true interaction at work; Access does all the back-end 
data management and aggregation, and Excel handles the analysis and 
presentation!

268
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
	
Figure 13-5: 
Select the 
Access 
object you 
want to 
import.
	
	
5.	Select your target table or query and click OK.
	
	 The Import Data dialog box shown in Figure 13-6 opens. Here you define 
where and how to import the table. You have the option of importing 
the data into a Table, a PivotTable Report, a PivotChart, or a Power View 
Report. You also have the option of creating only the connection, making 
the connection available for later use.
	
	 Note that if you choose PivotChart or PivotTable Report, the data is 
saved to a pivot cache without writing the actual data to the worksheet. 
Thus your pivot table can function as normal without you having to 
import potentially hundreds of thousands of data rows twice (once for 
the pivot cache and once for the spreadsheet).

6.	Select Table as the output view and define cell A1 as the output location, 
as shown in Figure 13-6.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 Your reward for all your work is a table similar to the one shown in 
Figure 13-7, which contains the imported data from your Access database.
	
Figure 13-7: 
Your

Access 
data.
	
The incredibly powerful thing about importing data this way is that it’s 
refreshable. That’s right. If you import data from Access using this technique, 
Excel creates a table that you can update by right-clicking it and selecting 
Refresh from the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 13-8. When you update 
your imported data, Excel reconnects to your Access database and imports 
the data again. As long as a connection to your database is available, you can 
refresh with a mere click of the mouse.
	
Figure 13-8:

­connection 
to your 
database is 
available, 
you can 
update your 
table with 
the latest 
data.
	

270
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
Again, a major advantage to using the Get External Data group is that you can 
establish a refreshable data connection between Excel and Access. In most 
cases, you can set up the connection one time and then just update the data 
connection when needed. You can even record an Excel macro to update the 
data on some trigger or event, which is ideal for automating the transfer of 
data from Access.
Managing external data properties
When you import external data into a table, 
you can control a few adjustable properties via 
the Properties dialog box. You can get to the 
properties of a particular external data table 
by clicking the target table and clicking the 
Properties icon under the Data tab.
This activates the External Data Properties dialog 
box. The properties found in this dialog box allow 
you to further customize your query tables to suit 
your needs. Take a moment to familiarize yourself 
with some of the useful options in this dialog box.
	✓	Include Row Numbers: This property is dese­
lected by default. Selecting this property 
creates a dummy column that contains row 
numbers. The first column of your dataset 
will be this row number column upon refresh.
	✓	Adjust Column Width: This property is 
selected by default, telling Excel to adjust 
the column widths each time the data is 
refreshed. Deselecting this option will cause 
the column widths to remain the same.
	✓	Preserve Column/Sort/Filter/Layout: If 
this property is selected, the order of the 
columns and rows of the Excel range 
remains unchanged. This way, you can 
rearrange and sort the columns and rows 
of the external data in your worksheet 
without worrying about blowing away 
your formatting each time you refresh. 
Deselecting this property will make the 
Excel range look like the query.
	✓	Preserve Cell Formatting: This property is 
selected by default, telling Excel to keep the 
applied cell formatting when you refresh.
	✓	Insert Cells for New Data, Delete Unused 
Cells: This is the default setting for data 
range changes. This option will insert cells 
(not rows) when the imported table grows 
and delete cells (not rows) when it shrinks.
	✓	Insert Entire Rows for New Data, Clear 
Unused Cells: This option will insert whole 
rows when the imported table grows and 
clear cells (not delete rows) when it shrinks.
	✓	Overwrite Cells for New Data, Clear 
Unused Cells: This option will overwrite 
cells when the imported table grows clear 
cells (not delete rows) when it shrinks.

Importing Data from SQL Server
In the spirit of collaboration, Excel 2013 vastly improves your ability to connect 
to transactional databases such as SQL Server. With the connection functionality 
found in Excel, creating a connected table or pivot table from SQL Server 
data is as easy as ever.
Start on the Data tab and follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the From Other Sources icon to see the drop-down menu shown 
Figure 13-9; then select From SQL Server.
	
	 Selecting this option activates the Data Connection Wizard, as shown in 
Figure 13-10. Here, you configure your connection settings so Excel can 
establish a link to the server.

2.	Provide Excel with some authentication information.
	
	 Enter the name of your server as well as your username and password; 
see Figure 13-10. If you’re typically authenticated via Windows authenti­
cation however, simply select the Use Windows Authentication option.
	
3.	Select the database with which you’re working from a drop-down 
menu containing all available databases on the specified server.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 13-11, a database called AdventureWorks2012 
is selected in the drop-down box. All the tables and views in this data­
base are shown in the list of objects below the drop-down menu.

and then 
choose the 
table or 
view you

4.	Choose the table or view you want to analyze and then click Next.
	
5.	In the screen that appears in the wizard, enter descriptive informa­
tion about the connection you’ve just created. See Figure 13-12 for an 
example.
	
	 This information is optional. If you bypass this screen without editing 
anything, your connection will work fine.
	
	 The fields that you use most often are
 
• File Name: In the File Name input box, you can change the filename 
of the ODC (Office Data Connection) file generated to store the 
configuration information for the link you just created.
 
• Save Password in File: Under the File Name input box, you have 
the option of saving the password for your external data in the 
file itself (via the Save Password in File check box). Selecting this 
check box actually enters your password in the file. This password 
is not encrypted, so anyone interested enough could potentially 
get the password for your data source by simply viewing your file 
with a text editor.

 Chapter 13: Using External Data for Your Dashboards and Reports
 
• Description: In the Description field, you can enter a plain description 
of what this particular data connection does.
 
• Friendly Name: The Friendly Name field allows you to specify your 
own name for the external source. You typically enter a name that 
is descriptive and easy to read.

how to import your data. As you can see Figure 13-13, this data will be 
shown in a pivot table.

L

et’s face it; you’re not making these dashboards and reports for your 
health. At some point, you’ll want to share your handiwork with others. 
The focus of this chapter is on preparing your dashboards for life outside 
your PC. Here, you explore the various methods of protecting your work from 
accidental and intentional meddling, and discover how you can distribute 
your dashboards via PowerPoint, PDF, and the web.
Protecting Your Dashboards and Reports
You’ve put in a ton of hours getting your dashboard and reports to work the 
way you want them to. The last thing you need is to have a clumsy client or 
an overzealous power-user botching up your Excel file.
Before distributing any Excel-based work, you should always consider protecting 
your file using the protection capabilities native to Excel. Although none of 
Excel’s protection methods are hacker-proof, they do serve to avoid accidental 
corruption and to protect sensitive information from unauthorized users.
Securing access to the entire workbook
Perhaps the best way to protect your Excel file is to use Excel’s protection 
options for file sharing. These options enable you to apply security at the 
workbook level, requiring a password to view or make changes to the file. 

276
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
This method is by far the easiest to apply and manage because there’s no need 
to protect each worksheet one at a time. You can apply a blanket protection to 
guard against unauthorized access and edits. Take a moment to review the 
file-sharing options, which are as follows:
	
✓	Setting read-only access to a file until a password is given
	
✓	Requiring a password to open an Excel file
	
✓	Removing workbook-level protection
The next few sections discuss these options in detail.
Permitting read-only access unless a password is given
You can set your workbook to read-only mode until the user types the password. 
This way, you can keep your file safe from unauthorized changes, yet still 
allow authorized users to edit the file.
Here are the steps to force read-only mode:
	
1.	With your file open, click the File button.
	
2.	To open the Save As dialog box, click Save As and then double-click 
the Computer icon.
	
3.	In the Save As dialog box, click the Tools button and select General 
Options, as shown in Figure 14-1.
	
	 The General Options dialog box appears.
Figure 14-1:

sharing 
options 
are hidden

the Save 
As dialog 
box under

4.	Type an appropriate password in the Password to Modify input box 
shown in Figure 14-2, and click OK.
	
Figure 14-2:

password 
needed to 
modify the 
file.
	
	
5.	Excel asks you to reenter your password, so reenter your chosen 
password.
	
6.	Save your file to a new name.
	
	 At this point, your file is password-protected from unauthorized 
changes. If you were to open your file, you’d see something similar to 
Figure 14-3. Failing to type the correct password causes the file to go 
into read-only mode.
	
	 Note that Excel passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure Caps Lock 
on your keyboard is turned off when entering your password.
	
Figure 14-3: 
A password 
is now 
needed 
to make 
changes to 
the file.
	

278
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
Requiring a password to open an Excel file
You may have instances in which your Excel dashboards are so sensitive that 
only certain users are authorized to see them. In these cases, you can require 
users to enter a password to open the workbook. Here are the steps to set up 
a password for the file:
	
1.	With your file open, click the File button.
	
2.	To open the Save As dialog box, click Save As and then double-click 
the Computer icon.
	
3.	In the Save As dialog box, click the Tools button and select General 
Options (refer to Figure 14-1).
	
	 The General Options dialog box opens.
	
4.	Type an appropriate password in the Password to Open text box, as 
shown in Figure 14-4, and click OK.
	
5.	Excel asks you to reenter your password.
	
6.	Save your file to a new name.
	
	 At this point, your file is password-protected from unauthorized viewing.
	
Figure 14-4: 
Type the 
password 
needed to 
modify the 
file.
	
Removing workbook-level protection
Removing workbook-level protection is as easy as clearing the passwords 
from the General Options dialog box. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	With your file open, click the File button.
	
2.	To open the Save As dialog box, click Save As.
	
3.	In the Save As dialog box, click the Tools button and select General 
Options (refer to Figure 14-1).
	
	 The General Options dialog box opens.

279
 Chapter 14: Sharing Your Workbook with the Outside World
	
4.	Clear the Password to Open input box as well as the Password to 
Modify input box and then click OK.
	
5.	Save your file.
	
	 When you select the Read-Only Recommended check box in the General 
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 14-4), you get a cute but useless 
message recommending read-only access upon opening the file. This 
message is only a recommendation and doesn’t prevent anyone from 
opening the file as read/write.
Limiting access to specific 
worksheet ranges
You may find that you need to lock specific worksheet ranges, preventing 
users from taking certain actions. For example, you may not want users to 
break your data model by inserting or deleting columns and rows. You can 
prevent this by locking those columns and rows.
Unlocking editable ranges
By default, all cells in a worksheet are set to be locked when you apply 
worksheet-level protection. The cells on that worksheet can’t be altered in 
any way. That being said, you may find you need certain cells or ranges to be 
editable even in a locked state, like the example shown in Figure 14-5.
Figure 14-5: 
Though this 
sheet is 
protected, 
users can 
enter 2006 
data into the 
input cells 
provided.

280
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
Before you protect your worksheet, you can unlock the cell or range of cells 
that you want users to be able to edit. (The next section shows you how to 
protect your entire worksheet.) Here’s how to do it:
	
1.	Select the cells you need to unlock.
	
2.	Right-click and select Format Cells.
	
3.	On the Protection tab, as shown in Figure 14-6, deselect the Locked 
check box.
	
4.	Click OK to apply the change.

2.	Type a password in the text box shown in Figure 14-8, and then click OK.
	
	 This is the password that removes worksheet protection. Note that 
because you can apply and remove worksheet protection without a 
password, specifying one is optional.
	
3.	In the list box shown in Figure 14-8, select which elements users can 
change after you protect the worksheet.
	
	 When a check box is cleared for a particular action, Excel prevents users 
from taking that action.

Protect sheet elements and actions
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the other actions you can 
limit when protecting a worksheet (refer to Figure 14-8). They are as follows:
	
✓	Select Locked Cells: Allows or prevents the selection of locked cells.
	
✓	Select Unlocked Cells: Allows or prevents the selection of unlocked cells.
	
✓	Format Cells: Allows or prevents the formatting of cells.
	
✓	Format Columns: Allows or prevents the use of column formatting com­
mands, including changing column width or hiding columns.
	
✓	Format Rows: Allows or prevents the use of row formatting commands, 
including changing row height or hiding rows.
	
✓	Insert Columns: Allows or prevents the inserting of columns.
	
✓	Insert Rows: Allows or prevents the inserting of rows.

282
Part V: Working with the Outside World 
	
✓	Insert Hyperlinks: Allows or prevents the inserting of hyperlinks.
	
✓	Delete Columns: Allows or prevents the deleting of columns. Note that 
if Delete Columns is protected and Insert Columns is not protected, you 
can technically insert columns you can’t delete.
	
✓	Delete Rows: Allows or prevents the deleting of rows. Note that if Delete 
Rows is protected and Insert Rows is not protected, you can technically 
insert rows you can’t delete.
	
✓	Sort: Allows or prevents the use of Sort commands. Note that this 
doesn’t apply to locked ranges. Users can’t sort ranges that contain 
locked cells on a protected worksheet, regardless of this setting.
	
✓	Use AutoFilter: Allows or prevents the use of Excel’s AutoFilter function­
ality. Users can’t create or remove AutoFiltered ranges on a protected 
worksheet, regardless of this setting.
	
✓	Use PivotTable Reports: Allows or prevents the modifying, refreshing, 
or formatting pivot tables found on the protected sheet.
	
✓	Edit Objects: Allows or prevents the formatting and altering of shapes, 
charts, text boxes, controls, or other graphics objects.
	
✓	Edit Scenarios: Allows or prevents the viewing of scenarios.
Removing worksheet protection
Just follow these steps to remove any worksheet protection you may 
have applied:
	
1.	Click the Unprotect Sheet icon on the Review tab.
	
2.	If you specified a password while protecting the worksheet, Excel asks 
you for that password; see Figure 14-9. Type the password and click 
OK to immediately remove protection.

Protecting the workbook structure
If you look under the Review tab on the Ribbon, you see the Protect Workbook 
icon next to the Protect Sheet icon. Protecting the workbook enables you to 
prevent users from taking any action that affects the structure of your workbook, 
such as adding/deleting worksheets, hiding/unhiding worksheets, and naming 
or moving worksheets. Just follow these steps to protect a workbook:
	
1.	To open the Protect Structure and Windows dialog box shown in 
Figure 14-10, click the Protect Workbook icon on the Review tab of 
the Ribbon.
	
Figure 14-10:  
The Protect

2.	Choose which elements you want to protect: workbook structure, 
windows, or both. When a check box is cleared for a particular action, 
Excel prevents users from taking that action.
	
	 Selecting Structure prevents users from doing the following:
 
• Viewing worksheets that you’ve hidden
 
• Moving, deleting, hiding, or changing the names of worksheets
 
• Inserting new worksheets or chart sheets
 
• Moving or copying worksheets to another workbook
 
• Displaying the source data for a cell in a pivot table Values area or 
displaying pivot table Filter pages on separate worksheets
 
• Creating a scenario summary report
 
• Using an Analysis ToolPak utility that requires results to be placed 
on a new worksheet
 
• Recording new macros

Linking Your Excel Dashboards 
to PowerPoint
You may find that your organization heavily favors PowerPoint presentations 
for periodic updates. Several methods exist for linking your Excel dashboards 
to a PowerPoint presentation. For current purposes, we focus on the method 
that is most conducive to presenting frequently updated dashboards and 
reports in PowerPoint — creating a dynamic link. A dynamic link allows your 
PowerPoint presentation to automatically pick up changes that you make to 
data in your Excel worksheet.
	
This technique of linking Excel charts to PowerPoint is ideal if you aren’t profi­
cient at building charts in PowerPoint. Build the chart in Excel and then create 
a link for the chart in PowerPoint.
Creating a link between 
Excel and PowerPoint
When you create a link to a range in Excel, PowerPoint stores the location 
information to your source field and then displays a representation of the 
linked data. The net effect is that when the data in your source file changes, 
PowerPoint updates its representation of the data to reflect the changes.
You can find the example Chapter 14 Samples.xlsx file for this chapter 
on this book’s companion website.
To test this concept of linking to an Excel range, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Chapter 14 Samples.xlsx file.
	
2.	Click the chart to select it and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard to copy 
the chart.
	
3.	Open a new PowerPoint presentation and place your cursor at the 
location that you want to display the linked table.

285
 Chapter 14: Sharing Your Workbook with the Outside World
	
4.	On the Home tab in PowerPoint, choose Paste➪Paste Special, as 
shown in Figure 14-11.
	
	 The Paste Special dialog box appears, illustrated in Figure 14-12.
	
Figure 14-11:

Chart Object.
	
	
5.	Select the Paste Link radio button and choose Microsoft Excel Chart 
Object from the list of document types.
	
6.	Click OK to apply the link.
	
	 Your chart on your PowerPoint presentation now links back to your 
Excel worksheet. See Figure 14-13 for an example.
	
	 If you’re copying multiple charts, select the range of cells that contains 
the charts and press Ctrl+C to copy. This way, you’re copying everything 
in that range of cells — charts and all.

Manually updating links 
to capture updates
The nifty thing about dynamic links is that they can be updated, enabling you 
to capture any new data in your Excel worksheets without re-creating the 
links. To see how this works, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go back to your Excel file (from the example in the previous ­section) 
and change the values for Samsung and Nokia, as shown in 
Figure 14-14.
	
	 Note the chart has changed.

2.	Return to PowerPoint, right-click the chart link in your presentation, 
and choose Update Link, as demonstrated in Figure 14-15.
	
	 You see that your linked chart automatically captures the changes.
	
Figure 14-15:  
You can

3.	Save and close both your Excel file and your PowerPoint presentation 
and then open only your newly created PowerPoint presentation.
	
	 Now you see the message shown in Figure 14-16. Clicking the Update 
Links button updates all links in the PowerPoint presentation. Each time 
you open any PowerPoint presentation with links, it asks you whether 
you want to update the links.

Automatically updating links
Having PowerPoint ask you whether you want to update the links each and 
every time you open your presentation quickly gets annoying. You can avoid 
this message by telling PowerPoint to automatically update your dynamic 
links upon opening the presentation file. Here’s how:
	
1.	In PowerPoint, click the File button to get to the Backstage View.
	
2.	In the Info Pane, go to the lower-right corner of the screen and select 
Edit Links to Files, as shown in Figure 14-17.
	
	 The Links dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-18.

3.	Click each of your links and select the Automatic radio button.
	
	 When your links are set to update automatically, PowerPoint automati­
cally synchronizes with your Excel worksheet file and ensures that all 
your updates are displayed.
	
	 To select multiple links in the Links dialog box, press the Ctrl key on 
your keyboard while you select your links.
Distributing Your Dashboards via a PDF
Starting with Excel 2010, Microsoft has made it possible to convert your Excel 
worksheets to a PDF (portable document format). A PDF is the standard 
document-sharing format developed by Adobe.
Although it may not seem intuitive to distribute your dashboards with PDF 
files, some distinct advantages make PDF an attractive distribution tool:
	
✓	Distributing your reports and dashboards as a PDF file allows you to 
share your final product without sharing all the formulas and back-end 
plumbing that comes with the workbook.
	
✓	Dashboards appear in PDF files with full fidelity, meaning they appear 
consistently on any computer and screen resolution.
	
✓	PDF files can be used to produce high-quality prints.
	
✓	Anyone using the free Adobe Reader can post comments and sticky 
notes on the distributed PDF files.
	
✓	Unlike Excel’s security, the security in a PDF is generally better, allowing 
for multiple levels of security, including public-key encryption and 
certificates.
To convert your workbook to a PDF, follow these simple steps:
	
1.	Click the File button and then choose the Export command.
	
2.	In the Export pane, select Create PDF/XPS Document, and then click 
the Create PDF/XPS button see Figure 14-19.

Distributing Your Dashboards 
to SkyDrive
SkyDrive is Microsoft’s answer to Google Docs. You can think of it as a 
Microsoft Office platform in the cloud, allowing you to save, view, and edit 
your Office documents on the web.
When you publish your Excel dashboards or reports to SkyDrive, you can
	
✓	View and edit your workbooks from any browser, even if the computer 
you’re using doesn’t have Excel installed.
	
✓	Provide a platform where two or more people can collaborate on and 
edit the same Excel file at the same time.
	
✓	Share only specific sheets from your workbook by hiding sheets you 
don’t want the public to see. When a sheet in a published workbook is 
hidden, the browser doesn’t even recognize its existence, so there is no 
way for the sheet to be unhidden or hacked into.
	
✓	Offer up web-based interactive reports and dashboards that can be 
sorted and filtered.

To publish a workbook to SkyDrive, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the File button on the Ribbon, click the Save As command, and 
choose SkyDrive as demonstrated in Figure 14-22.
	
	 The SkyDrive pane allows you to sign in to your SkyDrive account.
	
	 If you don’t have a SkyDrive account, you can sign up for one using the

workbook will be viewable to the public.
 
 The Browser View Options dialog box allows you to control what the 
public is able to see and manipulate in your workbook.
	
4.	Click the Show tab illustrated in Figure 14-24.
	
	 Here, you can select and deselect sheets and other Excel objects. 
Removing the check next to any sheet or object prevents it from being 
viewable through the browser. Again, this is a fantastic way to share 
your dashboard interfaces without exposing the back-end calculations 
and data models.

5.	After you confirm your browser view options, save the file into your 
Documents folder.
	
	 At this point, you can sign in to Live.com and navigate to your SkyDrive 
documents to see your newly published file.
There are several ways to share your newly published workbook:
	
✓	Copy the web link from the browser address bar and e-mail that to your 
cohorts.
	
✓	Click the File button in the web version of your file, choose Share, as 
shown in Figure 14-25, and then click the Share with People command to 
send an e-mail to anyone you specify.
	
✓	Use the Embed command on the same Share pane to generate HTML 
code to embed your workbook into a web page or blog.

Limitations when Publishing to the Web
It’s important to understand that workbooks that run on the web are running 
in an Excel Web App that is quite different from the Excel client application 
you have on your PC. The Excel Web App has limitations on the features it 
can render in the web browser. Some limitations exist because of security 
issues, whereas others exist simply because Microsoft hasn’t had time to 
evolve the Excel Web App to include the broad set of features that come with 
standard Excel.
In any case, the Excel Web App has some limitations:
	
✓	Data Validation doesn’t work on the web. This feature is simply ignored 
when you publish your workbook to the web.
	
✓	No form of VBA, including macros, will run in the Excel Web App. 
Your VBA procedures simply will not transfer with the workbook.
	
✓	Worksheet protection will not work on the web. Instead, you need 
to plan for and use the browser view options demonstrated earlier in 
Figure 14-23 and 14-24.
	
✓	Links to external workbooks will no longer work after publishing to 
the web.
	
✓	You can use any pivot tables with full fidelity on the web, but you 
cannot create any new pivot tables while your workbook is on the 
web. You need to create pivot tables in the Excel client on your PC 
before publishing to the web.

Ten Chart Design Principles
I

’m the first to admit, I’ve created my share of poorly designed charts — 
bar charts with every color known to man, line charts with ten or more 
lines slapped on top of each other, and pie charts with slices so thin they 
melded into a blob of black ink. When I look at these early disasters, I feel the 
shame of a baby boomer looking at pictures of himself in white ­bell-bottom 
jeans.
Excel makes charting so simple that it’s often tempting to accept the charts it 
creates no matter how bad the default colors or settings are. But I’m here to 
implore you to turn away from the glitzy lure of the default settings. You can 
easily avoid charting fiascos by following a few basic design principles.
In this chapter, I share a few of these principles and help you avoid some of 
the mistakes I’ve made in the past. (No thanks needed.)
Avoid Fancy Formatting
Excel makes it easy to apply effects that make everything look shiny, glittery, 
and oh-so-pretty. Now don’t get me wrong, these new graphics are more than 
okay for charts created for sales and marketing presentations. However, 
when it comes to dashboards, you definitely want to stay away from them.
Remember that a dashboard is a platform to present your case with data. Why 
dress up your data with superfluous formatting when the data itself is the 
thing you want to get across? It’s like making a speech in a Roman general’s 
uniform. How well will you get your point across when your audience is thinking, 
“What’s the deal with Tiberius?”
Take Figure 15-1, for instance. I created this chart (formatting and all) with 
just a few clicks. Excel makes it super easy to achieve these types of effects 
with its Layout and Style features. The problem is that these effects subdue 
the very data you’re trying to present. Furthermore, if you include this chart 
on a page with five to ten other charts with the same formatting, you get a 
blinding mess that’s difficult to look at, much less read.

298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Figure 15-1: 
Fancy 
formatting 
can be over-
whelming, 
subduing 
the very 
data you’re 
trying to 
present.	
The key to communicating effectively with your charts is to present your 
data as simply as possible. I promise you, your data is interesting on its own. 
There’s no need to wrap it in eye candy to make it more interesting.
Figure 15-2 shows the same data without the fancy formatting. I think you’ll 
find that the chart is not only easier to read, but you can also process the 
data more effectively.
	
Figure 15-2: 
Charts 
should pres-
ent your 
data as 
simply as 
possible.
	
Here are some simple tips to keep from overdoing the fancy factor:
	
✓	Don’t apply background colors to the Chart or Plot area. Colors in 
­general should be reserved for key data points in your chart.
	
✓	Don’t use 3D charts or 3D effects. No one’s going to give you an Oscar 
for special effects. Anything 3D doesn’t belong on a dashboard.

299
 Chapter 15: Ten Chart Design Principles
	
✓	Avoid applying fancy effects such as gradients, pattern fills, shadows, 
glow, soft edges, and other formatting. Again, the word of the day is 
focus, as in “focus on the data and not the shiny happy graphics.”
	
✓	Don’t try to enhance your charts with clip art or pictures. They do 
nothing to further data presentation and they often just look tacky.
Skip the Unnecessary Chart Junk
Data visualization pioneer Edward Tufte introduced the notion of data to 
ink ratio. Tufte’s basic idea is that a large percentage of the ink on your chart or 
dashboard should be dedicated to data. Very little ink should be used to 
present what he calls chart junk: borders, gridlines, trend lines, labels, back­
grounds, and so on.
Figure 15-3 illustrates the impact chart junk can have on your ability to 
­communicate your data. At first glance, the top chart in Figure 15-3 may look 
exaggerated in its ambition to show many chart elements at one time, but 
believe me, there are charts out there that look like this. Notice how convo­
luted and cramped the data looks.
	
Figure 15-3: 
Charts with 
too many 
chart ele-
ments can 
become 
convoluted 
and hard 
to read. 
Removing 
the unnec-
essary 
elements 
clarifies the 
message.
	
The bottom chart presents the same information as the top chart. However, 
the bottom chart more effectively presents the core message that driver 
­registrations in Texas rose from more than 10 million to almost 17 million 
(a message that was diluted in the top chart). You can see from this simple 
example how a chart can be dramatically improved by simply removing the 
elements that don’t directly contribute to the core message of the chart.

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Here are a few ways to avoid chart junk and ensure your charts clearly 
­present your data:
	
✓	Remove gridlines: Gridlines (both vertical and horizontal) are almost 
always unnecessary. The implied reason for gridlines is that they help 
to visually gauge the value represented by each data point. The truth is, 
however, you typically gauge the value of a data point by comparing its 
position to the other data points in the chart. So gridlines become sec­
ondary reference points that simply take up ink.
	
✓	Remove borders: You’ll find that eliminating borders and frames gives 
your charts a cleaner look and helps avoid the dizzying lines you get 
when placing many charts with borders on a single dashboard. Instead 
of borders, use the white space between the charts as implied borders.
	
✓	Skip the trend lines: Seldom does a trend line provide insight that can’t 
be gained with the already plotted data or a simple label. In fact, trend 
lines often state the obvious and sometimes confuse readers into thinking 
they’re another data series. Why place a trend line on a line chart when 
the line chart is itself a trend line of sorts? Why place a trend line on 
a bar chart when it’s just as easy to look at the top of the bars? In lieu 
of trend lines, add a simple label that states what you’re trying to say 
about the overall trend of the data.
	
✓	Avoid data label overload: Nothing says you need to show the data 
label for every value on your chart. It’s okay to plot a data point and 
not display its value. You’ll find that your charts have more impact 
when you show only numbers relevant to your message. For example, 
Figure 15-3 shows a trend that includes seven years of data. Although all 
the years are plotted to show the trend, only values of the first and last 
plotted years are shown. The first and last plotted years’ data is enough 
to fulfill the purpose of this chart, which is to show the trend and ultimate 
growth of driver registrations.
	
✓	Don’t show a legend if you don’t have to: When you’re plotting one 
data series, there’s no need to display a space-taking chart legend. If you 
allow your chart title to identify the one data series in your chart, you 
can simply delete the legend.
	
✓	Remove any axis that doesn’t provide value: The purpose of the x- and 
y-axes are to help a user visually gauge and position the values repre­
sented by each data point. However, if the nature and utility of the chart 
doesn’t require a particular axis, you should remove it. In Figure 15-3, 
there’s no real need for the y-axis because the two data points I’m trying 
to draw attention to are labeled already. Again, the goal here isn’t to 
hack away at your chart. The goal is to include only those chart elements 
that directly contribute to the core message of your chart.

301
 Chapter 15: Ten Chart Design Principles
Format Large Numbers Where Possible
It’s never fun to count the zeros in a large number, especially when you’re 
staring at 8-point font. When plotting very large numbers on a chart, consider 
formatting the values so that they’re truncated for easy reading.
For instance, in Figure 15-4, I’ve formatted the values to appear as 10M and 
17M instead of the hard-to-read 10,475,000 and 16,906,714.
	
Figure 15-4: 
Formatting 
large 
­numbers to 
millions or 
thousands 
makes for 
a clearer 
chart.
	
You can easily format large numbers in Excel by using the Format Cells dialog 
box. Here you can specify a custom number format by selecting Custom in 
the Category list and entering the desired number format code in the Type 
input box. In Figure 15-5, the code 0,, “M” ensures the numbers are format­
ted to millions with an M appendage.
	
Figure 15-5: 
Select 
Custom 
in the 
Category list 
and enter 
a number 
format code 
in the Type 
input box.
	

302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
To get to the Format Cells dialog box, highlight the numbers you’re formatting, 
right-click, and then choose Format Cells.
It’s generally good practice to format the source data that feeds your chart as 
opposed to the data labels on your chart. This way, your formatting persists 
even as you add and remove data labels.
	
In Chapter 3, you find a table that lists some common format codes and how 
they can affect your numbers.
Use Data Tables instead of Data Labels
There may be situations in which it’s valuable to show all the data values 
along with the plotted data points. However, you’ve already seen how data 
labels can inundate your users with chart junk.
Instead of using data labels, you can attach a data table to your Excel chart. 
A data table allows you to see the data values for each plotted data point, 
beneath the chart. Figure 15-6 illustrates a data table, showing the data 
values for two series. As you can see, a lot of information is shown here 
­without overcrowding the chart itself.
	
Figure 15-6: 
Data tables 
enable you 
to show 
data values 
without 
overloading 
your chart 
with data 
labels.
	
Although data tables increase the space your charts take up on your dash­
board, they respond well to formatting and can be made to meld nicely into 
your charts. Data tables come in particularly handy if your clients are con­
stantly asking to see the detailed information behind your charts.

2.	Click the Data Table icon and select Show Data Table with Legend 
Keys, as demonstrated in Figure 15-7.
	
Figure 15-7:

data table to 
a chart.
	
	
3.	Right-click your newly added data table and choose Format 
Data Table.
	
	 The Format Data Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-8.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Make Effective Use of Chart Titles
Chart titles don’t have to be limited to simple labeling and naming duties. You 
can use chart titles to add an extra layer of information, presenting analysis 
derived from the data presented in the chart. Figure 15-9 demonstrates this.
	
Figure 15-9: 
Use chart 
titles to 
present an 
extra layer 
of data 
without 
taking up 
extra space 
on your 
dashboard.
	
Sort Your Data before Charting
Unless there’s an obvious natural order, such as age or time, it’s ­generally 
good practice to sort your data when charting. By sorting, I mean sort the 
source data that feeds your chart in ascending or descending order by 
data value.
As you can see in Figure 15-10, building a chart using a dataset sorted by 
values enhances its readability and somehow gives the chart a professional 
look and feel.

Using 
sorted data

readability 
and clarity.

 Chapter 15: Ten Chart Design Principles
Limit the Use of Pie Charts
Although pie charts have long been considered a viable charting option for 
business reporting, they often aren’t well suited for dashboard reporting. 
There are several reasons for this.
First, they typically take up more space than their cousins, the line and bar 
charts. Sure, you can make them small, but pixel for pixel, you get a lot less 
bang for your data-visualization buck with a pie chart.
Second, pie charts can’t clearly represent more than two or three data 
­categories. Figure 15-11 demonstrates this fact.
	
Figure 15-11: 
Pie charts 
can’t clearly 
represent 
more than 
two or 
three data 
categories.
	
The pie chart on the left does a good job visually representing two data cat­
egories. You can easily distinguish the two categories and clearly get a sense 
of distribution for each category. The pie chart on the right is a different 
story. As you can see, when you go past two or three categories, a pie chart 
isn’t as effective in relaying the proper sense of percent distribution. The 
slices are too similar in size and shape to visually compare the categories. 
Plus, the legend and data categories are disconnected, causing your eyes 
to jump back and forth from pie to legend (even in color the legend doesn’t 
help). Sure, you could add category labels, but that would cause the chart to 
take up more real estate without adding much value.
So what’s the alternative? Instead of a pie chart, consider using a bar chart. 
With a bar chart, you can clearly represent the distribution percentages for 
many categories without taking up extra real estate. In Figure 15-12, you can 
see the dramatic improvement in clarity you can achieve by using bar charts.

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Figure 15-12: 
Bar charts 
are an 
alternative 
to pie charts 
when you 
have more 
than two or 
three data 
categories.
Don’t Be Afraid to Parse Data 
into Separate Charts
Be aware that a single chart can lose its effectiveness if you try to plot too 
much data into it. Take Figure 15-13, for example.
Figure 15-13: 
Sometimes 
you work 
with so 
much data 
that your 
charts no 
longer make 
sense.
This chart has a couple of problems. First, the data is split into nine age 
groups, which forces you to use nine lines. When you start plotting more than 
three lines on a line chart, your chart begins to look jumbled. Second, the age 
groups have a wide range of data values. This causes the chart’s y-axis scale 
to be so spread out that each line essentially looks like a straight line.

307
 Chapter 15: Ten Chart Design Principles
In situations like this, step back and try to boil down what exactly the chart 
needs to do. What is the ultimate purpose of the chart? In this case, the ulti­
mate purpose of this chart is to show the growth or decline of the workforce 
numbers for each age group. Now, you obviously can’t show every data point 
on the same chart, so you have to show each age group in its own chart. So 
you want to make sure that you can see each age group alongside the other 
for comparison purposes.
Figure 15-14 shows just one of many solutions for this particular example.
Figure 15-14: 
Creating 
separate, 
individual 
charts is 
often better 
than one 
convoluted 
chart.
Here, I’ve created a separate area chart for each age group and then lined 
them up side by side. Each chart individually shows a general trend from 
2005 to 2010. Because they’re placed together, you can get an idea of the mag­
nitude of each age group. Also, notice that I merged the last three age groups 
into one category called 65 & Up. This groups the three smallest categories 
into one that’s worthy of plotting. Finally, I used data labels to quickly show 
the growth or decline percentage from 2005 to 2010 for each group.
Again, this isn’t the only solution to this problem, but it does do the job of 
displaying the analysis I chose to present.
It’s not always easy to know exactly how to display your data in a 
chart — especially when the data is multilayered and complex. Instead of 
jamming the world into one chart, step back and think about how to show 
the data separately, but together.
Maintain Appropriate Aspect Ratios
In terms of charts, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height to width. That is to 
say, charts should maintain an appropriate height-to-width ratio in order for 
the integrity of the chart to remain intact. Take a look at Figure 15-15 to see 
what I mean.

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Figure 15-15: 
A skewed 
aspect ratio 
can distort 
your charts.
	
The chart at the top of Figure 15-15 is at an appropriate aspect ratio that 
­correctly renders the chart. The bottom two charts display the same data, 
but the aspect ratios of these charts are skewed. The middle chart is too tall 
and the bottom chart is too wide. This essentially distorts the visual repre­
sentation, exaggerating the trend in the chart that’s too tall, and flattening 
the trend in the chart that’s too wide.
I’ve seen lots of people contort their charts just to fit them into the empty 
space on their dashboards. If you want to avoid distorting your charts, you 
must keep them at an appropriate aspect ratio. What is that ratio?
Generally, the most appropriate aspect ratio for a chart is one in which the 
width of the chart is about twice as long as the height. For example, 1” tall 
by 2” wide is an appropriate ratio. 1.5” tall by 3” wide is also appropriate. The 
actual height and width isn’t important. You can make your charts as small or 
as big as they need to be. What is important is the ratio of height to width.
Don’t Be Afraid to Use Something 
Other Than a Chart
Ask yourself if a simple table will present the data just fine. If the data you’re 
reporting can be more effectively shared in a table, then that’s how it should 
be presented. Remember, the goal of a dashboard is not to present every­
thing in a chart. The goal of a dashboard is to present key data in the most 
effective way possible.

Chapter 16
Ten Questions to Ask Before 
Distributing Your Dashboard
Y

ou started this book with two chapters that discuss the design and data 
modeling principles that make up what could be considered dashboard­
ing’s best practices. Before you send out your finished product, it’s valuable 
to check your reporting mechanism against some of these principles. Use the 
ten questions in this chapter as a checklist to ensure your dashboard follows 
the best practices covered in this book.
Does My Dashboard Present 
the Right Information?
Look at the information you’re presenting and determine if it meets the 
purpose of the dashboard you identified during the requirements-gathering 
stage. Don’t be timid about clarifying the purpose of the dashboard with the 
core users. Avoid building the dashboard in a vacuum. Allow a few test users 
to see iterations as you develop. This way, communication stays open, and 
you won’t go too far in the wrong direction.
Does Everything on My Dashboard 
Have a Purpose?
Take an honest look at how much of the information on your dashboard 
doesn’t support its main purpose. Keep your dashboard as valuable as 
­possible; you don’t want to dilute it with nice-to-know data that’s interesting, 

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
but not actionable. Remember, if the data doesn’t support the core purpose 
of the dashboard, leave it out. Nothing says you have to fill every bit of white 
space on the page.
Does My Dashboard Prominently 
Display the Key Message?
Every dashboard has one or more key messages. You want to ensure that 
these messages are prominently displayed. To test if the key messages in a 
dashboard are prominent, stand back and squint your eyes while you look 
at the dashboard. Look away and then look back at the dashboard several 
times. What jumps out at you first? If it’s not the key components you want 
displayed, you have to change something. Here are a few actions you can 
take to ensure your key components have prominence:
	
✓	Place the key components of your dashboard in the upper-left or middle-
left portion of the page. Studies have shown that these areas attract the 
most attention for longer periods of time.
	
✓	De-emphasize borders, backgrounds, and other elements that define 
dashboard areas. Try to use the natural white space between your com­
ponents to partition your dashboard. If borders are necessary, format 
them to a hue lighter than the one you’ve used for your data.
	
✓	Format labels and other text to hues lighter than the ones you’ve 
used for your data. Lightly colored labels give your users the infor­
mation they need without distracting them from the information 
displayed.
Can I Maintain This Dashboard?
There’s a big difference between refreshing a dashboard and rebuilding a 
dashboard. Before you excitedly send out the sweet-looking dashboard you 
just built, take a moment to think about the maintenance of such a dash­
board. You want to think about the frequency of updates, how often data 
needs to be refreshed, and what processes you need to go through each time 
you refresh the data. If it’s a one-time reporting event, set that ­expectation 
with your users. If you know it’ll become a recurring report, you want to 
really negotiate development time, refresh intervals, and phasing before 
agreeing to any time table.

311
 Chapter 16: Ten Questions to Ask Before Distributing Your Dashboard
Does My Dashboard Clearly Display 
Its Scope and Shelf Life?
A dashboard should clearly specify its scope and shelf life. That is to say, 
anyone should be able to look at your dashboard and know the relevant time 
period and the scope of the information on the dashboard. This comes down to 
a few simple things you can do to effectively label your dashboards and reports:
	
✓	Always include a timestamp on your reporting mechanisms. This 
minimizes confusion when distributing the same dashboard or report at 
regular intervals.
	
✓	Always include some text indicating when the data for the ­measures was 
retrieved. In many cases, timing of data is a critical piece of ­information 
when analyzing a measure.
	
✓	Use descriptive titles for each component on your dashboard. Be sure 
to avoid cryptic titles with lots of acronyms and symbols.
Is My Dashboard Well Documented?
It’s important to document your dashboard and the data model behind it. 
Anyone who has ever inherited an Excel spreadsheet knows how difficult it can 
be to translate the various analytical gyrations that go into a report. If you’re 
lucky, the data model will be small enough to piece together in a week or so. If 
you’re not so lucky, you’ll have to ditch the entire model and start from scratch.
	
By the way, the Excel model doesn’t even have to be someone else’s to be dif­
ficult to read. I’ve actually gone back to a model that I built, and after six or so 
months, I’d forgotten what I had done. Without documentation, it took me a 
few days to remember and decipher my own work.
The documentation doesn’t even have to be highfalutin’ fancy stuff. A few 
simple things can help in documenting your dashboard:
	
✓	Add a model map tab to your data model. The model map tab is a sep­
arate sheet you can use to summarize the key ranges in the data model, 
and how each range interacts with the reporting components in the final 
presentation layer.
	
✓	Use comments and labels liberally. It’s amazing how a few explanatory 
comments and labels can help clarify your model even after you’ve been 
away from your data model for a long time.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Consider using colors to identify the ranges in your data model. 
Using colors in your data model enables you to quickly look at a range 
of cells and get a basic indication of what that range does. Each color 
can ­represent a range type. For example, yellow could represent ­staging 
tables, gray could represent formulas, and purple could represent 
­reference tables.
Is My Dashboard Overwhelmed 
with Formatting and Graphics?
When it comes to formatting dashboards and reports, less is more. Eye candy 
doesn’t make your data more interesting. If you’re not convinced, try creating 
a version of your dashboard without the fancy formatting:
	
✓	Remove distracting colors and background fills. If you must have 
colors in charts, use colors commonly found in nature: soft grays, 
browns, blues, and greens.
	
✓	De-emphasize borders by formatting them to hues lighter than the ones 
you’ve used for your data. Light grays are typically ideal for ­borders. 
The idea is to indicate sections without distracting from the information 
displayed.
	
✓	Remove all fancy graphical effects such as gradients, pattern fills, 
shadows, glows, soft edges, and other formatting.
	
✓	Remove the clip art and other pictures.
I think that when you compare the two versions, you’ll find that the toned-
down version does a better job of highlighting the actual data.
Does My Dashboard Overuse Charts 
When Tables Will Do?
Just because you’re building a dashboard doesn’t mean everything on it has 
to be a chart. In some analyses, a simple table will present the data just fine. 
You typically use a chart when there’s some benefit to visually seeing trends, 
relationships, or comparisons. Ask yourself if there’s a benefit to seeing your 
data in chart form. If the data is relayed better in a table, that’s how it should 
be presented.

313
 Chapter 16: Ten Questions to Ask Before Distributing Your Dashboard
Figure 16-1 illustrates a simple example. The chart on the left and the table on the 
right show the exact same data. The table does a fine job at presenting the key 
message of the analysis — revenue is at 95 percent of plan. Why use the chart 
that requires more real estate, not to mention more work and maintenance?
	
Figure 16-1: 
Don’t use 
charts for 
charting’s 
sake.
	
Is My Dashboard User-Friendly?
Before you distribute your reporting mechanism, you want to ensure that it’s 
user-friendly. It’s not difficult to guess what user-friendly means. Usually a 
user-friendly mechanism has the following characteristics:
	
✓	Intuitive: Your reporting mechanism should be intuitive to someone 
who has never seen it before. Test your dashboard on someone and ask 
her if it makes sense. If you have to start explaining what the dashboard 
says, something is wrong. Does the dashboard need more labels, fewer 
complicated charts, a better layout, or more data? It’s a good idea to get 
feedback from several users.
	
✓	Easy to navigate: If your dashboard is dynamic, allowing for interactivity 
with macros or pivot tables, you should make sure the navigation works 
well. Does the user have to click several places to get to her data? Is the 
number of drill-downs appropriate? Does it take too long to switch from 
one view to another? Again, you want to test your dashboard on several 
users. Be sure to test any interactive dashboard on several computers 
other than yours.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Prints properly: Nothing is more annoying than printing a report only 
to find that the person who created the report didn’t take the time to 
ensure it prints correctly. Be sure you set the print options on your 
Excel files so that your dashboards print properly.
Is My Dashboard Accurate?
Nothing kills a dashboard or report faster than the perception that its data is 
inaccurate. It’s not within my abilities to tell you how to determine if your data 
is accurate. I can, however, highlight three factors that establish the ­perception 
of an accurate dashboard:
	
✓	Consistency with authoritative sources: It’s obvious that if your data 
doesn’t match other reporting sources, you have a data credibility issue, 
especially if those other sources are deemed to be the ­authoritative 
sources. Be sure you’re aware of the data sources considered to be 
gospel in your organization. If your dashboard contains data associated 
with an authoritative source, compare your data with that source to 
ensure consistency.
	
✓	Internal consistency: It’s never fun to explain why one part of your 
dashboard doesn’t jive with other parts of the same dashboard. You 
should ensure some level of internal consistency within your dashboard. 
Be sure comparable components in different areas of your dashboard 
are consistent with each other. If there’s a reason for inconsistency, 
be sure to clearly notate those reasons. It’s amazing how well a simple 
­notation can clear up questions about the data.
	
✓	Personal experience: Have you ever seen someone look at a report and 
say, “That doesn’t look right?” She’s using what some people call “gut 
feel” to evaluate the soundness of the data. None of us looks at numbers 
in a vacuum. When you look at any analysis, you bring with you years of 
personal knowledge, interaction, and experience. You ­subconsciously 
use these experiences in your evaluation of information. When 
­determining the accuracy of your dashboard, take into consideration 
­organizational ­anecdotal knowledge. If possible, show your dashboard to 
a few ­subject-matter experts in your company.
