Introduction 
HoME TIIEATER HAS become an increasingly popular entertainment venue for people 
all over the world. The last decade has seen giant leaps in the technologies available 
(and affordable) to the consumer at large. The recent DVD explosion has opened 
the public's eyes to the vast potential of very high-quality video and sound, and 
many people are jumping on this bandwagon. 
As with all new technologies, components are expensive and consumers 
require a great deal of knowledge and research to make the proper choices. One 
area that is just now becoming a feasible option is that of using a computer to 
create a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective home theater system that is by its 
very nature adaptable to future technologies. The idea of using a home theater PC 
(HTPC) to manage an audiovisual entertainment system is not just a fringe idea 
for techno-geeks; there are genuine reasons for setting up a system like this in 
many homes. 
What This Book Covers 
In this book, we show how you can use a home computer to maximize the quality of 
video through processing incoming video signals (from DVD, broadcast television, 
HDT\T, home video, satellite, and cable) and outputting them to your television at 
the highest quality the television can accept. Video, however, is only part of the 
experience, and using your computer's sound card (and/ or sound system) gives 
you the best quality sound available for the money. We also discuss how to use your 
HTPC to play MP4 material and home video material such as home movies or slide 
shows in ultra-high resolution on a high-definition television (or any television). 
Finally, there has been a recent wave of interest in technologies such as TiVo, 
ReplayT\T, and illtimaterv: We show you how to tum your HTPC into a homegrown, 
TiVo-like personal video recorder unit with unlimited expansion possibilities. 
This book will show you how to select components and build an HTPC. We 
examine all of the various uses for an HTPC, including showing digital pictures on 
your television, improving your sound system, and using your HTPC as a jukebox 
for your MP3 collection. If you're interested in taking full advantage of your HTPC, 
we cover everything you need to know to get the ultimate home theater system 
up and running in your home with minimal fuss. Throughout the book, we use 
two HTPC examples (our own personal machines), HTPC 1 and HTPC 2, which 
we configure in different ways with different hardware and software. We use 

Introduction 
xviii 
these two machines as our real-world examples as we explore various software 
and hardware options as they pertain to the their intended tasks (DVD playback, 
MP3 decoding, and so forth). The HTPC can take the home theater experience to 
the next level, and this book will help you take it there! 
Who This Book Is For 
This book is for those folks who are home theater enthusiasts and have some 
working knowledge of personal computers. This book will help these people create 
a new animal on the home theater landscape: the home theater PC (HTPC). You 
don't have to be an expert on hardware, and you certainly don't have to know how 
to program, but you will have to be able to spare a dozen evenings or so fiddling 
around with various software settings and such to get things running just the way 
you want. 
The HTPC offers so very much in the way of improving the home theater 
experience that it's a viable option for anyone but the most technically challenged 
soul. If you like things to work 100 percent right out of the box with no fiddling, 
then an HTPC probably isn't for you (at least, not one you build yourself); 
however, if you like to tinker a little and spend a fair amount of time on your PC 
anyway, then you likely have what it takes to create your ultimate home theater 
system with the help of an HTPC.

Basics 

CHAPTER 1 
Video 
THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS basic background information about each of the key 
elements of a home theater. Without a doubt, you'll need to know where each 
technology originated from and how it has evolved to get the point where you can 
create a truly enjoyable home theater experience without having tore-mortgage 
your house to do it. 
The genesis of home theater can be traced back not just to television and 
radio, but all the way back to the late nineteenth century when George Eastman 
introduced celluloid rolls of film for capturing moving images to create the first 
"movies." While we don't go all the way back to the earliest inklings of moving 
pictures and the inclusion of sound in movies, we give you a brief history of the 
key elements in any contemporary home theater system in this chapter. Here are 
the topics we cover: 
â¢ Television: What once was a novelty for the rich has become the staple 
information-delivery system for the industrialized world. We look at where 
television came from and how its origins have limited the quality of the 
images we see on it. We also look into the future to see what the next gener-
ation of television will be. 
â¢ VHS and Betamax: Since its victory over the commercial versions of 
Betamax format (Betamax is still widely used in pre- and post-production 
TV) in the mid-1980s, VHS has reigned supreme as the movie delivery 
and home taping system of choice for many years. With the advent and 
proliferation of DVD, however, the writing may be on the wall for this 
tried-and-true format. 
â¢ DVD: Starting as a collaborative effort between Sony and Philips as a way to 
get CD-quality digital information into a movie format, DVD has taken the 
world by storm and is well on its way to replacing videotape recorders such 
as VHS machines. 
â¢ Laserdisc and Video CD: Both of these formats have remained on the 
fringes, but it can be argued that Laserdisc is responsible for the success of 
DVD because it blazed the trail that showed a digital-quality movie medium 
could be successful.

â¢ Home video and video editing: Home video recording is now over 20 years 
old, and all those tapes of children's first steps and family get-togethers in 
the heat of the summer are ready to be edited and turned into productions 
that can be enjoyed right at home in the new home theater PC (HTPC) 
home theater. The HTPC is just the tool to edit this material and turn it into 
a digital format where it can't degrade. 
Television 
The electronic television began as an experiment in 1908 by British inventor 
A. A. Campbell-Swinton. Eventually; the technology became the staple inform-
ation delivery system for nearly the entire world. In fact, in North America there is 
nearly one television for every person, which translates into multiple televisions 
for every household. Television's capability to quickly dispense important infor-
mation, from national crises to weather reports to financial information, has made 
it an indispensable tool that most societies around the world have embraced 
wholeheartedly. Not only would life without television of any kind cut off most 
people's main contact with the world outside of their communities, but it would 
also remove other key information-delivery systems, such as the television moni-
tors in airports that tell you if your flight is on time. 
A Little Television History 
While the basic principles on which television would ultimately be created were 
discovered in the 1870s, the first practical uses of television didn't begin until the 
1920s when a Scotsman by the name ofJohn Logie Baird was able to give the first 
functional demonstration of electronic television where images were transmitted 
electronically onto a screen. Although these early demonstrations showed only 
crude, flickering images, this research was enough to inspire others to pick up the 
torch and work on improving on the concept. 
By November 1936, the first public broadcasting of television programs began 
in London. These early broadcasts were sent out in two competing formats: the 
Baird system of 240 lines at 25 frames per second and the Marconi system of 405 
lines at 25 frames per second. These early British broadcasts were of events such 
as the Wimbledon tennis championships and the marriage of King George N. The 
crown for the first public broadcast, however, goes to the Germans, who put the 
1936 Summer Olympic Games on the tube, complete with the tyrant Adolph Hitler 
standing on a podium giving a speech to open the proceedings. 

In 1939, the European community adopted the broadcasting standard of 625 
lines and 50 frames per second. TWo years later, the United States set their stan-
dard at 525 lines and 60 frames per second, and thus the era of modern television 
was born. While there were no public broadcasts during World War 11-indeed, 
there were only 400 television sets in the United States in 1941-the broadcasts 
resumed in 1946 and have been going strong ever since. To give you an idea of the 
explosion of television in the United States, by 1951 there were over 13 million 
television sets in operation. I 
Also in 1951, the Peter Goldmark color system televisions were introduced, 
but these sets were not backward compatible with existing 525line black-and-
white broadcasts, and since very little content was being broadcast in color, this 
system was doomed to failure. The color/black-and-white conundrum was ironed 
out in 1953 when the United States and Canada adopted the National Television 
Systems Committee (NTSC) standard for both black-and-white and color broad-
casts that is still enjoyed today. In other parts of the world, different systems were 
developed, specifically the phase alternation line (PAL) and systeme electronique 
couleur avec memoire (SECAM) formats. 
In 1954, all stations began broadcasting a portion of their content in color 
using the NTSC standard, but it took until1965 for the National Broadcasting 
Company (NBC) to have their entire lineup broadcast in color (and even then 
there were a couple of exceptions). By 197 4, over 95 percent of all households in 
the United States were equipped with television sets,z and as the cost of owning 
a television set has fallen, the number of Americans buying televisions has 
continued to rise through to the present day. In fact, by 1990 there nearly 1,500 
stations were broadcasting television signals in the United States alone.3

The Evolution of the Television 
As you can imagine, the television has evolved a great deal over the last 75 years 
or so. The evolution and development of televisions and their features could be a 
book unto itself, so we do not try to cover this fascinating topic. If you are inter-
ested in the history of the television, we suggest that you check out Tom Genova's 
Web site, "Television History- The First 75 Years" (http:/ /wvtv~. tvhistory. tv). 
This Web site is an excellent resource and contains many pictures of antique 
television sets such as Torn's very own 1939 RCA TRK-12 
(see Figure 1-1). 
1939 General Electric HM-275 
(c) TVhistory. TV Library 
Figure 1-1. Tom Genova's Web site, ''Television History- The First 75 Years," 
includes some great pictures of vintage televisions. 

That said, we would like to mention a few key milestones in the development of 
the television. The following milestones are just too significant not to mention in 
the context of the history of television and its development: 
â¢ Color television: This advance changed television from something that 
approximated the way we see the world into something that looked like the 
way we actually see the world. To many of us, color is a very important aspect 
of what we see, and the addition of color to televisions took the medium to 
new heights. 
â¢ The remote control: The remote control is significant in that it changed the 
way television was watched forever. Instead of having to get up and change 
the channel manually, users could now simply press a button on a small 
device from wherever they were sitting to change the channel. 
â¢ Transistor television: Roughly around 1972, the traditional vacuum-tube 
circuitry of the television was replaced by the solid-state technology of the 
transistor. This enabled televisions to be smaller, lighter, and more reliable. 
â¢ High-definition television: The latest and greatest in television's evolution is 
the development of high-definition television (HDTV). HDTVincreases the 
amount of information that can be displayed on the screen many times, thus 
creating a much sharper picture. 
Of course, the milestones in the preceding list are only the major stepping-
stones in the evolution of television. According to Tom Genova, "Along the 
way there have been hundreds of minor circuit design changes, improvements, 
and enhancements. These enhancements include brighter picture tubes, better 
signal control, easier computerized tuning, multilanguage capabilities, closed 
captioning, onscreen station identification, visual menus, timers, auto shut-off, 
built-in game modules, and even compatibility with computers, telephones, and 
the Internet." 
Television Signal Delivery 
For many years, the way in which consumers received the signal into their televi-
sions was via television stations that broadcast signals from television towers that 
basically could deliver the "product" to any television set with an antenna within 
the line of sight of the station. In today's market, however, television users have a 
number of choices that enable them to tailor both what they watch and the quality 
of the signal they receive.

Radio Frequency Television Signal 
Up until the advent of cable television delivery in the 1960s, most houses had 
what are called "rabbit ear" antennas on top of the television. These antennas 
could be adjusted to get the best picture possible for each channel; unfortunately, 
sometimes there would need to be adjustments made for each channel! Some 
enterprising folks got around this by having larger aerials on top of their houses 
to improve television reception, but these aerials didn't necessarily solve all of the 
problems associated with television reception. Surprisingly, this method of 
watching television is still used a great deal, especially in rural areas. 
Cable 
Eventually, there were enough problems with television signal reception that 
coaxial cable technology was developed to carry the television signals in a manner 
that wouldn't be affected by weather or physical obstructions. By the 1960s, local 
cable companies were supplying television signals to residents in urban areas 
where tall buildings were making reception degrade. This idea quickly caught on 
and by the mid-1970s there were many cable systems offering more channels than 
had previously been available to the average television user. Indeed, cable televi-
sion is the de facto standard in North America and is used in more televisions than 
any other means of signal delivery. 
In the last few years, a new kind of cable, digital cable, has crept into the 
marketplace and is becoming quite popular in some areas. Digital cable increases 
the number of possible channels that coaxial cable can carry, and in some areas of 
North America, as many as six channels are already being broadcast in HDTV all 
the time. This is currently greater than the number of HDTV channels available by 
digital satellite dish, so it will be interesting to see if digital cable surpasses digital 
satellite dish in the future. 
NOTE Although we discuss TWo further in the "Direct Satellite" section, we'd 
like to state now that TiVo can be used with regular cable systems as well as 
satellite systems-it just doesn't integrate as smoothly. That said, services 
such as TiVo can be integrated very well with digital cable. 

Satellite 
In 1965, the Early Bird satellite was launched to enable broadcasts of television 
signals between Europe and the United States. Older readers will remember that 
the Beatles sang "All You Need Is Love" on the program that commemorated the 
first transatlantic broadcast. With the proliferation of satellite signal delivery over 
the next few decades, some users began to set up their own (rather large) satellite 
dishes (see Figure 1-2) that could capture all ofthe signals coming off of any one 
television satellite and pipe them right into their home. This means of delivery has 
several drawbacks, including a very large dish, a high initial cost, and a compli-
cated process for finding the programs you want to watch because there are now 
many satellites and the dish must be moved between satellites to receive all the 
stations available. Large-dish satellite systems are still available today, but they are 
less popular than the other satellite delivery system, direct satellite.

Direct Broadcast Satellite 
The latest craze that has taken North America by storm is direct broadcast satellite 
(DBS). Launched in 1994, these small, pizza-sized dishes (see Figure 1-3) are able 
to receive over 200 channels of digitally compressed information that produces 
exceptional quality and convenience for users. Because DBS is computer based, it 
has a system of onscreen menus and provides newer technologies such as TiVo 
and ReplayTV that allow users to automatically (and easily) record whatever 
content they want from a selection of 200 channels. The upside to DBS systems is 
that they are relatively cheap, the dishes are small and unobtrusive compared to 
standard satellite systems, and the vast array of channels is organized neatly 
through the use of a computerized menu system. As of 2001, it was estimated that 
over 15 million homes in North America had DBS systems installed (according to 
Encyclopedia Britannica). 
How Televisions Work 
While our mandate is not to go into excessive detail about how the various elec-
tronic devices we discuss work, we feel that in the context of the home theater and 
the choices you as the consumer have, it is worthwhile to cover the basics of how 
the various kinds of televisions bring the picture to your eyes. 
Figure 1-3. DBS (or DSS) services such as DIREC1V offer digital quality and a 
small, convenient dish, although in Northern Canada, larger DBS dishes are 
needed (18 inches or 21 inches) to get acceptable reception. 

Picture Tube Televisions 
Picture tube televisions make up the vast majority of televisions in use today. 
To day's picture tube televisions are descended from the original televisions that 
were used in the 1920s and 1930s. There are several reasons why this kind of televi-
sion has remained popular: 
â¢ The prices of picture tube televisions have consistently fallen. 
â¢ The picture tube has a bright, clear image and can be watched from almost 
any angle without loss of brightness. 
â¢ The cost of tube-based televisions is significantly lower than projection, 
rear-projection, and flat -screen plasma televisions. That said, some rear-
projection televisions are cheaper than high-end tube-based systems such 
as Sony's WEGA. 
â¢ With picture tubes, the color is more accurate than with flat panel televi-
sions, and the convergence and geometry problems common to projection 
televisions are not an issue. 
Picture tubes follow a basic design that hasn't changed a great deal in the last 
50 years (since color television came online). The television consists of several key 
components: the power supply, the tuner, the picture tube, and the electron gun 
(which sits in the back of the picture tube). The tuner receives the video signals 
and sends them to the electron gun in the back of the television. Color televisions 
have three electron guns, one for each primary color (red, blue, and green). The 
images from the video signals are beamed (in an electron beam) onto the back of 
the picture tube, or in other words, the opposite side of the viewing surface of the 
television. The inside of the viewing surface of the television is coated with phos-
phorus, which glows when bombarded with electrons from the electron guns. 
In a standard NTSC television, the electron guns "paint" the image onto the phos-
phorus screen in 525lines at a rate of 60 times a second. This constant painting of 
the video signal on the phosphorus screen creates the images that we recognize as 
television. Of course, this is a simplified explanation, but it shows the basic 
mechanics of how a picture tube television works.

Chapter 1 
12 
NOTE In color televisions there is another component that enables the 
colors to be sorted out and displayed on the screen. This component is 
called a shadow mask. In short, the shadow mask is a nontransparent 
layer of material that has small holes in it. These holes are designed to 
ensure that electron beams of one color do not hit the phosphorus dots 
that are being hit with another color. Colors other than red, green, or blue 
(colors that are displayed from the electron guns) are created by having 
primary color dots displayed very close together. When this happens, your 
eyes and your brain combine the information to create other colors. 
Projection Televisions 
Another method of video delivery is through projection. There are two types of 
projection televisions: front projection and rear projection (see Figure 1-4). The 
most common of these is by far the rear-projection television, which you can see 
at any audio/video store with large televisions on display. Projection televisions 
actually date back all the way to the mid-1940s (the RCA 8PCS41 projection televi-
sion is a prime early example), but for practical purposes the first projection 
televisions arrived on the scene in the 1970s and allowed for much laiger screens 
than the tried-and-true picture tube television sets. 
Rear Projection 
Generally speaking, conventional picture tube televisions do not exceed 36 inches 
diagonally (although Sony recently released a 40-inch diagonal tube-based televi-
sion), so in order to get larger screens into a home theater, you must move to the 
realm of projection televisions. Rear-projection television screens get as large as 
70 inches diagonally, which makes their size limits considerably greater than tube-
based televisions. As a rule, rear-projection televisions are also somewhat cheaper 
than large tube-based televisions, especially when HDTV comes into play. With all 
these positive comments about rear-projection televisions, you may be asking 
yourself why everyone doesn't jump on the rear-projection bandwagon and do 
away with their tube-based televisions. The limitations of rear-projection televi-
sion are as follows: 
â¢ There's a "sweet spot" on projection televisions where the screen looks 
fantastic, but if you're not sitting in the exact position to view the sweet 
spot, the quality and brightness of the image isn't as good. 
â¢ Viewing a rear-projection television from the side often means that it is 
difficult to properly see at least a portion of the screen. 

â¢ When a roomful of people is watching a rear-projection television, each 
person is seeing a different level of quality of image depending on where he 
or she is sitting or standing. 
â¢ Brightness suffers with rear-projection televisions, relegating them to 
darkened rooms where little natural light can enter. 
Figure 1-4. This is a 50-inch rear-projection HDTV-ready set in action.

NOTE The new Digital Light Processing (DLP) projection systems in rear-
projection and front-projection systems don't suffer from many of the 
effects described in the preceding list. Still, DLP systems are significantly 
more expensive right now, making them less likely to be an alternative for 
the average buyer. 
This is where people get divided into camps; some people absolutely love 
rear projection, and others can't stand it and prefer tube-based televisions. Your 
authors are also split on this point, with Jeff using a Toshiba 50-inch rear-projection 
HDTV television and Bart using a Sony WEGA 32-inch tube-based flat -screen HDTV 
television. In short, it's purely a matter of opinion as to which you will prefer, and 
we suggest going to your local electronics store to compare tube-based and rear-
projection televisions to see which you like best. 
Front Projection 
The other type of projection television is one that requires an entire room to be 
effective-that is to say, the pieces are spread out across an entire room. Generally 
speaking, the projector is at one end of the room and the screen is at the other. 
The projection units can be on the floor in front of the screen, or high on a table 
in the back of the room, or even suspended from the roof at the back or middle of 
the home theater room. The advantage of front-projection televisions is that they 
produce a picture that's not unlike that of a real theater. The sweet spot issues that 
can plague rear-projection systems are almost nonexistent in front-projection 
systems, but these systems can be extremely expensive when compared to rear-
projection or tube-based televisions. Still, the costs of front-projection systems are 
decreasing constantly, and if you're willing to buy a used unit, it's not inconceiv-
able to purchase a complete system for about the same price as a new 
rear-projection television. 
Flat Panel Televisions 
The last decade has seen huge advances in technology in flat panel monitor 
technology. Initially used for laptop computer screens (see Figure 1-5), flat 
panel technology has made the leap into the realm of television, and with high-
definition broadcasts just around the corner (and in existence in many areas 
already), these televisions are poised to become the standard by which all others 
are judged. 

Figure 1-5. This 15-inch flat-screen computer monitor from Apple can also work as 
a high-resolution television. 
Flat panel technology is basically a very advanced version of the liquid crystal 
display (LCD, the primary display in most digital watches). The advantages of flat 
panel television are both obvious and not-so-obvious: 
â¢ Flat panel televisions are very thin, and as a result they're much lighter than 
both projection and tube-based televisions. 
â¢ Color reproduction is more accurate in flat panel televisions, with whites 
looking whiter and so on. 
â¢ Flat panel televisions are physically more robust than their contemporaries. 
Not having electron guns and cumbersome projection systems means that 
they can take a bump or two without needing to be adjusted. They are also 
immune to damage from magnets, which is always a fear with tube-based 
televisions. 
Video

Chapter 1 
16 
â¢ Even huge flat panel televisions with 50-inch viewable areas can be hung on 
the wall, saving a great deal of space. 
â¢ Flat panel televisions use considerably less power than conventional televi-
sions. 
Of course, there are also some drawbacks to flat panel televisions: 
â¢ There can be dead zones that don't display the same as other areas on the 
panel. 
â¢ Dead pixels can occur. A dead pixel is a single pixel that has been turned to 
one color or is dead (black) and won't change. If this happens, the entire 
television set must be replaced, not an individual component. Most flat 
panel televisions have some dead pixels, but since the pixels are so small, 
they're usually unnoticeable. 
The two competing flat panel television technologies are plasma and LCD. 
While an LCD television costs less than a plasma television, it can't produce a 
picture like a plasma television can. Some of the advantages of a plasma screen 
over an LCD television are a brighter picture, a wider viewing angle, better color 
purity, and a higher contrast ratio. Not surprisingly, plasma televisions are more 
expensive than LCD televisions (as a rule). 
Not all is rosy, however, when you're looking to purchase flat panel televisions. 
While flat panel televisions are excellent performers and are light, crisp, and ready 
for HDTV; they're unbelievably expensive. At the time of this writing, a 50-inch flat 
panel television was easily over $10,000 (U.S.)-many times what a comparable 
projection or tube-based television would cost. That said, the future is definitely in 
flat panel technology, and it's only a matter of time before prices fall sufficiently to 
make them affordable to a wider market. 
NTSC Broadcast Standard 
The NTSC worked feverishly in the early 1950s to develop a broadcast standard 
that would enable both black-and-white and color transmissions to be viewable 
on one television. Up until the NTSC standard came into effect in 1953, there were 
other color standards (such as the Goldmark standard) that did not comply with 
the current black-and-white broadcast standards, meaning that the consumer had 
to literally have two televisions to watch both color and black-and-white program-
ming. Of course, in 1953 only the very rich or the die-hard technology aficionados 

had more than one television set in their home, so the development of a standard 
was critical to the progression and growth of television in North America. 
The NTSC standard involved breaking the black-and-white information and 
color information into two different signals. This method didn't degrade the black-
and-white quality, but rather allowed both systems to work off of the same signal. 
The actual specifications of the NTSC standard call for 525 vertical lines of resol-
ution (stacked on top of one another) displayed at 59.94 fields per second. Afield 
is a set of either even or odd lines, so in this case it would be either 263 or 262 
lines. These odd and even fields (basically half the lines on the screen) are 
displayed in a sequential manner, one after the other, thus painting alternate lines 
to create the full frame. One full frame, with both sets of lines painted, occurs 
roughly every 1/30 of a second, so even though every second line is being painted 
at 1 I 60 of a second, the entire amount of information streaming off the television 
screen is displayed only 1/30 of a second. 
Amazingly, the NTSC standard has been the television standard in North 
America and )apan (and numerous other countries) for 50 years, and it hasn't 
changed at all. The only differences in the quality of television is in the sets that 
the signal is watched on, not the signal itself. That, however, is finally changing 
with the advent and integration of HDTY. 
The Future of Television 
There have been a few dramatic changes in television in the last 50 years, but most 
of those changes have involved the quality and features of the televisions them-
selves, not the way that the signal is delivered to the television or the quality of 
that signal. Of course, in recent years the acceptance of DVD and more recently 
the popularity of progressive scan DVD players (players that output the signal at 
maximum resolution) has made it possible for those with high-definition televi-
sion sets (and even those without) to enjoy a much clearer picture than they've 
been otherwise used to. The real leap in television is scheduled to occur in North 
America by 2006. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has mandated 
2006 as the year that all broadcasts must be in digital format, which in tum means 
that HD1V signals will be the norm rather than the exception. 
High Definition Television 
High-definition television (H01V) is best described as digital television that 
provides a significantly clearer picture than the 525-line standard of North 
America or the 625-line standard of Europe. There are several reasons why it has 
taken nearly 50 years to finally get the ball rolling for a higher resolution television 
Video

signal. First, there's such a huge installed base of analog televisions that the switch 
would be slow as consumers sluggishly adopted the new technology. The second 
reason is that it's very expensive for broadcasters to upgrade their equipment and 
broadcast equipment to capture images, process them, and then broadcast them 
in digital format. Nothing about the digital format is similar to the old analog 
system, and as a result the costs of switching over are significant. The last, and 
perhaps the most significant reason why we haven't seen a leap to HD1V sooner, 
is that digital picture images require a massive amount of information for every 
second they're on the screen. Until a compression algorithm came along that was 
able to reduce the bandwidth needed to produce HDT\T, we weren't going to be 
watching anything different at all. Eventually, in 1993, the MPEG-2 standard 
solved the bandwidth issues associated with HDTY. 
Because the FCC had some difficulty settling on a single HD1V standard, they 
decided on multiple formats that came from a "grand alliance" of companies, 
including AT&T, Zenith, Philips, Sarnoff, and Thomson. Ultimately, the FCC settled 
on a combination of formats including 1 080i, 1 080p, 960i, 720p, and 480p. The i 
means "interlaced," and the p stands for "progressive." Interlaced displays work 
on the same principle as old-fashioned television-that is to say that the screen is 
painted twice to get one full picture image, with odd or even lines being painted at 
any one time. Progressive scan technology paints the entire picture at once, thus 
eliminating any flicker there might be while creating superior picture quality. 
Most high -definition televisions today come with the capability to handle all 
of these formats (1080i, 960i, 720p, and 480p), so you don't have to worry a great 
deal about whether or not your television can take advantage of high-definition 
broadcasts. Most older televisions (2002 and earlier) don't support all of these 
formats-most only manage 1 080i and 480p (960i is 480p and 540p is basically 
1080i), while others offer 540p and 1080i and then up convert 480p to 540p to 
support it. Many of the 2003 models support all of these modes, but you should 
inspect the fine print before you commit to buying one. At the time of this writing, 
two major networks are broadcasting their HD1V in 1080i, a third is broadcasting 
in 720p, and yet another network is broadcasting in a nonstandard 540p format. 
Still, this should not be a concern to consumers, because chances are that all 
HD1V and HD1V-ready televisions (see Figure 1-6) sold in North America will 
work with what's being broadcasted. 

Figure 1-6. This Sony WEGA 32-inch HD1V television has a completely flat screen, 
is tube based and can handle all current North American HD1V standards. 
MPEG-2 
As mentioned in the previous section, it quickly became clear that if high-definition 
digital television was to be broadcast, the bandwidth issue would have to be 
addressed. In short, if there was no compression technology employed with HDTV 
broadcasts, the number of channels available would be very limited indeed. When 
you consider that one minute of 640x480 video in digital form takes up 1.8GB of 
memory, it isn't hard to see why some sort of compression is necessary to make 
digital television work. 
In 1993, engineers from the 18 countries participating in developing the 
HDTV standard agreed on MPEG-2 compression technology as the standard for 
video compression for the HDTV format. MPEG-2 uses redundancies in the image 
to reduce the amount of bandwidth needed to display the image. In other words, 
MPEG-2 compressed signals only display what has changed on the screen, not 
what has remained the same. Therefore, if a scene in a movie takes place in front 
of an orange wall, the orange wall information is actually only received once, and 
it doesn't change until the area of the screen displaying the orange wall changes 
images. By only transmitting "new" information to the screen, a great deal of 
bandwidth is conserved. MPEG-2 is also compatible with AC-3 Dolby sound, and 
it contains enough bandwidth to include auxiliary information as well as voice-
image syncing.

NOTE MPEG-2 is the same compression technology used for DVD tech-
nology, although the bit rate (the total amount of information flowing) is 
higher for DVD than it is for HDTv. MPEG-2 is the compression method for 
DSS service as well as DVDs. MPEG stands for Moving Pictures Experts 
Group, and there are several incarnations of MPEG compression, including 
the popular MPEG-3 (or MP3) compression used for audio files such as 
music available on Gnutella and other online forums. 
VHS and Betamax 
Since the inception of television in the 1940s, the only way in which the average 
consumer could watch a show was to catch the programming as it was broadcast. 
That is to say, if a show was scheduled to broadcast at 5:00 P.M., you had to be in 
front of the television at 5:00 P.M. or you would miss part or all of the show. The 
ability to tape television shows was available by the late 1950s, but it wasn't until 
1960 that Sony introduced a "compact" videotape recorder (VfR). These early 
video recorders were cumbersome because they could only record 1 hour at a 
time, and they employed a reel-to-reel methodology that meant users had to be 
able to thread the delicate tape through the machine in order to watch a show. The 
other drawback to these early machines was that only the very rich could afford 
the high-tech (at the time) equipment. As videotape technology became more 
sophisticated, the ante was upped and there were ever-smaller video recording 
devices on the market throughout the 1960s. It wasn't until1975, however, that 
Sony introduced what could be considered the first successful home video 
recording system: the Betamax. 
The Betamax quickly dominated the market (selling over 30,000 units in 1975) 
and was a success from the start. It owed its success largely to the fact that it was 
cassette based, but also because the units were relatively small and delivered a 
high-quality picture. The celebrations would have to be cut short, however, 
because the good old boys at JVC and Matshushita (Panasonic's parent company) 
had secretly been developing a new home video format, the Video Home System 
(VHS). While the quality of the VHS system was not as good as the Betamax, the 
VHS system could record twice as much information on one tape. The VHS 2-hour 
limit fit nicely with the standard 2-hour time frame of most movies, whereas the 
Betamax limit of 1 hour meant that a movie was out of the question without a 
cartridge swap. While the term "Betamax" became synonymous with home video 
recording devices, by the early 1980s Sony's market share was a third of the 
market, while VHS continued to flourish both because of tape length and the 
much lower cost of the VHS recording units. 

NOTE Quality does not always win out over quantity. The Sony Betamax 
system was noticeably better than the VHS format when it came to picture 
quality, but the public did not care about this and they showed this by 
spending their money on VHS machines rather than Betamax machines. 
The war between the two formats continued for years until in 1988 the first 
SonyVHS machines went on sale in North America. By 1994 the Betamaxformat 
was actually still around, but it was relegated to an extremely small portion of the 
market and VHS (see Figure 1-7) had clearly won the battles and the war. With 
the dawn of DVD players and with home DVD recorders now starting to enter the 
market, the use of videotape is beginning to decline. As DVD recorders become 
cheaper, the advantages that DVD can offer will mean that DVD recorders will 
begin to supplant videocassette recorders (VCRs) in homes all over the world. Still, 
VHS tapes are a large part of many home movie collections, and the VCR 
continues to be the television recording machine of choice.

How VCRs Work 
VCRs have become so ubiquitous that most of us take their technology for 
granted. The development of videotape technology required many years and 
had numerous seemingly insurmountable obstacles in its path over the years. 
Still, it made it to the point where you can buy yourself a VCR for $50 new! There 
are two main parts of the VCR that we discuss in this section: the tape (and tape 
cassette) and the mechanism that reads the tape (including the VCR head[s]). 
The Tape 
Although VHS tapes vary in length and quality, the basic VHS tape is a magnetic 
oxide-coated piece of plastic that's about 800 feet long and 112 inch wide. To give 
you an idea of how long 800 feet is, it's nearly the length of three football fields, 
and that's a lot of tape in one small cassette! This tape is wound up on two spin-
dles much like a cassette tape that's used for audio purposes, but the video 
cassette also contains a door that keeps the very fragile and thin videotape from 
being damaged by the environment. 
The Heads 
We need to start by mentioning that VCRs in North America are designed to work 
with the NTSC television standard; that said, we can continue the explanation. If 
you have ever glanced inside a VCR you may have noticed that there is a circular 
device inside. This device is a circular drum with at least two heads on it, one on 
each side of the drum 180 degrees apart. This circular drum rotates once every 30 
seconds so that each head meets the tape 30 times per second-the total number 
of times the heads hit the tape per second is 60. If you remember back to when we 
were discussing the NTSC standard, you will remember that the interlaced screen 
is drawn one-half at a time every 1/60 of a second, making for one complete 
picture every 1/30 of a second. The two heads in a VCR are literally writing the 
information to the tape in the same way that information would be displayed 
onscreen if it were receiving an NTSC broadcast signal. The audio portion of the 
content is recorded on a narrow portion on the outer aspect of the tape. This infor-
mation includes such details as what speed the information was recorded at and 
the sound for the video content. 

DVD 
NOTE When you adjust the tracking on a VCR, you are using a content strip 
to line up the tape for proper playback. Tracking adjustment is sometimes 
necessary because the tape can degrade, stretch, or even shrink a small 
amount. 
NOTE We now see the limitation ofVHS tape, specifically, that it is tied to 
the NTSC standard, which uses a 525-line interlaced format. This rela-
tively low-resolution image cannot compete with DVD and the HDTV 
technology that is to come. 
DVD stands for digital video disc or digital versatile disc, depending on whom you 
talk to, but for our purposes we'll just refer to it as DVD. DVD is fast becoming the 
standard for videophiles everywhere. Capable of storing over 4 hours of information 
on one side of the disc, the DVD (see Figure 1-8) can offer up superb picture 
quality, digital sound, and a plethora of extra features such as alternate sound 
tracks, a director's commentary, multiple viewing angles, and even deleted scenes 
and outtakes. The other huge advantage of DVD technology is that the user can 
hop from one scene to another almost instantaneously. With VHS tapes, the user 
must fast forward or rewind the tape to get to specific areas, and this can take 
minutes.

Chapter 1

Figure 1-8. A DVD looks much like a compact disc (CD), but it can hold nearly 70 
times more information. 
NOTE Most modern DVD players can serve a variety of functions now; 
they are able to play video CDs, audio CDs, DVDs, and even PC-formatted 
CD-Rs with MP3 audio files on them. Because of its power and versatility, 
the DVD player has become the focus of the home theater/stereo in just a 
few short years. 
DVDs also offers a permanency that videotape cannot; videotapes begin to 
degrade from the time they are recorded, and of course close proximity to a 
magnet will damage them significantly and irrevocably. In short, DVD is a far 
superior medium for viewing video of any kind. With the recent arrivals of DVD 
recordable and rewritable (DVD-R/RW) VCR-like machines, DVD is poised to 
supplant videotape forever. 

DVD History 
Although videotape and VCRs have dominated the scene for many years, the limi-
tations of video have started to rear their ugly heads. For example, we have a 
store-bought copy of a popular movie from the early 1990s on VHS. In the decade 
since we purchased that movie, the quality of the picture has degraded markedly 
to the point where it is not enjoyable to watch anymore. This and the 2-hour limit 
for high-quality video (among other factors) precipitated the need for a video 
format that could be purely digital and be distributed on a disc the same size as a 
standard audio CD. 
NOTE It can also be argued that DVD exists in large part because of Moore's 
Law. Moore's Law states that the power of a computer processor doubles 
every 18 months, and it has been this huge explosion in the power of 
computer processors that has precipitated the development of DVD tech-
nology. Certainly, the vast amount of information that must be moved 
and uncompressed requires powerful processors, and without these DVD 
would be only a theory instead of reality. 
In 1994, Sony and Philips working together came up with the specs for a 
digital disc that was one sided and dual layered and could hold many hours of 
video. There were other formats proposed, including a super-density disk (SD), 
but ultimately there was an agreement reached in 1995 that allowed for DVD to 
move forward. The fact that an agreement was reached was perhaps in part 
because oflessons learned over the protracted VHS/Betamax battle in the 1970s 
and 1980s. By 1997, the first DVD players hit the shelves in North America, and 
they sold better than anyone could have expected. Perhaps helped in part by the 
adoption ofDVD/CD-ROM drives in computers, DVD players became the fastest-
adopted new technology in history, and DVD technology is poised to push VHS 
right out the door in the next 5 years.

How DVD Works 
DVDs are actually closely related to CDs in size, appearance, and basic concept. 
The main exception for the standard DVD versus the CD is the amount of inform-
ation that a DVD is capable of holding. A standard DVD can hold over 130 minutes 
ofMPEG-2 video, plus up to eight audio tracks, the menu systems, and text 
screens. A standard single-layer DVD can hold 4. 7GB of data, a double-layer 
single-sided DVD can hold 8.5GB, and finally a double-sided double-layer DVD 
can hold a whopping 17GB. The way data is stored on DVD is almost exactly the 
same as it is in the CD format-that is to say that the data is represented on the 
disc by a series of pits and bumps that are run out in a long, contiguous layer. This 
layer is so long that a single-sided DVD's data track, iflaid out in a straight line, 
would be nearly 7.5 miles long. 
The way this information is read is by laser. A DVD player has a laser that can 
focus on the pits and bumps and read them as they zip by (DVDs spin inside a 
DVD player). The size ofthese pits and bumps is so small that it's difficult to 
impress just how tiny they are. When you consider that a DVD is capable of 
holding nearly 70 times more data than a standard CD, the tiny size of these pits 
and bumps becomes apparent. Earlier we mentioned dual-layer discs. These 
DVDs have two layers of information, both on one side of the disc. On a single-
layer DVD, there is a reflective coating on the top portion of the disc that reflects 
the laser back and allows the data to be read. Dual-layer DVDs have this same 
layer, but there is also an in-between layer that is semireflective. This semireflec-
tive layer can be penetrated by altering the focus of the DVD player's laser, thus 
allowing for twice as much information to be stored on one side of a DVD. 
MPEG-2 and DVD 
Even though DVDs can hold a massive amount of information, when you consider 
that 1 minute of 640x480 color video takes up 1.8GB of space, you can see that 
uncompressed, even a double-layer DVD could only hold about 4 minutes and 
40 seconds of video. How do they get 4 hours ofhigh-qualityvideo and sound on 
one side of a DVD? The answer is MPEG-2 compression, which we discussed 
earlier in this chapter. 
When a DVD is compressed, it is not simply compressed at a particular rate; 
rather, each frame is compressed one at a time to maximize the compression 
without compromising quality. There appears to be an art to compression of 
video, because some DVDs are simply not encoded as well and the quality is 
noticeably lower than others. Not to worry, however, because most DVDs on the 
market are well encoded and won't disappoint. Some DVDs are thoroughly opti-
mized and are sold at a premium, such as the Superb it collection that is currently 
available for true aficionados. 

Laserdisc 
Back before there was DVD, there was a video medium that had excellent quality 
and came on a laser-read disc. The Laserdisc was never a huge success, but video 
aficionados adopted this format and lovingly kept it alive. Many of the features 
now available on DVD, such as alternate soundtracks and director's commen-
taries, were pioneered on Laserdisc long before they became a reality on DVD. 
Laserdisc was invented back in the 1960s and patented by David P. Gregg in 1961. 
Back then he thought of it as a "videodisk," but the basic principles of this tech-
nology are clearly the genesis of all subsequent disk designs (CD, DVD, and so 
forth). While Mr. Gregg's original idea was an analog product, the same basic prin-
ciples were ultimately used in the creation of the CD and also the DVD. 
The RCA Videodisk 
Back in the early 1980s, RCA came out with a videodisk technology that used an 
analog disk that was read by a stylus much like a record player uses. Like the 
Laserdisc, this disk had to be flipped halfway through a movie, but that was the 
least of its problems. The area at the end of the disk (near the inside of the disk) 
had a tendency to wear out faster than the rest of the disk, causing video 
breakup sometimes after only a few uses. The result was a fuzzy picture right 
before the movie reached the point where the disk had to be flipped. Needless to 
say, this technology, which was introduced to compete with the VHS and 
Betamax, quickly failed. 
The Laserdisc technology that was sold by Pioneer (and is still available today 
in a limited way) involved a reader, and large Laserdiscs that were the size of old-
fashioned audio records. The biggest drawback to Laserdisc is that the discs 
themselves only hold 1 hour of video per side, which requires the user to flip the 
disc halfway through a movie. The availability of movies for this format has also 
been an issue, and today Laserdisc movies are limited mostly to specialty stores if 
they are sold at all.

Video CD 
Video CDs are basically a product that was created when computers met the CD-R 
format. The Video CD uses the same technology and basic data reading/writing 
that CDs use, making them easy to create on today's home PCs. In the late 1980s, 
a few Video CDs were actually released, but they were limited by the CD's size 
constraints and could only hold about 20 minutes of video. Video CDs today use 
MPEG-1 compression to give about 1 hour of video per CD. This is mostly used 
for putting home video on a permanent format, but unfortunately some less 
scrupulous people use this technology to put copyrighted movies on Video CDs. 
The quality of these CDs, however, is certainly lacking and can't compete with 
DVD or Laserdisc. 
/ 
TIP If you're interested in finding one of these old Video CDs, you can try 
to find David Bowie's Sound+ Vision four-CD set that included a Video CD 
of his '~hes to Ashes" music video. 
For now, Video CDs are bridging the gap for people who have home video that 
they would like to have available on a convenient CD rather than on digital video-
tape. Most contemporary DVD players can play Video CDs, making them a viable 
option if you need to archive some midrange-quality video. 
There is also Super Video CD (SVCD). This format is similar to Video CD and is 
capable of holding 30-60 minutes of very good quality, full-motion video as well as 
two stereo soundtracks on a 74-minute CD-R.

Home Video and Video Editing 
Home video has been around in one form or another for many years. Heck, Bart's 
grandfather used 16mm ffim back in the 1920s to record life in rural Saskatchewan! 
More recently, 16mm color ffim was used, and by the mid-1980s the videotape 
camcorder had become ubiquitous with families and tourists alike, and people 
were recording millions of hours offootage every year. It is hard to imagine how 
we have come from the giant videotape recording units of the 1950s to the tiny 
handheld digital camcorders of today, but the technological advancements have 
marched on, and now many camcorders are actually called palmcorders because 
they are so very small. With the recent flood of digital camcorders that have found 
their way into the average home, using the PC as a video editing tool has become 
increasingly popular, and with the HTPC the newly edited home videos can be 
streamed right off the HTPC's hard drive and onto a high-definition television 
screen. 
Analog/Digital Cameras 
Up until1998, the standard cameras were not digital, they were analog, and as a 
rule they used 8mm (also called Hi-8) tape to record. Since 1998, however, more 
and more of the cameras sold are digital cameras. These cameras often use the 
same tapes, but they record the information digitally rather than in an analog 
fashion. Why is this good? Digital information is more permanent than analog, 
because error correction algorithms can account for any degradation in the 
quality of the digital information on the magnetic tape. With an analog tape, that 
degradation is seen right on the screen. Digital video is also very handy if you have 
a computer that can edit and manage digital video. Computers with this capability 
can create professional-looking movies with multiple soundtracks and digital 
effects, and then output them to Video CD, VHS, or even burn them onto record-
able DVDs (DVD-Rs).

NOTE While digital camera connectivity and digital video editing tech-
nology is just emerging on the mainstream PC, the Apple Macintosh line of 
computers has been doing it for years now. If you're interested in making 
incredibly professional-looking movies easily and then burning them onto 
..,.,___ 
your own DVD, think about picking up one of the new iMacs or a Mac 
with a Superdrive DVD player in it. These drives can bum DVD-R media so 
that you can make your own home movie DVDs easily. These Macs also 
come with iDVD and iMovie, two pieces of software that tum the chore of 
video editing into a treat. Lastly, all Macs come with IEEE 1394 Pi rewire 
ports for easy connection to digital cameras. Very few PCs have this built 
in. Unfortunately, we don't feel that the Mac is a viable computer for 
creating a kick-ass HTPC, so we don't cover it in this book, but if video 
editing is your main passion, the Mac is worth looking at. 
While importing movies onto an HTPC with a digital camera is a breeze, it's 
not impossible or even difficult to get yourself an adaptor that will allow you to 
stream your analog video source (even from a VCR) into your computer and turn it 
into digital footage. The quality won't be as good, but at least your precious home 
movies will be moving into the permanent realm of digital rather than degrading 
on analog tape. There are many devices and video cards, such as the ATI Radeon 
7500, that are capable of importing video sources, but we won't go into detail 
about that now-you can read about that in Chapter 6. 
Summary 
While a background in the history of television, DVD, and audio/visual technology 
isn't absolutely necessary for creating a home theater PC (HTPC), the history of 
these technologies is interesting and can provide a frame of reference for the 
novice, especially when terms such as "NTSC" and "high definition'' are being 
bandied about. Figure 1-9 shows a timeline of important developments in televi-
sion, video, DVD, and so forth from 1900 to 2002.

CHAPTER 2 
Home Theater PC Uses 
THIS CHAPTER WILL answer the question, "Why should my DVD player be an HTPC?" 
To the computer hobbyist, this question needs no answer: Building a machine 
to play movies is much more fun than just purchasing one. For the rest of us, 
however, this question needs to be answered to provide some justification for 
investing time and money to create a machine that on the surface looks like it 
could easily be replaced by a low-cost DVD player. Of course, there is a lot more 
to an HTPC than just playing DVD movies, but since DVD technology represents 
the state-of-the-art for home theater, it is an ideal topic for comparing an HTPC 
to the alternatives and showing how the HTPC has many advantages over 
conventional DVD players. 
Under the best conditions, an HTPC can provide better picture and sound 
than an off-the-shelf consumer DVD player. With the imminent arrival of high-
definition television (HD1V), many people are already considering (or have 
made) the purchase of a new, larger television that is capable of displaying HD1V 
formats. In order to get the best possible high-resolution picture quality on an 
HDTV; many home theater enthusiasts use a line-doubler to increase resolution. 
These devices are available in a range of quality and prices, but an HTPC can 
output a comparable or better quality video picture for less money. 
The output from an HTPC is much more adjustable than that from a dedi-
cated DVD player, and in addition to precise adjustments to color levels and 
saturation, the HTPC allows for a variety of ways to convert the 24 frames per 
second (fps) of film to the 30 fps oftelevision and to scale up the image for high-
quality monitors. On a small display, this conversion is hardly noticeable, but on 
larger displays it becomes a much-discussed and debated issue. Even those home 
theater systems that include only a standard NTSC-capable television can benefit 
from the picture quality fine-tuning that can be accomplished with an HTPC (see 
Figure 2-1).

Figure 2-1. The HTPC looks like any other PC, but when configured properly 
it can make all the difference. 
Improving Picture Quality 
Standard television picture quality is quite poor compared to the newest movie 
and digital television formats. The NTSC television format specifies 525 lines of 
resolution at 60 fields per second, which is composed of 30 interlaced frames per 
second. On a standard direct-view television tube, this looks acceptable, but when 
the picture is bigger, the interlaced scan lines are visible. The NTSC television 
format was never meant for the large screen displays that are becoming popular 
today-after all, the NTSC standard was developed in 1953! 
, ,_ 
NOTE Progressive scan means that all the lines on the monitor are being 
painted at the same time. This is different from interlaced pictures, where 
the scan lines are painted every second row. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
On a 36-inch or larger display, you can see the scan lines plainly from even 
an average 6-foot viewing distance. To counter this problem, newer television 
formats either increase the resolution or up-convert it to a progressively scanned 
picture. High-definition digital television uses progressive scan for all resolutions 
below 960 lines. Computer monitors can switch between interlaced and progres-
sive modes, but consumer television sets do not switch. It is very easy to tell the 
difference between an interlaced picture and a progressive scan picture when 
comparing large television sets side by side in a store, and most people who can 
afford to do so prefer to buy the progressive scan set. 
Converting Interlaced Video to Progressive Scan 
Converting the NTSC interlaced picture to a progressive scan picture is not simple, 
and this is why the HTPC is a great tool for this problem. Remember that an inter-
laced picture shows half the picture lines each time it draws the screen. Even 
though the next set oflines follows right away, moving objects on the screen will 
not be in exactly the same spot as they were when the previous set of lines was 
displayed. The two sets oflines that make up the interlaced picture are not simply 
two halves of the same frame; they are each half of a separate frame (though NTSC 
is still referred to as 30 fps). Converting interlaced television pictures to progres-
sive scan pictures cannot be done properly by simply drawing both sets of lines at 
the same time. The edges of moving objects look distorted by "stair steps," and fine 
detail will appear to flicker and vibrate. 
A better method of converting interlaced to progressive scan is to double each 
interlaced line. This creates a full resolution picture for every field by repeating 
each line in the field, which means that the field becomes a full frame of inform-
ation. The new frame does not have as much information as the combined 
interlaced frame, since it is made from half the lines of the full interlaced frame, 
but it has no motion-induced distortion. Thus, the resulting video signal has lower 
resolution and a higher frame rate. 
These two methods of converting interlaced video to progressive scan 
video are called line doubling. A high-quality line-doubler also does some extra 
processing to eliminate motion distortion or increase resolution, depending on 
which method is used to convert the video signal. Though the resulting video 
quality is better than the original interlaced video, it is never as good as a native 
progressive scan signal. Though most high-quality progressive-scan televisions 
up-convert interlaced video to progressive scan, an HTPC can perform this function 
with more options to fine-tune and configure the video quality. 
35 

Chapter2 
36 
Image Scaling 
Converting the resolution of a standard NTSC video signal to a high-resolution 
display device is almost as complicated as the interlaced to progressive scan 
conversion. Some display projectors require an up-conversion, though this is not 
usually needed, since almost all HD1V-ready televisions sold today will display 
NTSC just fine. However, many digital projectors and LCD or plasma displays have 
a native resolution. This is the resolution that the set was manufactured to display, 
and all other resolutions are either converted or not displayed at all. Therefore, in 
some cases it is desirable to convert the resolution, and doing so requires compli-
cated digital processing. 
NOTE Although the NTSC video standard is 525 lines, only about 480 of 
those lines are visible to the viewer. The rest are used to synchronize the 
display to the signal and carry the closed captioning information. 
If the picture resolution is not converted to a simple multiple of the native 
format (i.e., 480 lines converted to 960 lines), then some lines are converted 
unevenly to the new resolution. Converting 480 lines to 540 lines means that every 
eighth line is repeated. This would make the resulting image look pretty odd, so 
instead of just doubling some interval of lines, a good converter will average the 
information on each line and use that information to draw the new lines. Such a 
video converter is called an image scaler and is quite costly. Low-quality scalers 
start above $700.00, and prices go up to $20,000.00 for high-quality units. 
The HTPC Advantage 
The HTPC will do the interlaced-to-progressive-scan conversion and video scaling 
at a high quality for considerably less cost than an external scaler. Using an HTPC 
to output to a high-definition display device is a great solution to the prohibitive 
costs of an image scaler. The HTPC can be set to the best image resolution that the 
display can handle-such as 720p or 1080i for an HDTV-and it will convert every-
thing else up to that quality. Even DVD movies, which are encoded at 480p, can be 
displayed at HDTV resolution. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
TIP Scaling an NTSC (480i) or DVD (480p) video image to lOBOi does not 
make it as good as a native 1 OBOi video image. The original video signal 
does not gain extra information-the extra lines in the high-definition 
image are just filled in with detail from the original lines. The only advan-
tage to scaling an image up is to keep the display at its native resolution. 
It may also be convenient to leave the television set at one display resolution 
setting and use the HTPC to switch between video sources with different 
resolutions. 
Many DVD movies are presented with an anamorphic picture. This means that 
the picture is not the same shape as a standard television screen, which has a ratio 
of width to height of 4:3. An anamorphic picture is usually wider than a standard 
television, and these wide-screen movies are meant for wide-screen televisions. 
When an anamorphic movie is shown on a 4:3 television, black space is visible 
above and below the picture. Some viewers find this distracting, and even an 
HTPC cannot do much to alleviate it. However, the anamorphic movie shown on 
a 4:3 television has another problem, and most home theater enthusiasts consider 
it a much bigger problem than the black bars: resolution loss. Since the movie 
picture is squeezed down to fit into the display area, it loses resolution. To put it 
another way, those black bars above and below the picture are using up lines of 
resolution that the picture in the middle of the screen should use. The effects of 
this are subtle, but disturbing to those who are fussy about picture quality. 
The simple solution is to use a wide-screen television to watch anamorphic 
DVD movies. Since the television is the same shape as the movie picture, the 
picture fills the whole screen and is shown at maximum resolution. The problem 
now is that watching a standard television broadcast suffers from having blank 
areas on each side of the picture, since it was intended for a 4:3 television and is 
too narrow for the wide-screen set. Another solution is to buy a 4:3 television set 
that can squeeze the scan lines into the visible picture area when displaying 16:9 
video. This feature is called vertical compression or anamorphic squeeze, and it 
is becoming a more common, though expensive, option on new 4:3 HDTV sets. 
The HTPC can provide a solution for those with a 4:3 high-definition televi-
sion. By up-converting DVD movies to 720p or 1080i, anamorphic video pictures 
will be displayed at maximum resolution. The black bars are still present at the top 
and bottom of the screen, but there is enough resolution left in the picture area 
to show the movie without distortion. No off-the-shelf consumer DVD player can 
do that! 
37 

Chapter2 
38 
NOTE Some high-definition televisions, such as Sony's tube-based HDTVs, 
have a built-in feature that ensures that the black bars on the top and the 
bottom of the picture are not painted at all and that resolution is maxi-
mized. Unfortunately, televisions like this are few and far between, thus 
bringing the HTPC to the forefront to solve the problem. 
Improving Audio Quality 
Traditionally, computer audio has been poor, more often the subject of ridicule 
and jokes than the standard benchmark of quality. Some bright spots in the 
history of computer audio exist, however, such as the sound capabilities of 
the Commodore Amiga or the futuristic tones of digital keyboard synthesizers, but 
in the past, most home computers had sound that was poor, bad, or nonexistent. 
Digital Sound 
In the later 1990s, computer processors became fast enough to handle digital 
sound (and indeed, even digital video). This led to a revolution in computer sound 
hardware. By the late 1990s, most avid computer users were disconnecting their 
PCs from the small, cheap speakers that came with the system and were instead 
connecting to high-quality sound systems and even their home stereo. Many 
people began to use the CD-ROM drive in their computer to play audio CDs, and 
then to decode and play back digitally compressed audio such as MP3 and WMA 
files. With the increase in hard disk capacity over the years, it is possible to store 
many hundreds of hours of compressed audio in a home computer. 
When CD digital audio was introduced in the mid-1980s, it set a new standard 
of quality for sound and storage media. It was not until the early 1990s, when 
many new PCs were sold with CD-ROM drives, that computer buyers started to 
ask for sound capabilities in their new systems that could match the quality of 
sound stored on a CD. 
Sound quality was important to computer game players, too. It is a little-
acknowledged fact that the amazing innovation in computer games during the 
1990s sold a lot of computer hardware and increased demand for graphics and 
sound capabilities. Each new generation of computer games needed faster 
computer processors, more memory, faster video hardware, and higher quality 
sound. These great advancements in video and audio capabilities pay off in a big 
way for home theater enthusiasts who want to build an HTPC because the home 
computer is now powerful enough to create a high-quality theater experience-
and it can still play all those fantastic games! 

Home Theater PC Uses 
CD Audio 
The quality of CD audio has recently been surpassed. Chapter 3 explains how 
higher bit rates, increased sampling frequencies, and denser storage media have 
all led to new digital audio formats that store and re-create music at a higher 
quality than CDs. Newer sound hardware also supports digital inputs and outputs, 
so that recording and playing back high-quality sound tracks is possible. For 
the HTPC hobbyist, this means that upgrading to a new sound card capable of 
supporting 24-bit/96 KHz digital sound is more appealing, since it can now take 
advantage of more than just DVD movies. 
A huge benefit that arises from using a PC to reproduce music is that when 
a new digital format is released, the computer can be upgraded or adapted to 
support it. With a large market of computer users who want premium-quality 
sound reproduction for computer games, home theater, presentations, and 
professional audio editing, it is a safe bet that the HTPC will remain at the leading 
edge of audio technology for years to come. 
Networking the HTPC 
Since the HTPC is still a PC at heart, it is perfectly suitable to networking with 
other computers. It is becoming common to find homes with more than one PC 
and to find high -speed Internet access available in many large cities. Adding 
computer networking capabilities to the HTPC (see Figure 2-2) is a great idea for 
many reasons. 
Figure 2-2. A network can add functionality to your HTPC, such as allowing it to 
bring audio files over from another PC.

Chapter2 
40 
A Media Player 
First, the HTPC is essentially a media player, and it can benefit from the extra 
storage capacity that a computer network allows. In these days of digital conver-
gence, when many media formats are digital, the computer can record, store, and 
play back these digital media. From CD audio music or digitized LP records to 
home movies or downloaded digital video clips, the media files use up a lot of 
space on a hard disk. The HTPC is a great machine to use as a media server in the 
home, where every computer connected to the same network can play the audio 
and video files stored on the HTPC. 
The HTPC can also be used as just a player, with another computer on the 
network serving out files. By reducing the number of hard disk drives in the HTPC, 
the heat is reduced, and therefore the number and speed offans needed to cool 
the system is reduced. This makes for a much quieter HTPC, which is a major 
consideration for most home theater rooms. It also allows for better performance 
for the HTPC, since it is dedicated to home theater tasks, instead of also serving 
files out to other computers on the network. 
Internet Access 
Second, the HTPC can benefit from networking where broadband access to 
the Internet is available. An HTPC with an Internet connection can be used for 
convenient access toe-mailing and Web browsing, and streaming media formats 
for Internet radio or video clips. 
Even broadband Internet access cannot provide the minimum video quality 
that most people would find acceptable, though for some functions many are 
willing to make a sacrifice. The great thing about having the HTPC connected to 
the Internet is not to stream video, however, but to download it to the hard disk 
before playing it back. Many feature films and television shows provide preview 
video clips and movie trailers, which are of high enough quality to benefit from 
playback in the home theater. Watching a trailer on a conventional PC with a small 
screen and poor sound system is no match for the HTPC connected to a big televi-
sion and digital home theater audio receiver. 
Communication 
The third major reason for networking an HTPC is for online chatting or videocon-
ferencing. It is far more comfortable to gather people around the television in a 
home theater room for a videoconferencing session with distant relatives than to 

Home Theater PC Uses 
crowd around a small PC monitor stuck in the corner of a spare bedroom or office. 
It is also more convenient to participate in Internet chats or instant messaging on 
a large display, where you can resize video from broadcast television to a smaller 
area of the screen while the chat takes place. 
Gaming 
The final reason for networking an HTPC may apply only to a portion of those 
who are interested in building and operating such a system. Computer games 
have become widely popular since the availability of multiplayer sessions on 
the Internet. Most games released these days allow a small number of players to 
connect to each other over the Internet and play a round or two. It is an experi-
ence unlike anything a player could find in a single-player game. Also, several 
massive multiplayer games are available on the Internet now. These games do not 
start and end when a few friends decide to have a session-they continue 24 hours 
a day as people come and go from the game server. The HTPC is quite capable of 
the performance needed to play most modern multiplayer computer games. 
NOTE The HTPC is a great system for game playing. Most garners desire a 
video card that is optimized for speedy 3D graphics, and these features also 
give the card excellent MPEG-2 and DVD playback capabilities. No single 
video card is able to claim the best features and performance for games 
and video playback, so the HTPC must compromise on one or the other. 
However, the HTPC is still capable of playing modern computer games, 
and having the games presented on a big-screen display with ground-
shaking audio can go a long way toward making up for the marginal 
loss of cutting-edge graphics performance. 
Using an HTPC 
The HTPC is more than just a glorified DVD movie and CD audio player. It is 
a computer that specializes in high-quality audio and video, but it is also a 
computer that can perform all the functions of any other PC. Since this PC is 
located in the home theater, it often becomes the most convenient computer to 
use. In this section, we make some suggestions for uses of an HTPC and the hard-
ware and software required for these functions. The functions intended for the 
HTPC will determine the size and shape of the system case, the location of the 
system, and the attachment of external peripherals. Intended functions will also 
affect the software that needs to be loaded and configured. The HTPC is very 
41 

Chapter2 
42 
adaptable, but as with all computer systems, planning ahead can save effort and 
frustration later on. 
Putting the excellent audio and video capabilities of the system to good use 
requires some knowledge and time on the part of the HTPC hobbyist. Unlike off-
the-shelf consumer equipment, an HTPC does not simply plug into the wall, 
connect to the television, and start playing movies. The system must be put 
together-sometimes right from scratch (this is the way most hardcore hobbyists 
prefer it!)-and then configured. Often this configuration needs several tweaks in 
order to find the optimal settings. An HTPC can be set up to behave like any other 
home theater component-point the remote and click a button-but achieving 
this level of simplicity takes a great understanding of the complexity inherent in 
the system. 
TIP Actually, the HTPC can be a "plug-and-play" device now. Several 
manufacturers have introduced HTPC products to the retail market. 
Though these machines never have the same balance of cost and perform-
ance that each individual prefers, they are just as configurable and 
upgradeable as custom-built systems. For those with limited technical 
skill, or little interest in assembling their own machine, the retail HTPC is 
a great solution. 
Each function of the HTPC requires hardware and software to support it. 
Many functions use the same hardware, such as the video card and sound card. 
Some functions require specialized hardware, such as a computer game that may 
require a joystick or game pad. Later chapters of this book explain precisely how to 
configure major components such as the video card and sound card. This section 
serves as an overview of what's available to you and what you should consider 
when planning an HTPC system. 
Playing DVD Movies 
This functionality is perhaps the most popular use for the HTPC. It is also a 
great measurement by which to assess the capability to perform other functions. 
A system that can play back DVD movies with optimal video and sound will also 
be able to perform most other home theater tasks with excellence. 
We discussed the advantages of using an HTPC to play movies earlier in this 
chapter. With the low cost of DVD-ROM drives today, almost all PCs shipped to 
consumers include them. This does not guarantee that the system is suitable for 

Home Theater PC Uses 
DVD movie playback in a home theater, however, and it may not mean that the 
system can play DVD movies at all. 
Required Hardware 
In addition to a DVD-ROM drive, the HTPC requires a sound card. Sound hard-
ware is usually added to a computer system by including an add-in component 
called an expansion card, or more specifically, a sound card. Sometimes the sound 
hardware is added to the main system board, also called the motherboard, instead 
of adding it separately. This saves some cost and makes the system cheaper, but it 
is notoriously difficult to upgrade systems that have sound hardware on the moth-
erboard. Instead of simply swapping one sound card for another, the system must 
be configured to switch off the built-in sound hardware before a new sound card 
is added. Switching off such built-in sound hardware may require a jumper to be 
moved or a system BIOS setting to be altered, and unfortunately there is no 
standard regarding this procedure. The good news is that some motherboards 
are available with very high-quality sound hardware built in, including digital 
audio output and surround-sound analog connections for full surround sound 
speaker sets. 
Sound 
The digital surround soundtrack from a DVD movie can be read by the DVD drive 
and sent to the sound card, and then sent directly to an external digital decoder 
such as a digital receiver that supports the Dolby Digital5.1 and DTS 5.1 formats. 
This is usually the preferred way to configure the home theater, since the digital 
receiver I decoder has more power to drive the speakers than the PC. For such a 
setup, the sound card needs to have a digital output. This may be either a coaxial 
S/PDIF connector or an optical Toslink connector. Be aware that some sound 
cards with the S/PDIF connector use a nonstandard voltage to send digital infor-
mation because they are meant to be used only with the manufacturer's external 
hardware. Some Creative Labs sound cards are like this. Also, most computer 
sound hardware with a digital audio output uses a mono DIN output connector, 
which requires a converter to connect a standard RCA-type digital audio cable. 
Some sound cards do not preserve the quality of the digital audio from the 
DVD. They down-sample the 24-bit/96 KHz sound to a lower rate supported inter-
nally by the sound processor, and then up-convert it again when it is output 
through the digital output port. This causes some degradation in the final sound 
quality. A lot of cheaper sound cards, such as the low-cost cards from Creative 
Labs and C-Media, will do this. 
43 

Chapter2 
44 
Video Output 
Most computers are not capable of sending video output to a television, since a 
standard television requires an analog video signal that is very different from the 
normal Video Graphics Array (VGA)-type signal that is sent to a computer 
monitor. For an HTPC that will be used to display on a standard NTSC television, 
a video card that has an NTSC output port is required. This is not an uncommon 
feature for computer video cards, and it adds only a small extra cost to the hard-
ware, but many systems do not include such features. 
For the serious home theater enthusiast, the HTPC must be able to output 
video compatible with the high-definition television standards that have recently 
been introduced. Computer users familiar with the display settings of their 
computer will notice that the PC has the capability to output a great variety of 
resolutions and refresh frequencies, many of which are even higher quality than 
the highest HDTV standard. For those HDTV sets with a VGA input, connecting 
the HTPC is only a matter of plugging in the video cable and setting a compatible 
display resolution and refresh rate. For the vast majority of HDTV sets without a 
VGA connector, another piece of hardware is required. 
The device that converts the VGA output of a computer to the component 
inputs used by an HDTV set is called a transcoder. It is also known as a converter, 
a component adapter, or a break-out box. It is a little box with a VGA input and a 
component output, and inside it converts the VGA signal to theY-Pb-Pr signal of 
the three-line component output. It is an external device that sits behind the 
HTPC. Transcoders are not widely available or easily found at local electronics 
retailers. The normal method for acquiring one is to order it from an Internet 
merchant. Though inconvenient to procure, the transcoder is one of the most 
critical components of the HTPC system. 
ATI has recently begun to offer a special transcoder for their Radeon 8500 
and 9700 series of video cards. This transcoder is much less expensive than other 
converters, though it only works with the ATI hardware and it has some output 
limitations. Overall, it seems to be well received and offers a very high-quality 
video picture. 
Many front projection televisions and some rear projection televisions do not 
require a transcoder; they require an RGBHV cable connected directly from the 
HTPC to the projector or television. The RGBHV cable is a cable that converts the 
VGA-type connector on the back of the PC to the red-green-blue connectors on 
the display. This cable is also expensive and relatively difficult to find, but it is 
cheaper than a transcoder since it does nothing more than reroute the wires from 
the VGA connector to fit into the inputs on the television set. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Required Software 
With all of the required hardware installed, the HTPC still cannot play DVD movies 
without software. The HTPC needs a DVD movie player application to read the 
movie information from the DVD player, decode it, and display it on the screen 
and output the sound to the sound card. Software players are not commonly 
included with computer operating systems, so you must purchase the application. 
Since not all software DVD players are created equally, it is helpful to know the 
features of the available applications and which ones are considered best. Chapter 9 
of this book includes information about popular DVD movie players. 
NOTE The reason that DVD movie-playing software is only available for 
purchase is that DVD movies are encrypted on the disc, and only licensed 
manufacturers have the keys to decrypt the movies. Each brand of 
consumer DVD player has a unique key that can play an encrypted DVD 
..,.,____ 
movie, which the manufacturer has to pay licensing fees to use. Publishers 
of software DVD players must also pay to license a decryption key, so not 
many of them are keen to give their products away. Even video card manu-
facturers that provide DVD playing software for their hardware are careful 
to ensure that the player is either not easily accessible to noncustomers or 
does not work on other types of video hardware. 
You need to install and configure all of the hardware and software needed to 
play DVD movies. We provide complete details about installing hardware and the 
software drivers that support the hardware and installing software applications in 
later chapters in this book. 
Using the HTPC As an Audio Jukebox 
The convenience of converging audio formats into an HTPC is unmatched 
by any other device currently available. Even a massive 200- or 300-disc CD 
audio carousel cannot store as much music as the hard drive of an HTPC (see 
Figure 2-3). Plus, when it comes time to find a desired audio piece among such a 
massive collection, only the HTPC has the versatility of indexing and instant play 
that a computer can offer. 
45 

Chapter2 
46 
Figure 2-3. Portable MP3 jukeboxes, such as the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 
shown here, can't touch the functionality and storage space of an HTPC. 
The key to storing large amounts of music and other audio in a computer is 
digital compression. The benefits and drawbacks of using psycho-acoustic sound 
compression, such as the MP3 or WMA format, are discussed in Chapter 3. Some 
audiophiles find the concept of digital compression unacceptable-for those not 
willing to digitally compress music, the storage capacity of the HTPC is markedly 
reduced. Whatever the format, however, the limits of storage are only set by the 
capacity of hard disk drives installed in the computer. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Required Hardware 
The HTPC will have a sound card-without one it would be little more than a 
video player. This may suit some special purposes such as business presentations 
or slide shows, but the machine of interest to this book is for a home theater, and 
so the need for a sound card is unquestionable. However, the performance and 
specifications of the sound card may be questioned. 
An HTPC that is meant primarily for playing music may not require anything 
more than an average sound card. Because CD audio quality is measured at 16-bitl 
44KHz, and sound cards sold today (and indeed for many years now) are all 
compatible with this standard, most audio playback will not benefit from more 
expensive sound hardware. The only requirement is to select a good quality unit 
that is compatible with the operating system with which it is intended for use and 
that has the appropriate connectors to support the desired function of the sound 
system. 
CAUTION Some sound cards have compatibility problems when they are 
used with certain motherboards in combination with certain operating 
systems. See Chapter 5 for specific details about problems that we encoun-
tered when researching this book. 
Sound Card Connections 
The connectors on the sound card will determine what uses the HTPC has for 
audio jukebox functions (see Figure 2-4). The sound card will have, at the least, a 
speaker output to connect the system to external speakers. This is not usually the 
desirable way to configure an HTPC in the home theater, however. The sound 
card should therefore have a line-out connector to send audio to an external 
receiver I amplifier, which has more power to drive larger speakers. This line-out 
connector is almost always a ministereo jack (1/8 inch), and it is easy to confuse 
the speaker jack with the line-out jack, so you should take care to note that the 
sound card includes a line-out connection. The line-out is an analog port that 
sends audio at an appropriate level for the external receiver I amplifier. Although 
you can use the speaker output if there is no line-out, a proper line-out connector 
is preferable. 
47 

Chapter2 
48 
Figure 2-4. The sound card will determine how the HTPC performs with jukebox 
functions. 
Digitizing Audio Sources 
To use the HTPC to digitize other audio sources such as an LP record or an audio-
cassette, the sound card should have a line-in connection. This is similar to the 
line-out port in that they both handle analog audio at the same voltage level, 
but the line-in allows the sound hardware to receive sound connected from an 
external receiver I amplifier. Without a line-in connection, there will be no way 
to convert analog sound sources to digital format for playback on the HTPC. 
Most sound cards include a microphone jack. Not all HTPC hobbyists will 
need one, but there are a few uses for the microphone jack that we discuss later in 
this chapter. An important point to remember is that the microphone jack is not 
the same thing as a line-in jack-they operate at different voltage levels, and 
confusing the two can cause damage to the sound hardware in a computer. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
CAUTION Never plug a line-level input meant for the line-in port into a 
microphone input connector. The microphone connector uses a very low 
voltage, and sending the higher line-level voltage into it can cause damage 
to the audio circuitry and will cause painfully loud distortion to be heard. 
The microphone jack and the line-in jack are the same size, and they are 
often not well labeled, so you must take special care when connecting line-
level inputs. 
Connecting Speakers 
Some sound cards feature an extra set of speaker outputs for use with extra 
speakers. The surround sound formats for computer games are not all compatible 
with home theater surround sound, and these extra speaker outputs are generally 
not useful for an HTPC. Some sound cards are capable of outputting standard 5.1 
surround sound to speakers connected directly to the system, so in that case the 
extra speaker connectors may be desirable if the HTPC is not intended for use 
with an external digital audio receiver/amplifier. 
More expensive sound cards also feature extra line-in connectors (see 
Figure 2-5). These allow the HTPC to be used to mix audio sources in real time, 
which is the common method of producing professional video and audio segments. 
These extra connectors are not necessary for the home user wishing to mix audio, 
since there .are other methods of doing so, but for those hobbyists who need to 
combine audio from multiple sources simultaneously, a sound card that features 
multiple line-in connectors is worth the extra cost. 
Figure 2-5. Modern sound cards have an entire row of connections. 
49 

Chapter2 
50 
The final type of connector to consider is the digital input and output port. 
Chapter 3 has more information about the development of the S/PDIF and Toslink 
digital connectors. These are becoming more common on sound cards, though 
digital input connectors are still quite rare. Even cheap sound hardware can be 
used to reproduce high-quality digital sound since the sound card does very little 
processing of the digital audio stream, except to pass it through the output port to 
the external receiver. A digital input port requires more processing to accept an 
audio stream from an external source, so this audio hardware remains relatively 
expensive. 
For the Future 
If you're going to use the HTPC for newer digital audio formats, such as DVD-
Audio or Super Audio CD (SACD), it is worth investing in a higher-quality sound 
card. Where CD audio specifies a quality of 16-bit/ 44 KHz stereo, newer formats 
reach up to 24-bit/96 KHz with 5.1 channel sound, and beyond. Playing such 
formats through a standard 16-bit/44 KHz sound card will cause the high-quality 
digital sound to be down-sampled before it is output by the sound card, thus 
losing all the benefit of the higher-quality format. For such uses, you should use a 
24-bit/96 KHz sound card. Since DVD movies feature audio that can reach up to 
the 24-bit/96 KHz measurement, the investment in such a sound card is not 
purely for audio formats, though such high-quality bit rates are extremely rare on 
DVDmovies. 
The high-quality 24-bit/96 KHz sound cards all feature digital output ports, 
which are the preferred way to send digital audio to an external digital receiver/ 
amplifier. The line-out port on a sound card sends the analog sound that has 
already been decoded to the receiver. This analog sound is susceptible to interfer-
ence and degradation as it travels through the cable between the HTPC and the 
receiver, and other electrical fields from other home theater components may 
affect what finally reaches the speakers. A digital signal is not affected as badly, 
since the bits are correctly decoded in the external receiver I amplifier as long as 
they arrive with enough coherence to be read as bits. Since the HTPC can output 
all audio through the digital connection, the best quality of sound is preserved 
for all formats. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Required Software 
You have several choices of software applications that play various types of audio 
on the PC. Some of them can only play back one file and must be requeued for 
each successive piece, and some of them can play file after file, continuously, 
repeating a track or the entire program infinitely. Some audio players can only 
play CD audio, while some can play CD audio and compressed audio files, and yet 
others can play all those types plus video and streaming media from the Internet. 
An application that can play back various media types, file formats, and audio 
sources is called a software jukebox. 
The jukebox you choose to play back audio files depends on what features 
you prefer and what cost is acceptable to you. Several of the jukeboxes are free but 
require registration and potentially undermine privacy. Some of them can auto-
matically convert a CD audio disc to a digitally compressed audio file, and some 
require extra steps to do so. To see some example jukebox applications and get 
more details about them, see Chapter 9. Whatever your preference, the HTPC will 
need some kind of software jukebox to organize, record, store, and play back 
audio files. 
A growing trend for digital audio enthusiasts is to convert all media formats to 
compressed audio files on the PC. To compress a digital audio file recorded from 
an analog source or CD audio disc, the jukebox application requires special soft-
ware called a codec. Some codecs are included with jukebox applications, and 
some can be added separately from the Internet or from other applications. The 
HTPC will likely acquire a long list of them through its lifetime. 
There are various digital compression methods available to the HTPC, each 
one with its own co dec. Some of the more common ones are MPEG-llayer 3 
(MP3), Windows Media Audio (WMA), and RealAudio (RA). With good jukebox 
software, the HTPC can record and play each format easily. With an Internet 
connection, the jukebox application can even look up the album title and song 
names of COs that are being converted to compressed audio files, saving you the 
time and effort of typing the information into the HTPC manually. 
The greatest advantage of using the HTPC to play audio is its capability to 
store, organize, and access a massive collection of music. It does not require a 
specialized, expensive sound card to start a system capable of CD audio quality 
playback. Yet you can configure the HTPC with the highest quality audio hardware 
available to reproduce new digital audio formats without losing a single nuance. 
Though the HTPC may be considered primarily a DVD movie player, it is also an 
unmatched audio player.

Using the HTPC As a Television Tuner and HDTV Tuner 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the HTPC can scale up any video source to 
match the highest quality available from the display device. This makes the HTPC 
a good way to receive standard television broadcastsÂ·and scale them up to a high-
quality television or projector. If the display device is a standard NTSC-compatible 
television, then the HTPC is still a convenient device to use as a television tuner, if 
only to avoid switching between different input settings on the television. 
Most HDTV sets sold do not have an HDTV tuner built in. This is partly 
because of the extra cost (HDTV sets are already much more expensive than stan-
dard televisions) and partly because the broadcast standards were not agreed 
upon until quite recently, as we noted in Chapter 1. Instead of purchasing an 
external HDTV tuner for high-definition-capable sets, you can add this function-
ality to an HTPC for a lower cost and with more configuration options. 
Required Hardware 
Television tuner cards for PCs are becoming quite inexpensive. Most of them not 
only provide a tuner for cable or over-the-air broadcasts, but they also have video 
inputs to accept video from VCRs or camcorders. The quality of a computer televi-
sion tuner card is usually quite good (easily comparable to a good television set or 
VCR), and they are capable of tuning the more than 100 channels used in some 
markets today. 
Television tuners for computers are available in two physical varieties: 
internal expansion cards and external devices. The external television tuner 
usually plugs into the computer via the USB bus, which causes some problems. 
The USB 1.0 bus specification allows for a maximum data transfer rate of 12 
megabits per second, which is not enough to send the full525lines ofNTSC televi-
sion to the computer, so the video is scaled down to reduce the amount of digital 
data that needs to move across the bus. The newer USB 2.0 specification allows for 
a much higher data rate (480 megabits per second), which will make newer USB 
television tuners better. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Internal Thners 
Internal television tuners look like other computer adapter cards, and they usually 
use the faster PCI bus inside the system. These tuner cards are able to send the full 
525lines of resolution to the PC, so they provide better picture quality. It is prefer-
able to use an internal television tuner card for HTPC purposes, since the quality 
of video is a prime concern for the HTPC hobbyist. Some video cards have televi-
sion tuners built in, which also provides optimum television quality. 
HDTVThners 
Thning HDTV is a more complicated subject. Thner cards for HDTV are just like 
internal television tuner cards for standard NTSC broadcasts, but the HDTV signal 
reaches the home in only a few restricted ways. Over-the-air broadcasts of HDTV 
are available in a few markets, and only a few channels are currently being broad-
cast even in the largest markets. The HDTV tuner card can only tune these 
over-the-air broadcasts. The HDTV channels on digital cable boxes and digital 
satellite services are not accessible to the HDTV tuner card. Though this may seem 
to make an HDTV tuner card a rather useless accessory, it is for this very reason 
that the HTPC is a good place for receiver HDTV: Why pay a lot of money for an 
external HDTV receiver of limited use, when HDTV tuner cards for the PC are 
much less expensive? 
NOTE It is hardly worth putting an HDIV tuner card into an HTPC that is 
not connected to a high-definition television: The high-resolution video 
will be down-converted to standard NTSC-quality video, which is avail-
able from a cheaper NTSC television tuner card. 
It seems that all HDTV tuner cards also tune standard NTSC broadcasts, not 
only from over-the-air antennas, but also from the coaxial cable television service 
in most homes. For those interested in experiencing HDTV in the home theater, an 
HDTV tuner card for the HTPC is a great way to do so economically. 
53 

Chapter2 
54 
NOTE Television tuner cards cannot replace digital cable boxes or digital 
satellite receivers. The security features of these components do not allow 
PC component manufacturers to make adapter cards for them. Though 
some are available from foreign distributors, they cannot be legitimately 
activated for domestic systems. The best solution is to get a television tuner 
card with a video input so that the output from these external decoders 
can be routed through the HTPC. 
Required Software 
All television tuner hardware comes with the software necessary to watch televi-
sion on the computer. Also, there are some third-party software applications 
available that you can use with many different brands and models of television 
tuner cards. This third-party software is usually pretty good because it includes 
extra features and configurations that give you more control over picture quality 
or other card features. For this reason, when you select a television tuner card, you 
should evaluate the software that works with the card. 
Using the HTPC As a Digital Video Recorder 
In the late 1990s an alternative to the VCR was introduced to the consumer 
market. The digital video recorder (DVR) is also known as a personal video recorder 
and by the brand names TiVo, ReplayTY, and Ultimaterv. The DVR is a video 
recorder that digitizes the audio and video signal from a television and stores it on 
hard disk drives inside the unit. 
The DVR is much more versatile than the VCR. Not only can the DVR play back 
the video that it has recorded, but it can also play it back while it is recording. This 
means that the viewer can pause the playback while the DVR continues recording 
the live broadcast, and then continue the playback while the unit is recording. This 
allows for some other neat functions, such as the ability to skip commercials by 
tuning into a show 10 minutes after it starts and the ability to jump ahead when the 
commercials are played, eventually catching up to the live broadcast just as it ends. 
The DVR is finally becoming very popular, and adding this capability to an 
HTPC is an attractive option because the system already has most of the hardware 
necessary. It is largely a matter of selecting the best software to use for personal 
video recording. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Required Hardware 
There are a few points to note about hardware that an HTPC should have to 
function as a DVR. The capability to output video to a television or high -definition 
television has already been discussed, and as a core component of the HTPC it is 
necessarily included so that the DVR has a way to output video to the home 
theater. 
To get video into the DVR the HTPC may include either a television tuner card 
(or HDTV tuner card) or simply a video input. This choice affects the way the 
HTPC can be used as a DVR to record television or other video programs. With 
a television tuner card, the HTPC can be used to tune channels for recording, 
allowing for convenience when setting up a recording schedule or when channel 
surfing. In contrast, a simple video input also allows the DVR to record video, but it 
cannot select what channel is being recorded; it can only record what is being fed 
into it. The external video source may be configured to switch channels and 
programs automatically, but the DVR can only be set to record at scheduled times. 
For those interested in using the DVR like a conventional VCR (i.e., setting a 
recording schedule for later viewing), a television tuner card is more appropriate. 
If the primary purpose of the DVR is to pause live programs or replay segments of 
a live program, then a television tuner card is not necessary, since the HTPC can 
be connected to whatever video source is being watched. 
Hard Drive Requirements for the DVR 
Hard disk drive performance has a large bearing on the quality and performance 
of the DVR. A standard NTSC video is usually rendered on the computer at a 
resolution of 640x480 pixels (remember that the 525 lines specified by the NTSC 
standard are not all visible-only about 480 horizontal lines are actually used for 
the image) and at a color depth of 24 bits, which is required for true color repre-
sentation. This means that the video stream will be digitized to 27,648,000 bytes 
per second! Most hard disks will have trouble keeping up with this data rate. 
There are some ways to improve the hard disk performance. One way is 
to digitally compress the video before it is written to the hard disk. This helps 
because less information is written, so the disk performance is not as taxed. 
Compressing video takes a very fast PC, though, so unless the HTPC features a 
top-of-the-line CPU, it will not be able to compress the data fast enough to 
capture it at good quality. 
55 

Chapter2 
56 
TIP Since HDTV has a much higher resolution than NTSC television, 
recording it to a hard disk must be almost impossible, right? Actually, 
recording HDTV data to a hard disk is easier than recording standard 
NTSC video. The HDTV broadcast is already compressed to MPEG-2, and 
the compressed data stream can be recorded before it is decompressed for 
display. An HDTV broadcast at 1 OBOi quality actually uses less bandwidth 
than a standard television channel. 
Another way to improve performance is to scale down the picture size. Instead 
of capturing 640x480 video, the DVR can reduce each dimension by half and 
capture 320><240 video. This has the effect of reducing the data rate to one quarter 
of the full size rate. Unfortunately, this affects the quality of the video being 
captured. For some purposes it may not matter, but there may be some programs 
for which preserving maximum quality is essential. 
The most effective way to improve disk performance is to build a disk array 
called a striped volume or RAID 0. A RAID is a redundant array of inexpensive disks, 
and RAID 0 is the technical term for using two or more disk drives as one logical 
drive. The computer data is striped evenly between the disks, and since the 
computer can read and write to each drive at nearly its full performance, the 
performance of the logical volume is essentially doubled compared to using one 
hard disk drive. 
To build an HTPC with the ultimate performance, you should consider a disk 
array. Even a two-disk striped volume is fast enough to capture full-quality NTSC 
video without losing any data. Adding another disk drive to the HTPC does have 
some consequences, including higher costs and a louder system, but it cannot be 
matched for disk performance. Chapter 8 provides more details about this method 
of improving disk performance. 
Required Software 
The field of DVR software is a very new topic, but there are already some great 
choices available. Some DVR applications even allow you to record HDTV broad-
casts, which is otherwise impossible-there are no consumer devices available on 
the market to record HDTY. For more information about DVR applications, see 
Chapter 9 of this book. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
NOTE The consumer electronics industry is struggling with HDTV 
recording. It is a difficult issue because it would allow consumers to make 
perfect digital copies of high-quality television shows and movies in their 
home. Broadcasters are reluctant to allow this, and they are putting pres-
sure on manufacturers to find ways to protect digital content from 
unauthorized recording and distribution, which is causing the release of 
recording products to the marketplace to be delayed. 
Editing Video 
As we mentioned in Chapter 1, the HTPC is an excellent tool for importing analog 
(and thereby converting it to digital) and digital video. Once in the HTPC, you can 
edit the video using a number of software packages. The resulting edited video can 
look remarkably professional and you can even burn it onto DVD or Video CD to 
keep it forever. Several devices on the market allow you to import analog video at a 
low cost, and of course digital video cameras come complete with an IEEE 1394 
port (a Fire Wire port) that allows the camcorder to be connected directly to the PC 
(see Figure 2-6). FireWire is an extremely efficient communication channel, and it 
can handle the huge amount of information that must flow between the 
camcorder and the HTPC. 
Figure 2-6. Digital camcorders are a breeze to connect to a properly configured HTPC.

After you've placed the video on the hard drive of your HTPC, you can edit the 
resulting files into large or small clips and put them in any order you desire. You 
can add in multiple audio tracks, music, and even special digital effects such as 
ghosting and sepia tone. If you have a large enough hard drive on the HTPC, you 
can have these movies sit there and play them right off of the HTPC onto your 
home theater screen (whatever it may be) whenever you need a little nostalgia. 
See Chapter 11 for details on how to use your HTPC as a home movie (or business 
presentation) workshop. 
Viewing Slide Shows 
Storing a huge collection of images digitally on an HTPC makes a lot of sense. 
Digital images do not fade or lose color over the years, and gathering friends and 
family in the home theater room to view images on a large screen television can 
be more fun and intimate than passing around a photo album or a stack of prints. 
Just like with a music collection, digital pictures can be indexed and accessed very 
quickly on the HTPC, and the whole picture experience can be enhanced with 
background music. It is also easy to switch from home movies to pictures and 
back again, providing a rich multimedia display to document camping trips, 
graduations, and other life events-even just really good parties! 
Required Hardware 
Using an HTPC to show digital pictures on a television is pretty trivial if the HTPC 
is already connected to a display device. It is important to realize that still pictures, 
more than video, benefit from higher resolution displays. Connecting the HTPC to 
a high-definition television makes quite a difference in quality compared to a 
standard television. 
There are two main ways to get pictures into the HTPC: you can scan them 
from film prints by a picture scanner or you can take them with a digital camera 
and download them into the PC. A scanner is often the least expensive way to digi-
tize an existing collection of prints. Many people have photo albums and family 
pictures that go back for generations. Even low-cost flatbed color scanners are 
capable of digitizing pictures at a very high resolution and color quality. In fact, 
most consumer scanners can scan a picture at many times the resolution that can 
be reproduced even on a high-definition television. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Digital Cameras 
Digital cameras (see Figure 2-7) are more expensive than scanners, but they are 
becoming comparable in price to film cameras. Shooting pictures with a digital 
camera is very convenient and cheap-you don't have to wait until the pictures are 
developed to see how they turned out, and you don't have to pay for developing 
the pictures, either. Most people find that shooting with a digital camera motivates 
them to take many more pictures than they would with film, where each picture 
costs a little bit to develop. However, unless digital pictures are taken with a fairly 
high-resolution camera (which means a fairy expensive camera), they won't have 
as high a resolution as scanned film prints. This may not be a problem if you plan 
to only show the images in the home theater, but it is a problem if you want to 
make prints from the digital images. 
Figure 2-7. Digital cameras are fast becoming the default method to get pictures 
into digital format.

Required Software 
Several image viewing applications are available that can display digital images at 
full screen size, scaling small images up and large images down to fit the display. 
Good viewing software also allows you to jump from one picture to the next easily 
and without distraction. In this manner, you can show all the images in a collection 
in sequence without having to find each file in turn. You can configure automated 
slide shows to flip to the next picture at a specified interval, which makes a nice 
display while listening to music on the HTPC. 
For capturing and processing images, an image tool that allows rotation is 
essential. Images from a digital camera that are shot in portrait orientation-that 
is, the camera is rotated 90 degrees to make the image taller than it is wide-must 
be rotated after they are captured in the computer so that they display the right 
way up. Some image editing tools also provide neat picture filters that make the 
image look black-and-white, drawn with crayon, etched in metal, or painted with 
watercolor paint. With digital images, you can also add captions and speech 
bubbles to snapshots of friends and family. 
Videoconferencing 
The average quality of video streamed over the Internet is relatively poor when 
compared to the quality of standard television, but the entertainment value is 
arguably much higher. Even those fortunate enough to have access to broadband 
Internet connections still suffer low video resolutions, poor sound quality, and 
annoying glitches and delays. Putting this experience into a home theater seems 
pointless, but you must not underestimate the fun to be had with friends, kids, 
grandparents, and pets all trying to see each other in the home theater room! 
The home theater really is a great environment for videoconferencing with 
groups of people, since there is generally more room to sit and be comfortable 
than when the video conference is done in a spare room, office, or basement with 
everyone crowded around the computer monitor. And if broadband Internet 
access is not available in your area, you can still use the equipment to record 
messages and short videos to e-mail to your friends and family. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
Required Hardware 
In addition to the usual HTPC requirements of displaying on a television or large 
display device, videoconferencing requires a video camera of some sort. Generally, 
when people think of videoconferencing, they think of Webcams, small cameras 
that connect directly to a computer. These are suitable for videoconferencing on 
the Internet, since they usually support only the low resolutions that can be 
streamed back and forth. They are also small enough to be placed on top of the 
television, which is the ideal place from which to capture video, since everyone 
will be looking at the television. 
Camcorders and other analog consumer video cameras are also suitable for 
videoconferencing, but because they cannot connect directly to the HTPC, they 
must be connected to a video input port or video capture device attached to the 
system. Though the video quality may be too high to stream efficiently across 
the Internet, the HTPC can down-sample it to a more suitable data rate. The nice 
thing about using a camcorder is that you can use it for more than just videocon-
ferencing. 
TIP Using a camcorder as a video camera for videoconferencing may 
be inconvenient if the camera has a default time-out to shut itself off. 
Unless it is recording, a video camera may stop capturing video after a 
few minutes to save battery power. In this case, you may have to keep a 
"scratch" tape handy to record your sessions to keep the camera turned on. 
Unless the camera has a microphone built in, you will need to provide audio 
for the videoconference. This microphone may be connected to the microphone 
jack on the sound card. You should place the microphone away from speakers in 
the home theater room to prevent audio feedback. Also, many cheap microphones 
are only meant to be used at a close range-within a few feet-and are too weak to 
pick up sound from across a room. The specifications on the microphone's pack-
aging should indicate its effective range.

Required Software 
Videoconferencing software is not difficult to find or expensive to acquire; it is 
mostly free, in fact. Don't expect to get high-quality video streaming across the 
Internet, though, no matter what the cost. The limiting factor is the speed at which 
the HTPC can send and receive information on the Internet. A video image at 
320x240 pixels is quite good, even for broadband Internet subscribers. The video-
conferencing software should optionally scale the video up to the size of the 
screen, though the result may be very blocky or blurry. A better suggestion is to 
use one half of the screen for the received video and the other half to watch the 
video that is being sent. 
Instead of sending video and audio, some software allows people to connect 
with each other with only audio. Using the Internet to make phone calls, and 
especially to make long-distance phone calls, has become popular as Internet 
connection charges have dropped. It is cheaper to talk for hours on the Internet with 
someone in a different city than to make a long-distance phone call, and a broad-
band Internet connection is not even necessary. 
E-mailing and Web Browsing 
Using the HTPC for e-mail is very simple. It requires no special hardware or soft-
ware that would not normally be found on a conventional PC. The only advantage 
to using the HTPC for checking e-mail is the convenience of having it on a PC 
that is always nearby and usually turned on. Since there is not likely to be much 
privacy for reading or composing messages, it is a good idea to use the HTPC for a 
general e-mail account shared by members of the household. It is also a good idea 
to tum off any audible message warnings so that new e-mail doesn't play a loud 
ping or a "You have new mail!" greeting during a movie or television show. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
E-mail 
Many e-mail programs are integrated with scheduling and calendar software, 
which is another convenience that the HTPC can bring to the home theater. 
Having a daily schedule in the home theater room where it is conveniently acces-
sible is a great help, and having critical reminders and notes pop up on the screen 
can save embarrassment and problems for even the most absentminded. 
Web Browsers 
Web browsing on the HTPC is a great function for sharing Web site information 
with others in the room. The display is usually conveniently visible to other people 
in the home theater, and those people do not have to look over someone else's 
shoulder to see what it is that the person is trying to show them. Many Web sites 
feature entertaining animations and movies, which are also conveniently 
displayed with the HTPC. 
Using the HTPC for e-mail and Web browsing makes having a high-definition 
display very appealing. Standard televisions do not have enough resolution and 
cannot show enough detail to make reading text on the screen comfortable or 
easy. While image detail may be blurred without much notice, the display of large 
amounts of text demands a high-resolution television. 
Remote Controls 
In Chapter 7 of this book we discuss various remote controls for the HTPC and 
wireless keyboard and mouse features (see Figure 2-8). Generally, most features of 
the HTPC only require simple commands, such as play, stop, change volume, next 
picture, previous picture, next audio track, and so forth, which can be mapped to a 
button on a remote control unit. If the HTPC is to be used for e-mail and Web 
browsing, a wireless keyboard and mouse are essential for comfortable use of the 
system. It would be time-consuming and tedious to try to write an e-mail message 
with a simple remote control. Being constrained by a keyboard and mouse cord to 
within a few feet of the HTPC may not be convenient, either, if the HTPC is located 
right beside the large screen display. 
63

Playing Computer Games 
Most computer game enthusiasts are excited by the idea of playing their favorite 
titles on a big-screen HDT\T, and the HTPC can make that idea a reality. Any genre 
of computer game can be played on a high-definition television via the HTPC, but 
the most visually impressive games are the ones that use 3D graphics to create 
rich virtual environments. These can include sports games, first-person shooters, 
auto-racing games, and even 3D adventure games. All these types of games benefit 
from the larger display and more powerful sound available in the home theater. 
Required Hardware 
Computer games that use 3D graphics depend largely on video cards that enhance 
and accelerate such graphics. The development of 3D computer games has driven 
the graphics card industry forward relentlessly, and indeed many garners are 
serious enough about it to pay $500.00 or more for a top-performing video card. 
As we discuss in Chapter 4, not all video cards are equally suitable for use in 
an HTPC. A PC that will be outputting video to a high-definition television must 
have a video card that can be set to custom resolutions and refresh rates, and most 
3D video cards that are optimized for games concentrate on the standard PC 
display sizes. They also tend to favor high refresh rates, as this is desirable for 
computer monitors, but not for a high-definition television. The HTPC must sacri-
fice either game performance or video output performance, and most hobbyists 
prefer to sacrifice games in favor of DVD movies. 

Home Theater PC Uses 
High-performance 3D graphics cards also generate a lot of heat, which must 
be dissipated with fans inside the computer case. Fans make noise, and noise is 
undesirable for an HTPC, especially one that sits in a quiet home theater room. 
That is not to say that the HTPC is unusable for 3D video games, however. 
There are several good HTPC video cards that have acceptable 3D performance. 
Many computer game players will find the HTPC to be a great machine for 
computer games. Only the most hardcore 3D graphics fanatics will be unhappy 
with the trade-off of graphics quality for screen size. 
For the past few years, computer games have featured 3D sound to go along 
with the 3D graphics, but the sound standards are not all compatible with home 
theater 5.1 surround sound. To hear the surround sound effects from a computer 
game that uses a noncompatible 3D sound process, the computer must have a 
sound card that supports the game's sound and speakers connected to the sound 
card. Unless such a sound card also supports the Dolby Digital5.1 or DTS 5.1 
surround sound audio from a DVD movie, it is unsuitable for use in an HTPC. 
Thus, some players may lose some of the gaming experience when playing on an 
HTPC. 
As withe-mailing and Web browsing, a wireless keyboard and mouse are a 
great convenience when playing computer games on the HTPC. A wireless joystick 
is a nice game controller to have for flying games and flight simulators in the 
home theater. If a wireless keyboard and mouse are not available, the HTPC could 
be located closer to the seating positions in the room, or extensions for the 
connecting cables could be used. 
Required Software 
Playing computer games on an HTPC requires little extra software. Many 
computer games are published for the Windows family of operating systems. Such 
games generally require the DirectX software included with the operating system 
or available as a free upgrade for Windows. Games that use surround sound 
formats also need the software for the sound card installed to activate this feature. 
Instead of trying to accommodate a noncompatible surround sound format in a 
home theater, a game can be played in stereo sound, which diminishes the game's 
realism but accommodates its use with the existing sound system.

Summary 
This chapter outlined several uses for an HTPC in a home theater. Its capability 
to play DVD movies at a quality matching the best high -definition television 
makes the HTPC a great investment. Even when it's connected to a standard 
television, the HTPC can provide advantages that surpass the capabilities of a 
conventional DVD player. Personal video recording and audio jukebox functions 
are a wonderful convenience of the modern home theater, and combining them 
into one versatile unit makes sense. This is especially true when the ability to 
upgrade hardware and software is considered. The HTPC need never become 
antiquated or obsolete; as consumer electronics makers innovate new"must-
have" digital technologies, you can integrate them into the HTPC with relative 
ease. Because the HTPC is a fully functional computer, you can also use it for any 
task a computer is capable of, including word processing, video editing, and even 
chatting online. It is, in effect, the ideal home theater device. 
The next chapter covers audio specifications in the HTPC. 

CHAPTER 3 
Audio Specifications 
SoUND REPRODUCTION IS not normally the first thing most people consider when 
planning a home theater. What impresses most people about seeing a movie in a 
modem theater is the size and quality of the image. Few think about any other 
element of their experience, even if they notice the deep thumping of the low-
range sound effects or the shrill piercing of a terrified scream. Yet, without the 
soundtrack of a modem movie, the experience is much less involving. Movie 
makers spend a great deal of time and effort to make the soundtrack of a motion 
picture a high -quality, realistic reproduction of the sounds meant to accompany 
the picture. In order to achieve the ultimate home theater experience, this high-
quality soundtrack must be treated as a vital component of the home theater 
system. 
Sound reproduction is a complex topic. The audio formats for movies have 
changed and improved over the years, so the home theater enthusiast must 
understand the newest technologies and strive to stay current. Most home 
theaters are used for more than just watching movies, so audio formats for music 
and television also have a bearing on the configuration of the system. Additionally, 
the use of a home theater PC (HTPC) allows for the integration of even more audio 
sources such as CDs, a telephone, video conferencing, an intercom, and every-
thing else that you can imagine. 
Fortunately, the HTPC is a great way to converge different audio formats. 
From the newest DVD audio formats to your collection of vinyl LPs, the HTPC can 
record, store, and play back almost anything. The greatest thing about it is that the 
only limit to the size of the collection is the available hard disk space. 
Audio Terms and Techniques 
The most basic measure of a soundtrack is how many channels it has. Each 
channel is a separate audio signal. Early movies with audio (the first "talkies") had 
only a single channel of sound, which is referred to as mono sound. Eventually, 
multichannel sound tracks were added to movies to make the audience feel more 
involved with the movie by giving the events on the screen a location in the sound 
field. For example, if you are watching a movie scene with mono sound and a car 
approaches from offscreen, you cannot tell from which direction it is approaching. 
67 

Chapter3 
68 
If the movie scene has a multichannel soundtrack, you can tell if the car is 
approaching from the left, from the right, or even from behind you. Multichannel 
sound allows the cinema to create a sound field and immerses the audience more 
deeply into the action of the film. 
Though multichannel sound tracks with four sound channels have been 
common in movie theaters since the 1960s, most home theaters in the 1980s only 
had two-channel sound, which is referred to as stereo sound. This is because until 
recently, most music and television audio had, at most, stereo sound. Since the 
late 1980s, the number of channels has increased, mainly because consumer 
equipment capable of playing back multichannel soundtracks has improved and 
has become more affordable. 
The Digital Era 
The most important development in audio formats in the past 30 years is the 
switch to digital storage. Digital information can be converted to sound (and 
video) at a very high quality, and digital storage has become the standard for all 
recent and emerging consumer media such as CDs, DVDs, and computer media 
such as diskettes, hard drives, and CD-ROMs. 
Before digital storage, sound information was stored as an analog waveform 
on the media. Briefly, all sound is composed of vibration, which is transmitted by 
pressure waves through the air. A microphone has a diaphragm, usually a cone of 
paper or other light material that vibrates with the air movements and converts 
the vibration to an electrical signal. This signal is then recorded onto the storage 
media. To play back the sound, the process is reversed and a larger diaphragm (a 
speaker) is used to push more air around and make the sound louder. 
Digital storage adds a step to the analog process. After the sound is converted 
to an electrical signal, it is measured, and the measurements are stored on the 
media. The measuring process is called sampling and it is usually performed by a 
dedicated computer chip. In order to measure the analog signal, the chip has to be 
told how to sample it. There are two important measurements that affect the 
quality of the signal stored digitally: the sampling rate and the sampling resolu-
tion. The sampling rate determines how many times per second the measurement 
will be taken, and the sampling resolution states how finely the analog wave will be 
measured. The numbers that represent the values of each measurement are stored 
as bits (binary digits), 1s and Os, which, depending on the physical media, maybe 
represented by positive and negative magnetic fields, or by pits and bumps on an 
optical disc. 

Audio Specifications 
NOTE It is an oversimplification to state that bits are represented by pits 
and smooth sections on the compact disc media. Actually, each data bit is 
represented by several pits and lands, the name for a bumpy section. 
Further, it isn't the presence of a pit or land that represents a bit, but rather 
the transition from pit to land (or absence of that transition) that the laser 
detects as a bit. The bits on the surface of the disc are combined to make a 
data bit. 
Obviously, the higher the rate and resolution, the better the sound quality you 
can expect. Unfortunately, higher rates and resolutions also mean more digital 
information needs to be stored. In order to reproduce that analog wave perfectly, 
the digital sampling rate and resolution would have to be infinite, and there's no 
way to store that much information. Fortunately, sound engineers and human 
perception researchers have determined that most people cannot perceive the 
difference between sound sampled at an infinite rate and resolution, and sound 
sampled at merely a high rate and resolution. Though this topic continues to be 
controversial for experts in the digital audio industry, most home theater enthusi-
asts are satisfied with the current state-of-the-art in digital audio. (Though it 
should be noted that every time a newer, higher-quality format arrives, the former 
state-of-the-art suddenly seems inadequate!) 
Why Is Digital Storage Better Than Analog? 
First, the reproduction does not degrade as the media gets worn or ages. In the 
case of optical digital storage, such as a CD, the media itself is almost immune 
to the effects of aging, but even digital audiotape (DAT) allows for reliable, high-
quality playback. On magnetic media such as computer hard drives or audiotapes, 
the strength of the magnetic fields that store the information on the surface of the 
media deteriorates over time. If the media is exposed to a strong electro-magnetic 
field, the information is degraded further, and it can even be completely erased. If 
the signal stored on the media is analog, it will sound only as good as the strength 
of the remaining magnetic fields. With a digital signal, it doesn't matter how strong 
the magnetic fields are-if the media reader can tell what the bits are, it can repro-
duce the digital signal. Thus, an analog tape with 80 percent of its magnetic 
strength remaining will sound 80 percent as good as the day it was made, but a 
digital tape will sound exactly as good. Table 3-llists various media types and 
their life expectancies.

â¢ Information about life expectancy is difficult to find, and it's often vague or conflicting. Some 
CD-R manufacturers claim upward of 200 years of shelf life under ideal conditions, but who's 
going to own a CD player in the year 2203? 
NOTE A CD-R can degrade within a few years if it is labeled with an ink 
pen or a felt-tip pen. The ink in many permanent pens eventually leaks 
through the CD-R and will jill many of the pits and lands, rendering it 
useless. Using a proper CD label can prevent this early degradation. 
Another advantage of digital storage is that most media contain the digital 
signal plus some error-correction information. Even if a part of the media is 
destroyed, the original signal can be reconstructed. This is highly effective in 
counteracting the effects of scratches on CDs, though obviously it cannot 
re-create an entire soundtrack if half of the media is missing. 
Let's do some math: The format of an audio compact disc (CD) is defined by 
the Red Book, a specification for audio discs released by Sony and Philips in 1980. 
This specification defined digital audio sampled at 16-bit resolution and 44.1 KHz 
frequency ( 44,100 samples per second). This means that each second of audio on 
a CD uses 16 x 44,100 = 705,600 bits per second per channel. It is conventional to 
discuss storage capacity in terms of bytes, which are equal to 8 bits, so 705,600 bits 
per second divided by 8 is 88,200 bytes per second. Remember that a CD holds 
two audio tracks, the left and right stereo channels, so double the bytes per second 
to 176,400. The original Red Book specification allowed for 78 minutes per disc, 
which is 4,680 seconds (see Table 3-2). Thus, the data stored on an audio CD is 
176,400 x 4680 = 825,552,000 bytes. This number is only an illustration of the 
capacity of an audio CD, however, as there are extra bits for error correction and 
tracking. 

Audio Specifications 
NOTE Computer data on a data CD is not encoded in the same way as data 
is on an audio CD, so the capacities are not directly comparable. Since a 
data CD needs to store all the computer data very reliably, there is more 
error-correction information in each block.

Digital storage has one aspect that some people consider an advantage and 
others consider a major problem. When you copy an analog signal, you always 
lose some quality because the reproduction is never as good as the original 
performance. Each generation is successively worse than the preceding genera-
tion (a "copy of a copy of a copy" is not as good as a "copy of a copy"). Digital 
information, however, may be copied without any loss of quality for any number 
of successive generations. 
If you are in the business of making and selling digital recordings, this is 
obviously not welcome news. Uncontrolled copying and distribution of audio 
recordings on the Internet have prompted publishers to find ways to protect 
audio CDs from such copying. Various copy-protection schemes have been 
implemented on various types of digital media, with mixed success. Sometimes 
the copy protection affects the performance of the media, so publishers must 
tread a fine line between protecting their content from copying and allowing 
consumers to enjoy it. 
71 

Chapter3 
72 
Digital Compression 
A neat thing about digital signals is that they may be compressed to fit more infor-
mation into the storage space. In the digital world, there are two main types of 
compression: lossless and lossy. These terms mean pretty much what you might 
guess. Loss less compression reduces the size of the stored digital signal without 
losing any of the information. Lossy compression eliminates redundant and unno-
ticeable data to save space. For digital audio information, lossless compression 
doesn't help much, so digital audio engineers have concentrated on lossy 
compression techniques. Audio compression was researched and developed in 
the mid-to-late 1980s at the Fraunhofer Institut in Germany, but it only became 
popular with consumers in the mid-1990s when personal computers became 
powerful enough to decode highly compressed audio signals. 
Lossy audio compression depends on a psycho-acoustic model, which is a set 
of guidelines that tells engineers which sounds are not noticeable in a soundtrack. 
For example, if two sounds with nearly the same pitch occur simultaneously, or 
even almost simultaneously, then the softer sound can be eliminated without 
most people noticing. Audio compression is sort of like haggis: You feel better 
about it if you don't know what's in it! 
Though the actual compression process is very complicated, and different 
technologies with varying degrees of complexity and efficiency yield differing 
degrees of compression, most people cannot tell the difference between uncom-
pressed digital audio and audio that has been skillfully compressed. Technology 
has continued to progress, and the best coders today achieve the same sound 
quality that previously required double or quadruple the amount. This is what 
makes it possible to economically deliver 5.1 sound over satellite and cable televi-
sion systems, for example. 
An appreciation of these audio terms is helpful when you consider how to 
build a modem home theater and when you look back at how modem home 
theater audio technology has evolved in only a few short decades. 
A History of Home Theater Audio 
It may be argued that "home theater" has existed since the first days of motion 
pictures, as the wealthy only required a film projector in their house to have a 
home theater. Not many people could afford the cost or space for such equip-
ment, however. For our purposes, "home theater" means recreating the theater 
experience at home with equipment that is so affordable that the majority of 
people can do it. Thus, home theater really began when home videotape recording 
units hit the consumer market at a price the average person could afford. 

Audio Specifications 
From a confusing medley of earlyVCRs emerged the dominant videotape 
format: VHS. Though some of the major competitors to VHS actually had a higher 
quality of picture and sound, VHS exploited the balance of quality, cost, and 
marketing that appeals to the masses. Not everyone was happy about VHS's 
compromises (even to this day!), but there is no question that by the late 1980s 
VHS was the dominant home entertainment video format based on market share. 
Early VCRs could only record and play back a single, mono audio soundtrack. 
Stereo VCRs were introduced in the late 1970s, but they were not attractively 
priced until the mid-1980s, about the same time as stereo television broadcasts 
began. The quality of stereo sound on a VHS VCR tape is exactly comparable to 
stereo FM radio. Connecting a stereo sound VCR to your home audio system made 
a lot of sense, and for the first time people began to get enthusiastic about home 
theater. 
We must make special mention of one ofVHS's competing formats: Laserdisc. 
Though it carried an analog picture, Laserdisc did have the capability of carrying 
digital sound, and even the analog sound on a Laserdisc was better than VHS. As 
a physical medium, a Laserdisc is large (12 inches wide) and doesn't hold much 
capacity (a 2-hour movie could barely fit onto a double-sided disc), but since it is 
an optical disc format, it does not degrade with time or use. Though DVD has now 
made the Laserdisc obsolete, many people feel that the "serious" home theater of 
the 1980s was not complete without a Laserdisc player. 
Laserdisc and VHS battled for consumers' loyalty into the mid-1990s, but in 
1997 a new digital video disc format was introduced with picture and sound that 
clobbered everything that existed in the home theater. Originally named digital 
video disc, but later changed to digital versatile disc, DVD has a higher quality 
picture than VHS or Laserdisc, and it has the same high-quality digital audio 
capability as Laserdisc has had since 1995. 
Surround Sound 
By 1987, VHS players were available with the capability to play back a four-
channel DolbyÂ® Surround encoded soundtrack via its two-channel audio format. 
This was the first access most people had to a true movie theater experience in 
their home. Dolby Surround was originally available in VCRs in 1982, but with the 
introduction of Dolby Surround Pro LogicÂ®, a home theater could have as many 
audio channels as most movie theaters. To hear the Dolby Surround Pro Logic 
soundtrack on a VHS movie, the VCR must be connected to an external decoder, 
such as a Dolby Surround audio receiver, which became popular and affordable 
in the 1990s. 
Dolby, Pro Logic, and the double-D symbol are registered trademarks of Dolby Laboratories.

The four channels of sound were arranged to allow for the most realistic 
spatial effects in a motion picture. The traditional left and right channels provided 
great stereo sound for music accompanying the action, a center channel placed 
the sound of dialogue near the video screen where the people were speaking, and 
a single rear channel (usually connected to two rear speakers) filled in the room 
with offscreen sound effects, echoes, and reverberations. 
How Important Is Surround Sound? 
TWo speakers seems to be the optimal number for reproducing sound meant to 
be heard by a listener with two ears. Some sound experts contend that only two 
speakers are needed to re-create a complete sound field for audio recordings and 
for motion pictures. Why spend so much effort and expense to build an HTPC 
capable of outputting more sound channels than that? 
A human listener can perceive the direction from which sound arrives using 
many clues, noticeable and unnoticeable. The most important is by detecting the 
volume level and delay between hearing in the left and right ears. A sound wave 
from the right side will travel directly into the right ear, but only indirectly into the 
left ear, and so it is slightly softer in the left ear than in the right. The sound wave 
also arrives in the left ear slightly later. Though this delay is barely a few microsec-
onds long, it is enough to determine whether a noise came from the left or 
right-sounds that come directly from the left or right are the easiest to locate. 
This detection can even reveal if a sound is located to the front or back of the 
listener. Locating a sound to the front or back is more difficult, though. The ear is 
shaped to capture sound in front more clearly than in back, so only subtle audi-
tory clues about the clarity and sharpness of the sound can reveal its location 
ahead or behind. Similarly, noise above or below is slightly differentiated as it is 
blocked by the body and external parts of the ear, though most people find it very 
difficult to locate a sound coming from above or below them. Still, with only two 
ears, most people can tell from which direction sound is coming. If the soundtrack 

Audio Specifications 
from two speakers could re-create these audible location clues, it seems that 
the optimum surround sound arrangement would require only two speakers. 
The ability to detect sound coming from any direction is greatly affected by 
the environment into which the sound exits, and since enclosed rooms are about 
the worst place for distorting sound, extra speakers are needed to ensure proper 
perception of the sound field. Sound is reflected by flat objects such as walls, 
floors, and ceilings, which are usually the main structural features of a movie 
theater or a home theater. Reflected sound is perceived as a softer echo that 
reaches the listener within milliseconds of the primary sound, obscuring the audi-
tory clues that indicate its location. A room full of reflected sound is a confusing 
environment in which to listen to an audio track, since the clues about sound 
location are washed out in the cacophony. To understand this concept, just think 
about what it sounds like to sing in the shower, where hard tile floors and walls 
reflect noise so much that a voice seems to be amplified and filled in from all 
directions. 
Many movie theaters use fabric on the walls to dampen sound reflection, 
which helps to trap and disperse the echoes. Even with proper sound treatment, 
however, it is hopelessly difficult to eliminate all destructive sound reflection in 
a large movie theater or a small home theater. By adding extra speakers placed 
around the audience, the sound engineer hopes to overcome the remaining subtle 
reflected sounds with those from a stronger primary source. The audience still 
perceives the movie soundtrack with two ears, but the location clues in the sound-
track are controlled more precisely by using the surround speakers. 
Note that Dolby Surround Pro Logic is an analog format, decoded from the 
analog audio signal on the videotape. Though it was a huge step forward at the 
time, it did have some severe limits-for example, the inability to keep sounds 
from "leaking" across the channels. Since the rear channel was a single audio track 
played through two speakers, it could not do much to position sounds to the left 
or right behind the listener. For some home theater enthusiasts, the worst thing 
about Dolby Surround Pro Logic was the quality limits of the source content itself, 
often marked by annoying hissing and lack of dynamic range of the analog audio 
signal; the loudest and softest sounds were not separated enough, and if you 
turned it up to make it louder, you heard the hissing. Digital audio from Laserdisc 
set a remarkably high standard that even VHS hi-fi could only approximate. 
Surround Sound Becomes Digital 
In 1992, Dolby Laboratories introduced a new purely digital sound format to 
movie theaters, Dolby AC-3, which has since been renamed Dolby Digital 5.1. 
This new format had five discrete digital channels: left, right, center, left surround, 
and right surround, as shown in Figure 3-2. It also had a special sixth channel for 
75 

Chapter3 
76 
low frequency effects (LFE). Since the LFE channel was only used for low-pitch 
sounds, it needed much less information, so it was referred to as the ".1" channel. 
The first movie in theaters to use the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack was Batman 
Returns. 
Figure 3-2. The optimal location for speakers in a five-speaker surround sound 
environment. Each speaker is the same distance from the listener, and the left and 
right stereo speakers form an equilateral triangle with the listener. 
Dolby Digital 5.1 
The great thing about a digital surround sound format is that there is no sound 
leakage across audio channels. The analog surround formats always have some of 
the sound meant for one speaker coming through in the others. Discrete digital 
channels are not susceptible to this problem, however, as the digital decoder can 
send the correct information to the correct audio channel flawlessly. 
By 1995, Dolby Digital5.1 was available to the home theater enthusiast on 
new Laserdisc players. The Laserdisc format would have a short reign of glory, 
however, as DVD soon eclipsed Laserdisc in quality when it was introduced to the 
consumer market in 1997. Figure 3-3 shows the trademark denoting Dolby Digital 
sound encoding.

At first no one knew how well DVD would be accepted by the home user. 
Though DVD could match or beat Laserdisc in every audio specification, it was a 
new and unknown format with high player costs and little variety from which to 
choose. One aspect of the DVD that helped it to gain favor was that the discs are 
the same size as CDs-12 centimeters, or just under 5 inches-and this small size 
made them ideal for home computers and especially notebook computers. The 
convenience of having a high-quality movie player in a laptop appealed to many 
early adopters of the technology and helped propel it into the mainstream. It is 
ironic that this popular way of enjoying DVD movies doesn't even allow the viewer 
to experience the full digital surround sound, since most computers have only two 
(usually poor quality) speakers. But if you have headphones, Dolby has new tech-
nology, aptly called Dolby Headphone, which allows you to simulate the 5.1 
experience with just headphones. This is available in most PC DVD players. 
Digital Theater Systems 
While DTS was around before DVD hit the marketplace, it probably was not as 
well known in the home until it showed up on home DVDs. Digital Theater 
Systems (DTS) still uses lossy compression, but with less compression, so at a 
much higher bit rate. Whereas Dolby Digital compresses all the sound channels 
down to 384 Kbps or 448 Kbps, DTS only compresses down to 882 Kbps for 
movie theaters (using a different technology altogether) and 1,509 Kbps or more 
commonly 754 Kbps for DVDs. 
NOTE In order to fit the audio information onto a DVD loaded with 
extra scenes, multiple audio tracks, and other features, the quality and 
bit rate of the surround-sound audio track is sometimes reduced. For 
this reason, many movie purists prefer special DVD movie releases that 
remove the extras in favor of a high bit rate for the audio and video 
information stream. It turns out, however, that even lower bit rate sound 
tracks can be excellent, and the quality varies so much from disk to disk 
that no generalities can be stated accurately. 
77 

Chapter3 
78 
NOTE CD audio is a digital audio format with 16-bit resolution and 
sampled at 44.1 KHz, as specified by the Red Book standard. The Dolby 
Digital audio track from a DVD movie is sampled at 48KHz for slightly 
better quality. While all DVDs that include DTS support 48KHz playback, 
DTS can support up to 24-bit resolution at 96KHz sampling rate. 
The DTS surround-sound format uses a higher bit rate, but it also uses a 
different model to compress sound. Those home theater enthusiasts with sensitive 
ears swear that the DTS-encoded movies sound clearer and more natural than 
Dolby Digital soundtracks, but many others are hard-pressed to tell the difference. 
It appears that a well-encoded Dolby Digital audio track is just as good as a DTS 
track for most listeners. Figure 3-4 shows the trademark denoting a DTS-encoded 
soundtrack.

To some it appears that a well-encoded Dolby Digital audio track is just as 
good as a DTS track, but we feel subjectively that DTS has a slight edge. DTS 
movies are not as common as Dolby Digital movies, for various reasons, the 
primary one being that DTS is optional in the DVD format, whereas Dolby Digital 
is mandatory. Some DVD movies have both the Dolby Digital and DTS sound-
tracks on one disc, and some come in two different versions. To date, no movie 
has been released on DVD without a version with a Dolby Digital soundtrack. 
Still, if you have an amplifier that can decode DTS, and many can, it is worth 
keeping an eye out for DTS encoded DVDs. 
NOTE The Dolby Digital and DTS trademarks on a DVD movie only indi-
cate the digital sound encoding process. They do not promise that the 
soundtrack has full multichannel surround sound. Digital encoding 
can be applied to a mono audio track or a stereo track. 

Audio Specifications 
The newest development in the surround sound industry is the addition of yet 
another sound channel. As mentioned previously, the term "5.1 surround" applies 
to both Dolby Digital and DTS and means there are five main channels and one 
low-frequency effects channel. These soundtracks are often played back on a 5.1 
speaker system, but the signal feeding the subwoofer is not just the LFE channel, 
but optionally also the bass from the five main channels that is too deep for the 
satellite main speakers to reproduce properly. Bass management in the decoder 
takes care of all this. The five main speakers are arranged with one speaker in the 
center front, two speakers for left- and right-front stereo, and two surround 
speakers for left and right surround sounds. The surround speakers are supposed 
to be located beside and slightly behind the listening audience to provide ambi-
ence and sound effects. Both Dolby Laboratories and DTS have added a rear 
surround channel for sound effects placed behind the audience. Though the rear 
surround channel is a mono audio track, it may optionally be reproduced by two 
speakers: a right- and left-rear speaker. 
The Dolby rear surround channel has been added on top of the existing Dolby 
Digital5.1 specification by the use of matrix encoding. This means that a Dolby 
Digital 5.1 sound processor can properly decode and play a Dolby Digital EX 
soundtrack, though the rear surround channel will be heard equally from both 
surround speakers, a very similar experience to that of other 5.1 sound tracks. To 
hear the full Dolby Digital EX spatial effect, a new digital receiver capable of 
decoding it must be used with the extra back speakers. 
DTS has also created a sixth audio channel by deriving it from the left and right 
surround channels. The consumer name for this audio format is DTS-ES Matrix, 
where the term "matrix" is used to denote that the extra rear surround channel is 
made up from a matrix of the sounds in the left and right surround channels. 
However, DTS also has a "6.1" format with a digital rear channel, called DTS-ES 
Discrete 6.1. Proper playback for either of these new DTS formats also requires a 
new digital audio decoder. 
It is easy to see that consumer home theater audio follows what is happening 
in professional movie theaters. As more audio channels are added in theaters, new 
audio formats such as Extended Surround are introduced by manufacturers of 
audio receivers to appeal to those home theater enthusiasts who want to be on the 
cutting edge. These new formats are all based on digital encoding and are compat-
ible with previous digital formats, so a good digital audio receiver is an important 
79 

ChapterS 
80 
addition to any serious home theater. Thanks to the adoption of digital audio 
technologies, home theater enthusiasts can have real theater-quality sound, and 
the technology now seems to be available very soon after it hits the professional 
theaters. In order to re-create the optimal cinema experience, then, the HTPC 
should be capable of handling the digital audio data from DVD. 
Pure Audio 
The soundtrack from a movie isn't the only audio that the HTPC may be used for, 
and indeed for some people, it isn't even the most important use. The convergence 
of media onto the personal computer has been heralded for years, and now the 
results of convergence are yielding great advantages to those who choose to use 
a PC as an entertainment system. 
Since the PC is fundamentally a digital device, it is able to read, store, and 
play back almost every popular digital audio format. Audio CD is the most popular 
format for music (and other audio performances) today, but before CDs there 
were a variety of analog formats. Whereas the home computer is useless for 
playing vinyl LP records or audiocassettes, the HTPC can convert these old 
formats to digital information and bring the benefits of digital storage to a 
history of analog media. 
Predigital 
For those hi-fi enthusiasts who swe~ that vinyl LPs sound better than modern 
digital CDs, converting an LP to a digital format would seem to be heresy. But for 
those listeners with stacks of wax that have been collecting dust for the past few 
decades, such a conversion is a great way to get more life out of an unused record 
collection. The HTPC can record the audio from an LP record to a digital file, 
which can be saved in the HTPC or recorded onto a CD-R for playback in an audio 
CD player. Although the resulting sound will be only as good as the quality left on 
the LP record, it will never pick up any additional scratches, pops, or hissing, and 
it will not deteriorate with use. 
The sounds on an LP record can vary in pitch from about 7 Hz up to 25 KHz, 
though sounds in the higher frequencies are muted intentionally to keep the 
record player's stylus from jumping out of the record groove. For comparison, the 
Red Book CD audio standard specifies that audio CDs sample sounds at 44 KHz, 
so it appears at first that CD audio has a much better high-frequency response 
than an LP. However, with digital audio, the sample rate should be twice the audio 
frequency in order to accurately reproduce it, so the effective range of pitch for a 
CD only goes up to about 22 KHz. Thus, vinyl LPs can actually reproduce a higher 

pitch than a CD. The advantage for CD audio is that it has full dynamic range and 
frequency response up to its frequency limit. The high-pitch sounds on a vinyl LP 
are "rolled off," or muted, so most LP records will not lose any quality when digi-
tally sampled and stored at CD audio quality. Audiocassettes have a smaller range 
of pitch than LPs, and they drop off at high frequencies too, so converting these 
to a digital audio format using CD quality specifications is also quite effective. 
Table 3-3 lists the frequency ranges for common audio formats.

NOTE The upper range of hearing for most people is about 20KHz. 
Frequencies above this are inaudible, so no matter how well an LP or 
CD audio system can reproduce them, they are lost to the listener. 
The HTPC can do more than just convert LPs and cassettes-it can convert 
almost any audio source to digital audio. No matter what the source-reel-to-reel 
tapes, 78 rpm records, radio broadcasts, or even the audio portion of videotapes 
and video broadcasts-it can all be digitized. Though the Red Book audio CD 
specification specifies a bit rate and sample resolution that allows these digitized 
recordings to be put on an audio CD (the HTPC with a CD burner can create an 
audio CD from recordable media), the HTPC can digitize sound at lower or higher 
bit rates and resolutions if the source is lower or higher quality. 
TIP Most computers have a sound card inside that allows sound to be 
input and output. The sound card determines the maximum quality of 
digital sound that can be recorded and played back. As we discuss later, 
most common sound cards support the CD audio quality of 16-bit/44 KHz, 
but sound cards that support higher bit rates and resolutions are avail-
able. Recording at better-than-CD quality requires a better-than-average 
sound card in the HTPC.

Once you've converted these analog formats to digital computer files, you can 
store them on your computer's hard disk drive, archive them to CD-R or tape 
backup, or convert them to audio CD. 
Digital Convergence 
In the discussion earlier in this chapter about digital storage, we looked at CD 
audio and the Red Book specification. Almost every computer with the capability 
to play sounds is able to play at least CD-quality sound. Even the least expensive 
computer sound card supports at least 16-bit/ 44.1 KHz sound, and it has been 
almost a decade since less-capable sound cards were sold. Still, it is important to 
point out that the HTPC should include sound hardware capable at least of this 
standard. 
The playback capabilities of the HTPC are at least equal to a good CD audio 
player, but many people find that they listen to music played from CDs less and 
less. This is due to the convenience of storing digital audio files directly on the 
hard drive of a computer instead ofleaving them on a CD. Instead of hunting 
through a rack of CDs or digging through stacks of CDs in a drawer to find the 
music you want to listen to, you can play CD audio tracks directly from directories 
on your PC. This is even more convenient when you want to hear tracks from 
several different CDs during one session. Even a CD disc carousel cannot switch 
between tracks on different discs as quickly and easily as an HTPC with all the 
music stored on its hard drive. 
The convenience of using an HTPC for playing music depends greatly on the 
new digital compression techniques that have been developed in the past decade. 
It has become very popular to compress audio files using the lossy compression 
specified by the MPEG-1layer 3 protocol. This protocol is commonly known as 
MP3 compression, and it is similar to the compression described previously 
for DVD audio. Most listeners do not notice any sound degradation in MP3 
compressed audio, and since this compression can reduce the space needed 
to store the audio to less than 10 percent of the original space, it is a great way to 
store vast amounts of audio. 
For audio tracks that have been digitized from analog sources, MP3 compres-
sion is a good way to store the audio. Instead of lowering the sample rate or 
resolution, the audio can be sampled at the highest quality then compressed to 
fit into less space. For a given amount of space, MP3 compression of high-quality 
sound will yield better quality than lowering the sample rate. 
MP3 is not the only lossy audio compression method available for digital 
audio. Competing formats such as WMA, OGG, and RMA all use the same basic 
idea of psycho-acoustic modeling to remove unneeded information without 

Audio Specifications 
degrading the sound. The implementation of each method on a PC is known as a 
codec, a combination of t4e words "code" and "decode." Thus, to use computer 
files that store audio tracks compressed with the MP3 method of compression, 
the computer must have the MP3 codec installed. Likewise for those other 
formats. Later chapters cover these codecs in greater detail, but we must note 
that compressing and decompressing an audio track takes a lot of computer 
power, so the HTPC must be built around a modem computer, and the faster, 
the better. 
TIP It takes a lot more computer power to compress audio (and video) 
than to decompress it. An HTPC that will be used to record and compress 
a lot of audio data will be much more efficient and enjoyable if it is the 
fastest affordable computer available. 
New Audio Formats 
The future of digital audio is in dispute; its existence is guaranteed by its merits, 
but its format is uncertain. There is little doubt that the now-antiquated audio CD 
can be improved, and consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about digital 
audio and the limits of CDs. However, there are at least two competing formats 
fighting to provide the next generation of optical disc digital sound. We describe 
these formats in the sections that follow. 
Super Audio Compact Disc 
Super Audio CD (SACD) is based on the physical DVD optical disc format, which 
allows much more information to be stored on a disc than is allowed on a CD, 
since the pits can be smaller and closer together and the tracks are closer together. 
The SACD specification, called the Scarlet Book, allows for frequencies up to 100 
KHz to be accurately reproduced in each audio channel and can support two 
stereo channels or up to five surround channels and a low-frequency effects 
channel (5.1 surround sound, in other words). The SACD does not state the 
number of bits per sample, but it does specify a total sample rate of 2.822 MHz. 
The SACD disc can be manufactured with two layers, the DVD layer and a 
conventional CD layer, so that older CD audio players can still play the CD layer. 
Only new SACD players would be able to read and reproduce the higher-quality 
SACD soundtracks. 
83 

Chapter3 
84 
DVD-Audio 
DVD-Audio is based on both the physical DVD optical disc format and the DVD 
video format. This new specification allows for two audio channels (stereo sound) 
at 24-bit resolution and up to 192KHz sample rate, or 5.1 channel (surround 
sound) at 24-bit resolution and up to 96KHz sample rate. Obviously, this sound 
quality is much higher than CD audio. 
NOTE The two new digital audio formats, SACD and DVD-Audio, do not 
use the same method of sampling sound to convert it to digital informa-
tion. DVD-Audio uses the traditional method that CD audio uses called 
pulse code modulation (PCM), whereas SACD uses direct stream digital 
(DSD) encoding. The SACD specification seems better technically, but both 
formats are expected to produce about the same quality of sound. Needless 
to say, they are not compatible. 
DVD-Audio allows for images, lyrics, and other text notes to be stored on the 
disc, while SACD does not. Presumably, the players for these new discs will allow 
the listener to access this information while enjoying the performance. Both new 
formats are also heavily copy-protected. 
Although the new formats are incompatible, the players are compatible with 
existing CD audio media. Also, they both strive to exploit the surround sound 
speakers and audio channels that home theater enthusiasts are using for movie 
sound tracks. This makes setting up a theater at home more appealing since it can 
have multiple uses. This also makes having an HTPC at the heart of your media 
center more appealing as the ultimate convergence of all digital media. 
It is worth mentioning that virtually all DVD-Audio discs include compatible 
material, usually the entire album, in 5.1 Dolby Digital, so that they can be played 
on any existing DVD video system. So it is possible to build a library of DVD-Audio 
discs, enjoying superb surround sound, and then step up to a DVD-Audio player in 
future to extract even more features and higher sound quality from the same discs. 
SACD allows the option to include a Red Book CD layer, making the discs compat-
ible with regular CD players, but not many discs do this so far. 
The HTPC Sound System 
Few home theater or audio experts think that their newest CD player, DVD player, 
digital receiver, or video recorder will be the last one they'll ever need to buy. The 

Audio Specifications 
consumer electronics industry couldn't last long if it didn't constantly innovate 
new technologies to sell to enthusiasts hungry for the latest and greatest equip-
ment. Deciding to be a home theater lover is deciding to constantly spend money, 
it seems. This sobering realization discourages current enthusiasts and keeps 
many out of the hobby altogether. 
The HTPC is a great way to mitigate the high cost of constantly upgrading 
home theater equipment. When a new sound format appears, it is often accom-
modated simply by adding new software to the system, and at most by upgrading 
one or two components, instead of replacing the entire HTPC. For example, 
buying a DVD video player for a home theater costs more than buying a DVD-ROM 
drive for a PC, because the player needs to include a case, power supply, video 
decoder chipsets, and other subsystems that a DVD-ROM drive doesn't include. 
By letting the HTPC handle the housing, power, and decoding, the DVD-ROM 
drive is a much simpler (and less expensive) device. When new DVD drive tech-
nology is available, only this drive needs to be replaced. 
The HTPC is ready for the future, but since the specifications for future tech-
nologies are obviously unavailable, let's look at what high-quality sound systems 
should be included in to day's system. The most basic thing to know is that sound 
in a PC is usually handled by a component called a sound card. In some 
computers, the microchips and sound processors are not located on a separate 
card; rather, they are part of the main board (motherboard). Either way is fine, as 
long as the sound components meet the quality desired. 
Meeting Specifications 
Since the DVD-Audio specification states that the highest quality sound will have 
24-bit resolution at 192KHz, the ideal sound card for an HTPC will be able to 
reproduce sound at this quality. This is an unusually high specification-it is more 
common to find high-end sound cards that support 24-bit resolution at 96KHz 
sample rate. As discussed earlier in this chapter, this is the highest quality for DVD 
video and the quality specified for 5.1 channel DVD-Audio. 
An acceptable alternative to the finest quality sound card when cost is a 
limiting factor is to build an HTPC to the CD audio specification. This means a 
sound card capable of processing 16-bit resolution at 44KHz sample rate. Using 
such a sound card will cause the HTPC to down-sample the audio when 
outputting the digital surround soundtrack from a DVD movie. For sound cards 
without a digital audio port, the digital surround sound will be completely inac-
cessible, though the analog Dolby Pro Logic surround sound audio will still be 
available. This sound card will also play CD audio at its full quality, but newer 
digital audio formats will either be down-sampled or not played at all.

TIP Most DVD movies that have a digitalS.l soundtrack also have a 
stereo soundtrack. Software to play DVD movies on an HTPC will also 
convert the digitalS.l soundtrack to an analog stereo track with Dolby 
Surround sound encoding. Either way, it is still possible to hear the sound-
track for a DVD movie without a digital sound decoder or a sound card 
capable of passing the digital soundtrack to an external decoder. 
Using an External Digital Decoder 
The way an HTPC is connected to the rest of the home theater system can deter-
mine the quality of the sound it reproduces. For the highest quality DVD 
audio-the digital surround soundtrack-the audio information is read from the 
disc and sent to an external digital receiver, where it is decoded and sent to the 
appropriate speaker. The HTPC handles the process by reading the DVD in its 
DVD-ROM (or DVD-RAM) drive. The software that plays DVD movies separates 
the digital audio information and outputs it through a digital interface to the 
external decoder. 
5/PDIF Digital Audio Connector 
One type of digital interface is a Sony and Philips Digital Interconnect Format 
(S/PDIF) port, which is usually found on the sound card. This is a pretty straight-
forward connection-a coaxial cable connects from the digital output (the S/PDIF 
port) on the computer to the digital input on the digital receiver. However, not all 
S/PDIF ports are created equally! Some sound cards actually down-sample the 
digital signal to process it internally at a lower rate and then up-sample it to 
output it through the digital connection. Further, some sound cards with S/PDIF 
ports use a proprietary voltage level, so they are not even compatible with stan-
dard external decoders. You should be aware of the internal processing of the 
sound card you choose for your system. We discuss some popular brands and 
models in Chapter 5. 

Audio Specifications 
Toslink Optical Digital Audio Connector 
Another digital interface that sends sound information to an external decoder is 
the digital optical port, known as the Toslink port. This is basically the same as the 
S/PDIF port, but instead of sending voltages through a metal wire, it sends infor-
mation as pulses of light through a fiber-optic cable. This may be confusing for 
some who are new to the digital audio hobby-this optical link is sending audio 
information. 
I 
TIP The SIPDIF port and the Toslink port send exactly the same digital 
information to the sound decoder. There is no difference in quality, because 
it is the same digital signal that is processed by the decoder. The only 
advantage to using an optical cable is that it is immune to the effects 
of electrical interference and cross-talk. If the SIPDIF cable is properly 
shielded, the resulting sound quality should be completely indistinguish-
able from an optical audio link. 
Some sound cards can decode digital surround sound tracks and send the 
audio channels to speakers connected directly to the HTPC. In this case, an 
external digital receiver I decoder is not needed. Since a new decoder is not neces-
sary when a new sound format is available, it does save money and adds some 
convenience. However, most home theater enthusiasts prefer to use an external 
digital decoder because it includes an amplifier and can drive speakers with more 
power and volume than a sound card with powered speakers. 
Analog Connections for Â«Digital Sound ReadyÂ» Receivers 
Some early surround sound audio receivers had an input for each of the five 
surround sound channels. The receivers were marketed as "Digital Ready" or 
"Surround Sound Ready." Many early DVD players could decode the digital audio 
track and output each channel through an analog connection to the compatible 
audio receiver. This saved the cost of having to buy an audio receiver with a digital 
sound decoder, though the DVD player needed one, so the cost was not always 
less. One advantage of these "Digital Ready" receivers is that they are great for use 
with any new type of audio source that outputs analog sound information, such as 
MiniDisc players or the new DVD-Audio formats.

Creating an HTPC for High-Quality Sound 
The quality of the sound produced by the HTPC depends on the quality of the 
sound card and the correct configuration ofha,rdware and software in the system. 
This chapter has explained some concepts that are important to achieving high-
quality sound reproduction. Hopefully it is clear that the HTPC is capable of 
creating the highest quality sound for movie soundtracks and other audio sources. 
By including an HTPC in the home theater, the enthusiast does not have to 
acquire separate components dedicated to the various audio forms. 
An HTPC can also do more than just play the soundtrack from audio and 
video sources-it can record, store, and play back sound from a variety of analog 
and digital media. With enough disk space, the HTPC can be the home jukebox 
that aggregates the entire collection of LP records, audiocassettes, audio COs, and 
other formats into a conveniently accessible location. Advances in the past decade 
for digital sampling and digital compression techniques make it possible to fit 
more sound into an HTPC than anyone could have imagined before the digital 
revolution. 
An HTPC has the potential to reproduce sound at the highest standards 
possible for the home theater enthusiast, or at any level deemed an appropriate 
balance between cost and quality. Where cost is a factor, the sound card in an 
HTPC can be economized until money (or motivation) is available. The great 
thing about this is that upgrading the sound quality does not require replacing 
the whole system, just the sound card. No off-the-shelf consumer component 
cando that! 
Perhaps the most impressive use for the HTPC is still its uncompromising 
video and audio playback quality for DVD movies in the home theater. Though 
many people consider the visual part of the movie experience most impressive, 
the audio capabilities of the HTPC help to create the magical movie experience 
desired in the home theater. 
Summary 
This chapter explained how the HTPC can be used very effectively to reproduce 
the highest quality sound using the latest and greatest technology and standards. 
In the next chapter, we discuss the realm of video cards. This area is absolutely 
critical to many aspects of the HTPC (for obvious reasons), so it's important that 
you make the right decisions around which video card to employ in your HTPC.

CHAPTER 4 
Home Theater 
PC Video Cards 
THIS CHAPTER DISCUSSES the subject of video cards in the HTPC. Specifically, we 
discuss how video cards affect the quality of the viewing experience, what to look 
for in a card, and the primary features that are available in contemporary video 
cards. We'll look at the best card for your needs, be they gaming related, for video 
editing, or just for enjoying DVDs through your HTPC. 
There are two main ways to connect an HTPC to a display device, the choice 
of which has a major bearing on which video card is best suited for the system. In 
turn, the manner in which the HTPC is connected to the display device is largely 
dependent on the display device itself. Since the display is potentially the most 
expensive part of the home theater, it is best to start assembling the HTPC after 
the display device has been acquired, or at least decided upon. 
The Video Connection 
The first way to connect the HTPC to a home theater display is through a standard 
S-video or composite video cable. This is suitable for virtually all television sets 
and most front projection display systems. Most televisions manufactured in the 
past several years have a composite video input, and those sets of sufficient size 
and quality for home theater use usually have at least one S-video input. These are 
the same inputs used for connectingVCRs, camcorders, DVD players, or any other 
typical video source. 
NOTE Many modem televisions have four, five, or even six video inputs, 
giving the user the ultimate in flexibility. As an example, Sony's XBR WEGA 
32-inch HDTV television has seven inputs: two component, two coaxial, 
and three composite. 
91 

Chapter4 
92 
Composite 
In order to use the composite or S-video connection, the HTPC must have a 
video card with an S-video or composite video output connector. JYpically, PC 
video cards do not have such outputs, so finding a suitable video card can be chal-
lenging. Often the selection of appropriate video hardware is limited, and finding 
one card that meets all of the desired requirements of performance, memory, and 
software may be impossible. Fortunately, with the rise of digital media conver-
gence has come a great range of video cards with stunning performance and the 
necessary video output connector. 
Figure 4-1. These are examples of composite RCA jacks and S-video cables. 
Connecting the HTPC to a television with an S-video or composite connector 
limits the quality of the video image to the NTSC standard, since these connec-
tions were developed to work with regular television displays. There is a difference 
in quality between S-video and composite connections, however. The video signal 
is composed of brightness and color information. The composite connector sends 
video information to the set through one wire. The display device must separate 
the two signals before it can display a picture. The S-video connection sends the 
two signals separately on two wires, so the television does not have to process 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
the video signal as much, and the result is a better picture with truer color and 
sharpness than the composite signal. If the home theater display can accept an 
S-video signal, it is preferable to select a video card that can outputS-video 
instead of composite video. 
Component 
The second way to connect the HTPC to a home theater display is through 
component video cables. This method is suited to high-definition television 
displays, since the component cables can carry the HD1V video signal required 
for the high quality and resolution of HD1V displays. A component video cable 
is three separate cables with RCA-type jacks at each end, and though almost any 
cables with such jacks can carry component video information, most home 
theater enthusiasts prefer to use cables with a heavy gauge and shielding to 
protect against signal degradation. It is important to note that the component 
video signal is not digital-it suffers the same susceptibility to interference as 
S-video or composite video. In fact, given that the component cables carry much 
more information in high-definition modes than the NTSC formats, they are even 
more susceptible to electromagnetic interference. 
Figure 4-2. These jacks are examples of component cables. 
93 

Chapter4 
94 
All high-definition display devices have component inputs for use with high-
definition video sources, but very few PC video cards have component outputs. 
However, the VGA connector sends a signal that can be converted for use with the 
component video cables needed for high-definition television display. To convert 
from VGA to component requires a transcoder, which some call a break-out box or 
simply a VGA-to-component converter. These small devices have a VGA input on 
one side and a component output on the other. The video signal is passed through 
the transcoder to the HDTV without any internal processing, so the PC controls 
the resolution and refresh rate of the video displayed on the HDTY. It is important 
to note that HDTV displays can only accept a few different resolutions and refresh 
rates, so setting up the HTPC to output through a transcoder is not an easy task. 
(At least, not an easy task without this guidebook!) 
I 
TIP Many people are surprised to learn that the VGA connection between 
the PC and monitor sends an analog-not a digital-video signal. This is 
the key reason why a transcoder can convert the VGA signal to a compo-
nent video signal without a lot of expensive processors or electronics. 
Though transcoders are notoriously expensive, this is because of the rela-
tively low demand for them, not their complexity. 
If you are going to use the HTPC in a home theater with a high-definition 
display that can accept a component video signal, then you do not really need a 
video card with a composite or S-video output. Some video card manufacturers 
are starting to offer video hardware that can output component video, but there 
are some issues with these new cards that you should consider before you decide 
how the HTPC will output to the display. The topic of video output is explored in 
more detail later in this chapter. 
Some television sets, and many front projection systems, have another type 
of video connector known as RGBIN. This is an analog video connection format 
similar to the RGB format of a computerVGA connector, and it is compatible with 
VGA output when a special cable is used to convert the VGA plug to the multiple 
coaxial connectors. Since RGBHV sends the video signal along separate wires, it is 
capable of sending very high-quality video-as good as or better than the video 
that component cables are capable of producing. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
Video Card Features 
After you've determined the method of connecting the video signal from the HTPC 
to the display, you have other video card features to consider. Home computer 
hobbyists generally regard the performance of a video card as the most critical 
issue, and the HTPC enthusiast should also consider this factor. Almost every 
video card made in the past few years is fast enough to play back DVD movies, 
but if you're going to use the HTPC for playing computer games, then good DVD 
playback may not be sufficient justification to choose a particular card. A few 
premium, full-featured video cards can capture video from analog or digital inputs 
and tune television channels from cable sources. The video hardware in an HTPC 
is one of the most critical subsystems, so careful selection is an important step. 
Hardware Video Assistance 
In the early days of DVD movies on a computer, the system processor and video 
card were barely fast enough to decode the MPEG-2 video stream from the DVD 
disc and display it on the computer monitor. To make DVD movies smoother and 
enable full-screen playback, extra hardware was dedicated to decoding and 
displaying the video. This extra hardware was usually a separate computer adapter 
card, but in some cases it was an add-on or daughterboard for the video card. 
Modem PCs are capable of decoding the MPEG-2 video stream and displaying 
the video full-screen without a hardware decoder, but most decent video cards still 
have some hardware features to assist in DVD playback. These features are no 
longer added on with a daughterboard but are instead included right in the video 
card processor itself. Features such as deinterlacing, motion compensation, and 
filtering all improve the picture quality of DVD video without adding an extra load 
on the system processor. Some premium video cards such as the NVIDIA 
GeForce4 MX have an MPEG-2 decoder built into the video hardware so that the 
system CPU is relieved of much of the work involved in showing DVD video. 
Gaming 
The most visually stunning computer games on the market today require a video 
card with excellent 3D rendering capability. The virtual worlds into which the 
player is drawn are realistic, detailed, and smoothly animated environments that 
look more and more like real life with each new generation of games. The relation-
ship between PC game software and video hardware is intimate and dynamic-
new features are introduced by hardware vendors that are almost immediately 
95 

Chapter4 
96 
exploited by the game makers, so it is difficult (and expensive!) to stay on the 
cutting edge of video hardware. The best 3D video card on the market last year 
is only a midrange performer this year, so the HTPC hobbyist who hopes to play 
"Medal of Honor" or "Doom III" on the big screen in the home theater must find 
a video card with the features and performance to match those games. 
There are, of course, countless PC games that will look great and perform 
splendidly on any average video card currently available, so the HTPC without 
a top-notch 3D video card is not wholly useless for gaming. Many garners enjoy 
older 3D games, strategic titles, or even just playing solitaire. Those hobbyists 
with kids to please should keep in mind that most children's games do not require 
expensive systems, and the entertainment value is increased when the kids get to 
play on a big-screen display. 
The definitive advantage to using an HTPC as a gaming machine is that no 
other hardware can output the high picture quality of an HTPC connected to a 
high-definition display device. Since the HTPC can display a picture at resolutions 
up to 1080i (or whatever limit the television can handle), it can take full advantage 
of the quality of the home theater system to improve the gaming experience. Even 
if you do not intend to play PC games on your HTPC, you may feel tempted just to 
see how it feels to score a goal, win a race, or shoot an alien in a darkened room 
with a big-screen display and full surround sound pulling you into the experience. 
Capturing Video 
A video card that has an input for capturing video from analog sources is a very 
convenient way to digitize old home movies from VHS, a Hi-8 camcorder, or any 
other analog source into your HTPC for editing and storage. There are a few video 
cards available that can accept an analog video input in the form of either a 
composite video signal or an S-video signal. Though the current trend in camcorders 
is digital, many people have older analog recordings in formats that are incompatible 
with digital camcorders. An analog video input adds versatility to the HTPC system. 
The video input feature of a video card is not a critical feature for most hobby-
ists. Considering that most HTPC computers will include a television tuner, an 
analog video input on the video card may be redundant. Since the television tuner 
card will almost certainly have a composite and an S-video input (in addition to 
the coaxial cable inputs), having a video card that can accept analog video is not 
worth considering for most HTPCs. However, if a television tuner is not part of the 
plan for the HTPC system, the video input feature on the video card may be a 
worthwhile addition. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
Digital video is usually sent to a PC through a digital input known as an IEEE 
1394 port (see Figure 4-3). The IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers, an organization that creates standards for many different electronic 
components and devices. IEEE 1394 is called Fire Wire by Apple Computer and 
i.UNK by Sony. Some video cards feature an IEEE 1394 port, as do some sound 
cards, and increasingly more and more motherboards. For this reason, it is not 
usually necessary to get a video card with such a digital input, unless it is to be 
used in an HTPC that has no other IEEE 1394 port. 
Figure 4-3. Digital camcorder with an IEEE 1394 cable ready to plug into an HTPC

NOTE The Fire Wire connection to a digital video camera carries both audio 
and video information, which makes it a very convenient way to import 
high-quality digital information from a camcorder.

98 
Tuning Television 
Many hobbyists considering an HTPC will want to include the ability to tune tele-
vision stations from analog cable or over-the-air sources. This chapter includes a 
detailed examination of the available hardware later on, but we should mention 
one category of television tuner during this examination of video cards. There is a 
popular line of video cards from ATI called "All-In-Wonder" that feature a tuner 
built into the card. This combination video card and television tuner has some 
interesting benefits and drawbacks worth discussing. 
Combining the video card and tuner into one card can save space in a 
cramped HTPC case. Most enthusiasts will want to find an inconspicuous PC case 
for their HTPC, so size and interior room can be a big issue. Further, this combina-
tion can potentially save some cost since a separate television tuner is not needed. 
Perhaps the best advantage is the fact that there will be no compatibility issues 
between the video card and television tuner, since they are a single unit from one 
manufacturer. 
Broadcast television is about to undergo a huge transformation in the coming 
years as digital channels start to multiply, and this leads to a major drawback to 
using a combination video card and television tuner: To change the tuner, the 
video card must also be changed. An HTPC is a great machine because it is versa-
tile and upgradeable, so it is a weighty decision to combine two features inside the 
system when one of those features is likely to be swapped out during the lifetime 
of the machine. 
Fan Noise 
Some PC hobbyists that are new to the HTPC topic may be surprised to learn 
that one of the most important issues for an HTPC system is the noise it makes. 
A PC sitting in an office or den may seem quiet when you are surfing the Web or 
playing "Dungeon Siege," but put that PC into a home theater room during the 
quiet suspense of a horror movie or the soft atmosphere of a love story and the fan 
noise will drive you mad. We discuss this topic in more depth in Chapter 8, but it is 
worth addressing during this discussion of video cards. 
Most of the new high-performance 3D graphics processors run very fast and 
generate a lot of heat. Almost all video cards with competent 3D performance 
have a heat -sink fan attached to the processor, and this fan can be quite large in 
some cases. Generally, the faster the graphics processor, the better the video 
performance, but the bigger and louder the fan required to dissipate all the heat 
generated. Most HTPC enthusiasts forego cutting-edge 3D processor performance 
in favor of a video card with good DVD playback capabilities and medium-to-low 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
heat generation. Some people even prefer older versions of video cards from 
previous years when heat-sink fans were not necessary. 
If the noise of a small fan spinning inside the case of the HTPC doesn't seem 
unduly distracting, consider the fact that most cooling fans have a lifespan of only 
a few years. Anyone who has listened to a dying fan for a while can testify about 
the annoying sound it makes as it slows down, speeds up, and grinds out its bear-
ings. Also, an HTPC that is set up to record programs, report alarms, or play 
reminders is necessarily turned on most of the time. Even when no video image is 
displayed, the video card cooling fan will still be spinning its life away. A video 
card that does not require a cooling fan could save a lot of aggravation and main-
tenance. 
There are some novel and extreme ways to cool an HTPC without increasing 
fan noise that might be worth considering for home theater rooms that must be as 
quiet as possible. Water cooling kits are available to cool the CPU, video card, and 
hard drives inside a computer case. These kits include heat sinks for the major 
heat -generating components, tubing to circulate the water or other coolant, and a 
nearly silent pump. Kits that include a refrigeration system are also available, but 
if the refrigeration compressor motor is not located in a separate room, it will 
make more noise than a fan. Some special cases with extra ventilation and some 
special modifications to standard cases are also available. 
Drivers 
You can save quite a bit of frustration if you research the quality of drivers and 
support for the video card before you make a final selection. Each video hardware 
manufacturer provides the software that makes the video card work with an 
operating system, and every video hardware manufacturer has its strengths and 
weaknesses in supporting these drivers. Experienced PC hobbyists often have 
favorite manufacturers or brands, but using a video card in an HTPC adds some 
points to consider that don't apply to conventional PCs. We detail these extra 
considerations in the sections that follow. 
Resolution 
Most video card drivers allow the user to select a display resolution. The resolution 
is the measure of the number of pixels horizontally and vertically on the display 
screen. The display screen always stays the same size, but the size of the pixels 
changes. 
99 

Chapter4 
100 
NOTE Actually, you can configure some LCD displays so that when you 
change the resolution, the size of the display area shrinks. The resulting 
image appears as a smaller window inside the display, around which the 
screen is blank. The reason for this is that the pixels in an LCD display do 
not scale well because of the very sharp screen resolution. This is the same 
reason that all LCD displays have a native resolution at which the picture 
looks best. 
Common resolutions for computer displays are as follows: 
â¢ 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels tall 
â¢ 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall 
â¢ 1024 pixels wide by 768 pixels tall 
â¢ 1280 pixels wide by 1024 pixels tall 
â¢ 1600 pixels wide by 1200 pixels tall 
This list does not include all of the possible resolutions for display on a 
computer screen, but it does illustrate some limitations that have an important 
bearing on an HTPC. The resolutions are all fixed at an aspect ratio of 4:3-that is, 
they are all multiples of 4 units wide by 3 units tall. This is the aspect ratio of stan-
dard television sets (NTSC or PAL), but high-definition sets allow a 16:9 aspect 
ratio, and many DVDs are even wider. Some computer monitors support 16:9 reso-
lutions, such as the new Apple Power Book and the new Apple Cinema HD Display, 
but the majority of personal computers are used with 4:3 displays, and the video 
software reflects it. 
The other limitation shown in the preceding list is that there is no matching 
resolution for all of the digital high-definition television standards. Remember 
that HD1V can support 480p, 540p, 720p, and 1080i. These numbers would corre-
spond to the number of pixels measured vertically up and down the display. The 
only match is at 640 x 480. This resolution is no higher than any off-the-shelf DVD 
player, so limiting the HTPC to this display measurement negates much of its 
display advantages. 
Since the video card drivers do not support desirable aspect ratios and resolu-
tions, the HTPC requires additional software to run the video card at the correct 
resolution for a high-definition display. The most popular utility for doing this is 
called PowerStrip, and Chapter 10 provides more detailed information about using 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
it, but it is important to note at this point that PowerStrip is compatible with a 
finite list of video cards. Fortunately, must popular cards are supported, but it is 
wise to check the list before you select a card for an HTPC that will be used to 
drive a high-definition display. The PowerStrip software comes with documenta-
tion that lists all supported video cards and chipsets. 
NOTE The ATI Radeon 8500 has HDTV resolutions built into the system 
when you purchase the add-on dongle (DVI-to-component connector) so 
you do not have to use Powerstrip. 
Video Card Quirks 
Researching information about video cards is essential to avoid problems when 
configuring the HTPC system. Some video cards have annoying quirks and bugs 
that aren't readily apparent from the manufacturer's literature. It is helpful to 
consult other sources of information (such as this book!) to find out all the dirty 
secrets of video hardware. For some suggestions about where to start looking, 
there is a list of (mostly online) information sources in the Appendix. 
One quirk that we've found occurs with the drivers for ATI Radeon video cards. 
The HDTV resolution of 1080i is an interlaced video mode, but the ATI drivers do 
not allow an interlaced mode above 640 x 480. This isn't surprising, since few 
manufacturers do, and it's not a problem thanks to PowerStrip, which can set an 
interlaced mode of 1920 x 1080. Unfortunately, when you play video at this resolu-
tion, the picture is stretched to double the height of the display area so that only 
the top half of the video is visible. 
There is no remedy for this situation except to drop the display settings to 
1920 x 540 and set the refresh frequency to 60Hz progressive. As we discuss in 
Chapter 10, this mode is equivalent to the 1080i mode and should work for most 
HDTV displays. 
Another example of a video card quirk occurs in the NVIDIAline of video hard-
ware based on the GeForce graphics processor. Although the GeForce is widely 
regarded as a premier gaming video card, it does not perform as well as the ATI 
Radeon line of video cards with regard to video quality from DVD movies. The 
Radeon video cards are (in our opinion) smoother and have better color than the 
GeForce-based video cards. This illustrates an important consideration when 
assembling an HTPC: Should it be optimized for gaming or for DVD playback? 
There is no right answer except to follow your own preference.

Video Output 
Since outputting images to the display device is one of the most crucial tasks for 
the HTPC, a review of the major issues to consider for each method is important. 
As mentioned earlier, the home theater is often built around the display-a front 
projection system, a rear projection television, a large-screen direct-view televi-
sion, or whatever display device is appropriate or cost -effective-so the method 
of connecting the HTPC to the display will depend on the features of the display. 
Fortunately, since the HTPC is such an adaptable machine, it is not difficult to 
build it to suit a number of different output methods. 
Component Video 
The recent introduction oflarge-screen televisions and high-definition televisions 
brought with it a new way to connect video sources to these advanced quality 
displays. Composite and S-video cables are engineered to carry the video signal 
for conventional NTSC- or PAL-quality sources, but they are not suitable for 
anything better (and, some argue, they are not even suitable for the best quality 
NTSC or PAL). A new connection was introduced to carry the higher quality 
images. The standard is published by the Consumer Electronics Association 
(CEA) and is known as EIA/CEA-770, though it is commonly referred to as 
component video. 
The component video standard is actually a three-part specification: The 
first part, EIA/CEA-770.1, is for normal NTSC broadcast television and compatible 
video sources. The second part, EIA/CEA-770.2, is for standard-definition video 
sources that can output a 480i or 480p video. The third part, EIA/CEA-770.3, is for 
high-definition video at 720p or 1080i resolution. It is important to note that this 
component video standard is for analog video. Even though the standard-defini-
tion and high-definition video is digitally stored and transmitted, it is sent to the 
display device as an analog signal through the component video cables. 
Component video separates the video signal into three lines. The first is the 
brightness information, called luminance, that essentially carries a black-and-
white version of the video. The other two lines carry color information, or 
chrominance, in different color ranges; one is for yellow-red, and the other is for 
yellow-blue. All three lines are required to re-create the full-color video from the 
source. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards

TIP Although the component video connection is defined as an industry 
standard, it is anything but that. The output line levels and the input 
levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer so that each display device 
or output source must be tuned and calibrated to reproduce the video 
picture as close to the original quality as possible. This is one of the reasons 
why the HTPC is so versatile-no other device allows as much control over 
the output levels of color and contrast. 
The display device with component video inputs must sense the video format 
being input, since component cables can carry everything from standard NTSC 
video of about 480i up to the best HDTV resolution of 1 080i, and anything in 
between. In most cases, a video display device will support a few modes in the 
HDTV specification. Commonly, 480i, 480p, 540p, and 1080i are compatible with 
any high-definition television, and 720p and the derived 1440i modes are less 
frequently supported. Since the HTPC configured with the PowerStrip software 
allows for extreme fine-tuning in a huge range of resolutions and frequencies, at 
least one compatible high-resolution mode can be found. Determining the correct 
settings for the video card to output a compatible video signal for the display 
device is one of the key challenges of configuring the HTPC. 
Trans coders 
To connect the HTPC to the component inputs of an HDTV-compatible display 
device, the computerVGA output must be converted to the three-line component 
input. The VGA signal is an analog video signal composed ofluminance, chromi-
nance, and timing signals that can be converted to component output through the 
use of a transcoder. The transcoder passes the video signal through without modi-
fying the resolution or frequency, so the HTPC video card must be configured to 
output the proper resolution and refresh rate for the high-definition television. 
Due to the specialized purpose ofVGA-to-component transcoders, they are 
relatively rare and expensive. The only ones we could find were from Key Digital 
Systems (see Figure 4-4), Audio Authority, and RCA. They all have the same basic 
size and configuration: a small external device with a VGA input on one side, a 
three-line component output on another side, and a power socket for the power 
cord. Some models (the Key Digital Systems ones, for example) have a small knob 
for centering the picture, but this adds little value as the picture size, shape, and 
position can all be adjusted in the PowerStrip software. They also are all the same 
basic price, which may be regarded as expensive for a relatively simple device, 
though not astronomically so.

Figure 4-4. The Key Digital Systems VGA-to-component adaptor 
A transcoder is essentially an adapter that gives your television a VGA port, 
but some televisions have a VGA port built right in. You should take care when 
considering a display device with a VGA-type connector. Unless the television or 
projector is made to work as a computer display device, it may support only one 
VGA mode: 640 x 480 interlaced. Though convenient, it pretty much negates any 
picture quality advantage of higher resolution modes. 
I 
TIP A VGA connector is more correctly referred to as a DB-15 RGB 
connector. The term "VGA" is only relevant in the context of computer 
displays. Such a connector on a television or home theater projector will 
likely not be labeled VGA. 
The need for a transcoder makes the HTPC system a little more complex. 
Without it, the system is limited to outputting video at standard NTSC quality. 
Those HTPC hobbyists fortunate enough to have a high-definition device will 
probably find the advantages of using the transcoder outweigh the disadvantages 
of its cost and configuration challenges. The one great advantage to using the 
transcoder is that you can use any video card that outputs via a VGA connector. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
CAUTION There are many products available that convert common PC 
display resolutions for use on any television. These devices actually down-
convert all screen resolutions to the NTSC standard 480i in order to work 
on a television. This is not what a VGA-to-component transcoder does! The 
transcoder passes the video resolution and timing signal straight through 
to the display. The HTPC hobbyist should be aware that the device needed 
for use with an HDTV-compatible display is a transcoder and not a 
converter. 
Pure Digital Video Is Scarce 
A few high-definition television sets and display devices have digital video inputs 
in the form of an IEEE 1394 digital connector. CEA published the specification 
EIA/CEA-775 for sending video signals over the IEEE 1394 digital wire. For televi-
sions equipped with the proper IEEE 1394 connector, pure digital video can be 
sent to the display with absolutely no analog conversion until the last step when 
the picture is drawn on the screen. 
Unfortunately, the industry does not seem to be picking up this "standard" 
very quickly. Though IEEE 1394 is fast enough for NTSC and other lower-res 
digital formats, it is not quite able to support the full quality of high-definition 
television, so already newer formats have been introduced to compete with this 
format. Very few display devices are available that accept a digital IEEE 1394 
connection. Although it is a popular format for transferring digital audio and 
video from camcorders to computers, it is not widely adopted for televisions. 
There are a few other digital formats that allow a connection from a video source 
to a display device-DVI and LVDS, for example. These formats are also not widely 
available on display devices large enough for use in a home theater environment. 
The best solution for high-definition video from an HTPC is to use the analog 
format of component video, or for compatible front projection systems, an 
RGBHV converter cable. 
Component Video Output from the Video Card 
The need for a transcoder to use an HTPC with an HDTV has led some manufac-
turers to consider adding component outputs to their VGA cards. ATI announced 
an upgrade for their Ali-In-Wonder Radeon 8500 and 9700 that will allow the 
output of digital television formats of 480i, 480p, 540p, 720p, 1080i, and 1440i. 
It is supposed to be ready by the end of 2002. NVIDIA have also announced 
component outputs as part of their Video Performance Engine (VPE) feature 
for the GeForce4. 
105 

Chapter4 
106 
Unfortunately, because of pressure from the media-publishing industry, the 
ATI video card will not play DVD or other copy-protected material at a resolution 
above 480p. The NVIDIA GeForce4 MX will also respect the 480p limit for DVD 
playback. For those HTPC hobbyists with high-definition displays, this handicaps 
the capability of the HTPC to scale up a video to make use of the full resolution of 
the display. Many hobbyists in the HTPC community have voiced their frustration 
to the DVD publishers and to hardware manufacturers, but vendors can hardly be 
blamed for adhering to the contractual restrictions of the DVD consortium. In 
order to obey the requirements for Macrovision protection encoded into DVD 
video media, DVD playback is limited to 480p, and this restriction limits the value 
of any video card with component video outputs. 
5-Video 
For display devices that lack component video inputs, the S-video connection is 
the best choice for connecting the HTPC. Most large displays manufactured in the 
last decade or so have at least one S-video input, so it is widely compatible with 
television sets, rear projection televisions, and projection displays. S-video is 
therefore also popular on many video sources such as VCRs, DVD players, and 
camcorders. 
S-video is used only for standard NTSC- or PAL-format video; it does not 
support any high -definition modes or even any progressive video modes. It is a 
little like component video because the luminance and chrominance signals are 
transmitted over separate lines, but there are only two wires instead of three, and 
they are wrapped into one cable. The difference in picture quality between 
component video and S-video is barely noticeable at the NTSC standard of 480i-
it takes a very sensitive and well-trained viewer to notice any difference at all. 
The HTPC that outputs S-video must have the appropriate connector on the 
video card in order to connect to the display device. This means that your choice 
of video cards for the HTPC is limited when your system must output to an 
S-video-capable display. There are external converters available that convert the 
VGA output of any video card to a standard NTSC signal via an S-video connector, 
but the cost of S-video-capable video cards is so low that such an external device 
is almost never worth the money. 
It is worth mentioning that S-video has one or two advantages over the quality 
of component video. The software drivers that make the S-video output work with 
the HTPC often allow the system to be configured to use the VGA output at the 
same time as the S-video output. This allows you to connect a computer monitor 
in addition to the home theater display. You can use the monitor to set up the 
system and to select functionality while video images are sent to the main display. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
The monitor is also easier to read than the relatively blurry television screen, so it 
makes using the HTPC a little easier. 
The other advantage of building an HTPC with an S-video output is that you 
can use it on almost any display, anywhere. Many hobbyists use their HTPC 
systems for presentations, as portable gaming systems, or occasionally at a friend's 
house. For those who will be using their system in multiple locations, adding an 
S-video output makes the HTPC almost infinitely compatible. 
Composite Video 
S-video and component video are actually both types of "component" video-
they carry a video signal separated into multiple components that must be recom-
bined by the display device. Composite video is named as such because it carries a 
composite of the luminance and chrominance signals along one wire. The display 
device must actually separate these two signals (they are transmitted along the 
wire at different frequencies) before recombining them to form the picture. 
This means that some picture quality is always lost using composite video 
because the parts of the video signal interfere with each other slightly and can 
never be perfectly separated. A video picture coming from a source connected 
via composite video looks less well focused (less sharp) and has color that lacks 
the saturation and purity of an S-video or component video signal. Although it is 
difficult to see the difference between S-video and component video signals, 
comparing either to composite video reveals noticeable degradation. 
Composite video is, however, easily the most popular format for connecting 
video sources to display devices. Composite video comes in the form of a single 
cable with standard RCA-type connectors that are usually colored yellow to indi-
cate that they are for video or from a coaxial cable used to transmit all of the 
channels from most cable television providers in North American cities. 
Composite video output is included with virtually every video card that 
outputs S-video. Many video cards with the capability to output an NTSC video 
signal have only an S-video connector but come with an adapter to convert the 
S-video to composite. 
NOTE The S-video to composite video adapter that comes with many 
S-video-capable video cards does not work with just any S-video source; it 
only works with computer video cards. The computer must be configured 
to output a composite video signal so that luminance and chrominance 
are sent at different frequencies. 
107 

Chapter4 
108 
There are a number of great video cards with S-video and composite output 
connectors that are also perfectly suitable for use with a VGA-to-component 
transcoder. It is not necessary to sacrifice any DVD playback performance or 
gaming features in order to get a video card with an S-video connector. Even if 
you do not anticipate using your HTPC by connecting to an S-video display, you 
should consider finding such a video card in order to get the flexibility and 
compatibility such a connection offers. Many of the cutting-edge, full-featured 
multimedia video cards have composite and S-video connections even though 
they are primarily selected by HTPC enthusiasts for use in high-definition televi-
sion display home theater systems. 
Television Tuners 
In the past, watching television on a PC has mostly been a novelty, but with the 
growing popularity of the HTPC, adding television to a computer seems like a 
natural step. Television tuner cards are a great way to add television channels to 
the PC desktop, but since the cost of an actual television is relatively low, it hasn't 
always made sense. Even a small television sitting beside a computer is more prac-
tical than a tiny window on the screen that's continuously being hidden by other 
applications. But the HTPC is a computer that's dedicated to being a media source 
in the home theater, and adding television channels to its DVD video and digital 
audio repertoire is a great way to increase its value. Lately, high-definition televi-
sion tuner cards have become available, so an HTPC that can display high-quality 
DVD playback on a high-definition television can be made even more impressive 
by adding a high-definition television tuner card. 
HDTV 
Most major television markets in the United States now have a few digital televi-
sion stations being broadcast over the air. As the deadline for conversion to digital 
broadcast looms closer, the number of digital television broadcasts will increase, 
so investing in HDTV hardware is becoming less of a risk. Though the price of 
HDTV equipment is still very high, in the future it is expected to drop to levels 
comparable to standard NTSC television equipment today. 
HDTV can arrive in your home in a number of ways. Several stations broad-
cast HDTV signals over the air, which requires an antenna for proper reception. 
HDTV reception is not like the fuzzy, ghosted images that plague NTSC reception 
today. Since HDTV is a digital signal with error detection and correction, it is 
possible to get a "perfect" picture and perfect sound even if the signal strength is 
only moderate. A set-top decoder or HDTV set with a built-in decoder is necessary 
to watch an HDTV broadcast. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
Direct broadcast satellite systems in both the United States and Canada have 
a few high -definition channels in their lineups. These require special satellite 
receivers to decode the channels and output them to an HDTV-ready television 
set. The built-in decoder of an HDTV set is not useable with DBS systems, so the 
set must have component video inputs as almost all of the high -definition 
receivers output using these connections. 
Finally, some cable systems are starting to include high-definition channels. 
Like the digital satellite systems, a high-definition receiver that connects to the 
cable is required, and it attaches to the component inputs of the HDTV-ready 
display. 
NOTE Most high-definition receivers for over-the-air broadcast, digital 
satellite systems, or digital cable services can output HDTV channels to 
standard NTSC televisions by down-converting the video to 480i. This 
makes it possible to watch the high-definition channels without buying an 
expensive HDTV television, but most of the picture quality is lost when it is 
converted down to the lower resolution ofNTSC. 
HDTV Tuner Cards 
An HDTV tuner card for the computer can be a cheaper way to receive HDTV 
channels. These tuner cards are only able to receive over-the-air broadcasts from 
an antenna; they cannot receive HDTV channels from digital satellite systems or 
digital cable services. Since a computer monitor is a high-quality display device, 
watching HDTV on a computer screen is actually a very good way to view such 
programming. The only problem is that most computer screens are not large 
enough for a roomful of viewers-unless the computer screen happens to be a 
high-definition television connected to an HTPC. 
In fact, due to broadcasters' fears about consumers making high-quality 
copies of high -definition programs, there is currently no recording device that can 
capture HDTY. Though some products have been announced, and most early 
adopters of the high -definition technology are getting frustrated waiting for high-
definition equipment and programming, there is little on the horizon for the 
high-definition marketplace until copyright issues are resolved. The only excep-
tion to this is to use an HTPC to receive, decode, and record high-definition 
programming broadcast over the air. This capability is sparking a lot of excitement 
in the HTPC community for those enthusiasts with access to over-the-air HDTV 
channels. 
109 

Chapter4 
llO 
For those with access to HD'IV channels from a digital satellite service or 
digital cable service, there isn't much good news about getting those channels to 
work through the HTPC. The only method for outputting the HD'IV video picture 
at its highest quality is through the component video connections, and there are 
no television tuner cards or other computer hardware devices that can accept 
component video inputs. The digital satellite or cable receiver normally has an 
S-video output that can be connected to the input of the television tuner card (or 
the video card, in some cases), but this connection only carries the high-definition 
channel down-converted to NTSC quality. The HD'IV industry is still too young 
and evolving for a wide range of compatible hardware to exist. Ideally, it would 
be great if the HTPC could accept an analog HD'IV video signal via component 
inputs, or a digital signal via IEEE 1394, but low consumer demand and broad-
casters' copyright fears seem to be delaying the introduction of such 
conveniences. 
TIP Every HDTV tuner card is also an NTSC television tuner card. That is, 
HDTV tuner cards are all able to tune standard television channels, too. 
This means that the HTPC only needs one television tuner card. It makes 
sense to add an HDTV tuner card to an HTPC that is in a region where 
digital channels are either available or soon to be available over the air. 
NTSC Television 
Adding a television tuning card to an HTPC to access standard NTSC channels 
is relatively inexpensive. Television tuner cards are surprisingly common (how 
many people really want to watch television in a small window in the corner of 
their computer screen, anyway?), and since the technology for receiving television 
signals has existed for so long it is pretty well refined, reliable, and cheap. Televi-
sion tuner cards are so inexpensive that hobbyists building an HTPC should 
seriously consider adding one even if they don't think they want to use the system 
for television. 
Common Television Tuner Features 
Television tuner cards all seem to have composite and S-video inputs, and some 
have left and right channel stereo inputs also. This means that the television tuner 
card provides the HTPC with the capability to capture video from other sources 
besides broadcast television. Video from camcorders without a digital IEEE 1394 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
connection is not easily imported to the computer, but with a television tuner card 
the HTPC can capture this video and store it as digital video. 
In home theaters that feature digital satellite service or a digital cable box, the 
television tuner card can accept analog video from these sources. This is a great 
convenience since all of the video programming that is shown in the home theater 
can be routed through the HTPC. The advantage is that the television only has to 
be connected to one device. All of the video can also be recorded by the HTPC and 
scaled up to whatever resolution the television can handle. This does not actually 
improve the picture quality of standard television channels, but when everything 
is displayed at the same resolution it is easy to jump between DVD, television, 
VCR, and home movies. 
The software that runs modern television tuner cards is very full-featured. 
Television tuner cards have coaxial cable inputs so you can connect them to either 
an antenna or a conventional analog cable service. With all those channels, it can 
be difficult to find a desired program, or even to find something interesting to 
watch. The software can be programmed to monitor the closed captioning for 
keywords and then either switch to the channel where the keyword was found or 
start recording the program. Built-in intelligence like this makes the era of the VCR 
seem like the Dark Ages! The software also lets you watch television channels in a 
window on the desktop or makes the television channel take up the whole screen. 
Some software packages can even replace the desktop wallpaper with the televi-
sion display. Most software packages also support common features such as 
recording video or capturing single frames from the video program, scanning 
channels by displaying a screen filled with thumbnail still images, and timed 
recording. 
Television Tuners and Digital Satellite 
or Digital Cable Service 
Unfortunately, there are some things that television tuner cards will never do. 
These limits are more a result of security and copyright issues than of hardware 
limitations, and they may have some bearing on the way you configure your HTPC 
(or even whether you desire an HTPC at all). The television tuner card will never 
be able to receive and decode digital satellite or digital cable television channels. 
These broadcast channels are encrypted with security features so that unautho-
rized receivers cannot decode and display the video signal. Allowing a computer 
component access to these signals would compromise the security. Though it 
would be convenient to be able to watch digital television from satellite or cable 
without needing the external receiver to change channels, it is almost completely 
unlikely to ever happen.

The HTPC Project Hardware 
For this book, we're assembling two HTPC systems. One system will be a high-
end machine, and the other will be low-end, though both will be well within the 
confines of a reasonable budget. After all, if we had an unlimited amount of 
money for our HTPC system, we wouldn't need to build a machine to take the place 
of far more expensive equipment! Chapter 8 provides a full list of all the hardware 
in each machine, but it is helpful to note here that the first HTPC system will have 
an AMD Athlon PR2100+ processor and the second will have a Pentium III 450 
processor. Neither of these CPUs is cutting edge-in fact, they're both old PCs that 
were available for the project-but they're both fast enough to build an HTPC 
system around. This helps to illustrate an important point about getting into the 
HTPC hobby: It isn't necessary to spend a lot of money to build a great home 
theater media machine. 
HTPC System 1 
Since the basis for selecting a video card is the home theater display, this is where 
we'll start the discussion. The first HTPC system we're building is going to be used 
with a rear projection, HD1V-ready television. This display has two sets of compo-
nent inputs that can accept HDTV resolutions up to 1080i, and this is how the 
HTPC will be connected. Although this display has S-video and composite inputs, 
using the component inputs will allow us to scale all video up to the high-definition 
resolution that we want to use. 
The ATI Ali-In-Wonder Radeon series of video cards are widely regarded as the 
premiere video hardware for DVD playback. The color saturation and adjustments 
available through the video card drivers are excellent, and the bundled software is 
full-featured and easy to use. The All-In-Wonder line of video cards also features 
television tuners, video inputs for video capture, and S/PDIF digital audio output 
for DVD playback. 
With this in mind, we approached ATI for their recommendations on a video 
card for our HTPC project. ATI generously supplied an ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 
7500 for our first HTPC system. This card sports all of the features of the All-In-
Wonder series, plus a radio frequency remote control. Though it includes an 
S-video output, we are not planning to connect it to the S-video input of the 
display, but we are planning to use the video input to capture video from a 
camcorder and VCR. This video card also has a digital audio output, though it is 
only useful for outputting the audio from DVD playback. The fast processor, 64MB 
of memory, and very capable 3D graphics processing power of this card will make 
it a great addition to our high-end HTPC. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
One point to note about the ATI Radeon 7500 series of video cards (see 
Figure 4-5) is that they have a small cooling fan on the video chip. The ATI Radeon 
7200 video card has no fan, and though it is not available in an Ail-In-Wonder 
package, it is suitable for HTPC systems that are connected to high-definition 
displays through a VGA-to-component transcoder. The cooling fan on the ATI 
Radeon 7500 is barely audible, but for those HTPC hobbyists with very sensitive 
ears, the ATI Radeon 7200 is worth considering. 
Figure 4-5. The ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 supplied by ATI for this project 
The great thing about theATIAll-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 is that the price is 
very reasonable for a full-featured multimedia video card. ATI also manufactures 
an All-In-Wonder Radeon 8500DV with a faster video chip, better 3D graphics 
processor, and an IEEE 1394 digital video input for transferring video from a 
digital camcorder. Though the 8500 is the top-of-the-line offering from ATI suit-
able for an HTPC, it also has a top-of-the-line price tag. However, since it fulfills 
many roles (video card, television tuner card, IEEE 1394 video input, and digital 
audio output), it may be very attractive for those HTPC hobbyists in need ofits full 
set offeatures. 
Keeping in mind that this video card will be used to output HDTV resolutions 
through a transcoder, we checked the PowerStrip release notes file to make sure 
113 

Chapter4 
114 
that the ATI 7500 video chipset is supported by this software. PowerStrip is the 
only way to set the video card output resolution and refresh rate to the HDTV-
compatible modes, since the Windows drivers that come with the hardware do not 
support these modes. 
We also acquired a VGA-to-component transcoder to connect the VGA output 
of the video card to the component inputs of the display. There are only a few 
brands from which to choose, so we picked the Audio Authority model 9A60 
(see Figure 4-6). As mentioned previously in this chapter, a transcoder is a pretty 
simple-looking device. The model9A60 is a small white box with a VGA input at 
one end and the three RCA-type connectors for component video output at the other 
end, plus a power cord. All of the resolution and frequency is set by the computer's 
video card and passed through to the high-definition television. The transcoder was 
supplied with a VGA cable, and we supplied our own shielded component video 
cable.

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
TIP We looked and looked, but we could not find a VGA-to-component 
video transcoder at any local retail computer stores, electronics stores, 
specialized electronics stores, computer wholesalers, flea markets, pet 
stores, or even in the classified ads. It seems that the only way to get one is 
to order it from a Web site. Keep this in mind as you plan your HTPC 
system: One of the key items may take 4-6 weeks to arrive! 
HTPC System 2 
The display we are using for our second HTPC system is a 32-inch direct-view 
picture tube television. This set happens to be an HDTV-ready television, but we 
are not going to build our second HTPC to use any high-definition resolutions. 
This system will be connected with an S-video cable to the display. PowerStrip will 
not be needed on this system, but the transcoder from the first system will still 
allow us to compare the picture quality of the S-video to the component video, as 
the component video inputs on the television will accept an NTSC (480i) video 
signal. 
Since we are not going to build the second HTPC with a transcoder, we need a 
video card that has an S-video output. This presented a significant challenge, as 
we wanted to use the NVIDIA GeForce4 MX chipset, which is offered by several 
video card manufacturers (NVIDIA do not manufacture their own video cards-
they just design the chipset and license it to other hardware vendors), but not all 
of them include an S-video output on the card. We were eventually able to find an 
adaptor with the required video output connection. 
The GeForce4 MX video card includes the VPE feature that NVIDIA. VPE is 
essentially an MPEG-2 decoder built into the video card processor. This is meant 
to save the main system processor a lot of work to decode the MPEG-2 video 
stream from the DVD or other digital video source. This is one of the main features 
that made us eager to try this video card in one of our HTPC systems. The 
GeForce4 is also a top-notch 3D gaming card, though we did not purchase the 
fastest version of this video card since we are mainly focused on multimedia 
performance and not solely gaming performance. 
The GeForce4 MX does not have many of the other features of the ATI video 
card that we are using in our first HTPC system, though it is priced quite a bit 
lower, so for our purposes it is a good choice. The GeForce4 MX has no video 
input, no digital audio output, and no remote controller, so we will be adding 
these features with additional hardware. 
115 

Chapter4 
116 
Figure 4-7. The GeForce4 MX 440 video card used in our second HTPC system 
The first HTPC system that we're assembling has a television tuner built into 
the video card, but this second one doesn't. For this reason, we're adding a televi-
sion tuner adapter card to the system in order to get television stations from 
over-the-air and cable broadcasts. We were very interested to try out the newest 
HDTV tuner cards, so we asked around to a few manufacturers to see what they 
recommended, and Hauppauge sent us theirWmTV-HD hardware (see Figure 4-8). 
This card has all the features of a regular NTSC television tuner card (coaxial cable 
input, S-video and composite video inputs, and great software), plus it has a 
connector for a digital HDTV antenna. Keep in mind that this second HTPC 
system is meant for S-video output, which won't be able to display HDTV at its 
proper high resolution, so we'll have to borrow the VGA-to-component transcoder 
from the first system or connect a PC monitor to see the high-definition modes 
that this HDTV tuner card can decode. 

Home Theater PC Video Cards 
Figure 4-8. The Hauppauge WinTV-HD HDTV tuner card used in 
our second HTPC system 
Neither of the video cards selected for our HTPC systems is expensive, and 
neither is a top-of-the-line model. The reason for this is indicative of the state of 
the video card market: A lot of effort is spent to develop and market the best 3D 
gaming video card, and not much attention is paid to multimedia functions such 
as DVD playback. Though this seems unfair to the growing HTPC hobbyist 
community, it is actually an advantage to us. While the game players are spending 
top dollar to be at the cutting edge, those who simply want great digital video 
performance have a wide range of medium- and low-cost video cards from which 
to choose. Though features that improve computer games are not necessarily the 
same features desired in a HTPC video card, the general performance improve-
ments are a benefit. Additionally, the inclusion of hardware features to improve 
MPEG video playback indicates that the manufacturers are starting to realize that 
the HTPC has a big future in the home theater. 
With the video card selections for our two HTPC systems made, we can move 
on to the issues surrounding audio performance and sound cards.

Summary 
The video card is perhaps the most critical component of your HTPC. With the 
proper card you can ensure that the HTPC will be the master of DVD playback, 
home video editing, and even cutting-edge gaming. Still, there are some trade-
offs, and currently there are choices to be made between all-inclusive packages 
(ATI Radeon 7500/8500) and hot gaming video cards (NVIDIA's cards). In the next 
chapter, we look specifically at audio cards and explore what to look for in your 
HTPC's audio setup.

How TO BEST bring the miracle of sound into the home is a contentious and hotly 
debated subject. For some audio purists, nothing less than thousands of dollars 
worth of vacuum tubes and power supplies is sufficient to reproduce sound with 
acceptable quality. Entire books have been written on this subject-indeed, indus-
tries have been created and lifetimes have been spent in search of the ultimate 
electronics to make the home sound system as good as a live performance. The 
variety of manufacturers, technologies (both high and low tech), and personal 
tastes makes any discussion of consumer sound systems a risky invitation for 
conflict. 
There is a way through the melee, however. Since this book is concerned with 
home theater, it is appropriate to limit the discussion of technologies and devices 
to home theater sound, such as surround sound formats or basic stereo formats. 
Further, since this book's primary topic is home theater PCs, we may further 
narrow the discussion to include only such formats and technologies that affect the 
HTPC. Excluded from this text is any description or discussion comparing audio 
amplifiers, receivers, speakers (except those meant to be connected directly to the 
HTPC), and other accessories such as wire, cables, or equalizers. The focus of this 
chapter is the hardware that makes the HTPC work best with all that other stuff. 
Choosing a Sound Card 
In the previous chapter, we explained that selection of a video card is best done 
after selection of a display device, and there is a similar guiding principle for audio 
hardware. The sound card must suit the intended purpose of the HTPC and be 
compatible with the other audio components of the home theater. It is essential 
that you have a good understanding of the different types of sound cards available, 
their relative qualities, and their capability to connect to the rest of the audio 
system in the home theater before you select hardware.

DVD Video 
One of the most common uses for the HTPC system is to play movies from DVDs. 
(Actually, it is so common that it is practically unheard of for an HTPC not to be 
able to do so!) The sound from a DVD is encoded as a digital stream with one or 
more channels of audio, so the HTPC sound components should be compatible 
with this digital format. The simplest solution is to find a sound card that can pass 
the digital audio stream directly out to a digital surround sound receiver for 
decoding and playback through speakers connected to the receiver. This method 
requires a sound card with a digital audio output-an S/PDIF port-that is either a 
coaxial wire or an optical cable connector. Using this hardware, the software DVD 
player can send the digital audio stream to the external decoder in the receiver 
through the digital audio output. Most of the current audio cards on the market 
have an S/PDIF output. 
For those home theaters not already equipped with an external digital audio 
receiver, it is pretty easy to find sound cards that can decode the Dolby Digital or 
DTS audio formats with software and output surround sound to speakers 
connected to multiple sets of analog connectors. There are a wide range of speaker 
sets available that are designed specifically for use with PC sound cards, though 
many of these speaker sets are intended more for computer games than for DVD 
movies. Some of the available speaker sets also include an external digital audio 
decoder, which is a great way to add digital surround sound capabilities to a home 
theater system without spending a lot of money. 
TIP Sound cards with 5.1 analog outputs for "Dolby Digital Ready" audio 
receivers are available. A Dolby Digital Ready receiver has analog connec-
tors for the 5.1 audio channels output by a separate device, such as an 
HTPC, that are just amplified and played through the speakers connected 
to the receiver. This may be an economical alternative to upgrading to a 
digital audio receiver. 
For home theater systems being installed from scratch, the merits of choosing 
an external digital receiver for decoding digital audio and powering speakers 
versus simply connecting a speaker set to the HTPC are pretty balanced. If the 
HTPC is the center of the home theater and all video and audio sources feed into 
it, then there are no issues with connecting speakers directly to it. However, there 
are at least two reasons to prefer a separate, external digital audio receiver. First, 
the speakers available for connecting directly to a PC are not as powerful or avail-
able in as wide a variety as those for a traditional audio receiver. For small home 

Home Theater PC Audio Cards 
theaters this is not a concern, but for larger rooms or for those enthusiasts with a 
favorite brand of speaker, this restriction may be unappealing. Second, when you 
add an HTPC to an existing home theater environment, you may already have a 
digital audio receiver to which most audio and video sources are already 
connected. Even if your existing home theater only has an analog audio receiver 
(that is, a receiver without S/PDIF inputs and without a built-in Dolby Digital or 
DTS audio decoder), you may prefer to replace the receiver with an upgraded 
model and keep the existing speakers. These issues can only be resolved with 
careful consideration on the part of the individual building the home theater 
system, but the decision will impact the selection of audio hardware for the HTPC.

audio receiver.

High-End Sound Cards: DVD-Audio, Super Audio CD, 
and Other Future Audio Formats 
The best solution for integrating leading-edge audio formats with the HTPC is to 
add a sound card that can match the high fidelity of these audio sources. Unfortu-
nately, there are no software applications, codecs, or even down-conversion 
capabilities for the HTPC to play DVD-Audio or Super Audio CD (SACD) media in 
its own DVD drive. An external player is needed to play back these formats, and 
the external player can only be connected by an analog stereo connection. The 
HPTC needs audio hardware capable of matching the high -quality sound output 
121 

ChapterS 
122 
from the player in order to get the best possible audio signal. Most common PC 
sound cards are not able to match this quality, so some knowledge of the specifi-
cations of DVD-Audio, SACD, and sound cards is crucial to selecting the right 
hardware. 
NOTE The SIPDIF digital audio output has a maximum rate of96 KHz at 
24-bit resolution. It is not possible to use the digital audio connection to 
get the full quality of DVD-Audio or SACD players, which can output up 
to 192KHz at 24-bit resolution. These components must be connected with 
analog lines from the player to the HTPC and from the HTPC to the audio 
receiver in order to avoid downsampling. 
The new audio formats of DVD-Audio and SACD allow for sound to be digi-
tally encoded at a higher quality than CD audio. Since most PC sound cards are 
matched to the quality of CD audio, they fall short of the newer sound standards. 
For reference, CD audio specifies that sound is sampled at 44.1 KHz in 16-bit (16/44) 
stereo. DVD-Audio, by comparison, specifies a range of sampling frequencies up 
to 192KHz at 24-bit for stereo audio channels and 96KHz at 24-bit resolution 
(24/96) for 5.1 audio channels. There is now a good selection of sound cards that 
can process 24/96 digital information, but the majority of older and cheaper cards 
simply down-convert it to 16/44 information. 
TIP For more information about sound sampling and digital sound 
formats, refer to Chapter 3. 
It is obvious that the sound signal stored on a DVD-Audio disc is much higher 
resolution than that of CD audio, which should mean that the sound quality is 
also much higher. In practice, the difference in quality to the listener is subjective; 
most people can tell the difference between CD audio and DVD-Audio, but not 
everyone will feel the need to spend more money for the newer format. Those that 
do will probably want to connect a DVD-Audio player directly to an audio receiver 
or amplifier instead of an HTPC in order to minimize the degradation caused 
by multiple connections and the longer path from player to speaker. However, 
some may want to use the HTPC for mixing or recording, or may have speakers 

Home Theater PC Audio Cards 
connected to the HTPC, in which case it is important to include audio hardware 
that is capable of digitizing analog sound at a higher quality than CD audio. 
The digital encoding on an SACD disc uses a different method than CD audio 
or DVD-Audio, so it is difficult to make a comparison between the sound quality of 
these formats. Most subjective comparisons seem to indicate that SACD is equal 
to or better than DVD-Audio. Since the only way to connect an SACD player to an 
HTPC is through the analog stereo connections, there is no compatibility issue 
except to find a sound card that can digitize analog sound at a high sampling 
frequency and resolution. 
The best sound card for use with a high-quality sound source such as DVD-
Audio or SACD is one capable of digitizing sound at 96KHz at 24-bit stereo. 
Though DVD-Audio can be encoded at up to 192KHz, the capabilities of the best 
current sound cards are limited to 96 KHz. Such a high sampling frequency means 
a lot of information being stored on the hard drive of the HTPC when sound is 
recorded, and it also requires a lot more processing power to handle. Sound cards 
in this range generally have one or more stereo inputs and often include digital 
audio outputs in addition to analog outputs. 
1 
TIP Popular sound cards that are capable of handling 44.1 KHz at 16-bit 
stereo sound may also be used with DVD-Audio or SACD players, but they 
cannot record or mix the sound at the same high quality of more expensive 
sound cards. That is, they only record at CD quality, so some of the richness 
ofDVD-Audio or SACD sound is lost. 
Connecting the analog outputs of a DVD-Audio or SACD player to the analog 
inputs of an HTPC sound card is not an ideal method of capturing sound. The digital 
audio information on the disc is converted to an analog signal by the player, then 
redigitized by the HTPC for mixing or storage, after which it must be reconverted 
back to analog in order to be played through speakers. It would be preferable to be 
able to play a DVD-Audio or SACD disc in the DVD drive of an HTPC so that the 
digital audio signal is only converted to analog once when it is finally sent to 
speakers. There is some hope that a DVD-Audio or SACD codec will be released for 
the PC to enable this feature, but manufacturers and content publishers are reluc-
tant to allow this because it has the potential to allow consumers to make perfect 
digital copies of discs. The widespread copyright violations caused by the ability to 
copy or convert CD audio to other formats has made the industry very hesitant to 
lose control of another digital format. 
In the future, a DVD-Audio and SACD co dec may be available for the HTPC, or 
an application that plays these audio formats could be released. As with any other 
123 

ChapterS 
124 
future audio format, it is impossible to predict whether current PC hardware will 
work with the new formats. Manufacturers may implement some form of digital 
copy protection on DVD drives that prevent consumers from making copies of 
discs, and software to use the discs may only work with the new drives. There is a 
risk, then, that the hardware available today could be obsolete in the future. The 
HTPC offers some protection from such obsolescence in that it is cheaper to 
replace a DVD drive than to replace a DVD-Audio or SACD player (and hopefully 
one PC DVD drive can handle both formats!), but there is no way to be perfectly 
compatible with all future technologies. 
Midrange Sound Cards: CD Audio and Other 
Stereo Formats 
Aside from DVD-Audio and Video, and SACD, the quality of most PC sound cards 
is suitable for any sound source to which the HTPC is likely to connect. CD audio 
is ubiquitous and almost every sound card has an internal connector to receive 
audio from the CD drive in a PC. Most audio formats that preceded CD audio are 
analog and can be converted to a digital format by the sound card. There are 
always issues about how much sound is lost and how noticeable the reduction of 
quality is, but for most people, CD-quality audio is sufficient for processing sound 
from home movies, CDs, cassette tapes, and other formats. 
It is important to select a sound card with at least one "line-level" input-
usually labeled "line in." There is a difference between the microphone input and 
a line-level input, and you must take care not to confuse the two. The microphone 
input of a sound card works with very low voltages and the relatively high voltage 
from a CD player or portable stereo can damage the audio hardware. The "phono" 
output from a record player is also unsuitable for connecting to the line-level 
input. The line-level input is an analog input for stereo sound that can be used to 
connect any sound source with a line-level output-often labeled "line out." You 
can also connect a headphone jack to the line-level input, though you must take 
care to keep the volume control from the sound source turned down low enough 
to prevent damage to the input. 
Once a sound source is connected to the line-level input, the HTPC can digi-
tize and record any audio signal that is played by the source. The quality of the 
digitization can be specified, usually in predefined increments from 8 KHz up to 
44KHz and at either 8-bit or 16-bit resolution for mono or stereo. It is important 
to realize that the HTPC has no way to determine the quality of sound being 
played into the line-level input since it is an analog input-the user must decide 
what quality is appropriate for digitizing. In the past, limited hard disk drive space 
and processor performance prompted users to digitize sound with as low quality 

Home Theater PC Audio Cards 
as was appropriate for the source (e.g., speech, AM radio, or microphone-quality 
sound was digitized at less than 44KHz and 16-bit stereo). Modern HTPCs have 
much more disk space and faster processors than in the past, and with the recent 
developments in digital compression, it is just as easy to digitize all audio at the 
highest quality of which the sound card is capable. 
There are now a few hardware manufacturers with lines of midrange sound 
cards that have S/PDIF inputs. These are either coaxial or optical ports that can 
accept a digital sound stream from a source such as a MiniDisc player or a digital 
audio receiver. This allows for higher quality sound, and since it does not have to 
be converted from analog to digital for storage, it loses none of its quality when it 
is imported into the HTPC. Some of these sound cards with digital inputs have no 
analog input port, so in some cases, multiple sound cards may be needed to 
provide a full range of functionality. 
An HTPC is a great way to integrate sound and video from multiple sources, 
but unfortunately most average sound cards have only one line-level input. Most 
common sound cards for the PC platform seem to be marketed to garners, who are 
less interested in the number of audio inputs than home theater enthusiasts. This 
leaves few options except to switch connections each time a different audio source 
is desired, use an external audio switch box, or upgrade to a more costly sound 
card with more inputs. 
Every sound card has, at the least, outputs for connecting to PC speakers. The 
speaker output can be used as a line-level out for connecting to an external audio 
receiver, though many sound cards have a line-out connector in addition to the 
speaker output. Audio hardware that supports any kind of 3D sound format, either 
a proprietary game format or the more standard Dolby Digital5.1, has additional 
outputs for connecting extra speakers to provide rear channel audio. The outputs 
of most medium- and low-cost sound cards are ministereo jacks, which require an 
adapter to connect to the left and right channel of the RCA-type jacks used on 
audio receivers. 
NOTE Fortunately, it is becoming more common to include an SIP DIP 
output on even low-cost sound cards. All sounds generated by the sound 
card or passed into it from an external source should be output through 
the SIP DIP cable to a digital audio receiver, which can decode mono, 
stereo, or surround sound formats.

Sound Cards for Computer Games 
There are some special audio hardware issues for those HTPC hobbyists who 
are considering building a system primarily for playing computer games on their 
big-screen display. For some obscure reason, when surround sound was intro-
duced to PC games, game developers and audio hardware manufacturers decided 
not to use home theater audio formats. It was perhaps the licensing costs of Dolby 
Digital5.1 surround sound, or the fact that it was not a clear industry standard 
at first that prompted the PC gaming industry to invent multiple, proprietary 
surround sound formats. The result of this is a confusing medley of surround 
sound formats and computer games that support some, one, or none of them. 
Any home theater configuration should be able to support PC games with 
stereo, Dolby Pro Logic, or Dolby Digital5.1 surround sound. Games may also 
support EAX or A3D, which are two competing surround sound formats developed 
specifically for the PC. EAX is published by Creative Labs and is supported by most 
of their current sound hardware. It is a sound-processing technology that adds 
atmosphere and other effects to games, music, or any audio track. A3D, published 
by Aureal, was a full surround sound format with dynamic positioning and effects 
that required a special microprocessor to do all the calculations for the complex 
sound interactions. Aureal is no longer around, but many of the games that 
support A3D are still popular. In order to get the benefit of either EAX or A3D 
sound, the HPTC must have a sound card that supports the format. 
It seems that in order to achieve maximum compatibility, computer games 
should support Dolby Digital5.1 surround sound, and this is beginning to sink in 
with game developers and audio hardware manufacturers (see Figure 5-2). The 
new generation of sound cards are capable of not only passing the digital audio 5.1 
surround sound from a DVD movie to an external decoder, but also encoding a 
Dolby Digital5.1 surround sound signal in real time for games or other audio 
effects.

Figure 5-2. Dolby Digital5.1 is now the de facto industry standard and is used 
frequently in games. 

Home Theater PC Audio Cards 
Sound cards from Creative Labs seem to be the hardware of choice for PC 
garners. The EAX sound standard adds a great amount of environmental realism to 
the virtual worlds inside the computer, and the newest Sound Blaster Live! sound 
cards support Dolby Digital5.1 pass-through and real-time dynamic surround 
sound effects. Though the Creative Labs sound cards have some shortcomings for 
DVD video playback, they are continuously popular with game developers and 
game players. 
AC '97 
In order to lower the cost of common PC components such as sound cards, 
modems, and network cards, Intel published the Audio Codec '97 (AC '97) and 
Modem Codec '97 (MC '97), along with the Digital Controller (DC '97) specifica-
tion. These specifications allowed hardware manufacturers to design cheap audio 
hardware systems that work with the system CPU to deliver the functionality of a 
sound card, modem, or network card. The specified audio quality is 16-bit stereo 
input and output at up to 48 KHz, and recent versions of the AC '97 specification 
include an optional S/PDIF output. In the past few years, AC '97 audio hardware 
has been added to several motherboards and is also available from sound cards. 
The cost of AC '97 audio hardware is very attractive, and it is well suited for 
most typical PC uses. However, anyone considering using it in an HTPC should 
note that it has some limitations. First, since it is limited to a maximum 16-bit 
sampling rate for input and output, it is not capable of reproducing the optimum 
sound quality for DVD movies. Second, since the AC '97 specification is meant to 
lower costs of computer systems, it is not optimized for sound quality and some 
home theater enthusiasts are bound to find it inadequate when connected to an 
expensive sound system. Third, the AC '97 sound hardware relies on the system 
CPU for some processing of sound effects, so the performance of the HTPC is 
affected, though this is really only an issue for slower processors. Despite these 
limitations, there are undoubtedly some areas in which an AC '97-equipped HTPC 
is ample, and the economy of this audio hardware is almost unbeatable. 
Special Considerations 
Sound cards are available with a wide variety of features, for a range of prices, and 
with different levels of quality. Selecting the best card for an HTPC system begins 
with deciding what the primary purpose of the system will be: playing back DVD 
movies, recording and editing audio, gaming, or listening to music. The next step 
is to examine the short list of suitable sound cards to decide which features, 
including the "undocumented" ones, will affect the performance of the hardware. 
127 

ChapterS 
128 
Though most PC hardware components are generally reliable and economical, 
there are some special considerations to bear in mind when you select audio 
hardware. 
Digital Audio Coaxial Output Line Voltage 
Many home theater enthusiasts building an HTPC will want to connect the 
system to their existing digital audio receiver through the sound card's S/PDIF 
output. This is almost always the preferred method of creating a high-quality 
link between the HTPC and the rest of the home theater audio system. However, 
while researching this topic, we found a discussion on the AV Science Forum 
(http: I /WiM. avsforum. com) indicating that there are some sound cards with digital 
audio coaxial outputs that use a higher voltage than the specification requires. 
This high voltage can damage a digital audio receiver, so it is important to know 
that the voltages are compatible. 
The early versions of the Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! II had an S/PDIF 
coaxial output that was meant for use with a proprietary Dolby Digital5.1 decoder 
and the line output at 5 volts instead of the standard 0.5 volts. Connecting this 
output to a digital audio receiver that is expecting 0.5 volts could cause damage to 
the hardware. The newer Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 cards do not output such a high 
voltage through the S/PDIF line, though they are apparently still above the 0.5 volt 
specification. Creative Labs offers add-on hardware for these sound cards that 
includes an optical S/PDIF output, as does Hoontec (http: I lwww. hoontech. com/ 
english/index.html), which is a safer method of connecting the sound card to the 
digital audio receiver. As far as we could tell, none of the other Creative Labs sound 
cards, or any other manufacturer's audio hardware, had this out -of-specification 
voltage problem. 
NOTE Creative Labs built in the extra voltage to support their external 
speaker systems. Two Sound Blaster Live! II versions output the proper spec 
for an external decoder, the rest do not (Live! Value II's [4830 and 4832]).

Home Theater PC Audio Cards 
When 24/96 Is Not Equal to 24196 
The digital audio tracks on a DVD are stored at a sampling rate of up to 96 kHz and 
24-bit resolution, which is commonly referred to as 24/96. Ideally, a sound card 
that can pass the 24/96 digital audio through to an external receiver, or process 
the 24/96 audio stream and output it to the appropriate speakers, is desirable. It is 
important to check the specifications of the sound cards you are considering for 
your HTPC to make sure that they can handle this data without down-sampling 
before outputting to speakers or an external decoder. 
During our research we discovered that the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 
Audigy and Extigy series of audio hardware down-samples the 24/96 digital audio 
stream to 16-bit at 48KHz for internal processing, including pass-through output. 
Though it is up-sampled for the digital audio outputs, it still loses some quality by 
being converted down and then back up. This is a little difficult to discover from 
any of the Creative Labs literature, but independent testing at the Tom's Hardware 
Guide Web site (http: I lwww. toms hardware. com) reveals the limitation of the Creative 
Labs hardware. Although the Audigy and Extigy are completely compatible with 
any 24/96 input and output equipment, the sound quality is compromised by the 
internal conversion and processing. Of course, to get a better sound card for 
the PC, you have to pay a lot more money than you do for the economically 
priced Creative Labs hardware. 
External Audio Hardware 
As the demand for high-quality audio for the PC platform increases, some manu-
facturers have begun to offer sound cards that aren't really sound cards-not in 
the traditional sense of a PC adapter card, anyway. Critics of the PC often claim 
that the inside of a computer case is full of stray electrical signals and magnetic 
fields caused by all the unshielded wiring, power supplies, fans, and electronic 
components. This is the worst possible environment for audio hardware, which 
ideally should be isolated from any external interference to prevent distortion, 
static, pops, hisses, and other sound anomalies. The solution now available on 
the market is an external sound processor (see Figure 5-3). 
129 

ChapterS 
130 
Figure 5-3. External audio hardware is basically a sound card in a fancy case. 
The external processor is essentially the same hardware as a sound card 
meant to be installed internally to the PC, but with its own casing and a long wire 
connecting it to the PC. The external device is removed from the electrically noisy 
environment of the PC case, and all of the inputs and outputs are connected to the 
external hardware to prevent interference to them, too. The external audio hard-
ware is commonly connected to a USB port, though some actually work on a COM 
or parallel port. You can expect to see IEEE 1394 versions available if this trend 
catches on. 
Since the audio hardware does not live inside the PC, it cannot use the PC's 
CPU to assist with any processing. This means that the external hardware is both 
more capable and more expensive. The Creative Labs Sound Blaster Extigy has a 
built-in Dolby Digital5.1 surround sound decoder for very clean audio from DVD 
movies. The external audio hardware is also perfectly suited for use with multiple 
HTPCs, since it can be easily moved from one unit to the next, or even with laptop 
computers. If the HTPC is often moved in and out of the home theater, an external 
sound device is much easier to connect than all those inputs, outputs, and 
speakers. 

Home Theater PC Audio Cards 
Integrated Sound Hardware 
Several motherboard manufacturers offer PC motherboards with audio hardware 
built into the system board. There seem to be only two types of sound available in 
an integrated board: Creative Labs Sound Blaster or some version of AC '97 hard-
ware. Currently, the motherboards with the Creative Labs Sound Blaster all feature 
variations of common Sound Blaster models such as the Sound Blaster Live! or 
the older Sound Blaster Pro. There seem to be an endless variety of Sound Blaster 
chipsets, so that the Sound Blaster versions available on motherboards are not the 
same as the ones available as sound cards, but the quality and features are mostly 
the same. Generally, this is a less expensive alternative to buying a separate sound 
card, so for HTPCs that will use a Sound Blaster sound card, finding an integrated 
motherboard with a Sound Blaster chip should lower the cost of the system. 
Before you buy a motherboard with integrated audio, you should do some 
research. It is sometimes difficult to fmd the correct sound drivers for the obscure 
audio hardware that motherboard manufacturers dig up. Integrating sound hard-
ware on a motherboard is almost always a result of trying to lower costs, and there 
seem to be a lot of motherboards with an audio chip that is used nowhere else in 
the world. Selecting an AC '97-compliant sound system integrated on a mother-
board is a safe way to avoid driver problems. Another issue is with a specific 
motherboard chipset: The VIA KT133 chipset on some Gigabyte motherboards 
with onboard audio have severe sound distortion issues under certain operating 
systems. Windows 95/98/ME work fine with this hardware, but Windows 2000 and 
XP do not. (There is a more detailed discussion of PC operating systems for HTPCs 
in Chapter 8.) Though this is an older example of a Gigabyte motherboard, some 
people have complained about less severe occurrences of this problem on new 
motherboards from other manufacturers. 
Remote Controls 
One great feature that some sound card manufacturers are starting to add to their 
high-end audio hardware is an infrared (IR) receiver for a remote control (see 
Figure 5-4). This makes it very convenient to use the HTPC from the couch 
without having to drag a keyboard and mouse cord across the floor. Separate IR 
receivers are available for the PC, but adding one to the audio hardware saves 
some cost and adds a lot of value to an HTPC. The Creative Labs Sound Blaster 
Audigy and Extigy include an IR remote control with certain versions of these 
sound cards, making them quite attractive to HTPC enthusiasts. 
131 

ChapterS 
You can program a remote control IR receiver with PC 
software to do much more than control the sound card 
functions. You can use the remote to switch video modes, 
play DVD movies, and tune the channels on the television 
tuner card in addition to raising and lowering the volume 
or jumping through a list of MP3 song titles. For a more 
detailed discussion of controlling the HTPC remotely, 
please refer to Chapter 7. 
MIDI Connections and 
Synthesized Music 
Most sound cards include a Musical Instrument Digital 
Interface (MIDI) connector for attaching MIDI devices 
such as electronic instruments and MIDI sequencers. The 
Creative Labs series of sound cards also uses the MIDI 
connector as a game control connector, so an adapter is 
required to use it with MIDI devices. An HTPC with a 
high-end sound card is an excellent mixing and recording 
device, and the addition of the MIDI port makes it a great 
machine for casual or serious musicians. 
Figure 5-4. Whats a home theater 
system without a remote control? 
In the past few years, music on the PC has become 
mostly a digitized format. That is, music is stored, 
132 
compressed, mixed, or played back as a digital represen-
tation of the analog waveform that is the sound. In previous years, however, it was 
much more common for music on the PC to be synthesized. Synthesized music is 
created by playing digitized representations of instruments at the pitch and volume 
denoted by a musical score. Instead of playing back a digitized copy of the original, 
the computer played the music like a musician, using the instrument sounds 
stored in its memory. The stored.instrument sounds were based on the MIDI speci-
fication of which instruments were required. Though this method of creating music 
on the computer is now relatively rare, there are still some uses for it. 
The quality of synthesized music and sound created by a PC depends on the 
quality of the MIDI instruments in the audio hardware. Cheaper sound cards use 
an FM synthesizer to approximate the sound of a piano, guitar, flute, and so forth. 
The FM synthesizer generates a sound wave that is close to the wave produced by 
the actual instrument, but the FM synthesizer generates a consistent and steady 
sound without the variation and character of a real instrument. Better quality 
music is produced by storing actual digitized samples of the original instruments 
and playing them back at the correct pitch. A high-quality MIDI score may be a

How important is good MIDI instrumentation? MIDI sound and music is 
common in PC computer games, so game players who like to listen to the in-game 
music that keeps pace with the action and story will benefit from the more real-
istic sounds of audio hardware with a good MIDI instrumentation. Also, anyone 
who likes to compose music may enjoy better quality instruments instead of 
FM -synthesized notes. 
TIP The number of simultaneous notes that a sound card can synthesize 
determines the quality of the musical score, especially for orchestral pieces 
with multiple instruments. Creative Labs makes it pretty easy to figure out 
how many notes can be produced at once with Sound Blaster 16, Sound 
Blaster AWE 32, and Sound Blaster 128. 
Connecting Audio from the HTPC to the Home Theater 
Connecting the HTPC to the rest of the home theater is pretty simple. The most 
important issue is to determine whether the HTPC will output sound through an 
S/PDIF digital audio port to a digital audio receiver, or if analog stereo or surround 
sound connections will be used. This decision depends on the available audio 
components in the home theater and the audio hardware installed in the HTPC. 
The purpose of this chapter has been to make this decision easy by selecting a 
sound card that is most suitable for the home theater into which is it going. 
Connecting the HTPC to a digital audio receiver via a digital audio cable is the 
best way to get high-quality sound for all HTPC features. The digital audio cable 
may be a 75 ohm coaxial cable or an optical fiber-optic cable. Coaxial cables have 
RCA-type connectors at either end and simply push onto the connector on the 
back of the digital audio receiver. Most sound cards do not have an RCA-type 
connector for the coaxial digital audio cable, so an adapter is required. The 
Creative Labs sound cards simply require a mono miniplug (1/8 inch, 3.5 mm) to 
RCA-type converter, which connects to the other end ofthe coaxial cable. It is a 
good idea to use a shielded cable to prevent interference, even though the cable 
carries a digital signal. Any audible pops, scratching noises, or dropped sound 
could be attributable to electrical interference if a shielded cable is not used. 
If the sound card in the HTPC features an optical digital audio connector, and 
the digital audio receiver also has this port, then it is preferable to use an optical 
link cable (sometimes called a Toslink cable). The sound quality is exactly the 
same between the coaxial cable and the optical cable, since the same digital infor-
mation is being sent, but the optical cable is not prone to electrical interference 
and, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, it will not damage the audio equipment 
if the voltage output by the audio card is out of specification. 
133 

ChapterS 
134 
Analog connections are pretty simple for anyone who has set up an audio 
receiver, CD player, orVHS deck. Most PC sound cards have outputs in the form of 
ministereo plugs (l I 8 inch, 3.5 mm) for connecting to PC speakers or headphones. 
In order to connect these analog outputs to an audio receiver, a cable that converts 
the ministereo to the left and right RCA-type plugs is needed. The left and right 
plugs are usually color-coded red and white, or red and black. To output sound 
from the HTPC to an audio receiver, you should connect the line out from the 
sound card to the inputs on the receiver. It is also possible to use the headphone 
output, if no line out is present, but you should take care to turn down any volume 
control before making the connection. 
CAUTION It is possible to connect the line out to an audio receiver and to 
connect the line in from the same receiver, but you should take care to 
prevent feedback from causing distorted sound or even damage to the 
audio hardware. When sound is being played out to the receiver, the line-in 
control should be muted. When sound is being recorded from the receiver, 
the line-out should be muted. 
If your HTPC is going to be connected to a PC speaker set, either a pair of 
stereo speakers or a full surround sound set, then the connections will depend on 
the speaker set and the audio hardware. Some speaker sets have a built-in digital 
audio decoder, so that only a single digital audio connection is required from the 
S/PDIF port on the sound card to the S/PDIF input on the decoder. Some speaker 
sets have an analog input for each speaker in the surround sound set, so that a 
separate wire must be run to each speaker. Often the speaker inputs are all on one 
piece, such as the center channel speaker or the subwoofer, so that all the wires 
run from the sound card to just one speaker component. 
NOTE When you connect a sound card to a surround sound speaker set, 
you'll often use special attachments to split one output from the back of 
the sound card to the various inputs on the speakers. These special cables 
and attachments are included with the sound card or with the speaker set, 
but it may appear at first as if there aren't enough outputs on the sound 
card to match the number of speakers.

The HTPC Project Hardware 
Our two HTPC project machines are going to feature the capability to output 
Dolby Digital5.1 and DTS 5.1 surround sound for DVD movies to an external 
digital audio receiver. This feature is becoming common on even low-priced audio 
hardware such as the AC '97-compatible sound systems. We have found very nice 
sound cards for both our economical HTPC system and our high-end system, and 
even the hardware for our high-end system is reasonably priced. As the audio 
potential of the HTPC is developed and explored, it becomes more and more 
attractive to build one. 
HTPC System 1 
Although both of our HTPC project machines will feature digital audio output, 
we decided that our first system would have a true 24/96 sound card capable of 
processing audio without down-converting and up-converting. We wanted a 
sound card with both analog and digital outputs, and with RCA-type connectors 
for use with our existing home theater audio equipment. Sound cards with the 
ministereo plugs require a special adapter cable to convert the ministereo jack to 
the left and right audio inputs and outputs of other audio devices. We also wanted 
audio hardware with optical and coaxial digital audio outputs in order to compare 
the two cables to find out if there is any difference in audio quality. 
TheM -Audio Delta series of sound cards for the PC are highly regarded by the 
HTPC community for their excellent sound quality and compatibility with PC soft-
ware. We approached Midiman, the makers of theM-Audio hardware, and asked 
them for suggestions about sound cards for an HTPC system. They generously 
provided us with an M-Audio Delta Dio 2496 sound card (see Figure 5-5). This 
component features true 24/96 digital processing for all audio signals, optical 
digital audio input and output, coaxial digital audio input and output, and 
RCA-type jacks for analog stereo input and output. 
135 

ChapterS 
136 
Figure 5-5. The Midiman M-Audio Delta Dio 2496 sound card 
Some further research into theM -Audio line of sound cards showed us that 
another Midiman sound card, theM -Audio Audiophile 2496, is also a very popular 
sound card in the HTPC community. This card has the same true 24/96 digital 
audio processing capabilities of the Delta Dio 2496, but it lacks the optical digital 
audio connections. The Audiophile 2496 is slightly cheaper than the Delta Dio 
2496, so if coaxial digital audio outputs are sufficient (and there should be no 
difference in audio quality between coaxial and optical connections, if the coaxial 
cable is properly shielded and free of interference), then the Audiophile is a great 
way to save some of the expense of audio hardware. 
You can find more information about the software configuration and perform-
ance of this sound card in Chapter 12.

HTPC System 2 
The audio hardware we have selected for our second HTPC system is the Creative 
Labs Sound Blaster Live! sound card (see Figure 5-6). This sound card is very 
economical and very popular with computer game players. It is also suitable for 
use in an HTPC because of its coaxial digital audio output, and it even has the 
capability to do Dolby Digital5.1 decoding and analog output to a set of surround 
sound computer speakers. 
Figure 5-6. The Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! sound card

ChapterS 
138 
This sound card does not have the capability to process 24/96 digital audio, as 
it is limited to 16-bit resolution at 48 KHz sampling rate. This card does have some 
excellent sound effects for PC games and music, though. The slight loss of sound 
quality for DVD movie playback could be counterbalanced by the added value for 
music and gaming, so we will occasionally swap the sound cards between our two 
project HTPC systems for comparative testing. 
Our HTPC systems have two of the most important components selected so 
far, but they are not yet ready for use. We need to select a few more pieces, put 
them all together, and then configure all the software before we can kick back and 
watch a few DVD movies or enjoy our CD collection. For the results of our sound 
card tests and performance, see Chapter 12. 
Summary 
The choice of which sound card is best for your HTPC depends largely on what 
applications you'll be taxing your HTPC with. Your decision will be different 
depending on whether you're more concerned with gaming, MP3 playback, or 
Dolby Digital home theater surround sound. In the next chapter, you'll examine 
video capture devices, from capturing home movies to setting up your very own 
digital video recorder (DVR) on your HTPC. 

CHAPTER 6 
Video Capture Devices 
AN HTPC IS, of course, an excellent device for viewing DVDs, maximizing picture 
quality, and ensuring spectacular sound. These elements are the backbone for 
HTPC use, but there are other equally impressive uses for the machine that until 
recently weren't an option. You can use HTPCs as digital video recorders (DVRs) 
to capture video signals from cable, analog, or satellite. In short, you can use the 
HTPC much like a super-VCR that can capture hundreds of hours of programming 
without the bother of swapping tapes. 
You can also use the HTPC to capture homemade videos (or even commercial 
video work). Once you've converted the video to digital information on the HTPC, 
you can manipulate and professionally edit it to look as good as any Hollywood 
flick. Ultimately, the HTPC can be a one-stop appliance that plays DVDs, VCDs, 
CDs, and MP3s; routes satellite and cable signals; archives and displays family 
photos; and acts as an uber-VCR that can capture hundreds of hours of high-
quality video. In short, if you're interested in recording shows or importing home 
videos for editing on your computer, a video capture device is required, whether 
it be a Fire Wire card for capturing digital video from camcorders or a USB video 
capture device for converting analog video to digital. We explain just what these 
devices do and how to manipulate them for your needs. 
This chapter will look at the various ways to capture, manipulate, edit, and 
reuse video sources that flow into your HTPC. 
Digital Video Recorders 
In recent years there has been an explosion of digital video recorders (DVRs) avail-
able to the North American public. These include systems such as TiVo, ReplayTV; 
UltimateTV; and in Canada Bell Expressvu's personal video recorder (PVR). DVRs 
are versatile video recording devices that use the raw power of today's computers 
to capture video and save it in a digital format. As you might expect, you can 
manipulate, search, and save video that's stored digitally much easier than you 
can with video that's stored on tape. 
139 

Chapter6 
140 
NOTE Digital information has the added bonus of not degrading over 
time the way in which analog videotapes will. For audio/video aficionados, 
the high quality and fidelity of both the visual and aural aspects of their 
favorite programming is of paramount importance. Over time, videotapes 
will degrade noticeably, even if they haven't been used! This degradation is 
a primary reason for switching to DVRs, so that favorite television shows or 
home movies can be saved, manipulated, and moved easily with no 
adverse effect on the quality of the picture or sound. 
Although you have several commercial DVR options, you must also consider 
the HTPC as a receptacle for digital video as well as a high-performance playback 
device. In fact, with the recent proliferation of DVD recording devices available for 
PCs (and a few stand-alone units that act like VCRs), recorded television shows 
and home videos can be permanently recorded and stored on DVD-R media, and 
used and reused ad nauseam with no degradation in quality. 
What Makes a DVR a DVR? 
A DVR is quite simply a device that records video and audio information digitally 
rather than by the old-fashioned means of recording it on magnetic tape as analog 
information. Technically, a DVR could be any device that records video signals 
digitally (digital camcorders are an example of this), but for the purposes of this 
book we count DVRs only as devices that are solely dedicated to recording video 
digitally for playback at a later date. 
All of the three current commercial DVRs available (TiVo, UltimateTV; and 
Replay'IV) have the same basic architecture. These machines are essentially glori-
fied computers: Each has a CPU, memory (RAM), one or more hard drives, and an 
MPEG-2 encoder and decoder. As the video information comes into the DVR 
(from television, for example), the MPEG-2 encoder compresses the signal and 
information so that it can be stored digitally (as ls and Os) on the hard drive that 
is contained within the unit. The bigger the DVR's hard drive, the more program-
ming can be stored on the DVR-in fact, there is no logical limit to how much 
information can be stored in this manner. If the DVR is attached to a redundant 
array of independent disks (multiple hard disk drives), literally hundreds (if not 
thousands) of hours can be recorded. 

Vuleo Capture Devices 
NOTE Most commercial DVRs come with 30 hours of available recording 
time, but if you swap a larger hard drive into these units, you can increase 
that time greatly. On a 30-hour TiVo, putting in one 80GB hard drive to 
replace the existing hard drive can increase the available recording time 
from 30 hours to nearly 70. We don't, however, recommend modifying a 
commercial DVR. After all, doing so voids the warranty and you risk 
damaging both yourself and the equipment. 
In summary, a DVR is a computer masquerading as a VCR. The DVR runs on 
some sort of operating system (OS) such as Linux (TiVo runs on a modified Linux 
OS), but it works behind the scenes so that all the consumer sees is an efficient 
menu system and a product that's chock-full of previously unheard-offeatures. 
DVR Features/Benefits 
As we mentioned previously, DVRs have features that clearly set them apart from 
tape-based video recorders such as VHS and Betamax. DVRs are most definitely 
the recording medium of the future, so let's have a look at just what they offer. 
Recording Television Programs 
Like VCRs, DVRs can record television programs from any sort of input, including 
antenna, cable, and satellite. Commercial DVRs, however, are tied to satellite or 
digital cable services and must be used in conjunction with them in order for the 
features (such as a dynamic onscreen guide) to work. Recording a television show 
on a DVR is considerably easier than the VCR alternative. 
Recording Made Easy 
Because the programming guide appears onscreen and shows many hours of 
programming over numerous channels at a glance, it's easy to pick out program-
ming to record simply by looking at the guide (see Figure 6-1). When you see a 
program you want to record, you need only move the cursor over the listing and 
press a single button. The program will then be added to the DVR's "to-do" list and 
will be recorded. 
141 

Chapter6 
142 
Figure 6-1. A TiVo control screen in action 
With a VCR, you must manually enter a program and include the date, the 
time, and the channel that the program will appear on. You also have to make 
sure that you have a tape with enough space free in the VCR before you set it up 
to record the program at a later time. With the DVR, it's a one-button process in 
most cases. 
Recording While Watching Something Else 
While this concept isn't new, the DVR takes it to a new level. Since a DVR stores 
recorded programs digitally, those programs are very accessible and can be 
watched at the same time that another program is being recorded. In fact, if the 
DVR has a dual LNB input (two satellite inputs), you can actually record two shows 
at once (off of different channels) while you watch a third show that had been 
previously recorded! 
With the commercial DVRs (and even with most HTPC DVR software), this 
recording/playback is seamless and works through a series of menus. The end 
user never knows about how much data is flowing around inside the machine. 
The ability to watch a previously recorded show while a completely different show 
is being recorded simultaneously shows the raw power and awesome versatility of 
the DVR in the home entertainment environment. 

Video Capture Devices 
Season's Pass 
All of the commercial DVRs are capable of capturing all episodes of any show. 
On the TiVo this is called a "Season's Pass," and it enables TiVo users to get all of 
the episodes of any show automatically. For example, if you are a big fan of The 
Simpsons, you could tell the DVR to capture each and every first-run episode of 
The Simpsons and save them forever. Or, you could tell the DVR to capture all 
episodes of The Simpsons off of any channel, but not to duplicate them. 
There are many other variables you can alter when you program the DVR to 
record an entire season of a show. For example, you can tell it to capture only five 
episodes at once and to only save them as long as there is enough space on the 
DVR's hard drive. Or, you can tell it to save the shows until you decide to delete 
them. Needless to say, those who have several shows they simply must watch can 
use the DVR to capture the entire season of each show so that they can watch their 
favorite shows at their leisure. 
TIP Television shows that have been recorded to a DVR are not confined to 
the DVRforever. In fact, they can be dumped out to either DVD-R or VHS 
videotape so that they can be viewed on someone else's entertainment 
system. Of course, dumping shows onto DVD-R or VHS is also a practical 
way to free up space on the DVR. 
Pausing Live Television 
One of the much-ballyhooed features ofTiVo, ReplayTV; and UltimateTVis the 
ability to pause live television. Although it appears that live television can be 
paused, it's more of a parlor trick than really pausing live television. This works 
because the DVRs keep a running buffer of the channel that's currently selected. 
The size of this buffer depends on the amount of recording time available in the 
unit, but usually it's between 15 minutes and 1 hour. When the user presses the 
Pause button, the live programming is paused, but since the signal is still coming 
into the DVR, the show is actually being recorded as time passes. When the user 
resumes playback, the playback is slightly behind the actual broadcast. 
143 

Chapter6 
144 
NOTE The SONICblue ReplayTV has a version that can record a whopping 
320 hours of programming. This unit can pause live television and buffer 
a single channel for an incredible 40 hours. Therefore, with this system you 
could pause a show in the morning just before going to work and come 
back to it the next morning and continue watching it without a hitch. 
The applications for pausing live television are many. In to day's busy world, 
with phones and doorbells ringing seemingly every few minutes, having the ability 
to pause a television program is very useful. Since the buffer is always on, DVRs 
also allow users to quickly rewind to view a scene that happened a few seconds or 
minutes ago, and they allow users to view these scenes in slow motion or frame by 
frame-an excellent application for sports lovers. Bart has often found that he'll be 
watching television and something of interest to his wife will appear. He can call 
her into the television room and quickly zip back and show her the scene rather 
than having to describe it to her after the fact. 
Active Program Guide 
Because most DVRs work with satellite systems such as DIRECTY, the program-
ming guide they use appears onscreen and is dynamically updated so that the 
information is completely up-to-the-minute accurate. As we mentioned in the 
"Recording Made Easy" section, picking programs to record using the active 
program guide is very simple, but an active program guide also allows you to 
browse through the full range of channels to see both what is currently playing 
and what is upcoming on each of the channels. Figure 6-2 shows an example 
of an active program guide from ATI. 
NOTE Many cable channels now have a similar guide structure, although 
they are not always as flexible or powerful as those with the digital satellite 
systems. However, that is largely a matter of personal opinion. 

Video Capture Devices 
Figure 6-2. ATI's GUIDE Plus+ 
An active program guide is also valuable when you use the DVR to record 
future broadcasts. Because the program guide keeps at least 2 full weeks of 
complete listings on hand at all times, it's easy to tell the DVR to record a football 
game that won't happen untillO days from now. It should also be noted that there 
are now some open source standards being implemented in the way the guide is 
transmitted using XML by the broadcaster, rather than the service that you have 
subscribed to. The implications of this include more compatibility between 
systems and nonproprietary technology use. 
Finding Programs by Keyword and Preference 
Although using the onscreen program guide can be an efficient way of finding 
programs on a DVR, the fact is that with today's satellite dishes there are literally 
hundreds of available channels and thousands of programs being run in any given 
week. For this reason, all DVRs have the option of searching for programming by 
keyword. Likewise, some DVRs will keep track of what you watch and will then 
make suggestions as to what you might enjoy watching. 
145

146 
Advantages of DVRs 
Although we described most of the advantages of DVRs earlier in this chapter, we 
thought it would be helpful to show a bulleted list of the significant feature 
improvements that DVRs offer over tape-based recording systems. 
â¢ A DVR records high-quality digital video. 
â¢ A DVR's archived video does not break down over time. 
â¢ You can use the online programming guides to record shows. 
â¢ You can capture all shows in a single season with "Season's Pass" -like 
features. 
â¢ You can "pause" live television with a DVR. 
â¢ Since the recorded programming is digital, you can move through the 
programs quickly and nonsequentially. 
â¢ If you're watching a program and stop it 27 minutes into it, the show will 
restart at the same point 27 minutes into the show no matter when you 
resume watching it. 
â¢ You can record one show while you watch another recorded show. If you 
have dual LNB systems, you can watch a recorded show while you record 
two shows at once! 
â¢ You can upgrade most DVRs by simply inserting a larger hard drive if you 
have a little technical expertise. 
The HTPC DVR 
Now that you know a little about just what a DVR is capable of, you need to look 
at the possibility of adding DVR capabilities to your HTPC. Although it's not neces-
sarily as slick as the commercially available DVRs, an HTPC can give you some 
distinct advantages over its glossy counterparts. Some of the advantages of the 
HTPC DVR are as follows: 
â¢ You can upgrade software in HTPCs as updates become available. 
â¢ You can upgrade an HTPC's hardware as needed. For example, if you feel 
you need another 30 hours of recording capability, simply pop in another 
hard drive. 

Video Capture Devices 
â¢ The HTPC DVR eliminates the need for multiple boxes. Because the HTPC is 
a sound system, a DVD player, a photo reservoir, a DVR, and a home video 
editing unit, it eliminates the need for a large component rack in the enter-
tainment room. 
â¢ Because most of the required hardware for an HTPC DVR is the actual PC, 
its cost is reduced significantly. 
â¢ You don't pay monthly fees for the DVR service in an HTPC. 
â¢ You can record HDTV signals when available. The majority of current 
commercial DVRs don't have HDTV decoders in them. 
Required Equipment for an HTPC DVR 
Fortunately, most of the equipment you need to make an HTPC a DVR is 
contained within the PC itself. Still, there are a few extras you must have in place if 
your HTPC is to function properly as a home-brewed DVR that will offer many 
years of reliable service. 
Powerful PC 
As much as we wish that a lower-end PC would be sufficient to make DVR features 
work well on a PC, the cold, hard truth is that a Pentium III 450 is about the 
minimum machine necessary to handle the rather heavy task of compressing 
incoming video. With the ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500 card in a Pentium III 450 
running Windows 98 SE, we experienced some difficulties when switching 
between the various modes-for example, from DVD to television or from televi-
sion to the player (which plays recorded files). While the Pentium III 450 (which 
had 256MB of RAM) was acceptable with the 7500, we found that upping the 
processing power and adding more RAM significantly smoothed out the edges. 
Our recommended machine is a 1 GHz Pentium 4 with at least 512MB of RAM. 
Just a couple of years ago this would have seemed like a very tall order, but prices 
have fallen so dramatically that finding an inexpensive PC with these attributes is 
quite easy indeed. Suffice it to say that you should use the fastest PC that you can 
afford-you won't regret it. When dealing with video capture, editing, and DVR 
functions, it's always better to have more speed and especially more RAM. If you 
can afford it, a higher-end Pentium 4 or Athlon will certainly serve you well for 
years to come. 
147 

Chapter6 
148 
Hard Disk 
NOTE Even if you can't afford a higher-end PC right now, the HTPC is 
completely upgradeable for when you can afford to make your equipment 
a little zippier. 
The amount of recorded video content available to you is mostly dependent on 
how much hard disk space is at your disposal on the HTPC. Obviously, the larger 
the hard drive, the more content you'll be able to archive, and just how much you 
want to save is entirely up to you. Since 80GB and larger drives are under $150.00 
(at the time this book was written), it's relatively inexpensive to load up with 
more than 1OOGB of hard drive space available purely for digital video recording. 
Just how much recording time each gigabyte of storage space will give you 
depends on a number of things, including the video quality settings and the 
software you use for compressing the video. The ATI compression software gives 
roughly l hour of recording time for every 3GB of hard drive space with the quality 
level at 75 percent. Therefore, an 80GB hard drive that's completely dedicated to 
video storage will yield around 30 hours of content. Of course, if you turn down 
the quality, you can double these numbers! 
Bundled Software 
Most television tuner packages and television video cards come with bundled DVR 
software. How well this software works depends on a number of factors, but as a 
rule it all requires a faster-than-average PC to really perform exceptionally well. 
All of these bundled software packages are certainly more than adequate, and we 
recommend any of them, although we prefer the ATI All-In-Wonder package 
overall. 
I 
TIP Some of the software packages, such as ATI's, are capable of deinter-
lacing video, which makes software such as DScaler unnecessary. In fact, 
DScaler won't work with ATI's chipset, but this is not an issue because of 
the excellent job the All-In-Wonder does of deinterlacing the television 
signal. That said, considering that DScaler is freeware, it is an outstanding 
piece of software that does an excellent job if you need it. After all, the price 
is right!

Matrox Marvel G450 eTV 
Matrox has a long history of production -solid television-related products. While 
their 3D cards don't have the same punch as NVIDIA's, if gaming isn't a huge 
concern then the Matrox card is a winner. The G450 eTV includes a full video-
editing suite, DVR software, component and composite outputs, and even 
picture-in-picture capabilities. To see the specs for the G450 eTV; go to

ATI Ail-In-Wonder Radeon 7500/8500 
As we mentioned previously, the built-in software suite for these cards is excellent. 
The only caveat is that the DVR software requires a high-end machine to run 
seamlessly, but still, we are running two of three HTPCs with Radeon 7500s. The 
Ali-In-Wonder (see Figure 6-3) also includes MPEG-2 video editing and capture, 
DVR, desktop television, GUIDE Plus+ programming, complete wireless remote

Stand-alone DVRIPVR Hardware/Software 
While there are distinct advantages to an ali-in-one approach to building an 
HD'IV HTPC, and the l\'VIDIA, ATI, and Matrox options are tempting, there are 
also other ways to turn your HTPC into a DVR or PVR (as some call them). In this 
section, we look at several of these products, some of which include the hardware 
necessary to import television signals, whereas others are only software packages 
that require the user to already have the input hardware in place. 
Hauppauge 
Hauppauge offers a great many products that will complement any HTPC, 
including television tuners, HD'IV tuners, digital video editing boards, and DVR 
boards and software. For DVR we recommend theirWm'IV-PVR 350 board. This 
product sells for around $200.00 and includes hardware MPEG-2 encoding and 
decoding, which greatly reduces the stress placed on your HTPC system during 
recording or playback. To see the extensive line ofHTPC-related products at

WinDVR2 
lnterVideo's WinDVR 2 (see Figure 6-4) is a very inexpensive software solution that 
does a commendable job of working as a DVR with your existing television tuner 
card. WinDVR 2 includes all of the key DVR features, such as the capability to 
pause live television, perform instant replays, and skip commercials. It also 
includes a task manager, a sleep timer, and a "video desktop" that enables your 
background to be television. WmDVR 2 also has a groovy feature called Channel 
Surfing, where the screen becomes a grid of 16 or more tiny televisions with each 
one representing a still shot of what's on that channel. InterVideo offers a free trial

nanoDVR 
NOTE As with the other software-based MPEG-2 encoder/decoders, 
WinDVR 2 is very much dependent on the speed of the computer it's 
being run on, so again we recommend the use of a high-end PC with 
plenty of RAM if you want to capture DVD-quality video content. We 
discovered that a Pentium III 450 with 256MB of RAM could not capture 
smooth video on the highest setting with WinDVR 2. Although it was 
able to capture the content, frames were dropped, making for a jerky, 
unacceptable result. The lower quality settings, however, were able to 
capture without a drop in frame rate. 
Nanocosmos offers a higher priced DVR software product that enables high-
quality MPEG-2 video capture off of a television signal (or other inputted video 
signal). nanoDVR also offers support for machines with multiprocessors-a rela-
tively rare hardware configuration. However, for those who are serious about 
having a powerful DVR, this software can take advantage of the extra horsepower 
a multiprocessor computer can offer. This software also offers Video CD creation 
and future versions are planned to have DVD exporting enabled. You can check 
out this product at http: I /www. nanocosmos. de. 
SnapStream Personal Video Station 
SnapStream Personal Video Station is another software DVR alternative for your 
HTPC. Personal Video Station is a unique piece of software because it can turn 
your PC into a media server and send television anywhere on your network via 
Ethernet or a wireless 802.11 b network. Best of all, this media server can serve 
multiple viewers at the same time, so if you're lucky enough to have a 100 Mbps 
network wired into your home, you can have your HTPC serve programming to 
multiple locations. As with the other software options, SnapStream's product also 
includes an integrated program guide for easy recording and allows for content to 
be burned onto Video CD. For more information about SnapStream Personal 
Video Station, visit http: I /www. snapstream. com. 
DScaler 
Although DScaler isn't true DVR software, because it has some rudimentary PVR 
functionality and is such a good piece of software-and free-we thought it worth 
mentioning here. DScaler offers video source deinterlacing, inverse telecine detec-
tion, automatic aspect ratio control, and judder elimination. For more information 
on DScaler or to download it, go to http: I /deinter1ace. sourceforge. net.

Video Editing 
When you construct an HTPC, you must ensure that video input is an available 
feature, because having a video card that enables home movies to be imported 
into the HTPC opens up an entire world of home movie editing, not to mention 
exciting digital manipulation of video content. This section of the book discusses 
importing video content onto the HTPC and some of the options available to you 
once you've transferred the content. Technology has come far enough that you can 
make impressive movies complete with professional transitions, alternate sound 
tracks, and special effects. Once you've completed these files, you can convert 
them into Web-based movies, make them into Video COs, copy them back to 
digital camcorder tape orVHS recorders, and even burn them onto DVD format. 
CAUTION While there are some unscrupulous people who pirate copy-
righted material and bum it onto DVD or Video CD to avoid the cost of 
purchasing the programming, we do not engage in or support this prac-
tice. Therefore, this book won't discuss how to manipulate or capture 
copyrighted material for use on an HTPC. 
Importing Video into the HTPC 
There are two basic divisions when it comes to home video editing: digital video 
and analog video. Since many of you are likely to have reams of analog videotape, 
we discuss the conversion of analog video to digital as well as the newer digital 
technologies. 
Importing Digital Video 
Apple Computer led the way in digital video editing when they started equipping 
all of their Macintosh computers with an IEEE 1394 FireWire port, which allowed 
digital camcorders to be connected to the computers with ease. They also included 
a piece of software called iMovie that allowed quick and easy editing of home-
made videos. That was then, and now some years later the PC side of the world has 
caught up with the digital video trend, and currently many new PCs come with 
Fire Wire ports and include video editing software. There are so many, in fact, that 
we can't discuss them all here, but suffice it to say that most of them are most 
certainly acceptable for home use. In order to import digital movies to your HTPC, 
you'll need a few pieces of hardware to ensure an easy transfer of information. 

Video Capture Devices 
NOTE Importing digital video (and audio) from a digital camcorder to an 
HTPC through an IEEE 1394 cable is very simple indeed. Just start the soft-
ware and connect one end of the cable to the PC and the other end to the 
camcorder. In general, the software takes care of everything else. 
Digital Camcorder 
A few years ago a digital camcorder was a rare commodity, relegated to very high-
end equipment from makers such as Sony, Panasonic, and JVC. As with everything 
in the digital age, times have changed rapidly and now the majority of camcorders 
sold are of the digital variety. Digital camcorders are superior to their analog coun-
terparts for a number of reasons, including 
â¢ Digital camcorders have a much clearer, higher resolution picture. 
â¢ Digital camcorders offer many special effects that can be added both during 
and after recording. 
â¢ Digital information doesn't degrade like analog tapes do. 
â¢ As a rule, digital camcorders can be made smaller than their analog coun-
terparts. Some even employ minidisk technology instead of tape. 
NOTE To say that digital data doesn't degrade isn't entirely true. The 
magnetic tape that digital information is stored on does degrade, but 
there are error correction algorithms that can virtually "fix" many errors 
that come about due to magnetic tape decay, thus making the digital 
picture flawless. Analog tape, on the other hand, degrades both with use 
and over time (just sitting on a shelf). For proof of this, simply take a VHS 
tape that has something on it that was recorded 5 or more years ago. The 
quality loss since it was first recorded will likely surprise you. 
If you have purchased a camcorder in the last 3 or 4 years, there's a pretty good 
chance that it's digital, thus making your video transfer task (from the camcorder 
to the PC) very easy indeed.

Chapter6 
154 
IEEE 1394 Fire Wire Port 
The majority of new camcorders being sold today are of the digital variety. Digital 
camcorders have become more popular because of the high quality of the images 
they record and the fantastic flexibility that digital video offers those wanting to 
edit the video later. Most digital camcorders come with an IEEE 1394 Fire Wire port 
(see Figure 6-5), which enables direct and convenient connection to a PC that also 
has a Fire Wire port. This ease of connection makes downloading digital video to 
a PC for editing incredibly simple, and therefore it is our recommendation to use a 
digital camcorder and a PC with an IEEE 1394 port if at all possible. 
Figure 6-5. A Fire Wire cable attached to a digital camcorder 
Fire Wire is a high-performance serial bus, which, like many oftoday's 
computer standards, was invented by Apple Computer. Fire Wire provides some 
key features that make it perfect for managing digital video information. First, it's 
fast. Fire Wire can handle up to a 400 Mbps theoretical maximum of information 
traveling two ways. Second, it's hot-pluggable, meaning that devices can be 
plugged and unplugged from the PC without fear of damaging them (much like 
USB devices). Finally, Fire Wire ports can supply power where necessary, making 
external power supplies unnecessary. 

Video Capture Devices 
While many new PCs are coming out complete with a Fire Wire port, it's a 
safe bet that any PCs more than 1 year old won't have one. Not to worry, you can 
purchase a Fire Wire PCI card for under $50.00 and easily install it into most 
systems. Also, many (if not most) contemporary audio cards (midrange and 
higher) have Fire Wire ports built into them already. 
NOTE Mac users who have used iMovie know well how great a Fire Wire 
connection to a digital camcorder can be. 
Large Hard Drive 
It goes without saying that a large hard drive is necessary whenever video editing/ 
capturing is being considered. Just how much is enough? A good rule of thumb is 
roughly 1.5MB to 2MB of information for every second of digital quality video. 
That means a gigabyte of hard drive space will yield about 8 minutes of high-
quality digital video (complete with transitions and extra audio). If you're planning 
to edit very large amounts of video and have it on hand at all times, you may want 
to consider a RAID for your storage needs. If putting together smaller, 1-hour 
video segments is more your style, then a 40GB hard drive should suffice. 
Transfer Software 
There aren't specific pieces of software specifically designed for transferring video 
from the camcorder to the computer, because virtually all of the video editing soft-
ware takes care of that on its own. We discuss just what these software packages 
are shortly. 
Analog Video Importing 
To manipulate and edit video on an HTPC, you must have the video information 
in digital format. Unfortunately, many home movie enthusiasts have analog video 
equipment that is entirely unable to directly interface with an HTPC. Fortunately, 
there are now myriad products available that can take that crusty old analog video 
and turn it into the wonder that is digital information. There will, of course, be 
some quality loss. That is to say that the way the video looks coming off of the 
analog camcorder into the HTPC is as good as it will ever look, but the upside is 
155 

Chapter6 
156 
that from that point forward the quality will not degrade further. Let's have a look 
at what you will need to get your analog video into your HTPC. 
Camcorder/VCR 
Many home movies are on Hi-8 or regular 8mm tapes, and therefore you'll need a 
camcorder to be able to transfer them into the HTPC. Other camcorders may use 
VHS, VHS-C and, in rare cases, Betamax. Other home movies may have originally 
come from Super-8 film (from the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s) and may now be residing 
on either VHS tapes or possibly even Laserdisc. In short, no matter which format 
the original analog video is in, you'll need the appropriate device to output it to 
the HTPC for conversion into digital video. 
Video Capture Card 
Many of the video cards we've already discussed are fully capable of capturing 
analog video. The ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500/8500, the Matrox Marvel G450 
eT\1, the NVIDIA Personal Cinema, as well as many other cards offer video inputs. 
In fact, some television tuner cards can be tweaked to input analog video into 
an HTPC. There are also stand -alone devices for converting analog video to 
digital-a good example of these is the USB-based Dazzle Video Creator 
(http: I /www. dazzle. com/main. html) series of products. These are all excellent for 
the job and are easy to set up and use, although USB-based units cannot always 
handle the data stream necessary for the highest quality transfers. Ultimately, the 
best way to import analog video is directly in through the video card connected to 
theHTPC. 
Editing Video 
Once the information has been fully transferred to the HTPC, it's ready to be 
edited into a fantastic production that will make viewers laugh, cry, and generally 
be glad you took the time to make it pretty. 
Software 
Many software packages are available for editing video, and we aren't able to cover 
every single one in this book, but we want to give you a feel for just what's out 
there to help you decide what software best suits your needs. 

Video Capture Devices 
Low-Cost Editors 
As we mentioned previously, many, many video editing suites are available for 
most systems. We'll look at a group of what we consider to be the best for the price. 
In other words, our concern is getting the most bang for our buck while consid-
ering such important factors as ease of use and system requirements. 
Pinnacle Systems Studio 
This software package is exceptional because it not only includes solid basic 
editing tools, but it also comes bundled with an IEEE 1394 Fire Wire PCI card. 
Pinnacle Systems Studio offers an excellent timeline system that allows you to 
match up sound and video precisely, and it also allows you to capture individual 
scenes from inside a longer string of video. Perhaps the one downside to Pinnacle 
Systems Studio is its lack of glossy effects and transitions, which are ultimately 
important to the "wow" factor of the fmished movie. You can find more informa-
tion about Pinnacle Systems Studio at http: I lwww. pinnaclesys. com. 
Ulead VideoStudio 5/6 
Ulead VideoStudio 5 is another solid performer for the price, although it has 
roughly the opposite pros and cons as Pinnacle Systems Studio. VideoStudio 5 
has plenty of cool effects and glossy finishing touches, but the timeline isn't as 
refined, making it more difficult to precisely line up special audio and transition 
changes. VideoStudio is the software that comes packaged with ATI's All-In-Wonder 
Radeon 7500/8500 cards, so if you're planning to get one of these cards, you'll kill 
two birds with one stone. As a bundled productVideoStudio 5 is an excellent 
value. 
Ulead has recently released Video Studio 6, which includes a few new features 
such as MPEG-Direct capture, which lets you grab DVD-ready MPEG video straight 
from your DV /DB camcorder or other device, saving you time and hard disk space. 
If you buy an ATI card, you (at the time this book was written) get version 5, but if 
you purchase it from Ulead, then version 6 will be what's for sale. For more infor-
mation, visit http: I lwww. u1ead. com. 
Windows Movie Maker 
Windows Movie Maker is another reasonable tool that comes included with the 
Windows Me OS. While it doesn't have the panache of most of the other video 
editing suites, it's free if you're already using the Millennium Edition of Microsoft 
Windows. For more information, visit http: I lwww. microsoft. com. 
157 

Chapter6 
158 
Roxio Video Wave 5 (Power Edition) 
This video editing software actually straddles the line between the higher cost 
editors and the lower cost editors, but at around $100.00 (when this was written) 
it certainly has a very reasonable price for the features it delivers. Video Wave 5 
offers a plethora of features including DVD authoring, video capture from digital 
or analog sources, effects such as sepia tone and mosaic, and picture in picture 
effects, and it also allows for the creation of DVD menus. This feature set is 
certainly poised for the explosion of DVD burners that will be hitting the market 
as the prices continue to fall in the next year or so. Visit the Roxio Web site at 
http: I /www.roxio.com to learn more. 
VirtualDub 
VirtualDub is one of the freeware video editing suites that, like the freeware 
moniker suggests, is free! Although it isn't as robust or as fancy as Adobe Premiere, 
VirtualDub does the trick and has a feature set that includes the following: 
â¢ Integrated MPEG-1 and Motion-JPEG decoders 
â¢ Removal and replacement of audio tracks without touching the video 
â¢ Extensive video filter set, including blur, sharpen, emboss, smooth, 3 x 3 
convolution, flip, resize rotate, brightness/ contrast, levels, deinterlace, and 
threshold 
â¢ Bilinear and bicubic resampling (no blocky resizes or rotates here) 
â¢ Decompression and recompression of both audio and video 
â¢ Removal of segments of a video clip and capability to save the rest without 
recompression 
â¢ Capability to adjust the frame rate, decimate frames, and perform 3:2 
pull-down removal 
â¢ Capability to preview the results with live audio 
â¢ Integrated volume meter and histogram for input-level monitoring 
â¢ Real-time downsizing, noise reduction, and field swapping 
â¢ Verbose monitoring, including compression levels, CPU usage, and free 
disk space 

Vuleo Capture Devices 
Again, considering this software is free, it's jam-packed with features that will 
cost you considerably more elsewhere. To see the full feature list or to get your 
hands on this software, visit http: I lwww. virtualdub. orglindex. 
TMPGEnc (Tsunamai MPEG Encoder) 
Also freeware, TMPGEnc allows you to convert AVI files to MPEG-1 files (the Video 
CD format). Using a variety of options in TMPGEnc, you can perform high-quality 
compression of your video files. TMPGEnc enables you to adjust bit rate, quantize 
matrix, GOP structure, interlace, and many other parameters. Although it's more 
for the hardcore video editing aficionado, TMPGEnc is a good example of the 
many freeware programs out there. 
NOTE There are a plethora of video editing software packages on the 
Internet just waiting for you, with more being added all the time. Although 
some of them aren't exactly polished, you'll be surprised at how much you 
can get for the only the price of the bandwidth to download the software. 
Higher Cost Editors 
Those with a real penchant for high-end video editing have several excellent 
choices. Perhaps the best choice of all is Final Cut Pro from Apple, but since this 
ultra-high -end software only runs on the Macintosh running OS X, we leave it out 
of the HTPC discussion. Here's a look at four high-end software packages available 
for the HTPC. 
Adobe Premiere 6.5 
This is the granddaddy of PC video editing suites, and its latest incarnation is 
version 6.5. At around $550.00, this is no inexpensive tool, but it's not a penny-ante 
video editor either. One of Premiere 6.5's biggest improvements is the inclusion of 
real-time previews. These allow you to see the changes such as transitions and 
titles instantly. The feature set of Premiere is complex and the learning curve is 
much steeper than with other editors, but the payoff is a studio-quality result with 
many tricks, transitions, and effects that can make a monster movie out of basic 
home movies, which can then be burned to DVD. For more information on 
Premiere, visit http: I lwww. adobe. com. 
159 

Chapter6 
160 
CineStream 3.0 
While a capable software suite, CineStream really can't compete with Premiere, 
and considering the prices are similar, it may not be worth going with the relative 
unknown over the tried and true. Although CineStream has some very impressive 
features, such as Event Stream Technology (the ability to put in links to other 
streaming video inside the finished movie), it doesn't always come together as 
well as it should. To learn more about CineStream, go to http: I lwww.medialOO.com. 
MediaStudio Pro 
This is the higher-end version of the Ulead product that's bundled with the ATI 
cards. At around $200.00, it's a decent value, and it's reasonably easy to learn. 
Still, it can't match the awesome power and functionality of Adobe Premiere. 
One addition to MediaStudio Pro is the inclusion ofVideo Paint, a tool that allows 
you to custom paint in animations on a frame-by-frame basis, which can make 
for some significantly cool effects. If cost is an issue, this is a decent choice over 
Premiere. Visit http: I lwww. ulead. com for further details. 
Vegas Video 2.0 
This entry from Sonic Foundry is an adequate video editing suite for the money. It 
has a relatively easy-to-learn interface and contains editing, transitions, and effect 
extras, but ultimately it's not up to the Adobe Premiere standard. 
Editor Summary 
In summary, the low-cost video editing tools are largely equal, and if high-end 
editing is your bag, we recommend that you open up your wallet and shell out for 
the established leader in this field, Adobe Premiere 6.5. 
Editing Techniques 
There are a number of video editing techniques and extras, many of which are 
proprietary to a specific software vendor. Still, there is a set of basic video editing 
techniques that you should look for in software that will help you to create the 
best home movies possible. 

Video Capture Devices 
Scene Transitions 
Scene transitions are perhaps the most impressive and important part of video 
editing. They take viewers from one scene to another, and if they're implemented 
properly, they do so smoothly and help the video presentation to flow from scene 
to scene. Some transitions will sweep the scene away from left to right, whereas 
others will sweep the screen like a clock, leaving behind the new scene. Still others 
will take the scene and shrink it into a tiny box until it disappears, again, leaving 
behind the new scene. When they're used properly, scene transitions make a home 
video, so it's important that the video editing software you use has a decent selec-
tion of these. 
Audio Layers 
Most editing suites have at least one extra audio track for you to add in music or 
voice-overs, and most have two or more extra tracks. Most software has built-in 
ripping that enables you to put an audio CD into your HTPC and copy the music 
directly to the segment of video that you want to attach it to. We suggest that the 
editing software has at least one extra layer but preferably two or more so that you 
can add in both sound effects and music as you see fit. 
Special Effects 
Special effects vary greatly between software packages, but there are a few tried-
and-true special effects you'll use frequently. In fact, many of the special effects in 
software suites are also available right on digital camcorders. 
Sepia Tone 
Sepia tone is a brownish hue that gives the video a tint much like very old movies 
or photographs have. If you're looking for a black-and-white (actually brownish) 
old-time feel to your videos, sepia is the way to create it. Most video suites have a 
sepia setting, as do many camcorders. 
Mosaic 
Mosaic is a fairly nonfunctional (for viewing detail) effect that breaks down each 
area of the screen into a large block. This gives an image that might look complete 
to someone standing 20 feet away, but close up it's impossible to see any detail in 
it. Still, it's a cool effect and can be worthwhile to use in home movie creation. 
161 

Chapter6 
162 
Streaks (or Trails) 
This is another common special effect that leaves streaks or trails behind anything 
that moves in the video. Again, it's not something that you would be likely to use 
often, but it can be a very effective tool, especially if you're trying to give the 
impression of speed (for example, with someone running a race or a car driving 
fast past the camera). 
Reverse Video 
Higher-end editing suites allow you to tweak the video frame by frame or run 
certain clips backward instead of forward. Bart used this technique when making 
the introduction to a recent video of his children and family. By filming a series of 
events that required animals jumping and objects being thrown, the end result 
when played backward (Bart had to walk backward when he was filming the shot 
to make the backward result look like it was running forward) was a comical scene 
indeed. 
Summary 
In this chapter we looked at various video capture devices, digital video recorders 
(DVRs, also known as personal video recorders, or PVRs), commercial services 
such as TiVo, and importing and editing home videos. We also examined some of 
the software that can help to make your HTPC a master of video editing, recording, 
and playback. The next chapter examines the role of remote controls in making 
the HTPC an easy-to-use home entertainment appliance. 

CHAPTER 7 
Home Theater 
Remote Controls 
MosT OF THE EFFORT of building and configuring an HTPC is concentrated on 
selecting the most suitable hardware, installing the correct software, and then 
spending countless hours perfecting the configuration of the system. Only after 
this great effort has been expended, the machine is working perfectly (or as well as 
it can-some hobbyists never stop tinkering!), and everyone has settled into their 
home theater seating and is waiting for the movie to start, does it become apparent 
that something is missing. Getting out of your chair to start or stop a movie, or to 
change channels is so old-fashioned-no serious HTPC owner can truly have the 
ultimate multimedia experience without a remote control. 
Since the HTPC is, at its heart, a personal computer system, the standard 
way of controlling it is with a keyboard and mouse. Unfortunately, a conventional 
keyboard has a relatively short cable attaching it to the back of the system, and the 
mouse cord is barely any longer. The HTPC must also be connected to a display 
device, so unless the whole home theater room is less than 6 feet long, there is 
not enough cord to reach from the viewer to the HTPC to the television. It is often 
desirable to locate the HTPC beside the other audio and visual equipment to 
which it must connect in the home theater, so the use of a normal keyboard and 
mouse becomes an exercise (literally) in walking back and forth between the 
viewing position and the HTPC. In some home theaters, the HTPC is located 
inside special soundproof cabinetry or in another room entirely, which makes 
the keyboard and mouse even more inconvenient. 
For these reasons it is popular to look for an alternative to the old-fashioned 
keyboard and mouse controls. The HTPC can be as convenient as any consumer 
electronics device or even more so. The PC's customization potential applies to 
all home theater functions, including remote control capabilities. The consumer 
market even seems to be in tune with the HTPC movement as lots of great control 
gadgets and devices are showing up. There are many ways to drive the HTPC from 
the comfort of an easy chair and this chapter examines some of the most popular 
remote control devices. 
163 

Chapter 7 
164 
Wireless Keyboard and Mouse 
The most natural alternative remote controller for a PC is a wireless keyboard and 
mouse. The advantage of using a wireless keyboard and mouse (see Figure 7 -1) is 
that they provide complete control and access to all features of the HTPC just the 
same as using a keyboard and mouse connected by a cable. Recently, these devices 
have become widely available in sets that combine the keyboard and mouse. This 
is a great advantage to the consumer because buying these devices in a set means 
that they will not interfere with each other, and the installation of both is usually 
done simultaneously. Some keyboards even feature a track ball or a directional 
control to replace the mouse, which saves the need for a separate mouse, though 
many PC users may prefer the feel of a traditional computer mouse. 
Figure 7-1. A wireless keyboard and mouse set 
The distance from which these units will work depends on the brand and 
model. The manufacturer usually indicates the effective range on the packaging. 
1\vo types of wireless devices are available: those that use infrared (IR) light and 
those that use radio frequency (RF). Neither has an advantage for control distance, 
but the IR devices will not work through walls, whereas RF devices often will. This 
may have a bearing on home theaters where the HTPC is hidden away behind 
soundproofing or in an adjacent room, but either type is great for allowing the 
user to sit back on the couch and surf the Web, send e-mail, or watch movies. 
Many recent multimedia keyboard models include additional buttons and 
dials that work with PC software to control volume and other functions. This has 

Home Theater Remote Controls 
the potential to make the HTPC very convenient to operate, as commonly used 
features such as "play," "stop," "skip ahead," and the sound volume can be accessed 
without having to use the mouse to minimize the picture and find the appropriate 
button on the screen. However, some users may find that all of the extra buttons are 
not useful, as may of them are configured by default to launch into the manufac-
turer's Web page or a sponsor's online service. For an HTPC configured with only 
a wireless keyboard and mouse, Play buttons and other controls are usually quite 
handy, but if another type of remote control is going to be added, then these extra 
features may be redundant. 
In the past few years a new type of computer mouse has been introduced 
for the PC market. This new type of mouse does not use a small roller ball on the 
bottom to detect movement, but instead uses an optical sensor and a tiny light 
source (see Figure 7-2). These new mice are far less prone to clogging with dirt and 
so they never need to be cleaned and they never stop working due to the buildup of 
crud on the rollers or on the ball. They also work on almost any surface, including 
fabric and other soft or nontlat areas. This optical mouse technology is perfect for 
wireless devices to control an HTPC, since the mouse will most likely be used on a 
couch, a lap, or the arm of a chair where a roller ball would lose surface contact or 
pick up lint and dust. The optical mouse generally means that the wireless set will 
cost a little more, but the greater versatility is worth the price. 
Figure 7-2. The underside of a wireless optical mouse

Chapter 7 
166 
The wireless keyboard and mouse provide the most control over the HTPC, 
but they have some disadvantages. A keyboard and mouse set is much larger than 
a conventional remote control. The set cannot be operated with one hand, and it 
usually takes several mouse movements and clicks to start up a movie, play an 
audio CD, or start up the television tuner. Though the wireless keyboard and 
mouse make it more convenient to control the HTPC, they do not make it simpler. 
In a home theater used by more than one member of the household, the HTPC 
may be too complicated to appeal to everyone trying to simply watch a movie. 
Fortunately, there is a remote control solution to this problem. 
Universal Remote Control with 
an IR Receiver Connected to the HTPC 
Universal remote controls have been available for years, and they are a popular 
way to reduce the number of remote controls needed to operate home theater 
equipment. These remotes can learn the IR codes to operate any television, VCR, 
audio receiver, or other piece of consumer electronic equipment with an IR 
receiver. Some universal remote controls even have codes for popular brands of 
equipment preprogrammed so that they only need to be told what command set 
to use. Anyone who has spent time programming a universal remote control to 
reduce the clutter of remotes in his or her home theater will be pleased to know 
that he or she can configure the HTPC to operate from the same control. 
The great advantage to using a universal remote control is that it is the simplest 
and most convenient method of sending commands to an HTPC. A single button 
on the remote can cause the HTPC to switch to a new video mode, start the DVD 
player, and play the movie in full-screen size. Other buttons can pause or stop the 
movie, increase or decrease the volume, switch to another application to play an 
audio CD or an MP3 track, or even record a television program. Compared to a 
mouse and keyboard, the remote control is far easier to use. It is much easier to 
teach someone how to play a movie on an HTPC if they only have to press one 
button! 
The universal remote control programmed to work with the HTPC can also 
run other home theater equipment. This is a great relief for those who suffer from 
the remote control clutter caused by collecting a different control for each device 
in the room. Universal remote controls vary in complexity, from the simple unit 
capable of learning only a few other device command sets to the complex (and 
expensive) controls with built-in display screens and more processing power 
than computers had a decade ago. Any type of remote can work, but the more 
commands it can store, the more functionality it can bring out of the HTPC. 

Home Theater Remote Controls 
In order to work with an IR remote control, an HTPC must have an IR receiver 
connected to it. Different types of receivers are available, but the most suitable are 
the ones that connect to a USB port or a serial port. Since serial ports are older 
technology they can be a little finicky to configure, and if the HTPC already has 
devices connected to the serial port (most PCs have only two), then a USB versi'On 
is recommended. Many PC IR receivers seem to come bundled with a remote 
control, so it may be a challenge to find one without a controller if you already 
have a universal remote control. 
TIP Though any IR receiver should work with any universal remote 
control, there have been some reports of receivers that cannot capture all 
commands from some remotes. When you select an IR receiver, try to find 
one that is advertised for use with HTPC systems, or at least for use with 
multimedia computers. 
The IR receiver will have software drivers so that the computer system can 
recognize it and receive information from it, but additional software is required 
to convert the IR commands into instructions that start or stop applications or 
trigger functions in them. Many IR receiver/remote control sets include an appli-
cation to do this, but there are also software packages available to enhance the 
features of the remote control. 
One of the best software applications for mapping remote control 
commands to HTPC functions is called Girder, which is available for free from 
http: I /www. girder. nl. Not only can you use this application to connect remote 
control buttons to computer events, but you can also use it to map any input 
from any device, including the keyboard, the mouse, and the remote control. 
Girder also makes it possible to run multiple commands with one button, such 
as a macro that sets a screen resolution, starts the DVD player, and turns up the 
volume. Some expensive consumer remote controls can run macros, but this 
depends on the remote being able to send a series of uninterrupted signals to one 
or many devices. With Girder software, the remote just has to send one command 
to the HTPC, which can then run a preprogrammed series of commands. Like any 
powerful application, Girder takes time to learn and configure, but once it is set 
up, it makes the HTPC as simple to use as a VCR.

TIP If you have a Palm Pilot or a similar handheld computing device, you 
can use an IR booster kit to tum your handheld into a powerful universal 
remote control. TheIR transceiver in most handheld devices generates a 
signal barely strong enough to communicate beyond a yard, so a booster is 
required. These kits also come with software to let you program buttons 
and command macros to control a range of devices suitable for use with 
an HTPC. Life as a universal remote control is a great retirement for an 
otherwise outdated gadget! For more information, check out the Pacific 
Neo-Tek Web site (http: I /www. pad ficneotek. com/products. htm). 
Though the universal remote control is the best solution for the problem of 
operating a complicated HTPC, it does have some limitations. The commands and 
macros take some time to configure in the remote control and in the HTPC soft-
ware. The time it takes to set them all up is easily recovered by the simplicity and 
convenience of using the remote control, but whenever you desire a new feature, 
you must program it into the system. The versatility of a remote control is also 
limited by the fact that the only features you may access are the ones already 
programmed. It is possible to control the mouse pointer with a remote, but it is 
not very easy to use a computer application in this manner. If the HTPC is used for 
video editing, computer gaming, or even just typing e-mail, a keyboard and mouse 
will quickly become the preferred method of input. 
PC Remote Control 
As the multimedia capabilities of the PC platform grow more powerful and the 
HTPC becomes a home theater machine of choice, more devices dedicated to 
increasing its power and convenience will come to market. It is now possible to buy 
remote controls for the PC that look like the remote controls that come with televi-
sions, audio receivers, or DVD players. These remotes are quite convenient to use 
since they have built-in mouse cursor controls, making it possible to move the 
mouse pointer around the screen. This makes it possible to use almost every 
application installed on the PC, though keyboard commands are still difficult or 
impossible to invoke with a small, handheld remote control. Compared to a 
universal remote control that is meant for use with typical consumer electronic 
equipment, the PC remote is more versatile for use with an HTPC. 

Home Theater Remote Controls 
One great advantage that a PC remote offers over a 
universal remote is the potential to use RF instead of IR 
light. The RF signal can pass through walls and other solid 
objects that block an IR signal, which means you can 
locate the HTPC in a separate room or behind soundproof 
materials. Keeping sound levels down is one of the critical 
factors in building a successful HTPC, and being able to 
locate the unit away from the home theater area is one 
possible method of reducing noise. One other advantage 
of using an RF remote is that it does not have to be pointed 
at the equipment to work, though only a very hard -core 
couch potato may appreciate the effort saved from not 
pointing a remote! 
Choosing an RF remote does have one important 
limitation that may make it unappealing for some home 
theaters. Since almost every other device in the home 
theater uses IR signals, the RF remote cannot be pro-
grammed for use with anything else besides the HTPC. 
Selecting an IR device allows for the potential use of a 
universal remote in the future without having to upgrade 
to a new receiver or remote control. 
A novel way around this problem is to use an IR 
repeater to allow the HTPC to send IR signals to other 
devices in the home theater. A keen hobbyist may be inter-
ested in a device called the UIRT2, for which plans are 
available at http: I lwww. case serve. com/ht/UIRT /uirt2. htm. 
This device can send and receive IR signals, and with 
Girder software, it can be used to turn on and control other 
components of the home theater system from the HTPC. 
It even features wake-on-LAN (WOL) so that it can be 
Figure 7-3. The AT! remote wonder, 
a dedicated PC remote that uses 
RF signals to control an HTPC 
controlled from a remote PC on a network. 
A dedicated PC remote also comes with the hardware and software to connect 
and configure the computer. The hardware includes the IR or RF receiver, which 
generally plugs into a USB or serial port. The software includes the drivers to let 
the HTPC recognize that a remote control is attached and usually some sort of 
controller software that can be configured to operate selected applications such as 
the DVD player or the CD audio player. As mentioned earlier, the excellent free 
software controller Girder can take the place of the bundled software controller if 
you desire a more powerful and fully programmable alternative. Figure 7-3 shows 
the ATI Remote Wonder, an example of a dedicated PC remote.

Desktop Sharing: Remote Access Software 
One novel method of remotely controlling an HTPC comes not from the home 
theater world, but instead from the PC world. The ability to control one computer 
from another has existed in various forms almost since the first computer networks 
were built. For the maturing PC platform, you have several options for taking 
control of a computer connected to a network, and since the HTPC is, at heart, 
still a PC, these methods are well suited to it. 
You access a remote computer by installing the appropriate software on two 
machines: the one that will be controlled and the one that will be used to control 
the other. In this discussion, the PC that will be controlled is the HTPC, and the 
controlling PC is any other PC connected to the HTPC via a computer network, 
phone line, serial cable, wireless connection, and so on. The software may simply 
allow the controlling PC to run applications on the HTPC, or it may allow full 
access to the desktop on the HTPC. There are several commercial software pack-
ages that allow different levels of control and that support different connection 
methods. 
NetMeeting 
A few free software products with remote access functionality for Windows users 
are convenient and suitable for HTPCs. Microsoft NetMeeting has a feature called 
Desktop Sharing that simply allows one computer to control the desktop of 
another. NetMeeting is a free component of most recent versions of the Windows 
operating system, and you may upgrade older versions with a free download from 
the Microsoft Web site (http: I /www. microsoft. com/windows/netmeeting/). To use 
NetMeeting to access an HTPC, simply install it and run it once to set it up. In the 
application is a menu command called Remote Desktop Sharing that configures 
the HTPC to share its desktop. You can set a username and password for security, 
or you can leave it accessible to any user of the network. Any other PC on the 
network can then run NetMeeting and connect to the HTPC to take control ofit. 
A little knowledge ofWindows networking is useful here since you must specify 
the network name of the HTPC, or its IP address, to connect to it. 
NetMeeting can be a little tricky to configure on HTPCs running Windows 
2000 or Windows XP. The machine will only accept connections if a valid user-
name, password, and workgroup name is supplied. This information must match 
a user account set up on the HTPC. Also, the machine that is controlling the HTPC 
must be configured to place secure calls. 
NetMeeting and most of the other remote access software for the PC has an 
impact on the performance of the HTPC. Since the machine has to receive and 
obey remote commands at the same time that it is trying to perform its home 

Home Theater Remote Controls 
theater duties, it has a lot more to do than just play a movie or audio CD. On HTPC 
computers that are just barely fast enough for DVD playback, running remote 
access software may be too much work and the video and audio will sputter 
and jerk. A remote access application that offers the ability to run applications 
remotely without having to display the desktop of the HTPC may be a better 
option when performance is at the borderline. 
Another drawback to using a desktop-sharing remote-access application is 
that most of them convert the desktop down to 16-color or 256-color depth in 
order to speed up the performance of the remote display. Sending true-color video 
across a network is not possible with most home LANs, so the color depth must be 
reduced in order to get acceptable display performance without overwhelming the 
network. To top it all off, some DVD players won't even work when the HTPC is 
being controlled by another PC through desktop sharing, though different remote 
access applications may have different results. All in all, NetMeeting is a great tool 
for remotely accessing a PC, but even for free it may not be suitable for all 
intended functions of the HTPC, such as starting and stopping DVD movies. 
Virtual Network Computing 
Another popular remote access application for PCs is called VIrtual Network Compu-
ting (VNC). It is available as a free download from http: I /www.uk.research.att.com/ 
vnc/ for most popular operating systems. VNC allows one computer to control the 
screen of another, like NetMeeting, but it can work from almost any type of remote 
system. It also seems to work better with HTPCs because of lower performance 
impact and less conflict with software DVD players. It is a popular remote access 
tool for HTPC hobbyists, so it is worth a try for any system that needs to be 
remotely operated through a computer network. 
The real convenience of using a remote access software application is not to 
start and stop DVD movies, however. The real power is using it in conjunction with 
an IR or RF remote controller. Media functions can be driven by the small remote 
control unit, but system configuration and maintenance can be done remotely 
via NetMeeting or any other desktop sharing application. Since the HTPC is 
most likely to be located near the home theater display, it will not be in a location 
convenient for prolonged keyboard and mouse access. Also, depending on the 
display quality, it may be much easier to read text on the screen of a remote control 
computer than on the home theater display. Tasks such as installing applications, 
configuring software, copying files, and other maintenance are much easier and 
more convenient with remote access software. With remote access software 
installed, an HTPC doesn't even need a conventional keyboard and mouse 
connected, which may be important for systems that are meant to fit in with 
the home theater decor. 
171 

Chapter? 
172 
The whole concept of using remote access software depends on computer 
network access. The HTPC can be configured with an ordinary network card, such 
as a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet card, a wireless network card, a serial cable, or any 
other form of link supported by the PC platform. Besides allowing the use of 
remote access software, a LAN connection affords an easy method of accessing the 
Internet, transferring files to and from the HTPC, or even playing movies or audio 
files from another PC. Networking an HTPC is a tremendously attractive option, 
and an HTPC that is part of such a computer LAN is a great candidate for remote 
access software. 
The HTPC Project Hardware 
Both of our HTPC project systems will be connected to computer networks, so 
remote access software will be used on each. In addition to the software control, we 
are adding wireless keyboard and mouse sets to each machine and a PC remote to 
our system that features the ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 video card. Since these 
machines are destined for the media equipment racks in our home theater rooms, 
the ability to configure and control them remotely is an important convenience. 
The low cost of wireless devices such as keyboard and mouse sets makes them 
almost too tempting to resist for anyone considering an HTPC system. 
HTPC System 1 
This system is configured with the ATI Ali-In-Wonder Radeon 7500, which comes 
with the ATI Remote Wonder RF PC remote control. The remote control is bundled 
with software that allows full use of the ATI media suite, including their DVD 
player and television tuner. The RF receiver for this unit plugs into a USB port and, 
as we discovered, it is very important to follow the installation instructions before 
jumping in and making this connection. The number of USB ports on this HTPC is 
an issue, since we also want to connect a USB Web cam. With both USB devices 
attached, there are no extra ports available for more accessories unless we buy a 
USB hub to expand the capacity. The Remote Wonder also has a mouse cursor 
control pad in addition to an array of other typical remote control buttons, so it is 
an excellent unit for controlling a PC. 
This system will also have a Logitech Cordless Freedom Optical keyboard and 
mouse set, as shown in Figure 7-4. The Logitech set is also an RF device, but it 
doesn't conflict with the ATI Remote Wonder, though we weren't sure about this 
until we actually set it up for testing. The RF receiver for the keyboard and mouse 
set attach to the keyboard and mouse ports of the computer, so we didn't need to 
use another USB connection. Adding a wireless keyboard and mouse set to an 

Home Theater Remote Controls 
HTPC that already has a PC remote control and NetMeeting is a little bit of 
overkill, but the cost of wireless devices has plummeted in the past few years 
and it is worth the extra convenience. 
Figure 7-4. Logitech Cordless Freedom Optical keyboard and mouse set 
The Logitech keyboard and mouse set includes an optical mouse, which is 
great for use in a home theater room where a clean, flat surface is not always avail-
able. This mouse works on the arm of a chair, the cushions of a sofa, or even on an 
arm or a leg. If a keyboard and mouse is to be the primary means of controlling 
an HTPC, a set with an optical mouse is essential. 
The keyboard from the Logitech set has several shortcut buttons and media 
controls built into it. These are very convenient for controlling the sound volume 
or pausing the playback of a movie or an audio file. In our system, however, they 
are somewhat redundant since we can also control these settings with the ATI 
Remote Wonder, but they are great features for systems without a PC remote. 
To add complete remote control versatility and programmability to this HTPC 
system we will be installing the Girder software. The Girder Web site has a great 
selection of configuration sets available for downloading, including a configura-
tion for the ATI Remote Wonder. This will save us some time when we set up the 
system.

HTPC System 2 
The only wireless remote control device connected to this system will be an IBM 
keyboard and mouse set that we found in a clearance bin at an electronics store 
(see Figure 7 -5). The IBM set has a very compact and reliable keyboard with some 
media controls for volume and playback, and a row of shortcut buttons across the 
top. Compared to the Logitech set used with the first HTPC system for our project, 
this keyboard is smaller and less cluttered. Unfortunately, the mouse included 
with the IBM set has a roller ball to track movement instead of an optical sensor, 
so it will be a little less convenient to use in the home theater room. It's lucky that 
DVD cases make such great mouse pads! 
Figure 7-5. IBM keyboard and mouse set 
The IBM set is also an RF wireless device, and the sensor connects to a USB 
port instead of the keyboard and mouse ports on the back of the HTPC. The 
sensor has buttons to select the wireless channel for the keyboard and for the 
mouse. We found this more convenient than the Logitech set, which lets the user 
set the channel in the software driver. When channel conflicts arise, it is almost 
impossible to use the mouse or keyboard to correct the problem on the computer 
screen if neither device is working. 

Home Theater Remote Controls 
Both systems will have Microsoft NetMeeting installed for remote access from 
other machines. Neither of our HTPC systems will be configured with much disk 
space, since they participate on a network and can play rues from a dedicated rue 
server. Since they are already networked, it is a trivial task to set up NetMeeting to 
allow us to do maintenance and configuration. 
One consideration about remote access software is the location of the other 
computers on the network. If the HTPC is located in the home theater room, and 
other systems are located elsewhere, it can be frustrating to have to constantly 
move back and forth between them. This can happen when the HTPC is being 
used to generate video, compress audio, download rues, install software, or any 
other task that requires intermittent attention from the user. Using remote access 
software to keep an eye on the HTPC and occasionally click a button or change a 
setting is a great convenience. 
Another consideration about remote access software is that some of the pack-
ages will lock the display resolution and color depth of the HTPC desktop. This is 
obviously a major problem for a machine that outputs various resolutions and 
timings to an HDTV display. For both of our HTPC systems, we must remember 
to shut down NetMeeting's desktop sharing before we try to watch DVD movies. 
Summary 
Choosing the remote control devices for our project systems is the last major 
HTPC component selection we will make before assembling the hardware and 
breathing life into these machines. A PC remote control or a wireless keyboard and 
mouse may seem like frivolous accessories for a PC, especially to someone who 
has only had experience with PCs as business tools or game machines. Even many 
new HTPC enthusiasts wouldn't consider these devices as "major" components. 
But a few hours experience with a fully functioning HTPC will convince any user 
of the importance of a convenient way to operate the machine. In fact, without a 
remote control of some sort, it's really not an HTPC at all! 
In the next chapter, the real fun begins. Now that the major components have 
been selected, it is time to begin assembling and configuring the ultimate home 
theater machine.

CHAPTER 8 
Additional Hardware 
Requirements and 
Putting It All Together 
VIDEO CARDS, SOUND CARDS, and other media accessories are the major components 
of a computer system that is destined to be an HTPC. The selection of these parts 
requires a weighty amount of consideration as they affect the capabilities of the 
system more than any other individual component. It is these hardware devices 
that can turn a typical office workhorse PC into a home theater media hub. 
Upgrading the video and sound hardware of a slightly out-of-date home system 
can bring it new life as an HTPC by making it a digital audio and video hub with 
capabilities beyond expensive consumer electronics. As we've explained in the 
previous chapters, the right video and audio hardware doesn't need to be expen-
sive, but you should take some care to find the right components with the right 
features for the purposes you intend to fulfill with your HTPC. 
Of course, the HTPC is more than just a video card, transcoder, and fancy 
sound board. This chapter explores the rest of the hardware that goes into an 
HTPC system and provides some instruction for upgrading or assembling the 
hardware. The computer operating system (OS) for the HTPC is important for 
hardware and software compatibility, and is a potentially controversial topic, so 
this chapter also examines some OS alternatives and their advantages and disad-
vantages. Finally, an overview of computer networking is appropriate in this topic 
area since it depends largely on the additional hardware and the OS selected for 
the system. With the information in this chapter, you should be able to assemble 
the computer hardware and create a basic HTPC system. 
Additional Hardware for the HTPC 
After you've selected the video, audio, and other HTPC-specific hardware, you 
should devote some attention to the more general-purpose components of the PC 
meant for the home theater. This section provides a general guide for PC hardware 
such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and hard disk drives that are 
177 

ChapterB 
178 
appropriate for use in an HTPC. The requirements for features and performance 
of these components are mostly the same as those for any other PC system, 
though a brief explanation of each component and its performance guidelines is 
useful for new HTPC enthusiasts who are considering assembling a system. Expe-
rienced PC hobbyists will be familiar with much of this information, but there are 
a few details specific to the HTPC that will make this section helpful to them. 
The Central Processing Unit 
Most PC users know that the central processing unit (CPU) is the main processor in 
the computer system. It is the computer chip that does most of the work, and its 
performance is the key measurement for the overall performance of the PC. The 
CPU operates at a specified frequency, referred to as the clock speed, where the 
higher the frequency, the faster and more powerful the CPU. For many computer 
users, the fastest CPU is always the best because it makes games play better and 
software run faster. 
CPU Performance Range 
The performance of CPUs offered for sale by manufacturers is constantly climbing 
thanks to improvements in design and manufacturing. One of the founders of 
Intel, Gordon Moore, suggested that the power of state-of-the-art CPUs would 
double every 18 months-this has come to be known as "Moore's Law." It has 
continued unbroken for decades, and there seems to be no end in sight. This is 
great for the computer industry, as better and better products can be sold that 
entice consumers to spend more and more money. But it may be considered a 
little unfair to consumers, who watch in amazement as their expensive CPUs 
become worthless in just a few years. 
For this reason, the CPU in an HTPC does not always need to be the newest, 
fastest, and most expensive unit available. CPUs with enough performance to be 
used in systems with DVD playback have been available for many years. An HTPC 
that is going to be used primarily for watching movies or listening to MP3 or CD 
audio gains no advantage from having a CPU faster than necessary for these tasks. 
Full-screen software decoding of DVD video is possible with a reasonably fast 
video card and a 400 MHz CPU. A video card with hardware MPEG-2 decoding 
features takes more load off of the main system CPU, so that an even slower chip 
can be used. Of course, it is almost impossible to find a brand-new CPU this slow, 
but there are plenty of older computers available that would be suitable for use as 
an HTPC with the right video and sound card upgrades. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Some HTPC tasks will benefit from having the fastest possible CPU. Video 
encoding and (to a lesser extent) audio encoding need more CPU power than 
video and audio decoding. An HTPC that will be used to edit home movies, 
compress video to MPEG or another video format, or compress audio will benefit 
from a faster CPU. In fact, at standard NTSC resolutions and using one of the 
newest CPUs, it is now possible to encode video as fast or faster than it is played 
back. Older systems can take hours to compress a few minutes of video, which 
makes video editing and rendering a slow and laborious task. 
An HTPC with a television tuner card that will be recording video will also 
benefit from a fast CPU. The software that records from television tuner cards or 
from the video inputs of a video card can usually do some kind of real-time 
compression to save disk space, and the faster the CPU, the more compression the 
software can do. This has the benefit of fitting more video into the disk space avail-
able. However, as mentioned in the "Hard Disk Drives" section, hard disk capacity 
is getting cheaper, and it may be easier to double the drive space than to double 
the processor performance. 
One other consideration for CPU performance is that a faster processor will 
handle multiple tasks smoothly. If the HTPC is used to record television broad-
casts while it also plays back MP3 audio or surfs the Web, there will be a noticeable 
performance lag on slower systems. Some users also like to run background 
processes such as SETI@home or the United Devices Cancer Research Project on 
their HTPC since they leave them on all the time. Any concurrent use of the HTPC 
for multiple tasks will benefit from having a faster processor. 
CPU Brands 
There are two popular CPU brands for PC systems commonly available. The prod-
ucts from Intel and from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are both suitable for 
HTPC systems and both manufacturers offer a wide range of CPUs at various 
points on the price/performance curve. Experienced PC hobbyists may have a 
preference for one brand over another, but as each is compatible with the hard-
ware and software needed to build an HTPC, there is no overall consensus about 
which is better. 
The available Intel CPUs are the Pentium III and Pentium 4 series, and the 
Celeron series oflower-cost chips. The Pentium III is still in production (mostly 
just for mobile processors), but the Pentium 4 is priced so low (at comparable 
frequencies) that it isn't very likely that buying a new Pentium III CPU would make 
sense. The Pentium 4 is the premier line of CPUs from Intel, and the top-of-the-
line chip represents the fastest available PC processor on the market at the time of 
this writing. 
17Q 

ChapterS 
180 
Intel markets a low-cost line of processors called the Celeron series. These 
chips are based on the same core technology as the Pentium III, but they have less 
internal cache memory. They are available at higher frequencies than the Pentium 
III, though, and for a lower cost. These chips are a popular choice for HTPC enthu-
siasts on a tight budget. 
AMD markets its PC processors as a low-cost alternative to the Intel products. 
AMD attempts to sell processors with similar power to the Intel chips at lower 
prices for every available frequency offered by Intel. The premier line of processors 
from AMD is the Athlon XP series, and the low-cost line of processors with 
reduced features is the Duron series. As with the Intel products, the frequencies 
and performance available for the low-cost line are several steps behind the 
premier series of CPUs. 
There are some important differences between the CPUs from these two 
manufacturers. The Intel Pentium 4 core uses an architecture that allows for 
higher clock speeds, but it actually executes fewer instructions per clock cycle 
than previous Intel CPUs such as the Pentium III and the Celeron. The AMD 
Athlon XP series, by contrast, can execute more instructions per clock cycle than 
the Pentium 4, but it cannot be manufactured to run at the higher frequencies 
of the Pentium 4. AMD markets their Athlon XP by giving it a number that repre-
sents not the true frequency of the chip, but the frequency of a Pentium 4 at the 
same performance level. This leaves some doubt about which CPU is actually 
faster. 
To add to the confusion, there are some computer tasks where the higher 
frequency of the Intel Pentium 4 CPU is an advantage, and there are other tasks 
where the better performance of the AMD Athlon XP is an advantage. Any task 
that requires a lot of floating-point math, such as 3D rendering or engineering, is 
faster on a Pentium 4 CPU than on an Athlon XP CPU. To counter this disadvan-
tage, AMD has added a special set of CPU instructions known as 3DNow! to their 
CPUs that speeds up 3D rendering for software that supports this special set of 
instructions. Intel has added a special set of instructions to its Pentium 4 CPU 
known as SIMD that works to speed up many multimedia tasks such as video 
encoding and decoding, but like the special AMD set of instructions, it only works 
with software that supports it. It is beneficial to the HTPC hobbyist to install soft-
ware that supports the special instruction set for the processor or to select a 
processor that will achieve a performance benefit with the intended software. 
Overall, just about any CPU manufactured in the past few years is suitable 
for use in an HTPC. Any 400 MHz or faster processor should be able to play back 
DVD video and MP3 audio. If you are planning to use your HTPC to render and 
compress video or to compress video as it is captured, you may want to consider 
buying a faster CPU. Of course, if you are going to use your HTPC to play 
computer games, you will always benefit from a top-of-the-line processor, but 
as every PC gamer knows, there is never a CPU fast enough! 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Random Access Memory and Motherboards 
Personal computers require memory to hold information for the CPU to access. 
The more memory in a computer, the more applications that it can run at the 
same time, and the more information those applications can access. Playing 
media such as DVD video or CD audio doesn't require much memory since the 
information is read from the disc and played almost immediately, but editing 
media files such as pictures, video, or audio can use up huge amounts of memory. 
There are two basic questions to answer when you're considering the random 
access memory (RAM) for an HTPC: "What kind of RAM do I need?" and "How 
much RAM do I need?" The answer to the second question is almost always as 
much as possible, but the answer to the first question is more complicated. The 
type of RAM you can use depends on the choices you made when you selected the 
CPU and the motherboard. 
When Intel introduced the Pentium 4 processor, it also introduced a new kind 
of system memory called Ram bus RAM. The modules that the Rambus RAM are 
attached to and installed into PCs are called Rambus dynamic random access 
memory (RDRAM) modules. At first, the RDRAM was very expensive, so the popu-
larity of Pentium 4 systems was hurt as consumers turned to AMD systems and 
the cheaper synchronous dynamic random access memory (SO RAM) that would 
work with these CPUs. Eventually, Intel offered a way to use the cheaper SO RAM 
with the Pentium 4 processor by introducing a compatible motherboard chipset. 
The result of all of this is that you can build an HTPC with a Pentium 4 CPU with a 
motherboard that uses either SO RAM or RDRAM. 
The memory issue is more complicated than that, however. When the 
Pentium 4 and its RDRAM was introduced, the manufacturers of motherboards 
and CPUs that used the older SDRAM wanted to increase performance to match 
the RDRAM systems, so double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM) was introduced 
to increase the speed of the memory for SO RAM systems. This improvement also 
required a new chipset, so old motherboards that accepted only SDRAM had to be 
replaced with newer motherboards for DDR SO RAM. The speed of both RDRAM 
and DDR SO RAM has moved a few more steps beyond the original specification, 
so now there are a range of motherboards available that support either RDRAM or 
DDR SO RAM at various maximum clock speeds. 
NOTE RDRAM is only available for Pentium 4 motherboards. AMD does 
not support RDRAM for any of their CPU products.

For most HTPC uses, any type of RAM is suitable since the system does not 
need to be an absolute speed-demon machine. Having more RAM is more impor-
tant than having fast RAM. When the available RAM in a PC is filled, the OS will 
swap the least used parts of memory to a swap file on the hard disk drive to make 
more room. This disk swapping is very slow relative to the speed of RAM, and it 
causes a big performance drag on the system. An HTPC with 512MB of SDRAM is 
better than an HTPC with 256MB ofDDR SDRAM because the greater amount of 
RAM will allow for more open applications and less swapping to disk. As with the 
CPU performance, there are some tasks where faster RAM makes a big difference 
(video rendering and compression, for instance), but for most HTPC applications, 
the RAM performance is not a critical issue. 
The standard amount of RAM in personal computer systems goes up continu-
ously. Users with systems that are a year or two old are usually dismayed to find 
that new systems are available with double the amount of memory. Generally 
speaking, an HTPC that plays movies and music does not need much memory. The 
smallest amount of RAM that would be advisable is 64MB, though 128MB is prob-
ably a better minimum if the system will be used for e-mail and Web surfing. An 
HTPC that is used to edit digital pictures or audio should have at least 256MB, and 
for editing video 512MB is a comfortable starting range. The prices of computer 
memory are relatively low, so building an HTPC with a gigabyte of RAM is not 
inconceivable if the machine will be busy recording television shows and editing 
home movies. As with all recommendations in this industry, these figures will seem 
out-of-date within a year of this writing, and the experiences of each individual 
user may dictate that more or less RAM is necessary. 
I 
TIP It is a trivial task to add more RAM to an HTPC if you have built the 
system with the potential for expansion. RAM modules (SDRAM, DDR 
SDRAM, and RDRAM) come in various capacities (64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 
512MB, and so forth), and motherboards come with limited RAM slots, so 
use the largest capacity module in each slot. In other words, to add 256MB 
of RAM, buy a 256MB module instead of two 128MB modules. There is 
usually a small price premium to get a single module instead of two 
smaller ones, but leaving room for expansion is worth the money. 
Hard Disk Drives 
You need to consider a number of issues when you plan the hard disk drive 
capacity of an HTPC. Hard drive capacity has increased to an amazing size in 
the past few years, and there is no end in sight to this growth. It may seem like a 
straightforward idea to throw as much disk space into the HTPC as possible, but 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
this is not always the most efficient or practical solution. Other factors such as disk 
performance, noise and heat levels, and network capacity have a bearing on the 
type of hard disk drive suited to the HTPC. 
Performance 
The performance of the hard disk drive in your HTPC doesn't need to be very high 
if you'll mainly use the system for playing movies or listening to audio. In fact, if 
your machine spends all of its time playing DVD video and CD audio, then it 
barely needs a hard disk drive at all. If you connect your HTPC to a home network, 
it's possible to build an HTPC that boots remotely from the network so it doesn't 
need an internal hard disk. The benefit of this is that there's less heat generated 
inside the system case, so you can have fewer fans, or the fans can run slower and 
create much less noise than in a traditional PC. A diskless HTPC is an extreme 
example of a system optimized for low-noise environments, though such a system 
is not easy to build. 
More commonly, the HTPC will have a small hard disk drive onto which the 
OS and media applications are installed. Ideally, this hard disk drive should be 
quiet, so a low-performance drive that spins at about 5400 rpm is sufficient. This 
is fast enough to play back audio or video files, access the Internet, and perform 
most common HTPC tasks. 
A drive in this performance range will have trouble keeping up with a video 
capture device, however. The resulting video file will have quite a few dropped 
frames, which will make the video look jumpy and could distort the audio. A 
7200 rpm or faster drive would be a better choice for an HTPC system that is 
used to record video, and it also makes a big difference for systems that do video 
rendering and compression, since these tasks involve a lot of continuous disk 
access. The faster a hard disk drive spins, the more noise and heat it generates, 
so there is a trade-off in performance for noise level. 
To counter the increased noise from increased performance, many hard disk 
drive manufacturers offer products with noise-reducing features. These features 
include liquid-filled bearings, special casings, and power-reducing spin-down util-
ities that reduce heating and noise when the drive is not used for a specified time. 
These features increase the cost of the drives slightly, but some users find them 
very effective at reducing noise. Our experience is that nothing in the HTPC is as 
loud as the fans, and reducing heat generation is the most effective way to cut the 
fan noise, so selecting a slow-spinning hard drive is usually the best way to reduce 
noise.

ChapterB 
184 
Size Requirements 
The size of the hard disk drive you need in the HTPC depends on the software 
you've installed, the tasks for which you'll use the system, and the network 
connections available. If you don't connect the HTPC to a network, and you use it 
only to play multimedia content or to access the Internet, then a small drive in the 
10GB to 20GB range is sufficient. This allows room for the OS, applications, and 
some media files such as a collection of compressed audio files or a few video files. 
If you'll use the system to collect audio files, then a bigger drive in the 60GB range 
affords plenty of capacity to store hundreds of audio CDs in compressed audio 
format. If you'll use the machine to store video files, you should consider the 
highest capacity drives of 100GB and more, as nothing seems to fill up a hard disk 
drive like home video and downloaded movie trailers. Some applications allow 
users to store DVD movies on their hard drive, and at 2GB to 4GB each, a medium-
sized collection of 40 DVD movies could fill a single drive! 
For systems connected to a home network, there are even more possibilities to 
consider. The HTPC may be a client on the network that plays media files stored 
on another system. In this case, it is better to add disk storage capacity to the 
computer that serves files instead of adding it to the HTPC. The file server may be 
used to store vast quantities of information, including the media files that the 
HTPC can access and play back in the home theater. This allows for a relatively 
small capacity and low-performance hard disk drive in the HTPC, so that it 
remains quiet and unobtrusive in the home theater room. This means that the 
file server must be left running at all times when the HTPC needs to access media 
files, and unless a very fast (and therefore very expensive) home networking tech-
nology is used, the HTPC would not be able to capture video to the file server and 
would not have much disk capacity to capture to itself. 
The HTPC may also be designated as the media file server for the rest of the 
PCs on the home network. The HTPC would be configured with a large-capacity 
high-performance drive, or perhaps more than one. It would be difficult to build 
such a machine to be quiet enough to live in the home theater room without some 
kind of special soundproofing, such as a cabinet, closet, or small anteroom. 
Despite the noise, this arrangement may be quite appealing because the HTPC 
is the only machine in the household that needs to be left on continuously. 
RAID 
One hard disk drive technique that is worth considering is volume striping, also 
known as RAID level zero (RAID 0). This technique consists of the use of two phys-
ical hard disk drives as one drive volume. The drives are set up so that the PC sees 
only one logical disk drive, and when information is written to the drive, half of it 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
goes to each physical disk. Since the two disks can write the information at the 
same time, performance is doubled. This goes for reading information also. There 
is some overhead processing that must be done to keep the two drives synchro-
nized, so the performance gain is actually not quite doubled, but it is significant. 
There are two ways to create a striped volume: through software or through 
hardware. The software method involves configuring two drives in the OS to 
behave as one drive. The OS must tell the CPU to do some processing each time 
the striped volume is accessed for reading or writing, so a software RAID 0 does 
not perform quite as well as a hardware RAID 0 volume. The hardware RAID 0 
volume uses a special RAID controller that can be added as a PCI adapter card or 
can be built into the motherboard to control two or more disk drives. The hard-
ware RAID controller can also be configured to boot the PC since it does not rely 
on the OS, whereas the software RAID 0 can be accessed only after the OS is 
started. The versions of the Windows OS that support RAID 0 in software are 
Windows NT, 2000, and XP. 
The advantages to using a striped volume are only really worth considering if 
you'll use your HTPC system to capture and render a lot of video. Since the striped 
volume is composed of two or more disk drives, it has the capacity of all of the 
drives combined-that is, you can use two 20GB drives to create a 40GB striped 
volume. Video rendering and compression constantly access the disk drive, so 
the performance gains translate directly into faster file processing. 
A striped volume involves some risk to data, however. If any one of the drives 
that make up the striped volume fails, all of the data in the volume is lost. There 
are variations of the RAID technique that allow for data recovery, but they all 
involve losing disk capacity or performance. It is recommended that a striped 
volume be used only as a temporary capture and processing disk space, not as a 
long-term storage space. 
Other Devices 
A number of other components that go into a PC have some effect on the system 
performance and capabilities. You can add most of these components as upgrades 
to an existing system, but some (for example, the motherboard) are not conven-
ient or simple procedures to replace. It is worth it to carefully consider these items 
before you build your HTPC to make sure that you haven't overlooked any detail. 
Motherboard for Multiple CPUs 
For those rare and uniquely ambitious HTPC hobbyists who plan to work their 
systems very hard, it is worth considering a multi-CPU motherboard. This allows 
185 

ChapterB 
186 
for two CPUs in the HTPC system, which can increase performance for some types 
of activities. Among Windows OSs, only Windows NT and its descendant OSs 
(Windows 2000 and Windows XP) can use multiple CPUs, and only software that is 
written with multiple concurrent execution paths (threads) will take advantage of 
both processors. Alternately, if an application is not multithreaded, then multiple 
CPUs can allow the application to run at full speed on one CPU, while the other 
CPU handles other system processes or other applications. This could allow video 
or audio compression to run at full speed in the background while the user surfs 
the Internet smoothly and without any performance lag. The cost of multiple CPU 
motherboards is slightly higher than that of conventional motherboards, and 
obviously it costs twice as much to buy two CPUs than to buy one, but for hard-
core HTPC hobbyists, the benefits of faster video rendering or smoother activity 
could be worth it. 
I 
TIP The cost of two AMD Athlon CPUs for a multiple CPU system is actu-
ally more than twice as much as a comparable Intel system. You cannot 
use the Athlon XP in a multiple CPU computer-instead, you must use the 
Athlon MP, which costs more than the Athlon XE In fact, the Athlon MP 
costs more than a comparable Pentium 4, so for multiple CPU systems, 
the Intel Pentium 4 seems to be the most cost-effective processor. 
Universal Serial Bus 
Most motherboards sold in the past few years have included at least one (usually 
two) universal serial bus (USB) port. The USB bus is used to connect all types of 
external devices from keyboards and mice to video capture devices and image 
scanners. The USB bus is important for an HTPC because this is where an IR or RF 
receiver for a remote control is connected. Also, a small Webcam for video confer-
encing may be connected to add even more functionality to the HTPC. The USB 
bus transfers data at 12 Mbps and can theoretically handle 127 devices at once, 
though in practice this limit is much lower. In order to connect more devices to 
the bus after all the ports are used, a USB hub must be attached to the bus, or 
additional USB controllers may be added to the HTPC with PCI adapter cards. 
An upgraded version of USB, called USB 2.0, is now available. This standard 
theoretically supports data transfer rates up to 480 Mbps and is backward compat-
ible with the USB 1.0/ l.l standard. USB 2.0 is still quite new, but it is expected that 
there will be many new products and may new categories of USB products made 
to work with the much faster USB 2.0 specification. If the HTPC is going to be 
based on a brand-new motherboard, it is probably going to be worth the effort to 
get a board that supports USB 2.0 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Serial and Parallel I/0 
In the "old days" of personal computers, before the USB bus and before the IEEE 
1394 digital link, the common method of attaching peripherals to a computer was 
through either the serial port or the parallel port. The parallel port was mainly 
used for printers, though there were some diskette-type drives and even CD-ROM 
drives that could attach to the parallel port. The serial port was for modems, a 
mouse, or any other type of device that wanted to interact with the PC. In these 
"modem days" of personal computers, almost all new peripherals are made for 
USB or IEEE 1394 ports, so building an HTPC with a serial or parallel port is not 
really crucial. Many motherboards still have these old-style connections, but 
many manufacturers have announced that in the next year or so they will no 
longer be included. Unless you are going to use your HTPC with a printer that has 
only a parallel port connection or an external modem that works with the serial 
port, adding these connectors is probably not worthwhile. 
Floppy Diskette Drive 
Like the serial and parallel ports, the venerable floppy diskette drive seems 
doomed to obsolescence. Most PCs still seem to have a diskette drive, but when 
was the last time it was used for anything? Transferring files via floppy diskette is 
painfully slow, as the 1.44MB capacity is too small for any media file (except small 
digital photos, perhaps, but even they can fit just a few per diskette) and too small 
for any software installation. Occasionally, a device driver could fit onto a diskette, 
but manufacturers always seem to send CD-ROMs anyway, as they are cheaper to 
manufacture even for a single, small file. For most HTPC systems, a floppy diskette 
drive is not necessary. 
CD and DVD Drives 
Since the most popular use of an HTPC system is to play DVDs, it seems to be a 
foregone conclusion that a DVD-ROM drive is the best removable media drive to 
install. For most systems, this is the ideal drive, but there are other possibilities 
worth considering. 
If you're going to use the HTPC to capture and edit home movies, a CD-R drive 
that can record video to a CD-R disc is a convenient way to preserve or send files 
off of the system hard disk drive. With the right software, the HTPC can even bum 
Video CD or SVCD video discs that play in compatible DVD players. Since a CD-R 
recorder can't read DVD discs, you must install it in addition to a DVD player. It is 
also getting cheaper to buy DVD recorders, though the format wars haven't (at the 
187 

ChapterB 
188 
time of this writing) settled down, so choosing among DVD-RAM, DVD+ RAM, 
DVD-R, and the other formats is not an easy decision. The advantage of a DVD 
recorder is that a separate DVD-ROM drive is not needed, so you can build the 
system with only one removable media drive. There are also combo drives avail-
able that do CD-RW and read DVD-ROM. 
Computer Networking: Hardware to Connect to a Local Area Network 
It is surprisingly inexpensive to add a network card to an HTPC in order to pro-
vide the capability of connecting to a local area network (LAN). Unfortunately, 
it is relatively expensive to buy all the other networking equipment that such a 
LAN requires. The prices for 10/100 Mbps Ethernet cards are so low that the old 
10 Mbps cards have pretty much disappeared. We provide a little more informa-
tion about networking later in this chapter, but we should mention here that 
100 Mbps LAN is about the slowest speed that is convenient for transferring large 
media files across a network. Trying to send hundreds of megabytes across a 
10 Mbps network can take a long time. A gigabyte of data will take around an 
hour to send at 10 Mbps, depending on the amount of other traffic on the 
network. Also, 10 Mbps is too slow to play even NTSC-quality video, so net-
working an HTPC at less than 100 Mbps is not very useful. 
Most computer networking hardware currently available is for Ethernet 
networks and uses unshielded twisted-pair wiring with RJ-45 connectors. For 
those not technically adept at working with computer networks, what is required 
is that a 10/100 Ethernet network card with an RJ-45 connector is used in the 
HTPC. This should provide compatibility with the vast majority of home 
networking equipment available. 
I 
TIP The R]-45 connector at the end of the computer network cable looks 
like an oversized telephone plug. The receptacle on the Ethernet network 
card, therefore, looks like an oversized telephone jack. There are other 
(older) types of computer network cabling available, but the type that 
uses the R]-45 connector is now the most common. 
Ten years ago it was very rare to see a computer LAN in the home, but with the 
growing popularity of the PC and the falling costs of LAN hardware, it is now a very 
attractive convenience to set up a LAN at home. Many new homes are built with 
network cabling inside the walls, and it is possible to retrofit cabling in older 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
homes or just use a wireless connection. The HTPC is a valuable addition to a 
home network because of its potential as a media file server or as an unmatched 
media player for files from another server or from the Internet. 
Computer Cases 
There seem to be two approaches to selecting the computer case needed for an 
HTPC. The first approach is to regard the HTPC primarily as a computer. The 
machine needs no special case since it is plainly a computer, and trying to disguise 
it or make it look inconspicuous defeats the purpose of having a computer next to 
the television or video projector in the home theater. Computer cases are available 
as either tower or desktop models, though most can be arranged either way, so the 
hobbyist need only select a case that fits the location of the system. Lately, cases 
have begun showing up in all sorts of colors and with neat transparent panels or 
glowing lights, which can help the machine fit into the room's decor but can also 
distract viewers from what they are meant to be watching. A plain beige tower case 
is the cheapest, simplest and, for many hobbyists, the ideal HTPC covering. 
The other approach is to regard the HTPC as one of the audio/video compo-
nents of the home theater and to try to find a case that fits the style, size, shape, 
and color of the other devices on the equipment stand. The design of consumer 
electronics products is anything but utilitarian-matching shades of black, gray, 
or silver with color-coordinated LED displays make the home theater equipment 
look purposeful and powerful. A big beige tower case would contrast badly with an 
otherwise perfectly harmonized set of components. 
For appearance-conscious home theater enthusiasts, the world of HTPC cases 
is becoming friendlier all the time. Several companies make computer cases espe-
cially for HTPC systems with great features such as clean face plates and digital 
alphanumeric displays instead of the typical incongruous power and hard drive 
activity lights, or a power and reset button beside a row of removable device bay 
covers. These specialized HTPC cases are usually priced higher than standard PC 
cases, but they do improve the appearance of the system by quite a margin. 
One big problem with all PC cases, including the specialized HTPC cases, is 
that they tend to be very large compared to an audio receiver or a DVD player. 
The sizes of the computer motherboard and the adapter cards that must fit inside 
the case limit the size to which it can be shrunk. The current standard for mother-
board size is the ATX form factor, and every computer case that conforms to the 
standard must be at least large enough for the motherboard and other compo-
nents that fit inside. 
The alternative is to build a system based on the microATX form factor or the 
FlexATX form factor. The microATX form factor is smaller than the full-size ATX 
motherboard specification, so the cases meant for these smaller motherboards are 
189 

ChapterB 
190 
smaller. The FlexATX form factor is smaller yet, as it is meant for rack-mounted PC 
systems. Though these cases are not designed specifically for HTPC use, they do 
have some advantages when used for this purpose. The smaller case requires a 
smaller, quieter fan to move enough air through it to cool the system. The smaller 
case is also more portable, which may not be much of an issue for most HTPC 
hobbyists, but it is also more likely to fit into a cabinet or stand meant for other 
consumer electronics components. Unfortunately, the selection of microATX and 
FlexATX motherboards is rather limited, and few of them seem to have a proper 
Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) video card slot, so their appeal may be limited for 
those hobbyists looking to put a cutting-edge video card into their system. 
Cooling 
TIP The world of specialized HTPC computer cases is so new that most of 
the current manufacturers are not well known in North America, and 
more and more are available all the time. The best way to find out what is 
out there is to do a Web search on the topic "HTPC case." 
The issue of cooling the components inside a computer case is usually dealt with 
by suggesting additional fans to draw air in or more fans to blow air out. Unfortu-
nately, adding fans to an HTPC system is not really desirable, as the system is 
meant to be as quiet as possible. Adding one fan may not seem like much of a 
noise increase, especially to computer operators used to sitting in an office with 
air conditioning and other noises constantly drowning out the hum of the PC fan, 
but in a quiet home theater one fan can be annoying. Even the power supply fan 
that most PCs have can be heard quite easily during quiet sections of a movie or 
audio track. The goal is to not only avoid adding fans, but also reduce the noise 
coming from the existing fans. 
Heat is generated by the components inside the computer case. The most 
prolific heat generators are the power supply, the CPU, the hard disk drive, and the 
video card. All CPUs and many video cards available today have a heat sink and 
small fan attached to help dissipate the unwanted heat. Choosing a video card 
with no heat sink fan can easily eliminate one source of noise from the system, 
though it is not always possible to get the desired video performance this way. 
Removing or disabling the CPU fan or the power supply fan is not an option, since 
the computer will quickly overheat and become unstable, or even sustain damage. 
It is possible to run the HTPC with power-saving features that slow down the 
CPU fan. This can reduce the noise volume substantially, so it is important to 
select a motherboard that allows you to set the fan speed or that can automatically 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
slow down the CPU fan when the system is not working hard and generating a lot 
of extra heat. It is also possible to get quieter power supply fans that use special 
rotor bearings or spin at a lower rate to reduce noise. Some HTPC hobbyists have 
built custom wiring in the power supply to provide a lower voltage to the fan 
to slow it down, though this is not recommended as there is a potential for 
unchecked heat buildup if the fan is not blowing the amount of air called for 
in the design specification. 
A more unconventional way to cool an HTPC is to add a water cooling kit to 
the PC case. This is similar to the water pump in a fish tank: It circulates water 
to special heat sinks that fit onto the CPU, hard disks, and other heat-generating 
components. The water is then passed through a radiator to cool it down again. 
With no fans, this method can yield a system that is almost silent, though care 
must be taken to find a quiet water pump. There are even systems that go one step 
further and add refrigeration to the case, though these are meant more for hobby-
ists trying to over-clock their systems than for home theater enthusiasts trying to 
watch a DVD movie. 
Perhaps the ultimate solution is to build an enclosure for the HTPC that allows 
for air to circulate (perhaps from another room) but does not allow sound to escape 
into the home theater. Any heavyweight HTPC with multiple hard disk drives and a 
powerful video card will not survive without an additional case fan (or fans), which 
will make the machine seem deafening compared to the quiet sections of movies or 
audio programs. Some hobbyists have experimented with putting the HTPC in an 
adjoining room and controlling it with an RF remote control or a keyboard and 
mouse. Some have cabinets with the front fully enclosed by glass and the back 
open for cooling and connecting the wires. An even more drastic solution is a 
hushbox, an enclosure for the HTPC that is soundproofed with foam or thick 
material, but keep in mind that the HTPC does require fresh air circulation, and 
any openings for air will admit the fan noise into the home theater room. Cooling 
an HTPC is a fine balance between air circulation and noise generation. 
Assembling an HTPC: A Few Key Procedures 
Those with experience building PCs know that the topic of hardware assembly is 
so big that more than a few large volumes are already dedicated to the subject. 
It is not our intention in this chapter to cover the basics of putting a computer 
together, since that could easily be a book on its own. Some hardware assembly 
procedures are particularly relevant to HTPC systems, however. These procedures 
are either very common when building an HTPC, such as upgrading a video card, 
or very proprietary to an HTPC, such as connecting an optical digital audio cable. 
Most of these procedures are simple and quick to perform, but having them 
191 

Chapter a 
192 
explained and illustrated can help to bolster the confidence of any hobbyist faced 
with a new task. 
Unlike most other electronic equipment, the PC is meant to be opened up and 
modified by the user. This does not mean that the inside of a computer system is 
always a friendly or accident-proof environment, though. These procedures require 
due care and constant attention to detail. It is possible to damage components 
inside a computer case with an insignificant spark from a static electricity 
discharge or by installing the components incorrectly. Any mistakes or malfunc-
tions caused by the user accessing hardware inside the computer case are generally 
not covered by any manufacturer's warranty. If you decided to proceed with these 
hardware upgrades, you must do so at your own risk. 
The general guiding principal of working on computer hardware is to proceed 
slowly and carefully. It is worth taking extra time to think through a procedure 
before performing it because doing so often means doing it right the first time. 
Also, it is important to pay attention to small details as the work progresses. The 
tasks explained in this chapter are fairly simple, but they do involve several steps, 
and making a small mistake early on can result in your having to undo everything 
in order to correct it. 
TIP Personally, we find installing new hardware very exciting because 
we're always thrilled with the expectation of a substantial performance 
gain. We also find it intimidating, because we're never sure if our expensive 
new toy works until we've installed and configured it. This makes it 
tempting to rush through the procedure to get to the results, but we've done 
this enough to know that rushing is the worst way to work. At the very 
least, we recommend reading through all the manuals and enclosed litera-
ture that accompany new hardware. This forces you to know what to 
expect, and it can often provide valuable information that would other-
wise cause problems. You'll find that taking the time to read the manual 
will usually make the actual installation process go faster. 
It is important that you have all the tools and equipment necessary for the 
hardware upgrade on hand before starting. There is not much required, but having 
the proper tools in front of you saves you frustration and time during the work. 
Here's our recommended list of equipment for simple HTPC hardware procedures: 
â¢ Screwdriver: You'll use this tool to open and refasten the case cover. 
â¢ Needle-nose pliers or large tweezers: You'll use this tool to retrieve screws 
dropped inside the case. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
â¢ Flashlight or adjustable desk lamp: A hands-free flashlight or lamp makes 
it easier to see small details inside the shadowy corners of the computer 
case. 
â¢ Scissors or sharp knife: This tool should actually never even come close to 
the HTPC case, but it is handy for opening hardware packaging. 
After you have tinkered around inside the guts of computer systems for a few 
years, you will invariably have a collection of extra screws, mounting rails, wires, 
and other small bits that seem to have no use until they go missing. A few clean 
glass jars (or any other transparent container) with lids make great storage 
containers for these bits. Saving the small items can really save you time down 
the road when you try to install a hard disk drive, a DVD drive, or another item 
that came with no mounting screws or data cable. 
Installing or Upgrading an AGP Video Card 
The procedure for installing an AGP video card is pretty straightforward and 
simple, but for anyone who has never opened a computer case, it can be intimi-
dating. Upgrading a video card is a popular way to improve the performance of 
an HTPC or to begin to turn a conventional office machine into an HTPC. It is an 
essential process that every HTPC hobbyist should feel comfortable doing, and 
after one or two journeys into the inner space of a computer case, almost everyone 
will. In this hobby, most participants already know their way around, but as the 
hobby grows and entices more and more participants, there are eventually going 
to be some who did not start out as computer experts. Fortunately, installing or 
upgrading a video card is the sort of easy task that almost anyone can do. 
Before you begin any hardware procedure on a computer, it is important that 
you double-check that the hardware to be installed is compatible with the 
computer. For AGP video cards, this means checking that the AGP version of the 
video card is supported by the AGP slot on the computer motherboard. The moth-
erboard manual, or the manual that came with the system, should list the features 
of the system near the beginning of the booklet. The first version of AGP (AGP 1.0, 
also referred to as AGP 1X/2X) featured a 3.3 volt bus. The next version (AGP 2.0, or 
AGP lX/ 2X/ 4X) used a lower voltage of 1.5 volts. The AGP 2.0 slot has an extra tab, 
and the video cards have an extra notch along the connector edge. The AGP Pro slot 
has an extra length of connectors but is backward compatible with AGP 2.0 video 
cards. The AGP Pro slot usually has a paper or plastic cover over the extra length to 
prevent AGP 2.0 video cards from being inserted incorrectly. Some AGP video cards 
will work in either an AGP 1.0 or an AGP 2.0 slot. The latest development, AGP 3.0, 
has now been implemented on some video cards and motherboards, and it allows 
for speeds of 1X/2X/4X/8X. 
193 

Chapter8 
194 
It's important to check the specifications of the video card you're installing, 
and the slot on the motherboard, to see that they're meant for each other. In the 
absence of the proper manuals, it may be possible to determine the compatibility 
from the labeling printed on the motherboard and video card or from the relative 
size and shape of the slot and connector. The risk is that some AGP 2.0 video cards 
that can only work at 1.5 volts will fit into an AGP 1.0 slot running at 3.3 volts, 
which could cause damage to the video card and the motherboard. Usually, when 
you install something, if your computer doesn't boot up right away normally, you 
should tum it off immediately to prevent damage. In cases like this, you should 
undo the procedure or at least review it to find the problem. 
Installing the Hardware 
When you have the required tools at hand, you have turned off and disconnected 
the HTPC from the power cable, and you have the new AGP video card standing by 
for installation, follow these steps for upgrading the video card: 
1. 
Check that the HTPC is powered off and disconnected from the power 
cable. We can't emphasize this enough! 
2. 
Lay the HTPC flat so that the case cover is on top, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
It's easier to work inside the computer if the open part is facing up. 
Figure 8-1. Lay the case flat to allow easy access and good lighting. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
3. 
Remove the screws holding the case cover onto the case. There are many 
styles of cases and coverings, so you may have to check all around it to 
find the correct screws to remove. Generally, the screws are at the back 
(see Figure 8-2), the bottom, or sometimes the bottom sides of the case. 
Figure 8-2. Look for the case-cover screws at the back of the case. 
4. 
After you remove the screws, gently push the case cover until it slides off. 
Ground yourself by touching either the bare steel within the case or a 
static strip. 
5. 
Find the AGP video card or the empty AGP slot on the motherboard (see 
Figure 8-3). Chances are that you already have an AGP video card in the 
system if it has an AGP port, but some systems have built-in video or a 
PCI video card that could have an empty AGP slot. 
195 

ChapterB 
196 
Figure 8-3. An AGP video card slot 
6. 
Remove the existing AGP video card or disable the built-in video feature 
of the motherboard. Removing an AGP card is usually a simple process 
that consists of unscrewing the mounting screw from the bracket at the 
back of the case, as shown in Figure 8-4. Some AGP cards are fastened 
with an extra plastic collar around the slot, so check for more screws 
securing the video card where it attaches to the motherboard. The flash-
light or desk lamp will come in handy now. 
7. If the motherboard in the HTPC features a built-in video chip that uses an 
internal AGP bus, it must be disabled. Finding a motherboard with a built-
in AGP video chip and an empty AGP slot is relatively rare; usually a 
built-in AGP video chip means that there is no AGP slot. For systems like 
this, it may still be possible to disable the AGP video and install a PCI video 
card. In many systems, as soon as an AGP card is detected in the slot, the 
onboard AGP shuts down. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Figure 8-4. Remove the screw from the mounting bracket. 
NOTE Though a PC can have only one AGP video card, it supports multiple 
PCI video cards. Most recent versions of the Windows OS can detect and 
configure multiple video cards quite conveniently. They also support one 
AGP video card and one or more PCI video cards, so it is not strictly neces-
,_ sary to disable an onboard AGP video chip in order to use a PCI video card. 
8. 
Disable the built-in AGP video card either by setting a jumper on the 
motherboard or by changing an option in the system BIOS configuration. 
Either way, consult the motherboard or system documentation to find 
out how. 
9. 
Insert the new AGP video card into the AGP slot. The connector may be a 
very tight fit, and sometimes the mounting bracket that faces the back 
of the case is tricky to push in. The best method is to keep the card as 
straight as possible, line the bracket up with the empty gap on the back 
of the case, and push it straight into the slot, as shown in Figure 8-5. 
197 

ChapterB 
198 
Figure 8-5. To insert the AGP video card, start with the card in this position 
and push straight down. 
10. The video card should sit in the AGP slot with the metal connectors all 
hidden inside the slot, and the mounting bracket at the back of the case 
should be seated flush against the case. Put a screw into the appropriate 
hole to attach the mounting bracket to the case. 
11. Replace the case cover and put the screws back in to hold the cover in 
place. Most experienced PC technicians leave all but one or two screws off 
in order to facilitate faster access next time, which is a helpful technique if 
you plan to access the inside of the HTPC again soon. 
12. Some technicians also prefer to leave the case cover off until they boot the 
PC and confirm that the new hardware is working. If you feel doubtful 
about the installation of the hardware, and you don't mind booting the 
computer with the case off, this could save a little time if there's a problem 
with the new video card. 
13. Finally, plug the power cable back into the HTPC and reconnect it to the 
monitor, the sound system, and whatever else it connects to. The machine 
is now ready for you to turn on and configure with the new hardware. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Configuring the Hardware 
When you turn the computer on for the first time after you upgrade the AGP video 
card, it should boot up normally at first. If you see the display showing the normal 
boot information from the motherboard BIOS and then the OS, then the video 
card is installed properly. Alternately, if you see no image on the display, and if you 
hear a series of beeps, then the new video card is not working properly. In this 
situation, it is important to power down the computer right away and unplug it 
from the power cable. 
Some common problems that cause the video card to not work are easy to 
fix. It is possible that the card is not seated properly in the AGP slot: If it was not 
pushed down all the way into the slot, or if it was misaligned in an AGP Pro slot, 
it will not work. You can fix this by opening the case up again, removing the new 
video card, and reinstalling it. Some motherboards may flex when the card pushes 
into the AGP slot, preventing it from seating fully into the slot. Some video cards 
may fit very tightly into the AGP slot and require very firm pressure to install. You 
can overcome this by gently and slowly rocking the card along the direction of the 
slot as you apply pressure to seat it. This situation can be very precarious, as too 
much force can cause damage to the slot or the motherboard, so double-check 
that the card is meant for the AGP slot and is aligned properly. 
Some video card problems aren't easy to fix and require replacement of the 
card. If the card doesn't work after you've tried a few times to reseat it, or if it looks 
like it's seated properly but still doesn't work, then you should return or exchange 
the card. If the voltage of the AGP slot doesn't match the card, then the system will 
either refuse to boot up or be very unstable. In this case also, you must return the 
card or exchange it for a compatible model. 
If the system starts up normally and loads the OS, then you must configure 
the OS for the new video card hardware. All versions of the Windows OS since 
Windows 95 are capable of detecting new video hardware and prompting for the 
installation of video drivers. These are normally provided on a CD-ROM, which 
you can insert when the OS prompts for it. After the drivers are installed, Windows 
will need to reboot to load the new video driver. 
The OS drivers are not the end of the software configuration of new video 
hardware. Often, video cards are supplied with a suite of utilities and applications 
that provide extra settings and features for the new hardware. You also install these 
utilities and applications from the CD-ROM that came with the hardware. If these 
extra software accessories do not include DirectX drivers, then it is a good idea to 
reinstall DirectX after you install the other utilities. DirectX is a hardware appli-
cation program interface (API) that allows software to use the system hardware 
directly, which improves performance for computer games and other video or 
audio applications such as DVD movie players or MP3 players. The DirectXAPI 
is available from the Microsoft Web site (http: I lwww. microsoft. com) as a free 
download.

Connecting a VGA-to-Component Transcoder 
Compared to installing a video card, connecting a transcoder is a breeze. There 
are no screwdrivers, case covers, or hardware drivers involved, and you can do 
the whole procedure in less than a minute. There are some tricky connections, 
however, and the whole procedure can take a lot longer than a minute if you don't 
approach it with the same care as a video card upgrade. 
The key to making the connection from the VGA output of a video card to the 
component input of a television is to start with the HTPC system set to the right 
screen resolution and timing. The high-definition television specification allows 
for several different resolutions, but only one of them has foolproof compatibility 
between the HTPC and the high-definition display. Before you try to connect a 
transcoder for the first time, you should set the HTPC to display 640x480 at 60 Hz. 
This is not an interlaced video mode, so this will only work with display devices 
that are capable of showing a progressive-scan picture. In other words, this mode 
will not work with a standard NTSC television. 
NOTE Some standard NTSC televisions have component inputs, but they 
can accept only an NTSC signal. The display device must be an HDIV-
compatible device in order to work with a VGA-to-component transcoder. 
It is possible to output an NTSC signal through a transcoder (the HTPC 
must be set to display 640X480 interlaced video), but most video card 
drivers do not allow interlaced video modes at this resolution. 
It is easiest to have a PC monitor hooked up to the HTPC when you are first 
configuring it for use with the transcoder. When the video mode is set to 640x480 
at 60 Hz, you can disconnect the monitor and connect the transcoder. Technically, 
it is always best to power down equipment before you make any connection, so 
you should shut down the HTPC before switching to the transcoder. You use a VGA 
extender cable to connect the output of the video card to the VGA input of the 
transcoder, as shown in Figure 8-6. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Audiofi}Authority " 
Figure 8-6. The VGA cable connects to one end of the transcoder. 
The next tricky part is connecting the three-part component cable from the 
output of the transcoder to the input of the television. One of the cables carries a 
black-and-white version of the video signal, and the other two cables carry color 
information. The three connectors on the transcoder and on the television may be 
labeled as Y-Pb-Pr, or they may be color-coded green-blue-red or yellow-blue-red. 
The difficulty comes when one device is labeled and the other is color-coded. The 
Y label corresponds to the green connector, the Pb to the blue connector, and 
the Pr to the red one. 
If the connectors are not properly arranged, the resulting video image will have 
inaccurate color, or no picture at all. If the color is wrong, the display will show red 
and yellow shades where blue and green should be. In this case, the Pb and Pr 
cables are reversed, and you can switch them to correct the problem. If there is 
no picture, then theY cable is connected improperly. 
CAUTION It is also possible to make the connections one at a time while 
the television is turned on, though this is not really a good idea unless you 
have already confirmed that the video signal being output by the HTPC is 
compatible with the display device. 
201 

ChapterS 
202 
When you have completed the connections, you should plug the transcoder 
into the power supply, and you should plug the power supply into the wall outlet. 
You should turn on the television and set it to display the picture from the compo-
nent inputs used by the transcoder. Finally, you can turn on and boot up the 
HTPC. 
The boot screen and introduction screens of the Windows OS should display 
normally on the television, as they are not high-resolution video modes. When the 
OS is finished booting and the desktop is displayed, the HTPC will kick over into 
the 480p mode that it was set to before connecting the transcoder. This mode 
should display clearly on the HTPC, but if the picture is distorted or completely 
obscured, or if the television picture goes black or the set makes any unusual 
noises, you should turn it off immediately. 
In the case of problems displaying the 480p mode, you may reconnect the 
computer monitor to confirm that the proper video mode is being output. If 
the video mode is correct, then the display device is not compatible with a 
progressive-scan video picture and should probably be used with an S-video 
cable instead of a transcoder. 
Some transcoder models feature small dials to control the picture center on 
the display screen. Since the video utilities for HTPC systems also allow this 
control, it is not necessary to adjust this dial frequently. You can set it to a fairly 
centered location and then fine-tune it with the HTPC software. Each video mode 
will probably require adjusting, so preserving the adjustments in software is much 
more convenient than playing with the transcoder dial after every mode switch. 
Installing or Upgrading a Sound Card 
The process of installing or upgrading a sound card in an HTPC is very similar to 
the process of upgrading an AGP video card. Sound cards that fit inside the HTPC 
case are made for the PCI bus slots on the motherboard. PCI slots look different 
from the AGP slot, and since there are usually five or more of them, it is not neces-
sary to remove any existing adapter cards from the system unless an existing 
sound card is no longer desired. Like the video hardware, some motherboards 
feature built-in sound hardware that can be disabled. Since the Windows OSs can 
support more than one sound card, the built-in sound hardware can also be left 
active in addition to the new sound card. 
The PCI bus does not have the compatibility issues that the AGP bus slot has, 
so the only real requirement you need to check before starting is that there is at 
least one free PCI slot in the system. You can determine this by looking at the back 
of the case where the metal mounting brackets cover the adapter slot openings. 
Most computer systems manufactured in the past few years have motherboards 
with four or five PCI slots, so if there are fewer than four mounting brackets with 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
connectors on them, then there is probably at least one free PCI slot.This method 
is a general appraisal, however, as there are many types of PCI adapter cards that 
do not have connectors on the mounting bracket. Ultimately, the only way to 
know for sure is to open the case and look inside. 
I 
TIP The steps for installing a PCI sound card are generally the same as 
those for installing any PCI adapter card. 
Installing the Hardware 
Gather the required tools, turn off the HTPC, and disconnect the HTPC from the 
power cable. When you have the sound card ready for installation, follow these 
steps: 
1. 
Check that the HTPC is powered off and disconnected from the power 
cable. We can't emphasize this enough! 
2. 
Lay the HTPC flat so that the case cover is on top, as shown in Figure 8-7. 
It is easier to work inside the computer if the open part is facing up.

3. 
Remove the screws holding the case cover onto the case. There are many 
styles of cases and coverings, so you may have to check all around it to 
fmd the correct screws to remove. Generally, the screws are at the back 
(see Figure 8-8), the bottom, or sometimes the bottom sides of the case. 
Figure 8-8. Look for the case-cover screws at the back of the case. 
4. 
After you remove the screws, gently push the case cover until it slides off. 
Ground yourself by touching either the bare steel within the case or a 
static strip. 
5. Find an empty PCI slot on the motherboard (see Figure 8-9). The best slot 
for a sound card is at the very bottom of the case or the slot farthest from 
the power supply. The sound card is susceptible to interference from 
other devices in the system, so try to isolate it as far from the rest of the 
components as practical. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together

6. 
Remove the existing sound card or disable the built-in audio hardware 
of the motherboard if desired. Removing a PCI card is usually a simple 
process that consists of unscrewing the mounting screw from the bracket 
at the back of the case. The PCI slots can be quite sticky, so you may need 
to use moderate force to remove the old sound card. 
7. 
Disable the built-in audio hardware either by setting a jumper on the 
motherboard or by changing an option in the system BIOS configuration. 
Either way, consult the motherboard or system documentation to find out 
how. If the setting is in the BIOS, you can adjust it when you boot the 
system. 
8. 
Insert the new sound card into the PCI slot. The connector may be a very 
tight fit, and sometimes the mounting bracket that faces the back of the 
case is tricky to push in. The best method is to keep the card as straight as 
possible, line the bracket up with the empty gap on the back of the case, 
and push it straight into the slot, as shown in Figure 8-10. 
205

tion and push straight down. 
9. The PCI adapter card should sit in the slot with the metal connectors all 
pushed inside the slot, and the mounting bracket at the back of the case 
should be seated flush against the case. 
10. The sound card requires an analog connection to the CD or DVD drive in 
the system in order to play audio COs in the conventional manner. The CD 
or DVD drive actually decodes the digital audio and sends it via a three-
or four-wire connector to the sound card. The cable (see Figure 8-11) is 
usually included with the CD or DVD drive, and the connector fits into a 
jack on the sound card and into a similar jack on the back of the drive. 
The audio information on a CD may also be sent digitally to the CPU and 
decoded for the output via the sound card. For this process, the analog 
audio connection is not required, but it is usually a good idea to connect it 
anyway. 
11. Screw in the sound card, replace the case cover, and put the screws back 
in to hold the cover in place, or leave the case open until you confirm that 
the new hardware is successfully installed.

12. Finally, plug the power cable back into the HTPC and reconnect it to the 
monitor, the sound system, and whatever else it connects to. The machine 
is now ready for you to turn on and configure with the new hardware. 
Configuring the Hardware 
If the new sound card has a hardware failure, the HTPC will beep or display an 
error message, and it will likely not boot into the OS depending on the severity of 
the problem. If the card is working properly, then there will be no indication of it 
until the OS starts up and detects new hardware. Insert the CD-ROM included 
with the sound card when you are prompted by Windows to load the new audio 
drivers. In many cases, Wmdows will already have a driver that works properly 
with the audio hardware, but installing the manufacturer's software and utilities is 
a good idea in order to gain access to all the features of the new hardware. As with 
video card configuration, the extra features are usually installed from the CD-ROM 
disc after the basic drivers have loaded. 
Some common problems that cause a PCI adapter card to not work are easy to 
fix. It is possible that the card is not seated properly in the slot, if it was not pushed 
down all the way or if one end is seated higher than the other. You can fix this by 
opening the case up and reseating the card. Some motherboards may flex when 
the card pushes into the PCI slot, preventing it from seating properly. Some audio 
cards may fit very tightly into the PCI slot and require firm pressure to install. You 
can overcome this by gently and slowly rocking the card along the direction of the 
slot as you apply pressure to seat it.

Connecting a Sound Card to an Audio Receiver 
There isn't much to explain about connecting a sound card output to an audio 
receiver. Anyone who has hooked up a VCR to a stereo system or connected a tele-
vision to an audio receiver already has the basic skills required. There are a few 
points you should consider when you make this connection, though, and you have 
a few different methods from which to choose. 
Analog Sound Connections 
The left and right stereo connectors that are common on the back of audio 
receivers are not common on the back of computer sound cards, so making an 
analog connection requires a special adapter cable. This cable has a ministereo 
plug at one end and branches to the left and right RCA-type connectors at the 
other end. The ministereo plug goes into the sound card analog output, and the 
RCA-type connectors go into the audio receiver inputs. This is perhaps the 
simplest step in setting up an HTPC. 
The length and quality of the analog audio cable used to make this connection 
may have some impact on the quality of sound that you hear. A long cable that 
passes near high voltages in other electronic components or power cables can 
suffer noticeable signal degradation. Some HTPC hobbyists recommend using 
shielded cables to make any analog audio connection. If the sound quality is not 
as good as it should be, a set of shielded cables is worth considering as a possible 
solution, though rerouting the analog audio cable is a cheaper first step. 
Most sound cards have more than one ministereo jack on the rear mounting 
bracket, and the small labels can be difficult to read (see Figure 8-12). A flashlight 
is very handy for finding the correct audio output jack. Quite a few of the newest 
sound cards feature multiple audio output jacks for multichannel sound, so 
depending on the audio mode configured for the HTPC, the output jacks on the 
back may have different functions at different times. There is usually one jack that 
is always the left and right stereo channels, though. This is the best output jack to 
use for an analog connection to the audio receiver. 
Audio receivers vary from simple models with one auxiliary sound input to 
complicated systems with audio inputs for every type of sound device known 
to mankind. Most midlevel and higher audio receivers are also video receivers 
that are capable of receiving several video sources and switching the audio and 
video synchronously for output. We have yet to see an audio receiver with an input 
labeled "HTPC," however, so you must choose one of the other inputs as the HTPC 
connection. Usually, an ''AUX" or a "Line" (which may be numbered) is fine. The 
only input that you can't use is one meant for phonograph turntables (vinyl record 
players), which is usually labeled "PHONO." 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Figure 8-12. The microscopic line-out label on the back of a sound card 
Some audio receivers have multichannel analog inputs for surround sound 
audio channels. These receivers are usually marked "5.1 surround sound ready" or 
"AC-3 ready," which means they are ready for the analog sound channels after they 
have been decoded from digital audio by a DVD player or other external decoder. 
Audio receivers like this were popular when DVD players first appeared, but the 
cost of digital decoder chips is now so low that most manufacturers just build 
them into their audio receivers. However, these types of audio receivers are pretty 
handy for use with an HTPC that can output multichannel surround sound 
through analog connectors. Standard RCA-type connectors are used to make the 
connection from the HTPC to the audio receiver. The sound card usually includes 
the adapter cables that split the mini plug signal from each jack into the surround 
sound channels with RCA-type connectors. 
Digital Sound Connections 
You can connect the digital audio output (S/PDIF) from an HTPC to an audio 
receiver with either a coaxial digital audio cable or a fiber-optic cable (also known 
as a Toslink cable). Most low and midrange sound cards that have a digital audio 
output use a miniplug to output the digital signal. This requires a special adapter 
209 

ChapterS 
210 
cable to convert the miniplug on the sound card to the more common RCA-type 
connector on the back of the digital audio receiver. There are some sound cards 
with out -of-specification voltage levels on the digital audio output jack-Chapter 5 
provides more information about this problem. 
The optical digital audio connection is just as easy to make as the coaxial 
connection. For sound cards with an optical output, a fiber-optic cable with the 
proper digital audio plugs at both ends can fit into the output jack on the HTPC 
and into the input on the back of the audio receiver. Fiber-optic cables are 
immune to electrical interference, but they are generally more expensive than 
coaxial cables, and they are more susceptible to breaking if bent or twisted. 
Installing USB Devices 
The USB was developed to make it easy to connect peripheral devices to a 
computer. Before the USB was available, most peripherals connected through the 
printer port (also known as a parallel port or LPT port) or through one of the serial 
ports (also known as COM ports). The ports could move information at different 
speeds and in different formats, so they had to be manually configured for each 
type of device. These ports were also based on old standards that have become 
inadequately slow for modern types of peripheral hardware. Most devices could 
not share a port with other devices, so each required its own dedicated resources 
from the computer. 
The alternative is the USB, which solves the problems of the older ports. USB 
devices are self-configuring, which means that they report their settings to the 
computer when they are attached. The USB bus is also capable of much higher 
speeds than the old parallel ports or serial ports, and the bus supports up to 127 
devices concurrently (though in practice, this many devices could hardly be 
attached, and if they were attached, they would overload the data capacity of the 
bus). USB is a great upgrade for the PC industry because it has made using periph-
erals so easy that many new categories of devices have been developed just 
because of the bus. 
The USB connector on the back of the HTPC is a wide, flat socket. Most 
computer systems equipped with USB ports have two or four sockets. Typical 
USB devices that are likely to be used with an HTPC are IR or RF receivers, 
keyboards, mice, and Webcams. These peripherals usually have a USB cable that 
is permanently attached, though many USB devices have a detachable cable. 
The socket on the USB device for a detachable cable does not look the same as 
the socket on the back of the computer case. The peripheral socket is smaller 
and square. Since the USB bus carries power for small devices, the USB cable has 
two differently shaped plugs to prevent it from being used to link two separate 
computers, which would cause a short-circuit and probably damage the systems. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Most manufacturers include explicit instructions for installing their USB 
peripherals on a computer system. Generally, you must install the required soft-
ware before you plug in the USB device for the first time. The PC will detect the 
device and attempt to load a driver for it, and if no driver can be found, the device 
will be disabled. In some cases, you must delete the faulty configuration infor-
mation from the OS before you can correctly install the device. It is much simpler 
to load the drivers first so that the proper configuration information is used. It is 
important to read and follow the installation instructions for USB devices, no 
matter how simple and straightforward they seem. 
Operating Systems 
Firstly, we must admit up front that we prefer to use Microsoft Windows as the OS 
for our HTPC computers. There are so many compelling reasons to argue for and 
against Microsoft Windows, or for and against any other OS, that discussing OSs 
is becoming as difficult as discussing religion. We wish to avoid a debate on the 
topic, so we will only say that you can use any OS as the basis for an HTPC, and 
there are some better and some worse than Microsoft Windows. However, this is 
our project and we are going to cover just Windows in this section, which deals 
with computer OSs. 
Two basic flavors ofWindows are suitable for use in an HTPC. The original 
Windows was barely more than a shell that ran on top of the antiquated disk 
operating system (DOS) that has been around since the first day that PCs were 
developed. This original Windows has evolved through many generations, but it 
was not a real OS until Windows 95 was introduced. Since then, there have been 
upgrades and improvements to it, and the result is the most recent incarnation of 
Windows Me. This version has support for a wide variety of hardware and can run 
well on slower PCs with small amounts of RAM. The prior version, Windows 98, 
is perhaps more suitable for PCs that were manufactured before the year 2000. 
Though Windows Me is a favorite of many PC hobbyists, it is based on an archaic 
DOS architecture and is the last in the line ofWindows 95-based OSs. 
The other line ofWmdows OSs started with the introduction ofWmdows NT 3.1 
(no, there was no version 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0-the first version was numbered to match 
the existing version of DOS-based Windows so that it would not seem like it was 
behind the times). Windows NT 4.0 followed quickly afterward, then Windows 
2000, and now Windows XP. Though the names do not seem to be related, the OS 
line is a continuation of the Windows NT architecture. This OS is not aDOS-based 
system-it is a completely new technology ("NT") for the modern age of PCs and it 
has some great advantages in stability and security over the older Windows 95 line 
ofOSs.

In this book we could not possibly explain every difference between versions 
ofWindows OSs, nor could we provide installation instructions for them. There 
are many good support Web sites and books available for those who feel adven-
turous enough to configure their own HTPC OS. Some components of the various 
Windows versions have a bearing on their capability to serve in an HTPC, though, 
and a brief explanation of these features is helpful when selecting a flavor of 
Windows or any other OS. 
Windows 98 and Windows Me 
From the old DOS-based line ofWindows OSs, there are really only two that are 
worth considering for use with an HTPC. Windows 95 was introduced before the 
days of USB, IEEE 1394, AGP video ports, and other key PC technologies. It does 
not support most of them, and it supports others relatively poorly through third-
party software or patches. Wmdows 95 is no longer supported by Microsoft as of 
November 2001. New versions ofWindows software are not certified to run on 
Windows 95, and some key software technologies such as DirectX updates are no 
longer available for it. Without a current version of DirectX, most media applica-
tions such as DVD players or audio encoders cannot run. This means that 
Windows 98 and Windows Me are the only real choices for this line of OSs. 
Windows 98 has some advantages over other versions of the Windows OS for 
an HTPC. It uses the least amount of hard disk drive space, which makes it suit-
able for simple HTPC systems that are meant for playing media from a network 
file server, or from a DVD or CD drive. Windows 98 requires the least amount of 
RAM and has the lowest required minimum processor power. For minimalist 
HTPC systems, this is an efficient and functional OS. Wmdows 98 supports USB, 
AGP video, and most other recent PC technologies. Perhaps the most enticing 
thing about this version ofWindows is that due to its immense popularity, virtually 
all PC hardware is supplied with drivers for Windows 98. 
Windows Me was introduced in September 2000 as the last in the line of the 
Windows 95 family of OSs. It uses a little more disk space and requires a little more 
processing power than Windows 98. However, it has some nice advantages over 
previous versions, such as the video editing application Microsoft Movie Maker 
and its built-in support for more audio and video media formats. 
Windows 98 and Windows Me have some limitations for use in an HTPC. They 
both use a file system called the file allocation table (FAT) or a variation of it called 
FAT32. The largest file size that can exist on a FAT32 file system is 4GB. This may 
seem huge, but HTPCs that record video can easily exceed this limit with only a few 
minutes of uncompressed NTSC-quality video. Some video capture applications 
will automatically split captured video into two 4GB files, but this is somewhat 
inconvenient when you are switching from one application to another, or when 
you are compressing, editing, copying, or otherwise manipulating the files. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
Windows 98 and Windows Me also have some arcane limitations on the 
number of applications that can be opened and the number of windows that 
can be displayed. These limits are rarely an issue, but the overall poor memory 
management that results from the outdated DOS architecture is a crippling limi-
tation of this Windows 95 family of OSs. 
Windows 2000 and Windows XP 
In the Windows NT line of OSs, there are just two choices for use in an HTPC 
system. The old Windows NT had poor support for most media hardware and soft-
ware. The only version of the indispensable DirectX that works under Windows NT 
is version 3.0, which is included but not upgradeable. Windows NT 4.0 is being 
retired by Microsoft, and it will no longer be supported after June 30, 2003. 
Windows NT was never really marketed by Microsoft as a home OS-it was meant 
for offices and workstations where computer games, television tuner cards, and 
camcorders dare not go. The real selection in this line ofWindows OSs is between 
Windows 2000 and Windows XP. 
The Windows NT family is the real darling OS of Microsoft. Originally devel-
oped to provide a secure and robust OS for professional uses, it is now marketed 
to home users and office workers alike. To suit these different environments (and 
budgets) Microsoft provides different subversions ofWmdows 2000 and Wmdows XP. 
Windows 2000 is available in Professional, Server, Advanced Server, and Data 
Center editions. Windows XP comes in Home and Professional editions. There are 
small differences in features and capabilities of these subversions, but in general 
the least expensive package is suitable for building an HTPC. 
Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Home editions are more expen-
sive than Windows 98 or Windows Me, but they have some important advantages. 
Windows 2000 and Windows XP are built on the NT architecture, which features 
improved memory management, stability, security, and support for larger hard 
disk drive volumes. Since an HTPC is a system that will be running constantly and 
needs to perform flawlessly, selecting a more robust OS is important. For an HTPC 
that sits in a home theater room that may be accessed by many members of a 
household, the security of the Windows NT family of OSs is much better than 
Windows 98 or Windows Me. 
Windows 2000 Professional is a popular choice among PC power-users. It 
features the solid reliability ofWindows NT with the great flexibility of the most 
recent version of DirectX. It is the first Windows NT family member that can play 
computer games and DVD movies, and that supports USB and other key PC tech-
nologies. Its popularity means that it has wide support for most PC hardware, and 
it can do anything that Windows 98 or Windows Me can do, although it requires a 
faster CPU and more memory.

214 
Windows XP is an update to Windows 2000 that adds a slick new user interface 
and more support for media files of all types. It has all the elements ofWindows 
2000, plus some new ones. The Microsoft Movie Maker application from Windows 
Me is included, along with the latest version of the Windows Media Player. A great 
new feature is the ability to switch users while leaving applications open. An HTPC 
is a great machine to share for e-mail, Web surfing, and other Internet applications, 
and the ability to leave one person's applications running while another logs in is a 
great convenience. The added protection of strong security between accounts, even 
when multiple users are logged in, is a bonus that makes a Windows XP machine 
suitable for sharing between parents and children or roommates. 
Networking an HTPC 
The personal computer continues to grow in popularity with the home user, 
and as it does hardware gets cheaper, better, and more practical for home use. 
Networking used to be a topic for corporate and professional environments, but 
in the last few years a lot of equipment has been marketed to home users and the 
number of households with some type of computer network is rising. The HTPC is 
a great addition to any home network, as it can act as a file server for media files, a 
client to play media files from another server, or even as a participant in a multi-
player gaming environment. This section gives a quick overview of the required 
hardware and software for connecting an HTPC to a computer network. 
Network Hardware 
To connect an HTPC to an existing computer network (known as a local area 
network, or LAN) the hardware requirements are quite simple. The HTPC needs to 
have a network adapter card or a network adapter built into the motherboard, and 
a network cable to connect it to the rest of the LAN. A few different types of LAN 
hardware are available, so the adapter card must be compatible with the network 
in use. The most common networking hardware for home users is called Ethernet, 
and it is usually carried on unshielded twisted-pair wiring that looks like it has 
oversized phone plugs at each end. The HTPC requires an Ethernet adapter card 
to connect to an Ethernet network. 
Cabling 
The cabling used by Ethernet networks is categorized by the amount of infor-
mation it can carry. The slowest twisted-pair cabling for Ethernet is rated at 10 Mbps 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
capacity and is usually marked as category 3 or category 4 (cat -3 or cat -4). Faster 
networking is available with cat-5 cable, which supports up to 100 Mbps data 
transfer rate. More exotic cat -5E and fiber-optic cable is available, but the costs 
start to get prohibitive above 100 Mbps for both cabling and the other hardware 
required. Generally, cat -5 cable for a 100 Mbps LAN is sufficient for home use. 
Since 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps networking will run fine over cat -5 cable, this is the 
best choice. 
Ethernet Cards 
Ethernet adapter cards for home use are available at most computer stores, and 
since Ethernet over unshielded twisted-pair cabling is so common, it is almost 
impossible to buy the wrong network card. The only choice to be made is whether 
to get a 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps speed adapter. Fortunately, the cost of a 10/100 Mbps 
adapter that is compatible with both LAN speeds is relatively low, so this is usually 
the best alternative. 
If the LAN does not exist already, then there is one extra (and relatively expen-
sive) item to acquire in order to set up the network. Each client computer on the 
network needs its own LAN adapter card and network cable, but the cables must 
all connect together somehow. This connection is made with a hub or switch, 
which is a small device with four or more jacks for the network cables from each 
PC. The hub or switch must be compatible with the speed of the network cards 
attached-a 10 Mbps hub or switch will work with 10 Mbps LAN adapter cards, 
but not with 100 Mbps adapter cards. This is why 10/100 Mbps adapter cards are 
so practical. You can use them with a 10 Mbps hub until you replace it with a faster 
100 Mbps hub. Hubs or switches come in different shapes, sizes, and capacities, 
and with different features, so some consideration of desired network perform-
ance versus cost is helpful to select the best device for a home LAN. 
Cross-Over 
If you have a small network of only two computers, you can use a cross-over cable 
instead of a hub to link the machines directly to each other. A cross-over cable 
looks like a normal Ethernet cable, but the wires are crossed at one end to allow 
two computers to communicate directly instead of through a hub. You can find 
cross-over cables at most major computer stores, or you can have them custom 
made at a local PC shop. A cross-over cable has the advantage of being somewhat 
cheaper, as a hub is not required, but it is extremely limited in expandability. 
Without a hub, a PC needs a LAN adapter card and a cross-over cable for each 
computer to which a connection is desired. 
215 

Chapter a 
216 
Wireless 
Wireless networking is also becoming very popular, especially at home where 
network cabling does not already exist inside the walls. Wireless networks require a 
wireless LAN adapter card for each client PC and a wireless hub to connect more 
than one computer to the network. Wireless networking is easy to install and very 
convenient for mobile PCs or for any PC that gets moved around from time to time. 
The disadvantages of wireless networking are rather critical, however. Wireless 
networks are much slower than conventional cabled connections. A typical11 
Mbps wireless network is about nine times slower than a 100 Mbps LAN, which is 
too slow for playing video at a decent quality over the network. An HTPC with a 
wireless network connection may be sufficient for Web surfing or playing MP3 
music from another computer, but it is not capable of playing video files across 
the wireless connection. The speed of wireless networks also drops off with 
distance and interference. If the HTPC is not close enough to the wireless hub 
to get the full performance, the network connection may be even slower than 
11 Mbps. A 10 Mbps conventional network connection suffers from the same 
low bandwidth problems as a wireless connection, but it can reach much further 
distances and does not experience as much signal degradation or interference. 
To connect the computers on a LAN to the Internet, only one connection is 
required, as all of the PCs can share a single access. This can be through a dial-up 
modem, a broadband connection such as a cable modem or DSL modem, or any 
other Internet connection method. The PC that hosts the connection needs to 
have special software installed to share it out with the rest of the clients on the 
LAN. An alternative to this arrangement is to use a hub with a built-in Internet 
router. The hub is connected to the dial-up or broadband modem and the 
computers connected to the hub can all access the Internet through it. Routers 
are more expensive than plain hubs, but they are very convenient and often 
provide great security, as there is no PC connected directly to the Internet. 
Network Software 
The Windows OS provides the software necessary to connect the computers on a 
LAN to each other and to the Internet. A software driver for the LAN adapter card 
is required, but many adapter cards are automatically recognized by Windows. 
Computer networking is a huge subject, and a complex one, but we will simplify 
it by explaining that there are two software components that make it work: the 
networking utilities and the applications that use the networking utilities. 
Networking utilities are the protocols that the PC uses to communicate on 
the LAN. The most common protocol in current use is the transmission control 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP, sometimes referred to as just IP). This is the 
"language" of the Internet, so it is used worldwide and it has been adapted for 
use on small LANs in order to make them compatible with the Internet. When 
Windows detects a LAN adapter card, it automatically installs the TCP /IP protocol 
and configures it with default settings that work for most situations. 
The default TCP /IP settings may not be appropriate for a small home LAN, 
however. The TCP /IP protocol depends on each computer on the network having 
a unique address to identify it. This address is composed of four numbers, each in 
the range of 0 to 255. The IP address of a computer can be set automatically if the 
LAN is configured with a special service called dynamic host control protocol 
(DHCP). One (and only one) machine on the LAN is set up as the DHCP server, 
and it gives all of the other PCs an IP address. Unfortunately, most people setting 
up a LAN at home for the first time will not have the ability to create a DHCP 
server, and none of the PCs on the LAN will get IP addresses, so they will not be 
able to connect to anything on the network. 
/ 
TIP An IP address looks like this example: 127.0.0.1. This is actually a 
special address that points to the local machine-trying to connect to this 
address will cause a PC to connect to itself 
Instead of using the default Windows TCP /IP settings, it will be necessary 
to configure each PC with an IP address manually. Remember that the TCP /IP 
protocol is used worldwide for every computer on the Internet and that each 
computer must have its own address. Any IP address selected randomly for use 
on a home LAN is likely to be used already somewhere else on the Internet. If the 
home LAN is not connected to the Internet, this doesn't really matter, but if it is, 
there can be conflicts and big problems with the LAN, and some potential security 
issues. For this reason, the TCP/IP protocol specification reserves a few certain 
ranges of addresses for use on private networks. Addresses in these ranges are not 
used by any computer anywhere on the Internet, so they will not conflict with the 
PCs in a private network. 
For this reason, when you set the IP address of LAN clients manually, it is 
strongly recommended that you use addresses in the range from 192.168.0.1 
to 192.168.255.254. Each computer connected to the LAN must have a unique 
address, and they do not have to be numbered contiguously or in order. When you 
set the IP address, the client PC must also have a sub net mask specified. This mask 
lets the computer know the range of other addresses to which it may connect. 
Typically, the sub net mask is set to 255.255.255.0, which means that the computer 
217 

Chapter a 
218 
can see all the other addresses where the first three numbers match. In other 
words, a computer with an IP address of 192.168.0.1 can see all the addresses in 
the range 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254. 
After you have determined and set the address of the HTPC, you have some 
other numbers to configure, depending on the way you have configured Internet 
access. The PC on the LAN that hosts the Internet connection becomes the 
gateway to the Internet for the other LAN clients. Each client must be configured 
with the IP address of the gateway in order to find the route to the Internet. Some-
times it is also necessary to configure the address of the domain name server 
(DNS) and the secondary DNS. One important step is to confirm that the NetBIOS 
protocol is piggybacked onto the TCP /IP protocol. There is usually a setting some-
where in the Windows Networking configuration utility in the Control Panel that 
allows the user to turn this on, though in recent versions ofWindows it is on by 
default. Without this setting, the HTPC will connect to the Internet, but it will not 
be able to see the other computers on the LAN. 
NOTE NetBIOS was the default networking protocol for Microsoft Windows 
PCs-that is, until the rising popularity of the Internet made TCPIIP the 
preferred protocol for most users. 
You can avoid much of the complexity of configuring an IP network with a 
home router. This device, mentioned previously as a feature of some hubs, is also 
available as a stand-alone unit without the hub features. The home router acts as a 
DHPC server, so that the default Windows TCP/IP configuration works correctly, 
and there is no manual intervention required. For most home users, the cost of a 
router is worth the savings in time and frustration when setting up a LAN. 
After the networking utilities are set up, the software that uses the utilities to 
communicate on the network is comparatively easy to install. Wmdows comes 
with a feature called Network Neighborhood that allows the HTPC user to browse 
through the shared files and printers on the other computers attached to the LAN. 
To share a folder so that other computers can see it, you use the Sharing tab in the 
Folder Properties window. Options on this tab control the shared status and 
shared security of the folder. 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
NOTE It is easy to share files across the network, either by copying them to 
the local machine or accessing them directly on the remote machine. It is 
not, however, possible to share applications this way. An application must 
be installed on each PC that will use it-it cannot be shared by simply 
accessing the folder from another PC. 
Connecting to the Internet is as easy as starting a Web browser or e-mail 
application. Since the PC is always connected to the LAN, the Internet application 
will simply access the LAN for an Internet connection. If the HTPC has previously 
been used with a dial-up connection, it may be necessary to change the settings in 
the Internet Control Panel utility to tell the machine to access the Internet through 
the LAN. 
Network Security 
Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about computer security, and you 
should not connect an HTPC to a LAN without first considering the potential for 
security problems. A LAN that is not connected to the Internet is relatively secure, 
as the only way that settings can be changed, new software added, or files accessed 
is through one of the other PCs on the LAN. When you connect the HTPC to the 
Internet, the number of computers that can potentially access the HTPC is 
suddenly vastly increased, and you must take precautions to prevent problems. 
The easiest way to implement strong security for a home LAN that is 
connected to the Internet is to use a home router for Internet access. These 
devices are configured to be very secure by default, and since they are meant 
for home users who may not have the expertise of corporate and professional 
network technicians, they are made to be simple to use and configure. Generally, 
any unauthorized attempt to access the LAN behind a router is stopped at the 
router and no PC on the LAN is ever in danger. The PCs on the LAN still have full 
access to the Internet and behave as if no router existed at all. 
If a router is not practical, then some other sort of protective barrier is recom-
mended. Computer professionals call this barrier a firewall. One of the best 
firewalls available is Zone Alarm. This is a free utility for Windows PCs that moni-
tors all incoming and outgoing network traffic and lets the user control what is 
allowed and what is blocked. Zone Alarm can be run on the PC that is a gateway 
to the Internet for the other machines on the LAN, or it can be run on every PC, 
including the HTPC. Generally, protecting the gateway PC is sufficient to ensure 
security from hackers. 
219 

ChapterS 
220 
Hackers are not the only problem with PC security, though. Viruses and Trojan 
applications can infect an HTPC when they arrive hidden in software downloaded 
from the Internet. Antivirus software has become almost mandatory for any 
Internet-connected computer, and keeping the antivirus software up-to-date 
is just as important as putting it on the HTPC in the first place. This protective 
software can affect the performance of an HTPC, so many users opt to keep it 
disabled and only run it at regular intervals. This is a balance between security 
and performance that must be determined for each HTPC system. Machines that 
are used to run a lot of downloaded software should be scanned more frequently. 
The HTPC Project Hardware 
For this book, we are assembling two HTPC machines. The first is a high-end 
machine with a fast processor and a striped disk volume across two physical hard 
disk drives. The second is a low-end machine with an older processor and less 
expensive components. Comparing these two machines reveals a lot about the 
hardware requirements of the HTPC hobby, as even the low-end system is quite 
capable of stunning DVD playback, which has become the benchmark of HTPC 
performance. 
HTPC System 1 
The CPU in this machine is an AMD Athlon XP 21 00+. This machine is often used 
for video capture, editing, and rendering, so high performance is required for 
more than just playing DVD movies. Rendering video is the process of taking raw 
digital video information and compressing it with a codec such as MPEG-2 into a 
smaller file size that saves space without losing too much quality. This process 
takes a lot of processing power, so a faster CPU means faster rendering and more 
work can be done. 
There is 512MB of 333 MHz DDR SDRAM in this HTPC system, which is way 
more than is necessary for media playback, but for video editing this is just barely 
a comfortable amount. This machine is also used for computer games occasion-
ally, and this amount of RAM is quite suitable for this purpose, too. 
A major hardware advantage that this system has over other fast PCs is the use 
of two hard disk drives in a RAID 0 striped volume. There are two 7200 rpm 40GB 
hard disks that provide almost twice the performance of a single 80GB drive with 
the same capacity. An ATA RAID controller adapter card is used to control the 
drives so that the HTPC can boot from the striped volume. Volume striping 
improves performance for video capturing, editing, and rendering, and it also 

Additional Hardware Requirements and Putting It All Together 
improves performance for digital VCR functions such as recording television 
shows. Having two drives increases the noise and heat generated, but this 
machine will be enclosed in a sound barrier, so this is not expected to be an issue. 
This system has four USB 1.1 ports and two USB 2.0 ports, which is important 
because we expect to use a USB Web cam and RF receiver in two ports, which 
leaves enough free ports for future upgrades. This HTPC lives on a LAN, so a 
10/100 Mbps LAN adapter card allows us to connect at 100 Mbps to our 100 Mbps 
hub and Internet router. Since there is another PC with a CD-R drive on the LAN, 
the HTPC does not need a CD burner, but it does have a DVD drive for playing 
movies. 
The high-end HTPC system is enclosed in a black tower case with brushed 
aluminum faceplates, as shown in Figure 8-13. We decided that this HTPC did not 
require a snazzy home theater case since it would be mostly hidden behind the 
sound barrier, but the black case was chosen to match the color of the television 
and the other components. The black case necessitated a DVD drive and floppy 
diskette drive with black facing, which cost a little more, but makes the system 
look well coordinated.

221 

ChapterS 
222 
This system has Windows XP Home edition installed. We decided to upgrade 
to this newest version ofWindows to get the stability of the Windows NT family of 
OSs and the latest multimedia features available. Windows XP has great support 
for multiple users, and since this system will sit in a home theater room, more 
than one family member will use it for e-mail and Web surfing. 
Finally, though this system has access to the Internet, the access is through a 
home router, so we do not require any firewall software on the HTPC. An antivirus 
package is used to scan it regularly, but we disable the antivirus software during 
HTPC use in order to reduce performance impact while editing video or watching 
DVDmovies. 
HTPC System 2 
The CPU in our second HTPC system is an Intel Pentium III running at 450 MHz. 
This is an older PC that is being recycled into a great HTPC system. It will be used 
to play DVD movies, audio CDs, and MP3 music, along with prerendered home 
movies and video clips downloaded from the Internet. The Pentium III 450 is well 
suited to these tasks. 
This machine has 256MB of RAM and a single 10GB hard disk drive, which is 
used to hold current media only. Since this machine is connected to a IAN, it does 
not need to store a lot of media files locally-it can access them on other PCs. The 
single hard disk drive reduces the amount of noise and heat from this system, so it 
can live comfortably in the home theater room without any special noise barrier. 
This system has a DVD drive for movie playback. Though the processor is 
comfortably powerful enough to play back DVD video, the video card features 
MPEG-2 hardware decoding that will assist the CPU and make the system more 
than adequate for smooth DVD performance. 
Since this is our low-cost HTPC, we chose to keep the computer case that 
came with this hardware (see Figure 8-14). One advantage of using an older 
system to build an HTPC is that the case can be painted, decorated, and 
customized to suit our home theater room without concern for its expense.

We have selected Windows 98 as the OS for this HTPC. This version of 
Windows permits the best performance on PCs in this age group and still allows 
for networking and Internet access. We are trying to build this machine to be as 
simple and efficient as possible, and Windows 98 requires the least disk space and 
offers great compatibility for the hardware in this system. 
With our systems selected and assembled, we are now ready to move into the 
next phase of building our HTPC machines: installing and configuring the software. 
Summary 
In this chapter we looked at how to pull everything together in order to end up 
with a functioning HTPC that can do what you need it to. In Chapter 9 we discuss 
the software you'll need for every aspect of your HTPC, from bundled software to 
the freeware utilities that can make your box sing. 

Software 
and Other 
Solutions 

CHAPTER 9 
The Software 
AsSEMBLING THE COMPONENTS of an HTPC is a real art form. Selecting the perfect 
video card or finding the best sound card for the system can make it perform 
better, improve the picture quality, or boost the realism of the audio track, all of 
which can make the home theater more like a movie theater. HTPC hobbyists 
spend a lot of time deciding what hardware to use, finding out where it is avail-
able, and configuring it for optimum performance. However, after all this work, 
the project is still only half done. 
Finding and configuring the correct software is just as important as using the 
most appropriate hardware for the HTPC system. Using the right application can 
add to the performance and convenience of the machine, so selecting software is 
more than just picking the right DVD player, it is also knowing about and selecting 
the software that will add functionality and features to the home theater. Without 
the right software, all that fancy HTPC hardware has nothing to do. 
In our discussion ofHTPC operating systems (OSs), we chose to limit 
ourselves to Microsoft Windows and its variants. likewise, in our discussion of 
software applications, we only review Windows software. This is not meant as 
an endorsement of the Windows OS in general or specifically for use with HTPC 
systems. Other OSs, such as LimlX, are capable of serving in a multimedia PC and 
can be the software basis of a great HTPC. We are limiting this chapter to Windows 
software because it is the OS with which we are most familiar and with which we 
have found most readers are comfortable. 
Some of the software that any HTPC will need is available for free or is 
included with the Microsoft Windows OS, but most of the specialized software is 
available for purchase. Since the HTPC hobby is still relatively new, many of these 
software packages are not available at retail stores or computer shops, so they 
must be downloaded or ordered from online retailers. This is actually a great way 
to buy software, as shopping online provides two advantages over a brick-and-
mortar store. First, there is often a "shareware" version of the software available 
for you to try out before you decide to buy the full version. Second, you can 
usually download the full version immediately after you purchase it, which 
means it is available to use almost instantly. 
It is important to state that the authors of HTPC software (and all software) 
work very hard to provide a product that benefits users, so supporting them by 
purchasing their software is the best way to show gratitude and encourage new

features and fixes in the applications. You should use shareware only to evaluate a 
product, and you should use full versions of software only if you are the licensed 
purchaser. This keeps the industry going, drives innovation, and holds prices 
down. After you add up the cost of hardware, buying a few HTPC applications is 
a minor expense that is well worth making your HTPC the best it can be. 
Utilities 
The first category of software that is required for an HTPC is the collection of 
applications that allow the user to configure the machine. These applications do 
not play audio or video files; rather, they control the way these files are played. PC 
users often have a set of favorite utilities for tweaking and configuring the PC for 
optimal disk performance, game performance, or memory settings. These PC utili-
ties are helpful for configuring an HTPC, but this section describes some special 
utility applications that are meant for use with an HTPC. 
Video Utilities 
HTPC video utilities are mostly concerned with providing the best possible picture 
quality for high -definition television displays. The high cost of HDTV video sources 
and the lack of available material have left a gaping void that the HTPC is quickly 
filling. The HTPC can up-convert conventional NTSC video to HDTV resolutions, 
and it can display over-the-air HDTV signals with a high-definition television 
tuner card, which makes it the most cost-effective HDTVvideo source. Outputting 
HDTV-qualityvideo is not completely straightforward, however, and up-converting 
NTSC video to HDTV is even more complicated. A few software utilities are avail-
able for the HTPC that make these tasks easier. 
For those HTPC hobbyists who do not have an HDTV display, or who are not 
concerned with using the HTPC with a high-definition television set, these video 
utilities are not necessary. A video card with a composite or S-video output will 
already provide the best quality picture for a standard NTSC television. It is 
possible to use these utilities to configure color and brightness, or to make other 
adjustments, but the resolution and quality of the picture is determined by the 
NTSC hardware in the video card. 

PowerStrip 
The world of computers and the world of televisions have only recently come 
together, and many compatibility problems are still lingering. PowerStrip is a soft-
ware utility that can set the display mode on a computer to any resolution and 
timing that you want, which makes it easy to synchronize the video output signal 
from an HTPC to the HDTV display. 
Custom Resolutions 
NTSC television sets are always showing the same video mode, no matter how 
good or bad the quality of the video signal. The vertical resolution of an NTSC tele-
vision picture is set at 525 lines, though only about 480 lines are actually visible. 
The refresh rate, or display frequency, of NTSC video is about 30 complete frames 
per second. Like all analog video formats, the actual resolution of the picture may 
be lower than the standard indicates. VHS is usually considered to be about 240 
lines, and S-VHS (S-video) is about 400 lines. This is only a relative measurement, 
however, as the NTSC television does not change video modes-it is always 
outputting 525 lines. The horizontal resolution depends on the signal bandwidth 
available and is not usually specified. An experienced eye can quickly tell the 
difference between various types of NTSC video sources. 
Computer displays can switch among many different resolutions, which are 
specified as the number of vertical lines by the number of horizontal lines. The 
resolution of a computer display is selected by the user, and the number of display 
resolutions available depends on the quality of the hardware in use. The display 
mode can be set to a number of different refresh rates and may be interlaced or 
progressively scanned, though most computer hardware and software is config-
ured for progressive-scan images. Since the computer display mode is known, 
there is no guessing about the actual quality of the picture. 
Mixing analog television and digital computer video formats is not a straight-
forward process. A computer can output standard NTSC video only with special 
hardware. Many video cards include an S-video or composite output connector 
(for more information, see Chapter 4) that converts the computer display to an 
NTSC-compatible signal. This usually limits the display modes of the computer, 
since higher resolution modes do not convert easily to the lower NTSC mode.

Enter HDTV 
The introduction of high-definition television in North America has moved the 
television industry a little closer to the display modes of the computer industry. 
The resolution of HD'IV modes is measured the same way as computer display 
modes, and HD'IV displays can switch between different resolutions. Though 
not all HD'IV-compatible displays support all of the official Advanced Television 
Systems Committee (ATSC) resolutions for digital television, most sets support 
at least one or two modes above 480p. 
Mixing digital television and digital computer video formats is not much easier 
than analog television, though. You'll still need special hardware to convert the 
VGA output signal from a computer to the component input of an HDTY. In 
Chapter 4 we described a VGA-to-component transcoder, which is necessary to 
connect the HTPC to an HD'IV display. Making this connection is not the end of 
the challenge, though. The display modes for high-definition television are not 
the modes that computer users will find familiar, since HD'IV is meant for a dif-
ferent picture aspect ratio than most computer displays use. Even after you've 
connected the transcoder, you still must configure the HTPC to send a compati-
ble video signal to the HDTY. 
The 480p mode is the lowest common denominator mode for HD'IV displays 
and computer video output. For the computer, this is a 640x480 at 60 Hz display 
mode. Actually, most HD'IV displays are compatible with NTSC, which would be 
equivalent to 640x480 at 60Hz interlace display mode, but few modern comput-
er display adapters can be set to interlaced timing for such a low resolution. 
Other HD'IV modes, such as 960x540 at 60 Hz not interlaced, 1280x720 at 60 Hz 
not interlaced, or 1920xl080 at 30Hz interlaced, are not typical options sup-
ported by the display drivers for PC video cards. To use an HTPC at anything 
above 480p, you will need a special display utility that can set the PC video card 
to match the HD'IV modes. 
Fortunately, there is just such a utility available: PowerStrip. The basic purpose 
of PowerStrip is to set the video display to an HD'IV-compatible mode. PowerStrip 
allows you to override the display properties of the video card and set any cus-
tom resolution and refresh timing that you desire. This makes it possible to use 
the HTPC to output the high-definition television modes such as 540p, 720p, 
and 1080i for compatible television sets, giving the HTPC excellent picture quali-
ty for DVD movies, television, or any other type of video. For more information 
about setting up PowerStrip with custom resolutions and timings for HD'IV 
displays, see Chapter 10. 

More Than Custom Resolutions 
PowerStrip does a lot more than just allow you to set custom resolutions and 
timings. It provides controls for color adjustment, hardware performance, video 
processor and memory clock speed, and multiple monitor support for any version 
of the Windows OS. You can program this software to automatically adjust the 
display mode when specific applications start up, and it lets you adjust brightness 
and color settings with the keyboard or remote control while applications are 
running. It is a great do-it-all video utility. 
You can download PowerStrip as shareware from the PowerStrip Web site at 
http: I lwww. entechtaiwan. com/ps. htm, and you can purchase it online by running 
the application and selecting Online Services from the menu. You should install 
and evaluate this software as shareware on your HTPC before you buy it, as it is 
only useful if it supports the video card chipset in your machine. In fact, it is worth 
downloading this software to check the list of supported video cards before you 
choose video hardware just to make sure that the new video card will work with 
PowerStrip. At the time of this writing, registering PowerStrip costs $29.95 for use 
on one to four HTPCs. 
YXY Aspect Ratio Controller 
The introduction of HD1V to North America is an exciting development for home 
theater enthusiasts, but it has been slow and confusing, and it has not solved all 
of the problems that the analog NTSC format has. One major problem is that the 
new digital video formats are meant for use with display devices with a different 
picture aspect ratio than the current NTSC televisions. This means that the HD1V 
picture is wider than the NTSC picture, so it does not fit into an older television set 
display area. 
To fit the whole HD1V picture onto an NTSC television, the sides of the picture 
must be clipped off or the size must be reduced to leave a blank area at the top 
and bottom of the screen. Similarly, for a conventional NTSC program on a new 
HD1V set, the top and bottom must be clipped or the picture size must be reduced 
to leave the sides blank. To add to the confusion, many HD1V-compatible sets 
are available with the NTSC aspect ratio of 4:3, but they display the HD1V picture 
either by shrinking the picture and leaving blank space or by stretching and 
distorting the picture. Since NTSC and HD1V video will coexist for many years 
into the future, this compromise will continue to confuse and frustrate users. 
The Software 
231 

Chapter9 
232 
If you add the wide variation of compatible resolutions and timings for HDTV 
sets provided by PowerStrip to the equation, suddenly it becomes obvious that 
there are many different picture aspect ratios available for use with the HTPC. This 
can be a problem if the preferred display mode for a given video card and HDTV 
causes picture distortion. Some software DVD players try to fix the distortion, but 
they do not have enough settings to correct for unusual display modes. 
To overcome this problem, Jim Ferguson has written the freeware application 
YXY Aspect Ratio Controller. This utility enables you to set the aspect ratio of the 
video overlay used by most video cards to display DVD, television, or other video. 
You can set the exact dimensions and location of the overlay picture, even if the 
dimensions are bigger than the screen size. This allows you to correct any distor-
tion caused by an unusual aspect ratio, such as a 4:3-shaped HDTV displaying a 
16:9 video mode. 
You can download YXY Aspect Ratio Controller from the Keohi HDTVWeb site 
at http: I /www. keohi. com/keohihdtv /htpc/yxy /yxy. html. This Web site also features 
great information about HDTV topics, including a general overview of HTPCs. 
DScaler 
Standard NTSC video can look worse on an HDTV than on an NTSC television set. 
NTSC video is interlaced, which means that each complete frame is made from 
two sets of alternating lines of the picture. If the video features a lot of movement, 
then some objects on the screen will move in the time it takes to draw the second 
set of lines. On a standard interlaced display such as an NTSC television, this is 
not a problem, since only half of the lines are displayed at one time. However, a 
progressively scanned display device such as an HDTV combines the two sets of 
lines into one frame that is displayed all at once. The problem is that the two sets 
of lines are not meant to be shown at the same time, and any fast moving object 
will appear with jagged edges, as shown in Figure 9-l. 

Figure 9-1. An interlaced video frame shown on a progressive-scan display device 
In order to properly show interlaced video on a progressive-scan display 
device, the two sets of lines (called fields) in the video frame must be combined 
into one single set, and some technique must be used to compensate for any 
movement of objects between the fields. This is a huge field of development for 
the television and broadcast industries, as deinterlacing becomes more and more 
necessary for converting NTSC video for display on HDTV sets. 
Software for the Windows OS called DScaler can deinterlace video in real time 
for HTPC output to a progressive-scan display. You can configure DScaler to use 
one of several algorithms to create progressive video output, or you can let it auto-
matically pick the best method for the current program. DScaler is freeware and is 
available for download from the http: I /de interlace. sourceforge. net Web site. 
The Software 
233 

Chapter9 
234 
DScaler will work for outputting video with any AGP video card, but it is 
written to work with the video inputs of television tuners and video capture cards 
that are based on the Conexant bt848/878/879 processor. Deinterlacing video while 
capturing it to the HTPC is a preferable way to capture it, but if the machine does 
not have a television tuner card or a video capture device based on the Conexant 
chip, then deinterlacing can be done when outputting the video. The Conexant 
chip is fairly common in television tuner cards, and you can find more information 
about supported capture devices on the DScalerWeb site. 
The output quality that DScaler can achieve is excellent, and it rivals expensive 
deinterlacing machines. Since DScaler works on video in real time, the perform-
ance of the CPU in the HTPC has some bearing on the video quality. A fast CPU can 
perform more complex deinterlacing algorithms and still keep up with the video, 
but a slower CPU will have to settle for less impressive deinterlacing, or else settle 
for video with stuttering, jumping, and other signs of dropped frames. 
DScaler is an excellent software tool for use with an HTPC that is connected 
to a progressive-scan display, such as an HD1V set. With standard television 
programs, VHS tapes, or other NTSC video sources, the interlaced video will look 
bad when objects on the screen are moving. Many HD1V sets have a built-in line-
doubler that deinterlaces video when an NTSC source is connected, but since the 
HTPC is not an NTSC source, the HD1V's line-doubler is not active. The HTPC 
must deinterlace the video for output to the HD1V set. DScaler can deinterlace the 
video, and on fast HTPC machines, it can do it as well or better than the HD1V's 
own line-doubler. 
Remote Control Software Utilities 
In Chapter 7 we looked at using an infrared (IR) or a radio frequency (RF) remote 
control to control the HTPC. The major benefits of these remote controls are the 
small size, the ease of use and, for RF units, the ability to control the machine from 
a different room or from behind a soundproof barrier. Most devices that are meant 
for remotely controlling a computer already come with software that can do some 
basic tasks, such as start or stop a DVD movie, or control the sound volume. Some 
remotes even have mouse pointer controls that let the user point and click like a 
conventional PC mouse. Using a handheld remote control device with an HTPC is 
a great way to make it more convenient to use in the home theater. 
The bundled software is not the only choice for use with a remote control 
device, however. In some cases, the bundled application cannot be customized or 
used with every application on the HTPC. Usually, the bundled software is unable 
to control OS features such as shutting down the system, switching screen resolu-
tions, or logging on and off with different account information. In some cases, 
there is no software bundled with a remote control device-this is often the case 

with USB IR receivers, which are meant to work with any typical consumer elec-
tronics IR remote control. Fortunately, there are alternative remote control 
applications available. 
Girder 
A few PC software applications are available that are meant for use with a remote 
control device. Some of them are available as shareware, such as PC Remote 
Control (http:/ /www.pcremotecontrol.com), which you can evaluate for a short 
period before you decide to purchase it. These products are meant for use with 
multimedia PCs in business environments where laptops are used to give presen-
tations or product demonstrations at tradeshows, but they are perfectly suited for 
use with HTPC systems. Several excellent products are available, but the one that 
seems to be most popular is Girder. 
Girder is a freeware application that claims to be "The Ultimate Windows 
Automation Tool," which is a pretty excellent description of what it does. Girder 
can invoke any OS event or application command when it receives input from 
almost any kind of device: a remote computer, an attached device, a keyboard or 
mouse, or a remote control. Since Girder can interact with the computer at a very 
low level, it works with all the applications installed on an HTPC. 
Girder allows mouse movements and buttons to be mapped to any remote 
control device. This is a great convenience for HTPC hobbyists who prefer to use 
a single universal remote in their home theater. One disadvantage of using such a 
remote control with an HTPC is that each desired action must be preconfigured 
to a button on the remote control. By using Girder to map the mouse movements 
and buttons, the remote control becomes a mouse that can navigate through appli-
cation screens, scroll through Web sites, or configure setup dialog windows without 
any specific preprogramming. This saves the hassle of scrambling for a keyboard 
and mouse when surfing the Internet or fine-tuning the HTPC configuration. 
The architecture of the Girder software allows it to be compatible with a wide 
variety of hardware. Girder can see every event that occurs in the system, and it 
can trigger almost any event in the OS or application software. A remote control 
requires a receiver to communicate to the HTPC. The receiver is usually a small IR 
or RF device that connects to a USB or serial port, and it needs to have a driver 
installed to the OS. Girder can receive the transmitted commands from the driver 
no matter what type of receiver hardware is used. Girder also supports plug-ins, 
which are extensions to Girder that allow any user to make a file that will configure 
Girder to work automatically with a particular remote control (the ATI Remote 
Wonder, for example). The plug-in simplypreconfigures Girder for the set of 
commands that a remote control is capable of sending. These commands are then 
The Software 
235 

Chapter9 
236 
easier to map to the actions that should be performed in the HTPC when a button 
on the remote control is pressed. 
Like most powerful software, Girder is complicated to learn and set up. The 
online help is pretty good at explaining the procedure for a simple command 
configuration, but most users need to perform the configuration a few times 
before they begin to understand what is happening. Lots of plug-ins are available 
for popular HTPC tasks, and these are worth checking out to extend the function-
ality of Girder and of the HTPC. Girder can also send IR, Xl 0, and serial signals 
depending on the hardware used. 
Since Girder is software that lets the user control the HTPC, it is best to 
install it after the other applications in the HTPC have been set up and configured. 
Girder does not have to be the last utility or application added to the system, 
but it adds more value to a machine that has most of the multimedia software 
already installed. You can find the Girder software and more information at 
http: I /www. girder. nl/ as well as a sampling of plug-ins and a discussion forum. 
Bundled Remote Control Utilities 
The ATI Remote Wonder that comes with the ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 
includes a software utility that connects the buttons on the remote control to 
features in the ATI software. The ATI Ali-In-Wonder products are very HTPC-
friendly and suitable for almost all multimedia functions of the system. The 
products include a software DVD player, computer audio and video file players, 
television tuning and recording software, and a file organizer. The Remote Wonder 
software has preprogrammed buttons for all of these applications, which saves a 
lot of configuration and fine-tuning for the HTPC hobbyist. 
Most people will find that the ATI Remote Wonder and its bundled software 
is a sufficient package for the HTPC when used with the ATI All-In-Wonder video 
cards. The software allows a minimal amount of custom configuration, so it is not 
strictly limited to the ATI Multimedia Center software. The Remote Wonder can 
be used to kick off other applications, and it features a mouse pointer and mouse 
buttons, so it does not lack any versatility. Though the Remote Wonder software is 
not as powerful as Girder, the complete integration of the hardware and software 
with the AT! Ail-In-Wonder package is a very quick and simple way to get an HTPC 
up and running with a remote control. 

Applications 
The other category of software that is required for an HTPC is the multimedia 
player. This type of application performs the main function of the system: playing 
a DVD movie, playing CD audio, or flipping through digital pictures. In fact, the 
development of these applications is what compelled the evolution of the HTPC in 
the first place. Since this software is so critical, users are very critical of this soft-
ware. Finding a great DVD movie player is an all-consuming pastime of hardcore 
HTPC hobbyists, who delight in comparing the same movie scene played by 
different software DVD players until they find the best player. It is not the inten-
tion of this chapter to deprive any hobbyist of this great experience, but there are 
some basic features of multimedia software that are worth reviewing before 
jumping into the subtle differences between players. 
Media Players 
The least functionality an HTPC can have is to play video, play audio, or display 
digital picture files. Even an old original Intel Pentium-based system has a place 
in the home theater if it can play MP3 or CD audio files. Most people who want 
to build an HTPC will want it to play DVD movies, downloaded video files, and 
music. All of these functions are core to the purpose of an HTPC and are accom-
plished by installing the proper media players in the system. 
DVD Players 
The software DVD player installed on an HTPC is usually the most important 
application in the system, and finding the right one is therefore an important task. 
Several software DVD players are available for the Windows OS, and although they 
are mostly the same, each one has a slightly different set of features, compatibility, 
or picture quality. Since there are no free software DVD players, it is not cost effec-
tive for many HTPC hobbyists to own more than one or two such applications. It is 
vital to identify which features take priority and which player is most compatible 
with the hardware in the HTPC. 
The Software 
237 

Chapter9 
238 
The Decoder 
The most important part of a software DVD player is the MPEG-2 decoder. Anyone 
selling software that decodes MPEG video must pay licensing fees, so there is no 
MPEG-2 decoding software included with the Windows OS. Each software DVD 
player must include its own software code to play video, and the differences 
between the code for each player have a sometimes noticeable effect on the 
picture quality of DVD movies. Also, anyone selling software that decrypts the 
protected information on a DVD must pay licensing fees, which is why there is no 
DVD playback capability in the Windows OS without the installation of a DVD 
player application. 
Hardware Support 
The other important part of a software DVD player is the support for the video 
hardware installed in the HTPC. Many software DVD players are compatible with 
popular video cards, but the compatibility depends on other factors such as the 
video card drivers, the OS, and the other software in the machine. If the player is 
not compatible, all of the MPEG-2 decoding is done through software, which can 
be slower and cause stuttering or dropped frames. If the player is compatible, then 
the hardware in the card can perform some of the decoding, which means the 
HTPC system is less stressed, and the performance of the DVD playback is 
smoother and looks better. Most software DVD players list the compatible video 
cards on their Web sites, but issues with video card drivers or software versions 
usually require a lot of reading and research at popular HTPC discussion areas 
such asAVS Forum (http:/ /www.avsforum. com). 
Most software DVD players use a Wmdows feature called DirectShow. This is 
an application program interface (API) that is part of the DirectX package, and it 
allows applications to access hardware resources in the system directly for the best 
performance. The software DVD player installs a DirectShow filter for DVD video 
and audio. The filter is essentially the software code for playing MPEG-2 video, 
audio, or any other type of media stored in a computer file. When a DVD movie is 
playing, it is actually DirectShow that is doing the work. 
I 
TIP DirectShow DVD filters allow software DVD players to play the video 
and audio streams from a DVD disc. This means that with the right filter, 
any player that uses the DirectShow architecture can decode the Dolby 
Digital audio track to an S/PDIF output on a sound card or the system 
motherboard. 

Since DirectShow filters are available to other applications in the system, 
installing a DVD movie player allows other applications to play MPEG-2 video and 
DVD movies. Recent versions of the Windows Media Player can play DVD movies 
after a DVD player is added to the HTPC, and some freeware DVD players actually 
depend on other players to install filters for them. This can be a great advantage to 
HTPC hobbyists who want to experiment with freely available MPEG and DVD 
players, since only one player needs to be purchased to install the DirectShow 
filters for other players to decode and display MPEG-2 video files. 
PowerDVD 
NOTE Many video codecs for the Windows OS are implemented as 
DirectShow filters. The MPEG-4-based DivX codec (not to be confused 
with the short-lived Divx proprietary video disc format) is also a filter, 
which means that installing it will allow other applications to play 
DivX-encoded files. With the right filters, Windows Media Player can 
be the only video playback application you ever use! 
Among the commercial software DVD players available for the Wmdows OS, 
one popular player is PowerDVD from CyberLink (http: I /www. gocyber link. com). 
PowerDVD has all the features of a consumer electronics hardware DVD player 
such as repeat play, zooming, color adjustments, full navigation controls, and 
onscreen display, and it is compatible with VCD and SVCD discs. It also has the 
special features that only software DVD players can offer, such as the ability to 
place bookmarks anywhere in a movie and then jump back to them later. Software 
DVD players can also capture still images from a DVD program and save them 
as picture files to the computer's hard disk drive, and many DVD movies include 
special selections to connect to Web sites that are only available on a PC. PowerDVD 
also does Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound decoding for output to an 
external digital audio receiver. Many people find that PowerDVD has an unbeat-
able set of features for its price. 
TheaterTek DVD 
The software DVD player that is generally regarded as the best player available is 
TheaterTek DVD (http://www. theatertek.com). The DirectShowfilters installed by 
the TheaterTek player are from Ravisent, and they are absolutely unmatched in 
picture quality, even by expensive progressive-scan hardware DVD players. The 
TheaterTek DVD player includes all the features of a software DVD player, such as 
bookmarks and screen captures, but it also has a Movie Start feature that lets the 
The Software 
239

240 
user set the starting point of a movie so that it skips the opening advertisements 
and menus and just begins playing the program. This is a fantastic quality of the 
player that is well appreciated by those who watch the same movies frequently, 
and especially by those of us who are forced to watch the same movies very 
frequently by kids who are fascinated with their favorite Disney title! 
The picture quality of the various DirectShow filters is difficult to compare 
without spending a lot of time watching the same scenes with different filters. 
Most movie watchers will not notice the differences between one filter and 
another, and even enthusiasts with a keen eye for detail usually have to watch 
carefully and repeatedly to determine the nature of a deficiency. Selecting a soft-
ware DVD player with a flexible configuration for setting the aspect ratio of the 
movie picture often makes a big difference in perceived picture quality for HTPC 
systems that output video to an HDTV set. With multiple available resolutions, the 
software DVD player will need to be configured to display an undistorted video 
picture on a variety of screen sizes to find the best setting for horizontal and 
vertical resolution. The TheaterTek DVD player has great aspect ratio controls for 
just this reason. 
DVDLobby Pro 
A new type of software is becoming popular for watching DVD movies on HTPC 
systems: DVDLobby Pro (http: I /www. webpromotion. com/ cinemar I dvdlobby. html). 
This new type of software lets the user copy a collection of DVD movies to the hard 
disk drive of a computer and then watch the movies by playing them back from 
the hard disk or from a DVD jukebox drive. This is essentially just a way to cata-
logue and store DVD movies the same way that it is possible to store audio CDs, 
but the DVDLobby Pro software also lets the user configure title screens, Web 
links, and intra clips for each movie. This is a great way to turn an HTPC into the 
ultimate home theater movie machine, with movies available instantly and lots 
of extra information from Web links and movie trailers or featurettes. Of course, 
storing just one DVD movie takes an average of 4GB of hard disk space, so having a 
collection of movies requires either a huge hard disk capacity in the HTPC or a fast 
network connection to a file server. It is a way of experiencing movies that is 
unavailable from any device except an HTPC. 
Bundled Software 
Software DVD players are sometimes bundled with video cards, and these players 
can be great features that make a video card more attractive for use in an HTPC. 
The ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon series of cards includes the ATI DVD player, which 
includes DirectShow filters from Ravisent, the same company that provides the 
filters for the TheaterTek DVD player. Though the Ravisent filters for the ATI player 

are not the exact same ones for the TheaterTek player, they do provide very good 
picture quality. 
The ASUS GeForce4 MX card includes a software DVD player called 
ASUSDVD2000, which is a version of the PowerDVD player. The advantage to 
using a bundled software DVD player such as those that the ATI and ASUS video 
cards include is that the hardware acceleration is guaranteed to be compatible. 
The disadvantage is that if the video card is changed, the player will no longer 
work. These players install DirectShow filters that are made specifically for the 
video hardware with which they are bundled, and they will not function with other 
video cards, so the HTPC system can lose the critical ability to play DVD movies if 
hardware is changed. For this reason, a commercially available software DVD 
player is a recommended addition to every HTPC that plays DVD movies. 
Zoom Player 
One more software DVD player that is worth your consideration is the Zoom 
Player. This media player can use the DirectShow filters installed by other software 
DVD players to play DVD movies. The unique thing about the Zoom Player is that 
it allows you to manually select the filters that are used, giving you a great level 
of control over the playback of the video and audio from a DVD disc. The Zoom 
Player includes no filters of its own, so it will not work without another software 
DVD player installed, but it does support all media types via DirectShow filters, 
so you can use it to view almost any video file. 
CD Audio and MP3 Players 
Many audio formats are available to the HTPC hobbyist. Fortunately, they can all 
coexist on the same system, so there is no need to forego any of them. CD audio is 
the original digital audio format that almost every computer system can play, but 
in the last few years the most popular format has become the MP3 audio file. 
The MP3 audio file format has become a target for critics who claim that PCs 
make it easy for people to make and distribute illegal copies of protected music 
and audio programs. Though this is a problem for artists, copyright holders, and 
the computer industry, it is not the MP3 format that is to blame for this illegal 
activity. Music files can be compressed by a number of techniques into a number 
of different file types, so eliminating the MP3 format will not correct the problem. 
Also, the laws of most countries allow people to make copies or backups of copy-
righted material for personal use, so eliminating the MP3 format will reduce 
legitimate personal liberties. Finally, the MP3 file format can be used to digitize 
and compress noncopyrighted material such as personal recordings and works in 
the public domain. The criminal stigma attached to MP3 files is irrational and 
undeserved. 
The Software 
241 

Chapter9 
242 
In the early days of the MP3 format, it was necessary to install special software 
onto a computer in order to play an MP3 file. Several popular players emerged, 
includingWinAmp, WinMP3, FreeAmp, and MUSICMATCH. These players quickly 
added features that catalogued and converted audio CD tracks to MP3 and other 
formats. The result is a variety of full-featured media players that play every type 
of audio and video file, and can search the local hard disk drive or the Internet for 
free or fee-based music. Some of these applications, such as RealPlayer and 
MUSICMATCH, remain popular with devoted fans. 
All of the recent versions of the Windows OS include the Windows Media 
Player, which can play MP3 and WMA compressed audio files. This means that the 
Windows-based HTPC no longer needs extra software to play MP3 files. The latest 
version of the Windows Media Player even supports playlists and has a number of 
bemusing and entertaining screen patterns that pulse and flicker to the music 
(WinAmp has this as well). The HTPC is easily transformed into a home jukebox 
without adding any extra software. 
There are a few reasons to keep using the alternative audio players, though. 
Some formats, such as Real (http: I /www. real. com), are not supported by the 
Wmdows Media Player because of licensing issues, so the RealOne Player software 
is required to playback files of this type. Some users prefer the simple interface and 
small program size ofWinAmp, which has many great features, including playlists, 
a sound equalizer, visual screen patterns that change with the music, and lots of 
free plug-ins to download. Others have grown accustomed to the music-cata-
loguing feature of the MUSICMATCH software and also appreciate its ability to 
create MP3 files from audio CD tracks. Music playback on the HTPC is a personal 
choice for the right combination offeatures, functionality, and convenience. 
Digital Picture Viewers 
The newest version ofWindows, Windows XP, includes a feature that lets you jump 
from image to image in a collection of digital pictures. Previously, you had to open, 
view, and then close each file before you could view the next. This inconvenience 
was overcome by a number of image viewers that featured a "slide show" mode. 
The slide show could progress through every image in a folder automatically on 
a timer or manually with a key press or mouse click. Such applications as Irfan-
Viewer (freeware) and ACDSee became popular because they make viewing a 
collection of images very convenient. ACDSee even has a great file navigation 
interface that makes finding pictures on a crowded hard disk drive easier by 
showing thumbnails and previews. Though these applications remain popular, 
the Windows OS is slowly but surely integrating all of these features with each new 
release. The HTPC based on the latest version ofWindows XP already has features 
that make it perfect for family slide shows and vacation picture viewings. 

Media Recorders 
An HTPC can do more than just play media files. You can give almost any HTPC 
system the power to record media files by installing the right software. Most 
hobbyists will want systems that can play DVD movies and various audio files, 
but some more ambitious HTPC owners want systems that can record video and 
audio files. Recorded media can also be edited, processed, and archived, which 
makes the HTPC far more versatile than a simple VCR or an audiocassette 
recorder. 
Recording Video 
Capturing video to an HTPC is generally done for one of two purposes: to record 
programming that will be viewed later or to record video that will be edited, 
compressed, or otherwise manipulated. Recording video has been the province 
of the VCR for decades, and though recordable DVD is slowly becoming available, 
the price is still too high for most people to buy into it. Editing video is also expen-
sive-proper video editing equipment is costly and not easy to use. In the past 
few years, however, the personal computer has changed the business of video 
recording and editing. The HTPC can do both of these tasks with the right software 
installed, and for a reasonable cost. 
Digital Video Recorders 
Though the term is rather generic, the digital video recorder (DVR) is a very 
specific type of device. It is a video recorder that stores video on a hard disk drive. 
The DVR can simply play back programs like a VCR, allowing you to fast forward or 
reverse, or jump ahead to skip segments (such as commercials). Unlike a VCR, the 
DVR can jump instantly to any point in the program because the information is 
stored on quickly accessible hard disk drives. The DVR can also record a program 
while you are watching it. When you pause the playback, the DVR keeps recording, 
and you can then continue to watch the program from where you paused it while 
the machine keeps recording. This allows for rewinding and replaying programs 
while you are recording them. The DVR has added many new convenient features 
for the viewer, and DVR software for recording programming from television 
broadcasts is now so full-featured and powerful that the HTPC can compete with 
the TiVo and other digital recorders. 
WinDVR is an application from InterVideo (http: I !www. intervideo. com) that 
turns a PC into a DVR. This software is a great addition to an HTPC with a televi-
sion tuner or video input adapter. The WinDVR software has all the features of a 
The Software 
243 

Chapter9 
244 
full DVR system, including recording, timers, pausing and replaying live programs, 
and high-quality video. By integrating DVR features into an HTPC, the cost of the 
DVR is reduced, since adding WmDVR to an HTPC is much cheaper than buying a 
TiVo or UltimateTV device. 
The greatest disadvantage of a TiVo or UltimateTV device is that no matter 
how much hard disk drive space is inside the box, once it is full, you must erase 
something to record more programming. You can play back the stored programs 
to a VCR to record them permanently (or as permanently as magnetic media will 
allow), but this requires a VCR and the time it takes to play a program to tape. A 
DVR-enabled HTPC with a CD-R drive installed can burn recorded programs to a 
blank CD-R to free up disk capacity. The CD-R is a more permanent storage media 
than a videotape, and blank CD-Rs are cheaper than VHS tapes. At typical VCD 
quality, a CD-R can hold about an hour of programming. Plus, with DVD-R prices 
steadily falling, this larger capacity storage medium will become even more 
appealing. 
Most television tuner cards come with bundled software that can add some 
DVR features to an HTPC. The bundled software is usually able to record program-
ming on a timer and lets the viewer fast forward or reverse the video and jump 
around to various points. Some of the bundled applications actually offer "live 
television'' features, such as the ability to pause and restart programs while they 
are being recorded, or the ability to skip commercials by starting to view the 
program after it has started, and then jumping ahead over commercial breaks 
until the DVR catches up to where the program is actually playing. Though these 
bundled DVR applications may limit the video formats that can be captured and 
may not work with all types of video inputs in the system, they are usually suffi-
cient for most casual HTPC users. 
Video Editing Tools 
The other use for capturing video into the HTPC is for editing it with any of the 
various digital editing applications. Editing video before the PC multimedia revo-
lution required several pieces of expensive studio equipment to mix video streams 
and add transition and audio effects. All of this equipment has been replaced by 
video editing software, though with some trade-off in performance. Whereas the 
studio equipment could add special effects in real time, the video editing software 
usually requires all of the effects to be programmed, and then it takes a lot of time 
to render the effects and produce the final video file. Given the cost difference, 
almost every home-video maker chooses the PC method. 
Video editing tools all work essentially the same way. Video is imported from 
a camcorder, VCR, or other video source to provide the raw material for the final 
video. A timeline is used to arrange video clips and the transitions between them. 

Multiple audio tracks can be added to the timeline, along with text titles, digital 
pictures, slow motion or fast motion effects, or anything else that the video editing 
software allows. The completed timeline is then processed into a final video file. 
To simply convert home movies on a camcorder to digital video files, you can 
place the raw video on the timeline without any edits (usually the start and ending 
are cropped to remove unrelated scenes that may be before or after the desired 
segment) and then rendered into a format such as Video CD (VCD) or Digital 
Video (DV). These file formats are suitable for burning to a CD-R or writing back 
to a digital camcorder tape for storage. 
Some software video editors, such as Adobe Premiere, are very full-featured. 
This application allows multiple video streams to be mixed into one stream, which 
provides for some excellent cross-fading transition effects and great background/ 
foreground combinations. Premiere also has multiple audio tracks on the time-
line, which makes it easy to synchronize the background music or an audio 
commentary. The one feature that Premiere is lacking is the capability to create 
MPEG format video files in one step, which is a widely compatible format used by 
DVD players for DVD, VCD, and SVCD video discs. 
Simpler (and less expensive) video editing applications are available that have 
just enough features to make casual movie makers happy. MGIVideoWave is a 
popular application because it is bundled with several video-capturing devices. 
Though it lacks the full-featured timeline that Premiere uses, its timeline does 
allow for some simpler transitions and video effects. It is possible to add multiple 
audio layers to the edited video, but it is difficult to carefully synchronize the 
audio. The great thing about Video Wave is that it can output the final video file 
in almost any format. This is helpful for those home movie makers who want to 
create high-quality versions of their movies for archiving and low-quality versions 
fore-mailing or for uploading to their Web sites. Video Wave could even be used to 
render the video produced by other applications, such as Premiere, into the 
preferred format. 
A lot of video editing tools are available, and if you want to edit video on your 
HTPC, you should search the Internet and other sources of information for the 
one that suites your needs best. When you select video editing software, look for 
support for importing video from digital and analog sources, and at various reso-
lutions. The features of the video timeline are important-if you will use the 
software to simply convert home movies to digital formats, then a simple timeline 
is sufficient, but if you will edit the video into entertaining and artistic clips, then 
a timeline that allows precise control over the video and audio elements is prefer-
able. Finally, consider how you will use the final video file. If you plan to archive 
the video to VCD, SVCD, or DVD, then the video editing software you purchase 
must be able to create MPEG and MPEG-2 format files. If you are going to simply 
copy the video files to a CD-R or back to a digital tape, then these formats are not 
important. 
The Software

Recording Audio 
By far the largest audio recording activity on the PC currently is the conversion of 
audio CD tracks to MP3 or some other compressed digital audio format. As we 
mentioned earlier, this has gained the stigma of being a dishonest or illegal 
activity, but it is not illegal or dishonest as long as the audio files are not distrib-
uted or shared with others. Many people have vast collections of audio CDs that 
are inconvenient to search through, especially if the CDs are not cataloged or even 
sorted alphabetically. Storing music on an HTPC allows for an almost unimagin-
ably immense collection of music that is searchable and playable instantly. 
Those who like to listen to hours and hours of music are forced to switch discs 
every hour or so, and even a CD carousel cannot hold as much music as an HTPC 
and cannot switch between discs as fast as an HTPC can jump from song to song. 
Compressed digital audio formats such as MP3 have become so popular that 
portable players are widely available, and even car stereo systems feature MP3 
playback from CD-R or hard disk drives. There is just no substitute for having 
thousands of songs instantly available at the touch of a button. 
To convert the tracks on an audio CD to MP3 files, you'll need special soft-
ware. When MP3s were first introduced on the PC, it was a difficult process to find 
software that could read the digital information from an audio CD and then find 
compressing software that could compress raw digital audio files to MP3 format. 
Fortunately, this is a much simpler process today. Many applications simply wait 
for an audio CD to be loaded into the computer, and then they read the tracks and 
write MP3 files out to the hard disk drive in one step. Thanks to the Gracenote 
online database (http: I /www. gracenote. com), you don't even have to supply the 
album or song names-the software just connects to the Gracenote Web site and 
looks up the audio CD to get the track information. 
Quality 
You can manually configure the quality of the MP3 files that are produced, and 
you'll often do this to suit your personal tastes after some experimentation. Since 
audio CD is a stereo format, MP3 files made from audio CD tracks should be 
stereo or joint stereo. Joint stereo compresses some of the redundant information 
from the left and right tracks into one track, though for some types of music this 
technique is not suitable. Most people find that a bit rate of 128 Kbps is sufficient 
for joint stereo tracks, and higher bit rates must be used for true stereo; half the 
bit rate is used for each side of a true stereo track, so a: 128 Kbps file in true stereo 
has two 64 Kbps audio tracks, which is not generally sufficient. For true stereo, 
192 Kbps is a good starting rate and you can increase this as necessary. For HTPC 
systems with lots of hard disk space set aside for MP3s, a setting of 256 Kbps is 
pretty much good enough for everything. 

NOTE Converting the raw digital audio tracks on an audio CD to 
compressed digital audio files such as MP3 is referred to as ripping by 
most hardcore enthusiasts. This term is a little misleading, as nothing is 
really ripped-it should be called "converting," "compressing," or "copying," 
though that might sound a lot less impressive. 
A popular application for converting audio CDs to MP3 files is MUSICMATCH 
Jukebox (http: I lwww. mus icmatch. com). MUSICMATCH Jukebox can read audio 
tracks from an audio CD and convert them to MP3 files on a hard disk drive. It also 
connects to the Gracenote database to get the album and track information, saving 
you the time and effort of retyping this info. You can configure and customize the 
software to save the MP3 tracks by artist, album, and file, or any combination of 
these attributes. MUSICMATCH Jukebox can then catalogue and play back all the 
MP3 files in the HTPC. Since the MP3 format is widely compatible with portable 
players, MUSICMATCH Jukebox is a great way to build a collection of audio CDs 
into a collection of MP3s for an HTPC and all the other MP3 devices out there. 
Windows Media Audio Files 
The MP3 format is not the only compressed digital audio format available for 
HTPC hobbyists. Microsoft offers the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format 
as a close competitor to MP3. WMA is capable of compressing raw digital audio a 
little more than MP3 without losing quality, so it allows slightly more music to fit 
into the same amount of disk space. The Windows Media Player that comes with 
recent versions of the Windows OS has support for creating and playing WMA files, 
so no additional software is needed for the HTPC. The WMA file format is not as 
widely used and not as widely compatible with portable audio players as MP3, 
which makes the WMA files somewhat less useable, though an HTPC can play the 
WMA format just as easily as the MP3 format. Newer versions ofWindows Media 
Player can also encrypt MP3 files as well, so they can only be played on that indi-
vidual player. 
Another popular format is the RealAudio format (http: I lwww. real. com). You 
need the Real One Player to create and play back this format. Though RealAudio is 
not widely compatible with portable devices and not tremendously popular for 
compressing audio CDs, it does have the advantage of supporting video and audio 
media types, and it allows for video and audio streaming from the Internet. Several 
Web sites provide programming for the Real One Player, and an HTPC that is 
connected to the Internet is a great device for playing streaming media programs. 
Finally, we'd like to make special mention of one more video and audio format 
available for the Windows OS. The QuickTime format from Apple Computer 
The Software 
247 

Chapter9 
248 
(http: I lwww. apple. com) was originally developed for their Macintosh platform, 
but it has been adapted for the PC under the Windows OS. This format is popular 
because it is used to create particularly high -quality movie trailers, which are 
always popular with movie fans. The introduction of DVD movies has brought 
high -quality home theater to millions of people, and many of us wait anxiously 
for each new DVD release to hit the shelves. While you wait for a new movie 
release to appear at the video store, why not download the trailer and show it off 
in high-quality fashion to your friends and family? No HTPC should be without 
the QuickTime player to watch movie trailers. 
The HTPC Project Hardware 
For this book, we are installing software on two HTPC machines. The first is a fast, 
new machine that we want to use for much more than just watching DVD movies. 
We will use this machine to capture video from a camcorder and edit, render, and 
burn the results to CD-R discs. Since this machine will be connected to a digital 
audio receiver, we also want to play MP3 and audio CD music in the home theater 
room. This HTPC is connected to an HDTV set, so it will be used to up-convert 
NTSC video sources to a higher resolution and, of course, we also want great DVD 
movie playback. 
The second machine is an older system that we want primarily to use for 
watching DVD movies and playing MP3 audio. This machine will be connected to 
a network, and with no need for a lot of hard disk drive capacity to store music or 
video, it will have a small disk drive and so a relatively limited amount of room to 
install software. Though this machine is a few years old, we expect to get great 
performance for movies and music. 
HTPC System 1 
The first software we want to install on this system is PowerStrip. Since we will use 
this HTPC to up-convert NTSC sources and display them on an HDTY, we need to 
be able to configure the video card to output the desired HDTV resolutions and 
to convert the interlaced source video to progressive-scan video for the display. 
This HDTV set has a built-in line-doubler, so the NTSC video sources could be 
connected directly to the set, but using the HTPC to up-convert the video lets us 
control the overscan and picture settings with the PowerStrip utility. It also has the 
advantage of allowing us to access the HTPC desktop features at any time, which 
lets us access e-mail, Internet chat, and Web browsing without switching the input 
selection on the display. 

Since we assembled this system with the ATI AU-In-Wonder Radeon 7500, 
which includes the ATI Remote Wonder, we're using the bundled ATI software to 
control the machine. If we find that this software is too limited for use with other 
applications, we'll try to configure Girder, but since this machine also has a wire-
less RF keyboard and mouse, Girder probably won't be necessary. 
For DVD playback, the ATI video card comes with the ATI DVD Player, which 
is a pretty great quality player. This player supports the Dolby Digital audio track 
output to an S/PDIF connector, so we should get great video and audio perform-
ance from the ATI player. The ATI software also includes support for the television 
tuner in the video card and for other media file formats, so using the ATI bundle 
saves us a lot of money and work finding appropriate software to do DVR func-
tions and video capturing. 
To rip and store audio CDs, we are going to use the free MUSICMATCH 
Jukebox software. We can play back audio with MUSICMATCH Jukebox, though 
we also like to use the Windows Media Player because of the fascinating visualiza-
tions, along with WinAmp and one or two other freeware players. This is the great 
thing about an HTPC: We can try out different software, change our configuration, 
and experiment with settings as much as we want until we find the application 
that works best. 
HTPC System 2 
This system will connect to a television set through an S-video cable, so utilities 
such as PowerStrip and DScaler are not required. The television is actually a 
progressive-scan HDTV-compatible set, but it has a built-in line-doubler, so the 
NTSC video sent to it will be properly displayed. Eventually, this system could 
include a VGA-to-component transcoder, but we are trying to keep the cost down 
for now. 
This machine features a GeForce4 MX video card, which has good MPEG-2 
hardware acceleration features. We asked the TheaterTek people about the 
compatibility of this card with their excellent TheaterTek DVD Player, and they 
sent us a copy of the software to evaluate. We plan to try this software DVD player 
on this system through the S-video output and through the VGA-to-component 
transcoder borrowed from the other system. 
To play music, rip audio CDs, and store compressed digital audio, we're going 
to use the Windows Media Player and its WMA format audio files. We're also going 
to use MUSICMATCH Jukebox to compress some test audio CDs to MP3 files. This 
should make an interesting comparison between the two formats, as it will allow 
us to compare audio quality and file sizes for the same discs. Ideally, we'll try to 
pick a preferred format to reduce the number of applications installed, but since 
The Software 
249 

Chapter9 
250 
the HTPC is a versatile machine, it easily supports a variety of file formats for 
audio and video, and we really don't have to pick one over another. 
Installing software on our HTPC systems is easily the most complicated part of 
building the machine. Selecting the software is difficult because of a bewildering 
variety of file formats, software applications, and uses for the HTPC. Fortunately, 
we have decided which applications to use (for now, anyway). To find out how the 
systems perform when they have this software installed, see Chapter 11. 
Summary 
In this chapter, we examined how important software can be in creating a great 
HTPC. Software is at the heart of managing custom resolutions to get the best 
picture possible, playing MP3s, and setting up the ultimate remote control. In 
the next chapter, we'll look even closer at some of the software available for the 
HTPC-specifically, the utilities that allow you to tweak your system to perfection. 

CHAPTER 10 
The Power of PowerStrip 
CoNNECTING AN HTPC to a high-resolution display device such as a high -definition 
television (HDTV) brings out the best possible picture quality that the system 
can offer. To many home theater enthusiasts, this configuration is the reason for 
having an HTPC. Without an HTPC, the HDTV requires expensive equipment to 
get the same scaling, deinterlacing, and progressive-scan picture output. Though 
an HTPC is a very versatile machine with great practical application for use with a 
standard NTSC television, connecting it to an HDTV is the pinnacle of the home 
theater experience. 
The HTPC is not a simple machine to mate with an HDTV-compatible display. 
The VGA output of a computer is not compatible with most television sets, so 
special hardware is required to convert it to the component input that HDTV sets 
accept. (For more information about the hardware connections, see Chapters 4 
and 8.) Once the connections are made, special software is then required to make 
the output from the HTPC's video card compatible with HDTV formats. Software 
utilities such as PowerStrip, YXY Scaler, and DScaler are available for download 
and are mostly intuitive and easy to configure. PowerStrip, however, includes no 
manual and is notoriously cluttered with arcane settings that can confuse and 
intimidate new users. This chapter provides a basic guide for using PowerStrip. 
PowerStrip 
En Tech's PowerStrip utility (http: I lwww. entechtaiwan. com/ps. htm) is one of 
the most popular and important software utilities for the HTPC industry. This 
software makes it possible to set a video card to display screen resolutions and 
timings that most Windows drivers do not support. PC users are familiar with 
common screen resolutions such as 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768, but 
the HDTV specification does not use these PC settings. PC users are also used to 
setting the refresh rate as high as their monitor will allow, since most PC monitors 
can adjust to multiple frequencies, but HDTV devices typically run at only one 
frequency, 60 Hz, and cannot adjust to anything else. The one resolution and 
frequency timing that is shared by PCs and HDTVs is 640x480 at 60Hz, but this 
is a very low resolution compared to the vast capabilities of an HDTY. Without 
PowerStrip and utilities like it, there would be no way to get a higher picture 
resolution. 
251 

Chapter 10 
252 
Video Resolution and Bandwidth 
The confusion in using a utility like PowerStrip comes from the different methods 
of setting computer screen formats and HDTV formats. Computer screen resolu-
tions are pretty easy to understand: The screen is measured in pixels, and the user 
simply selects the number of pixels wide and the number of pixels tall, plus the 
refresh rate, and the computer outputs the appropriate mode. If the monitor is 
capable of displaying the picture that the computer is generating, then the user 
can see the computer image. If the monitor is not capable of displaying the 
picture, then it usually shows a wildly flickering and incoherent image, or it goes 
blank. 
An HDTV; on the other hand, does not really work by setting the resolution 
and frequency. Instead, the HDTV works on the bandwidth of the video signal. 
The wider the bandwidth, the more information can be carried in the video signal, 
and the higher the resolution of the picture. When discussing the resolution of 
HDTV video, it is important to remember that resolution refers to the number 
of horizontal scan lines, which is a measure of the vertical resolution. The hori-
zontal resolution does not affect the bandwidth, and almost any horizontal 
resolution can be used for a given vertical resolution. 
NOTE A standard NTSC video signal is (theoretically) 525 lines times 30 
frames per second, which equals a bandwidth of 15.750 KHz. NTSC video 
is interlaced, so each frame is composed of two fields of scan lines, which 
means that the video signal is actually 60 fields per second. Progressively 
scanned video is composed of 60 complete frames per second. Thus, a 
progressive-scan video signal with the same number of scan lines uses 
twice the bandwidth, or 31.5 KHz. 
The way bandwidth determines resolution actually applies to both computer 
and HDTV video signals, but the PC hides this from the user by providing a prede-
termined selection of resolutions from which to choose. The predetermined list 
of available resolutions for computer displays does not match the configuration of 
HDTV displays, however, except at 640x480 at 60Hz. PowerStrip converts infor-
mation about HDTV video bandwidth to custom resolutions and timings that 
computer users can understand. 
One other issue to keep in mind when you configure HDTV resolutions and 
timings in PowerStrip is that most consumer televisions sets suffer from at least 
some overscan. Overscan refers to the amount of the video image that is outside 
the display area of the set. Most televisions, including HDTV sets, have anywhere 

The Power of PowerStrip 
from 5 to 15 percent overscan, which means that 5 to 15 percent of the image is 
actually beyond the frame of the picture. This is barely noticeable for most televi-
sion programming-broadcasters leave the outside of the video image empty of 
information-but when you're showing a computer desktop image on a television 
set, this means that the Windows task bar, the Start button, and anything else at 
the edge of the screen is not visible. 
PowerStrip Settings 
HDTVresolutions are based are based on three bandwidth values. These band-
widths can be used to display a progressively scanned image with a specified 
number of scan lines and just about any horizontal resolution, or an interlaced 
image with twice the number of scan lines and just about any horizontal reso-
lution (see Table 10-1). Since a progressive-scan video signal uses the same 
bandwidth as an interlaced signal with twice the resolution, any HDTV that 
supports a given progressive-scan format should work with the accompanying 
interlaced format.

The goal for configuring PowerStrip is to set the HTPC video card to output a 
resolution at a refresh rate that matches one of the HDTV formats. Not all HDTV 
sets support all of the bandwidths specified by the HDTV standard. Quite a few 
seem to lack compatibility with the 45 KHz rate, which means that the 720p I 1440i 
modes are not available. It is important to check the specifications of the display 
device before you connect it to an HTPC and use PowerStrip to set custom resolu-
tions and timings, because some sets could be damaged if they try to synchronize 
themselves to a bandwidth that is too high. 
You should install and run PowerStrip on your HTPC while the system is 
connected to a multisynch computer monitor instead of the home theater display. 
This is easier and safer, since the computer monitor can display a much wider 
range of resolutions and refresh rates than an HDT\T, and it prevents damage to an 
expensive display device. One common problem that occurs when you configure 
PowerStrip is that an adjustment causes the HDTV to lose synchronization with 
253 

Chapter 10

the video signal, and the computer desktop is no longer visible. This makes it 
rather difficult to correct the situation, since there is no way to tell what is 
happening on the screen. Using a multisynch computer monitor will save you 
a lot of frustration and guesswork. 
Hotkey Manager Configuration 
The first configuration that you should do in PowerStrip is to set the safe mode of 
640x480 to a keyboard hotkey so that you can reset the HTPC to a visible display 
even when the screen is corrupted. PowerStrip features a Hotkey Manager that 
lets you map many of its functions to keyboard commands. For example, the 
command Ctrl-Alt-0 is already mapped to display the current screen mode. To 
map the video mode 640x480 to a hotkey command, switch to the screen resolu-
tion and save it as a profile. It will then appear in the Hotkey Manager window and 
be available for mapping to a keyboard command. To do this, follow these steps: 
1. 
After you've installed PowerStrip and it's running, click the system tray 
icon to open the PowerStrip menu. 
2. 
In the menu, select Display Profiles and then Configure. 
3. 
In the Display Profiles configuration window, slide the Resolution selector 
until "640 x 480 pixels" is displayed. Click the Apply button at the bottom 
of the screen and let PowerStrip change the current screen mode. 
4. 
In the Color Depth section, make sure that the color depth is set to 
"TrueColor (32 bit)" or the highest color depth value available. 
5. 
In the Refresh Rate area, the refresh rate should be 60 Hz. If it isn't, change 
it by selecting Standard Discrete Timing from the drop-down list box. 
6. 
In the Profiles section, click the Save As button. A dialog window will pop 
up to let you name the profile-use the default name "640 x 480 pixels, 
TrueColor (32-bit)". 
7. 
Now that the profile is saved, it is available in the Hotkey Manager. Close 
the Display Profiles configuration window. Click the PowerStrip icon in 
the system tray to open the PowerStrip menu. 
8. 
In the menu, select Options and then Hotkey Manager. The window 
shown in Figure 10-l will appear.

9. 
In the Hot Keys window, scroll down the "Functions and profiles" list to 
find the "640 x 480 pixels" mode that you just added and select it. 
10. Assign a keyboard command by picking a global modifier (Ctrl-Alt is the 
default) and typing a keystroke in the "Hot key selection'' field. Many 
PowerStrip users map a number of screen modes to a series of keyboard 
commands, and it's a good idea to select a series of keys that are grouped 
together for this purpose. The bottom row of letters is suitable for this, as 
those letters aren't already used by PowerStrip for anything. 
11. Close the Hot Keys window. 
With this keyboard command available, it is a little safer to proceed with 
further custom resolutions and timings. It is also a good idea to add to the Hotkey 
Manager the video modes that have been configured and are known to work 
properly. This is a fast and convenient way to switch between modes. 
To set up the first new custom resolution in PowerStrip, leave the HTPC 
connected to the multisynch computer monitor. You can do the configuration 
with the monitor attached, and then you can connect the HD1V to try it out. It is 
always a good idea to tum off the computer and display device when you connect 
and disconnect them, but most people encounter no problems when changing 
connections while the computer is running.

TIP Remember, connecting an HTPC to an HDTV requires a VGA-to-
component transcoder. PowerStrip is useless when used with S-video or 
composite video output. 
Adding a Custom Resolution 
Most consumer HDTV sets are capable of displaying a 1080i video mode, which is 
the same bandwidth as a 540p mode. The 1080i mode is difficult to work with 
because it is interlaced and a very high resolution. This makes it hard to adjust 
settings in this mode, since it is very difficult to read text on the screen. For this 
reason, the 540p mode is probably the best one to choose for the first custom 
resolution on the HTPC. To define the new resolution in PowerStrip, follow these 
steps: 
1. 
Click the PowerStrip icon in the system tray to open the PowerStrip menu. 
2. 
In the menu, select Display Profiles and then choose Configure to open 
the Display Profiles configuration window. 
3. 
In the Display Profiles configuration window, click the Advanced timing 
options button. 
4. 
In the Advanced timing options window, click the Custom resolutions 
button. 
5. 
The Custom resolutions window is where new resolutions are created. 
There is a list of predefined resolutions on the left-hand side. A radio 
button below the list allows you to see the User Defined custom resolu-
tions-these are the video modes that have been set up already. The 
right-hand side of the window contains the various customization 
controls for the video modes. 
On the left-hand side of the window, scroll through the list of predefined 
custom resolutions to find the first 960x540 resolution listed. This should 
be the "960x540p (HDTV standard)" resolution, but any 960x540p reso-
lution will do. 
6. 
When you select the 960x540p resolution, the right side of the window 
will show the settings for this resolution. Note that the "Refresh rate" fields 
should show 34 for the horizontal field and 60 for the vertical field. 

The Power of PowerStrip 
7. 
The "Front porch," "Sync width," and "Back porch'' settings control how 
the picture is centered and sized on the HDTV screen. These settings are 
easier to adjust later, so leave them alone for now. 
When you set up further custom resolutions, you can set the porch and 
sync values to match values for existing video modes with the same hori-
zontal bandwidth. 
8. 
You should leave the "Polarity," "Composite sync," and "Sync on green" 
controls at their default settings. The "Interlaced" check box should be off 
because the vertical refresh rate is 60 Hz, which indicates that this is a 
progressively scanned, not interlaced, video image. 
9. 
Click the Add new resolution button. PowerStrip will display a message 
that says the computer needs to be restarted to see if the display driver 
will accept the new resolution. Click the Restart button and let the HTPC 
reboot itself. 
10. After the system has rebooted, click the PowerStrip icon in the system tray 
to open the PowerStrip menu. 
11. On the PowerStrip menu, select Display Profiles and then choose 
Configure to open the Display Profiles configuration window. 
12. Move the Resolution slider control to find the new "960 x 540 pixels" 
resolution that you just added. 
13. Click the Apply button to switch to the new display mode. 
14. If the screen comes up in the new resolution, click the Yes button to stay 
in the new mode. 
15. Click the Advanced timing options button to open the Advanced timing 
options window. 
16. With the display in the new mode, you can use the Advanced timing 
options window (see Figure 10-2) to make minor adjustments to the loca-
tion of the screen in the display. It is not a good idea to change the width 
or height of the display in this window-you should do this by setting a 
"resolution inside a resolution," as explained in the next section. You can 
adjust the picture to the left and right or up and down in this window.

17. After the picture is properly centered, click OK to get back to the Display 
Profiles window. 
18. Save the resolution by clicking the Save as button and using the default 
name. This resolution will now show up on the PowerStrip menu available 
from the system tray icon, making it easier to switch to it. 
19. Click OK again to return to the Windows desktop. 
The HTPC should now be set to display the new 960x540 resolution mode. You 
can connect the HD1V display via the transcoder to confirm that the mode works 
on the television set. If the picture is visible after a second or two, then the configu-
ration is working. If the picture does not stabilize or is not visible at all, then the 
television is not capable of displaying the 540p or 1 080i HD1V resolution. As 
this is a very common mode for consumer HD1V sets, most should support this 
resolution. 
The exact vertical and horizontal refresh timings depend on the video card 
and the HD1V set in use. Each model is slightly more or less tolerant of custom 
timings, and tweaking the picture will result in different values for different hard-
ware, even for the same video modes. Those with rear projection HD1V sets or 

The Power of PowerStrip 
three-tube front-projector sets will notice picture geometry and color conver-
gence problems unless all custom resolutions are set up with the same (or very 
similar) vertical and horizontal refresh values. Keeping the front porch, sync, and 
back porch values the same is also important. If you create a new resolution with 
twice the horizontal resolution, then you should double the porch and sync values 
(e.g., it is possible to create a 1920x540p mode from the 960x540p mode-the 
horizontal and vertical refresh rates should be the same, the vertical porch and 
sync should be the same, but the horizontal porch and sync should be doubled). 
Unless you have adjusted the HDTV to reduce overscan, the 960x540 mode 
will leave the edges of the computer desktop invisible off the screen. This makes 
it practically impossible to find the Start menu or the system tray icons. Use the 
hotkey mapping to return the display to the 640x480 mode if that makes it easier 
to see the edges of the desktop, or reconnect the multisync computer monitor to 
continue setting up more custom resolutions. 
Resolution Inside a Resolution 
To compensate for overscan, you can have your HDTV set professionally adjusted, 
or you can create a PowerStrip custom resolution that uses the porch settings to 
reduce the number of pixels displayed vertically and horizontally. This leaves the 
outside regions of the image blank, which is where the overscan makes them 
invisible anyway. Creating such a resolution makes it easier to use the HTPC 
desktop and other PC applications. Reducing the overscan also gives interesting 
results when you watch broadcast television or DVD movies, as the overscanned 
areas will be visible. 
The best way to create a resolution inside a resolution with PowerStrip is 
by using the Custom resolutions window, where you first created the previous 
960x540 custom resolution. It is possible to reduce the size of the display area in 
the Advanced timing options window, but because the controls on this window are 
all interrelated, it is difficult to get to the proper settings, even with the "Real-time 
adjustments" check box deselected. 
In the Custom resolutions window, click the "User defined" radio button and 
select a resolution that will be used for the base or "outside" resolution of the new 
inside resolution. This will configure the right side of the window with the correct 
bandwidth settings for a resolution that has already been set up. Then click the 
"Lock total geometry" check box so that there is a check mark in it. Now you can 
adjust the horizontal and vertical "Active pixels" fields to create the inside resolu-
tion. It is best to start with a 540p or 720p bandwidth resolution and create a 
smaller resolution inside of this. Creating a smaller resolution inside of 480p 
would result in a video mode that is too small for most HTPC uses. 
259 

Chapter 10 
260 
The new inside resolution can be any value, but it should fit inside the bounds 
of the outer resolution. If the overscan on the HDTV set is 10 percent, then setting 
new values 10 percent less than the original resolution should create a new mode 
with no overscan. Because it is difficult to guess the precise overscan amount, you 
will likely need to experiment to find a resolution that fits the desktop nicely into 
the display area, though most people find that leaving a small amount of overscan 
is preferable. Don't forget to save the new resolution in the Display profiles 
window and assignÂ· a hotkey if desired. 
Keep in mind that configuring custom resolutions in PowerStrip is about 
the most difficult thing that any HTPC hobbyist will do. It is not easy to learn how 
to use the utility, and it takes a lot of time and experimentation to learn it well 
enough to create new resolutions. A good approach is to try to set up the "stan-
dard" 480p resolution and one higher resolution such as 960x540p first, and then 
worry about other resolutions later. The resolution inside a resolution of 856x484p 
inside of 960x540p works well for the Windows desktop and makes the HPTC 
easier to use, so it this is also a good custom resolution to add next as part of a 
minimum configuration. 
There are many great Web resources for PowerStrip configurations for specific 
hardware. The AVS forum (http: I /www. avsforum. com) has a searchable discussion 
group for HTPCs that includes a lot of postings about PowerStrip settings for 
Toshiba, Sony, Hitachi, and other brands of HDTV sets. This is a good place to 
start when you're looking for solutions to PowerStrip problems. 
Summary 
PowerStrip is one of the key utilities that your HTPC will need. This chapter 
showed you the intricacies ofPowerStrip and examined the various areas where 
you can put it to work for your HTPC. In the next chapter, we take a look at the 
results and conclusions we've come to in assembling our HTPCs.

CHAPTER 11 
Results and Conclusions 
BUILDING AN HTPC for the home theater is a much different experience than 
unpacking and installing a DVD player. Though the HTPC machine has more 
features and capabilities than an off-the-shelf player, it is also more frustrating 
and takes much longer to tune to perfection (if "perfection" is even possible!). 
This book has dealt with selecting hardware and software, and has given you some 
suggestions for installation and configuration, but it has not covered the lengthy 
process of experimentation, fine-tuning, and problem-solving that goes into an 
HTPC. For most hobbyists, this process is the fun part-making improvements 
to a machine that was already superior to a consumer DVD player is ultimately 
satisfying. It can also be difficult to puzzle through the unknown and learn from 
mistakes. This chapter, then, is a summary of the troubles and triumphs we had 
while building our HTPC machines for this project. 
Expectations have a major bearing on the success of any HTPC project. 
Anyone new to the world of PCs or expecting a "plug it in and play it" experience 
with an HTPC, even a prebuilt system, will likely be confounded. Even a well-
tuned and configured machine needs more poking and prodding than an 
off-the-shelfDVD player. The advantage of this is that the HTPC is almost infi-
nitely tunable-even when it seems that the DVD picture is perfect or the MP3 
sound is ideal, new hardware, new software, new drivers, or some new utility 
will come along to improve it. For this reason the HTPC machine is never really 
"finished." Those home theater enthusiasts who expect to buy it, plug it in, and 
forget about it will be disappointed with such a system. 
We expected the HTPC systems that we built for this project to change contin-
uously. We evaluated a lot of hardware in both systems to see what worked well, 
including video cards, sound cards, and even CPUs of different speeds and capa-
bilities. Additionally, we did not try to assemble a completed HTPC all at once. 
It took many months of configuring hardware and software before we even had 
one machine to try in the home theater room. The reason we refer to building the 
HTPC as a "project" in this book is that it cannot be done in a weekend, or even a 
week. Assembly of an HTPC is a long process, especially for those of us new to the 
hobby, and allowing for plenty of time makes it much more pleasant. 
263 

Chapter 11 
264 
Hardware 
Putting together the hardware for our HTPC machines took a lot longer than we 
expected. Since we are experienced PC builders, we thought it would be quick and 
simple to assemble the parts we selected into two HTPCs. In general, the assembly 
was easy, but we found that we were constantly disassembling and reassembling 
our systems to try out different CPUs, video cards, sound cards, and other bits and 
pieces. Whenever hardware is swapped, the software in the system must be recon-
figured and new drivers installed, so changing a video card, for example, takes 
much longer than the time to physically change the card. 
HTPC System 1 
This is exactly the procedure we performed on our first test system. This HTPC 
had been built and configured with the ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 and all of 
the ATI Multimedia Center software, including the ATI DVD Player. We wanted to 
try the GeForce4 MX video card in this system to compare the DVD playback, so 
we uninstalled the ATI video driver and swapped video cards. After rebooting and 
installing the video drivers for the GeForce4 MX card, we found (as expected) that 
the ATI DVD Player would no longer work. Fortunately, the GeForce4 MX card 
came with DVD playback software, so we installed that for our test. 
Our first test system was actually two different machines during the course of 
this project. It began as a Pentium III/800 MHz system and then got upgraded to 
an Athlon XP 21 00+ system. This gave us a good chance to compare performance 
of these two processors in systems where most of the other hardware was the 
same. The video card, sound card, disk RAID controller and disk drives, DVD-
ROM, CD-R drive, and keyboard/mouse were moved from the Pentium III-based 
system to the faster Athlon XP system. Both machines had the same amount of 
RAM, but the Athlon XP system uses faster DDR RAM running at 333 MHz. 
Surprisingly, we found that both CPUs were fast enough for almost all HTPC uses, 
but the Athlon XP CPU really showed its performance advantage for recording and 
playback ofuncompressed video that was digitized from the ATI AU-In-Wonder 
Radeon 7500 television tuner. Video editing and rendering of compressed video 
was also much faster on the Athlon XP CPU due to its higher clock speed. 
NOTE An Intel Pentium running at a comparable speed would also 
perform well for video editing and rendering. Based on our testing of the 
hardware available to us, we found that Intel and AMD CPUs are both 
suitable for HTPC uses. 

Results and Conclusions 
It is important to emphasize that there was no difference in DVD playback 
quality or reliability between the Pentium III/ 800 MHz system and the Athlon XP 
2100+ system. We tried both with the ATI AU-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 and could 
not see any difference in performance or picture quality with a variety of DVD 
movies. This is not surprising, since the video card does a lot of the work of 
decoding and scaling the DVD picture to the screen, so the CPU does not need 
to be very powerful. One key reason for this is that the screen resolution we used 
with our high -definition television was based on the 540p HD1V format. Compared 
to typical PC screen resolutions, this is pretty low, so the HTPC has fewer pixels to 
draw and less data to process and push around. For HTPC systems that are used 
primarily for playing DVDs and watching television, an older and slower CPU is 
fine. 
We had one problem with the hardware in our first HTPC machine. When this 
machine was based on the Pentium III/800 MHz CPU, we tried to put the 
GeForce4 MX video card into it, but the video card did not work. The motherboard 
for the Pentium III chip was an older board that could not support the proper AGP 
slot voltage setting for the new GeForce4 MX card, and the system would not boot 
up. When we switched this machine to the Athlon XP CPU, the motherboard in 
the new system worked fine with both the ATI AU-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 and the 
GeForce4 MX video cards. This is a concern for those who are building HTPC 
systems based on older hardware, but there are plenty of excellent video cards 
that still work with the older motherboards available. 
HTPC System 2 
The second HTPC system that we built for this project is based on a Pentium 
III/ 450 MHz CPU, and we found this system to be a little slow. The DVD playback 
would occasionally stutter or jerk when we used a DVD player that used a software-
only mode. When the DVD player supported the video hardware, playback was 
completely smooth. The system took several seconds to start up an application, so 
switching from watching television to watching a DVD movie or listening to MP3 
music was not as fast as we liked. It performed most HTPC functions fine once 
they were started, but the quick response of our faster HTPC system spoiled us for 
a faster CPU. 
One important performance issue that we were concerned about with this 
second HTPC system was the capability of the DScaler software to deinterlace the 
television channels from the Hauppauge Win1V-HD HD1V tuner card. Though 
this system is connected to our home theater display via an S-video cable, which 
means that it is outputting an interlaced video signal to the display, we wanted to 
try it with ourVGA-to-component transcoder to compare progressive-scan picture 
quality with that of our first HTPC system. The Pentium III/ 450 MHz CPU did an 
265 

Chapter 11 
266 
acceptable job running DScaler to convert the television video signal to our 
progressively scanned display, but a faster CPU would probably be better for 
systems that run DScaler, as we were unable to get good results with some of the 
DScaler video filters. 
One other quirky thing about the second HTPC system we built was finding 
drivers for the network card we used. This system is based on the Windows 98 SE 
operating system, which has excellent support for almost all computer hardware 
made in the last 5 years. However, for some reason, Windows 98 did not recognize 
the network card we installed. We were able eventually to find the proper drivers 
from the manufacturer's Web site, but anyone who has built a computer for a 
network knows that installing third-party drivers into a machine with no func-
tioning network card is a challenge because there is no way to access the Internet 
or copy the software across the network to the affected PC. Fortunately, we had 
other PCs available to help. This became an important issue while building our 
HTPC systems; it is very helpful to have another computer nearby that can access 
the Internet to get information or software for the HTPC while it is under 
construction. 
Software 
Assembling hardware was a slow process during this project, but compared to 
installing software, it was quick and easy. Even experienced PC hobbyists will 
probably find that setting up the software for an HTPC is a slow and challenging 
task. The utilities and applications that are meant specifically for home theaters 
are very specialized and, in some cases, not well polished or well documented. 
This is due to the nature of the hobby: PCs in the home theater are still relatively 
new and much of the software is distributed as freeware or shareware, not 
commercial software. That is not to say that the specialized HTPC software is 
inferior or unstable-in fact, it is mostly excellent-but it requires much under-
standing and knowledge from the user to work properly. 
HTPC System 1 
This machine features the ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 video card, so the main 
multimedia software installed is the ATI Multimedia Center, including the ATI 
DVD Player. We were skeptical about this suite of multimedia applications because 
bundled software tends to be lightweight, short on features, and inferior to task-
dedicated applications. After experimenting with the various applications in the 
ATI suite, we changed our minds. The ATI Multimedia Center software performs 
very well, has all the features we wanted, and integrates different media functions 
together easily and conveniently. 

Results and Conclusions 
The ATI DVD Player uses Ravisent DirectShow MPEG-2 filters to play the 
compressed digital video stream from the disc. The Ravisent filters are widely 
regarded as among the best available, and the ATI player certainly benefits from 
this. The picture quality is fantastic, and the performance is smooth and does not 
stutter or jerk during slow landscape pans or fast action sequences. In addition, 
the ATI software enables all of the hardware features within the video card. 
The display device used for this HTPC is a Toshiba TN55X81 HDTV-ready tele-
vision set, which is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio set. Before the HTPC was built, we 
used a stand-alone DVD player to watch movies in this home theater environment. 
The stand-alone player caused very noticeable picture problems for anamorphic 
movies (16:9 aspect ratio, or "wide-screen''), where fine details looked blocky and 
seemed to shimmer as they moved. This is due to the lack of resolution-in order to 
fit the wider picture on the screen, it must be shrunk, so that it occupies fewer of 
the scan lines in order to leave the lines at the top and bottom blank. The result is 
that a picture meant to use all of the horizontal scan lines is reduced to using just 
the ones in the middle area of the screen. 
The HTPC overcomes this problem on 4:3-shaped HDTV sets. The video mode 
is set to a higher resolution format-540 scan lines instead of 480-so that there 
are more scan lines, and the shrunken picture still occupies an area with enough 
horizontal scan lines to display fine details without shimmering. The ATI DVD 
Player lets the user control the aspect ratio, so that a video mode of 1920x540 can 
be used without distorting the DVD video image. This is our favorite resolution for 
DVDs on this 4:3 television, since it displays enough resolution horizontally and 
vertically to show fine detail. As we mentioned earlier, the 1 080i mode does not 
work well with the ATI video card drivers-the video picture is stretched so that 
the top half of the image takes up the whole display area, and the bottom is not 
visible at all. We had to limit ourselves to progressively scanned modes, but this 
was not much of a problem because the 540p modes looked fantastic. The HTPC 
is far preferable to the stand -alone player for watching movies now. 
The ATI DVD Player has one limitation that affected the audio playback capa-
bilities of our HTPC. The ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 has a coaxial digital 
audio output (an S/PDIF port), and the ATI DVD Player can pass the digital audio 
stream through to the S/PDIF port on the video card, but that is the only digital 
audio output that the DVD Player will support. The software would not send the 
digital audio signal directly to theM -Audio Delta Dio 2496, which we would prefer, 
as this card is connected via an optical cable to our digital audio receiver. Fortu-
nately, theM-Audio card has a coaxial digital audio input, so we patched the 
digital audio output on the ATI video card to the input of the Delta Dio, which 
then output it to the digital audio receiver. Those HTPC systems without an 
S/PDIF input cannot use the ATI DVD Player to output digital audio to any other 
device, so the ATI video card S/PDIF output will have to be connected to the 
digital audio receiver whenever DVD movies are played.

The ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 features a television tuner with 
composite and S-video inputs. The television tuner software is comparable to 
the software that we've seen for other television tuner cards. It has a "television on 
demand" feature that works like a personal video recorder, allowing you to pause 
live television, skip backward and forward, and record shows like a VCR. A timer 
feature lets you program the television tuner to record events on a daily, weekly, 
and yearly basis. The timer can schedule not only television recordings, but also 
playback of any multimedia file at any time. The digital VCR feature can record 
video in a variety of formats, including MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, uncompressed 
video, and the proprietary VCR format thatATI uses. Compressed formats require 
a fast CPU to record video without dropping frames, but uncompressed video uses 
a lot of disk space. Experimenting with the settings allowed us to find a nice 
balance of compression and disk space that the machine could record without 
dropping video frames. 
Perhaps the best thing about the ATI television tuner is the fantastic deinter-
lacing that it does to convert the interlaced NTSC video signal to a progressively 
scanned video image. This deinterlacing works on the television tuner and the 
composite and S-video inputs. Even fast-action sports programs such as football 
games were flawlessly deinterlaced, scaled to any resolution, and displayed on our 
HDTVset. 
The ATI File Player is an application that can take the place of the Windows 
Media Player. It can play back all types of video and audio format files, including 
VCD, SVCD, AVI, and the proprietary VCR files that the ATI television tuner uses 
to record shows. The ATI File Player can unlock the aspect ratio of the video image 
so that it displays correctly regardless of the screen aspect ratio, which is a feature 
that the Microsoft Windows Media Player lacks. This means that SVCD format 
video files (480x480 pixels) can be stretched to fill a 4:3 screen. Without stretching, 
the SVCD video makes everything look too tall and skinny. The ATI File Player can 
also be used to queue up a list of files for playback, like Windows Media Player. 
The only thing we liked better about Windows Media Player is the variety of screen 
visualizations for audio files. 
We did encounter one problem with the ATI Multimedia Center software that 
we were not able to solve. The television tuner circuits on the video card send the 
analog audio from the television channel or composite IS-video capture connector 
to a ministereo plug that is supposed to be plugged into the analog line-in input of 
a sound card. This works fine for HTPC systems with a standard sound card that 
has an analog line-in connector, but theM-Audio Delta Dio 2496 does not. We had 
to add a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! card to this HTPC system in order to get 
the analog television tuner sound from the ATI Ali-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 televi-
sion tuner. We then had to connect this sound card to the digital audio receiver's 
analog sound input ports, since the Sound Blaster Live! analog line-in does not get 
automatically digitized and sent to the digital audio output of theM-Audio sound 

Results and Conclusions 
card. If the ATI television tuner software could send audio to a digital S/PDIF port, 
or if we had selected a sound card with digital and analog sound inputs, we could 
have avoided the extra step of switching the audio receiver between analog and 
digital inputs when watching television or DVD movies. 
The last issue worth mentioning with the ATI software for our first HTPC 
system is the ATI Remote Wonder utility. The ATI video card came with the remote 
control and the appropriate ATI Multimedia Center software to use it. We down-
loaded the updated version of the ATI Multimedia Center software, which 
instructed us to uninstall previous versions of the software before upgrading. 
Unfortunately, the updated version does not support the ATI Remote Wonder, so 
the remote control no longer worked after we upgraded the software. After some 
research and experimentation, we found that we could install the updates without 
uninstalling previous versions, and the remote control still worked. This meant 
uninstalling all the updates, reinstalling the original version, and then reinstalling 
all of the updates. However, it was worth the effort, as the ATI Remote Wonder is a 
great remote control that makes the HTPC easy and convenient to use, and it is 
preconfigured to work with all of the ATI Multimedia Center software. 
The first HTPC system that we built for this project uses the ATI software for 
most multimedia features. Overall, we really like the ATI AU-In-Wonder Radeon 
7500 and the software bundle with which it came because the applications are 
high quality, full-featured, well integrated, and easy to set up and configure. We 
had some issues with the software for the remote control, but once we figured it 
out, we really liked using it. Compared to installing separate applications for DVD 
playback, television tuner features, file playback, and a remote control, the ATI 
package is an easier and less expensive choice. 
Besides the ATI software, there is not much HTPC-specific software added 
to our first system. The video output is controlled by PowerStrip, which was 
challenging to learn and configure. (For more information about PowerStrip, 
see Chapter 10.) The operating system is Windows XP, so it came with the latest 
version of the Windows Media Player and an image viewer that allows the user 
to move from image to image like a slide show. The video capture and editing 
software uses the ATI video card hardware to import and digitize video, and we 
installed a CD-R drive and the CD burning software that it came with to make 
video and data discs. It is a testament to the ATI software bundle that few other 
HTPC applications are needed to run the machine as the heart of our home 
theater. 
HTPC System 2 
This system uses the GeForce4 MX video card, which has MPEG-2 acceleration 
features that improve DVD playback, so we wanted to use DVD player software 
269 

Chapter 11 
270 
that was compatible with the video card hardware. DVD playback is not a primary 
requirement for this system, though, as we mainly wanted to use this machine as a 
video recorder and a general multimedia file player. We had some challenges 
finding, installing, and configuring all of the software to perform these functions. 
The TheaterTek DVD Player is widely regarded as one of the best software 
applications for DVD playback on PCs.lt uses the most recent Ravisent Direct-
Show filters and the video quality is excellent. The TheaterTek DVD Player works 
well with the GeForce4 MX card, allowing this Pentium III/ 450 MHz system to play 
DVD movies smoothly. Without the hardware support enabled, we found that this 
system was not fast enough to play DVD movies smoothly without jerking and 
pausing during action scenes. This player can also pass the digital audio stream 
to the coaxial digital audio output on the Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! sound 
card, which is connected to a digital audio receiver. Though DVD playback is 
merely a convenience of this system, it is as good as any stand-alone player 
connected through an S-video cable to the home theater display. 
This system includes the Hauppauge Wm1V-HD HD1V tuner card for receiving 
television broadcasts from an analog cable service and HD1Vfrom over-the-air 
broadcasts. The card comes with television tuning software and the Gemstar Guide 
Plus+ to view program listings for the coming week, which allows us to set up 
recording times far in advance. The Hauppauge software works well for viewing 
and recording television, and for capturing still images from frames in the video 
stream. 
We wanted to try out some personal video recorder software on this machine, 
and all of the various DVR programs worked well, including WinDVR 2 and Snap-
Stream Personal Video Station. Because the machine is underpowered by today's 
standards, we were unable to get adequate high-quality (DVD level) recordings 
with this HTPC system; however, the machine performed well when we turned 
down the desired quality level and screen size. This machine is also used to play 
MP3 and audio CDs in the home theater room, so we wanted to use the most 
recent version of Microsoft Windows Media Player. Since this machine is using 
Windows 98, the most recent version ofWindows Media Player available is version 
7.1, not the new version 8.0 that comes with Windows XP. Though version 7.1 is an 
improvement over the one that comes with Windows 98, it is evident that this 
version of the Windows operating system is not going to be current or supported 
for much longer. This hardware is pretty slow for Windows XP, so it may be neces-
sary to upgrade the hardware when Windows 98 is no longer capable of running 
the applications we want to use. 
Overall, this second HTPC system is a little sluggish and slow to respond. 
It takes an almost unbearably long time for some applications to start up, and 
compared to our first HTPC, it is downright slow. Though it performs satisfactorily 
when doing one thing such as displaying television or playing a movie, it is not 
peppy at changing tasks or doing multiple things at once. 

Results and Conclusions 
Conclusions 
To wrap up our discussion of the HTPC machines we built for this project, we 
want to answer three questions: 
â¢ Did we achieve our goal of getting better DVD playback? 
â¢ Is the HTPC system as convenient and full-featured as we thought? 
â¢ What features were most important and least important? 
Did We Achieve Our Goal of Getting Better 
DVD Playback? 
The answer to the first question is yes for the first HTPC system. This HTPC is 
connected via a VGA-to-component transcoder to an HDTV set, and the DVD 
playback is fantastic. The higher resolution and progressive-scan format of HDTV 
provides much better video picture quality than the stand-alone DVD player we 
used before. The sound quality is at least as good as the digital surround sound 
was with the stand-alone player. The DVD video is played smoothly and without 
jerking or other problems. 
The answer to the first question is no for the second HTPC system. Though 
the DVD playback is mostly fine and is at least equal to a stand -alone player, 
this machine is connected to a television set via an S-video cable, so it does not 
surpass the DVD movie quality of other players. With hardware acceleration, this 
machine is able to play DVDs smoothly, but some DVD players that we tried did 
not support the video hardware in this machine and did not perform well. We 
are satisfied with the DVD performance of this system, but it is not better than a 
stand-alone player, though the HTPC has many other features that make it a great 
choice to play DVDs. 
Is the HTPC System As Convenient and Full-Featured 
As We Thought? 
The answer to the second question for both HTPC systems is yes. These machines 
proved to be very versatile media machines. Both of our systems are connected to 
the Internet via broadband cable modems, so we have access to a wide variety of 
movie trailers, video clips, streaming media, and online services for entertain-
ment. The popularity of Internet radio is almost enough reason to put a PC in the 
271 

Chapter 11 
272 
home theater and is a great feature of any Internet -connected HTPC. The only 
consideration to make is how much disk space to build into the machine, because 
our collection of media files is growing much faster than we expected as we 
convert our audio CDs to MP3 and digitize our home movies. 
What Features Were Most Important 
and Least Important? 
The first system we built has ended up being used mostly for watching television 
and digitizing home movies, even though it is optimized for playing DVD movies 
at high resolution. The excellent ATI Multimedia Center software came in more 
useful than we expected, especially the remote control, which made the machine 
more useable to other members of the household. We also use the digital image 
viewing software built into Windows XP quite a lot, and we often use the Windows 
Media Player to provide background music or streaming audio from Internet radio 
stations. 
One important software utility on the first HTPC system is PowerStrip, which 
was crucial for controlling the output of the video card to make it compatible with 
the HDTV-ready television set in the home theater. Using PowerStrip to set up a 
resolution-in-a-resolution allows us to display television channels with no over-
scan, so that the whole video image is shown on the screen. 
Although DVD playback is an important part of the first HTPC system, it 
ended up being less important than the television tuner or media file playing soft-
ware. In a typical week, this machine plays one DVD movie, but many hours of 
television and music. Also, we didn't need the software utilities Girder and DScaler 
at all, since the ATI software came preconfigured for use with the ATI Remote 
Wonder, and the ATI television tuner automatically deinterlaced the NTSC video 
from television channels and the composite and S-video inputs. We also expected 
that playing computer games on the big screen in the home theater would be a 
popular use of the HTPC, but most games did not work at the nonstandard resolu-
tions based on the 540p video format, and the 480p format resulted in screen 
resolutions that were low quality. We will experiment more with high resolutions, 
but since these are interlaced, we don't know if many PC games will work properly 
or look very good. 
We found similar results with the second HTPC system we built for this 
project. Although we concentrated on making the DVD performance very smooth 
and reliable, the machine is mainly used to watch television and play media files. 
This machine lived for a short while in the home theater and then was trans-
planted to the den, where it serves as a great secondary media machine in the 
home office. For this reason, Internet access to e-mail and Web browsing are 
important features on our second HTPC system. 

Results and Conclusions 
We installed a wireless keyboard and mouse set on the second HTPC system, 
but this turned out to be unnecessary. Because this system is used in an office 
setting, it is easily accessible. We still use the wireless controllers, as they function 
as well as conventional devices, but they are barely far enough from the machine to 
require wireless connections. The digital audio output from this HTPC is no longer 
used, either, since it is connected to a small stereo system in the den through 
analog audio connections. Fortunately, the Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! sound 
card in this system features digital and analog audio outputs and did not cost a lot, 
so we don't feel that we wasted any money on the digital audio capabilities. This 
machine might move back into the home theater room someday if it gets an 
upgraded processor, so the digital audio output might be useful again after all! 
Summary 
The exercise of building an HTPC is more suited to the world of the computer 
hobbyist than the home theater consumer, as only a real enthusiast will have the 
time and determination to achieve the benefits of using such a machine. This does 
not mean that HTPC systems are too complicated or too time-consuming for the 
average user-it's just that building one takes more time and effort than buying a 
DVD player. Unlike a DVD player, however, an HTPC has a limitless number of 
uses and the potential for endless entertainment from constant upgrades and 
improvements. Though there are some frustrations and failings along the way, the 
road through the HTPC construction zone leads to a world of fantastic DVD play-
back quality and amazing multimedia versatility.

Online Resources 
AT THE TIME we wrote this book, only a handful of companies were producing 
home theater PCs for commercial consumption. We do, however, assume that 
this number will increase greatly in the coming months, so if you're interested in 
finding more information on HTPCs on the Internet, you can go to a search site 
such as Google (http: I lwww. google. com) and search on the term "HTPC." Still, we 
have a few HTPC sites that we'd like to mention here.

books for professionals by professionalsâ¢ 
Apressâ¢ 
About Apress 
Apress, located in Berkeley, CA, is a fast-growing, innovative publishing company devoted to 
meeting the needs of existing and potential programming professionals. Simply put, the 'W' 
in Apress stands for "The Author's Pressâ¢" and its books have "The Expert's Voiceâ¢ ~ 
Apress' unique approach to publishing grew out of conversations between its founders Gary 
Cornell and Dan Appleman, authors of numerous best -selling, highly regarded books for 
programming professionals. In 1998 they set out to create a publishing company that 
emphasized quality above all else. Gary and Dan's vision has resulted in the publication of 
over 50 titles by leading software professionals, all of which have The Expert's Voiceâ¢. 
Do You Have What It Takes 
to Write for Apress? 
Apress is rapidly expanding its publishing program. If you can write and refuse to 
compromise on the quality of your work, if you believe in doing more than rehashing existing 
documentation, and if you're looking for opportunities and rewards that go far beyond those 
offered by traditional publishing houses, we want to hear from you! 
Consider these innovations that we offer all of our authors: 
â¢ Top royalties with no hidden switch statements 
Authors typically only receive half of their normal royalty rate on foreign sales. In contrast, 
Apress' royalty rate remains the same for both foreign and domestic sales. 
â¢ A mechanism for authors to obtain equity In Apress 
Unlike the software industry, where stock options are essential to motivate and retain 
software professionals, the publishing industry has adhered to an outdated compensation 
model based on royalties alone. In the spirit of most software companies, Apress reserves a 
significant portion of its equity for authors. 
â¢ Serious treatment of the technical review process 
Each Apress book has a technical reviewing team whose remuneration depends in part on 
the success of the book since they too receive royalties. 
Moreover, through a partnership with Springer-Verlag, New York, Inc., one of the world's 
major publishing houses, Apress has significant venture capital behind it. Thus, we have the 
resources to produce the highest quality books and market them aggressively. 
If you fit the model of the Apress author who can write a book that gives the "professional 
what he or she needs to knowâ¢," then please contact one of our Editorial Directors, Dan 
Appleman (dan_appleman@apress.com), Gary Cornell (gary_cornell@apress.com), Jason 
Gilmore (jason_gilmore@apress.com), Simon Hayes ( simon_hayes@apress.com), Karen 
Watterson (karen_watterson@apress.com), or John Zukowski (john_zukowski@apress.com) 
for more information.
