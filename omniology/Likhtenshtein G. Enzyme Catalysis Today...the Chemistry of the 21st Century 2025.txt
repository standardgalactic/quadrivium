Preface 
If we imagine that natural enzymes were to cease their functioning for one moment, 
this would mean an immediate collapse of all life on earth. Indeed, due to unique 
catalytic properties of enzymes such as precise speciﬁcity, selectivity, high rate of 
chemical reaction, and regulatory capacity, modern enzymology “stretches its arms 
wide” to all areas of wildlife and plays an important role in biotechnology, medicine, 
physiology, and the daily life of a human being. Classical and modern physical 
chemistry, chemical kinetics, organic, inorganic, and quantum chemistries provide 
an arsenal of physical methods and establish a basis for the investigation of struc-
ture and action mechanism of enzymes. The enzymes’ outstanding properties are 
possible owning to the multifunctional active centers, by the unique structure of 
protein globules, possessing both rigidity and ﬂexibility and by the formation of 
catalytic ensembles. The rapid progress in knowledge of the structure and mecha-
nism of action of enzymes, on the one hand, makes it possible to control and practical 
use of enzymatic processes, and on the other hand opening the door to a new chem-
ical revolution through appropriate mimicry (naturally inspired design). Enzyme 
mimics can have the important advantages including tunable structures and catalytic 
efﬁciencies, stability in experimental conditions, lower cost, and simple synthetic 
manufacturing routes to their preparation. Modern synthetic chemistry presents an 
almost unlimited possibility of preparing model catalysts of various structures. 
This book is a viewpoint on a view of enzyme catalysis, and it mimics by a phys-
ical chemist with long-term experience in the investigation of structure and action 
mechanism of biological catalysts. This book is not intended to provide an exhaus-
tive survey of each topic but rather a discussion of their theoretical and experimental 
background, and recent developments. The literature of enzyme catalysis is so vast, 
and many scientists have made important contributions in the area that it is impos-
sible in the space allowed for this book to give a representative set of references. The 
author apologizes to those he has not been able to include. 
Chapter 1 of the book is a brief overview of the general information about the main 
classes of enzymes and its applications. Methods of analysis in enzyme processes are

Preface
described in Chap. 2. Methods of enzyme kinetics are the subject of Chap. 3. Chap-
ters 4–6 form the theoretical and experimental background for elementary mech-
anisms of enzyme reactions including radical (Chap. 5) and multielectron redox 
(Chap. 6) processes. In Chap. 7, a general survey is made on molecular dynamics of 
proteins and their functional activity. Chapter 8 reviews theoretical and experimental 
data on enthalpy–entropy relationships in enzyme reactions. Chapters 9–13 gather 
and analyze information on recent progress made in the areas of artiﬁcial and nanoen-
zymes (Chap. 9), artiﬁcial photosynthesis (Chap. 10), modeling nonhemin iron 
proteins and enzymes (Chap. 11), artiﬁcial hydroxylases and hydrolases (Chap. 12), 
and miscellaneous biomimetic processes (Chap. 13). 
The monograph is intended for scientists working on enzyme catalysis and adja-
cent areas such as chemical modeling of biological processes, homogeneous catal-
ysis, biomedical research, and biotechnology. The book can be used as a subsidiary 
manual for instructors, and graduate and undergraduate students of university 
biochemistry and chemistry departments.

Enzymatic Processes as a Basis 
for the Creation of Advanced Chemical 
Catalysts 
Abstract This chapter is a brief overview of the general information about the 
main classes of enzymes and its applications. The key enzymatic systems involved 
in the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, the formation of energy-
rich molecules, carbon dioxide, and atmospheric nitrogen ﬁxation, the synthesis 
and degradation of amino acids, lipids, proteins, nucleotides, and nucleic acids. 
Enzymes provide vital chemical reactions like oxidative phosphorylation, Krebs 
cycle, Glycolysis Calvin-Benson cycle. Several paragraphs are devoted to miscel-
laneous enzymes including cytochromes P450, methane monooxygenases, hydro-
lases, kinases, and phosphatases. Enzymes play a vital role for all living things and 
control all normal and pathological processes. Enzymes in healthcare and medicine 
are used for treating disorders, assisting metabolism, medical device cleaning, the 
manufacture of medicines, regulation of digestion, detection of diseases, addressing 
food quality, treating heart, brain, lung, digestive tract, and mental diseases. Separate 
sections refer to the crucial role of enzymes in cancer and in COVID-19. Enzymes are 
widely used in such practically important areas as pharmaceutical industries, yogurt, 
beer and cheese production, apple wine fermentation, baking, brewing, production 
of cakes, preparation of digestive aids, fruit juices, and starch syrups and addition 
to the dough of bread, biodiesel production, enzymatic degumming, textile and 
paper industry, textile desizing, laundry detergents, the enzyme-mediated ceramic 
synthesis, skincare and cosmetics industry, the enzyme-mediated ceramic synthesis, 
the enzymatic decomposition of organic matter in soil. Thus, modern enzymology 
represents an inexhaustible source of knowledge and ideas for modern chemistry to 
initiate and bring about the real industrial revolution of the twenty-ﬁrst century. 
1.1 
Introduction 
Almost all key chemical and physical processes in wildlife (human and animal 
bodies, reptiles, plants, algae, and microorganisms) are controlled by enzymes [1– 
28]. The effective, close to ideal, course of these processes under ambient conditions

is provided by such unique properties of enzymes as high speed, selectivity, selec-
tivity, and ability to be regulated. Thus, enzymatic catalysis is at the center of interest 
of biochemists, biophysicists, molecular biologists, and biomedical scientists. From 
the point of view of the strategy for the development of basic and applied chemistry, 
the creation of model catalysts based on knowledge of the structure and mechanism 
of action of enzymes can lead to a new chemical revolution in the industry and 
contribute positively to everyday human life. 
This section brieﬂy describes the key enzymatic systems involved in the conver-
sion of solar energy into chemical energy, the formation of energy-rich molecules, 
carbon atmospheric nitrogen ﬁxation, the synthesis of amino acids, lipids, proteins, 
nucleotides, and nucleic acids. Currently, more than 4000 enzymes have been isolated 
and characterized. According to Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee 
of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on the Nomen-
clature and Classiﬁcation of Enzymes by the Reactions they Catalyse (https://iubmb. 
qmul.ac.uk/enzyme/World Wide Web version prepared by 
G.P. Moss), a list of 
the enzymes is: (1) Oxidoreductases catalyze the transfer of electrons from elec-
tron donor to the electron acceptor; (2) transferases catalyze the transfer of speciﬁc 
functional groups from donor to another molecule; (3) hydrolases catalyze the 
cleavage of a covalent bond using water; (4) lyases are the enzymes responsible for 
catalyzing addition and elimination reactions, breaking the bond between a carbon 
atom and another atom such as oxygen, sulfur, or another carbon atom; (5) isomerases 
convert one isomer to another, meaning that the end product has the same molec-
ular formula; (6) ligases catalyze the joining (ligation) of two large molecules by 
forming a new chemical bond; and (7) translocases are enzymes that assists in moving 
another molecule, catalyzing for example the movement of ions or molecules across 
membranes or their separation within membranes. 
The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzymes 
convert the substrates into different molecules known as products. In enzymology, 
turnover number is deﬁned as the number of substrate molecules transformed per 
minute by a single enzyme molecule when the enzyme is the rate-limiting factor 
[27]. 
A substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme to produce an enzyme-substrate 
complex ES and is transformed into an enzyme-product complex EP and from there 
to product P, via a transition state ES*:

The Michaelis–Menten equation [27–30] describes how the (initial) reaction 
rate v0 depends on the enzyme concentration [E], the position of the substrate-
binding equilibrium, and the rate constant k2 (Fig. 1.1). If the enzyme concentration 
is much less than the substrate concentration—the rate of product formation is given

Enzymes can have ratios of k2/Km near 108 to 109 M−1s−1 that is close to the 
maximum allowed by the rate of diffusion. Most enzymes have speciﬁcity constants 
from 109 to 100s (see Fig.  1.2 and Table 1.1) [31].

Enzymes in the Processes of Solar Energy Conversion 
and Stored Energy Through the Formation 
of Energy-Rich Molecules 
1.2.1 
Solar Energy Conversion in Chemical Energy 
In plant photosynthesis, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules are 
converted by light energy captured by chlorophyll into a sugar molecule and six 
oxygen molecules [33–38]: 
6 CO Subscri pt 2 Basel ine plus 6 upper H Subscript 2 Baseline upper O right arrow upper C Subscript 6 Baseline upper H Subscript 12 Baseline upper O Subscript 6 Baseline plus 6 upper O Subscript 2 Baseline period
This process is carried out with the help of Photosystem I and Photosystem II and 
Calvin cycle. In the Photosystem I and Photosystem II systems, light energy is used 
to convert the initial stable molecules into energy-rich molecules, which are further 
used in a series of reactions leading to the conversion of CO2 into glucose (Calvin 
cycle). The net effect of these steps is to convert light energy into chemical energy 
in the form of ATP and nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). 
The Photosystem I (PSI, or plastocyanin–ferredoxin oxidoreductase) absorbs light 
energy creating photoseparated charges (strong electron donor D− and strong elec-
tron acceptor (A+)). The latter receives electrons from plastocyanin or cytochrome 
c6, while D− drives the synthesis of NADPH. Within Photosystem II (water-
plastoquinone oxidoreductase), enzymes capture photons of light with formation 
photoseparated donor–acceptor pair. Then electron from the photoreduced donor is 
transferred through a variety of coenzymes and cofactors to reduce plastoquinone to 
plastoquinol. The light-driven photosynthetic electron transport from water in Mn 
cluster to the secondary quinone electron acceptor (Q) results in water oxidation 
most likely by the Mn cluster by one-step four-electron mechanism. 
The Calvin-Benson cycle [39–41] (Fig. 1.3), in which carbon of CO2 is reduced 
and involves the formation of intermediate sugar phosphates in a cyclic sequence. 
The overall reaction can be represented as follows:

The cycle incorporates three molecules of carbon dioxide and produces one 
molecule of the three-carbon glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Gal3P), sugar phos-
phates, amino acids, sucrose, and carboxylic acids. 
Calvin cycle is operated by 11 different enzymes that catalyze 13 reactions 
(Fig. 1.3). The regulatory enzymes are RuBisCO, FBPase, TKL, and PRK. 
The process runs in the following steps: (1) RuBisCO catalyzes the carboxyla-
tion of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP); (2) FBPase changes the fructose-1,6-
bisphosphate into fructose 6-phosphate, the enzyme catalyzes the reverse reac-
tion by phosphofructokinase; (3) PRK catalyzes the ATP dependent phosphoryla-
tion of ribulose-5-phosphate (RuP) into RuBP; (4) TKL catalyzes the reverse reaction, 
the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, d-ribose-5-
phosphate (aldose) and d-xylulose-5-P (ketose); (5) in the key reactions of the Calvin 
cycle, carbon from CO2 is added to a ﬁve-carbon molecule Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 
(RuBP) using the enzyme, RuBP oxygenase-carboxylase(rubisco). These reactions 
use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were produced in the light and other 
reactions. The ﬁnal product of the Calvin cycle is glucose [29].

Molecules 
1.2.2.1
Oxidative Phosphorylation 
Oxidative phosphorylation [42–48] refers to the metabolic pathway in which the 
energy released by nutrients during oxidation is utilized to generate ATP through 
electrical transport chain (Fig. 1.4). The ATP synthesis is coupled to the movement 
of electrons through the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the associated 
consumption of oxygen. The chain of redox reactions driving the ﬂow of electrons 
through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to elec-
tron acceptors such as oxygen and hydrogen (protons), is an exergonic process, 
whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process. Within proteins, electrons 
are transferred between ﬂavin cofactors, iron–sulfur clusters, and cytochromes. 
In Fig. 1.4, Complex I, NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase, catalyzes the two-
electron oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q10 or ubiquinone:
Fig. 1.4 Electron transport chain in the cell is the site of oxidative phosphorylation. The NADH 
and succinate generated in the citrm/How-is-the-Caic acid cycle are oxidized, releasing the energy 
of O2 to power the ATP synthase. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_phosphorylation

Complex II, Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, consists of four protein subunits and 
contains a bound ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor and iron–sulfur clus-
ters and participates in electron transfer to coenzyme Q (Succinate + Q  Fumarate 
+ Q2). Electron transfer ﬂavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, ETF-Q oxidore-
ductase (Complex III), containing a ﬂavin and a [4Fe–4S] cluster accepts electrons 
from electron-transferring ﬂavoprotein in the mitochondrial matrix, and uses these 
electrons to reduce ubiquinone:

ATP synthase, complex V, is the ﬁnal enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation 
pathway. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane 
to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi). A number of protons 
required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four: 
ADP plus Pi plus 4 upper H Superscript plus Baseline left parenthesis intermembrane right parenthesis right arrow ATP plus upper H Subscript 2 Baseline upper O Pi plus 4 upper H Superscript plus Baseline left parenthesis matrix right parenthesis 
This phosphorylation reaction is an equilibrium, which can be shifted by altering 
the proton-motive force. ATP synthase consists of two regions FO and F1 which 
create a pathway for protons movement across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 
FO causes rotation of F1. F1 has a water-soluble part that can hydrolyze ATP while 
FO has mainly hydrophobic regions. 
1.2.2.2
Krebs Cycle and Glycolysis 
The citric acid cycle (CAC), TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle), or the Krebs cycle 
(Fig. 1.5) [49–55] are a series of chemical reactions to release stored energy through 
the oxidation of acetylCoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the help 
of corresponding enzymes. Sequence of these reactions provides energy for storage 
in NADH, Guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP), and ubiquinone Q2.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle#/media/File:Citric_acid_cycle_w 
ith_aconitate_2.svg) 
Glycolysis is a cytoplasmic pathway which breaks down glucose into two three-
carbon compounds and generates the high-energy molecules NADH and ATP. The 
ﬁnal product of glycolysis is pyruvate in aerobic settings and lactate in anaerobic 
conditions. The overall process of glycolysis is: 
Glucose plu s 2 NAD S uper scr ipt  plu s Baselin e pl us 2 ADP plus 2 u pper P Subscript 1 Baseline right arrow 2 pyruvate plus 2 NADH plus 2 upper H Superscript plus Baseline plus 2 ATP
The three key enzymes of glycolysis are hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and 
pyruvate kinase. The ﬁrst step is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzymes

called hexokinases to form glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction consumes 
ATP. The second stage involves breaking down the glucose into two three-carbon 
molecules and the third stage involves harvesting the energy in the chemical bonds 
of glucose to form a few ATP molecules as well as pyruvate and NADH molecules.

Enzymes in Metabolism 
Metabolism is the chemical reactions in the body’s cells that change food into energy 
using a cascade of enzymes (Fig. 1.6). Metabolism includes catabolism (breakdown 
of molecules to obtain energy) and anabolism (synthesis of compounds needed by 
the cells). The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of the energy in 
food to energy available to run cellular processes, the conversion of food to building 
blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates; and the elimination 
of metabolic wastes.

1.3.1 
Synthesis of Small Molecules 
In amino acids enzymatic synthesis, the enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase and 
glutamine synthetase convert ammonia to glutamate and glutamine, the universal 
donor of amine groups [56–67]. Amino group from glutamine then can be trans-
ferred to other carbon backbones by transamination reactions to make amino acids 
such as alanine and aspartate, asparagine. Similarly, asparagine and glutamine are 
synthesized from aspartate and glutamate, respectively, by an amidation reaction 
step. The process of enzymatic transamination was discovered in the mid-1930s by 
A.E. Braunstein and associates [58]. Over the next 50 years, they and other authors 
made important discoveries in the ﬁeld of aminotransferases and other pyridoxal 
5’-phosphate enzymes. 
Fatty acid synthesis is the creation of fatty acids from acetylCoA and NADPH 
through the action of fatty acid synthases. The acetylCoA 
is derived from carbohydrates via the glycolytic pathway. For example, straight-
chain fatty acid synthesis of the 16-carbon palmitic acid occurs via the six recur-
ring reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthase II (FASII), which contain multiple 
enzymes: (1) The conserved acyl carrier protein (ACP) acts as the mobile domain 
responsible for shuttling the intermediate fatty acid substrates to various catalytic 
sites; (2) following each round of elongation the beta keto group is reduced to the

fully saturated carbon chain by the sequential action of a ketoreductase (KR), dehy-
dratase (DH), and enoyl reductase (ER); and (3) the process is completed by the 
action of a thioesterase (TE) upon reaching a carbon chain length. 
Phospholipids are a class of lipids whose molecule has a hydrophilic part 
containing a phosphate group and two hydrophobic fragments derived from fatty 
acids, joined by an alcohol residue of a glycerol molecule (Fig. 1.7) [68–72]. 
Phospholipid biosynthesis is linked to glycolysis through the use of dihydroxy-
acetone phosphate (DHAP), formed from sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro-3-P) via 
its reduction by NADH, catalyzed glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .Various 
phospholipid synthesis and allocation occur by glycerol 3-phosphate acyltrans-
ferase (GPAT), acylglycerol-3-acyltransferase (AGPAT), phosphatidic acid phos-
phatase (PAP) cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol synthase (CDS), lysophospha-
tidic acid acyltransferases (LPAAT), phosphatase and choline phosphotransferase, 
and ﬂoppase. 
Nucleotide units are made up of a nitrogenous base (cytosine, guanine, adenine, or 
thymine), pentose sugar (deoxyribose), and phosphate group [73–80]. Nucleotides 
consist of three chemical components, one of the ﬁve bases, a ribose moiety in 
RNA and a deoxyribose in DNA, and one to three phosphate groups linked together 
and to the ribose. There are two routes for nucleotide biosynthesis in living cells, 
the de novo and salvage pathways. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase catalyzes the 
ﬁrst step in pyrimidine de novo synthesis. The second enzyme in pyrimidine de novo 
synthesis is aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) [74]. ATCase catalyzes the 
committed step in the de novo synthesis of uridine-5’-monophosphate (UMP), from 
which all other pyrimidine nucleotides are made. Nucleotide salvage pathways are 
used to recover bases and nucleosides that are formed during degradation of RNA and 
DNA. For example, uridine triphosphate can be synthesized in following reactions: 
(1) Uridine phosphorylase or pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase substitutes the 
anomeric-carbon-bonded phosphate of ribose 1-phosphate for the free base uracil, 
forming the nucleoside uridine, (2) Uridine kinase phosphorylates the 5’-carbon of 
this nucleoside into uridine monophosphate (UMP), and (3) UMP/CMP kinase phos-
phorylates UMP into uridine diphosphate, which can be phosphorylated into uridine 
triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The salvage synthesis of nucleotides

Synthesis of Biological Polymers 
Cellulose is a polysaccharide composed of linear glucan chains that are linked 
together by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds with cellobiose residues. The repeating unit at 
degree of polymerization ranged from several hundreds to over ten thousands [82, 
83]. The individual glucose units are connected via glycosidic bonds between their C1 
and C4 positions, and the anomeric C1 carbon adopts the β-conﬁguration. Cellulose 
is produced by membrane-integrated cellulose synthase (CeS) complexes, containing 
at least 18 catalytic CESA protein subunits, which synthesize a linear β-1,4-glucan 
from cytosolic UDP-activated glucose (UDP-Glc, the donor sugar). UDP-glucose 
pyrophosphorylase (UGP) is the enzyme capable of activating glucose-1-phosphate 
(Glc-1-P) to UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc). 
In both plants and bacteria, UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) is the key intermediate in 
cellulose synthesis. The cellulose synthase complex uses the glucose moiety from 
UDP-Glc transports the glucose across the cell membrane or cell wall and adds 
the monomer to the nascent extracellular cellulose chain (Fig. 1.8). UDP-glucose is 
used in nucleotide sugar metabolism as an activated form of glucose, a substrate for 
enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP).
Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of amylose (a linear 
alpha(1–4)-glucan) and amylopectin (an alpha(1–4)-glucan with alpha(1–6)-branch 
points) in which numerous glucose units are joined by glycosidic bonds [84– 
88, 83–86]. Starch biosynthesis requires coordinated activities among multiple

enzymes, including adenosine diphosphoglucose (ADP)-glucose pyrophosphory-
lase (AGPase), starch synthase (SS), starch branching enzyme (SBE) and starch de-
branching enzyme (DBE). Glucans and amylopectins) are synthesized via the ADP-
glucose pathway by three key enzymes: ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, starch 
synthases, and starch branching enzymes. 
DNA synthesis is the creation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) macromolecules, 
made up of nucleotide units. Nucleotide units are in turn made up of a nitroge-
nous base (cytosine, guanine, adenine, or thymine), pentose sugar (deoxyribose) 
and phosphate group. Speciﬁc base pairing (adenine A and thymine T, guanine G 
and cytosine C) occurs when hydrogen bonds form between the nucleotide bases. 
Two sugar-phosphate chains are paired through hydrogen bonds between A and T 
and between G and C, thus forming the twin-stranded double helix of the DNA 
molecule. 
DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of 
DNA from one original DNA molecule (Fig. 1.9) [87–91]. The process occurs in 
four major steps: formation (“unzipping” into two single strands), primer binding 
(the leading strand is the simplest to replicate), elongation, and termination. DNA 
replication ends when converging replication forks meet. All in all, these enzymes 
working in groups create two identical DNA duplexes from a single original DNA 
duplex. During DNA replication, primer, which is short strands of RNA, is required 
for DNA synthesis to initiate polynucleotide synthesis [88–91]. Primases are special 
RNA polymerases that synthesize short-lived oligonucleotides. The following key 
enzymes are involved in the DNA replication [88]: (1) DNA polymerase, the enzyme 
responsible for catalyzing the addition of nucleotide substrates to DNA in the 5′ to 
3′ direction during the reaction deoxynucleoside triphosphate (DNAn ⇌pyrophos-
phate + DNAn+1); (2) topoisomerase relaxes the DNA from its supercoiled nature; 
(3) helicase separates the two strands of DNA at the replication fork behind the 
topoisomerase; and (4) DNA ligase re-anneals the semiconservative strands and

joins Okazaki fragments of the lagging strand. Okazaki fragments are the short 
lengths of DNA that are produced by the discontinuous replication of the lagging 
strand. Thus, at the replication fork, many replication enzymes assemble on the DNA 
into a complex molecular machine called the replisome (Fig. 1.9). 
Protein synthesis proceeds into two phases—transcription and translation 
(Fig. 1.10). Synthesis of RNA (transcription) is catalyzed by an enzyme—RNA 
polymerase—using DNA as a template (Fig. 1.10). Steps of the protein synthesis are: 
(1) Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a promoter 
(the promotor is a sequence of DNA to which proteins bind to initiate transcrip-
tion of a single RNA transcript); (2) the DNA double helix is unwound by the heli-
case activity of the enzyme; and (3) the enzyme then synthesizes a complementary 
RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The single-stranded 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) product synthesized by transcription of DNA, processes to 
yield messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs), transfer RNA (tRNAs), and ribosomal 
RNA (rRNAs) and can be modiﬁed by enzymes after transcription. There are also 
a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their template for 
synthesis of a new strand of RNA.
Transfer RNA (tRNA), composed, typically from 76 to 90 nucleotides in length 
carries an amino acid to the protein synthesizing machinery of a cell called the ribo-
some (Fig. 1.11). [96, 97]. Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small and 
large ribosomal subunits which in turn consists of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules 
and ribosomal proteins. Using the mRNA as a template, the ribosome traverses each 
codon (3 nucleotides) of the mRNA, pairing it with the appropriate amino acid 
provided by an aminoacyl-tRNA. Aminoacyl-tRNA contains a complementary anti-
codon on one end and the appropriate amino acid on the other. Complementation of 
a 3-nucleotide codon in a messenger RNA (mRNA) by a 3-nucleotide anticodon of 
the tRNA results in protein synthesis based on the mRNA code.

Translation proceeds in several steps: [96, 97]: (Fig. 1.10) (1) The ribosome 
assembles around the target mRNA; (2) the ﬁrst tRNA is attached at the start codon; 
(3) the last tRNA is accommodated the small ribosomal subunit (accommodation) 
transfers the amino acid; (3) it carries to the large ribosomal subunit which binds 
it to the one of the preceding admitted tRNA (transpeptidation); (4) the ribosome 
creates an amino acid chain by moving to the next mRNA codon; (translocation); 
(5) when a stop codon is reached, the ribosome releases the polypeptide; and (6) the 
remained intact ribosomal complex moves on to the next mRNA to be translated. 
Crystal structures of the ribosome have shown that the peptidyl-transferase activity 
is catalyzed by the 28-S RNA in the major subunit of rRNA [98]. For recognition 
of the appropriate tRNA, the ribosome utilizes large conformational changes and the 
polypeptide later folds into an active protein 
1.3.3 
Degradation of Biological Macro Molecules 
Degradation of biological molecules protein includes the following catabolic reac-
tions: protein→ amino acid → AcetylCoA, polysaccharides → monosaccharides 
→ AcetylCoA, fats → fatty acid → AcetylCoA. In turn, AcetylCoA [100].is 
involved in citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Lipolysis is the metabolic 
pathway through which lipid triglycerides are hydrolyzed into a glycerol and 
three fatty acids by lipases [100, 102–[104]. The six separate steps of hydrolysis 
involved in the lipolysis process: (1) triacylglycerol is hydrolyzed to make diacylglyc-
erol; (2) this is catalyzed by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL); (3) diacylglycerol 
is hydrolyzed to make monoacylglycerol; (4) this is catalyzed by hormone-sensitive 
lipase (HSL); (5) monoacylglycerol is hydrolyzed to make glycerol; and (6) this is 
catalyzed by monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). 
Mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids proceeds several steps, to produce 
three energy storage molecules per round of oxidation, including one NADH, one 
FAD(H2), and one acetylCoA molecule [105, 106]The steps are: (1) acyl CoA 
dehydrogenase involves in the handling of fatty acids; (2) enoyl CoA hydratase 
performs a hydration step of the double bond between the alpha and beta carbons; 
(3) beta-hydroxyl acyl CoA dehydrogenase enzyme catalyzed the chemical reaction

and (4) the process’s ﬁnal step involves cleavage of the bond between the alpha and 
beta carbon by CoASH (Коэнзим A) 
Proteases or peptidase are enzymes that catalyze proteolysis, breaking down 
proteins into smaller polypeptides and eventually into amino acids by hydrolysis 
[108–110], 108–111]. Based on the chemical nature of group, attacking a substrate 
in the enzyme active site and mechanism of catalysis, proteases are classiﬁed into six

16
1
Enzymatic Processes as a Basis for the Creation of Advanced Chemical …
distinct classes, namely, aspartic, glutamic, metalloproteases, cysteine, serine, and 
threonine proteases. The ﬁrst three classes utilize an activated water molecule as a 
nucleophile to attack the peptide bond of the substrate, whereas in other enzymes, the 
nucleophile is an amino acid residue (Cys, Ser, or Thr, respectively). A metallopro-
teinase, or metalloprotease, is protease enzyme whose catalytic mechanism involves 
a metal (zinc, cobalt). The ligands coordinating the metal ion can vary with histi-
dine, glutamate, aspartate, lysine, and arginine. The fourth coordination position is 
taken up by an activated labile water molecule. 
Amylase enzymes (salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase) catalyze the break-
down of starch, which is a mixture of amylose and amylopectin polysaccharide 
polymers, into sugars. α-Amylase acts randomly along the starch chain hydrolyzing 
the α-(1→4) glycosidic bonds to produce a combination of maltotriose, maltose, 
and limit dextrins. β-Amylase breaks down starch into the disaccharide maltose. 
Oligosaccharidases catalyze the disaccharide hydrolyzing. Cellulases break down the 
cellulose molecule into monosaccharides such as beta-glucose, or shorter polysaccha-
rides and oligosaccharides [111–114, 112–114]. Cellulases cleave the β-1,4-glucan 
bonds in cellulose, belonging to the glycoside hydrolases family of enzymes which 
catalyzes cleave glycosidic linkages in carbohydrates. The three types of reaction 
catalyzed by cellulases are: (1) Breakage of the noncovalent interactions present in 
the amorphous structure of cellulose (endocellulase); (2) Hydrolysis of chain ends 
to break the polymer into smaller sugars (exocellulase); and (3) Hydrolysis of disac-
charides and tetrasaccharides into glucose (beta-glucosidase). Five general types of 
cellulases based on the type of reaction catalyzed are: (1) Endocellulases randomly 
cleave internal bonds at amorphous sites that create new chain ends; (2) exocellu-
lases or cellobiohydrolases cleave two to four units from the ends of the exposed 
chains produced by endocellulase, resulting in tetrasaccharides [or disaccharides, 
such as cellobiose; (3) cellobiases or beta-glucosidases hydrolyze the exocellu-
lase product into individual monosaccharides; (4) oxidative cellulases depolymerize 
cellulose by radical reactions; and (5) cellulose phosphorylases depolymerize cellu-
lose using phosphates instead of water. Three types of cellulases are secreted by fungi 
that are endo-β-1, 4-glucanases, cellobiohydrolase, and cellobioses or β-glucosidases 
1.4 
Miscellaneous Enzymes 
Hydroxylases are enzymes which hydroxylate organic compounds. In mammals, 
these enzymes oxidize steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics[115–117]. The action of 
these systems on compounds having unsaturated bonds may result in their epoxida-
tion or demethylation with methylamines. These enzymes are involved in a number 
of vital processes including the biosynthesis of steroids, degradation of xenobi-
otics, drug metabolism, and carcinogenesis. For example, phenylalanine hydrox-
ylase (PAH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the aromatic side chain 
of phenylalanine to generate tyrosine. PAH belongs to a class of monooxygenase that 
uses tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, a pteridine cofactor) and a nonheme iron for catalysis.

1.4 Miscellaneous Enzymes

Cytochromes P450 containing protoheme IX, powerful enzyme hydroxylation 
systems of organic substrates, i.e., steroids, hydrocarbons, organic acids, alcohols, 
and amines, are operatives in animal and plant tissues and bacteria [117–126]. The 
most common reaction catalyzed by cytochromes P450, containing protocheme IX 
is a monooxygenase reaction, e.g., insertion of one atom of oxygen into the aliphatic 
position of an organic substrate (RH), while the other oxygen atom is reducedto 
water: 
RH plus upper O Subscript 2 Baseline plus NADPH plus upper H Superscript plus normal infinity Baseline right arrow ROH plus upper H Subscript 2 Baseline upper O plus NADP Superscript plus 
The reduction of the enzyme can involve ﬂavin reductases and electron carriers, 
such as adrenodoxin, rubredoxin, and cytochrome b5. Dioxygen, being a weak one-
electron oxidant, is activated after the two-electron reduction in the enzyme heme 
coordination sphere. Ferryl rebound mechanisms suggest the formation of the ferryl-
oxene(Por·FeIV-O) [126, 127]. This mechanism proposed by Groves and McClusky 
involves initial hydrogen abstraction from the alkane by (Por·FeIV-O) followed by 
the alkyl radical rebound on the ferryl-hydroxo intermediate with formation alcohol. 
Current evidences strongly support Fe(IV)=O as the hydroxylating intermediate. 
Nitrogen ﬁxation is a chemical process by which molecular nitrogen, with a strong 
triple covalent bond, is converted into ammonia. Biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) 
occurs when atmospheric nitrogen is reduced to ammonia by a nitrogenase enzyme 
[14, 128–135, 138, 139]. The overall reaction for BNF is:

Nitrogenase consists of two proteins, a catalytic MoFe protein having of two clus-
ters: [Fe4S3] and [MoFe3S3], which are linked by three sulﬁde ions and a reducing 
iron-only protein carrying two [Fe4S3] cubes (P-clusters) linked by a central carbon 
atom. The mechanism proceeds via a series of protonation and reduction steps 
wherein the FeMoco active site hydrogenates the N2 substrate. The function of the Fe 
protein, the dinitrogenase reductase, is to transfer electrons from a reducing agent, 
such as ferredoxin or ﬂavodoxin to the MoFe protein nitrogenase protein. The elec-
tron transfer is coupled with the reaction of ATP hydrolysis the chemical energy 
of which is used to increase the reduction potential of the P cluster. The Lowe– 
Thorneley kinetic model suggests the eight correlated proton and electron transfers 
required throughout the reaction [14] and references therein. At the key stage of 
the nitrogenase process, after the accumulation of four reducing equivalents, the 
reduction of the complex N2 in cluster [MoFe3S3], leads to the formation of an inter-
mediate hydrazine derivative by one-step four-electronic mechanism (four-electron 
mechanism) [14, 133–135]. The transfer of electrons requires an input of chemical 
energy which comes from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP 
also causes a conformational change within the nitrogenase complex, bringing the 
Fe protein and MoFe protein closer together for easier electron transfer. 
Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) are the enzymes that catalyze the oxidation 
of methane via incorporation of one hydroxyl group into substrate:

The enzyme can also cooxidize a wide range of hydrocarbons and chlori-
nated hydrocarbons. Methane monooxygenase belongs to the class of oxidoreduc-
tase enzymes, nonheme diiron enzymes [130–132]. The reaction is shown to occur 
via a bound-radical mechanism. There are two forms of MMO: the well-studied 
soluble form (sMMO) and the particulate form (pMMO). The active site in sMMO 
contains a diiron center bridged by an oxygen atom (Fe-O-Fe), whereas the active 
site in pMMO utilizes copper. Structures of both proteins have been determined by 
X-ray crystallography [132]. 
A kinase is an enzyme that attaches a phosphate group to a protein, while a phos-
phatase is an enzyme that removes a phosphate group from a protein [130, 132−146]. 
A protein kinase catalysis is the transfer of phosphate from ATP (or GTP) to its protein 
substrates. All kinases require a Mg2+–nucleotide complex as one of the enzyme 
substrates. Speciﬁcally, the enzymes catalyze phosphoryl transfer from MgATP to 
Ser/Thr and Tyr side chains in proteins. Currently, the following types of kinases 
have been identiﬁed and are being intensively studied: сyclin-dependent kinases, 
mitogen-activated protein kinases phosphatidylinositol kinases, sphingosine kinases, 
riboﬂavin kinase and thymidine kinase. A coordination between highly conserved 
protein kinases and the family of phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP) establishes the 
phosphorylation state of proteins, which controls their function. Recent studies have 
shown that protein phosphatases are speciﬁc and selective enzymes and that their 
activity can be tightly regulated. Protein kinases and protein phosphatases regulate 
each other during mitosis (Fig. 1.12) [141]. Inhibition of enzyme PP2A/B55 as well 
as other members of the PPP family is directly or indirectly controlled by Cdk1/ 
cyclin B.
Kinetically, kinases can be classiﬁed into two general types, those that follow 
ternary complex mechanisms and those that follow ping-pong mechanisms [132, 
143]. Ternary complex mechanisms typically involve direct reaction between the 
two substrates to afford the two products, whereas ping-pong mechanisms proceed 
through a covalent enzyme intermediate, which in the case of kinases would be a 
phosphoenzyme species. Mechanistic scheme of associative and dissociative transi-
tion states of phosphoryl transfer was described. Figure 1.13 illustrates the kinases 
role in signal transduction pathways.
Phosphatases have been classiﬁed into four major classes based on their substrate 
preference, inhibitor sensitivity, and catalytic mechanism [145–151]. These classes 
include phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP), Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent protein phos-
phatases (PPM), phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTP), and aspartate-based protein 
phosphatases. For example, cysteine-dependent phosphatases (CDPs) catalyze the 
hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond via a phospho-cysteine intermediate. Metallo-
phosphatases (PP2C) coordinate catalytically essential metal ions within their active 
site. The free cysteine nucleophile forms a bond with the phosphorus atom of the 
phosphate moiety, and the P-O bond links the phosphate group to the tyrosine [150]. 
In addition to the major serine/threonine-speciﬁc phosphoprotein phosphatase, Mg2+-
dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase, and protein tyrosine phosphatase families,

Fig. 1.12 Protein kinases and protein phosphatases regulate each other during mitosis. Protein 
kinases and protein phosphatases coordinate with each other through underlying dynamic phos-
phorylation changes within kinase/phosphatase catalytic or regulatory subunits. Cdk1/cyclin B, 
directly or indirectly, inhibits the phosphatase activity of PP1, PP2A-B55, and PP4. Conversely, 
PP1 suppresses the kinase activity of AURKB through its regulatory protein Sds22 (PPP1R7), Plk1 
through Mypt1 (PPP1R12A) and Gwl through PPP1R3B. Phosphorylation by Cdk1/cyclin B within 
or near the PP2A-B56 binding LxxIxE motif in substrates increases the afﬁnity of PP2A-B56 inter-
actions. PP2A-B55 activity is inhibited during mitosis by Gwl phosphorylation of the inhibitory 
proteins ENSA and ARPP-19. PP1 inactivates Gwl at mitotic exit, thereby activating PP2A-B55. 
PP6 is the T-loop phosphatase for AURKA, thereby decreasing its activity directly [130, 141].

Introduction 
Biotechnology is characterized as the exploitation of natural procedures for indus-
trial and varied purposes such as pharmaceuticals, bio-fuels, paper and pulp, food 
and brewing, agricultural industries, and others [152–204]. Enzymes are of great 
importance in the development of industrial bioprocesses. Many industrial processes, 
such as cheese manufacturing, have traditionally used impure enzyme sources often

from animals or plants. Much of modern industrial enzymology with the commer-
cial exploitation of microbial enzymes were developed in Table 1.2. Industrial 
enzymes have many applications such as detergent, food, animal feed, cosmetics, 
biofuel, medication, pharmaceuticals, and technical use. Thermophilic and hyper-
thermophilic enzymes represent a superior source for industrial applications owning 
their stability. The global market of enzymes is estimated in 2015 to be about 3.7 
billion USD with a 10% expansion. Commercially available microbial enzymes are 
about 200 out of almost 4000 enzymes known.
1.5.2 
Miscellaneous Applications of Enzymes 
Microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi have been used in food fermenta-
tion since ancient times and fermentation processes are still applied in the preparation 
of many of the food items [155–157]. Microbial enzymes are the preferred source to 
plants or animals due to several advantages such as easy, cost-effective, and consis-
tent production. Microbial cellulases ﬁnd applications in utilization of biomass for

Lipases serve important roles in human practices as yogurt and cheese fermen-
tation from ancient time. In more modern applications, lipases are being exploited 
as baking, laundry detergents, for the removal of size lubricants, manufacturing of 
sausage, modifying the food ﬂavor by synthesis of esters of short-chain fatty acids 
and alcohols, and for enhancing the aroma and speeding up the fermentation of apple 
wine [158–163]. The α-amylases have been used in baking, brewing, production of 
cakes, preparation of digestive aids, fruit juices, and starch syrups and addition to the 
dough of bread in order to degrade the starch into smaller dextrins [154–157]. Enzy-
matic biodiesel is becoming an increasingly popular topic in bioenergy literature. 
An innovative system for enzymatic biodiesel production involving a combination 
of a lipase and two phospholipases was developed. This allowed performing the 
enzymatic degumming and transesteriﬁcation in a single step, using crude soybean 
oil as feedstock, and converting part of the phospholipids into biodiesel. The appli-
cation of alkaline pectinases in the textile industry for the retting and degumming 
of ﬁber crops, production of good quality paper, fermentation of coffee and tea, and 
in bringing down the cloudiness and bitterness of fruit juices has been reported. 
Employment of lipases as biocatalysts in the transesteriﬁcation of triacylglycerides 
allows mild reaction conditions and easy recovery of glycerol [170]. 
Lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, belonging to glycoside hydrolases (GH), 
polysaccharide lyases (PL), carbohydrate esterases (CE), lignin oxidases (LO), 
and lignin-degrading auxiliary enzymes (LDA) families, are used as industrial 
biocatalysts for fuels and chemicals [165–166]. Pectinases break down complex

polysaccharides of plant tissues into simpler molecules like galacturonic acids [160, 
167]. 
Peroxidases are oxidoreductases produced by a number of microorganisms and 
plants and catalyze a variety of practical reactions in the presence of peroxides such 
as hydrogen peroxide [168] including (1) oxidative polymerization of phenols and 
aromatic amines, conducted by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in water and water-
miscible organic solvents; (2) soil detoxiﬁcation; while HRP, soybean, and turnip 
peroxidases have been applied; (3) bioremediation of waste waters by HRP, soybean 
and turnip peroxidases contaminated with phenols, cresols and chlorinated phenols; 
and (4) biopulping and biobleaching in the paper industry using lignin peroxidase 
(LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP). 
Fungal naringinase is used industrially in large amounts due to its activities 
to hydrolyze Naringenine-7-rhamnosidoglucoside which include the production of 
rhamnose 
and prunin 
and debittering of citrus fruit juices. 
Yeasts invertase converts sucrose to glucose and fructose, while zymase converts 
it ﬁnally to ethanol and CO2. The enzyme zymase was used as biocatalyst to 
improve ethanol production. Various operational and nutritional parameters were 
investigated and analyzed to determine the optimum ethanol production [171]. 
Proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, and mannanases are enzymes that are used 
as laundry detergent being the largest application of industrial enzymes [174–185].

comprised mainly of protein, such as grass, blood, egg, and others, giving clothes a 
clean appearance; (2) Amylases break down starch-based stains commonly caused 
by pasta, potatoes and baby food, which are commonly found on dishes; (3) lipases 
target fat-based stains such as butter, oil, and human sebum; (4) for cotton fabrics, 
cellulases improve overall cleanness by reducing redeposition of particulate soils 
such as soot, clay, and rust during the wash; cellulases also provide fabric and color 
care; (6) mannanases degrade stains containing mannans; and (7) pectate lyases act 
on pectin-based stains from fruits and vegetables, jams and other food containing 
thickeners. 
Untreated cotton ﬁbers can break easily when being woven into textures. Amylase 
enzymes are generally utilized in desizing (the process of removing the size material 
from warp yarns after a textile fabric is woven). The studies [175, 176] explored 
the potential of amylase for textile desizing extracted from indigenous environ-
mental Aspergillus tubingensis isolate. The sized cotton fabric was enzymatically 
desized, scoured (clean or brighten), and bleached with an enzyme mixture of 
starch-degrading enzymes, pectinases [176–178]. Glucose oxidases were added to 
generate hydrogen peroxide. In the one-step process for enzymatic desizing and 
bioscouring of cotton fabrics, a mixture of α-amylase (Am) and polygalacturonase 
(PG) enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum induced with orange peel was produced 
[179]. The enzymes used in the textile ﬁeld are amylases, catalase, and laccase 
which are employed to removing the starch, degrading excess hydrogen peroxide, 
bleaching textiles, and degrading lignin [183]. The cellulases are applied for denim 
(a sturdy cotton warp-faced textile) ﬁnishing, and lactases are used for decoloriza-
tion of textile efﬂuents and textile bleaching. The use of highly speciﬁc and efﬁcient 
enzymes, working under mild conditions, results in reduced process times, energy 
and water savings, improved product quality. Biopolishing is a ﬁnishing process that 
improves fabric quality by mainly reducing fuzziness and pilling property of cellu-
losic ﬁber, bringing the fabric a cleaner surface, a cooler feel, luster, and softer feel 
[184, 185]. The aims of the study [186] were to analyze the treatment conditions 
for the use of acid and neutral cellulase enzymes and evaluate the changes in the 
various properties of the treated fabrics. In this study, biopolishing was carried out 
on bleached fabric using acid cellulase (Mega PK) and neutral cellulase. On the basis 
of the observed results, it was suggested that Mega PK showed a better result when 
using 1% concentration at 55 °C for 40 min. On the other hand, a comparatively 
better result was found using 1% Mega L at 55 °C for 50 min. 
Currently industries such as textile and pulp and paper shift away from toxic, 
carcinogenic chemical bleaching processes to hydrogen peroxide-based bleaching 
because of its nontoxic and eco-friendly characteristics [180] For example, in an 
effort to replace these compounds, hydrogen peroxide was generated as a bleaching 
compound by means of enzymatic reactions [181] Three different pathways were 
investigated: (1) the H2O2 production from glucose; (2) the production of H2O2 from 
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) by the action of both cellulase, which promotes the 
hydrolysis of the polymeric chain, and glucose oxidase, which oxidizes the smaller 
fractions to produce H2O2; and (3) H2O2 was obtained from ethanol, which is present 
in liquid detergents, by the action of the enzyme alcohol oxidase. The carbohydrate

oxidase from Microdochium nivale (CAOX), heterologously expressed in Aspergillus 
oryzae, and cellobiose dehydrogenase from Myriococcum thermophilum (MtCDH), 
were assessed for their ability to generate bleaching species at a pH suitable for 
liquid detergents. Both enzymes were able to produce an amount of H2O2 sufﬁcient 
to decolorize the pure anthocyanins 
within 2 h and showed signiﬁcant cleaning beneﬁts on the stains [182]. 
Enzymes used in the skincare and cosmetics industry are: coenzyme Q10, super-
oxide dismutase (SOD), proteolytic enzymes, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, lysyl 
and prolyl hydroxylases, and peroxidase enzymes [190–192]. In research [189], 
SOD is combined with catalase in skin formulations to prevent wrinkles, liver spots, 
and ﬁne lines and also helps in scar tissue and keloid reduction and quicker healing 
of wounds. Pepsin, bromelain, and papain are work by breaking the skin proteins 
into peptides and then amino acids. Lysyl and prolyl hydroxylases when combined 
with vitamin C, increase skin collagen which ﬁrms the skin and prevents wrin-
kles and ﬁne lines. Peroxidase preserves the skin creams by preventing bacterial 
growth. Superoxide dismutase and peroxidase help to protect the skin by neutral-
izing dangerous substances that can be generated by sun exposure and pollution and 
reduce UV-induced erythema [187] 
Sole enzymes play a role in the decomposition of organic matter and their activi-
ties are related to decomposition, microbial activity, soil properties, and biomass. The 
soil enzymes include amylase, phosphatase, urease, cellulase, protease, glycosidase, 
phenol oxidase, peroxidase, and arylsulfatase [194, 195]. These enzymes can act in 
skincare and cosmetics industry. The effects of manure and tillage (the preparation 
of land for growing crops) practices on activities of enzymes that are key to biogeo-
chemical cycling such as β-glucosidase (C biogeochemical cycling), α-galactosidase 
(C cycling), β-glucosaminidase (C and N cycling) and phosphomonoesterases (P 
cycling) were evaluated [195] Results of the study indicated signiﬁcant responses 
in C and P cycling enzyme activities to manure applications. This ﬁnding suggested 
potential beneﬁts to soil biogeochemical cycling essential for the productivity of 
agroecosystems [195] 
Polylactic acid (PLA), a thermoplastic polyester with backbone formula,

is a promising biomass-derived polymer [192–194, 197–200]. PLA-based 
materials might be mixed with ﬂeece (the woolly covering of a sheep or 
goat) or cotton. Production of PLA homopolymer and its copolymer, poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate), P(3HB-co-LA), by direct fermentation of metabolically 
engineered Escherichia coli was reported [188, 189, 197, 198] Synthesis of PLA and 
P(3HB-co-LA) in E. coli was also performed involving engineered propionate CoA-
transferase and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase for the efﬁcient generation 
of lactyl-CoA and incorporation of lactyl-CoA into the polymer, respectively [199]. 
The research focused on the study of enzymatic copolymerization of LA with 2-
bromo-3-hydroxypropanoic acid using physically immobilized Candida antarctica 
Lipase B. 
The enzyme-mediated ceramic synthesis techniques include precipitants of the 
metal ions that are generated by the enzymatic reactions as well as the metal ions 
in the solutions getting precipitated into carbonates, oxides, phosphates, or hydrox-
ides. Enzymes can also interact directly with the metal-containing substrates for 
producing ceramic material [2001]and allow the synthesis of inorganic solids under 
mild conditions [2002] [193]

Enzymes in Medicine 
1.6.1 
General 
Ten main applications of enzymes in medicine are [207–237]: (1) Diabetics use 
strips of paper fertilized with aldohexose enzyme to observe their glucose; (2) the 
presence of enzymes may facilitate to diagnose malady; (3) enzymes are typically 
used as medicines to interchange enzyme deﬁciencies in patients; (4) nuclease could 
be a potential medical care for monogenic disorder which caused by variation in 
a single gene; (5) proteases are accustomed to clean wounds and thus accelerate 
the healing method; (6) the chemical synthesis of complicated medicine is used 
to perform chemical conversions; (7) enzymes are accustomed to aid digestion, to 
supplement the natural amylase, lipase and protease produced by the pancreas; (8) 
enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, serratiopeptidase used to break the internal 
blood clots, to dissolve the hardening of walls of blood vessels, and to dissolve 
the wound swelling to promote healing; (9) enzymes are the preferred markers in 
various disease states such as myocardial infarction, jaundice, pancreatitis, cancer, 
and neurodegenerative disorders; and (10) enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, 
serratiopeptidase are used to dissolve the swelling 
The unique characteristics of enzymes make them highly applicable for a number 
of chemical transformation reactions in pharmaceutical industries, such as group 
protection and deprotection, selective acylation and deacylation, selective hydrolysis,

deracemization, kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures, esteriﬁcation, transesteriﬁca-
tion, and many others [2005] [2005]. For example, β-glucuronidase (βGLU)—a lyso-
somal acid hydrolase responsible for the catalytic deconjugation of β-d-glucuronides 
has emerged as a viable molecular target for several therapeutic applications [207]. 
Due to its role in colon carcinogenesis and certain drug-induced dose-limiting toxici-
ties, the development of potent inhibitors of βGLU in human intestinal microbiota has 
been aroused. For example, the aim of work [207] was to improve βG LU inhibitory  
potency and the development of new therapeutic agents. Enzymes in healthcare 
and medicine are used for treating disorders, assisting metabolism, medical device 
cleaning, the manufacture of medicines, regulation of digestion, detection of diseases, 
addressing food quality, treating heart diseases, and monitoring the health of fetus 
during pregnancy [208]. 
1.6.2 
Enzymes in Cancer 
Considerable support exists for the roles of metabolism in modulating the carcino-
genic properties of chemicals, which are procarcinogens that require activation 
p[2008−213]. The metabolism and especially bioactivation of carcinogens are domi-
nated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (66% of bioactivations) (Fig. 1.14). The roles of 
these P450s were considered in issues involving enzyme induction, chemoprevention, 
molecular epidemiology, interindividual variations, and risk assessment. Evidence 
from numerous in vitro studies, utilizing reconstituted systems, microsomal fractions 
and cultured cells, implicated cytochrome P450 enzymes as being the predominant 
enzymes responsible for the metabolic activation of many procarcinogens. 
Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) were found to be essential for the activation or inac-
tivation of anticancer drugs. Some products, undergoing the metabolic pathway of 
the CYP enzyme such as hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls

and 4-chlorobiphenyl, are toxic to humans and are considered to be poten-
tial carcinogens [211] The association between CYP expression and cancer risk, 
tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis and prognosis has been widely reported in 
basic and clinical studies. Review [209] covered studies in which ﬁve procarcino-
gens representing different chemical classes, benzo[a]pyrene, 4-aminobiphenyl (4-
ABP), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4, 5-b]pyridine, 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2, 
3-b]indole, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, have been admin-
istered to different P450 knockout mouse models. Of various human P450 enzymes 
determined to date, CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A13, 2A6, 2E1, and 3A4 were reported to 
play critical roles in the bioactivation of carcinogenic chemicals [210]. In vivo studies 
have shown that: (1) disruption of Cyp1b1 and Cyp2a5 genes in mice resulted in 
suppression of tumor formation caused by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and 4-
(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, respectively; (2) speciﬁc inhibitors 
for CYP1 and 2A enzymes are able to suppress tumor formation caused by several 
carcinogens in experimental animals in vivo; (3) inhibitors of human CYP1 and 
CYP2A enzymes activated carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
and tobacco-related nitrosamines, respectively, in humans; and (4) the consid-
ered inhibitors include a variety of carcinogenic and/or noncarcinogenic PAHs and 
acetylenic PAHs, many ﬂavonoid derivatives, derivatives of naphthalene, phenan-
threne, biphenyl, and pyrene and chemopreventive organoselenium compounds, 
such as benzyl selenocyanate and benzyl selenocyanate; o-XSC, 1,2-, 1,3-, and 
1,4-phenylenebis (methylene)selenocyanate. 
A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) dynamic simulations 
were performed to explore the interaction between naphthalene and the cytochrome 
P450 enzyme (CYP 1B1) [211]. Computational results showed that both additions 
on α- and β-carbon can generate naphthalene 1,2-oxide. The activation barrier for 
the addition of β-carbon was found to be higher than that for the α-carbon by 2.6 
kcal·mol–1. It was also found that naphthalene 1,2-oxide is unstable and the O–C bond 
cleavage easily occurs via cellular hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical/anion; then it will 
convert to the potential ultimate carcinogen 1,2-naphthoquinone. Recently, metabolic 
therapy for cancer, particularly in amino acid deprivation by enzymes were in a 
focus of special attention [211]. For example, L-asparaginase was approved for 
the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia according to the US Food and Drug 
Administration. Arginine deiminase and recombinant human arginase have been 
developed into clinical trials as potential cancer therapeutic agents for the treatment 
of arginine-auxotrophic tumors methionase, lysine oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia 
lyase. Autophagy is a catabolic process that is responsible for the degradation of 
dysfunctional proteins and organelles. In response to metabolism stress, autophagy 
could be induced by amino acid deprivation. The manipulation of autophagy in

combination with amino acid-degrading enzymes is a potential therapeutic approach 
in preclinical studies. Figure 1.15 schematically illustrates the cytoprotective role of 
autophagy in the cytotoxicity induced by amino acid-degrading enzymes. In recent 
years, there has been increasing interest in targeting tumor amino acid metabolism 
as a strategy to treat cancer [218−221]. 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a virus (SARS-CoV-2) 
which quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic [222−237] 
Today, COVID-19 has infected more than 300 million people and has already 
killed more than 5.5 million around the world (World Health Organization). A review 
[213, 222] discussed the main enzymes related to COVID-19, summarizing the ﬁnd-
ings on their role in viral entry mechanism, the consequences of their dysregulation, 
and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on them. The following important aspects 
were in focus of attention: (1) Initially, the SARS-CoV-2 virus came to attention 
through its effects on the respiratory system; (2) other organs also can be injured; 
(3) SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body cells through the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the cell surface [214] (Fig. 1.16); (4) the virus can be found in 
almost every tissue of body and affects the number of receptor; and (5) after invasion, 
the immune system reaction is responsible for the cytokine storm, which leads to 
inappropriate responses that cause tissue damage and hence multi-organ failure and 
death.
A vast amount of clinical data has been revealing COVID-19 enzymatic alter-
ation patterns, including cardiac, pancreatic, and hepatic ones associated with organ 
damage. In addition, viral mutations can create new disease behaviors, and these 
effects are related to the activity of enzymes. The cleavage of human proteins such 
as MYH7 and MYH6 (cardiac myosins linked to several cardiomyopathies), FOXP3

Fig. 1.16 Simpliﬁed representation of the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) approaches the cell membrane 
(1) and it binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; colored in red) (pink arrow, step 
A) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein. The S protein suffers 
a conformational change and it is cleaved by the transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2; 
colored in blue) (pink arrow, step B), when this protease is expressed in the cell. The S protein has 
two cleavage sites, represented by the dotted lines, S1/S2, which is between the S1 and S2 domains; 
and S2′, which is within S2 domain; also, the RBD is housed in the S1 domain (pink arrow, step 
C). After binding ACE2 and being cleaved by TMPRSS2, the virus fuses with the cell membrane 
(2A) and the viral RNA is released in the cytosol (2B). Alternatively, the virus can enter the cell 
through endocytosis (3A). In the endosome, the viral particle is cleaved by cathepsins B and L 
(CatB/L) (3B). The viral particle fuses with the endosome membrane (3C) and the viral RNA is 
released in the cytosol (3D). After the release of the viral RNA, either by previous binding of the 
viral particle to ACE2 or by previous endosome encompassing, the virus undergoes the replication 
step (4), in which it subverts the cell machinery (not shown). After this step and the synthesis of the 
viral polyproteins (pp) pp1a and pp1ab, the viral proteases main protease (Mpro) and papain-like 
protease (PLpro) play important roles in releasing themselves by autoproteolytic activity and in 
processing the central and the C-proximal region of pp1a/pp1ab (Mpro) and the N-proximal region 
of pp1a/pp1ab (PLpro) (not shown). After replication, a new viral particle is generated and it is 
released from the cell. The presence of the viral RNA detected in other cells elicits the release of 
cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6, not discussed in this paper), in the body. IL-6 binds to its cell 
membrane receptor, it activates the JAK/STAT pathway (6A), and it promotes the cytokine storm 
(7) in the targeted cells. In parallel, the release of viral RNA in the cytosol (steps 1, 2A, and 2B, or 
steps 3A, 3B, and 3C) can also directly activate the JAK/STAT pathway in the same cell (6B and 
6C), and then it promotes the cytokine storm (7). ACE2, catB/L, and TMPRSS2 are ubiquitously 
expressed in the body. TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease-2 [Color ﬁgure can be viewed

(transcription factor), ErbB4 (HER4), and plasma protein S (PROS1), an antico 
agulation protein by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) was demon-
strated [217]. “Numerous clinical data has been revealing COVID-19 enzymatic 
alteration patterns, including cardiac, pancreatic, and hepatic ones associated with 
organ damage (Fig. 1.16) [222]. Beyond that, some of these alterations could have a 
role in prognosis [223] or cause a clinical complication directly [224]. 
Overview [222] reported that in SARS-CoV-2 following proteases are vital for 
the infection: the main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), angiotensin-
converting enzyme-2, transmembrane serine protease-2, cathepsins (CatB/L) lipase, 
enzymes from the cholesterol metabolism pathway, amylase, aspartate aminotrans-
ferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase. This review stressed on the importance of detailed enzy-
matic studies for future treatments against SARS-CoV-2. Simpliﬁed representation 
of the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 is displayed in Fig. 1.16. 
In review, [223] the role of enzymes such as the N4-hydroxylated nucleobase, 
viral RNA polymerase mammalian RNA polymerases in developing a biocatalytic 
method to synthesize molnupiravir, 
an orally available antiviral agent with clinical efﬁcacy against COVID-19 has 
been evaluated. Molnupiravir is currently approved for the treatment of mild-to-
moderate COVID-19 in adults by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency. The cytochromes P450 were associated with the metabolism of 
environmental toxins, drugs, and carcinogens. The role of these enzymes in COVID-
19 pathogenesis and therapy, the possible changes in CYP expression and/or function 
in COVID-19, the effects of CYPs on the metabolism of arachidonic acid, vitamins, 
and steroid hormones in COVID-19; and the effects of CYPs on the metabolism of 
therapeutic COVID-19 drugs were evaluated [227]. The possible changes in CYP 
expression and/or function in COVID-19, the effects of CYPs on the metabolism of 
arachidonic acid, vitamins, and steroid hormones in COVID-19 the effects of CYPs 
on the metabolism of therapeutic COVID-19 drugs were discussed. 
It was showed [237] that betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2)’. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) utilizes dipep-

Angiotensin 
is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood 
pressure. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inﬂamma-
tion via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The 
dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions was discussed in detail.

Methods of Analysis in Enzyme Processes 
Abstract To monitor the kinetics of enzymatic processes, a whole cascade of physic-
ochemical methods is used. This chapter is devoted to a brief review of the physical 
foundations of these methods, the application of which is illustrated by typical exam-
ples. The most traditional and widely used methods are conventional absorption, 
infrared, Raman and luminescence spectroscopies with timescales from 10−14 s to  
10−2 s. Much less commonly used are such developed physical methods as dielec-
tric relaxation (DR), depolarized light scattering (DLS), optical Kerr-effect (OKE), 
ultrasound, terahertz (THz) spectroscopies, femtosecond pump–probe, photon-echo, 
optical Kerr effect, sum-frequency generation, two-dimensional infrared spectro-
scopic two-dimensional sum-frequency generation, three-dimensional infrared, and 
two-dimensional Raman terahertz spectroscopy.

Optical Methods 
2.1.1 
Introduction 
Timescales of conventional absorption, infrared and Raman spectroscopy used to 
investigate the structure of liquid water and biomolecular solutions are from 10−15 
s to 10−2 s (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2). A second group of techniques includes dielec-
tric relaxation (DR), depolarized light scattering (DLS), optical Kerr-effect (OKE), 
ultrasound, terahertz (THz) spectroscopies, femtosecond pump–probe, photon-echo, 
optical Kerr effect, sum-frequency generation, two-dimensional infrared spectro-
scopic two-dimensional sum-frequency generation, three-dimensional infrared, and 
two-dimensional Raman terahertz spectroscopy [1–7].
Different regimes in time for the structural dynamics, considered in review [3] 
are: (1) The vibrational periods of the intramolecular OH stretching and bending 
vibrations are approximately from 0.01 ps to 20 fs; (2) A time scale between several 
tens and several hundreds of femtoseconds relates to librational (hindered rotational) 
motions; (3) At short times are motions localized on a single or a few molecules and 
are more delocalized over groups of molecules at hundreds of femtoseconds; and

2.1.2 
Absorption (UV/Vis) 
Light absorption is a process by which light is absorbed and electromagnetic energy 
of photon is converted into thermal energy. Absorbance (A), optical density (OD), 
the quantity of light absorbed by a solution can be expressed by the following [4–7]: 
up per A equals Log Subscript 10 Baseline left parenthesis upper I 0 divided by upper I right parenthesis
where I0 is the intensity of the incident light, and I is intensity of that light after it 
passed through the sample. The concentration of a sample can be calculated from its 
absorbance using the Beer–Lambert la: 
up per A equals epsilon c p
where ε is the molar absorptivity, or molar extinction coefﬁcient, in L mol-1 cm-1, 
c is the concentration of the solute in solution, in mol/L, p is the path length of the 
sample, in cm, for example 1 cm for a cuvette.

Molecules containing bonding and non-bonding electrons (n-electrons) can

to higher anti-bonding molecular orbitals [5]. Four possible types of transitions can

Work [8] illustrated a typical application of absorption spectroscopy in 
enzymatic catalysis. For example, when alkaline phosphatase reacts with p-
nitrophenylphosphate, inorganic phosphate and p-nitrophenol having a stable yellow 
color in an alkaline solution (λ = 405 nm are produced. Speciﬁcally, the amount of 
product, p-nitrophenol was determined by reading the absorbance at 405 nm and 
using a molar extinction coefﬁcient of 18,000 M−1 cm−1. 
In Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy provides a direct monitor of 
enzymatic reactions. In this method, measurement of enzymatic activity is based 
on the fact that the infrared spectra of reactants and products of an enzymatic reac-
tion are usually different. Several examples were given using the enzymes pyru-
vate kinase, fumarase and alcohol dehydrogenase [12]. The FTIR measurements 
approach was employed to examine digestion complex substrates. For example 
salmon- and chicken-based substrates were digested for 80 minutes using Alcalase, 
a protease obtained from Bacillus licheniformis< and a total of FTIR spectra were 
acquired during the course of the hydrolysis [13]. The observed changes in the IR 
spectral features indicated the beakdown of the amide backbone and formation of 
amino and carboxylate terminals. The most consistent markers for hydrolysis time 
were the bands at 1516 cm−1 (–NH3 +), and ∼1400 cm−1 (–COO−), and the protein 
backbone region (800–1800 cm−1).

Raman and Infrared Spectroscopy 
The process of Raman scattering is the transition of a molecule from its ground 
state to an excited vibrational state, accompanied by the simultaneous absorption 
of an incident photon and emission of a Raman scattered photon [9]. The different 
possibilities of light scattering are (Fig. 2.4): (1) Rayleigh scattering (no exchange 
of energy:), (2) Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule absorbs energy and 
scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon); and (3) Anti-Stokes 
Raman scattering (atom or molecule loses energy and scattered photon has more 
energy than the incident photon). The Raman scattered light can be collected by a 
spectrometer (Fig. 2.5) and displayed as intensity versus frequency change. 
Fig. 2.4 The different possibilities of light scattering: Rayleigh scattering (no exchange of energy: 
incident and scattered photons have the same energy), Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule 
absorbs energy: scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon) and anti-Stokes Raman

photon) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_scattering. Published under CC BY-SA 3.0 licence

A glancing-angle Raman spectroscopy probe was proved to be sensitive technique 
to changes within the upper 50 monolayers of water and is thus capable of detecting 
changes occurring at the air-ice interface [11]. Glancing-angle is the angle between 
the beam and the surface. In Raman spectra of the OH-stretching region of room 
temperature bulk water (Fig. 2.6), the large shoulder on the low-wavenumber side 
(3200 cm−1) of the solid trace was assigned to vibrations involving more highly 
hydrogen bonded (“4-coordinate”) molecules. 
A new assay system for measuring the time course of enzymatic reactions 
involving gaseous substrates based on Raman spectroscopy was developed [10]. 
The system, catalyzing the reversible oxidation of H2 and possesses the nonphysio-
logical functions of H/D exchange and nuclear spin isomer conversion reactions, was 
applied to the kinetic study of the [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris . 
Using the proposed system, H2 is concomitantly produced alongside HD by the H/ 
D exchange reaction in the D2/H2O system. Typical rotational-vibrational spectrum 
of the gaseous molecular hydrogen species is presented in Fig. 2.6. 
2.1.4 
Fluorescence Spectroscopy 
Fluorescence spectroscopy (ﬂuorometry) uses a beam of light that excites the elec-
trons in molecules of certain compounds, and causes them to emit light [14–19]. The 
excited state undergoes rapid thermal energy loss to the environment through vibra-
tions, until the lowest vibrational state from the excited electronic state was reached 
and then a photon is emitted from the lowest-lying singlet excited state. This process 
is often visualized with a Jablonski diagram (Fig. 2.7). In a typical ﬂuorescence emis-
sion measurement, the excitation wavelength is ﬁxed and the detection wavelength 
varies, while in a ﬂuorescence excitation measurement the detection wavelength is 
ﬁxed and the excitation wavelength is varied across a region of interest. The sensi-
tivity of ﬂuorometry would be 10−102 higher then sensitivity of Ultraviolet–visible

(Uv–vis) absorption. In the Jablonski diagram of absorbance, non-radiative decay, 
and ﬂuorescence electronic transitions are about one eV, vibrational transitions are 
about 0.1 eV, and rotational transitions are about 0.001 eV. Absorption takes about 
one femtosecond, relaxation takes about one picosecond, ﬂuorescence takes about 
one nanosecond. S0 and S1 represent different electronic states. 
The main luminescence parameters are: the frequency of maximal intensity v Subscript max, 
intensity I, the quantum yield, phi, the lifetime of the exited state tau, and param-
eters of polarization and excited state energy migration [19]. The usefulness of 
the ﬂuorescence methods is greatly enhanced by the developments of new experi-
mental techniques such as nano-, pico- and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy, 
single-molecule detection, cofocal microscopy and two-photon correlation spec-
troscopy [20]. As an example, a sensitive ﬂuorescence-based assay to monitor 
bacterial apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase (Lnt) activity was developed [17]. The 
enzyme transfers the acyl group to lipoproteins and is involved in lipoprotein biosyn-
thesis in Gram-negative bacteria. The assay is based on Lnt in vitro activity test, to 
monitor apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase activity through direct read-out of ﬂuores-
cent triacylated peptide. Fluorescence-based apolipoprotein N-acyl transferase assay 
includes three steps (1) Lnt catalyzes the transfer of C16:0(alkyne) onto ﬁbronectin 
stimulating factor-1 (FSL)-1-biotin; (2) A click chemistry reaction with an azido-
Cy5 results in conjugation of the ﬂuorescent group onto the alkyne fatty acid; and 
(3) Detection of product formation by in-gel ﬂuorescence and ﬂuorescence spec-
troscopy in 96-well plate format. This sensitive assay allowed detailed characteriza-
tion of the molecular mechanism of acyltransferases. Click chemistry is a class of 
simple, atom-economy reactions commonly used for joining two molecular entities 
of choice.

Phosphorescence (Fig. 2.8) is a process where the photon is emitted, not from a 
singlet-excited state, but from a forbidden triplet state. The time scale of ﬂuorescence 
emission is generally in the picosecond to nanosecond range, while phosphorescence 
typically lasts for ﬂuorescence microseconds, milliseconds, or even longer minutes 
or hours. 
The polarity of a solvent can be quantitatively characterized by the spectral prop-
erties of a dye chosen as the standard [22]. For example, the solvent polarity ET(30) 
scale is usually measured by vis spectrophotometric measurements of the long-
wavelength intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) absorption band of Reichardt’s 
pyridinium-N-phenolate betaine dye, e.g. the ET(30) dye

In order to understand the role of water in solvating the polar sites of the molecule, 
the spectroscopy of anthranilic acid (AA) [21] 
was examined in neat and binary solvents of varying polarity and hydrogen bonding. 
With the exception of water, the Stokes shift of AA in different solvents was found to 
be linearly correlated with the normalized molar transition energy of solvent polarity 
(ET N) (Fig. 2.9) This ﬁnding indicates the major role of the hydrogen bonding effect 
in solution. Analysis of the absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra revealed that AA 
exists as an anion in neutral water.

therein. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the CW ESR technique is not sufﬁcient for 
real time monitoring of picomole redox processes in biological systems. 
An approach to quantitative study redox processes based on the phenomenon of the 
intramolecular ﬂuorescence quenching of the ﬂuorophore fragment by the nitroxide 
in a dual ﬂuorescent- nitroxide supermolecule was proposed and developed by Lkht-
enshtein group [36]. It was ﬁrst shown in 1986 , that in a dual ﬂuorescent-nitroxide 
probes molecule 
FN 
photochemical reduction of the nitroxide fragment results in decay of the ESR signal 
and drastic enhancement of the ﬂuorescence [36]. Thus, the redox process can be 
monitored using two independent methods, ESR and the signiﬁcantly more sensitive 
ﬂuorescence technique. A similar effect was observed after chemical reduction of 
dual ﬂuorophore-nitroxide compounds by ascorbic acids and other antioxidants, as 
well as nitric oxide and superoxide [27–38]. Trapping of free radicals by FNRO·can 
be also detected following ESR signal decay and ﬂuorescence [37, 38]. Using the 
abovementioned unique properties of the dual molecules, a method for the quantita-
tive analysis of vitamin C in biological and chemical liquids has been proposed [29]. 
Speciﬁcally, pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction between the dual molecule FN and ascorbic 
acid was monitored. An increase in the ﬂuorescent intensity and decay of the EPR 
signal of the dual probe FN occurred with the same rate constant kred. The calibra-
tion curves of kred—ascorbic acid concentration for vitamin C analysis were used 
for performing vitamin C analysis in human blood plasma and commercial juces 
A collection of dual probes of different redox potential of the nitroxide segment 
and the ﬂuorofore spectral property were synthesized, that made it possible to select 
reducing agents appropriate for different media (Fig. 2.10). World distribution of 
groups using dual ﬂuorophore-nitroxide method of analysis after the ﬁrst publication 
of the use of as a redox probe in 1986. is illustrated in Fig. 2.11.

can be reduced by a variety of free radicals (e.g. superoxide) and antioxidants (e.g. 
ascorbic acid, quercetin, galangin, etc.) [30]. The reduction of PN to was accompa-
nied by a drastic, about 2000 time, increase in ﬂuorescence intensity and a corre-
sponding decrease of the EPR signal. The developed ﬂuorescence technique allows 
detection of antioxidants at the submicromolar concentration scale, while the EPR 
and light absorption techniques are limited to several micromolar. A new rapid and 
highly sensitive method for real time superoxide analysis has been developed based 
on a reaction of ﬂuorophore–nitronyl with upp
er  O Subscript 2 Superscript minus Baseline left bracket 30 right bracket The reaction of PN with super-
oxide radicals, as a reduced agent, generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system 
with slow rate (ωi < 2  ×10−7 M/min), was readily monitored by the ﬂuorescent and 
ESR techniques. The dependence of rate of ﬂuorescent increase (dI/dt) on the rate of 
superoxide production was used as a calibration curve for real time monitoring upp
er O Subscript 2 Superscript minus 
in biological and chemical systems. This method has also been applied to the deter-
mination of hydrogen peroxide in submicromolar concentrations. The speciﬁcity of 
this approach can be enhanced by the addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase. 
2.1.6 
Terahertz Spectroscopy 
Terahertz spectroscopy detects properties of matter with electromagnetic ﬁelds that 
are in the frequency range between a few hundred gigahertz and several tera-
hertz (1 THz = 1012 Hz) [39–50]. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) 
is a spectroscopic technique in which the properties of matter are probed with short 
pulses of terahertz radiation. THz spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing 
dynamical modes {e.g., rotational, torsional, phonon, intramolecular and intermolec-
ular). Typical laser based experiments of THz spectroscopy are: THz time-domain 
spectroscopy (THz- TDS), time-resolved THz spectroscopy (TRTS), THz emission 
spectroscopy (TES), and THz attenuated total reﬂection THz ATR. 
The dielectric function is a measurement of the sample polarizability and could 
be described by using the Debye model [47]. When the applied ﬁeld acts on the 
solution, the molecules would polarize. After the ﬁeld disappears, the molecular 
polarization would vanish, and molecules would tend to relax back to their original 
state. The time required for the relaxation process is called the relaxation time τ. A  
general expression for modeling the complex dielectric permittivity function based 
on Debye model can be obtained as follows [47]:

where s represents the electrical conductivity of the medium and particles, ω is the 
angular frequency of the electric ﬁeld applied. 
The dielectric responses of liquids have been extensively studied in the THz range 
and modeled using two Debye relaxation processes—a slow one (few ps) and a fast 
one less than femtoseconds (fs). Both processes depending on the temperature [40]. 
The enzymatic reaction of trypsin was controlled by ﬂuorescent microscopy before 
being analyzed by sub-THz spectroscopy in the frequency range 0.06–0.11 THz [40]. 
Terahertz measurements were carried out using a vectorial network analyzer, which 
emits and detects THz radiations. The speciﬁc substrate NαBenzoyl-L-Arginine-7-
Amido-4-MethylCoumarin (BA-AMC) was injected into the functionalized chan-
nels, and its hydrolysis was detected according to the reaction: BA-AMC + H2O 
→ Nα-Benzoyl-L-Arginine + 7-Amino-4-MethylCoumarin (AMC). Experiment 
showed that this activity is associated with conformational changes that occur during 
the conversion of substrates to products, such as protein hydrolysis into peptides after 
binding to a speciﬁc enzyme. 
In study [50] the feasibility of employing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy 
(THz-TDS) for the nondestructive and label-free monitoring of protein digestion was 
evaluated. All experiments were carried out by employing a compact commercial 
THz-TDS (TR-1000; Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan). The Er-doped femtosecond-
pulsed laser (FemtoliteCS-20; IMRA, AISIN, Japan) in this system, which operates 
at a repetition rate of 50 MHz, emits a 780-nm laser beam was employed. The acid 
protease, pepsin, was used at its optimal pH to hydrolyze bovine serum albumin. 
The Debye model to analyze the dielectric properties of the solution during protein 
hydrolysis was explored.

Introduction 
Through standard electrochemical measurements, catalytic activity, reversibility and 
stability, potentials of redox-active cofactors, and interfacial electron transfer rates 
can be measured [51–55]. The electrochemical behavior of molecules including 
analyte and product concentrations can be investigated, employing amperometry, 
potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS), chronoamperometry, chronocoulometry (CC) and adsorptive stripping differ-
ential pulse voltammetry (AdSDPV). The determination of analyte concentrations 
with selective, fast, and robust electrochemical methods is widely used for biolog-
ical processes control, product analysis, environmental compliance, and medical 
applications.

2.2.2 
Amperometry 
Any analyte that can be oxidized or reduced is a candidate for amperometric detection. 
In this technique, a voltage (potential) is applied between two electrodes [51–57]. 
When an electroactive analyte is oxidized at the anode or reduced at the cathode the 
measured electric current changes occur. In pulsed amperometric detection (PAD), a 
working potential is applied for a short time (a few hundred milliseconds). Potential 
applications of amperometric biosensors range from the monitoring of environmental 
markers like pesticides, medical analytes in blood urine, glucose, lactate, and choles-
terol, biomarkers for cancer or diabetes, to monitoring various industrially important 
substances as saccharides, alcohols, and phenols, cellulose-degradation and lignocel-
lulosic biomass. Enzymes for application in 3rd generation amperometric biosensors 
are mostly heme, ﬂavo-, or quino-enzymes, but copper enzymes are also known to 
interact with electrodes through direct electron transfer (DET) [51–55]. 
2.2.3 
The Oxygen Electrode 
The Clark electrode [58, 59] is an electrode that measures ambient oxygen partial 
pressure in a liquid amperometric oxygen measurement using a catalytic plat-
inum surface according to the net reaction: 
up er O Subs cript 2 Baseline plus 4 e Superscript minus Baseline plus 4 upper H Superscript plus Baseline right arrow 2 upper H Subscript 2 Baseline upper O
The Clark type electrode uses a silver/platnium-electrodes immersed in an elec-
tolyte solution (Fig. 2.12). When a polarizing voltage is applied to the cathode, elec-
trons combine with oxygen molecules and reduce them to hydroxide ions. The elec-
trode compartment is isolated from the reaction chamber by a thin Teﬂon membrane; 
which is permeable to molecular oxygen and allows this gas to reach the cathode.
2.2.4 
Voltammetry 
Voltammetry is the study of current (in amperes) as a function of applied potential 
(in volts) [52–54, 60]. To conduct such an experiment, one requires two electrodes. 
The working electrode, contacting with the an analyte, applies the desired poten-
tial and facilitate the transfer of charge to and from the analyte. A second refer-
ence electrode with a known stable reduction potential acts as the other half of the 
electrochemical cell. The  auxiliary electrode passes all the current needed to balance 
the current observed at the working electrode (Fig. 2.13). The analytical data for 
a voltammetric experiment comes in the form of a voltammogram which plots the 
current produced by the analyte versus the potential of the working electrode. The

Polarography 
Principle of a voltammetric polarography is the study of electrode processes in 
solution by means of electrolysis with two electrodes, one polarizable and one unpo-
larizable, the former formed by mercury regularly dropping from a capillary tube 
[52, 53, 61–63]. The method is based on the measurement of the ratio of oxygen 
consumed by the enzyme in the presence of a limited amount of substrate as an 
internal standard to the total dissolved oxygen. The oxygen concentration can be 
measured by the addition of an excess amount of substrate or sodium hydrosulphite. 
As an example, the polarographic and spectrophotometric methods were utilized 
for detection of mitochondrial disorders [63]. In six patients suspected of mitochon-
drial disease defects of complex I (two patients), complex III (one patient), complex 
IV (two patients) and a combination of defect of complex III and IV (one patient) 
were founded. 
2.2.6 
Cyclic Voltammetry 
In cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment, the working electrode’s potential is ramped 
in the opposite direction to return to the initial potential [53, 64, 65]. The current 
at the working electrode is plotted versus the applied voltage (the working elec-
trode’s potential) to give the cyclic voltammogram trace. Cyclic voltammetry is 
generally used to study the electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution or 
of a molecule that is adsorbed onto the electrode. A standard CV experiment 
employs a cell ﬁtted with three electrodes: reference electrode, working electrode, 
and counter (auxiliary) electrode. The homogeneous reaction between glucose 
oxidase and osmium bipyridine–pyridine carboxylic acid in the presence of glucose 
has been studied by cyclic voltammetry and digital simulation (Fig. 2.14) [66, 67].

A standard three-electrode electrochemical cell was employed with an operational

reference electrode was utilized and; the auxiliary electrode was a large area plat-
inum gauze (a thin translucent fabric ) (Fig. 2.14). Measurements of the dependence 
of the amperometric response on enzyme, substrate and co-substrate concentra-
tions with digital simulation of the coupled enzyme reaction diffusion allowed to 
extract kinetic parameters for the substrate–enzyme reaction: KMS = 10.8 mM, kcat 
= 254 s− 1 and for the redox mediator–enzyme reaction, k = 2.2 × 105 M− 1 s− 1.

Potentiometry 
Potentiometry measures the potential of a solution between two electrodes. One 
electrode is called the reference electrode and has a constant potential, while the 
other one is an indicator electrode whose potential changes with the composition of

its activity to the reference electrode. The advantage of potentiometric biosensors is 
their sensitivity and selectivity when a highly stable and accurate reference electrode 
was used [68]. Potentiometric methods of the pH measurement are based on the 
measurement of the activity of hydrogen ions in an acid–base system of known ratio 
between basic and acidic forms of the compound [69]. The pH is measured through a 
calibrated glass combination electrode, over a concentration range of 0.005–0.05 M 
and in 2–12 aqueous pH range. The pKa is determined by a titration of the basic or 
acidic compound with a standardized strong acid or base. The plot of pH against the 
volume of the added titrant is called potentiometric titration curve. 
Open circuit potential (OCP) is deﬁned as the potential that exists in an open 
circuit. Figure 2.16 demonstrates the application of open circuit potentiometry 
(OCP) to measure glucose oxidase turnover kinetics, kturn [70]. The electrode 
surface becomes poised by the addition of a redox pair, such as ferrocenemethanol/ 
ferrocenium methanol (FcMeOH/FcMeOH+), which acts as the cosubstrate for the 
enzymatic process.

the working electrode is stepped and the resulting current from faradaic processes, 
occurring at the electrode, is monitored as a function of time [53, 71, 72]. Faradaic

processes are deﬁned as those which obey Faraday’s law, that is the amount of chem-
ical reaction occurring is directly proportional to the amount of charge passed across 
the electrode boundary. The functional relationship between current response and 
time is measured after applying a single potential step (applying a forward poten-
tial step and recording the resulting current) or a double potential step (applying 
a forward potential and returning the potential to the initial value during a given 
period of time) to the working electrode of the electrochemical system. There 
are two types of chronoamperometry that are commonly used, controlled-potential 
chronoamperometry and controlled-current chronoamperometry. Current at a given 
time, i(t) (measured in units of amperes), is directly proportional to concentration,

Coulometry 
Coulometry determines the amount of matter transformed during an electrolysis reac-
tion by measuring the amount of electricity (in coulombs) consumed or produced 
[53, 72, 75] This method, based on the strict proportionality between the extent of 
a chemical change and the quantity of electricity involved (Faraday’s law), can be 
used for determining the quantity of a substance, charge, and the amperes. There are 
two basic categories of coulometric techniques: potentiostatic coulometry involves 
holding the electric potential constant during the reaction using a potentiostat and 
coulometric titration or amperostatic coulometry, keeps the current \constant using 
an amperostat. Chronocoulometry is used to study the kinetics of chemical reactions, 
diffusion processes, and adsorption. 
2.2.10 
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is characterized by an electrical 
circuit consists of resistances, capacitors, or constant phase elements that are 
connected in parallel or in a series to form an equivalent circuit Fig. 2.18 [53, 76–78], 
A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric ﬁeld. Capacitance 
is expressed as the ratio of the electric charge on each conductor to the potential 
difference (i.e., voltage) between them. The EIS has the ability to study intrinsic 
material properties or speciﬁc processes that could inﬂuence conductance, resis-
tance, or capacitance of an electrochemical system. Thus, the EIS could be used to 
explore mass-transfer, charge-transfer, and diffusion processes. The excitation signal

2.4 Magnetic Resonance

Magnetic Resonance 
2.4.1 
Grounds 
Electron and some nuclei possess corresponding intrinsic angular momentums that 
are quantized. In an external magnetic ﬁeld, there is a high-energy state and a low-
energy state depending on the relative orientation of the magnet to the external 
ﬁeld, and in thermal equilibrium, the low-energy orientation is preferred [82, 86–90, 
93–112]. In a constant magnetic ﬁeld of strength H0, the Electron Spin Resonance 
(ESR) phenomena involves the resonance absorption or dispersion of a microwave 
frequency (ν) (0.3−250 GHz) of electromagnetic ﬁeld. The microwave absorption 
leads to magnetization in the exited state of the system. Accordingly, the electron 
magnetic resonance condition is [2.1] :

m b o l h v equals g Subscript e Baseline beta Subscript upper B Baseline b o l d s y m b o l upper H 0 comma
where ge is a g-factor, characterizing the value of the intrinsic electron

l
eft parenthesis 9 dot 27400968 times 10 Superscript negative 24 Baseline upper J dot upper T Superscript negative 1 Baseline right parenthesis 
. The values of g-factors and magnetic ﬁeld strength 
H0 dictate position of resonance frequencies in the ESR spectra. The interaction of 
an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins 
results in additional allowed energy states. This phenomenon leads to the superﬁne 
(hipperﬁne) splitting of the ESR signal into N lines in accordance with the quantum 
mechanical rule N = 2I +1 where I is the nuclear quantum number. Three common 
mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are: the isotropic Fermi contact 
interaction, dipolar interaction and dynamic nuclear spin polarization The isotropic 
Fermi contact interaction is the quantum mechanical magnetic interaction between 
an electron and an atomic nucleus when the electron is inside that nucleus. The 
anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction between spin electron and spin of nucleus 
depends on the sample orientation. Dynamic nuclear spin polarization is a mech-
anism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin. Spin polar-
ization is the degree to which the spin is aligned with a given direction. Dynamic 
nuclear polarization (DNP) relates to transferring spin polarization from electrons 
to nuclei, resulted in aligning the nuclear spins to the extent that electron spins are 
aligned [10–12, 14, 105–110]. 
Spin relaxations times are important parameters of electron spin resonance 
and nuclear magnetic resonance [82, 86–94, 111–113]. The characteristic time of 
recovery of the induced magnetization to the ground state on account a transfer of 
magnetic energy to energy of media (lattice) is noticed as spin-lattice relaxation (1/ 
T 1). Another type of relaxation, spin-spin or spin-phase relaxation (1/T 2), is related to 
time of return of the spin system to equilibrium in the exited magnetic state as a result 
of spin-spin interaction with environment. The second approach to the spin relax-
ations phenomena is based on properties of the electron Larmor precession, which is 
the precession of the magnetic moments of electrons about external magnetic ﬁeld.

In effect saturation phenomenon, the population of ground and excited states, and 
hence the rates of both transitions are equalized, and the signal disappeared. The 
ability of NMR or ESR signals to become saturated in an applied microwave RF or 
MW ﬁeld is determined by the value of the MW amplitude H1 and the spin relaxation 
parameters (T 1e,n and T 2e,n ). These parameters can be measured directly be pules 
methods [91–93, 111–113]. 
2.4.2 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Based Methods 
2.4.2.1
Grounds 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a phenomenon in which nuclei in a strong 
constant magnetic ﬁeld are perturbed by radiation of radio frequency. The nucleus 
bearing spin also have different energies in a non-zero magnetic ﬁeld [91, 92, 114– 
123]. The NMR phenomena involves the resonance absorption or dispersion of a 
frequency range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz of electromagnetic ﬁeld 
(ν). The energy difference between the two states with the nuclear quantum number 
m = 1/2 and gyromagnetic relation gammais [2.2]:
nor mal uppe r Delta u
pper E equals h nu equals gamma left parenthesis h divided by 2 pi right parenthesis upper H 0
Chemical shift in the NMR spectra is due to shielding which is a barrier made of 
inner-shell electrons and it decreases the nucleus pull on the outer electrons [94, 95, 
114–123]. Electrons orbiting around the nucleus generates a small magnetic ﬁeld 
that opposes H0, and electrons are shielding the nucleus from H0. Due to addition 
of electron density, magnetic induction, or other effects chemical shift has been 
decreased. When an atom is deshielded, it means that nucleus chemical shift has been 
increased due to removal of electron density, magnetic induction, or other effects. 
The detected frequencies (in Hz) for 1H, 13C, 31P, 15N and 29Si nuclei are usually 
referenced against position of the NMR signal tetramethylsilane (TMS). Some of 
the most useful information for structure determination in a one-dimensional NMR 
spectrum comes from J-coupling or scalar spin–spin coupling between NMR active 
nuclei arises from the interaction of different spin states through the chemical bonds 
of a molecule and results in the splitting of NMR signals. Below are some typical 
examples illustrating the analytical application of NMR. 
The general Overhauser effect was ﬁrst predicted in 1953 by Albert Overhauser 
[96–99, 105–108] who observed that saturation of the conduction electron spin reso-
nance by microwave irradiation causes a polarization of nuclear spins. The nuclear 
Overhauser effect (NOE) is the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one popu-
lation of spin-active nuclei (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N etc.) to another via cross-relaxation 
induced by dipole-dipole interaction The change in the integrated intensity (positive 
or negative) of one NMR resonance occurs when another is saturated by irradiation 
with a radio frequency ﬁeld. For example, in a system consisting of two spins of

value 1/2, I and S, their spin components along the z-axis (parallel to the polarizing 
ﬁeld) are ‘up’ or ‘down’ are designated by corresponding eigenstates alphaand beta. In  
a system consisting of two spins of value 1/2, I and S, the four eigenstates of the 
system are alpha alpha, alpha betabeta alphaand beta betatake place. The transition probabilities per unit time 
between the states are W1I, W1S, W0 IS, and W2IS. 
Chemically induced spin correlated dynamic electron polarization (CIDEP) 
effects take place when the populations of the spin states deviate substantially from 
thermal equilibrium [100–104, 107–108]. Such an effect can arise in the electron 
spin system of reactive radicals generated as transient intermediates following the 
sudden initiation of chemical reactions, for example by a photochemical reaction. 
The main mechanisms causing spin polarization in free radicals are: the triplet mech-
anism (TM), the radical pair mechanism (RPM), the correlated coupled radical-pair 
mechanism (CRPM), the radical triplet pair mechanism (RTPM) and triplet-triplet 
annihilation mechanism (TTAM). 
2.4.2.2
Analytical Application of NMR 
Techniques for the correlation of 1H and 15N chemical shifts based on zero and 
double quantum NMR were developed [106, 114].15N has a high spectral resolution 
because of its broad chemical shift range (500−900 ppm). The sensitivity of 15N is  
1/1000th of that of 1H and 1/15th of that of 13C for equal numbers of nuclei at a 
constant ﬁeld. Proton-decoupling lead to the enhancement of the 15N signal by the 
nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) for 15N nuclei that relax via dipolar interaction 
with proton(s). The sensitivity of 15N detection is signiﬁcantly enhanced by indirect 
detection through coupled 1H by  1H-15N heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence 
(HMQC) transfer magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). HMQC allows the detec-
tion of low-concentration [5-15N]GLN in vivo and [15Nindole]serotonin in vitro. For  
example, HSQC makes it possible the detection of nmol quantities of [5-15N]GLN 
and [15N]urea in 40 μL of the extracellular ﬂuid [107, 115–116]. 
Glutamine synthetase is important for the glutamine/glutamate cycle in brain. 
Rates of Glutamine synthetase catalyzed reaction can be inferred from an isotope 
chase experiment [107]. In this approach, the magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS) measurement shows a steady state concentration of 15N-labeled glutamate 
while infusing a constant concentration of 15NH4Cl. Then the infusate was switched 
to 14NH4Cl and the exponential decline in (5-15N)glutamate signal was measured. In 
vivo 15N MRS at 4 or 7 Tesla has made a contribution to kinetic studies of the indi-
vidual pathways that control glutamate ﬂux in the rat brain [108, 115–116]. In this 
condition, glutamine synthetase activities, measuring at several levels of hyperam-
monemia, showed that this enzyme becomes saturated at blood ammonia concentra-
tion > 0.9 μmol/g, and causes the elevation of brain ammonia. [14N]LEU was replaced 
by [15N]LEU and the rate of GLU synthesis from LEU was monitored in vivo. The 
in vivo 15N spectra of the brain [5-15N]GLN were acquired during isotope chase 
by 14N (Fig. 2.24). A progressive decrease in the peak area was observed, as 15N 
is replaced by 14N while maintaining the total (i.e. 15N + 14N) concentration at a

reactions in a variety of living systems and in vivo of the ATP synthetase and the 
creatine kinase reactions, in particular [109, 117]. 
2.4.3 
Nitric Oxide Analysis by ESR 
Spin trapping is an analytical technique employed for the detection and identiﬁcation 
of short-lived free radicals through the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectroscopy [186]. When the half-life of radicals is too short to detect with EPR, 
compounds known as spin traps are used to react covalently with the radical products 
and form more stable adduct that will also spectra detectable by EPR spectroscopy. 
The most commonly used spin traps are alpha-phenyl N-tertiary-butyl nitrone (PBN) 
and 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) 
Below are some examples of the use of the method for the analysis of radicals of 
high chemical reactivity and diffusive mobility. A liposome-encapsulated spin-trap 
(LEST) method for the capture and in situ detection of NO by EPR was introduced 
[176, 186–190]. The method showed a linear response for left bracket upper N upper O right bracket greater than or equals 4 mu upper M and can

detect left brack et upper N upper O right bracket greater than or equals 40 nM in a 500 mu upper L sample (≥ 20 pmol) in real time over minutes to 
hours. LEST showed minimal abiotic NO production in the presence of nitrite and 
NADH. In addition, nitrate reductase-like activity was detected in cell lysates of the 
coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and was elevated in virus-infected culture. 
The
compound
5-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-(2-methylprop-1-en-
yl)cyclohex-4-ene-1,3-dione [188] 
has been proved to behave as an efﬁcient cheletropic trap for both NO and NO2 radi-
cals in the presence of oxygen, yielding EPR observable nitroxide and alkoxyni-
troxide, respectively [177, 188]. In the study [177, 188] the  in situ reaction of the 
aromatic spin trap 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzene sulfonate (DBNBS) 
with nitric oxide (NO), generated via the reduction of nitrite under acidic condi-
tions at room temperature, was examined [177, 187]. It was concluded that DBNBS 
is an efﬁcient nitric oxide scavenger that has the potential to 3,5-dibromo-4-
nitrosobenzenesulfonate (DBNBS) has been used in combination with EPR) spec-
trometry to trap nitric oxide [155, 189]. The reaction between DBNBS and NO yields 
a radical product which gives rise to an EPR signal consisting of three lines with a 
hyperﬁne splitting AN = 0.96 mT. Then the fractions containing the radical product 
were identiﬁed by the presence of the three-line EPR signal, and these fractions were 
analyzed by negative ion fast atom bombardment–mass spectrometry (FAB–MS).The 
data suggested that the radical product is bis(2,6-dibromo-4-sulfophenyl)nitroxyl

Microdialysis 
The most widely used in  vivo sampling method is microdialysis (Fig. 2.25), in which 
species, such as substrates and products, can diffuse through the semi-permeable 
membrane comprising the probe [135–141, 145–151]. Rapid sampling microdialysis 
(rsMD) is an enzyme-based electrochemical detection method, which is particularly 
suited to monitoring metabolism. In particular, the technique of microdialysis enables 
sampling and collecting of small-molecular-weight substances from the interstitial 
space. Microdialysis is a widely used method in neuroscience and permits quantiﬁca-
tion of neurotransmitters, peptides, and hormones in the behaving animal, Work [139, 
145] provided a brief review of the history of microdialysis and its general appli-
cation in the neurosciences including theoretical principles underlying the micro-
dialysis process. Several important aspects were discussed in details including: (1) 
Methods available for estimating extracellular concentration from dialysis samples, 
(2) The various factors that affect the estimate of in vivo relative recovery, (3) The 
importance of determining in vivo relative recovery to data interpretation; and (4) 
Impact of tissue trauma on the interpretation of microdialysis results. The principles 
and applications of microdialysis in preclinical and clinical settings, microdialysis 
as a tool in drug research and development were discussed. 
An enzyme-based electroanalysis system for real-time analysis of a clinical micro-
dialysis sampling stream during surgery was developed [137, 147]. Free ﬂap tissue 
transfer was used in reconstructive surgery after resection of tumours or in major 
trauma. Flap surgery is a technique in plastic and reconstructive surgery where 
any type of tissue is lifted from a donor site and moved to a recipient site with an 
intact blood supply. Rapid sampling microdialysis (rsMD) is an enzyme-based elec-
trochemical detection method, which is particularly suited to monitoring metabolism.

The experiment suggested that: (1) Online ﬂow injection system can analyze a 
dialysate ﬂow stream from an implanted microdialysis probe every 30 s for levels 
of glucose and lactate; (2) The technique can monitoring of free ﬂap reconstructive 
surgery, from ﬂap detachment to re-vascularisation and overnight in the intensive care 
unit; (3) The on-set of ischaemia was seen as an increase in lactate and decrease in 
glucose levels; and (4) Glucose levels returned to normal within 10 min of successful 
arterial anastomosis, whilst lactate took longer to clear. 
Soil extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) represents a critical bottleneck in the 
release of bioavailable nutrients from organic materials. The potential of in situ micro-
dialysis to directly sample extracellula soil enzymes, measuring their activity using 
a modiﬁed enzyme assay was explored [138, 148]. The following important results 
were reported: (1) The protease recovery is hindered at lower soil moisture contents; 
(2) The response of native protease activity after the addition of soybean litter to clay 
and sandy soils was measured; (3) Finding microdialysis was observed greater oil 
extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) in litter-amended treatments than controls in soil 
types; and (4) Hydrolytic enzyme activity of free and stabilized clay soil fractions 
were estimated. 
Work [139, 149] discussed the immune response resulting from microdial-
ysis probe implantation. The principles of microdialysis and the applications of 
Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic corticosteroid, 
were formulated. Microdialysis in (i) neuronal devices, (ii) dopamine and fast scan 
cyclic voltammetry, (iii) the attenuation of microglial cells, (iv) macrophage polariza-
tion states, and (v) spreading depolarizations was brieﬂy reviewed. Employing micro-
dialisis, it was shown how that the addition of dexamethasone, an anti-inﬂammatory 
drug, to the perfusion ﬂuid protects evoked dopamine responses as measured by fast-
scan cyclic voltammetry next to the probes after 24 h [141, 151]. It was found that 
that dexamethasone stabilizes evoked dopamine responses measured at the probe 
outlet over a 4–24 h postimplantation interval.

Nitric Oxide Analysis 
2.6.1 
Introduction 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a tiny molecule with enormous biological impart [129, 133, 142– 
145], [147–189]. Nitric oxide (NO) is essential in a signiﬁcant number of vital normal 
and pathological physiological processes. Nowadays, a whole arsenal of chem-
ical, physical and biological methods spanning the NO picomolar-to-micromolar 
concentration range in physiological milieus has been developed and widely used 
(Fig. 2.26) The spectroscopic and electrochemical methods described above are 
the most commonly employed techniques for measuring NO. Other less frequently 
employed approaches include mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 
quantum cascade infrared laser spectroscopy, mechatronics sensoring, and quartz 
crystal microbalance technique also have been developed/. Nevertheless, real-time 
monitoring of NO dynamics under physiological conditions of nano and less molar 
concentrations is still a challenging analytical problem. This has been attributed to 
the labile nature of NO molecule with half-life of the order of seconds, which both 
rapidly diffuses through the medium and readily reacts with many scavenger targets. 
Because of its simplicity, availability and the intense color of an adduct, optical 
spectroscopy for a long time served as main practical tools for nitrite and NO 
analysis in chemistry and biology [129, 142–145, 147–189]. The Peter Griess 
diazotization reaction on which the Griess reagent N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine 
dihydrochloride [154]

and its modiﬁcation can be used for an indirect assay of nitric oxide [129, 143, 
144, 152–158]. Nowadays, Sigma-Aldrich sells this compound. In transition metal 
proteins assay, since oxyhemoglobin (Hb) has a high afﬁnity for NO and upon 
binding is converted quantitatively to methemoglobin (MetHb). spectrophotometric 
determination of nitric oxide using hemoglobin was employed for analysis of NO 
concentrations between 300 nM and 30 M [146]m. 
2.6.2 
NO Luminescence Analysis 
In recent years, ﬂuorescent methods have been increasingly used due to its sensitivity 
from mM up to a single molecule and is widely available for routine analysis and 
precision investigations, and therefore, gains many advantages over other physical 
methods used in biology and medicine [147–150, 159–177]. 
Classical ﬂuorophores such as anthracene, coumarin, are routinely employed in 
biology for analysis of small molecules [151–157, 159, 160]. In the last decades, 
a number new advance non-cytotoxic water soluble and membrane permeable 
probes including two-photon ﬂuorophores, excitable at low-energy wavelengths were 
synthesized and investigated employing advanced spectroscopic techniques. One of 
the general basis of methods for NO analyses is the conversion of a ﬂuorescence 
silent probe to a compound of high ﬂuorescent quantum yield [151, 163]. 
A water-soluble, biocompatible, small molecular probe o-phenylenediamine-Phe-
Phe-OH (1) for the highly selective and sensitive detection of NO in vitro and in 
living cells was designed [150, 162]. The compound can react with NO and turn 
on the ﬂuorescence emission at 367 nm via an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) 
mechanism. In PBS buffer, 1 was applied for detecting NO within the range of

ﬂuorophore led to a probe that displays a very high sensitivity to NO concentrations 
down to the low nM range and a high speciﬁcity to NO while being insensitive 
to other oxidative oxygen/nitrogen species that often interfere with the sensing of 
NO [155, 167]. Nitric oxide turn-on ﬂuorescent probe based on deamination of 
aromatic primary monoamines was designed [156, 168]. The stable, water-soluble, 
and nonﬂuorescent FA-OMe 
can sense nitric oxide (NO) and form the intensely ﬂuorescent product dA-FA-OMe 
via reductive deamination of the aromatic primary amine. The reaction was accom-
panied by an notable increase of the ﬂuorescent quantum yield from 1.5 to 88.8%. 
The selectivity study indicated that FA-OMe had high speciﬁcity for NO oversome 
other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. By connection of O6-benzylguanine (BG) to 
an “o-phenylenediamine-locked” rhodamine spirolactam responsive to nitric oxide 
(NO), a novel locked” rhodamine spirolactam 
responsive to nitric oxide (NO), a novel substrate (TMR-NO-BG) of genetically 
encoded SNAP-tag has been constructed [157, 169]. In living cells, labeling SNAP-
tag fused proteins with TMR-NO-BG will insitu generate corresponding probe– 
protein conjugates (TMR-NO-SNAP). The labeling inherited high NO sensitivity 
from the small-molecule parent and guaranteed the site-speciﬁcity. 
Of particular interest is the analysis of nitric oxide at single cell levels. In review 
[159, 171], three categories of analytical techniques enabling NO detection at single 
cell levels, namely, ﬂuorescence microscopy, capillary electrophoresis with laser 
induced ﬂuorescence detection, and electrochemistry were utilized. The correspon-
dent basic principles, performance, applications, ﬁgures of merits and limitations 
were considered. The probe, FP-NO was prepared by incorporating a recognition 
unit, thiosemicarbazide moiety into a coumarin ﬂuorophore [160, 172]. The weakly 
ﬂuorescent FP-NO quickly and selectively reacts with NO to form a highly ﬂuores-
cent product, FP-P. with the detection limit of 47.6 nM. The feasibility of FP-NO as

the ﬂuorescence probe for imaging and ﬂow cytometry analysis of exogenous NO in 
MCF-7 cells and exogenous NO production in inﬂamed J774A was demonstrated. 
Visualization of exogenous and endogenous NO production in live zebraﬁsh was then 
achieved. A family of cysteine analogues tagged with ﬂuorophores for visualizing 
cellular NO dynamics 
was designed [161, 173]. Biocompatible probes 1a and 2a were found to switch 
between their original ﬂuorescent state and quenched S-nitrosated state in response 
to cellular NO dynamics. The probes were utilized to tracking NO ﬂuctuations in 
activated murine macrophages in response to an anti-inﬂammatory agent treatment. 
The authors concluded that probes 1a and 2a will afford promising tools for studying 
NO pathophysiology by tracking its dynamics in health and disease. 
The review [162, 174] focused on organic small-molecule ﬂuorescent probes 
for selective detection and imaging of endogenous NO in vitro and in vivo. The 
progress of ﬂuorescence imaging for real-time detection of NO in biological system 
was described. Due to practically unlimited variety of structures and properties, 
organometal-based ﬂuorescent probes provide for new possibilities in the ﬁeld [163, 
175]. As an example, copper(II) complex CuRBT with a ring-closed rhodamine-
containing tripodal ligand was synthesized. This highly selective ﬂuorescent imaging 
agent for nitric oxide featured a 700-fold ﬂuorescent enhancement toward NO from 
a dark-background with the detection limit of NO about 1 nM in aqueous solution 
and could be applied for monitoring intracellular NO. Nitric oxide can be detected 
in the gas phase by the chemiluminescence of its reaction with ozone [166]. The 
absolute intensity and quenching constants of the NO2 emission in the chemilu-
minescent reaction between nitric oxide and ozone have been determined using a 
large capacity-ﬂow reactor at low pressures. These studies revealed the following 
(1) The mechanism proposed is NO + O3= NO* 2(2B1) + O2(1a) NO  + O3 = 
NO2(2A1) + O2(1b) NO* 2 = NO2 + hv(2) M + NO2= NO2 + M; (2) The rate

A new highly sensitive chemiluminescence approach to direct NO detection 
in aqueous solutions using a natural nitric oxide target, soluble guanylyl cyclase 
(sGC) was introduced [164, 176]. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of guano-
sine triphosphate to guanosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate and inorganic pyrophos-
phate. The suggested enzymatic assay based on the fact that the rate of the reaction 
increases by about 200 times when NO binds with sGC. The assay provided a sensor 
for nitric oxide luminescent detection of the above reaction which is accomplished 
by converting inorganic pyrophosphate into ATP with the help of ATP sulfury-
lase followed by light emission from ATP-dependent luciferin-luciferase reaction 
(Fig. 2.27). Measurement of NO generated by a nitric oxide donor (PAPA-NONOate), 
nitric oxide synthase, and NO gas dissolved in buffer was performed. The method 
allowed for the measurement of NO concentrations in the nanomolar range and NO 
generation rates as low as 100 pM/min. Luciferyl adenylate singlet-excited singlet 
state emits light upon relaxation to its ground state. For example, yellow-green light

The method of NO assay developed in [165, 177] was based on the reaction 
catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), whose product 
is used as a substrate for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), generating adenosine 
5’-triphosphate (ATP), which is a cofactor for the ﬁreﬂy luciferase bioluminescent 
reaction. The experiment indicated that the range from 10 to 100 nM of ˙NO, with 
limits of detection and quantitation of 4 and 15 nM, respectively can be detected.

Nitric Oxide Analysis by Electrochemistry 
bullet Electrochemistry studies chemical electrochemical techniques, cyclic voltam-
metry and amperometry, together with ﬂuorescence, are one of the most sensitive 
and commonly employed analytical method for monitoring nitric oxide. Real-time 
monitoring, ability to high-spatial resolution, wide variation of electrodes mate-
rials and its modiﬁcation to enhance selectivity and sensitivity provide speciﬁc 
advantages [168–174, 178–186]. A review [168–179] described the development 
of electrochemical sensors for NO, including the fabrication of sensors, the detec-
tion principle, calibration, detection limits, selectivity, and response time. The NO 
selective electrodes had the many experimental applications to measure physio-
logical levels of NO in vitro, in vivo, and in real time. In work [169, 180], a 
dual amperometric/potentiometric microsensor for sensing nitric oxide (NO) and 
potassium ion (K+) was developed. The dual NO/K+ sensor was prepared based on 
a dual recessed electrode possessing Pt (diameter, 50 μm) and Ag (diameter, 76.2 
μm) microdisks. The Pt disk surface (WE1) was modiﬁed with electroplatiniza-
tion and the following coating with ﬂuorinated xerogel; and the Ag disk surface 
(WE2) was oxidized to AgCl on which K+ ion selective membrane was loaded. 
The dual microsensor was employed for amperometric sensing of NO (106 ± 28 
pA μM–1, n  = 10, at +0.85 V applied vs Ag/AgCl) and for potentiometric sensing 
of K+ (51.6 ± 1.9 mV pK–1, n  = 10), respectively, with high sensitivity and good 
selectivity. The sensor was applied for the simultaneous monitoring of NO and 
K+ changes in a living rat brain cortex . It was indicated the dual NO/K+ sensor’s 
measurements well reﬂect membrane potential changes of neurons and associated 
cellular components of neurovascular coupling. 
Remarkable advances of electrochemical techniques were in full extend demon-
strated in [170, 178]. A sensor for real time monitoring nitric oxide based on hemin-
functionalized graphene ﬁeld-effect transistors with single atom thickness, and the 
highest carrier mobility a sub-nanomolar sensitivity was designed (Fig. 2.28). Exper-
iments indicated that the graphene–hemin sensors can rapidly and selectively respond 
to NO in physiological solutions with a sub-nanomolar sensitivity, and can be used 
for real-time monitoring of NO released from macrophage cells and endothelial cells 
(ECs).

Nitric Oxide Analysis Based on Utilization of Dual 
Fluorescent-Nitroxide Probes 
Although a variety of methods for NO detection have been proposed, they are not 
generally amenable to real-time measurement of endogenous NO in situ. In recent 
decades, a series of new ﬂuorescent methods for the analysis of NO have been 
proposed and developed [27–35, 27–38,179–181, 191–193]: (1) Dual ﬂuorescent-

nitroxide probes analysis (DFNPA), (2) Fluorescence inductive-resonance method 
of analysis (FIRMA 1, FIRMA 2, FIRMA 3); (3) Fluorescence inductive-resonance 
cascade method of analysis (FIRCMA) and (4) Fluorescence spin exchange method 
of analysis (FSEMA). This approach of detection of nitric oxide was based on 
the phenomenon of the intramolecular ﬂuorescence quenching of the ﬂuorophore 
fragment by the nitroxide in a dual ﬂuorescent- nitroxide supermolecule [36]. 
A nitronyl nitroxide radical covalently linked to an organic ﬂuorophore, pyrene, 
was used to detect nitric oxide (NO) from from pig trachea epithelia [31]. This 
approach is based on the phenomenon of the intramolecular ﬂuorescence quenching 
of the ﬂuorophore fragment by the nitroxide. The pyrene-nitronyl (PN) reacts with 
NO to yield a pyrene-imino nitroxide radical (PI) and NO2. The transformation of the 
EPR signal was accompanied by an increase in the ﬂuorescence intensity since the 
imino nitroxide radical is a weaker quencher than the nitronyl. The results indicated 
that the ﬂuorescence measurements enable detection of nanomolar concentrations 
of NO compared to a sensitivity threshold of only several micromolar for the EPR 
technique. The measured basal ﬂux of S-nitroso compounds obtained in pig trachea 
was about 1.2 nmol/g × min, and NO-synthase stimulated by extracellular adenosine 
5
′-triphosphate produced NO ﬂux of 0.9 nmol/g × min. 
A novel assay was developed for the measurement of nitric oxide in nanoscale 
concentration [179–181], [27–38, 191–193]:. Suggested ﬂuorescence inductive-
resonance method of analysis (FIRMA 1).is based on phenomena of the singlet-
singlet energy transfer by inductive resonance mechanism, due to the dipole-dipole 
interaction between excited ﬂuorescent donor (D*) and nonexcited acceptor (A) 
[182]. A donor acceptor pair, in which the donor is a ﬂuorophore (stilbene label 
4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene- 2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS)

tethered to myoglobin Fig. 2.29 in exited singlet state and acceptor is a nitric oxide 
trap (hemin), was constructed [27, 28, 31, 33, 35, 36, 45, 179, 180]. Hemin was 
chosen due to its very fast reaction with NO and the high stability of the resulting 
complex. According to the Fӧrster theory, efﬁciency of the process depends on the 
distance between the donor and acceptor and the value of overlap of the donor ﬂuo-
rescent and the acceptor spectra. Obviously, trapping NO by the hemin Fe2+ will 
lead to a change in absorption spectrum and, in consequence of this, to change of 
the overlap integral and the intensity of ﬂuorescence. The rapid trapping of NO by 
myoglobin results in the change of the absorbance of myoglobin, which causes the 
change of both the absorbance–ﬂuorescence overlap integral value and the ﬂuores-
cence intensity of myoglobin–STIS. The change in emission intensity of the stilbene 
fragment versus an increasing concentration of NO precursors clearly demonstrated 
the method availability to monitor the formation of a heme–NO complex in a concen-
tration range from 10 nM to mu minus upper M . For example, the measured NO ﬂux in tissue 
sample from rabbit trachea epithelia and porcine trachea epithelia was found to be 
tilde 7.9 time s 10 S uper scri pt neg ative 12  Basel ine mol slash s times g and tilde 3.0 times 10 Superscript negative 12 Baseline mol slash s times g respectively. It is necessary 
to stress that titration of deoxyMb–SITS at low NO concentration left par enthesis 0.05 mu upper M right parenthesis commacan be 
carried out only by the ﬂuorescence technique: at low concentrations in the 10–500 
nM range, the ﬂuorescence method is still highly sensitive. Another version of the 
FIRMA 1 is to create a supermolecule consisting of a donor (exited stilbene or excited 
CdSe quantum dots for example) and an acceptor (hemin) separated by a rigid bridge 
at the optimum distance for energy transfer (FIRMA 2). The third version (FIRMA 
3) is a system consisting of acceptor molecules (hemin) surrounded at an optimal 
distance by ﬂuorescent molecules Fig. 2.30 [180], [192, 193].
Figure 2.30 illustrates schematically two donor -acceptor (D-A) models, having a 
ﬂuorescent chromophore (stilbene derivative for example) as a donor and hemin as an 
acceptor, with direct D-A energy transfer and transfer via a light harvesting antenna, 
correspondingly. The latter is an analog of the photosynthetic light harvesting 
antenna.
Fluorescence spin exchange method of analysis (FSEMA) [180, 192, 193] is  
based on measuring the difference in efﬁciency of spin exchange (electron transfer, 
intersystem crossing) in supermolecules, consisting of NO trap (hemin Fe2+) and 
a ﬂuorophore, by detecting ﬂuorescence in absent and present NO. Binding of NO 
by the trap fragment should inﬂuence on efﬁciency of the spin exchange between 
excited ﬂuorophore and the nitryl complex and, as consequence, on the ﬂuorescence 
intensity. In the frame of this conception, supermolecules composed with acceptor

Calorimetry 
Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat transferred to or from a substance. 
The temperature change measured by the calibrated calorimeter is used to derive the 
amount of heat transferred by the process under study [183–193], [195–205]. The 
basic principle of Isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) is the direct measurement of 
the enthalpy change for a bimolecular binding interaction at a constant temperature 
(Fig. 2.31). This technique measures the heat released or absorbed over time, being 
convenient methodology to quantify the amount of reacting molecules such as the 
binding thermodynamics, as well as to measure the reaction rate. As an example [183, 
195] this method was applied to determine k Sub scri pt cat Baseline and upper K Subscript upper M Baseline of the enzymatic hydrolysis 
of urea by Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) urease and calculation of intrinsic molar 
enthalpy (ΔHint) of the reaction was performed. 
Isothermal titration calorimetry instruments measure in real time the thermal power 
that results when one solution (in a syringe) is titrated into another (in a sample 
cell), as illustrated in Fig. 2.31 [184, 196]. A pair of cells, typically coin-shaped 
or cylindrical with volumes on the order of 200–1,400 μL, are termed the sample

where nS is the number of moles of substrate injected. In a multiple injection ITC 
enzyme kinetic assay, the enzyme concentration is chosen to be sufﬁciently low 
so that substrate depletion during the experiment is negligible but high enough to 
provide good signal [186, 198]. Thus, it is possible to calculate enzyme velocity at 
any point in the experiment, provided ΔrH and V cell are known. These values can be 
obtained after injecting a known amount of substrate into a sample cell containing 
sufﬁcient enzyme to rapidly convert it entirely to product, 
Exothermic and endothermic reactions give descending and ascending steps, 
respectively, if the raw feedback power is plotted as a function of time. 
Human soluble epoxide hydrolase is a bifunctional enzyme composed of two 
structurally and functionally independent domains. The C-terminal domain (CTD) 
is responsible for the hydrolysis of numerous epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs) [193, 205]. 
To probe the kinetics of EpFA hydrolysis catalyzed by hsEH CTD, an ITC single-
injection method (SIM) was employed [186, 198]. The kinetic results is summarized 
in Table 2.1. A variant of the single-injection ITC method was applied for the detailed 
description of the enzyme inhibition,

Mass Spectrometry-Based Methods 
Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-
to-charge ratio of ions [2002−2006] [206–208]. The results are presented as a mass 
spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra 
are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses 
of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of 
molecules. In a typical MS procedure, a sample was ionized by bombarding with 
a beam of electrons to break up the sample into positively charged fragments or 
simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions are then sepa-
rated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, by accelerating them using ion-spray 
and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic ﬁeld. Mass spectrometry is a rapid, 
sensitive, and accurate quantitative approach for the direct monitoring of enzyme-
catalyzed reactions that does not require a chromophore or radiolabeling and thus 
provides a viable alternative to existing analytical Review [206], was intended to 
know how mass spectrometry for studying enzymes activity has progressed in prod-
ucts of enzyme reaction detection to quantitative measures of enzyme activity and 
kinetics. The technique can be served as a tool for rapidly screening inhibitory 
compounds as an alternative to current methods of high throughput drug screening. 
The utility of small- and large-molecule mass spectrometry to reveal enzyme interme-
diates of acetyl transferases, sulfonucleotide reducatases, and phosphoenolpyruvate 
PEP-utilizing enzymes and illuminate mechanism was described in details in review 
[195, 206]. 
Use of mass spectrometry coupled with High Performance Liquid Chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) for the kinetic analysis of enzymatic reactions in real time was 
reported [196, 206]. The hydrolysis of dinucleotides with bovine pancreatic ribonu-
clease A (RNase A) and the substrate-speciﬁc hydrolysis of lactose with beta-
galactosidase were monitored employing ion-spray (pneumatically assisted elec-
trospray) mass spectrometry. The resulting data can be used to calculate both KM 
and V maxfor system under interest. The proteolysis of intact viral capsid proteins, the 
alpha-glucosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-glucopyranoside

and the lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed ester hydrolysis of resoruﬁn were examined [197, 
206]. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ioniza-
tion (ESI) mass spectrometry were used to monitor the proteolysis of viral protein 
capsids and the hydrolysis of small molecules with a-glucosidase and bovine lipopro-
tein lipase. MALDI methodology is a several -step process: (1) The sample is mixed 
with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate; (2) A pulsed laser irra-
diates the sample, triggering desorption of the sample and matrix; (3) The analyte 
molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of 
ablated gases; and (4) Then they can be accelerated into whichever mass spectrom-
eter is used to analyse them. The MALDI experiments provided information about 
capsid (a protein shell of virus) dynamics and the stabilizing force of viral protein/ 
RNA interactions. The kinetic of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyla-glucopyranoside , 
catalyzed by a-glucosidase to produce p-nitrophenolate and glucose was examined 
by ESI-MS and UV-visible spectroscopy. The kinetic parameters obtained by ESI-
MS are kcat =256 min−1 and Km = 0.535 mM. The kinetics of bovine lipoprotein 
lipase were also monitored with ESI-MS by determining the response of the sodium 
adducts of 1,2-O-dilauryl-rac-glycerol 5, and 1,2-O-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric 
acid [197]. 
Figure 2.32 [198, 206] illustrates the principle underlying the DESI-MS method 
for online measurement of enzymatic reaction kinetics, namely: (1) enzyme and 
substrate solutions undergo mixing in a micro-Tee mixer that is connected with a 
short piece of silica capillary to serve as a microreactor for reaction; (2) After exiting 
the microreactor capillary, the reaction mixture is directly ionized by DESI for MS 
detection; and (3) The reaction time can be varied by changing injection ﬂow rates 
of enzyme and substrate solutions. 
Study [198, 207] described a new approach for online measuring enzymatic reac-
tion kinetics using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-
MS). By using DESI-MS, enzymatic reaction products in a buffered aqueous

media could be directly detected [2006]. Enzymatic reactions examined in this 
study include hydrolysis of 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside by β-galactosidase 
and hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. Derived Michaelis–Menten 
constants Km for these two reactions were determined to be 214 μM and 172 μM, 
respectively, which are in good agreement with the values of 300 μM and 230 
μM reported in literature, validating the DESI-MS approach. This time-resolved 
DESI-MS also allowed to deter Km and turnover number kcat for trypsin digestion of 
angiotensin II (Km and kcat are determined to be 6.4 mM and 1.3 s–1, respectively). 
Peptide hydrolysis was studied in situ by incubating tissues with substrate with 
or without inhibitor. MALDI-TOF is used to detect substrate and hydrolysis product 
ions which can be used to create a map of enzyme activity [199, 207]. 3-Deoxy-d-
manno-2-octulosonate-8-phosphate 
bullet (KDO8P) synthase catalyzes the ﬁrst step of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, 
namely condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with arabinose 5-phosphate 
(A5P), to produce KDO8P [200, 208]. To detect an intermediate in the KDO8P 
synthase reaction, time-resolved ESI-MS TOF (Fig. 2.32) was utilized 
Time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) is a method of mass spectrometry in 
which an ion’s mass-to-charge ratio is determined by a time of ﬂight measurement. 
This time will depend on the velocity of the ion, and therefore is a measure of its 
mass-to-charge ratio. The principle working hypotheses of the rapid mixing, time-
resolved ESI technique are: (1) A computer-controlled stepping motor or syringe 
pump allows the precise control of the speed at which the solutions of enzyme and 
substrate are mixed; (2) The enzyme and substrates come together in a mixing tee 
that has a short fused silica capillary column on the outlet; (3) The capillary leads 
directly to the needle of the electrospray unit in the mass spectrometer; and (4) There 
is a high voltage on the needle of electrospray unit that disperses the solution coming 
through the capillary into small particles for nebulization. The catalytic reaction of 
KDO8PS with its natural substrates, PEP 
and A5P, was examined under single enzyme turnover conditions by rapidly mixing 
the EÆPEP solution with a limiting amount of the second substrate, A5P. The reaction 
was monitored over several time ranges (7–160 ms) (Fig. 2.33 and 2.34).

Chapter 3 
Methods of Enzyme Kinetics 
Abstract The main goals of studying the kinetics of enzymatic processes are to 
establish their elementary mechanisms, namely, the succession and rate of inter-
mediate of elementary stages as well as their chemical nature. To determine the 
parameters of the Michaelis–Menton equation, a whole arsenal of classical and 
modern physical methods described in Chap. 2 is used. In parallel, the following 
groups of methods are also successfully applied: (1) Continuous ﬂow, temperature, 
pH and pressure jumps, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), artiﬁcial intermediates, and 
transition state analogs methods. Of particular importance are theoretical compu-
tation approaches. Foundation of these approaches, combined quantum mechanics/ 
molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods in computational enzymology, in partic-
ular, and examples illustrated theoretical approaches are subject of consideration in 
separate sections. 
3.1 
Introduction 
In the service of enzymatic kinetics, there is a whole arsenal of classical and modern 
methods that make it possible to determine the parameters of the Michaelis–Menton 
equation, establish the nature of intermediate compounds and the detailed mechanism 
of the processes under study. Among the most widely used methods are ﬂow and 
jump techniques, mass spectrometry, kinetic isotope effect (KEF), approaches based 
on the use of artiﬁcial analogues of transition state, intermediates and substrates, and 
mechanical dynamics and quantum mechanical computations [1–24]. The following 
classiﬁcation of ﬂow strategies has been accepted [8]: (1) Continuous ﬂow involves 
non-stopped ﬂow; (2) Stopped ﬂow involves physically stopping the product zone for 
a period of time before online detection; (3) Quench ﬂow involves both physically and 
chemically stopping the product zone and with ofﬂine detection; (4) Merging zones/ 
bypass ﬂow requires a manifold that can change the ﬂow direction to selectively 
deliver only a certain part of the product zone to the detector; and (5) Air segmented 
ﬂow employs small air segments between each solution bolus to prevent early mixing. 
Advantages and disadvantages of these different ﬂow strategies were discussed. In the

case of temperature, pH and pressure jumps, the perturbation involves rapid heating, 
acidity and pressure which changes the value of the equilibrium constant, followed 
by relaxation to equilibrium at the given condition. Transition state (TS) analogues, 
are chemical compounds with a chemical structure that resembles the transition state 
of a substrate molecule in an enzyme-catalyzed chemical reaction 
3.2 
Artiﬁcial Intermediates 
Many enzymatic reactions, including those of serine hydrolases and cysteine 
proteases, proceed via the formation of an unstable acyl-enzyme intermediate. Their 
acyl-enzyme intermediates are unstable, commonly having half-lives of minutes to 
hours. In some cases, acyl-enzyme complexes can be stabilized using substrate 
analogues or active site mutations [1]. For example, a new strategy for incorpo-
rating 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (DAP) into recombinant proteins, via expansion of 
the genetic code was developed [3]. Replacing catalytic cysteine or serine residues 
of enzymes with DAP permitted their ﬁrst-step reaction with native substrates, 
allowing the efﬁcient capture of acyl-enzyme complexes that are linked through 
a stable amide bond. A strategy for creating mechanism-based, light-activated 
serine or cysteine nucleophile protease and hydrolase substrate traps in complex 
mixtures and live mammalian cells was recently developed [4]. The research 
proceeds in several steps: (1) The genetically encoded, site-speciﬁc incorporation of 
photocaged Dap ((2S)-2-amino-3-{[(2-{[1-(6-nitrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)ethyl] 
thio}ethoxy)carbonyl]amino}propanoic acid) (pc-Dap) into proteins expressed 
in Escherichia coli; (2) pc-Dap was converted to Dap (2,3-diaminopropionic acid) 
in proteins in vitro by illuminating puriﬁed proteins; and (3) The obtained system 
was incubated for up to 2 days at pH 8; 4) By incubating puriﬁed proteases or 
thioesterases in which the catalytic cysteine or serine was replaced with Dap; (4) 
Replacing the catalytic nucleophile with genetically encoded 2,3-diaminopropionic 
acid allowed the ﬁrst-step reaction to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which a 
substrate fragment is covalently linked to the enzyme through a stable amide bond. 
Review [2] summarized published trapping studies and their biological outcomes. 
It was demonstrated that in vivo trapping allows systematic identiﬁcation of potential 
substrates of proteases, their adaptors, and chaperones. This approach combines 
in vivo genetic modiﬁcations of proteolytic systems, stabilized protease-substrate

interactions, afﬁnity enrichments of trapped substrates, and mass spectrometry (MS)-
based identiﬁcation. In vitro approaches, immobilized protease components were 
incubated with isolated cellular proteome, complement this in vivo approach. 
3.3 
Jump Methods [10–30] 
Simple continuous ﬂow (Figs. 3.1 and 3.2) has been applied to automate enzyme 
kinetic studies [6]. In the stopped ﬂow injection technique, the ﬂow of solution in 
the tubing can be stopped for a desired period of time by stopping the pump. The 
reaction time can be prolonged and the progress of the stopped reaction zone can be 
continuously monitored over time. 
By using the automatic ﬂow-based analytical systems, enzyme kinetics studies 
can be carried out at real-time initial rate [8]. The ﬂow-based systems have been 
developed to provide rapid, low-volume, and high-precision analyses (Fig. 3.2). 
Quench ﬂow technique is based on a similar idea to the stopped ﬂow technique 
[17]. The difference is that in the stopped ﬂow technique, one reaction mixture 
stays in the system for continuous monitoring of change with time. More than 
one reaction mixture is needed to be introduced into the part of the system. As an 
example, the catalytic mechanism of 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonate-8-phosphate 
(Kdo8P) synthase from Escherichia coli was investigated under pre-steady state 
conditions using rapid chemical quench ﬂow methods. The reaction was terminated 
by quenching with 0.2 N KOH at 15 °C. The results suggest the formation of acyclic 
bisphosphate as a reaction intermediate. 
Zone trapping/merging zones) technique or Bypass zone trapping ﬂow injection 
analysis (ByT-FAS) was introduced with similar principle to stopped ﬂow technique 
[18]. The technique ensures that the part of the sample/reagent plug being measured 
had reached physical steady state and had not been affected by laminar ﬂow and 
dispersion. This is done by controlling the sample size to be sufﬁciently large and by 
arranging the ﬂow manifold in such a way that the plug of mixture contains a portion 
of physical steady state. Only the steady state portion is detected. Flow injection

analysis (FIA) is accomplished by injecting a plug of sample into a ﬂowing carrier 
stream [8, 9]. Flow-based analysis system (FIA) is based on dispersion of sample and 
reagent solutions in small tubing by ﬂowing and merging them together. The process 
includes the following stages: (1) Product is formed while the merged solutions are 
ﬂowing into the detector; (2) Special ﬂow-through-cells are made for continuous ﬂow 
of solution into and out of the detector; and (3) This enables ﬂow injection analysis-
based systems to couple with various types of detectors (e.g., electrochemical, mass 
spectrometry, chemiluminescence, visible absorption, ﬂuorescence [16–19]. 
A sequential injection-Lab-at-valve (SI-LAV) segmented ﬂow system for kinetic 
study of an enzyme was introduced for separation of enzyme and substrate zones and 
separation of the stacked zones from the carrier solution [19, 20]. As an example, 
the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) kinetic 
parameters based on initial rate was used as a model study. TMB can act as a hydrogen 
donor for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water by horseradish peroxidase. The 
operation of the system was the conventional batch-wise process in which a group 
of identical products are produced simultaneously). The SI-LAV system (Fig. 3.3) is  
composed of a bidirectional syringe pump, a holding coil (PTFE tubing of 350 cm 
in length and 0.03” ID), a 10 port selection valve, and a mixing chamber made of a 
small glass dropper of approximately 7.5 cm in length and 8 mm in diameter, directly 
connected to one of the selection ports of the multi-selection valve. The volume of 
solutions to be put into the chamber can be varied up to 3.5 mL. Enzyme HRP (10 mL), 
TMB (235 mL) and H2O2 were mixed in a quartz micro-cuvette 580 L of 10 mm

pathlength. The cuvette was placed into the UV1800 UV-VIS spectrophotometer 
which was set at kinetic mode. Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum velocity 
(V max) were considered from the Michaelis–Menten plot and Lineweaver–Burk plot 
and were tabulated (Table 3.1).

horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) reaction [19]. 
In the case of temperature jump, the perturbation involves rapid heating which 
changes the value of the equilibrium constant, followed by relaxation to equilibrium at 
the new temperature [20–28]. The heating usually involves discharging of a capacitor, 
a device that stores electrical energy in an electric ﬁeld (in the kV range) or heating by 
the output of a pulsed laser which emits in the near infra-red. For example, a method 
for generating optical control of enzyme activity based on short laser pulses as optical 
“switches,” introducing an instantaneous change of the pH-value for activation of 
protein function, was developed [20, 21]. A proton release from 2-nitrobenzaldehyde 
was introduced to yield a pH-jump of almost 3 units on switching from inactive to 
active conditions for the enzyme. Following this change in pH-value, an activation

of hydrolytic activity of acid phosphatase (a nonspeciﬁc phosphomonoesterase) was 
occurred. The overall reaction of the enzyme was divided into two steps, namely, 
the pH-jump generation and the enzymatic reaction system. The kinetic data for 
the substrate 6-chloro-8-ﬂuoro-4-methylumbelliferone phosphate were determined. 
Thus, in this study, a photoswitch the activity of a hydrolytic enzyme by applying a 
laser-induced pH-jump to a complex mixture of enzyme, substrate, and phototrigger 
was taken place (Fig. 3.4). 
For generation of the light-induced pH-jump, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (2-NBA) was 
chosen [23, 24]. Intramolecular rearrangement of 2-NBA led to fast formation of 
nitrosobenzoic acid, a weak acid (pKa ≈ 3.54) which acts as proton emitter within 
the nanosecond range. Excitation at 388 nm for about 250 ms resulted in to a jump in 
pH of approximately 2 − 3 pH-units. A stable pH-value is given for more than 30 s 
after excitation. As a result of the enzymes pH proﬁle, this laser-induced pH-jump led

ment of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (2-NBA) to 2-nitrosobenzoic acid (2-NBS) causes a proton release 
and a strong change in pH. As a consequence of the enzymatic pH-proﬁle an activation of hydrolytic 
activity is achieved and enzymatic conversion of 6-chloro-8-ﬂuoro-4-methylumbelliferone phos-
phate (CF-MUP) to 6-chloro-8-ﬂuoro-4-methylumbelliferone (CF-MU) is switched on [20, 21].

photoswitching of acid phosphatase activity with 6-chloro-8- ﬂuoro methylumbellif-
erone phosphate (CF-MUP) as substrate. The enzymatic conversion was monitored 
by red-shifted to the absorption maximum of CF-MU at 370 nm. Using temperature 
and pressure jump methods, kinetic resolution of a conformational transition and 
the ATP hydrolysis step in a Dictyostelium myosin II mutant containing a single 
tryptophan residue were investigated [25, 26]. The experiment indicated that: (1) 
The initial binding process was accompanied by a small quench in ﬂuorescence; (2) 
This is followed by a large ﬂuorescence enhancement that appears coincident with 
the hydrolysis step; (3) The enhancement corresponds to the open-closed transition 
(k(obs) approximately 1000 s−1at 20 °C; (4) The is largely in the open state; and (5) 
Pressure jump during steady-state ATP turnover reveals the distinct transients for the 
rapid open-closed transition and the slower hydrolysis step. 
Temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on 
a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A were performed [26, 28]. It was found that 
cyclophilin A displays rich functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the 
microsecond timescale following a temperature jump. The resulting time-resolved 
signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes was measured. Two relax-
ation processes were resolved: a fast process is related to surface loop motions, and 
a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for 
catalytic turnover. A new constructed temperature-jump/stopped-ﬂow apparatus was 
a redesigned [27, 28]. The apparatus was capable of mixing the reactants on a submil-
lisecond timescale concomitant with a temperature-jump as large as 60 °C (Fig. 3.5). 
Importantly that it was possible to study enzyme reactions that are faster than the 
denaturation and process can be investigated above denaturation temperatures. The 
temperature-jump/stopped-ﬂow enables to investigate at physiological temperature 
the mechanisms of many enzymes, which was impossible until now because of their 
heat instability.
A schematic view of the temperature-jump/stopped-ﬂow instrument is presented 
in Fig. 3.5. Temperature calibration of the heating elements (A) and determination 
of the dead time of the temperature-jump/stopped-ﬂow apparatus (B) are shown in 
Fig. 3.6 [28].

Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) 
A kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is the change in the reaction rate of a chemical reac-
tion when one of the atoms in the reactants is replaced by one of its isotopes [29–60, 
31–57]. Quantitatively, KIE is the ratio of rate constants for the reactions involving 
the light (kL) and the heavy (kH) isotopically substituted reactants

double b mixing experiments. a The heat-sensitive reactant (enzyme) is loaded into syringe a and the 
non-heat-sensitive reactant (substrate) is loaded into syringe b, both thermostated at 20 C (indicated 
by blue). Upon the stopped-ﬂow push the non-heat-sensitive reactant ﬂows through a heating loop 
in which it is heated above the reaction temperature (indicated by red). The enzyme (myosin) and 
the hot reactant combine in the mixing chamber, and they contribute to the new reaction temperature 
(indicated by orange) according to their temperatures and volumes. The process of the reaction at an 
elevated experimental temperature can be monitored in the cuvette using, e.g., spectroscopic signals. 
b Reactants are loaded into syringes a and b, which are both kept at native temperature (indicated by 
blue). Upon the ﬁrst stopped-ﬂow push, the reactants are mixed in Mixing Chamber I thermostated 
at native temperature (also indicated by blue) then ﬂow into a delay line. The motor then stops for 
a desired delay time, al-lowing the mixture to reach equilibrium. On the next push, the solution is 
mixed with hot buffer (indicated by red) in Mixing Chamber II and forced into the observation cell. 
The process of reaching the new equilibrium upon the rapid temperature-jump perturbation can be 
monitored in the cuvette using, e.g., spectroscopic signals [27, 28]. With permission from Elsevier
A primary KIE is a KIE where the isotopically labeled atom is directly involved in 
bond cleavage or formation, secondary KIEs refers to KIEs resulting from isotopic 
substitution of an atom not directly involved in bond cleavage or formation. Enzy-
matic reactions involve multiple kinetic steps in addition to the bond cleavage/ 
formation step (chemical step), including substrate binding, conformational changes 
and product release, with product release often being the rate-limiting step. In cases 
where these steps are isotopically insensitive, they may still mask the isotope effect 
on the chemical step. 
Semi-classical models of KIEs are rooted in transition state theory (TST), which 
assumes a virtual dynamic equilibrium between the transition state (TS) and the 
ground state (GS). The rate constant (k) described by TST is:

According theory of solvent isotope effects, the transfer of an exchangeable proton 
in a rate-limiting step frequently results in an observed SKIE [33]. A variety reactions 
involving the transfer of hydrogen (H+, H−, or H·) cannot be explained by semi-
classical models. For such reactions quantum mechanical tunneling mechanism was 
proposed [35]. Tunneling is the phenomenon where a particle’s probability density

spreads through a potential energy barrier without ever obtaining the energy necessary 
to surmount that barrier. Since a particle’s ability to tunnel depends on mass, KIEs 
are an excellent probe for tunneling effects. A tunneling correction term QT should 
be added to the transition state (TST) rate constant (kTST):

In this equation, the factors in front of the integral give the rate of reaching a 
tunneling ready state (TRS), based on the electronic coupling between reactant and 
product (V = the degree of adiabaticity of the reaction), the reorganization energy 
(λ), and the driving force of the reaction (G°). The integral measures the probability 
of hydrogen transfer once the system reaches a tunneling ready state (TRS). The ﬁrst 
factor insides the integral determines the probability of tunneling as a function of 
mass (m) and the donor–acceptor distance (DAD). A Boltzmann factor, gives the 
probability of being at any given DAD. 
According to Marcus-like models [36–38] (Fig. 3.7), rates are governed by three 
major processes: (1) Heavy atom motion that brings the system to (TRS), where the 
reactant and product potential surfaces are degenerate and tunneling can occur, (2) 
Fluctuations of the tunneling barrier, modulated by heavy atom motion, and (3) The 
actual process of hydrogen tunneling. Various models for the physical sources of 
KIEs were discussed, namely, how those models can be used to interpret data, and 
how the focus of traditional models has grown to a model that includes motion of 
the enzyme and quantum mechanical nuclear tunneling [32, 33]. 
In work [32, 33], two case studies of enzymes, thymidylate synthase and alcohol 
dehydrogenase using KIEs methods were carried out. Alcohol dehydrogenase ADH 
catalyzes the oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde using a nicotinamide cofactor 
(Fig. 3.8). Mechanism of the  C−H bond cleavage by thymidylate synthase and ADH 
was considered in details.
Studies of ADH demonstrated how 2° KIEs can assess TS structure. The studies 
of TS as showed the use of temperature dependence of 1° KIEs in the investiga-
tion of both the hydride and proton transfers involved in that reaction. Combining 
experimental KIE measurements with QM/MM simulations has clariﬁed the molec-
ular mechanism, possible role of dynamics, and transition state structures for the 
enzyme. 
Data on equilibrium binding isotope effects (BIEs) in two case studies of enzymes, 
thymidylate synthase and alcohol dehydrogenase, suggested the following [38, 39]: 
(1) How to establish the bond vibrational status of enzyme substrates in the Michaelis 
complex prior to the transition state; (2) How they differ from the solution state;

Fig. 3.7 Marcus-like models of hydrogen tunneling—a visualization of. Three slices of the poten-
tial energy surface (PES) along components of the collective reaction coordinate showing the effect 
of heavy atom motions on the zero point energy in the reactant (blue) and product (red) potential 
well. Panel a presents the heavy atom coordinate (also known as the Marcus parabolas), and Panel 
b shows the H-atom position, which is orthogonal to the heavy atom coordinate. In the top panels 
the hydrogen is localized in the reactant well, and the zero point energy of the product state is higher 
than that of the reactant state. Heavy atom reorganization brings the system to the tunneling ready 
state (TRS, middle panels a and b), where the zero point energy in the reactant and product wells 
are degenerate and the hydrogen can tunnel between the wells. Further heavy atom reorganization 
breaks the transient degeneracy and traps the hydrogen in the product state (bottom panels). The 
rate of reaching the TRS depends on the reorganization energy (λ) and driving force (ΔG°), which 
are indicated in the top panel. Panel C shows the effect of the donor–acceptor distance (DAD) 
sampling on the wave function overlap at the TRS (middle panel). Transmission probability (P) is  
a function of the overlap integral of the hydrogen wave functions in the reactant (blue) and product 
(red) wells (bottom panel c). The top panel c presents the contribution to H-transfer at each DAD 
as a function of the P and the population at each DAD The vertical dashed line represents the DAD 
under which the ZPE is greater than the barrier height. At such distances, the process of a wave 
function spreading from reactant well to product well is no longer “tunneling,” but one can still use 
the particle’s transmission probability analogously to the tunneling probability at longer DADs [32,

occurs when the bonding environment of the isotopically substituted position is less 
constrained in the bound state than in the free state, resulting in a decreased force 
constant for this bond upon enzyme binding. By contrast, inverse BIEs (<1.0) occurs 
when binding of the substrate bearing the heavy isotope is favored and are commonly 
expressed as a ratio of equilibrium constants, for example, with

or as a negative percentage value. Inverse BIEs indicates an increased force constant 
for the isotopically substituted bond in the bound state. Measurement of equilibrium 
BIEs, using the rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) device includes: (1) determining 
substrate equilibration time, (2) determination of substrate stability, (3) measurement 
of BIEs on binary and ternary complexes association, (4) scintillation counting and 
spectral deconvolution, and (5) BIE interpretation and examples [38, 39]. 
A theory of KIE for multistep enzymatic reactions was developed by Cleland 
and Northrop (1999) [41, 42]. The isotope in limiting step was expressed in the

bullet Time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (TRESI-MS) method 
for measuring KIE was introduced [43, 44]. The approach was demonstrated ﬁrst 
using a relatively large isotope effect (associated with yeast alcohol dehydroge-
nase (YADH) catalyzed oxidation of ethanol. A small 12C/13C KIE was associ-
ated speciﬁcally with pre-steady state acylation of chymotrypsin during hydrol-
ysis of an ester substrate were measured and discussed. Paper [44, 45] provided 
suggestions and examples how KIE data can be used in study of enzyme reac-
tion mechanisms. The importance of following the Standards for the Reporting of 
Enzymological Data committee’s recommendations when reporting KIE studies 
was outlined. A particular focus was placed on procedures for calculating, prop-
agating, and reporting experimental errors. A framework which integrates KIEs 
into kinetic and isotopic models of metabolism, accounting for their system-wide

developed [45, 46]. This approach was applied to assess the impact of KIEs on 
the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli in the context of 13C-ILEs. 
Results showed that: (1) The impact of KIEs strongly depends on the label input 
and on the variable considered; (2) The framework can be used to investigate the 
impact of all the isotopic tracers

bullet A hypothesis proposed in [49, 50] assumed that the isotopic substitution of 
all 12C, 14N, and nonexchangeable 1H by  13C, 15N, and 2H, would slow down 
protein picosecond to femtosecond dynamics. It was shown that in several systems 
the protein’s fast dynamics are reduced in “heavy” enzymes in a way that reduces 
the probability of barrier crossing of its chemical step (Table 3.2). The observations 
indicated that slower protein dynamics are electrostatically altered in isotopically 
labeled enzymes. The paper also described the following; (1) Methods of prepa-
ration and structural characterization of “heavy” enzymes with isotopic substitu-
tion of all 12C, 14N, and nonexchangeable 1H by  13C, 15N, and 2H;  (2) Effects of  
isotopic labeling on physiochemical properties of the proteins; (3) Approaches

studies of Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) HIV-1 protease, Lactate dehy-
drogenase (LDH) Alanine racemase (AR) and Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)

bullet Review [50, 51] surveyed inverse SKIEs in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, focusing 
on the combination of solvent isotope effects with other isotope effects to probe 
the mechanisms of amine and alcohol oxidations by enzymes. Macroscopic rate 
constants such as kcat and kcat/Km were found to decrease when the reaction is 
performed in D2O. A variety of this effect reasons including the transfer of protons 
were discussed. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, these constants can 
increase, which can be attributed to an inverse solvent equilibrium isotope effect 
on a rapid equilibrium preceding the rate-limiting step(s). Interpretation of solvent 
isotope effects should take in account the following aspects: (1) Many protons 
in the enzyme are exchanged in D2O; (2) Multiple protons in the substrate also

can be replaced; (3) The properties of D2O as solvent viscosity and polarity, for 
example, are not identical to those of H2O and D2O; (4) pKa values are altered in 
D2O increasing by 0.3–0.7 33] [50, 51] Based on a critical analysis of numerous 
experimental data on isotope effects, the following conclusions were formulated 
[50, 51]: (1) For oxidations of both alcohols and amines by a variety of enzymes, 
the use of multiple isotope effects has established that proton transfer precedes 
hydride transfer; (2) For amine oxidation, the enzyme does not require an active 
site base to remove a proton from the amine; (3) For alcohol oxidation, a variety of 
enzymes stabilize the alkoxide sufﬁciently that its formation does not contribute to 
the rate of catalysis; (4) Methanol oxidase and galactose oxidase provide examples 
of how the use of alternate, typically nonphysiological, substrates can alter the 
relative energetics of alkoxide formation and the subsequent CH bond cleavage; 
and (5) the ﬂavoprotein D-arginine dehydrogenase binds the zwitterionic form of 
the amino acid substrate productively, in contrast to the binding of the anionic 
substrate by other amine-oxidizing enzymes.
According theory of solvent isotope effects, the transfer of an exchangeable proton 
in a rate-limiting step frequently results in an observed SKIE [33, 34]. The transfer of 
solvent-sensitive protons yields primary deuterium isotope effects that occur along 
the reaction coordinate (Fig. 3.10). During this transfer, the bond to the donor weakens 
in the transition state, yielding a normal SKIE (i.e., k Sub script upper D Baseline 2 upper O Baseline identical to k Subscript upper H Baseline 2 upper O Baseline divided by k Subscript upper D Baseline 2 upper O Baseline greater than 1), and 
protons in ﬂight in a rate-limiting step produce normal SIE contributions. Under 
certain circumstances, macroscopic rate constants such as kcat and kcat/Km were 
found to increase, showing an inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect (SKIE). It was 
concluded that these phenomena can be attributed to an inverse solvent equilibrium 
isotope effect on a rapid equilibrium preceding the rate-limiting step(s). (See details 
in capture of Fig. 3.10).
P450 reactions (Fig. 3.11) are well-suited to the application of KIE approaches, 
because the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes involve the breaking of C–H bonds 
[47, 49]. The most common P450 reactions are the conversion of a methyl, methylene, 
or methine group to an alcohol. Types of deuterium KIE studies used in P450 research 
is shown in Fig. 3.12. Many of the reported KIEs for P450 reactions are larger than 
the classical limit of ~ 7.

Fig. 3.10 Reaction coordinate diagram of a solvent-sensitive rapid equilibrium preceding a rate-
limiting step that results in inverse solvent isotope effects. Horizontal lines represent zero-point 
energy levels, reﬂecting the mass of the hydron and the stiffness of the bond in which it is involved. 
When the stiffness of the bond increases, as shown in the rapid-equilibrium step (pink), the zero-
point energy difference between the two isotopes increases relative to the reactant ground state (G1), 
leading to accumulation of deuterium in the intermediate ground state (G2); this is reﬂected in an 
increase in the fractionation factor (ϕ) for this step and an inverse solvent equilibrium isotope effect 
(SEIE) (i.e., D2OKeq < 1). If the stiffness of the solvent-exchangeable hydron is not altered in the 
transition state (TS) of a subsequent rate-limiting step (purple), then no SKIE will be contributed 
for this step (i.e., D2Ok ~ 1). The observed inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) (D2Okobs) 
for the overall process will be inverse (Eq. (3.2)). A = solvent-exchangeable group; E = enzyme

where DV is the KIE on kcat and D(V/K) is the KIE on the ratio of kcat/Km. The  
value of D(V/K) was found to be ~3–5 and a plot of product vs. time indicates rate-
limiting step is after product formation. The Dk for C-H bond breaking was found 
to be 3.8 and the isotopic effect on product formation measured using pre-steady-
state kinetic studies was estimated to be 3.2 [52]. Thus, the presence of a signiﬁcant 
primary deuterium KIE is evidence that hydrogen abstraction is at least partially rate-
limiting in the reactions. Many of the reported KIEs for P450 reactions are larger 
than the classical limit of ~ 7 . No reports of serious efforts at studying tunneling 
have appeared.

Reaction of S-[1-2H,1-3H]-ethane in a multiple turnover sMMO system resulted in 
the formation of ethanol. The large tritium kinetic isotope effect justiﬁed that oxygen 
preferentially inserted in only the C–1H. In work [54, 55], three aspects of chlorine 
kinetic isotope effects (Cl-KIEs) on enzymatic dehalogenations were considered: 
(1) Мethodology for experimental measurement of Cl-KIEs, employing fast-atom 
bombardment-isotope ratio mass spectrometer FAB-IRMS; (2) Тhe consequences of 
the reaction complexity; and (3) theoretical evaluation of the experimental results.

The Cl-KIE 
for DCE dechlorination by DhlA was found to be 1.0068. The theoretical prediction 
of the intrinsic isotope effect indicated that in both cases dehalogenation is a rate-
determining step. For benzyl alcohol, an enzyme isotope effect larger than unity was 
observed, whereas the enzyme isotope effect was close to unity for isopropanol. 
The origin of a substrate (benzyl alcohol or isopropanol) preference in the alcohol 
dehydrogenase (ADH) from Geobacillus (BsADH) was examined by enzyme isotope 
labeling [32, 33]. ADH catalyzes the oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde using a

nicotinamide cofactor. The main beneﬁts of using ADH as a model are that one can 
study both the forward (alcohol to aldehyde) and reverse reactions. Employing both 
experimental and computational methods, it was shown that: (1) The observed KIEs 
were equal to the intrinsic KIEs at the physiological temperatures (20–30 °C); (2) 
An elevated or reduced temperatures minor commitments appear, partially masking 
intrinsic KIEs; (3) The reaction required a small activation energy (about 4.0 kcal/ 
mol); (4) The intrinsic KIEs are temperature independent, indicating that the hydride 
tunnels from a narrow distribution of DADs is unaffected by temperature; (5) For 
benzyl alcohol, an enzyme isotope effect is larger than unity; and (6) The enzyme 
isotope effect is close to unity for isopropanol. 
The enzyme kinetic isotope effects for reactions catalyzed by Alcohol Dehy-
drogenase (BsADH) and the effect of dynamic coupling in BsADH) catalysis for 
different substrates were examined [55, 56]. The natural substrates of BsADH served 
as hydride acceptors under anaerobic conditions. The several important results of 
the work were reported, namely: (1) The hydride transfer from benzyl alcohol 
to NAD+ during catalysis by BsADH is rate-limiting under steady state condi-
tions at pH 7.0; (2) Substrate KIEs (KIE=kcat H/kcat D) was determined by measuring 
the steady-state rate constant (kcat) using protonated and deuterated substrates;; 
(3) The resulting substrate KIE (KIE=kcat H/kcat D) is highly temperature-dependent, 
increasing sharply at lower temperatures but remaining constant above 40 °C; and 
(4) The substrate KIE measured with protonated and deuterated isopropanol is 
temperature-independent for the examined temperature range (20–50 °C), with an 
average value of 2.42 ± 0.42. 
Dihydrofolate Reductase (R67 DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate 
to tetrahydrofolate (THF) [57, 60].To investigate the correlation between the KIEs, 
their temperature dependence, DAD distribution, and active site preorganization and 
dynamics the KIEs for the enzyme were computed. Initial Michaelis complexes 
were constructed using the X-ray crystal structures of plasmid-encoded DHFR with 
bound folate and the oxidized cofactor NADP+. The potential energy surface was 
described by a hybrid QM/MM Hamiltonian, where the catalytically active QM 
region was treated with a modiﬁed AM1 semiempirical Hamiltonian denoted AM1-
speciﬁc reaction parameter (AM1-SRP). By employing mass-perturbation PI simu-
lations (PIFEP/ UM with SQCP), nuclear quantum effects for both light (H) and 
heavy (D) isotopes in the hydride transfer reaction were measured. As a result, the 
classical mechanics PMF proﬁles at 278, 288, 298, 308, and 318 K for the catalyzed 
hydride transfer from NADPH to H3folate+ (N5-protonated DHF) in the R67 DHFR 
were obtained (Fig. 3.13). Studies of enzymes such as DHFR, glycerol-3-phosphate-
dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, paraoxonase, and organophosphate have 
shown that penetration of solvent molecules to the active site is detrimental to 
catalytic activity. Employing mass-perturbation PI simulations (PIFEP/ UM with 
SQCP), revealed nuclear quantum effects for both light (H) and heavy (D) isotopes 
in the hydride transfer reaction. The quantum corrected ratios H/D KIEs are shown 
in Fig. 3.13 [57, 60].

Method of Transition State Analogs [59–89] 
In 1946 Pauling introduced idea that lowering of the activation energy in enzyme 
catalysis, as compare with a chemical reaction, stems from the enzyme’s afﬁnity 
for the transition state exceeding its afﬁnity for in the chemical process [61, 65]. 
Tight-binding transition state analogues evolved enzymatic geometry to form the 
transition state (Figs. 3.14 and 3.15). Knowledge of the TS can provide informa-
tion to design stable TS analogs which can be effective enzyme inhibitors. Such 
an approach has three important aspects: (1) hinting to chemists about the plausible 
structure of speciﬁc inhibitors for synthesis, (2) using these inhibitors to test working 
hypothesizes about TS structures, and (3) using these inhibitors for the regulation of 
enzymatic processes in vitro and in vivo..The transition states for chemical reactions 
are proposed to have lifetimes near 10–13 s, the time for a single bond vibration. 
Transition state analogues convert the short-lived transition state to a stable ther-
modynamic state. Analogues of the transition state can bind millions of times more

tightly than substrates and have been used for generating catalytic antibodies that 
catalyze chemical reactions. If an antibody could bind the transition state tightly like 
an enzyme, and it should also catalyze the reaction just like an enzyme (Chap. 13). 
Antigens stable mimics, the transition-state analogs, which have long half-lives and 
could be synthesized chemically, may function as an antigen to generate the antibody. 
The full TS analogue design (TSAD) must include the following steps [62, 66]: (1) 
Chemical or biochemical synthesis of substrate molecules containing isotopic labels 
at speciﬁc positions; (2) Determination of experimental conditions wherein intrinsic 
isotope effects, that is, KIEs reﬂecting only the chemical step –can be measured; (3) 
Measurement of KIEs for each position labeled in step 1; and (4) Iterative compu-
tation of theoretical KIEs from quantum mechanical calculations with model struc-
tures until the KIEs match those from experiment in step 3. The following are typical 
examples of the transition state analogs method application. 
Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is an enzyme comprising the purine 
salvage pathway. PNP catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of purine ribo- or 2′-
deoxyribonucleosides to the purine and ribose- or 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate [62]. 
Structures of inosine, the PNP TS and the proposed analogue obtained by interpre-
tation of KIEs for inosine arsenolysis used computer modeling and started with the 
crystal structure of inosine as the ground state model are presented. The state of the 
art of combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations on enzyme 
systems and carry out an analysis of the role of preorganization effects on enzyme 
catalysis were reviewed [63, 66]. The calculation indicated that the free energy cost 
of aligning the functional groups for catalysis is responsible for a substantial fraction 
of the 1011 − 1013 faster rates of the enzyme-catalyzed reactions for trypsin and 
catechol O-methyltransferase compared to analogous reference reactions in aqueous 
solution. Figure 3.15 shows Schematic diagram of a representative enzyme-catalyzed 
and reference solution reaction.

Extrapolating from the acid- and base-catalyzed solvolysis of purine nucleosides, 
purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) increased the reaction rate by approximately 
1013 [58, 64]. Steady-state, pre-steady-state, and T-jump studies of PNPs together 
with structural and computational studies demonstrated a similarity of transition state 
in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) reaction and a transition state analog 
(Fig. 3.16). It was suggested that the protein architecture remote from the catalytic 
site can become dynamic when transition state analogues are bound, resulting in

favorable or unfavorable entropic contributions to binding. Figure 3.17 shows the 
distinct time scales for purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), catalysis and tran-

changes are on the ms to ns time scale. 
The enzymes responsible for DNA methylation are the DNA methyltransferases 
(DNMTs) [64]. DNMTs add a methyl group on the carbon-5 (C5) position of the 
deoxycytidine at the CpG site in the DNA by using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as 
methyl donor. 
A protected bromomethylcytosine derivative was used to obtain transition state 
analogues of the DNMTs bearing a 5- methylcytosine scaffold linked to adeno-
sine via an N-alkyl linker. The approach led to seven 5-methylcytosine-adenosine 
compounds that were inactive against hDNMT1, hDNMT3Acat, TRDMT1, and 
other RNA human and viral methyltransferases. Two of these compounds showed 
an inhibitory activity against human protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT4) 
in the micromolar range.

and polyvalent compounds were synthesized, based on the transition-state analogue 
2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic(DANA). 
The following results were reported: (1) The most potent SA inhibitors were 
obtained by making structural modiﬁcations at C-4, C-5, and C-9 positions of DANA, 
a pan-inhibitor of bacterial SA with Ki in the mm range; (2) Poly-DANA inhibited 
the catalytic activity of SA from S. pneumoniae (NanA) and the symbiotic microor-
ganism B. thetaiotaomicron (BtSA) at the picomolar and low nanomolar level: (3)

Each DANA grafted to the polymer surpasses the inhibitory potential of the monova-
lent analogue by more than four orders of magnitude; (4) The inhibitory capacity and 
binding interaction of the compounds on the full-length BtSA and NanA and on the 
truncated NanA catalytic domain (NanA-CAT) was established; and (5) Structural 
information on ligand binding was obtained from a NanA-CAT co-crystal structure, 
molecular dynamic simulation on DANANanA complexes, and dynamic light scat-

transition-state analogue DANA have a high level of inhibition for a bacterial SA of 
the GH33 family.

(TSA) was employed to study a Zika virus NS3h helicase. The enzyme uses energy 
from ATP hydrolysis to reorganize ssRNA, leading to completion of virus replication. 
The octahedral triﬂuoromagnesate core of a transition state complex displays two 
conformations for a catalytically important loop, demonstrating how ATP hydrol-
ysis can be coupled with RNA translocation. This structure was further probed by 
quantum mechanical calculations of the catalytic core (200 atoms), conﬁrming the 
structural data interpretation and the concerted mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by this 
class of helicase. 
A spectroscopic examination of two of six examinated galactonoamidines with 
inhibition constants and efﬁcacy in the low nanomolar concentration range (Ki = 
6–11 nM, IC50 = 12–36 nM) were found to be putative transition state analogs 
for the hydrolysis of β-galactosides by β-galactosidase [67, 71]. For example, p-
methylbenzyl galactonoamidine 
can be characterized as a putative transition state analog. The experimental results 
elaborated using docking and molecular dynamics studies indicated that the putative 
transition state analogs (TSAs): (1) have a similar orientation in the active site; (2) 
show conserved positioning of the glycon ; (3) display a large number of H-bond 
interactions toward the catalytically active amino acid residues via their glycon a 
branched glucose polymer; and (4) exhibit hydrophobic interactions at the outer rim 
of the active site with small changes of the position and orientation of their respective 
aglycons.

Theoretical Methods 
3.6.1 
Foundation of Theoretical Approaches 
To understand enzyme catalysis mechanism at the molecular level, it is essential to 
ﬁgure out structural or conformational change of enzyme and substrate during catal-
ysis, nature of transition states, the bottlenecks to control reaction kinetics, and the 
decrease of corresponding free energy barriers due to the catalytic effect of enzymes. 
A number of computational simulation tools, in particular the combined quantum 
mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method were introduced [90–168]. 
These methods allow to understand enzyme function based on three-dimensional 
structures and dynamics of enzyme-substrate complexes. 
Theoretical methods of investigation structure of enzyme reaction are based on 
the Schrodinger equation for relatively small quantum particles such as electrons and 
nucleus and heavy species motion of which can be described be the Newton lows. The 
Schrodinger equation gives the positions of the nuclei and the number of electrons in 
order to yield information such as electron densities, energies and other properties of 
the system [123, 130]. Ab initio quantum chemistry methods were designed to solve 
the electronic Schrödinger equation [124, 130]. The methods aim is to calculate the 
many electron function which is the solution the electronic Schrödinger equation in 
the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. This approximation is the assumption that 
the electronic motion and the nuclear motion in molecules can be separated and a 
molecular wave function can be considered in terms of electron positions and nuclear 
positions. For a complete description of quantum phenomena, the quantum nature 
of both electrons and nuclei has to be taken into account. 
To overcome sophistical problems of the Schrödinger equation solving for 
molecules, a number of approximations were proposed. The simplest type 
of ab initio electronic structure calculation is the Hartree–Fock (HF) scheme, in which 
Coulombic electron-electron repulsion effect (mean ﬁeld) is included in the calcula-
tion. [125, 126, 130, 131]. In the Hartree-Fock method, the many electron function is 
a linear combination of many simpler electron functions with the dominant function 
being the Hartree–Fock function. The method scales nominally as N (N being a rela-
tive measure of the system size, a number of the spin orbitals). A molecular orbital is 
a mathematical function describing the location and wave-like behavior of an elec-
tron in a molecule. In the case where the particles are fermions, for example electron 
with spin 1/2, the Hartree–Fock method can be approximated by a single Slater deter-
minant (SD) [128, 130]. Slater determinant is an expression that describes the wave 
function of a multi-electronic system. The SD satisﬁes anti-symmetry requirements, 
and consequently the Pauli principle, by changing sign upon exchange of two elec-
trons. The Slater determinant arises from the consideration of a wave function for a 
collection of electrons, each with a wave function known as the spin-orbital where 
denotes the position and spin of a single electron.

Methods of Enzyme Kinetics
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods analyze the physical move-
ments of atoms and molecules [129, 133]. The force of attraction tends to pull 
the particles closer together. To overcome the force of attraction and move apart, 
the particles need a corresponding kinetic energy. In the most common version of 
the methods, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numer-
ically solving Newton’s equations of motion for a system of interacting parti-
cles. Forces between the particles and their potential energies are calculated 
using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanics force ﬁelds. In fact, Molecular 
mechanics uses classical mechanics to model molecular systems [130, 131, 136, 137]. 
The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is assumed valid and the potential energy of 
all systems is calculated as a function of the nuclear coordinates using force ﬁelds. 
This model involves the development of a simple molecular mechanics energy equa-
tion representing the sum of various energy interaction terms comprised of bonds, 
angles, torsions of bonded, as well as, nonbonded atoms. Molecular mechanics 
methods are widely used to give accurate structures and energies for molecules. 
A force ﬁeld method [135, 141–143, 149, 150] is used to estimate the forces 
between atoms within molecules and also between molecules. The force of attrac-
tion tends to pull the particles closer together. To overcome the force of attraction and 
move apart, the particles need a corresponding kinetic energy. The force ﬁeld refers 
to the functional form and parameter sets used to calculate the potential energy of 
a system of atoms or coarse-grained particles in molecular mechanics, molecular 
dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations. Coarse-grained modeling aims at simulating 
the behavior of complex systems using their coarse-grained (simpliﬁed) represen-
tation. Monte Carlo simulations [144, 151] are used to model the probability of 
different outcomes in a process that cannot be predicted due to the intervention of 
random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncer-
tainty in prediction and forecasting models. Monte Carlo methods are a broad class 
of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numer-
ical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that 
might be deterministic in principle. 
The variational method [145, 152] is approximation to the lowest energy eigen-
state or ground state, and some excited states. This allows calculating approximate 
wavefunctions such as molecular orbitals. A variational principle is one that enables 
a problem to be solved using calculus of variations, which concerns ﬁnding functions 
that optimize the values of quantities that depend on those functions. 
Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical 
modeling method used to investigate the electronic and nuclear structure ((prin-
cipally the ground state) of many-body systems, in particular atoms, molecules, and 
the condensed phases. Using density functional theory (DFT) theory [148] the prop-
erties of a many electron system can be determined by employing functionals, i.e., 
functions of another function. In DFT the functional is the electron density which is 
a function of space and time. In DFT the key variable is the electron density n(r), 
normalized. For a given ground-state density n0(r) it is possible, in principle, to 
calculate the corresponding ground-state wavefunction Ψ0(r1, …,  rN) [154].

3.6 Theoretical Methods

Umbrella sampling is a technique in computational physics and chemistry, used 
to improve sampling of a system where ergodicity is hindered by the form of the 
system’s energy landscape. In mathematics, ergodicity expresses the idea that a point 
of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually 
visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense 
[148, 150]. In umbrella sampling approach, the standard Boltzmann weighting for 
Monte Carlo sampling is replaced by a potential chosen to cancel the inﬂuence of 
the energy barrier present. 
3.6.2 
Combined Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics 
(QM/MM) Methods in Computational Enzymology 
Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods are restricted to systems of up to a few hundred 
atoms. However, the size and conformational complexity of biopolymers calls for 
methods capable of treating up to several 100,000 atoms and allowing for simula-
tions over time scales of tens of nanoseconds. The combined quantum mechanics 
and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method which allow to understand enzyme 
function based on three-dimensional structures and dynamics of enzyme-substrate 
complexes obeyed these requirements [132–140, 132–151]. The principle of QM/ 
MM approaches is to treat a small part of the system with a quantum mechanical 
(QM) method (i.e., a method that describes the electronic structure of molecules) 
and the rest of the system with a molecular mechanical method (i.e., a method that 
describes interactions between atoms using a simple potential energy function, a 
force ﬁeld (Fig. 3.18) [152, 157]. Thus, the hybrid QM/MM(approach is a molec-
ular simulation method that combines the strengths of ab initio QM calculations 
(accuracy) and molecular mechanics MM (speed) approaches. 
Five general aspects are important in planning a QM/MM calculation on an 
enzyme [51, 156]: (1) Choice of the QM method; (2) Choice of MM forceﬁeld, 
(including MM parameters required for the QM region); (3) Partitioning of the system 
into QM and MM regions, (including treatment of covalent bonds at the boundary);

and (4) type of simulation (e.g., a molecular dynamics simulation, or calculation of 
potential energy); and (5) construction (and testing) of an accurate molecular model 
of the enzyme complex. The equation for QM/MM methods consists of 3 terms. In 
the additive approach

the energy of the QM region according to the QM method, EMM(MM) is the energy of 
the MM region according to the MM method, and EQM−MM is the interaction energy 
between the two regions). In the subtractive approach 
upper E  Subsc ript t otal Baseline equals

with EMM, total the energy of the total system and EMM(QM) the energy of the QM 
region as calculated by the MM method. Speciﬁcally, in a subtractive approach, 
the total QM/MM energy of the system is calculated stepwise [136, 138]: The total 
energy of the system (QM and MM regions) is evaluated using the MM methodology; 
(2) The incorporation of the isolated QM energy; (3) The MM energy of the QM 
subsystem is calculated and subtracted; and (4) Last step corrects the calculations 
by including the interaction within the QM subsystem. Both approaches allowed 
electrostatic embedding, which takes into account the electrostatic inﬂuence of the 
MM region on the QM region, i.e., polarization of the QM region by the atomic 
charges of the MM region. 
Electrostatic interactions between the QM and MM regions can be classiﬁed 
as either mechanical embedding, electrostatic embedding or polarized embedding 
(https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.13/ug/node82.html). In the mechanical 
embedding, the QM region is embedded into the MM region and the interaction 
between both regions is treated at the MM level and the QM–MM electrostatic 
interaction is treated on the same footing as the MM–MM electrostatics. The charge 
model of the MM method, taking in account rigid atomic point charges and bond 
dipoles, can be applied to the QM region as well. In the electrostatic embedding, the 
MM charges surrounding the QM region are considered in the Hamiltonian as one-
electron operators, and, the electron density of the QM region can be modiﬁed by the 
external ﬁeld created by the MM charges [151, 153]. Electrostatic embedding also 
accounts for the interaction of the polarizable QM density with rigid MM charges 
[151, 153]. In the polarizable embedding the MM region is allowed to be polarized by 
the interaction with the QM density [152, 154]. These polarized embedding schemes 
can be further divided into approaches where the polarizable charge model in the 
MM region is polarized by the QM electric ﬁeld and the polarizable MM model is 
included into the QM Hamiltonian and therefore allows for mutual polarization. In 
addition to the electrostatic interactions, there are also van der Waals and bonded 
contributions to the QM–MM coupling term [153, 155]. Boundary-atom schemes 
replace the MM frontier atom M1 by a special boundary atom that participates as an 
ordinary MM atom in the MM calculation but also carries QM features to saturate 
the free valency of Q1 [154, 157].

3.6 Theoretical Methods
129
The approach of using a frozen hybrid orbital, that do not participate in the 
Local Self-Consistent Field (LSCF), to saturate the dangling bond at the QM–MM 
boundary was introduced by Warshel and Levitt [133, 139]. Different schemes based 
on the idea of placing a set of suitably oriented localized orbitals on one of the fron-
tier atoms have been elaborated [125, 146, 157]. LSCF links the quantum mechanical 
portion of the molecule to the classical portion using a strictly localized bond orbital 
extracted from a small model molecule for each bond. The LSCF allows quantum 
electronic computations on a fragment of a large molecule depicted by a classical 
force ﬁeld [158, 167]. The bond separating the quantum subsystem from the clas-
sical one was assumed to be represented by localized orbitals introduced as data. The 
molecular orbitals of this subsystem are developed on a basis of functions, orthogonal 
to the localized orbitals, which derive from the atomic orbitals of the usual basis set 
by a simple linear transformation. The algorithm of the LSCF method was obtained 
by a simple modiﬁcation of the standard Hartree-Fock or DFT codes. 
Conﬁguration Interaction Singles (CIS) is a method in QM/MM applications due 
to its computational expedience that allows for the treatment of several hundred atoms 
[159, 167]. Conﬁguration interaction (CI) is a post-Hartree–Fock linear variational 
method for solving the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation within the Born–Oppen-
heimer approximation for a quantum chemical multi-electron system. The method 
allows one to simultaneously solve for a large number of excited states and to opti-
mize the geometry of any selected state. Both spin singlet and spin triplet states can 
be generated. The techniques of investigation of very large systems proposed in [160, 
167] can be used to investigate very large systems. The techniques can be subdivided 
into two main categories: fragmentation and embedding strategies. The LSCF was 
enabled to treat chemically relevant regions of large biological molecules through 
methods of quantum chemistry, while describing the remaining parts of the systems 
by means of frozen extremely localized molecular orbitals (ELMOs) (Fig. 3.19). 
ELMOs are molecular orbitals strictly localized on small molecular units and, due 
to their extreme localization, they can be transferred from molecule to molecule and 
considered as plausible electronic building blocks [160, 167]. 
Achievements and challenges in this area have been summarized and discussed 
in detail in a series of comprehensive reviews [134, 147, 161–164].

Methods of Enzyme Kinetics
For example, QM/MM methods and their application to enzyme-catalyzed 
reactions to investigate fundamental and practical problems in enzymology were 
reviewed. Special emphasis on very general link-atom methods and various ways 
to treat the charge near the boundary were introduced. Review [162, 169] presented 
the general methodological aspects of the QM/MM approach, which is used within 
optimization and simulation techniques. Review [149, 156] discussed how modeling 
of reactions using QM/MM methods can provide detailed insight into enzyme mech-
anisms and highlighted applications and can contribute to the practical development 
and application of enzymology. The current state of the art of QM/MM) approaches 
in ground and electronically excited states and their applications to biological prob-
lems published by 2015 was reviewed [134, 140]. The review [163, 170] summa-
rized the advances that have been made in QM–MM 29 apply approaches to UV– 
visible, Raman, IR, NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Mössbauer spec-
troscopies, Recent review [147, 154] discussed methods for the incorporation of 
quantum mechanical effects into enzyme kinetics simulations in which the enzyme 
is an explicit part of the model. The following three aspects were emphasized: (1) Use 
of quantum mechanical electronic structure methods such as molecular orbital theory 
and density functional theory, usually in conjunction with molecular mechanics; 
(2) Treating vibrational motions quantum mechanically, either in an instantaneous 
harmonic approximation, or by path integrals, or by a three-dimensional wave func-
tion coupled to classical nuclear motion; and (3) Incorporation of multidimensional 
tunneling approximations into reaction rate calculations.

Examples Illustrating Theoretical Approaches 
Citrate synthase catalyzes the ﬁrst reaction in the citric acid cycle the conversion of 
oxaloacetate into citrate. QM/MM modeling has helped elucidate the enzyme mech-
anism [149, 156]. The reaction features proton abstraction from acetyl-coenzyme A 
(acetyl-CoA), condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate to form citryl-CoA, and 
hydrolysis of this stable intermediate to form citrate and CoA. This ﬁnding indicated 
that the enolate was energetically favored in the enzyme active site, with conventional 
hydrogen bonds from His274 and a conserved water molecule providing stabilization 
of this species (Fig. 3.20).

The QM/MM/MD method was employed to investigate the mechanism of hydride 
transfer between the methyl group on the Nmethylated lysyl residue and the middle 
ring of the ﬂavin cofactor catalyzed by Lysine Speciﬁc Demethylase [132, 138]. The 
QM region was deﬁned as a truncated FAD with a structure formed by three rings 
and a truncated lysine residue with three methyl groups. All the other protein atoms 
and solvent molecules were treated as MM region. The hydride transfer process, a

and the forming N–H bond length (r2) was monitored. Integrating the QM/MM/MD 
simulation and the umbrella sampling method allowed to calculate the free energy 
proﬁle, reaction barrier in the proposed hydride transfer mechanism and potential 
of mean force (PMF). The transition state with the maximum PMF was found near 
the reaction coordinate with s = 0.02 Å, and the corresponding free energy barrier 
is about 10 kcal/mol. The Suv4-20h2 enzyme acts on histone 4 lysine 20 (H4K20) 
catalyzing its methylation. The QM/MM MD simulations were applied to the Suv4-
20h2-catalyzed reaction for understanding of its preference with monomethylated 
H4K20 peptide as the substrate [164, 171]. The computation showed that: (1) the free 
energy barrier for monomethylation is 23.9 kcal/mol), (2) the free energy barrier for 
the di-methylation (17.9 kcal/mol) is much lower than those of the monomethylation 
and trimethylation, and (3) the enzyme can catalyze the di-methylation reaction using 
H4K20me1 substrate much more efﬁciently compared to the monomethylation and 
trimethylation.

The enzyme para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) catalyzes the transfor-
mation of p-hydroxyben [116, 122]. 
The aromatic hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate by the reactive C4a-
hydroperoxyﬂavin cofactor intermediate in PHBH has been studied by a combined 
ab initio quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method. The 
calculation showed the following results: (1) The calculation started from a model 
of the C4a-hydroperoxyﬂavin intermediate in the PHBH reaction cycle, built on the 
basis of the crystal structure of the enzyme−substrate complex; (2) A pathway for 
the hydroxylation step was calculated by imposing a reaction coordinate involving 
cleavage of the peroxide oxygen−oxygen bond and bond formation between the C3 
atom of the substrate and the distal oxygen of the peroxide moiety of the cofactor; 
(3) A QM/MM potential was used in system in which the QM region (49 atoms) was 
treated at the ab initio HF level with the 3-21G(d) or 6-31G(d) basis sets; (4) Inclu-
sion of electron correlation, applied as B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and LMP2/6-31+G(d) 
single point energy corrections to the ab initio QM/MM structures, was shown to 
be essential to obtain barriers in agreement with the experimental rate constant; (5) 
Electrophilic aromatic substitution was suggested as the mechanism of this rate-
limiting step in the PHBH catalyzed reaction cycle; (6) The polarization of the QM 
region by the enzyme has been investigated; (7) A potentially important catalytic 
interaction between the reacting OH group in the transition state (formally OH+) 
and the backbone carbonyl of the Pro293 residue was identiﬁed; and (8) This inter-
action is calculated to lower the barrier by a catalytically signiﬁcant 2−3 kcal/mol, 
corresponding to a 100-fold rate enhancement. 
The cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyze many types of oxidation reactions, often 
with high regio- and stereoselectivity, including hydroxylation, epoxidation, and 
heteroatom oxidation. A comprehensive review [167, 171] covers the extensive theo-
retical work on these enzymes until 2004, in particular DFT model studies and 
early QM/MM studies. A work [151, 158] focused on QM/MM investigations of 
cytochrome P450cam that catalyzes the stereospeciﬁc hydroxylation of the non-
activated C5 Hexo bond in camphor under physiological conditions. All the interme-
diates in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome P450cam have been characterized through 
DFT/MM calculations. The assignment of the spin states of these intermediates was 
performed. The computation indicated that their relative energies are strongly depen-
dent on the admixture of Hartree–Fock exchange in the chosen density functional 
which are tuned by the interactions with the protein environment. In addition, the

Elementary Mechanisms of Enzyme 
Reactions (Part 1) 
Abstract The outstanding catalytic, regulatory, and self-preserving properties of 
enzymes have been developed over the course of several million years of molecular 
evolution. Proximity and Oriental Effects are an important part of these mechanisms 
due to the pre-binding of the substrate by unique orientation relative to the catalytic 
groups. For example, cyclization of aliphatic molecule provides decrease of entropy 
of DS0 = – 3.6  − 4.7 eu. Difference in rates is 3–4 orders of magnitude (intramolec-
ular versus intermolecular). In a concerted reaction, when a substrate is simultane-
ously attracted by different active donor and acceptor reagents such as acid and basic 
groups, nucleophile and electrophile, or reducing and oxidizing agents a signiﬁcant 
decrease in the activation energy is expected. General theoretical considerations in 
favor of synchronous or sequential mechanisms and speciﬁc cases are discussed in 
a separate section. In the case of effective concerted mechanism, the decrease in 
the synchronization probability with increasing number of atoms or groups, partic-
ipating in an elementary stage, can be compensated for by an appreciable decrease 
in the activation energy due to the inclusion of nuclei of donor and acceptor groups 
in the process. This consideration has led us to the formulation of the principle of 
optimum motion (POM). In 1975, the author of this monograph has suggested that 
rapid electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers in the forward direction 
and signiﬁcantly slower transfer in the reverse direction may account for the cascade 
structure of RC which provides tunneling (long-distance) mechanism of the photo-
separated charges. The discovery and experimental conﬁrmation of Long-Range 
Electron Transfer (LRET) between donor (D) and acceptor (A) centers in model and 
biological systems were described. Data on Photosystem I and photosystem II which 
are the two multi-protein complexes that contain the pigments necessary to harvest 
photons and use light energy to catalyze the primary photosynthetic endergonic reac-
tions producing high energy compounds were brieﬂy reviewed. Magnetic isotope 
effects arise when a chemical reaction involves spin-selective processes proceeded 
via the radical pair mechanism was described.

Elementary Mechanisms of Enzyme Reactions (Part 1)
4.1 
Proximity and Oriental Effects 
To accelerate chemical reactions, enzymes make use of a variety of molecular strate-
gies, often with a remarkable effectiveness [1–27]. Strategy, called the proximity 
and oriental effects, is to organize the substrates within the active site of the enzyme 
such that the reactants are much closer together and oriented than they would be in 
the reaction corresponding solution (Fig. 4.1) [1–7]. These effects of proximity are 
analogous to an effective increase in concentration of the reagents and endows the 
reaction with an intramolecular character with a rate increase. Difference in rates 
can be 3–4 orders of magnitude (intramolecular versus intermolecular (Fig. 4.1). 
According to Jencks Circe effect a large entropy penalty for the uncatalyzed reaction 
is eliminated by the enzyme because of tight binding of the substrate [3]. Thus, the 
catalytic efﬁciency of enzymes depends on their ability to juxtapose the reacting 
atoms and to steer their orbitals along a path (orientation effect) (Fig. 4.1). Below 
the effects mentioned above are illustrated with corresponding examples. 
Benson [4, 5] introduced three rules for estimation of decrease of standard entropy 
(DS0 in eu) at frozen of mobility molecules in gas face at 25 °C (the entropy unit 
“e.u.” is equal to one calorie per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 joules per kelvin per 
mole): (1) cyclization of aliphatic molecule decrease of entropy of DS0 = − 3.6 − 
4.7 eu; (2) introduction of double bond in cycles of 4, 5, and 6 bonds lead to decrease 
of entropy, DS0 = − 3.2 eu, DS0 = − 5.4 eu and DS0 = − 0.6 eu, respectively; 
(3) entropies of free rotation of small radicals (fragments) such as CH3 and OH are
Fig. 4.1 Effective concentration measures the rate enhancement of an intramolecular reaction 
relative to a corresponding intermolecular reaction A Shown are two hypothetical reactions 
between reactants A and B. The top row shows an intermolecular reaction while the bottom 
row shows an otherwise equivalent intramolecular reaction. The rate constants of both reac-
tions, kinter and kintra, are indicated. B Effective concentration (Ceff) equals the ratio of the 
intramolecular rate constant over the intermolecular rate constant. In this example Ceff equals 
200,000 M, meaning that the reactants in the intermolecular reaction would have to be present at 
200,000 M in order to match the rate of the intramolecular reaction when its reactants are present at 
1 M.  https://www.labxchange.org/library/pathway/lx-pathway:f1580683-16ef-442d-a278-8c5d21

DS0 = − 5,8 and 4.6 eu, respectively; (4) for more voluminous fragments DS0 are 
in a range from − 8.3–11eu; and (5) having rotation barriers of 2–5 kcal/mol can 
decrease of DS0 for 0.5–2 eu. In real systems, the entropy change can be governed 
by the environment viscosity. 
In a typical example of the oriental effect, as a result of alkyl substitution in both 
aromatic ring and side chain, the rate constant for acid-catalyzed lactonization of 
hydrocoumaric acid in compound IV 
increased by factors as high as 1011 and, in comparison with the bimolecular ester-
iﬁcation of phenol and acetic acid, by almost 1016 [5, 6]. The effect was attributed 
to a unique interlocking of methyl groups, which produces a severe conformational 
restriction of the side chain and increases greatly the population of the most produc-
tive conformer. To test the sensitivity of a chemical reaction to the orientation of the 
reacting atoms, the velocities of acid-catalyzed esteriﬁcation and γ-lactonizations 
were measured [6, 7]. Variation in orientation of the attacking oxygen atom relative 
to the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid was achieved by using bicyclic ring systems 
to limit the conformational mobility of the γ-hydroxy acids 
Factors as high as 2 × 104 were observed for the acceleration of a reaction due to 
this “orientation factor” even after corrections for proximity and torsional strain have 
been made. The enzymatic reaction of cytidine deaminase is an example of proximity, 
oriental, and concert effects in enzyme reactions [2]. Computer simulations of the 
cytidine deaminase reaction and its temperature dependence, using density functional 
theory calculations and an empirical valence bond description of the reaction, showed 
that: (1) Substrate binding is associated with a signiﬁcant entropy loss; (2) the latter 
closely matches the activation entropy penalty for the uncatalyzed reaction in water; 
(3) the activation entropy for the rate-limiting catalytic step in the enzyme is close 
to zero; and (4) the entropic activation parameters for the hydrolytic deamination of 
cytidine to uracil catalyzed by cytidine deaminase are TΔS‡ = 8.6 kcal/mol showing 
that the entropic penalty has totally vanished in the enzyme reaction.

Concerted Chemical Processes 
4.2.1 
Theoretical Consideration 
A concerted (synchronous) reaction is a chemical reaction in which all bond breaking 
and bond making occur in a single step. In order to explain the high efﬁciency of 
many chemical and enzymatic processes, the concept of energetically favorable, 
concerted mechanisms is widely used [7–14]. In a concerted reaction, a substrate is 
simultaneously attracted by different active donor and acceptor reagents such as acid 
and basic groups, nucleophile and electrophile, or reducing and oxidizing agents. It 
may, however, be presumed that certain kinetic statistic limitation exists on realization 
of reactions that are accompanied by a change in the conﬁguration of a large number 
of nuclei [8–14]. 
A concerted reaction can be modeled as a result of the simultaneous elementary 
transition (taking approximately 1013 s) of a system of n independent oscillators, 
with the mean displacement of nuclei w0, from the ground state to the activated state 
in which this displacement exceeds for each nucleus a certain critical value (wcr) [8]. 
The theory gives the following expression for the synchronization factor asyn, which 
is the ratio of preexponential factors synchronous and regular processes:

Analysis of Eq. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2 provides a clear idea of the scale of the synchro-
nization factor and dependence of this factor on the number of n and the energy 
activation (Fig. 4.2) [9]. For example, at moderate energy activation 20–30 kJ/mol, 
the incorporation of each new nucleus into the transition state can lead to about tenfold 
decrease in the rate of the process. The model of concerted processes discussed above 
is only a crude approximation of the motion of a complex system of nuclei along 
the reaction coordinate. However, such an approximation apparently permits one to 
estimate a scale of the reaction of interest and to choose from among the possible 
reaction mechanisms.
The competition between stepwise and concerted (CPET) pathways in certain 
chemical reactions was discussed on the bases of experimental kinetics and 
theoretical calculation [9–28].

Simple Molecules Reactions 
The concerted and the stepwise mechanisms of the Diels−Alder reaction between 
butadiene and ethylene, involving a [4π + 2π] cycloaddition between a diene, and 
an oleﬁn (dienophile) 
were studied by ab initio MO methods [14, 15]. For the concerted mechanism, the 
energy barrier height of the transition state was found to be 2.7 kcal/mol lower than 
that of the formation of biradical intermediate with a transition state in the stepwise 
mechanism. The CiLC−IRC analysis indicated the nature of the aromaticity for the 
transition state of the concerted mechanism. It was shown that in the case of cyclo-
propanes substituted with donor–acceptor (DA) groups, a synergistic effect occurs 
due to the “pushpull effect” of substituents [15, 16]. The concerted and the stepwise 
mechanisms of the Diels–Alder reactions of butadiene with silaethylene and disilene 
were studied by ab initio MO methods [16, 17]. For this reaction, the activation energy 
barrier of the concerted-type transition state constrained with Cs symmetry was found 
to be about 9 kcal/mol higher than that of the stepwise transition stat. For the reaction

of butadiene and silaethylene, an asymmetric concerted two stepwise processes can 
occur. Allenyl has the structure R2C=C=CR—where R is H or some alkyl group 
and enyne contain C−C double bond and C≡C triple bond. The C2–C6cyclization 
of enyne-allenes was studied by a combination of kinetic isotope effects, theoretical 
calculations, and dynamics trajectories [18]. For the cyclization of allenol acetate, the 
isotope effect (kCH3/kCD3 = 1.43) was interpreted in terms of a highly asynchronous 
transition state near the concerted stepwise boundary. This conclusion was supported 
by density functional theory calculations that locate a highly asynchronous transition 
structure for the concerted reaction. The stepwise mechanism and the asynchronous 
concerted mechanism start out geometrically similar, and the two pathways appear 
to have merged. 
The competition between stepwise and concerted (CPET) pathways in proton-
coupled electron transfer reactions in water was discussed on thermodynamic and 
kinetic bases (Fig. 4.3) It was found that in the case where water is the proton acceptor, 
the CPET pathway may compete favorably with the stepwise pathway. 
4.2.3 
Enzymatical Reaction 
The NAD+-dependent protein deacetylation catalyzed by Sir2 enzymes was char-
acterized employing method on-the-ﬂy Born−Oppenheimer molecular dynamics 
simulations with the B3LYP/6-31G(d) QM/MM potential and the umbrella method 
[20]. The results indicated that the nicotinamide cleavage reaction employs a highly 
dissociative and concerted displacement mechanism because (1) the cleavage of the 
glycosidic bond is facilitated by the nucleophilic participation of the acetyl-lysine, 
(2) the dissociative transition state has a signiﬁcant oxocarbenium ion character, and 
(3) during this step of the reaction, the Sir2Tm enzyme strongly stabilizes the cova-
lent O-alkylamidate intermediate. In addition, functional roles of key residues and 
motifs have been elucidated. Thymidylate synthase (TSase) catalyzes the intracel-
lular de novo formation of thymidylate (a DNA building block). Two mechanisms 
have been proposed for the rate-limiting hydride transfer step in TSase catalysis: 
a stepwise mechanism in which the hydride transfer precedes the cleavage of the 
covalent bond between the enzymatic cysteine and the product and a mechanism 
where both happen concertedly (Figs. 4.4 and 4.5) [20, 21]. These two possibili-
ties were tested using secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), mutagenesis study, 
and primary KIEs. In order to distinguish between the different mechanisms and to

examine the role of an arginine R (166) in the rate-limiting hydride transfer step, the 
following types of experimental investigations were carried out: (1) secondary (2°) 
kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements on C6 of dUMP, (2) mutation of R166; 
and (3) an examination of primary (1°) KIEs on the hydride transfer. Because the 
irreversible hydride transfer precedes the C6–S cleavage, in the stepwise mechanism 
(Fig. 4.4) no 2° KIE  on  kcat/KM for the conversion of compound D to dTMP was 
expected. For the concerted hydride transfer mechanism, the sp3–sp2 rehybridization 
of C6 from compound D to dTMP was predicted. Involving 13 heavy atoms in the 
thymidylate synthase (Tsase) catalysis, according to Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2, with suggested 
energy activation Esyn ≈ 5 and 10 kcalmol−1, would “cost” a decrease of the process 
probability by synchronization factor asyn ≈ 10−6 and 10−8, respectively, and the 
estimated reaction constant rate can be k ≈ 102 s−1 and 10−4 s−1, respectively, Thus, 
this consideration allows the concerted mechanism only if energy activation would 
be markedly less than 10 kcalmol-1 which agrees with experimental kinetic data [20, 
21]. 
Malic enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of Lmalate (1) to pyru-
vate (2) (Fig. 4.6) and this reaction could proceed via a stepwise (1 → 3 → 4) or 
concerted mechanism [23]. By measuring the isotope effect induced on V/K when 
C4 of malate is labeled with 13C, it was found that this effect was decreased from 
1.031 to 1.025, when 13C] malate was simultaneously labeled with a deuterium at 
C2. It was concluded that dehydrogenation of the C2 hydroxyl takes place prior to 
the elimination of CO2 in a stepwise mechanism.
Proline racemase catalyzes the racemization of proline 
() via two proton transfers at opposite faces of the proline αcarbon (Hydron transfers) 
[24], It was tested whether these Hydron transfers take place in one versus two steps 
by essentially measuring the solvent deuterium isotope effect on the net rate constant

4.3 
Principle of “Optimum Motion” and Mechanism 
of Enzymatic Reactions 
According to the principle of least motion (PLM), when multiple species with 
different nuclear structures could theoretically form as products of a given chemical 
reaction, the least amount of change in nuclear structure or the smallest change in 
nuclear positions is expected [24, 25]. 
In the case of effective concerted mechanism, the decrease in the synchronization 
probability asyn (Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2, Fig.  4.2) with increasing n can be compensated 
for by an appreciable decrease in the activation energy due to the inclusion of nuclei 
of donor and acceptor groups in the process. This consideration has led us to the 
formulation of the principle of optimum motion (POM) [9–12]. According to this 
principle, the number of nuclei whose conﬁguration is changed in the elementary 
act of a chemical reaction (including electron transfer) must be sufﬁciently large to 
provide favorable energetic of the step and, at the same time, sufﬁciently small for 
the maintenance of a high value of the synchronization probability during motion 
along the reaction pathway to the reaction products., The formation of pretransition 
states can be preceded by a number of elementary steps or a concerted single step 
optimally combining enthalpy, entropy, and synchronization factors. POM allowed

discussion of alternative mechanism mechanisms of transformation of the pretran-
sition to the transition state in a number enzyme reactions [9, 25-29]. Beneath some 
chosen enzymatic systems will be analyzed. Typical values of enthalpies of acti-
vation for enzyme-catalyzed (kcat) and nonenzymatic (knon) reactions are presented 
in Table 4.1 It should be noted that the experimental values of the activation ener-
gies and entropies of enzymatic reactions may include corresponding parameters 
of preceding conformational transitions and water reorganization which can be the 
cause of the enthalpy–entropy compensation effect (Chap. 8) 
In the formate dehydrogenase reaction, as follows from Fig. 4.7 [25, 26], the 
transition from substrate to the transition state includes a change in the position of 
12 heavy atoms, namely, three formate atoms, eight NAD+ atoms, and two shifts of 
amino acid fragments of the enzyme. According to Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2 and Fig. 4.3, and 
taking into account a typical entropy activation in monomolecular step of enzymatical 
processes (about 8 J.K−1. mol−1 [27]), we have the values of k ≈ 10 s−1 and k ≈10−3 
s−1 f. or suggested energies activation of 4 kcalmol−1 and 8 kcalmol−1, respectively. 
Thus, for the given reaction, the concert mechanism is possible only if the activation 
energy is signiﬁcantly lower than 8 kcalmol−1.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) accelerates the oxidation of lactate by NAD + to 
pyruvate and NADH by hydride transfer from the C-4 carbon of NAD. Figure 4.8 
shows the active site of LDH with the bound substrate pyruvate and the NAD cofactor 
as derived from X-ray crystallographic data. This reaction is also a good example for 
the analysis of weather the process is stepwise or concerted [28]. As it is seen from 
Fig. 4.8, two atoms of substrate, six atoms of the nicotine ring (conversion of NADH 
to NAD+), all in all 8 heavy atoms, should change their position at the formation 
of the transition state. Equations 4.1 and 4.2 and Fig. 4.2 with experimental energy 
activation Esyn ≈ 10 kcal mol−1 [26, 28]. gives asyn ≈ 10−7 and the value of rate 
constant k ≈ 10−3 s−1. Accordingly, the concerted mechanism reaction has very 
low probability with above-mentioned value of the experimental energy activation, 
which deﬁnitely include the parameters of previous conformational processes.

Electron Transfer 
4.4.1 
First Grounds 
Electron transfer (ET) is one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental phenomena 
in chemistry, physics, and biology [29, 30–70]. As a light microscopic particle, an 
electron easily tunnels through a potential barrier. The Franck–Condon principle 
is applicable not only to the vertical radiative processes but also to nonradiative 
horizontal electron transfer. The Franck–Condon Principle describes states that when 
a molecule is undergoing an electronic transition, such as ionization, the nuclear 
conﬁguration of the molecule experiences no signiﬁcant change. The decisive step 
in the ﬁeld was taken by Marcus and his colleagues [30] and Hash [31, 32]. These 
authors articulated the need for readjustment of the coordination shells of reactants 
in self-exchange reactions and of the surrounding solvent to the electron transfer. 
According to the fundamental Marcus two-state model (Fig. 4.9) [31], the distortion 
of the reactants, products, and solvent from their equilibrium conﬁguration can be 
described by identical parabolas in reaction coordinate space for the initial and ﬁnal 
states shifted related to each other according to the driving force of the value of the 
process (DF0). 
Within the adiabatic regime (assuming strong electronic coupling, where the reso-
nance integral V > 200 cm−1), the Eyring theory of the transition state predicts that 
the value of the electron transfer rate constant is:

where λ is the reorganization energy deﬁned as the energy for electron excitation 
without distortion of the nuclear frame. The following relationships based on log 
kET − ΔG0 graphs were predicted from Eq. 4.3: (1)  λ > ΔG0, log  k increases if ΔG0 
decreases (normal Marcus region), (2) λ = ΔG0, the reaction becomes barrierless, 
and (3) λ < ΔG0, log k decreases with increasing driving force. 
The theory of nonadiabatic electron transfer when the resonance integral V less 
than 200 cm−1 was developed by Levich et al. [34, 35]. These authors, suggesting 
harmonic one-dimensional potential surface, proposed a formula for nonadiabatic

4.4.2 
Long-Range Electron Transfer 
Long-Range Electron Transfer (LRET) between donor (D) and acceptor (A) centers] 
can occur by three mechanisms: (1) direct transfer that involves direct overlap 
between electron orbitals of the donor and acceptor that can be described in the 
frame of the Marcus–Levich theory [29, 33], (2) consecutive electron jumps via 
chemical intermediates with a ﬁxed structure, and (3) superexchange via interme-
diate orbitals. Various aspects of the LRET) and coupling of electron transport with 
proton transport are discussed in the papers [9, 36–50] 
In the superexchange process [41], the nonadiabatic ET rate constant is strongly 
dependent on electronic coupling between the donor state D and the acceptor state 
connected by a bridge (V AB):

where V Aa and V aB are the couplings between bridge orbitals and acceptor and 
donor orbitals, respectively, and DEa is the energy of the bridge orbitals relative to 
the energy of the donor orbital. The summation over includes both occupied and 
unoccupied orbitals of the bridge. 
According to the approach of Onuchic and coworkers [46], for a pathway between 
bridged donor and acceptor groups, the coupling element can be written as

where V 0 is the coupling between the donor and the ﬁrst bond of the pathway and 
ei is a decay factor associated with the decay of electron density from one bond to 
another. 
The basic idea underlying our approach to LRET is an analogy between superex-
change in electron transfer and such electron exchange processes as triplet–triplet 
energy transfer (TTET) and spin exchange (SE) [47–49]. The spin exchange and 
TT phenomena may be considered an idealized model of ET without or with only 
a slight replacement of the nuclear frame. The proposed approach is based on the 
following considerations: (1) The experimental dependence of exchange parameters 
JTT and JSE on the distance between the exchangeable centers (Eq. 4.7) may be used 
for evaluating such dependences for the resonance integral V ET 2 in the ET equation; 
(2) All three integrals V ET 2, JSE, and JTT are related to the overlap integral (Si), 
which quantitatively characterizes the degree of overlap of orbitals involved in these 
processes

where Ri is the distance between the interacting centers and the distance decay 
constant bi is a coefﬁcient that characterizes the degree of the integrals decay; (3) 
In the ﬁrst approximation, a number of orbitals involved in an exchange process n 
= 2 for the ET and SE processes with the overlap of two orbitals and n = 4 for  
the TT process in which four orbitals overlap (ground and triplet states of the donor 
and ground and triplet states of the acceptor) therefore, bSE ≈1/2 bTT. As it is seen  
in Fig. 4.10, experimental data on the dependence of kTT and JSE on the distance 
between the centers (DR) lie on two curves, which are approximated by the following 
equation [9, 47]; 
k Subscri pt TT Basel
ine comma upper J Subscript SE Baseline proportional to exp left parenthesis minus beta normal upper Delta upper R right parenthesis
For systems in which the centers are separated by a nonconductive medium 
(molecules or groups with saturated chemical bond), bTT equals 2.6 Å−1, while 
For systems in which the radical centers are linked by conducting conjugated bonds, 
bSE is 0.3 Å−1. The  value of  bET and bSE ≈1/2 bTT (2.6 Å−1) may be estimated as 
1.3 Å−1.
The semiempirical approach for the quantitative estimation of the effect of 
bridging the group on LRET was applied to the analysis of experimental data on 
electron transfer in biological systems [47, 48]. As an example, experimental rate 
constants of ET (kET) in reaction centers of purple bacteria and PSI were plotted 
against the edge–edge distance I between the donor and acceptor centers [47] 
(Fig. 4.11). The dependence of log kET on R with bET ≈ 1.4 Å−1 is similar to 
bET ≈ 1.3 Å−1, predicted for long-distance superexchange orbital overlap through 
“nonconducting” media by the shortest pathway.

Several experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated that media 
states can affect long-range electron tunneling [50–60]. Numerous data convincingly 
proved that the transition of proteins can occur at a distance of at least 25 A° (Fig. 4.12) 
[50–52] Some theoretical aspects of the tunneling in various environments and in 
protein, in particular, were discussed in [46–60] First direct evidence for long-range 
electron tunneling through proteins was emerged by Gray and Winkler group in 1982 
work on cytochrome c modiﬁed with a RuIII(NH3)5 moiety coordinated to His33 
on the protein surface (Ru(His33)-Fe-cyt c) [50]. In a kinetics study, ﬂash photo-
chemical electron injection generated transient RuII(His33)-FeIII-cyt c that relaxed 
to the RuIII–FeII thermodynamic product with a time constant of 30 ms (−ΔG° 
= 0.2 eV). This ﬁnding was explained as a result of the tunneling long-distance 
electron transfer between redox centers separated by 15Å in the protein. A tech-
nique utilizing ﬂash photolysis to generate this key intermediate, thereby enabling 
to measure ET rates from the iron (I1)-heme to different ruthenium(II1) histidine-48 
acceptors in sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) was developed [57]. In this system, the 
closest donor–acceptor edge-edge distance was found to be also13 Å./
Insight into the physical mechanisms of short—and long-range biomolecular elec-
tron transfer was gained [51, 58]. The blue copper protein from Pseudomonas aerug-
inosa, azurin, immobilized at gold electrodes through hydrophobic interaction with 
alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the general type [-S-(CH2)n-CH3] 
(n = 4, 10, and 15) was employed [51, 58]. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry and a Marcus 
equation analysis were used to determine unimolecular standard rate constants and 
reorganization free energies for variable n, temperature (2–55 °C), and pressure (5– 
150 MPa) conditions. These experiments revealed that electron exchange at distance 
over ca. 12 Å is a direct ET process. All the ET data was described by using a single

reorganization energy (0.3 eV), however, the values for the enthalpies and volumes 
of activation were found to vary with n. 
Figure 4.13 shows that the logarithm of the optimal rates spanning 12 orders 
of magnitude for intraprotein electron transfer reactions as a function of the edge-
to-edge distance generates a linear relationship (Fig. 4.13) [60]. It appears that 
the protein medium acts as a relatively uniform barrier to electron tunneling with 
an average/b value of 1.7 Å. The rates of high driving-force ET reactions have 
been measured for 30 Ru(iamine)-labeled metalloproteins (Fig. 4.14) [51, 52]. Two 
important parameters were extracted from the data: a rate constant for ET at close 
contact (kET); and an exponential distance decay constant β (kET= kET e–β(r–r 0)) that 
describes the efﬁciency of the long-range coupling.
The electrochemical tunneling spectroscopy (ECTS) (Fig. 4.15) and molecular 
dynamics simulations were used to show that the current between cytochrome c (Cc) 
and the mitochondrial complex III (CIII), or cytochrome bc1 decays along more 
than 10 nm in the solution [55]. Human cytochrome c (hCc) forms a natural complex 
with the cytochrome c1 (Cc1) subunit of cytochrome bc1. ECTS experiments were 
performed at electrochemical potentials, in which pCc1 on the sample electrode 
is reduced (US = − 200 mV) and hCc on the ECTS probe is oxidized (UP = 
600 mV), resulting in a constant positive bias Ubias = UP–US = 800 mV. The distance 
decay values β were directly measured from the current at constant electrochemical 
potential. It was found that b and the calculated local barrier for electron transfer

which is an appearance of the pair of two charges (D+A−), where (D+) the cation-
radical is a strong oxidant and A− is the anion-radical is a strong reducing agent. The 
most important problems are to prevent fast recombination of D+ and A− centers 
of high chemical reactivity and to provide relatively long lifetime for these centers, 
involving it in subsequent chemical reactions eventually results in the formation of 
stable compounds such as ATP and NADPH. 
In 1975 the author of this monograph has suggested that rapid electron transfer 
in reaction centers in the forward direction and signiﬁcantly slower transfer in 
the reverse direction may account for the cascade structure of RC which provides 
tunneling (long-distance) mechanism. [61]. A key of this concept was an assumption, 
which RC brings about positioning of donor and acceptor pigments in the cascade at 
optimum distances. A basic idea underlying above-mentioned mechanism included 
the following assumptions: (1) The primary donor (D) and several acceptor (Ai) 
centers compose a cascade in an ordered structure, in which all these centers are 
placed at an optimum distance (6–10 Å) from each other and are separated by a 
nonconducting protein medium; (2) such a separation slows down the forward elec-
tron transfer between adjacent D–A1 and Ai–Ai+1 pairs as compared to electron 
transfer in a system with close contacts between the centers; (3) the direct transfer 
can be sufﬁciently fast, if the optimum distances do not exceed 6–10 Å; (4) the 
recombination of each D+–Ai− pair becomes slower and slower as Ai moves away

from the donor; and (5) in contrast, in the system of tightly packed centers the recom-
bination rate is expected to be very fast. The cascade tunneling hypothesis has been 
supported in subsequent combined physical experiments reported in [62–68]. 
In 1984, after having analyzed the X-ray diffraction pattern from the reaction 
center crystals, Nobel Prize winners Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber, and Hartmut 
Michel presented the three-dimensional structure of the reaction center, the ﬁrst 
high-resolution structure of a membrane protein] https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/

arrangement of key pigments at optimal distances from each other as was predicted 
i in 1975 [61]. Later, the cascade structure was also conﬁrmed in X-ray studies of 
the reaction centers of Photosystem I and Photosystem II at 2.5 Å resolution [70], 
Recently the ﬁrst structure of a homodimeric type I RC, an X-ray crystal structure at

4.4.3.2
Light Harvesting Antenna 
Photosynthesis in photosynthetic reaction centers begins when light is absorbed by 
an antenna pigments which can be a (bacterio) chlorophyll, carotenoid, or open 
chain tetrapyrrole depending on the type of organism [78]. The light harvesting 
antenna (LHA) is “designed” by the Nature to increase the efﬁciency of light absorp-
tion in the photosynthetic systems of bacteria and plants. The accumulation of light 
energy and its delivery to chlorophyll of reaction center is carried out by the mech-
anism of transfer of energy from the pigment (mostly chlorophyll) in the excited 
singlet state to the singlet level of the neighboring pigment in the ground state. 
According to Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (E) (FRET) theory (https://en.wik

side on a C2S2M2 supercomplex from A. thaliana. Based on the projection map of C2S2M2 at 12 Å 
resolution, a model of the 3D structure of the supercomplex was reconstructed (using the crystal 
structures of PSII core and LHCII). For the minor antenna complexes, the structure of a monomer 
of LHCII was used while the pigment composition/occupancy was assigned based on the results of 
mutation analysis experiments on in vitro reconstituted complexes [72]. Published under the terms

be the optimal distance apart, appropriately aligned and have overlapping spectra 
for ﬂuorescence and absorption; and (3) the system should be organized with a 
thermodynamic gradient from antenna to reaction center (an energy “funnel”). 
An example would be light harvesting antenna (LHA) as a model of a plant 
PSII supercomplex [72]. In a supercomplex of a plant PSII, the reaction center is 
enclosed by an overall elliptically shaped LH1 consisting of 15 αβ-apoproteins, each 
accommodating two BChl a molecules. The LHA main core is surrounded by outer 
light harvesting complexes (Lhcs), together forming the supercomplexes (Fig. 4.16) 
which are complemented by some “extra” Lhcs.

Bacterial Photosynthetic Reaction Center 
The reaction center of photosynthetic bacteria (RCPB) is composed of four protein 
subunit. The structure showed the precise arrangement in the L and M subunits of 
the photochemically active groups—two chlorophyll molecules forming a dimer, 
serving in exited states as the primary electron donor, two monomeric chlorophylls,

two pheophytin molecules, one quinone molecule, called QA and a second quinone 
molecule, QB, and one iron ion (Fe) (Fig. 4.17) [78, 79]). The arrangement of electron 
transfer cofactors in the wild-type Rba. sphaeroides RC in two pseudo-symmetrical 
membrane-spanning wires is shown in the Figure. The ET chain in heliobacterial RC 
(HbRC) contains three chemically distinct BChls being on the P-side P800, a BChl 
g′ dimer that serves as the primary electron donor, and ending on the N-side with FX, 
a [4Fe-4S] cluster, that serves as the terminal acceptor [71]. Two different models for 
charge separation can be proposed: one in which Acc serves as the initial acceptor 
(HbRC*→ P800+ Acc– →P800+ A0 —→P800+ FX—) and one in which Acc serves 
as the initial donor (HbRC*→ Acc+ A0 —→P800+ A0 —→P800+ FX—). A0 is the 
primary acceptor in the HbRC the primary acceptor in the HbRC. 
The basis of asymmetric charge separation and the blockage in photocurrent gener-
ation by the AM260W mutation is explored in (Fig. 4.18) (see details in the Capture).
Fig. 4.17 a Two wires of cofactors connect the P-side (positive terminus) and Q-side (negative 
terminus) of the wild-type RC. Photoexcitation of the P dimer triggers electron ﬂow along the A-wire 
(red arrows) forming, sequentially, P+BA−, P+HA−, and  P+QA− radical pairs. Electrons exit the 
complex via the dissociable QB ubiquinone. b Overlay of the X-ray crystal structures of the wild-type 
and AM260W mutant RCs shows that replacement of Ala M260 by Trp prevents incorporation of 
the QA ubiquinone due to steric overlap (top), breaking the A-wire (bottom). c Similarly, replacement 
of Ala M149 by Trp prevents incorporation of the HB BPhe (top), breaking the B-wire (bottom).

This arrangement provided relevant redox potentials on the two cofactor wires. The 
process is initiated by the formation of the ﬁrst singlet electronic state of a “special 
pair” (P) of bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) located close to one side of the membrane 
(P-side). A dissociable ubiquinone (QB) on the opposite side (Q-side) is then reduced 
in a four-step process involving a “redox wire” comprising a monomeric BChl (BA), 
a bacteriopheophytin (BPhe—HA) and a nondissociable ubiquinone (QA). 
4.4.3.4
Photosystems I and II 
Photosystem I and photosystem II are the two multi-protein complexes that contain 
the pigments necessary to harvest photons and use light energy to catalyze the primary 
photosynthetic endergonic reactions producing high energy compounds [62–95] 
(Fig. 4.19). In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, plant and green bacteria, the reac-
tion centers of two systems Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II (PS II) convert 
the absorbed light energy into energy of stable products. Ferredoxin in reduced state 
and dioxygen PS I from plants and cyanobacteria mediates light-induced electron 
transfer from plastocyanin to ferredoxin (ﬂavodoxin) at the stromal membrane side, 
while PS II is a photoenzyme that catalyzes oxidation of the water in a water-splitting 
Mn-containing system. Subsequent absorption of four light quanta by PS I and PS 
II results in evaluation of dioxygen from two water molecules.

Plants, algae, and some bacteria use two photosystems, PSI with chlorophyll 
P700 and PSII with chlorophyll P680. The following principle steps in this unique 
physicochemical system for converted light energy are: (1) Using light energy, PSII 
acts ﬁrst to channel an electron through a series of acceptors that drive a proton pump 
to eventually generate ATP; (2) the electron passes on to PSI; (3) second photon 
of light captured by P700 provides the required energy to channel the electron to 
ferredoxin, generating reducing power in the form of NADPH; and (4) after the 
photoexcitation of the primary donor, a dimer of chlorophyll a (Chla)2, P700, an 
electron is transferred via a chlorophyll (A0) to a phylloquinone (A1) and then to the 
iron sulfur clusters, Fx, FA, and FB. The primary donor, P680, of PS II is the  most  
oxidizing of any RC discovered thus far with an Em of ∼ 1,200 mV [80]. The crystal 
structure of the complete photosystem I (PSI) from higher plants to 4.4 A° and 3.3 A° 
resolution was determined [70]. 
PS I from S. elongates contains nine protein subunits featuring transmembrane □-
helices and three stromal subunits. The organic cofactors are arranged in two branches 
along the pseudo-C2 axis [81]. The distances between adjacent donor and acceptor 
centers of the system vary from 8.2 to 14.9 Å for the “right” brunch (A) and from 
8.6 to 22 Å for the “left” brunch (B) (Fig. 4.20). Therefore, “nonconducting” zones 
are similar to those in the bacterial RC separate the centers. The crystal structure of 
the complete photosystem I (PSI) from higher plants to 4.4 A° and 3.3 A° resolution 
was determined [81]. Figure 4.20 shows a schematic picture of the structure of the 
trimeric Photosystem I based on the structure of the complex at 2.5 Å resolution as 
well as spectroscopic and biochemical data [85].

trimeric Photosystem I as viewed from the stromal side (a, c) and lumenal side (b, d) onto the 
membrane plane. One trimeric complex consists of 3 · 12 proteins (shown in a backbone repre-
sentation) to which 3 · 127 cofactors are noncovalently bound. The molecular weight of the whole 
trimeric Photosystem I complex exceeds 1000,000 Da. The center of one monomeric unit is built by 
the large subunits PsaA (silver) and PsaB (orange), which are shown in a cartoon representation with 
alpha helices shown as columns and beta sheets as arrows. The small membrane intrinsic subunits 
are depicted in a ribbon representation: PsaF is shown in ice blue, PsaI in purple, PsaJ in blue, PsaK 
in tan, PsaL in pink, PsaM in mauve and PsaX in ochre. The membrane extrinsic stromal proteins 
are depicted in: yellow (PsaC), cyan (PsaD), and lime (PsaE). The 96 chlorophylls per monomer 
are depicted in green, except the six chlorophylls of the electron transfer chain, ETC, which are 
shown in red. Further pigments are: two phylloquinones of the ETC (orange) and the three FeS 
clusters (yellow/S and red/Fe). The carotenoids can be seen in black, and the four lipids that have 
been identiﬁed in the structure are cyan. The colors are the same in all panels. a View of PS I from 
the stromal side. The stromal hump that contains the three extrinsic proteins PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE 
is outlined in black. It provides the docking site for ferredoxin (indicated by black arrows). PsaC 
forms the center of the stromal hump; PsaD is located close to the trimerization domain, and PsaE 
is located on the distal side of the hump; b depicts the PS I trimer as it can be seen from the lumenal 
side of the membrane. The black oval marks the potential docking site for the soluble electron donor 
proteins plastocyanin or cytochrome c6. The chlorophylls of the primary electron donor P700 can 
be partially seen below the prominent surface helices that provide the main interaction site for the 
soluble electron carriers; c shows a magniﬁcation of the trimerization site from the stromal side. The 
main contacts in the middle of the trimer (the trimerization domain) are provided by the three PsaL 
subunits (pink) of the respective monomers. Other proteins, such as PsaD (cyan), PsaI (purple), or 
the membrane intrinsic PsaM (mauve), are forming further contacts between the monomers, either 
directly or indirectly by interaction with bridging cofactors or interaction with PsaL. The trimer-
ization domain contains several chlorophylls that are organized in a “circle” around PsaL and can 
serve as sites for excitation energy transfer between different monomers; d depicts a lumenal view 
of the trimerization domain. The three calcium ions are especially remarkable. Calcium has been 
shown to be important for the trimerization of PS I. These three calcium ions engage in hydrogen 
bonds with PsaL and PsaA of one monomer and PsaL of the other monomer (as depicted within 
the area of the black circles [85] with permission fr. m Springer Nature

Magnetic Isotope Effects 
Magnetic isotope effects arise when a chemical reaction involves spin-selective 
processes proceeded via the radical pair mechanism [93–99]. The result is that 
some isotopes react preferentially, depending on their nuclear spin quantum number 
In contrast to classical isotope effect (CIE), which is governed by chemical energy 
of the starting and transition states of reactant molecules, this new isotope effect 
is controlled by magnetic interactions. The ﬁrst mass-independent isotope effect 
which chemically discriminates isotopes by their nuclear spins and nuclear magnetic 
moments rather than by their masses was detected in 1976 by Buchachenko et al.

[93–97] and by Sagdeev and Molin group [98]. This new phenomenon was indepen-
dently conﬁrmed within by the groups of Buchachenko, Turro and Pines, and others 
[94–97, 99]. In particular, on the basis of observed magnetic isotope and magnetic 
ﬁeld effects in enzymatic ATP synthesis catalyzed by magnesium ion, a new, ion-
radical mechanism of ATP synthesis was formulated [95–99], This mechanism was 
suggested for enzymatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and deoxynucleic acid (DNA) 
synthesis by using catalyzing metal ions with magnetic nuclei (25Mg, 43Ca, 67Zn) 
and supported by magnetic ﬁeld effects on these reactions [99].

Cytochromes P450 
5.1.1 
General Properties and Action Mechanism 
Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are a superfamily of enzymes containing heme as a 
cofactor that functions as monooxygenases with more than 11,500 isozymes. CP450 
(CYPs) are powerful enzyme hydroxylation systems of organic substrates, i.e., 
steroids, hydrocarbons, organic acids, alcohols, and amines, which operatives in 
animal and plant tissues and bacteria [1–15]. Historically, these enzymes received 
their name from “pigment 450” due to the unusual position of the Soret band in 
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the reduced CO-saturated state. 
Cytochromes contain protocheme IX as a cofactor. These enzymes catalyze 
oxidation processes according to the following general scheme: 
DH plus RH pl us upp er O S ubscript 2 Baseline right arrow ROH plus upper H Subscript 2 Baseline upper O plus upper D
where RH is the substrate and DH is the reducing agent (e.g., NADH) with the use 
of the appropriate reductase, as well as adrenodoxin, rubredoxin, and cytochrome 
b5. Dioxygen, being a weak one-electron oxidant, is activated after the reduction in 
the enzyme heme coordination sphere. 
Though hydroxylation of an organic substrate with dioxygen and biological 
reducing agents is thermodynamically favorable, serious energetic problems along 
the reaction pathway are expected. Dioxygen is a very weak one-electron reduc-
tant (E0 = − 0.3 eV) [6, 7]. and the energy gain in formation of O2-H bond is 
small. Therefore, dioxygen cannot abstract a hydrogen atom directly from such inert 
molecules as saturated hydrocarbons in ambient conditions and is activated after the 
reduction in the enzyme heme coordination sphere. Midpoint reduction potentials 
for native reducing agents (ferredoxin, ﬂavin cofactors in NADPH-cytochrome P450 
oxidoreductase) are determined as E0 = − 0.240 ÷ − 0.420 eV. Such potential is

sufﬁcient to reduce the cytochrome P450 heme iron Fe3+ to Fe+2 (E0 = − 0.410 eV), 
and dioxygen to H2O2 by two-electron mechanism (E0 for the transition O2 + H+ + 
2e at pH 7 is equal 0. 282 eV). H2O2 is essentially a stronger two-electron oxidizing 
reagent than those dioxygen in a one-electron process. Oxidation of a hydrocarbon by 
H2O2 with the formation of a hydroxylated product and water is a highly exothermic 
process. For instance, in the reaction H2O2 = H2O + O, the estimated loss of enthalpy 
is DH0 = 35,7 kcal/mole, whereas the oxygen atom insertion across the R-H group 
of hydrocarbons gains about 190 kcal/mole. The next thermodynamically allowed 
step in the cytochrome P450 reaction is a full or partial electron transfer from Fe+2 to 
H202 (the Fenton-like process) with the formation of a strong oxidant, whose center 
can be an analog of an OH radical with E0 = 2.7 eV. The appearance of such an active 
radical would immediately destroy chemical groups in the vicinity of an active site. 
Nevertheless, the Nature solved this problem by oxygen rebound mechanism for 
C−H hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450s. 
Information about the structure and activity of cytochromes obtained in different 
periods was summarized in reviews [4, 7–15]. 
A comprehensive review [10] summarized data on the mechanism of the 
cytochrome P450 catalyzed hydroxylation reaction available up to 2011. Separate 
sections have been devoted to the key intermediates of the process, namely the ferric 
resting and ferrous states, the oxygenated complex, the peroxo states of P450, and 
the Compound I and Compound II Ferryl-oxo Species and have been discussed in 
detail. 
Review [2] summed up the important results in this area presented in related 
articles published up to 2018

Crystal Structure 
Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H; CYP73A), a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 
uses NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase as a donor of electrons and hydroxylates 
cinnamic acid to form 4-coumaric acid in phenylpropanoid metabolism. In order 
to understand the structure and function of this class of plant P450 enzymes, the 
enzyme CYP73A33 was characterized [15]. The 1.7 Å resolution crystal struc-
ture of CYP73A33, along with the results of the steady-state kinetic analysis 
and the absorption spectroscopy titration were reported (Fig. 5.1). Obtained data 
suggest the presence of a putative allosteric substrate-binding site in a hydrophobic 
pocket on the enzyme surface. In addition, comparing the newly resolved structure 
CYP73A33 with those of well-investigated cytochromes P450 from mammals and 
bacteria enabled to identify residues of critical functional importance and revealed 
a unique sequence signature that is potentially responsible for substrate speciﬁcity 
and catalytic selectivity.

Figure 5.2 illustrates the size and shape of the substrate-binding pocket in P450 
isozymes based on the crystal structure extracts of protein databank (pdb) ﬁles 
for P450cam (2CPP pdb), (P450BM3) and (P4502D6) [16] and references therein. 
Speciﬁcally, P450BM3 binds long chain fatty acids and hydroxylates these at one of 
the carbon atoms in the terminus. P4502D6 has a more spherical substrate-binding 
pocket, and the P450s have a substrate-binding pocket with a size that is dependent 
on the P450 isozyme. P450cam, a camphor hydroxylating P450 isozyme, where atom 
C5 of the substrate is regioselectively hydroxylated, has a binding pocket that tightly 
binds camphor in a speciﬁc orientation that enables this reaction.
bullet CYP199A2, a cytochrome P450 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, 
oxidatively demethylates 4-methoxybenzoic acid to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. 4-
Ethylbenzoic acid converts to a mixture of predominantly 4-(1-hydroxyethyl)-
benzoic acid and 4-vinylbenzoic acid [17]. The crystal structure of CYP199A2 
has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution. The experiment revealed the following: 
(1) The channel in the enzyme is hydrophobic except for the basic residue Arg246 
at the entrance, which may play a role in the speciﬁcity of this enzyme for charged 
benzoates over neutral phenols and benzenes; (2) the substrate-binding pocket is 
hydrophobic; (3) computer docking of 4-ethylbenzoic acid into the active site 
suggested that the substrate carboxylate oxygens interact with Ser97 and Ser247; 
and (4) the beta-methyl group is located over the heme iron by Phe185, the side 
chain of which is only 6.35 Å above the iron in the native structure.

Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H; CYP73A) forms 4-coumaric acid in phenyl-
propanoid metabolism. In order to understand the structure and function of class of 
plant P450 enzymes, the C4H; CYP73A using NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase 
as a donor of electrons the enzyme were characterized [15]. The obtained structural 
information on the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structure of cinnamate 4-hydroxylase 
(CYP73A3, along with the results of the steady-state kinetic analysis and the absorp-
tion spectroscopy titration, displays a high degree of similarity of the structural and 
functional features of C4H to those of other P450 proteins. The data also suggest the 
presence of a putative allosteric substrate-binding site in a hydrophobic pocket on 
the enzyme surface

Mechanism and Active Cite Structure 
As is depicted in Figs. 5.3 and 5.4, the catalytic cycle of the cytochromes P450 
includes eight distinct states, with three different formal oxidation states of iron, 
namely (Fe2+, Fe3and Fe4+). [10, 14] Active intermediates in heme monooxygenase 
reactions were revealed by cryoreduction/annealing and EPR/ENDOR studies [7]. 
Review [7, 8] described the use of cryoreduction/annealing EPR/ENDOR techniques 
for determining the active oxidizing species in reactions catalyzed by heme monooxy-
genases. The three candidate heme states are: ferric peroxo, ferric hydroperoxo, and 
compound I intermediates. Include cytochromes P450, nitric oxide synthase and 
heme oxygenase was also discussed. Key steps of the catalytic cycle of cytochrome 
P450 are: (1) The substrate-free form is an aquo/hydroxo entity, dioxygen (super-
oxide) in the oxygenated complex, peroxo-dianion, or protonated hydroperoxide 
compound 0 (Cpd 0) in {5a, 5b}; (2) after cleavage of the dioxygen bond and release 
of water, the higher valent “oxo” state compound I(Cpd I) contains a single oxygen 
atom {6}; and (3) following oxygen atom transfer to substrate, there are potential 
transient complexes with the product molecule prior. 
The general catalytic cycle for oxygen reduction is shown in Fig. 5.4, which 
starts with the binding of O2 to a ferrous heme to afford a ferric-superoxo adduct, 
followed by reduction to ferric−hydroperoxo, and high-valent, iron−oxo (ferryl) 
intermediates via O−O bond scission.

The oxygen rebound mechanism (Fig. 5.5), ﬁrst proposed by Groves in the 1970 
[18] 5297 invoked the oxoiron(IV) porphyrin cation radical, compound I, as the active 
oxygen species. Compound I was proposed to activate aliphatic C−H substrates 
via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to the ferryl oxygen. Subsequently, the incip-
ient substrate radical recombines with the Fe(IV)−OH of compound II (oxygen 
rebound) to afford hydroxylation products. The main catalytically active intermediate 
in cytochrome P450s enzymatic cycle is the Compound I (P)Fe(IV)=O, ferryl-oxo 
complex possessing a π-cation radical localized on porphyrin ring.
Figure 5.6 gives the orbital shapes and Cpd I and Cpd II occupation numbers.
A whole arsenal of physicochemical methods is widely used to study the struc-
ture and mechanism of action of cytochromes P450. Spectroscopic studies of the 
cytochrome P450 reaction mechanisms were the focus of the review [2]. Classical 
spectroscopic methods, such as electronic absorption (UV-Vis), electron paramag-
netic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron nuclear double 
resonance (ENDOR), Mössbauer, X-ray absorption (XAS), resonance Raman (rR) 
in the combination of with novel approaches, such as cryoreduction and nanodisc 
technology have been proved to be powerful tools in providing detailed mechanistic 
insights into the biophysics and biochemistry. Below are examples of the use of 
physicochemical methods to study the details of the structure and mechanism of 
action of cytochromes P450. 
Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of cytochrome P450 BM-3 
in complex with N-palmitoylglycine (NPG) were employed to study of conforma-
tional change occurs in the active site of the complex where the terminal atoms of 
the ligand move from a site distant from the heme iron [21]. The population of the 
proximal state was found to increase with temperature in agreement with UV−vis

absorbance and NMR measurements. The conformations were characterized by X-
ray crystallography and computer modeling. The observed increase in the population 
of proximal conformations indicated that the proximal state is stabilized by confor-
mational entropy. The temperature weighted histogram (T-WHAM) method was used 
to characterize the transition state regions of the conformational ensemble. 
Heme protein cryoreduction is a process of formation of freeze-trap dioxygen 
adducts of heme proteins within an aqueous buffer containing glycerol (Fig. 5.7) 
[2]. The process using the 60Co nuclide as source of γ-rays (~ 4 Mrad) included the 
following steps: (1) Upon subsequent irradiation with γ-rays at 77 K or lower temper-
ature, free-electrons and organic radicals are produced; (2) the electrons, migrate

to the Fe-O-O fragment, while other movements, including proton transport, are 
generally restricted at 77 K and the freeze-trapped Fe-O-O− fragment is generated; 
(3) the sample can be then annealed to permit proton transfer, thereby generating a 
trapped hydroperoxo-heme fragment (Fe-O-O-H); (4) subsequent annealing to higher 
temperatures allowed delivery of another proton to facilitate O-O bond cleavage and 
formation of Compound I or Compound II species; and (5) cryoradiolyticaly gener-
ated intermediates can then be studied by EPR, ENDOR, Mössbauer, UV-Vis, and 
resonance Raman spectroscopies. 
It was also shown that substrate binding to the six-coordinate low-spin (LS) ferric 
enzyme displaced the water cluster coordinated as the sixth ligand of the heme 
iron and changes the spin state to the ﬁve-coordinate high spin (HS). The 5cHS 
ferric substrate-bound form exhibited more positive reduction potential, rising by 
80–130 mV, resulting in much easier reduction to a ferrous state. 
Work [23] extended the characterization of bacterial reductase from Bacillus 
megaterium (3A4-BMR) chimeras using differential scanning calorimetry to eval-
uate stabilizing role of BMR. A chimeric molecule is an engineered construct in 
which two or more components are linked to form a novel biological agent. The 
“molecular Lego” approach to CYP19A1 (aromatase) and the data showed that the 
activity of the chimeras is very low (0.003 min−1) for all the constructs tested with a 
different linker loop length: ARO-BMR, ARO-BMR-3GLY, and ARO-BMR-5GLY. 
The “Lego” approach is based on pulling the proteins apart and rebuilding them, 
segment by segment. In contrast, the fusion to BMR showed a remarkable effect 
on thermal stability studied by differential scanning calorimetry as indicated by the 
increase in T onset by 10 °C and the presence of a cooperative unfolding process driven 
by the BMR protein domain.

Pressure-induced transitions in the heme domain of cytochrome P450BM3 
(P450BMP) were studied versus the concentration of palmitic acid [24]. The experi-
ments indicated that: (1) An increase in hydrostatic pressure causes a high-to low-spin 
shift and subsequent P450 to P420 transition. which was associated with important 
conformational and hydration changes of the protein; (2) the interactions of P450 
2B4 (2B4) and P450BMP with their substrates (benzphetamine and palmitic acid) 
were accompanied by larger changes in the partial volume of the proteins ( + 267 
and + 248 mL/mol, respectively) than the interactions of P450cam with camphor 
( + 106 mL/mol); (3) the reaction volumes of the low- to high-spin transitions of the 
substrate-free cytochromes (20–23 mL/mol) were consistent with the displacement 
of one water molecule; and (4) the volume changes in the high- to low-spin transition 
of the substrate-bound P450cam, 2B4, and P450BMP were found to be − 90, − 49, 
and − 16 mL/mol correspondingly. 
Authors of work [25] used high hydrostatic pressure in combination with spin 
labeling, ESR, and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy as a tool for exploring the conforma-
tional landscape of human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Points of incorporation 
of the environment-sensitive EPR label (MTSSL) and ﬂuorescent probe (MDCC) are 
indicated in Fig. 5.8. Site-directed incorporation of a luminescence resonance energy 
transfer donor–acceptor pair allowed to identify a pressure-dependent equilibrium 
between two states of the enzyme. Increase in pressure increased the spatial separa-
tion between the two distantly located ﬂuorophores. The transition is characterized 
by volume change (ΔV°) and P1/2 values of − 36.8 ± 5.0 mL/mol and 1.45 ± 
0.33 kbar, respectively, which corresponds to a Keq° of 0.13  ± 0.06, This pressure-
promoted displacement of the equilibrium is eliminated by the addition of testos-
terone, an allosteric activator. Using site-directed spin labeling demonstrated that: 
(1) The testosterone-sensitive transition is revealed by pressure-induced changes in 
the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of a nitroxide side chain placed at posi-
tion 85 or 409 of the enzyme; (2) an effector-dependent conformational equilibrium 
between open and closed states of CYP3A4 occurs; and (3) the process involves a 
pronounced change at the interface between the region of α-helices A/A’ and the 
meander loop of the enzyme, where residues 85 and 409 are located. Points of incor-

An approach to study protein-protein interactions, using Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy in combination with titration experiments and principal compo-
nent analysis (FTIR-TPCA), was developed [26]. The FTIR-TPCA results were 
obtained for the interaction between cytochrome P450 and the redox partner protein 
in two P450 systems, the Pseudomonas putida P450cam (CYP101) with putidare-
doxin (P450cam-Pdx), and the Bacillus megaterium P450BM-3 (CYP102) heme 
domain with the FMN domain (P450BMP-FMND). The structural changes that occur 
upon redox partner complex formation involved the following: (1) An increase in 
beta-sheets and alpha-helix content; (2) a decrease in the population of random coil/ 
3(10)-helix structure; (3) a redistribution of turn structures within the interacting 
proteins; and (4) changes in the protonation states or hydrogen-bonding of amino 
acid carboxylic side chains. 
Many substrates and inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) monoxygenses alter 
the spin state of the ferric heme by displacing the heme’s axial water ligand in the 
resting enzyme to yield a ﬁve-coordinate iron complex, or they replace the axial water 
to yield a nitrogen-ligated six-coordinate iron complex [27]. Pulsed and continuous 
wave (CW) EPR demonstrated that water-bridged complexes are common among a 
range of nitrogenous drugs or drug fragments that bind to CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. Prin-
cipal component analysis revealed a distinct clustering of CW EPR spectral param-
eters for water-bridged complexes. CW EPR indicated heterogeneous mixtures of

5.1 Cytochromes P450

ligated states, including multiple directly-coordinated complexes and water-bridged 
complexes. 
Crystallographic and kinetics studies have shown that the F429H mutation of 
cytochrome P450 2B4 introduced an H-bond between His429 and the proximal thio-
late ligand, Cys436. The mutation did not alter the protein fold but sharply decreases 
the enzymatic activity and stabilizes the oxyferrous P450 2B4 complex [28]. To 
characterize the inﬂuence of hydrogen bond on the states of the catalytic cycle of 
the radiolytic cryoreduction combined with EPR and (electron nuclear double reso-
nance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to study were employed. Analysis experimental data 
revealed a number important ﬁndings: (1) The addition of an H-bond to the axial 
Cys436 thiolate signiﬁcantly changes the EPR signals of both low-spin and high-
spin heme iron(III) and the hyperﬁne couplings of the heme-pyrrole 14N; (2) change 
of H ENDOR spectra of the water ligand in the six-coordinate low-spin ferriheme 
state indicated that the H-bond introduced between His and the proximal cysteine 
decreases the extent of S → Fe electron donation and weakens the Fe(III)-S bond; 
(3) the added H-bond changes the primary product of cryoreduction of the Fe(II) 
enzyme, which is trapped in the conformation of the parent Fe(II) state; (4) in the 
wild-type (WT) enzyme, the added electron localizes on the porphyrin, generating 
an S = (3)/2 state with the anion radical exchange-coupled to the Fe(II); (5) the 
additional H-bond has little effect on g values and 1H-14N hyperﬁne couplings of 
the cryogenerated, ferric hydroperoxo intermediate but noticeably slows its decay 
during cryo-annealing; (6) in both the WT and the mutant enzyme, this decay showed 
a signiﬁcant solvent kinetic isotope effect, indicating that the decay reﬂected a proton-
assisted conversion to Compound I (Cpd I); (7) Cpd I is formed during the annealing 
of the cryogenerated hydroperoxy intermediate; and (8) there is the active hydrox-
ylating species in both WT P450 2B4 and the F429H mutant; and (8) the added 
H-bond of the mutation diminished the reactivity of Cpd I. 
The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP119, its compound II derivative, and its 
nitrosyl complex were studied by iron K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
employing Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory at temper-
atures below 140 (K) [29]. The compound II derivative was prepared by reaction 
of the resting enzyme with peroxynitrite and had a lifetime of ≈10 s at 23 °C. The 
CYP119 nitrosyl complex was obtained by reaction of the enzyme with nitrogen 
monoxide gas or with a nitrosyl donor and was stable at 23 °C for hours. The X-
ray absorption near-edge structure spectra displayed shifts in edge and pre-edge 
energies consistent with increasing effective positive charge on iron in the series 
native CYP119 < CYP119 nitrosyl complex < CYP119 compound II derivative. The 
obtained structural features for the compound II derivative were an iron-oxygen bond 
length of 1.82 Å and an iron-sulfur bond length of 2.24 Å, both of which indicate an 
iron-oxygen single bond in a ferryl-hydroxide, FeIVOH, moiety.

Pulsed EPR methods were employed for the study of drug binding to heme-thiolate 
enzymes such as cytochrome P450 and nitric oxide synthase [30]. Pulsed Hyperﬁne 
Sublevel Correlation Spectroscopy (HYSCORE) and ENDOR methods to measure 
1H of axial ligands of the heme group were described. The experiment illustrated 
water serving as the axial ligand in the drug-free enzyme and ligands coordinating 
directly to the heme or through one or more bridging water molecules. It has been 
shown by absorbance spectroscopy that the CYP3A4 substrate testosterone (TST) 
induced spin state changes that are characteristic of a low-spin to high-spin conversion 
[31]. The thermodynamic landscape of testosterone binding to cytochrome P450 3A4 
including ligand binding and spin state equilibria was established. EPR was employed 
to investigate the equilibrium binding of TST to CYP3A4 at [CYP3A4] > K(D), 
allowing for characterization of the singly occupied state (i.e., CYP3A4.TST). The 
observance spectroscopy was used to examine equilibrium binding, which was found 
to be positively cooperative with respect to ligand-dependent spin state conversion. 
Thus, an analysis of the EPR and absorbance spectral results suggested that the 
binding of the second TST induces a shift to the high-spin state and that the second 
TST binding causes displacement of the bound water. 
Solution magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of P450terp were compared 
with spectra of other P450 enzymes (e.g., P450cam, P450BMP, P450BM-3holo, and 
P450BM1), as well as with spectra of chloroperoxidase and NO synthase [32]. The 
following results were reported: (1) Upon substrate-binding, the MCD spectra of 
ferric P450terp and all other thiolate-ligated heme systems showed a strong Soret 
band; (2) the band position is unique relative to the typical Soret MCD pattern(s) of 
catalases or other 5-coordinate ferric heme systems; (3) this intense negative MCD 
feature can be diagnostic for cysteinate-linked ferric hemes; (4) in the case of ferrous 
P450s, the intensity of the Soret-region MCD varied between substrate-bound and 
substrate-free enzymes; (5) a ﬁnding was the clear spectral shifts of the Soret MCD 
band between the substrate-bound and substrate-free forms of ferrous-CO-P450terp; 
and (6) the band positions for both types of P450terp are red-shifted from known 
bands of ferrous-CO-P50cam.x 
The nanodisc approach utilizes an encircling amphipathic membrane scaffold 
protein (MSP) which can solubilize a circular fragment of phospholipid [9, 33–36]. 
Nanodiscs provide a powerful tool for a broad spectrum of biochemical and biophys-
ical studies of membrane proteins including P450 [9]. Nanodiscs are composed of 
phospholipids and an encircling amphipathic helical belt protein, termed a membrane 
scaffold protein (MSP) (Fig. 5.9) which can solubilize a circular fragment of phospho-
lipid. The initial MSP sequences were based on the Human ApoA1 protein compo-
nent of high density lipoprotein particles. Other proteins and peptides of similar 
amphipathic structure can also form discoidal bilayers. These include synthetic 
amphipathic peptides, apolipophorin, and other apolipoproteins. Empty nanodiscs 
and nanodiscs with membrane proteins (MP) can be assembled from a detergent 
solubilized mixture of all components by gradual removal of detergent via adsorption 
on hydrophobic beads or by dialysis (Fig. 5.10).

The demonstration of the nanodiscs approach was reported when microsomal 
membranes from Sf9 cells overexpressing cytochrome P450 CYP6B1 from black 
swallowtail butterﬂy (Papilio polyxenes) were solubilized in cholate and used 
for nanodisc assembly [34, 36]. Direct assembly of nanodiscs from the native 
membranes, described for the pig kidney a+, K+ ATPase, provided an active target 
solubilized in a lipid environment [35]. Refolding of membrane proteins in nanodiscs 
from an unfolded state via solubilization in SDS detergent was demonstrated by 
successful reconstitution of the homotetramer KcsA channel and bacteriorhodopsin. 
Review [8] provided a general discourse on nanodisc and its application to solu-
tion NMR. This method has been widely used to investigate the structure of nanodiscs 
and membrane proteins in nanodiscs. Various NMR methods have been used to study 
empty nanodiscs. Solid state NMR (ss-NMR) revealed the detailed structure of the 
encircling MSP, details of lipid-MSP interactions and some of the physiologically 
important interactions of lipid head-groups with cations in solution. The applica-
tion of nanodiscs for mechanistic studies of steroidogenic human cytochromes P450

using cryo-radiolysis was reported [9]. Enzymes CYP17A1 or CYP19A1 incorpo-
rated in nanodiscs at ambient conditions were investigated by stopped ﬂow mixing. 
Oxygenated cytochromes P450 was characterized by low-temperature spectroscopic 
methods, including UV-VIS absorption and resonance Raman scattering. The binding 
of cytochrome b5 to CYP2B4 assembled in nanodiscs using amphipathic 22-mer 
peptides was probed by NMR [36]. Reconstitution of the P450-cytb5 complex in 
peptide-based nanodiscs, containing no detergents, has been demonstrated and char-
acterized by size exclusion chromatography and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
NMR experiments were used to identify the binding interface of the P450-cytb5 
complex in the nanodisc. 
The interactions of NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) with 
full-length and truncated CYP2J2 were monitored by the kinetics of NADPH 
supported reduction in the ﬁrst electron transfer step [33]. The binding of CPR to 
human cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 incorporated in POPC nanodiscs was studied by 
size exclusion chromatography with monitoring of catalytic activity by the rate of 
NADPH reduction. It was found that CPR shuttles electrons from NADPH through 
the FAD and FMN-coenzymes into the iron of the prosthetic heme group of the 
CYP. In the course of these electron transfer reactions, CPR undergoes large confor-
mational changes open” and “compact” conformation detected by NMR and small-
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Fig. 5.11) [38]. In the open conformation, the solvent 
exposed FMN coenzyme favors efﬁcient transfer of electrons from FMN to the heme 
iron, while the compact conformation serves to facilitate FAD to FMN electron 
transfer. It was suggested that the rotating movement of the FMN-binding domain 
as mediated by the ﬂexible hinge could be a key mechanism to enable tight binding 
of CPR to CYPs in aNADPH-heme electron transfer compatible conformation. A 
rotation would allow CPR to remain bound to the CYP and shuttle electron transfer 
between the FADcoenzyme to theFMNcoenzyme and from the reduced FMN to the 
heme.
Several works use computer methods to solve cytochrome problems that cannot be 
solved by experimental methods alone. For example, a simulation method, random 
expulsion molecular dynamics was introduced. [39]. Substrate-exit channels from 
the buried active site were found by imposing an artiﬁcial randomly oriented force 
on the substrate, in addition to the standard molecular dynamics force ﬁeld [39]. The 
computation revealed that the pathways obtained by the random expulsion molecular 
dynamics method for simulations of the substrate-bound structure of cytochrome 
P450BM-3 and application to complexes of cytochrome P450cam with different 
substrates and with product matched with thermal motion pathways obtained by an 
analysis of crystallographic B-factors. In contrast to large backbone motions observed 
in cytochrome P450BM-3 for the exit of palmitoleic acid, passage of camphor 
through cytochrome P450cam only requires small backbone motions in conjunction 
with side chain rotations. A series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations 
to predict the 57Fe Mössbauer quadrupole splittings (DeltaEQ) and isomer shifts 
(deltaFe) for an Fe(IV)=O model compound ([Fe(O)(TMC)(NCCH3)](OTf)2, TMC  
= 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane, OTf = CF3SO3−) as well  
as a cytochrome P450 reaction intermediate (P450-RI) was carried out [40]. The DFT

predictions on the model compound were in agreement with experiment. The same 
DFT methods permitted good predictions of both DeltaEQ and deltaFe when using 
a geometry optimized structure having a porphyrin dianion, a protonated cysteine, 
and S = 1. 
In work [41], crystallography and molecular simulation to study the effect of single 
mutations on binding and regioselective metabolism of mefenamic acid by the heme 
domain of the protein M11 mutants were combined. A multistep approach was used 
that combines molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and binding 
free-energy calculations to address protein ﬂexibility. In this way, several important 
ﬁndings were obtained, namely: (1) Preferred binding modes that are consistent with 
oxidation at the experimentally observed sites of metabolism (SOMs) were identi-
ﬁed; (2) binding modes in line with the preferred SOMs of mefenamic acid by M11

and its mutants by including protein ﬂexibility and dynamics in free-energy compu-
tation were ranked; and (3) structural insights into the change in regioselectivity of 
mefenamic acid hydroxylation due to single active site mutations were demonstrated. 
Interactions between membrane-bound CYP 1A1, an antitumor drug target, and 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme monooxygenases (CPR) by a multiresolution compu-
tational approach were investigated [42]. The computation indicated that CPR may 
affect ligand passage to the CYP active site. It was also shown that in the complexes, 
the interactions of the CPR FMN domain with the proximal side of CYP 1A1 are 
supplemented by more transient interactions of the CPR NADP domain with the 
distal side of CYP 1A1. Several arrangements of CPR around CYP 1A1 that are 
compatible with ET were identiﬁed

Nitric Oxide Synthase 
5.2.1 
General 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a tiny molecule with enormous biological impact. NO mediates 
a large number of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes including vascular 
relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, regulation of endothelial cell adhesivity, 
preservation of the normal vessel wall structure, etc. [43–64] and references therein. 
The family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) has signiﬁcant importance in various 
physiological mechanisms and is also involved in many pathological processes. In 
physiological conditions, besides nitric oxide (NO), nNOS also produces hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O·−2O2·−). For example, in mammals, NO acts as 
an intercellular messenger in a variety of signaling reactions, as well as a cytotoxin 
in the innate immune response. 
Three isomers of the enzyme are intensively investigated: neuronal (nNOS), 
endothelial (eNOS), and cytokine-inducable (iNOS). NO is generated in an enzy-
matic process of oxidation of L-arginine (Arg) by dioxygen catalyzed nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS) in the presence of NADPH:

In the reactions, the hydroxylase domain of NOS containing heme, the cofactor 
tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), the reductase domain, containing FMN, FAD and 
NADPH, calmodulin (CaM), and the Arg binding site involved [43–53]. The reduc-
tase domain provides electrons for the active site reduction. Calmodulin lies between 
these two domains and promotes electron transfer from NADH to heme. The H4B 
cofactor is indispensable for coupled catalysis [44]. Active intermediates in heme 
mono reactions of NOC were revealed by EPR/ENDOR studies using cryoreduction/ 
annealing technique [61]

To provide a detailed understanding of the domain orientations and interactions 
in the iNOS holoenzyme complex, homology models and regulation of interdomain 
interactions by calmodulin in inducible nitric oxide synthase were proposed using 
previously solved crystal structures of the murine iNOS domains and CaM [55]. The 
higher-order domain architecture of iNOS is presented in Fig. 5.14 [61, 62]. For 
group I, two copies of the reductase homology model were docked manually into 
the corresponding terminal densities. In group II, one of the FMN subdomains is 
released from its interaction with the FAD/NADPH subdomain. Group III structures 
show conformations whereby one of the reductase domains and CaM have folded over 
to directly interact with the oxidase domain. In these conformations, CaM remains 
in the same position as in group II
Mammalian NO synthases domain organization is presented in Fig. 5.15. The  
structures and higher-order domain organization of all three NOS holoenzymes were 
examined [61]. Three NOS are composed of an N-terminal oxidase domain and a 
C-terminal reductase domain. Calmodulin (CaM) activates NO synthesis by binding 
to the helical region connecting these two domains. The structures of NOS with and 
without CaM bound are similar, consisting of a dimerized oxidase domain ﬂanked 
by two separated reductase domains.
The crystal structure of the rat nNOS reductase provided insight into the structural 
features and organization of the enzymes [55]. The structure revealed the extensive 
network of hydrogen bonds between the three cofactors and the protonation state of 
the FMN, which appeared as a semiquinone. In addition, inspection of the FMN/FAD 
domains interface indicated important hydrophobic contacts and salt bridges, espe-
cially between the Glu816 and Arg1229 residues, both conserved in cNOSs. Arg1400, 
present in both nNOS and eNOS (Arg1165), Fig. 5.16 schematically represents NOS 
reactivity.
The NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is indispensable for coupled catal-
ysis [44]. The rates couple/uncoupled catalysis and the monomer/dimer equilibrium 
were determined by measuring NADPH oxidation spectrophotometrically at 340 
nm. Citrulline synthesis, as the formation of [3H]-citrulline from [3H]-Arg, and by 
FPLC and low-temperature polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. In the 
case of uncoupling at the heme and at the ﬂavins, the absence of Arg and BH4 results 
in NOS monomerization, with the monomers incapable to sustain NO synthesis but 
still able to support uncoupled catalysis. Omission of Ca2+/CaM can completely 
block heme reduction. 
Cryoreduction/annealing- EPR/ENDOR experiments with the arginine-bound 
oxy NOS from Geobacillus stearothermophilus conﬁrmed that iron(IV)oxo 
porphyrin π-cation radical (Fe(IV)=O P+), Compound I (6) (Fig. 5.17), is the reactive 
heme species in the ﬁrst stage I of NO production, the hydroxylation of L-arginine to 
N-hydroxy–L-arginine (NOHA) [60, 61]. The experiment revealed that: (1) Cryore-
duction of ferrous oxy gsNOS complex with Arg (or N-Me-Arg) at 77K generates 
intermediate ferric hydroperoxo intermediate (FeIII-OOH 5); (2) the conversion of 5 
to 6 shows a large solvent kinetic isotope effect, sKIE ∼=8; (3) subsequent annealing 
of 5 at 145K generates the primary product state of reaction; (4) EPR/15N ENDOR 
spectroscopy shows NOHA coordinated to the ferric heme; (5) in the second stage

shown in red, and FAD and FMN are shown in navy blue. The progression of electron transfer can 
be observed by tracing the movement of the FMN subdomain in the gray monomer. In group I, the 
FMN subdomain is bound within the FAD/NADPH subdomain. In group II, CaM has docked to 
the oxidase domain, and the FMN subdomain has begun to pull away from the rest of the reductase 
domain. By group III, the FMN subdomain has also docked to the oxidase domain allowing electron 
transfer from FMN to the heme cofactor in the oxidase domain of the opposite (brown) monomer.

NADPH-binding and the FMN-binding subdomains. CaM binds to a small helical segment that 
connects the oxidase and reductase domain. Three linker regions connect these domains: linker-a is 
between the oxidase and the CaM-binding helix; linker-b is between the CaM-binding helix and the 
FMN subdomain; and linker-c is between the FMN subdomain and the FAD/NADPH subdomain. 
Although largely similar, each NOS isoform possesses a few unique features. iNOS is the smallest

the resulting enzyme intermediate goes on to form Fe(III)NOS, citrulline, and NO- /

product of reaction is expected to be the Fe(II)NO complex, formed by reaction of 
the Fe(III) heme with NO- /HNO; and (5) cryoreduction at 77K of ternary complexes 
of both oxy gsNOS and oxy eNOS with bound NOHA yields ferric peroxo inter-
mediate (4)(FeIII-O2 2−); and (6) annealing of the 4/NOHA complex for gsNOS

rate constants are indicated in Fig. 5.19. The experiment t showed hat: (1) A ferrous-

decay (12 s−1)) was equivalent to the rate of H4B radical formation (11 s−1) and the 
rate of Arg hydroxylation (9 s−1). oxidation, The authors have come to the reason-
able conclusion that H4B transfers electrons to the active site to form a center with 
strong oxidizing power. Figure 5.18 contains a mechanism for Arg hydroxylation

It was suggested that NOS ﬂavoprotein domain might reduce the H4B radical 
by utilizing the NOS heme porphyrin as a conduit to deliver the electron [64, 65]. 
To test model, in which NOS ﬂavoprotein domain might reduce the H4B radical by 
utilizing the NOS heme porphyrin as a conduit to deliver the electron (Fig. 5.19), a 
single catalytic turnover and stop-freeze methods, along with electron paramagnetic 
resonance spectroscopy were employed. This approach allowed to measure the rate 
and extent of reduction of the 5-methyl-H4B radical formed in neuronal NOS (nNOS) 
as a consequence of its catalyzing Arg hydroxylation. The experiments showed the 
rates and extents of nNOS heme reduction correlated with the rates and extents 
of 5-methyl-H4B radical reduction supporting a model where the heme porphyrin 
transfers an electron from the NOS ﬂavoprotein to the H4B radical formed during 
catalysis. 
A 10-step kinetic model, in which the ferric heme-NO enzyme forms as the 
immediate product of catalysis, and then partitions between NO dissociation versus 
reduction to a ferrous heme-NO complex, was introduced [56, 57]. Computer simu-
lations of the model described both pre-steady and steady-state features of nNOS 
catalysis, including NADPH consumption and NO production, buildup of a heme-
NO complex, changes between pre-steady and steady-state rates, and the change 
in enzyme K(m,O(2)) in the presence or absence of NO synthesis. In the frame of

model, catalytic turnover is regulated by the following two distinct features: (1) parti-
tioning of an immediate Fe(III) heme-NO product between a futile and productive 
regenerating pathway and (2) the relative rate of the futile regenerating pathway.

General 
In microorganisms utilizing methane, a methane-hydroxylating system, methane 
monooxigenase, (MMO) which catalyzed the reaction has been detected [65–92,

There are two distinct types of MMO, a soluble, cytoplasmic MMO (sMMO) and 
a membrane-bound, particulate MMO (pMMO) (Fig. 5.21). Both oxidize methane 
at metal centers within a complex, multisubunit scaffold, but the structures, active 
sites, and chemical mechanisms are different. The active site in sMMO contains a 
diiron center bridged by an oxygen atom (Fe-O-Fe), whereas the active site in pMMO 
utilizes copper. sMMO consist of three protein components for activity: a hydroxy-
lase (MMOH, 251 kDa), a reductase (MMOR, 38.5 kDa), and a regulatory protein 
(MMOB, 15.9 kDa). MMOH is responsible for methane oxidation. The pMMO 
hydroxylase consists of the pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits. Two mechanisms, 
general for both enzymes, suggested for the reaction between an active intermediate 
compound and the alkane: radical and nonradical has been discussed. The radical 
process starts with abstraction of the hydrogen atom from the substrate to form 
the free alkyl radical and proceeds via bound-radical mechanism. The nonradical 
mechanism implies a concerted incorporation of oxygen atom to the C–H bond 
of alkane pathway, occurring via a four-center transition state and leading to a 
“hydrido-alkyl-Q” compound.

Soluble Methane Monooxigenase 
To date more than 28 crystal structures of MMOH are known. The ﬁrst crystal 
structure of MMOH with a resolution of 1.7 Å was determined in 1993 [74, 76]. 
According to suggested model, the diiron active site located in each α subunit in the 
α2β2γ2 dimer within a four-helix bundle of which surface-exposed helices. Fe1 is 
coordinated by His147, Glu114, and a water molecule, and Fe2 is coordinated by 
His246, Glu243, and Glu209. The two iron ions are bridged by residue Glu144 and 
two hydroxides. Upon reduction, the Fe–Fe distance increases from ~3.1 Å to ~3.3

Å. For M. capsulatus (Bath) sMMO, the turnover number for methane is in the range 
of 0.2–1.0 s−1 at 45 °C. The Km value for methane is 0.94 µM and the Km value 
for O2 is ~16 µM. For M. trichosporium OB3b sMMO, turnover number of 3.7 s−1 
and the Km for methane is ~12 µM.47. at 30 °C and has been reported. Overall 
architecture of MMOs is displayed in Fig. 5.20. 
For the last three decades, the enzymes have been intensively investigated with 
the entire arsenal of biochemical, kinetic and physical methods [65–83]. Study [75] 
demonstrated the value of X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) and serial femto second 
crystallography (SFX) methods for investigating the structures of metalloenzymes 
with radiation sensitive metal active sites. Microcrystals of the sMMOH:MMOB 
complex from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b were exposed to X-XFEL pulses. 
Importantly, the≤35 fs duration of exposure of an individual crystal yields diffraction 
data before photoreduction-induced structural changes. 1.95 Å resolution crystal 
structures for the fully oxidized and fully reduced states of the sMMOH:MMOB 
complex were obtained. The results showed how the diiron cluster and the active

site environment are reorganized by the regulatory protein component in order to 
enhance the steps of oxygen activation and methane oxidation. 
Lower-resolution structures of the sMMOH:MMOB complex from the sMMO 
of Methylococcus capsulatus Bath revealed a series of cavities through sMMOH 
postulated to serve as the O2 conduit [76]. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures of 
the diferric and diferrous states of both sMMOH and the sMMOH:MMOB complex 
using the components from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b indicated a narrow 
molecular tunnel, termed the W308-tunne. This tunnel was found to be sized appro-
priately for O2 and traverses the sMMOH-MMOB interface. In the MMOB V41R 
variant of diferrous sMMOH:MMOB complex, the rate constant for O2 binding 
decreases by 25000-fold. This ﬁnding indicates the tunnel serving as the primary 
route for the transfer of O2 into the active site. In addition, the crystal structures 
showed that formation of the diferrous sMMOH:MMOB complex restricts access 
through the chain of cavities while opening the W308-tunnel.. 
In comprehensive review [73, 74], the following active site intermediates and 
steps leading to methane oxidation were described: (1) The resting state MMOH is 
reduced to MMOHred by MMOR; (2) molecular oxygen interacts with MMOHred to 
irreversibly bind O2O2 at the active site to form O (at this point, O2O2 is not 
directly bound to the diiron cluster); (3) O undergoes ligand substitution to yield an 
antiferromagnetically coupled diiron(III)-peroxo species (P*); (4) in a redox reaction 
the bridging peroxide is reduced and Fe(IV) is oxidized; (5) transfer of electrons 
yields antiferromagnetically coupled diiron(II)-peroxo species (P); (6) subsequently 
oxygen activation occurs via O-O bond cleavage within P to intermediate Q, which 
decays to catalyze methane oxidation; (7) species R forms with a methyl radical 
species and hydroxyl radical (·CH3) bound to the diiron cluster; (8) the radicals

recombine with oxygen inserted into a C–H bond to form species T; and (9) in a rate 
limiting step, species T decays into MMOHox and releases methanol (CH3OH). 
Recently, X-ray crystal structures were reported for the sMMOH complex with 
two double variants within the core region of MMOB, DBL1 (N107G/S110A), and 
DBL2 (S109A/T111A), as well as two variants in the MMOB N-terminal region, 
H33A and H5A [77] The experiment showed that: (1) DBL1 causes a 150-fold 
decrease in the formation rate constant of the reaction cycle intermediate P; (2) 
DBL2 accelerates the reaction of the dinuclear Fe(IV) intermediate Q with substrates 
larger than methane by three- to fourfold; (3) H33A slows P formation; (4) H5A AA 
slows both formation of Q and its reactions with substrates; (4) complexation with 
DBL1 or H33A alters the position of sMMOH residue R245, which is part of a 
conserved hydrogen-bonding network encompassing the active site diiron cluster 
where P is formed; (5) electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of sMMOH:DBL1 
and sMMOH:H33A complexes differ markedly from that of sMMOH:MMOB; (6) 
In the sMMOH:DBL2 complex, the position of M247 in sMMOH is altered such that 
it enlarges a molecular tunnel associated with substrate entry into the active site; and 
(7) The H5A variant causes only subtle structural changes despite its kinetic effects, 
emphasizing the precise alignment of sMMOH and MMOB required for efﬁcient 
catalysis. The kinetics of intermediate O conversion was monitored through the 
application of rapid freeze quench (RFQ) techniques [79]. In two chromophorically 
and electronically distinct intermediates (P* and P) the binding and activation of O2 
by the iron atoms occurs through a metal-to-ligand transfer of electrons. 
Geometric and electronic structures of a peroxo intermediate in the catalytic cycle 
of methane monooxygenase hydroxylase (MMOH) were examined utilizing spin 
density functional theory using 57Fe Mössbauer spectral parameters as a reference 
[81, 82]. Computed isomer shifts (δFe = +0.68, +0.66 mm s−1) and quadrupole split-
tings (ΔEQ = −1.49, −1.48 mm s−1) for the predicted structure were in agreement 
with experimental values of a peroxo MMOH intermediate. It was concluded that in 
the active site’s electronic structure, inducing a ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic 
transition of the diiron core, weakening the O–O bond in preparation for cleavage in 
subsequent steps of the catalytic cycle take place. The diiron clusters exhibited the 
EPR spectra characterized by a signal at g = 16 arising from ferromagnetic coupling 
of the two high spin S = 2 irons to yield an S = 4 species [73, 87]. The EXAFS of 
the methane C–H bond breaking diiron(IV) intermediate Q of sMMO was revisited 
using high-energy resolution ﬂuorescence-detected extended X-ray absorption ﬁne 
structure (HERFD-EXAFS) technique [82, 83]. The presented data showed a Fe-Fe 
distance as long as 3.4 Å, which close to that observed in open-core synthetic model 
complexes. 
In study [83, 84] it was found that the two tryptophan residues in MMOB and 
the single tryptophan residue in MMOR are converted to 5-ﬂuorotryptophan (5FW) 
by expression in media containing 5-ﬂuoroindole. The signiﬁcant N-terminal region 
of MMOB was 19F-labeled by reaction of the K15C variant with 3-bromo-1,1,1-
triﬂuoroacetone (BTFA). The approach showed directly that MMOR and MMOB 
competitively bind to sMMOH with similar KD value. These ﬁndings suggested 
a new model for regulation of the dynamic equilibration of MMOR and MMOB

with sMMOH which allowed a transient formation of key reactive complexes that 
irreversibly pull the reaction cycle forward. 
Studies on the interaction of MMOH-MMOB from Methylococcus capsulatus 
Bath (Figs. 5.12, 5.22) were carry out by absorbance spectroscopy demonstrated 
that Tyr76 and Trp78 induce hydrophobic interactions through π-π stacking and 
suggested that Tyr93 and Tyr95 could be key residues for electron transfer [84, 85]. 
The studies revealed that: (1) Interaction of MMOB and MMOD form a canyon region 
to induce allosteric effects in diiron active sites; (2) the regulatory component gener-
ates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic packing on the surface of MMOH (Fig. 5.22); 
(3) MMOB and MMOD bind a canyon region to induce allosteric effects in diiron 
active sites; (4) the indole moiety from Trp308 on MMOH generates π-stacking 
hydrophobic interactions with MMOB, including Tyr76 and Trp78; (5) the superim-
posed structure of MMOR-Fd has an aromatic residue, Tyr96, in this hydrophobic 
interaction area; (6) His98 is positioned in the solvent-accessible area to be putative 
binding residues to MMOH; and (7) Tyr76 and Trp78 induce hydrophobic interac-
tions through π-π stacking and suggested that Tyr93 and Tyr95 could be key residues 
for electron transfer
5.3.3 
Particulate MMO 
Various aspects of the structure and mechanism of action of pMMO (Fig. 5.22) are  
widely discussed in the corresponding bibliography [85–92, 93, 94–97]. The ﬁrst 
crystal structure of pMMO was that of the M. capsulatus (Bath) enzyme, determined 
in 2.8 Å resolution [85, 86]. 
The pMMO hydroxylase from M. capsulatus (Bath) consists of the pmoB, pmoA, 
and pmoC subunits (Fig. 5.25) [85]. The subunits are arranged as a 300 kDa α3β3γ3 
trimer which composes of PmoA (24 kDa) and PmoC (22 kDa), and PmoB (42 kDa). 
A primarily periplasmic subunit comprising two cupredoxin-like β-barrels joined by 
two transmembrane helices All structures contain a copper binding site at the N-
terminus of the pmoB subunit with ligands His33, which is the amino terminal residue 
of pmoB, His137, and His139. The Cu···Cu distance in the dinuclear model reﬁnes 
to, 2.6 A, consisting with the 2.57-A˚ Cu–metal interaction determined by EXAFS. 
Early data, namely EPR, Extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) and 
X-ray structural analysis indicated that Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO contains 
a mixture of Cu-O/N and Cu-Cu ligand environments with a Cu-Cu interaction at 
2.52–2.68 Å. Lawton et al. (2014) Proteins Struct Funct Bioinf 82:2263–2267Sarah

On the basis of multiple pMMO crystal structures, two copper centers have 
emerged as potential active sites, one located in PmoB (CuB) and one located in 
PmoC (CuC) (Fig. 5.23) [96, 99]. The CuB site includes three histidine ligands, 
His29, His133, and His135, using type II Methylocystis (Mc.) species and metal-
binding site in the PmoC subunit whose ligand set, which includes Asp129, His133, 
and His146. The one-electron reduction of the oxygen molecule is thermodynam-
ically forbidden while the enzyme reduction requires the transfer of two electrons 
with the formation of a derivative of hydrogen peroxide. It seems impossible to 
transfer two electrons from one copper ion and much more likely that two electrons 
are concerted transferred to O2, for example, one from nearby Cu2+c, and the second 
from Cu2+ B, according to the mechanism of long-distance transfer.

EPR and ENDOR studies have established the presence of two monocopper sites. 
Report [97] showed that the type II Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pMMO, 
like the type I pMMOs, contains two monocopper sites and that its CuB site has a 
coordination environment identical to that of type I enzymes. EPR/ENDOR measure-
ments showed the coordination environment of the spectroscopically observed site, 
provisionally denoted CuC, in both types of pMMO, indicating the assignment of 
this site observed by EPR to the crystallographically observed metal-binding site in 
the PmoC subunit. The crystal structure of Mc. sp. str. Rockwell pMMO is presented 
in Fig. 5.23. 
According to density functional theory calculations [97], the formation of a 
dicopper–oxygen species of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is more 
favorable than that one-cooper species. One copper ion is coordinated by the side 
chain nitrogens of His137 and His139 while the other is coordinated by the side chain 
of His33, and by an oxygen from the side chain of Glu35. In this pathway a μ-η 2 :η 
2—peroxo- or μ-η 1 :η 2 -peroxo-CuICuII species is converted to a reactive di(μ-oxo) 
CuIICuIII or (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII species capable of methane oxidation. 
Upon reduction and treatment of spmoB with O2 or H2O2 or pMMO with H2O2, an  
absorbance feature at 345 nm is generated evidencing for oxygen binding. The calcu-
lations also suggested that the H-atom transfer or proton-coupled electron transfer 
from the tyrosine residue can induce the O–O bond dissociation of the μ-η2:η2-
peroxoCuIICuII species to form the reactive (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII species.

Data on Extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) and X-ray struc-
tural analysis indicated that Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO contains a mixture 
of Cu–O/N and Cu-Cu ligand environments with a Cu-Cu interaction at 2.52–2.68 
Å. EPR, 1H ENDOR, DEER, native top-down mass spectrometry (nTDMS) and 
the crystallography analysis of the type II Mc. sp. str. Rockwell pMMO provided 
new insights into the pMMO copper centers [91, 95]. Experiments revealed the 
following: (1) The CuB sites in pMMOs from type I and type II methanotrophs 
have identical molecular and electronic structures: each is a mononuclear site, a 
single Cu(II) ion) with four nitrogen ligands, comprising three histidyl imidazoles 
and one terminal amine; (2) the 15N ENDOR and DEER data indicated the presence 
of two histidine ligands; (3) CuC exhibits properties that are completely consistent 
with coordination by the three protein-derived ligands of the crystallographically 
observed Cu.site: the two histidyl imidazoles of His133 and His146, along with 
the carboxylate of Asp129; (3) the 1H ENDOR data showed that the enzyme in 
detergent exhibits signals from nearby axial water molecule at a distance of ∼ 3 
Å; and (4) quantum reﬁnement of the original Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) 
pMMO crystal structure and native top-down mass spectrometry (nTDMS) indi-
cated the presence of a single copper ion localized to the amino terminus of PmoB 
[92, 95]. Recent crystallographic data, advanced electron paramagnetic resonance 
(EPR), high-energy resolution ﬂuorescence detected (HERFD), and partial ﬂuores-
cence yield (PFY) EXAFS spectra of Methylococcus (M.) capsulatus (Bath) pMMO 
revealed only monocopper site’s [95, 98]. It is important that open CuC coordina-
tion sites provides space for dioxygen and methane to bind, suggesting a role of 
CuC as the site of methane oxidation. Density functional theory (DFT) and quantum 
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/ MM) studies suggested that a monocopper 
CuIII-oxo species or a di(µoxo)CuIICuIII species could oxidize methane and that

formation of the dicopper species is more favorable [94, 97]. In later studies, a (µ-
oxo)(µ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII center was proposed to be the active species. Formation 
of this (µ-oxo)(µ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII species can be facilitated by proton transfer 
involving residues Tyr374 and Glu35 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering. 
The electronic, structural, and reactivity properties of a possible dinuclear 
copper species (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII of particulate methane monooxygenase 
(pMMO) obtained using density functional theory calculations were discussed with 
respect to the C–H bond activation of methane [90, 92]. The calculation proposed 
that: (1) The tyrosine residue in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper 
site donates an H atom to the μ-η2:η2-peroxoCuIICuII species; (2) the resultant (μ-
oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII species can hydroxylate methane; (3) the H-atom transfer 
or proton-coupled electron transfer from the tyrosine residue can induce the O–O 
bond dissociation of the μ-η2:η2-peroxoCuIICuII species; (4) the reactive (μ-oxo)(μ-
hydroxo)CuIICuIII species for the conversion of methane to methanol at the dicopper 
site of pMMO are formed; and (5) the rate-determining step for the methane hydrox-
ylation is the C–H cleavage, which is in good agreement with experimental KIE 
values. 
Reported in [89, 91] spectroscopic data indicated that Methylocystis sp. strain 
M pMMO contains a mixture of Cu(I) and Cu(II), of which the latter exhibits two 
distinct type 2 Cu(II) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. Extended X-
ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) data showed a mixture of Cu-O/N and Cu-Cu 
ligand environments with a Cu-Cu interaction at 2.52-2.64 Å, n consent with the 
crystal structure of Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO which was determined to 2.68 
Å resolution 
Data on nanodiscs coupled with native top-down mass spectrometry (nTDMS) 
to determine the copper stoichiometry in each pMMO indicated the presence of a 
mononuclear copper center in both PmoB and PmoC. pMMO-nanodisc complexes 
with a higher stoichiometry of copper-bound PmoC exhibited increased activity 
[101, 103]. This ﬁnding suggested that the PmoC copper site plays a role in methane 
oxidation activity. 
Multiple nanodisc-embedded pMMO structures reconstituting pMMO in 
nanodiscs and restoring methane oxidation activity, determined by cryo–electron 
microscopy to 2.14- to 2.46-angstrom resolution revealed the structure of pMMO in 
a lipid environment [98, 101]. The resulting model includes stabilizing lipids, regions 
of the PmoA and PmoC subunits, and a copper-binding site in the PmoC subunit with 
an adjacent hydrophobic cavity. Structural characterization of M. capsulatus (Bath) 
pMMO in the native lipid nanodisc showed: (1) Methane oxidation activity of cryo-
EM sample; (2) Cryo-EM map indicating the trimer and the encircling nanodisc; (3) 
the map for lipids on the periphery and in the inner pore of the enzyme; (4) copper 
sites in the PmoB subunit of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, regions of pMMO newly 
observed in the cryo-EM structures; and (5) active site architecture in the PmoC 
subunit of pMMO. 
The hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase contains a binuclear 
iron cluster in which the iron appears to be oxo or R-oxo bridged. Massbauer and 
EPR studies have demonstrated antiferromagnetic coupling for the [Fe(III)Fe(III)]

and [Fe(ll)Fe(lll)] states of the cluster. In the [Fe(II)Fe(II)] form the cluster exhibits 
an intense X-band EPR signal with zero crossing near g = 16, which originates from 
an electronic system with integer spin.

Multielectron Redox Mechanisms 
Abstract Two electron mechanism may involve the direct transport of two electrons 
from a mononuclear transition complex to a substrate. The probability of two electron 
processes, however, increases sharply if two electrons are transferred together with 
a proton as a hydride or the change in electric charge is compensated by the simulta-
neous shift of the electron cloud from neighboring groups. Hydrogenases are a diverse 
group of metalloenzymes that catalyze the conversion of dihydrogen into protons and 
electrons and the reverse reaction, the generation of dihydrogen. The [NiFe] hydro-
genase and the [FeFe] hydrogenase contain sulfur bridged bimetallic centers. The 
concept of four-electron mechanism of N2 reduction at mild conditions was ﬁrst 
introduced by Likhtenshtein and Shilov in 1970. It was suggested that the four-
electron process can occur in a multinuclear cluster of transition metals. The multi-
electron nature of the energetically favorable processes in clusters does not evidently 
impose any new additional restrictions. The need for a synchronous four-electronic 
elementary act with the formation of a hydrazine-like intermediate is dictated by 
thermodynamics. The central enzyme of biological nitrogen ﬁxation catalyzes in 
the nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria the reduction of molecular nitrogen to ammonia by a 
reductant with the assistance of ATP hydrolysis: The nitrogenase active has iron-
sulfur F cluster (F4S4), P-clusters (F8S7) and FeMo cofactor (F7S9Mo). After the 
accumulation of four and six reduction equivalents in, the reduction of u occurs ﬁrst 
to the hydrozine derivative and then to ammonia, respectively, the reduction of u 
occurs ﬁrst to the hydrozine derivative and then to ammonia, respectively. The role 
of ATP in the nitrogenase reaction was discussed. Subsequent absorption of four 
light quanta by Photosystem I (PS)I and photosystem II (PS II) results in evalua-
tion of dioxygen from a two-water molecule. Photosynthetic water oxidation occurs 
at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of (PSII) which contains a Mn4CaO5 inor-
ganic cluster ligated by oxides, waters and amino acid residues. In 1976, Semenov, 
Shilov, and Likhtenstein suggested that in plant photosynthesis, the splitting of a 
water molecule with the release of molecular oxygen can occur only according the 
thermodynamically allowed four-electron mechanism.

Multielectron Redox Mechanisms
6.1 
Two Electron Processes. Hydride Transfer 
in Hydrogenases 
There are a considerable number of reactions in which the products contain two 
electrons more than the starting compounds. These reactions can proceed as two 
successive one-electron transitions or by a single two electron process. Two electron 
mechanism may involve the direct transport of two electrons from a mononuclear 
transition complex to a substrate. Such a transport may alter sharply the electrostatic 
states of the systems and obviously require a substantial rearrangement of the nuclear 
conﬁguration of ligands and polar solvent molecules. For instance, the estimation of 
the synchronization factor for an octahedral complex with low-molecular saturated 
ligands showed a very low value of asyn = 10−7–10−8 and, therefore, a very low 
rate of reaction. In addition, a signiﬁcant reorganization energy of the process is 
expected. The probability of two electron processes, however, increases sharply if 
two electrons are transferred together with a proton as a hydride or the change 
in electric charge is compensated by the simultaneous shift of the electron cloud 
from neighboring groups. Involvement of bi- and, especially, polynuclear transition 
metal complexes as well as synchronous protons transfer, may essentially decrease 
the environment reorganization and, therefore, provide a high rate for the two-and 
four-electron mechanisms. 
Hydrogenases are found in a wide range of archaea, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as 
soluble and membrane-bound enzymes [1–6]. Hydrogenases are a diverse group of 
metalloenzymes that catalyze the conversion of dihydrogen into protons and electrons 
and the reverse reaction, the generation of dihydrogen:

The reaction takes place at a specialized metal center that increases the acidity of 
H2 and leads to a heterolytic splitting of the molecule which is strongly accelerated 
by the presence of a nearby base. Polarized H2 involves in the respective coupling of 
H+ and H−. The heterolytic mechanism has been proven by H/D isotope exchange 
experiments. Hydrogenases are sub-classiﬁed into three different types based on the 
active site metal content: iron-iron ([FeFe]) hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase 
[NiFe], and iron hydrogenase [Fe]. In the hydrogenases, hydrogen uptake is coupled 
to the reduction of electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, carbon dioxide, 
and fumarate. On the other hand, proton reduction is coupled to the oxidation of elec-
tron donors such as ferredoxin. Both low-molecular weight compounds and proteins 
such as cytochrome c3, and cytochrome c6 can act as physiological electron donors 
or acceptors for hydrogenases. 
The [NiFe] hydrogenase from DvMF26 and the [FeFe] hydrogenase contain 
sulfur bridged bimetallic centers, typically with an open coordination site on one 
metal (Fig. 6.1). [Fe] hydrogenases with a Fe cofactor (Fe-guanylylpyridinol, Fe-GP) 
catalyze the reversible reduction of the substrate methenyltetrahydromethanopterin

(methenylH4MPT +) with H2 to methylene-H4MPT and a proton by transferring a 
hydride ion to the proR position of the C14a carbon of methylene-H4MPT. 
The basic catalytic cycle of hydrogenases bearing a [NiFe] active site contains 
three states (Ni-SIa, Ni-C, and Ni-R) and runs in several steps: (1) In a ﬁrst step the 
H2 is polarized at the four-coordinated Ni and heterolytically split; (2) The resulting 
Ni-R states carry the H− in the bridge between Ni(II) and Fe(II); (3) The H+ is 
attached to a sulfur of the terminal Cys546; (4) Release of a proton and an electron 
leads to the paramagnetic Ni-C state, carrying a hydride bridge; and (5) Loss of 
another electron and a proton (from the hydride bridge) then leads back to Ni-Sia 
and completes the cycle [2]. 
[FeFe] hydrogenases are highly active catalysts for hydrogen conversion [3]. Their 
active site has two components: a [4Fe-4S] electron relay covalently attached to the

dithiolate (ADT) ligands. Reduction of the [4Fe-4S] site was proposed to be coupled 
with protonation of one of its cysteine ligands. In [FeFe]-hydrogenases, catalysis 
takes place at a di-iron center, which contains a bridging dithiolate ligand, three CO 
ligands and two CN (−) ligands (Fig. 6.2) [4]. The enzyme can be in two active 
states, Hox and Hred. Hox has one unpaired electron and a Lewis acidic Fe (I) center

poised to bind H2. Hred is the reduced state with all electrons are paired (an S = 0 in  
ground state). Protonation of Hred or H2 activation at Hox (concomitant with electron 
transfer) can give a presumed catalytic intermediate such as a diferrous hydride state 
Fe(II)Fe(II)-H−. A catalytically relevant super-reduced state has also been identiﬁed 
in the enzyme from C. reinhardtii, featuring a reduced [4Fe–4S]+ cluster and possibly 
an Fe–H bond. 
It was assumed that in the [FeFe] hydrogenase from CpI, the hydride can be formed 
after the two electron shift in Hred (Fig. 6.3) [2]. DFT and experimental studies on 
model systems have indicated that, only a terminal hydride has sufﬁcient reactivity 
to recombine with a proton and form molecular hydrogen.
[FeFe]-hydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaHydA) was adsorbed 
to a negatively charged, self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Electrochemical and 
single-molecule imaging experiments (scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM) 
and cyclic voltammetry) were carried out on a catalytically active hydrogenase 
preparation [6]. The single enzyme distribution on the Au-SAM surface coupled with 
macroscopic electrochemical measurements was observed. Employing the same elec-
trode allowed the evaluation of a turnover frequency (TOF) as a function of potential 
for single [FeFe]-hydrogenase molecules.

The concept of four-electron mechanism was ﬁrst introduced by Likhtenshtein and 
Shilov in [7] and then was developed and applied to such “heavy” enzymatic and 
chemical reactions as the reduction of molecular nitrogen and the water splitting 
under mild conditions [8–17]. It was suggested that the four-electron process can 
occur in a multinuclear cluster of transition metals. The multielectron nature of the

energetically favorable processes in clusters does not evidently impose any new, 
additional restrictions on its rate: (1) Within the clusters coordination sphere, the 
multiorbital overlap is effective and, therefore, the resonance integral V is high; (2) 
The electron transfer from (or to) the orbitals of the metal to substrate orbital can 
be accompanied by the simultaneous shift of electron clouds to the reverse direction 
and, therefore, may prevent signiﬁcant changing of local charges and does not violate 
markedly the reaction complex nuclear frame; and (3) The strong delocalization 
electron in clusters and polynuclear complexes reduces to minimum the reorganiza-
tion of the nuclear system during electron transitions and, therefore, provides low 
energy activation and a relatively high value for the synchronization factor. The data 
presented in this section showed that a particularly signiﬁcant contribution has been 
recently made to investigation of structure and action mechanism of the reduction of 
molecular nitrogen and the water splitting [8–17].

Structure and Action Mechanism of Nitrogenase 
Microbiological nitrogen ﬁxation is the global large-scale process of the atmospheric 
nitrogen reduction to ammonia with the yield approximately 200,000 million tons 
per annum. The process occurs in anaerobic and aerobic bacteria such as Azoto-
bacter vinelandii, Clostridium pasteurianum, Klebsiella pneumonia, etc., and Rizo-
bium from the root nodules of legumes. The Bulen and LeCompt [18] and Mortenson 
et al. [19, 20] groups ﬁrst reported the isolation of the ﬁrst partially puriﬁed dini-
trogen ﬁxing complex (nitrogenase). The central enzyme of biological nitrogen ﬁxa-
tion catalyzes in the nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria the reduction of molecular nitrogen to 
ammonia by a reductant with the assistance of ATP hydrolysis:

The reducing agent can be biological (ferredoxin) and non-biological (S2O4 2−) 
compounds or a photochemical electron donation systems [21, 22]. Apart from 
N2 and H+, nitrogenase catalyzes reduction of many substrates (C2H2, C2H4, NO, 
HCN, HN3, cyclopropene, etc.), which are also inhibitors of nitrogen reductions. 
The biological reduction of N2 to NH3 catalyzed by Mo-dependent nitrogenase 
requires ATP-driven electron transfer from the Fe protein to the catalytic MoFe 
protein. Each ET is coupled to the hydrolysis of two ATP molecules. Developments 
in this important ﬁeld have been reviewed in the last decades [8–20, 23–47]. 
Crystallographic data have been ﬁrst produced for the nitrogenase complex of FeP 
(A2) and FeMoP (A1) from Azotobacter vinelandii [30, 32] and for the corresponding 
complex of Cp2 and Cp1 from Clostridium pasteurianum [20, 22]. The solutions of 
a number of high-resolution X-ray structures of the nitrogenase component proteins 
and use of an arsenal biochemical and physical methods [31–59] have provided 
insights into the nature of the nitrogenase active site including iron-sulfur F-and 
P-clusters and FeMo cofactor (Figs. 6.4 and 6.5) [24]. The cluster structure of the 
iron-sulfur complex in the active center of nitrogenase was proven for the ﬁrst time by 
Likhtenshtein group in the early 1970’s by the method of nitroxide spin labels [12– 
16, 31]. Later, such structure was conﬁrmed by ESR and Mössbauer spectroscopy 
[32].
The Lowe−Thorneley (LT) kinetic model for nitrogenase function was 
constructed on the base of the kinetic studies, which involved steady-state, stopped-
ﬂow, and freeze−quench kinetics measurements (Fig. 6.6) [33]. The model describes 
the kinetics of transformations among catalytic intermediates (denoted En) where 
n is the number of steps of electrons/ protons delivery to MoFe protein. Note that, 
according to the scheme, dinitrogen is attached to the active center of the enzyme 
only after the delivering n of four electrons and four protons.

The calculations of the binding energies of the intermediates along the reaction 
path for hydrogenation of N2 (Fig. 6.7) [34, 43] were based on density function 
theory, with plane wave expansion of the Kohn-Sham wave functions and a gener-
alized approximation for the exchange correlation term. Two different clusters to 
mimic the central part of the FeMoco have included the effect of the surrounding 
by invoking a proton donor in the vicinity of the cofactor. The authors have come to 
the important conclusions that only the fourth electron/proton transfer will make the 
reaction irreversible.
The chemical consequences of a central ligand in the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor 
were investigated using density functional calculations [46]. Several possible routes 
for insertion of the central nitrogen ligand were considered, which allowed to 
conclude c that all routes involve barriers and intermediate states, are inaccessible

at ambient conditions. It was also investigated how the FeMoco with the central 
ligand can interact with N2 and reduce it. The possible conversion of bidentate into 
monodentate homocitrate on this three electron-reduced species in FeMoco has been 
proposed to free up a binding site for N2 on the molybdenum atom [35]. Exper-
iment indicated that α-Lys426 can facilitates chelate ring opening and subsequent 
orientation of the monodentate homocitrate by forming a speciﬁc hydrogen bond to 
the homocitrate -CH2CH2CO2− carboxylate group and that mutation of α-Lys can 
selectively perturb N2 reduction without affecting acetylene reduction. 
A comprehensive theoretical investigation of the binding of N2 to the 
Fe(7)MoS(9)N(homocitrate)(cysteine)(histidine) active site (FeMo-co) of the nitro-
genase (Fig. 6.8) was carried out [36]. The model used to calculate FeMo-co 
(Fig. 6.8), in which 442His is truncated to imidazole, 275Cys was truncated to SCH3, 
and homocitrate is truncated to glycolate, and -OCH2COO− was considered. Ninety-
four local energy minima were located for N2 coordinated in η2-N2 (side) and η2-N2

(end) modes at the endo and exo coordination positions of Fe2 and Fe6. The compu-
tation showed that: (1) Barriers to association of N2 depend mainly on the location 
of the hydrogenation and the location of N2 coordination; (2) Dissociation barriers 
depend primarily on whether N2 is eta(2)- and eta(1)-coordinated, and secondarily on 
the location of the hydrogenation, (3) Increase negative charge on FeMo-co increases 
the barriers;, (4) The ﬁrst transfer of H to N2 is likely to have a relatively large acti-
vation barrier; and 6) The small barriers for dissociation of η2-N2 suggest that this is 
unlikely to be a competitive coordination mode. From data on mutation to affect the 
N2 activity of nitrogenase, and from the N2coordination proﬁles, it was concluded 
that endo- η2-N2 coordination at Fe6 is most probable.
Based on the density functional theory, calculation for ammonia production at 
the FeMo cofactor of the nitrogenase was performed [37]. It was concluded that: 
(1) During the catalytic conversion, nitrogen bridges two Fe atoms of the central 
cage, replacing a sulfur bridge present before dinitrogen binds to the cofactor; (2) 
Transformation from cis- to trans-diazene occurs; (3) Exothermic cleavage of the 
dinitrogen bond takes place, while the Fe atoms are bridged by a single nitrogen atom, 
and (4) The dissociation of the second ammonia from the cofactor is facilitated by 
the closing of the sulfur bridge following an intramolecular proton transfer. It was 
found [38] that turnover of a doubly-substituted MoFe protein (α-70Ala/α-195Gln) 
with hydrazine generates a new state with a rhombic S = 1/2 EPR signal (> 60% of 
the total FeMo cofactor signal). Pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy using uniformly 15N-
labeled hydrazine revealed that the trapped intermediate was a hydrazine-derived 
species bound to FeMo cofactor with a single type of 15N signal. H-ENDOR spec-
troscopy showed that strongly coupled proton(s) were associated with the bound N, 
consistent with a FeMo-cofactor-NyHx species. In addition, the single observed N 
bound could result from end-on binding of hydrazine or from a single N atom frag-
ment of hydrazine after N-N bond cleavage. Suggested distal (D) and alternating (A)

pathways for N2 hydrogenation with the Janus E4 state is presented in Fig. 6.9. As  
can be seen in the Figure, characterization of catalytic intermediates formed during 
the reduction of N2 could distinguish between the D and A pathways.
In early 1970th, it was suggested Semenov et al. [9, 40] that four-electron reduction 
N2 can occur at the stage of formation of the binuclear transition metal complex with 
this molecule whose structure is close to that of the hydrazine derivative. 
Below is an estimate of the energy of possible mechanisms for the reduction of 
molecular nitrogen by molecular hydrogen, the redox potential of which is close to 
the potential of reducing agents in the nitrogenase reaction. The following known 
data on the average binding energies between atoms D (in bracket) in kcal/mol were 
used for the calculation: DN-N (34), upper D Superscript upper N identical to upper N (100), upper D Superscript upper N identical to upper N (22), DH-H (91), DN-H (93.5) 
and calculated energies of ﬁrst and second broken bonds: E1 = 125 kcal/mol and

According to the Eqs. 6.3 and 6.4, the mechanism IV for the formation of hydrazine 
is 25 kcal/mol more energetically favorable than the mechanism III occurring the 
formation of diazene. Therefore, the formation of hydrazine by reaction with molec-
ular hydrogen is likely to be 1018 times as compared with the formation of diazene. 
Consideration of the data on the standard enthalpies, at 298.15 K, of diazene (ΔH0 = 
41.7 kcal/mol and hydrazine (ΔH0 = 23 kcal/mol) [42]. also leads to a similar conclu-
sion. The energy difference in this case is 18.7 kcal/mol in favor of the formation 
of hydrazine. It can be assumed with a high probability that the signiﬁcant thermo-
dynamic preference of the four-electron process over the two electron one will be 
retained in the reduction reaction of N2 in the active center of FeMOco. 
The above data on the energy of one-electron and two electron mechanisms for 
the reduction of molecular nitrogen indicate high energy barriers in the reactions, 
which thermodynamically excludes the formation of single or double bonds of N2 
with a single atom of transition metal complex in FeMOco. In addition to the energy 
considerations presented above, below are the arguments in favor of four electronic 
mechanism for the reduction of molecular nitrogen in the active center of nitrogenase 
with a hydrazine derivative as the ﬁrst intermediate product.

1. Only the fourth electron/proton transfer will make the reaction irreversible [43]. 
2. In FeMoco, N2 is placed, bridging four iron atoms inside the cavity between the 
two incomplete F4S3 cubanes [44]. 
3. During the catalytic conversion, nitrogen bridges two Fe atoms of the central 
cage, replacing a sulfur bridge present before dinitrogen binds to the cofactor 
[36]. 
4. Pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy using uniformly 15N-labeled hydrazine revealed 
that the trapped intermediate was a hydrazine-derived species bound to FeMo 
cofactor with a single type of 15N signal [45]. 
5. Hydrazine was revealed in experiments on the nitrogen reaction acid quenching 
[33]. 
6. Diazene decomposes readily even at low temperatures [47]. 
7. The multi-orbital binding of nitrogen in a polynuclear complex (binuclear 
complex in the simplest case), makes it possible to donate electrons from d-
orbitals of metals to anti-binding π* orbitals of N2 and to accept electrons from 
binding π-orbitals of N2 to empty d-orbitals of the metal. 
8. The presence in FeMoco a large, unique in biology cluster of transition metals 
in the reduced state makes it possible not only simultaneously breaking of two 
bonds in N2 and the formation of four new ones with metal atoms, but also 
compensation for changes in local charges due to the displacement of the general 
electron cloud. 
9. The principal product of N2 reduction catalyzed by a model chemical cluster is 
hydrazine [10, 48]. 
It should be noted that due to the high complexity of FeMoco and the proximity 
theoretical methods, the results of calculations cannot be considered ﬁnal. 
6.2.2.2
Role of ATP Hydrolysis 
Though reduction of N2 by biological reducing agents to NH3 is thermodynamically 
favorable (ΔGo = − 7.8 kcal/mole, 1 atm, 298 K), the catalytic process in mild 
conditions faces a serious thermodynamic problem. The values of standard redox 
potential (E0) of plausible intermediate products N2-H or N2H2, were estimated to 
be approximately equal to − 3.2 and − 1.2 eV, respectively. In fact, these reactions 
are thermodynamically forbidden under mild conditions. The mechanism implicated 
in the formation of hydrazine (E0 = − 0,75 eV), as the ﬁrst intermediate, is ther-
modynamically more preferable, though requiring additional energy consumption 
provided most likely for account of energy of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6.10) [12, 16, 
28].
Available experimental structural and kinetics data and energetic considerations 
indicate two plausible roles of ATP in the nitrogenase reduction: (a) the triggering 
of electron transfer from iron protein to iron-molybdenum protein [23] and the 
strengthening reducing power of the enzyme catalytic redox centers [12, 49, 50]. 
The energetic proﬁle of the nitrogenase reaction, presented in Fig. 6.10, indicates

the increase of the reduction 
potential upon ATP 
hydrolysis [16]
that formation of reaction plausible intermediates is thermodynamically forbidden 
without utilization energy of ATP hydrolysis [12, 16, 49, 50, 53, 54]. 
A chemical mechanism of coupling of ATP hydrolysis reactions in nitrogenase was 
proposed in 1976 [9]. Speciﬁcally, the role of ATP hydrolysis can consist of a forced 
non-equilibrium protonation of a protein group, which increases the iron- sulfur 
cluster positive charge. This increase contributes in turn to the transfer of an extra elec-
tron and, after removal of the proton to the consequent formation of a super-reduced 
form of the cluster. Thus, ATP hydrolysis energy may be consumed for producing a 
center with high reducing power. This conclusion was supported in work [51]. The 
electrostatic and thermodynamic analysis showed that the ATP hydrolysis energy in 
nitrogenase can be utilized to increase the driving force of the electron-transfer reac-
tion in the protein−protein complex, while MgATP binding induces conformational 
changes and protein−protein association. The induced redox-potential change was 
estimated found to be equal to or larger than one-third of an electronvolt, which is 
roughly the energy associated with the hydrolysis of one MgATP molecule. 
The isolated Fe protein can bind MgATP and MgADP at a stoichiometry of two 
nucleotides per dimer [52, 55]. An ATP analog, ADP.AlF4, forms a stable and non-
active complex with A2 component of nitrogenase (Av1-Av2), in which it is located 
between two domains at a distance about 15 Å from the [Fe4S4] cluster. This value 
was predicted in early 1970th by estimation of the distance between the ATPase and 
substrate-binding sites in nitrogenase by the NMR-1H method [53, 54]. The cluster 
and ADP.AlF4 are separated by a region, which includes Asp125, Glu128, Asp129, 
and Cys132 (Fig. 6.11). Toward an understanding of the allosteric regulation of 
electron transfer in nitrogenase, an analysis of the mechanical coupling in the ATP-
and ADP-bound was performed using a graph-based method [55]. The method was 
employed for investigating the mechanical coupling between distant sites in proteins 
and on the base crystal structures of the ADP-bound nitrogenase complex (Fig. 6.11)

[55] Graph theory was used to ﬁnd shortest path in road or a network. Mechani-
cally coupled regions of the nitrogenase complex as inferred computationally were 
validated against hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange experiments. Speciﬁcally, the 
P-loop in the Fe protein, residues adjacent to β-188Ser in the MoFe protein (in partic-
ular β-189Phe), as well as residues at the Fe protein/MoFe protein interface, were 
found to be strongly coupled. 
First-order rate constants for each key step in the reaction sequence, including 
direct measurement of the ATP hydrolysis rate constant were measured [56]. Exper-
iments performed at with a Hi-Tech SF61 SF UV-visible spectrophotometer, was 
used to monitor oxidation of Fe Protein. Pre-steady state ATP hydrolysis assays were 
carried out at 25 °C on a rapid chemical quench-ﬂow instrument (KinTek Corp.). The 
time course of Pi release was determined in a SF ﬂuorometer (Auto SF-120, KinTek 
Corp.) using the coumarin (N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino) coumarin-
3-carboxamide) labeled phosphate binding protein assay. The dissociation of the Fe 
protein from the MoFe protein was determined by monitoring the release of the Fe 
protein from the MoFe protein utilizing the SF spectrophotometer. The experiments 
suggested the following sequential events in the nitrogenase cycle: (1) conformation-
ally gated ET, (2) ATP hydrolysis, (3) Pi release, (4) Fe protein dissociation from the 
MoFe protein, (5) the free energy of ATP binding and protein–protein association 
control the ET events, and (6) ATP hydrolysis and Pi release cause dissociation of 
the reduced MoFe protein from the Feox(ADP)2 protein. Figure 6.12 presents the key 
Fe protein reactions formulated as a thermodynamic cycle.

bullet Thus, the triple role of ATP in the nitrogenase reaction was assumed, namely: 
(1) The binding of this molecule to the [Fe4S4] cluster causes the triggering of 
electron transfer from iron protein to iron-molybdenum protein; (2) The hydrolysis 
of ATP provides allosterically the energy for the formation of the super-reduced 
state, what is needed to reduce N2; and (3) The dissociation of the nitrogenase 
complex occurs, which prevents the energetically favorable reverse transition of 
the electron: Changes in the midpoint potentials of the nitrogenase metal centers as 
a result of iron protein-molybdenum-iron protein complex formation was reported 
[59]. The midpoint potential of the Fe protein [4Fe-4S]2 + /1 + cluster couple was 
observed to change by – 200 mV from – 420 mV in the uncomplexed L127Delta 
Fe protein to − 620 mV in the L127Delta Fe protein-MoFe protein complex. The 
midpoint potential of the two electron oxidized couple of the P-clusters (P2 + / 
N) of the MoFe protein was observed to shift by − 80 mV upon protein–protein 
complex formation.

Photosynthetic water oxidation occurs at the water oxidation system (WOS) or 
oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II (PSII) (6.13). The OEC contains 
a Mn4CaO5 inorganic cluster ligated by oxides, waters and amino acid residues. The 
OEC is embedded in Photosystem II (PS II), a membrane pigment−protein complex, 
where the primary charge separation by absorbed sunlight energy and successive 
electron transfer occur through several vectorially arranged pigment molecules. 
The key step of the process is the water splitting under absorption of light quanta 
of relative low energy. The oxidation of two water molecules to produce a dioxygen 
proceeds in a stepwise manner is described in the four S-state cycle with the following

In 1976, Semenov, Shilov, and Likhtenstein suggested that in plant photosynthesis, 
the splitting of a water molecule with the release of molecular oxygen can occur 
only according to the four-electron mechanism [40]. Indeed, one and two electron 
oxidation of water requires an oxidant with a standard potential of + 2.7 V and 
1.35 V, respectively. The formation of an oxygen molecule requires a potential of 
only + 0.8 V [62]. In such a case, the PS II photosystem must contain a molecular 
device that switches four one-electron processes initiated by light into a four-electron 
process. In this regard, the following mechanism of water splitting in a four-nuclear 
magnesium complex was proposed [40]: 
Subsequent studies conﬁrmed the participation of the four nuclear manganese 
complex in the process of water photooxidation and also, to a large extent, the four 
electronic oxidation mechanism. In the PSII the chlorophyll cationic radical P680+ is 
reduced by a redox-active tyrosine, known as Tyr[subz] (Tyr[sup161] of D1 subunit), 
to generate a neutral tyrosine radical Tyr[subz], which acts as a strong oxidant for the 
water oxidation process. The radical cation P680+[sup þ] has a very high oxidizing 
potential, estimated to be 1.2 V [62]. which is sufﬁcient for the water-splitting reaction 
by the four-electron mechanism with O2 evolution.

6.3 Photosynthetic Water Oxidation Complex

The structure and mechanism of the Mn-Ca cluster are important in understanding 
the mechanism of water oxidation and for the design of efﬁcient artiﬁcial water-
oxidizing catalysts. Research in this area has been the subject of numerous studies, 
including the use of advanced physical methods and was comprehensively reviewed 
[10, 12, 16, 28, 40, 60–74]. In this sections, we will focus mainly on the water-
splitting process that appears to be one of the most enigmatic reactions in chemistry 
and photochemistry. 
A possible cycle of the water splitting shown in Fig. 6.14 [87] and references 
therein, includes the following stages: (1) Water binds as an OH− (O5) in the S0 
state, being deprotonated during the subsequent oxidation step to S1; (2) In the S3 
state the second substrate water enters the reaction as OH− (O6) to Mn4 (or Mn1); 
(3) A further oxidation and deprotonation step leads to S4, formation of which is 
triggered by proton release; (4) A proton is transferred from W1 (H2O) to Asp61, as 
in the preceding S2–S3 transition; and (5) Mutants of PSII lacking Asp61 show a pH 
dependency of the lag phase during the S3–S0 transition which has been attributed 
to a deprotonation of the Mn4CaO5 [87].
Simpliﬁed S-state Kok scheme for oxygen evolution along with proposed ﬁve 
oxidation states of Mn in the various intermediate S-states, structure of the OEC and 
kinetics of electron transfer using data available by 2014 was presented in [63]. The 
geometry of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the OEC has been revealed in the 1.9 Å crystal 
structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, detailed extended X-ray absorption ﬁne 
structure (EXAFS) studies, using oriented membranes, single crystals, and range-
extended methods, have indicated that the Mn4CaOx cluster in the dark stable S1 
state consisted of three di-μ-oxo and one mono-μ-oxo-bridged Mn−Mn interactions. 
Kok et al. [63]. 
(Paper [64]) introduced structural models of the oxygen-evolving complex of 
photosystem II (PSII) in the dark-stable S1 state, as well as in the reduced S0 and 
oxidized S2 states, with complete ligation of the metal−oxo cluster by amino acid 
residues, water, hydroxide, and chloride. The models developed according to state-of-
the-art quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid methods, being 
applied in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of PSII from the cyanobac-
terium Thermosynechococcus elongatus were consistent with available data on X-
ray diffraction models and extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure. The models 
suggested the following: (1) Manganese and calcium ions are ligated consistently 
with standard coordination chemistry assumptions, supported by biochemical and 
spectroscopic data; (2) The calcium-bound chloride ligand is found to be bound in a 
position consistent with pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance data obtained from 
acetate-substituted PSII; (3) The ligation of protein ligands includes monodentate 
coordination of D1-D342, CP43-E354, and D1-D170 to Mn(1), Mn(3), and Mn(4), 
respectively; and (4) η2 coordination of D1-E333 to both Mn(3) and Mn(2); and 
ligation of D1-E189 and D1-H332 to Mn(2) take place. 
The mechanism of water splitting in photosystem II (PSII) as described by chem-
ical models of the oxygen-evolving complex in the S0−S4 states was examined 
[65]. Molecular models of the OEC Mn3CaO4Mn catalytic cluster were constructed 
using state-of-the-art quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid

Fig. 6.14 Model for the water oxidation cycle in PS II based on spectroscopic and theoretical work 
detailing the structures of the Mn cluster in the different S states, the water binding events and the 
O–O bond formation and O2 release in S4. The boxes show the determined oxidation states of the 
Mn ions in the respective S state. A color code is used for the assignment of the MnIII (light purple) 
and MnIV (dark purple) ions when the OEC is passing through the S states. Note that the oxygens 
of the waters and µ-oxo bridges are given in red except for the proposed substrate oxygens O5 and 
O6 (green). The S2 state exists in two conformations (closed/open cubanes), see text. S3 may also 
exist in an open (S3 A) and a closed (S3 B) cubane form (not shown). For S3 a state S3′ is shown 
in which manganese oxidation has occurred but the 2nd water has not been introduced. This state 
is present in native sample in a minority of PS II centers, but it is stabilized upon speciﬁc chemical 
treatment (methanol addition or Ca2+ to Sr2+ exchange). A switching of the preferred total spin 
ground state conﬁguration of the cluster is thought to take place in S2 from low to high spin and 
between S4 and S0 back from high to low spin; this is indicated by the diagonal line dividing the 
green and blue boxes. This switching of the spin state may be necessary for the formation of triplet 
dioxygen 3O2 in the ﬁnal step of the cycle [87]. With permission from Springer Nature
methods, in conjunction with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure of PSII from 
the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Obtained structures of the S3, 
S4, and S0 states include an additional μ-oxo bridge between Mn(3) and Mn(4) 
being essential for the deprotonation of substrate water molecules. A detailed mech-
anism suggested the following: (1) Substrate water molecules coordinated as terminal 
ligands to Mn(4) and calcium; (2) The formation of an oxyl radical by deprotonation 
of the substrate water molecule ligated to Mn(4); (3) Accumulation of four oxidizing 
equivalents nucleophilic attack by a substrate water molecule initially coordinated 
to calcium and activated by two basic species, including CP43-R357 and the μ-
oxo bridge between Mn(3) and Mn(4). The authors concluded that the reaction is 
concerned with water ligand exchange, swapping the activated water by a water 
molecule in the second coordination shell of calcium.

6.3 Photosynthetic Water Oxidation Complex
237
Electronic structure of the Mn4OxCa cluster in the S0 and S2 states of the 
oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II was investigated using advance pulse 
55Mn-ENDOR and EPR spectroscopy [83]. 55Mn hyperﬁne coupling constants of 
the S0 and S2 states of the OEC were interpreted on the basis of Y-shaped spin-
coupling schemes with up to four nonzero exchange coupling constants J. This 
analysis established: (1) The oxidation states of the manganese ions in S0 and 
S2; (2) Shortening of 2.85 A Mn–Mn distance in S0 to 2.75 A in S1; and (3) 
Deprotonation of hydroxo bridge between MnA and MnB, that is, between the 
outer Mn; and its neighboring Mn of the ı3-oxo bridged moiety of the cluster. 
These results were summarized in a molecular model for EOS (Fig 6.13). Using 
9.4 GHz (X-band) hyperﬁne sublevel-correlation (HYSCORE) and 34 GHz (Q-
band) electron spin–echo electron nuclear double resonance (ESE-ENDOR) spectro-
scopies, the binding mode of 13C-labeled methanol was revealed. These results were 
compared to analogous experiments on a mixed-valence Mn(III)Mn(IV) complex 
(2-OH-3,5-Cl2-salpn)2Mn(III)Mn(IV) (salpn = N,N′-bis(3,5-dichlorosalicylidene)-
1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) in which methanol ligates to the Mn(III) ion 
[85]. 
Intense femtosecond X-ray pulses produced at the Linac Coherent Light Source 
(LCLS) were used for investigation of the dark state (S1) and the ﬁrst illuminated 
state (S2) of Mn4CaO5 cluster, employing simultaneous X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of microcrystals of photosystem II (PS II) 
at room temperature [66]. Employed ultrashort X-ray pulses (UXP) were the pulses 
at 30 femtosecond or shorter with wave lengths occurring at interatomic distances. 
The inherent X-ray’s abilities to capture the change in position of atoms, or molecules 
during transient processes were used. The UXP method was probed for the overall 
protein structure and the electronic structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. XRD data were 
presented from both the dark state (S1) and the ﬁrst illuminated state (S2). Structure 
details deduced from diffraction of micron-sized crystals of PS II using sub 50 fs 
X-ray pulses at room temperature at LCLS were displayed in a ﬁgure which includes 
the following features: (1) 2mFo-DFc electron density map for the PS II complex 
in the dark S1 state obtained at LCLS contouring at 1.2 σ shown for a radius of 5 Å 
around the protein; (2) Detail of the same map in the area of the Mn4CaO5 cluster 
in the dark S1 state, with mesh contoured at 1.0 σ and 4.0 σ; and (3) Positions of 
selected residues in D1 fragment ant atoms Mn and Ca. 
The progress in investigation of the catalytic intermediate states of the 
Mn4CaO5 cluster using an X-ray free-electron laser to determine simultaneously the 
light-induced protein dynamics via crystallography and the chemistry that occurs at 
the catalytic center was summarized [67]. An experimental set-up for the simulta-
neous collection of both synchrotron radiation (SR)-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) using the coherent X-ray imaging (CXI) 
instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) was designed. A set of tools 
for the study of PSII at XFELs, including a new liquid jet based on electrofocusing, 
an energy dispersive von Hamos X-ray emission spectrometer for the hard X-ray 
range and a high-throughput soft X-ray spectrometer based on a reﬂection zone plate 
was developed. The diffraction data obtained showed that the structure of PSII at

RT were found to be isomorphous to the structure obtained using cryogenic XRD at 
Synchrotron radiation (SR) sources. 
A “radiation-damage-free” structure of PSII from Thermosynechococcus 
vulcanus in the S1 state at a resolution of 1.95 Å s using femtosecond X-ray pulses 
of the SPring-8 ångström compact free-electron laser (SACLA) and hundreds of 
large, highly isomorphous PSII crystals was examined [68]. The valences of each 
manganese atom was assigned as Mn1D(III), Mn2C(IV), Mn3B(IV) and Mn4A(III), 
based on the average Mn–ligand distances and analysis of the Jahn–Teller axis 
on Mn(III). Importantly, one of the oxo-bridged oxygens, O5, has signiﬁcantly 
longer distances to Mn than do the other oxo-oxygen atoms, suggesting that O5 
is a hydroxide and therefore may serve as one of the substrate oxygen atoms. Time-
resolved X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of the Mn4Ca cluster, in which a core 
electron was excited by an incident X-ray photon was utilized [69]. The excited 
state decays by emitting an X-ray photon to ﬁll the core hole and the process of 
oxygen formation in real time was observed. These experiments revealed that: (1) 
The oxygen evolution step, initiated by three sequential laser ﬂashes, is accompanied 
by rapid (within 50 μs) changes to the Mn Kβ XES spectrum; (2) No oxidation of 
the Mn4Ca core above the all-MnIV state was detected to precede O O bond forma-
tion; (3) O O bond formation occurs prior to the transfer of the ﬁnal (fourth) electron 
from the Mn4Ca cluster to the oxidized tyrosine TyrZ residue; and (4) The kinetic 
limitations associated with O O bond formation exist. The model also suggests an 
evolutionary adaptation to avoid releasing harmful peroxide species. 
The recent structural studies, including a high-resolution, radiation-damage-free 
structure of the water-oxidizing complex, and structures of intermediate S-states 
revealed by femtosecond X-ray free electron lasers were taking in account in compre-
hensive review [70]. The structure and functions of the biologically active site and 
its implications for the development of inorganic catalysts for solar fuels produc-
tion were discussed in detail. On the base of the combination of serial femtosecond 
X-ray crystallography and Kβ X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), a multimodal 
approach for simultaneously probing the overall protein structure and the electronic 
state of the Mn4CaO5 cluster throughout the catalytic (Kok) cycle was developed. 
Data on use X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) which generate X-ray by electrons 
ﬂying through a periodic magnetic ﬁeld, beam focus, and dose on the Mn Kβ1,3 XES 
spectra in PS II over a wide range of pulse parameters utilizing both microcrystal 
and solution PS II samples were reported. The experiments were performed at LCLS 
using a nominal beam energy of 9.5 keV, a pulse duration of 35 fs, and beam focus 
of 2.5–10 lm corresponding to pulse intensities ranging from 6.6 1015 to 5.7 1017 
W/cm2 and doses ranging from 1.3 106 to 1.1 108 Gray. The ﬁndings showed beam 
intensities ranging from ∼5 × 1015 to 5 × 1017 W/cm2 at a pulse length of ∼35 
fs. The spectral effects are compared to those observed between S-states in the Kok 
cycle. 
To monitor apparent volume changes of the PSII protein, membrane particles 
were investigated employing photothermal beam deﬂection (PBD) [72]. The PBD 
technique relied on the detection with microsecond resolution of diffractive index 
changes upon excitation by a nanosecond laser ﬂash, using an infrared laser providing

a continuous-wave probe beam, was applied to study PSII protein in aqueous suspen-
sion. A Q-switched, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser was served as excitation light 
source (pump ﬂashes) to step the PSII through the S-state cycle to induce the measured 
PBD signals. Driven by nanosecond laser ﬂashes, the PSII was synchronously stepped 
through its water oxidation cycle involving four (semi)stable states (S0, S1, S2, 
and S3) and minimally three additional transiently formed intermediates. This tech-
nique allowed for determination of the associated enthalpy changes (ΔH) from the 
heat release into the medium and of apparent volume DV. The associated volume 
changes involved the following: (1) Initial formation of charged groups resulting in 
contraction assignable to electrostriction; (2) Volume contraction caused by reduced 
metal–ligand distances upon manganese oxidation; (3) Charge-compensating proton 
removal resulting in volume expansion due to electrostriction reversal., S2, and 
S3).The basic reaction scheme of the WOC was extended to include further interme-
diates, which reﬂect the alternating charge state of the Mn4CaOn complex due to ET 
and PT events, resulting in the following sequence [72]:

where the indices “n” or “+” denote a neutral or positively charged WOC in compar-
ison to the S1 state. The bold arrows indicate the transitions occurring ﬁrst after 
light-ﬂash excitation. According to suggested scheme, O2 is released during the S3 n 
⇒ S0 n transition. Each Sin → Si + transition reﬂects the oxidation of the WOC by 
ET to redox-active tyrosine residue (Tyr161) YZ + , whereas each Si + → Sin tran-
sition involves charge-compensating proton removal from the WOC. On the basis 
of the photothermal beam deﬂection (PBD) results, a completed reaction scheme 
of PSII volume changes in the S-state cycle due to the proton transfer (PT) and 
electron transfer ET events was suggested [72]. Suggested reaction scheme for the 
O2-evolving transition of the WOC was displayed in a Fig. 6.15. As a conclusion, 
the following processes were detected: (1) Seven transitions attributed, according 
to the H/D-exchange, temperature, and pH effects on their time constants, to ET or 
proton transfer (PT) events; (2) The oxidizing the Mn4CaOn cluster in the S2 → 
S3 and S0 → S1; (3) A biphasic PT prior to the O2-evolving reaction; and (4) The 
reoxidation of the primary quinone acceptor (QA –) at the PSII acceptor.
PS II WOS in visible-light-driven water-splitting action was monitored by 
using in situ, aqueous-environment surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 
[73]. SERS is a surface-sensitive technique that enhances Ramans scat-
tering by molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces or by nanostructures such 
as plasmonic-magnetic silica nanotubes The enhancement factor can be as much as 
1010–1011. The electromagnetic theory proposes the excitation of localized surface 
plasmons, while the chemical theory proposes the formation of charge-transfer 
complexes. In work [73], experimental SERS supported by density functional theory 
and isotopologue comparisons was used as a tool for study the WOS dynamic struc-
ture in the course of catalytic action, employing a Ag nanoparticle (NP) ﬁlm as 
the SERS substrate. The snapshots in the dynamic SERS were found to correspond

to intermediate states S0−S3 of the water-splitting cycle, from which the protona-
tion conﬁguration of the S1 state and likely structures for S2 and S3 intermediates 
were determined. The following structural mechanism of the S0−S3 transitions in 
the water-splitting catalytic cycle and structures for the S0−S3 intermediate states of 
the WOS ’s catalytic cycle were assigned: (1) Intermediate structures are based on 
the protonation state for the S1 state; (2) The isomer of the S2 state (open cubane) 
l involved in the catalytic cycle was chosen on the basis of its structural similarity 
to the S1 and S3 geometries; and (3) An original conﬁguration was chosen for S3 on 
the basis of its prevalence in experimental SERS spectra and its consistency with a 
structure obtained by water insertion in the S2 → S3 transition. 
The yield of in vitro WOS photoassembly was found to be higher in deuterated 
water, D2O, compared with H2O, when chloride is limiting [74]. The kinetic studies, 
and the analysis the protonation states of the OEC protein environment using classical 
Multiconformer Continuum Electrostatics showed the following: (1) A signiﬁcant 
lag phase in H2O at limiting chloride concentrations with an apparent H/D solvent 
isotope effect of 0.14 ± 0.05; (2) The growth phase of WOS photoassembly with 
an H/D solvent isotope effect of 1.5 ± 0.2; (3) Protons lost from amino acid that 
will serve as OEC ligands as metals are bound.; (4) Chloride and D2O increase the 
proton afﬁnities of key amino acid residues which tune the binding afﬁnity of Mn2+/3+ 
and facilitate the deprotonation of water to form a proposed μ-hydroxo bridged

Mn2+Mn3+ intermediate; and (5) Optimal photoassembly was observed after 20 min 
at 50 μE·m−2·s−1. In addition, in proposed mechanism of WOS photoassembly the 
following steps were taking in consideration: (1) Mn2+ ﬁrst binds to the HAS in the 
apo-OEC protein environment; (2) The proton afﬁnities of carboxylic acid groups in 
the pocket are relatively high, and electrostatic repulsion is minimized; (3) The ﬁrst 
Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+; (4) A second Mn2+ binds to the now vacated HAS. and is 
trapped in place by the formation of a μ-hydroxo bridge with the Mn3+ ion (the HAS 
represents the location where Mn2+ binds during photoassembly; (5) Formation of 
this ligand requires proton release and an efﬁcient Brønsted base located nearby; 
and (6) the second Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+, forming a Mn3+Mn3+ dimer which is 
highly stable and templates the remaining photoassembly process, while remaining 
steps are kinetically rapid. 
Electron magnetic resonance has been proved to be a powerful method for studying 
the electron structure of paramagnetic complexes [75–79]. Below are some typical 
examples of the application of the method for the study of WOS. The experiment 
revealed the appearance of various EPR signals initiated by ﬂashes of light. Specif-
ically, it was found that a Mn EPR signal from t S0 state oscillates with a period 
of four, indicating that it originates from fully active PSII centers [80]. The signal 
characteristics are consistent with the S0 state EPR signal arising from a coupled 
MnII−MnIII intermediate. The new signal is more stable than the S2 state signal and 
its decay in tens of minutes is indicative of it originating from the S0 state. The effect 
of illumination at 5 K of photosystem II in different S-states was also investigated 
with EPR spectroscopy and showed that [81]: (1) Two split radical EPR signals 
around g ≈ 2.0 were observed from samples given 0 and 3 ﬂashes, respectively; (1) 
The signal from the 0-ﬂash sample, with a width of ∼80 G was oscillated with the 
S1 state in the sample; (2) The signal from the 3-ﬂash sample, with a symmetric 
shape of ∼160 G width from peak to trough, varied with the concentration of the 
S0 state; (3) Both signals were formed within 10 ms after a ﬂash, and decayed with 
half-times at 5 K of 3−4 min; (3) The signal in the S0 state, was likely originated 
from magnetic interaction between Y Z· and the S2 state and was assign to Y Z· in  
magnetic interaction with the S0 state, Y Z·S0; (4) The other signal was attributed to 
the magnetic interaction between Y Z· and the S1 state Y Z·S1; (5)  Y Z can be oxidized 
at 5 K in the S0 and S1 states; and (6) Oxidation of Y Z involves deprotonation of the 
tyrosine. 
In study [82], the S2 state of PSII-enriched membrane fragments was examined 
at Q-band (frequency 34 GHz) ESR spectroscopy. Light-induced signals at g = 3.1 
and g = 4.6 were observed. The observation of the signal at g = 3.1 was agreed with 
a previous study at 15.5 GHz, in which the X-band g = 4.1 signal was proposed to 
arise from the middle Kramer’s doublet of a near rhombic S = 5/2 system. Zero-
ﬁeld splitting values of D = 0.455 cm (−1) and E/D = 0.25 were used to simulate 
the spectra. Q-band EPR spectroscopy was applied to study the S3 state of the Mn 
cluster in untreated and in 4% v/v methanol treated PSII membranes [84]. Prominent 
EPR signals were observed in both sets of samples. A simultaneous analysis of the 
spectra at both frequency bands indicated that the spin associated with the signals of 
S3 is S = 3. The S1 → S2 redox transition of the WOS has been studied employing

242
6
Multielectron Redox Mechanisms
EPR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy [62]. In the S2 state, two 
isomers of the WOS were observed by EPR: a ST = 1/2 form and a ST = 5/2 form. 
Using structural information on the WOS and its surroundings, in conjunction with 
spectroscopic information available on the S1 → S2 transition for a variety of site-
directed mutations, Ca2+ and Cl− substitutions, and small molecule inhibitors, it was 
proposed that the hydrogen-bonding network encompassing D1–D61 and the OEC-
bound waters play an important role in stabilizing one spin isomer. The S2 state of 
WOS was studied using EPR spectroscopy at X-band frequencies [86]. It was found 
that a single manganese center oxidation occurs on S1 → S2 state transition and 
S2 state has multiline EPR including g4 signal. The observed multiline signal was 
arised from a ground state spin ½ center. The g4.1 signal generated at ≈140 K NIR 
illumination was proposed to arise from a spin 5/2 center with rhombic distortion. 
These data supported an X-band CW-EPR-generated g4.1 signal as originating from 
a near rhombic spin 5/2 of the S2 state of the PSII manganese cluster. 
Energetic and kinetic parameters of intermediates formed in the course of the 
reaction cycle (S-state cycle) of photosynthetic water oxidation were obtained [88]. 
Speciﬁcally, time-resolved measurements of prompt chlorophyll ﬂuorescence and 
time-resolved delayed ﬂuorescence (DF) measurements were employed to esti-
mate rate constants, activation energies, free energy differences, and to discriminate 
between the enthalpic and the entropic contributions. A joint-ﬁt simulation approach 
was used to analyze decays of the DF of PSII extending from 10 μs to 10 ms.  Nine  
kinetic parameters of four exponential components were determined for the reaction 
intermediates in the S-state transitions in buffers with different pH in H2O and in 
D2O. Then, the resulting ﬁt parameters were used to calculate the time-constant of 
O2 formation, the total Gibbs free energy of the proton removal steps, and a mean 
time-constant for all proton removal steps. 
The progress in investigation of the catalytic intermediate states of the 
Mn4CaO5 cluster was reported [67]. An X-ray free-electron laser was utilized to 
determine simultaneously the light-induced protein dynamics via crystallography and 
the local chemistry that occurs at the catalytic center. An experimental setup for the 
simultaneous collection of both synchrotron radiation (SR)-based X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) using the coherent X-ray imaging 
(CXI) instrument at LCLS was designed. The diffraction data were obtained by a 
new liquid jet based on electrofocusing. In the frame of this technique, an energy 
dispersive von Hamos X-ray emission spectrometer for the hard X-ray range, and a 
high-throughput soft X-ray spectrometry based on a reﬂection zone plate showed that 
the structure of PSII at RT is isomorphous to the structure obtained using cryogenic 
XRD at SR sources. The RT Mn Kβ XES data obtained from high-valent Mn model 
compounds and from solutions and microcrystals of PSII, using the femtosecond 
pulses at LCLS, matched with data collected under non-damaging conditions at low 
temperatures using SR sources.

Molecular Dynamics of Proteins 
and Their Functional Activity 
Abstract This chapter presents a brief overview of physical and computer methods 
for studying the mechanisms and frequencies of the molecular dynamics of proteins 
and enzymes, illustrated with typical examples. The list of methods used includes 
the following: spin and Mössbauer labels and probes, ﬂuorescence quenching, ﬂuo-
rescence dynamic Stokes shift, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), nuclear 
magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, small-wide-angle X-ray scat-
tering, femtosecond time-resolved X-ray solution scattering, and neutron scattering. 
Protein dynamics occur at time scales from millisecond to subfemtosecond. The range 
of time-scales involved in substrate turnover step of enzyme catalyzed reactions and 
internal protein dynamics are similar. The protein motions necessary for catalysis are 
an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may limit the overall turnover rate. Recent 
works on selected protein systems have addressed the role of dynamics in enzyme 
evolution. In some cases, connections among hydration layer dynamics, solvation 
shell structure, protein surface structure and their function has been revealed. Partic-
ular attention was paid to works in which a relationship is established between speciﬁc 
stages of the enzymatic process and speciﬁc molecular dynamic modes. 
7.1 
Introduction 
Enzymes must be ordered to allow the stabilization of transition states in their active 
sites, yet dynamic enough to adopt alternative conformations suited to each steps 
in their catalytic cycles (principle of dynamic adaptation (Sect. 7.2.1). Increasing 
evidence indicated that internal protein motions can play a role in promoting 
protein function, in particular [1–37]. The thermodynamic ﬂuctuations of the solvent, 
surrounding the protein, can have an impact on internal protein motions and, there-
fore, on enzyme function. The role of such motions has been investigated by using a 
whole arsenal of classical and modern physical methods including utilization isotopi-
cally substituted enzymes and its mutants through a combination of experimental and 
computational analyses. Rational design and directed evolution have proved to be

successful approaches to increase catalytic efﬁciencies of both natural and artiﬁcial 
enzymes. 
Proteins undergo a broad range of motions under physiological conditions, span-
ning from local to global changes in conformations (Figs. 7.1 and 7.2) [1–91]. Among 
them, highly collective “soft” modes, i.e., driving the dynamics in the range of corre-
late cooperative motions of entire domains/subunits modes. Moreover, the thermody-
namic ﬂuctuations of the solvent, surrounding the protein, have an impact on internal 
protein motions and, therefore, on enzyme function. The contribution of protein ﬂex-
ibility on the ps–ns and μs–ms timescales to enzymatic catalysis has been focus of 
several computational and experimental studies [28–33]. A brief characterization of 
physical methods used to investigate frequency tau S

is the correlation frequency; ktran is the rate constant of collisions;

ubscript tran Superscript negative 1 is the translational jump time. 
Loops are among the most structurally dynamic features of proteins [36, 37]. 
They always link more ordered secondary structures (i.e., α-helices and β-strands), 
and can range from well-deﬁned turns to random-coil-like structures. Loops can be 
important for a range of functions, including interactions with ligands, other parts 
of the protein, or other macromolecular binding partners. Loop motions can also 
play direct roles in chemical catalysis through positioning catalytically important 
amino acid residues [36, 37]. Availability of supercomputers and development of 
elegant molecular methods of dynamics simulation have been made a basis for the 
employment of explosive methods and a wide range of successful applications [28, 
39] The computer simulation produces individual particle motions as a function of

and internal protein dynamics are similar. Note the universal frequency factor (kBT/h), which is

7.1 Introduction
249
Fig. 7.2 Protein dynamics occur at different time scales. a Motions on the picosecond to 
nanosecond scale involve small changes in backbone or side chain torsion angles. Calcium bound 
calmodulin (1exr, upper) exhibits conformational heterogeneity on the interface of the peptide 
binding site. The residual conformational entropy of binding depends on side chains sampling 
alternative conformations as exempliﬁed by Met36 and Leu39 (lower). Electron density contoured 
to 2.5 e−/Å3 in a dark blue mesh and 0.8 e−/Å3 in cyan volume representation. The lessons from 
calmodulin likely apply to enzymes where the loss of conformational entropy associated with the 
rigidiﬁcation of active-site loops or side chains can speciﬁcally weaken binding to substrate or 
product complexes and promote ﬂux through the catalytic cycle. b A model of ubiquitin (2k39) 
derived from RDC data reporting on motions up to microseconds is shown as cartoon, with the 
other models in the ensemble shown as transparent ribbons (upper). The dynamic β1β2 loop moves 
between alternative loop conformations, represented as sticks (upper and lower). The population 
of the up (cyan), mid (blue), and down (purple) β1β2 conformations can be a critical determinant 
of binding preferences for protein–protein interactions. The rates of transition between these states 
discriminate between induced ﬁt and conformational selection mechanisms, which can inﬂuence 
catalytic mechanisms and inhibitor discovery. c For enzymes, loop motions on the millisecond 
time scale are often rate limiting for catalytic cycles, with essential roles for governing ligand ﬂux 
and repositioning key catalytic residues for catalysis. The WPD loop of protein tyrosine phos-
phatase 1B (PTP1B) moves between the “closed” (1sug, orange) and “open” (1t49, cyan) form 
on the millisecond time scale, forming the catalytically competent closed active site conforma-
tion. Further molecular detail of the two conformations are shown in the lower panel with electron 
density contoured to 0.3 e−/Å3. d The archaeal proteasome, a ∼700-kDa complex, controls active 
site access through the dynamic exchange of the N-terminus to block or reveal the central pore on 
the time scale of seconds. The structure of the proteasome is shown as a homoheptamer with each 
subunit in a different color (upper). In the lower panel, the ensemble of structures of the N-terminus 
of one of the seven subunits is shown in blue (2ku1). e Many enzymes enter long-lived states, with 
distinct catalytic activities, through stochastic ﬂuctuations. Quaternary structure reconstruction of 
two RAS molecules (yellow) and son of sevenless (SOS, gray surface) complex. The Cdc25, REM, 
DH, histone, and PH domains of SOS are colored blue, green, orange, brown, and red, respectively 
[1xd2 (RAS) and 3ksy (SOS)]. This complex exchanges between long-lived states with distinct 
catalytic rates. The structural basis of this exchange is currently unknown but likely involves rear-
rangements of protein–protein interfaces shown schematically in equilibrium. f The folded crystal 
structure (1ssx) of α-lytic protease (upper) is a kinetically trapped structure. After folding catalyzed 
by a proline domain, the kinetic barrier to unfolding makes this protein stable on the scale of years. 
The benzoyl moiety of Phe228 deviates by 6° from planarity. Removing this distortion can change 
the unfolding barrier from over a year to less than 2 weeks. Electron density contoured to 4.75 
e−/Å3 (dark blue mesh, lower) and 0.5 e−/Å3 (cyan volume representation) [35]. Published under

A critical review of the idea that dynamical effects contribute to catalysis consid-
ering all reasonable deﬁnitions of what does and does not qualify as a dynamical 
effect was presented [28]. The authors claimed that: (1) no dynamical effect has

ever been experimentally shown to contribute to catalysis; (2) the existence of non-
negligible dynamical contributions to catalysis is not supported by consistent theo-
retical studies; and (3) despite a substantial body of experimental effort, there has not 
yet been any study that consistently established a connection between an enzyme’s 
conformational dynamics and a signiﬁcant increase in the catalytic contribution of the 
chemical step. Nevertheless, a direct relationship between the nanosecond dynamics 
of enzyme proteins and their functional activity was already demonstrated in early 
studies (Sect. 7.2.1). Obviously, in in the solid state of proteins, a complex multi-stage 
chemical reaction is impossible. The problem is that it is needed to ﬁnd out directly 
what speciﬁc dynamic modes is associated with given chemical step. Indeed, “the 
dynamical proposal is not a semantic issue but a well-deﬁned scientiﬁc hypothesis 
with well-deﬁned conclusions” [28]. Although protein dynamics has been recog-
nized as important due to the inherent ﬂexibility of biological macromolecules, it 
is often difﬁcult to distinguish which conformational changes are directly related 
to function. The fundamental relationship between the dynamics of proteins and 
surrounding water molecules and the functional activity of proteins appears to be a 
challenging problem and a subject of hot debate.

7.2.1 
Hypothesizes and First Experiments 
The present conception of the intramolecular dynamics of proteins is based on 
hypothesizes put forward in the 1950s and 1960s, namely: (1) Assumption that 
substrate-enzyme interaction was accompanied by a certain structural distortion of 
both substrate and enzyme [40]; (2) The theory of “complementarity” of the free 
energy of the chemical reaction in the enzyme-active center and the enzyme confor-
mational free energy [41]; (3) Hypothesis regarding the structural ﬂuctuation of the 
protein macromolecule, which is visible in the ability of inner peptide groups to 
exchange hydrogen atoms for water protons [42]; and (4) The conformational struc-
ture of the enzyme can be induced to ﬁt the structure of the substrate during their 
interaction [43]. At a later stage, the concepts of protein dynamics were supplemented 
by the principle of dynamic adaptation of the enzyme conformational structure to 
the substrate conﬁguration in consecutive chemical reactions of the enzyme [5–14, 
45]. Such an adaptation promotes both the ﬁrst step of precise orientation and the 
subsequent chemical steps, without allowing cleavage of the contacts needed for the 
chemical mechanism. This general property of the protein may be deﬁned as dynamic 
adaptability [1, 2, 12, 44]. 
In 1950, while analyzing data on the binding of organic molecules to bovine 
serum albumin (BSA), Karush came to a conclusion on the ﬂexibility of the protein 
binding site structure [46]. For example, it was later discovered that the binding of 
steroid molecules in the binding site of albumins causes a change in the conformation

252

Molecular Dynamics of Proteins and Their Functional Activity
of the protein globule [47]. The change was observed in the rotational mobility 
of the spin labels located at a distance greater than 16 Å from the binding site, 
into which steroid molecules were introduced. Another example is a transglobular 
conformational transition at the binding of speciﬁc inhibitors to a lysozyme molecule 
labeled with a nitroxide spin label at histidine-16, located 16 Å away from the active 
center [48]. Addition of a corresponded amount of inhibitors NAG and NAG-NAG 
induced distinct changes in the label ESR spectra. 
The ﬁrst direct experimental evidence of the nanosecond intramolecular mobility 
of a protein matrix at ambient temperatures was obtained in 1970th by Likhtenshtein 
group using spin and Mössbauer labels and probes [6, 44, 45, 56–58]. To illustrate, a 
hydrophobic aromatic derivative of a nitroxide radical was embedded in the human 
serum albumin binding site and the mobility of the spin probe was traced by ESR 
spectroscopy. The apparent correlation frequency υc = 108 s−1 of the probe motion 
was found to be essentially faster than macromolecular tumbling and was not found to 
be dependent on viscosity. Therefore, this ﬁnding was attributed to the local mobility 
of the label. Employing the phenomenon of ﬂuorescence quenching of the buried 
tryptophane residues Lackovicz and Weber [65] explained the quenching effect by 
dynamic opening and closing of the gap that prevents the quencher from reaching 
tryptophan in the closed state. The conclusion about the nanosecond time scale of 
protein dynamics was conﬁrmed in a series of early studies including the following: 
(1) Neutron scattering within the molecular dynamics of solid-state lysozyme showed 
a signiﬁcant effect of glycerol and water on dynamic transition temperatures (T d) 
[49]; (2) Solvent dependence of dynamic transition in protein solution was supported 
by neutron scattering and computer simulation methods [50]; (3) Importance of 
solvent mobility for protein dynamics at temperatures above 180 K was demonstrated 
by molecular dynamics simulation [51]; and (4) This conclusion was conﬁrmed by 
low-temperature experiments with the use of the ﬂuorescence dynamic Stokes shift, 
neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulation in other proteins, superoxide 
dismutase, lysozyme, elastase, bacteriorhodopsin, and references therein [52–55]. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance can yield reach information on the dynamics of 
various parts of the protein measuring relaxation times such as T 1 and T 2 to deter-
mine order parameters, correlation times, and chemical exchange rates [55, 66]. 
NMR relaxation studies can provide detailed information pertaining to the internal 
dynamics in proteins on a time scale from milliseconds to picoseconds. The 15N, 13C 
and 2H spin–lattice relaxation rate (1/T 1) and heteronuclear NOE’s are sensitive to 
high frequency motion (108–1012 s−1), while the spin–spin relaxation rate (1/T 2) is a  
function of much slower processes. For example, the NMR relaxation technique was 
used to investigate the backbone dynamics of staphylococcal nuclease complexed 
with a ligand and Ca2+ and labeled with 15N [55]. Information on internal motions 
was extracted from experimental data using the model-free approach [67].

7.2.2 
Early Mechanisms of Protein Dynamics 
At any conditions, protein macromolecules exhibit high-frequency low-amplitude 
harmonic nuclear vibrations with υc = 1013–1014 s−1 and amplitude A = 0.01– 
0.05 Å. This type of motion, directly detected by the methods of IR, Raman, Möss-
bauer, NMR and ESR spectroscopy, takes place in all proteins, at all temperatures 
and degrees of humidity, and apparently is not directly related to their functions 
and stability. The comparative analysis of available data [44, 45, 58–60] revealed 
an apparent discrepancy between the physical labeling approach and certain other 
physical methods. Thus, the measurements of the temperature dependence of the 
heat capacity (cp) of proteins,  α-chymotrypsin, lysozyme, myoglobin, collagen, at 
various temperature and degrees of hydration indicated only a monotonic increase 
of cp and did not detect pronounced phase transitions [68, 69]. Monotonic character 
of the temperature dependences of such physical parameter of proteins as circular 
dichroism was also conﬁrmed. However, spin, ﬂuorescence and Mössbauer labeling, 
H–D exchange, non-elastic neutron scattering and absorption spectra of heme in 
heme proteins detected sharp transitions within a temperature range before thermal 
denaturation [44, 45, 56–64, 70, 73]. 
The above-mentioned discrepancy was readily explained by the following 
proposal [44, 59]: (1) The suggested type of nanosecond intermolecular mobility 
consists of movement of the relatively large and rigid parts of the protein macro-
molecules (domains); (2) Such hinge-like oscillation of the tightly packed polypep-
tide blocks does not give a measurable contribution to the overall heat capacity 
and the helicity degree of polypeptide chains; and (3) The hinge-like motion of 
domains strongly affects the mobility of the Mössbauer labels ﬁrmly bound to the 
protein blocks, the mobility of spin and ﬂuorescence labels and native chromophores 
located in cavities between the blocks. At a later stage, the hinge-bending or domain 
motion mechanism proposed was conﬁrmed by independent experimental investiga-
tion and theoretical calculations [59] and references within). Depending on protein 
speciﬁcs, the correlation time of domain motion can vary in temporal regions from 
milliseconds to nanoseconds. Experimental results from studies of Arrhenius depen-
dence of different characteristics of lysozyme are presented in Fig. 7.3 [34, 59, 
70]. The discontinuities on the curves indicate local conformational transitions and 
apparently likely due to the appearance of a more open conformation of the protein. 
As can be seen from Fig. 7.3, these methods reveal conformational transitions at a 
temperature of about 30 °C, whereas the temperature dependence of the partial heat 
capacity decreases monotonically in this temperature region. Against the background 
of the general contribution of high-frequency dynamics in heat capacity from a large 
number of protein atoms, the contribution of domain motions is negligible.
In the search for a correlation between functional activity of α-chymotrypsin 
the protein dynamics, the enzyme was modiﬁed by a spin label attached to the 
methionine-92 group in the region of the active site and by a Mössbauer label in 
the enzyme globule periphery [61]. The protein tryptophane group was also served 
as an intrinsic ﬂuorescence label. The experiment showed that agitation of the label

mobility in the nanosecond region at relative humidity about Prel = 0.6 correlates with 
a sharp increase in the hydrolysis degree of the cyanomoyl α-cymotrypsin covalent 
compound [72]. This result highlighted the signiﬁcance of nanosecond dynamics in 
the chemical step of the enzyme reaction. 
Figure 7.4 shows that a dramatic increase in the rate constant of electron transfer

the same temperature interval (200–220 K) as the animation of the nanosecond

Proteins Dynamics Computations 
Signiﬁcant progress in the study of the molecular dynamics of proteins and enzymes 
for two last decades is reﬂected in a series of comprehensive reviews and original 
theoretical and experimental works [1–4, 11–123]. Among the spectrum of methods 
for studying the molecular dynamics of such complex structures as proteins, a special 
place is occupied by methods based on simulation [4, 27, 28, 39, 53, 54, 84, 120]. As a 
typical example, results of Mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics simulations

of the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that 
reduces dihydrofolic acid 
to tetrahydrofolic acid, using NADPH as electron donor, were presented in [84]. 
The nuclear quantum effects such as zero point energy, hydrogen tunneling, and the 
motion of the entire solvated enzyme, were taking in account during the generation of 
the free energy proﬁles and the real-time dynamical trajectories. Data on the tunneling 
transmission coefﬁcient was found to be 0.80 for hydrogen and 0.85 for deuterium, 
indicated the signiﬁcance of dynamical barrier recrossings. The computation implied 
that motions of residues both in the active site and distal to the active site can impact 
the free energy of activation and the degree of barrier recrossing. In addition, it 
was shown that a network of coupled promoting motions, extending throughout 
the protein, involves motions spanning femtosecond to millisecond time scales. A 
study of the Thermus thermophilus chorismate mutase (TtCM) was carried out by 
using self-consistent-charge density-functional tight binding)/molecular mechanics, 
umbrella sampling, and the weighted histogram analysis method [120]. The compu-
tation led to the following results: (1) The computed free energies of activation for 
the reactions in water and TtCM are comparable to the experimental values; (2) The 
free energies for formation of near attack conformer are 8.06 and 0.05 kcal/mol in 
water and TtCM, respectively; (3) The near attack conformer stabilization contributes 
≈ 90% to the proﬁciency of the enzymatic reaction compared with the reaction in 
water; (4) The transition state (TS) structures and partial atom charges are almost 
the same in the enzymatic and water reactions; (5) The difference in the electrostatic 
interactions of Arg-89 with O13 in the enzyme–substrate complex and enzyme–TS 
complex provides of 1.92 kcal/mol total TS stabilization; and (6) Differences in elec-
trostatic interactions between components at the active site in the enzyme–substrate 
complex and enzyme–TS complex are signiﬁcant, such that TS stabilization is of 
minor importance and the enzymatic catalysis is through an entropic advantage. 
Experimental and computational works relating to enzyme dynamics and func-
tion, including the role of solvent were reviewed [75]. The evidences suggested 
that: (1) Fast motions on the 100 ps timescale, and any motions coupled to these, 
are not required for enzyme function; (2) Proteins where the function is electron 
transfer, proton tunneling, or ligand binding may have different dynamical depen-
dencies from those for enzyme; and (3) Enzymes with large turnover numbers may 
have different dynamical dependencies from those that turn over more slowly. Quan-
tized molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the role of enzyme vibrations in 
facilitating dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) hydride transfer were carry out [87]. All

simulations were performed using a modiﬁed version of the Gromacs-4.0.7 molec-
ular dynamics package Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD). The RPMD 
equations of motion were used to simulate the dynamics of DHFR. To quantify and 
distinguish between statistical and dynamical correlations in the enzyme motion, 
sampling the full ensemble of reactive trajectories was performed. The computation 
led to a number important results including the following: (1) Statistical correlations 
give rise to nanometer-scale coupling between distal protein residues and the intrinsic 
reaction; (2) Dynamical correlations vanish at distances beyond 4–6 Å from the trans-
ferring hybrid; (3) Nonequilibrium dynamical coupling between protein residues and 
the hydride tunneling reaction exists; and (4) The calculated time-dependence of the 
transmission coefﬁcient conﬁrmed that reactive trajectories commit to the reactant 
or product basins within 25 fs. 
Authors of work [86] characterized enzyme conformational dynamics (ECD) in 
cyclophilin A (CypA), peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (Fig. 7.5), using normal 
and accelerated, atomistic dynamics simulations by employing a combination of 
normal MD (nMD) and accelerated MD (aMD). This approach provides atomistic 
detail with extended timescale (107–1011 s−1). The simulation showed that Kramers’ 
rate theory can be used to present a rationale of how enzyme conformational dynamics 
(ECDs) affects the reaction dynamics and catalytic rates. According to the theory, in 
the high friction regime the reaction rate constant is

Deff is the effective diffusion coefﬁcient on a one-dimensional free energy proﬁle and 
assumed to be independent of the reaction coordinate. To probe the effects of ECD in 
catalysis, several lowered torsional energy barriers around the –Ala–Pro–ω bond of a 
substrate analogue, Ace–Ala–Ala–Pro–Phe–Nme were considered. The simulation 
indicated that substrate dynamics involved in the chemical step, is coupled to the 
dynamics of the surrounding medium which can either be the solvent or the active 
site of the enzyme. 
An uniﬁed view of the role of protein dynamics in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 
catalysis was suggested [89]. DHFR transfers a hydride from NADPH and a proton 
from the solvent to C-6 and N-5 of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to generate 5,6,7,8-
tetrahydrofolate (THF). Computational studies indicated that side chain rotations of 
Ile14 and Ile94 of EcDHFR bring the reactants closer toward the reaction-ready active 
site conﬁguration. Heavy enzymes were produced in media containing appropriate 
labeled ingredients such as 15NH4Cl, U-13C,2 H-glucose, and 2H2O. The an enzyme 
kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was assessed by comparing the reaction rate constants for 
the light enzyme, kLE, and heavy enzyme produced in media containing appropriate 
labeled ingredients such as 15NH4Cl, U-13C,2 H-glucose, and 2H2O, kHE. The typi-

obtained. 
The study [78] was concentrated on the effect of protein chain ﬂexibility on the 
properties of hydration water, using short peptides as a model. 18 linear peptides 
with the sequence (XXGG) × 5, where X represents one of the common amino 
acids, other than glycine and proline. Two versions of each peptide were studied 
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: one was ﬂexible (only the dynamics 
of the N and C terminals), and the other was constrained. The computation found 
that: (1) Restricting the peptide dynamics can slow down the translational motions 
of water molecules to a distance of at least 12–13 Å; (2) For the peptides, water 
molecules were selected based on the distance between the water oxygen atoms and 
the peptide heavy atoms, for different cutoff distances, i.e., 3.5 Å, 5 Å; (3) For bulk, 
water molecules were selected in a layer beyond a sphere with a radius of 50 Å; 
(4) Analysis of the “slow” water molecules (residence time 100 ps) together with 
a thermodynamic analysis of water within 4.5 Å of the peptide revealed signiﬁcant 
differences between the hydration properties of the peptides. The solvation of ﬂexible

and restrained versions of each constructed peptide is illustrated in Fig. 7.6. Following 
the ﬁt, water molecules with short (t1 = 1 ps), intermediate (t2 = 4–9 ps) and longer 
(t3 = 10–30 ps) residence times can be distinguished. The calculations showed that 
tavg is 4.8 and 7.2 ps within 3.5 and 5 Å of the bulk water molecules, respectively, 
and water molecules with short (t1 = 1 ps), intermediate (t2 = 4–9 ps) and longer 
(t3 = 10–30 ps) residence times can be distinguished. 
The relationship between measures of fast side-chain motion and the under-
lying conformational entropy was evaluated using dynamic proxy approach [18]. 
A dynamic proxy class is a class that implements a list of interfaces speciﬁed at 
runtime such that a method invocation through one of the interfaces on an instance 
of the class will be encoded and dispatched to another object through a uniform inter-
face. The dynamical proxy showed that the contribution of conformational entropy 
can range from highly favorable to highly unfavorable and demonstrates the poten-
tial of key thermodynamic variable to modulate protein–ligand interactions. The 
role of solvent entropy and the loss in rotational-translational entropy that occurs

upon formation of high-afﬁnity complexes was also reﬁned. Enzyme lipase LipA 
(BSLA), was selected as a model protein for thermostabilization designs and the 
circular dichroism measurements, showed six combinatorial designs with improved 
stability at temperatures from 5.8 °C to 13.6 °C [76]. Molecular dynamic simulations 
revealed that: (1) The mutations alter the populations of conformational states and the 
increased ensembles of inactive conformations leading to a reduction in activity; (2) 
The mutations responsible for the reduced enzyme catalytic activity involved a short 
dynamic correlation path to disturbing the equilibrium conformation of active sites; 
(3) By removing N82V, which had a close dynamic correlation to the active sites 
in mutant D3, the redesigned mutant RD3 had an increased activity of 57.6%; and 
(4) The mutations responsible for the reduced enzyme catalytic activity involved a 
short dynamic correlation path to disturbing the equilibrium conformation of active 
sites. In study [88] attention has been paid to the role of ligand-gated conforma-
tional changes in triosephosphate isomerase and orotidine 5ʹ-monophosphate decar-
boxylase. Speciﬁcally, combined conventional and enhanced molecular dynamics 
simulations focused on the (βα)8 Barrel Enzymes Histidine and Tryptophan showed 
that μs timescale motion of a single loop dominates the transition between catalyti-
cally inactive and active conformations. Isomerase enzymes HisA and TrpF, and the 
bifunctional isomerase PriA multiple long loops undergo conformational transitions 
on slower timescale. In addition, the simulations provided details of the conforma-
tional behavior of the catalytic loops in HisA, PriA, and TrpF, and elucidated the role 
of their plasticity in facilitating bifunctionality in PriA and evolved HisA variants. 
The molecular dynamics simulations of glucose oxidase (GO) performed in [79] 
allowed to quantify this ﬂoppiness, revealing that His516 exists in two states: catalytic 
and noncatalytic. A2 GOx crystal structure with glucose docked into the active site is 
displayed in Fig. 7.6. The simulation indicated that the relative populations of these 
two sub-states are almost identical in the wild-type enzyme, with His516 shufﬂing 
between them. In the glucose oxidase mutants, on the other hand, the mutations 
enrich the catalytic His516 conformation and reduce the ﬂexibility of this residue, 
leading to an enhancement in their catalytic efﬁciency. This study stresses the beneﬁt 
of active site preorganization with respect to enzyme conversion rates by reducing 
molecular reorientation needs. To test the inﬂuence of the mutations on the protein 
dynamics, MD simulations of several GOx variants were performed. The simulation 
showed the root-mean-square deviation of the protein backbone motion, indicates 
that the WT and GOx mutants are stable during the 100 ns trajectories. A slight 
decrease in residue ﬂexibility, especially in the active site region was revealed by a 
detailed analysis of the enzyme dynamics related to the laboratory evolution of GOx.

Miscellaneous Dynamic Properties of Proteins Studied 
by Physical Methods 
The activity and dynamics of a simple, single subunit enzyme, the xylanase from 
Thermotoga maritima strain FJ SS3B.1 have been measured, from − 70 to + 10 °C 
[112]. Data on Neutron scattering indicated no evidence for anharmonic local diffu-
sive motions or jumps between alternative conformations in picosecond-timescale 
at temperatures below – 50°, whereas these motions are strongly activated at higher 
temperatures. The activity follows Arrhenius behavior over the whole of the temper-
ature range was investigated. Therefore, a temperature range exists over which the 
enzyme rate-limiting step is independent of fast anharmonic dynamics. Adenylate 
kinase (AK) involves a large-amplitude rearrangement of the enzyme’s lid domain. 
Using method of high-resolution single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer 
(FRET), it was possible to follow AK’s domain movements on its catalytic time scale 
[108]. Maximum entropy-based methods showed that AK is capable of dynamically 
sampling two distinct states, which correlate well with those observed by X-ray crys-
tallography. The experiment indicated that the equilibrium favors the closed, active-
site-forming conﬁgurations even in the absence of substrates. In addition, the exper-
iments indicated that interaction with substrates restricts the spatial extent of confor-
mational ﬂuctuations and shifts the enzyme’s conformational equilibrium toward the 
closed form by increasing the closing rate of the lid. Thus, integrating these micro-
scopic dynamics into macroscopic kinetics allowed to model lid opening-coupled 
product release as the enzyme’s rate-limiting step. 
In work [116] studies capable of examining μs relaxations in response to very 
rapid ns jumps in temperature of approximately 7 °C were implemented. T-jump 
induced ﬂuorescence (λex = 295 nm and λem = 355 nm) time was measured as a 
function of ﬁnal temperature. A thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase dynamics on 
the microsecond (μs) time scale were investigated in two variants of the enzyme, 
W87F and W87F:H43A. A biexponential ﬁtting of the data yielded two kinetically 
important processes: an initial, temperature independent loss of ﬂuorescence (τ1) 
with an average relaxation lifetime of 0.77 μs, and a slower microsecond relaxation 
that returns the system to its initial intensity (τ2). The present results suggested that 
motions can be critical for global conformational sampling in proteins. Frequency 
ﬂuctuations of the azide anion bound to the active site of formate dehydroge-
nase measured via 2D IR spectroscopy were examined [96]. These measurements 
revealed an underdamped oscillatory component to the frequency-frequency corre-
lation function when the azide anion is bound to the NAD+ ternary complex. This 
oscillation disappears when the reduced cofactor is added and was suggested to 
be relevant to donor–acceptor distance sampling of the catalyzed hydride transfer. 
IR photon echo measurement of the formate dehydrogenase-NAD+-azide ternary 
complex was carried out [107]. The data showed complete spectral diffusion on the 
femtosecond-picosecond time scale. This ﬁnding indicated that for transition-state 
analog complex samples the distribution of azide vibrational frequencies occurs 
within a few picoseconds.

Molecular Dynamics of Proteins and Their Functional Activity
Temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on 
enzyme cyclophilin (CypA) demonstrated that these experiments are able to capture 
functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale [99]. 
The resulting time-resolved signal was used to assess the kinetics of conforma-
tional changes. The experiment indicated that the enzyme displays rich dynamics 
following a temperature jump including intramolecular protein dynamics on the 
microsecond timescale [114]. Overview of temperature-jump SAXS/WAXS experi-
ments is displayed in Fig. 7.7. Two relaxation processes were resolved: a fast process 
is related to surface loop motions, and a slower process is related to motions in the 
core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover. Speciﬁc mutants in the 
“loops” or the “core” regions of CypA indicated that the two processes are inde-
pendent. Using a nonlinear least-squares curve-ﬁtting algorithm, rate constants of 
98 × 104 s−1 for the fast process (k1) and 2.5 × 104 s−1 for the slow process (k2) 
at 26.7 °C (299.7 K) were measured. In addition, the thermodynamic properties of 
transition states were calculated: for the fast process ΔH = 37 KJ mol−1 and ΔS = 
32 mol−1 K−1 and for the slow process ΔH = 27 KJ mol−1 and ΔS = − 34 mol−1 K−1.
NMR spectroscopy being applied to the study of conformational dynamic 
processes in enzymes was utilized for investigation of the bacterial RNase H 
dynamics [110]. Among the results of the work, the following ones can be noted: 
(1) Spin relaxation measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the 
enzyme showed that one of three loop regions that interact with substrates, inter-
converts between two conformations; (2) NMR spin relaxation and ﬂuorescence 
spectroscopy have characterized a conformational transition in AlkB between an 
open state, in which the side chains of methionine residues in the active site are 
disordered, and a closed state, in which these residues are ordered; (3) Closure of 
active site loop 6 in triosephosphate isomerase is critical for forming the Michaelis 
complex; (4) Reopening of the loop after the reaction is rate limiting; (5) NMR 
spin relaxation and MD simulations of triosephosphate isomerase in complex with 
glycerol 3-phosphate 
demonstrated that closure of loop is a correlated rigid-body motion; (6) The MD 
simulations also indicate that motions of Gly173 in the most ﬂexible region of loop 6 
contribute to opening of the active site loop for product release; and (7) The enzyme 
undergoes conformational exchange with similar values of kex = ∼ 4 × 104 s−1. 
It was found that tetrameric hemoglobin binds ligands cooperatively by under-
going a ligand-induced T → R quaternary structure transition [121]. A structure– 
function relationship that has served as a model system for understanding allostery 
in proteins was examined. Time-resolved small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering

were measured in succession until all of the desired delay times were acquired, then the sequence 
was repeated as many as 50 times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. Note that the ﬁrst

dynamics. Time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography utilizing at an X-ray 
free-electron laser was used to resolve the ultrafast structural changes in the carbon-
monoxy myoglobin complex upon photolysis of the Fe–CO bond [122]. The exper-
iments indicated that structural changes appear throughout the protein within 500 
femtoseconds, with the C, F, and H helices moving away from the heme cofactor 
and the E and A helices moving toward itю. So the protein globule behaves like a 
molecular sponge. Together with the observed oscillations of residues contacting the 
heme, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations predicted that 
an immediate collective response of the protein occurs upon ligand dissociation, as 
a result of heme vibrational modes coupling to global modes of the protein. Light

Fig. 7.8 The sample (a 2.35-mM MbCO solution) was circulated in a closed loop through a fused-
silica capillary (0.3 mm diameter) positioned at the overlap between the X-ray pulses (9 keV, 
30 fs) produced by the LCLS (~ 1010 photons per pulse at 9 keV are transmitted by a silicon 
monochromator) and the photolysis pulses (538 nm, 250 fs) produced by the optical laser system 
(~ 0.3 mJ mm−2). By monitoring the pattern of the X-rays scattered by the sample at different 
time delays between the optical and X-ray pulses, it was possible to track the structural changes 
occurring in the sample after photolysis [123]. Published under the terms of the Creative Commons

absorption by MbCO in solution can trigger protein conformational changes -the 
light-induced structural rearrangement, propagating through the protein as a quake-
like intramolecular motion (Fig. 7.8) [123]. To decipher the exact timescale of the 
ultrafast structural dynamics in Mb, femtosecond time-resolved X-ray solution scat-
tering experiments on Mb at the LCLS X-FEL have been performed. Laser-induced 
time-resolved difference scattering curves obtained by photoexciting a solution of 
horse MbCO with 250 fs pulses at 538 nm were presented in a ﬁgure. The experi-
ment showed that an ultrafast increase of myoglobin radius of gyration occurs within 
picosecond. The process is followed by a delayed protein expansion and equilibrium 
undergoes with damped with a ~ 3.6-picosecond time period oscillations undergo. 
Figure 7.9 illustrates how the collective mode involves large protein regions from 
the active site to the protein surface and indicates an area of protein quake. Such 
coupling with the mode at ~ 4 ps was already suggested on the basis of transient 
grating investigations [125, 126].
bullet Ultrafast structural dynamics with different spatial and temporal scales were inves-
tigated during photodissociation of carbon monoxide from iron(II)-heme in bovine 
myoglobin after the ﬁrst 3 ps following laser excitation [124]. Simultaneous X-ray 
transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy and X-ray transient solution scattering 
(XSS) at an X-ray free-electron laser source with a time resolution of 80 fs were 
employed. In order to extract the reaction coordinates along different directions of 
the CO departure, XTA data were collected with parallel and perpendicular relative 
polarizations of the laser pump and X-ray probe pulse. Time-dependent density-
functional theory calculations were used to model the time evolution of the iron 
K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Time-resolved small-
angle X-ray scattering data during the same process indicated that the local CO 
dissociation causes a protein quake propagating on different spatial and temporal 
scales. Thus, these experiments made it possible to establish interplays of electron 
and nuclear motions along CO dissociation trajectory in myoglobin.

Protein Dynamics and Their Functional Activity 
and Evolution 
NMR studies of cyclophilin A (CypA), rotamase A, prolyl cis–trans isomerase or 
peptidyl-prolyl isomerase A (PPIA) have revealed a link between internal protein 
dynamics and substrate isomerization step [1, 33]. The studies, basing on 15N spin  
relaxation investigations of small peptide substrate as well as two-dimensional (2D) 
1H–15N heteronuclear exchange studies of the N-terminal of capsid protein (CAN) 
from HIV-1 showed that: (1) Conformational ﬂuctuations within the active site of 
CypA were detected on the time scale of the reaction (hundreds of microseconds); 
(2) The rates of conformational dynamics correlated with the substrate isomerization 
step; (3) Several active-site and surface loop regions showed motions only in the 
presence of substrate; and (4) The residues Arg55, Lys82, Leu98, Ser99, Ala101, 
Asn102, Ala103, and Gly109 involve in this process.. The authors proposed a reaction 
mechanism for PPIase activity of CypA, where the isomerization step takes place with 
a rate constant of about 9000 s−1 and motions of the protein coincide with the rate of 
substrate turnover step. CypA residue Arg55 was suggested to be a major contributor 
to catalysis, for which the observed changes in backbone conformation are likely to 
be coupled with motions of the catalytically essential side chain. The dynamics 
of the cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were

266

Molecular Dynamics of Proteins and Their Functional Activity
characterized with NMR relaxation experiments [33]. The experiments indicated 
that: (1) The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already 
present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover 
rates; (2) The protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the 
enzyme and may limit the overall turnover rate; (3) Motion is localized not only to 
the active site but also to a wider dynamic network; and (4) The collective nature 
of motions occur also in mutant forms of CypA. The authors proposed that the pre-
existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature 
of biocatalysts. The enzyme investigations have led to the discovery of a network of 
protein vibrations promoting catalysis [11]. 
The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of (cyclophilin A) 
CypA has been investigated in detail to establish the link between protein 
dynamics and enzymatic catalysis, both by biochemical experiments and theoret-
ical methods. Temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measure-
ments on cyclophilin A which are able to capture functional intramolecular protein 
dynamics on the microsecond timescale were performed. The authors of the review 
[35] focused on the role of mutations in the study of possible links between the 
dynamics of molecular enzymes and their catalytic activity. Structure of CypA and 
the inﬂuence of its dynamics on the kinetics of prolyl isomerization in its substrate 
is displayed in Fig. 7.10. The following main results were reported: (1) In dihydro-
folate reductase (DHFR) and CypA mutations, that alter the ability of the active site 
to sample productive higher energy states on the millisecond time scale, reduced 
the rate of hydride transfer; (2) For CypA, a network of side-chains that exchange 
between two conformations is critical for catalysis exists; (3) Mutations that lock 
the network in one state also reduce catalytic activity; and (4) In computationally 
designed DHFR and CypA directed evolution experiments increase catalytic rates. 
The connection between stochastic protein dynamics and function for the CypA in 
wild-type form (WT), and three variants (ST, STCS, and STCSIV) that feature several 
mutations distal from the active site was theoretically examined [91]. Eighty inde-
pendent 200 ns MD trajectories of the apo WT, ST, STCS, and STCSIV proteins (20 
each) were generated using Gromacs 5.052. Series of umbrella sampling US simu-
lations of the “in” and “out” conformers were performed to compute free energy 
proﬁles along ω procedure. Markov state models (MSM) analysis was carried out 
with the software package pyemma version 2.3.2. The simulation indicated that: (1) 
In WT free form the enzyme rapidly interconverts between a catalytically active 
Phe113 “in” form and a catalytically inactive Phe113 “out” form (Fig. 7.10a) with 
the interconversion rate between in and out forms (7 × 107 s−1); (2) The latter is 
faster than the substrate binding rate as suggested by NMR experiments (ca. 2 × 
104 s−1), based on kon rate ca. 2 × 107 s−1 M−1; and (3) For the mutants, the inter-
conversion rates between catalytically active and inactive forms are within the μs−1 
timescale (Fig. 7.10b). It was concluded that the minor active site conformation is 
catalytically impaired, and decreased catalytic activity of the mutants is caused by 
changes in Phe113 motions on a ns-μs timescale.
The application of NMR probes to the investigation of motions in enzymes at the 
picosecond to nanosecond as well as microsecond to millisecond time scales was

described [105]. Studies in enzyme dynamics including conformational selection 
in RNase A, reaction coordinate compression in Esch coli dihydrofolate reductase, 
substrate binding and drug resistance in HIV protease were carried out. Protein 
dynamics during turnover in cyclophilin A, mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes, 
and protein dynamics in larger enzymes were in the center of interest of the author’s 
work. The role of adenylate kinase (AK) protein component at atomic resolution 
was directly investigated utilizing NMR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
[106]. This approach allowed to establish a connection between pico- to nano-second 
backbone ﬂuctuations and the slower motions associated with catalytic activity. NMR 
relaxation data (R1, R2, and 1H–15N heteronuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) 
were acquired using standard pulse sequences on Varian Innova 500 and 600 MHz 
spectrometers. Fast-ModelFree10 and ModelFree 4.1512 were employed to optimize 
the ﬁt of both internal dynamics and global tumbling parameters. The NMR module 
in CHARMM27 allowed to calculate the auto-correlation function of the second 
Legendre polynomial of every N–H bond vector. Differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) was performed with a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal). The experi-
ments indicated that the correspondence of ps–ns ﬂexibility in the hinges provides 
the link between local, fast-timescale dynamics and slower, global lid-opening/-
closing. It was concluded that pico- to nano-second timescale ﬂuctuations in hinge 
regions of AK facilitate the large-scale slower lid motions that produce a catalytically 
competent state.

Work [79] presented a synergistic combination of experimental and computa-
tional methods, indicating how mutations, even located at distant from the active 
site, positively affect glucose oxidase catalysis. Determination of the crystal struc-
tures of glucose oxidase mutants containing molecular oxygen in the active site 
and the molecular dynamics simulations allowed: (1) quantifying the enzyme ﬂop-
piness, (2) revealing that His516 exists in two states: catalytic and noncatalytic; 
and (3) Understanding that in the glucose oxidase mutants the mutations enrich the 
catalytic His516 conformation and reduce the ﬂexibility of this residue, leading to an 
enhancement in their catalytic efﬁciency. The authors stressed the beneﬁt of active 
site preorganization with respect to enzyme conversion rates by reducing molecular 
reorientation needs. Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) response from a 
Trp-NADH donor–acceptor pair in T-jump studies of a thermophilic alcohol dehydro-
genase, microsecond protein motions that can be directly related to active site chem-
istry were detected [115]. Two distinctive transients were observed: a slow, kinetic 
process lacking a temperature break and a faster transient that is only detectable 
above 30 °C. The latter establishes a link between enzyme activity and microsecond 
protein motions near the cofactor binding site. 
Work [91] investigates the connection between stochastic protein dynamics and 
function for the enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) in wild-type form, and three variants 
that feature several mutations distal from the active site.. The present study uses a 
variety of extensive equilibrium and biased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 
to clarify the link between catalytic activity and rates of molecular motions of CypA 
in wild-type and the three mutant variants. The simulation indicated that the free 
enzyme rapidly equilibrates between catalytically active and inactive forms before 
substrate binding (Fig. 7.10a) and for the mutants, the equilibrium is shifted toward 
the catalytically inactive form (Fig. 7.10b). 
Recent works on some selected protein systems have addressed the role of 
dynamics in enzyme evolution [92–94]. The role of protein dynamics in the evolution 
of new enzyme function obtained during the laboratory evolution of a phosphotri-
esterase (PTEs) from Pseudomonas diminuta to an arylesterase was examined [93]. 
Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is an innovative approach for the generation of 
evolved microbial strains with desired characteristics, by implementing the rules of 
natural selection as presented in the Darwinian Theory. Analysis of the structures and 
dynamics of nine protein variants along this trajectory, and three rationally designed 
variants, revealed cycles of structural destabilization and repair. Evolutionary pres-
sure can “freeze out” unproductive motions and sampling of distinct conformations. 
This data set also demonstrated how the destabilizing effects from many mutations 
can be repaired in subsequent generations. Role of unique conformations that can 
catalyze either phosphotriester or arylester hydrolysis in bifunctional intermediates 
was discussed in detail. 
Review [93, 94] examined various aspects of the evolutionary relation between 
protein dynamics and the chemical step in dihydrofolate reductases and alcohol 
dehydrogenases. The tool kit of kinetics, kinetic isotope effects, molecular biology, 
biophysics, and bioinformatics provided means to link evolutionary changes in

protein. The ﬁndings suggested that protein dynamics across an entire enzyme can 
play a role in adaptation to differing physiological conditions. Author of paper 
[24] focused on a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase for which the chemical 
step of hydride transfer is rate determining. Kinetic isotope effects, time-dependent 
hydrogen/deuterium exchange, ﬂuorescent lifetimes and Stokes shifts were employed 
to probe the properties of the chemical and conformational coordinates. A long-range 
network of protein motions in alcohol dehydrogenase oxidoreductase-like protein 
was observed. The motion extended from a dimer interface to the substrate binding 
domain across to the cofactor binding domain, over a distance of ca. 30 Å, were 
deﬁned. 
Two second-shell mutations that partially restore its catalytic activity were 
designed and examined [92]. To identify mutations that rescue the catalytic activity 
of mutant S99T CypA the effect of the mutations was investigated employing 
NMR, a room-temperature X-ray crystallography and multiconformer modeling-
[92]. CypmA mutants were generated employing site-directed mutagenesis on the 
CypA S99T plasmid utilizing the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and the 
primer sequences. Enzyme activity. kcat/KM for the enzyme-catalyzed cis-to-trans 
isomerization of succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide 
and succinyl-AFPF-p-nitroanilide was measured at 10 °C using the standard 
chymotrypsin-coupled assay. NMR experiments were recorded on an Agilent DD2 
600 MHz four-channel spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryogenically 
cooled probe-head or a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. Relaxation disper-
sion experiments on CypA were carry out on a 600 MHz spectrometer at different 
temperatures using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). 15N-CEST exper-
iments on CypA were recorded on a 500 MHz spectrometer at 10 °C for two (single-
and triple-mutants) or three (doublemutant) different 15N B1 ﬁeld strengths. The 
following results were reported: (1) The changes in an enzyme’s energy landscape 
upon directed evolution, designed second-shell mutation, S99T, in CypA were eval-
uated; (2) Mutations that rescue the catalytic activity of S99T CypA was identiﬁed; 
(3)The X-ray measurement directly revealed increased conformational exchange 
between two catalytically essential sub-states (See details in capture of Fig. 7.11). In 
addition, three effects: inverting the equilibrium between two states that are essential

which site-speciﬁcally attached at cysteine residue C229, near the active site [104]. 
The picosecond time-dependent ﬂuorescence Stokes shift indicated slow solvation 
dynamics at the active site of the enzyme, in the absence of substrate. The solva-
tion dynamics becomes still slower when the substrate (glutamine or tRNA(Gln)) 
binds to the enzyme. Thus, the slow dynamics is indeed associated with the active 
site. A detailed study of functionally relevant RNase A dynamics in the wild-type 
enzyme and a D121A mutant form by NMR spin-relaxation techniques showed that 
in the wild-type enzyme, the dynamic properties were conserved in the apo, enzyme– 
substrate, and enzyme-product complexes [111]. Mutation of Asp-121 to Ala (mutant 
D121A) disrupted the timing of active site dynamics in the product release step, and 
resulted in 90% loss of catalytic activity. Through characterization of the solvent 
isotope effect on protein dynamics, determinants of the rate limitation to enzyme 
catalysis were examined. A global conformational change in RNase A, was found to 
be sensitive to solvent deuterium content. The authors concluded that Asp-121 plays 
a signiﬁcant role in coordinating the millisecond dynamic events in RNase. 
Two methods of small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) experiments on 
ubiquitin [a small (8.6 kDa) regulatory protein Ub], hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), 
and myoglobin (Mb) by which is possible calculate SWAXS patterns were developed 
[90]. The suggested ﬁrst approach used all-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations, while the second method involved prediction of the hydration 
density around a protein employing new HyPred solvation model. A solvent model 
is a computational method which enable simulations and thermodynamic calculations 
applicable to reactions and processes which take place in solution. All-atom explicit-
solvent MD simulations have been performed at 4 °C for 50 ns for Ub (Protein Data 
Bank (PDB) code 1UBQ, HEWL (PDB 6LYZ), and Mb (PDB 1WLA), employing 
NAMD and the CHARMM 27 all-atom force ﬁeld. HyPred proceeded by calculating 
a set of proximal radial distribution functions (pRDFs), for ~ 300 different categories 
of atoms in proteins using all-atom, explicit-solvent MD simulations. The SWAXS 
patterns obtained from the HyPred model agreed to both experimental data and the 
patterns predicted by the MD simulations. 
The enzyme Candida Antarctica lipase B (CALB) was served as a model for under-
standing connections among hydration layer dynamics, solvation shell structure, and 
protein surface structure [19]. The starting coordinates for simulations of CALB 
enzyme were taken from the X-ray crystallographic structure (resolution: 1.55 Å). 
MD simulations were performed using GROMACS software package. AMBER03 
force ﬁeld48 was used for the CALB enzyme, and the SPC/E water model49 was 
employed to represent water. The protein force ﬁeld GROMOS53a650 was used for 
the CALB enzyme with SPC/E water. The structure and dynamics of water molecules 
in the hydration layer were characterized for regions of the CALB surface, divided 
around each α-helix, β-sheet, and loop structure. The regional hydration dynamics 
within the 4 conformational stages of the enzyme (open, closed, crystal like, and 
transitioning) were examined. A color-coded map of CALB–water hydrogen bond 
lifetimes (HBLTs) for α-helices, β-sheets and connector regions were shown in a 
ﬁgure.

Results indicated that: (1) Regional differences in the structure of the biomolec-
ular hydration layer were found to be concomitant with variations in dynamics; (2) 
Regions of higher density exhibit faster water dynamics; (3) Effects of protein surface 
topology and hydrophobicity on water structure and dynamics were evaluated using 
multiregression analysis; (4) Concave and hydrophobic protein surfaces favor a less 
dense and more tetrahedral solvation layer, akin to a more ice-like structure, with 
slower dynamics); (5) Pairwise entropies of local hydration layers were calculated 
from regional radial distribution functions, scale logarithmically with local hydra-
tion dynamics; and (6) The Rosenfeld relationship (relationship between entropy and 
diffusion) describes the heterogeneous structure–dynamics of the hydration layer 
around the enzyme Candida Antarctica lipase B (CALB). According to Rosenfeld

Dispersion measurements was used to probe the tryptophan indoles in the enzyme 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme in which μs-ms motions are closely 
coupled to enzyme function [113]. Experimental chemical shifts and density func-
tional theory based chemical shift were compared. The experiment and theory 
revealed that: (1) During structural changes on the μs-ms timescale, large chem-
ical shift changes for the NH proton on the indole ring take place; (2) Relatively 
smaller chemical shift changes are for the ring nitrogen atom; (3) During the struc-
tural change the tryptophan indole NHs remains bound to water, but the geometry of 
the protein-bound water networks changes; and (4) Relaxation dispersion measure-
ments can indirectly probe water dynamics on the μs ms timescale. As an illustration 
of the approach, Fig. 7.12 indicates the conserved active site waters in the closed 
ground state conformation of WT E. coli DHFR bound to folate: NADP+. These 
ﬁndings emphasize the role of the water molecules in binding and coupling of the 
substrate to the protein and in transmitting information between functionally impor-
tant regions of the protein. In addition, these ﬁnding provide evidence that internal 
protein motions can be coupled through the mediation of hydrogen-bonded water 
bound in the protein structure.

Enthalpy–Entropy Relationships 
in Enzyme Reactions 
Abstract Enthalpy–entropy compensation (EEC) referred to the behavior of a series 
of closely related enzyme reactions exhibits a linear relationship between one of the 
following kinetic or thermodynamic parameters and isokinetic or thermodynamic 
temperatures. The enthalpy–entropy compensation effect in enzymatic catalysis was 
ﬁrst described by Likhtenshtein in 1966. In this chapter, separate sections are devoted 
to statistical artifacts at apparent enthalpy–entropy compensation, theoretical consid-
eration of EEC, EES for small molecules, EES for peptides and proteins, and miscel-
laneous examples of EEC in enzyme catalysis. The following compensation pairs of 
energy–entropy activation were considered: hydrolysis catalyzed by carboxypepsi-

Introduction 
Many kinetic and thermodynamical studies concerning homologous reaction series 
reported the existence of an activation enthalpy–entropy linear correlation (compen-
sation plot. The temperature at which all the members of the series have the same rate 
constant called isokinetic temperature [1–24]. The enthalpy–entropy compensations 
(EEC) have been reported in many chemical, physical, biological and food processes 
and can give information about the reaction mechanism and whether the reaction is 
controlled by enthalpy or entropy [1–46]. Compensations phenomena also have been 
expanded for the thermodynamic enthalpy and entropy phenomena. 
Constable [25] found a straight line relation between the logarithm of the 
frequency factor (corresponding approximately to the entropy of activation ΔS#) and 
the energy of activation (corresponding approximately to the enthalpy of activation 
ΔH#). The next principle step in the area was made by Lefﬂer [1] and Exner [2].The 
enthalpy–entropy compensation effect in enzymatic catalysis was ﬁrst described by

Enthalpy–Entropy Relationships in Enzyme Reactions
Likhnenshtein in 1966 [3, 4]. The following compensation pairs of energy–entropy 
activation were considered: hydrolysis catalyzed by carboxypepsidase, transforma-
tion fumarate to malate catalyzed by fumarase, α-amylase reaction of starch hydrol-
ysis, reactions catalyzed by unvertase, urease, lipase as well as enthalpy–entropy 
compensation at binding various inhibitors with catalase, and at inhibition bacterial 
luminescence. The energy Ea and entropy (ΔS#) activation of enzymatic reactions 
were found to be sensitive to the structure of substrate, temperature regions, pH, 
solvent composition, etc. Later compensation phenomena in the enzyme catalysis 
were conﬁrmed by Lumry and Rajender [5, 6]. Likhtenshtein and Lumry indepen-
dently explained this effect by the cooperative rearrangement (“melting”) of the 
water ensemble accompanying the elementary chemical act of an enzyme reaction 
[4–6, 14–24] and the thermodynamic parameters of the water reorganization can be 
included in the experimental values of the energy and entropy of the activation. The 
fact that compensation effects can be associated with conformational rearrangements 
and reorganization of cooperative ensembles of water molecules in proteins was indi-
cated by data on protein denaturation, which showed the decisive role of moisture on 
the enthalpy and entropy parameters of protein denaturation in the enormous range 
of energy activation (Ea) values (from 0 to 120 kcal/mol) and ΔS# (from 10 to 400 eu) 
[21] and references therein. Nanosecond intermolecular mobility of proteins consists 
of movement of the relatively large and rigid parts of the protein (domains) [15–19] 
(Sect. 8.4). Such hinge-like oscillation of the tightly packed polypeptide blocks does 
not give a measurable contribution to the helicity degree of polypeptide chains, the 
overall heat capacity and entropy. The point is that a change in the structure of a 
substrate or an inhibitor upon binding to an enzyme or a shift in protein domains 
upon a change in protein conformation should not signiﬁcantly affect the entropy 
and enthalpy of the processes. Subsequent experimental and theoretical studies, on 
the one hand, conﬁrmed the predominant contribution of water reorganization to the 
thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions and revealed many 
important aspects of the process, on the other hand. Recently various aspects of the 
enthalpy–entropy compensation effect (EECE) in kinetics and thermodynamics in 
molecular biological processes were widely discussed [47–65].

Early Theoretic Considerations 
For numerous enzyme reactions, the following linear dependences are satisﬁed:
nor m al upper D
elta upper H equals normal upper Delta upper H Superscript ring Baseline plus beta normal upper Delta upper S
where ΔH° is constant regardless of substituents, ΔH and ΔS is different for each 
substituent. Inserting the Gibbs free-energy equation and combining like terms 
produces the following equation:
nor m al upper  Delta 
upper G equals normal upper Delta upper H Superscript ring Baseline minus left parenthesis upper T minus beta Subscript c Baseline right parenthesis normal upper Delta upper S

8.2 Early Theoretic Considerations
281
βc has the dimension of temperature and is referred to as the isothermodynamic 
temperature because at βc = T, ΔG = ΔH°, that is, all reactants in the series having 
different ΔS ran with the same rate. For enzyme reactions, the experimental values of 
ΔH and ΔS can be apparent parameters, which jointly reﬂect the entire complexity of 
the process (presence of intermediate microsteps, involving accompanying confor-
mational transitions and solvent molecules reorganization). In particular, following 
the assumption about involving water molecules reorganization in an enzymatic 
reaction, the contribution of the corresponding parameters of the reorganization of a 
cooperative ensemble of n molecules of water, to the experimental thermodynamic 
and kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions is expected [4]. Equations (8.3) and 
(8.4) can be written as a ﬁrst approximation:
nor m al u pper D
elta upper H equals normal upper Delta upper H Subscript r Baseline plus n normal upper Delta upper H 0
and
nor m al u pper D
elta upper S equals normal upper Delta upper S Subscript r Baseline plus n normal upper Delta upper S Subscript o
where ΔHr and ΔSr are attributed to enthalpy and entropy of the chemical step, 
respectively; n is the number water molecules in the ensemble; ΔH0 and ΔSo are the 
standard enthalpy and entropy of the rearrangement of on elementary units. Assuming 
that the reorganization of water makes a decisive contribution and taking into account 
the Eqs. (8.1–8.4), then we obtain 
bet a equals  nor
mal upper Delta upper H 0 divided by normal upper Delta upper S Subscript o Baseline equals upper T Subscript m
where T m is the “melting” temperature of the cooperative assemble which is expected 
to be close to average temperature of the experiment T av. In general case, the chemical 
reaction and the accompanying water rearrangement cannot be regarded as indepen-
dent events. If the quantities of ΔH and ΔS can be represented, to a ﬁrst approx-
imation, as linear function of n with the coefﬁcient being, respectively, equal to a 
and b, then the equilibrium (or isokinetic) temperature, under the condition of the 
predominant contribution of the process of reorganization of the “melting” of the 
water ensemble, will be given by 
beta equals left parenthesis a divided by b right parenthesis left parenthesis normal upper Delta upper H 0 divided by normal upper Delta upper S Subscript o Baseline right parenthesis equals left parenthesis a divided by b right parenthesis upper T Subscript m Baseline almost equals left parenthesis a divided by b right parenthesis upper T Subscript av Baseline period 
Thus, depending on the mechanism of the inﬂuence of hydration on the enthalpy 
and entropy parameters of the chemical reaction, the value of β will be greater or less 
than the average temperature of the experiment. Equation (8.3) allows to roughly 
estimate number of water molecules involving in reaction in the enzyme active site. 
For example, taking energy activation of a chemical step of an enzyme reaction Er = 
4–5 kcal mol–1, the molar enthalpy of fusion for ice ΔHo = 1.400 kcal mol–1 (https:// 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy) and typical experimental values Ea = 25–35 kcal 
mol–1, Eq.  (8.3) gives reasonable number of the water molecules in the ensemble

in vicinity of the active cite n = 15–20. These values are in agreement with the 
corresponding experimental data on water in proteins (Chap. 7). A similar analysis 
can be applied to the binding of substrates and inhibitors to proteins. 
The values of enthalpy and entropy can be temperature dependent, that is,
nor m al upper Delta u ppe r  H equals nor
mal upper Delta upper H left parenthesis d upper H slash d upper T right parenthesis and normal upper Delta upper S equals normal upper Delta upper S left parenthesis d normal upper Delta upper S slash d upper T right parenthesis period 
Once, having lived these functions in a series and limiting ourselves to the ﬁrst 
two terms of the expansion, we get:
nor m al upper Delta upper H e q uals normal uper
 Delta upper H Superscript ring Baseline plus alpha left parenthesis d upper H slash d upper T right parenthesis and normal upper Delta upper S equals normal upper Delta upper S Superscript ring Baseline plus beta left parenthesis d normal upper Delta upper S slash d upper T right parenthesis period 
If the values of ΔH° and ΔS° refer to the chemical stage of the process and can 
be considered constant and small in the given series, then α(dH/dT) and β(dΔS/dT) 
will determine the experimental values of the corresponding parameters. In this case

In a quantitative approach [40], a statistical test to compare the harmonic mean

was proposed. In Eq. (8.10) σ is the standard error in T comp and the Student’s t-
value depends on the chosen conﬁdence level and the number of samples, i.e. the 
number of ΔH, and ΔS data pairs. For a 95 % conﬁdence level t is close to 2 for large 
data sets. The authors concluded that if T hm falls within experimental temperature 
interval, the EEC is probably of statistical nature. The general statistical mechanical 
basis for solvent induced isokinetic/isoequilibrium entropy–enthalpy compensation 
in chemical reactions and adsorption which can be used to control of rate processes 
and binding constants in diverse applications, was established in [38]. When the 
temperature rate-constant data are ﬁtted according to an Arrhenius plot, the exper-
imental errors associated with the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy 
are mutually interdependent. This result has been qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 8.1. 
Thus, there is a statistic compensation that consists of the propagation of experi-
mental errors, and this effect has to be considered before concluding kinetic and/or 
thermodynamic compensation.
A program for statistically correct calculations of the enthalpy−entropy relation-
ship was introduced [41]. The program is applicable generally for linear regression 
when several regression lines are constrained by a common point of intersection.

The blue straight line corresponds to the real behavior of the process. The green line simulates 
the situation found when the errors associated with the higher temperatures are positive and those 
associated with the lower temperatures negative, whereas the red line shows the opposite case. The 
intercrossing point marks the position of the apparent isokinetic temperature [38]. With permission

The difference between a correct and incorrect statistical treatment was illustrated 
by several examples. 
A general statistical mechanical Gaussian density of states model of a complex 
system was analyzed to explore whether and under what conditions extra-
thermodynamic compensation can occur [42]. This model suggested that the most 
likely behavior to be seen is linear S–H compensation over a rather limited range 
of perturbations with a compensation temperature β = dΔH/dΔS within 20% of 
the experimental temperature. Using suggested probability distribution, a plot of ΔS 
versus ΔE was generated for a systematic series of perturbations. The resulting plot 
was found to be ellipsoidal direction (Fig. 8.2).
Three different topics were covered theoretically and illustrated by examples [36]: 
(1) The effect of systematic errors in experimental kinetic data which created apparent 
compensation effects; (2) Analysis of kinetic data when the Arrhenius parameters 
depend on another parameter; and (3) The effect of analyzing the temperature depen-
dence of an overall rate of reaction, rather than a rate constant. It was concluded that 
a mathematical origin of the effect should be carefully considered before any physic-
ochemical conclusions are drawn. An account of the role of ΔG along with ΔH and 
ΔS in the understanding of such EEC correlations using authentic literature data was 
presented and discussed [34]. It was stressed that planned studies on similar systems 
with a wide range of ΔG values are required for realistic evaluation of the EEC. 
As a result of study [39], a computer program has been developed to evaluate the 
probability that experimental errors might lead to a linear compensation plot parting 
from an initial randomly scattered set of activation parameters (p-test). The applica-
tion of the p-test to a reaction series is illustrated in Fig. 8.3. Use of this program 
to kinetic data for 100 homologous reaction series allowed concluding that most

of the reported compensation plots can hardly be explained by the accumulation of 
experimental errors. 
A new method, called Combined K-CQF developed in [44] made it possible both 
to quantify the degree of coalescence of experimental Van ‘t Hoff lines and to verify 
whether or not the Enthalpy–Entropy Compensation is of a statistical origin at a 
desired conﬁdence level. The new method requires only a standard least square ﬁt

of the enthalpy ΔH versus entropy ΔS plot to determine the two essential dimen-
sionless parameters K and CQF. The parameter K indicates the position (in inverse 
temperature) of the coalescence region of Van ‘t Hoff plots and CQF is a quanti-
tative measure of the smallest spread of the Van ‘t Hoff plots. The position of the 
(K, CQF) couple with respect to universal conﬁdence contours determined from a 
large number of simulations of random Van ‘t Hoff plots indicated whether or not the 
ΔH–ΔS compensation is a statistical artifact. In work [45] on the base of isothermal 
titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements, statistical analysis of the selected experi-
mental thermodynamic data was performed. Data on a variety of 171 protein–peptide, 
protein–carbohydrate, and protein–nucleotide interactions in addition to natural and 
synthetic inhibitors involving 32 proteins were analyzed. ΔΔH versus ΔΔG plots 
revealed a wide variation in the extent of compensation for different ligand modi-
ﬁcations. Figure 8.4 illustrates a strong diagonal distribution in a ΔH versus TΔS 
plot with a Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of 0.97. This coefﬁcient is a measure the 
strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. 
The slope of the ΔΔH versus TΔΔS plot for data drawn from the 32 proteins was 
found to be close to unity for both the experimental data (1.01) and for the constrained 
random model (1.04) for same number of data points (Fig. 8.5).
Work [13] reviewed how to deal with kinetic and thermodynamic compensa-
tions physically, mathematically and statistically. Statistical analysis of data from 
32 diverse proteins showed a signiﬁcant and widespread tendency to compensation. 
ΔΔH versus ΔΔG plots revealed a wide variation in the extent of compensation for 
different ligand modiﬁcation.

Theory Gaussian distribution of internal vibration energy levels to explain changes in 
internal enthalpy (ΔΔH = 0.8 kcal mol–1) and entropy (ΔTΔS = 0.8 kcal mol–1) for

The parameter µ is the mean of expectation of the distribution while the parameter 
is its standard deviation. Concerning the problem considered here, x = ΔH, ΔS and 
μ is the correspondent mean or expectation of the distribution. Data on occupancy 
probabilities [P(U)] for a system with a Gaussian distribution of energy levels (T = 
298 K; σ = 1.5 kcal mol–1, correlated changes in internal energy (U) and entropy 
(TS) for a series of perturbations of different energy levels, and H/S compensation for 
a hydrogen bond modeled by a Morse potential were presented in a separate ﬁgure 
and discussed in details. 
According to [46], the nature of EEC can be connected with the behavior of phase 
volume of systems, Ω. A phase space is a space in which all possible states of a 
system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point 
in the phase space. The role of other thermodynamic parameters, which describe 
series in manifestation of this or that types of the ΔH compensation, was discussed

in light of molecular statistical mechanics. Speciﬁcally, it was shown that the nature 
of the ΔH − ΔS compensation can be associated with the behavior of the phase 
volume of systems, Ω, namely, the ΔH − ΔS compensation is realized in the case if 
only in a series of systems the value of Ω is constant. The ΔH − (ΔS + RΔ ln Ω) 
compensation take place in the case of variable phase volume in a series of systems, 
that is, δΔH/(δΔS + RδΔ ln Ω) = Ti. In different series of systems, the following 
types of compensation were revealed:

The study on single-ion hydration thermodynamics from clusters to bulk solution [47] 
was based on the cluster-pair-based approximation (CPA) technique. The resulting 
hydration thermodynamic properties of ions were obtained by the simulation method-
ology and revealed enthalpy–entropy compensation relationship. Value TΔaqScon/ 
ΔaqHcon = 0.09 indicated a predominance of the enthalpy factor over the entropy 
factor during hydration of ionic species (Fig. 8.6).
Hydrophobicity is the association of nonpolar groups or molecules in an aqueous 
environment which arises from the tendency of water to exclude nonpolar molecules 
[48]. When two nonpolar surfaces associate with each other, ordered molecules of 
water solvating each surface are released to the bulk yields a favorable change in 
entropy and unfavorable change in enthalpy and an unfavorable change in enthalpy 
leading to enthalpy/entropy (H/S) compensation. This effect has been illustrated by 
the example thermodynamic properties of the solvation process thermodynamic prop-
erties of the amino acids [49]. Solvation theory simulations of amino acids surrounded 
by water molecules were performed to calculate thermodynamic properties of the 
solvation process of these amino acids on a grid around the solute. The results for the 
free energy, the total enthalpy, and the overall entropy for the three different water 
models TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP5P were tabulated (Table 8.1).The results showed that: 
(1) The free energy directly correlates with the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the 
given molecule; (2) For hydrophobic amino acids the thermodynamic values change 
in the following ranges: ΔΔF = 9 kcal mol–1, ΔΔH = 13 kcal mol–1, Δ(−TΔS) = 8 
kcal K−1 mol−1, and Δ(−TΔS)/ΔΔH = 0.61; (3) For hydrophilic amino acids these 
values are ΔΔF = 9 kcal mol–1, ΔΔH = 13 kcal mol–1, Δ(−TΔS) = 6 kcal K−1mol−1, 
and Δ(−TΔS)/ΔΔH = 6/13 = 0.45. Thus, in both series, the enthalpic factor of the

inﬂuence of the structure prevails over the entropy factor and, to a greater extent, for 
charged amino acids.
A formalism for treating the solvent reorganization that accompanies chemical 
reactions and physical processes in liquid solutions was developed [31]. Suggested 
equations were separated into a conventional chemical equation and an environmental 
equation. It was shown that ΔHenv and ΔSenv can be substantial, especially when the 
solvation involves hydrogen bonding. Therefore, environmental ΔHenv and ΔSenv can 
be part of, ΔH° and ΔS° for the overall process. When ΔHenv ≫ΔG°, the plot of ΔH° 
versus ΔS° is nearly a straight line, with a slope close to the experimental tempera-
ture. Data on compensation phenomena between the enthalpy and entropy changes 
of the reduction reaction for all classes of electron transport metalloproteins, namely 
cytochromes, iron-sulfur, and blue copper proteins were presented and discussed 
[52]. Following Grunwald’s approach for the interpretation of H/S compensation 
for solution reactions, it was concluded that reduction-induced solvent reorganiza-
tion effects involving the hydration shell of the molecule dominate the reduction 
thermodynamics. 
A combined terahertz and femtosecond infrared spectroscopic study of water 
dynamics around different ions (speciﬁcally magnesium, lithium, sodium, and 
cesium cations, as well as sulfate, chloride, iodide, and perchlorate anions) reveals 
that the effect of ions and counterions on water can be strongly interdependent and 
nonadditive, and in certain cases extends well beyond the ﬁrst solvation shell of water 
molecules directly surrounding the ion [8]. To know how changes in the organiza-
tion of water within a binding pocket can alter the thermodynamics of protein-ligand 
association, mutants of human carbonic anhydrase (HCAII) were examined [53]. The

association of a protein and ligand in buffered aqueous solution can be considered as 
the sum of nine processes [53]. Five of them are: (1) The formation of protein–ligand 
contacts; (2) The rearrangement of water initially solvating the protein; (3) The rear-
rangement of water initially solvating the ligand; (4) The formation of a hydration 
structure around the protein–ligand complex; and (5) Changes in interactions associ-
ated with buffer ions can be accompanied by the reorganization of a large number of 
water molecules and therefore can show signiﬁcant compensation. For the other four 
processes, one should not expect a wide range of compensatory effects: (1) Changes 
in the conformation of the protein); (2) Changes in the conformation of the ligand; 
(3) changes in the dynamics of the protein; and (4) Changes in the dynamics of the 
ligand. In addition, the inﬂuence of differences in ligand structure—properties of 
human carbonic anhydrase were examined. The ligands 1,3-thiazole-2-sulfonamide 
(TA) and benzo[d]thiazole-2-sulfonamide (BTA) differed by a benzene ring but not 
in binding geometry, revealed the thermodynamic contribution of the benzene ring 
to binding (Fig. 8.7).

and theoretical analyses suggested that most mutations strengthen networks of water-
mediated hydrogen bonds. In addition, reduce binding afﬁnity by increasing the 
enthalpic cost and, to a lesser extent, the entropic beneﬁt of rearranging those 
networks during binding took place. 
In work [55], experimental evidence of enthalpy/entropy (H/S) compensation 
was presented in a ﬁgure and discussed in detail in text. The authors concluded that 
within the conﬁnes of the binding pocket of HIV-1 protease is HCAII, binding events 
associated with enthalpically favorable rearrangements of water. HIV-1 protease is 
a (retropepsin), an enzyme involved with peptide bond hydrolysis in retroviruses. 
To show that EEC in HIV-1 protease is inﬂuenced by the molecular conformational 
changes (CCs) of the entire system comprising the solute and by solvent reorgani-
zation, free energy perturbation formalism was used. Perturbation theory comprises 
methods for ﬁnding an approximate solution to a problem, by starting from the exact 
solution of a related, simpler problem. The internal changes of enthalpy and the 
entropy due to CCs upon modifying the interactions compensate each other. Using 
molecular simulations, it was shown that, for solvation of six different HIV-1 protease 
inhibitors, CCs in the solute cause EEC as large as 10–30 kcal mol–1. 
Enthalpy–entropy compensation during the association of two molecules was 
studied by minimizing model systems with molecular mechanics (MM) or quantum 
mechanics (QM) [56]. Translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions to the 
enthalpy and entropy with standard statistical-mechanics methods were considered 
using the rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator approximation. EEC was observed, owing 
to the loss of translational and rotational entropy. Linear relations between TΔS and 
ΔH with slopes of 0.1–1.7 (but ∼ 0.01 for ionic and covalent interactions) were 
observed within homologous series. It was predicted that for a real binding reaction

in water solution, both enthalpy–entropy compensation and anti-compensation can 
be also observed. 
To estimate the contribution from water to the free energy of binding of a series 
of structurally homologous heterocyclic aromatic sulfonamides to human carbonic 
anhydrase (HCA), the WaterMap method (Schrödinger Inc.) was utilized [57]. The 
method allowed to predict the positions, enthalpies, and entropies of the water 
molecules in the binding pockets of the complexes of HCA–T, HCA–BT, HCA–F, 
and HCA–BF, were F, T and BF: 
Thermodynamic parameters calculated by WaterMap for benzo-extension were 
consistent with those determined experimentally by isothermal titration calorime-
ters (ITC) and the calculation indicated that the gain in binding free energy comes 
from enthalpic stabilization. Average values for converting F to BF and T to BT 
were ΔΔG°WM;benzo = −2.8 kcal mol−1, ΔΔHWM;benzo = −3.0 kcal mol−1, and − 
TΔΔSWM;benzo = 0.2 kcal mol−1. 
EEC from a new standpoint was reviewed [50]. The authors came to conclusion 
that large ﬂuctuations in enthalpy and entropy observed are too great to be a result 
of only conformational changes and must result, to a considerable degree, from 
variations in the amounts of water immobilized or released on forming complexes. 
A structural link between the amount of bound water and the protein ﬂexibility and 
substantial changes in solvation-an intrinsically compensatory process was assumed. 
Experimental, theoretical, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that 
changes in water properties can be observed at distances of more than 10 Å from a 
biomolecule [50]. The authors concentrated on the effect of protein chain ﬂexibility 
and on the properties of hydration water, using short peptides as a model of 18 linear 
peptides with the sequence (XXGG) × 5, where X represents one of the common 
amino acids, other than glycine and proline were constructed. It was demonstrated: 
(1) How restricting the chain ﬂexibility can affect the structural, dynamic, and ther-
modynamic properties of hydration water; (2) How restricting the peptide dynamics 
can slow down the translational motions of water molecules to a distance of at least 
12–13 Å; and (3) How analysis of the “slow” water molecules (residence time ≥ 100 
ps) together with a thermodynamic analysis of water within 4.5 Å of the peptide can 
be performed. 
In the study [61], the crystal structures and thermodynamics were compared for 
the binding of inhibitors APV, atazanavir (ATV), DRV, indinavir (IDV), nelﬁnavir 
(NFV), and saquinavir (SQV) to the wild-type (WT) HIV-1 protease and two multi-
drug-resistant (MDR) variants (Fig. 8.6). A variant (Flap+) has a combination of ﬂap 
and active site mutations and exhibits extremely large entropy–enthalpy compensa-
tion compared to wild-type protease, 5–15 kcal mol–1, while losing only 1–3 kcal 
mol–1 in total binding free energy for any of six FDA approved inhibitors.

Enthalpy–Entropy Relationships in Enzyme Reactions
Detailed thermodynamic studies of the binding of structurally similar ligands, 
which differed with respect to the “cap,” “linker,” and “metal-binding” regions of 
the suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) pharmacophore 
to human histone deacetylase HDAC8, were carried out (Fig. 8.7) [59]. The 
presented experimental data led to the following conclusions: (1) The enthalpic 
(ΔH°) and entropic (TΔS°) contributions for the binding of the different SAHA 
analogues with varying “cap”, “linker”, and “metal-binding” regions to HDAC8 
are markedly different; (2) Their standard free energy changes (ΔG°) are identical 
among hydroxamate-containing ligands; (3) The enthalpy−entropy compensation 
effect accounts for the changes in the temperature dependence in the parameters of 
binding of SAHA analogues to HDAC8; (4) Within the given series of analogues 
the enthalpic (ΔH°) changes from 10.95 kcal mol−1 to 2.72 kcal mol−1, while the 
entropic (TΔS°) changes from − 2.52 to 5.3 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 8.8); and (5) The main 
contribution to these parameters is made by the process of reorganization of weakly 
bound water.
Ligands of human carbonic anhydrase (HCA) and a series of benzothiazole sulfon-
amide ligands with different patterns of ﬂuorination were used to deﬁne enthalpy/ 
entropy (H/S) compensation in this system [60]. The data analysis revealed that 
differences in the structure and thermodynamical properties of the waters surrounding 
the bound ligands are an important contributor to the observed H/S compensation. 
Results supported the hypothesis that the molecules of water ﬁlling the active site 
of a protein, and surrounding the ligand, are as important as the contact interactions 
between the protein and the ligand for biomolecules recognition, and in determining 
the thermodynamics of binding. In the study [61] changes were observed in the 
thermodynamics of inhibitors bounding to a drug-resistant variant (Flap+ protease) 
compared to wild-type HIV-1 protease (Fig. 8.8). The co-crystal structures of Flap+ 
protease with four of the inhibitors were determined and compared. Taking into 
account that the change in the enthalpy of one water molecule in the “melting” of 
the water cluster in the process of binding the substrate ΔH0 = 1.4 kcal mol−1, it  
can be concluded that the cluster can include up to 10 water molecules. 
Experimental data on entropy–enthalpy compensation plots with a high corre-
lation coefﬁcient for calcium binding to proteins, protein unfolding, hydrogen 
exchange in cytochrome c, and alkane solvation are indicated in Fig. 8.9 [42]. The 
analysis of the data presented in the ﬁgure led to the following values of the relative 
thermodynamic parameters in the systems indicated in the caption to the ﬁgure.
(A) δTΔS = 35 kcal mol−1, δΔH = 37 kcal mol−1, δTΔS/δΔH = 0.95. 
(B) δTΔS = 2.2 kcal mol−1, δΔH = 2.2 kcal mol−1 δTΔS/δΔH = 1.0. 
(C) δTΔS = 42 kcal mol−1, δΔH = 44 kcal mol−1, δTΔS/δΔH = 1.0. 
(D) δTΔS = 7 kcal mol−1, δΔH = 14 kcal mol−1, δTDS/ δDH = 0.5.

Thus, the data on proteins show an almost complete mutual compensation of the 
enthalpy and entropy factors, while the enthalpy factor prevails in the solvation of 
alkane. 
The results obtained in the work [12] by titrations of human nucleoside phospho-
rylase (PNP) using isothermal calorimetry (indicated)в the following: (1) Binding of 
a structurally rigid ﬁrst-generation Immucillin (Kd = 56 pM) is driven by large nega-
tive enthalpy values (ΔH = −21.2 kcal mol−1) with a substantial entropic (−TΔS) 
penalty; (2) Flexible inhibitors bind with high afﬁnity because of reduced entropic 
penalties; (3) Entropic penalties arise from conformational freezing of the PNP·in-
hibitor complex with the entropy term dominated by protein dynamics (Fig. 8.10); 
(4) The conformationally ﬂexible Immucillins reduce the system entropic penalty; 
(5) Disrupting the ribosyl 5′-hydroxyl interaction of transition state analogues with 
PNP causes favorable entropy of binding; (6) Tight binding of the 17 Immucillins

is characterized by large enthalpic contributions; and emphasizing their similarity to 
the transition state; and (7) Via introduction of ﬂexibility into the inhibitor structure, 
the enthalpy−entropy compensation pattern is altered to permit tighter binding.
Thermolysin is metalloproteinase catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds 
containing hydrophobic amino acids. The enzyme was used to determine how water 
near the surface of a protein–ligand complex contributes to the thermodynamics 
of binding, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry [62]. In this study, the 
binding modes of nine congeneric phosphonamidate-type inhibitors with systemat-
ically varied, size-increasing hydrophobic substituents were analyzed on the base 
of high-resolution crystal structures data proﬁles. Overall, ΔΔG spreads over 7.0 kJ 
mol, ΔΔH varies by 15.8 kJ mol−1, and −TΔΔS by 12.1 kJ mol−1 with TΔΔS/ΔΔH 
= 0.77. Thus, in this series the enthalpy component somewhat prevails over the 
corresponding entropy component. In addition, ligands that stabilized networks of 
water on the surface of the protein–ligand complex had more favorable enthalpies of 
binding, and less favorable entropies of binding, than ligands that destabilized those

networks The following examples of enthalpy/entropy compensation resulting from 
the entropic cost of enthalpically favorable contacts were described and analyzed 
[53]: (1) Two inhibitors of HIV-1 protease that differ by a sulfonyl group and, thus, 
in their ability to form a sulfonyl–amide bond with the protein backbone; (2) A 
comparison of B-factors between the two protein–ligand complexes shows that the 
additional hydrogen bond rigidiﬁes the protein–ligand complex; (3) Peptide mimics 
with different cycloalkyl moieties; (4) The ligands bind trypsin with similar free 
energies (Gzb) but large differences in enthalpy and entropy of binding (H zb and 
− TSzb, respectively); (5) Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that favorable 
entropies correspond to ligands that are more “mobile” in the binding pocket; (6) 
A zinc ﬁnger peptide on which pairs of charged residues at positions 3 and 10; 
(7) Enthalpies and entropies of interaction between charged residues (H zb and − 
TSzb, respectively; each calculated from thermodynamic cycles of cation binding to 
incrementally varied pairs of residues) suggest strong compensation; free energies 
of interaction (Gzb) vary little between pairs. Computational analysis of the most 
enthalpically stable pair indicated that it is also the most rigid. Abbreviations: B, 
B-factor; G, Gibbs free energy; H, enthalpy; TS, entropic component of free energy. 
To show that EEC in HIV-1 protease is inﬂuenced by the molecular conformational 
changes (CCs) of the entire system comprising the solute and solvent reorganization, 
free energy perturbation formalism was used [55]. The internal changes of enthalpy 
and the entropy due to CCs upon modifying the interactions cancel each other. Using 
molecular simulations, it was shown that, for solvation of six different HIV-1 protease 
inhibitors, CCs in the solute cause EEC as large as 10–30 kcal mol–1.

Enthalpy–Entropy Relationships in Enzyme Reactions

(ΔGb, green bars and black curve) measured experimentally by ITC for a series of ligands targeting 
HMG-CoA reductase. Despite the large variations observed in both enthalpic and entropic terms, 
the binding afﬁnity remains nearly constant across the whole data set due to H/S compensation. 
b Plot of enthalpy (ΔHb) versus entropy (TΔSb) terms showing the linear relationship between 
them [64]. Published by American Chemical Society 
Mini-review [64] provided a short survey of the enthalpy–entropy compensa-
tion phenomenon in the simulation of biomacromolecular recognition from the 
point of view of practical computational chemistry. Ligand binding found partic-
ular emphasis. A series of examples to illustrate different approaches to interpret 
and predict compensation phenomena at an atomistic level was presented. A typical 
example of ligands binding enthalpy, entropy, and free energy for a series of ligands 
targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, (HMG-CoA reduc-
tase) is shown in Fig. 8.11. It follows from the ﬁgure that in this series there are 
almost equal enthalpy and entropy contributions, and the main contribution is made 
by the process of reorganization of the water ensemble. 
EEC from a new standpoint was reviewed [29]. Assuming EEC to be a physical 
correlation a linear relationship between entropy S and enthalpy H, an equation H + 
a*S + b, was proposed with the slope a = T comp being the compensation temperature 
and the intercept b as an energy-related quantity. For example, the DNA ligands DAP 
(2,7-diazapyrene), MDAP (N-methyl-2,7-diazapyrene monocation), and DMDAP 
(N,N-dimethyl-2,7-diazapyrene dication) upon binding to DNA showed the ﬁtting 
line H + a*S + b and plot of ¢H versus −T¢S (with T = 298 K). Speciﬁcally, 
for the diazapyrene homological row T comp = 282 K and b = −6.78 kcal mol−1, 
and for the piperazinylcarbonyloxyalkyl ligands, T comp = 361 K and b = −7.63 
kcal mol−1. The authors stressed that changes of structured water at hydrophobic 
surfaces, conformational transitions upon ligand-biopolymer binding, and so forth 
can underlie physically valid EEC. 
Analysis of the experimental binding thermodynamics for approximately 100 
protein−ligand complexes provided insights into the factors governing ligand afﬁnity

[65]. These data indicated correlation between enthalpy and −TΔS observed for this 
diverse data set (Fig. 8.12). Nevertheless, the interaction enthalpies in the ﬁgure 
show no correlation with free energy. The trends observed for ligand efﬁciencies 
with respect to molecular size are a consequence of enthalpic, not entropic, effects. 
The interaction of pairs of oppositely charged residues on zinc ﬁnger peptides by 
measuring the binding of cations to those pairs was studied using isothermal titration 
calorimetry (ITC) [66]. For example, analysis of the binding of Cu2+ to Ser3Ser10, 
Ser3Asp10, Lys3Ser10, and Lys3Asp10 was used to study the binding of Lys3 and 
Asp10 to one another. ITC measurements revealed a range of over 3 kcal mol−1 
in relative binding enthalpies. Double mutant cycle analysis indicated a range of 
interaction enthalpies ranging from − 3.1 to − 3.4 kcal mol−1 for the Arg-Asp 
pair to − 0.8 kcal mol−1 for the Lys-Glu pair. The magnitudes of the entropy– 
enthalpy compensation effects were consistent with the formation of a structurally 
rigid Arg-Asp contact ion pair.

Artiﬁcial and Nanoenzymes 
Abstract Artiﬁcial enzymes are a class of catalysts being potentially viable alter-
natives to natural enzymes. Enzyme mimics can have the important advantages 
including tunable structures and catalytic efﬁciencies, stability in experimental 
conditions, lower cost, and simple synthetic routes to their preparation. Cyclodex-
trins, metal complexes, porphyrins, polymers, dendrimers, membranes, nanoparti-
cles, organic and metalorganic compounds and biomolecules can serve as the basis 
for an artiﬁcial catalyst. On the path of mimicry, seven stages have been formu-
lated. Typical examples of enzyme mimetic catalysts, performance, the reactions they 
catalyze, and the main source of their catalytic efﬁciency were considered. Catalyt-
ically active nanomaterials (nanozymes) also show several advantages over natural 
enzymes. A wide range of materials are used as nanoenzymes, such as nanoparticles 
of Fe3O4, Prussian blue, Mn3O4, CeO2, WO2, NiCo2O4@MnO2, graphene oxide, 
graphene-hemin nanocomposites, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanodots, mesoporous 
silica-encapsulated gold nanoparticles, gold nanoclusters, Pep–Au-NP = peptide– 
gold nanoparticle conjugate gold nanoparticles, ferrous ferrocyanide, nonheme iron, 
vanadium, and copper complexes bearing hemicryptophane. Metal atom (M = K, 
Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh) doping on a Mo6S8 cluster and mononuclear rhodium 
species anchored on a zeolite or titanium dioxide illustrate single-atom catalysis. 
Nanozymes can exhibit activity of oxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, DNAse, 
alkaline phosphatase phospholipase, topoisomerase and can display antioxidant and 
bioﬁlm activity. Molecular imprinting is a technique to create template (analogs of 
substrates, transition states, or products) shaped cavities in polymer matrices with 
predetermined selectivity and high afﬁnity in a speciﬁc function. Schemes of the prin-
ciple of molecular imprinting recognition, a molecularly imprinted catalyst scheme 
for selective catalysis, and, as an illustration, imprinted catalytic system based on 
methacrylic layer polymerization were presented. Despite the obvious advantages of 
artiﬁcial enzymes, it is still not possible to achieve the activity of natural catalysts.

Introduction 
Natural enzymes, mediating every biological process in living organisms, are able to 
accelerate the rate of chemical reactions up to 1019 times for speciﬁc substrates and 
reactions. It is widely accepted that enzymes accelerate reactions through their steric 
and electronic complementarity to the reactants in the rate-determining transition 
states and conformational dynamics. The conformational diversities and complexities 
of natural enzymes exert in catalysis seriously restrict the detailed understanding of 
enzymatic mechanisms in molecular terms. The practical application of enzymes 
is often hampered by low operational stability, sensitivity of catalytic activity to 
environmental conditions, high costs in preparation and puriﬁcation, etc. 
Enzyme mimics or artiﬁcial enzymes are a class of catalysts that have heralded 
much interest as potentially viable alternatives to natural enzymes. Aside from having 
catalytic activities similar to their natural counterparts, enzyme mimics can have the 
desired advantages including tunable structures and catalytic efﬁciencies, stability 
in experimental conditions, lower cost, and simple synthetic routes to their prepara-
tion [1–27]. Enzyme mimics have exhibited high potential in the catalysis of a wide 
range of chemical and biological reactions and the development of chemical and 
biological sensing and anti-biofouling systems, the production of pharmaceuticals, 
clean fuels, and stable and low-cost alternatives to natural enzymes in a wide range 
of applications. A variety of materials including cyclodextrins, metal complexes, 
porphyrins, polymers, dendrimers, membranes, nanoparticles, and biomolecules 
have been designed and developed. Nevertheless, though synthetic catalysts offer an 
opportunity for more chemical versatility operating over a wider range of conditions 
currently, they do not reach the remarkable performance of natural enzymes. 
The terms “mimicking enzymatic processes” or “chemical models of enzymes” or 
“artiﬁcial enzymes” have no monosemantic and exact deﬁnitions. This could mean 
the chemical model of the corresponding chemical reaction or the construction of 
chemical structures similar to an enzyme active site, or both. In the mimicking of 
an enzymatic process, there is no need to copy the structure of protein and coen-
zyme groups and all stages of this process. In the course of evolution, nature created 
enzymes in speciﬁc conditions, in certain media and utilized certain “building mate-
rials.” Besides chemical functions, enzymes in a cell bear many other obligations, 
serving as units of complicated enzymatic and membrane ensembles. At present, 
on the bases of common features present in enzymes that derive from the study 
of natural enzymes, the following general steps of mimicking enzymatic processes 
may be formulated [6, 7]: (1) Previous detailed analysis of existing data on the struc-
ture and action mechanism of an enzyme on interest; (2) choose of basic (primary) 
catalytic groups directly involved in the catalytic process; (3) selection of secondary 
groups, which can regulate the reactivity of the attacking groups; (4) optimal dispo-
sition of primary and secondary catalytic groups on a matrix; (5) including in the 
catalytic system additional residues, which can form portions capable of bounding 
and precisely orienting the substrate molecule; (6) a matrix, carrying the model

catalysis active site, should be dynamics, providing condition for dynamic adapta-
tion (Chap. 4); (7) a pretransition state complex that activates cleavage or formation 
of chemical bonds should have to include optimal number nucleous moving to the 
transition state (the “principle of optimum motion” (Chap. 4).

9.2.1 
Modeling Enzymes Active Centers Structure 
and Activity 
Artiﬁcial catalysts can be based on natural molecules, such as cyclodextrins, catalytic 
antibodies, synthetic complex systems, functional macrocycles, imprinted polymers, 
dendrimers, and complex nanosystems, such as micellar and vesicular aggregates or 
nanoparticles [8, 9]. To give an idea of their typical performance and the source 
of catalysis as enzyme mimics, selected examples and kinetic results obtained with 
these catalysts are demonstrated in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2 and Table 9.1. Each system 
reported in Table 9.1 is based on a speciﬁc feature pertaining to enzyme catalysis.
Synthetic catalysts (Fig. 9.2) offer an opportunity for more chemical versatility 
operating over a wider range of conditions but currently do not reach the remarkable 
performance of natural enzymes [8]. With a focus on the enzyme as a whole catalytic 
construct, the translational impact of natural enzyme principles to synthetic enzymes, 
supramolecular capsules, and electrocatalytic surfaces was put forward. 
Examples of chemical modeling of enzymes of particular interest such as nitro-
genase, nitric oxide synthase, cytochrome P459, methane monooxydase, hydro-
lases, photosynthetic reaction centers, water oxidation complex, etc. are given in 
the following chapters. 
9.2.2 
Nanoenzymes 
Nanozymes are catalytic nanomaterials with enzyme-like characteristics [14–47]. 
Recently, the merging of nanotechnology with biology has ignited extensive research 
efforts for designing functional nanomaterials that exhibit various properties intrinsic 
to enzymes. As a promising candidate for artiﬁcial enzymes, catalytically active 
nanomaterials (nanozymes) show several advantages over natural enzymes, such as 
controlled synthesis in low cost, tunability in catalytic activities, as well as high 
stability against stringent conditions. Nevertheless, nanozymes as artiﬁcial catalysts, 
having many advantages, still face many challenges (Fig. 9.3).
A comprehensive review [38] summarized and analyzed the progress, especially 
the achievements from more than 1100 research papers, published by 2019. The 
review covered all principle aspects in the area: development of nanotechnology,

activities with high-performance nanomaterials, regulating the nanozyme activi-
ties, elucidating the catalytic mechanisms, and broadening potential applications 
(Fig. 9.4). Separate sections of the review are devoted to the following important 
subjects: (1) Iron, vanadium, noble metal, metal–organic framework (MOF), and 
other nanomaterial based on peroxidase mimics; (2) gold, cupper, molybdenum, and 
platinum compounds-based oxidase mimics; (3) catalase mimics and superoxide 
dismutase mimics; and (4) hydrolase mimics. Other relevant topics covered in the 
review are: multi-enzyme-mimicking nanozymes, multi-functional nanozymes, and 
engineering nanozyme activity.
In review [14], with the expanded types of nanozymes and engineered high 
performance, applications have been accomplished and discussed as follows: in vitro 
sensing H2O2 detection based on peroxidase mimics, detection of glucose and other 
oxidase substrates, and cancer markers on cell surface detection. For this purpose, 
magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and optical techniques, beneﬁting from 
the intrinsic properties (e.g., magnetism of Fe, X-ray absorption ability of Ir, and 
optics of Au) were utilized. Hundreds of nanomaterials have been investigated 
to mimic the catalytic activity of peroxidase, oxidase, catalase, haloperoxidase, 
glutathione peroxidase, uricase, methane monooxygenase, hydrolase, and super-
oxide dismutase [17]. For example, nanoparticles Fe3O4 NPs showed pH-dependent 
peroxidase-like and catalase-like activities. Prussian blue nanoparticles (NPs)

activity. Mn3O4 NPs can also mimic all three cellular antioxidant enzymes including 
superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Targeting antibody-
conjugated ferromagnetic nanozymes simultaneously provides three functions: target 
capture, magnetic separation, and nanozyme color development for target detection. 
Account [15] focused on progress in exploring and constructing artiﬁcial enzymes, 
including graphene oxide, graphene-hemin nanocomposites, carbon nanotubes, 
carbon nanodots, mesoporous silica-encapsulated gold nanoparticles, gold nanoclus-
ters, and nanoceria. The biomimetic catalysts can serve as colorimetric probes for 
the detection of cancer cells, nucleic acids, proteins, metal ions, and other small 
molecules. For example, graphene oxide could be a modulator to greatly improve 
the catalytic activity of lysozyme-stabilized gold nanoclusters at neutral pH.

Artiﬁcial and Nanoenzymes
Nano enzymes have been widely used in therapeutic ﬁelds including neuropro-
tection, cytoprotection, environmental protection, inﬂammatory, bacterial infection, 
cancer therapy, and biofouling [39] and references therein. Nanozymes used to 
construct logic gates were also reported. For example, label-free, resettable, colori-
metric logic gates were developed. Research progress in reactive oxygen species 
ROS-Mediated Therapeutic Applications of Composite Nanozymes was summa-
rized in [42]. For example, nanomaterials mimic natural enzymes in action, display 
pro- or antioxidative catalytic activity, and also mimick hydrolase-like activity. Nano-
materials exhibiting DNAse and phospholipase activity, caused hydrolytic cleavage 
of extracellular DNA (eDNA) and phospholipids, respectively, and displayed 
antibioﬁlm activity. 
A review [12] aimed to summarize the recent progress on nanoparticles in catal-
ysis and provided potential theoretical guidance for the rational design of high-
performance catalysts. The following results were reported and discussed: (1) A brief 
summary of the synthetic strategies and characterization methods of nanoclusters 
NCs; (2) discussion of the model catalyst role of NCs in catalysis as illustrated from 
electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, photoelectric conversion, and catalysis of organic 
reactions; and (3) examination of the main challenges and opportunities for a deep 
understanding of the key catalytic steps. In addition, some new design strategies 
based on the contributions of nonlocal electric ﬁelds and thermodynamic ﬂuctua-
tions to improve the catalytic step and turnover for rate acceleration in arbitrary 
synthetic catalysts were put forward [8]. 
A variety of nanomaterials has been studied as artiﬁcial enzyme mimics, including 
CeO2 NPs, Fe3O4 NPs, Pt nanomaterials, Au NPs, bimetal and trimetal NPs, 
graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, fullerene derivates, quantum dots, metal organic 
frameworks (MOFs) as some common examples (Fig. 9.5) [37].
Inspired by natural peroxidases [40], ferromagnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) were  
modiﬁed with histidine to form a similar microenvironment to natural hydrolases. 
It was found that such modiﬁcation improved the afﬁnity toward H2O2 by at least 
tenfold, as a hydrogen bond would form between the side-chain imidazole group 
of histidine and H2O2. A peroxidase mimic composed of iridium (Ir) nanoparticles 
with an average size of only 1.1 nm that are coupled to a tungsten suboxide (WO2) 
nanorod as support was prepared [48]. Such a peroxidase mimic exhibited an area-
speciﬁc catalytic efﬁciency as high as 1.5 × 104 s−1 nm−2. The peroxidase mimic 
was applied to colorimetric immunoassays of carcinoembryonic antigen (a cancer 
biomarker) and aﬂatoxin B1

(a potent carcinogen), which provided substantially enhanced detection sensitivities 
compared to conventional enzyme-based assays. 
Heme-based catalase enzymes and structurally related catalase mimics destroy 
H2O2 by a mechanism involving oxoferryl intermediates [47]. A large number of 
nanomaterials, including CeO2, Fe3O4, Fe-doped carbon and carbon nitride, gold 
nanoparticles, and MOFs demonstrated their ability to catalyze H2O2 disproportion-
ation. Composite nanozymes designed recently showed both intrinsic peroxidase-
and oxidase-like activity to generate ROS ·OH, ·O2−, and H2O2, which can vividly 
damage more lipids, amino acids, and polysaccharides in the bacterial membrane 
and also kill cancerous cells due to their oxidative and electrophilic nature [46]. The 
scavenging reactions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like H2O2 and O2 bound by 
{111} planes on two facets of the nanooctahedra (Fig. 9.6) were examined [49]. 
Speciﬁcally, the reaction energy (Er) of the rate-determining step was calculated and 
more negative Er evidenced higher activity. As shown in Fig. 9.6, the scavenging 
abilities of H2O2 and O2 on the {111} facet (Er equaled 2.81 and 0.60 eV, respec-
tively) were stronger than those on the {100} facet (Er equaled 2.64 and 0.13 eV, 
respectively).
NiCo2O4@MnO2 microcubes were synthesized to form numerous nanoscale p–n 
junctions between p-type NiCo2O4 and n-type MnO2 [50]. The resulting nanozyme 
exhibits both oxidase- and peroxidase-like activities:

where AH denotes substrates. The nanoenzyme efﬁciency can be enhanced under 
illumination (Fig. 9.7). Chromogenic substrate, 3,3′,5,5 tetramethylbenzidine dihy-
drochloride (TMB) was utilized in the investigation of the photoenhanced oxidase– 
peroxidase-like activity of NiCo2O4@ MnO2 microcubes: The calculated Km, V max, 
and Kcat of NiCo2O4@MnO2 were found to be 2.31 × 10−3 M−1, 1.27  × 10−6 M s−1, 
and 5.40 × 108 s−1. When NiCo2O4@MnO2 receives light irradiation, the photoen-
hanced oxidase–peroxidase-like activity occurs. The band gap of NiCo2O4 and MnO2 
are 1.77 and 2.2 eV, respectively. In addition, the p–n junction interface transports hot 
electrons from NiCo2O4 to MnO2 and restrains the recombination of photogenerated 
electrons and holes.
Inspired by enzymatic cases, it was suggested that thermal motion can play a 
crucial role in inﬂuencing the reaction mechanism and determining the energetic 
stability of CO binding in heterogeneous catalysis of the electrochemical CO2 
reduction reaction (CO2RR) [8]. In this case, a DFT functional gave a look at the 
CO binding motifs on the weak binding metal surfaces, which was found to be 
a mixture of chemisorbed and physisorbed species (Fig. 9.8). The importance of 
thermal ﬂuctuations in a number of catalytic systems was stressed.

were designed [51]. The three nonﬂuorescent substrates BA, TH, and HPPA were 
oxidized with the OH radicals decomposed from H2O2 under the catalysis of Na10[α-
SiW9O34]. Detection limits for BA, TH, and HPPA were found to be 6.7 × 10−9, 2.2  
× 10−7 and 9.6 × 10−6 M, respectively. 
Work [52] focused on a combination of metal–organic framework (MOF)-based 
nanozymes and a G-quadruplex (G4)-based catalytic system (G4-DNAzyme). On 
this pathway, MIL-53(Fe) MOF was linked covalently to a G4-forming sequence 
(F3TC), itself covalently linked to its cofactor hemin. These properties were exploited 
to devise a new biosensing system based on a cascade of reactions catalyzed by 
the nanozyme (ABTS oxidation) and an enzyme, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
catalyzed ascorbic acid 2-phosphate 
dephosphorylation. In addition, a biosensor for ALP (a marker of bone diseases and 
cancers), with a very low limit of detection (LOD, 0.02 U L−1), which is operative 
in human plasma samples, was designed. 
Prussian blue (PB) ferrous ferrocyanide nanoparticles were prepared by using mild 
synthetic conditions in a cellulose-based hydrogel network in the presence of glucose 
oxidase (GOx). This protocol resulted in the simultaneous immobilization of PB NPs 
and active GOx in the hydrogel [53]. This system displayed peroxidase-like activity 
relative to the PB NPs and revealed an enhanced cascade catalytic performance for the 
colorimetric detection of glucose in human serum samples. Compared to the analog 
mixture with GOx in solution, the composite hydrogel enhanced glucose detection 
and improved stability. Prussian Blue chitosan enzyme mimetic tubular micromo-
tors were utilized for on-the-ﬂy (bio)-sensing assays [54]. PB micromotors display 
enzyme mimetic capabilities with key functions: (1) The autonomous oxygen bubble

propulsion with PB acting as a catalase mimic for hydrogen peroxide decomposition; 
(2) 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) 
oxidation with PB acting as a peroxidase mimic for analyte detection; and (3) as a 
magnetic material to simplify the (bio)-sensing steps. After functionalization with 
acetylthiocholinesterase enzyme (ATChE), the micromotor was explored in fast inhi-
bition assays for the colorimetric determination of the nerve agent neostigmine, with 
analytical performance in terms of quantiﬁcation limit (0.30 μM) and concentration 
linear range (up to 500 μM). 
It was reported that cysteine-derived chiral carbon dots (CDs) 
can mimic topoisomerase to mediate topological rearrangement of supercoiled DNA 
enantioselectively [55]. Experiments suggested the underlying mechanism, namely: 
(1) d-CDs intercalatively bind with DNA double helix more strongly than l-CDs; 
(2) the intercalative CDs can catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals to cleave 
phosphate backbone in one strand of the double helix; and (3) this leads to topological 
rearrangement of supercoiled DNA. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation 
indicated that the afﬁnity for hydrogen-bond formation and hydrophobic interaction 
between d-cysteine and DNA is stronger than that of l-cysteine.

were conjugated to a His-Phe dipeptide 1 with an N-terminal undecanethiol and 
an unmodiﬁed C-terminus. Degradation of organophosphorus nerve agents is of 
primary importance for the severe toxicity of these compounds. Gold nanoparticles 
passivated with thiolated molecules, bearing 1,3,7-triazacyclononane and 1,3,7,10-
tetraazacyclododecane 
ligands and hydrolyzing nerve agents simulants p-nitrophenyl diphenyl phosphate 
and methylparaoxon, were prepared and examined [57]. The analysis was performed 
at 25 °C and pH 8 with half-lives of the order of a few minutes. The catalytic site 
appeared to involve a single-metal ion and its recognition of the substrates can be 
driven mostly by hydrophobic interactions. 
Review [58] summarized progress made over the past 15 years in the ﬁeld of 
catalytically active Au-NPs Pep–Au-NP = peptide–gold nanoparticle conjugate 
(Figs. 9.9 and 9.10). The choice of natural or unnatural amino acids allowed for 
the ﬁne-tuning of reactivity and speciﬁcity of the ligand shell. The review covered 
the following topics: (1) The origin of distinct properties evoked by the conjugation of 
peptides to the Au-NPs and their similarities to natural enzymes; (2) the conﬁnement 
of tailored peptides onto the surface of Au-NPs created dense peptide monolayers, 
in which novel hydrogen-bond networks and charge-relay interactions between indi-
vidual functional groups appear; (3) carboxylate-imidazole-mediated ester hydrol-
ysis showed Au@E1H8 functions as an efﬁcient esterase mimic, based on a centrally 
located His functioning as the catalytic moiety; (4) a dipeptide can be replaced with 
rationally designed peptide consisting of 12 amino acids (Fig. 9.9); after immobiliza-
tion onto the gold surface, His is buried inside the resulting monolayer analogous to 
the active sites of natural enzymes; (6) Lys and Arg were incorporated to stabilize the 
negatively charged transition state of ester hydrolysis, to enable (together with His) 
nucleophilic and/or general acid/base catalysis; and (7) the individual Pep–Au-NPs 
were stabilized due to electrostatic repulsion.
Thus, Pep–Au-NPs are able to generate improved substrate and transition state 
interactions, and the associated rate enhancements. Main advantages of catalytically 
active Pep–Au-NPs were illustrated in Fig. 9.10 [58]. Nevertheless, these systems 
still do not enable the high levels of catalytic efﬁciency achieved by natural enzymes.

hydrolyzed of the 2-hydroxypropyl-4-nitrophenylphosphate (HPNP), a typical RNA 
model substrate [5]. The structure and dynamics of the outer coating monolayer of 
these nanoparticles, either alone or in complex with HPNP, were examined using 
microsecond-long atomistic simulations and NMR experiments.
Establishing whether a reaction is catalyzed by a single-metal catalytic center or 
cooperatively by a ﬂeeting complex encompassing two such centers was a subject 
of the work [59]. Possibility of single-copper versus dicopper mechanisms of the 
“click” reaction was discussed [59]. “Click” chemistry is a class of biocompatible 
small molecule reactions commonly used in bioconjugation, allowing the joining 
of substrates of choice with speciﬁc biomolecules. The suggested method relied on 
geometrical considerations that can distinguish between cooperative and noncooper-
ative mechanisms. The latter can be realized in a nanoparticle-based platform. In view 
of the potential practical signiﬁcance of the oxidation of methane by atmospheric 
oxygen under relatively mild conditions, special attention was drawn to the corre-
sponding catalysts’ [60–68]. A strategy for the electrocatalysis of selective methane 
oxidation by immobilizing tricopper catalysts on the cathodic surface was developed 
(Fig. 9.12) [60]. In the presence of dioxygen and methane, above a threshold cathodic 
potential, oxygen atom transfers to methane. Turnover frequencies > 40 min−1 and > 
30,000 in 12 h were achieved for this chemical transformation in water under ambient 
conditions. This technology is suitable for on-site direct conversion of methane into 
methanol.
In account [61], progress on thermal methane activation by metal oxide clusters 
doped with noble-metal atoms (Au, Pt, and Rh) as well as by oxygen-free species 
including carbides and borides of base metals (V, Ta, Mo, and Fe) was summarized. 
The generations of stable products such as formaldehyde, acetylene, and syngas (a 
mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in various ratios) as well as closed-shell 
species AuCH3 and B3CH3 have been identiﬁed for the cluster reaction systems. 
The new mechanisms of synergistic methane activation by Lewis acid–base pairs 
(such as Auδ+-Oδ− and Bδ+-Bδ−) and by dinuclear metal centers (such as Ta-Ta) 
have been suggested. The following results have been presented and discussed in 
detail: (1) In the reactions between methane and oxide clusters doped with noble-
metal atoms, the oxide cluster “supports” can accept the H atoms and the CHx 
species delivered through the noble-metal atoms; (2) then methane was transformed 
into stable oxygenated compounds; (3) the product selectivity can be controlled by 
different noble-metal atoms (such as Pt versus Rh); (4) the electronic structures of 
base metal centers can be engineered through carburization so that the low-spin states 
can be accessible to reduce the C–H bond of methane; and (5) the boron clusters (such 
as B3 in VB3 +) can be polarized by the metal cations to form the Lewis acid–base 
pair Bδ+-Bδ− to cleave the C–H bond of methane. 
In work [62], the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of single-metal-atom (M = K, Ti, Fe, Co, 
Ni, Cu, Rh) doping on a Mo6S8 cluster (Fig. 9.13) was revealed for the direct methane 
to methanol conversion in water stream using density functional theory calculations. 
The direct CH4 → CH3OH conversion via the steam reforming of methane (SRM) 
and over the single-metal-atom (M = K, Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh) on Mo6S8 clusters 
was explored using DFT. The following ﬁndings have been reported and discussed:

High CH4 oxidation activity of ZnO nanoparticles loaded with Ag nanoparticles 
under simulated sunlight was investigated using surface plasmon resonance, SPR 
[63]. SPR is a phenomenon where the electrons in the metal surface layer are excited 
by photons of incident light with a certain angle of incidence and then propagate 
parallel to the metal surface. The deposited Ag nanoparticles showed SPR, reduced 
recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers with faster surface reac-
tion, and increased visible light absorption. The experiment on atmospheric methane 
oxidation indicated the high quantum yield of 8% at wavelengths < 400 nm and 
over 0.1% at wavelengths ∼ 470 nm was achieved on the silver decorated zinc oxide 
nanostructures. To account for the methane photooxidation, a two-step photocatalytic 
reaction process was suggested. In the ﬁrst step, CH4 reacted with oxygen to produce 
H2O. In the second step, a HCHO (CH4 + O2 →HCHO + H2O), as the intermediate, 
reacted with O2 to produce CO2 and H2O (HCHO + O2 → CO2 + H2O) [63]. By 
means of DFT calculations, the ability of bidimensional (2D) and three-dimensional 
(3D) Cu5 and Cu7 clusters to oxidize partially methane to methanol was explored 
[64]. The calculation indicated that a highly selective Eley–Rideal pathway describes 
the reaction between an adsorbed molecule, AB*, and the gaseous molecule, and 
involves homolytic C–H bond dissociation. The deﬁning characteristic of an Eley– 
Rideal reaction is that one of the reactants is not chemisorbed locally, and hence, not 
in equilibrium with the surface temperature. Appearance of a nonadsorbed radical-
like methyl intermediate was found to be favored when bicoordinated oxygen atoms, 
stabilizing at the edges of 2D clusters, are available. In addition, it was established 
that the reactivity of oxygen atoms adsorbed on copper clusters is closely linked to 
cluster size and morphology. 
Density functional theory calculations were also performed to investigate the 
catalytic cycle of methane conversion to methanol in Cu2(O2)2+ active sites of the 
Cu-ZSM-5 catalyst [65]. The calculation indicated that the oxidation has a higher 
energy barrier in the methane activation step, a very low energy barrier in the 
methanol formation step (36.3 kJ mol−1) and a lower methanol desorption energy 
(52.5 kJ mol−1). The methane activation step was found to follow the homolytic route 
and the heterolytic route for the [Cu2(O2)]2+ and [Cu2(μ-O)]2+ active sites, respec-
tively, whereas the methanol formation step follows the direct radical rebound mech-
anism and the indirect rebound mechanism, respectively. The calculations further 
indicated that: (1) The electronic properties of the reactive O atoms in the active site 
inﬂuence their reactivity toward methane oxidation were evaluated; (2) the higher 
the spin density, the more negative the charge of the reactive O atom at the active 
site is; (3) the lower the energy barrier for methane activation, the more effective the 
catalyst can be; (4) the higher energy barrier of the methanol formation step can be 
in the triplet state; (5) a larger cluster model predicts the mechanism of the methane 
activation step and the effect of atomic charge of the O atom at the [Cu2(μ-O)]2+; (6)  
the larger cluster model are consistent with those drawn using the smaller double-
5T-ring cluster model; and (7) the partial oxidation of methane at [Cu2(O2)]2+ can 
occur via a single step by direct insertion of one of the O atoms at the active site into 
the C–H bond of methane.

The review [67] summarized the main achievements obtained with photocatalyst 
alternatives to TiO2 in the three main niches for this technology: water splitting 
for hydrogen production, decontamination and disinfection processes, and organic 
synthesis. For example, semiconductors based on cations with d0 conﬁguration such 
Ta5+ or Nb5+, and oxides or nitrides of d10 elements such as Bi3+, In3+ or Ga3+ were 
found to be among the most successful novel catalysts [67]. Non-semiconductor 
solids like cation-interchanged zeolites and some semiconductors like ZnO or CdS 
also can produce promising results. The catalyst, having the coarse structure of the 
ZnO islands supported on a Cu2O/Cu(111) substrate and providing a collection of 
catalytic multiple centers, was designed [68]. The catalyst was capable of methane 
activation at room temperature and transforms mixtures of methane and oxygen to 
methanol at 450 K with a selectivity of ∼ 30%. ZnO–Cu2O acted as active centers 
for methanol synthesis when exposed to CH4 and O2 due to an effective O–O bond 
dissociation, enabling a methane-to-methanol conversion. Upon addition of water, the 
defected O-rich ZnO sites, introduced by Zn vacancies, showed enhance the overall 
methanol selectivity to over 80%. Methane over-oxidation by dicopper [Cu2 O]2+ 
and [Cu2 O2]2+ in zeolite mordenite (MOR) was examined sites using DFT [66]. 
The calculation showed that [Cu2 O2]2+ has a very large methane C–H activation 
barrier and stabilization of methanol and methyl at unreacted dicopper sites leads to 
over-oxidation via sequential hydrogen atom abstraction steps. For methanol, near 
200 °C the process was initiated by abstraction of the CH3 group followed by OH. 
The following reaction mechanism was suggested: (1) In the ﬁrst step, methane 
is activated in the presence of O2 on isolated Rh+ cations under mild conditions to 
produce Rh–CH3; (2) the latter can be functionalized via oxygen insertion to produce 
methanol, or CO insertion to produce acetic acid; (3) after the hydrolysis step, isolated 
Rh+1 species are available for the next catalytic cycle; and (4) the zeolite supported 
or the titanium-dioxide-supported catalyst during three-hour-long batch-reactor tests 
conducted at 150 °C, showed yield around 22,000 μmol of acetic acid per gram of 
catalyst, or around 230 μmol of methanol per gram of catalyst, respectively, with 
selectivities of 60–100%. 
ZnO loaded with appropriate cocatalysts (Pt, Pd, Au, or Ag), enabling direct 
oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde in water using only molec-
ular oxygen as the oxidant under mild light irradiation at room temperature, was 
prepared [69]. It was found that: (1) Up to 250 μmol of liquid oxygenates with 
∼ 95% selectivity is achieved for 2 h over 10 mg of ZnO loaded with 0.1 wt% of 
Au; (2) molecular 18O2, rather than 18H2O, is the source of oxygen for direct CH4 
oxidation; and (3) ZnO and cocatalyst could concertedly activate CH4 and O2 into 
methyl radical and hydroperoxyl radical in water. The authors of work [70] under-
lined two equally signiﬁcant aspects for efﬁcient C–H bond activation of CH4 over 
hematite and controllable activation of O2. Hematite, iron oxide compound (Fe2O3) 
was found to be highly effective and thermally stable to catalyze methane combustion 
at temperatures (< 500 °C) with a low light-off temperature of 230 °C, a low apparent 
activation energy of 17.60 kcal mol−1 and 100% selectivity to a ﬁnal product CO2 
[70]. Isotopic oxygen tracer experiments, diffuse reﬂectance infrared spectroscopy, 
Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and DFT calculations were performed.

The research indicated that the performance stems from a tetra-iron center with an 
antiferromagnetically coupled iron dimer on the hematite (110) surface. The results 
supported a Mars van Krevelen redox mechanism. According to this mechanism, 
CH4 is activated by reaction with a hematite surface oxygen ﬁrst, followed by a 
catalytic cycle through a molecular-dioxygen-assisted pathway. The evolution of 
reaction intermediates from a methoxy CH3–O–Fe, to a bridging bidentate formate 
b-HCOO–Fe, to a monodentate formate m-HCOO–Fe was also revealed. 
A review [71] discussed the advancements in the electrocatalytic and photocat-
alytic oxidation of methane at low temperatures with products containing oxygen 
atom(s). The reactions that occurred at the electrodes are given below

CH4 oxidation is thermodynamically favorable at modest potentials (e.g., CH4 (g) 
+ H2O (l)  → CH3OH (aq) + 2H+ + 2e− reaction has E0 = 0.586 V versus normal 
hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH = 0 and 298 K. It was found that a photocatalyst 
must have a conduction band minimum more negative than the potential of the O2/ 
O2− redox couple (−0.16 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE) and a valence band 
maximum more positive than the potential of the ·OH/OH− redox couple (+ 2.59 V 
vs. NHE). 
At high overpotentials (at ≥ 0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), water 
oxidation (oxygen evolution) occurred at high rate [72]. Electrocatalytic CH4 oxida-
tion over multiwalled carbon nanotube Naﬁon/nickel hydroxide-modiﬁed nickel 
electrodes in 1.0 m NaOH solution was examined. A linear relationship between 
the oxidation peak current and the concentration of CH4 was observed [72]. Thus, 
ﬁndings indicated that CH4 was effectively oxidized to methanol by NiOOH electro-
catalyst. A gas diffusion electrode (GDE) for the selective methanol electrosynthesis 
from CH4 on a V2O5 incorporated TiO2/RuO2/polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) elec-
trode was utilized [73]. Formaldehyde and formic acid were synthesized at the similar 
rate. In such oxidation reactions, electrochemically activated oxygen species (O*) 
act as oxidizing agent involving in several steps: (1) Cathodes can reductively acti-
vate O2 molecules to generate O* (O2 + 2H+ + 2e− + Mn+ → O*–Mn+ + H2O), 
where Mn+ is the active site on the cathode, such as Sm3+, Fe3+, and Cu2+; (2)  the  
O* can selectively oxidize light hydrocarbons to the corresponding oxygenates (O* 
+ R–H → R–OH); (3) O* reacts with methane to produce methanol (O* + CH4 → 
CH3OH); and (4) different reactive oxygen species O·− (H2O → O·− + 2H+ + e−) 
and O2·− (2H2O → O2·− + 4H+ + 3e−) were formed electrochemically over V4+ 
sites. 
Mononuclear rhodium species, anchored on a zeolite or titanium dioxide support 
suspended in aqueous solution, can catalyze the direct conversion of methane to 
methanol and acetic acid, using oxygen and carbon monoxide under mild conditions 
[74]. Supported rhodium catalysts were prepared using a heat treatment protocol 
on the zeolite (ZSM-5) supports and by anchoring rhodium precursor species on

reduced titanium dioxide (titania) assisted by ultraviolet irradiation. The tempera-
ture at which the catalytic reaction was initiated was 110 °C in the case of Rh-ZSM-
5. Results suggested that the conversion of methane to oxygenates may occur via 
a reaction pathway, in which methane is activated by formation M–CH3, namely: 
(1) In the ﬁrst step, methane is activated in the presence of O2 on isolated Rh+ 
cations under mild conditions to produce Rh–CH3; (2) the formed Rh–CH3 can then 
be functionalized via two independent reaction pathways, namely oxygen inser-
tion to produce methanol, or CO insertion to produce acetic acid; and (3) after the 
hydrolysis step, isolated Rh+1 species are available for the next catalytic cycle. The 
zeolites supported or the titanium-dioxide-supported catalyst, showing yield around 
22,000 μmol of acetic acid per gram of catalyst, or around 230 μmol of methanol 
per gram of catalyst, respectively, with selectivities of 60–100%, were examined in 
three-hour-long batch-reactor tests150 °C. A batch reactor is a chemical reactor in 
which a noncontinuous reaction is conducted.

ties were evaluated in the oxidation of methane in water by hydrogen peroxide

are a class of organic supramolecular compounds. To evaluate the importance of 
the supramolecular structure to catalytic efﬁciency, six supramolecular complexes, 
including the two novel tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine-
based hemicryptophane complexes CuII(Hm-TPA) and more effective FeII(Hm-
TPA), displaying various ﬁrst and second coordination spheres, were immobilized 
onto silica and examined. Several metal complexes bearing a hemicryptophane cavity 
and analogous complexes devoid of the cage were also prepared. The results obtained 
with the iron-(II)-based catalysts indicated the following: (1) The involvement of 
a high-valence metal-based oxidant occurs in a manner similar to that involved for 
enzymatic systems (MMO); (2) the catalytic performances of “encaged” and “naked” 
catalysts were evaluated by the direct comparison of the selectivity for primary oxida-
tion products (CH3OH and CH3OOH) and the turnover number; and (3) copper 
complexes showed low catalytic efﬁciency; (4) vanadium and iron complexes exhib-
ited higher turnover numbers,≤ 13.2 and ≤ 9.2, respectively, providing target primary 
oxidation products (CH3OH and CH3OOH) as well as over-oxidation products 
(HCHO and HCOOH) (Fig. 9.14). Thus, this study highlighted the relevance of the 
hemicryptophane nanoreactors which can combine the efﬁciency of heterogeneous 
catalysis with the convenient character of homogeneous host–guest systems. 
The review [76] accounted for recent progress in the ﬁeld of single-atom catalysts 
(SACs) for the selective oxidation of CH4 to C1–2 oxygenates. A single-atom cata-
lyst (SAC) is the catalyst with a single atom on its surface. SACs with coordinated 
metal centers on active support have displayed high reactivity and selectivity for 
methane oxidation (Fig. 9.15). Speciﬁcally, SACs can signiﬁcantly reduce the acti-
vation energy due to induced electrostatic polarization of the C–H bond. Suggestions 
that the distinct metal–support interaction can stabilize the intermediate, the chem-
ical nature of catalytic sites, effects of metal–support interaction, and stabilization 
of intermediate species on catalysts to minimize over-oxidation were discussed in 
details.
In account [61], progress on thermal methane activation by metal oxide clusters 
doped with noble-metal atoms (Au, Pt, and Rh) as well as by oxygen-free species 
including carbides and borides of base metals (V, Ta, Mo, and Fe) was summarized. 
The generations of stable products such as formaldehyde, acetylene, and syngas 
as well as closed-shell species AuCH3 and B3CH3 have been identiﬁed. The new 
mechanisms of synergistic methane activation by Lewis acid–base pairs (such as 
Auδ+-Oδ− and Bδ+-Bδ−) and by dinuclear metal centers (such as Ta-Ta) have been 
revealed. The new mechanisms suggested that: (1) In the reactions between methane

and oxide clusters doped with noble-metal atoms, the oxide cluster “supports” can 
accept the H atoms; (2) the CH species delivered through the noble-metal atoms; 
(3) then its transform methane into stable oxygenated compounds; (4) the product 
selectivity can be controlled by different noble-metal atoms (such as Pt vs. Rh); (5) the 
electronic structures of base metal centers can be engineered through carburization; 
and (6) the boron clusters (such as B3 in VB3 +) can be polarized by the metal cations 
to form the Lewis acid–base pair Bδ+-Bδ− to cleave the C–H bond of methane. 
The reconstitution of puriﬁed photosystem II (PSII) from Thermosynechococcus 
elongatus BP-1 into the membrane fraction containing particulate р-monooxygenase 
(pMMO) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was performed [77]. This result 
indicated that the sequential redox chain from PSII through the quinone pool methane 
mono oxygenase (pMMO) can be constructed and that water can serve as the electron 
donor for methane hydroxylation under irradiation with light. When an electron donor 
was added for methane hydroxylation, pMMO in the membrane fraction produced 
hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct.

Molecular Imprinting 
Molecular imprinting (MIP) is a technique to create template-shaped cavities in 
polymer matrices with predetermined selectivity and high afﬁnity in a speciﬁc func-
tion [78–92]. Analogs of substrates, transition states, or products as template can 
be used in preparation of molecularly imprinted systems. Molecular imprinting on 
nanozymes provides a solution to substrate speciﬁcity problem, and the catalytic 
activity can be enhanced. The synthesis of molecular imprinting (MIP) materials

can include the following steps (Figs. 9.16 and 9.17) [78]: (1) The template or print 
molecule is mixed with functional monomers that get positioned spatially around 
the template and guide the assembly; (2) the polymerization reaction creates a cross-
linked matrix around the template; (3) the template is removed from the polymer 
network leaving a complementary cavity. A molecularly imprinted catalyst general 
scheme for selective catalysis is displayed in Figs. 9.16 and 9.17. 
The process adsorption of substrates, reaction, and product release in printed 
nanozymes was studied using reaction kinetics measurement, dynamic light scat-
tering, UV–vis spectrometry, and isothermal titration calorimetry [90]. Diffusion of 
the substrate across the imprinted gel layer was studied by a pre-incubation exper-
iment. Difference between imprinted and nonimprinted gel layers was highlighted. 
Enrichment of local substrate concentration by imprinting and consequent increase 
activity was around eightfold and a substrate-imprinted sample had the lowest acti-
vation energy of 13.8 kJ mol−1. Artiﬁcial enzyme with magnetic properties of F3O4 
core, silica methacrylic layers, and peroxidase activity on indoleamine metabolite 
tumor marker was designed and characterized (Fig. 9.18) [85]. To protect the iron 
nucleus from oxidation and to provide anchoring for hydroxyl surface groups, the

magnetic molecularly imprinted catalytic stable methacrylic polymers that exhibit 
peroxidase-like activity toward 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) oxidation 
were obtained from highly crystalline magnetite nuclei coated with a silica layer 
[85]. After acrylic functionalization, a molecularly imprinted polymer with hemin as 
catalytic center and 5-HIAA as template was attached to the structure. The resulting 
hybrid possessed high catalytic ability for the selective oxidation of the indoleamine 
metabolite tumor marker. 
In study [91], to create an artiﬁcial hydrolase with speciﬁc selectivity, the 
molecular imprinting strategy was combined with the self-assembly of Fmoc-FFH 
by using p-NPA

as the imprinting template. It was found that the imprinted polymer coating on the 
surface of the catalytic peptide nanoﬁbers provided a speciﬁc binding site to p-NPA, 
enhancing the catalytic efﬁciency of the artiﬁcial hydrolase. The substrate selectivity 
of this artiﬁcial enzyme can be improved by changing the imprinting template. 
Peroxidase (POD)-mimicking catalysts based on the strategy of peptide assembly 
Fmoc-FFH and molecular imprinting were constructed [86]. Speciﬁcally, CA-H/ 
Hemin was fabricated and showed POD-like catalytic activity with 21-fold rate accel-
eration in the oxidation of 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline). Upon combining 
CA-H/Hemin with the 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate), 
the obtained imprinted catalyst (MIP-H/Hemin) indicated 52-fold acceleration. The 
substrate speciﬁcity of MIP-H/Hemin and MIP+-H/Hemin toward ABTS was also 
highlighted. 
Molecular imprinting technology based on the possibility of imprinting within the 
nanospace of doubly cross-linked micelles was developed [87]. The obtained water-
soluble MIP NPs have a hydrophobic/hydrophilic core–shell morphology, making 
this micellar imprinting useful for a variety of template molecules using molec-
ular imprinting; a peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme has achieved substrate speci-
ﬁcity with enhanced activity in a nanoscale gel for three different substrates [88]. 
DNAzymes are DNA oligonucleotides were fund to be capable of performing a 
speciﬁc chemical reaction, similar to the action of ribozymes (enzymes composed of 
RNA). Speciﬁcally, a molecularly imprinted DNAzyme nanogel of high peroxidase-
mimicking was prepared using Amplex Red

as the template [89]. The nanogel selectively oxidized Amplex Red in the presence 
of H2O2 to form a ﬂuorescent product, while the oxidation of other substrates was 
inhibited. The activity of this imprinted DNAzyme was even higher than that of the 
free DNAzyme.

Artiﬁcial Photosynthesis 
Abstract The studies of artiﬁcial photosynthesis use biomimetic techniques to repli-
cate the process of natural photosynthesis, which employs abundant resources of 
sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and energy-rich carbohy-
drates. In this chapter, requirements for successive mimicking of these processes 
and means for fulﬁllment, these requirements were formulated. The compounds 
such as porphyrins or other cyclic tetrapyrroles, coratenoides, ruthenium and zinc 
complexes, fullerenes, borondipyrromethene, melanin, polyphenylene, go forth, can 
be light harvesters. Examples of charge separation in artiﬁcial donor–acceptor and 
pairs and photophysical and photochemical processes in dual ﬂourophore-nitroxide 
molecules were presented and discussed in separate sections. The evolution dioxygen 
from water in a cluster of transition metals in the biological systems at the absorp-
tion of four light quanta of low energy occurs by a sequence of elementary steps: 
four one-electron steps of oxidation of the manganese complex and, most probably 
by one four-electron elementary step of O2 evolution (Sect. 3.5.2). In approaching 
mimicking problem, a number of artiﬁcial manganese clusters and other transi-
tion metal clusters were synthesized and investigated. The reduction, or ﬁxation, 
of carbon dioxide is a vital process associated with natural and artiﬁcial photosyn-
thesis in which can generate hydrocarbon fuels such as formic acid, methanol, carbon 
monoxide, and methane, with the utilization of hydrogen. Employing of transition 
metal complexes catalyzed carboxylation reactions with CO2 and carboxylation of 
preactivated substrates and examples of successive carboxylation were presented The 
chapter focused on advances in the ﬁeld of direct carboxylation reactions of C(sp3)– 
H and C(sp2)–H bonds using CO2 encompassing both transition metal catalysis and 
base-mediated approach and on applications of electrochemical and photochemical 
methods.

Artiﬁcial Photosynthesis
10.1 
Introduction 
Artiﬁcial photosynthesis is mimicking the process of natural photosynthesis, uses 
abundant resources of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and 
energy-rich carbohydrates [1–49]. Fuels that are able to be produced by artiﬁ-
cial photosynthesis include hydrocarbons such as formic acid (HCOOH), methanol 
(CH3OH), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), or pure hydrogen fuel. The 
chemical processes involved in artiﬁcial photosynthesis include the splitting of water 
into oxygen and hydrogen, and the reduction of carbon dioxide into various hydro-
carbons. In this way, energy can be being stored densely and cheaply in the form of 
a fuel (Fig. 10.1) [1–12]. 
There are three principal steps in artiﬁcial photosynthesis, which are similar to 
natural photosynthesis: the absorption of light to reach an excited state, charge gener-
ation and separation, and chemical conversion for the production of fuel. There is 
also the possible extension of carbon dioxide ﬁxation for the further production of 
other fuels besides pure hydrogen. 
Photoinduced charge separation is the process of an electron in an atom or 
molecule, being excited to a higher energy level by the absorption of a photon and

cycle that minimizes unwanted by-products. https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainssolar-

then electron transfer to a nearby electron acceptor. Charge separation processes play 
key role in photovoltaics, natural and artiﬁcial photosynthesis, and photolumines-
cence sensors and switches [2–49]. There are two main objections to the mimicking 
of the photosynthetic process of light energy conversion in reaction centers via the 
mechanism of charge photoseparation on chemically active cation and anion radi-
cals: (1) establishing factors affecting fast stages of primary electron transfer in 
donor–acceptor pairs using femto-, pico-, and nanosecond time domain techniques 
and (2) building donor–acceptor structures capable of retaining the photoseparated 
structures long enough for secondary chemical reactions of the charges to occur. 
For successive mimicking the following requirements, sometimes contradictory 
ones, should be fulﬁlled: (1) Creation of light harvesting system with broad absorp-
tion spectrum covering sun light radiation spectra; (2) Construction of systems which 
have long charge separation state lifetimes; (3) Minimization of a loss of light energy 
during the multistep electron transfer processes; (4) Maintaining high reactivity of 
cation and anion segments after charge separation sufﬁcient for consequent chem-
ical and photochemical reactions; and (5) Prevention of side reactions including the 
donor exited state quenching. 
The following means for fulﬁllment of these requirements can be formulated: 
(1) Chromophores in excited singlet state of high energy as electron donor should 
be preferably used; (2) The thermodynamic gap between ET intermediates should 
be optimum; (3) To avoid a competition with the spontaneous quenching of the 
primary donor exited state, the ﬁrst steps of the charge separation (CS) by electron 
transfer should be fast; (4) The best way to prevent the fast charges recombination 
(CR) is a construction of a cascade system of intermediate acceptors separated by 
nonconductive bridge of 6–8 Å composed with nonsaturated chemical bonds [18–21]; 
(5) A promising way to slow down charges recombination (CR) is an organization of 
the spin catalysis which provide singlet-triplet conversion on the CS pair; and (6) A 
redox system can be protected from side reactions by using for example membranes or 
polymers, which separate initial and ﬁnal reagents, or by incorporation of donor and 
acceptor groups in a protein or other matrix, as it is realized in natural photosynthesis.

Light Harvesting and Charge Separation in Artiﬁcial 
Photosynthetic Systems 
10.2.1 
Artiﬁcial Light Harvesting Antenna 
The requirement of an antenna coupled to a photochemical reaction center, as 
occurs in natural photosynthetic constructs, is a necessary feature for efﬁcient 
photocatalytic operation in artiﬁcial solar energy conversion systems. Another prin-
cipal requirement is high quantum yield of the photo separation, which can be 
provided by optimum combination of fast electron transfer and slow recombina-
tion in photochemical cascade systems keeping high chemical redox reactivity of

the photoseparated pair. The speciﬁc classes of compounds such as porphyrins or 
other cyclic tetrapyrroles, coratenoides, ruthenium and zinc complexes, fullerenes, 
borondipyrromethene, melanin, go forth, have been attracted special interest. A 
promising means to increase variety of effective and durable photochemical light 
conversion systems is the use of templates, for examples zeolites and mesoporous 
silica, TiO2, nanoﬁbers, polymers, liposomes, metal-protein complexes, fullerenes, 
go forth. It is necessary to stress an outstanding role of fullerenes as antennas, electron 
acceptors, and molecular wires. 
A review [22] discussed self-assembly strategies for integrating light harvesting 
and charge separation in artiﬁcial photosynthetic systems. Self-assembly strategies 
involving π-stacking in covalent building blocks based on chemically robust arylene 
imide and diimide dyes, biomimetic porphyrins, and chlorophylls were developed 
[21]. The constructed blocks were used to integrate light harvesting with charge 
separation and transport. To elucidate the solution phase structures, monodisperse 
noncovalent aggregates systems small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/ 
WAXS) from a synchrotron source were exploited. The author stressed that the central 
scientiﬁc challenge is to develop small, functional building blocks with a minimum 
number of covalent linkages. In the search for design principles of efﬁcient artiﬁcial 
light harvesters, an approach based on self-assembly of pyropheophorbide-peptide 
conjugates was proposed and the solvent-driven and controlled aggregation of the 
peptide moieties was prepared [23]. The formation of a dense network of interacting 
pigments gave rise to an excitonic network. The obtained system was character-
ized by intense and spectrally wide absorption bands. The ultrafast dynamics of 
the nanosystems was studied using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. The 
experiment revealed that the excitation energy is funneled in an ultrafast time range 
(hundreds of femtoseconds). 
Results from transient absorption spectroscopy on a series of artiﬁcial light 
harvesting dyads made up of a zinc phthalocyanine (Pc) covalently linked to 
carotenoids with 9, 10, or 11 conjugated carbon–carbon double bonds (dyads 1, 
2, and 3), were presented [17]. The results indicated that: (1) The energy transfer and 
excited-state deactivation pathways followed excitation of the carotenoid S2 state as 
a function of the conjugation length; (2) The S2 state rapidly relaxes to the S* and S1 
states; (3) In all systems a new pathway of energy deactivation within the carotenoid 
manifold in which the S* state acts as an intermediate state was detected; (4) The S2 
→ S1 internal conversion pathway on a sub-picosecond time scale was revealed; (5) 
In dyad 3, a novel type of collective carotenoid–Pc electronic state that may corre-
spond to a carotenoid excited state(s)–Pc Q exciplex was observed; (6) In dyad 1, 
two carotenoid singlet excited states, S2 and S1, contribute to singlet–singlet energy 
transfer to Pc; (7) The process is very efﬁcient (> 90%) while for dyads 2 and 3 the 
S1 energy transfer channel is precluded and only S2 is capable of transferring energy 
to Pc; and (8) In the latter two systems, the lifetime of the ﬁrst singlet excited state of 
Pc is shortened compared to the 9 double-bond dyad and model Pc, indicating that 
the carotenoid acts as a strong quencher of the phthalocyanine excited-state energy.

poly(phenylene ethynylene) conjugated polyelectrolytes assembled within a posi-

energy acceptor (the cyanine dye DiI) effective molar absorption was enhanced by 
up to 18-fold due to the antenna effect. Absorption ampliﬁcation of DiI was found to 
be due primarily to direct energy transfer from polymers. The membrane embedding 
fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butryic acid methyl ester (PCBM) 
acts as an electron acceptor. It was suggested that the light harvested by the polymers 
was transferred via through-space mechanisms. 
10.2.2 
Charge Separation in Artiﬁcial Donor–Acceptor Pairs 
In works [10, 22, 24–55] a congruent and systematic set of well-designed models 
has been synthesized and the photochemical and photophysical properties of these 
models were characterized. Below are a few typical examples. In the covalent donor– 
acceptor–acceptor molecule (D–A–A) in toluene at 295 K (Fig. 10.2), selective 
photoexcitation of with a 416 nm, 120 fs laser pulse initiates a series of photophys-
ical and photo chemical processes [28]. The rate of intramolecular charge transfer 
from biphenyl to naphthalene was determined for the radical anions and radical 
cations of molecules with the general structure: (2-naphthyl)-(steroid spacer)-(4-
biphenylyl). Degrees of unsaturation (one double bond, NSenB; two double bonds, 
NSen2B; and the b-ring completely aromatized, NSarB) incorporated into the steroid 
spacer were varied. The several main results were reported: (1) The charge-transfer 
rate, the decay of the biphenyl radical ion absorption increased in all cases relative 
to the completely saturated 3-(2-naphthyl)-16-(4-biphenylyl)-5α-androstane (NSB) 
reference molecule; (2) For the anion charge transfer, the decay rates increased by 
factors of 1.4, 4.2, and 5.1, respectively; and (3) For the cation, the decay rates 
increased by factors of 5, 276, and 470. To explain these results, the charge-transfer 
process was viewed as a combination of two independent mechanisms: a single-
step, superexchange mechanism, and a two-step, sequential charge. The critical vari-
able for this analysis was the free energy of formation (ΔGI°) of the intermediate 
state: (2-naphthyl)-[spacer]1±-(4-biphenylyl). It was concluded that superexchange

is the dominant mechanism when ΔGI° is large, but at small ΔGI°, the sequential 
mechanism will dominate. 
Photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer (ET) and energy transfer 
(EnT) processes in two rotaxanes, one containing both zinc porphyrin and 
C60 fullerene moieties incorporated around the Cu(I) bisphenanthroline core 
[(ZnP)2-Cu(I)(phen)2-C60] and a second complex lacking the fullerene [(ZnP)2-
Cu(I)(phen)2] [16] (Fig. 10.3) were studied by time-resolved electron paramagnetic 
resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy at 9.5 GHz (X-band) combined with a selec-
tive photoexcitation of the rotaxane moieties. The experiments were carried out 
in isotropic toluene and ethanol and in anisotropic nematic liquid-crystal (E-7) 
media over a wide range of temperatures. The results indicated that the efﬁciencies 
and pathways of the light-driven ET and EnT processes in both rotaxanes depend 
on the properties of their microenvironment, resulting in the formation of distinct 
charge-separated states under different experimental conditions.
A series of donor−bridge−acceptor (D–B–A) molecules was examined [29]. 
In the supermolecule, the photoexcited charge-transfer state of 3,5-dimethyl-
4-(9-anthracenyl)julolidine (DMJ−An) was the donor, and naphthalene-1,8:4,5-
bis(dicarboximide) (NI) was the acceptor, along with 1,1-diphenylethene, trans-
stilbene, diphenylmethane, and xanthone bridges [29]. Time-resolved spectroscopy 
indicated that photoinitiated charge separation (CS) through the cross-conjugated 
1,1-diphenylethene bridge and through the diphenylmethane bridge is about 30 
times slower than through its linearly conjugated trans-stilbene counterpart. It 
was suggested that cross-conjugation decreased the π orbital contribution to the 
donor−acceptor electronic coupling electron transfer that most likely uses the bridge 
σ system as its primary CS pathway. The effect of relative orientation on the charge-
transfer CT that excited-state energies of porphyrin-fullerene dyads (base- and Zn-
tetraphenyl porphyrin coupled to C60 as the acceptor molecule in an end-on conﬁgu-
ration) was examined [30]. The energetics of a few low-lying CT states for the end-on 
geometry to calculated CT energetics of a co-facial orientation were compared. The 
calculated CT excitation energies were obtained to be larger for the end-on orienta-
tion in comparison with the co-facial structure by about 0.7 eV. Furthermore, changes 
in relative donor–acceptor orientation have a larger impact on the CT energies than 
changes in donor–acceptor distance.

Double excitation by nanosecond pump–pump–probe experiments was used to 
interrogate the photoinduced charge transfer and charge accumulation on a molec-
ular dyad composed of a porphyrin chromophore and a ruthenium-based catalyst 
in the presence of a reversible electron acceptor [31]. The experiment indicated 
rapid reverse electron transfer to the photosensitizer upon the second excitation and 
the low driving force of the forward photodriven electron transfer reaction. Such a 
method allowed the understanding of the relaxation mechanism after two sequential 
photon absorptions, deciphering the undesired electron transfer reactions that limit 
the charge accumulation efﬁciency.

on governing excited-state charge separation was examined [32]. For this 
series, the Stokes shift followed the order β > meso >  α-substitution for a 
given series of BODIPY derivatives, while E0,0 followed the order meso > α-
> β-substitution. BODIPY has been modiﬁed to contain an electron donor 
moiety, 8-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-diﬂuoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-
diaza-s-indacene (MEOPHBDP) [33]. The photovoltaic measurements combined 
with femtosecond laser ﬂash photolysis were performed using a standard two-
employing electrode system consisting of a working electrode and a Pt sputtered 
electrode in methoxyacetonitrile containing 0.5 M iodide and 0.05 M I2. The lifetime 
of the charge-separated state of MEOPHBDP was found to be 59 ps at 298 K. The dye-
sensitized solar cells (DSSC) were prepared using MEOPHBDP with carboxylic acid 
(MEOPHBDP−COOH). The photovoltaic measurements were performed utilizing 
a standard two-electrode system consisting of a working electrode and a Pt sputtered 
electrode in methoxyacetonitrile containing 0.5 M iodide and 0.05 M I(2). 
The photophysical properties of two pyrene–bodipy molecular dyads, composed 
of a phenyl-pyrene (Py-Ph) linked to the meso position of a bodipy (BD) molecule 
with either H-atoms (BD1) or ethyl groups (BD2) at the 2,6 positions, were investi-
gated by stationary, nanosecond, and femtosecond spectroscopy [34]. Experiments 
revealed a weak coupling among the subunits in both dyads (Py-Ph-BD1 and Py-Ph-
BD2) and showed that electron transfer occurs within 0.3–0.5 ps which is independent 
of the solvent and the type of the BD subunit. Excited state of Py-Ph-BD1 in ACN was 
quenched having a lifetime of 1 ns. Target analysis of the TA spectra has shown that 
the charge separation (CS) follows inverted kinetics and is slower than the recom-
bination of the charge-separated state. Three bodipy-based (BDP = 4,4-diﬂuoro-
4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) donor–acceptor dyads were synthesized, and their 
ground-state and photophysical properties were characterized [35]. The electronic 
coupling between the BDP chromophore and an electron-donating carbazole occurs. 
By controlling the rate of photoinduced internal charge transfer (ICT), effect of 
variation of the linkage between the donor and acceptor moieties on the photophys-
ical behavior of excited-state deactivation was examined. Density functional theory 
(DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) showed that, when attachment occurred 
through the beta position of BDP, molecular orbital density spread across the HOMO. 
A Cu(I)-promoted oxidative dimerization of BODIPY dyes was developed to give a 
series of α,α-ethylene-bridged BODIPY dimers and trimers [48]. This methodology

homocoupling reaction. 
A series of 3,5-bis(hetero)arylethenyl-substituted BODIPY derivatives have been 
prepared by Knoevenagel-type condensation of alkyl-substituted BODIPY with 
the corresponding aldehydes [37]. Alkylation at the N-pyrrolic position of the 
ethenyl substituent allowed for the installation of the hydrophilic PEG group and 
afforded amphiphilic BODIPY derivatives. 2-pyrrolylethenyl-substituted deriva-
tives featured near-IR emission (λem > 700 nm) with a high ﬂuorescence quantum 
yield. Both the emission maxima and ﬂuorescence quantum yields were insen-
sitive to solvent polarity, contrary to the corresponding near-IR-emitting 4-(N,N-
dimethylaminophenyl)ethenyl derivatives. 
The photoinduced charge-transfer process in a hydrogen-bonded pair of melamine 
(donor) 
and isocyanuric acid (acceptor) 
(Fig. 10.4) was investigated by using real-time quantum–classical simulations of 
the relaxation from the Franck–Condon point to the region of strong nonadiabatic 
coupling, where electron transfer occurs [38]. The simulation, suggesting the of 
strong nonadiabatic coupling, revealed how the charge transfer is coupled to speciﬁc 
vibrational modes and how it is affected by isotope substitution. The importance 
of resonance in nuclear and electron dynamics and the role of dynamic symmetry 
breaking was emphasized and exchange of angular momentum between nuclear 
and electronic subsystems in an electron–nuclear resonant process was inferred.

(acceptor) were examined. Figure 10.14 illustrates the relevant molecular orbitals 
involved in the photoinduced ET process obtained for an optimized geometry at 
the DFT/BLYP level. See details in [38]. According to suggested scheme: (1) The 
melamine is excited from its HOMO (HOMO of the total system) to its LUMO 
(the LUMO+2 of the total system), with the LUMO and LUMO+1 localized on the 
acceptor; (2) Upon excitation, an electron is transferred from the melamine highest 
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO); and (3) This excitation localized on the donor is higher in energy than 
the charge-transfer state from HOMO to LUMO and from HOMO to LUMO+1. 
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) (both with BLYP and CAM-
B3LYP) calculations and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations with BLYP revealed some 
important details of the process including the follows: (1) The most relevant excitonic 
excitation has the highest oscillator strength in the energy range explored; (2) The 
charge-transfer state has a lower energy resulting in an energy gradient upon exci-
tation from the excitonic to the charge-transfer state; (3) The β-HOMO occupation 
was changed to 0, while the β-LUMO+2 occupation was adapted to 1, representing 
a local excitation on the melamine; and (4) Upon instantaneous excitation in the 
Franck–Condon region, the system starts to relax toward a more preferable geom-
etry. In the Ehrenfest dynamics, classical particles evolve on a mean potential energy 
surface which is averaged over all quantum states and weighted by the corresponding 
populations. 
A schematic potential energy plot along a generic nuclear relaxation coordinate 
shown in Fig. 10.5 [38] indicated that: (1) In the deuterated case, D case, additional 
nuclear modes couple to the electronic motion in contrast to the 1H case, where the 
N–H frequencies are energetically isolated from all other modes; (2) Upon excitation, 
the system relaxes from the Franck–Condon point (FC); (3) In the 1H system, the ﬁrst 
available high-energy vibrations are due to the N–H stretching and are well-separated 
from the other modes; (4) The isotope substitution moves the resonance condition 
to lower frequencies; (5) N–H modes are the ﬁrst nuclear vibrations to match the 
energy difference between the electronic states during the relaxation process; and (6) 
In the D case, the N–D stretching has a vibrational energy similar to several other 
modes, coupling to the electronic motion.
Electron transfer quenching dynamics in nonpolar solvents was investigated using 
ultrafast spectroscopy and vibrational absorption spectroscopy with a series of six 
ﬂuorophore/quencher pairs, covering a driving force range of more than 1.3 eV [39].

static regime were in nonpolar solvents beyond the diffusion limit. The measure-
ments revealed that the primary product of static quenching is a strongly coupled 
exciplex that decays within a few picoseconds. Exciplexes with a longer lifetime 
were generated subsequently, during the dynamic, diffusion-controlled stage of the 
quenching. It was suggested that static ET quenching in nonpolar solvent scan can 
be an internal conversion from a locally excited state to a charge-transfer state of a 
supermolecule. 
To study the relationship between the mutual orientation of the electron donor/ 
acceptor in the dyads and the spin-orbit charge-transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-
ISC) efﬁciency, perylenemonoimide (PMI)–carbazole (Cz) compact electron donor/ 
acceptor dyads were prepared and the photophysical properties of the dyads were 
examined with steady state and time-resolved femtosecond optical spectroscopies 
[40]. The ﬂuorescence of the PMI unit in the dyads, in which the PMI and the Cz 
units were connected via either a C–C or C–N bond, or with an intervening phenyl 
moiety, was quenched due to photoinduced electron transfer. It was found that the 
charge separation takes 0.28 ps and the charge recombination takes 1.21 ns. It was 
also found that reversible photoreduction of the PMI–Cz dyads and generation of the

(butadiyne-bridged donor–bridge–acceptor supermolecular) strongly depending on 
the structural and electronic properties of the bridge were examined using transient 
mid-IR absorption spectra of the C≡C bridge stretching modes, transient spectra 
in the visible range, and time depending TD-DFT calculations [42]. Constructed 
alkyne bridges found to be compact possess linear structure permitting access to high 
symmetry DBA molecules and allow torsional motion of donor (D) and acceptor (A), 
especially for longer bridges. Conformation-dependent electron transfer dynamics 
in a set of novel donor–bridge–acceptor DBA compounds featuring butadiene (C4) 
bridge, N-isopropyl-1,8-napthalimide (NAP) acceptors, and donors that span a range 
of reduction potentials (trimethyl silane (Si-C4-NAP), phenyl (Ph-C4-NAP), and 
dimethyl aniline (D-C4-NAP)) were investigated. The research revealed that: (1) 
Excitation of D-C4-NAP at 400 nm predominantly prepares an S1 excited state in the 
planar conformations (θ ∼ 0) but selects an S2 state with θ ∼ 90°; (2) The symmetry 
of the frontier orbitals of such DBA compounds deﬁnes the photo-selection outcome 
and determines the rate of the S2 → S1 charge separation reaction; (3) Variation of the 
S2–S1 electronic coupling with θ by over four orders of magnitude resulted in slow 
ET at θ ca. 0° and 90° but extremely fast ET at θ of 20–60°; and (4) The electronic 
excited-state energies and, the transition dipoles (S0 → Sn) depend strongly on the 
dihedral angle (θ) between D and A and the frontier orbital symmetry.

diketopyrrolopyrrole-pyrrolopyrrole (DPP-PP) dyad (AD) was examined employing 
transient absorption, broad-band ﬂuorescence upconversion, and transient impulsive 
stimulated Raman spectroscopy [43]. The process starts from the initial photoexcited 
bright exciton and goes through a partial charge-transfer (CT) state before ﬁnally 
reaching the charge-separated (CS) state. Further results of this work included the 
following: (1) AD in THF evolves to the diabatic potential energy surface of the 
CS state, whose absorption spectrum converges to that of a DPP anion for which 
ﬂuorescence is completely quenched; (2) The trend of shifting for certain vibrational 
frequencies supports the proposed CT dynamics and mechanism takes place; (3) 
This ﬁnding gives quantitative insight into the CT characters of the bright state 
(0.1 e) and intermediate partial CT state (0.5 e); (4) The linear relationship exists 
between the vibrational frequency of the marker modes and the CT character; (5) The 
structure of the bridge between donor and acceptor enables an intermediate level of 
electronic communication; and (6) The charge separation can rapidly occur through 
a distinct partial charge-transfer state. Finally, it was suggested that the strong 
electronic communication at positions 2 and 5 of the pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole core is 
a crucial element for this charge-transfer mechanism, which could be applied to 
organic photovoltaics or light-emitting diodes requiring efﬁcient charge separation.

The steady-state and transient spectral properties were investigated as a function of 
redox properties, distance, and molecular topology. The main results of the research 
are: (1) Strong electronic interactions between the phosphorus(V) porphyrin and NP 
in directly bound conjugates take place; (2) Suggested energy diagrams predicted 
reductive electron transfer involving singlet excited phosphorus(V) porphyrin and NP 
to generate high-energy (∼ 1.83–2.11 eV) charge-separated states (POEP/PTPP)·– 
(NP)·+; (3) Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies revealed rapid deactiva-
tion of singlet excited phosphorus(V) porphyrin due to charge separation wherein the 
estimated forward rate constants were in the range of 109–1010 s−1; (4) The process 
dependents on the distance between the NP and porphyrins units, as well as the redox 
potentials of the type of the phosphorus(V) porphyrin; and (5) Due to high exother-
micity and low-lying triplet states, the charge recombination process was found to 
be rapid, leading to populating the triplet states of phosphorus(V) porphyrins. 
Two electronically diverse carboxy-terminated zinc porphyrins, BFBP(Zn)-
COOH and TFP(Zn)-COOH, incorporating into the hexagonal pores of NU-1000 
via solvent-assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), and resulting in BFBP(Zn)@NU-
1000 and TFP(Zn)@NU-1000 compositions were prepared [45]. Experiments with 
the varied number of triﬂuoromethyl groups at the porphyrin e showed that: (1) 
The ground-state redox potentials of the porphyrins within ca. 0.1 V relative to 
that of NU-1000 were tuned; (2) For BFBP(Zn)@NU-1000, the relative ground-
and excited-state redox potentials of the components facilitate an energy transfer 
(EnT) from NU-1000* to BFBP(Zn), forming BFBP(Zn)S1; (3) A long-lived charge-
separated complex was formed through an exciplex-like [BFBP(Zn)S1*–TBAPy] 
intermediate; (4) Time-resolved spectroscopic data suggested that energy transfer 
(EnT) from NU-1000* occurs through a slow [NU-1000*–BFBP(Zn)] intermediate 
formation; and (5) TFP(Zn)@NU-1000 displays an efﬁcient EnT from NU-1000* to 
exited [TFP(Zn)–TBAPy]*, formed at the ground state through electronic interaction. 
The synthesis of a new fullerene–bis-Zn-porphyrin e-bisadduct by tether-directed 
functionalization of C60 via a multistep synthetic protocol was performed [46]. In 
the investigation, the transient pump–probe spectral technique covering the wide 
femtosecond-to-millisecond time scale, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-
time of ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) MALDI-TOF spectrometry, 
and variable temperature NMR were utilized. Supramolecular oligomers were subse-
quently formed involving the two porphyrin-bearing arms embracing a fullerene cage 
of the vicinal molecule. The ﬁnal supramolecular donuts revealed an inner cavity 
size estimated as 23 nm, close to that observed in photosynthetic antenna systems. 
The formation of long-lived charge-separated states was directly conﬁrmed with the 
transient pump–probe method. 
Quantum coherence deals with the idea that all objects have wave-like prop-
erties and coherence expresses the potential for two waves to interfere. Quantum 
coherence effects on charge transfer and spin dynamics in a system having 
two degenerate electron acceptors were studied employing femtosecond tran-
sient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis [47]. A zinc 5,10,15-tri(n-
pentyl)-20-phenylporphyrin (ZnP) electron donor covalently linked to either one or 
two naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) and electron acceptors with an

anthracene (An) spacer, ZnP-An-NDI (1) and ZnP-An-NDI2 (2), respectively were 
investigated. The research indicated that: (1) The electron transfer (ET) rate constant 
for 2 is about three times larger than that of 1; (2) The rate constant for charge recom-
bination (CR) of 1 is about 25% faster than that of 2; (3) The electron on NDI2·− 
in 2 localizes onto one of the two NDIs prior to CR, thus precluding electronically 
coherent CR from NDI2; (4) CR in both 1 and 2 is spin coherent; and (5) Observation 
of a resonance in the 3*ZnP yield following CR as a function of applied magnetic ﬁeld, 
gave spin–spin exchange interaction energies of 2J = 210 and 236 mT, respectively.* 
In work [49] it was demonstrated that donor–acceptor composition in complexes 
of electrolytic polythiophene (PTAK) 
and naphthalene diimide (ENDI) 
impacted the microstructure of the polymer and donor–acceptor interaction, with 
consequences for photoinduced charge-pair formation and recombination. Among 
the results of the study are the following: (1) PTAK evolved from microstructures 
showed increase of H-like to random-coil J-like excitonic coupling character with 
increasing ENDI/PTAK charge ratio; (2) ENDI exhibits weak J-like coupling at 
high acceptor densities; (3) Sub-100-fs charge separation between PTAK and ENDI

transfer exciton states; (4) Multiphasic recombination observed reﬂecting a distribu-
tion of charge-pair separation distances that is correlated with degree of exciton delo-
calization; and (5) Recombination timescales and the fraction of long-lived charge 
pairs increased with higher excitation energies, consistent with energy-dependent 
coupling between hot polymer and delocalized charge-transfer excitons. 
A host–guest supramolecular charge-transfer (CT) assembly utilizing photoactive 
anthraquinone-
based porous 2D covalent organic frameworks (COF) as an accept and N,N-
dimethylaniline (DMA) 
inside as donor, was designed (Fig. 10.6) [10]. The assembly was examined 
employing the photoinduced EPR and solid-state NMR and femtosecond broad-band 
transient absorption spectroscopy. Experiment showed that the CT occurs rapidly 
within < 110 fs after photoexcitation, subsequently leading to long-lived charge 
separation with 13% quantum efﬁciency at room temperature. ESR and solid-state 
NMR, using 1H–13C correlation experiments, conﬁrmed appearing the long-lived 
conﬁned DMA cation radical and the packing of the amines inside the host–guest

The intramolecular charge delocalization/localization character of a newly synthe-

troscopy [50]. Properties of these systems can be explained by the excited-state 
evolution from initial charge delocalization over all molecules to localization on

Three types of charge separation modes based on their driving forces, namely: asym-
metric energetics, asymmetric kinetics, and their hybrid were identiﬁed [51]. Phys-
ical parameters of the investigated system and the respective performance limitation 
relevant to all types of photocatalysts have been summarized. The charge separation 
strategies employed in the reported photocatalyst systems were elucidated, analyzed, 
and compared. 
Due to their functional diversity, 1,2,3-triazoles (Fig. 10.7) have proofed to 
be versatile building blocks for a wide range of applications, as lgand in metal 
complexes, H-bond donor/acceptor, anion receptor, anchoring group on metal 
surfaces, or linker promoting preventing intramolecular charge transfer, in particular 
[52]. A synthetic strategy for the coupling of D- and A-units was the copper-catalyzed 
alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC), forming a 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole ring.
The following criteria were derived for the design of triazole-bridged D-A dyads 
with emphasis on electron transfer properties: (1) The charge separation rate (kCS) 
and the charge-recombination rate (kCR) was higher for dyads with ﬂexible linkers 
(through-space ET); (2) The charge-recombination rate (kCR) is lower for rigid dyads 
(3) The energy barrier (ΔG‡) for oxidative reaction is higher than for reductive 
photoinduced ET; (4) The charge separation rate (kCS) for reductive photoinduced 
ET (acceptor excitation) is higher in 1-compared to 4-connected dyads; and (5) 
The electron transfer from the photoexcited D to the A unit is mediated by the 
bridge-centered unoccupied molecular orbitals. Structural and electronic properties 
of the bridge inﬂuence charge separation and recombination rates in triazole-bridged 
donor–acceptor dyads, the role of the triazole bridge energetics in thermal as well 
as oxidative and reductive photoinduced ET criteria for the design of dyads with 
different ET properties were discussed in details [52].

Photophysical and Photochemical Processes in Dual 
Flourophore-Nitroxide Molecules 
In pioneering work [53] it was demonstrated that irradiation of the chromophore 
segment of the dual compound, dansyl-TEMPO (FNO) 
in a glassy liquid (glycerol, 75%, water 20%, ethanol 5%) invoked the production 
of the hydroxylamine derivative accompanying the decay of the electron spin reso-
nance (ESR) signal from nitroxide and a parallel eightfold increase in ﬂuorescence. 
Both processes occur with the same rate constant kred under identical conditions. 
Subsequently, ﬂuorophore nitroxide compounds found wide application as double 
ﬂuorescent nitroxide labels, redox probes of high selectivity and sensitivity, and 
models for studying the mechanism of the conversion of light energy into chemical 
energy [54–64].

Dual FNO· as model systems for conversion of light energy to chemical energy 
were ﬁrst proposed and developed [53]. [For example, in the dual compound (ﬂuo-
rophore)–spacer–nitroxide] the ﬂuorophore (F) in an excited state is an electron 
donor and nitroxide fragment (NO·) serves as an electron acceptor. In this system, 
photochemical and photophysical processes follow a scheme:

where RH is a solvent (glycerol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, go forth) or an ingredient; 
Q[I], CS[I], CR[I], and ChR designate ﬂuorescence quenching, charge separation, 
charge recombination, and chemical reaction, correspondingly and FNOH is hydrox-
ylamine derivatives. Importantly, nitroxide photoreduction in the dual probes occurs 
without a violation of the ﬂuorophore structure. Therefore, the photochemical reac-
tions of the dual molecules in the system can be considered as processes of transfer 
of light energy to chemical one. 
Fluorophore–nitroxide compounds of a system designed and investigated in [64] 
consist of triad tethered with nitroxide [64]: (ﬂuorophore)–bridge–(acceptor)n– 
[nitroxide] (Fig. 10.8). The stable free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl 
(TEMPO, T*) was covalently attached to the electron acceptor in a donor–chro-
mophore–acceptor (D–C–A) system, MeOAn-6ANI-Phn-A-T*, having well-deﬁned 
distances between each component, where MeOAn = p-methoxyaniline, 6ANI 
= 4-(N-piperidinyl)naphthalene-l,8-dicarboximide, Ph = 2,5-dimethylphenyl (n =

A = naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NI) or pyromellitimide (PI). Using 
both time-resolved optical and EPR spectroscopy, it was showed that T* inﬂu-
ences the spin dynamics of the photogenerated triradical states 2,4(MeOAn+*-6ANI-
Phn-A-*-T*), resulting in modulation of the charge recombination rate within the 
triradical. In this system, the nitroxide segment effects on the separated charge 
recombination by mechanism of spin catalysis:

The presence of nitroxide allowed to control the lifetimes of photoinduced radical 
ion pairs. Owing to the spin catalysis effect, the charge recombination can be locked 
up and the ability of the system to retain the photoseparated state is long enough for 
secondary chemical reactions of these charges. Energy level diagram showing the 
spin manifolds triad after charge separation and charge recombination is displayed 
in Fig. 10.9. The authors concluded that the nitroxide tethering does not affect 
markedly the charge separation and the resonance integral but decreases the charge 
recombination time by factor 2.5.

In order to model effects of protein on the ET in ﬂuorophor-nitroxides, the dual 
probes FN1 was incorporated in bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fig. 10.10) [57–61]. 
The photoreduction of the nitroxide fragment was monitored by ESR, and ﬂuo-
rescence quenching was measured by steady-state and picosecond time-resolved 
techniques. It is important that both ﬂuorescent and nitroxide fragments allowed 
to investigate the factors affecting the ET to be measured, namely, the molecular 
dynamics and micropolarity of the medium in the vicinity of the donor (by ﬂuores-
cence technique) and the same properties in the vicinity of nitroxide acceptor (by 
ESR). 
The measurements of the dynamic shift of time-resolved spectra of the dual 
probe ﬂuorescent fragment using picosecond ﬂuorescence time-resolved technique 
(Fig. 10.11) allowed to obtain time of dynamic reorganization (relaxation) of the 
BAS binding which shows protein dynamics of the nanosecond scale. This conclu-
sion was independently conﬁrmed by analyzing ESR spectra of the nitroxide frag-
ment. Diagram of the Gibbs energy levels for ET in the dual molecule FN1 in BSA 
is presented in Fig. 10.11 [57].
Based on experimental data on the local apparent dielectric constant ε0 in the 
vicinity of the donor dansyl groups (ﬂuorescence technique) and around the acceptor 
nitroxide segments (ESR), the following parameters of the Marcus–Levich theory 
(Chap. 4) were estimated for the ET at T = 300 K: Gibbs energy ΔG0 = − 1.7 eV, 
reorganization energy λ = 0.9 eV, and activation energy ΔG# ≈ 0.25 eV. It should 
be emphasized that the process of thermodynamic charge photoseparation is ther-
modynamically allowed only in the case of stabilization of the charge separation 
pair due to the protein medium (Fig. 10.12). The latter, in turn, is possible only as

Artiﬁcial Photoenzymes on the Base of Model Vesicles 
The photosynthetic (thylakoid) membranes can contain pigments that participate 
in light absorption and charge separation and can act as a barrier to inhibit the 
undesirable recombination and side reactions of photogenerated oxidizing and 
reducing species [65–68]. Figure 10.13 illustrates a scheme of a liposome formed 
by phospholipids in an aqueous solution which is widely used in design and investi-
gation of artiﬁcial photoenzymes. Works from several laboratories were devoted the

as carrier molecules was examined. Redox processes showing chemical speciﬁcity 
have been detected between aqueous reactants, separated by liquid membranes. 
In the planar bilayer, photocurrents could occur in bilayers containing photosen-
sitive pigments [71]. Two explanations of the photoconduction processes (photocur-
rents) that could occur in bilayers containing photosensitive pigments located in 
the bilayer was discussed. It was proposed that the photoinduced current occurs 
by electron hopping between pigment molecules inside the lipid bilayer. The other 
suggested that photoformed mobile ions in the lipid bilayer are the current carriers. 
Photoregulated transmembrane charge separation by linked piropyran-anthraquinone 
molecules was reported [67]. Experiment showed that amide-linked spiropyran-
anthraquinone (SP-AQ) conjugates mediates ZnTPPS4− photosensitized transmem-
brane reduction of occluded Co(bpy)3 3+ within unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesi-
cles by external EDTA. The quantum yield decreased by 6-fold in the simple conju-
gate and 3-fold for an analogue containing a lipophilic 4-dodecylphenoxy substituent 
on the anthraquinone moiety. Rapid electroneutral charge transport across vesicle

as the electron carrier, which undergo reversible ring-opening hydrolysis to form 
neutral diketones after deposition of the electron inside the vesicle, was investi-
gated [70]. As the pyrylium cations are the primary acceptors for the photoproduced 
electrons, this approach simpliﬁes the design of vesicle-based photocatalytic devices. 
The photophysical properties of multichromophoric systems consisting of eight 
red or blue naphthalene diimide (NDIs) 
covalently attached to a p-octiphenyl scaffold, as well as a blue bichromophoric 
system with a biphenyl scaffold, have been investigated in detail using femtosecond 
time-resolved spectroscopy [72]. These systems formed self-assemble in lipid bilayer 
membranes and enable generation of a transmembrane proton gradient upon photoex-
citation. The lifetime of the charge-separated state investigated using femtosecond 
time-resolved spectroscopy was found to increase from 22 to 45 ps by going from 
the bi- to the octachromophoric blue systems in methanol, while a 400 ps decay 
component was observed in the lipid membrane. 
Endoergic electron transport across vesicle bilayers from ascorbate (Asc−) in the  
inner waterpool to methylviologen (MV2+) 
in the outer aqueous solution driven by the irradiation of pyrene derivatives embedded 
in the vesicle bilayers was examined [75]. The main results of the work are: (1) The 
initial rate of MV2+ reduction dependents on the substituent group of the pyrenyl 
ring; (2) A hydrophilic functional group linked with the pyrenyl ring by a short 
methylene chain acts as a sensitizer for the electron transport; and (3) The electron

transport initiated by the reductive quenching of the singlet excited state of the (1-
pyrenyl) alkanoic acids occurred. It was suggested that the latter process proceeds by a 
mechanism involving electron exchange between the pyrenes located at the inner and 
outer interface across the vesicle bilayer. In addition, unsymmetrically substituted 
pyrenes having both a hydrophilic group linked by a short methylene chain and 
a hydrophobic long alkyl group were designed and investigated. Thus, described 
system acted as sensitizers for the electron transport across vesicle bilayers. 
Voltammograms for the electron transport through a bilayer lipid membrane, 
BLM, from one aqueous phase, W1, to another, W2, were recorded with the BLM 
containing 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane, TCNQ 
or decamethyl ferrocene, DMFc 
exposed to W1 containing [Fe(CN)6]4− and W2 containing [Fe(CN)6]3− [74]. The 
voltammogram experiments indicated that: (1) The formation of an anion radical of 
TCNQ or a cation of DMFc in the BLM followed by the interfacial redox reactions 
at both W1|BLM and BLM|W2 interfaces; (2) The BLM containing TCNQ gave a 
large current for the electron transport controlled by the electron exchange in the 
BLM; (3) The electron transport through the BLM requires the proximity between 
the redox potential of redox species in the BLM; and (4) In aqueous phases both the 
oxidized and reduced form in the BLM exist.

mixtures using ﬂuorescence excitation versus absorptance spectra, quenching of 
donor ﬂuorescence, modeling emission spectra of a mixture versus components and 
time-resolved spectroscopy (ﬂuorescence, ultrafast absorption). The main reported 
results of the experiments are as follows: (1) Binary donor–acceptor systems that 
employ a boron-dipyrrin donor 
(S0 ↔ S1 absorption/emission in the blue-green) and a chlorin or bacteriochlorin 
acceptor (S0 ↔ S1 absorption/emission in the red or near-infrared) have an average 
excitation-energy-transfer efﬁciency (ΦEET) of  ∼ 50%; (2) Binary systems with 
a chlorin donor and a chlorin or bacteriochlorin acceptor have ΦEET ∼ 85%; (3) 
The differences in ΦEET track the donor-ﬂuorescence/acceptor-absorption spectral 
overlap within a dipole–dipole coupling (Förster) mechanism; and (4) The time 
proﬁles and resulting ΦEET were modeled on the basis of Förster energy transfer 
between chromophores relatively densely packed in a two-dimensional compartment.

Oxygen Evolution Complex (OEC) Mimics 
The lifegiving process of water decomposition in containing manganese photosyn-
thetic systems and its chemical models still remains one of the most challenging 
mysterious problems to biochemists and chemists. The evolution dioxygen from 
water in a cluster of transition metals in the biological systems at the absorption of 
light quanta of low energy occurs by a sequence of elementary steps: four one-electron 
steps of oxidation of the manganese complex and, most probably by one four-electron

elementary step of O2 evolution (Sect. 3.5.2) [76]. In approaching this problem, a 
number of artiﬁcial manganese clusters and other transition metal clusters were 
synthesized and investigated [24, 77–97]. The synthesis of Mn cluster-based cata-
lysts to mimic the structural and catalytic properties of the oxygen-evolving complex 
in photosystem II is a longstanding goal for researchers. Review [92] described a 
progress for three strategies which have been followed to prepare functional synthetic 
analogues of the oxygen evolution complex (OEC): (1) The synthesis of dinuclear 
manganese complexes designed to act as water oxidation catalysts in homogeneous 
solution; (2) Preparation of heterogeneous catalysts in the form of clay hybrids of such 
Mn2-complexes; and (3) The preparation of manganese oxide particles of different 
compositions and morphologies. The prospect of designing efﬁcient, robust and 
affordable catalysts for light-driven water oxidation photosynthesis was discussed. 
Mn(IV) bound to lipid vesicles is an active catalyst for O2 evolution in the presence 
of strong one-electron oxidants, such as [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and [Fe(bpy)3]3+ where bpy 
is 2,2ʹ-bipyridyl [88]. The mechanism of evaluation of the O2 forming center was 
discussed. It was speculated that if a lipid membrane is formed in the presence of 
Mn2+, the  Mn2+ may be incorporated into the membrane forming the catalyst for O2 
evolution from H2O. 
A model water oxidation complex [H2O(terpy)Mn(O)2Mn(terpy)OH2](NO3)3 
(terpy is 2,2ʹ:6ʹ,2ʺ-terpyridine), containing a di-μ-oxo manganese dimer, was synthe-
sized and structurally characterized [89]. This complex catalyzed O2 evolution 
using strong oxidant either KHSO (potassium oxone) or NaOCl via an interme-
diate complex [(terpy)(SO4)MnIV(O)2MnIV(SO4)(terpy)]. Isotope-labeling studies 
using H2 18O and KHS16O5 showed that O2 evolution proceeds via an intermediate 
that can exchange with water. The rate-limiting step of O2 evolution was proposed to 
be the formation of a formally MnV:O moiety which could then competitively react 
with either oxone or water/hydroxide to produce O2. Dioxygen evolution in systems 
containing cubane-type tetramers, [Ru4(CO)12(μ3-Se)4] and [(dpp)6Mn4O4] (dpp-
= diphenyl phosphinate anion) have been examined [79]. The system released O2 
under UV-light absorption in the gas phase. The structure of oxocubane core Mn4O4 6+ 
complex which mimics of the photosynthetic water oxidation system was revealed. 
A series of dimanganese complexes, [Mn2III,IV(μ-O)2(terpy)2(H2O)2]3+ (1), 
[Mn2III,IV(μ-O)2(terpy)2(CF3CO2)2]+ (2), and [Mn2III,III(μ-O)(terpy)2(CF3CO2)4] 
(terpy = 2,2ʹ:6,2ʺ-terpyridine) have been crystallographically characterized [87]. 
Two new terpyridine dimanganese complexes: a manganese(III, III) complex with 
a single unsupported oxo bridge and a manganese(III, IV) complex with a dioxo 
bridge were synthesized and its electrochemical behavior was examined. 
The chemical principles that may govern the photosystem II water-oxidizing 
complex (PSII-WOC) by comparing the water oxidation capabilities of structurally 
related synthetic manganese-oxo complexes, particularly those with a cubical Mn4O4 
core were formulated [82]. The following important aspects of the ﬁeld were in the 
focus of the authors’ attention: (1) The [Mn4O4]6+ cubane core assembles sponta-
neously in solution from monomeric precursors or from [Mn2O2]3+ core complexes 
in the presence of bidentate chelates, for example, diarylphosphinates which bridge 
pairs of Mn atoms on each cube face (Mn4O4L6); (2) The [Mn4O4]6+ core is enlarged

relative to the [Mn2O2]3+ core, resulting in considerably weaker Mn−O bonds; (3) 
Cubanes are ferocious oxidizing agents, stronger than analogous complexes with the 
[Mn2O2]3+ core; (4) The cubane core topology is structurally suited to releasing O2, 
with high yield; (5) The photoproduct, [Mn4O2L5]+, an intact nonplanar butterﬂy 
core complex, is poised for oxidative regeneration of the cubane core upon binding 
of two water molecules and coupling to an anode; (6) Catalytic evolution of O2 
and protons from water exceeding 1000 turnovers was achieved by suspending the 
oxidized cubane, [Mn4O4L6]+, into a proton-conducting membrane (Naﬁon); (7) 
Catalytic water oxidation can be also achieved using sunlight as the only source of 
energy by replacing the external electrical bias with redox coupling to a photoanode 
incorporating a Ru(bipyridyl) dye. 
Two new polynuclear heterometallic cluster complexes with [MnIII3MIINa] (M 
= Mn, Ca) core were synthesized using two in situ formed Schiff bases and struc-
turally characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis [90]. Schiff base is a compound 
with the general structure R1R2C=NR3 (R3 = alkyl or aryl). Utilizing Clark elec-
trode and online mass spectrometry, it was shown that the compound with [MnII-
ICaIINa] appeared to catalyze water oxidation. As determined by electrochemistry 
and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) the tetranuclear manganese 
complex [Mn(IV)4O5(terpy)4H2O (2)](ClO4))6 (1; terpy = 2,2ʹ:6ʹ,2ʺ-terpyridine) 
gave catalytic water oxidation in aqueous solution [91]. Complex 1 exhibited catalytic 
water oxidation when adsorbed on kaolin clay, with Ce(IV) as the primary strong 
oxidant. The latter was characterized by diffuse reﬂectance UV/visible and EPR 
spectroscopy. DFT calculations showed that the oxygen in the mono-μ-oxo bridge, 
rather than Mn(IV), is oxidized after an electron removed from the Mn(IV,IV,IV,IV) 
tetramer. In addition, on the basis of the calculation, the formation of O2 is proposed 
to occur by reaction of water with an electrophilic manganese-bound oxyl radical 
species, (·)O-Mn2 (IV/IV), produced during the oxidation of the tetramer. 
The rates of water oxidation/O2 evolution catalyzed by six cobalt–oxo clus-
ters including the Co4O4 cubanes, Co4O4(OAc)4(py)4 and [Co4O4(OAc)2(bpy)4]2+, 
using the common Ru(bpy)3 2+/S2O8 2− photo-oxidant assay, were compared 
(Fig. 10.15) [93]. The main experimental results of the study are as follows: (1) 
At pH 8, the ﬁrst-order rate constants for these cubanes differ by 2-fold, 0.030 and 
0.015 s−1, respectively; (2) A deprotonation step and two electrons remove before O2 
evolution occur; (3) Incomplete cubane trimers were found not capable of evolving O2 
(Fig. 10.15); (3) Only the Co4O4 cubane core was shown to be the smallest catalytic 
unit for the intramolecular water oxidation pathway; (4) Oxidation of both cubanes 
to formally Co4(3III,IV) (0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl) occurs readily and neither dimers nor 
trimers are oxidized below 1.5 V pointing to appreciably greater charge delocalization 
in the [Co4O4]5+ core. The origin of catalytic activity by Co4O4 cubanes illustrates 
three key features for water oxidation: (1) four one-electron redox steps, (2) efﬁcient 
charge delocalization of the ﬁrst oxidation step across the Co4O4 cluster, allowing 
for stabilization of higher oxidizing equivalents, and (3) terminal coordination site 
for substrate aquo/oxo formation. These conclusions are fully consistent with the 
concept of a four-electron mechanism for the oxidation of two water molecules in 
the complex of the Photosystem II predicted in [76].

A novel family of heteronuclear MnIVCa–oxido complexes containing MnIVCa– 
oxido cuboidal moieties and reactive water molecules on Ca2+ have been synthesized 
and characterized to mimic the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II 
(PSII) in nature [92]. Complex A

Ca(CH3CO2)2 with a molar ratio of 4:1:1 in boiling acetonitrile in the presence 
of an excess of pivalic acid. The bond lengths of Mn–oxido (1.80–1.86 Å), Ca2+– 
oxido (2.42–2.64 Å), and Ca2+–O water (2.38–2.44 Å) were found to be similar to 
those observed in reported multinuclear Mn oxido complexes and the OEC in PSII 
[92]. 
A novel family of heteronuclear Mn(IV)Ca-oxido complexes containing 
Mn(IV)Ca-oxido cuboidal moieties and reactive water molecules on Ca2+ have 
been synthesized and characterized to mimic the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) 
of photosystem II (PSII) [94]. On the basis of hybrid density functional calculations, 
a water oxidation mechanism for a bioinspired Mn catalyst, driven by the mild 
single-electron oxidant [Ru(bpy)3]3+ was proposed [95]. The calculation suggested 
that in the catalyst, the crucial O–O bond formation proceeds from the formal 
Mn4(IV,IV,IVV) state by direct coupling of a Mn(IV)-bound terminal oxyl radical

and a di-Mn bridging oxo group. The proposed mechanism exhibits some features 
similar to the presently leading suggestion for the natural system. 
In work [96] the ﬁrst asymmetric Mn4Ca-cluster

commercial chemicals Bun 4NMnO4, Mn(CH3CO2)2 · (H2O)4, Ca(CH3CO2)2 · H2O,

The new artiﬁcial Mn4Ca-cluster displays structural similarity to that of the OEC 
in nature in respects of the asymmetric Mn4Ca core structure and peripheral ligands 
[98]. Like the biological OEC, the artiﬁcial Mn4Ca-cluster can undergo four redox 
transitions and display two low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
signals (g = 2.0 and g = 4.9) arising from two distinct ground states. A novel 
family of heteronuclear Mn(IV)Ca-oxido complexes containing Mn(IV)Ca-oxido 
cuboidal moieties and reactive water molecules on Ca2+ have been synthesized and 
characterized to mimic the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) 
in nature [98]. 
An account [99] described the results of research on manganese model chem-
istry relevant to PSII. The functional model [MnIII/IV 2(terpy)2(μ-O)2(OH2)2](NO3)3 
complex (terpy = 2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridine), a mixed-valent di-μ-oxo Mn dimer with two 
terminal aqua ligands was designed. In the presence of strong oxo-donor oxidants 
such as HSO5, this complex evolves O2. In addition, after binding to the surface 
of TiO2 via a chromophoric linker, the catalyst continued its activity and can be 
oxidized by a photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism, mimicking the natural 
PSII process. Highly active MnOx catalysts was formed in situ under photocatalytic 
conditions [100]. The most active 4MnOx catalyst (∼ 0.84 mmol O2 mol Mn−1 s−1)

was prepared from a Mn4O4. 4MnOx was characterized by pair distribution func-
tion analysis (PDF), Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron 
microscopy (HR-TEM) as a disordered, layered Mn-oxide with high surface area 
(216 m2 g−1). HR-TEM is an imaging mode of specialized transmission electron 
microscopes that allows for direct imaging of the atomic structure of samples. In 
contrast, the SMnOx formed from Mn2+ salt gave an amorphous species of lower 
surface area (80 m2 g−1) and lower activity (∼ 0.15 mmol O2 mol Mn−1 s−1). 
Crystalline oxides consisting of Mn3+ (manganite, γ-MnOOH; bixbyite, Mn2O3), 
Mn4+ (pyrolusite, β-MnO2), and multiple monophasic ﬁxed-valence manganese 
oxides, exhibiting catalytic activities for water oxidation, were investigated 
employing electrochemical measurements and ligand ﬁeld theory [101]. The exper-
iments and simulation showed that: (1) Pure β-MnO2 has no detectable catalytic 
activity; (2) γ-MnOOH (tetragonally distorted Mn3+O6, D4h symmetry) is signiﬁ-
cantly more active; (3) Mn2O3 (trigonal antiprismatic Mn3+O6, D3d symmetry) is 
the most active; (4). In a comparison of 2D-layered crystalline birnessites (δ-MnO2), 
the monovalent Mn4+ form was catalytically inert; (5) The hexagonal polymorph, 
containing few out-of-layer corner-sharing Mn3+O6, has ∼ 10-fold higher catalytic 
activity than the triclinic polymorph, containing in-plane edge-sharing Mn3+O6; (6)  
Electrochemical measurements showed that Mn3+O6 sites possess D3d ligand ﬁeld 
symmetry; and (7) In D4h Mn3+O6 sites have weaker Mn–O bonding to the two axial 
oxygen ligands, and were catalytically less efﬁcient. 
bullet Efforts have been made toward understanding O–O bond activation pathways 
of MnIII-peroxo adducts [102]. With this purpose, hydrogen-atom transfer reac-
tivity of MnIV-oxo and MnIII-hydroxo complexes was investigated. A variety of 
MnIII-peroxo adducts with varied ligand environments was generated. A series of 
MnIV-oxo complexes supported by neutral, pentadentate ligands with perturbed 
equatorial donation were synthesized and examined using parallel-mode EPR and 
Mn K-edge X-ray absorption techniques. Monitored decay of one MnIII-peroxo 
complex bearing a bulky macrocylic ligand yielded mononuclear MnIII-hydroxo 
and MnIV-oxo products, resulting from O–O bond activation of the MnIII-peroxo 
unit. Kinetic investigations of these complexes revealed a correlation between 
equatorial ligand ﬁeld strength and hydrogen-atom and oxygen-atom transfer 
reactivity. The reactivity trend also correlated with variations in MnIII/IV reduction 
potential caused by changes in the ligand ﬁeld. 
A series of artiﬁcial Mn4XO4-clusters (X = Ca/Y/Gd) have been synthesized and 
mimic both the geometric structure and the electronic structure, as well as the redox 
property of the OEC [103]. As an example, critical comparison of the OEC and the 
artiﬁcial Mn4CaO4-complex is presented in Fig. 10.16.
Figure 10.17 illustrates proposed synthesizing mechanism of the artiﬁcial 
Mn4CaO4-cluster [103].
Based on the characterization of artiﬁcial Mn4XO4-clusters, it was found that all 
μ3- and μ4-oxide bridges are tightly bound to the cluster, supporting that they may 
play roles in maintaining the cluster’s stability and integrity [103]. The oxidation 
states of the four Mn ions in all these Mn4XO4-clusters are (III, III, IV, IV), which

provides the chemical evidence for the assignment of the four Mn ions in the S1 state 
of the OEC predicted in the frame four-electron mechanism of the water oxidation 
in four nuclear clusters [76]. 
In work [104] a hypothesis that Ca2+ ﬁne-tunes the redox potential of synthetic 
oligonuclear transition metal complexes was put forward. By computing the relative 
redox potentials of substituted derivatives of the oxygen-evolving complex with 
the cations Sr2+, Gd3+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Sc3+, Na+, and Y3+ for two sequential 
transitions of its catalytic cycle it was evaluated that the redox potential correlate with 
the Lewis acidity of a redox-inactive cation connected to the redox-active transition 
metals of the cluster via oxo or hydroxo bridges (Fig. 10.18) [104]. The primary role 
for Ca2+ in biological water oxidation was stressed.
The water oxidation mechanism of the highly active water oxidation cata-
lyst [Mn4V4O17(OAc)3]3−, a polyoxometalate catalyst with a [Mn4O4]6+ cubane 
core modeling the natural oxygen-evolving complex was unraveled [105]. A 
proposed water oxidation mechanism for the bioinspired water oxidation catalyst 
[Mn4V4O17(OAc)3]3− includes the following steps: (1) The process starts from the 
activated species [Mn4 4+V4O17(OAc)2(H2O)(OH)]1− (1); (2) After activation, the

catalyst holds four redox equivalents in the form of four Mn4+ centers; (3) The 
catalyst binds co-facial OH and H2O ligands that are positioned in close prox-
imity, allowing them both to participate in water oxidation; (4) Water oxidation 
proceeds by an intramolecular ET from the OH ligand of MnB to that metal center, 
coupled with deprotonation of the neighboring H2O ligand; (5) This is followed by 
another proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and O–O bond formation, with a 
peroxo species formed on MnB; and (6) An intramolecular ET and ﬁnal proton-
coupled electron transfer (PCET) lead to the evolution and subsequent dissociation 
of O2, resulting in the deactivated catalytic species [Mn4 3+V4O17(OAc)2]4− with 
one open coordination site on MnA and MnB each. It was also found that redox 
isomerism and Jahn–Teller (JT) effects play a prominent role in the water oxida-
tion cycle of [Mn4V4O17(OAc)3]3, namely, in the O2 release step, JT distortions 
occurs (Fig. 10.19). The Jahn–Teller effect is a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry 
breaking in molecular and solid-state system. 
The recent progress in understanding a half-reaction of electricity-driven water 
splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanisms were summarized [81]. 
The suggested mechanism includes the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism 
(AEM) (Fig. 10.20) and lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) (Fig. 10.21) 
considered from both theoretical and experimental aspects. According to AEM, the 
oxygen-containing adsorbates undergo catalytic reactions on the surface-active TM 
cations of the catalyst. The strategies to reduce overpotential based on the AEM were 
introduced. LOM involves the participation of lattice oxygen for oxygen generation, 
and is able to rationalize the high intrinsic activity and surface reconstruction issues 
in some catalysts. Strategies of stabilization of adsorbed HOO*, proton acceptor 
functionality, and switching the OER pathway to LOM were discussed.
In concluding the section, it should be noted that the release of oxygen under the 
action of relatively weak oxidizing agents, as in the case of OEC, occurs only in the 
case of catalysts, four nuclear clusters of manganese, most likely according to the 
four-electron mechanism predicted in [76]. While the catalysis under the action of 
mono and two nuclear complexes requires signiﬁcantly strong oxidizing agents.

Carbon Dioxide Utilization 
The reduction, or ﬁxation, of carbon dioxide is a vital process associated with artiﬁcial 
photosynthesis. In addition to the production of oxygen and hydrogen derived from 
water, there is a great interest in generating other hydrocarbon fuels by chemically 
reducing CO2 with the utilization of hydrogen. Examples of fuel compounds that 
can be produced are formic acid (HCOOH), methanol (CH3OH), carbon monoxide 
(CO), and methane (CH4), for which the reduction reactions were presented in [106– 
125]. According to the Latimer-Frost diagram for the multi-multi-proton reduction 
of electron, CO2 in one-electron reduction of CO2 to CO2·− can be affected by only

an extremely negative E°′ redox potential of − 1.90 V versus NHE [106]. Latimer 
diagrams are the way to represent electrochemical equilibria for substances that 
have multiple oxidation states, while in a Frost diagram, ΔG°/F (= nE°) versus 
oxidation number is plotted. Therefore, the one-electron process is thermodynam-
ically forbidden in ambient condition. Nevertheless, two-electron and two-proton 
reduction of CO2:

are affected by a lower thermodynamic barrier. In particular, this means that the 
hydride can participate in reactions as a hydrogenating agent. Candidates for 
corresponding catalysts are rhenium-based complexes, as well as more abundant 
cobalt-based, nickel-based, iron-based, and zinc-based complexes. 
A review [117] focused on advances in the ﬁeld of direct carboxylation reactions 
of C(sp3)–H and C(sp2)–H bonds using CO2 encompassing both transition metal 
catalysis and base-mediated approach. The review described a number carboxy-
lation reactions, namely: (1) Transition metal-catalyzed carboxylation of preacti-
vated substrates including allylstannanes, organoboronic esters, organozinc reagents 
and aryl halides; (2) Transition metal-catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of unsaturated 
compounds (oleﬁns, allenes, alkynes) requiring AlEt3, ZnEt2 coreactants to generate 
a metal-hydride species undergoing insertion of the unsaturated substrate and subse-
quent carboxylation of the organometallic intermediate; (3) The use of CO2 in 
conjunction with alkenes, alkynes, dienes, allenes, diynes, in oxidative cycloaddition 
reaction of low-valent metal complexes to form ﬁve-membered metallacycles; and 
(4) Direct carboxylation of C–H bonds with CO2 avoiding C–H prefunctionalization, 
hydrocarboxylation or metallacycle formation. In addition, several examples of base-
promoted reactions integrating base recycling or base regeneration (through elec-
trosynthesis)” steps have been reported. A representative example of synthetically 
efﬁcient, base-promoted processes is presented in Fig. 10.22.
Substantial progress reviewed in [111] has recently been provided the general 
understanding of the interfacial CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in electro and 
photocatalysis. A classiﬁcation scheme to group different aspects inﬂuencing the 
interfacial CO2RR thermodynamics and kinetics was introduced. A survey of the 
literature was focused on the local chemical environment encompassing surface 
effects (adsorbates, support), solution interactions (electrolyte constituents) and 
three-dimensional chemical surroundings (polymers, metal organic frameworks 
(MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs)). 
The use of carbon dioxide as a building block in organic synthesis from an 
industrial perspective was demonstrated [115]. 
The utilization of bases such as KOtBu, Cs2CO3, aluminum-based Lewis acids, 
and transition metals, as a building block in an organic synthesis from an industrial 
perspective to promote C–H carboxylation was reported [115]. According to recently 
signiﬁcant results in the process improvements with respect to synthetic scope,

yields, and green credentials were achieved. At temperature 200–350 °C, molten 
salts containing caesium or potassium cations enable carbonate ions to deprotonate 
very weakly acidic C–H bonds (pKa > 40), generating carbon-centered nucleophiles. 
The latter reacts with CO2 to form carboxylates [116]. In particular, C–H carboxyla-
tion is followed by protonation to convert 2-furoic acid into furan-2,5-dicarboxylic 
acid (FDCA) 
which was used for the synthesis of polyethylene furandicarboxylate. 
It was shown that intermediate-temperature (200–350 °C) molten salts containing 
caesium or potassium cations enable carbonate ions (CO3 2−) that can deprotonate 
very weakly acidic C–H bonds (pKa > 40), generating carbon-centered nucleophiles 
that react with CO2 to form carboxylates [116]. As an example, C–H carboxylation 
is followed by protonation to convert 2-furoic acid

into furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. Since 2-furoic acid can be made from lignocellu-
lose, CO3 2−-promoted C–H carboxylation thus reveals a way to transform inedible 
biomass and CO2 into a valuable feedstock chemical. 
A strategy based on a monolithic nanoporous silver-based membrane electro-
catalyst (npm-Ag) to increase the density of active sites was developed [120]. The 
effective thickness of the catalyst was improved from tens of nanometers to several 
micrometers. The npm-Ag showed selective reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpo-
tentials (ca. 80%@40 mV, ca. 100%@90–290 mV). Combined with a NiFe-based 
O2-evolving anode, a stable CO2-reducing photosynthetic system with an ηSTF of 
ca. 20.1% was active for 28 h in the absence of a DC/DC converter A DC-to-DC 
converter is an electronic circuit or electromechanical device that converts a source 
of direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another. 
A 3D mass transport model utilizing the accurate electrode geometry to calculate 
local concentration distributions of CO2(aq), OH−, HCO3−, and CO3 2− was designed 
[121]. The model based on Butler–Volmer correlations which described how the 
electrical current through an electrode depends on the voltage difference between 
the electrode and the bulk electrolyte for an unimolecular redox reaction, considered 
that both a cathodic and an anodic reaction occur on the same electrode. The CO 
evolution reaction with a proportional dependency on the carbonate concentration 
was also observed. The developed design showed high electrode roughness per ﬁlm 
thickness, which translated to smaller pore size and allowed to increase the CO 
selectivity. 
An example of a nonaqueous ﬂow cell electrolyzer with [Ni(cyclam)]2+ as the 
homogeneous electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction was presented [122]. Using ferrocene 
as a sacriﬁcial electron donor and ammonium salts as both electrolyte and proton 
donor, efﬁcient catalytic CO2 reduction was achieved. The design showed high selec-
tivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO (> 80%) and reached high current densities 
with a graphite felt working electrode (up to 50 mA cm–2 with 0.5 M proton donor in 
MeCN solution), producing > 40 mL h–1 of CO, continuous process. By taking advan-
tage of the high solubility of CO2 and CH4 at low temperature, the electrochemical 
conversion of these gases in aqueous media down to – 40 °C was performed [123]. 
Speciﬁcally, the use of brines (a high-concentration solution of a salt in water) elec-
trolytes was shown to be an efﬁcient route to perform electrochemistry experiments 
at low temperatures. Immobilized CO2 reduction enzymes—such as formate dehy-
drogenase—can operate with high turnover and selectivity at a minimal overpotential 
and are therefore effective model catalysts [124]. Through the coimmobilization of 
carbonic anhydrase on thin indium oxide, the effect of CO2 hydration on the local 
environment and performance of a range of disparate CO2 reduction systems from the 
enzymatic to heterogeneous systems was achieved. The experiments indicated that 
the coimmobilization of carbonic anhydrase increases the kinetics of CO2 hydration 
at the electrode.

Modeling Nonhemin Iron Proteins 
and Enzymes 
Abstract Iron–sulfur clusters occur in many biological systems, often as compo-
nents of electron transfer proteins and as the H-cluster in hydrogenase and the P-
cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase. This chapter describes signiﬁcant progress 
made in synthetical, compositional and functional aspects of the nitrogenase-like 
clusters through the recent decades. New synthesized clusters were found to react 
with dihydrogen and proton mimicking the hydrogenase reaction S (H2 + Aox → 2H+ 
+ Ared and 2H+ + Dred → H2 + Dox). Number of synthetic rhombic and cuboidal 
clusters could convert N2 to hydrazine and ammonium modeling the nitrogenase 
reaction. As an example of four electron mechanism of dinitrogen reduction, four 
nuclear complex V(II)-pyrocatechol (V(II) 4) was utilized in a homogeneous reaction 
V(II) 4N2 + V(II) 4 + 8H+ → 8V(III) + 2NH3 + H2O. The Chatt Cycle, a hypothetical 
model for the mechanism of nitrogenase action at the atomic level based upon reac-
tions of molybdenum compounds and scheme of the multi-stage nitrogenase process 
were considered. 
11.1 
Iron–Sulfur Clusters 
Iron–sulfur clusters occur in many biological systems, often as components of 
electron transfer proteins and are proved to be the catalysts for the generation of 
biologically relevant molecules such as ammonia and hydrogen [1–20]. Versatile 
structural and chemical characteristics biological Fe/S clusters have allowed their 
widespread use in virtually all living organisms. In nature, Fe–S clusters are struc-
tured in three main shapes: rhombic [Fe2S2] clusters, cuboidal [Fe3S4] clusters, and 
cuboidal [Fe4S4] clusters (Fig. 11.1) [8, 9]. Other more complex clusters exist, such 
as the H-cluster in hydrogenase and the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitroge-
nase. Fe–S clusters have been widely investigated speciﬁcally for electron transfer, 
catalysis, sulfur donation, and sensing (Fig. 11.2).
The paper [9] provided an overview of Fe–S clusters to highlight the growing 
versatile uses of these compounds. The discussion was divided into sections that 
describe the structure–function relationship of Fe–S clusters in ﬁve research areas:

respectively. Bonds within the cluster are shown as sticks, and bonds from Fe atoms to their

separately. Of particular interest are mimic clusters with the corresponding nitroge-
nase and hydrogenase catalytic activity. Synthetic catalysts are compared by their 
turnover frequencies (TOF) and turnover numbers (TON) are presented in Fig. 11.2.
11.2 
Nitrogenase Chemical Models 
Of particular interest are mimic clusters with the corresponding nitrogenase and 
hydrogenase catalytic activity. The process of assimilation of atmospheric nitrogen by 
microorganisms was known since 1838. Involvement of these molecules in a chemical 
reaction under mild conditions seemed to be disagreed with traditional theoretical 
considerations and experimental evidence of the extraordinary chemical inertness 
of dinitrogen. Since the discovery of discrete iron–sulfur metalloclusters within the 
nitrogenase MoFe protein, synthetic inorganic chemists have sought to reproduce 
the structural features of these clusters in order to understand how they facilitate the 
binding, activation and hydrogenation of N2. Through the recent decades, signif-
icant progress has been made to synthetically replicate certain compositional and 
functional aspects of the nitrogenase-like clusters [1–50]. Beyond approximating 
the architectures of nitrogenase clusters with synthetic models, research efforts have 
also focused on reproducing nitrogenase functionality, i.e., substrate binding, activa-
tion, and hydrogenation. Although much work remains to generate synthetic iron– 
sulfur clusters that can reduce N2 to NH3 to reach the level of biological ﬁxation of 
atmospheric nitrogen. 
The mechanism of reducing N2 to NH3 by nitrogenase has been be modeled in 
work [51]. The Fe-protein has a single [4Fe4S] cluster that bridges its two subunits, 
one of which has one binding site that is the only known reductant of the MoFe-
protein [51]. In this paper, the literature on alternative, available, and sustainable NH3 
production processes in terms of the scientiﬁc aspects of the spatial structures of nitro-
genase metalloclusters, the mechanism of reducing N2 to NH3 catalyzed by nitroge-
nase, the synthetic analogues of nitrogenase metalloclusters, and the opportunities 
for continued research were reviewed. 
Transition metal dinitrogen chemistry began in 1965 with the discovery of a 
complex [Ru (NH3)5(N2)]2+, which was prepared by treating Ru salts with hydrazine 
[31]. An unstable binuclear titanium complex with molecular nitrogen has been 
isolated at low temperatures and its composition has been determined [32]. The ﬁrst 
break through problem of extraordinary stability of N2 was made in the pioneering 
work of Volpin and Shur [33, 34]. These authors showed the ﬁrst reactions of dini-
trogen reduction by strong reducing agents such as Al–AlBr3, LiAlH4–AlBr3 in 
aprotic media in the presence of transition metals [33, 34]. In the 1970s, on the basis 
of the concept of the elementary multielectron mechanism of dinitrogen reduction 
in polynuclear transition metal complexes, reduction of dinitrogen to hydrazine and 
ammonia in protic media (methanol, water) involving relative weak reducing agents 
was demonstrated [25, 38–40]. The ﬁrst systems discovered were heterogeneous and 
included metal hydroxides Mo(OH)3–Ti(OH)3 or V(OH)2–Mg(OH)2, which can be

The authors suggested that the vanadium four-nuclear complex reduces dinitrogen 
by the four-electron mechanism. Later, detailed analysis of the reduction of dinitrogen 
in solution catalyzed by the V(II)-pyrocatechol was performed [41]. The hyperﬁne 
structure of the EPR spectrum of the complex was explained as a consequence of 
strong exchange interactions. Conclusions were reached on the tetranuclear character 
of the active complex of the centrosymmetric structure with the romboid disposition 
of the vanadium atoms. A hydrazine derivative and hydrogen were shown to be 
formed in the coordination sphere of tetramers, while ammonia is formed in the 
coordination sphere of an octamer. 
The Chatt Cycle is a hypothetical model for the mechanism of nitrogenase action 
at the atomic level and is based upon reactions of certain well-deﬁned molyb-
denum compounds (Fig. 11.3) [20, 26, 43]. Chatt’s team established N2 binding 
and activation at Mo (and W) and showed that the coordinated N2 ligand could be 
protonated to release NH3 (and hydrazine) in variable yield (as high as 90% for 
W(PMe2Ph)4(N2)2 with H2SO4 [43]. Protonation of an M(NHNH2) or M(NH2NH2) 
intermediate lead to release hydrazine or ammonia. On the basis of the classic Chatt-
type bis(dinitrogen) Mo/W complexes containing diphosphine coligands (either of 
two or more different ligands in a compound) the ﬁrst mechanism for the transition 
metal-mediated conversion of N2 to NH3 was formulated.

was found to be the ﬁrst Chatt-type complex with one coordination site that catalyti-
cally converts N2 to ammonia (26 equivalents) and the corresponding catalytic cycle 
follows a mononuclear pathway [25, 26]. Proton and electron transfer to N2 are 
mediated by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reagent SmI2/H2O as proto-
nating agent and strong reductant. Three structurally related Mo-N2 complexes with 
pentaphosphine 
environment have been investigated as catalysts for the conversion of N2 to NH3, 
using SmI2 as a strong reductant [25, 26]. Only the complex [Mo(N2)(P2 MePP2 Ph)]

was found to be catalytically active, exhibiting the highest activation of N2 and 
the pentadentate tetrapodal (pentapod) coordination. Protonation of the dini-
trogen complex 3 leads to the hydrazido(2−) complex 4 which was isolated 
and spectroscopically characterized. In the Chatt scheme, binuclear complex of 
molybdenum 
can serve as a catalysis, as well as mononuclear complexes with one N2 
or complex with two N2. 
Several Fe catalysts for N2-to-NH3 conversion that operate at low temperature (− 
78 °C) and atmospheric pressure while relying on a very strong reductant (KC8) and 
acid ([H(OEt2)2][BArF 4]) were designed [36]. It was shown that original catalyst 
system, P3 BFe, when employing a combination of reductant (Cp*2Co) and acid 
([Ph2NH2][OTf] or [PhNH3][OTf]), achieved efﬁciency for NH3 formation (up to 
72% for e– delivery) and a high turnover number for a synthetic molecular Fe catalyst 
(84 equivalents of NH3 per Fe site) [36]. The results of the study are presented in 
Figs. 11.4 and 11.5.
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction in the presence of metal–sulfur clusters has 
been investigated [42]. The reduced species were electrochemically generated 
by controlled potential electrolysis of homo and heterometallic cubane clusters 
[Fe4S4(SPh)4]2− and [{MoFe3S4(SPh)3}2(μSPh)3]3−, and then tested the N2-ﬁxation 
reactions. A report [44] suggested that solutions containing clusters such as 
[Fe4S4(SPh)4]2 and [Mo2Fe6S8(SPh)9]3 could convert N2 to NH3 with very low 
rates and yields of these reactions. Reactivity studies of clusters containing the 
MFe3S4 cores (M = Mo, V) with catecholate, multicarboxylate, or dimethylfor-
mamide ligands coordinated to the Mo (or V) atoms, and Cl ligands coordinated to 
the Fe atoms have been carried out [10]. The studies showed that the M/Fe/S single 
cubane clusters are effective catalysts in the reduction of nitrogenase substrates such

as hydrazine, acetylene giving ammonia, ethylene and dihydrogen, respectively. The 
same molecules did not activate or catalyze the reduction of dinitrogen. A study [45] 
was conducted to elucidate the mechanism of FeMo-cofactor catalytic activity in 
non-enzymic conditions and to compare its catalytic behavior with that of the nitro-
genase. The kinetics were investigated of C2H2 reduction by multielectron donors, 
Zn and Eu amalgams, catalyzed by isolated FeMo-cofactor. Inhibition of this process 
by CO was also examined. Results indicated that the FeMo-cofactor can realize of 
some of its functions without the protein. 
Complex [IPTN3N]Mo(N2) (MoN2) ([HIPTN3N]3− = [(HIPTNCH2CH2)3N]3− 
where HIPT = 3,5-(2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2)2C6H3) was found to react with dihydrogen 
slowly (days) at 22 °C to yield [HIPTN3N]MoH2 (MoH2) [11]. The following 
results were reported: (1) MoN2, MoNH3, and MoH2 are interconverted rapidly 
in the presence of H2, N2, and NH3 (Fig. 11.6); (2) The process runs with MoH2 as a 
catalyst and is competent for reduction of N2 with protons and electrons under stan-
dard conditions: and (3) Reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia in the presence of 32 
equivalents of added hydrogen (vs. Mo) is not catalytic, consistent with dihydrogen 
being an inhibitor of dinitrogen reduction. Suggested catalytic N2RR cycle depicting

A series of nitrogenase-mimicking complexes have been synthesized and 
studied by Peters’ group [46]. It was reported that a tris-(isopropylphosphino(o-

The process included the following steps: (1) The P3 B ligand reacts with FeBr2 in

unit within a target molecule that represents a potential starting reagent in the retroac-
tive synthesis of that target molecule); (2) The complex is reduced by stoichiometric 
sodium naphthalenide 
to give the Fe(N2) complex (vNN = 2011 cm−1); (3) Reaction with excess sodium 
naphthalenide led to formation of the anionic Fe(N2) complex (νNN = 1877 cm−1); 
(4) Encapsulation of the sodium with 12-crown-4 afforded a separated ion pair (νNN 
= 1918 cm−1); and (5) Activating π-accepting ligands, (P3 B)Fe which is capable 
of stabilizing π-donating imido ligands occurs. 
In 2011, Nishibayashi and co-workers introduced a dinuclear molybdenum system 
as a N2 ﬁxation (pre)catalyst [47]. Speciﬁcally, a PNP-based (PNP = 2,6-bis(di-tert-
butylphosphinomethyl)pyridine) complex (PNP)MoCl3 
was prepared and reduced to the corresponding dinitrogen Mo(0) complex, 
[(PNP)Mo(N2)2]2(μ-N2), through reaction with a strong reductant (NaHg amalgam). 
In 2017, the same group proposed that a reactive terminal (PNP)Mo(N) could be 
formed via cleavage of a bridging dinitrogen unit, thus circumventing the formation 
of early protonation intermediates such as diazenido, hydrazido, and hydrazidium 
[7, 8]. Use of (PNP)Mo(I)3 as a precursor that afforded access to (PNP)Mo(N)(I) 
following reduction by Cp*2Co. PCP-type pincer ligands, 
comprising of both N-heterocyclic carbene and diphosphine donors, have also been 
explored in an effort to evaluate N2RR catalysis performance [7, 8]. 
The ﬁrst example of the Fe-catalyzed transformation of N2 into N(SiMe3)3 I 
under ambient conditions was reported [48]. The Fe-catalyzed reduction of N2 into 1 
under ambient conditions, where up to 34 equivalents of 1 occurred. In this reaction 
system, Fe complexes such as [Fe(CO)5] and ferrocenes have been found to work

as effective catalysts. With the aid of density-functional-theory calculations, a plau-
sible reaction pathway was proposed, where Fe(II)-N2 complex bearing two Me(3)Si 
groups as ancillary ligands has an important role as a key reactive intermediate. A 
tris(phosphine)borane-supported iron complex that catalyzes the reduction of N2 to 
NH3 under mild conditions was synthesized [49]. In the complex, more than 40% of 
the proton and reducing equivalents are delivered to N2. The results indicated that a 
single iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates gener-
ated during catalytic NH3 formation and geometric tunability at iron. For example, 
to explore the potential of the iron catalyst 2 
a range of different proton sources (HCl, HOTf, HBArF 4 · 2Et2O, [LutH]BArF 4) and 
electron sources from strong reductant (Na/Hg, KC8, CoCp*2, CrCp*2, potassium) 
were used as indicated in (Figs. 11.7 and 11.8). The reaction can run in tetrahydro-
furan, dimethoxyethane, Et2O and toluene. Catalytic conversion of dinitrogen into 
ammonia yielding up to 8.5 equivalents NH3 per Fe was achieved with use of 58 
equiv. of KC8 and 48 equiv. of HBArF 4 · 2Et2O in diethyl ether at −78 °C [49]. 
The positively charged catalytic component of nitrogenase (NifDKFe) can work 
together with the reductase component of nitrogenase to reduce C2H2 in an ATP-
dependent reaction [15, 50]. It also acted as an enzyme on its own in the presence of 
EuIIDTPA (DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid).

The above system exhibited an ability to reduce CN− to C1–C3 hydrocarbons in 
an ATP-independent manner. As an example, a complex bis(thiolato)sulﬁdo-bridged 
double cubane [Mo2Fe6S9(SEt)8] of two  [MoFe3S4] units bridged via the Mo centers 
by inorganic sulﬁde and two thiolate ligands was synthesized [15]. In this work 
three main biosynthetic platforms facilitate nitrogenase M-cluster biosynthesis were 
designed, namely: (1) Assembly of mobilized Fe and S atoms on NifU to generate 
Fe2S2 and Fe4S4 building blocks; (2) Coupling of two Fe4S4-like clusters (K-cluster)

The ﬁrst example of N2 binding at a mononuclear iron site supported by only 
S and C donors was described [18]. The mechanism of N2 binding to the iron(II) 
tris(thiolate) 
(complex 2-K) was examined. The following main results of the research were 
reported: (1) The reduction of an iron(II) tris(thiolate) complex with 1 equivalent

of strong reductant KC8 leads to a thermally unstable intermediate; (2) A combina-
tion of Mössbauer, EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies identiﬁed the complex 
as a high-spin (S = 3/2) iron(I) species that maintains coordination of all three sulfur 
atoms; (3) DFT calculations suggested that this iron(I) intermediate has a pseudote-
trahedral geometry that resembles the S3C iron coordination environment of the belt 
iron sites in the resting state of the FeMoco; (4) Further reduction to the iron(0) 
oxidation level under argon causes the dissociation of one of the thiolate donors 
and gives an η6-arene species which reacts with N2; (5) Additional reduction of the 
iron(0)–N2 complex gives a reactive, formally iron(−1) species; (6) Treatment of 
the putative iron(−I) complex with weak acids gives low yields of ammonia and 
hydrazine, demonstrating that these nitrogenase products can be generated from N2 
at a synthetic Fe–S–C site; and (7) Catalytic N2 reduction was not observed. 
The formation of a nitrogenase-mimicking enzyme upon insertion of a negatively 
charged synthetic model complex ([Fe6S9(SEt)2]4−, designated Fe6 RHH, into the posi-
tively charged catalytic component of nitrogenase (NifDKapo) was observed [50]. 
The article provided a comprehensive review of the chemistry of M–S compounds 
related to the conversion of N2 and the structures/functions of the nitrogenase cofac-
tors. About 150 clusters have been considered. Three classes of M–S compounds 
described are: (1) Multinuclear M–S clusters structurally or functionally relevant 
to the nitrogenase cofactors; (2) Mono and dinuclear transition metal complexes 
supported by sulfur-containing ligands; and (3) Metal sulﬁde-based solid materials 
employed in the reduction of N2. 
In review [21], сomprehensive insights into synthetic nitrogen ﬁxation assisted by 
molecular catalysts under ambient or mild condition was described. Recent advances 
in the development of molecular catalysts for synthetic N2 ﬁxation under ambient or 
mild conditions were summarized, and potential directions for future research were 
discussed. The review focused on the advances on the catalytic conversion of N2 into 
NH3, N2H4, and silylamines mediated by molecular catalysts under ambient or mild 
conditions. Among them are catalytic conversion of N2 into NH3 or N2H4 mediated 
by Mo catalysts under ambient conditions without using H2O or with using H2O. 
Other catalytic systems (Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Ti, V, Re); and the catalytic conversion of 
N2 into silylamines were also considered. 
Recently it was shown that the Fe atoms in synthetic [Mo3S4Fe] cubes can 
capture a N2 molecule and catalyze N2 silylation to form N(SiMe3)3 under treat-
ment with excess sodium and trimethylsilyl chloride (Figs. 11.10 and 11.11) [22]. 
The treatment of the clusters with strong reductants (Potassium graphite, KC8 or 
sodium naphthalenide Na(C10H8) under N2 in tetrahydrofuran led to the formation 
of the corresponding N2 clusters. It was found that [Mo3S4Fe] dimer bridged by 
N2, [{Cp*3Mo3S4Fe}2(µ-N2)]2− and monomers each bearing a terminal N2 ligand. 
Catalytic reduction of N2 into N(SiMe3)3 promoted by [Mo3S4Fe] clusters occurred 
with high yield. The results demonstrated the N2-reduction capability of Fe atoms 
in a sulfur-rich environment, which is reminiscent of the ability of FeMoco to bind 
and activate N2.

were discovered in the 1930s by Marjory Stephenson [51]. Since then synthetic 
chemistry has been used to prepare a number of similar mimics of hydrogenase 
subsites, but it has commonly failed to reproduce the natural enzymatic activities 
[51–79]. Synthesis of, free-standing analogue of the hydrogenase active cite may 
enable to develop useful electrocatalytic materials for a practical application, for 
example, the reversible hydrogen fuel cells. Structures of the active sites of the 
three types of hydrogenase enzymes are indicated in (Fig. 11.12) [53]. In [FeFe]-
hydrogenases, catalysis occurs at a unique diiron center (the [2Fe] subsite), which 
contains a bridging dithiolate ligand, three CO ligands and two CN(−) ligands. This 
[2Fe] subsite is ﬁrst assembled on a maturation enzyme, HydF, and then delivered 
to the apo-hydrogenase for activation.
11.3.2 
[Fe–Fe] Hydrogenase Models 
The enzyme [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA1) contains a unique 6-iron cofactor, the H-
cluster, that has unusual ligands to an Fe–Fe binuclear subcluster: CN−, CO, and an 
azadithiolate (adt) ligand that provides 2 S bridges between the 2 Fe atoms. HydF 
is a scaffold protein in [FeFe] hydrogenase H-cluster biosynthesis. A semisynthetic 
form of HydF was generated by loading it with a synthetic low-valent dinuclear Fe 
complex [61]. Employing the semisynthetic form of HydF and FTIR spectroscopy, 
it was veriﬁed that the pre-catalyst is truly a four CO species, and that transfer of the 
pre-catalyst from HydF to the hydrogenase enzyme resulted in the release of CO.

Combined FTIR and EPR study of the H-cluster assembly reaction revealed that the 
[4Fe4S] cluster presented in HydF is responsible for the binding of the pre-catalyst to 
HydF and directly involved in H-cluster assembly by acting as an electron acceptor in 
the reaction. According to a proposed mechanism of the reaction an electron transfer 
occurs during H-cluster assembly, resulting in an oxidation of the [2Fe] subsite with 
concomitant reduction of the [4Fe4S] cluster present on the HydF protein. 
Three synthetic mimics, containing different bridging dithiolate ligands,

and then transferred to apo-HydA1. Full activation of HydA1 was achieved when 
using the HydF hybrid protein containing the mimic with an azadithiolate bridge. 
According to work [52], the [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction runs in several steps 
[52]: (1) The dimeric Mj [Fe] hydrogenase binds of the second substrate methenyl-
tetrahydromethanopterin (methenyl-H4MPT+) 
to the open form of the enzyme; (2) The Fe-GP cofactor is activated and a hydrogen 
molecule binds to the open coordination site of the iron; (3) Methenyl-H4MPT+ 
binding triggers the breaking of the Fe–Hδ· · · Hδ+ –O (pyridinol oxygen) dihy-
drogen bond; (4) The hydrogen molecule is heterolytically cleaved; (5) The proton 
is transferred to the thiol of Cys176; and (6) The adjacent C14a carbocation of the 
methenylH4MPT+ accepts the hydride. 
It was reported that chitosan improves the efﬁciency and durability of a typical 
mimic of the diiron subsite of [FeFe]-hydrogenase for photocatalytic hydrogen evolu-
tion (Fig. 11.14). The turnover number of the self-assembling system increases ~ 
4000-fold compared with the same system in the absence of chitosan. The diiron 
subsite of [FeFe]-H2ases, [Fe2(CO)6(μ-adt)CH2C6H5] [μ-adt = N(CH2S)2] [27, 36], 
was selected as a catalyst. The present artiﬁcial system using chitosan-conﬁned envi-
ronment is reminiscent of the [Fe2S2] subcluster of natural [FeFe]-H2a. The assembly 
of the iron–sulfur framework of the active site of iron-only hydrogenase (the H-
cluster) was synthesized and its functions as an electrocatalyst for proton reduction 
were examined [69]. Through linking of a diiron subsite to a {4Fe4S} cluster, the 
ﬁrst synthesis of a metallosulfur cluster core involved in small-molecule catalysis 
was achieved.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from rhenium(I) complexes to [FeFe] hydro-
genase mimics in aqueous sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) micellar systems was 
investigated [71]. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in standard three-
electrode systems with a working electrode, counter electrode, and reference 
electrode. The working electrodes directly incorporate Fe–S functionalized mate-
rials. A common working electrode setup consists of a glassy carbon base mate-
rial with a spin-coated polymeric ﬁlm. To offer an access to photocatalytic H2, 
generation in an aqueous solution, the hydrophobic photosensitizers, Re(I)(4,4′-
dimethylbpy)(CO)3Br (1) or Re(I)(1,10-phenanthroline)(CO)3Br (2), and [FeFe] 
H2ases mimics, [Fe2(CO)6(μ-adt)CH2C6H5](3)or[Fe2(CO)6(μ-adt)C6H5](4)[μ-adt 
= N(CH2S)2], have been incorporated into sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 
micelle solution. Ascorbic acid was used as a sacriﬁcial electron donor and proton 
source. 
To give a complete model for the [FeFe]-hydrogenase, the function of the ferre-
doxins with the redox-active ligand Cp*Fe(C(5)Me(4)CH(2)PEt(2)) (FcP*) was 
examined combining acid–base, redox, and substrate binding functionalities [73]. 
FcP* was oxidized at mild potentials of a mimic of ferredoxin cofactors. The speciﬁc 
model, Fe(2) [(SCH(2))(2)NBn](CO)(3)(FcP*)(dppv) (1), contains the three func-
tional components of the active site: a reactive diiron cite, an amine proton relay

and a one-electron redox module was designed. A covalently linked photosen-
sitizer-catalytic center dyad Ps-Hy, consisting of two bis(2-phenylpyridine)(2,2ʹ-
bipyridine)iridium(iii) chromophores (Ps) and a diiron hydrogenase mimic (Hy) was 
constructed by using click reaction [65]. Click chemistry is a class of simple reac-
tions commonly used for joining two molecular entities of choice for example by 
joining small modular units. Ps-Hy was incorporated into K(+)-exchanged meso-
porous molecular sieve MCM-41 to form a composite (Ps-Hy@MCM-41). MCM-
41 is a synthetic mesoporous material with cylindrical pores suitable for catalytic 
cracking, separations, dye removal, and as an adsorbent. The photo catalytic activity 
of Ps-Hy@MCM-41 was found to be ∼ threefold higher when compared with that 
of Ps-Hy in the absence of MCM-41. The incorporation of Ps-Hy into MCM-41 
stabilizes the catalyst, and consequently, advances the photocatalysis. 
Terminal hydride complexes, as the diiron carbonyl models, containing azadithi-
olate, and the dithiolate cofactor [HN(CH2S)2]2−, (Fig. 11.15) were designed and 
examined [58]. The complex was prepared by alkylation of Fe2(SH)2(CO)6 with 
formaldehyde in the presence of ammonia (to give adtH derivatives) or amines 
(to give adtR derivatives). The crystal structure of the doubly protonated model 
[(term-H)Fe2(HadtH)(CO)2(dppv)2]2+ conﬁrmed the presence of both ammonium 
and terminal hydrido centers, which interact through a dihydrogen bond (dppv = cis-
C2H2(PPh2)2). The amine in the azadithiolate transfers protons to and from the iron. 
Both [(term-H)Fe2(HadtH)(CO)2(dppv)2]2+ and [(term-H)Fe2(adtH)(CO)2(dppv)2]+ 
were highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which 
was initiated by reduction of the diferrous center. This ﬁnding indicated inducing 
coupling of the protic ammonium center and the hydride ligand. Complex [(term-
H)Fe2(HadtH)(CO)2(dppv)2]2+ in CF3CO2H showed  k = 58,000 s−1 and overpo-
tential of 0.51 V. Figure 11.15 illustrates similarity of active site of the [FeFe]-
Hydrogenase and given synthetic model. 
It was reported that the biomimetic [Fe2(adt)(CO)4(CN)2](2−) (adt(2−) = 
azadithiolate) complex resembling the diiron sub-cluster was inserted in vitro into 
the apo-protein of [FeFe] hydrogenase from C. reinhardtii, which contains only

the [4Fe–4S] part of the H-cluster [59]. This process resulted in a fully active 
enzyme. Studies on the mixed valence Fe(I)Fe(II) state of the diiron sub-cluster of this 
hybrid protein were performed employing 15N and 13C isotope labeled CN− ligands, 
hyperﬁne sublevel correlation (HYSCORE), and electron-nuclear double resonance 
(ENDOR). Detailed selective ENDOR and HYSCORE experiments at multiple ﬁeld 
positions enabled to know the relative orientations of the nitrogen and carbon hyper-
ﬁne tensors. These ﬁnding were consistent with the crystal structure assuming a 
g-tensor orientation. To probe the inﬂuence of phosphine ligand substitution on the 
[2Fe2S] model, two new [FeFe]-hydrogenase model complexes with the phosphine 
ligands, PMe3 or P(CH3O)3, such as μ-(SCH(CH2CH3)CH2S)-Fe2(CO)5PMe31, and 
μ-(SCH(CH2CH3)CH2S)-Fe2(CO)5P(CH3O)3, were synthesized [60]. Conﬁrmation 
of structures was provided by FTIR, 1H NMR,  13C NMR,  31P NMR, elemental anal-
yses and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Experiments indicated that in the presence of 
acetic acid in CH3CN solution, the hydrogen evolution overpotentials of complexes 
1 and 2 were 0.91 V and 0.81 V, respectively. In addition, the electrocatalytic study 
showed the maximum charges for complexes 1 and 2 were 31.3 mC and 56.3 mC at 
− 2.30 V for 10 min, respectively, while complex 2 exhibited better electrocatalytic 
ability than complex 1. 
An iron-based catalyst covalently attached to silicon (Si) was constructed for 
the investigation of activity and electrochemical decomposition pathways of diiron 
hydrogenase enzyme mimics [64]. The employed catalyst, Fe2(CO)6(µ-S-C6H4-p-
OH)2 ([FeFe]), mimics the active sites of this enzyme. [FeFe] modiﬁcation improves 
the overpotential required to produce 10 mA cm−2 by 100 mV, with a hydrogen 
evolution rate of 2.31 × 10−5 mol h−1 cm−2 (− 0.78 V vs. RHE). Structural rear-
rangement transpires within 1 h of electrolysis, where Fe–S bond dissociates at the 
catalytic center, resulted in an aromatic linkage modiﬁed Si interface. The [FeFe] 
hydrogenase from C. reinhardtii (CrHydA1) containing a propane-1,3-dithiolate 
(PDT) ligand instead of the native 2-azapropane-1,3-dithiolate (ADT) ligand was 
investigated using time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy [62]. In this experi-
ment, the natural redox-active dithiolene ligand ADT, which contains a nitrogen as 
the bridgehead atom, was exchanged for a propane-1,3-dithiolate (PDT) ligand. The 
following experimental results were reported: (1) The PDT substitution presumably 
prevented protonation of the bridging ligand in [2Fe]H; (2) Electron transfer from 
[4Fe–4S]H to [2Fe]H, trapping the H-cluster in a one-electron reduced state occurred; 
(3) This effect abolished the catalysis and allowed to monitor the ﬁrst reduction of 
[4Fe–4S]H going from the oxidized (Hox) state to the one-electron reduced (Hred) 
state; (3) The PDT modiﬁcation does not affect the electron transfer step to [4Fe– 
4S]H but prevents the enzyme from proceeding further through the catalytic cycle; 
(4) The rate of the ﬁrst electron transfer step is independent of the pH, supporting 
a simple electron transfer rather than a proton-coupled event; (5) A proton-coupled 
electronic rearrangement (PCER) took place, basing on the fact that the Hred and 
HredH+ states, can vary their populations with pH; (6) Hred can be prevalent at high 
pH; (7) HredH+ can be prevalent at low pH; (8) Catalytically important protonation 
occurs at the nitrogen of the ADT bridge, leading to PCER of the H-cluster to give

a protonated, one-electron reduced state (HredH+); and (9) This state can accept an 
additional electron on [4Fe–4S]. 
Two series of silicon-supported [(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] (R  = p-OHC6H4, 3, and 
(CH2)2OH, 4a, and (CH2)5OH, 4b)] hydrogenase mimics, as well as octamethyl-
silsesquioxane (POSS)-based nanostructures containing eight methylsilsesquioxane 
(POSS)-based and nanostructures containing eight [(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] 
moieties, have been prepared and characterized [63]. The following chemical 
processes were observed: (1) Reaction of the corresponding silyl and silyloxy 
chlorides and compounds 3 and 4 P; (2) NNCuAAC reaction between propargyl 
derivatives of silyl and silyloxy chlorides and azide; (3) Efﬁcient cycloaddition 
between POSS-derived azide; and (4) Formation [(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] (R  = 
alkyne) complexes, leading to POSS-based nanostructures containing eight [(μ-
SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] units. All of the complexes prepared through this work were 
characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemistry methods, that is: (1) The electro-
chemistry of the linear siloxanes proceeded with a reduction wave around − 1.7 V, 
which is characteristic of these [(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] entities; (2) Complexes 
lacking 1,2,3-triazole moieties were electrochemically stable in the presence of acetic 
acid (AcOH), showing a strong electrocatalytic wave at − 2.2 V; and (3) Complexes 
having the 1,2,3-triazole ring were electrocatalytically active in the wave at− 2.2 V. In 
addition, POSS-[(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] derivatives indicated an irreversible reduc-
tion event and were deposited in the electrode. Experiments employing Si NMR and 
using H addition indicated that the integrity of the silicon cage is not affected by time 
or acetic acid experiments. Suggested synthetic protocols and electrochemical studies 
were applied in the design of silicon-supported [(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] mimics. 
The synthesis of hydrogenase mimics has been based on the preparation of 
complexes having [(μ-SCH2)2NRFe2(CO)6] [63]: 
or [Fe2(μ-bdt)R(CO)6] (bdt = benzene-1,2-dithiolate) cores.

Inclusion of mimics of [FeFe]-hydrogenases into TiO2 surfaces, nanotubes 
nanocrystals, metaorganic frameworks, dendrimers, polymers, sodium dodecyl 
sulfate micellar systems, nanocrystals, and other supramolecular assemblies have 
been carried out [63]. And references therein of experiments showed that the silicon 
photoelectrode interface having covalently bonded [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics 
photoelectrochemically generate hydrogen. Several other silica-based heterogeneous 
systems can be used to immobilize [2Fe2S], photosensitizer-[2Fe2S], and other diiron 
complexes. In all cases, an improvement in the stability of the complexes and in their 
catalytic activity was achieved. 
Novel biomimetic model of [FeFe]-hydrogenase prepared using the reaction of 
ferrocenyl α-thienyl thioketone with Fe3(CO)12 was introduced [68]. Heating of 
Fe3(CO)12 with three mol-equivalents of ferrocenyl α-thienyl thioketone in boiling 
THF for 4 h led to a mixture of amounts of the ortho-metalated complex 2 and also 
formed complex 3 (Fig. 11.16). 
The inﬂuence of the substitution pattern in ferrocenyl α-thienyl thioketone used 
as a proligand in complexation reactions with Fe3(CO)12 was examined. Two new 
sulfur–iron complexes, considered [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics, were characterized 
by spectroscopic techniques (1H, 13C{1H} NMR, IR, MS), cyclic voltammetry 
elemental analysis and X-ray single crystal diffraction methods. The analysis of 
cyclic voltammograms of both complexes indicated that 2 reacts via two successive 
one-electron processes (EE mechanism) and in the case of 3, transfer of two electrons 
in a single step via the ECE mechanism. ECE is an electrolysis reaction with any 
electrode steps being labeled E and any chemical steps labeled C:

The performed measurements demonstrated that both complexes can catalyze the 
reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen H2. 
11.3.3 
Nickel–Iron and Iron Hydrogenases 
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of dihydrogen. The [NiFe] 
hydrogenase contains several metal centers, including the bimetallic Ni–Fe active 
site, iron–sulfur clusters and a Mg(2+) ion and the Ni–Fe active site is located in the 
inner part of the protein molecule (Fig. 11.12) [74, 75]. The crystal structure of the 
membrane-associated [NiFe] hydrogenase from Allochromatium vinosum has been 
determined to 2.1 Å resolution. The bimetallic [NiFe] active site is located in the 
large subunit of the heterodimer and possesses three diatomic non-protein ligands 
coordinated to the Fe (two CN(−), one CO). Ni is bound to the protein backbone 
via four cysteine thiolates; two of them also bridge the two metals. The additional 
metal site located in the large subunit appears to be an Mg2+ ion. The catalytic 
reaction route consists of an electron transfer pathway, a proton transfer pathway, 
and a gas-access channel [76]. The mechanism for H2 cleavage in NiFe-hydrogenase 
has been reinvestigated with large models using hybrid DFT by itself, or in a QM/ 
MM scheme following the ONIOM approach. In the suggested mechanism the key 
stages are: heterolytic H2 cleavage occurs as an initial step to generate a complex 
with nickel in oxidation state Ni(I); and in the following cycles, H2 is cleaved on 
nickel using an oxidative addition mechanism with a lower barrier. 
Studies on the iron(II)–thiolate cyanocarbonyls, the mononuclear/dinuclear 
nickel(III)–thiolate complexes and the mononuclear nickel(II)–thiolate complexes 
with pendant thiol have led to the results related to the structure, reactivity and 
spectroscopic properties of the iron and nickel centers of the active site of [NiFe]/ 
[Fe] hydrogenases [77]. Separate sections are devoted to a detailed description of 
the following topics related to the chemical compounds which model the struc-
ture and mechanism of [NiFe] hydrogenase structure and activity: (1) Iron–thiolate 
complexes with mixed CO/CN− ligands mimic the iron part of [NiFe]/[Fe] hydro-
genases; (2) Dinuclear iron(II)–cyanocarbonyl complexes with bridging ethylthio-
lates were prepared; and (3) Nickel–thiolate complexes (a) heterobimetallic nickel– 
iron complexes, (b) mononuclear nickel(II) carbonyl complexes, (c) mononuclear 
nickel(II)–thiolate complexes with pendant thiol, (d) mononuclear nickel(III)– 
thiolate complexes; and dinuclear nickel–thiolate complexes were synthetized.

The [NiFe]-hydrogenase model complex NiFe(pdt)(dppe)(CO)3 (1) (pdt = 1,3-
propanedithiolate) has been synthesized and characterized [76]. One CO ligand 
in [1H]BF4 was substituted by organophosphorus ligands to afford the substituted 
derivatives [HNiFe(pdt)(dppe)(PR3)(CO)2]BF4, where PR3 = P(OPh)3 ([2H]BF4); 
PPh3 ([3H]BF4); PPh2Py ([4H]BF4, where Py = 2-pyridyl). In MeCN solution, 
complex 3, which was prepared by deprotonation of [3H]BF4 with NaOMe, is about 
104 stronger base than is 1. X-ray crystallographic analysis of [3H]BF4 revealed a 
highly unsymmetrical bridging hydride for which the Fe–H bond being 0.40 Å shorter 
than the Ni–H distance. Experiments also indicated that: (1) Complexes [2H]BF4, 
[3H]BF4, and [4H]BF4 underwent a one-electron reductions near − 1.46 V versus 
Fc0/+; (2) The dependence of ic/ip on the concentration of the acid showed that H2 
evolution entails protonation of a reduced hydride; (3) For [2H]+, [3H]+, and [4H]+, 
the acid-independent rate constants are 50–75 s−1; (4) For [2H]+ and [3H]+, the over-
potentials for H2 evolution were estimated to be 430 mV; (5) The overpotential for 
the N-protonated pyridinium complex [4H2]2+ was found to be 260 mV; and (6) On 
the basis of their values for its pKa and redox potentials, norm al upper Delta upper G Subscript upper H Sub Superscript dot and norm al upper Delta upper G Subscript upper H Sub Superscript minus are 57 and 
79 kcal/mol for [1H]+ and [1]2+, respectively. The mechanism of H2 evolution was 
proposed to follow an ECEC sequence, where E and C correspond to one-electron 
reductions and protonation, respectively. 
[Fe]-hydrogenase, which contains a unique iron cofactor (FeGP cofactor), 
catalyzes 
the 
reversible 
hydrogenation 
of 
methenyltetrahydrometanopterin 
(methenyl-H4MPT+) with H2 to methylene-H4MPT iron-chromophore [78]. Circular 
dichroism (CD) data indicated the binding of methenyl/methylene-H4MPT induces 
a conformational change that closes the active site cleft of [Fe]-hydrogenase to form 
the intact active site. A crystal structure of [Fe]-hydrogenase at 1.75 Å resolution, 
showing a mononuclear iron coordinated by the sulfur of cysteine 176, two carbon 
monoxide molecules, and the sp2-hybridized nitrogen of a 2-pyridinol compound 
with back-bonding properties was obtained in work [79]. The three-dimensional 
arrangement of the ligands was found to be similar to that of thiolate, CO, and 
cyanide ligated to the low-spin iron in binuclear [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases, 
although the CO and cyanide ligands are not found in any other metalloenzyme. In 
study [57], the electronic and molecular structure of the iron center by X-ray absorp-
tion spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of [Fe]-hydrogenase from Methanocaldococcus 
jannashii and ﬁve model complexes (Fe(ethanedithiolate)(CO)2(PMe3)2, [K(18-
crown-6)]2[Fe(CN)2(CO)3], K[Fe(CN)(CO)4], K3[Fe(III)(CN)6], K4[Fe(II)(CN)6]) 
were designed and examined. The experiment indicated that: (1) The different 
electron donors have a strong inﬂuence on the iron absorption K-edge energy 
position, which is used to determine the metal oxidation state; (2) The K-edges of 
Fe(II) complexes, achieved with low-spin ferrous thiolates, are consistent with a 
ferrous center in the [Fe]-hydrogenase; and (3) The metal geometry also strongly 
inﬂuences the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). In addition, using in 
silico simulation, it was able to reproduce the main features of the XANES spectra 
and describe the effects of individual donor contributions on the spectra.

Abstract In hydroxylation reactions: 2R3C–H + O2right arrow2R3C–OH and R3C–H + 
O2 + 2e– + 2H+ right arrowR3C–OH + H2O a substrate C–H bond is converted to an 
alcohol group. A mechanism of abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate by a 
high active intermediate, an iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin radical intermediate (Compound 
I) (rebound mechanism) was proposed for cytochrome P450. A similar rebound 
mechanism was suggested for the methane monooxygenase (MMO). The large 
number of complexes mimicking cytochromes P450 including iron protoporphyrin 
IX were synthesized and their hydroxylation activity was tested. To avoid prob-
lems associated with indirect pathway for conversion methane to methanol, which 
widely used in chemical industry using 1000 °C and elevated pressure, numerous 
complexes mimicking the structure and enzymatic activity of MMO were prepared. 
Among them are the following compounds: (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)diiron (III) core 
[Fe2(O)(OH)(6TLA)2(ClO4)3], [Fe2(O)2(6TLA)2(ClO4)2] (II), a (-1,2-peroxo)bis(-
carboxylato)diiron(III). According to the Shilov Cycle, CH4 oxidation in mild condi-
tion is catalyzed by PtCl2 in an aqueous solution, where PtCl6 2− acts as the ultimate 
oxidizing agent. Artiﬁcial hydrolases was utilized to catalyze the cleavage a number 
of substrates such as p-nitrophenyl acetate, glycerophospholipids, the phosphodi-
ester bond of DNA, phosphate diester model of RNA, RNA model substrate 2-
hydroxypropyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (HPNP). As a successful modeling nature’s 
catalytic triad, consisting of a hydroxyl group of a serine residue, an imidazole group 
of a histidine residue, and a carboxyl group of an aspartic acid, the miniature organic 
model of chymotrypsin, was designed on the basis of cyclodextrin. A water-soluble 
fullerene functionalized with carboxylic acid moieties, C60-1, mono- and binuclear 
metalloenzymes, carbon-based nanozymes, peptide-based compounds are examples 
of successful mimicry of hydrolases.

are facilitated by enzymes hydroxylases [1–6]. A substrate C–H bond is converted 
to an alcohol by insertion of an oxygen atom into a C–H bond. The driving force 
for the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water is 80 kcal mol–1, thus, showing 
large favorable enthalpic change. Nevertheless, the one-electron reduction of 3O2 to 
the superoxide ion is endergonic by 7.8 kcal mol–1 and therefore thermodynamically 
forbidden in ambient biological conditions (see also Eq. 12.5). In contrast, as follows 
from Eq. (12.4), the two-electron reduction of the oxygen molecule is energetically 
favorable.

Consequently, two-electron reduction of complexed O2 can lead to the formation 
of a peroxide intermediate, which in turn generates a highly active an iron(IV)-oxo 
porphyrin radical intermediate (Compound I) capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom 
from the substrate (rebound mechanism Figs. 12.1 and 12.2). A similar mechanism 
with the formation of a high active intermediate with [FeIV 2(μ-O)2] diamond core 
was proposed for the methane monooxygenase (MMO)
A survey on the range of O2 activation processes mediated by heme proteins and 
model compounds with a focus on recent progress in the characterization and reac-
tivity of important iron–oxygen intermediates was reported [20]. Along this way, a 
number of aspects in this area have been presented and analyzed in detail: (1) Repre-
sentative reactions initiated by these reactive intermediates; (2) The fundamental 
mechanistic features of these transformations; and (3) The recent developments in 
biocatalysis for nonnatural chemistries and the advantages of radical chemistry in 
organic synthesis. It was stressed that new enzymatic and synthetic transformations 
will emerge based on the radical processes mediated by metalloproteins and their 
synthetic analogs. Examples of typical reactions illustrating the diverse and wide 
possibilities of cytochrome models were described. 
It is obvious that the creation of effective models of hydroxylases should take 
into account the principal stages of enzymatic processes outlined above, including 
the two-electron reduction of O2 and the rebound mechanism. This section brieﬂy

12.1 Introduction

Fig. 12.1 Principal steps in the O2 activation and substrate (ROH) oxidation mechanisms used by 
cytochrome P450 (upper) and MMO (lower), along with schematic representations of the corre-
sponding key oxidizing species (shown in red). In the cytochrome P450 catalytic cycle, binding of 
substrate to the resting enzyme triggers the reduction of the FeIII center of the heme cofactor to the 
reactive FeII state, which binds and activates O2 to generate a high-valent iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin 
radical intermediate that is capable of oxidizing a wide range of organic substrates (a notable 
exception being methane, the native substrate of MMO). In the MMO catalytic cycle, the diiron(III) 
cluster of the resting enzyme is reduced by two electrons to yield the reactive diiron(II) species, 
which binds O2 to generate a peroxodiiron(III) intermediate. Further reduction of the O2 moiety 
in this species yields the oxodiiron(IV) key oxidizing intermediate (MMO-Q), which converts the 
substrate methane to methanol [2]. With permission from PNAS

Cytochrome P450 
The large number of studies have been performed during the last three decades 
both on cytochromes P450 themselves and on iron porphyrin models [2–28]. 
The synthesis of three successive generations of porphyrin ligands eventually led 
to metalloporphyrin catalysts more efﬁcient for oxygenation of substrate. Some 
examples of porphyrin metal porphyrin complexes of are presented in refer-
ences [3, 4]. Iron porphyrins derived from the heme: iron protoporphyrin IX,

catalytic cycle was formed by the reaction of iron(III) porphyrins with different 
monooxygen donors and used for the hydroxylation of hydrocarbons, epoxidation of 
oleﬁns, oxidation of heteroatoms, and the cleavage of C–C bonds in organic substrates 
[4].

According to the oxygen rebound mechanism (Figs. 12.1 and 12.2) suggested 
and established in a pioneering work of Groves and Van der Puy [5]. Stereospe-
ciﬁc aliphatic hydroxylation by iron-hydrogen peroxide occurs in wide range of 
oxygen- and heteroatom-transfer reactions. In this process, a high-valent metal-oxo 
species (Compound I) abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to generate a 
carbon-centered radical, which recombines with the hydroxometal intermediate with 
rate constants that can be in the nanosecond to picosecond regime. In addition to 
catalyzing C–O bond formation, it was found that high-valent metal-oxo porphyrins 
can directly catalyze C–H halogenations and pseudohalogenations, including chlo-
rination, bromination, and ﬂuorination. Review [6] recount the 40 years history of 
radical rebound mechanisms. The following aspects of this process were in the focus 
of the authors attention: (1) The mechanisms general features; (2) Key intermediates 
involved in the process; (3) The factors that affect the behavior of the initial caged 
radical pair; and (4) The lifetimes of the incipient substrate radicals. To illustrate how 
the behaviors of the radical pair [Fe Sup erscr ipt n minus 1 Baseline minus OH dot upper R] determine the eventual reaction 
outcome several representative examples of enzymatic C–H transformations were 
selected. 
In 1978, Groves et al. reported the ﬁrst catalytic alkane hydroxylation and alkene 
epoxidation catalyzed by a synthetic iron(III) porphyrin complex, Fe(TPP)Cl using 
an iodosylbenzene (PhIO) oxidant [7] and references within. In the reactions, alkenes 
and alkanes were oxidized to the corresponding epoxides and alcohols, respectively. 
The ﬁrst use of a chiral iron porphyrin to carry out asymmetric epoxidation was 
reported in 1983 by Groves and Myers. In 1980, Groves group ([7] and references 
within) reported the ﬁrst manganese porphyrin, (Mn(TPP)Cl), catalyzed hydro-
carbon oxidation reaction. In the study, oxidation of cyclohexane with iodosylben-
zene catalyzed by Mn(TPP)Cl gave mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexyl chloride 
in a total 70% yield. Oxidation of a radical clock substrate, norcarane, 
produced signiﬁcant amounts of radical rearranged products. The radical-clock 
compound itself reacts at a known rate, which provides a calibration for determining 
the rate of another reaction. 
The detection and kinetic characterization of a cytochrome P450 model OFeIV−4-
TMPyP]+ were carried out [8]. This compound aqueous solution showed reaction 
rates for C−H hydroxylations (Fig. 12.6) [8]. Stopped-ﬂow spectrophotometric

revealed the intermediate, typical of a porphyrin π-radical cation which was subse-
quently transformed into the OFeIV−4-TMPyP. Global analysis afforded a second-
order rate constant k1 = (1.59 ± 0.06) × 107 M−1 s−1 for the formation of 1 
followed by a ﬁrst-order decay with k2 = 8.8 ± 0.1 s−1. 1H and 13C NMR determined 
9-xanthydrol to be the major product (∼90% yield) of xanthene 
oxidation by 1. The following results were reported: (1) Electrospray ionization 
mass spectrometry carried out in 47.5% 18OH2 indicated 21% 18O incorporation; 
(2) Xanthene/xanthene-d2 showed a modest kinetic isotope effect, kH/kD = 2.1; (3) 
Xanthene hydroxylation by 1 occurred with a second-order rate constant k3 = (3.6 ± 
0.3) × 106 M−1 s−1 (Fig. 12.3); (4) Similar reactions of ﬂuorene-4-carboxylic acid 
and 4-isopropyl- and 4-ethylbenzoic acid gave high rates for C−H hydroxylation that 
correlated well with the scissile C−H bond energy, indicating a homolytic hydrogen 
abstraction transition; (5) The observed rate constants for C−H bond cleavage onto 
the Brønsted−Evans−Polanyi relationship for similar substrates were mapped; and 
5) The H−OFeIV−4-TMPyP bond dissociation energy was determined as ∼100 kcal 
mol–1. It was suggested that the high kinetic reactivity observed for 1 is result from 
a high porphyrin redox potential and spin-state-crossing phenomena. Spin crossover 
was referred to as spin transition or spin equilibrium behavior when the change in spin 
state usually involves interchange of low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) conﬁguration 
[2].
The ﬁrst data on iron porphyrins to mimic the Fe(III)OO−, Fe(III)OOH and iron– 
oxo intermediates of the P450 were published by Groves et al. [9]. The experiments 
showed the formation of a species, with proposed an oxo–ferryl porphyrin Π-cation 
radical structure, formed by the reaction of Fe(TMP)Cl with meta-chloroperbenzoic 
acid at − 78 °C for process:

The product exhibited spectral characteristics analogous to those of peroxidase 
compound I. Further studies on the reactions of iron(III)porphyrins with various 
oxygen atom donors such as peracids, iodosylarenes or O3, at low temperature, 
indicated the formation of porphyrin cation radical Fe(IV)O and porphyrin Fe(IV)O 
complexes. Electronic function of the porphyrin and axial ligands of iron were estab-
lished on the basis of the detailed UV–vis, 1H NMR, EPR, Mössbauer and resonance 
Raman characteristics. 
It was shown [10] that in case of Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) FeCl/PhIO system, 
only one product of oxidation of nicotine to cotinine 
was obtained. When using TPPMnCl as catalyst with PhIO, the yield of cotinine was 
substantially increased and cotinine can be also oxidized to 3-OH cotinine. Mass 
spectrometry (MS) and NMR data indicated that it is isomeric with the keto-amide, 
which has been isolated as a urinary metabolite from Rhesus monkey. 
The improving efﬁciency of the third generation metalloporphyrins can be illus-
trated on the example of the hydroxylation of heptane, by PhIO [11]. The yield of 
oxygenation of heptane to heptanols and heptanones heptane + PhIO → heptanols 
+ heptanones + PhIwas found to increase from 38% when utilizing Fe(TDCPP)Cl 
as catalyst and to to 78% with the third-generation catalyst Fe(TDCPCl8P)Cl 
The aim of work [12] was to evaluate whether metalloporphyrin models could 
mimic the action of cytochrome P-450 in the oxidation of atrazine, a herbicide

tetrakis(pentaﬂuorophenyl)porphyrin metal(III) chloride [M(TFPP)Cl] (metal = 
Fe or Mn) and the oxidants iodosylbenzene and metachloroperbenzoic acid, it 
was found that the metalloporphyrins can oxidize atrazine. Yields as high as 32% 
were obtained for the Mn(TFPP)Cl/PhIO system, indicating that these catalysts can 
mimic action of cytochrome P-450. 
The biomimetic oxidation of metribuzin 
a pre- and post-emergence herbicide, with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by 
5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrinatoiron(III) chlorides [TAPFe(III)Cl], has been studied 
[13]. The reaction yielded 6-t-butyl-3-methylthio-1,2,4-triazine-5(4H)-one, 4-
amino-6-t-butyl-3,5(2H,4H)-dione and 6-t-butyl-1,2,4-triazin-3,5(2H,4H)-dione. 
Oxidative degradation of the herbicides atrazine (1), atraton (2), ametryn (3), and 
mecoprop (4) was carried out with hydrogen peroxide and metalloporphyrins as 
catalysts [14]. Two different reaction conditions were studied, the ﬁrst involving 
Mn(TDCPP)Cl in an aprotic solvent with buffer (S-I), and the second using 
Fe(TPFPP)Cl in a protic solvent (S-II). The reaction was studied in two conditions, 
the ﬁrst involving Mn(TDCPP)Cl in an aprotic solvent with buffer (S-I), and the 
second using Fe(TPFPP)Cl in a protic solvent (S-II). The experiments showed the 
following results: (1) In the case of the S-I conditions, the s-triazines were oxidized 
through hydroxylation of the alkyl side chains followed by dealkylation, while S-II 
was ineffective for these reactions; (2) Mecoprop was oxidized with high efﬁciency 
by S-II, leading to decarboxylation and further oxidation, while in the presence of S-I, 
low substrate conversion was observed, and reaction resulted mainly from oxidation 
at the benzyl position; (3) Sulfoxidation of ametryn was observed with both systems; 
(4) Involvement of different reactive species assigned to the oxo and hydroperoxy 
complexes occurred; (5) These routes show similarities with metabolic pathways, 
with the reactivity pattern of S-I analogous; and (6) S-II catalyzes mecoprop 
decarboxylation via a similar pathway to that seen with peroxidase catalyzed reac-
tions. Biomimetic oxidation of a trans isomer of permethrin, fenvalerate, together 
with the corresponding chrysanthemic acid and alcohol moieties in the presence of 
hydrogen peroxide or meta-chloroperbenzoic acid as an oxidant was conducted using

catalytic amounts of six iron-porphyrins [15]. The weak electron donor as the axial 
ligand of iron was found to increase the oxidative reactivity of porphyrin. The intro-
duction of electron-withdrawing substituents at β- and meso-positions of a porphyrin 
ring resulted in higher conversion. 
Using 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenol 
as the reductant, the direct ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic observation of the 
soluble iodosylarene-manganese porphyrin adduct following catalytic oxidation was 
reported [16]. Manganese(V)-oxo porphyrin species 
were utilized using 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenol as the reductant [16]. Both the 
iodosylarene-manganese porphyrin adduct and [(porphyrin)Mn(V) O] species were 
simultaneously observed. In the absence of reductant, the adduct of iodosylarene 
with sterically hindered [Mn(meso-tetrakis(2,6-dichlorophenyl)porphinato)Cl] was 
formed, and converted into a high-valent [(porpyrinato)MnO]. On the basis of kinetic 
data, obtained by ultraviolet–vis spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass 
spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis, a detailed mechanism of the reaction was proposed. 
A reactive hydroxoferric porphyrazine complex, [(PyPz)FeIII(OH) (OH2)]4+ (1, 
PyPz = tetramethyl-2,3-pyridino porphyrazine) has been prepared via one-electron 
oxidation of the corresponding ferrous species [(PyPz)FeII(OH2)2]4+ (2) (Fig. 12.7) 
[25]. Electrochemical analysis revealed high FeIII–OH/FeII–OH2 reduction potential

interconversion from pH 2 to pH 8. The O–H bond dissociation energy of the FeII– 
OH2 complex was estimated as 84 kcal mol–1. Experiments showed that compound 
1 reacts rapidly with substrates via C-H hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), reducing 1 to 
[(PyPz)FeII(OH2)2]4+ (2) (Fig. 12.4). The second-order rate constant for the reaction 
of [(PyPz)FeIII(OH) (OH2)]4+ with xanthene was found to be 2.22 × 103 M−1 s−1 
that 5–6 orders of magnitude faster than other reported FeIII-OH complexes.

of the prepared catalysts were evaluated. The oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol 
to 2,3,5-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone with hydrogen peroxide was studied by varying

discussed.

conjunction with the terminal oxidant, PhIO, with microwave irradiation. 
In order to evaluate whether metalloporphyrins were good biomimetic models for 
the oxidation of herbicides [21], the oxidation metalloporphyrin-mediated oxidation 
of a herbicide of the triazine class, simazine, 
was examined. In order to evaluate whether metalloporphyrins were good 
biomimetic models for the oxidation of this herbicide [21], the following 
second-generation metalloporphyrins were subjects of the research: 5,10,15,20-
tetrakis(2,6-dichlorophenyl)porphyrin

[M(TDCPP)]Cl, 
5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentaﬂuorophenyl)porphyrin metal(III) chloride, [M(TFPP)]Cl; 
and

metal(III)
chloride, 
[M(TMPyP)]Cl5 (metal = Fe or Mn). The iodosylbenzene (PhIO), hydrogen 
peroxide, and 3-chloroperoxy benzoic acid (m-CPBA) were utilized as oxidants. 
Results indicated that these metalloporphyrins can mimic both the in vivo and 
in vitro action of cytochrome P450 for simazine oxidation. Among the systems, 
[Fe(TDCPP)]Cl/m-CPBA was the most efﬁcient for simazine oxidation, giving up 
to 49% total conversion. Degradation of atrazine (ATZ), a herbicide, catalyzed 
by manganese porphyrins as biomimetic cytochrome P450 models, using PhIO, 
PhI(OAc)2, H2O2, t-BuOOH, m-CPBA, or Oxone® as oxidant was evaluated [22]. 
Oxidant, iodosylbenzene provided the best result of ATZ degradation which was as 
high as 47%. The same catalyst/oxidant systems in natural water from a Brazilian 
river as solvent were studied and indicated yield up to 100% ATZ degradation when 
iodobenzene diacetate was the oxidant.

Indirect pathway for conversion methane to methanol, which was widely used in 
chemical industry, run at 1000 °C and elevated pressure divided to three steps 
(Fig. 12.6) [27]: (1) Synthesis gas by steam reforming of methane; (2) High pressure 
catalytic conversion syngas to methanol using Cu–Zn–O-based catalyst such as Cu/ 
ZnO/Al2O3; and (3) Separation of crude methanol from the unconverted synthesis 
gas and puriﬁed, while the unconverted syngas was recycled. Direct routes involving 
the partial oxidation methane to methanol, or one-step catalytic oxidation, can be 
chosen as an alternative process [26–40].

The Shilov Cycle is a way to realize CH4 oxidation in mild condition [30]. The 
Shilov system is catalyzed by PtCl2 in an aqueous solution, where PtCl6 2− acts as the 
ultimate oxidizing agent. The cycle includes the following steps: (1) Electrophilic 
addition of CH4 (or an alkane) to the Pt(II) center of chloroplatinate occurs in an 
aqueous medium; (2) Simultaneous deprotonation which leads to the formation of 
a Pt(II)–CH3 complex; (3) Oxidation of the Pt(II)–CH3 complex forms the Pt(IV)– 
CH3 complex; and (4) Subsequent nucleophilic attack by H2O molecules or Cl− 
ions at the methyl group of the Pt(IV)–CH3 complex which leads to the formation of 
methanol or methyl chloride (which is hydrolyzable to methanol), with simultaneous 
regeneration of the Pt(II). 
To mimic dinuclear active sites of some nonheme diiron proteins, ten new 
polydentate and potentially dinucleating ligands containing a carboxylate moiety 
designed to bridge two metal atoms were synthesized [31].  The reaction of  
these ligands with Fe left pa renthesis ClO Subscript 4 Baseline right parenthesis Subscript 3 Baseline dot 9 upper H Subscript 2 Baseline upper O leads to ferric bold mu-oxo-bold mu-carboxylato iron

containing one or two immobilized bridging carboxylates, respectively. Later 
it was shown [32] that iron complexes formed during the thermal treatment of 
FeZSM-5 zeolite perform single-turnover cycles of methane oxidation to methanol 
at ambient conditions when nitrous oxide can be used as a source of oxygen. 
The long-living active intermediate is capable of transferring an accepted O 
atom into a C-H bond of methane to produce methanol at 100% selectivity.

The reaction between an Fe(III) complex and O2 to afford a stable catalytically

ﬁve-coordinated FeIII−TAML complexes with an axial aqua ligand ([PPh4]1−H2O, 
tetraamidato macrocyclic FeIII species derived from 3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-3,4,8,9-

reacted rapidly with O2 in CH2Cl2 or other weakly coordinating solvents to produce 
black μ-oxo-bridged diiron(IV) complexes, 2, in high yields. Main results of this work 
included the following: (1) Phosphonium salts of ﬁve-coordinated Fe(III)-TAML 
complexes with an axial aqua ligand ([PPh4)]1-H2O, tetraamidato macrocyclic 
Fe(III) species derived from 3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-3,4,8,9-tetrahydro-1H-1,4,8,11-
benzotetraazacyclotridecine-2,5,7,10(6H,11H)-tetraone) reacted rapidly with O2 
in CH2Cl2; (2) Weakly coordinating solvents black mu-oxo-bridged diiron(IV) 
complexes, 2, were produced in high yields; (3) The complexes were character-
ized by X-ray crystallography microanalytical data, mass spectrometry, UV/Vis, 
Mossbauer, and (1)H NMR spectroscopies, showing the diamagnetic Fe-O-Fe unit 
contains antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1 Fe(IV) sites; (4) The oxidation of 
PPh3 to OPPh3 by 2 was conﬁrmed by UV/Vis and gas chromatography–mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS); (5) The bridging oxygen atom of 2 that derives from O2 was 
established in the labeling experiments with 18O2 and H2 18O; and (6) Complexes 
2 catalyzed the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols into the corresponding 
aldehydes and bleach rapidly organic dyes, such as Orange II in MeCN-H2O 
mixtures. 
Using electrochemical methods, Xue et al. have succeeded in preparing the ﬁrst 
example of a synthetic complex possessing an [FeIV2(-O)2] diamond core [36]. 
Speciﬁcally, a synthesis of an [Fe(IV)2(mu-O2)])) has been performed in MeCN 
at – 40 °C [Fe(III)Fe(IV)(mu-O)2(L(b))2]3+ complex exhibited potential E(1/2) = 
760 mV versus Fc(+/0). Information about the structure and physical properties 
of this complex was obtained using a number of physical methods, namely: (1) A 
product of oxidation of 1b exhibited a visible spectrum with lambda(max) at 485 
nm (9800 M−1 cm−1) and 875 nm (2200 M−1cm−1); (2) The 4.2 K Mössbauer 
spectrum of 2b showed parameters typical of an iron(IV) center; (3) The Mössbauer 
patterns observed in strong applied ﬁelds indicated that 2b is an antiferromagnetically 
coupled diiron(IV) center; (4) Resonance Raman studies revealed the diagnostic 
vibration mode of the [Fe2(mu-O)2] core; (5) Extended x-ray absorption ﬁne structure 
(EXAFS) analysis conﬁrmed structure of the complex [Fe(IV)2(mu-O)2(L(b))2 4+]; 
and (6) A valence-delocalized [Fe(III)Fe(IV)(mu-O)2(L(b))2]3+ complex exhibited 
potential E(1/2) = 760 mV versus Fc(+/0). 
The design and synthesis of metal organic framework (MOF) catalysts inspired 
by pMMO for selective methane oxidation to methanol was reported [37]. The struc-
ture of the catalysts active sites was conﬁrmed using solid-state UV−vis, resonance 
Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies complemented by density functional

theory (DFT) calculations. Compound MOF-808 (Fig. 12.9) was utilized as a scaf-
fold to host and stabilize highly active copper oxygen complexes, bis(μoxo) dicopper 
species. The complex was ligated to imidazole moieties including L-histidine (His), 
4-imidazoleacrylic acid (Iza), and 5-benzimidazolecarboxylic acid (Bzz). Methane 
oxidation was conducted with an isothermal series of treatments at 150 °C., the 
average methanol productivity corresponded to 31.7 ± 13.0, 61.8 ± 17.5, and 71.8 ± 
23.4 μmol gMOF-808-L-Cu−1 for MOF-808-His-Cu, MOF-808-Iza-Cu, and MOF-
808-Bzz-Cu, respectively. This ﬁnding indicated that the MOF808-Bzz-Cu has the 
high methanol productivity. Combined spectroscopies and density functional theory 
calculations suggested that bis(μ-oxo) dicopper species as probable active site of the 
catalysts. The authors concluded that the resulting catalysts are capable of highly 
selective oxidation of methane to methanol under isothermal conditions. A series 
of iron(IV) oxo complexes, which differ in the donor groups (CH2py or CH2COO– 
have been prepared and investigated in water at pH 2 and 7 [38]). Experiments 
revealed the following properties of the system under study: (1) The νFe=O values 
of 832 ± 2 cm–1 indicate similar FeIV=O bond strengths; (2) Different reactivities 
toward C–H substrates in water; (3) Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) occurs at rates 
that differ by one order of magnitude with KIEs (kH/kD = 30–66) consistent with 
hydrogen atom tunneling; (4) Higher KIEs correlation with faster reaction rates as 
well as a greater thermodynamic stability of the iron(III) resting states took place; (5) 
A doubling in rate from pH 7 to pH 2 for substrate C–H oxidation by the most potent 
complex, that with a cis-carboxylate donor, [FeIVO(Htpena)]2+ was observed; (6) 
Supramolecular assistance by the ﬁrst and second coordination spheres in activating 
the substrate was proposed; (7) The lifetime of this complex in the absence of a C–H 
substrate is the shortest; and (8) The iron(IV)=O complex bearing an alcohol moiety 
in the second coordination sphere which displayed signiﬁcantly shorter lifetimes.
A computational design screen of over 2500 mid-row 3d transition-metal 
complexes with four metals in numerous spin and oxidation states to design strate-
gies for spin-allowed methane-to-methanol catalysis was carried out [39]. The reac-
tion energies for the radical rebound mechanism of methane-to-methanol conversion 
were calculated for mononuclear transition metal complexes with four mid-row 3d 
metals (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) in two oxidation states (M(II)/M(III)). The computa-
tion demonstrated the importance of spin/oxidation state. Obtained weak coupling 
of energetics and design principles between reactions steps (e.g., oxo formation 
vs. methanol release) indicated that that linear free energy relationships LFERs are 
not fulﬁlled across the catalyst set. Suggested catalytic cycle for radical rebound 
oxidation of methane to methanol is displayed in Fig. 12.10.
In a recent review [40] simultaneously optimization methane activation and 
methanol release (Fig. 12.11, 1–4), calculating with machine learning-accelerated 
density functional theory in a space of 16 M candidate catalysts including novel 
macrocycles was performed. The large-scale search showed a compromise that low-
spin Fe(II) compounds paired with strong-ﬁeld between hydrogen atom transfer 
(HAT) and methanol release. By decoupling equatorial and axial ligand effects, it 
was determined that negatively charged axial ligands are critical for more rapid 
release of methanol. For example, M(III) versus M(II) are likely to be rate-limited

is a hydrocarbon consisting of an aromatic unit (typically a benzene ring) and a 
chain that forms a bridge between two nonadjacent positions of the aromatic ring. 
Cyclophanes have been used as enzyme mimics; because their geometric and elec-
tronic properties can be easily controlled. Diederich and coworkers have designed 
a cyclophane-based pyruvate oxidase model [42]. Flavo-thiazolio-cyclophane was 
prepared by an 18-step synthesis. This pathway involved the following steps: (1) 
Preparation of bromo-cyclophane (37% yield over 13-steps); (2) The bromide was 
subsequently converted into the corresponding boronic acid and connected to the 
7-bromoﬂavin via Suzuki coupling to give ﬂavo-cyclophane; and (3) The thiazolium 
unit was introduced after quaternization of the tertiary amino groups; forming ﬂavo-
thiazolio-cyclophane , with both prosthetic groups attached in proximity to the cyclo-
phane binding site; and (4) In basic methanolic solution, Cyclophane 7 catalyzed the 
oxidation of aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding methyl esters, indicating 
the turnover number calculated for the oxidation of naphthalene-2-carbaldehyde to 
methyl naphthalene-2-carboxylate (kcat = 0.22 s−1).

The most promising direction for enzyme modeling is synthetically mimetic nature 
of the binding site and the active site in terms of the close similarity of catalytic 
groups, stereochemistry, interatomic distances and the mechanism of the action of 
the enzyme [41–61]. 
Review [49] explored research in the development of synthetic catalysts based 
on the chemistry of hydrolytic enzymes published by 2019. Active site chem-
istry, tuning transition state interactions, and establishing reactive nanoenvironments 
conducive to attracting, binding, and releasing target molecules were in the review 
focus. In a typical early example, mimicking of the “proton-transfer relay”, proposed 
for the mechanism of the action of chymotrypsin, was performed. The miniature 
organic model of chymotrypsin was designed on the basis of cyclodextrin (CD) 
which is cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of α-1,4-linked (Fig. 12.12) [41]. The 
catalytic activity of “artiﬁcial chymotrypsin” (Fig. 10.12) in the hydrolysis of m-
tert-butylphenyl acetate (kcat = 2.8 × 102 s−1, KM = 13 × 105 M) was found to be 
close to the activity of chymotrypsin in the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (kcat

= 1.1 × 102 s−1, KM = 4 × 105 M). Another example of mimicking enzyme catal-
ysis by β-cyclodextrin is general acid-base-catalyzed hydrolysis and nitrosation of 
amines by alkyl nitrites [60]. Addition of β-CD strongly inhibits ув the acid hydrol-
ysis of alkyl nitrite. The retardation of the reaction was attributed to a separation of 
the reagents: β-CD and alkyl nitrites form host−guest 1:1 inclusion complexes. The 
strong catalysis observed with 1-phenyl-1-propyl nitrite upon the addition of DTABr 
was indicative of an example of allosteric activation (Fig. 12.12). 
A nucleosidase hydrolyzes the bonds of nucleotides T. Carbon-based nanozymes 
were ﬁrstly discovered to mimic natural nucleases in the 1990s [61]. Water-soluble 
fullerene 
functionalized with carboxylic acid moieties, C60-1, was utilized to catalyze the 
cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA when irradiated by light. 
A Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute (Pf Ago)-based platform for generating artiﬁ-
cial restriction enzymes (AREs) capable of recognizing and cleaving DNA sequences 
was developed [48]. The Argonaute protein family plays a central role in RNA 
silencing processes as essential components of the RNA-induced silencing complex. 
Short DNA guides were used to direct Pf Ago to target sites for cleavage at high 
temperatures (> 87 °C) followed by reannealing of the cleaved single stranded DNAs. 
Peptide dendrimers with one to three amino acids between branches were prepared 
with up to 38 amino acids (MW ∼ 5000 Da) [47]. Structural studies of peptide 
dendrimers by circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), NMR 
and molecular dynamics revealed molten globule states containing up to 50% of

α-helix. The Fourier transform (FT) is a transform that converts a function into 
a form that describes the frequencies present in the original function. Mimicking 
esterase and aldolase peptide dendrimers displayed enzyme kinetics (kcat/kuncat ∼ 
105) were screening from large combinatorial libraries. Combinatorial chemistry 
comprises chemical synthetic methods in which compound libraries can be made as 
mixtures, sets of a large number individual compounds or chemical structures gener-
ated by computer software. Efﬁcient ligands for cobalamin, cytotoxic colchicine 
conjugates and antimicrobial peptide dendrimers were developed. In study [50], a 
peptide-based artiﬁcial hydrolase with photoswitchable activity was fabricated by 
the introduction of a catalytic histidine residue and a photoresponsive azobenzene 
group into the peptide chain. The activity of the hydrolase mimic was controlled using 
UV and visible light. An enhanced catalytic activity on p-nitrophenyl acetate was 
observed due to the proximity effect of the histidine residues and the hydrophobic 
microenvironment in the supramolecular assemblies. 
The functioning of two chemically promiscuous mono- and binuclear metalloen-
zymes (insulin degrading enzyme and glycerophosphodiesterase) and two synthetic 
analogues was examined [52]. Several studies in which a plethora of computational 
techniques have been successfully employed were carried out. To model mechanism 
of the activity of hydrolytic enzymes, the conformation of an unstructured bimetallic 
Zn(II) complex was controlled by its inclusion in the cavity of a γ-cyclodextrin 
[54]. For this purpose, a catalytic bimetallic site for the hydrolytic cleavage of 
the RNA model substrate 2-hydroxypropyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (HPNP), whose 
reactivity is 30-fold larger with respect to the unstructured complex, was constructed 
(Fig. 12.13). Competitive inhibition with 1-adamantanecarboxylate
displaces the metal complex from the cyclodextrin decreasing the reactivity. 
A three-dimensional geometry analysis of the key catalytic residues in natural 
hydrolases has been exploited to design and synthesize small-molecule artiﬁcial 
enzymes which mimic the active centers of chymotrypsin and N-terminal hydrolases 
(Fig. 12.14) [55]. DFT studies and X-ray diffraction analysis of the catalyst bound 
to a transition state analogue proved the similarity with the geometry of natural 
hydrolases. The optimized prototype catalyzed the methanolysis of the acyl enzyme 
mimic with a half-life of 3.7 min at 20 °C and also perform the transesteriﬁcation of 
vinyl acetate at room temperature.

were reported. The number of metal ions present in the catalyst, their precise orienta-
tion to elicit cooperativity, the introduction of hydrogen bond donors, and the control 
of the solvating medium properties were taking in consideration. An important role 
of these metal ions in decreasing the pKa of the nucleophilic species was stressed. 
A comparison of catalysts 1 and 2 (Fig. 12.15), red arrow shows that the dinuclear 
catalyst is 34- or 200-fold better than the mononuclear one when kcat or k2 (kcat/KM) 
is considered, respectively.
Selected examples of structure of enzyme mimetic catalysts are indicated in 
Fig. 12.16 [56].
A molecular device that can selectively hydrolyze glycerophospholipids (GPLs) 
under physiologically relevant conditions was engineered [57]. A chemically modi-
ﬁed α-cyclodextrin bearing amine functional groups was shown to hydrolyze 
lyso-GPLs, generating free fatty acids (Fig. 12.17). Lyso-GPLs are preferentially 
hydrolyzed when part of a mixture of GPL lipid species, and reaction efﬁciency was 
dependent on lyso-GPL chemical structure.

artiﬁcial catalytic triads [58]. 
With permission from 
Elsevier 
To modeling nature’s catalytic triad, consisting of a hydroxyl group of a serine 
residue, an imidazole group of a histidine residue, and a carboxyl group of an 
aspartic acid, a polymer scaffolded enzyme mimic was incorporated with artiﬁcial 
catalytic triad units (Fig. 12.18) [58]. The experiments were supported by molecular 
dynamics simulations. Compared to a water soluble artiﬁcial catalytic triad, enhanced 
esterolytic activity of p-nitrophenyl benzoate was observed for the polymeric catalyst. 
It was suggested that this effect appears due to the hydrophobic microenvironment 
formed by the tertiary structure of the polymer backbone.

Chapter 13 
Miscellaneous Biomimetic Processes 
Abstract The key role of nitric oxide (NO) in numerous vital biological processes, 
including the human body in normal and pathological conditions, poses an 
urgent problem of dosed and regulated ﬂow of objects of interest. S-Nitrosothiols 
have received much attention in the chemistry of NO-based signaling in living 
systems, because they serve as donors of both the nitrosonium ion NO+ and of 
NO. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) mimics the beneﬁcial activity of endothelial 
Nitric Oxide Synthase-derived nitric oxide in organisms. For example, admin-
istration of exogenous of GSNO or enhancing the level of endogenous GSNO 
protects against neurovascular injury (endothelial dysfunction) of mouse models, 
reduces brain infarctions and edema, improves neurobehavioral functions, atten-
uates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in a mice, exhibits anti-ischemic 
and anti-inﬂammatory functions, and stimulates neurorepair and functional recovery 
following experimental stroke in rats. Due to the possibility of synthesizing almost 
unlimited number of the iron–sulfur–nitrosyl complexes (ISNC) of various struc-
tures, stability, and bioavailability, they can be used for predictable regulation of 
synthesis of nitric oxide in biological systems. The complexes showed encouraging 
results and their therapeutic potential are subject of discussion. Principles and recent 
developments of catalysis by abzyme, a monoclonal antibody with catalytic activity 
of a corresponding enzyme and their potential applications of catalytic antibodies 
in reactive immunization, therapy, biochemical analysis, and biotechnology were 
described. Data on artiﬁcial enzymes of common interest not included in previous 
chapter are discussed in a separate section. 
13.1 Nitric Oxide Producing Activity 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a vertebrate biological messenger, playing a key role in a variety 
of biological processes being a bioproduct in almost all types of organisms, including 
bacteria, plants, fungi, and animal cells [1–3]. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an 
enzyme catalyzing the formation of L-citrulline and nitric oxide from L-arginine 
(Section X). Small molecular NO donors usually show lack stability and have a short
 
439

half-life in human tissues, limiting the therapeutic application. The dosed production 
of NO and its effect on physiological processes is an important factor and an actual 
challenge in modern biomedicine (Section X). The past decade has seen the advent 
of a new paradigm in controlled delivery of NO, namely localized bioconversion of 
the endogenous prodrugs of NO, speciﬁcally by enzyme mimics. 
13.1.1 
S-Nitrosoglutathione as NO Donor 
S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) 
is an endogenous S-nitrosothiol (SNO) that plays a critical role in nitric oxide 
signaling and is a source of bioavailable NO. S-Nitrosothiols serve as a good source 
of nitric oxide due to the ease of cleavage of the S-N bond which consequently 
produces NO [4–15]. 
The reductive decomposition of GSNO by L-ascorbic acid yields NO which 
was monitored both electrochemically and spectrophotometrically [4]. The kinetics 
experiments showed several important results, namely: (1) The decomposition rate 
increases with pH demonstrating that the L-ascorbic acid dianion (A(2-)) is the 
most reactive species of L-ascorbic acid (H(2)A); (2) the derived rate expression, 
measuring the disappearance of the absorption at ca. 336 nm due to GSNO), 
was established as rate = −d[GSNO](t)/dt = ((k(a)[H+]2 + k(b)[H+]K(1) + 
k(c)K(1)K(2))/([H+]2 + K(1)[H+] + K(1)K(2)))[GSNO](t)[H(2)A](t) where k(a), 
k(b), and k(c) are second-order rate constants via the H(2)A, HA(−), and A(2−) 
pathways, respectively. And K(1) and K(2) represent the ﬁrst and second equilib-
rium dissociation constants of L-ascorbic acid; (3) at 25 °C, k(b) = 5.23 ± 1.47 × 
10−3 dm3 mol−1 s−1 and k(c) = 1.22 ± 0.04 × 103) dm3 mol−1 s(−1), activation 
parameters ΔH (b) = 54.4 ± 4.3 kJ mol−1, ΔS (b)  = −106 ± 16 J K−1 mol−1, ΔH 
(c) = 80.5 ± 7.5 kJ mol-1, ΔS (c)  = 84 ± 7 kJ mol-1; (4) induced catalytic decom-
position of GSNO becomes signiﬁcant above ca. 10 µM Cu(2+); and (5) to nullify 
any catalysis by Cu2+, EDTA was added to all experimental reactions except those 
where catalysis by Cu2+ was studied. 
Studies on brain and spinal cord (a long, thin, tubular structure made up of 
nervous tissue) trauma using a rat model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (IR) 
showed that exogenous treatment with the S-nitrosylating agent S-nitrosoglutathione 
(GSNO)—a nitric oxide and glutathione metabolite of the human body—stimulates 
neurorepair and aids functional recovery [9]. The testing of a hypothesis that GSNO

13.1 Nitric Oxide Producing Activity
441
invokes the neurorepair process and improves neurobehavioral functions through the 
angiogenic HIF-1α/VEGF pathway indicated that GSNO stimulates the process of 
neurorepair, promotes angiogenesis, and aids functional recovery through the HIF-
1α-dependent pathway, showing therapeutic and translational promise for stroke. 
In work [13], experiments were performed to determine whether the nitric oxide 
donor, S-nitrosoglutathione, may exert different effects on diabetic and nondiabetic 
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Diabetic state was induced in mice 
by multiple intraperitoneal injections of low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). 
Diabetic mices were subjected to 30 min ischemia for 3 or 24 h eperfusion. 
The experiments indicated that GSNO attenuated MI/R injury in nondiabetic mice, 
as measured by improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size, and decreased 
cardiomyocyte apoptosis. GSNO aggravated the MI/R injury in diabetic mice. 
Thus, diabetes may cause superoxide overproduction, increase NO inactivation and 
peroxynitrite formation, and convert GSNO from a cardioprotective molecule to a 
cardiotoxic molecule. An administration of exogenous of GSNO or enhancing the 
level of endogenous GSNO protected against neurovascular injury in wild-type (WT) 
and eNOS-(endothelial dysfunction) mouse models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion 
(IR) [14] Reduced brain infarctions and edema, and improved neurobehavioral func-
tions by pre- or post-injury GSNO treatment of eNOS indicated that GSNO can 
attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. It was suggested that this effect 
is caused by mimicking the eNOS-derived NO-dependent anti-ischemic and anti-
inﬂammatory functions. The hypothesis that treatment with S-nitrosoglutathione 
is sufﬁcient to revert insulin resistance induced by a high-sucrose diet was tested 
utilizing Male Wistar rats [15]. The animals were divided in a control or high-sucrose 
group, and insulin sensitivity was determined: (i) in the fast state; (ii) after a stan-
dardized test meal; (iii) after GSH + NO; and after (iv) S-nitrosoglutathione (admin-
istration). It was found that GSNO was able to revert insulin resistance induced by 
sucrose feeding that they have an insulin-sensitizing effect in vivo and that GSNO 
promotes insulin sensitivity in a sucrose-induced insulin-resistant animal model.

review [22] was to summarize the recent advances that contributed in unveiling the 
intricate relationships between the structural modiﬁcations on iron complexes and 
their reactivity, cellular trafﬁcking, and global mechanisms of action. These advan-
tages allowed the iron complexes to be used use as anticancer drugs in clinics, due 
to inﬂuencing on iron homeostasis, the antiproliferative activity, and elevating safety 
index. The ﬁnding showed encouraging results as per their therapeutic potential.

[Fe2(SC10H17N3O6)2(NO)4]SO4·2H2O (II), which spontaneously evolve NO in 
aqueous medium. NO formation was measured by using a spectrophotometric 
method by the formation of a hemoglobin (Hb)–NO complex. In work [20], the 
natural utilization of the [Fe(NO)2] motif for translocation of endogenous NO 
and the translational development of synthetic dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) 
for biomedical applications were performed. It was demonstrated that mechanistic 
study of NO-release and NO-transfer reactivity of structure-characterized DNICs 
promoted the discovery of cell-penetrating and in vivo NO-delivery reactivity. These 
compounds were used for treatment of cancer and wound healing in diabetes. Acti-
vation of soluble guanylate cyclase sGC and vasodilation (the widening of blood 
vessels), phase I/II clinical trials of glutathione-bound DNICs against hypertension 
were observed. On this base, bioinorganic engineering of DNICs into scaffolds for 
tissue regeneration and repair relying on antibacterial, anti-inﬂammation, cytoprotec-
tive, and proliferative effects of NO was achieved. The antibacterial activity of [1Fe-
2S]- and [2Fe-2S]-nitrosyl complexes as nitric oxide donors on the ability of М. luteus 
to form bioﬁlms of Micrococcus luteus bacteria was examined [27]. The parameters 
of NO liberation of the complexes were found to be higher than 20 nmol L–1 during 
the ﬁrst 500 s for the binuclear complexes and 17–30 nmol L–1 for the mononuclear 
complexes. 
Two {FeNO}complexes [Fe(NO)(TMSPS2)(TMSPS2H)] (1, TMSPS2H2 = 2,2′-
dimercapto-3,3′-bis(trimethylsilyl)diphenyl)phenylphosphine; H is a dissociable 
proton) with a pendant thiol and [Fe(NO)(TMSPS2)(TMSPS2CH3)] (2) bearing a 
pendant thioether, were designed and spectroscopically and structurally characterized 
[23]. Both complexes were found to be highly sensitive to visible light (Fig. 13.1). 
The experiment revealed the following sequence of the process steps: (1) Upon 
photolysis, complex 2 undergoes NO dissociation to yield a mononuclear Fe(III) 
complex, [Fe(TMSPS2)(TMSPS2CH3)]; (2) the pendant SH of 1 can act as a trap for 
the departing NO radical upon irradiation; (3) subsequent photolysis of the inter-
mediate A resulted in HNO production; (4) the photogenerated HNO can further 
react with [MnIII(TMSPS3)(DABCO)] (TMSPS3H3 = (2,2′2′′-trimercapto-3,3′,3′′-
tris(trimethylsilyl)triphenylphosphine; DABCO = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) in 
organic media to yield anionic [Mn(NO)(TMSPS3)]− (5–) with a {MnNO} electronic 
conﬁguration; and 5) effective differentiation of the formation of HNO from complex 
1 with the pendant SH versus NO from 2 with the pendant SMe was achieved by the 
employment of [MnIII(TMSPS3)(DABCO)].

Synthesis of a series of nontoxic nanoparticles based on chitosanhyaluronic acid 
(HA) 
encapsulating dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs, donors NO) into the nanoparticles 
to increase the stability and effectiveness of their action was performed [26]. The 
effect of the nanoparticle-DNIC complex on the cell viability of cardiomyocytes 
was assessed. Speciﬁcally, nanoparticles were obtained from chitosan-HA using the 
ionotropic gelation technology, and its morphology size and stability were charac-
terized by the electrochemistry and electron microscopy. It was emphasized that 
the incorporation of the DNICs into the composition of the nanoparticles prolonged 
the generation of NO, enhanced the yield of nitrogen monoxide, and also signiﬁ-
cantly increased the stability of the DNICs. The anionic tetranitrosyl iron complex 
with thiosulfate ligands (TNIC) was characterized as one of the most promising NO 
donors [24].

part of the work included the following sections: synthesis of TNIC, preparation of 
BSA-bounded TNIC, employing UV–Vis absorption and ESR spectroscopies. The 
experiment indicated that TNIC, being in a protein-bound form, has an inhibitory 
effect on the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in a mouse 
brain homogenate and inﬂuence on the catalytic activity of mitochondrial membrane-
bound enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase and monoamine oxidase A. Thus,

stabilization of TNIC with BSA opens up the possibility of its practical application

The synthesis, structure, and properties of a new series of DNIC dimers (viz 
dimers of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) of [Fe2(SR)2(NO)4] composition, 
where R is 5-(2-nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyl (I), 5-(3-nitrophenyl)-4-
H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyl (II), 5-(4-nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyl (III), 
were examined employing NMR 1H, IR, Mossbauer spectroscopies, and X-ray 
structural analysis as well as quantum-chemical calculations in the frame of DFT 
(NBO and QTAIM) methods and monitoring antibacterial activity [25]. DNIC dimers 
belong to µ–N–C–S structural type that are functionalized with 5-(nitrophenyl)-4-H-
1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyls. Several new compounds were prepared including dimers of 
dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) of [Fe2(SR)2(NO)4] composition, where R is 5-(2-
nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyl (I), 5-(3-nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-
3-thiolyl (II), 5-(4-nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyl (III). The complex-(4-
nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiolyl (III) was obtained by replacement of thio-
sulfate ligands in [Fe(S2O3)2(NO)2]2- anion. NO generation was determined using 
amperometric method. Data on molecular interactions stabilizing DNIC dimer of 
µ–N–C–S structural type functionalized by 5-(2-nitrophenyl)-4-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-
thiolyl were revealed based on investigation of the structures of I (Fig. 13.3). Assess-
ment of antibacterial activity of I–III with respect to gram-negative (Escherichia 
coli) and gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus) bacteria was also performed and the 
ability of the compounds to inhibit growth of bacteria was determined by the serial 
dilution method. A serial dilution is the stepwise dilution of a substance in solution.

The mechanisms of hydrolysis of a model cationic dinitrosyl iron complex with a 
prototypic thioformaldehyde ligand have been examined using the density functional 
theory and polarizable continuum water model [18]. The free energy calculations 
with the implicit aqueous medium demonstrated exothermic character of hydrolysis 
(about − 70 kJ mol–1) and preference for the associative mechanism of this reaction. 
Other results of this work included the following: (1) The dissociative mechanism 
involves ~ 34 kJ mol–1 higher activation barrier than the associative one; (2) the reac-
tion intermediates with unﬁlled vacant position after removal of SCH2 at the central 
iron are less stable than the intermediates where the positions of the SCH2 ligand 
are ﬁlled with water molecules; and (3) the exchange of NO· for H2O is unfavorable 
by several tens kJ mol–1. In work [28], transformation mechanism of complex

(complex 1) as cardioprotective and cytostatic agent has been studied in anaerobic 
aqueous solution (pH = 7.0), DMSO, and ethanol. According to EPR-spectroscopy 
and UV-spectra, in anaerobic aqueous solution (pH = 7.0), DMSO, and ethanol, 
the solvents have a signiﬁcant effect on the decomposition of complex. From 
the experimental and theoretical data obtained, it followed that complex 1 is the 
most stable in DMSO. The complex can be served as a promising prodrug for the 
treatment of diseases. Solutions of complex in a DMSO-water mixture can be used 
to improve its bioavailability in further in vitro and in vivo studies.

13.2 Catalytic Antibodies 
13.2.1 
Fundamentals 
An abzyme is a monoclonal antibody with catalytic activity [31–55]. A monoclonal 
antibody is an antibody produced from a cell lineage made by cloning a unique white 
blood cell. Recent developments of catalysis by antibodies are based on fundamental 
ideas advanced many years ago. Pauling [30] proposed that the lowering of the acti-
vation energy in enzyme catalysis results from the enzymes afﬁnity for the transition 
state (TS) exceeding its afﬁnity for the substrate. Developing this idea, Jencks [31] 
suggested that stable molecules, analogs of the transition state of a reaction could be 
used as haptens for the production of antibodies, which catalyze these reactions. Tran-
sition state analogs have been used for generating catalytic antibodies (Abs) abzymes 
that catalyze chemical reactions [32–40]. If an antibody can bind the transition state 
tightly like an enzyme, it can also catalyze the reaction just like an enzyme. The TS 
stable mimics, the transition state analogs, which have long half-lives and could be 
synthesized chemically, may function as an antigen to generate the antibody. Thus, 
antibodies and enzymes use the similar set of chemical interactions. The discovery of 
catalytic Abs has opened the door to a new form of targeted-enzyme therapy referred 
to as antibody-directed abzyme prodrug therapy (ADAPT). 
At present, a signiﬁcant number of reactions have been successfully performed 
with the use of catalytic antibodies [32–70]. Among them are reactions such as 
sigmatropic rearrangements, triterpen 
synthesis, hydrolysis, deprotonation, complexation of bivalent metals by proto-
porphyrin IX, acyl transfer and retroaldol reactions, the regio- and stereochem-
ical of reactions, cleavage of acetals and glycosides, phosphate ester cleavage, 
amides and organophosphorus compounds hydrolysis, removal of the p-nitrobenzyl 
ester protecting group, the derivatization of primary amines with naphthalene-2,3-
dicarboxaldehyde, hydrolysis of organophosphorus, hydrolyzing nerve agents such 
as Sarin and Soman in vivo, oxidosqualene-cyclase action in steroid ring poisons, 
formation of steroid ring A of the lanosterol nucleus, cationic cyclization of an 
oxidosqualene derivative., immunization with an 4-aza-steroid aminoxide. Success 
in the synthesis of new catalytic antibodies (CAs) depends on the efﬁciency of each 
of the following steps: (1) hapten design, (2) immunogen synthesis, (3) preparation 
of the enzymatic tracer; (4) generation and puriﬁcation of antibodies; and (5) kinetic 
assays. Though the values of the Michaels complex (Km ≈ 10−4–10−5 M) for reac-
tions catalyzed by natural enzymes and catalytic antibodies were found to be of the

13.2 Catalytic Antibodies
447
same order of magnitude, the catalytic constants (kcat) for CAs commonly 104 fold 
lower than that for correspondent enzymes. Experimental ratio values (kcat/kuncat) for  
abzymes range within 102–106, while these values for similar enzymatic reactions 
can reach 1017. 
The purpose of review [69] was to summarize the recent advances that contributed 
in unveiling the intricate relationships between the structural modiﬁcations on iron 
complexes and their reactivity, cellular trafﬁcking, and global mechanisms of action. 
These advantages allowed the iron complexes to be used use as anticancer drugs 
in clinics, due to inﬂuencing on iron homeostasis, the antiproliferative activity, and 
elevating safety index. The ﬁnding showed encouraging results as per their thera-
peutic potential. Interaction network of articles within the research topic “Autoanti-
bodies” was summarized [69]. Keywords of all 88 articles were downloaded from the 
website of the research topic “Autoantibodies.” These articles were selected from the 
theme of this topic, clustered around “Autoantibodies” and “Autoimmunity.” Clus-
tering was observed for speciﬁc diseases, namely, pemphigus and pemphigoid, lupus, 
arthritis, and neuroimmunology. Cytokines, B cells, cell signaling. The complement 
cascade was also the focus of many manuscripts. Differences and similarities between 
enzymes and antibodies including different mechanisms of enzyme inhibition by 
antibodies were discussed in detail using data on typical examples [62]. Recent 
review [65] summarized the up-to-date application of monoclonal antibodies mAb-
based approaches in assisting.to invasive aspergillosis (IA) diagnosis and therapy. 
It was demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high speciﬁcity in 
targeting the corresponding antigen(s) may have the potential to improve diag-
nostic tests. This work forms the basis for novel treatments of invasive aspergillosis 
which is a life-threatening fungal disease that causes high morbidity and mortality 
in immunosuppressed patients.

mesoporphyrin (MP) as well as the Fab fragment of the germ-line precursor anti-
body to 7G12 and its complex with the hapten N-methylmesoporphyrin have been 
solved to 2.6-Å resolution (Fig. 13.4) [53]. The structures showed that the antibody 
bound mesoporphyrin clearly adopts a nonplanar conformation and revealed that 
the antibody catalyzes the porphyrin metalation reaction by distorting the bound 
substrate toward the transition state conﬁguration. When N-methylmesoporphyrin 
was injected to animals as the antigen, monoclonal tightly binding antibodies were 
produced. Using a similar technique, antibodies that catalyze ester and amide hydrol-
ysis, transesteriﬁcation, and photoinduced cleavage, among other reactions, have 
been prepared.
Murine catalytic antibody 7A1 was generated against a phosphonate mono-ester 
transition state analog (TSA) of cocaine 5 (GNL) 
and hydrolyzes GNL to produce nonpsychoactive metabolites ecgonine methyl ester 
and benzoic acid [68]. Seven structures of Cocaine Catalytic Antibody 7A1 Fab0 
(Fig. 13.5) were determined to high resolution in the apo form (1.5 Å) and as 
complexes with six ligands: (1) substrate cocaine (1.5 Å); (2) the transition state 
analog (1.85 Å); (3) two products, ecgonine methyl ester and benzoic acid (2.1 Å); 
(4) product ecgonine methyl ester (2.3 Å); (5) product benzoic acid (1.85 Å); and 
heptaethylene glycol (1.70 Å). 7A1 Fab0 has an immunoglobulin (Ig) g1 heavy chain 
(H) and a light chain (L).
The results of the activity assay of antibody 7A1 are shown in Table 13.1. As  
can be seen from the Table, the use of a catalytic antibody increases the reaction 
rate by 4.6 × 103 times. It was concluded that the potential therapeutic application 
for cocaine catalytic antibodies would be enhanced by improved kinetic parameters, 
manifested either by a lower KM and/or by a greater kcat (Table 13.2).
Examining noncatalytic and catalytic vaccines for cocaine treatment was reported 
[69]. A cocaine-like hapten GNE

and a cocaine transition state analog GNT were used to generate the active vaccines 
and GNE–KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Fig. 13.6). KLH is a large, multisub-
unit, oxygen-carrying, metalloprotein. The latter it was found to elicit persistent 
high-titer, cocaine-speciﬁc antibodies, and blunt cocaine-induced locomotor behav-
iors. Catalytic antibodies induced by GNT–KLH were shown to produce potent titers 
and suppress locomotor response in a mice.
Catalytic antibodies with a metalloporphyrin cofactor, hemoabzymes, were 
used as models for hemoproteins like peroxidases and cytochrome P450s, repre-
senting a promising route to catalysts tailored for selective oxidation reactions [39]. 
Research in this direction has led to the following results: (1) Monoclonal antipor-
phyrin antibodies, raised against various N-substituted- and meso-carboxyaryl-
porphyrins showed, in the presence of the corresponding iron-porphyrin cofactor,

a signiﬁcant peroxidase activity; (2) an artiﬁcial hemoprotein obtained by associ-
ating a monoclonal antibody, 13G10, and its iron(III)-α,α,α,β-meso-tetrakis(ortho-
carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (Fe(ToCPP)) hapten, also exhibited this activity; (3) in this 
antibody, a carboxylic acid side chain of the protein participated in the catalysis; and 
(4) the 3A3–MP8 complex can catalyze the selective oxidation of substrates, the 
regioselective nitration of aromatics by NO2−/H2O2 and the stereoselective oxida-
tion of sulﬁdes like thioanisole by H2O2. Data on kinetic efﬁciency of disease-related 
catalytic antibodies were summarized in a comprehensive review [50]. Kinetic studies 
collected in a table indicated that natural catalytic antibodies have measures of Km, 
kcat, and catalytic efﬁciency is found to be similar to those shown by their synthetic 
counterparts. The metal-dependence of catalytic antibodies (catabody) construct 2E6, 
an engineered heterodimer of immunoglobulin light chain variable domains that 
speciﬁcally hydrolyzes amyloid β peptides (Aβ) were designed [69]. The studies 
revealed the following features of the process under study: (1) The electrophilic phos-
phonate inhibitor of serine proteases, the metal chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid (EDTA) and 1,10-phenanthroline 
completely inhibited the hydrolysis of Aβ by catabody 2E6; (2) formation of 
catabody-electrophilic phosphonate inhibitor adducts was unaffected by EDTA; 
(3) the EDTA-inactivated catabody failed to disaggregate ﬁbrillar Aβ, indicating 
the functional importance of the Aβ hydrolytic activity; (4) treating the EDTA-
inactivated catabody with Zn2+ or Co2+ restored the Aβ hydrolytic activity; and

(5) Zn2+-induced catabody conformational transitions were evident by ﬂuorescence 
emission spectroscopy. 
Problems of the design of artiﬁcial hemoproteins that could catalyze selec-
tive oxidations using oxidants O2 or H2O2 under ecocompatible conditions were 
discussed [61]. Several new artiﬁcial hemoproteins that mimic enzymes as heme-
thiolate proteins, cytochromes P450 were introduced. Artiﬁcial hemoproteins 
catalyzed the oxidation of substrates by dioxygen in the presence of electrons deliv-
ered from NADPH by cytochrome P450 reductase. The ﬁrst strategy of the design 
involved the noncovalent association of synthetic hemes with monoclonal antibodies 
raised against these cofactors. Obtained the ﬁrst generation of artiﬁcial hemoproteins, 
hemoabzymes, displayed a peroxidase activity, and catalyzed the regioselective nitra-
tion of phenols by H2O2/NO2 and the stereoselective oxidation of sulﬁdes by H2O2. A  
second generation of hemozymes involved the noncovalent association of affordable 
proteins with metalloporphyrin derivatives. In addition, several artiﬁcial hemopro-
teins were found able to catalyze the stereoselective oxidation of organic compounds 
such as sulﬁdes and alkenes by H2O2. 
The 18B7 monoclonal antibody against glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major 
component of the Cryptococcus neoformans polysaccharide capsule, hydrolyzed 
a peptide antigen mimetic [66]. Using mass spectrometry and Forster resonance 
energy transfer techniques, the hydrolytic activity of 18B7 against peptide mimetics 
was characterized. Speciﬁcally, it was found that: (1) 18B7 is able to hydrolyze 
an oligosaccharide substrate, providing the ﬁrst example of a naturally occurring 
catalytic antibody for polysaccharides; (2) the catalytic 18B7 antibody increased 
release of capsular polysaccharide from fungal cells; (3) a serine protease inhibitor 
blocked peptide and oligosaccharide hydrolysis by 18B7; and (4) a putative serine 
protease-like active site was identiﬁed in the light chain variable region of the anti-
body. In addition, an algorithm was developed to detect similar sites present in unique 
antibody structures in the Protein Data Bank. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is 
an immune checkpoint molecule regulating T-cell function. Preventing cell PD-1 
binding to its ligand PD-L1 has emerged as an important tool in immunotherapy 
and molecule regulating T-cell function [64]. An unique human catalytic antibody 
light chain, H34, which mediates enzymatic degradation of human PD-1 peptides 
and recombinant human PD-1 protein, was examined. This abenzyme prevented the 
binding of PD-1 with PD-L1. Investigating the acquisition of the catalytic function by 
H34 revealed the importance of this sequence. EDTA inhibited the catalytic activity 
of H34, which works as a metalloprotease, while Zn2+ or Co2+ ions may work as a 
cofactor.

chemistry, focusing on self-immolative linkers and the highly electrophilic property 
of QMs enabling them to react rapidly with neighboring nucleophiles. The authors 
established a chemical selection method to select catalytic antibodies with superior 
turnover. The hydrolysis of galactopyranoside was used as a model reaction to select 
catalytic antibodies that catalyze this reaction (Fig. 13.7). The selection process 
included the following stages: (1) The hapten, which mimics the transition state of 
glycosidic bond cleavage, was synthesized; (2) about 100 clones with the ability 
to bind to this hapten using conventional hybridoma methodology (a method for 
producing large numbers of identical antibodies) were selected; (3) after several 
steps, the heavy chain and light chain sequences derived from these clones were 
combinatorially subcloned into the pComb3H vector to form a Fab-phage library 
with approximately 9000 clones in total; (4) the cycle of selection and ampliﬁcation 
of phage in E. coli was repeated four times; (5) the selected vectors were transformed 
into β-galactosidase-deﬁcient XL1-Blue cells to express the selected Fab; 6) these 
transformed cells were cultured on LB agar plates containing X-gal, which reacts with 
β-galactosidase to form blue precipitates; (7) further sorting was performed based 
on the formation of blue precipitates; (8) one of the blue-colored clones named Fab 
1B was selected and its kinetics was analyzed; and (9) the kinetics of Fab 1B and 
the monoclonal antibody (1F4) selected by the hybridoma methodology, targeting 
the originally used hapten against p-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside, was measured, 
and experiments showed kcat = 0.007 min−1, KM = 530 μM (rate enhancement = 7 
× 104), whereas 1F4 showed kcat = 10-5 min−1, KM = 330 μM. 
Fig. 13.7 Mechanism-based panning for the selection of antibodies that can catalyze the hydrolysis 
of a galactopyranoside substrate. Each phage-Fab is illustrated in a variety of colors. The trapping 
device was ﬁrst coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) through a disulﬁde exchange reaction. The 
phage-Fab library was then applied to the plate coated with the trapping device. Only clones that 
catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond could cause quinone methide formation and be trapped. 
Nonbinders and phage that did not bind covalently were removed by washing with buffer and acid, 
respectively. After that, trapped phage-Fab was eluted with dithiothreitol (DTT) and ampliﬁed in 
E. coli [70]. With permission from Elsevier

13.3 Miscellaneous Artiﬁcial Enzymes [70–88] 
Review [76] concerned the development of various types of enzyme mimics, namely 
polymeric and dendrimeric, supramolecular, nanoparticulate, and proteinic enzyme 
mimics, with an emphasis on their synthesis, catalytic properties, and technical appli-
cations. The following requirements to artiﬁcial catalysts and biomacromolecule 
hybrid catalysts as models toward the development of competitive artiﬁcial enzymes 
should be [87]: (1) The conﬁnement of the substrates and the active site within a 
catalytic pocket; (2) the creation of a hydrophobic pocket in water; (3) self-replication 
and allosteric properties; (4) stabilization of the transition state; and (5) favorable 
conformations of the active site and the product(s). The development contributions 
from 2005 to 2014 of catalytic systems in water in the presence of micelles obtained 
by addition of surfactants for the detection of hydrogen peroxide were summarized 
[82]. The effects of these systems on simple, economic, and green reaction media 
aspects like on recyclability, activity, product, and substrate selectivity were in focus 
of the investigation. Surfactants enable formations of nanosized apolar aggregates in 
bulk water, where the catalysts and reagents can be dissolved, which were observed. 
Speciﬁc interactions between substrates, catalysts, and micelles were examined by 
means of NMR and other techniques. Below are some typical examples from this 
area. 
An artiﬁcial enzyme composed of hydrophobic thiazolium and imidazolium coen-
zyme in the presence of modiﬁed-polyethylenimine enzyme mimics catalyzes the 
benzoin 
condensation 2300−3300 times faster than the coenzyme mimics alone [71]. Poly-
cationic enzyme mimics provided a hydrophobic binding domain for coenzyme and 
substrate and electrostatic stabilization of anionic species. Transamination to form 
phenylalanine and alanine from their related keto acids produced enantioselectivities 
was examined, utilizing Poly(amidoamine), PAMAM [72]. The latter is a class of 
dendrimer made of repetitively branched subunits of amide and amine functionality. 
Series of PAMAM dendrimers have been synthesized from two opposite sites on a 
pyridoxamine core and capped with chirally terminal amino groups. The observed 
catalysis and chiral induction demonstrated that a dendrimer with catalytic groups 
remoting from the pyridoxamine unit is a good mimic of transaminase enzymes. 
To investigate transamination by polymeric enzyme mimics, pyridoxamine

linked to a series of permethylated polyethylenimines (Mn = 600, 1800, 10,000, and 
60,000) 
with additional attached dodecyl chains was examined [73]. The transamination 
kinetics of pyruvic acid and of phenylpyruvic acid showed Michaelis–Menten 
behavior and only small variations of the values of k2 and of KM with polymer size. 
A modiﬁed polyethylenimine can be utilized also for decarboxylation, oxidation-
reduction, or hydrolysis reactions. 
A restriction endonuclease is a protein produced by bacteria that cleaves DNA 
at speciﬁc sites along the molecule and can be essential tool for recombinant 
DNA technology. A Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute (Pf Ago), a protein playing a 
central role in RNA silencing processes basing platform for generating artiﬁcial 
restriction enzymes (AREs) capable of recognizing and cleaving DNA sequences 
was designed [75]. Short DNA guides were used to direct Pf Ago to target sites 
for cleavage at high temperatures (> 87 °C). Reannealing of the cleaved single-
stranded DNAs was found to be next step of the process. This ﬁnding was used 
to generate over 18 AREs for DNA ﬁngerprinting and molecular cloning of PCR-
ampliﬁed or genomic DNAs. Simple, sensitive, and stable ﬂuorometric sensors for 
the detection of hydrogen peroxide based on the polyoxotungstate intrinsic peroxi-
dase model (Na10[α-SiW9O34]), inducing ﬂuorescent enhancement of benzoic acid 
(BA), thiamine (TH) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (HPPA) were fabri-
cated [80]. The three nonﬂuorescent substrates BA, TH, and HPPA were oxidized 
with the ·OH radicals decomposed from H2O2 under the catalysis of cluster Na10[α-
SiW9O34]. Laccases are multicopper proteins for dioxygen-involved oxidation of a 
broad spectrum of organic compounds. Recently, novel amyloid-like phenylalanine-
Cu (F-Cu(II)) ﬁbrils as a chemical model of laccases were developed [85]. The model 
was obtained via supramolecular self-assembly of Cu2+ and phenylalanine (F)

13.3 Miscellaneous Artiﬁcial Enzymes [70–88]

under basic conditions via alternating hydrophobic (aromatic environment) and 
hydrophilic (both hydrogen bonding and Cu(II) coordination) interactions [85]. 
The amyloid-like F-Cu(II) architecture exhibited laccase-like afﬁnity (Michaelis 
constant, Km = 0.75 mM) and higher catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km = 773.33 × 
10−3 g−1 min−1 L), t in pH (4 ~ 10), temperature (room temperature ~ 200 °C), 
organic solvent, and long-term storage (> 15 days). In addition, F-Cu(II) ﬁbrils can 
catalyze the oxidation of dopamine (DA) 
to a product with absorption band at 470 nm. 
To improve the catalytic step and turnover for rate acceleration in arbitrary 
synthetic catalysts, through bioinspired studies of natural enzymes new design strate-
gies based on the contributions of nonlocal electric ﬁelds and thermodynamic ﬂuc-
tuations were suggested [86]. The translational impact of natural enzyme principles 
to synthetic enzymes, supramolecular capsules, and electrocatalytic surfaces was in 
focus of consideration. In study [83], peptide ﬁbril-based artiﬁcial hydrolase with 
photoswitchable activity was fabricated. For this purpose, catalytic histidine residue 
and a photoresponsive azobenzene group into the peptide chain were introduced in the 
peptide ﬁbril. An enhanced catalytic activity on p-nitrophenyl acetate and the positive 
proximity effect of the histidine residues and the hydrophobic microenvironment in 
the supramolecular assemblies were observed. The activity of the hydrolase mimic 
can be reversibly controlled using UV and visible light. Opportunities to employ 
peptide-based catalysis to solve stereochemical problems in asymmetric synthesis 
are illustrated in Fig. 13.8 [84]. It was found that peptides provide enantiotopic 
group differentiation in catalytic desymmetrization reactions, that is, remote desym-
metrizations of diarylmethane. In the obtained structure, the enantiotopic groups 
are separated from the prochiral center by ∼6 Å and from one another by nearly 
1 nm. The peptide also catalyzed brominations of pharmaceutically relevant biaryl, 
nonbiaryl, and hetero-biaryl atropisomers, hydroxyl group functionalizations, and 
electrophilic brominations, as well as C–C, C–O, and C–N cross-coupling reactions 
using peptidic ligands on copper(I).
Key features regulating supramolecular order and disorder in peptide-based 
supramolecular systems (Fig. 13.9) were formulated [88]. On the basis highlight 
examples, data on the development of active and adaptive systems by considering 
kinetic and thermodynamic design aspects and combinatorial dynamic covalent and 
noncovalent interactions in the systems peptide-based supramolecular systems were 
presented and discussed in detail. Preorganization and induced ﬁt, which are critical 
to developing materials with adaptive and tunable photonic, electronic, and catalytic 
properties were considered. Open Access license

• The heterochiral tripeptide that forms a robust heterogeneous short peptide cata-
lyst similar to the “histidine brace” active site of lytic polysaccharide monooxyge-
nases was designed [79]. The “histidine brace” is a result of the spatial interaction 
between two histidine residues at the 36th and 135th positions in a typical lytic 
polysaccharide monoxoygenases (LPMO). To create the T-shaped 3N geometry 
at the reaction center, the “histidine brace” formed a conserved divalent copper 
ion-binding motif that comprises two histidine side chains and an amino group 
was constructed (Fig. 13.10). Data on UV–Vis, vis-circular dichroism, Raman, 
solution- and solid-state NMR, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectro-
scopic analyses suggested the following properties of the synthesized complex: 
(1) Distorted square-pyramidal geometry with a 3N coordination at pH 7; (2) 
the 3N coordination in the copper center of the complex; (3) the complex is 
pH-dependent and could catalyze the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in water to 
benzaldehyde with yields up to 82% in 3 h at pH 7 and above at 40 °C; (4) the 
catalyst achieved 100% selectivity for benzaldehyde compared to conventional 
copper catalysis; and (4) the geometry parameters, including a large twist angle 
(73°) between the two imidazole rings of the model complex, were found to be 
identical to those of native lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (72.61°)
