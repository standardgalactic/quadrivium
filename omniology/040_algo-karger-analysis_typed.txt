The	  Minimum	  Cut	  Problem	  
Input: An undirected graph G = (V, E). 
[parallel edges 
     allowed] 
[See other video for representation of input] 
Goal: Compute a cut with fewest number of crossing edges.  
(a min cut)

Random	  Contrac(on	  Algorithm	  
[	  due	  to	  Karger,	  early	  90s]	  
While there are more than 2 vertices: 
•  pick a remaining edge (u,v) uniformly at random  
•  merge (or “contract” ) u and v into a single vertex 
•  remove self-loops 
return cut represented by final 2 vertices.

The	  Setup	  
Question: what is the probability of success? 
Fix a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices, m edges. 
Fix a minimum cut (A, B). 
Let k = # of edges crossing (A, B). (Call these edges F) 

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
What	  Could	  Go	  Wrong?	  
1.  Suppose an edge of F is contracted at some point            
 algorithm will not output (A,B). 
2.   Suppose only edges inside A or inside B get  
  contracted        algorithm will output (A, B). 
Thus:   Pr [ output is (A, B) ] =  Pr [ never contracts an edge of F] 
Let Si = event that an edge of F contracted in iteration i. 
Goal: Compute

The	  First	  Itera(on	  
Key Observation: degree of each vertex is at least k 
Reason: each vertex v defines a cut ({v}. V-{v}). 
Since  
 
     we have  
Since  
# of incident edges 

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
The	  Second	  Itera(on	  
Recall: 
Note: all nodes in contracted graph define cuts in G  
(with at least k crossing edges). 
  all degrees in contracted graph are at least k 
So: # of remaining edges  
So:  
what is this? 

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
All	  Itera(ons	  
In general: 
Problem: low success probability! (But: non trivial)  
recall	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  cuts	  !	   	  

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
Repeated	  Trials	  
Solution: run the basic algorithm a large number N times, 
remember the smallest cut found. 
Question: how many trials needed? 
Let Ti = event that the cut (A, B) is found on the ith try. 
  by definition, different Ti’s are independent 
So:  
By independence ! 

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
If we take 
Repeated	  Trials	  (con’d)	  
Calculus fact: 
So: if we take 
Running time: polynomial in n and m but slow  
But: can get big speed ups ( to roughly         ) with more ideas.
