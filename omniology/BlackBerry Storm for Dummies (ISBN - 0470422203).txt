Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to BlackBerry Storm For Dummies. If you already 
have a BlackBerry Storm, this is a great book to have around when you 
want to discover new features or need something to slap open and use as a 
quick reference. If you don’t have a Storm yet and have some basic questions 
(such as “What is a BlackBerry Storm?” or “How can a BlackBerry Storm help 
me be more productive?”), you can benefit by reading this book cover to cover. 
No matter what your current BlackBerry user status — BUS, for short — we’re 
here to help you get the most out of your BlackBerry Storm.
Right off the bat, we can tell you that a BlackBerry Storm isn’t a fruit you find 
at the supermarket, nor is it related to nasty weather patterns but rather is 
an always-connected handheld device that has e-mail capabilities and a built-
in Internet browser. With your BlackBerry Storm, you’re in the privileged 
position of always being able to receive e-mail and browse the Web.
On top of that, a BlackBerry Storm has all the features you expect from a 
personal organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos. Oh, and 
did we mention that a BlackBerry Storm also has a built-in mobile phone? 
Talk about multitasking! Imagine being stuck on a commuter train: With your 
BlackBerry Storm by your side, you can compose e-mail while conducting a 
conference call — all from the comfort of your seat.
That’s not all. BlackBerry Storm goes a step further to make it more fun for 
you to own this device. You can snap a picture with its camera, record a 
funny video, listen to your music collection, and enjoy watching that video 
on YouTube.
In this book, we show you all the basics and then go the extra mile by high-
lighting some of the lesser-known (but still handy) features of the BlackBerry 
Storm. Your Storm can work hard for you when you need it to and can play 
hard when you want it to. (Need we say that we’re ready, willing, and able to 
show you where to get great games for your BlackBerry Storm?)
About This Book
BlackBerry Storm For Dummies is a comprehensive user guide as well as a 
quick user reference. This book is designed so that you can read it cover to 
cover if you want, but you don’t need to read one chapter after the other.

BlackBerry Storm For Dummies 
Feel free to jump around while you explore the different functionalities of 
your BlackBerry Storm.
We cover basic and advanced topics, but we stick to those that we consider 
the most practical and frequently used. If you use or want to use a certain 
function of your BlackBerry Storm, we likely cover it here.
Who Are You?
In this book, we tried to be considerate of your needs, but because we’ve 
never met you, our image of you is as follows. If you find that some of these 
images are true about you, this might just be the book for you:
 
✓ You have a BlackBerry Storm and you want to find out how to get the 
most from it.
 
✓ You don’t have a BlackBerry Storm yet, and you’re wondering what one 
could do for you.
 
✓ You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume that you know all the 
jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry. (PDA stands for per-
sonal digital assistant, by the way. Take that, you jargon, you!)
 
✓ You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do useful 
and cool things with a BlackBerry Storm without bogging you down with 
unnecessary background or theory.
 
✓ You’re tired of hauling your ten-pound laptop with you on trips, and 
you’re wondering how to turn your BlackBerry Storm into a miniature 
traveling office.
 
✓ You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical 
activities in your life, such as sending and receiving e-mail, checking 
your calendar for appointments, and surfing the Web.
 
✓ You like to have some fun, play games, and be entertained from a device 
but don’t want to carry an extra game gadget on your bag.
What’s in This Book
BlackBerry Storm For Dummies consists of five parts, and each part consists 
of different chapters related to that part’s theme.

 Introduction
Part I: Meeting and Greeting 
Your BlackBerry Storm
Part I starts with the basics of your Storm. You know: What it is, what you 
can do with it, and what the parts are. We describe how you navigate using 
the innovative touch screen that behaves like a button and the difference 
between the QWERTY and SureType keyboard layout. We also show you how 
to personalize and express yourself through your BlackBerry Storm. This 
part wraps up with must-knows about security and where to go for help when 
you get into trouble with your BlackBerry.
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry Storm is also a full-fledged PDA. 
We show you how to get your Storm to keep your contacts in Contacts as well 
as how to manage your appointments and meetings in Calendar. We also show 
you how to take notes and do quick arithmetic calculations on your Storm. As 
you’ll see, most BlackBerry applications interconnect, working hard for you. 
Part III: Getting Multimedia 
and Online with Your Storm
Part III shows you what made BlackBerry what it is today — always-connected 
e-mail. We also get into the other strengths of the BlackBerry — Web surfing 
functionality — but it doesn’t stop there. We also point out how you can use 
other forms of messages on the BlackBerry that you might not have known 
about, such as PIN-to-PIN messages. We also describe the fun features of your 
BlackBerry, such as using its camera, listening to music, and recording and 
watching videos. And rest assured that your BlackBerry will be a good com-
panion when you’re traveling because we also show you how to use its GPS.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager
In Part IV, we detail BlackBerry Desktop Manager and show you some of the 
hoops you can put it through with your BlackBerry Storm, including making 
backups and installing BlackBerry applications from your PC to your Storm. 
You also find out how to port data from your older devices — BlackBerry or 
not — to your new Storm. And we didn’t forget to cover important stuff, such 
as data syncing your appointments and contacts with desktop applications, 
such as Outlook.

Part I
Meeting and Greeting 
Your BlackBerry Storm

In this part . . .
T
he road to a happy and collaborative relationship 
with your BlackBerry Storm starts here. Chapter 1 
covers all the nuts and bolts: how the Storm works, its 
look and feel, and connectivity. Chapter 2 describes how 
you navigate through the virtual keys. Chapter 3 discusses 
customizing your BlackBerry and also how to take care of 
your device.

NOT an Edible Fruit
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out your BlackBerry behind the scenes
▶ Seeing what your BlackBerry can do
▶ Meeting and greeting your BlackBerry
▶ Not sweating the minor stuff
B
ecause you’re reading this book, you probably have a BlackBerry 
Storm (and we’re pretty sure that you’re not eating it). We’re just curi-
ous, though — what actually convinced you to buy this particular handheld 
mobile device? Was it the touch screen? Was it the always-connected e-mail? 
Or the multimedia player to replace your iPod or iPhone? Or was it the really 
good sales pitch? We know; the list could go on and on — and we might 
never hit on the exact reason you got yours. For whatever reason you got 
your BlackBerry, congratulations; you made an intelligent choice.
The same smarts that made you buy your BlackBerry Storm are clearly at 
it again. This time, your intelligence led you to pick up this book, perhaps 
because your intuition told you there’s more to your BlackBerry Storm than 
meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your Storm can help you do more than you supposed. 
For example, your BlackBerry is a whiz at making phone calls, but it’s also a 
computer that can check your e-mail and surf the Web. We’re talking World 
Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help is always at your fingertips rather 
than sitting on some desk at home or at the office. 
 
✓ Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant on the corner? 
 
✓ Need to know — right now — what’s showing in your local movie the-
aters, or what’s coming in the weather tonight, or what’s the best place 
to shop the sales? 
 
✓ Need to know your current location and get directions to that cozy bed 
and breakfast, or retrieve news headlines, or check stock quotes? 

8
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
 
✓ Want to do some online chatting or view some pictures online? 
 
✓ Hankering to network with your old classmates? 
You can do all these things (and more) by using your BlackBerry Storm.
 
Storm is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant (PDA). Out of the box, it 
provides you with the organizational tools you need to set up to-do lists, 
manage your appointments, take care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a phone, an Internet connection, a PDA, 
a GPS, and full-on media player all built into one makes you a powerful 
person. With your Storm (along with this resourceful book), you really can 
increase your productivity and become better organized. Watch out, world! 
BlackBerry Storm-wielding powerhouse coming through!
If you stick with us, you find out all you need to get the most out of your 
device or maybe even save a troubled relationship. (Well, the last one is a bit 
of an exaggeration, but we got your attention, right?)
How It All Works: The 
Schematic Approach
For those who always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t have to go far; 
this little section is just for you.
The role of the network service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry Storm actually works, you might 
also be wondering why you didn’t get your Storm from RIM rather than from 
a network service provider such as Cingular or T-Mobile. Why did you need 
to go through a middle person? After all, RIM makes BlackBerry Storm.
That’s an excellent question — and here’s the quick-and-dirty answer. RIM 
needs a delivery system — a communication medium, as it were — for its tech-
nology to work. Not in a position to come up with such a delivery system all by 
its lonesome, RIM partnered (and built alliances across the globe) with what 
developed into its network service providers — the usual suspects (meaning 
the big cellphone companies). These middlemen support the wireless network 
for your BlackBerry Storm so you can connect to the BlackBerry Internet ser-
vice — and get all those wonderful e-mails (and spend so much valuable time 
surfing the Internet). See Figure 1-1 for an overview of this process.

Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right? In return, 
RIM gave them the right to brand their names on the BlackBerry they offer 
for sale. For example, a T-Mobile BlackBerry looks different from a similar 
model you get from Vodafone. 
 
Which leads to another question: Do BlackBerry functionalities differ from 
phone model to phone model? Quick answer: On the core BlackBerry applica-
tions (such as Tasks and Contracts), you find no major differences. Other fea-
tures, such as Instant Messaging, might or might not be supported by the 
network service provider.
Just to keep the score card straight, when we talk about features available 
from one network service provider that aren’t available from others, we point 
that out.
Connecting to your computer
Nowadays, a personal computer is a household necessity. People spend so 
much time on them, and so much information is stored in them. No surprise 
that BlackBerry works hand-in-hand with your PC. The USB cable that comes 
with your BlackBerry does more than just charge your device. 

10
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
Part IV helps you use your PC connection with the help of BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager and all the utilities that come with it. For instance, Chapter 
17 talks about installing new applications to your BlackBerry with the help of 
your PC. In Chapter 14, you find how to sync your device with the Personal 
Information Manager data that you keep in your PC. You can also read 
Chapter 15 for directions for switching from another device (even a non-
BlackBerry device) to a new BlackBerry. For example, you find out how to 
import your contact list into your new BlackBerry. Last, Chapter 16 tells you 
how to protect your data.
 
If you have a Mac instead of a PC, you can still sync with the PocketMac Sync 
on your Mac. Research In Motion doesn’t actually support the application but 
does provide the software for free.
Oh, the Things You Can Do!
In the BlackBerry world, it used to be that always-connected e-mail was the 
primary factor that made BlackBerry very attractive and is likely first in the 
long list of reasons you got yours. 
Know your BlackBerry history
Your BlackBerry Storm is truly a wondrous 
thing, boasting many features beyond your ordi-
nary mobile phone. And its “sudden” popularity 
didn’t happen overnight. Like any other good 
product, BlackBerry Storm has come a long 
way from its (relatively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the PalmPilot ruled the PDA 
world, Research In Motion (RIM, the maker of 
the BlackBerry) was busy in its lab, ignoring the 
then-popular graffiti input method, and design-
ing a device with a QWERTY keyboard — the 
kind of keyboard people were already used to 
from working on their computers. RIM didn’t 
stop there, however. It added an always-con-
nected e-mail capability, making this device a 
must-have among government officials as well 
as finance and health professionals.
To meet the needs of government officials 
and industry professionals, RIM made reliabil-
ity, security, and durability the priorities when 
manufacturing its devices. Today, BlackBerry 
Storm comes from the same line of RIM family 
products, inheriting all the good genes while 
boosting usability and adding more functions 
to its core BlackBerry applications. As a result, 
BlackBerry is popular among not only prosum-
ers (professional customers) but also con-
sumers. Starting with BlackBerry Pearl, RIM 
has been targeting the mainstream consumer 
market. Clearly, with BlackBerry Storm, RIM is 
winning the hearts of consumers while main-
taining its hold on the enterprise market.

11
 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit 
With Storm you get that, but the touch screen is the center of all attention 
these days. The touch screen on Storm is just a work of art (and science) 
and truly a beautiful part of the device. Just hop off your flight, turn on your 
BlackBerry, and voilà: You can receive and send e-mails whether you’re in 
Hong Kong, London, or Paris. Your significant other can get in touch with you 
wherever you are — just to say hi or to remind you that you promised Aunt 
Edna a case of Chanel No. 5. 
Although e-mail is BlackBerry’s strength, that’s not the only thing it can 
do. This section goes beyond e-mail to point out some of the device’s other 
major benefits.
All-in-one multimedia center
Previously, many people hesitated to buy a BlackBerry due to the lack of 
multimedia functions. They wanted a camera and audio and full video play-
back. BlackBerry Storm has changed all that and has more features than 
you may expect. Not only does Storm have a high-resolution camera — 3.2 
megapixels to be exact — but it also has a memory slot for a microSD chip 
(see Chapter 2). What does that mean? 
Well, it means your BlackBerry can function as the following:
 
✓ A music and video player that support all the common file formats
 
✓ A portable flash drive
 
✓ Your personal photo collection
On top of all that, Storm offers a touch screen virtual QWERTY keyboard. 
Internet at your fingertips
Yup, with the new BlackBerry Web browser on Storm, you can surf the Net 
nearly as smoothly as you do a desktop computer. Even better, you can 
continue chatting with your friends through Instant Messenger, just as if you 
never left your office. You’ll get an alert when your stock is tanking. True, 
that isn’t fun, but you want this information as fast as possible.
Intrigued? Read how Storm can take full advantage of the Web in Chapter 9.

Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have time to 
browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me better organize my 
day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford one, by all means go ahead and hire a per-
sonal assistant. The next best thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA). Just 
like people come in many flavors, so do many PDAs.
Whip out that BlackBerry of yours and take a closer look. That’s right, your 
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA, helping you do all this and much more:
 
✓ Remember all your acquaintances (see Chapter 4)
 
✓ Manage your appointments (Chapter 5)
 
✓ Keep a to-do list (Chapter 6)
A touch-screen PC in the 
palm of your hand
Touch screen? Check. 
Remarkable communication device? Check. 
Full-fledged PDA? Check. 
These capabilities are just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t underestimate the 
device because of its size: Your Storm is also a powerful computer.
Need convincing? Here goes. Out of the box, with no fiddling, it comes with 
a great set of organizational and productivity tools in the form of programs. 
Software developers aside from RIM are taking advantage of this growing 
market — which means hundreds of applications are out there for you. For 
example, you can download graphic-intensive games or a mortgage calculator.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry Storm supports the downloading of appli-
cations through BlackBerry Browser. And of course, downloading can be 
done both wired and wireless (or OTA – over the air). See Chapter 9.
 
To be honest, we’ve no way to foresee how many applications will be on the 
market when you’re reading this book. And the price of an application varies, 
depending on how sophisticated the program is, so we can’t really give firm 
numbers. But if you’re curious, check out Chapter 17 and The Part of Tens, 
where we describe some of the best business applications. You should be able 
to find some treasures suited to your field of work.

 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit 
Look Dad, no hands!
Your Storm is equipped with an earphone that doubles as a mic for hands-
free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s prescription for preventing the 
stiff neck that comes from wedging your Storm against your ear with your 
shoulder. At the minimum, it helps free your hands so you can eat Chinese 
takeout. Some places require you by law to use an earphone while driving 
(but only when you’re talking on a cellphone, of course). 
 
We don’t recommend using your cellphone while driving, hands free or not.
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard wired earphones. BlackBerry also 
supports cool wireless earphones based on Bluetooth technology. How could 
a bizarrely colored tooth help you here? Bluetooth is the name for a (very) 
short-distance wireless technology that connects devices. See Chapter 11 for 
how to connect your BlackBerry to a Bluetooth headset.
Chewing on Hardware
Reliability and quality were probably your main concerns when you decided 
on BlackBerry Storm. Will the product last? Will it perform like the manufac-
turer says? Will I regret having bought this item six months down the road? 
This section looks at some of the hardware features that make buying the 
BlackBerry device a wise purchase.
Saving power
Anyone with BlackBerry experience knows it’s a highly efficient power 
consumer.
The addition of a colored, high-resolution touch screen has weakened the 
power efficiency. Power requirements have increased so much that you need 
to recharge roughly every two days.
But hey, now you have a GPS on deck! We know frequent recharging is a bit 
of a hassle. A section in Chapter 3 gives tips on prolonging your battery’s life, 
especially when you’re traveling.

Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
Putting a sentry on duty
The virtual world isn’t exempt from general human nastiness; in fact, every 
day a battle is fought between those who are trying to attack a system and 
those who are trying to protect it.
A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk of being cracked by 
a hacker or infected by a virus. Viruses try to replicate themselves and gener-
ally bug you.
Fortunately, security is a BlackBerry strong point. Viruses often come as 
e-mail attachments. However, BlackBerry supports very few file types out of 
the box (mostly images and documents). You won’t face threats from e-mails 
with these attachments. And data that you send to or get from the PDA is 
encrypted (coded) to prevent snooping.

Chapter 2
Navigating the BlackBerry
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out the features of your BlackBerry
▶ Finding out how to type with your BlackBerry keyboards
You might have heard that BlackBerry Storm is different. From the out-
side, BlackBerry Storm has been completely revamped. Not only is it 
sleek and slim, it has a brighter, bigger, and higher-resolution screen than 
the older models. But what makes it fundamentally different? It has a touch 
screen.
What? No more trackball? No more QWERTY keyboard? How do you select 
and scroll with the touch screen? What can you do with it? We answer 
those questions in this chapter. Bear with us and you will be master of your 
BlackBerry Storm in no time.
Exploring Your BlackBerry’s Face
In this section we show you all the keys and features on your BlackBerry 
Storm. You can see them in Figure 2-1.
First, read about the major features:
 
✓ Touch screen: The graphical user interface (GUI) on your BlackBerry 
Storm. Lets you point to things using your finger instead of having to type.
 
✓ Virtual QWERTY keyboard: This is available on the Storm while you’re 
typing when you tilt the screen on its side (horizontally). You see all the 
keys individually as you would on a QWERTY BlackBerry.
 
✓ Virtual SureType keyboard: This keyboard layout shows while you’re 
typing with your Storm in its upright (vertical) position. Each virtual 
SureType key contains two letters.

✓ Convenience keys: Your BlackBerry Storm has two convenience keys. 
By default, the convenience keys are preprogrammed to open an appli-
cation. In Chapter 3, we show you how to reprogram the convenience 
keys to display the programs you use the most.

 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
 
✓ microSD slot: You can access the microSD slot by removing the back 
cover, but without removing the battery. The microSD slot is a crucial 
element to your BlackBerry media experience.
 
✓ Send key: This key takes you straight to the Phone application, regard-
less of which application you’re currently using. If you’re already in the 
Phone application, the send key starts dialing the number you entered.
 
✓ End key: Use this key to end your call. If not on a phone call, this key 
allows you to jump straight back to the Home screen from wherever 
you are.
 
✓ Power key: Press and hold the Power key to turn your BlackBerry on or 
off. Or you can do press and hold the Turn Power Off icon.
 
✓ Mute key: Mutes a call when on a call.
 
✓ Lock key: Quickly locks the BlackBerry screen. You’d use this when 
you want to put your BlackBerry in your pocket and prevent accidental 
typing, for instance. 
Using the Touch Screen
When you first turn on your BlackBerry, the display screen displays the 
Home screen, which is your introduction to your BlackBerry Storm’s GUI. The 
different icons represent the different applications in your BlackBerry. 
 
If you tilt your BlackBerry sideways, the screen follows you.
We use these terms to show you how to interact with your BlackBerry Storm.
 
✓ Tap is a light touch. It allows you to highlight a choice in a list or place 
the typing cursor in a particular place. Tapping does not, however, 
select or confirm a choice.
 
✓ Touch-press by firmly touching and pressing on something to select it. 
 
✓ Finger scroll by keeping your finger on the touch screen and moving 
up, down, left, or right on the screen. You scroll to different parts of the 
screen.
Applications have a row of icons on the bottom of the screen. You can access 
these shortcuts without using the menu key. If this is your first touch-screen 
device, play and have fun with it. Trust us; it won’t bite.

Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
Tapping the Keyboards: 
QWERTY and SureType
Surprised? Just when you thought the term QWERTY wasn’t going to be part 
of this book, it is. That’s right. In the following sections, we talk about the 
onscreen — or virtual — keyboards that you use to enter information.
Virtual QWERTY keyboard
You see the virtual QWERTY keyboard appear if you tilt your BlackBerry 
Storm sideways while entering text into a text field. See Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2: 
This 
BlackBerry

its virtual 
QWERTY 
keyboard.
 
 
You can hide the virtual keyboard by pressing the menu key and touch-pressing 
Hide Keyboard.
Whether you use your pinky or your index finger, how you type on your 
BlackBerry is up to you. However, most people find that typing with two 
thumbs is the most efficient way to type on a BlackBerry Storm. And like the 
SureType keyboard with its Custom Dictionary, the QWERTY keyboard helps 
you as you type so you can get the word out (literally) with less keystrokes.
Virtual SureType keyboard
The SureType keyboard appears when you hold your BlackBerry Storm 
upright (vertical). Many keys share letters, as shown in Figure 2-3. The idea is 
that SureType is smart enough to figure out what letter you want. Basically, 
you can type with only one thumb, and your BlackBerry learns the words 
that you frequently use.

19
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
For example, if you want to type the word hi, press the GH key and then the 
UI key. SureType lists the words it thinks you’re typing, as shown in Figure 
2-3. If the first word is what you want, simply touch the word onscreen or the 
virtual Space key. The word is selected and you can keep typing. If what you 
want appears a little later in the list, finger scroll to the word and touch it. 
 
Figure 2-3: 
Did you 
want to type 
Hi or gi?
 
 
These tips can speed up your SureType learning curve:
 
✓ Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way, SureType 
learns what you want to type next time.
 
✓ If SureType correctly gets the word you’re typing (on the first try), use 
the Space key to move on.
 
✓ Take advantage of Custom Dictionary, which is a list of words that you 
define. More on this later in this section.
 
✓ Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type, the more 
you use it, the faster it adapts.
Multitap
Besides SureType, you can type in another mode while BlackBerry is upright: 
multitap. 
The best way to explain multitap is by example. Say you want to type an h 
character on the virtual SureType keyboard. You search out the h on your 
keyboard but notice the key reads GH. What’s a person to do? Do you really 
want to go through life writing GHello for Hello?

20
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
 
Your problem has a perfectly easy solution. To get the letter g, tap the GH key 
once. To get the letter h — the second letter on the key — tap the key twice — 
hence the term multitap.
Custom Dictionary
SureType keeps all its learned words in a safe place — a Wordlist, to be pre-
cise. You can review your SureType Wordlist — and even add to it — using 
the Custom Dictionary option. 
 
Using the Custom Dictionary option to add words or proper names to the list 
means that SureType doesn’t have to learn them when you’re actually typing.
To see or add words by using the Custom Wordlist option, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then touch-press the 
options icon.
 
2. Select Custom Dictionary.
 
 The Custom Dictionary opens, where all the words that SureType has 
learned are listed. (If you purchased your BlackBerry recently, there 
might be only a few words or even no words in this list, depending on 
how often you’ve used SureType mode to type.)
 
3. Press the menu key and then touch-press New.
 
4. To save your changes, press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
Getting people’s names right is tough with SureType, but thankfully you can 
make sure that SureType automatically learns all the names in Contacts as 
follows:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then touch-press the 
options icon.
 
2. Touch-press Localization.
 
 The Localization option screen appears, where the handy Input Option 
button makes its home.
 
3. Touch-press the Input Option button.
 
 The Fast Options screen displays with the following options:
 
• Auto Word Learning: If turned on, SureType learns as you type.
 
• Use Address Book as Data Source: If turned on, SureType learns all 
the names in your Contacts.
 
4. Make sure the Use Address Book as Data Source option is turned on.
 
 If it isn’t, touch-press On from the drop-down list.
 
5. To save your changes, press the menu key and then touch-press Save.

 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
Physical Keys and More
Although most of the key entry on the Storm is done through the onscreen 
keyboards (see the “Tapping the Keyboards: QWERTY and SureType” sec-
tion), there are a few physical keys to help you navigate the user interface of 
your Storm quicker.
Escape key
Simple yet useful, the escape key allows you to return to a previous screen or 
cancel a selection. The escape key is the arrow key to the left of the End Key.
Menu key (BlackBerry key)
The menu key brings up the full menu for the application you are using. 
When you’re on the Home screen, pressing the menu key displays a list of 
applications installed on your BlackBerry. If you want to change the order of 
the applications in the list, see Chapter 3.
Convenience keys
Your BlackBerry Storm has two convenience keys, one on the left and one 
on the right. By default, the right convenience key opens the Camera and 
the left convenience key opens the voice command application. Think of 
these two keys as shortcuts to the application you need fast access to. You 
can program and change these keys to open whatever is installed on your 
BlackBerry; see Chapter 3 for more info.
microSD slot
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with tons of internal memory: 1GB to be exact. 
If you’re a music or video fan, you know that 1GB isn’t enough to hold any-
thing entertaining. But no need to worry. The folks at Research In Motion 
incorporated a microSD (external memory card) slot into your BlackBerry 
Storm so you can add memory and store all the media files you want in your 
BlackBerry Storm.
You can purchase a microSD card separately for a relatively low price these 
days. At the time of this writing, a 4GB microSD card costs $20.

Switching applications
When you are moving around in an application (such as Browser), an option 
called Switch Application appears when you press the menu key. Switch 
Application, which is similar to Alt+Tab under Windows, lets you multitask 
between applications; see Figure 2-4.

If you always use a particular application, such as Tasks, you can program the 
convenience key so you can get to your favorite application even more quickly 
than by using the Switch Application function.

ou want to have your BlackBerry around as long as you possibly can. 
(Or, at least until you have the bucks for that way-cool new model that’s 
coming down the pike.) And, for the time that you do have your device, you’ll 
want to trick it out. (C’mon, admit it — your BlackBerry is definitely a fashion 
statement.)
In addition to customizing, you want to keep your BlackBerry in tip-top shape 
by watching out for things such as battery life and information security. 
Luckily for you, this chapter fills you in on all you need to know to keep your 
BlackBerry Storm a finely tuned (and yet quirkily personal) little SmartPhone.
Making Your BlackBerry Yours
BlackBerry devices are increasingly popular — so much so that close to 
20 million BlackBerrys are out there serving the needs of people like you. 
Because of this fact, we’re certain that finding ways to distinguish your 
BlackBerry from your colleagues’ is high on your list of priorities.
Your wish is our command. Follow the tips and techniques outlined in this 
section and you, too, can personalize to your heart’s content.
Branding your BlackBerry
Like any number of other electronic gadgets that you could possibly own, 
your BlackBerry comes to you with a collection of settings. This section 
helps you put your name on your BlackBerry, both figuratively and literally. 

24
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
You can start by branding your name on your BlackBerry:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press Owner options.
 
 You see places to enter your owner information.
 
3. Enter your name in the Name field and your contact information in 
the Information field.
 
 Phrase a message that would make sense to any possible Good Samaritan 
who might find your lost BlackBerry and want to get it back to you.
 
 If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry for a while, the standby screen 
displays the owner information that you entered. Read how to lock your 
BlackBerry, either manually or by using an auto setting, as described in 
the later section, “Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe.”
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Choose a language, any language
Set the language to your native tongue so you don’t need to hire a translator 
to use your BlackBerry. You can also set your input method of choice here, 
which can affect whether AutoText shows up. Don’t worry. We explain what 
that means in the next section.
Here’s how you choose a language:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press Localization (or Language) option.
 
 Here you can choose the language and input method.
 
3. Touch-press the Language field and then select your native (or pre-
ferred) tongue.
 
 Language choices vary depending on your network provider and region 
(North America, Europe, and so on). Most handhelds sold in North 
America default to English or English (United States).
 
 If your network provider supports it, you can install more languages into 
your BlackBerry by using Application Loader in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager. For more information on Application Loader, see Chapter 17.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
 Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s on the screen? But don’t 
think that you’re finished quite yet. You still have some personalizing 
to do.

25
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
Typing with ease using AutoText
Even the most devoted BlackBerry user has to admit that typing on a full 
keyboard is easier than thumb typing on a BlackBerry. To even the score a 
bit, your BlackBerry Storm comes with an AutoText feature, which is a kind 
of shorthand.
 
AutoText basically works with a pool of abbreviations that you set up. Then 
you type an abbreviation to get the word you associated with that abbrevia-
tion. For example, after setting up b/c as an AutoText word for because, 
anytime you type b/c, you automatically get because onscreen.
 
The whole AutoText thing works only if you set up your own personal code, 
mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is why we’re discussing 
AutoText as part of our personalization discussion.) 
To set up your own code, do the following:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press AutoText option.
 
 You can choose to see (or search for) existing AutoText words or create 
new ones.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press New.
 
 The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Create 
AutoText 
here.
 
 
4. In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to replace. 
 
5. In the With field, type what replaces your characters. 
 
6. Choose between two options in the Using field:
 
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context calls for 
that, such as the first word in a sentence.

26
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
 
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact text found in 
the With field.
 
 For example, say you have the AutoText bbg set up for the term 
blackberryGoodies.com, and you want it to appear as is, in terms of 
letter cases (the first b is lowercase). If you choose SmartCase for this 
AutoText entry, and it’s the first word in a sentence, the word is 
capitalized; that isn’t what you want. On the other hand, if you use 
Specified Case, your AutoText always appears as blackberryGoodies.com 
no matter where it is in the sentence.
 
7. Scroll to the Language field and touch-press All Locales.
 
 We prefer All Locales because regardless of the language input method 
(for example, French), any self-created AutoText is available for you to 
use. In the case of the AutoText bbg (blackberryGoodies.com), you can 
use this AutoText whether you’re typing in French or Chinese. On the 
other hand, if you select only the French input method for bbg as the 
Language field, you could use this only if your input method is set to 
French in the Language option.
 
 You can choose the input method of your choice in the Language 
options. We go over choosing a language input method next.
 
8. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
If you specify a language input method other than All Locales, your input 
method setting in the Language option must match the Language field in 
AutoText to use your newly created AutoText:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press Localization (or Language) option.
 
 Here you can choose the language and input method.
 
3. Select the Input Method field and then select the input method you 
need from the list.
 
 For your new AutoText setting to work (assuming that you didn’t choose 
All Locales as the language for your AutoText), this option needs to 
match the input method set in your Language option.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Inserting text shortcuts
If you frequently give out your BlackBerry phone number or PIN in e-mails, 
you’ll appreciate what we call text shortcuts. Basically, you can use the 
AutoText feature to add a customized word for preset items — things such 
as your BlackBerry number, PIN, or just the date — so you don’t have to type 
them all the time.

27
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
 
Keep in mind that we’re talking about your BlackBerry PIN here — your 
device’s unique identifying number — and not the PIN someone would use to 
empty out your checking account with the help of one of those automated tell-
ers. For more on BlackBerry PINs, see Chapter 8.
To add a text shortcut for your phone number, for example, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Bring up the AutoText screen.
 
 AutoText is an option in Options.
 
2. Type an appropriate word in the Replace field.
 
 mynum would work nicely.
 
3. Touch-press the With field and type “my number is.
 
4. Press the menu key and choose Insert Macro.
 
 You’re prompted with a pop-up to select from a list of preset items. 
 
5. Select the Phone Number (%p) option.
 
6. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
7. Test your AutoText by drafting a simple e-mail and type mynum.
Customizing your screen’s look and feel
You can get the display font, font size, and screen contrast to your liking. 
Now we know that some of you don’t give a hoot if your fonts are Batang or 
Bookman as long as you can read the text, but we also know that some of you 
won’t stop configuring the fonts until you get them absolutely right. 
For all you tweakers out there, here’s how you play around with your 
BlackBerry’s fonts:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press Screen/Keyboard.
 
 The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various customizable fields, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
3. Touch-press the Font Family field and then touch-press a font from the 
drop-down list.
 
4. Continuing down the Screen/Keyboard screen, touch-press the Font 
Size field, and then touch-press a font size.
 
 The smaller the font size, the more you can see onscreen; however, a 
small font is harder on the eyes.

28
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
 
 Note: As you finger scroll up and down the list of fonts and font sizes, 
notice that the text “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” in 
the background takes on the look of the selected font and size so that 
you can preview what the particular text looks like.
 
Figure 3-2: 
The Screen/
Keyboard 
screen is 
waiting for 
personaliza-
tion.
 
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
Similar to setting font size, you can also play with font style to set it to bold, 
italic, or neither. At this point, you’re probably wondering what Antialias 
Mode is for. Think of antialias as a way your BlackBerry renders alphabet 
characters. With No Antialiasing set, your fonts have round edges. With 
Antialiasing set, your fonts have sharp edges. The difference between the two 
settings is subtle.
With fonts out of the way, it’s time to change the brightness of your screen 
as well as a few other viewing options, including how to program the conve-
nience keys so every time you press it, the convenience key opens the appli-
cation that you use most often:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press Screen/Keyboard.
 
3. Touch-press the Backlight Brightness field and then select the desired 
brightness from the drop-down list.
 
 You can choose from 10 to 100, where 10 is the darkest and 100 is the 
brightest.

29
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
 
4. Touch-press the Convenience Key Opens field. 
 
5. Touch-press an application that you want the convenience key to open.
 
 Typically, we like to set these keys to open applications that we often 
need, like the Browser application or the Task application.
 
6. Touch-press the Backlight Timeout field and choose an amount of time.
 
 You can choose from ten seconds up to two minutes. The lower this set-
ting, the less time you’ll have backlighting (after you press each key). 
However, a low setting helps you conserve battery life.
 
7. Touch-press the Tap Interval field and decide how sensitive you want 
the tap to be.
 
 You can choose from 100 to 500, where 100 is the most sensitive and 500 
is the least sensitive.
 
8. Touch-press the Hover Period field and decide how sensitive you want 
your touch on the touch screen to be.
 
 Here, 100 is the most sensitive and 1000 is the least sensitive. Keep in 
mind that if your setting is too sensitive, it might be hard to control.
 
 When you hover your finger over an icon or link without touch-pressing 
the screen, a small yellow text box appears giving you hints at what you 
can expect by touch-pressing the icon.
 
9. To confirm your changes, press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Choosing themes 
Your BlackBerry is preloaded with different themes, which are predefined 
sets of looks (wallpaper, fonts, menu layout) for your BlackBerry. You can 
download themes from BlackBerry’s mobile Web site.
Regardless of what BlackBerry model you have, follow these steps to change 
your theme:
 
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press the Theme option.
 
 You see a list of available themes; your Storm may come with only one 
theme, but you can always download more.
 
3. Touch-press the theme you want.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Activate.
 
 You see the change after a short wait.

30
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
 
You can download other themes. Just remember that you have to use your 
BlackBerry, not your PC, to access the following URLs:
 
✓ http://mobile.blackberry.com
 
✓ http://blackberrywallpaper.com
Wallpapering 
Like your desktop PC, you can customize the BlackBerry Home screen with 
personalized wallpaper.
You set an image to be your BlackBerry Home screen background by using 
the BlackBerry Media application:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press the Media 
application.
 
 The Media application opens, where you see different categories: Music, 
Video, Ring tones, and Pictures.
 
2. Touch-press the Picture category.
 
 Doing so brings up three lines: 
 
• All Pictures shows you a thumbnail view of all your photos — the 
ones you took and the ones that came with your BlackBerry Storm.
 
• Picture Folders lists the folders that contain photos, as well as a 
thumbnail list of the photos.
 
• Sample Pictures shows you a thumbnail view of the pictures that 
came with your BlackBerry Storm.
 
3. Touch-press All Pictures.
 
4. Touch-press the picture you want to use for your Home screen 
wallpaper.
 
 The selected picture appears in full-screen view.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Set as Home Screen Image.
 
 The picture is now your new Home screen wallpaper. 
 
6. Press and hold the escape key to return to the Home screen and see 
the result.
 
 If you hold your BlackBerry Storm in its upright (vertical) position, you 
see your new wallpaper.
 
You can download free wallpaper here as long as you use your BlackBerry, not 
your PC, to access the URLs:

After you have your BlackBerry’s look and feel just the way you want, do one 
more thing before you move on: Get your BlackBerry sounding the way you 
want it to.
Ringing freedom
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that this little elec-
tronic device can make your life easier. One of the ways it accomplishes this 
is by acting as your personal reminder service — letting you know when an 
appointment is coming up, a phone call is coming in, an e-mail has arrived, and 
so on. Basically, your BlackBerry is set to bark at you if it knows something it 
thinks you should know too. Figure 3-3 lists the kinds of things your BlackBerry 
considers bark-worthy, ranging from Browser alerts to Tasks deadlines.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Set 
attention-
needy 
applications 
here.
 
Different people react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry barks 
would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population, whereas 
other segments might react to the same sound by pitching their BlackBerry 
under the nearest bus. The folks at Research In Motion are well aware of this 
fact and have devised a great way for you to customize how you want your 
BlackBerry to bark at you — they call it your profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined profile.

32
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
Checking out the different profiles
Each profile is divided into seven categories that represent the application 
for which you can define alerts:
 
✓ Browser: Alerts you when you receive a new channel push, which is a 
Web page sent to your BlackBerry as an icon on your Home screen.
 
✓ Calendar: Alerts you when you have upcoming appointments.
 
✓ Level1 Messages (urgent e-mail messages): Alerts you with a special 
tone when you have an urgent e-mail (e-mail with an important or pri-
ority flag). Also, a BlackBerry PIN-to-PIN message can be considered 
urgent. For more on PIN-to-PIN, see Chapter 8.
 
✓ Messages: Alerts you when a new e-mail message is in your inbox.
 
✓ Phone: Alerts you if there is an incoming call or a new voice mail.
 
✓ SMS: Alerts you when you have an SMS message.
 
✓ Tasks: Alerts you of an upcoming to-do deadline.
You can personalize the alert on all the listed applications. Because the way 
you customize them is similar, we use one application (Messages) as an 
example in the text that follows, as we customize a predefined profile that 
comes with your BlackBerry.
Customizing a predefined profile
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded profile, just do 
the following:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the Profile application.
 
 A screen lists different profiles: Quiet, Vibrate, Normal. See Figure 3-4.
 
2. Touch-press Set Ring Tones/Alerts.
 
 A screen lists different applications. Note that you are setting the ring 
tones/alerts for whatever profile that is currently in selection. For 
example, if you’re currently using Normal, when you touch-press Set 
Ring Tones/Alerts, you are modifying the Normal profile’s setting.
 
3. Touch-press the Message [Email] application.
 
 If you have multiple e-mail accounts routed to your BlackBerry, you can 
set settings for each.
 
4. Touch-press the Ring Tone field and then touch-press a tune from the 
drop-down list.
 
 Doing so enables sound when e-mail arrives for this e-mail account. If 
you want any sounds to play, you can choose this in the Volume field.

33
 Chapter 3: Whipping Up a Storm of Your Own
 
Figure 3-4: 
A Profile 
application 
helps you 
personalize.
 
 
5. Touch-press the Volume field and then touch-press to select the 
volume level you desire.
 
 You can choose from silent to 10 for loudest. 
 
6. Touch-press the Vibration field and then touch-press Custom.
 
 This brings out more options for vibration. You can control 
 
• How many vibrations each e-mail triggers
 
• Vibration duration
 
• Whether you want the vibration to happen when your Storm is in 
its holster 
 
7. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
 As mentioned, you can do the same to personalize other applications 
listed in each profile.
 
Maybe you get a lot of e-mail. You probably don’t want your BlackBerry 
sounding off 200 times a day. Set your BlackBerry Storm to notify you only 
if an e-mail is marked urgent, requiring your immediate attention. Set the 
notification for your Messages application to None for both In Holster and 
Out of Holster. Then in the Level1 option, set notification for both In Holster 
and Out of Holster. 

34
Part I: Meeting and Greeting Your BlackBerry Storm 
Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe
 
The folks at Research In Motion take security seriously, and so should you. 
Always set up a password on your BlackBerry. If your BlackBerry hasn’t 
prompted you to set up a password, you should immediately do so. 
Here’s how it’s done:
 
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, touch-press the options icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press Password.
 
3. Touch-press Disable Settings and select Enabled.
 
4. Touch-press Security Timeout and select a time.
 
 Choose anywhere from 1 minute up to 1 hour.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
 You’re prompted for a password.
 
6. Type a password, and then type it again for verification.
 
 From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry and want to 
use it again, you have to type the password. If you don’t use your 
BlackBerry, it locks according to Security Timeout setting.
 
 Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a password 
won’t help much if you don’t take the further step of locking your BlackBerry 
when you’re not using it. (You don’t want people at the office or sitting at the 
next table at the coffee shop checking out your e-mails or phone history when 
you take a bathroom break, do you?) How do you lock your BlackBerry? Press 
the menu key, and then touch-press the Lock icon on the Home screen.

Getting Organized 
with Your Storm

In this part . . .
T
his part covers how to use your BlackBerry Storm to 
its fullest to get you — and keep you — organized. 
Peruse the chapters here to find out how to use your 
Contacts applications, keep appointments, keep on track 
with to-do lists, do arithmetic calculations, and make notes.

Chapter 4
Remembering and Locating 
Your Acquaintances
In This Chapter
▶ Adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts
▶ Finding a contact in Contacts
▶ Organizing Contacts
▶ Sharing BlackBerry Storm’s contacts
▶ Transferring contacts to your BlackBerry Storm
A
ddress books were around long before the BlackBerry was conceived. 
Your BlackBerry Storm Contacts serves the same function as any other: 
to record and organize information about people. It also gives you a central 
place to reach your contacts by landline phone, cellphone, e-mail, or the 
speedy messaging of PIN, SMS, MMS, or BlackBerry Messenger.
You can benefit from using your BlackBerry Contacts if any of the following 
fit you and your lifestyle:
 
✓ You travel.
 
✓ You meet clients frequently.
 
✓ You spend a lot of time on the phone.
 
✓ You ask people for their phone number or e-mail address more than 
once.
 
✓ You carry around a paper day planner.
 
✓ Your wallet is full of important business cards, with phone numbers 
written on the backs, that you can never find.
If you’re one of those stubborn folks who insist they don’t need an address 
book — “I’m doing just fine without one, thank you very much!” — think of 
it this way: You’ve been using a virtual address book all the time — the one 

38
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
buried in your cellphone. And that address book often isn’t even a very good 
one! Read this chapter to see how to transfer all that good contact info from 
an old phone into your new BlackBerry-based Contacts.
Accessing Your Contacts
The Contacts icon looks like an old-fashioned address book. (Remember 
those?) If you have a hard time locating it, Figure 4-1 shows what it looks like. 
Opening Contacts couldn’t be simpler: Just touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The 
Contacts 
icon.
 
You can access Contacts from Phone, Messages, BlackBerry Messenger, and 
Calendar. For example, say you’re in Calendar and you want to invite people 
to one of your meetings. Look no further — Contacts is in the menu, ready to 
lend a helping hand.
Cleaning Your Contacts
Getting a new gizmo is always exciting; your new toy is full of features you’re 
dying to try out. Calling someone was probably the first thing you wanted to 
do with your new BlackBerry Storm. But wait a second. You’ll have to type 
the phone number not just this time, but each time you want to call. What a 
hassle.

39
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
Most people — social creatures that we are — keep a list of contacts 
somewhere like an e-mail program, an old cellphone, or on a piece of paper 
(tucked away in a wallet). We’re pretty sure you have some kind of list 
somewhere. The trick is getting that list into your BlackBerry Storm so you 
can access the info more efficiently. The good news is that getting the 
information into your BlackBerry Storm isn’t hard.
 
Often the simplest way to get contact information into your BlackBerry Storm 
is to enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot of time keeping the 
information updated on your desktop computer, you might want to hot sync 
that data into your BlackBerry Storm. For more on synchronizing data, check 
Chapter 14. 
Creating a contact
Imagine you’ve just run into Jane, an old high-school friend you haven’t seen 
in years. Jane wants to give you her number, but you don’t have a pen handy. 
Are you forced to chant her phone number to yourself until you can scare up 
a writing implement? Not if you have your handy BlackBerry Storm on you.
With BlackBerry Storm in hand, follow these steps to create a new contact:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
 Contacts opens. You can also access Contacts from different 
applications. For example, check Chapter 7 on how to access Contacts 
from Messages.
 
2. Touch-press the plus icon located in the bottom of the screen.
 
 The New Contact screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Create a 
new contact 
here.
 
 
3. Enter the contact information in the appropriate fields.

40
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
 
 Use your BlackBerry Storm virtual keyboard to enter contact information. 
Hold the device sideways (landscape) to get the full QWERTY keyboard. 
When entering an e-mail address, press the Space key to insert an at 
symbol (@) or a period (.).
 
 We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact 
information. Enter as much info as you possibly can. Maybe the benefit 
won’t be obvious now, but when your memory fails or your boss needs 
a critical piece of data that you happen to have, you’ll thank us for this 
advice.
 
 To create another new, blank e-mail field for the same contact, press the 
menu key and touch-press Add Email Address. You can have up to three 
e-mail addresses per contact.
 
 BlackBerry Storm can dial an extension after the initial phone number. 
When entering the phone number, type the primary phone number, 
touch-press P on the virtual keyboard, and add the extension number.
 
4. Press the menu key.
 
5. Touch-press Save.
 
 Jane is added to the list, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The 
Contacts 
screen 
shows your 
new con-
tact.
 
 
The menu is always available through the menu key. The application is smart 
enough to figure out which items are more relevant based on what you’re 
doing. You can always touch-press the full menu listing.
Taking notes
The Notes field in the New Address screen (you might need to scroll down a 
bit to see it) is useful for adding a unique description about your contact. For 
example, use the field to jog your memory with tidbits such as Knows some-
body at ABC Corporation or Can provide introduction to a Broadway agent. Or 
perhaps your note is something personal, such as Likes golf; has 2 children: 
boy, 7 & girl, 3; husband’s name is Ray. It’s up to you. Again, the more useful 
the information, the better it serves you.

41
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
Adding your own fields
Perhaps your contact information doesn’t fit into any of the available fields. 
Although you can’t create fields from scratch, you can commandeer one of 
the User fields for your own purposes.
The User fields are at the bottom of the screen; you have to scroll down to 
see them. Use these fields any way you want; you can even change the field’s 
name. For example, you can rename User fields to capture suffixes (such as 
MD, PhD, and so on). Or how about these tidbits:
 
✓ Profession
 
✓ Hobbies
 
✓ School
 
✓ Nickname
 
Keep in mind that changing the Users field name for a particular contact 
changes it for all your contacts.
Follow along to rename a User field:
 
1. While editing a contact, scroll to the bottom of the screen to navigate 
to one of the User fields.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Change Field Name.
 
 Note: The Change Field Name selection on the menu appears only if the 
cursor is in a User field.
 
4. Use the virtual keyboard to type the new name.
 
5. Touch-press the enter key.
 
6. Press the menu key.
 
7. Touch-press Save.
 
 You’re all set.
Adding a picture to a contact
Most phones can display a picture of whoever’s calling; BlackBerry Storm is 
no stranger to this neat feature.
 
1. Have a picture of the person.
 
 See Chapter 11 for more about taking photos with your BlackBerry

Assigning a tone
Oh no, your ringing BlackBerry has woken you. Ring tones help you decide 
whether to ignore the call or get up. Hopefully, you can easily switch yourself 
to sleep mode if you ignore the call.

43
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
Follow these steps to assign a ring tone to one of your contacts:
 
1. While editing a contact, touch-press Phone under the Custom Ring 
Tones/Alerts portion of the Edit Contact screen (refer to left of 
Figure 4-5).
 
Figure 4-5: 
Left: start-
ing place to 
customize 
ring tone; 
right: select-
ing the ring 
tone.
 
 
 A screen similar to the right of Figure 4-5 gives you an option to customize 
the ring tone settings. From this screen, you can select which ring tone 
to use, set the volume, control whether to make the LED blink, make the 
phone vibrate, and whether the setting works while on a call.
 
2. Touch-press the tone settings you want.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
4. Touch-press Save.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Save.
Adding contacts from other 
BlackBerry applications
When you get an e-mail message or a call, that person’s contact information 
is in Messages or Phone. It’s just logical to add the information.
You might’ve noticed that Phone lists only outgoing numbers. That’s half 
of what you need. Oddly enough, you can access incoming phone calls in 
Messages.
 
 
1. Touch-press Messages from Home screen.
 
 
 Messages opens.

44
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
3. Touch-press View Folder.
 
4. Touch-press Phone Call Logs.
 
A phone log entry stays as long as you have free space in your BlackBerry 
Storm. When BlackBerry runs out of space (which could take years, depending 
on how you use it), it deletes read e-mails and phone logs, starting from the 
oldest.
Creating a contact from an existing e-mail address or phone number in 
Messages is easy.
 
 
1. Touch-press Messages from Home screen.
 
 
 Messages opens.
 
2. Touch-press the e-mail address or the phone number.
 
 A menu appears.
 
3. Touch-press Add to Contacts.
 
 A new New Contact screen appears, filled with that particular piece of 
information.
 
4. Enter the rest of the information you know.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Save.
This is just one more sign of BlackBerry’s ongoing attempt to make your life 
easier.
Viewing a contact
You just entered your friend’s name into your BlackBerry, but you have 
this nagging thought that you typed the wrong phone number. You want to 
quickly view the information. Here’s how you do it:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Scroll to and touch-press the contact name you want.
 
 Touching the name is the same as opening the menu and choosing 
View — just quicker.

45
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
 View mode displays only information that’s been filled in, as shown in 
Figure 4-6. It doesn’t bother showing fields that have no information.

Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. If you want to keep current the informa-
tion you diligently put in your Contacts, you’ll have to do some updating now 
and then.
To update a contact, follow these steps:
 
 
1. On the BlackBerry Storm Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Scroll to and highlight a contact name and press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Edit.
 
 The Edit Contact screen appears.
 
 In any BlackBerry Storm application, including Contacts, you can display 
a menu by pressing the menu key. You see the Edit option in the menu 
right below View.
 
4. Edit the contact information as you see fit.
 
 Hold the device sideways to get the full QWERTY keyboard.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Save.
 
 The edit you made for this contact is saved.
 
When you’re editing information and want to totally replace the entry, clear 
the contents. When you’re in an editable field (as opposed to a selectable 
field), just press the menu key and touch-press Clear Field. This feature is 
always available to an editable field.

46
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
Deleting a contact
It’s time to get rid of somebody’s contact information in your Contacts. 
Maybe it’s a case of duplication or a bit of bad blood. Either way, BlackBerry 
Storm makes it easy to delete a contact.
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Scroll to and highlight a contact name you want to delete.
 
3. Touch-press the Delete (x) icon at the bottom of the screen.
 
 A confirmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
4. Touch-press Delete.
 
 The contact disappears from your contact list.
 
Figure 4-7: 
The con-
firmation 
screen 
when you’re 
about to 
delete a 
contact.
 
 
Dealing with the confirmation screen can be a pain if you want to delete sev-
eral contacts in a row. If you’re 100-percent sure you want to ditch a number of 
contacts, you can suspend the Confirmation feature by setting the Confirm 
Delete option to No in the Contacts Options screen. Check the “Setting prefer-
ences” section later in this chapter for more on Contacts options.
Copying Contacts from 
Desktop Applications
Most people use desktop applications to maintain their contacts — you 
know, Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, or Novell GroupWise. A word 
to the wise: You don’t want to maintain two address books. That’s a recipe 
for disaster. Luckily for you, RIM makes it easy to get your various address 
books — BlackBerry, desktop, laptop, whatever — in sync.

47
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), a col-
lection of programs, one of which is Synchronize. Synchronize allows you to 
synchronize the data between your device and the PC software. It also allows 
you to set up and configure the behavior of the program, including how the 
fields in the desktop version of Address Book map to Contacts fields in your 
BlackBerry.
Check out Chapter 14, which details using the Synchronize feature of 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager device.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through typing and shuttling data between devices — 
you’ve created a nice long list of contacts in your Contacts. Nice enough, we 
suppose — but useless unless you can find the phone number of Rufus T. 
Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing you see in 
Contacts when you open it is the Find screen, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Your search 
starts here.
 
You can conveniently search through your contacts by following these steps:
 
1. In the Find field, enter the letters that start the name you’re 
searching for.
 
 Your search criterion is the person’s name. You can enter the last name, 
first name, or both. The list is usually sorted by first name, last name. 
As you type the letters, the list shrinks based on matches. Figure 4-9 
illustrates how this works.
 
2. Scroll and highlight the name from the list of matches.
 
 If you have multiple matches, slide the screen to scroll through the list 
to find the person’s name.

48
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
 
Figure 4-9: 
Enter more 
letters to

search.
 
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears. 
 
4. Touch-press one of the possible actions shown in Figure 4-10:
 
• Activity Log: Opens a screen listing e-mails, calls, and SMS 
messages you’ve made to the contact.
 
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 7 for more 
information.
 
• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a messaging feature 
unique to BlackBerry. With it, you can send a quick message to 
someone who has a BlackBerry. See Chapter 8 for more details 
about PIN-to-PIN messaging.
 
• Call: Uses Phone to dial the number.
 
• SMS: Starts a new Short Messaging Service (SMS) message, which is 
used in cellphones. See Chapter 8 for more details about SMS.
 
• Send as Attachment: Starts a new e-mail message attaching the con-
tacts. See Chapter 7 for more information.
If you have a finger-fumble and press a key in error, press the escape key 
once to return to the original list (the one showing all your contacts), or 
press the menu key and touch-press View All.
 
Figure 4-10: 
You get

options for 
the selected 
contact.
 

49
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
You’re not hallucinating: Sometimes Email <contact name> or Call <contact 
name> appears on the menu, and sometimes it doesn’t. Contacts knows when 
to show those menu options. If a contact has a phone number, Call <contact 
name> and SMS <contact name> show up, and the same is true for e-mail and 
the personal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list of actions is a conve-
nient way to find out whether you have particular information — a phone 
number or an e-mail address — for a particular contact.
 
In a corporate environment, your BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrator 
might disable PIN-to-PIN messaging because it doesn’t go to the corporate 
e-mail servers and, therefore, can’t be monitored. If this is the case, the menu 
option PIN<contact name> won’t appear even though you entered PIN 
information for your contacts. Note that you can still receive a PIN-to-PIN mes-
sage, but you can’t send one.
Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been diligent by adding your contacts to your Contacts, and your list 
has been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all the contact information 
for your business colleagues, clients, and (of course) family and friends. In 
fact, your Contacts has grown so much that it holds hundreds of contacts, 
and it’s taking more time to find somebody.
Imagine that you’ve just seen an old acquaintance and you want to greet the 
person by name. You know that if you see the name you’d recognize it. The 
trouble is that your list has 300-plus names, which would take so long to 
scroll through — so long, in fact, that this acquaintance would surely come 
up to you in the meantime, forcing you to hide the fact that you can’t 
remember his name. (How embarrassing.) In this scenario, the tried-and-true 
Find feature wouldn’t be much help. What you need is a smaller pool of 
names to search through.
 
This isn’t rocket science. You’ll want to do one of the following:
 
✓ Organize your contacts into groups: Using groups (as every kindergarten 
teacher could tell you) is a way to arrange something (in your case, 
contacts) to make them more manageable. How you arrange your 
groups is up to you. You should base the principle on whatever makes 
sense to you and fits the group you set up. For example, you can place 
all your customer contacts within a Clients group and family members in 
a Family group.
 
✓ Set up your contacts so you can filter them: Use the Filter feature in 
combination with BlackBerry’s Categories. (Categories is labeling your 
contacts to make it easy to filter them.) The Filter feature narrows the 
Contacts list to such an extent that you have to only scroll down and 
find your contact — no need to type search keywords, in other words.

50
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
Whether you use the Group or Filter feature is up to you. You find out how to 
use both methods in the next sections of this chapter.
Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Contacts — as opposed to any other kind of group you 
can imagine — is just a simple category. In other words, a group arranges 
your contacts into subsets without affecting the contact entries themselves. 
In Contacts itself, a group shows up in the contact list just like any other 
contact. The only wrinkle here is that when you select the group, the contacts 
associated with that group — and only the contacts associated with that 
group — appear onscreen.
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a group, fol-
lowing these steps:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press New Group.
 
 A screen similar to that in Figure 4-11 appears. The top portion of the 
screen is where you type the group name, and the bottom portion is 
where you add members.
 
Figure 4-11: 
An empty 
screen 
ready for 
creating a 
group.
 
 
4. Type the name of the group in the New Group field.
 
 You can name it anything.
 
5. Press the menu key. 
 
6. Touch-press Add Member.
 
 The main Contacts list shows up in all its glory, ready to be pilfered.

51
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
7. Touch-press the contact you want to add to your new Group list.
 
 You can’t add a contact to a group if that contact doesn’t have at least 
an e-mail address or a phone number. (It’s very strict on this point.) 
Skirt this roadblock by editing that contact’s information and putting 
in a fake (and clearly inactive) e-mail address, such as notareal@
emailaddress.no.
 
8. Press the menu key.
 
9. Touch-press Continue.
 
 The name you just entered appears in your group list, as shown in 
Figure 4-12.
 
Figure 4-12: 
Your new 
group has 
one mem-
ber.
 
 
10. Repeat Steps 5–7 to add more friends to your list.
 
11. Press the menu key.
 
12. Touch-press Save Group.
 
 Your group is duly saved, and you can now see it listed on your main 
Contacts list.
 
Groups is a valuable tool to create an e-mail distribution list. Just make sure 
that you selected an e-mail address field on your members. Use a naming 
convention to easily distinguish it. Appending a -DL or -Distribution List on the 
name can quickly indicate it is a distribution list.
Using the Filter feature on your contacts
Are you a left brainer or a right brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox fan? Innie or 
Outie? Dividing the world into categories is something everybody does (no 
divisions there), so it should come as no surprise that BlackBerry divides 
your contacts into distinct categories as well.
By default, two categories are set for you on the BlackBerry:

52
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
 
✓ Business
 
✓ Personal
Why stop at two? BlackBerry makes it easy to create more categories. In this 
section, you first find out how to categorize a contact, and then you see how 
to filter your Contacts list. Finally, you find out how to create categories.
Categorizing your contacts
Whether you’re creating one or editing one, you can categorize a particular 
contact as long as you’re in Edit mode.
If the trick is getting into Edit mode, it’s a pretty simple trick. Here’s how 
that’s done:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Highlight the contact.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
4. Touch-press Edit.
 
 Contacts is in Edit mode for this particular contact, which is exactly 
where you want to be.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Categories.
 
 A Categories list appears, as shown in Figure 4-13. By default, the list 
contains only the Business and the Personal categories.
 
Figure 4-13: 
Default 
categories.
 
 
7. Touch-press the Personal check box.
 
8. Press the menu key.

53
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
9. Touch-press Save.
 
 You’re back at the Edit screen for this particular contact.
 
10. Press the menu key.
 
11. Touch-press Save.
You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its category, 
which means you can filter your Contacts list by using a category. Here’s how:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Filter.
 
 Your Categories list appears. If you haven’t added any categories in the 
meantime, you see only the default Business and Personal categories.
 
4. Touch-press the Personal check box.
 
 A mark appears in the check box, and your Contacts list shrinks to the 
contacts in the Personal category, as shown in Figure 4-14.
 
Figure 4-14: 
The 
Contacts 
list after 
you apply a 
filter.
 
 
As you add contacts to a category, you can use Find. Enter the first few letters 
of the name to further narrow the contact search. If you need a refresher on 
how Find works, see the “Looking for Someone?” section earlier in this chapter.
Adding a category
Whoever thought the default categories — Business and Personal — were 
enough for the complexities of the real world probably didn’t know many 
people. BlackBerry makes it easy to add categories, so you can divide your 
world as much as you like:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
 
 
2. Press the menu key.

54
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
 
3. Touch-press Filter.
 
 You get a view of the default categories. Refer to Figure 4-13.
 
4. Press the menu key.
 
5. Touch-press New.
 
 A pop-up screen asks you to name the category.
 
6. Type a name for your category in the Name field.
 
7. Touch-press Enter.
 
 The category is automatically saved. The Filter screen lists all the cat-
egories, including the one you just created. Just press the escape key to 
get back to the Contacts main screen.
Setting preferences
Vanilla, anyone? Some days you’ll wish that your Contacts list was sorted 
differently. For example, there’s the day when you need to find the guy who 
works for ABC Company but has a foreign name that you can hardly pro-
nounce, let alone spell. What’s a body to do?
You’re in luck. Contacts Options navigates some out-of-the-ordinary situa-
tions. Figure 4-15 shows the Contacts Options screen. Despite its simplicity, it 
provides you with three important options that change Contacts behavior:
 
✓ Sort By: Changes the way the list is sorted. You can use First Name, Last 
Name, or Company. Touch-press the field to view and select from the 
possible choices. Remember that guy from ABC Company? You can use 
the Sort By option to sort by Company. By doing that, all contacts from 
ABC Company are listed next to each other and with any luck the guy’s 
name will jump out at you.
 
✓ Separators: Allows you to change the dividers on the Contacts list. It’s 
purely aesthetics but check it out, you might like the stripes.
 
✓ Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on, you can 
have multiple people who happen to share the same name in your 
Contacts. If you disable this option, you get a warning when you try to 
add a name that matches one already on your list. Maybe you’re just tired 
and mistakenly try to add the same person twice to your list? Then again, 
sometimes people just have the same name. We recommend keeping the 
default value of Yes, allowing you to have contacts with the same names.
 
✓ Confirm Delete: Displays a confirmation screen for all contact deletions.
 
 Always keep this feature turned on for normal usage. Because there are 
many ways you could delete somebody from your Contacts, this feature 
is a good way of minimizing accidents.

55
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
How do you change any of these options? The fields behave like any other on 
a BlackBerry application. Simply touch-press the field, and a menu allows you 
to select the possible option values. For example, Figure 4-16 shows the possi-
ble Sort By fields.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
Sharing a Contact
Suppose you want to share your contact information with a friend who also 
has a BlackBerry. A vCard — virtual (business) card — is your answer and 
can make your life a lot easier. In BlackBerry Land, a vCard is a contact in 
your Contacts that you send to someone as an attachment to an e-mail.
At the receiving end, the BlackBerry (being the smart device that it is) rec-
ognizes the attachment and informs the BlackBerry owner that she has the 
option of saving it, making it available for her viewing pleasure in Contacts.
Sending a vCard
Because a vCard is nothing more than a Contacts contact attached to an 
e-mail, sending a vCard is a piece of cake. (Of course, you do need to make 
sure that your recipient has a BlackBerry device to receive the information.)
Here’s how you go about sending a vCard:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Messages icon.
 
 
 Messages opens.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Compose Email.
 
 The new message screen appears, allowing you to compose a new e-mail.
 
4. In the To field, start typing the name of the person you want to 
receive this vCard.
 
5. When you see the name in the drop-down list, touch-press it.
 
 You see an e-mail screen with the name you just selected as the To 
recipient.
 
6. Type the subject and message.
 
7. Press the menu key.
 
8. Touch-press Attach Contact.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
9. Touch-press the name of the person whose contact information you 
want attached.
 
 The e-mail composition screen reappears, and an icon that looks like a 
book indicates that the e-mail now contains your attachment. Now all 
you have to do is send your e-mail.
 
10. Press the menu key.

57
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 
 
11. Touch-press Send.
 
 You just shared the specified contact information. (Don’t you feel right 
neighborly now?)
Receiving a vCard
If you get an e-mail that has a contact attachment, here’s how to save it to 
your Contacts:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Messages icon.
 
 
2. Touch-press the e-mail that contains the vCard.
 
 The e-mail with the vCard attachment opens.
 
3. Touch-press the attachment.
 
4. Press the menu key.
 
5. Touch-press View Attachment.
 
 The vCard appears. 
 
6. Press the menu key.
 
7. Touch-press Add to Contacts.
 
 The vCard is saved and is available in your BlackBerry Storm Contacts.
Searching for Somebody Outside 
Your Contacts
Does your employer provide your BlackBerry Storm? Do you use Outlook or 
Lotus Notes on your desktop machine at work? If you answer yes to both of 
these questions, this section is for you.
BlackBerry Contacts allows you to search for people in your organization, 
basically through this software:
 
✓ Microsoft Exchange (for Outlook)
 
✓ IBM Domino (for Notes)
 
✓ Novell GroupWise
Exchange, Domino, and GroupWise serve the same purposes: namely, to 
facilitate e-mail delivery in a corporate environment and to enable access to a 
database of names.

58
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm  
 
For you techies out there, these databases are called Global Address Lists 
(GAL) in Exchange; Notes Address Books in Domino; and GroupWise Address 
Books in GroupWise.
If you want to search for somebody in your organization through a database 
of names, simply follow these steps:
 
 
1. On the Home screen, touch-press the Contacts icon.
 
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Lookup.
 
 Some corporations might not enable the Lookup feature. Please check 
with your IT department for more information.
 
4. Type the name you’re searching for.
 
5. Press the enter key.
 
 You could enter the beginning characters of either a person’s last or 
first name. You aren’t searching your Contacts but your company’s data-
base, so this step might take some time.
 
 For big organizations, we recommend being more precise when search-
ing. For example, searching for Dan yields more hits than searching for 
Daniel. The more precise your search criteria, the fewer hits you’ll get 
and the faster the search will be.
 
 While the search is in progress, you see the word Lookup and the cri-
teria you put in. For example, if you enter Daniel, the top row reads 
Lookup: Daniel. After the search is finished, BlackBerry displays the 
number of hits or matches: for example, 20 matches: Daniel.
 
6. Touch-press the matches count.
 
 The matches appear. A header at the top of this screen details the 
matches displayed in the current screen as well as the total hits. For 
example, if the header reads something like Lookup Daniel (20 of 
130 matches), 130 people in your organization have the name Daniel, 
and BlackBerry is displaying the first 20. You have the option of fetching 
more by pressing the menu key and touching Get More Results from the 
menu that appears.
 
 You can add the listed name(s) to your Contacts by using the Add com-
mand (for the currently highlighted name) or the Add All command for 
all the names on the list. (As always, press the menu key.)
 
7. Touch-press the person whose information you want to review.
 
 The person’s contact information is displayed on a read-only screen, 
which means you can read it but not change it. You might see the per-
son’s title, e-mail address, work, mobile, and fax numbers, and the street 
address at work. Any of that information gives you confirmation about 
the person you’re looking for. Of course, what shows up depends on the 
availability of this information in your company’s database.

Keeping Your Appointments

▶ Making your Calendar your own
▶ Scheduling a meeting
▶ Making and breaking appointments
T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mastering 
time management (and we’re not just talking about reading this book 
while you’re commuting to work). Many know that the best way to organize 
their time is to use a calendar — a daily planner tool. Those who prefer digi-
tal to paper use a planner program on their PC — either installed on their 
hard drive or accessed through an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The 
smartest of the bunch, of course, use their BlackBerry Storm because it has 
the whole planner thing covered with its Calendar.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (both personal and work) 
in order by managing your appointments with your BlackBerry Calendar. 
What’s great about managing your time on a BlackBerry Storm? Your Storm 
is always with you. 
Just remember that you won’t have excuses anymore for forgetting that 
important quarterly meeting or Bertha’s birthday bash.
Accessing BlackBerry Calendar
 
 BlackBerry Calendar is one of the BlackBerry Storm’s core applications, like 
Contacts or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter 1), so it’s easy to 
get to. From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press the 
Calendar icon on screen. Voilà! You have Calendar.

✓ Day: A summary of your appointments for the day. By default, it lists all 
your appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 
✓ Week: This view shows you a seven-day summary view of your 
appointments. By using this view, you can see how busy you are in a 
particular week.
 
✓ Month: The Month view shows you every day of the month. You can’t 
tell how many appointments are in a day, but you can see on which days 
you have appointments.

61
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
 
✓ Agenda: The Agenda view is a bit different from the other views. It 
isn’t a time-based view like the others; it basically lists your upcoming 
appointments. And in the list, you can see details of the appointments, 
such as where and when.
Different views (like the ones shown in Figure 5-2) offer a different focus on 
your schedule. Select the view you want based on your scheduling needs and 
preferences. If your life is a little more complicated, you can even use a com-
bination of views for a full grasp of your schedule.
 
Figure 5-2:

To switch between different Calendar views, simply follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press the Calendar icon.
 
 
 The Calendar application is called up in its default view — Day view 
(more than likely).
 
2. Press the menu key and then touch-press on the view of your choice 
from the menu that appears.
 
 If you start from Month view, your choices are View Day, View Week, 
and View Agenda (see Figure 5-3).

Moving between time frames
Depending on what Calendar view you’re in, you can easily move to the previous 
or next day, week, month, or year. For example, if you’re looking at June in the 
Month view, you can move to May or July. In fact, if you like to look at things long 
term, you can jump ahead (or back) a year at a time. See Figure 5-4.

Without using the menu, you can quickly move to the next “page.” The 
bottom-right hand corner of the screen has back and forward arrows; try 
them in each time frame view (Day view, Week view, Month view).
You have similar flexibility when it comes to the other Calendar views. See

Show Alarms
You can see alarms in your Calendar if you set this

Managing multiple Calendars
Like your e-mail accounts, you might have multiple Calendars. For example, 
you might have a Calendar from your day job and you might have a Calendar 
from your personal life or softball club that you belong to. Whatever the 
reason, your BlackBerry Storm has a great way for you to manage this.
You can assign different color squares to represent different Calendars; 
this gives you a better view of which event belongs to which Calendar. For 
example, you can have your day job Calendar as red and your softball club 
Calendar as green. When you have two events conflict at the same time slot, 
you can better prioritize with the color. See Figure 5-6.
Follow these steps to change the color of each Calendar:
 
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
3. Touch-press a Calendar of your choice.
 
 The Calendar Properties screen opens.
 
4. Touch-press the colored square and then touch-press the desired

All Things Appointment: Adding, 
Opening, and Deleting
After you master the different Calendar views (and that should take you all 
of about two minutes), and you have Calendar customized to your heart’s 
content (another three minutes, tops), it’s time (pun intended) to set up, 
review, and delete appointments. We also show you how to set up a meeting 
with clients or colleagues.
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is easy. You need only one piece of information: 
when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can easily add related 
information about the appointment:
 
✓ Meeting’s purpose
 
✓ Location
 
✓ Additional notes
 
In addition to your standard, one-time, limited-duration meeting, you can 
set all-day appointments. The BlackBerry can assist you in setting recurring 
(repeating) meetings as well as reminders. Sweet!

67
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new one-time appointment, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press New.
 
 The New Appointment screen appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
 
 You can also touch-press the bottom left icon with a plus sign to open 
the New Appointment screen.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Set an 
appointment 
here.
 
 
3. Fill in the appointment information.
 
 Type the information regarding your appointment in the appropriate 
spaces. You should at least enter the time and the subject of your 
appointment.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
 Your appointment is now available from any Calendar view. 
 
You can have more than one appointment in the same time slot. BlackBerry 
lets you decide which appointment you should go for and which one you 
conveniently forget.
Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — you’re in corporate training or have 
an all-day doctor’s appointment — mark the All Day Event check box in the 
New Appointment screen.
Setting your appointment reminder time
You can associate any Calendar appointment with a reminder alert — either 
a vibration or a beep, depending on how you set things up in your profile. 
(For more on profiles, see Chapter 3.) You can have no reminder for an 
appointment. 

68
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
Create a reminder this way: From the New Appointment screen, simply scroll 
to the Reminder field and select a reminder time anywhere from none to 1 
week before your appointment time.
 
Profile is simply another useful feature that allows you to customize how your 
BlackBerry alerts you when an event occurs. Examples of events are an e-mail, 
a phone call, or an appointment reminder.
By default, whatever reminder alert you set goes off 15 minutes before the 
event. But you don’t have to stick with the default. You can choose your own 
default reminder time:
 
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
 The Calendar Options screen comes up.
 
3. Touch-press Default Reminder.
 
4. Touch-press a default reminder time anywhere from none to 1 week 
before your appointment.
 
 From now on, any new appointment has the reminder you set up. 
Assuming a reminder time other than none (you’re on your own, then!), 
a dialog box like the one in Figure 5-8 appears, letting you know an 
appointment is coming up.
 
Figure 5-8: 
You get a 
reminder 
dialog box if 
you want.
 
Creating a recurring appointment
Everyone has some repeating appointments: birthdays, anniversaries, 
taking out the trash every Thursday at 7:30 a.m. You can set up recurring 
appointments based on daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrences.
You can define an Every field for all types; see Figure 5-9. For example, say 
you have an appointment that recurs every nine days:

69
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
Set the Recurrence field to Daily. 
Set the Every field to 9.
 
Figure 5-9: 
An 
appointment 
recurring 
every nine 
days.
 
Depending on what you select in the Recurrence field, you have the option to 
fill in other fields:
 
✓ Weekly: You can fill in the Day of the Week field. 
 
✓ Monthly or Yearly: The Relative Date check box is available. With 
this checked, you can ensure that your appointment recurs relative to 
today’s date. For example, if you choose the following, your appoint-
ment occurs every two months on the third Sunday until July 31, 2012:
Start: Sunday, June 17, 2010 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 17, 2010 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2012
On the other hand, if all options in our example remain the same except you 
don’t select Relative Date, your appointment occurs every two months, on 
the 18th of the month, until July 31, 2012.
If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t worry: The majority of your 
appointments won’t be as complicated as this.

70
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
Opening an appointment
After you set an appointment, you can view it in a couple of ways: 
 
✓ Click the Open box in the Reminder dialog box. Refer to Figure 5-8. 
 
✓ From Calendar, touch-press the exact time of your appointment.
 
While looking at an appointment, you can designate a new appointment time 
or a new appointment location and then save.
Deleting an appointment
That meeting you were dreading got cancelled. Whoopee! Deleting an 
appointment is straightforward. When in Day or Week view, simply finger 
scroll to the appointment that you want to delete, press the menu key, and 
touch-press Delete from the menu that appears.
 
Or you can touch-press the appointment to bring it up, and then touch-press 
the bottom-right icon that has a red x to delete the appointment.
If the appointment you’re deleting is recurring, a dialog box asks whether you 
want to delete
 
✓ All occurrences of this appointment
 
✓ Just this particular occurrence, as shown in Figure 5-10

 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Appointments
Appointments versus Meetings
Technically, any event is as an appointment, whether it’s your friend’s birth-
day or a doctor’s appointment. However, when you invite people or are 
invited to a meeting (whether it’s face-to-face or via phone), that appoint-
ment becomes a meeting.
Sending a meeting request
Sending a meeting request to others is similar to creating a Calendar 
appointment:
 
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and then touch-press New.
 
3. Fill in the key appointment information.
 
4. Press the menu key and then touch-press Invite Attendee.
 
 You’re taken to Address Book to select your meeting attendee.
 
5. From Address Book:
 
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Touch-press the contact 
you want to invite.
 
• If you don’t yet have contacts or the one you want isn’t in your 
Address Book: Choose the Use Once option to type the appropriate 
e-mail address to Calendar.
 
 You see the attendees in your Calendar meeting notice.
 
6. Press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
 
 Your meeting attendees receive an e-mail, inviting them to your meeting.
Responding to a meeting request
Whether for work or for a casual event, you’ve likely received a meeting 
request by e-mail. You were probably asked to choose one of three options: 
Accept, Tentative, or Decline. (If it’s from your boss for an all-staff meeting 
and you just can’t afford to decline again because it’s so close to Christmas 
bonus time, that’s an Accept.)

72
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
You can accept any meeting request from your managers or colleagues on 
your BlackBerry just as you would on your desktop PC. Upon reading the 
e-mail on your BlackBerry, choose one of the following in the Messages 
application:
 
✓ Accept
 
✓ Tentative
 
✓ Decline
Your response is sent in an e-mail. We go into more detail about the 
Messages application in Chapter 7.
If you choose Accept or Tentative, the meeting is added to your Calendar 
automatically. If you have a change of heart, you can delete the declined 
event and it disappears from your Calendar. You can do this by going back to 
the Calendar event and touch-press Decline from the menu.
Setting your meeting dial-in number
In this global economy, many of us have colleagues and friends that are 
located in another country or even on another continent. So, when it comes 
to having a meeting, usually it is through a phone conference that involves a 
dial-in number, moderator code (if you are the moderator), and participation 
code.
Your BlackBerry Storm makes storing and displaying these numbers easy 
when you’re creating a new appointment in the BlackBerry Calendar.
To set your phone conference dial-in details, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
3. Touch-press Conference Call Options.
 
 A screen similar to Figure 5-11 appears.
 
4. Enter the appropriate numbers.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.

Making Notes and Calculations
In This Chapter
▶ Using MemoPad
▶ Managing your notes
▶ Printing your notes
▶ Using Calculator and its shortcuts
▶ Converting from metric to English measurement systems
You know what a memo pad is. Most people take them to meetings. Yes, 
you take them to those looong meetings. Bored and need to stay awake? 
Your memo pad is the answer. You can draw faces, doodle fanciful designs, 
or even write a poem, all the while pretending to listen to your colleagues. 
Why do people like to call for meetings? Let’s get everybody in a room and 
talk about something that doesn’t concern them. Just lovely, isn’t it?
What we describe in this chapter is your e-memo pad for taking notes — the 
aptly named MemoPad — on your BlackBerry Storm.
Your BlackBerry Storm has another handy application that saves you from 
having to stuff yet another gizmo in your bag: its built-in Calculator, which we 
talk about in this chapter as well.
Taking a MemoPad
MemoPad on your BlackBerry Storm can prove handy, indeed. If nothing 
else, use it to jot down important notes and ideas you might forget. How 
much frustration must you endure for not remembering a fleeting thought? 
Like when you forget why you actually called somebody. Writing down your 
thoughts is the best way to remember. Use your handy-dandy BlackBerry 
Storm to record them.
In upcoming sections, we explore how to jot down notes by using MemoPad 
as well as how to effectively organize your notes and come back to them 
quickly by using filters. We also throw in tips on how to print your notes.

76
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
Accessing MemoPad
Accessing MemoPad is a snap. Depending on the theme you’re using, you can 
get to it right from the Home screen or through the Applications folder. With 
the Verizon theme, you access MemoPad through the Applications icon as 
shown on the left in Figure 6-1. The MemoPad screen appears, as shown on 
the right in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Open 
MemoPad 
here.
 
Jotting down notes
Recording notes is a breeze.
 
1. Touch-press Add Memo located on the top of the screen, below Find.
 
 An empty memo screen comes up, as shown in Figure 6-2. A line divides 
the screen.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Start a new 
note here.
 

77
 Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations
 
 When entering notes, always hold your BlackBerry Storm lengthwise 
(landscape) to use the QWERTY virtual keypad, which is easier and 
quicker for typing.
 
2. Enter the title in the top field.
 
 Your MemoPad list is sorted alphabetically, so choose a helpful first 
word when entering the title. Stay away from starting with A, An, The, 
This, and similar words. Briefly describe the subject. If you use long 
words, five words are ideal; otherwise, six words can fit.
 
 Of course, you can enter more than six words — or as many as you 
want — but remember that the BlackBerry screen isn’t wide. MemoPad 
displays the title as one line in the main MemoPad screen, which is the 
Find list. If your note title is longer than the width of the screen, the title 
is truncated with an ellipsis (. . .) at its end.
 
3. Type your memo in the bottom part.
 
 Your memo can be another War and Peace as long as your BlackBerry 
can store it.
Just like jotting down new memos, you can access all your memos easily in the 
MemoPad list and act on them by using the options accessible in the bottom of 
the screen, as shown on the left of Figure 6-3, or through the menu, as shown in 
the right of Figure 6-3. You can edit the memo by touch-pressing A|cd, forward 
it by touch-pressing the memo icon with the right arrow, or delete the memo 
by touch-pressing the Delete (X) icon. Remember that just like in other 
applications, the menu is always available by pressing the menu key. The menu 
that appears is in context with the currently selected memo, which allows you 
to Forward As, Edit, and Delete (see the right side of Figure 6-3).
 
Just like in Contacts and Messages, the menu is always available by pressing 
the menu key.

A contextual 
action can

using the 
bottom 
options

78
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
Viewing and editing your notes
Obviously, you jot a memo for future reference. Viewing or editing the memo 
is the next logical step. After MemoPad is open, touch-press the memo you 
want, and a screen displaying your memo shows up. You can edit your memo 
right on this screen.
If you’re not happy with the font size, whether it’s too small or too big, see 
Chapter 3 for details on how to customize display fonts. MemoPad is using the 
global preferences defined in Options under the Screen/Keyboard section.
Deleting your notes
Face it, half the sticky notes you leave on your desk are no longer relevant. 
Your MemoPad is no different. Delete what you don’t need. Touch-press the 
scroll arrow keys at the bottom of the screen to highlight the memo you want 
to delete from your MemoPad list, and touch-press the Delete (X) icon in the 
bottom of the screen. Ready to say goodbye? Touch-press Delete from the 
confirmation screen. Your memo is gone.
The confirmation screen is a feature common to all out-of-the-box BlackBerry 
Storm applications such as Contacts, Tasks, and Calendar. It diminishes the 
accidental deletion of records. You can enable or disable this feature.
Disabling the confirmation screen is useful when you’re getting rid of lots of 
memos and don’t want to be bothered by it. (Be sure to turn the feature back 
on when you’re finished deleting.)
To turn off this feature, just do the following:
 
1. Go to the MemoPad Options screen, and touch-press the Confirm 
Delete field.
 
 The screen shows your two choices: Yes and No. No means you want to 
toggle off the Confirmation screen.
 
2. Touch-press No.
 
 The MemoPad Options screen updates to show No in the Confirm Delete 
field.
 
3. Press the menu key and then touch-press Save.
 
 The MemoPad application applies the changes you made.
 
Another field you can see from the MemoPad Options screen is Number of 
Entries. This field is just informational, showing you how many memos you 
have in your MemoPad application.

79
 Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations
Finding a note — quickly
The Find field is always on the main MemoPad screen. Just like Contacts (see 
Chapter 4), you can use this feature to find a note by typing in the field next 
to Find. (Ah, the importance of good note-naming becomes clearer all the 
time.)
In the Find field, start typing what you think your note is titled. The list below 
shrinks, based on matches. A match is based on the starting letters of the 
subjects. As you type more letters in the Find field, your MemoPad note list 
is filtered more. For example, if you type bi, you see notes with titles like bid 
night and birthday, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Search 
notes here.
 
Organizing your notes
MemoPad is easy and helpful; you can make it more effective by organizing 
your notes list. Like in Contacts and Tasks, you can group your notes and 
then show a list of contacts based on a grouping. Simply define a group — a 
category — and then assign that category to a note.
Creating a category
Categories are common to most BlackBerry Storm applications and catego-
ries go across applications. For example, a category you see in MemoPad is 
the same category you see in Tasks or Contacts. You can access a category 
from the menu of any of these BlackBerry applications. To create a category 
from MemoPad, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Applications folder screen, touch-press MemoPad.
 
 
 MemoPad opens and you see the list of your notes.
 
 You can find the Applications folder from the Home screen by pressing 
the menu key.

80
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
 
2. Press the menu key and then touch-press Filter.
 
 A screen lists all the available categories. By default, BlackBerry Storm 
gives you Personal and Business categories as shown in Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Touch-press 
a category 
here.
 
 
3. Press the menu key and then touch-press New.
 
 A New Category screen appears.
 
4. Enter the category name in the text field.
 
5. Touch-press the enter key.
 
 The new category name appears in the list of category names.
 
6. Press the menu key and touch-press Close.
Assigning a category
You can assign categories to your notes when you create or edit a memo. 
Either way, the steps are the same.
Follow these steps to edit a memo and assign a category:
 
1. In MemoPad, touch-press the memo you want to edit.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Categories.
 
 A list of categories appears.
 
4. Touch-press the category you want.
 
 The highlighted category is selected, which means your memo will be 
associated to this category. You can select as many categories as you 
want.

81
 Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Save.
 
 The Note screen returns. Although the assignment is now in your memo, 
it doesn’t stay until you save the note itself.
 
7. Press the menu key.
 
8. Touch-press Save.
 
 Your note is saved and attached to the category you chose.
 
If you’re working in MemoPad and decide to delete a category, you lose that 
category and all its assignments in the other applications, such as Contacts. 
(The Contacts contact is still intact, but without the category assignment.)
Filtering the list
Time to see just how easy MemoPad can make your life. Finding a note that 
belongs to a category (see the preceding section on assigning a note cat-
egory) is just a touch-press away. To filter your notes list for a certain cat-
egory, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Applications folder, touch-press MemoPad.
 
 
 MemoPad opens.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Filter.
 
 A screen appears with the available categories.
 
4. Touch-press the category you want.
 
 Your filtered list appears. Note that the list now has the category name 
as the heading, as shown in Figure 6-6.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your Storm 
Printing notes
Okay, you got us. Out of the box, you can’t exactly print notes directly from 
BlackBerry Storm. However, if you search for a BlackBerry printer online, you 
see lots of options.
Following are some solutions:
 
✓ Third-party applications (Bluetooth): You install a commercial 
application, such as Content Beamer from www.thinprint.com, to 
your BlackBerry Storm. Such applications use a Bluetooth connection to 
a printer that also works with Bluetooth.
 
✓ Third-party applications (Internet/e-mail based): A server-based 
application that connects to your e-mail server prints any e-mail 
attachment. In your BlackBerry, you have to install an application 
allowing you to send the command to print. A sample of such an 
application is MasterDoc for BlackBerry at www.dynoplex.com/
printing_master.shtml.
 
✓ Through your desktop PIM software: Even if you buy an application 
that allows you to print from your BlackBerry, you still need a computer 
to process that command. Having the Bluetooth option for printing is 
convenient. If you’re cost conscious, however, the best way is to sync 
your device with an application, such as Outlook or Outlook Express, 
which features an equivalent MemoPad-type application that you 
can sync with BlackBerry MemoPad. From there, you can then print 
your notes. In Chapter 14, we describe in detail how to connect your 
BlackBerry to a desktop computer and sync information between 
your BlackBerry and your desktop application.
Calculating
Sure, calculators are everywhere and readily accessible. But using the 
BlackBerry Storm Calculator is so easy!
Of course, Calculator performs just like you expect it to, but stick with us to 
see how easily you can use it to convert between metric and English mea-
surement systems.
Accessing Calculator
Calculator is filed in the Applications folder (see Figure 6-7). You can easily 
pick it out because it looks like an old-fashioned calculator.

83
 Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations
Just like other BlackBerry Storm applications, opening Calculator is a simple 
matter of touch-pressing its icon.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Access 
Calculator 
here.
 
Using Calculator
Calculator has the standard number pad look that you’re used to, as shown 
in Figure 6-8. Of course, you can do basic math. With the ability to touch-
press the virtual keys, it should be as easy as using the traditional calcula-
tor. We recommend you hold the BlackBerry Storm lengthwise (landscape)

some keys have two functions. The upper portion is active by pressing Shift 
key and can be found on the bottom-left corner of the screen.

Converting between English 
and metric systems
When you’re faced with an unfamiliar measurement system — say, liters 
versus gallons or miles versus kilometers — you’ll probably need help con-
verting. Conveniently enough, your BlackBerry Calculator can help you. From 
its menu, you can quickly convert measurements from English to metric or 
vice versa.
Display the conversion menu (shown in Figure 6-9) by pressing the menu key.
As an example, to convert 20 kilometers to miles, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Applications folder, touch-press Calculator.
 
 Calculator opens.
 
2. Touch-press the digits of the numeral you want to convert.
 
 Your first numeral (20 in this example) appears in the numeral field of 
the Calculator screen.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
4. Touch-press the From Metric menu item (see Figure 6-9).
 
 The menu screen with the conversion choices appears, as shown in 
Figure 6-10. Table 6-1 displays these conversion units.
 
 The arrow directions tell you the direction of the conversion. If you 
touch-press To Metric compared with From Metric (as in this example), 
the arrow direction is reversed.
 
5. Touch-press km → mi from the menu.
 
 The screen displays the results of the conversion — 12.427424, in this 
case.

Chapter 7
You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
In This Chapter
▶ Linking your e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry
▶ Mastering e-mail basics
▶ Spell checking your messages
▶ Searching your e-mail
▶ Saving messages
Your BlackBerry Storm brings a fresh new face to the convenience and 
ease of use that are associated with e-mail. You can direct mail to your 
BlackBerry from up to ten e-mail accounts, including the likes of Yahoo! and 
AOL. You can set up an e-mail signature, configure e-mail filters, and search 
for e-mail messages.
In this chapter we show you how to use and manage your BlackBerry’s mail 
capabilities to its full potential. From setup to sorts, we have you covered 
here.
Getting Up and Running with E-Mail
Regardless of your network service provider (such as T-Mobile, or Rogers, 
or Vodafone), you can set up your BlackBerry to receive mail from at least 
one of your current e-mail accounts. Thus, with whatever address you use 
to send and receive e-mail from your PC (Yahoo!, Gmail, and so on), you can 
hook up your BlackBerry to use that same e-mail address. Instead of checking 
your Gmail at the Google site, for example, you can get it on your BlackBerry. 
Is your company running a BES and MS Exchange server, but didn’t think to 
give you a company BlackBerry? No worries, you can still get your e-mail via 
the BlackBerry Desktop Redirector. Keep reading.

90
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
Most network service providers allow you to connect up to ten e-mail accounts 
to your BlackBerry. This capability provides you with the convenience of one 
central point from which you get all your e-mail. Such convenience!
Using the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one by using the 
BlackBerry Internet Service client (formerly known as the BlackBerry Web 
client). The BlackBerry Internet Service client allows you to
 
✓ Manage up to ten e-mail accounts: See the next section, “Combining 
your e-mail accounts into one.”
 
✓ Use wireless e-mail reconciliation: No more trying to match your 
BlackBerry e-mail against e-mail in your combined account(s). Just turn 
on wireless e-mail reconciliation and you’re good to go. For more on 
this, see the upcoming section, “Enabling wireless reconciliation.”
 
✓ Create e-mail filters: You can filter e-mails to get only those messages 
that you truly care about on your BlackBerry. See the “Filtering your 
e-mail” section, near the end of this chapter.
Think of the BlackBerry Internet Service client (also known simply as Service 
client) as an online e-mail account manager that doesn’t keep your messages. 
Instead, it routes the e-mails from your other accounts to your BlackBerry 
(because it’s directly connected to your BlackBerry).
Combining your e-mail accounts into one
To start herding e-mail accounts onto your BlackBerry, you must first run a 
setup program from the BlackBerry Internet Service client. 
 
You can access the Service client from your BlackBerry or from your desktop 
computer. To do so, you need the URL that is specific to your network service. 
Contact your network service provider (T-Mobile, Verizon, and so on) directly 
to get that information.
After you’ve logged into the Service client, you should see a screen similar 
to Figure 7-1. If your network provider has activated your BlackBerry, you 
should see one e-mail address: your BlackBerry’s default address.

91
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
The Service client has three options on the left navigation bar:
 
✓ E-mail Accounts: Here you can add, edit, and delete e-mail accounts. In 
addition, you can set up filters and a signature for each address.
 
✓ Change Handheld: This option isn’t used frequently. We don’t cover it 
here.
 
✓ Service Books: This option isn’t used frequently. We don’t cover it here.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Set up 
an e-mail 
account 
here.
 
As mentioned, your BlackBerry already has a default e-mail address with 
which you can receive and send e-mail. If you don’t have any other e-mail 
account that you want to meld into your BlackBerry e-mail account, simply 
skip to the upcoming “Customizing Your E-Mail” section.
Adding an e-mail account
We suggest that you first register and create your account by using your 
PC. Then for subsequent visits to the BlackBerry Internet Service client, you 
can use your BlackBerry. This way, you can minimize any errors or out-of-
network coverage issues while setting up your account.
You can have up to ten e-mail accounts on your BlackBerry. To add an e-mail 
account to your BlackBerry account, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 7-1), click 
Setup Account.
 
 You see the Add E-mail Account screen.
 
2. Enter the address and login credentials for that e-mail address.
 
• The e-mail address is the address from which you want to receive 
e-mail, for example, myid@yahoo.com.

92
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
• The account login is the one you use to log into this particular 
e-mail account.
 
• The password is the one you use with the login.
 
3. Click the Next button.
 
 You’re finished. It’s that easy!
 
You can also manage your accounts from your BlackBerry. From the Home 
screen, press the menu key and select Set Up Internet E-mail. The rest is pretty 
much the same on the BlackBerry as it is on a PC.
Using Desktop Redirector: 
How enterprising!
If you’re a sole proprietor or consultant who works in a corporation that runs 
Exchange or Lotus and want to get enterprise (corporate) e-mails on your 
own BlackBerry, this section is for you. 
Normally, to get enterprise e-mail your BlackBerry has to be configured with 
the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). This is typical if your employer hands 
you a BlackBerry. However, if you work for a large company as a contractor, 
you probably won’t get a BlackBerry from the company you work for. 
 
When you want to get enterprise e-mail to avoid falling behind (especially if 
you don’t work five days a week), you need Desktop Redirector. In order 
for you to do this, you first need to install BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which 
you can find out how to do in Chapter 14. 
After you’ve installed Desktop Manager with Redirector, make sure that 
Redirector starts every time you boot up your PC. 
 
Some corporations allow Desktop Redirector but some don’t. Contact your IT 
department for proper setup.
 
Just a few caveats when using the Desktop Redirector:
 
✓ You get enterprise e-mail as long as your PC is turned on and have a 
connection to the Internet.
 
✓ When someone sends you an attachment, you can’t retrieve it from your 
BlackBerry.
 
✓ When someone sends you a meeting notice, you can’t accept or reject 
the invitation. 

93
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Customizing Your E-Mail
In this section we go over the details of the following e-mail configurations:
 
✓ Create an e-mail signature if you’re tired of writing Regards, John Smith 
over and over to close an e-mail.
 
✓ After enabling e-mail reconciliation, whatever you see on your 
BlackBerry is what you get in your e-mail account(s). You no longer 
have to double-delete a message in both your BlackBerry and your 
e-mail account(s).
 
✓ Whether you’re out of the office or want a quick response message sent 
to your senders, auto-replies is where you can specify the message. This 
feature is for enterprise users only.
Configuring your e-mail signature
By default, your e-mail signature is something like “Sent via My BlackBerry,” 
which can be cool in the first week, showing off to people that you’re a la 
mode with your BlackBerry. But sooner or later, you might not want people 
to know that you are out and about while answering e-mail. Or you might 
want something more personal. 
Follow these steps to configure your e-mail signature by using the Service 
client:
 
1. Log into Service client on your PC.
 
 The BlackBerry Internet Service client appears. (Refer to Figure 7-1.) 
 
2. Click the Edit icon for the desired e-mail account.
 
 The edit screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
 
3. In the Signature field, type the text for your e-mail signature.
 
4. Click Save.
 
Because the internet connection might be spotty from your BlackBerry at 
times, we recommend that you first set up your signature on your PC.

94
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
Figure 7-2: 
The e-mail 
account edit 
screen.
 
Enabling wireless reconciliation
With wireless reconciliation, you don’t need to delete the same e-mail in two 
places. The two e-mail inboxes reconcile with each other, hence the term 
wireless reconciliation. Convenient, huh?
Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
You can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your 
BlackBerry:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press Messages.
 
 
 The Messages application opens. You see the message list.
 
2. In the message list, press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
 The Options screen appears with two types: General Options and Email 
Reconciliation.
 
3. Touch-press Email Reconciliation.
 
 The Email Reconciliation screen opens, which has the following options:
 
• Delete On: Configures how BlackBerry handles e-mail deletion.
 
• Wireless Reconciliation: Turns on or off the wireless sync function.
 
• On Conflict: Controls how BlackBerry handles any inconsistencies 
between e-mail on your BlackBerry and the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client.
 
 You can choose who “wins” via the Email Reconciliation option: 
your BlackBerry or the BlackBerry Internet Service client.
 
4. For the Delete On option, touch-press one of the following:
 
• Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on your 
BlackBerry only.

95
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on 
both your BlackBerry and your inbox on the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client.
 
• Prompt: This option makes BlackBerry ask you to confirm at the 
time of deletion.
 
5. For Wireless Reconciliation, touch-press On.
 
 The changes you make on device will match the one on your e-mail 
account.
 
6. For On Conflict, touch-press one of the following from the drop-down 
list.
 
• Handheld Wins: The e-mail messages in your e-mail account will 
match the ones on the handheld.
 
• Mailbox Wins: The e-mail messages on your handheld will match 
the ones on your email account.
 
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work well with the e-mail rec-
onciliation feature of the BlackBerry, so you might have to delete an e-mail 
twice.
Permanently deleting e-mail from your BlackBerry
 
When deleting e-mail on your BlackBerry, the same message in that e-mail 
account is placed in the Deleted folder. You can set up your BlackBerry to per-
manently delete e-mail, but use this option with caution — after that e-mail is 
gone, it’s gone. 
To permanently delete e-mail on your Service client from your BlackBerry, 
follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application. 
 
 
 The message list opens. 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
 The Options screen opens.
 
3. Touch-press E-mail Reconciliation.
 
 The E-mail Reconciliation screen opens. 
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Purge Deleted Items.
 
 You see a listing of all your e-mail accounts.
 
5. Choose the e-mail account from which you want to purge deleted 
items.
 
 A screen warns that you are about to purge deleted e-mails on your 
Service client.

96
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
6. If you’re sure you want to never see these messages again, touch-
press Yes.
 
 Deleted e-mails in the selected e-mail account are purged.
 
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work with the purge deleted 
items feature. 
Automating replies and 
out-of-office messages 
Unfortunately, the BlackBerry Internet Service doesn’t have the “out-of-office” 
message feature, but that doesn’t mean you can’t work around it. 
 
One way to set your out-of-office is by going to your e-mail service account 
(Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, and so on) and set the out-of-office message from 
there. If you have more than one e-mail account routed to your BlackBerry, 
you have to do this for each. Not ideal, but it works.
Accessing Messages
From Messages, you send and receive your e-mails and also configure wire-
less e-mail reconciliation with your e-mail account(s). 
 
 To access Messages, touch-press the Messages icon on the Home screen. 
The message list appears. Your message list can contain e-mail, voice mail 
messages, missed phone call notices, Short Messaging Service (SMS) mes-
sages, and even saved Web pages.
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about data security or delivery speed, with 
BlackBerry’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good hands.
And whether you’ve combined accounts or use the plain-vanilla BlackBerry 
e-mail account, you receive your e-mail the same way. When you get an e-mail 
message, your BlackBerry notifies you by displaying a number next to a mail 
icon (an envelope) at the top of the screen. This number represents how 
many new, unread e-mails you have. The asterisk next to the envelope indi-
cates new mail that you haven’t opened in the Messages application. 

97
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Your BlackBerry can also notify you of new e-mail by vibration, a sound, 
or both. You can customize this from the Profile application as detailed in 
Chapter 3.
Retrieving your e-mail is simple:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press the Messages icon.
 
 
 Doing so allows you to view your message list.
 
2. Touch-press the e-mail message you want to read.
 
 You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small unopened enve-
lope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A read e-mail bears an opened 
envelope icon; a sent e-mail has a check mark as its icon; and a docu-
ment icon represents a draft e-mail.
 
3. After you finish reading the message, press the escape key to return to 
the message list.
Sorting the message list
The BlackBerry lists items by the date and time you got them, but you can 
sort by different criteria. 
On the BlackBerry, you can search your e-mail by the sender’s name or by 
keywords. Or you could run a search as broad as looking through all the 
e-mail that has been sent to you. See the later section, “Searching Messages 
Like a Pro,” for more on searching and sorting. For more predefined hot keys, 
see the upcoming section, “Reusing saved searches.”
Saving a message to the saved folder
 
You can save any important e-mail in a folder so you can find it without sorting 
through tons of e-mail. To do so, touch-press the e-mail you want to save, press 
the menu key, and touch-press Save. A pop-up message confirms that your 
e-mail has been saved. Note: Your saved e-mail still remains in the message list.
To retrieve or view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application. 
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press View Saved Messages.
 
 You see the list of all the messages you saved.
 
3. Touch-press the message you want to view.

98
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Viewing attachments
Your BlackBerry Storm lets you view most e-mail attachments just like you 
can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking sizeable attachments, too, such as 
JPEG photo files, Word docs, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spreadsheets. 
Table 7-1 has a list of supported attachments viewable from your BlackBerry.

To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard paper clip 
icon next to your e-mail in the message list. 
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way. This makes 
retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attachment, follow along:
 
1. With an e-mail open, press the menu key and touch-press Open 
Attachment.
 
 You see a screen containing the name of the file, a Table of Contents 
option, and a Full Contents option. 
 
• For Word documents, you can see different headings in outline form 
in the Table of Contents option. 

99
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
• For picture files, such as a JPEG, you can simply go straight to the 
Full Contents option to see the graphic.
 
• For all supported file types, you see Table of Contents and Full 
Contents as options. Depending on the file type, use your judgment 
on when you should use the Table of Contents option.
 
2. Scroll to Full Contents, press the menu key, and touch-press Retrieve.
 
 Your BlackBerry attempts to contact the BlackBerry Internet Service 
client to retrieve your attachment. This retrieves only part of your attach-
ment. BlackBerry retrieves more as you scroll through the attachment. 
Editing attachments
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with Documents to Go, which means you not 
only can view but also edit Word and PowerPoint documents. You can even 
save the documents to your BlackBerry and later transfer them to your PC.
As an example, we show you how to edit a Word document attached to an 
e-mail:
 
1. Open an e-mail.
 
2. In the message list, open an e-mail with a Word document attached.
 
 The e-mail opens for you to read. Notice the little paper clip, indicating 
that it has an attachment.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press Open Attachment.
 
 You are asked if you want to view the Word document or Edit with 
Documents To Go.
 
4. Touch-press Edit with Documents To Go.
 
 Here you can view your documents. 
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Edit Mode.
 
 With Edit Mode, you can edit your document. When you finish editing, 
you can save the doc on your BlackBerry Storm or e-mail it. For these 
steps, we e-mail it.
 
 If you want to save the attachment on to your BlackBerry, go to the 
folder structure on your BlackBerry. For documents, the default folder 
structure is usually under Document folder.
 
6. Press the menu key and touch-press Send via E-mail.
 
 An e-mail message opens with the Word document attached. Follow the 
steps in the next section to send this e-mail.

100
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your BlackBerry is 
write an e-mail to let your friends know that you’ve just gotten a BlackBerry. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application. 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Compose Email.
 
 You’re prompted with a blank e-mail that you need to fill out as you 
would on your PC.
 
3. In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
 
 As you type, you see a list of contacts from your Contacts matching the 
name or address that you’re typing. You can make a selection from this 
list.
 
4. Type your message subject and body.
 
5. When you’re finished, press the menu key and touch-press Send.
 
 Your message has wings.
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail with a colleague or friend, you 
can forward that e-mail. Simply do the following:
 
1. Open the e-mail.
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Forward.
 
3. Type the recipient’s name or e-mail address in the appropriate space.
 
 When you start typing your recipient’s name, a drop-down list of your 
contacts appears and you can choose from it.
 
4. Type a message if needed.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Send.
 
 Your message is on its way to your recipient.
Sending e-mail to multiple people
When you need to send an e-mail to more than one person, just keep adding 
recipient names as needed. You can also add recipient names to receive a CC 
(carbon copy) or BCC (blind carbon copy). Here’s how:

101
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
1. Open the e-mail.
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Compose Email.
 
3. Specify the To field for the e-mail recipient; then press the enter key.
 
 Another To field is added below the first. The CC field works the same 
way. 
 
4. To add a BCC recipient, press the menu key and touch-press Add BCC.
 
 You see a BCC field. You can specify a blind carbon-copy (BCC) recipi-
ent the same way you do To and CC recipients.
 
Whether you’re writing a new e-mail, replying, or forwarding an e-mail, the 
way you add new CC and BCC fields is the same.
Saving a draft e-mail
 
Sometimes the most skillful wordsmiths find themselves lacking. Don’t fret, 
fellow wordsmith; you can save that e-mail as a draft until your words come to 
you. Just press the menu key and touch-press Save Draft.
Your e-mail is saved as a draft. When you’re ready to send your message, 
choose the draft from the message list. You can tell which messages are 
drafts because they sport a tiny document icon; finished messages have an 
envelope icon.
Attaching any file to your e-mail 
Many people are surprised that you can attach any document on your 
BlackBerry Storm or in the microSD card (in your Storm). When we say any 
file type, we mean Word, Excel, PowerPoint documents, as well as pictures, 
music, videos.
 
 
1. Open the Messages application. 
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Compose.
 
 You’re prompted with a blank e-mail.
 
3. In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
 
 As you type, you see a list of contacts from your Contacts matching the 
name or address that you’re typing. You can make a selection from this 
list.
 
4. Type your message subject and body.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Attach File.

102
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
 You’re prompted with folders. Think of them as the folders on your PC.
 
6. Touch-press the folders until you get to the file you want to send; 
touch-press that file.
 
 You see the file in the e-mail message.
 
7. Press the menu key and touch-press Send.
 
 Your message has wings.
Spell checking your outgoing messages
 
Whether you’re composing an e-mail message or an SMS text message (see 
Chapter 8), you can always check your spelling with the built-in spell checker. 
Simply press the menu key and touch-press Check Spelling. 
When it finds an error, the BlackBerry spell checker makes a suggestion, as 
shown in Figure 7-3. If you want to skip that word and go on to the next, press 
the escape key. If you want to skip spell checking altogether for an e-mail, 
press and hold the escape key.
If you’re used to MS Word dot-underlining a misspelled word, your 
BlackBerry Storm does the same. 
 
Figure 7-3: 
The 
BlackBerry 
spell 
checker is 
in action.
 
By default, the spell checker doesn’t kick in before you send your message, 
but you can change that:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application. 
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
3. Touch-press Spell Check.
 
4. Make sure Spell Check E-mail Before Sending is checked.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.

103
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Adding a sender to your Contacts
You can add a message sender’s contact info to your BlackBerry Contacts 
directly from Messages. You don’t even have to copy or write down the per-
son’s name and e-mail address on paper.
To add a sender to your Contacts, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and touch-press Messages.
 
2. Touch-press the e-mail whose sender you want added to your 
Contacts.
 
3. From the opened e-mail, scroll to the sender’s name, press the menu 
key, and then touch-press Add to Contacts.
 
 The New Contacts screen opens. The sender’s first name, last name, and 
e-mail address are transferred automatically to your Contacts.
 
4. If needed, add information (such as phone number and mailing 
address).
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
Deleting e-mail
Keeping your message list tidy can help you stay organized and reduce the 
amount of memory your e-mail takes. 
Cull those messages you no longer need by following these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press Messages.
 
 
2. Highlight the e-mail you want to delete and press the Delete key.
 
 A deletion confirmation screen appears.
 
3. Touch-press Delete to confirm your deletion.
 
 The deleted e-mail is toast.
 
To delete more than one e-mail, press the cap key and scroll to highlight as 
many e-mails as you want. After you make your deletion selections, press the 
Delete key.
 
You can delete anything listed in the message list (such as an SMS or a voice 
mail) the same way you delete an e-mail message.

If you want to really clean up your old e-mails and don’t want to scroll 
through tons of messages, you can do the following:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 
2. Highlight a horizontal date mark, press the menu key, and touch-press 
Delete Prior.
 
 The date mark is simply a horizontal bar with dates. Just like you can 
highlight e-mails in the message list, you can also highlight the date 
mark.
 
 A pop-up prompts you for delete confirmation. Before you take the 
plunge, remember that going ahead will delete all the e-mails before the 
particular date mark. There is no way to retrieve deleted items from your 
BlackBerry.
 
3. Touch-press Delete to confirm your deletion.
 
 All your e-mails prior to the date mark are history.
Filtering your e-mail
Most of your e-mail isn’t urgent (and sometimes doesn’t really concern you). 
Instead of receiving them on your BlackBerry — and wasting both time and 
effort — filter them out. While in the BlackBerry Internet Service client, set up 
filters to make your BlackBerry mailbox receive only those e-mails that you 
care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive them on your main computer.)
This example creates a simple filter that treats work-related messages as 
urgent and forwards them to your BlackBerry. Follow these steps:
 
1. Log into the BlackBerry Internet Service client.
 
 Refer to Figure 7-1.
 
2. Click the Filter icon for the desired e-mail account.
 
 The Filter screen shows a list of filters that have been created. See 
Figure 7-4. 
 
Figure 7-4: 
Filter list 
screen.

 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
3. Click the Click Here link.
 
 The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Create a fil-
ter for your 
e-mail here.
 
 
4. Enter a filter name.
 
 The filter name can be anything you like. We entered WorkUrgent.
 
5. In the Apply Filter When drop-down list, choose the condition to place 
on the filter:
 
• A High-Priority Mail Arrives: Select this option if the filter applies 
only to urgent e-mail.
 
• Subject Field Contains: When selected, the Contains field is enabled; 
you can type text in it. Specify what keywords the filter will look 
for in the subject field. Separate each entry with a semicolon (;).
 
• From Field Contains: When selected, the Contains field is enabled; 
you can type text in it. Type a full or part of an address. For exam-
ple, you can type rob@robkao.com or just kao. Separate each entry 
with a semicolon (;).
 
• To Field Contains: Similar to From Field Contains.
 
• CC Field Contains: Similar to From Field Contains. 
 
 This example selects From Field Contains.
 
6. Specify the text in the Contains field.
 
 See details in the preceding step for what to enter in the Contains field. 
This example types the domain of your work e-mail address. For 
example, if your work e-mail address is myName@XYZCo.com, enter 
XYZCo.com.
 
7. Select one of the following options:
 
 Forward Messages to Handheld: You can select either or both of the 
following two check boxes:

106
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header of the e-mails 
that meets the condition(s) you set in Steps 3–5 to be sent to you. 
(A header doesn’t contain the message — just who sent it, the 
subject, and the time it was sent.) Choose this if you get automated 
alerts, where receiving only the subject is sufficient.
 
• Level 1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way of saying 
urgent e-mail. A Level1 e-mail is bold in Messages.
 
 Do Not Forward Message to Handheld: Any e-mail that meets the condi-
tions you set in Steps 3–5 doesn’t go to your BlackBerry.
 
8. Confirm your filter by clicking the Add Filter button.
 
 You return to the Filter screen, where you can see your newly created 
filter in the list.
 
If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, guesstimate and then 
check it by having a friend send you a test e-mail. If the test e-mail isn’t filtered 
correctly, set the conditions until you get them right.
Searching Messages Like a Pro
Searching is one of those functions you probably won’t use every day — but 
when you do run a search, you usually need the information fast. Take a few 
minutes here to familiarize yourself with general searching. 
The BlackBerry Messages application provides three ways to search through 
your messages. Two of the three ways are specific, and one is a broad search:
 
✓ Search by sender or recipient: Specific. This method assumes that you 
already know the sender or recipient.
 
✓ Search by subject: Specific. This approach assumes that you already 
know the subject.
 
✓ General search: Broad. You don’t have a specific assumption.
 
You can search through anything listed in the messages list. This means you 
can search through SMS and voice mail as well as e-mail.

107
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Searching by sender or recipient
Search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific message 
from a specific person. For example, suppose your brother constantly sends 
you e-mail (which means your message list has many entries from him). 
You’re trying to locate a message he sent you about two weeks ago regarding 
a fishing trip location. You’ve scrolled down the message list, but you just 
can’t find that message. 
To find a message when you know the sender or recipient, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 
2. Highlight a message that you sent to or received from that particular 
person.
 
 The choice you get in the next step depends on whether you highlighted 
a sent message or a received message.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press one of these options:
 
• From Someone Specific: Because that certain someone sent you the 
message, choose Search Sender.
 
• To Someone Specific: Because you sent that certain someone the 
message, choose Search Recipient.
 
 The search starts. Any results appear onscreen.
Searching by subject
Search by subject when you’re looking for a specifically titled e-mail. As when 
you’re searching by sender or recipient, first scroll to an e-mail bearing the 
same subject you’re searching for. Then follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 
2. Highlight an e-mail titled by the subject you’re searching for.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press Search Subject.
 
 The search starts, and the results appear onscreen.

108
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform keyword 
searches of your messages. To run a general search:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Search.
 
 The Search screen appears.
 
3. Fill in your search criteria; see Figure 7-6.
 
 The criteria for a general search follow:
 
• Name: This is the name of the sender or recipient to search by.
 
• In: This is related to Name. Use this menu to indicate where the 
name might appear. Your choices are From, To, Cc, Bcc, and any 
address field.
 
• Subject: This is where you type some or all the keywords that 
appear in the subject.
 
• Message: Enter keywords that appear in the message.
 
• Service: If you set up your BlackBerry to receive e-mail from more 
than one e-mail account, you can specify which e-mail account to 
search.
 
• Folder: This is the folder you want to look in. Generally, you should 
search all folders.
 
• Show: This list specifies how the search result will appear (namely, 
whether you want to see only e-mails that you sent or e-mails that 
you received). Your choices are Sent and Received, Received Only, 
Sent Only, Saved Only, Draft Only, and Unopened Only.
 
• Type: This list specifies the type of message you’re trying to search 
for. Your choices are All, E-mail, E-mail with Attachments, PIN, 
SMS, Phone, and Voice Mail.
 
 From the Search screen shown in Figure 7-6, you can have multiple 
search criteria or just a single one; it’s up to you.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Search to launch your search.
 
 The search results appear onscreen.

109
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
Figure 7-6: 
The Search 
screen in 
Messages.
 
 
You can narrow the search results by performing a second search on the ini-
tial results. For example, you can search by sender and then narrow those 
results by performing a second search by subject.
You can also search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific 
message from a specific person. To do so, scroll to an e-mail bearing the spe-
cific sender or recipient. Press the menu key and touch-press Search Sender 
or Search Recipient. If the e-mail that you highlighted is an incoming e-mail, 
you’ll see Search Sender. If the e-mail is outgoing, you’ll see Search Recipient.
Saving search results
If you find yourself re-searching with the same criteria over and over, you 
might want to save the search and then reuse it. Here’s how:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Search.
 
 The Search screen appears.

110
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
3. Fill in your search criteria.
 
 Refer to the “Running a general search” section in this chapter for 
option explanations.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
 The Save Search screen appears, from which you can name your search 
and assign it a shortcut key. See Figure 7-7.
 
Figure 7-7: 
Name your 
search and 
assign it a 
shortcut 
key.
 
 
5. In the Title field, enter a name.
 
 The title is the name of your search, which appears in the Search Result 
screen.
 
6. Touch-press the Shortcut Key field, and then touch-press a letter from 
the drop-down list.
 
 You have 20-plus letters to choose from. 
 
7. Confirm your saved search by pressing the menu key and touch-
pressing Save.

111
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Reusing saved searches 
Your BlackBerry comes with five saved search results. Any new saved result 
makes your search that much more robust.
You can see all saved search results:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Search.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press Recall.
 
 The recall screen opens, and you can see the five preloaded search 
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 7-8.
To reuse one of the saved search results, choose a search from the list 
(shown in Figure 7-8), press the menu key, and touch-press Search.
 
If you have multiple accounts, set up a search shortcut so you view one spe-
cific account when you want to (for example, you have Gmail for personal and 
your small business e-mail account both set up on your BlackBerry). You see 
e-mail from both in the Messages application, which can be overwhelming. 
From the General Search screen, set the Service criteria to the one you want, 
and follow the steps to save the search and assign a shortcut key. The next 
time you want to see one account, you can get to it in an instance!

Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry e-mail storage has 
limits, too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails are kept in your 
BlackBerry. (The default is 30 days. Pshew.) 
You can choose several options: from 15 days to forever, and because your 
BlackBerry Storm comes with 1GB of internal memory, it should last you a 
while!
 
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want, saving a mes-
sage is a good way to make sure you don’t lose an important message.
To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Open the Messages application. 
 
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
3. Touch-press General Options. 
 
4. Touch-press Keep Messages and then touch-press Forever.
 
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you’ll seldom need to worry about 
your e-mails being automatically deleted. 
 
 A good way to archive your e-mail is to back up your e-mails by 
using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. See Chapter 16 for more on 
backing up your BlackBerry on your PC. 
 
• Time Option: If you choose a set time option, any message older 
than that time frame is automatically deleted from your BlackBerry 
the next time you reboot your BlackBerry. However, it will be 
deleted only on your BlackBerry — even if you turn on e-mail rec-
onciliation — because these deletions are not completed manually 
by you.
 
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and touch-pressing 
Save.

▶ Using Short and Multimedia Messaging Service
▶ Setting up and using Instant Messenger (IM)
Y
our BlackBerry Storm is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail as 
a major driver. It’s a wonderful technology, but you might find yourself 
in a situation where other means of communication are more appropriate. 
For instance, e-mail isn’t the tool of choice for instant messaging — most 
people would find that method slow and cumbersome. Nor is e-mail the best 
tool to use when you want to alert someone to something.
Your BlackBerry offers some less obvious ways to communicate — ways 
that might serve as the perfect fit for a special situation. Here you get the 
inside scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and text messaging (also known as 
Short Messaging Service, or SMS). We also give you tips on how to turn your 
BlackBerry into a lean (and not-so-mean) instant messaging (IM) machine.
Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
What happens when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging? First and foremost, we’ll 
get the acronym out of the way. PIN stands for personal identification number 
(familiar to anyone who’s ever used an ATM) and uniquely identifies your 
device.
 
PIN-to-PIN, then, is another way of saying one BlackBerry to another BlackBerry.

114
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
As for the other details, they’re straightforward. PIN-to-PIN messaging is 
based on the technology underpinning two-way pager systems. Unlike send-
ing a standard e-mail, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, the message 
doesn’t venture outside RIM’s infrastructure in search of an e-mail server and 
(eventually) an e-mail inbox. Instead, it stays solidly in the RIM (Research In 
Motion) world, where it’s shunted through the recipient’s network provider 
until it ends up on the recipient’s BlackBerry.
Here’s the neat part. According to RIM, the message isn’t saved anywhere in 
this universe except on the one device that sends the PIN message and the 
other device that receives it. Compare that with an e-mail, which is saved 
in at least four separate locations (the mail client and e-mail servers of both 
sender and recipient) not to mention all the system’s redundancies and 
backups. Think of it this way: If you whisper a little secret in someone’s ear, 
only you and that special someone know what was said. In a way, PIN-to-PIN 
messaging is the same thing, with one BlackBerry whispering to another 
BlackBerry. Now that’s discreet.
If you tend to read the financial newspapers — especially those that cover 
corporate lawsuits extensively — you know that there’s no such thing as 
private e-mail. PIN-to-PIN messaging — in theory at least — is as good as the 
old Code of Silence. Now, is such privacy really an advantage? You can argue 
both sides of the issue, depending on what you want to use PIN-to-PIN messag-
ing for.
Basically, if you like the idea that your communications can be kept discreet, 
PIN-to-PIN messaging has great curb appeal. If you don’t care about privacy 
issues, though, you still might be impressed by PIN-to-PIN messaging’s zippy 
nature. (It really is the Ferrari of wireless communication — way faster than 
e-mail.)
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When you try to call somebody on the telephone, you can’t get far without a 
telephone number. As you might expect, the same principle applies to PIN-to-
PIN messaging: no PIN, no PIN-to-PIN messaging.
 
In practical terms, you need the PIN of any BlackBerry you want to send a PIN 
message. (You also need to find your own PIN so you can hand it out to those 
folks who want to message you.)
The cautious side of you might be wondering why on earth you’d give your 
PIN to somebody. This PIN isn’t the same as your password. In fact, this PIN 
doesn’t give anybody access to your BlackBerry or do anything to compro-
mise security. It’s simply an identification; you treat it the same way you treat 
your phone number.

115
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
RIM makes getting hold of a PIN easy. In fact, you get two quick paths to PIN 
enlightenment:
 
✓ From the Message screen: Send your PIN from the Message screen with 
the help of a keyword. When you type a preset word, your BlackBerry 
replaces what you type with a bit of information specific to your device. 
Sound wacky? It’s actually easier than it sounds.
 
 To see what we mean, just compose a new message. (Chapter 7 gives 
you the basics on the whole e-mail message and messaging thing, if you 
need a refresher.) In the subject or body of your message, type mypin 
and add a space. As soon as you type the space, mypin is miraculously 
transformed into your PIN in the format pin:your-pin-number, as 
shown in Figure 8-1. Isn’t that neat? Note: Case doesn’t matter here.
 
 mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you. You can try 
mynumber for your phone number and myver for the OS version of your 
Storm.
 
✓ From the Status screen: Most BlackBerry models display the Status 
screen when you touch-press in succession the following links starting 
from the Home screen: menu, Options, and Status. Figure 8-2 shows a 
typical Status screen. (The PIN is fourth on the list of items shown.)
A little bit of RIM history
Sometime during the last millennium, Research 
In Motion (RIM) wasn’t even in the phone busi-
ness. Before BlackBerry became all the rage 
with SmartPhone features, RIM was doing a 
tidy little business with its wireless e-mail. Back 
then, RIM’s primitive wireless e-mail service 
was served by network service providers on a 
radio bandwidth, namely DataTAC and Mobitex 
networks. These were separate from a typi-
cal cellphone infrastructure’s bandwidth. RIM 
devices at that time already had PIN-to-PIN 
messaging. This type of messaging is akin to a 
pager, where a message doesn’t live in a mail-
box but is sent directly to the BlackBerry with-
out any delay. (No one wants a paging system 
that moves at turtle speed when you can get 
one that moves like a jack rabbit, right?)
Several interesting facts followed from RIM’s 
initial decision. Of note, most cellphone users in 
New York City were left without service during 
the 9/11 disaster. As you can understand, the 
entire cellphone infrastructure in New York and 
surrounding areas was overwhelmed when 
faced with too many people trying to use the 
bandwidth available. However, one commu-
nication device continued to work during that 
stressful time — RIM’s PIN-to-PIN messaging 
kept the information flow going.

Assigning PINs to names
So, you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the trouble of 
finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now the trick is finding 
a convenient place to store your PINs so you can use them. Luckily for you, 
you have an obvious choice: BlackBerry Contacts. And RIM, in its infinite 
wisdom, makes storing such info a snap. To add a PIN to someone’s contact 
info in Contacts, do the following:

117
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Highlight a contact name; press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Edit.
 
 The Edit Contact screen appears.
 
4. Scroll down to the PIN field, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Add a con-
tact’s PIN 
info here.
 
 
5. Type the PIN.
 
6. Press the menu key.
 
7. Touch-press Save.
 
 It’s that simple. Of course, it’s even easier if you think ahead and enter 
the PIN information you have when you set up your initial contact info 
(by using the New Address screen), but we understand that a PIN isn’t 
the kind of information people carry around.
 
If all this talk about New Address screens and Edit Address screens doesn’t 
sound familiar, check out Chapter 4, which covers the Contacts application in 
more detail.

118
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
 
PIN-to-PIN means from one BlackBerry to another.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than sending an e-mail. Follow 
these steps if you have a contact’s PIN stored in Contacts:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Touch-press a contact name and press the menu key.
 
 If a contact has a PIN, you see a menu item titled PIN <contact 
name>. Say you have a contact named Rob Kao. When you touch-press 
his name in the list and press the menu key, PIN Rob Kao appears as a 
menu option, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
3. Touch-press PIN <contact name> from the menu.
 
 The New Message screen appears, with your buddy’s PIN already 
entered.
 
4. Enter the rest of the text boxes — subject, message body, and 
signoff — just as you would an e-mail.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Send a PIN 
message 
via your 
Contacts.
 
Alternatively, if you know the PIN, you can also type it directly. Here’s how:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press Messages.
 
 
 The Messages application opens.

119
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Compose PIN.
 
 The ever-familiar New Message screen makes an appearance.
 
4. Type the PIN in the To field.
 
5. Add a subject, the message, and sign off just like you would in an 
e-mail.
Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous lack of a 
paper trail, as it were), companies can disable PIN-to-PIN messaging on your 
BlackBerry device. (No paper trail can mean legal problems down the road — 
can you say Sarbanes-Oxley?)
 
If your BlackBerry is from your employer and you don’t see the PIN menu 
item, you can safely assume that your employer has disabled it. Contact your 
BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) administrator to make sure. Keep in mind 
that even if your company has disabled PIN-to-PIN messaging, folks can still 
PIN you — you just can’t PIN them back.
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than receiving a standard 
e-mail. You get the same entry in your Messages list for the PIN-to-PIN mes-
sage, and the same screen appears when you open the message.
By default, your BlackBerry vibrates to alert you, but you can change this in 
Profiles (check Chapter 3 for more details on changing your profile). When 
you reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well — that is, 
as long as your BlackBerry is set up to send PIN-to-PIN messages. Otherwise, 
you can’t reply, period.
 
Regardless of whether your BlackBerry is enabled for sending PIN-to-PIN mes-
sages, you can always receive a PIN message. BES administrators can mandate 
that you can’t send PIN messages, but that can’t stop you from receiving them.
Keeping in Touch the SMS/MMS Way
Short Messaging Service (also known as SMS or text messaging) is so popu-
lar these days that you can vote that way — for an American Idol, anyway. 
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is the latest evolution of SMS. Rather 
than a simple text message, you can also send an audio or video clip.
 
How short is short? The maximum size per message is about 160 characters. If 
you send more than that, it gets broken down into multiple messages.

120
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
Moreover, SMS is an established technology (not a new and unproven thing, in 
other words) that’s been popular for years in Europe and Asia.
 
Text messaging does pose a challenge for beginners. It isn’t tough; it’s just 
cumbersome to type the letters by using the size of virtual keypad. Also, you 
need to know the trends and options for text messaging. In-the-know folks use 
abbreviations that might be difficult for you to understand in the beginning, so 
don’t dive in without your oxygen tank.
A quick preparation goes a long way toward avoiding being labeled uncool 
when it comes to your SMS syntax. The upcoming sections help smooth your 
path a bit by filling you in on the basics of SMS-speak.
Using shorthand for speedy replies
On a regular cellphone, three letters share one key. As you can imagine, 
trying to bang out even a single paragraph can be a real pain.
Human ingenuity prevails. Abbreviations cut down on the amount you need 
to enter. This texting (short for text messaging) language is quite hip, espe-
cially among the 14–18-year-old set. Veteran text messagers (the hip ones, 
at least) can easily spot someone who’s new to SMS technology by how they 
don’t use the right lingo (or use such lingo incorrectly).
SMS is a smash!
In the early days of SMS, phone providers gave 
away their text messaging services for free. It 
caught on like wildfire, especially in develop-
ing countries where folks are a tad more cost-
conscious. In those countries, it didn’t take long 
before lots of folks started carrying a cellphone 
just to avail themselves of the free text messag-
ing. Adding to the appeal was the fact that many 
network service providers didn’t even force you 
to pay for a plan; you could walk into any con-
venience store and buy a prepaid Subscriber 
Identification Module (SIM) card, no questions 
asked.
In the United States, however, it took some 
time for SMS to catch up. For one thing, net-
work service providers in the U.S. are divided 
between CDMA and GSM/GPRS technology. 
(See Chapter 1 for more on that divide.) GSM/
GPRS phones have allowed for SMS since 
1991; CDMA phones didn’t until about 2000. 
(Competing innovations do have a downside, 
right?) The second reason is that most U.S. 
homes are wired for regular phone service, so 
cellphones aren’t necessarily seen as some-
thing you just gotta have. Eventually, though, 
the convenience of using cellphones will make 
them more and more attractive — and, of 
course, SMS is the next logical step.

121
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
 
SMS beginners might be tempted to rely on BlackBerry’s default SureType fea-
ture when texting. SureType is a technology used initially in BlackBerry 7100 
series and carried on in the BlackBerry Storm. SureType compensates for the 
limited keys when you hold your BlackBerry up-and-down (portrait mode). 
The software is smart enough to predict what you want to type. It also can 
become smarter as you use it. The technology lets you type words faster and 
more easily on the portrait mode. However, you might get texts from buddies 
who use cool, with-it, hip, shorthand lingo, and you respond with uncool, with-
out-it, lame, complete words provided for you by SureType technology.
To preserve (or create) your cool image, hold your Storm lengthwise (land-
scape) and you get a full QWERTY keyboard, which means SureType is disabled.
Awhfy?
When texting, you want to craft a sentence with as few letters as possible. 
Because texting has been around for years, plenty of folks have risen to this 
challenge by coming up with a considerable pool of useful abbreviations. 
Don’t feel you have to rush out and memorize the whole shorthand diction-
ary at once, though.
 
As with mastering a new language, start out with the most commonly used 
words or sentences. Then when you become familiar with those, slowly gather in 
more and more terms. In time, the whole shorthand thing will be second nature.
And what are the most commonly used terms out there? Funny you should 
ask. Table 8-1 gives our take on the most common abbreviations, which are 
enough to get you started. With these under your belt, you can at least follow 
the most important parts of an SMS conversation. Feel free to check out the 
Web site associated with this book (www.blackberryfordummies.com) for 
a more comprehensive list of shorthand abbreviations.
Showing some emotion
Written words have gotten folks into trouble now and then; the very same words 
can mean different things to different people. A simple example is the phrase, 
“You’re clueless.” When you speak such a phrase (with the appropriate facial 
and hand gestures), your friend knows (we hope) that you’re teasing and that 
it’s all a bit of fun. Write that same phrase in a text message and, well, you might 
get a nasty reply in return — which you then have to respond to, which prompts 
another response, and soon enough you’ve just ended a seven-year friendship.

SMS is akin to chatting, so emoticons show what you meant when you wrote 
“You’re clueless.” (I’m joking! I’m happy! I’m mad!) These cutesy codes let 
you telegraph your meaning in sledgehammer-to-the-forehead fashion.

 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
We’re talking smileys — those combinations of keyboard characters 
that, when artfully combined, resemble a human face. The most popular 
example — one that you’ve probably encountered in e-mails from especially 
chirpy individuals — is the happy face, which (usually at the end of a 
statement) conveys good intentions or a happy context, like this : ). (Turn 
the top of your head to the left to see the face.)
Table 8-2 shows you the range of smiley choices. Just remember that smileys 
are supposed to be fun. They could be the one thing you need to make sure 
that your gently teasing remark isn’t seen as a hateful comment. Smileys 
help, but if you aren’t sure if what you’re about to send can be misconstrued 
even with the help of the smileys, just don’t send it.

Sending a text message
After you have the shorthand stuff and smileys under control, get your fingers 
pumped up and ready for action: It’s message sending time! Whether it’s SMS 
or MMS, here’s how it’s done:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch-press Contacts.
 
 
 The Contacts opens.
 
2. Touch-press a contact that has a mobile phone number.
 
 SMS only works on mobile phones.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
4. Touch-press SMS (or MMS) <contact name>.
 
 The menu item for SMS or MMS displays the name. For example, if you 
choose John Doe, the menu item reads SMS John Doe or MMS John 
Doe, as shown in Figure 8-5. (Note the space right underneath the screen 
heading for entering your text message.)
 
Figure 8-5: 
Start your 
text mes-
sage here.
 
 
5. If you chose MMS, browse from your multimedia folders and touch-
press the file you want to send.

125
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
 
 This extra step lets you choose the multimedia file. This is the only dif-
ference between SMS and MMS with regards to sending a message.
 
6. Type your message.
 
 Remember that shorthand business? You should start taking advantage 
of it the first chance you get. Practice makes perfect.
 
7. Press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
8. Touch-press Send.
 
 Your message is sent on its merry way.
Viewing a message
If you have an incoming SMS or MMS message, you get notified. The e-mail 
icon on the top of the Home screen indicates a new message. In fact, every-
thing about viewing SMS and MMS messages is pretty much the same as read-
ing e-mail. The basic run-through is as follows:
 
 
1. Touch-press Messages from Home screen.
 
 
2. Touch-press the unread message.
 
 Bob’s your uncle: The message appears onscreen.
 
You can customize how BlackBerry tells you that you have a message. 
Chapter 3 has the scoop on customizing your BlackBerry, including SMS notifi-
cation. (Look for the section about customizing your profile.)
 
You can tell your BlackBerry to separate SMS from e-mails. 
 
1. Touch-press Messages from Home screen.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Options.
 
4. Touch-press General Options.
 
5. Touch-press SMS and Email Inboxes selections.
 
6. Touch-press Separate.
 
7. Press the escape key and touch-press Save.
 
 An icon for SMS appears on the home screen.

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Messaging — Instantly
Real-time (as they happen) conversations with your friends over the Internet 
are easier with Instant Messenger (IM). IM allows two or more people to send 
and receive messages over the Internet. It all started with pure text messages 
and evolved into a rich medium involving voice and even video conversation 
in real time.
 
IM may not be in your BlackBerry Storm. The service provider chooses 
whether to include it. (Most providers, however, do support it for the 
BlackBerry Storm.) You can add Instant Messenger to your BlackBerry even 
if it didn’t come with it. Open your browser, go to http://mobile.black
berry.com, and navigate to the following pages in sequence: Applications 
and Staying in Touch. On this page, you see a download link to BlackBerry 
Messenger.
Messaging etiquette and a few words of caution
Here are some commonsense messaging rules 
as well as a few words of caution. Being new to 
messaging doesn’t give you license to act like 
a jerk. Play nice and take the following pointers 
to heart:
 ✓ Use smileys to avoid misunderstandings. 
Read more about emoticons and smileys 
earlier in this chapter.
 ✓ Don’t ever forward chain letters. We mean 
it. Never.
 ✓ If you need to forward a message, check 
the entire message first. Make sure nothing 
offends the recipient.
 ✓ Some things in this world need to be said 
face-to-face, so don’t even think of texting 
sensitive issues. Ever try dumping your 
girlfriend or boyfriend over the phone? 
Guess what. Using messaging is far worse.
 ✓ Keep your tone gender neutral. 
Some messages that are forwarded 
through e-mails are inappropriate to the 
opposite sex.
 ✓ All-capital letters are like shouting. So 
DON’T USE THEM.
 ✓ Know your recipient. A newbie may not 
know smileys and shorthand, so act accord-
ingly. (Read more about shorthand earlier in 
this chapter.)
 ✓ Don’t reply to any message when you’re 
angry. You can’t unsend a sent message. 
Better to be prudent than sorry.
 ✓ Don’t gossip or be rude. Beware! Your mes-
sages can end up in the wrong hands and 
haunt you in the future.
 ✓ Easy does it. No documented evidence 
reveals the deleterious effects (physi-
cal or psychological) of too much tex-
ting. However, don’t text as if you want to 
enter the books as the first recorded case 
of Instantmesssagingitis. As your great-
grandma would tell you, too much of any-
thing is bad for you. It’s easy to lose track 
of time when IMing.

127
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
Chatting using IM rules
When you’re IMing — that’s right; it’s a verb — you can tell lots of things:
 
✓ When someone’s typing a message to you
 
✓ Whether your buddies are online
 
✓ When your buddies are away from their computers
 
✓ When your buddies are simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment
IM adds a totally different slant on long-distance communication, opening a 
wide array of possibilities — possibilities that can be used for good (team 
collaboration) or ill (mindless gossip), depending on the situation.
As you might expect, IM is great for both personal and business applica-
tions. Whether you’re maintaining friendships or working to create new ones, 
Instant Messenger is definitely one powerful tool to consider adding to your 
social skills toolbox.
Instant messaging on BlackBerry Storm
Most network providers dish out the three most popular IM services on this 
planet to their Storm customers:
 
✓ Google Talk
 
✓ Yahoo! Messenger
 
✓ Windows Live Messenger (from the giant Microsoft)
Those three IM programs aren’t the only popular ones:
 
✓ AOL Instant Messenger
 
✓ ICQ Instant Messenger
 
✓ iChat AV (on the Macintosh)
 
✓ Jabber (open source, also known as free)
If you’re using an IM network that isn’t preloaded, you can always check 
RIM’s Web site to download the applications: mobile.blackberry.com. On 
this page, go to Applications and then navigate to Staying in Touch. The list 
of IM applications is listed on this page with a link for download.

128
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
IM basics: What you need
Assuming your plan includes SMS, you just need two things to start using the 
standard four IM programs:
 
✓ User ID
 
✓ Password
Getting a user ID/password combo is a breeze. Just go to the appropriate 
registration Web page (listed next) for the IM application(s) you want to use. 
Use your desktop or laptop for signing up. It’s easier and faster that way.
 
✓ Google Talk: www.google.com/accounts/
NewAccount?service=talk
 
✓ AOL Instant Messenger (AIM): aim.aol.com/aimnew/Aim/
register.adp?promo=106723&pageset=Aim&client=no
 
✓ ICQ: www.icq.com/register
 
✓ MSN Messenger: messenger.msn.com/download/getstarted.aspx
 
✓ Y! Messenger: edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?.
src=pg&.done=http://messenger.yahoo.com
 
Given the many IM network choices available, your friends are probably 
signed up on a bunch of different networks. You may end up having to sign up 
for multiple networks if you want to reach them all by using IM.
Going online with IM
After you obtain the user ID/password combo for one of the IM services, you 
can use your BlackBerry to start chatting with your buddies by following 
these steps:
 
1. Touch-press the icon of the application of your choice.
 
 Figure 8-6 shows the login screen for Google Talk. It’s straightforward, 
with the standard screen name or ID line and password line. Other ser-
vices offer a similar login screen.
 
2. Enter your screen name/ID and password.
 
3. (Optional) Touch-press the Save Password and Auto Sign In boxes.
 
 When you enable the Save Password check box, the ID/password infor-
mation is already entered the next time you come to this screen. (You 
don’t have to type this stuff every time you want to IM.)

129
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
 
Figure 8-6: 
Login 
screen for 
Google Talk.
 
 
 We recommend enabling Save Password to save time but also set your 
handheld password to Enabled so you’re not compromising security. 
Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher on how to enable passwords 
on your BlackBerry.
 
 The Auto Sign In check box turns on and off automatic sign-in when your 
BlackBerry Storm is powered up. Auto Sign In is helpful if you have a 
habit of turning off your BlackBerry periodically.
 
4. Press the menu key and touch-press Sign In.
 
 Google Talk tries to log you in and displays Signing in you’re 
your_loging_id. After you’re logged in, your contacts (buddies), 
appear on the screen.
 
5. Touch-press the person you want to chat with.
 
 A menu appears, listing various things you can do. Features could differ 
a little bit for each IM application, but for Google Talk, here’s a list of 
what you can do:
 
• Start Chat
 
• Send File
 
• Add a Friend
 
• Rename
 
• Remove
 
• Block
 
6. Touch-press the action you want.
Adding a contact/buddy
Before you can start chatting with your buddies, you need to know their user 
IDs as well. Table 8-3 shows how you can obtain user IDs from the various 
messenger services.

130
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm

Luckily for you, you don’t need to search around for IDs every time you want 
to IM someone. You can store IDs as part of a contact list:
 
1. Starting in the IM service of your choice, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Add a Friend (see Figure 8-7).
 
 The Add a Friend screen appears.
 
Figure 8-7: 
The Google 
Talk menu.
 
 
3. Enter your contact’s user ID in the Add a Friend screen.
 
4. Touch-press OK.
 
 IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact is a valid user ID. If 
the ID is valid, the application adds it to your list of contacts. The buddy 
goes either to the Online or Offline section of your list, depending on 
whether your buddy is logged in. You’re warned if the ID you entered 
isn’t valid.
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your contacts (a safe 
assumption on our part, we think). By sending a message within the IM appli-
cation, you’re initiating a conversation. Here are the details on how to do it:

131
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
 
1. Log in to the IM application of your choice.
 
2. Touch-press the person you want to contact.
 
 A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion lists old mes-
sages sent to and received from this contact. You type your message at 
the bottom part of the screen.
 
3. Type your message.
 
 Use the BlackBerry in landscape (sideways) mode so it’s easier to type.
 
4. Touch-press the enter key.
 
 Your user ID plus the message you just sent shows up in the topmost 
(history) section of the chat screen. When you get a message, it’s added 
to the history section so both sides of your conversation stay in view.
Sending your smile
You can quickly add emoticons to your message (without you remembering 
all the character equivalents in Table 8-2):
 
1. While you’re typing your message, press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
2. Touch-press Show Symbols.
 
 All the icons appear.
 
3. Touch-press the one you want.
 
 The emoticon is added to your message.
Using BlackBerry Messenger
RIM has entered the IM horse race in the form of a spirited filly named — you 
guessed it — BlackBerry Messenger. This application is based on the PIN-
to-PIN messaging technology described earlier in this chapter, which means 
that it’s mucho fast and quite reliable.
 
However, with BlackBerry Messenger, you can chat with only those buddies 
who have a BlackBerry and also have PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled.
The application supports IM features common to many of the other applica-
tions, such as group chatting and the capability to monitor the availability of 
other IM buddies.
Running BlackBerry Messenger
Touch-press BlackBerry Messenger from the Home screen. The very first 
time you run BlackBerry Messenger it asks for two things:

132
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
✓ Your display name (see Figure 8-8)
 
✓ A password (in case you need to restore your contact list in the future)
 
Figure 8-8:

Messenger 
prompts 
you to enter 
your display 
name.
 
You see a contact list the next time you open the application, as shown on 
the left in Figure 8-9. (Okay, we know it looks empty here, but we show you 
how to populate it in a minute.)
Pressing the menu key lets you do these things (see the right side of 
Figure 8-9):
 
✓ Customize the groupings
 
✓ Add a contact
 
✓ Set your availability
 
✓ Start a conversation
 
✓ Change your options
 
Figure 8-9: 
The 
BlackBerry 
Messenger 
contact list 
(left) and 
menu (right).
 

133
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
Adding a contact
With nobody in your contact list, BlackBerry Messenger is pretty useless. 
Your first order of business is to add a contact to your list — someone you 
know who
 
✓ Has a BlackBerry
 
✓ Is entered in your Contacts
 
✓ Has PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled
 
✓ Has a copy of BlackBerry Messenger installed on her device
If you know someone who fits these criteria, you can add that person to your 
list by doing the following:
 
1. In BlackBerry Messenger, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Add a Contact.
 
 All the contacts in your BlackBerry Contacts show up onscreen.
 
3. Touch-press the name you want to add to your BlackBerry Messenger 
contact list.
 
 A Message dialog box displays the Permission Request message. 
BlackBerry sends the request to the potential contact. You can edit the 
message that’s sent.
 
4. Type your message.
 
5. Touch-press OK.
 
6. Touch-press OK again.
 
 The application sends your request. As long as the person hasn’t 
responded to your request, his name appears as part of the Pending 
Contacts group, as shown in Figure 8-10. When your contact responds 
positively to your request, that name goes to the official contact list.
 
Figure 8-10: 
To-be-
approved 
contacts 
are in the 
Pending 
Contacts 
group.
 

134
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Starting a conversation
You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts:
 
1. In the BlackBerry Messenger main menu, touch-press the name in 
your contact list.
 
 A traditional chat interface opens, with a list of old messages at the top 
and a text box for typing messages at the bottom.
 
2. Type your message.
 
3. Touch-press the enter key.
 
 Any messages you send (as well as any responses you get) are appended 
to the history list at the top.
Starting a group conversation
You can easily invite others to your BlackBerry Messenger conversation:
 
1. During a conversation, press the menu key.
 
 The BlackBerry Messenger main menu appears. This time an Invite 
option has been added.
 
2. Touch-press Invite.
 
 A Select a Contact screen opens.
 
3. Touch-press people, one at a time.
 
 You can choose any number of people.
 
4. Touch-press OK.
 
 You’re back to the previous conversation screen, but this time the his-
tory list text lists the contacts you added to the conversation. The newly 
selected contact can now join in the conversation.
Taking control of your IM app
If you use IM frequently — and you tend to chat with many contacts all at the 
same time — your BlackBerry Storm’s physical limitations may cramp your 
IM style. No matter whether you use AIM, Y! Messenger, ICQ, MSN Messenger, 
or BlackBerry Messenger, it’s still slower to type words on the virtual keypad 
than it is to type on your PC.
Do you just give up on the dream of IMing on the go? Not necessarily. This 
section shows how you can power up your BlackBerry IM technique.

135
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 
Less is more
If you can’t keep up with all your buddies, your best bet is to limit your expo-
sure. Take a whack at your contact list so that only your true buddies remain 
as contacts whom you want to IM from your BlackBerry. Trimming your list is 
easy: Use the Delete option from your BlackBerry Messenger main menu.
 
Deleting a contact or buddy from an IM application on your BlackBerry also 
deletes it from the desktop or laptop computer version of the app. That’s 
because the list of contacts is maintained at a central location — an IM server, 
to be precise — and not on your BlackBerry.
 
A simple workaround here is to set up two accounts of your favorite IM appli-
cation — one for your BlackBerry and one for your desktop. By using these 
accounts separately, you can limit the number of contacts you have on your 
BlackBerry and still maintain a full-blown list of contacts on your desktop.
Less typing, fewer emoticons
Cut down your typing time. Don’t forget the shorthand described previously. 
It’s widely used in IM as well, so refer to Table 8-1 whenever you can so that 
you can quickly respond. Before you know it, you’ll have the abbreviations 
memorized and use them with ease.
SMS versus connecting via the Web
 
SMS messages are short messages designed for cellphones. IM is a step up. It 
provides a better real-time conversation experience across distances. These 
two technologies evolved in parallel. As more people use IM, it becomes 
apparent that this technology has a place in handheld devices, where 
mobility is an advantage. Some of the IM programs developed and used in 
the BlackBerry in the past use SMS behind the scenes. And because your 
BlackBerry can connect to the Internet, other programs use the Internet 
directly. These differences can affect your monthly bill as well as your messag-
ing experience. Read on.
 
If you don’t have unlimited SMS but have an unlimited data plan, be careful 
for any third-party IM software. Make sure that it’s using the Internet instead 
of SMS. If it’s using an SMS, you’ll incur charges for every message sent and 
received. As of this writing, most network providers charge 20 cents for every 
SMS message. If you’re a heavy IM user, 20 cents adds up quickly and will be a 
nasty surprise on your monthly bill.
Some third-party IM software allows group conversations. This isn’t available 
on the IM software that comes with Storm.
Please check out the Web site associated with this book for updates 
regarding these (and other) recommendations.

136
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Jive on
Other options exist, such as
 ✓ BeejiveIM at www.beejive.com/
download/blackberry.htm. This 
one-time fee program connects directly to 
the Web instead of using SMS. Works with 
multiple IM networks, multiple accounts 
per network: AIM, MSN Messenger, Y! 
Messenger, GoogleTalk, ICQ, Jabber, 
and MySpace IM. This is one of the best 
options.
 ✓ Nimbuzz at www.nimbuzz.com. Nimbuzz 
supports many of the popular IM networks. 
It even supports calls using the Skype 
network. And the best thing is it’s free and 
does not use SMS. 
 ✓ IM+ at www.shapeservices.com/
eng/im/blackberry. If you don’t 
want to pay annually, consider this service. 
IM+ only asks for a one-time fee and also 
supports Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, ICQ, Google 
Talk, and Jabber networks. The best thing 
about IM+ is that it sends messages by 
using the Internet rather than SMS, which 
is best suited for people who have the 
unlimited data plan. You have to choose a 
version: The Regular version connects to 
BES. BES is used by companies as a way of 
connecting the BlackBerry platform to the 
corporate network and e-mail server. The 
WAP version allows a personal BlackBerry 
to use the network provider’s WAP gate-
way to connect to the Internet. The Shape 
Services Web site has a comprehensive 
FAQ (frequently asked questions) for details 
about the software.

▶ Customizing and optimizing Browser
▶ Downloading and installing applications from the Web
▶ Browsers in business
I
t’s hard to believe that just over 13 years ago, fewer folks had Internet 
access than didn’t. Today, nearly everyone can surf the Web anytime, 
anywhere, and you can do it with a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or 
even a tiny mobile device such as a PDA or a SmartPhone. Having said that,
it should be no surprise that your Blackberry Storm has a Web browser of 
its own.
In this chapter, we help you use Blackberry Storm’s Browser. We offer 
shortcuts and throw in timesaving tips, including the coolest ways to make 
pages load faster and a complete neat-freak’s guide to managing your 
bookmarks.
Your network service provider might also have its own browser for you to 
use. We compare these proprietary (company-specific) browsers with the 
default BlackBerry Storm’s Browser so you can decide which best suits your 
needs.
Brewing Up a Storm Browser
BlackBerry Storm’s Browser comes loaded on your SmartPhone and accesses 
the Web by a cellphone connection. When you run your Blackberry Storm 
on BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), the application is called BlackBerry 
Browser; otherwise, it’s called Internet Browser. We just use Browser to make 
things easier.

138
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Blackberry supports multiple browsers and Storm includes two:
 
✓ One that’s connected to your BES server
 
✓ One that goes directly to your service provider’s network
If you’re a corporate BlackBerry Storm user, your company administrator 
might turn off the browser or not install the network service browser. The 
browser that comes with your network service provider might be called by 
its brand name.
The following sections get you started using Browser. After you get your feet 
wet, we promise that you’ll be chomping at the bit to find out more!
Getting to the Browser
Browser is one of the main applications of your SmartPhone, with its Globe 
icon visible on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 9-1. Touch-press this 
icon to launch Browser. Opening Browser by touch-pressing its icon on the 
Home screen gives you a list of bookmarks. If you haven’t added bookmarks, 
the opening Browser screen looks like Figure 9-2. You can find out more 
about adding bookmarks later in this chapter.
 
Figure 9-1: 
You can 
open 
Browser 
from the 
Home 
screen.

 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Figure 9-2: 
Browser 
with the 
default 
empty 
Bookmarks 
screen.
 
 
If Browser is your default browser, you can access it from any application 
that can identify a Web address. For example, from Contacts, you can open 
Browser by opening the link on the Web Page field. If you get an e-mail con-
taining a Web address, just touch-press that link to open the page. By default, 
accessing Browser by touch-pressing a Web address within another applica-
tion opens the Web page associated with that address. (In Figure 9-3, we’re 
opening Browser from the Messages application.)

After you locate Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web:
 
 
1. Open Browser.
 
 
2. Type a Web address.
 
 You can see the one we’ve typed in Figure 9-4.
 
3. Touch-press OK.
 
 The Web page appears. While the page is loading, progress is indicated 
at the bottom of the screen.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Opening a 
Web page is 
simple.
 
 
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web page, you can 
touch-press that information. Touch-pressing initiates a phone call or opens a 
new e-mail message (depending on which type of link you touched).
Moving around on a Web page
Using Browser to go to a Web page is easy. Note that Web page addresses, 
also known as hyperlinks, are highlighted onscreen. To jump to a particular 
page, just touch-press the link.

 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Here are few shortcuts you can use while moving around on a Web page:
 
✓ To stop loading a page, press the escape key.
 
✓ After a page is completely onscreen, go back to the previous page by 
pressing the escape key.
Figure 9-5 points out what you can do with the navigation bar at the bottom 
of the screen. The images from left to right are shortcuts:
 
✓ Star: Opens the Bookmarks screen.
 
✓ www: Opens the new page, which is the same as touch-pressing Get Link 
from the menu.
 
✓ Page: Toggles between Page and Column view.
 
✓ Arrow pointing left: Goes back to the previous page.

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
Figure 9-6: 
The 
Browser 
menu has 
lots of good 
stuff.
 
The Browser menu offers these options:
 
✓ Page View: Appears only if you’re in Column View. This view allows you 
to see the page as you’d normally see it on your PC’s Internet browser. 
The compressed version of the Web page takes up the entire screen first. 
You have the option of zooming in and out available as a menu option.
 
✓ Column View: This default view normally doesn’t appear as a menu 
option. It shows up only if you’re currently in the Page View. The Web 
page is vertical, meaning a wide Web page wraps down and a scroll bar 
shows up. Slide the page to see the rest of the contents.
 
✓ Zoom In: Use this function to make the page more legible. Zooming in 
makes the Web page not fit the screen, so expect vertical and horizontal 
scroll bars. Slide the page to pan through the contents. You can zoom in 
multiple times making the text and images much bigger. After you zoom 
in, a Zoom Out menu option is available in the menu.
 
✓ Find: Locates and highlights text on the current page. Like any other 
basic Find tool, when you choose this option, you type the text you want 
to find. After the initial search, a Find Next menu appears.
 
✓ Select: Allows you to highlight a text in the screen for copying.
 
✓ Copy: This menu item appears only if you’ve highlighted text. The high-
lighted text is copied into memory so you can paste it somewhere else, 
such as in your MemoPad.
 
✓ Full Image: This menu item appears only if you highlight an image and 
only a portion of the image is displayed on the screen.

143
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
✓ Save Image: Appears when you highlight an image and allows you to 
save the image in the built-in memory or SD card.
 
✓ Home: The shortcut to your home page. The default home page can vary 
from carrier to carrier, but to change it:
 
1. Bring up the Browser menu.
 
2. Touch-press Options➪Browser Configuration.
 
3. Change the Home Page Address field.
 
✓ Go To: Allows you to open a Web page by entering the address and 
touch-pressing the enter key. As you enter more addresses, the ones 
you entered before are listed in the History portion of the screen and 
stored so you don’t have to type them again. To find out how to clear 
that list, see the “Cache operations” section.
 
✓ Back <Esc>: Goes back to the previous page. This menu item only dis-
plays if you navigated to more than one Web page.
 
 When you see <Esc>, you can achieve the same function by pressing 
the escape key.
 
✓ Recent Pages: Browser can track up to 20 pages of Web addresses 
you’ve visited, which you can view on the History screen. From there, 
you can jump to any of those Web pages by highlighting the history page 
and pressing enter twice.
 
✓ History: Displays a list of the Web pages you visited and allows you to 
jump back quickly to those pages; it’s grouped by date.
 
✓ Refresh: Updates the current page, which is helpful when you’re on a 
page that changes frequently (such as stock quotes or sports scores).
 
✓ Set Encoding: Specifies the encoding in a Web page, which is useful 
when viewing languages that use something other than English-language 
characters. Most users don’t have to deal with this and might not know 
what type of encoding a particular language could display.
As a Web page is opening, indicators appear at the bottom of the screen that 
tell you the progress of your request. The left screen in Figure 9-7 shows 
Browser requesting a page. The right screen in Figure 9-7 shows you’ve 
reached the page and that the page is still loading.
 
Several icons are in the upper-right corner of both screens in Figure 9-7. We 
explain them, from right to left:
 
✓ The rightmost arrow icons appear when Browser is processing or 
receiving data.
 
✓ The bars to the left of the rightmost arrows show the strength of the 
network signals (the same signal indicator for phone and e-mail).

144
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
✓ Your connection type also appears; in Figure 9-7, ev means the connection 
is EvDO. (Chapter 1 gives you the scoop on connection types.)
 
✓ The lock icon indicates whether you’re at a secure Web page. In this case, 
it’s showing a non-secure page. Whether a page is secure depends on the 
Web site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing your bank, you most likely 
see the secured icon (a closed lock). On the other hand, most pages don’t 
need to be secure, so you see the unsecured icon (an open lock).
 
The Web address of a secure page starts with https rather than http.
 
Figure 9-7:

a page (left) 
and then 
loading 
(right) it.
 
 
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse somewhere 
else, press escape to stop the page from loading.
Saving or sending a Web address
Typing a whole Web address can get tedious. Fortunately, you can return to a 
page without typing the same address. While you’re viewing a Web page, simply 
use the Browser menu (as shown in Figure 9-8) to save that page’s address.
You can save a Web page address in a few ways:
 
✓ Page Address: This option allows you to view the current page’s address 
through a pop-up screen, which gives you two buttons to act on:
 
• Copy Address saves the page’s address on your BlackBerry 
Clipboard and allows you to paste it somewhere else.

145
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
• Send Address presents another screen so you can choose whether 
to send the address by e-mail, MMS, PIN, or SMS.
 
✓ Send Address: An alternate way instead of going through Page Address.
 
✓ Save Page: Use this option to save the address of the current page to 
Messages. A new message with the Browser globe icon to indicate that 
it’s a Web link is added to Messages, as shown in Figure 9-9. Touch-
pressing that link launches Browser and opens the page for your viewing 
pleasure.
 
 Saving a page to your message list has a different purpose than book-
marking a page. When you save a page to your message list, you can 
mark the page as unread, like an e-mail message, to remind yourself to 
check back later.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Use the 
Browser 
menu to 
save a 
Web page 
address.
 
Changing your Home screen background
This trick is neat: Use an image that you’ve 
saved on your pictures list as the background 
(also known as wallpaper) on your Home 
screen. Here’s how:
 1. From the Home screen, touch-press the 
Media icon and touch-press Pictures.
 
 The Pictures application opens.
 2. Navigate to the location of the image you 
want as your background.
 3. Touch-press the image.
 4. Press the menu key and touch-press Set as 
Home Screen Image.

Figure 9-9:

page link in 
Messages.
 
 
When you don’t have network coverage and try to access a Web page, you’re 
prompted to save your request. When you do, your request is automatically 
saved in the message list. When you do have coverage later, you can open the 
same Web page from the message list, with the content loaded already!
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize your favorite sites’ addresses. BlackBerry 
Browser allows you to keep a list of sites you want to revisit. In other words, 
make a bookmark so you can come back.
Adding a bookmark
Add a new bookmark this way:
 
 
1. Open Browser and go to the Web page you want to bookmark.
 
 
2. Touch-press Add Bookmark from the Browser menu.

147
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
 The menu is always accessible by pressing the menu key.
 
3. Type the bookmark name.
 
4. In the Bookmark dialog box, touch-press and navigate to the folder 
where you want to save the bookmark.
 
 The dialog box is shown in Figure 9-10. The default folder is BlackBerry 
Bookmarks, but you can save the bookmark in folders that you create. 
To see how to create a bookmark folder, skip to the section, “Adding a 
subfolder.”
 
5. Touch-press Add.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Specify the 
name and 
the folder 
in which to 
store the 
bookmark.
 
The next time you want to go to a bookmarked page, do this:
 
1. In Browser, touch-press Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
 
 You’re taken to the Bookmarks screen. From here, you can find all the 
pages you bookmarked.
 
2. Touch-press the bookmark for the page you want to visit.

148
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Changing a bookmark
Changing a bookmark is a snap:
 
1. Touch-press Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
 
 The Bookmarks screen opens.
 
2. Highlight the name of the bookmark you want to modify.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press Edit Bookmark.
 
 A screen opens.
 
4. Type a new name, a new address, or both.
 
5. Touch-press Accept to save your changes.
Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, your bookmarks will grow. A tiny screen can make it tough to 
find a certain site. You can organize your bookmarks by using folders and 
help work around this problem. For example, you can group related sites in 
a folder, and each folder can have one or more folders inside it (subfolders). 
Having subfolders narrows your search and allows you to easily find a site. 
For example, your sites might fall into these categories:
Reference
 
NY Times
 
Yahoo!
Available offline
The Add Bookmark dialog box includes an 
Available Offline check box, which you might be 
wondering about. If that check box is selected, 
you not only save a page as a bookmark, you’re 
also caching it so you can see it even when 
you’re out of range (like when you’re stuck 
deep in a mountain cave). Next time you click 
the bookmark, that page comes up very fast.
We recommend making bookmarks to search 
engines (such as Google) available offline 
because the initial search page isn’t likely to 
change from day to day.

Adding a subfolder
Unfortunately, you can only add subfolders to folders that are already listed 
on the Bookmark page. Meaning, you can’t create your own root folder. 
Your choices for adding your first subfolder are under WAP Bookmarks or 
BlackBerry Bookmarks.
Suppose you want to add a Reference subfolder within your BlackBerry 
Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and easy steps:
 
1. On the Bookmarks screen, touch-press BlackBerry Bookmarks.
 
 This is the parent of the new subfolder. In this case, the BlackBerry 
Bookmarks folder will contain the Reference subfolder.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Add Subfolder, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
 A dialog box opens.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Add a folder 
here.
 

150
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
4. Type the name of the folder and then touch-press OK.
 
 Reference folder now appears on the Bookmarks screen (as shown in 
Figure 9-12) with a folder icon.

folder you 
just added.
 
Renaming a bookmark folder
Renaming a bookmark folder you’ve created is as easy as editing a bookmark:
 
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
 
2. Highlight the name of the folder you want to change.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
4. Touch-press Rename Folder.
 
5. Type the name of the folder.
 
6. Touch-press OK to save your changes.
Moving your bookmarks
If you get lost looking for a bookmark, move that bookmark where it belongs:
 
1. Highlight the bookmark you want to move.
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Move Bookmark.
 
3. Move the bookmark where you want it.
 
 Use the arrow buttons in the bottom navigation bar.

151
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
4. After you find the right location, touch-press the arrows next to the 
bookmark.
 
 Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
You may decide you really like a site but then eventually stop visiting it. Or 
maybe a site disappeared, and every time you click the bookmark you get 404 
Not Found. Cleaning up your bookmarks list can help you save time:
 
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
 
2. Highlight the name of the bookmark you want to delete.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
4. Touch-press Delete Bookmark.
 
You can clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting an entire folder. However, 
if you delete a folder, you delete everything in that folder. Purge with caution.
Exercising Options and 
Optimizing Techniques
Browser works out of the box. But everyone has their own taste, right? You 
can look to Browser Options for Browser attributes and features you can 
customize:
 
1. Press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Options.
 
 The Browser Options screen offers three main categories to choose 
from, as shown in Figure 9-13:
 
• Browser Configuration: A place to toggle Browser features.
 
• General Properties: Settings for general look and feel of the 
Browser.
 
• Cache Operations: Gives you ability to clear file caches used by the 
Browser.
If you feel speed-greedy after adjusting the options, see the upcoming sidebar, 
“Speeding up browsing.”

Configuring Browser
You can define settings from the Browser Configuration screen, which you 
access from the Browser Options screen. The list of items you can change (as 
shown in Figure 9-14) are as follows:
 
✓ Support JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used heavily to 
make dynamic Web pages. A Web page might not behave normally when 
this option is off.
 
✓ Allow JavaScript Popups: Most ad pages are launched as JavaScript 
pop-ups. So, having this checked minimizes these ads. But be aware that 
some important pages are also displayed as JavaScript pop-ups.
 
✓ Terminate Slow Running Scripts: Sometimes there are Web pages with 
scripts that aren’t written well. Keep this selected to keep your Browser 
from hanging.
 
✓ Use Background Images: A Web page background image can make the 
Web page look pleasing but if the image is big, it could take time to 
download it.
 
✓ Support Embedded Media: Embedded Media supported at this point is 
scalable vector graphics (SVG). Think of it as Flash (which animates your 
Web pages) for mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry. SVG can be a 
still image or an animated one.

153
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Figure 9-14: 
The 
Browser

ation 
screen.
 
 
✓ Show Images: Control the display of images depending on the content 
mode of WML, HTML or both. Think of WML pages as Web pages made 
just for mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry. We recommend leaving 
this for both.
 
 Turn on and off the display of image placeholders if you opt to not dis-
play images.
 
✓ Browser Identification: Specify which browser type your browser emu-
lates. The default is BlackBerry, but Browser can also emulate these 
instead:
 
• Microsoft Internet Explorer
 
• Firefox
 
 We don’t see much difference in their behavior, so we recommend 
emulating the default BlackBerry mode.
 
✓ Start Page: Allows you to specify a starting page to load when you open 
Browser.
 
✓ Home Page Address: Allows you to set your home page. Note that home 
page is always available from the Browser menu.

154

General Browser properties
The General Properties screen does the same thing as the Configuration 
screen: It lets you customize some Browser behaviors. This screen, however, 
is geared more toward the features of the Browser content. As shown in 
Figure 9-15, you can do this:
 
✓ Configure features.
 
✓ Turn on features.
 
✓ Turn off features.
 
Figure 9-15: 
The General 
Properties 
screen.
 
From this screen, press the Space key to make a change. You can configure 
the following features by selecting from the choices:
 
✓ Default Browser: If you have multiple browsers available, use this to 
specify which one you want to use when opening a Web link.
 
✓ Default Font Family: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font, 
Browser will use the one you selected here.
 
✓ Default Font Size: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font size, 
Browser will use the one you selected here. The smaller the size, the 
more text fits on the screen.
 
✓ Minimum Font Size: A Web page may specify a font size too small to be 
legible. Specifying a legible font size will override the Web page.

155
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
✓ Minimum Font Style: When Browser is using the minimum font size, you 
can choose what font to use. Some fonts are more legible even in small 
size than others. If you’re not sure which one to use, leave the default 
untouched.
 
✓ Default View: You can toggle the default view:
 
• Column wraps all Web page elements vertically, so you just scroll 
up and down by panning the page.
 
• Desktop displays the page like you normally see in your PC’s 
Internet browser. Pan the page to scroll left, right, up, and down.
 
✓ Image Quality: The higher the quality, the slower the page loads. The 
default quality is medium. You have three options: low, medium, or high.
 
✓ Repeat Animations: Set the number of times an animation repeats. The 
default is 100, but you can change this setting:
 
• Never
 
• Once
 
• 10 Times
 
• 100 Times
 
• As Many as the Image Specifies
 
✓ Full Screen View: Makes the page displayed in compressed format so 
that you can see the whole page.
 
✓ Enable JavaScript Location Support: Web pages that have scripts that 
take advantage of your BlackBerry’s location through GPS will work if 
you have this selected.
 
✓ Prompting Before: You can have BlackBerry Browser give you a second 
chance before you do the following things:
 
• Closing Browser on Escape: You’re notified right before you exit 
BlackBerry Browser.
 
• Closing Modified Pages: You’re notified right before you exit a 
modified Web page (for example, some type of online form you fill 
out).
 
• Running WML Scripts: WML is a script to tell a wireless device how 
to display a page. It was popular years back when resolutions of 
device screens were low, but very few Web sites are using it now. 
We recommend leaving this field deselected, as this type of 
scripting is old and benign.

Cache operations
 
At any given time, your Blackberry uses a few cache mechanisms. A cache 
(pronounced cash) temporarily stores information used by Browser so the 
next time the info is needed, Browser doesn’t have to go back to the source 
Web site. The cache can speed up displays when you want to see the Web 
page again and is useful when you’re suddenly out of network coverage. When 
you visit a site that uses cookies (think of a cookie as a piece of text that a Web 
site created and placed in your BlackBerry’s memory to remember something 
about you), Browser caches that cookie.
 
Browser also caches pages and content so you can see them while you’re 
offline (not connected to the Internet). Viewing pages offline is handy when 
you’re out of range.
 
Some Web sites push (send information) Web pages to BlackBerry 
SmartPhones. An icon appears on the Home screen allowing you to quickly 
view the page. After the Web page is delivered in your BlackBerry, it becomes 
available even if you go out of coverage. If you subscribed to this service, your 
device stores Web pages in the cache. Also, the addresses of the pages that 
you visited (or the 20 in your history list) comprise a cache.
The Cache Operations screen, shown in Figure 9-16, allows you to manually 
clean your cache. You can find Cash Operations by following these steps:
 
1. From the Browser screen, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Options.
 
3. Touch-press Cache Operation.
 
Figure 9-16: 
The Cache 
Operations 
screen.
 

157
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
The Cache Operations screen shows the size of each type of cache. You also 
see the Clear button if the cache has content. Touch-press Clear to delete the 
specified cache type. Touch-press Clear History to erase the history list of 
the Web sites you visited.
Cache comes in four types:
 
✓ Content Cache: Any offline content. You might want to clear this when-
ever you’re running out of space on your BlackBerry. Or maybe you’re 
tired of viewing old content or sick of pressing the Refresh option.
 
✓ Pushed Content: Any content that was pushed to your Blackberry 
from Push Services subscriptions. You might want to clear this to free 
memory on your Blackberry.
 
✓ Cookie Cache: Any cookies stored on your BlackBerry. Nowadays, 
almost all Web sites use cookies, and the information inside it can be 
used to gather information about you and your Web-browsing habits. 
You might want to clear out this for security’s sake. Sometimes you 
don’t want a Web site to remember you.
Speeding up browsing
Many things can affect how quickly Web pages 
appear on a wireless device. If browsing the 
Web is extremely slow, you can make your 
pages load faster in exchange for not using a 
few features:
 ✓ Don’t display images. You can see a big 
performance improvement by turning off 
images. From the Browser menu, touch-
press Options➪Browser Configuration, and 
change the value to No on Show Images.
 ✓ Make sure your BlackBerry isn’t low on 
or out of memory. When your BlackBerry’s 
memory is very low, its performance 
degrades. The BlackBerry low-memory 
manager calls each application every 
now and then, telling each one to free up 
resources.
 
 Hint: Don’t leave many e-mail messages 
unread. When the low-memory manager 
kicks in, your BlackBerry Storm will try to 
delete old e-mails and SMS messages, but 
it can’t delete unread ones.
 ✓ Turn off other features. If you’re mostly 
interested in content, consider turning off 
features, such as Use Background Images, 
Support JavaScript, and Allow JavaScript 
Popups. To turn off other browser features, 
navigate to Browser Options➪General 
Properties.
 
 Warning: Don’t turn off features while per-
forming an important task, such as online 
banking. If you do, you might not be able to 
perform some of the actions on the page. 
For example, the Submit button might not 
work.

158
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
✓ History: Sites you’ve visited by using the Go To function. You might 
want to clear this for the sake of security if you don’t want other people 
knowing which Web sites you’re visiting on your BlackBerry.
Installing and Uninstalling Applications 
from the Web
You can download and install applications on your BlackBerry by using 
Browser. That is, if the application has a link that lets you download and 
install the files. The downloading and installing parts are easy:
 
1. Click the link from Browser.
 
 It displays a simple prompt that looks like the screen shown in 
Figure 9-17.
 
2. Click the Download button.
 
 The download starts.
 
Figure 9-17: 
A typical 
page let-
ting you 
download 
an applica-
tion on your 
BlackBerry 
Storm.
 
As long as you stay within network coverage during the download, your 
BlackBerry can finish the download and install the application for you. If it 
finishes without any problems, you see a screen similar to Figure 9-18.

159
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Figure 9-18: 
The down-
load and 
installation 
was com-
pleted.
 
As with a desktop computer, the download might or might not work.
 
Sometimes the application requires that you install libraries, and sometimes 
the application works only on a certain version of the BlackBerry OS. These 
issues can be prevented, depending on the site where the link is. With most 
reputable sources, these issues are considered — and successful downloading 
and installation are a snap.
 
Installing applications from nonreputable sources can make your BlackBerry 
unstable. Before you download an application from the Web, read reviews 
about that particular application. Most of the time, other people who tried 
the software provide reviews or feedback. Don’t be the first to write the bad 
review!
You BES administrator can disable the feature in your BlackBerry to down-
load and install an application. This is mostly the case for a company-issued 
device. If you have problems downloading and installing an application, 
check your company policy or contact the BlackBerry support person in your 
company.
If you download an application that turns out to be a dud, you need to unin-
stall it. See Chapter 17 for more on uninstalling an application from your 
BlackBerry.

Browser Behavior in Business
Getting a BlackBerry from your employer has two sides:
 
✓ On the good side, your company foots the bill.
 
✓ On the bad side, your company foots the bill.
Because your company pays, the company dictates what you can and can’t 
do with your BlackBerry device. This is especially true with respect to brows-
ing the Web.
Two scenarios come into play when it comes to your browser:
 
✓ Your browser might be running under your company’s BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server (BES). With this setup, your BlackBerry Browser is con-
necting to the Internet by using your company’s Internet connection. It’s 
like using your desktop machine at work.
 
✓ Your browser is connected through a network service provider. Most of 
the time, this kind of browser is called by the company’s name.
In most cases, your device fits in one scenario, which is the case where 
your browser is connected through your company’s BES server. Some lucky 
folks might have both. Whatever scenario you’re in, the following sections 
describe the major differences between the two.
Using Browser on your company’s BES
When your BlackBerry Storm comes from your company, Browser is con-
nected through your company’s BES server. With this setup, the browser is 
actually named BlackBerry Browser. BES is in your company’s local network 
referred to as intranet, as opposed to being visible publicly like the Internet. 
This setup allows the company to better manage the privileges and the func-
tions you can use on your device.
For the BlackBerry Browser, this setup lets the company use the existing 
Internet, including the company’s firewall (which helps with online safety). 
Because you’re within the company’s network, the boundaries set up on your 
account apply to your BlackBerry as well. For example, when browsing the 
Web, your BlackBerry won’t display any Web sites that are blocked by your 
company’s server.

161
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
The good thing, though, is that you can browse by using the company’s 
intranet. Meaning, all the Web pages you have access to inside your company 
through your company’s PC are also available in your BlackBerry.
 
Know your company’s Web-browsing policy. Most companies log the sites you 
view and might even have software to monitor usage. Also, your company 
might not allow downloading from the Web.
Using your network provider’s browser
Any new device coming from a network service provider can come with 
its own branded Web browser. The network browser is the same as the 
BlackBerry Browser, but the behavior might differ:
 
✓ The name is different.
 
✓ The default home page usually points to the provider’s Web site. This 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Most of the time, the network provider’s 
Web site is full of links that you might not find on BlackBerry Browser.
 
✓ You can browse more sites. You’re not limited by your company’s 
policy.
 
Most of the time, surfing the Web is much faster if your browser is through 
BES. This isn’t true all the time, however, because the network bandwidth or 
data pipe used by your BES affects how much data can travel on those pipes, 
the size of those pipes, and the speed that Browser loads the page.
Setting the default browser
If you have two Web browsers on your device, you can set the default 
browser. This comes into play when you view a Web address by using a link 
outside Browser application. For example, when you view an e-mail with a 
Web link, touch-pressing that link will launch the default browser.
To set up the default browser, do this:
 
1. Go to the Home screen.
 
2. Touch-press Settings➪Options➪Advanced Options➪Browser.
 
3. Touch-press the selections in the Default browser configuration.
 
 Figure 9-19 shows the Browser Settings screen with the default browser 
selected.

Chapter 10
Calling Your Favorite Person
In This Chapter
▶ Using the Phone application
▶ Making and receiving calls
▶ Customizing your BlackBerry phone
▶ Conferencing with more than one person
▶ Talking hands free on your BlackBerry phone
▶ Multitasking with your BlackBerry phone
T
he BlackBerry phone operates no differently than any other phone 
you’ve used. Why bother with this chapter? Your BlackBerry phone can 
do things your run-of-the-mill cellphone can’t. For example, when was the last 
time your phone was connected to your to-do list? Have you ever received an 
e-mail and placed a call directly from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with 
your BlackBerry, you can do all these things and more.
Using the BlackBerry Phone Application
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the essential 
Phone features, including making and receiving calls.
Making a call
To make a call, follow these steps:
 
1. Press the green send key.
 
2. Touch-press the phone number of the person you want to call.
 
3. Press the green send key again to call.

164
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Calling from Contacts
Because you can’t possibly remember all your friends’ and colleagues’ 
phone numbers, calling from Contacts is convenient and useful. To call from 
Contacts, follow these steps:
 
1. Press the green send key.
 
 The Phone application opens.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
 The Phone menu appears.
 
3. Touch-press Call from Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens. From here, you can search as usual for the contact 
you’d like to call.
 
4. From Contacts, touch-press your call recipient.
 
5. Press the green send key.
 
 This makes the call.
Using a calling card or dialing an extension
Have you ever dialed a long-distance number using a calling card? First you 
call the calling-card access number, then you enter the code, then you dial 
the long-distance number. Major pain in the behind. Although not as bad, 
dialing someone’s extension isn’t fun either.
 
In Contacts, under the Contact Phone Number field, you add x with the exten-
sion number. The next time you call that contact, a screen asks if you want the 
extension dialed for you; see Figure 10-1. You can do the same with a calling-
card access number, but add the access number and x in front of the phone 
number.
For example, if you’re in the U.S. and using a calling card for a UK number, 
the phone number field in Contacts would look like this: 800-555-1314x011-
44-775-555-1212. The phone number is 011-44-775-555-1212; the calling card 
access number is 800-555-1314.
Getting a call
Receiving a call on your BlackBerry is even easier than making a call. You can 
receive calls in a couple of ways:

165
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
✓ Use your automated answering feature. Automated answering is trig-
gered whenever you take your BlackBerry out of your holster; in other 
words, just taking out the BlackBerry forces it to automatically pick up 
any call, so you can start talking right away. The disadvantage of this is 
that you don’t have time to see who is calling you (on your Caller ID).
 
✓ Answer manually. When you get a call, your screen will look something 
like Figure 10-2. Just touch-press Answer to pick up the phone.
 
Figure 10-1:

ing card to 
call interna-
tional with 
ease.
 
 
Figure 10-2: 
There’s an 
incoming 
call for you!
 

166
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
To disable auto answering, make sure Auto Answer Call option is set to Never. 
You can get to Auto Answer Call option by pressing the menu key from the 
Phone application and then touch-press Option from the Phone menu.
What’s the advantage of disabling auto answering? Manual answering allows 
you to answer or ignore when you receive a call, as shown in Figure 10-3. This 
way, you can see on your Caller ID who’s calling; you can pick up or ignore.
 
Figure 10-3:

BlackBerry 
Storm 
screen 
looks like 
while on a 
call.
 
Muting your call
Muting lets you hear but not be heard. This option is useful when you’re on 
a conference call. (See the upcoming section, “Arranging Conference Calls.”) 
Maybe you’re on the bus or have kids in the background.
To mute or unmute your call, toggle the Mute icon.
Putting someone on hold
If you put someone on hold, neither you nor your caller can hear each 
another. To put a conversation on hold
 
1. While in a conversation, press the menu key.
 
 The Phone menu appears yet again.

167
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
2. Touch-press Hold.
 
 Your call is now on hold.
To un-hold your call
 
1. While a call is on hold, press the menu key.
 
 A new menu appears.
 
2. Touch-press Resume.
 
 You can continue your conversation again.
Turning down the volume
You can adjust the call volume, a simple yet important action on your 
BlackBerry phone, by pressing the volume up or down key on the side of 
your BlackBerry Storm during a call.
Customizing Your Phone
For your BlackBerry phone to work the way you like, you have to first set it 
up the way you want it. This section offers some settings that can make you 
the master of your BlackBerry phone.
Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access number. 
Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice mailbox vary, 
depending on your service provider. But usually you can access the voice 
mail by pressing the menu key in the Phone application and touch-pressing 
the Call Voice Mail option.
 
Most service providers are more than happy to walk you through the steps to 
get your mailbox set up in a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail access number:
 
1. Press the green send key.
 
 The Phone application opens.

168
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Select the options item.
 
 A list of phone options appears.
 
4. Select Voice Mail.
 
 This opens the Voice Mail Configuration screen.
 
5. In the Access the Number field, type your voice mail access number.
 
 If this field is empty and you don’t know this number, contact your ser-
vice provider and ask for your voice mail access number. Typically, it’s 
your mobile number.
 
6. Press the menu key.
 
7. Select Save.
Using call forwarding
The BlackBerry has two types of call forwarding:
 
✓ Forward All Calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry are forwarded to the 
number you designate. Another name for this feature is unconditional 
forwarding.
 
✓ Forward Unanswered Calls: Calls that meet different types of conditions 
are forwarded to different numbers as follows:
 
• If Busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on the 
phone.
 
• If No Answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or can’t pick up your 
phone. (Perhaps you’re in a meeting.)
 
• If Unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and can’t get a 
signal.
Out of the box, your BlackBerry forwards any unanswered calls, regardless of 
conditions, to your voice mail number by default. However, you can add new 
numbers to forward a call to.
You need to be within network coverage before you can change your call for-
warding option. After you’re within network coverage, you can change your 
call forwarding settings by doing the following:
 
1. Press the green send key.
 
 The Phone application opens.

169
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Options menu item.
 
 A list of phone options appears.
 
4. Touch-press Call Forwarding.
 
 Your BlackBerry attempts to connect to the server. If successful, you see 
the Call Forwarding screen.
 
 If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you have network 
coverage and try again.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Edit Numbers.
 
 A list of numbers appears. If this is the first time you’re setting call for-
warding, mostly likely your voice mail number is the only one on the list.
 
6. To add a new forwarding number, press the menu key and touch-press 
New Number.
 
 A pop-up menu prompts you to type the number.
 
7. Type the number.
 
 The new number you entered now appears on the call forward list. You 
can add this new number to any call forwarding types or conditions.
 
8. Press the escape key.
 
 You return to the Call Forwarding screen.
 
9. Touch-press If Unreachable field.
 
 A drop-down menu lists numbers from the call forward list, including the 
one you just added.
 
10. Touch-press the number you want to forward to and then touch-press 
to confirm.
 
 The selected number appears in the If Unreachable field. You can see 
this on the Call Forwarding screen.
 
11. Press the menu key and touch-press Save.
 
 Your changes are confirmed.
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two (or more) people on the phone with you — the infamous confer-
ence call — do the following:

170
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
1. Use the Phone application to call the first person.
 
2. While the first participant is on the phone with you, touch-press the 
Conference button on screen, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
 This automatically places the first call on hold and brings up a New Call 
screen.
 
3. Type the phone number for the second person.
 
 You can dial the number a number of ways:
 
• Using the onscreen number pad.
 
• Selecting a frequently dialed number from your call log.
 
 To place a call from your Contacts, press the menu key from the New 
Call screen and select Call from Contact. Your BlackBerry prompts you 
to select a contact.
 
4. Press the green send key.
 
 The call to the second meeting participant is just like any other phone 
call (except the first participant is still on hold on the other line).
 
5. While the second person is on the phone with you, press the menu 
key and touch-press Join Conference, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
 This connects the first and second participants. Now you can discuss 
with both participants at the same time.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Join two 
people in a 
conference 
call.
 

171
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
Having two people on the phone with you is also known as three-way calling. 
If you want to chat with four people — or even ten people — at the same 
time, you certainly can. Simply repeat Steps 2–5 until all the participants are 
on the phone.
Talking privately to a conference 
participant
During a conference call, you might want to talk to one person privately. This 
is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. While on a conference call, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Split Call.
 
 A pop-up screen lists all the conference call participants
 
3. Touch-press the person you want to speak with privately.
 
 This puts all other participants on hold and connects you to the par-
ticipant you selected. On the display screen, you can see who you’re 
connected to; this confirms that you chose the right person to chat with 
privately.
 
4. To talk to all participants again, press the menu key and touch-press 
Join Conference.
Alternating between phone conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call or you’re 
talking to someone while you have someone else on hold, you can switch 
between the two conversations by swapping them. Follow these steps:
 
1. While talking to someone, press the menu key and touch-press Hold.
 
 That person is put on hold.
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Swap.
 
 You switch from the person with whom you’re currently talking to the 
person who was on hold.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 to go back to the original conversation.

172
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Dropping that meeting hugger
If you’ve been on conference calls, you know those chatty “meeting huggers” 
who have to say something about everything. Don’t you wish you could drop 
them from the call? With your BlackBerry, you can (as long as you initiated 
the call):
 
1. While on a conference call, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Drop Call.
 
 A pop-up screen lists all conference-call participants.
 
3. Touch-press the person you want to drop.
 
 That person is disconnected.
 
4. Continue the conversation with the other people.
Communicating Hands Free
More and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones without a hands-
free headset. Luckily for you, BlackBerry offers hands-free options.
Using the speaker phone
The Speaker Phone function is useful under certain situations, such as when 
you’re in a room full of people who want to join in the conversation. Or you 
might be all by your lonesome in your office but are stuck rooting through 
your files — hard to do with a BlackBerry scrunched up against your ear. 
(We call such moments multitasking — a concept so important we devote an 
entire upcoming section to it.)
 
To switch to the speaker phone while you’re on a phone call, press the 
Speaker button on screen; see Figure 10-3.
Pairing your BlackBerry with 
a Bluetooth headset
Your Storm comes with a wired hands-free headset, so you can start using 
yours by plugging it into the headset jack on the left side of the Storm. You 
adjust the headset’s volume by pressing up or down on the volume keys.

173
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
Using the wired hands-free headset can help, but the wired headset can get in 
the way if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry. The whole Bluetooth wire-
less thing comes in here. You can buy a Bluetooth headset to go with your 
Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry.
After you purchase a Bluetooth headset, you can pair it with your BlackBerry 
Storm. Think of pairing a Bluetooth headset with your Storm as registering 
the headset with your Storm so that it recognizes the headset.
 
First things first: You need to prep your headset for pairing. Now, each head-
set manufacturer has a different take on this, so consult your headset docu-
mentation for details.
With that out of the way, continue with the pairing as follows:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press the Wireless Connections.
 
 A pop-up screen appears.
 
3. Touch-press the Enable check box next to Bluetooth and then touch-
press Set Up Bluetooth.
 
 If this is the first time you’re using Bluetooth, you’re asked to set a name 
for your device so others can see your Storm when trying to connect to 
you via Bluetooth.
 
 If this isn’t the first time, you will see a Add Device pop-up screen with 
the following buttons:
 
• Search: If you want to reach out to other device
 
• Listen: If you want other device to find you.
 
• Cancel: If you want to cancel this operation.
 
4. Touch-press Search.
 
 You see the Searching for Devices progress bar, um, progressing. When 
your BlackBerry discovers the headset, a Select Device dialog box 
appears with the name of the headset.
 
5. Touch-press the Bluetooth headset.
 
 A dialog box prompts you for a passkey code to the headset.
 
6. Type the passkey and touch-press Okay.
 
 Normally the Bluetooth passkey is 0000 but refer to your headset docu-
mentation.
 
 After you successfully enter the passkey, your headset is listed in the 
Bluetooth setting.

174
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
7. Press the menu key.
 
 The Bluetooth menu appears.
 
8. Touch-press Connect.
 
 Your BlackBerry attempts to connect to the Bluetooth headset.
Using your voice to dial
With your headset and the Voice Dialing application, you can truly be hands 
free. You may be wondering how to activate the Voice Dialing application 
without touching your BlackBerry. Good question. The majority of hands-free 
headsets (Bluetooth or not) come with a multipurpose button.
 
Usually, a multipurpose button on a hands-free headset can mute, end, and 
initiate a call. Refer to your hands-free headset manual for more info.
 
1. Activate your headset.
 
2. Press its multipurpose button.
 
 The Voice Dialing application is activated and a voice states, “Say a 
command.”
 
3. Say “Call name of person or number.”
 
The Voice Dialing application is good at recognizing the name of the person 
and the numbers you dictate. However, we strongly suggest that you try the 
voice dialing feature before you need it.
Taking Notes While on the Phone
You’re not stuck just talking to someone on the phone. When you’re on your 
BlackBerry, you can use it for other tasks at the same time. Why not
 
✓ Take meeting notes while you’re in a conference call? 
 
✓ Look up a phone number in the BlackBerry Contacts that your caller is 
asking you for?
 
✓ Make a to-do list while you’re planning the party?
 
✓ Compose an e-mail thanking the caller for his time?
It makes sense to multitask while you’re using a hands-free headset or a 
speaker phone. Otherwise, your face would be stuck to your BlackBerry.

175
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
After you don your hands-free headset or turn on a speaker phone, you can 
start multitasking:
 
1. While in a conversation, from the Phone application, press the icon 
that looks like a house.
 
 This gets you to the Home screen.
 
2. Start multitasking.
 
 While on the phone and multitasking, you can access the Phone menu 
from other applications. For example, you can end a call or put a call on 
hold from your to-do list.
Do this to take notes of your call:
 
1. During a phone conversation, press the menu key.
 
 Or you can press the notepad icon in Figure 10-3; if you do, then go to 
Step 3.
 
2. Touch-press Notes.
 
 The Notes screen appears.
 
3. Type notes for the conversation, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 When the call ends, the notes are automatically saved for you.
 
Figure 10-5:

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Accessing phone notes
From the Call History list, you can access notes you’ve made during a call. In 
addition, you can also edit and add new notes.
 
1. Press the green send key.
 
 The Phone application opens. If you have calls from before, you see a 
screen like Figure 10-6.
 
2. Touch-press a call log to highlight it.
 
3. Press the menu key and touch-press View History.
 
 The Call History screen (see Figure 10-7) opens for the highlighted call.
 
4. Press the menu key.
 
5. Choose one of the following:
 
• Add Notes: If the call has no notes.
 
• Edit Notes: If the call already has notes.

Forwarding phone notes
You can forward your phone notes just like an e-mail:
 
1. While in the Call History screen (see Figure 10-7), press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press Forward.
 
 A new e-mail opens with the body of the e-mail filled with call details and 
notes. You can forward call notes via e-mail (no SMS or PIN messages). 
You can send the e-mail as you would any other e-mail. See Chapter 8 for 
more information on e-mails.

Chapter 11
Taking Great Pictures 
with Your Storm
In This Chapter
▶ Getting ready to say “cheese”
▶ Saving and organizing your pictures
▶ Sharing your photos with other people
▶ Getting a grip on memory limits
O
h shoot, you forgot your camera. Don’t worry! Your Storm’s there when 
you need to capture the unbelievable: Grandma’s doing a handstand, 
your Grandpa is doing a cartwheel, or your roommate is doing her laundry.
Before you try taking pictures with it, read this chapter so you know what to 
expect and how to get the best shot. We also walk you through the easy steps 
in capturing that funny pose. We also tell you how to store those shots and 
share them with your buddies.
Saying “Cheese”
Before you ask someone to pose, examine your BlackBerry Storm (shown in 
Figure 11-1) first:
 
✓ Is the camera on? You see the bottom key on the right side of your 
BlackBerry Storm? Press it to bring up the Camera application. 
Alternatively, you can touch-press the Camera icon from the Home 
screen.
 
✓ Is your finger blocking the lens? The lens is on the back side of your 
device.
 
✓ Do you see the image in the screen? Pressing the camera key again 
takes the picture. You should hear a funky sound. Neat and easy, isn’t it?

180
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Itching to take more pictures? Hold those snapping fingers of yours. If you 
take a few moments first to familiarize yourself with the camera’s features, 
the effort could go a long way.

Reading the screen indicators
When you open the Camera, the first thing you see is the screen in Figure 11-2. 
The top portion of this screen shows the image you’re about to capture. The 
bottom part contains icons (starting from the left) that indicate the following:
 
✓ Number of pictures you can capture
 
✓ Focus
 
✓ Flash
Choosing the picture quality
BlackBerry Storm can capture up to 3.2 megapixels (mp) of resolution. Saving 
at this resolution requires a big space. You can save at a lower quality and 
save some space on your BlackBerry:

181
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures with Your Storm
 
✓ Normal
 
✓ Fine
 
✓ SuperFine
 
Figure 11-2: 
The Camera 
screen 
ready 
to take 
pictures.
 
 
The default camera setting is Normal, which is the lowest quality but lets you 
save the most pictures. The trade-off is that a Normal picture won’t be as 
smooth or fine. Choose a setting based on how you plan to use the picture. 
If you’re shooting a breathtaking landscape and want to capture every pos-
sible detail for printing later, use the SuperFine setting. If you’re just taking 
pictures of your friends’ faces so you can attach them as Caller ID, Normal is 
appropriate.
Changing picture quality is a snap:
 
1. Press the bottom key on the right side of your Storm.
 
 The Camera application opens.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Options.
 
 The Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
4. Touch-press Picture Quality.
 
5. Touch-press the picture quality you want from the available 
selections.
 
 Picture Quality values to choose from are Normal, Fine, and SuperFine. 

182
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
6. Press the menu key.
 
7. Touch-press Save.
 
 The picture quality you’ve chosen is now active.
 
Figure 11-3:

Zooming and focusing
You need to be steady to get a good focus while taking the shots. Although 
it’s convenient to use one hand while taking pictures, most of the time you’ll 
get a blurry image if you try that.
 
When taking pictures, hold your BlackBerry with both hands, one holding the 
device steady and the other clicking the button.
Holding the camera with both hands is even more important if you’re zoom-
ing in. Yes, your camera is capable of up to 2x digital zoom. Here’s what you 
need to do for focusing and zooming:
 
✓ To focus: Press the camera key halfway.
 
✓ To zoom in: Slide finger up.
 
✓ To zoom out: Slide finger down.
While zooming, the value in the indicator changes from 1x, 2x, up to 3x and 
vice versa, depending on the direction you scroll.
Setting the flash
The rightmost indicator on the Camera screen is the flash. The default is 
Automatic, which shows an arrow with the letter A. Automatic means it goes 
off if it doesn’t detect enough light. Where it’s dark, the flash fires; otherwise, 
it doesn’t.

183
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures with Your Storm
 
You can turn the flash on or off. When set to off, the arrow image is slashed 
through, just like you see on the Don’t Walk traffic signal. You can toggle the 
settings in Camera’s Options screen. (Press the menu key and touch-press 
Options to get to the Options screen.)
Setting the white balance
In photography, filters are used to compensate for the dominant light. For 
instance, a fluorescent versus an incandescent light could affect how warm 
the picture looks. Instead of using filters, most digital cameras have a feature 
to correct or compensate for many types of light settings. This feature is 
White Balance. And yes, your Storm, of course, has one. You can choose from 
Sunny, Cloudy, Night, Incandescent, Fluorescent, or Automatic. Automatic 
means your camera sets what it thinks are the best settings to apply.
You can change the white balance through the camera’s Options screen.
 
The camera’s Options screen is accessible by pressing the menu key and 
touch-pressing Options from the menu that follows.
Setting the picture size
Aside from picture quality, you can also adjust the actual size of the photo:
 
✓ Large: 1600 x 1200
 
✓ Medium: 1024 x 768 
 
✓ Small: 640 x 480
Again, camera settings are accessible through the camera’s Options screen 
by pressing the menu key and touch-pressing Options from the menu that 
shows.
Geotagging
With your Storm having a GPS capability, your location based on longitude 
and latitude can be determined easily. This information can be added to 
your media files including the pictures taken from your camera. Adding geo-
graphic information is referred to as Geotagging. On your Storm, it adds lon-
gitude and latitude information. Now, you don’t have to wonder where you 
took that crazy pose.

184
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Geotagging by default is disabled in your Storm. You can simply enable 
it from the camera Options screen. (Press the menu key and touch-press 
Options to get to the Options screen.)
 
If you have longitude and latitude information from one of your photos, you 
can use one of the free sites on the Web to locate that information in the map. 
One such site is www.travelgis.com/geocode/Default.aspx.
Working with Pictures
You’ve taken a bunch of pictures and you want to see them. And maybe 
delete the unflattering ones. Or perhaps organize them. No problem.
Viewing pictures
If you take a picture, you want to see it, right? Viewing a picture is a common 
function with your camera. You can see the image you just captured right 
then and there, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
If you’re browsing through your picture folders, you can view a picture by 
simply touch-pressing the picture file.

Want to see your pictures in a slide show?
 
1. While in Camera screen, press the menu key and touch-press View 
Pictures from the menu that appears.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Slide Show.
 
 Voilà! Your BlackBerry Storm displays your pictures one at a time at a 
regular time interval. The default interval between each picture is two 
seconds; if you’re not happy with this interval, change it in the Options 
screen. (Press the menu key and touch-press Options to get to the 
Options screen.)
Trashing
If you don’t like the image you captured, you can delete it.
 
1. Highlight the picture you want trashed.
 
2. Touch-press the Delete (X) icon.
 
 A confirmation screen comes up.
 
3. Touch-press Delete.
 
 You can do the same thing right after taking the picture; just touch-press 
the trash can icon when viewing the photo. Refer to Figure 11-4.
Listing filenames versus thumbnails
When you open a folder packed with pictures, your BlackBerry automatically 
lists thumbnails, which are small previews of your pictures.
A preview is nice, but what if you’re looking for a picture and know the file 
name? Wouldn’t it be nice to see a list of names instead of thumbnails?
 
1. Go to a picture folder.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press View List.

186
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
 That’s exactly what you get: a list of all the pictures in the folder. What’s 
neat is that the option also displays the file size. The file size can give 
you a clue of what settings you used to take the picture. For example, a 
photo taken from a SuperFine quality produces a much bigger file size 
compared to normal.
Checking picture properties
Curious about the amount of memory your picture is using? Want to know 
the time you took the photo? 
 
1. Highlight the picture from a list.
 
 While you’re in Camera screen, you can view the list of your pictures by 
pressing the menu key and touch-pressing View Pictures.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Properties.
 
 You see a screen similar to Figure 11-5, which displays the picture’s 
location, size, and last modification.

Organizing your pictures
Organization is all about time and the best use of it. After all, you want to 
enjoy looking at your pictures — not looking for them. You want to organize 
your pictures; you can change how they’re stored and how they’re named. 
Plus, you can create folders. With those capabilities, you should be on your 
way to organization nirvana.
Renaming a picture file
BlackBerry saves a file when you capture a picture. However, the file name is 
generic, something like IMGxxxx, where the x is a number.
 
Make it a habit to rename the file as soon as you’ve finished capturing the 
picture. It is easier to recognize Dean blows birthday candles than IMG00003-
20081013-0029.
Renaming is a snap. Here’s how:
 
1. Display the picture onscreen or highlight it in the list.
 
2. Press the menu key.
 
3. Touch-press Rename.
 
 A Rename screen appears.
 
4. Type the name you want for this picture.
 
5. Touch-press Save.
 
 Your picture is renamed.
Creating a new folder
Being the organized person you are, you must be wondering about folders. 
Don’t fret; it’s simple to create one:
 
1. In the Camera screen, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press View Pictures.
 
 The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder and an Up 
icon for you to navigate to the folder above this.
 
3. Touch-press the Up icon.

188
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
4. Navigate to the main folder where you want your new folder to be 
created.
 
 You should be within the folder where you want your new folder to be 
created. If not, repeat this step to navigate to that folder.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press New Folder.
 
7. Enter the name of the folder.
 
8. Touch-press OK.
 
 Your folder is created.
Moving pictures
There are many reasons for moving pictures between folders. The most obvi-
ous reason is to organize your pictures. Want to try it? Follow these steps:
 
1. In the Camera screen, press the menu key.
 
2. Touch-press View Pictures.
 
 The screen lists pictures in the current folder. If the picture you want to 
move isn’t in this folder, touch-press the Up icon to navigate up to other 
folders.
 
3. Highlight the picture you want to move.
 
4. Press the menu key.
 
5. Touch-press Move.
 
 The screen allows you to go to the folder where you want to move this 
picture.
 
6. Touch-press the Up icon.
 
7. Navigate to the folder where you want to move this picture.
 
8. Press the menu key.
 
9. Touch-press Move Here.
 
 Your picture is moved.
 
You can easily transfer your pictures to your PC or copy pictures from PC to 
your Storm as well. See Chapter 12 for more details.
Sharing your pictures
Where’s the joy in taking great pictures if you’re the only one seeing them? 
Your BlackBerry has several options for sharing your bundle of joy:

189
 Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures with Your Storm
 
1. In the Camera screen, press the menu key and touch-press View 
Pictures.
 
2. Highlight a picture you want to share.
 
3. Press the menu key.
 
4. Select from the choices listed here:
 
• Send as Email: This goes directly to the Compose E-Mail screen, 
with the currently selected picture as an attachment.
 
• Send as MMS: Similar to Send as Email, this opens a Compose MMS 
screen with the currently selected picture as an attachment. The 
only difference is that MMS first displays Contacts, letting you 
select the person’s phone number to receive the MMS before going 
to the compose screen.
 
• Send Using Bluetooth: This allows you to send the picture to any 
device capable of communicating through Bluetooth.
Setting a picture as Caller ID
Wouldn’t it be nice if, when your girlfriend was calling, you also could see 
her beautiful face? You can do that. If you have a photo of her saved in your 
BlackBerry, follow these steps to make sure you can:
 
1. Touch-press Media icon from Home screen.
 
2. Touch-press Pictures.
 
3. Navigate to the locations of your pictures.
 
4. Touch-press to view the photo you want to appear when the person 
calls.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Set as Caller ID.
 
 If you don’t have pictures of your friends, now’s the time to start 
clicking.
 
7. Touch-press the screen.
 
 A menu appears.
 
8. Touch-press Crop and Save.
 
 Contacts appears.
 
9. Touch-press the contact you want this picture to appear.
 
 A message indicating a picture is set for that contact appears. 
You’re set.

190
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Setting a Home screen image
Suppose you have a stunning picture that you want to use as the background 
image for your BlackBerry? Follow these steps:
 
1. Touch-press Media icon from Home screen.
 
2. Touch-press Pictures.
 
3. Navigate to the locations of your pictures.
 
4. Touch-press to view the picture you want to use as your Home screen 
image.
 
5. Press the menu key.
 
6. Touch-press Set as Home Screen Image.
 
 You can always reset the Home screen image by going to the menu 
screen and selecting Reset Home Screen Image.
Setting Camera Memory Options
The camera in your BlackBerry is a piece of hardware and a computer pro-
gram. As such, the good people at RIM (Research In Motion) incorporated 
some parameters that you can set so you can enjoy your camera fully while 
not affecting other features that share the same memory.
 
You should know the following two options:
 
✓ Device Memory Limit: The amount of device memory your camera can 
use. The values are 12M, 15M, 20M, and 25M (1M is 1000K). To get a feel 
for how many pictures this is, look at the properties of an existing pic-
ture in the format you take most often and note its file size. The size of 
the picture also depends on the format you use to take it.
 
✓ Reserved Pictures Memory: The amount of memory BlackBerry 
reserves for the camera to store pictures. Possible values are 0M, 2M, 
5M, 8M, 10M, and 12M. You can’t set this value greater than the Device 
Memory Limit.

f a word describes today’s phone market trends, it’s convergence. Your 
BlackBerry Storm is one of the latest participants in this race to bring 
things together. We probably don’t have to tell you this, but in addition to 
sending and receiving e-mail and being a phone, a camera, and a PDA, your 
BlackBerry Storm is a portable media player.
In the palm of your hand, you can
 
✓ Listen to music
 
✓ Record and watch video clips
 
✓ Sample ring tones
 
✓ Snap and view pictures
These capabilities are all bundled into an application with a name you’d 
recognize even after sipping a couple pints of strong ale — Media.
Accessing Media
 To run Media, simply touch-press the Media icon from the Home screen. 
The Media icon is very easy to distinguish, as it has the image of a CD and a 
musical note.

192
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Media is a collection of media applications:
 
✓ Music
 
✓ Video
 
✓ Ring tones
 
✓ Pictures
 
✓ Voice Notes
And each one is represented with an icon upon opening Media, as shown 
in Figure 12-1. You don’t need to be Einstein to figure out what each one of 
these media applications is for. Ready to have some fun?

Let the music play
You don’t need a quarter to play music on your BlackBerry Storm. Just 
touch-press Music from the Media screen. Several potential views of your 
music collection (similar to the one shown in Figure 12-2) appear. Music is 
the screen heading. The views include the following:

193
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with the Media Player
 
✓ All Songs: Displays all your music files in alphabetical order.
 
✓ Artists: Lists your music files by artist, so you can play your John Mayer 
songs in one go.
 
✓ Albums: Lets you view your music collection one album at a time.
 
✓ Genres: If you prefer not to mingle your country with your cutting-edge 
techno, navigate through this view.
 
✓ Playlists: Organize and play songs as you prefer — the perfect mixed 
tape!
 
✓ Sample Songs: When you’re dying to check the player but haven’t yet 
put your collection into the BlackBerry Storm, go here. Your Storm 
comes with a couple of songs and you can find it here.
 
✓ Shuffle Songs: Life is all about variety and when you’re tired of the song 
order in your playlist, touch-press this.
After you choose a view, touch-press one of the songs to start playing it. 
After Storm starts playing a song, it plays the rest of the music listed in the 
view you selected. The standard interface shown in Figure 12-3 doesn’t 
require explanation. 
 
You can’t fast forward or rewind the traditional way, but you can position 
where Storm is playing by dragging the progress slider.
Figure 12-2:
Your music

194
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
BlackBerry Storm supports many music formats (with file extensions), 
including the following:
 
✓ ACC: Audio compression formats AAC, AAC+, and EAAC+ (.aac and 
.m4a)
 
✓ AMR: Adaptive Multi Rate-Narrow Band (AMR-NB) speech coder 
standard (.mmr and .3gp)
 
✓ MIDI: Polyphonic MIDI (.mid, .midi, and .smf)
 
✓ MP3: MPEG Part 1 and Part 2 audio layer 3 (.mp3 and .mp4)
 
✓ WMA: Windows Media Audio 9, Pro, and 10 (.wma and .asf)
 
The earpiece-mic combo that comes with your BlackBerry Storm is only for 
one ear. This might be an issue when you’re on the train. To improve your 
experience, you can buy a stereo (two-ear) headset. A Bluetooth headset is a 
good option.
 
Figure 12-3: 
The music 
plays here.
 
Now showing
Playing or recording a video is very similar to playing music:
 
1. Touch-press Video from the Media screen.
 
 The screen shows Video Camera and a list of video files on the bottom. 
If you want to watch a video, skip to Step 5.

195
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with the Media Player
 
2. To start video recording, touch-press Video Camera.
 
 A screen shows the image in front of the camera.
 
3. Touch-press the screen again to start recording.
 
 Don’t wait for “Cut!” You can pause it by touch-pressing the pause 
button. The familiar video/audio controls appear, from left to right 
showing:
 
• Continue recording
 
• Stop
 
• Play
 
 The functions of the other buttons are also quite obvious, including:
 
• Rename (for the file name)
 
• Delete
 
• Send via E-Mail
 
4. Press the stop button when you’re ready to wrap your home video.
 
 You wind up at the previous screen with the video clip file listed. We 
know you’re itching to watch it.
 
5. Touch-press the file to play it onscreen.
Lord of the ring tones
Ah, the proliferation of ring tones; that’s history. Nothing beats hearing a 
loud, funky ring tone while you’re sleeping on a bus or a train. You can wake 
other passengers, too, whether you want to use the Top 40, old-fashioned 
digital beats, or something you recorded yourself.
Of course you want to hear ring tones that come with your BlackBerry Storm. 
It offers a bunch, so enjoy.
 
1. Touch-press Ring Tones from the Media screen.
 
 You see three views:
 
• All Ring Tones
 
• My Ring Tones 
 
• Preloaded Ring Tones

196
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
2. Touch-press Preloaded Ring Tones.
 
 The preloaded ring tones are displayed.
 
3. Touch-press any one of them and enjoy.
 
 While playing a ring tone, touch-press the right arrow to go to the next 
tone; touch-press the left arrow to go the previous one.
 
4. Stumble on a ring tone you like.
 
5. Press the menu key and touch-press Set as Ring Tone.
 
 That ring tone is what plays when your phone rings.
 
A ring tone is similar to a music file and includes the same music formats:
 
✓ ACC
 
✓ M4A
 
✓ MIDI
 
✓ MMR
 
✓ MP3
 
✓ WMA
If you’re familiar with audio editing software, you can make your own ring 
tone. Save it as one of the formats listed above and copy it to your Storm 
(see the “Working with Media Files” section in this chapter to see how to 
copy files from your PC to your Storm). The Internet is also an amazon of ring 
tones, and many are free. The only possible harm you get from downloading 
one is being annoyed with how it sounds. The default home page on the 
Browser (mobile.blackberry.com) has links to sources of ring tones. See 
Fun and Pages on the home page.
Picture this
If you upgraded from an older BlackBerry, you may know Pictures, which lets 
you view, zoom into, and rotate pictures:
 
1. Touch-press Pictures from the Media screen.
 
 You see much like what you see in the other Media applications.
 
2. Navigate to the view you want.
 
3. Find the picture you’re looking for.

197
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with the Media Player
 
4. Touch-press the file.
 
 Easy does it, right?
 
Check out Sample Pictures. Your BlackBerry comes with nice pictures you 
can use as the Home screen background. You can assign a cartoon to a 
contact as a Caller ID until you get a chance to take the person’s picture. Or 
don’t take the picture.
Zoom to details
Is that a pimple? No, it’s not. Let’s zoom in.
While viewing an image, press the menu key and touch-press Zoom. A tiny 
nonobtrusive slider bar appears on the left side of the image. Sliding it up 
zooms in and sliding it down zooms out.
While sliding, the slider bar indicates the degree of zoom. The exact center of 
this bar is the original image (no zooming applied).
 
An image is normally defaulted to fit the screen but you can toggle it by 
pressing the menu key and touch-pressing one of these options:
 
✓ Fit to Screen
 
✓ View Actual Size
Rotate it
Want to view yourself upside down? Maybe not. But sometimes your pictures 
look better horizontal.
While you’re viewing an image in Pictures, press the menu key and touch-
press Rotate. The image rotates 90 degrees clockwise. By repeating the same 
steps, you can keep rotating it; each time is an additional 90-degree clockwise 
rotation.
Recording your voice
A feature-packed SmartPhone like your Storm should come with a voice 
recorder, and it does. Within Media, find Voice Notes, a neat recording appli-
cation. Now you can record your billion-dollar ideas without having to type 
every detail:

198
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
1. Touch-press that little microphone icon.
 
 The Voice Notes application launches, sporting the simple and clean 
screen shown in Figure 12-4. The top of the screen is a Record button, 
and the bottom part lists your previous recordings.
 
2. To record, touch-press Record.
 
3. When you’re ready, touch-press the screen again.
 
 Your BlackBerry’s microphone is designed to be close to your mouth 
like any mobile phone should.
 
 You can pause anytime you want by touch-pressing the pause button. 
A familiar video/audio control appears, from left to right:
 
• Continue recording
 
• Stop
 
• Play
 
 Other buttons include Rename for renaming the file name, Delete, and 
Send via E-Mail.
 
4. Press the stop button to wrap it up.
 
 You return to the previous screen. Your recent voice note should be 
listed.
 
5. Touch-press your voice recording when you need to type your 
brilliant idea.

Turning it up (or down)
Whether you’re listening to music, watching a video, or listening to your 
voice recording, adjusting the volume is easy.
 
Your Storm comes with dedicated volume buttons on the top-right side of 
the device. The top button (with the plus sign) turns the volume up, and the 
bottom button (with the minus sign) turns the volume down. The onscreen 
volume slider reflects anything you did to the volume buttons.
Navigating the menu
You can easily jump to the next item in the list. Press the menu key while 
you’re viewing an image, listening to songs, or watching a video clip. On the 
menu that appears, you see the following items:
 
✓ Next: Jumps to the next item in the list. This appears only if an item is 
after this media file in the current folder.
 
✓ Previous: Jumps to the previous item. This appears only if a previous 
item is in the current folder.
 
✓ Delete: Deletes the media file.
 
✓ Move: Moves the file to a different folder.
 
✓ Rename: Lets you rename the media file.
 
✓ Properties: Displays the media file’s location, size, and time of last 
modification.
Changing the media flavor
Like the rest of your Storm applications, you can customize things to be the 
way you prefer. Do it through the Options screen inside Media:
 
1. Press the menu key while in Media.
 You can press the menu key while you’re in any application inside 
Media too.
 
2. Touch-press Options.
 
 The screen looks like the screen shown in Figure 12-5. You can specifi-
cally customize the Picture application and Media in general. Each is 
described in the following sections.

Customizing Picture
You can change the Picture application the following ways:
 
✓ Sort By: Allows you to toggle file sorting based on recent update or 
name.
 
✓ Thumbnails Per Row: When your files appear as a grid of thumbnails 
(small versions of your photos), this number of thumbnails is displayed 
per row. The higher the number, the smaller the thumbnails.
 
✓ Slide Show Interval: When viewing your files in a slide show, a picture 
appears for this many seconds before moving to the next picture.
 
✓ Reserve Picture Memory: Normally left to a default value, but in case 
you want to reserve a memory to make sure that Picture has something 
to use, set it here. This comes into play when you have so many applica-
tions that you’re starting to run out of device memory.
 
✓ Exclude Folders: This is a button where you can navigate your picture 
folders and indicate that you don’t want any of the pictures inside it 
displayed. This is useful for speeding up loading the list of pictures. 
Remember that the fewer pictures you have, the faster it is for the 
Picture applications to load the list. So, it isn’t for your secret folders. 
But hey, you can use it for hiding something too.
Customizing Media
You can finesse the rest of Media:
 
✓ Auto Stop Media Player When Idle: The default is off but you can set it 
at 5, 10, 20, 30, or 45 minutes. This can save you battery life if you get 
distracted and you leave your BlackBerry Storm on a table playing your 
favorite video.

201
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with the Media Player
 
✓ Turn Off Auto Backlighting: Your Storm includes a backlight feature, 
which provides additional screen lighting. It turns on when you move 
your Storm from shade to direct sunlight. When backlighting keeps both-
ering you when you’re watching a movie, this is the place to toggle it off. 
It also a good option to keep that battery juice when you badly need it.
 
✓ Audio Boost: You can set it On or Off.
 
✓ Headset Equalizer: Default to Off but if you want to have a different 
audio setting, you have several options here including Bass Boost, Bass 
Lower, Dance, Hip Hop, Jazz, Lounge, Loud, R&B, Rock, Treble Boost, 
Treble Lower and Vocal Boost.
 
✓ Exclude Folders: You don’t want to display any of the pictures inside 
this folder. This helps make it faster to load the list of pictures. (The 
fewer pictures you have, the faster the Picture application can load the 
list.) This option isn’t for your secret folders.
Working with Media Files
The ways you can get your hands on media files are evolving. Ten years 
back, who’d have thought that we’d be buying music from a tiny card or 
downloading music from an all-you-can-eat monthly subscription?
Some day, you’ll wake up with a technology that doesn’t require you to 
constantly copy media files to your handheld music player. But for now, 
enjoying music on the move means managing these files.
Media is a great music player, but without music files it’s as useless as a 
guitar without strings.
Greeting BlackBerry Desktop 
Media Manager
Heard of Roxio? Roxio is known for its CD-ripping, which is a process to 
convert music files in CD format to other popular compressed formats. 
RIM licensed a portion of Roxio and packaged it with BlackBerry Desktop 
Software. Even though it’s not the whole suite of Roxio software, it’s still 
good news for you because you can now avail yourself of fantastic features, 
such as
 
✓ Ripping CDs
 
✓ Converting files to get the best playback on your BlackBerry

202

✓ Managing music files
 
✓ Syncing media files to your device
 
Do you have an old version of Media Manager? No problem. Point your desk-
top Internet browser to na.blackberry.com/eng/services/desktop 
for directions on downloading the latest version for free and installing it on 
your PC.
In this section, we familiarize you with the Media Manager interface and then 
show you how to copy a video file into your BlackBerry.
Accessing Media Manager
You can get to Media Manager through BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which 
Chapter 14 describes in detail. Get to Desktop Manager on your PC this way:
 
1. Click the Windows Start icon.
 
2. Select All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
3. Click the Media icon.
 
 A screen displays showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
 
4. Click the Start button under the Media Manager section.
 
 A screen displays showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button. The initial Media Manager 
screen is well organized and gives you the following options:
 
• Manage Pictures
 
• Manage Music
 
• Manage Videos
 
• View Connected Devices
 
5. Click one of the options.
When you see the Media Manager screen in Figure 12-7, it may look intimidat-
ing. But it’s really easy to use — plus, it follows the same interface as 
Windows Explorer:
 
✓ The left side is where you navigate to your folders and files.
 
✓ The right side displays the files in the folder you’ve currently selected 
on the left.

The top section looks the same as the bottom section except that the top 
represents your desktop, the bottom represents the BlackBerry Storm, and 
each are named My Media and My Devices, respectively. You can move or 
copy files easily. When you’re copying, for example, one section can be the 
source, and the other section can be the destination. By simply dragging the 
files between the two sections, you can copy on the same screen. Neat, right?

204
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Importing media files to Media Manager
Want a quick and easy way to import media files?
 
1. Use Windows Explorer to get to the media files you want.
 
2. Drag and drop the files into Media Manager.
 
You can drag and drop files to the folder in the left part of the screen, where 
the folder tree appears, or the right part, where the files are listed. Just make 
sure that when you’re doing the latter, the current folder in the tree view is 
the folder where you want the media files to be imported.
Without using Windows Explorer, you can also use Media Manager to locate 
the files you want. The trick is to change the top-left side view in one of the 
sections to Folders. If you look closely at the top-left section, you see two 
tabs. The first tab, My Media, is the default view. The Folders tab has the icon 
of — guess what? — a folder.
Click the folder icon. You see a tree view, but this time it looks exactly as you 
see it in Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 12-8. The files can be in your 
local hard drive or a network folder accessible by your desktop computer.

Adding a media file to your BlackBerry
After you’re familiar with the Media Manager, get those files copied to your 
BlackBerry Storm. Here’s the rundown:
 
1. Connect BlackBerry to your desktop computer with the USB cable that 
came with the device.

205
 Chapter 12: Satisfying Your Senses with the Media Player
 
2. On the Media Manager screen, drag and drop your media files from 
the My Media view to any folder in My Devices.
 
 You can drag and drop an entire album. After dropping a media file, 
you’re prompted to convert the file into a format viewable by your 
BlackBerry, as shown in Figure 12-9.
 
3. Choose an option:
 
• Convert for Optimal Playback: This bet is the safest and is the 
default.
 
• Copy with No Conversion: Copies the file faster. The file is copied to 
your BlackBerry as is, but it might not play in your BlackBerry.
 
• Advanced Conversion Options: From here, another screen lets you 
downgrade the quality to minimize it size. Allows you to crop 
video so the entire screen is filled, instead of seeing dark margins.

Synchronizing with iTunes using 
BlackBerry Media Sync
If you have an iPod, you’re probably using iTunes, keeping a playlist, and sub-
scribing to podcasts or videocast. Podcast are downloaded to iTunes using 
RSS. To clarify the jargon, RSS is short for Really Simple Syndication, a kind of 
digital files publish-subscribe mechanism. This is the mechanism iTunes uses 
to receive audio and video recordings that most people refer to as podcast 
and videocast. Would you like to sync your BlackBerry with iTunes? Wouldn’t 
we all? Follow these quick and easy steps to your BlackBerry Storm - iTunes 
synchronization:
 
1. Click the Windows Start icon.
 
2. Select All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears (refer to Figure 12-6).
 
3. Click the Media icon.
 
 A screen displays showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
 
4. Click the Start button under the BlackBerry Media Sync section.
 
 A screen displays the Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button. A pop-up screen appears just 
like the one shown in Figure 12-10. Note the two arrows on the bottom-
left portion of the screen. Clicking those arrows gives you options of 
what part of iTunes you want synchronized.
 
5. Click the bottom-left Show iTunes Playlist arrows.
 
 A selection of what you have in iTunes shows up, as shown in Figure 
12-11. This is the part of the screen where you choose iTunes media 
file types.

Downloading sounds
RIM has set up a Web site where you can download new ring tones. Simply 
go to http://mobile.blackberry.com/homepage?book=ringtone_
catalog&lang=en&accept=yes and you get a screen similar to the one 
shown in Figure 12-12. From this page, you can sample and download alarms, 
notifiers, and tunes. And did we mention that it’s free?
The ring tone plays when you select it from the three categories. After the 
tune plays, you can save it by pressing the menu key and selecting Save. 
RIM isn’t the only site where you can find ring tones. The Web is a wonderful 
place, so go hunting.

Transferring Media Files 
using the microSD
When in a hurry, running Desktop Manager and opening Media Manager can 
be a drag. One quick option is to copy your media files directly to microSD 
using the familiar Windows Explorer on your PC:
 
1. Connect your Storm to your computer using the USB cable that came 
with your device.
 
 Make sure you have the microSD in your Storm before you do this. 
When connected, a Storm screen displays a prompt for enabling mass 
storage mode.
 
2. Touch-press Yes.
 
 Another screen appears asking you for your password.
 
3. Type your Storm password.
 
 The device is now ready to behave like an ordinary flash drive. On your 
PC, a Removable Disk window appears which displays a couple of 
options to choose from. 
 
4. Select Open Folder to View Files, and then click OK.
 
 The familiar Windows Explorer screen opens. You basically can do 
anything you do with a normal Windows folder. You can drag and drop, 
copy, and delete files.

Chapter 13
Getting around with 
BlackBerry GPS
In This Chapter
▶ Using GPS safely
▶ Preparing to use GPS on your BlackBerry
▶ Choosing a GPS application
A
 few years back when some Northern America network carriers 
introduced global positioning systems (GPS) on their version of the 
BlackBerry, we were quite impressed . . . until we tried it. The response 
time was slow, and it wasn’t accurate. On top of that, the network carriers 
charged an arm and a leg for this inferior service. As it turns out, those GPS 
functions weren’t actually embedded in the BlackBerry. How low tech!
Today, many BlackBerry models, including your BlackBerry Storm, come 
with a built-in GPS.
 
Depending on your network carrier, your BlackBerry Storm GPS might be 
disabled. For example, Verizon Wireless has a history of disabling GPS 
capabilities and steers users toward Verizon’s own GPS application, VZ 
Navigator. However, an application like Google Maps uses both GPS and the 
network to find your location. So if GPS is disabled, Google Maps can still 
approximate where you are on the map.
Putting Safety First
 
Some GPS features are useful not only while you’re walking on the street but 
also while you’re driving a car. Although you’ll be tempted to use your 
BlackBerry GPS while driving, we strongly suggest that you not adjust it while 
you’re driving.
Before you start using BlackBerry GPS in your car, you need to get a car 
holder (preferably a car kit with a car charger) and to resolve the BlackBerry 
light issue.

210
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
 
You can buy a car kit online by searching for BlackBerry car kit. Or go to one 
of the following links:
 
✓ www.shopblackberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberrystuff.com/blackberry_car_kit.htm
By default, the longest your BlackBerry’s backlight can stay on is two 
minutes, so you need something to allow your BlackBerry’s backlight to 
stay on longer. Some GPSs let you prolong the backlight timeout. But a free 
utility called BBLight also does the job. You can get it by going to www.
blackberryfordummies.com/bblight.html.
Now that you have all you need to keep you safe, keep on reading.
Getting What You Need
GPS needs navigation maps, which are usually downloaded in little pieces as 
you need them.
 
If you didn’t subscribe to an unlimited data plan from your network carrier, 
the more you move about and use your GPS, the more map pieces you’ll 
download, which means the more you’ll have to pay.
In general, for a BlackBerry GPS to work, you need
 
✓ A BlackBerry with a built-in GPS or a BlackBerry with an external GPS 
and a Bluetooth connection (which the BlackBerry Storm has)
 
✓ A data plan from your network carrier (unlimited data plan is 
recommended)
 
✓ To be in an area with a radio signal (so you can download the maps)
Choosing GPS Application Options
We’ve identified three GPS applications that you can use on your BlackBerry:
 
✓ BlackBerry Maps
 
✓ Google Maps
 
✓ TeleNav GPS Navigator
Both BlackBerry Maps and Google Maps are free. 

211
 Chapter 13: Getting around with BlackBerry GPS
BlackBerry Maps
Out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with the BlackBerry Maps application. 
See Figure 13-1.
You can use BlackBerry Maps to do the following:
 
✓ Find a location by typing an address or by using Contacts
 
✓ Get point-to-point directions (from an airport to a hotel, for instance)
 
✓ E-mail or SMS a location to colleagues and friends
 
✓ Turn GPS on or off
 
✓ Zoom in and out of the map
You can turn GPS on or off. You can still perform these functions with it 
turned off, but you won’t see where you’re actually located.
You can tweak the light setting in BlackBerry Maps:
 
1. Press the menu key and touch-press Maps.
 
2. Press the menu key and touch-press Options.
 
3. In the Backlight Timeout When field, touch-press < 50% Battery.
 
 You can set this to whatever you like, but we recommend <50% or <25% 
for this field.
 
4. Press menu key and touch-press Save.
Figure 13-1:
BlackBerry

212
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
Google Maps
Google Maps is the mobile version of maps.google.com. It has most of the 
online features, including satellite imaging and traffic information. Best of all, 
it’s free.
Like BlackBerry Map, you can use Google Maps even without a GPS, but it 
gets better. You can search for businesses and landmarks, just as you do on 
maps.google.com. It’s like having the ultimate 411 (with a map) at the tip of 
your fingers.
Because Google Maps doesn’t come with your BlackBerry, you need to 
download it.
 
 
1. Open your BlackBerry Storm Browser.
 
 
2. Go to www.google.com/gmm.
 
 The Web page loads and its icon appears on your Home screen.
 
3. After Google Maps is loaded, press the menu key.
 
 The menu shown in Figure 13-2 opens. From here you can do the 
following:
 
• Find businesses and landmarks, including phone numbers, street 
addresses, and Web addresses
 
• Find and map exact addresses
 
• Get step-by-step directions from point A to point B
 
• View satellite images of the current map (shown in the left of 
Figure 13-3)
 
• Get traffic information for major highways
With GPS on, your current location is a blue blinking dot. The right part of 
Figure 13-3 shows this dot.
 
You can use these Google Maps shortcuts:
 
✓ Zoom in: I key
 
✓ Zoom out: O key (That’s the letter O.)
 
✓ Go to the current location: 0 key (That’s the number 0.)
 
You need to have a radio signal to download maps to your BlackBerry Storm. 
In addition, we recommend having an unlimited data plan if you use the GPS 
a lot.

TeleNav GPS Navigator
TeleNav GPS Navigator is a full-featured GPS solution; it’s a GPS device 
replacement, which means the folks at TeleNav want you to use your 
BlackBerry in the car. Unlike the other products listed earlier, TeleNav has 
turn-by-turn voice instructions to get you to your destination.

214
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your Storm 
At the time of this writing, TeleNav hadn’t fixed the backlight timeout issue. 
This means that about every two minutes, you must press a key on your 
BlackBerry to keep the light on.
TeleNav’s feature list is extensive and includes these:
 
✓ 3D maps; see Figure 13-4
 
✓ Real-time compass
 
✓ Wi-Fi hotspot finder
The list goes on and on. The feature we like the most is the human-voice 
step-by-step driving directions.
The extensive features come at a price. Depending on your network carrier, 
TeleNav costs about $10 a month and offers a 60-day free trial. Visit www.
telenav.com for more information. After the product is downloaded, an 
icon appears on your screen.

Part IV
Working with 
Desktop Manager

In this part . . .
H
ere you discover essential information about some 
behind-the-scenes-yet-integral processes. Read all 
about Desktop Manager, which you direct to monitor and 
control database synchronization (Chapter 14), and how 
to leverage Device Switch Wizard to migrate your existing 
data to your new BlackBerry (Chapter 15). You also find 
how to back up your data (Chapter 16) and the many 
ways of installing applications (Chapter 17) to your 
BlackBerry Storm.

Chapter 14
Syncing the Synchronize Way
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing BlackBerry Desktop Manager
▶ Preparing your PC for PIM synchronization
▶ Using manual and automatic synchronization
W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry Storm updated than to 
synchronize or reconcile it with your desktop application’s data?
Arguably, most of the data you need to synchronize is from your Personal 
Information Manager (PIM) applications: notes, appointments, addresses, and 
tasks. The crucial piece for data synchronization to and from your device 
and desktop computer is Synchronize. This third-party software allows you 
to synchronize as well as upload and download media files between your PC 
and BlackBerry.
In this chapter, we introduce Synchronize. We show you how to manually 
and automatically synchronize your BlackBerry Storm with your desktop 
computer. We also offer tips for which options you might want to use. Before 
we get into all that, however, we include a section on BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
Meeting Your BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager
The centerpiece of the desktop activities that you can do with your 
BlackBerry Storm is BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), which is a suite of 
programs that include the following:
 
✓ Application Loader: Installs BlackBerry applications and updates the 
BlackBerry OS.
 
✓ Backup and Restore: Backs up your BlackBerry data and settings. Check 
out Chapter 16 for details.

218
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
✓ Synchronize: Synchronizes BlackBerry data to your PC (a topic of this 
chapter).
 
✓ Media Manager: Uploads media files to your BlackBerry Storm from 
your PC and vice versa (another topic in this chapter).
BDM is the software included on the CD that comes with your handheld 
device. Your BlackBerry Storm’s packaging tells you how to install BDM on 
your desktop computer.
Installing BDM and Desktop Redirector
The CD that comes with your BlackBerry Storm allows you to install BDM. At 
the same time, you can install Desktop Redirector. When you insert the CD, 
the installation wizard automatically runs. Follow the wizard. One of the 
screens on the wizard allows you to choose whether this installation is for 
personal or for work e-mail. Choosing for work actually allows you to use 
e-mail for both personal and work using the Desktop Redirector.
Desktop Redirector allows you to redirect e-mail that you receive on your 
Outlook. This means even if you get your e-mails through Outlook, you can 
have those e-mails redirected to your personal BlackBerry.
 
If you want to redirect your Outlook e-mail to your BlackBerry, when you’re 
installing BDM, make sure you click Desktop Redirector in the installation 
screen, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Figure 14-1:
Configure 
the BDM 
install to 
include 
Desktop 
Redirector.
 

219
 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Launching BDM
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch BDM through 
your computer’s Start menu:
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
2. Connect your Storm to your computer using the USB cable that came 
with your device.
 
 When you connect your Storm to a PC, your Storm screen displays a 
prompt for enabling mass storage mode. It also asks for your Storm 
password. In mass storage mode, your Storm behaves like a flash drive. 
A new drive is added to My Computer in Windows Explorer, which 
allows you to treat the microSD in your Storm as a normal flash drive.
 
3. Launch BDM.
 
 The BDM opening screen appears; see Figure 14-2.
BDM installation can vary from phone provider to provider. At the very least, 
you should see at least four icons or applications:
 
✓ Application Loader (Chapter 17)
 
✓ Backup and Restore (Chapter 16)
 
✓ Media (see Chapter 12)
 
✓ Synchronize
 
Figure 14-2: 
BlackBerry 
Desktop

220
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
Connecting BDM to your Storm
You establish a connection between your BlackBerry Storm and BDM 
through the USB cable that comes with your device.
 
Before you start connecting BDM to your BlackBerry Storm, find out what 
your BlackBerry Storm PIN is. You can find out your PIN in Chapter 8.
Follow these steps to connect your BlackBerry to BDM:
 
1. Plug in your device to your desktop.
 
2. Launch BDM.
 
 When BDM is running, it tries to find a BlackBerry on the type of connec-
tion specified. The default connection is USB, so you shouldn’t need to 
configure anything.
 
3. If your device has a password, BDM prompts for the password.
 
4. Enter the password.
 
 You see Connected as the screen heading. If for some reason you 
see Disconnected and no password prompt, one of the following is 
happening:
 
• BDM can’t find the device being connected via the USB cable.
 
• The connection setting isn’t set to use USB.
 
5. Choose Options➪Connection Options at the side of the BDM screen.
 
 The screen shown in Figure 14-3 appears. Make sure that the connection 
setting uses USB.
 
6. In the Connection Type drop-down list, select the USB connection with 
your BlackBerry Storm’s PIN.

221
 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Running BDM for the first time
If you’re running BDM for the first time, the program does these things:
 
✓ Tries to make the initial configuration on your machine, which includes 
security encryption setup. It asks you to randomly move your mouse to 
generate security encryption keys.
 
✓ Checks what applications you have on your device and what required 
applications need to be installed. If it can’t find a required application on 
your device, it prompts you to install it. Of course, you have the option 
to cancel and install later.
 
✓ Looks at the settings you have for your Synchronize software. If auto-
synchronization is turned on, BDM attempts to run synchronization for 
your PIM. This is discussed later, in the “Synchronizing automatically” 
section.
Setting Up Synchronize
Synchronize is the part of BDM that allows you to coordinate your data 
between your desktop computer and your BlackBerry Storm. Synchronize is 
one of the icons on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. To launch the 
program, simply double-click the Synchronize icon. A screen appears like the 
one in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-4:
The 
Synchronize 
screen.
 

222
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
The Synchronize screen is divided into two sections, which you can navigate 
through the left links:
 
✓ Synchronize is the default view and allows you to manually trigger syn-
chronization. See Figure 14-4. See the “Using On-Demand Synchronize” 
and “Synchronizing automatically” sections later in this chapter for 
more details and for when you use this screen.
 
✓ Configuration is where you can set up configuration and rules for 
reconciling data. Within this are two subsections, Synchronization and 
Add-ins. These further organize the interface. See Figure 14-5. The first 
thing you need to figure out is the Synchronization subsection. The next 
section helps you do that.
Figure 14-5:
The 
Configur-
ation 
screen.
 
Configuring PIM synchronization
Notice this important item in the Synchronization configuration subsection, 
as shown in Figure 14-5: the Synchronization button. You use that button to 
configure PIM (personal information manager) synchronization.
PIM info includes the following:
 
✓ Calendar
 
✓ MemoPad
 
✓ Address Book
 
✓ Tasks

223
 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Clicking the Synchronization button displays the screen in Figure 14-6. You 
can see that names correspond to the Storm applications except for 
Contacts, which goes by Address Book. This is the entry point of the entire 
synchronization configuration for PIM applications. Selecting the application 
on this screen allows you to pair the PIM handheld application to a desktop 
application; Outlook in this example.
The PIM Configuration screen allows you to select which application data 
you want to sync with your Blackberry. The following popular PIM applica-
tions can be synched to your Storm: ACT!, ASCII Text File Converter, Lotus 
Notes, Lotus Organizer, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and 
Microsoft Schedule.
Here are the four types of application data that can be synchronized to your 
Blackberry:
 
✓ Calendar can be selected if you want to synchronize your appointments 
and events stored in your favorite PIM application.
 
✓ MemoPad can be selected if you want to synchronize any notes or text 
that you may have been storing in your PIM application.
 
✓ Address Book can be selected if you want to synchronize any contact 
information into your Storm.
 
✓ Tasks can be selected if you want to synchronize your to-do list.
Figure 14-6:
The PIM 
Configur-
ation 
screen.
 

224
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
Follow these steps to set up your device’s synchronization:
 
1. Connect your Storm to BDM.
 
2. Click the Synchronize icon.
 
3. In the Configuration section, select Synchronization.
 
 In the Synchronization Configuration section, you see a Configure 
Synchronization Settings for my Desktop Program label. Click the 
Synchronization button beside this label, and the PIM configuration 
screen is displayed.
 
4. Choose an application data type (such as Calendar, MemoPad, 
Address Book, and Tasks) to synchronize.
 
 Highlight an application data type (in this example, we selected the 
Calendar application data type) and click the Setup button. This brings 
up Calendar Setup screen.
 
5. Select a PIM application to retrieve application data from by highlight-
ing your desired application.
 
 BDM pulls your selected application data from the application selected 
from this screen (in Figure 14-7, we selected Microsoft Outlook). This 
means when you synchronize your Storm, the BDM retrieves Calendar 
data from Microsoft Outlook.
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 The Synchronization Options screen appears (see Figure 14-8).
 
Figure 14-7: 
Choose the 
desktop 
application 
here.

 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
Figure 14-8: 
Decide 
which 
direction 
synchro-
nization 
follows 
here.
 
 
7. In the Synchronization Options screen, select which direction the 
synchronization will follow.
 
 Here are the three synchronization direction options available:
 
• Two Way Sync allows you to synchronize changes both in your 
Storm and in your desktop application.
 
• One Way Sync from Device synchronizes only the changes made to 
your Storm. Changes to your desktop application aren’t reflected 
in your Blackberry.
 
• One Way Sync to Device synchronizes changes made in your 
desktop application to your Storm. Any changes made in your 
Storm aren’t reflected in your desktop application.
 
8. Click the Next button.
 
 The Options screen opens for the PIM application you selected in 
Step 5. Figure 14-9 shows the Microsoft Outlook Options screen (see 
Figure 14-9).
 
 For synchronization to Microsoft Outlook, make sure you’re selecting 
the correct user profile in the Outlook User Profile drop-down list. This 
is particularly pertinent in cases where you have multiple user profiles 
in your computer. Choosing the wrong one may result in your putting 
the wrong data into your Storm.
 
 The amount of data that is reconciled or synchronized on a given 
application can also be controlled. For example, as shown in Figure 14-9, 
the last portion of the configuration allows you to specify whether 
to transfer all Calendar items or just a set of appointments according 
to dates.

226
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 14-9: 
Specific 
application 
settings can

in this 
screen.
 
 
9. Click the Next button.
 
 This brings you to the Calendar Setup Finish screen. You can just click 
the Finish button to complete configuring the Calendar synchronization 
you’ve selected.
Mapping fields for synchronization
For all four PIM applications, Synchronize is intelligent enough to know what 
information, such as names, phone numbers, and addresses in Contacts, 
corresponds to Outlook. These bits of information or attributes are referred 
to as a field. For instance, the value of a home phone number field in a 
contact needs to be mapped to the corresponding field in Outlook so that 
information is transferred correctly.
But not all fields on the desktop side exist on the handheld (and vice versa). 
For example, a Nick Name field doesn’t exist in the BlackBerry Contacts but is 
available on Exchange (Outlook) Address Book. In some instances, 
Synchronization provides an alternate field and lets you decide whether 
to map.
If you ever find the need to change the default mapping, you can. The 
interface is the same for all PIM applications. To illustrate how to map and 
un-map fields, we use Address Book.
The following steps lead you to the screen that allows you to map the fields 
for Address Book:

227
 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
1. From BDM, click Synchronize.
 
2. Click Synchronization from the Configuration subsection link.
 
3. Click the Synchronization button.
 
 The PIM Configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 14-6).
 
4. Click Address Book to highlight.
 
 The Advanced button is enabled.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced screen opens, as shown in Figure 14-10.
 
6. Click the Map Fields button.
 
 The Map Fields screen for Address Book/Contacts application appears; 
see Figure 14-11. To map or un-map, click the arrow keys.
 
 If you’re not careful, you can inadvertently unclick Job Title mapping, 
and suddenly titles aren’t in sync. Double-check your mapping before 
you click the OK button. If you think you made a mistake, you can click 
Cancel to save yourself from having to restore settings.
 
7. Click OK to save your changes.

Confirming record changes
Face facts: Doing a desktop synchronization isn’t very interesting, and few 
people perform it on a regular basis. 
You can tell Synchronize to prompt you for any changes it’s trying to make 
(or perhaps undo) on either side of the wire. The Advanced screen comes 
in here. To get to this view, follow these steps:
 
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears.
 
2. Click Synchronization from the Configuration subsection link.
 
3. Click the Synchronization button.
 
 The PIM configuration screen appears; refer to Figure 14-6.
 
4. Click Address Book to highlight.
 
 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, click that 
application from the list.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced screen for Address Book screen appears; refer to 
Figure 14-10. This screen has a Confirmations section and gives you 
two options:
 
• Confirm Record Deletions (Recommended)
 
• Confirm Changes and Additions (Recommended)
 
 Regardless of whether you select the first option, Synchronize displays 
a prompt if it detects that it’s about to delete all records.

229
 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Resolving update conflicts
Synchronize needs to know how you want to handle any conflicts between 
your BlackBerry and desktop application. A conflict normally happens 
when the same record is updated in the BlackBerry and also in Outlook. For 
instance, you change Jane Doe’s mobile number in Storm and also change 
her mobile number in Outlook. Where you resolve these conflicts is the same 
for all PIM applications. Again, for illustration, we use Address Book as an 
example:
 
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears. 
 
2. Click Synchronization from the Configuration subsection link.
 
3. Click the Synchronization button.
 
 The PIM configuration screen appears; refer to Figure 14-6.
 
4. Click Address Book to highlight.
 
 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that 
application from the list.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears; refer to Figure 
14-10. This screen has five sections, and the third section is Conflict 
Resolution. And on this section, note the Conflict Resolution button.
 
6. Click the Conflict Resolution button.
 
 The Conflict Resolution screen is shown in Figure 14-12.
 
 You can tell Synchronize to handle conflicts in a few ways. Here are the 
options shown in the Address Book Advanced Settings screen:
 
• Add All Conflicting Items: When a conflict happens, add a new 
record to the BlackBerry for the changes on the desktop and add a 
new record to the desktop for the changes on the BlackBerry.
 
Figure 14-12: 
Manage 
conflicts 
here.
 

230
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Ignores the change and keeps the data 
the same on both sides.
 
• Notify Me When Conflict Occur: This option is the safest. 
Synchronize displays the details of the conflict and lets you 
resolve it.
 
• Device Wins: Unless you’re sure this is the case, you shouldn’t 
choose this option. It tells Synchronize to disregard the changes in 
the desktop and use handheld changes every time it encounters a 
conflict.
 
• Microsoft Outlook Wins: If you’re not using MS Outlook, this option 
is based on your application. This option tells Synchronize to 
always discard changes on the handheld and use the desktop 
application change whenever it encounters a conflict. Again, we 
don’t recommend this option because there’s no telling on which 
side you made the good update.
 
7. Click the option you want.
 
8. Click OK to save the settings.
Ready, Set, Synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Earlier in this chapter, we show you how to 
define synchronization filters and rules for your e-mail and PIM data. Now it’s 
time to be brave and push the button. You can synchronize one of two ways:
 
✓ Manually (by clicking the Synchronize Now icon)
 
✓ Automatically (by choosing How Often on the calendar)
Using On-Demand Synchronize
This portion of Synchronize is a feature that lets you run synchronization 
manually. Remember that even if you set up automatic synchronization, 
actual synchronization doesn’t happen right away. So, if you made updates to 
your appointments in Outlook while your Storm is connected to your PC, this 
feature allows you to be sure that your updates made it to your Storm before 
heading out the door.
Without delay, here are the steps:
 
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears; refer to Figure 14-4. The following four 
check boxes let you be selective:

231
 Chapter 14: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
• Reconcile Messages: E-mail.
 
• Synchronize Organizer Data: Includes notes, appointments, 
addresses, and tasks.
 
• Run Add-In Actions: This option comes to play when you have 
third-party applications that require data synchronization between 
your PC and your Storm.
 
• Update Device Date and Time: You only need it if you want both 
PC and Storm to have the same time. This ensures that you’re 
reminded of your appointments at the same time for both Outlook 
and Storm.
 
2. Select the check boxes of the data you want synchronized.
 
3. Click the Synchronize button.
 
 Synchronize starts running the synchronization, and you see a progress 
screen. If you set up prompts for conflicts and Synchronize encounters 
one, a screen appears so you can resolve it. When finished, the progress 
screen disappears, and the Synchronize screen reappears.
 
 If you’ve turned on automatic synchronization (see the next section), 
the items you select in Step 2 automatically sync every time you connect 
your BlackBerry Storm to your PC.
 
4. Click the Close button.
Synchronizing automatically 
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Synchronize setup? 
Rarely, right? After you have it configured, that’s it. And if you’re like us, the 
reason you open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is because you want to run 
Synchronize. Opening Synchronize and clicking the Synchronize Now button 
is somewhat annoying.
 
If you want to make Synchronize run automatically every time you connect 
your BlackBerry Storm to your PC, simply make sure you select the very last 
check box in Figure 14-4 — Synchronize the Items When Your Device is 
Connected to the BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
You might be asking what items auto-synchronization synchs? Good 
question. The items you’ve checked in the top portion of Figure 14-4.

Switching Devices
In This Chapter
▶ Switching from an old BlackBerry to Storm
▶ Switching from non-BlackBerry to Storm
W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could just make one device’s data available 
to another? That’s the future. But right now, RIM wants to make 
switching devices as painless as possible. That’s why an application called 
Device Switch Wizard is part of the suite of applications in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
Switching to BlackBerry Storm
Switching from an older BlackBerry to your BlackBerry Storm is no big deal. 
When you want to transfer application data (e-mails and contacts, for 
example) to your new Storm, the BlackBerry Desktop Manager’s Device 
Switch Wizard backs up your old BlackBerry and loads that backup to your 
new device.
 
1. On your PC, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 The Desktop Manager screen opens, where you can find Device Switch 
Wizard, as shown in Figure 15-1.
 
2. Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
 
 The Device Switch Wizard screen lets you choose whether to switch 
from BlackBerry to BlackBerry or from non-BlackBerry to BlackBerry. 
On the BlackBerry to BlackBerry section, it tells you to connect your 
current (old) BlackBerry to your PC.

234
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 15-1: 
Launch 
Device 
Switch 
Wizard 
here.
 
 
3. Connect your old BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable.
 
4. Click the Start button below the Switch BlackBerry devices.
 
 The next screen lets you verify the PINs for both devices, the old 
BlackBerry in the left and your Storm in the right, as shown in Figure 
15-2. Because you only connected your old BlackBerry, it should be 
preselected.
 
 Your BlackBerry PIN isn’t a password, but your BlackBerry SmartPhone 
identifier. You can find your BlackBerry PIN by going to Options➪
Status.
 
5. Decide whether to include user data and third-party applications and 
click the Next button.
 
 If you want all the data, leave the screen untouched; this backs up every-
thing. Third-party applications are all the programs you installed — the 
ones that didn’t come with the device originally.
 
 Some older BlackBerry applications cater to keyboard, trackwheel, and 
trackballs, and might not work on the Storm. At first, include user data 
only, not third-party applications.
 
 A status screen appears, showing the progress of the backup operation. 
When the backup is finished, the next screen prompts you for the PIN of 
your Storm.

6. Connect your new BlackBerry Storm to your PC with the micro-USB 
cable.
 
 The next screen, shown in Figure 15-3, lets you verify that your Storm 
is connected properly with the PIN displayed. It also asks you for the 
password.
 
Figure 15-3:

7. Enter the password of your Storm and click the OK button.
 
 A screen similar to Figure 15-4 tells you what will be restored to the new 
device. Nothing has been done to your Storm yet, and this is your last 
chance to cancel the process.
 
8. Click the Finish button.
 
 A progress screen shows you the loading process.
 
9. When the Success screen appears, click the Close button.

Switching from a Non-BlackBerry Device
Device Switch Wizard supports two types of non-BlackBerry devices: 
 
✓ Palm
 
✓ Microsoft Windows Mobile
This doesn’t mean that you can’t import your old data if you have another 
device. The Device Switch Wizard just makes it simpler for these two types of 
devices. Check out Chapter 14 for synchronization options to your Desktop 
PIM application if your old device is neither Palm nor Microsoft Windows 
Mobile.
Palm device requirements
Your equipment has to meet three prerequisites for Device Switch Wizard to 
import data from Palm to BlackBerry:
 
✓ Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
 
✓ One of the following Palm Desktop software versions must be installed 
on your desktop:
 
• 4.0.1
 
• 4.1

237
 Chapter 15: Switching Devices
 
• 4.1.4
 
• 6.0.1
 
✓ The Palm Desktop software installed is synchronizing properly with the 
Palm device.
You can check your Palm user guide for more details about your Palm device 
and on synchronizing it to PC. You can also download the user guide from 
www.palm.com/us/support/downloads.
Windows Mobile device requirements
You need the following things for the wizard to work properly with a 
Windows Mobile device:
 
✓ Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
 
✓ One of the following Microsoft ActiveSync versions must be installed on 
your PC: 
 
• 4.0.1
 
• 4.1
 
• 4.1.4
 
• 6.0.1
 
✓ The Mobile device must run one of the following operating systems:
 
• Microsoft Windows Mobile 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003SE, or 2005/5.0 
for Pocket PC
 
• Microsoft Windows Mobile SmartPhone software 2002, 2003, or 
2003 SE
Running the wizard
Before you run the wizard, make sure that all the requirements for your 
device are in place. We also recommend hot-syncing or synchronizing your 
Palm or Windows Mobile device; this ensures that the data you’re sending to 
your BlackBerry is current. Palm Desktop software as well as the Microsoft 
ActiveSync should come with help information on how to hot-sync.
Although the following steps migrate Windows Mobile data into the 
BlackBerry, the steps are similar for Palm as well. We indicate at what point 
the steps vary. Do the following to get your other device’s data migrated over 
to your new BlackBerry:

238
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
1. Connect both the Windows Mobile device and the BlackBerry Storm 
to your desktop computer.
 
2. On your PC, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 The Desktop Manager screen appears; refer to Figure 15-1.
 
3. Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
 
 The Device Switch Wizard screen appears.
 
4. Click the image next to Switch from another Device to BlackBerry 
Device.
 
 The welcome screen, as shown in Figure 15-5, describes what the tool 
can do.
 
5. Click the Next button.
 
 A screen prompts you to decide whether you’re migrating from Palm 
or Windows Mobile, as shown in Figure 15-6. The wizard is intelligent 
enough to enable the option associated to the connected device, which 
in this case is the Windows Mobile device.

data from 
a non-
BlackBerry 
device.
 
 
Figure 15-6: 
The wizard 
has already 
selected 
which 
device 
to port.
 

239
 Chapter 15: Switching Devices
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 Hot-syncing of Windows Mobile device kicks in at this point. You see a 
series of screens appearing for each of the device data. A sample of it 
for the Calendar data is shown in Figure 15-7. Nothing comes of it if you 
already performed a hot-sync before running the wizard; otherwise, it 
will take some time depending on how much data it has to sync between 
the device and the desktop software.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 A progress screen appears. Before the data is applied to your BlackBerry 
Storm, the wizard prompts you about the change, as shown in Figure 
15-8. Click the following buttons on this screen to either confirm or 
reject the change: 
 
• Details: Click this if you want to know the records the wizard is 
trying to apply.
 
• Accept: Click this if you just want the data migrated.
 
• Reject: Allows you to ignore this data and continue.
 
• Cancel: If you change your mind and cancel the whole operation.
 
8. Click the Accept or Reject button on any confirmation screens that 
appear.
 
 The wizard migrates all the data you accepted. When the migration 
process is finished, a success screen appears.
 
9. Click the Finish button.

Protecting Your Information
In This Chapter
▶ Getting into backup and restore
▶ Performing a full backup of your BlackBerry Storm data
▶ Restoring from backups
▶ Backing up, restoring, and clearing in your own way
▶ Backing up and restoring wirelessly
I
magine that you left your beautiful BlackBerry Storm in the back of a cab. 
You’ve lost your Storm for good. Okay, not good. What happens to all 
your information? How are you going to replace all those contacts? What 
about security?
One thing that you don’t need to worry about is information security — 
if you set up a security password on your BlackBerry. With security pass-
word protection on your Storm, anyone who finds your Storm has only ten 
chances to enter the correct password; after those ten chances are up, it’s 
self-destruction time. Although it isn’t as smoky as Mission Impossible, your 
BlackBerry Storm does erase all its information, thwarting your would-be 
data thief.
 
Set up a password for your Storm now! For information on how to do so, see 
Chapter 3.
Now, how to get back all the information that was on your BlackBerry Storm? 
If you’re like us and store important information on your BlackBerry, this 
chapter is for you. Vital information, such as clients’ and friends’ contact 
information, notes from phone calls with clients — and, of course, those pre-
cious e-mail messages — shouldn’t be taken lightly. Backing up this informa-
tion is a reliable way to protect it from being lost forever.
If your BlackBerry is not in a BlackBerry Enterprise Server, which is typically 
the case when you work for a large corporation, BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
is the only way to back up and restore information to and from your desktop 
PC. But in the recent months, SmrtGuard has come up with a wireless backup 
and restore service for those who don’t have the habit of plugging their 

242
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
BlackBerry into their PC. If that’s you, go to the end of this chapter where we 
introduce SmrtGuard’s backup and restore solution that will give you peace 
of mind when it comes to protecting your data.
Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is a BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM) application. It 
allows you to back up all the sensitive data on your BlackBerry, including 
contacts, e-mails, memos, to-dos, all personal preferences and options, 
and more.
Note: For most of you, your e-mails are already stored in accounts, such as 
Gmail or Yahoo! mail. But some still like to back up e-mails just in case.
 
1. Install BDM on your PC.
 
 For instructions on installing BDM, see Chapter 14.
 
2. Connect your Storm to your PC with the USB cable that came with 
your BlackBerry.
 
 If everything is set up right, a pop-up window on your PC asks you to 
type your BlackBerry security password.
 
3. Type your password.
 
 The BlackBerry connects to the PC.
 
4. Double-click the Backup and Restore icon on the BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager screen.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen opens; see Figure 16-1. You’re ready to 
back up data from or restore information to your BlackBerry.
 
Figure 16-1: 
The Backup 
and Restore 
screen.
 

243
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Information
Backing Up BlackBerry Style
We all know that backing up your data provides tremendous peace of mind. 
So do the folks at RIM, which is why backing up your information is quite 
easy. You can back up your BlackBerry Storm manually or by autopilot.
Backing up your Storm manually
To back up your BlackBerry Storm on demand, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BDM screen, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears; refer to Figure 16-1.
 
2. Click the Backup button.
 
 The dialog box shown in Figure 16-2 appears, so you can name the 
backup file and figure out where on your PC you want to save it.
 
3. Name your backup file and choose a place to save it.
 
4. Select Save.
 
 BDM starts backing up your BlackBerry information onto your PC. Figure 
16-3 shows the backup progress in the Transfer in Progress window.
 
 Don’t unplug your BlackBerry Storm from the PC until the backup is 
finished! The folks at RIM have made the USB transfer fast, so you don’t 
have to wait that long!
 
5. When the Transfer in Progress window disappears, you can unplug 
the BlackBerry from the PC.
 
Figure 16-2: 
Decide 
where to 
save your 
backup file.
 

244
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 16-3:

Setting up automatic backups
What’s better than backing up your information once? Remembering to back 
up regularly! What’s better than backing up regularly? You guessed it — 
running backups automatically. After you schedule automated BlackBerry 
backups, you can really have peace of mind when it comes to preventing 
information loss.
Follow these steps to set up an autobackup:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Options button.
 
 The Backup and Restore Options screen appears, where you can 
schedule automatic backups. See Figure 16-4.
 
Figure 16-4: 
Set auto-
backups 
here.
 

245
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Information
 
3. Select the Back Up My Device Automatically Every option.
 
 This lets you make more decisions (check boxes and options become 
active), such as how often you want BDM to back up your BlackBerry.
 
4. In the Days field, select a number of days between 1 and 99.
 
 This interval sets how often your BlackBerry Storm is backed up. For 
example, if you enter 14, your Storm is backed up every 14 days.
 
5. Select the Backup All Device Application Data option.
 
 This option backs up all the data on your BlackBerry Storm each time 
autobackup runs.
 
 Although you can exclude e-mail messages and information, such as 
from Contacts, to-do’s, and memos, we recommend that you back up 
everything each time.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Now you can go on with your life without worrying when to back up.
 
To run a backup, your BlackBerry Storm must be connected to your PC. Make 
sure you plug your Storm into your PC once in a while so autobackup has a 
chance to back up your information.
Restoring Your Data from 
Backup Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once. A full 
restore means bringing back all your information from a backup. It probably 
means you’ve lost information that you had hoped to find from the backup 
you created on your PC.
The steps to fully restoring your backup information are simple:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Restore button.
 
 An Open File dialog box asks where the backup file is on your PC.
 
3. Choose a backup file and click Open.
 
 A warning window appears when you’re about to do a full restore 
(see Figure 16-5), alerting you that you’re about to overwrite existing 
information.

246
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 16-5: 
Be care-
ful when 
overwriting 
existing info.
 
 
4. Click OK to go ahead with the full restore.
 
 A progress bar appears.
 
 It might take a while for the full restore to finish. Don’t unplug your 
BlackBerry Storm from your PC during this time!
 
5. When the progress bar disappears, unplug the device from the PC.
Protecting Your Data, Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry have in common that you can have 
it your way with their products. Just like you can get your burger with or 
without all the extras (such as pickles and onions), you can choose to not 
back up and restore things that you know you won’t need.
For example, say you’ve accidentally deleted all your Internet bookmarks and 
now you want them back. Don’t restore all the information from your last 
backup. That could be more than 90 days ago (depending on how often your 
autobackup runs, if at all). You might unintentionally overwrite other infor-
mation, such as e-mail or new contacts. You want to restore bookmarks only.
If you lose something in particular, or want something specific back on your 
BlackBerry, use the selective backup and restore function in BDM and restore 
only what you need. The same goes with backing up. If you’re a big e-mail 
user, back up just your e-mails and nothing else.
 
In this section, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as technical 
as you think. Think of a database as an information category on the 
BlackBerry. For example, saying, “backing up your Browser bookmarks 
database” is just a fancy way of saying, “backing up all your Browser 
bookmarks on your BlackBerry.”

247
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Information
We start with a selective backup and then describe a selective restore.
Backing up, your way
To back up specific information, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The advanced Backup and Restore screen appears, as shown in Figure 
16-6. The right side of the screen shows different information categories, 
or databases.
 
Figure 16-6: 
The 
advanced 
Backup and 
Restore 
screen.
 
 
3. In the left list, Ctrl+click the databases you want to back up.
 
4. Click the left-facing (backup) arrow.
 
 A progress bar moves while your BlackBerry Storm is backed up. This 
step merely transfers the databases onto your PC; it doesn’t save them. 
When the backup transfer is finished, you can see the two databases 
on the left side of the window.
 
5. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 A file chooser appears.
 
6. Name your file and specify where you want to save it on your PC.
 
 This saves your selective backup on your PC. Make sure to name it 
something specific so you know what exactly is in the backup.

248
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
You need to manually save the backup file on your PC even after you choose a 
location for the file in Step 3. A selective backup doesn’t automatically save 
your backup on your PC.
Restoring, your way
However, when restoring selectively, you must already have a backup file to 
restore from. Although this might sound obvious, the point we’re making is 
that you can selectively restore from any backup — auto or manual.
For example, say you have autobackup running every other day, and you 
want to restore only your e-mail messages from two days ago. You don’t need 
to do a full restore; that would overwrite the new contact you put in your 
Contacts yesterday. Rather, you can use the selective restore method and get 
back only your e-mail messages.
To restore your way, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The advanced Backup and Restore screen appears; refer to Figure 16-6. 
The right side of the screen shows your different information categories, 
or databases.
Looking at backup BlackBerry files
Whether you use the one button-push backup 
method or you manually back up your file, the 
file is saved on your PC as an .ipd file. Those 
curious readers out there might be asking, “Can 
I read these backup files without a BlackBerry?” 
The answer is yes! With a third-party product 
called ABC Amber BlackBerry Converter, you 
can view any .ipd file. What’s the point? 
Suppose you lost your BlackBerry Storm but 
need to read an old e-mail or to get contacts 
from your backup files. This tool allows you to 
convert anything in your backup file (e-mails, 
SMS messages, PIM messages, and contacts) 
into PDF or Word documents. For more informa-
tion and to try ABC Amber BlackBerry Converter 
for free, go to www.processtext.com/
abcblackberry.html.
Because anyone with Amber BlackBerry 
Converter can look into your backups, make 
sure you secure your backup files so only you 
can get to it.

249
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Information
 
3. Choose File➪Open.
 
 A window opens so you can choose which backup file you want to 
restore from.
 
 A BlackBerry backup file has an .ipd extension.
 
4. Select a backup file.
 
5. Click the Open button.
 
 The different information categories, or databases, appear on the left 
side of the screen. You’re now ready for a selective restore.
 
6. Select categories (or databases).
 
 You can select multiple databases by Ctrl+clicking the databases 
you want.
 
7. Click the right-facing (Restore) arrow.
 
 You’ll likely see a warning window asking whether you want to replace 
all the information with the data you’re restoring. Refer to Figure 16-5.
 
 If your BlackBerry Storm has the same categories as the ones you’re 
restoring (which is likely), you’ll overwrite any information you have on 
your BlackBerry.
 
 You can confidently move on to Step 8 if you know the database you’re 
restoring has the information you’re looking for.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 A progress bar appears while the selective restore is going. When the 
progress bar window disappears, the information categories that you’ve 
selected are restored on your BlackBerry.
Clearing BlackBerry information, 
your way
You can also delete information on your BlackBerry Storm from BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager. When would you use selective deletion?
Suppose you want to clear only your phone logs from your BlackBerry. One 
way is to tediously select one phone log at a time and press Delete, repeating 
until all phone logs are gone. However, you could delete a database from 
the advanced Backup and Restore screen by using the Backup and Restore 
function.

250
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
To selectively delete databases on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
 
1. From BDM on your PC, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The advanced Backup and Restore screen appears; refer to Figure 
16-6. The right side of the screen shows your BlackBerry’s different 
databases.
 
3. Ctrl+click the database(s) you want to delete.
 
 The database is highlighted.
 
4. Click the Clear button on the right side of the screen.
 
 A warning window asks you to confirm your deletion.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 A progress bar shows the deletion. When the progress bar disappears, 
the information categories you selected are cleared from your 
BlackBerry.
Backing Up and Restoring Wirelessly
Yes, that is right! Your BlackBerry Storm can do this without being on BES. 
However, you do have to pay a little bit for this service; at the time of writing, 
they’re in private beta.
The product is SmrtGuard, www.SmrtGuard.com. SmrtGuard is a piece of 
software that sits on your Storm that can wirelessly back up your data. 
Currently, SmrtGuard supports address book contacts, memos, and to-dos 
and is planning to support calendars, pictures, and phone logs in the near 
future.
In addition to its backup and restore capabilities, SmrtGuard also has fea-
tures to help you locate, recover, and destroy device-side data. SmrtGuard 
has a tracking or lojack feature that helps you determine whether you simply 
misplaced your device or whether your device is stolen. After you determine 
that your device is stolen, you can send a signal to have your data destroyed 
via the SmrtGuard Dashboard on www.SmrtGuard.com.
We’ll have more information as SmrtGuard cooks up more features. Be sure 
to check our Web site at www.BlackBerryForDummies.com and check 
www.SmrtGuard.com for more on this.

▶ Installing a BlackBerry application
▶ Uninstalling an application
▶ Upgrading your operating system
▶ Browsing and installing AppCenter and StoreFront
I
n this book’s Parts of Tens, we point out a few great applications that 
make your BlackBerry that much more productive. We also reveal a few 
games that make your BlackBerry more entertaining than ever.
Think of your BlackBerry as a mini laptop where you can run preinstalled 
applications as well as install new applications. You can even upgrade your 
BlackBerry’s operating system. (Yup, that’s right; your BlackBerry even has 
an operating system.)
We start this chapter by introducing Application Loader, which allows you 
to load applications (who’d have guessed?) onto your BlackBerry. Then we 
show you how to install and uninstall an application from your BlackBerry. 
Finally, we show you how to use Application Loader to upgrade your operat-
ing system.
Accessing Application Loader
In this chapter, as with other chapters in Part IV, you work closely with 
your PC and your BlackBerry Storm. On your PC, you use an application 
called BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), which comes on a CD along with 
your BlackBerry. For an introduction to BlackBerry Desktop Manager, see 
Chapter 14. Application Loader is in BlackBerry Desktop Manager.

252
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
After installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC, do the following to 
access Application Loader:
 
1. On your PC, select Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager opens.
 
2. Connect your BlackBerry Storm to your PC via your USB cable.
 
 Doing so connects your Storm to your PC. If successful, you see the 
password dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-1. If not, see whether the 
USB cable is connected properly to both your PC and your Storm 
and then try again. If all else fails, contact the technical support of your 
service provider.

 Chapter 17: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Installing an Application
 
In this chapter, we install iSkoot for Skype for BlackBerry. iSkoot is a free 
application that connects to the Web directly and allows you to use Skype. 
You can download this application at www.download.com/iSkoot-for-
Skype-BlackBerry-/3000-7242_4-10797721.html.
No matter what application you’re installing from your PC to your BlackBerry 
Storm, the steps are the same. As of this writing, vendors haven’t published 
updated versions of their products that support Storm. But you can use the 
following steps as a guide to installing the application of your choice.
 
1. Install the application on your PC.
 
 The installation onto your PC varies, depending on the application, so 
refer to its manual.
 
2. Locate the application’s ALX file.
 
 You can usually find a file with the .alx extension in the folder where 
you installed the application on your PC.
 
 The ALX file doesn’t get installed on your Storm; rather, it tells 
Application Loader where the actual application file is located on 
your PC.
 
3. Click Application Loader from BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
 
 The Application Loader screen shows. Refer to Figure 17-2.
 
4. Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
 
 The screen listing of what applications to install appears.
 
5. Click the Browse button and locate and select the ALX file you want to 
install.
 
 The ALX file is usually in the folder where you installed the application 
on your PC.
 
 You return to the Application Loader screen, where iSkoot is one of the 
applications in the list, as shown in Figure 17-3.
 
6. Select iSkoot Skype for Blackberry and click Next.
 
 A summary screen shows up listing only the applications that will be 
installed or upgraded.
 
7. Click Finish.
 
 The installation process starts, and a progress window appears. When 
the progress window disappears — and if all went well — the applica-
tion is on your BlackBerry Storm. The application should be under the 
Applications folder of your BlackBerry Storm.

Figure 17-3:
Your appli-
cation is 
added to 
the list of 
installed 
and can be 
installed 
into Storm.
 
If you get an invalid signature error after clicking the Finish button:
 
✓ You didn’t get your Storm from your employer: Something is probably 
wrong with the application. You need to contact the software vendor.
 
✓ You got your BlackBerry from your employer: You don’t have permis-
sion to install applications on your BlackBerry. The IT department rules 
the school.
 
You don’t have to use Application Loader to get the goods onto your 
BlackBerry. You can install applications other ways as well:
 
✓ Wirelessly through an over-the-air (OTA) download. See Chapter 9 for 
more on wireless installations.
 
✓ BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) wireless install (if your BlackBerry 
is employer provided). In this case, you have no control over the 
installation process. Your company’s BlackBerry system administrator 
controls which applications are on your BlackBerry.
Uninstalling an Application
You can uninstall an application in two ways:
 
✓ Using Application Loader
 
✓ Using your BlackBerry handheld
As in the preceding section on installing, we use iSkoot as an example and 
assume that you already installed the iSkoot application. Of course, you can 
follow the same steps for uninstalling other applications.

255
 Chapter 17: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Uninstalling with Application Loader
The steps to uninstalling a BlackBerry application are similar to installing:
 
1. On your PC, launch Application Loader.
 
2. Click Next.
 
3. Enter your password; refer to Figure 17-1.
 
 If your handheld isn’t connected properly, the PIN of your device won’t 
show up in the Application Loader screen. Refer to Figure 17-2. Connect 
your Storm to the USB cable and connect the USB cable to the PC.
 
 After entering your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
 
4. Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
 
 The screen listing of applications appears similar to Figure 17-3.
 
5. Scroll to the application you want to delete and clear its check box.
 
 The Action column for iSkoot indicates Remove.
 
6. Click Next.
 
 A Summary screen listing the action of the Application Loader shows up. 
It lists iSkoot to be removed from your BlackBerry.
 
7. Click Finish.
 
 The uninstall process starts, and a progress window appears. When the 
progress window disappears, you have uninstalled the application from 
your Storm.
Uninstalling with your 
BlackBerry handheld
When you don’t have access to your PC, you can uninstall an application 
from your BlackBerry handheld:
 
 
1. Touch-press the Options icon from the BlackBerry Home screen.
 
 
 The Options application opens. If you’re holding Storm in por-
trait mode, press the menu key to find the Options icon.
 
2. Scroll to Advanced Options and select Applications.
 
 The list of applications installed on your Storm appears, as shown in 
Figure 17-4.

4. Touch-press Delete (see Figure 17-5).
 
 A confirmation dialog box appears.
 
5. Touch-press Delete to confirm the deletion.
 
 You’re given a choice to restart now or at a later time. After restarting, 
the deleted application is uninstalled.

 Chapter 17: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Upgrading Your BlackBerry OS
Your Storm is RIM’s latest product as of this writing and should come with 
the latest version of BlackBerry operating system (OS). So, you shouldn’t need 
this section for some time. But when it comes down to it, the BlackBerry OS 
update comes from BlackBerry Handheld Software, which is available from 
two sources:
 
✓ Your network service provider
 
✓ Your BlackBerry system administrator
 
The handheld software may differ from provider to provider, so get it from 
the service provider’s Web site. We compiled a location of the download 
pages for different service providers at www.blackberryfordummies.com/
bhs.html.
In this section, we assume that the latest BlackBerry Handheld Software for 
Storm is already installed on your PC. For help with installing BlackBerry 
Handheld Software, refer to the instructions that come with it.
 
You should upgrade your BlackBerry OS only when you have to or are told to 
by your network service provider or your corporate BlackBerry system admin-
istrator. We discourage you from upgrading; why ruin a good thing? The risk 
of losing data is always there — as well as the risk that things that won’t work 
as well as before.
 
To address the risk of information loss, RIM designed Application Loader to 
automatically back up for you as part of the OS upgrade. However, our experi-
ence has taught us to perform a full backup manually as an extra precaution. 
The Application Loader backup isn’t always complete in our experience. See 
Chapter 16 for more on backing up data manually.
After you finish a manual backup of your BlackBerry Storm, you can start the 
upgrade process by doing the following:
1. Enter your BlackBerry Storm password (if you had set one) into 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC.
 
2. Click Application Loader on the Desktop Manager screen.
 
 The Application Loader screen appears, as shown earlier in Figure 17-2.
 
3. Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
 
 A list of software appears, as shown in Figure 17-6.

258
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 17-6: 
Application 
updates 
that are 
available.
 
 
4. With your mouse, you can opt out of the upgrade by deselecting the 
OS portion.
 
 This appears as BlackBerry 4.7 System Software in Figure 17-6.
 
 The OS is listed only if you need an upgrade — it means that your 
BlackBerry OS is out of date. If the OS doesn’t appear in the list, the 
handheld software you installed on the desktop machine is the same as 
the one installed on your device, or a prior version compared to the one 
installed on your device.
 
 You also need to back up your device in case something goes wrong on 
the upgrade. Backup options can be done through the Options button.
 
5. Click the Options button.
 
 The Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 17-7. This is where you 
decide whether you want to back up your BlackBerry content before 
upgrading your OS.
 
 We recommend selecting Back Up Device Automatically During the 
Installation Process.
 
Figure 17-7: 
Command 
Application 
Loader to 
back up the 
device here 
(Options 
screen).
 

259
 Chapter 17: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
 
6. Select Backup and click OK.
 You’re back on the previous screen as shown in Figure 17-6.
 
7. Click the Next button.
 
 A summary page confirms your actions. A final chance for you to either 
proceed with the OS upgrade or not.
 
8. Click the Finish button.
 
 The BlackBerry OS upgrade starts, complete with a progress window 
showing a series of steps and a progress bar. The entire process takes 
ten minutes or more, depending on your PC model and the OS version 
you’re upgrading to.
 
 At times during the BlackBerry OS upgrade, your BlackBerry Storm 
display goes on and off. Don’t worry; this is normal.
 
 When the progress window disappears, the OS upgrade is complete.
Finding and Installing Applications 
from App Stores
With the success of iPhone App Store, several copycats are sprouting every-
where for other platforms including the BlackBerry. App Store is an applica-
tion that behaves as storefronts showcasing applications that you can 
download directly to your device. Applications can be either free or needs 
your credit card number:
 
✓ Handango (www.handango.com): Handango is one of the oldest store-
fronts selling applications for the mobile devices. The company started 
selling apps through the Web but now have an app store that you can 
download from the Web site.
 
✓ CrackBerry On-Device App Store (http://CrackBerryAppStore.
com): Partnering with Mobihand, CrackBerry also provides an app store 
where you can find great applications to download.
 
✓ BlackBerry Application Center: This app store is still cooking in RIM’s 
oven as of this writing but the concept is the same. Check our compan-
ion Web site (www.blackberryfordummies.com) regularly for 
updates. We’ll post a download link when it becomes available.

T
he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a charger, 
a micro USB cable, and a belt clip. If you’re like us, though, you’re not 
satisfied with what is included in the box. In this chapter we present the 
accessories that we think supplement your BlackBerry well — and we tell you 
where to shop for them. 
 
Please check our companion Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com, 
for an updated accessories list.

264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
microSD Card
Your new BlackBerry Storm may or may not come with external memory: a 
microSD card. And we bet that is the first thing you’ll be looking for after you 
get your BlackBerry Storm. After all, you want to carry with you a boatload of 
music and video files, right? Many electronic gadgets use microSD cards, so 
they’re easy to find.
A normal price range at the time of this writing is $20 for a 4GB capacity 
and $30 for an 8GB capacity. Your best bet of finding a good deal is on the 
Internet. Special promotions come and go, but we noticed that there’s always 
a good deal somewhere. Our best advice is to just shop around. And for any 
Internet purchase, take into consideration the shipping and handling costs 
plus the vendor’s return policy (or lack thereof). 
 
Any brand will do, as long as you make sure you’re buying a microSD card.
BlackBerry Remote Stereo Gateway
Do you want to make your home-entertainment center play the music in your 
BlackBerry Storm? The Remote Stereo Gateway is for you. Connect this tiny 
device to your stereo system and you can transmit music wirelessly from 
your BlackBerry Storm (for about $90). 
 
You can get it from RIM’s shopping site at www.shopblackberry.com.
Stereo Headsets
Although your new BlackBerry is a stereo music player, it doesn’t come with 
stereo headphones. You will definitely yearn for stereo sound the moment 
you listen to music or watch video clips. A quick search on the Internet for 
BlackBerry Storm + stereo headphones yields many results. But you want to 
be able to talk too. 
You could spend $30 to $200. We like several:
 
✓ BlackBerry stereo headset with noise-isolating ear gels
 
✓ V-MODA Vibe duo in-ear headphones with mic
 
✓ Motorola S9 stereo Bluetooth headset 

265
 Chapter 18: Ten Great BlackBerry Storm Accessories 
 
The best place to get stereo headphones for your BlackBerry is good ol’ 
Amazon: www.amazon.com.
Case and Belt Clip
You have plenty of cases to choose from, with looks ranging from sporty to 
professional. These cases will set you back anywhere from $20 to $40, which 
isn’t too bad for looking hip.
Here’s where you can buy a new case or belt clip:
 
✓ crackberry.com
 
✓ www.bberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberryden.com
 
✓ www.blackberrysource.com
 
✓ www.blackberrystuff.com
 
When you buy a new belt case or clip, buy one made specifically for 
BlackBerry Storm.
Screen Protector
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit stressful for 
your wallet, try Blackberry Storm Pro high-definition screen protector with 
mirror effect. That’s a mouthful, but for about $10 it protects your screen 
from scratches. Go to accessorygeeks.com.
Extra Battery
An extra battery for your BlackBerry Storm will come in handy if you’re a 
daily user. We recommend buying your battery only from Research In Motion 
at www.shopblackberry.com, and not from some other manufacturer. A 
faulty battery can damage your BlackBerry beyond repair.
 
Make sure the battery you buy is for your BlackBerry model. You’ll spend 
around $50 for the extra battery. 

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Battery Charger
If you watch video on your BlackBerry Storm, you know the battery needs to 
be charged every couple of hours. And if you’re always on the go, you better 
have a portable charger on hand. The charger included with your BlackBerry 
is great to carry around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapters 
for different countries’ electric plugs.
If you’re a road warrior, we recommend the BlackBerry car charger. It will set 
you back around $30.
 
Make sure that the charger you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
You can get a BlackBerry car charger from the following:
 
✓ shop.crackberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberrysource.com
 
✓ www.blackberrystuff.com
 
✓ shopblackberry.com (RIM’s official store)
Full Keyboard
If you write long e-mails or draft long proposals on your BlackBerry Storm, a 
full-sized keyboard is perfect for you. You’ll save time and your thumbs.
 
You have your choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth connection options. 
We recommend Bluetooth to minimize the clutter. A Bluetooth keyboard is 
the most convenient option for the obvious reasons: You don’t have to carry 
cables, and you can position your BlackBerry any way you want. 
For less than $100, you can own the cool iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth 
keyboard, available at www.amazon.com. Or you can buy the ThinkOutside 
Stowaway Shasta Bluetooth keyboard for BlackBerry, available at 
yahooshopping.com for $45.

267
 Chapter 18: Ten Great BlackBerry Storm Accessories 
External Speaker
BlackBerry comes with a speaker, but if the sound quality just isn’t good 
enough for your listening taste, an external Bluetooth speaker can bring your 
outdoor listening to the next level:
 
✓ Blueant M1 Bluetooth stereo speakers
 
✓ Motorola EQ5 wireless travel stereo speaker
For about $110, you can get either of them from shop.crackberry.com.
Car Mount
To complete your BlackBerry car experience, mount your BlackBerry in 
your car. The market offers many products ranging from $15 to $30. You can 
search from major sites. You can get also get it from BlackBerry sites: 
 
✓ shop.crackberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberrysource.com
 
✓ www.blackberrystuff.com
 
Make sure the product you’re picking supports BlackBerry Storm.

▶ SmrtGuard
▶ Handmark Pocket Express
▶ Google Talk Mobile and Yahoo! Messenger Mobile
▶ iSkoot Skype Client
▶ MobiTV

T
he industry of BlackBerry software is growing at a dizzying rate. At the 
time we’re writing this book, many software vendors have said they will 
support Storm but haven’t yet rolled out a Storm version. But we are almost 
certain with the BlackBerry world taken by Storm, the software titles will 
blow you away.
These choices are the results of finding out what people use via either message 
board posts or commentaries in the public domain. The applications featured 
here are just the tip of the iceberg. By all means, surf the Internet; more 
software will be available by the time you’re reading this. 
 
And don’t forget to visit our Web site for updates at www.blackberry
fordummies.com.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
PeeKaWho: E-Mail and SMS Preview
Have you ever wished that your BlackBerry had an e-mail notifier? You know, 
the kind you’re used to in Outlook or Google Notifier? Say you’re typing an 
e-mail reply to set up a meeting time and place, but suddenly your BlackBerry 
vibrates, which means a new e-mail just arrived. You want to check that new 
e-mail, so you first save your e-mail as draft and then go back to the inbox 
and open the e-mail to read. Ahh, painful.
Imagine you have PeeKaWho. Now when you get a new e-mail, you immediately 
see who sent it, and you get a message preview. Simple, to the point, and we 
love it. Don’t take our word for it; try PeeKaWho at smrtguard.com/peek.jsp.
Slacker
If you like streaming music, you’ll like Slacker on the BlackBerry Storm. You 
can search through the online selection of songs and personalize a playlist. 
If you’ve used Pandora music service on your desktop, you’re familiar. The 
application can also store music on your BlackBerry microSD card so you 
can listen offline. For more information, go to www.Slacker.com.
BerryStore
Your BlackBerry Storm comes with the Application Center where you can 
directly download applications. Most of those applications have been 
filtered by the network carriers, which most of the time is a good thing; they 
make sure the software in the Application Center is compatible with your 
BlackBerry Storm. 
However, if you want to find some gems, we recommend downloading 
BerryStore, which works similar to Application Center. Download applications 
from it and find cool new applications to try. Download BerryStore at 
www.berrystore.com.

 Chapter 19: Ten Must-Have BlackBerry Programs
SmrtGuard: Your BlackBerry Guardian
What would happen to your data if you lost your BlackBerry? Sensitive 
e-mails, your phone call histories, your contacts, and all your appointments? 
It’s scary to think of a stranger getting to know you this way. 
Thankfully there’s SmrtGuard (formerly known as BerryFinder.com), which 
provides the following tools:
 
✓ Locate and track your BlackBerry: You can track (without a GPS) 
whether your BlackBerry is being taken or see its approximate location. 
Did you simply misplace your BlackBerry or did someone actually steal it?
 
✓ Wireless data backup: This is another must-have feature that 
SmrtGuard provides. If you actually self-destroyed your data and don’t 
have a backup, the scheduled wireless backup of your PIM (calendar, 
memo, tasks) data comes in handy. From its Web site, you can even see 
and browse through your backed-up data and export to a file (Excel or 
text).
 
✓ Sounding the homing beacon: If you simply misplaced your BlackBerry 
but can’t find it by calling (you muted it), no worries. Just send a homing 
beacon, and your BlackBerry emits a loud sound regardless of your 
profile setting. We wish our remote controls had this feature!
 
✓ Self-destruct in five seconds: Okay, not in five seconds, but you can 
decide when to destroy all your BlackBerry data. That includes e-mails, 
contacts, appointments, to-dos, memos, phone logs, and all the files on 
your microSD. 
 
 Always protect your BlackBerry with a password. That way your data 
will erase after ten unsuccessful password entries. However, it doesn’t 
delete the files on your microSD. This is why SmrtGuard is so helpful.
With a BlackBerry guardian by your side, you can worry about your business 
instead of your BlackBerry data being stolen. Register your BlackBerry at 
www.SmrtGuard.com. 
Handmark Pocket Express
If we have to recommend one application, Pocket Express is it. This handy, 
reliable tool gets news and other information such as weather, sports 
updates, maps, and stocks. The user interface is intuitive, and you can buy 
other applications from Pocket Express. And the best part? It’s almost free. 
(Pocket Express charges a fee for accessing premium channels.) Download 
Pocket Express from your BlackBerry at express.handmark.com.

Google Talk Mobile and Yahoo! 
Messenger Mobile
If you currently use Google Talk or Yahoo! Messenger on your PC, try the 
mobile version. To download, point your BlackBerry browser to one of these 
URLs:
 
✓ Google Talk Mobile at www.blackberry.com/GoogleTalk
 
✓ Yahoo! Messenger Mobile at www.blackberry.com/YahooDownload
iSkoot Skype Client
Are you a big Skype fan? Now you don’t have to sit on your computer to 
use the service. The folks at iSkoot make it possible to fully use Skype 
functionality from your BlackBerry. Calling a Skype buddy? No problem. 
Chatting with your Skype friends? That’s what this program is for. Plus, it’s 
free! To download it from your PC, go to www.iskoot.com.
MobiTV
TV on your BlackBerry? That’s right. MobiTV streams live television to your 
BlackBerry for a fee. You can find channels like CNBC, Discovery Channel, 
and a whole lot more. At the time of this writing, MobiTV only supports 
BlackBerry 8130 (the Pearl). But check on its Web site for a version on the 
BlackBerry Storm. To get started, go to www.mobitv.com/gettv/.
Bookworm
A warning: The Bookworm word game is addictive. It is part crossword 
puzzle, part word jumble, and part arcade puzzler. Your job is to feed Lex, 
the hungry bookworm, with words. You can buy it or download a free trial 
version at bb.magmic.com/game?show=Bookworm.

▶ Other browsing categories
W
eb surfing with a BlackBerry has improved dramatically with the 
newer models. With higher screen resolution and bigger real estate, 
your Storm should give you one of the best mobile Web-browsing experi-
ences. Prior to Storm, we would tell you where to find Web sites designed 
for mobile devices because most Web pages displayed horribly on the older 
devices. That’s not the case anymore; most Web pages now display just as 
good in Storm. So, the browsing habit you have on your PC can now be main-
tained in Storm. 
These Web site recommendations are based on reviews in the public domain 
and sites that definitely help you on the go.

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Weather
Weather changes quite often, but you can keep up with the sites in this section.
 
✓ AccuWeather.com (www.accuweather.com): AccuWeather.com 
provides the local weather forecast.
 
✓ Weather.com (www.weather.com): Weather.com is smart enough to 
know that you’re using a mobile device and displays a nice trim version 
of its page with few links to non-weather–related information.
If these two sites aren’t good enough, check out the “Portals” section later in 
this chapter. Major portals have weather information as well as traffic alerts 
and airport delays.
News
Most major news companies have mobile versions of their sites. This 
section is just a sampling of what’s out there. We list the same Web address 
as you would expect when browsing from your desktop. These sites detect 
that you’re using a SmartPhone and redirect you to the mobile-friendly 
version of their sites:
 
✓ ABC News (www.abcnews.com): Get ABC News on TV on your 
BlackBerry.
 
✓ BBC News (www.bbc.com): You can read the BBC News right from your 
BlackBerry Storm, even if you’re not in the UK.
 
✓ CNN (cnn.com): This is CNN’s mobile-friendly Web site.
 
✓ The New York Times (www.nytimes.com): This automatically points 
to the New York Times mobile-friendly Web site, a clean and easy site to 
navigate without a lot of advertisements.
 
✓ Reuters (www.reuters.com): A mobile-friendly version of the Reuters 
site.
 
✓ USA Today (usatoday.com): USA Today, one of the most popular 
newspapers, is now available for free from your BlackBerry.
 
✓ Wired News (mobile.wired.com): Wired News is the mobile version of 
this tech news Web site.

277
 Chapter 20: Ten Web Site Categories for Storm Browsing
Searches, Directories, and Portals
The sites in this section are Web portals, which are sites that contain various 
information or links to other sites.
 
✓ Google (www.google.com): The king of search engines works like a 
charm in your Storm.
 
✓ MSN (msn.com): You can access MSN Hotmail, MSN Messenger, and an 
online calendar. It has all the features that you can find in a Web portal, 
such as Web search, weather lookup, sports information, and news. Plus 
you get their finance-related pages, which give you up-to-the-minute 
stock quotes.
 
✓ RIM mobile home page (mobile.blackberry.com): This is the default 
home page setting for most BlackBerry browsers. The service provider 
can customize it, though, so your BlackBerry browser may point to your 
service provider’s home page. RIM’s home page is definitely a place to 
start browsing the Web.
 
 You should definitely bookmark this site.
 
✓ Yahoo! Mobile (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo! is a smart portal because it 
knows you’re using a mobile device and formats the page accordingly, 
meaning a smaller page with no advertisements. The portal site allows 
BlackBerry users to employ regular Yahoo! functions, such as Yahoo! 
Mail, Messenger, Finance, and Games, as well as driving directions and 
weather.
 
 You should definitely bookmark this site.
Business
You can keep up with the latest news of the finance world from your 
BlackBerry. Visit the sites in this section for finance-related articles and 
news.
 
✓ BusinessWeek Online (www.businessweek.com): This is another place 
to get great finance information.
 
✓ Fidelity (fidelity.com): Fidelity is an online investment brokerage 
firm.
 
✓ Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com): This is a great site for checking 
your stock information.
